<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S on the Sea-beat Shore BRITANNIA sat,</L>
<L>Of her degenerate Sons, the faded Fame,</L>
<L>Deep in her anxious Heart revolving sad:</L>
<L>Bare was her throbbing Bosom to the Gale,</L>
<L>That hoarse, and hollow, from the bleak Surge blew;</L>
<L>Loose flow'd her Tresses; Rent her Azure Robe</L>
<L>Hung o'er the Deep: from her Majestick Brow</L>
<L>She tore the Laurel, and she tore the Bay.</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd the copious Grief to bathe her Cheek;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Nor ceas'd her Sobs to murmur to the Main.</L>
<L><HI>Peace</HI> discontented nigh, departing, stretch'd</L>
<L>Her Dove-like Wings. And <HI>War,</HI> tho' greatly rous'd,</L>
<L>Yet mourn'd his fetter'd Hands. While thus the <HI>Queen</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of Nations</HI> spoke; and what she said the <HI>Muse</HI></L>
<L>Recorded, faithful, in unbidden Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>EVEN not you Sail, that, from the Sky-mixt Wave,</L>
<L>Dawns on the Sight, and wafts the ROYAL YOUTH,</L>
<L>A Fraight of future Glory to my Shore;</L>
<L>Even not the flattering View of golden Days,</L>
<L>And rising Periods yet of bright Renown,</L>
<L>Beneath the PARENTS, and their endless Line</L>
<L>Thro' late revolving Time, can sooth my Rage;</L>
<L>While, unchastis'd, the insulting <HI>Spaniard</HI> dares</L>
<L>Infest the trading Flood, full of vain War</L>
<L>Despise my <HI>Navies,</HI> and my <HI>Merchants</HI> seize;</L>
<L>As, trusting to false Peace, they fearless roam</L>
<L>The World of Waters wild, made, by the Toil,</L>
<L>And liberal Blood of glorious Ages, mine:</L>
<L>Nor bursts my sleeping Thunder on their Head.</L>
<L>Whence this unwonted Patience? This weak Doubt?</L>
<L>This tame Beseeching of rejected Peace?</L>
<L>This meek Forbearance? This unnative Fear,</L>
<L>To generous <HI>Britons</HI> never known before?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
And sail'd my <HI>Fleets</HI> for this; on <HI>Indian</HI> Tides</L>
<L>To float, unactive, with the veering Winds?</L>
<L>The Mockery of War! While foul Disease,</L>
<L>And Sloth distemper'd, swept off burning Crowds,</L>
<L>For Action ardent; and amid the Deep,</L>
<L>Inglorious, sunk Them in a watry Grave.</L>
<L>There now they lie beneath the rowling Flood,</L>
<L>Far from their Friends, and Country unaveng'd;</L>
<L>And back the weeping <HI>War-Ship</HI> comes again,</L>
<L>Dispirited, and thin; her Sons asham'd</L>
<L>Thus idly to review their native Shore;</L>
<L>With not one Glory sparkling in their Eye,</L>
<L>One Triumph on their Tongue. A Passenger,</L>
<L>The violated <HI>Merchant</HI> comes along;</L>
<L>That far-sought Wealth, for which the noxious Gale</L>
<L>He drew, and sweat beneath Equator Suns,</L>
<L>By lawless Force detain'd; a Force that soon</L>
<L>Would melt away, and every Spoil resign,</L>
<L>Were once the <HI>British Lyon</HI> heard to roar.</L>
<L>Whence is it that the proud <HI>Iberian</HI> thus,</L>
<L>In their own well-asserted Element,</L>
<L>Dares rouze to Wrath the <HI>Masters of the Main</HI>?</L>
<L>Who told him, that the big, incumbent <HI>War</HI></L>
<L>Would not, ere this, have rowl'd his trembling Ports</L>
<L>In smoaky Ruin? And his guilty Stores,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Won by the Ravage of a butcher'd World,</L>
<L>Yet unatton'd, sunk in the swallowing Deep,</L>
<L>Or led the glittering Prize into the <HI>Thames</HI>?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a Time (Oh let my languid Sons</L>
<L>Resume their Spirit at the rouzing Thought!)</L>
<L>When all the Pride of <HI>Spain,</HI> in one dread Fleet,</L>
<L>Swell'd o'er the labring Surge; like a whole Heaven</L>
<L>Of Clouds, wide-roll'd before the boundless Breeze.</L>
<L>Gaily the splendid <HI>Armament</HI> along</L>
<L>Exultant plow'd, reflecting a red Gleam,</L>
<L>As sunk the Sun, o'er all the flaming Vast;</L>
<L>Tall, gorgeous, and elate; drunk with the Dream</L>
<L>Of easy Conquest; while their bloated War,</L>
<L>Stretch'd out from Sky to Sky, the gather'd Force</L>
<L>Of Ages held in its capacious Womb.</L>
<L>But soon, regardless of the cumbrous Pomp,</L>
<L>My dauntless <HI>Britons</HI> came, a gloomy Few,</L>
<L>With Tempest black, the goodly Scene deform'd,</L>
<L>And laid their Glory waste. The Bolts of Fate</L>
<L>Resistless thunder'd thro' their yielding Sides;</L>
<L>Fierce o'er their Beauty blaz'd the lurid Flame;</L>
<L>And seiz'd in horrid Grasp, or shatter'd wide,</L>
<L>Amid the mighty Waters, deep they sunk.</L>
<L>Then too from every Promontory chill,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Rank Fen, and Cavern where the wild Wave works,</L>
<L>I swept confederate Winds, and swell'd a Storm.</L>
<L>Round the glad Isle, snatch'd by the vengeful Blast,</L>
<L>The scatter'd Remnants drove; on the blind Shelve,</L>
<L>And pointed Rock, that marks the indented Shore,</L>
<L>Relentless dash'd, where loud the <HI>Northern Main</HI></L>
<L>Howls thro' the fractur'd <HI>Caledonian</HI> Isles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SUCH were the Dawnings of my liquid Reign;</L>
<L>But since how vast it grew, how absolute,</L>
<L>Even in those troubled Times, when dreadful <HI>Blake</HI></L>
<L>Aw'd angry Nations with the <HI>British Name,</HI></L>
<L>Let every humbled State, let <HI>Europe</HI> say,</L>
<L>Sustain'd, and ballanc'd, by my <HI>Naval Arm.</HI></L>
<L>Ah what must these immortal Spirits think</L>
<L>Of your poor Shifts? These, for their Country's Good,</L>
<L>Who fac'd the blackest Danger, knew no Fear,</L>
<L>No mean Submission, but commanded Peace.</L>
<L>Ah how with Indignation must they burn?</L>
<L>(If ought, but Joy, can touch aetherial Breasts)</L>
<L>With Shame? With Grief? To see their feeble Sons</L>
<L>Shrink from that Empire o'er the conquer'd Seas,</L>
<L>For which their Wisdom plann'd, their Councils glow'd,</L>
<L>And their Veins bled thro' many a toiling Age.</L>

<L>OH first of human Blessings! and Supreme!</L>
<L>Fair PEACE! how lovely, how delightful thou!</L>
<L>By whose wide Tie, the kindred Sons of Men,</L>
<L>Like Brothers live, in Amity combin'd,</L>
<L>And unsuspicious Faith; while honest <HI>Toil</HI></L>
<L>Gives every Joy, and to those Joys a Right,</L>
<L>Which idle, barbarous <HI>Rapine</HI> but usurps.</L>
<L>Pure is thy Reign; when, unaccurs'd by Blood,</L>
<L>Nought, save the Sweetness of indulgent Showers,</L>
<L>Trickling distils into the vernant Glebe;</L>
<L>Instead of mangled Carcasses, sad-seen,</L>
<L>When the blythe Sheaves lie scatter'd o'er the Field;</L>
<L>When only shining Shares, the crooked Knife,</L>
<L>And Hooks imprint the vegetable Wound;</L>
<L>When the Land blushes with the Rose alone,</L>
<L>The falling Fruitage, and the bleeding Vine.</L>
<L>Oh, PEACE! thou Source, and Soul of social Life;</L>
<L>Beneath whose calm, inspiring Influence,</L>
<L><HI>Science</HI> his Views inlarges, <HI>Art</HI> refines,</L>
<L>And swelling <HI>Commerce</HI> opens all her Ports;</L>
<L>Blest be the <HI>Man divine,</HI> who gives us Thee!</L>
<L>Who bids the Trumpet hush his horrid Clang,</L>
<L>Nor blow the giddy Nations into Rage;</L>
<L>Who sheaths the murdrous Blade; the deadly Gun</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Into the well-pil'd Armoury returns;</L>
<L>And, every Vigour, from the Work of Death,</L>
<L>To grateful Industry converting, makes</L>
<L>The City flourish, and the Country smile.</L>
<L>Unviolated, Him the Virgin sings;</L>
<L>And Him the smiling Mother to her Train.</L>
<L>Of Him the Shepherd, in the peaceful Dale,</L>
<L>Chaunts; and, the Treasures of his Labour sure,</L>
<L>The Husbandman of Him, as at the Plow,</L>
<L>Or Team, He toils. With Him the Sailor sooths,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling Moon, the Midnight Wave;</L>
<L>And the full City, warm, from Street to Street,</L>
<L>And Shop to Shop, responsive, rings of Him.</L>
<L>Nor joys one Land alone; his Praise extends</L>
<L>Far as the Sun rolls the diffusive Day;</L>
<L>Far as the Breeze can bear the Gifts of Peace,</L>
<L>Till all the happy Nations catch the Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT would not, PEACE! the <HI>Patriot</HI> bear for Thee?</L>
<L>What painful Patience? What incessant Care?</L>
<L>What mixt Anxiety? What sleepless Toil?</L>
<L>Even from the rash Protected what Reproach?</L>
<L>For He thy Value knows; thy Friendship He</L>
<L>To human Nature: but the better thou,</L>
<L>The richer of Delight, sometimes the more</L>

Inevitable WAR; when ruffian Force</L>
<L>Awakes the Fury of an injur'd State:</L>
<L>Then the good easy Man, whom Reason rules;</L>
<L>Who, while unhurt, knew nor Offence, nor Harm,</L>
<L>Rouz'd by bold Insult, and injurious Rage,</L>
<L>With sharp, and sudden Check, th' astonish'd Sons</L>
<L>Of Violence confounds; firm as his Cause,</L>
<L>His bolder Heart; in awful Justice clad;</L>
<L>His Eyes effulging a peculiar Fire:</L>
<L>And, as he charges thro' the prostrate War,</L>
<L>His keen Arm teaches faithless Men, no more</L>
<L>To dare the sacred Vengeance of the Just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND what, my thoughtless <HI>Sons,</HI> should fire you more,</L>
<L>Than when your well-earn'd Empire of the Deep</L>
<L>The least beginning Injury receives?</L>
<L>What better Cause can call your Lightning forth?</L>
<L>Your Thunder wake? Your dearest Life demand?</L>
<L>What better Cause, than when your Country sees</L>
<L>The sly Destruction at her Vitals aim'd?</L>
<L>For Oh it much imports you, 'tis your All,</L>
<L>To keep your <HI>Trade</HI> intire, intire the Force,</L>
<L>And Honour of your <HI>Fleets</HI>; o'er that to watch,</L>
<L>Even with a Hand severe, and jealous Eye.</L>
<L>In Intercourse be gentle, generous, just,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
By Wisdom polish'd, and of Manners fair;</L>
<L>But on the Sea be terrible, untam'd,</L>
<L>Inconquerable still: let none escape,</L>
<L>Who shall but aim to touch your Glory there.</L>
<L>Is there the Man, into the Lyon's Den</L>
<L>Who dares intrude, to snatch his Young away?</L>
<L>And is a <HI>Briton</HI> seiz'd? and seiz'd beneath</L>
<L>The slumbring Terrors of a <HI>British Fleet</HI>?</L>
<L>Then ardent rise! Oh great in Vengeance rise!</L>
<L>O'erturn the Proud, teach Rapine to restore:</L>
<L>And as you ride sublimely round the World,</L>
<L>Make every Vessel stoop, make every State</L>
<L>At once their Welfare and their Duty know.</L>
<L>This is your Glory; this your Wisdom; this</L>
<L>The native Power for which you were design'd</L>
<L>By <HI>Fate,</HI> when <HI>Fate</HI> design'd the firmest State,</L>
<L>That e'er was seated on the subject Sea;</L>
<L>A State, alone, where LIBERTY should live,</L>
<L>In these late Times, this Evening of Mankind,</L>
<L>When <HI>Carthage, Rome,</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> are no more,</L>
<L>The World almost in slavish Sloth dissolv'd.</L>
<L>For this, these Rocks around your Coast were thrown;</L>
<L>For this, your Oaks, peculiar harden'd, shoot</L>
<L>Strong into sturdy Growth; for this, your Hearts</L>
<L>Swell with a sullen Courage, growing still</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
As Danger grows; and Strength, and Toil for this</L>
<L>Are liberal pour'd o'er all the fervent Land.</L>
<L>Then cherish this, this unexpensive Power,</L>
<L>Undangerous to the <HI>Publick,</HI> ever prompt,</L>
<L>By lavish <HI>Nature</HI> thrust into your Hand:</L>
<L>And, unencumber'd with the Bulk immense</L>
<L>Of Conquest, whence huge Empires rose, and fell,</L>
<L>Self-crush'd, extend your Reign from Shore to Shore,</L>
<L>Where-e'er the Wind your high Behests can blow,</L>
<L>And fix it deep on this eternal Base.</L>
<L>For should the sliding Fabrick once give Way,</L>
<L>And on the Brink of Fate begin to nod,</L>
<L>Soon blacken'd quite, and past Recovery broke,</L>
<L>It gathers <HI>Ruin</HI> as it rowls along,</L>
<L>Steep-rushing down to that devouring Gulph,</L>
<L>Where many a mighty Empire buried lies.</L>
<L>And should the big redundant Flood of <HI>Trade,</HI></L>
<L>In which ten thousand thousand <HI>Labours</HI> join</L>
<L>Their several Currents, 'till the boundless Tide</L>
<L>Rolls in a radiant Torrent o'er the Land,</L>
<L>Fruitful of Wealth, Magnificence, and Joy,</L>
<L>Of every glittering Harvest, richer far</L>
<L>Than what <HI>Hesperian</HI> Gardens bore of old;</L>
<L>Should this bright Stream, the least inflected, point</L>
<L>Its Course another Way, o'er other Lands</L>

The <HI>various Treasure</HI> would resistless pour,</L>

<L>With all around a miserable Waste.</L>
<L>Not <HI>Egypt,</HI> were, her better Heaven, the <HI>Nile</HI></L>

<L>An <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Deluge foams amain;</L>
<L>(Whence wond'ring <HI>Fable</HI> trac'd him from the Sky)</L>

<L>Induc'd at last, by scarce-perceiv'd Degrees,</L>

<L>Sloth, Ignorance, Dejection, Flattery, Fear,</L>
