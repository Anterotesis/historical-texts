<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK, PRINCE of WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I reflect upon that ready Conde∣scension, that preventing Generosity, with which YOUR ROYAL HIGH∣NESS received the following Poem un∣der your Protection; I can alone ascribe it to the Recommendation, and Influence of the Subject. In you the Cause and Concerns of Liberty have so
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>
zealous a Patron, as entitles whatever may have the least Tendency to promote them, to the Distinction of your Favour. And who can entertain this de∣lightful Reflection, without feeling a Pleasure far superior to that of the fondest Author; and of which all true Lovers of their Country must participate? To behold the noblest Dispositions of the Prince, and of the Patriot, united: an over∣flowing Benevolence, Generosity, and Candour of Heart, joined to an enlightened Zeal for Liberty, an intimate Persuasion that on it depends the Hap∣piness and Glory both of Kings and People: to see these shining out in Public Virtues, as they have hitherto smiled in all the Social Lights and Private Accomplishments of Life, is a Prospect that cannot but inspire a general Sentiment of Satisfaction and Gladness, more easy to be felt than expressed.</P>
<P>IF the following Attempt to trace Liberty, from the first Ages down to her excellent Establishment in GREAT BRITAIN, can at all merit your Approbation,
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
and prove an Entertainment to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS; if it can in any Degree answer the Dignity of the Subject, and of the Name under which I presume to shelter it; I have my best Reward: particularly, as it affords me an Oppor∣tunity of declaring that I am, with the greatest Zeal and Respect,</P>

<L>The <HI>Muse</HI> gay-rov'd the glad <HI>Hesperian</HI> Round,</L>

<L>Ah! little thought she her returning Verse</L>

<L>And does the Mystic Veil, from mortal Beam,</L>

Involve those Eyes where every Virtue smil'd,</L>
<L>And all the FATHER'S candid Spirit shone?</L>
<L>The Light of Reason, pure, without a Cloud;</L>
<L N="10">Full of the generous Heart, the mild Regard;</L>
<L>Unblemish'd Honour, uncorrupted Faith;</L>
<L>And limpid Truth, that looks the very Soul.</L>
<L>But to the Death of mighty Nations turn'd</L>
<L>My Strain, be there absorb'd the Private Tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="15">MUSING, I lay; warm from the sacred Walks,</L>
<L>Where at each step Imagination burns:</L>
<L>Ten thousand Wonders rowling in my thought,</L>
<L>As the Great Scene of deathless deeds I tread,</L>
<L>Tread the blest Ground by more than mortals trod,</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="7"/>
Mean time wide-scatter'd round, awful, and hoar,</L>
<L>Lies a vast Monument once glorious <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>The Tomb of Empire! Ruins! that efface</L>
<L>Whate'er, of finish'd, modern Pomp can boast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">Of these Ideas full, reposing Sense</L>
<L>In slumber sunk; and Fancy's Magic hand</L>
<L>Led me anew o'er all the solemn Scene,</L>
<L>Still in the Mind's pure eye more solemn drest.</L>
<L>When strait, methought, the fair majestic POWER</L>
<L N="30">Of LIBERTY appear'd. Not, as of old,</L>
<L>Extended in her hand the Cap, and Rod,</L>
<L>Whose Slave-inlarging touch gave double life:</L>
<L>But her bright Temples bound with <HI>British</HI> Oak,</L>
<L>And Naval Honours nodded on her Brow.</L>
<L N="35">Sublime her Port. Loose o'er her Shoulder flow'd</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="8"/>
Her sea-green Robe, with Constellations gay.</L>
<L>An Island Goddess now; and her high care</L>
<L>The Queen of Isles, the Mistress of the Main.</L>
<L>My heart beat filial transport at the sight;</L>
<L N="40">And, as she mov'd to speak, th' awaken'd <HI>Muse</HI></L>
<L>Listen'd intense. A while she look'd around,</L>
<L>With mournful eye the well-known Ruins mark'd,</L>
<L>And then, her Sighs repressing, thus began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mine are these Wonders, all thou see'st is mine;</L>
<L N="45">But ah how chang'd! the falling poor Remains</L>
<L>Of what exalted once th' <HI>Ausonian</HI> Shore.</L>
<L>Look back thro' time; and from the gloom disclos'd,</L>
<L>Painting my words, behold the scatter'd Scene.</L>
<L>The Great Republick see! that glow'd sublime</L>
<L N="50">With the mixt Freedom of a thousand States;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="9"/>
Rais'd on the Thrones of Kings her Curule Chair,</L>
<L>And by her Fasces aw'd the subject World.</L>
<L>See busy Millions swarming all the Land,</L>
<L>With Cities throng'd, and teeming Culture high:</L>
<L N="55">For on her free-born Sons then Nature smil'd,</L>
<L>And pour'd the Plenty that belongs to Men.</L>
<L>Behold, the Country chearing, Villas rise,</L>
<L>In lively Prospect; by the secret lapse</L>
<L>Of Brooks now lost, and Streams renown'd in Song:</L>
<L N="60">In <HI>Umbria</HI>'s closing Vales, or on the brow</L>
<L>Of her brown Hills that breathe the scented gale:</L>
<L>On <HI>Baia</HI>'s viny coast; where peaceful Seas,</L>
<L>Fan'd by kind Zephirs, ever kiss the shore;</L>
<L>And Suns unclouded shine, and purest Air:</L>
<L N="65">Or in the spacious Neighbourhood of <HI>Rome</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="10"/>
Far-shining upwards to the <HI>Sabine</HI> Hills,</L>
<L>To <HI>Anio</HI>'s Roar, and <HI>Tibur</HI>'s Olive Shade;</L>
<L>To where <HI>Preneste</HI> lifts her airy Brow;</L>
<L>Or downwards spreading to the sunny shore,</L>
<L N="70">Wav'd from the main, where <HI>Alba</HI> draws the Breeze.</L>
<L>See distant Mountains leave their Vallies dry,</L>
<L>And o'er the proud Arcade their Tribute pour,</L>
<L>To lave Imperial <HI>Rome.</HI> For ages laid</L>
<L>Deep, massy, firm, diverging every way,</L>
<L N="75">From sea to sea, her Public Roads behold:</L>
<L>By various Nations trod, and suppliant Kings;</L>
<L>With Legions flaming, or with Triumph green.</L>
<L>Full in the Centre of these wondrous Works,</L>
<L>While Tombs of Heroes consecrate the way,</L>
<L N="80">The Pride of Earth! <HI>Rome</HI> in her Glory see!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="11"/>
Behold her Demigods, in Senate met;</L>
<L>All Head to counsel, and all Heart to act:</L>
<L>The Commonweal inspiring every Tongue</L>
<L>With fervent Eloquence, <HI>unbrib'd,</HI> and <HI>bold</HI>;</L>
<L N="85">Ere low <HI>Corruption</HI> taught the <HI>Servile Herd</HI></L>
<L>To know a <HI>Master</HI>'s voice. Astonish'd, mark</L>
<L>Her Forum, earnest, popular, and loud,</L>
<L>In trembling wonder hush'd, when the two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. J. Brutus, <HI>and</HI> Virginius.</NOTE> SIRES,</L>
<L>As they the <HI>Private Father</HI> greatly quell'd,</L>
<L N="90">Stood up the <HI>Public Fathers</HI> of the State.</L>
<L>See Justice judging there in Human Shape.</L>
<L>Hark how with Freedom's voice it thunders high,</L>
<L>Or in soft murmurs sinks to TULLY'S tongue.</L>
<L>Her Tribes, her Census see; her Generous Troops,</L>
<L N="95">Whose Pay was Glory, and whose best Reward</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="12"/>
Free for their Country and for ME to die;</L>
<L>Ere Mercenary Murder grew a Trade.</L>
<L>Mark, as the purple Triumph waves along,</L>
<L>The highest Pomp and lowest Fall of Life.</L>
<L N="100">Her Festive Games, the School of Heroes, see;</L>
<L>Her Circus, ardent with contending Youth;</L>
<L>Her Streets, her Temples, Palaces, and Baths,</L>
<L>Full of fair Forms of Beauty's eldest born,</L>
<L>And of a Race by Plastic Virtue mark'd.</L>
<L N="105">While Sculpture lives around, and <HI>Asian</HI> Hills</L>
<L>Lend their best Stores to heave the pillar'd Dome:</L>
<L>All that to <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur the soft Touch</L>
<L>Of <HI>Grecian</HI> Art can join. But Language fails</L>
<L>To paint this Sun, this Center of Mankind;</L>
<L N="110">Where every Virtue, Glory, Treasure, Art,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="13"/>
Attracted strong, in heighten'd lustre met.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Need I the Contrast mark? unjoyous View!</L>
<L>A Land in all, in Government, and Arts,</L>
<L>In Virtue, Genius, Heaven and Earth revers'd.</L>
<L N="115">Who but these far-fam'd Ruins to behold,</L>
<L>Proofs of a People, whose heroic Aims</L>
<L>Soar'd far above the little selfish sphere</L>
<L>Of doubting modern Life; who but inflam'd</L>
<L>With Classic Zeal, the consecrated Scenes</L>
<L N="120">Of Men and Deeds to trace, the Wonder, Theme,</L>
<L>And Model of Mankind; unhappy Land!</L>
<L>Would trust thy Wilds, and Cities loose of sway?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are these the Vales, that once exulting States</L>
<L>In their warm bosom fed? The Mountains these,</L>
<L N="125">On whose high-blooming sides my Sons of old</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="14"/>
I bred to Glory? These dejected Towns,</L>
<L>Sordid, and mean, where Life can scarce subsist,</L>
<L>The Scenes of Antient Opulence, and Pomp?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come! by whatever <HI>Sacred Name</HI> disguis'd,</L>
<L N="130">OPPRESSION, come! and in thy works rejoice!</L>
<L>See Nature's richest Plains to putrid Fens</L>
<L>Turn'd by thy Rage. From their unchearful bounds</L>
<L>See raz'd th' enliv'ning Village, Farm, and Seat.</L>
<L>First Rural Toil, by thy rapacious hand</L>
<L N="135">Robb'd of his poor Reward, resign'd the Plow;</L>
<L>And now he dares not turn the noxious Glebe.</L>
<L>'Tis thine intire. The lonely Swain himself,</L>
<L>Who loves at large along the grassy Downs</L>
<L>His flocks to pasture, Thine abhorrent flies.</L>
<L N="140">Far as the sickening Eye can sweep around,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="15"/>
'Tis all one Desart, desolate, and grey,</L>
<L>Graz'd by the sullen Bufalo alone;</L>
<L>And where the rank unventilated Growth</L>
<L>Of rotting Ages taints the passing Gale.</L>
<L N="145">Beneath the baleful Blast the City pines,</L>
<L>Or sinks infeebl'd, or infected burns.</L>
<L>Beneath it mourns the solitary Road,</L>
<L>Roll'd in rude Mazes o'er th' abandon'd Waste;</L>
<L>While Antient Ways, ingulph'd, are seen no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="150">Such thy dire Plains, thou <HI>Self-Destroyer!</HI> Foe</L>
<L>To Human-kind! Thy Mountains too, profuse</L>
<L>Where savage Nature blooms, seem their sad plaint</L>
<L>To raise against thy desolating Rod.</L>
<L>There on the breezy Brow, where thriving States,</L>
<L N="155">And famous Cities once, to the pleas'd Sun,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="16"/>
Far other Scenes of rising Culture spread,</L>
<L>Pale shine thy ragged Towns. Neglected round,</L>
<L>Each Harvest pines; the livid, lean Produce</L>
<L>Of heartless Labour: while thy hated Joys,</L>
<L N="160">Not proper Pleasure, lift the lazy hand.</L>
<L>Better to sink in Sloth the Woes of life,</L>
<L>Than wake their rage with unavailing Toil.</L>
<L>Hence drooping Art almost to Nature leaves</L>
<L>The rude, unguided Year. Thin wave the Gifts</L>
<L N="165">Of yellow <HI>Ceres,</HI> thin the radiant Blush</L>
<L>Of Orchard reddens in the warmest ray.</L>
<L>To weedy wildness run, no Rural Wealth,</L>
<L>(Such as Dictators fed) the Garden pours.</L>
<L>Crude the wild Olive flows, and foul the Vine;</L>
<L N="170">Nor Juice <HI>Coecubian,</HI> nor <HI>Falernian,</HI> more</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="17"/>
Streams Life, and Joy, save in the <HI>Muse</HI>'s bowl.</L>
<L>Unseconded by Art, the spinning Race</L>
<L>Draw the bright thread in vain, and idly toil.</L>
<L>In vain, forlorn in wilds, the Citron blows;</L>
<L N="175">And flowering Plants perfume the desart gale.</L>
<L>Thro' the vile hedge the tender Myrtle twines.</L>
<L>Inglorious droops the Laurel, dead to Song,</L>
<L>And long a stranger to the Heroe's brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor half thy Triumph this: cast from brute Fields</L>
<L N="180">Into the Haunts of Men thy ruthless eye.</L>
<L>There buxom Plenty never turns her horn;</L>
<L>The Grace and Virtue of exterior Life,</L>
<L>No clean Convenience reigns; even Sleep itself,</L>
<L>Least delicate of Powers, reluctant there</L>
<L N="185">Lays on the Bed impure his heavy head.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="18"/>
Thy horrid Walk! dead, empty, unadorn'd,</L>
<L>See Streets whose Echos never know the voice</L>
<L>Of chearful Hurry, Commerce many-tongue'd,</L>
<L>And Art mechanic at his various task</L>
<L N="190">Fervent employ'd. Mark the desponding Race,</L>
<L>Of Occupation void, as void of Hope;</L>
<L>Hope the glad Ray, glanc'd from ETERNAL GOOD,</L>
<L>That Life enlivens, and exalts it's Powers,</L>
<L>With views of Fortune—Madness all to them!</L>
<L N="195">By Thee relentless seiz'd their better Joys,</L>
<L>To the soft aid of cordial Airs they fly,</L>
<L>A kind Oblivion breathing o'er their Woes,</L>
<L>And Love and Music melt their Souls away.</L>
<L>From feeble <HI>Justice</HI> see how rash <HI>Revenge,</HI></L>
<L N="200">Trembling, the Ballance snatches; and her Sword,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="19"/>
Fearful himself, to venal Ruffians gives.</L>
<L>See where GOD'S Altar nursing Murder stands,</L>
<L>With the red touch of dark Assassins stain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chief let <HI>Rome,</HI> the mighty City! speak</L>
<L N="205">The full-exerted Genius of thy Reign.</L>
<L>Behold Her rise amid the lifeless Waste,</L>
<L>Expiring Nature all corrupted round;</L>
<L>While the lone <HI>Tyber,</HI> thro' the desart Shore,</L>
<L>Winds his waste stores, and sullen sweeps along.</L>
<L N="210">Patch'd from my Fragments, in unsolid Pomp,</L>
<L>Mark how the Temple glares; and, artful drest,</L>
<L>Amusive draws the superstitious Train.</L>
<L>Mark how the Palace lifts a lying front,</L>
<L>Concealing often, in magnific Jail,</L>
<L N="215">Proud Want, a deep unanimated Gloom!</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="20"/>
And often joining to the drear abode</L>
<L>Of Misery, whose melancholy walls</L>
<L>Seem its voracious Grandeur to reproach.</L>
<L>Within the City Bounds, the Desart see.</L>
<L N="220">See the rank Vine o'er subterranean roofs,</L>
<L>Indecent, spread; beneath whose fretted gold</L>
<L>It once exulting flow'd. The People mark,</L>
<L>Matchless, while fir'd by me; to Public Good</L>
<L>Inexorably firm, just, generous, brave,</L>
<L N="225">Afraid of nothing but unworthy Life,</L>
<L>Elate with Glory, an Heroic Soul</L>
<L>Known to the Vulgar Breast: behold them now</L>
<L>A thin despairing Number, all subdu'd,</L>
<L>The Slaves of Slaves, by Superstition fool'd,</L>
<L N="230">By Vice unman'd and a licentious Rule,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="21"/>
In Guile ingenious, and in Murder brave.</L>
<L>Such in one Land, beneath the same fair Clime,</L>
<L>Thy Sons, OPPRESSION, are; and such were MINE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Even with thy labour'd <HI>State,</HI> for whose vain show</L>
<L N="235">Deluded Thousands starve; all age-begrim'd,</L>

<L>And by the Tempest of two thousand Years</L>

<L>These Roads that yet the <HI>Roman</HI> hand assert,</L>
<L N="240">Beyond the weak repair of modern Toil;</L>
<L>These fractur'd Arches, that the chiding Stream</L>

<L N="405">The striking Force, the Lightning of thy Thought,</L>

And thy strong Phrase, that rowls profound, and clear;</L>
<L>Oh gracious GODDESS! reinspire my Song:</L>
