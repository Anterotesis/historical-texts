<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in GOD
<HI>FRANCIS,</HI>
Lord Bishop of St. ASAPH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F the <HI>Convocation</HI> had been sit∣ting,
I would have made this
Dedication to them, and
humbly implored of them,
what, for their Love to the Fathers,
they would readily have granted, a
Recommendation of these my <HI>Discourses</HI>
on <HI>Miracles</HI> to the <HI>Clergy</HI>: But being
unhappily disappointed of a Session of
that <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>Learned</HI> Body, for
whose wise Debates and orthodox Votes
I have such a Veneration, as is not to
be express'd in a few Words, I pre∣sently
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
turn'd my Thoughts on your
<HI>Lordship,</HI> to whom a <HI>Dedication</HI> is due,
because of your Respect, often declared,
for the Authority of the Fathers, which
induces me to think, you now approve
of the Use I have made of them.</P>
<P>But what I am here to applaud your
<HI>Lordship</HI> for, is, your <HI>Discourse</HI> call'd
<HI>Difficulties and Discouragements,</HI> &amp;c.
That admirable Satire against modern
Orthodoxy and Persecution! How was
I tickled in the Perusal of it! It is
plainly the Sense of your Soul, or you
had set your Name to it: And if the
Temptation of Praise for it, had not
been too great to be resisted, I could
have wish'd you had always conceal'd
your self; and then you had not writ∣ten
against the Grain, an aukward Piece
on <HI>Church Power,</HI> like a Retractation,
to reingratiate your self with some Ec∣clesiastical
<HI>Noodles,</HI> whom you no
more, than I, need to care for.</P>
<P>I have sometimes wondered, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> where and when the Great Mr.
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
<HI>Grounds</HI> imbibed his notable Notions
about Religion and Liberty; for he
suck'd them not in with his Mothers
Milk, who, I suppose, train'd him up
in the Belief of Christianity: But when
I consider'd, that he was once the <HI>Pupil</HI>
of Mr. <HI>Hare</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> my wonder
ceas'd. Under your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Tui∣tion,
it seems he laid the Foundation
of his distinguish'd Learning and Opi∣nions!
His Pupillage will be your im∣mortal
Honour! I wonder, none of the
Writers against him have as yet cele∣brated
your Praise for it! How does he
imitate and resemble his <HI>Tutor</HI> in Princi∣ples!
I can't say, he surpasses you, since
there is such a Freedom of Thought and
Expression in your <HI>Difficulties,</HI> &amp;c. so
strongly savouring of Infid<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ty, that
he has not as yet equall'd.</P>
<P>Upon your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Advancement
to a Bishoprick, <HI>Difficultys and Dis∣couragements</HI>
not withstanding, I wish'd,
without prescribing to the Wisdom of
the Government in the choice of a
learned Prelate, that the great Mr.
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
<HI>Grounds,</HI> for the good of the Church
too, might be soon consecrated: And
I should not have despair'd of it, but
that he's a Gentleman of real Probity
and Conscience, and might possibly
boggle at Subscriptions, unless you and
Bishop <HI>Hoadly</HI> could help him to some
of your <HI>Reserves</HI> and <HI>Distinctions,</HI>
wherewith you must be both well
Stock'd, to overcome that <HI>Difficulty.</HI>
And why should not <HI>Dean Swift</HI> for his
Writings, as well as some others, be
made a Bishop? I should like to see
him one; if the <HI>then</HI> Right Reverend
Bishop <HI>Grounds</HI> would not think him,
for his <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> too loose in
the Faith, for his Company.</P>
<P>Don't imagine, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that I am
forming of Schemes for my self to be a
Bishop. Tho these my <HI>Discourses</HI> on
<HI>Miracles</HI> are of very great Merit, as
well as your Lordship's <HI>Difficulties,</HI> &amp;c.
yet you may be assured, I have no such
View, when I tell you, that the Ho∣nour,
the Fathers have exalted me to,
of a <HI>Moderator</HI> in this Controversy,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
sets me above all Ecclesiastical Pre∣ferment,
excepting the <HI>Arch-Bishoprick</HI>
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> which I'm afraid will be
void, before the King is apprised of
my singular Worth and Qualifications
for it.</P>
<P>But however, if such excellent <HI>Pre∣lates,</HI>
as <HI>Grounds, Hoadly, Swift, Hare</HI>
and <HI>my self</HI> were at the Head of Eccle∣siastical
Affairs, what would we do?
What should we not do? What would
not this free-thinking Age expect from
us? Nothing less, than that, according
to our Principles, we should endeavour
to set Mankind at perfect Liberty, and
to lay open the dirty Fences of the
Church, call'd Subscriptions, which
are not only the Stain of a good Con∣science,
but the <HI>Discouragements,</HI> your
<HI>Lordship</HI> hints at, in the Study of the
Scriptures: And if we made a Push
for an Act of P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t to turn the <HI>Clergy</HI>
to Grass, after King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's
Monks and Fryars; where would be
the Harm of it? Nay, the Advantage
to the Publick, as well as to Religion,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
would be great, if their Revenues were
apply'd to the Payment of National
Debts; with a Reserve to our selves
(remember, <HI>My Lord</HI>) of large Emolu∣ments
out of them, according to our
great Merits; otherwise worldly-wise
Men will repute us impolitick Fools,
which you and Bishop <HI>Hoadly,</HI> I humbly
presume, will never endure the Re∣proach
of.</P>
<P>So, hoping your Lordship will accept
of this Dedication to your Praise, in as
much Sincerity as it is written, I sub∣scribe
myself,</P>

Discouragements,

<HEAD>A FOURTH
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OW for a <HI>fourth</HI> Discourse on
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, which, as be∣fore,
I begin with a Repetition
of the three general Heads, at
first proposed to be treated on;
and they are,</P>
<P N="1">I. To show, that the Miracles of heal∣ing
all manner of bodily Diseases, which
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> was famed for, are none of the pro∣per
Miracles of the <HI>Messiah</HI>; neither are
they so much as a good Proof of his di∣vine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove that the literal History of
many of the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as record∣ed
by the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> does imply Absur∣dities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities;
consequently they, either in the whole
or in part, were never wrought, as it is
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives, of what would be mysteriously,
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. To consider what <HI>Jesus</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to a
Testimony and Witness of his divine
Power; and to show that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to those he
then wrought in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to the my∣stical
ones, he would do in the Spirit; of
which those wrought in the Flesh are but
mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>I am upon the second of these Heads,
and according to it, have, in my <HI>former
Discourses,</HI> taken into examination <HI>eight</HI>
of the Miracles of <HI>Jesus, viz.</HI> those:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel∣lers
out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of his exorcising the <HI>Devils</HI> out of
the Mad-men, and sending them into the
Herd of Swine.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had
an Issue of Blood, twelve Years.</P>
<P N="5">5. Of his curing a Woman that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of his telling the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman,
her fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adulteress with another
Man.</P>
<P N="7">7. Of his cursing the Fig-tree for not
bearing Fruit out of season. And,</P>
<P N="8">8. Of his healing a Man of an Infirmity
at the Pool of <HI>Bethesda.</HI></P>
<P>Whether it be not manifest, that the
Literal and Evangelical Story of these
Miracles, from what I have argu'd and rea∣son'd
upon them, does not consist of Ab∣surdities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibi∣lities,
according to the Proposition before
us, let my Readers judge; and so I come to
the Consideration of</P>
<P N="9">9. A ninth Miracle of <HI>Jesus, viz.</HI> that
 <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">John ix.</NOTE> of his giving sight to a Man who was
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
born blind, by the means of Eye-salve,
made of Dirt and Spittle.</P>
<P>Blindness, as far as one may guess by
the Evangelical History, was the Distem∣per
that <HI>Jesus</HI> frequently exercis'd his
Power on: And there is no doubt to be
made, but he heal'd many of one Weak∣ness,
Defect and Imperfection, or other in
their Eyes; but whether he wrought any
Miracle upon any, he is supposed to have
cured, is uncertain. There are, as it's no∣torious,
many kinds of Blindness, that are
incurable by Art or Nature; and there are
other kinds of it, that Nature and Art
will relieve a Man in. But whether <HI>Jesus</HI>
used his healing Power against the former,
as well as the latter sort of Blindness, is
more than can be affirm'd, or at least proved
by our <HI>Divines.</HI> And unless we knew of
a certainty, that the sore or blind Eyes,
<HI>Jesus</HI> cured, were absolutely out of the
reach of Art and Nature; <HI>Infidels</HI> will
imagine, and suggest, that he was only
Master of a good Ointment for sore Eyes,
and being successful in the use of it, igno∣rant
People would needs think, he wrought
Miracles.</P>
<P>The World is often bless'd with excel∣lent
<HI>Oculists,</HI> who thro' Study and Prac∣tice
have attain'd to wonderful Skill in
Eye-Maladies, which, tho they are of va∣rious
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
sorts, yet, by Custom of Speech,
all pass under the general Name of <HI>Blind∣ness.</HI>
And sometimes we hear of famous
<HI>Chance-Doctors,</HI> like <HI>Jesus,</HI> who by a Gift
of God, Nature, or Fortune, without any
Skill in the Structure of the Eyes, have
been very successful in the Cure of one
Distemper or other incident to them: Such
was Sir <HI>William Read,</HI> who, tho no Scho∣lar,
nor of acquir'd Abilities in <HI>Physick</HI> and
<HI>Surgery,</HI> yet cured his Thousands of sore
or blind Eyes; and many of them too to
the surprise and astonishment of profess'd
<HI>Surgeons</HI> and <HI>Physicians.</HI> Whether He, or
<HI>Jesus,</HI> cured the greater number of Blind∣ness
may be question'd. To please our
<HI>Divines,</HI> it shall be granted that <HI>Jesus</HI> cu∣red
the greater Numbers; but that he cu∣red
worse or more difficult Distempers in
the Eyes, can't be proved. Sir <HI>William</HI>
indeed met with many Cases of blind and
sore Eyes, that were out of the reach of
his Power; and so did <HI>Jesus</HI> too, or he had
never let great Multitudes of the blind, and
otherwise distemper'd People, go unheal'd
by him. Our <HI>Divines</HI> will here say, that
it was never want of Power in <HI>Jesus,</HI> but
want of Faith in the diseased, if he did
not heal them; but in other <HI>Surgeons</HI> and
<HI>Physicians,</HI> it is confessedly their own In∣sufficiency:
To which I have only this
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
Answer, that our <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Surgeons</HI>
are to be commended for their Ingenuity,
to impute it to their own Defect of Power,
and not to lay the Blame upon their Pa∣tients,
when they can't cure them: And
it is lucky for us Christians, that we have
<HI>this Salvo</HI> for the Credit of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s mi∣raculously
healing Power, that it was not
fit, he should exert it against Unbelief;
otherwise, reasonably speaking, He, with
Sir <HI>William Read, Greatrex, Vespasian,</HI>
our former <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Seventh-Sons,</HI>
must have pass'd but for a <HI>Chance-Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the particular Considera∣tion
of the Miracle before us. <HI>Jesus</HI> re∣stored,
it seems, a blind Man to his Eye-sight,
by the use of a peculiar Ointment,
and washing of his Eyes, as directed, in
the Pool of <HI>Siloam.</HI> Where lies the Mi∣racle?
I can't see it; but hope our <HI>Di∣vines</HI>
will take their opportunity to point
it out to me. Our <HI>Surgeons</HI> with their
Ointments and Washings can cure sore
and blind Eyes of one sort or other; and
<HI>Jesus</HI> did no more here; and yet he must
be reckon'd a Worker of Miracles; and they,
but artificial Operators: where's the Sense
and Reason of this difference between
them? If Mr. <HI>Moor,</HI> the <HI>Apothecary,</HI> for
the notable Cures he performs, by the
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
means of his Medicines, should write him∣self,
and be accounted by his Admirers, a
<HI>Miracle-worker</HI>; he and they would be
but laugh'd at for it: And yet <HI>Jesus</HI> for
his curing the sore Eyes of a poor Man
with an Ointment, must be had in ve∣neration
for a divine and miraculous Ope∣rator,
as much as if by the breath of his
Mouth, he had removed an huge Moun∣tain!</P>
<P>A Miracle, if I mistake not the Notion
of our <HI>Divines</HI> about it, is a supernatural
Event, or a Work out of the Power of Na∣ture
or Art to effect. And when it is spo∣ken
of the Cure of a Disease, as of Blind∣ness
or Lameness, it ought to be so repre∣sented,
as that skilful and experienced <HI>Sur∣geons</HI>
and <HI>Physicians,</HI> who can do strange
and surprizing Cures by Art, may give it
upon their Judgment, that no Skill of
Man could reach that Operation; but that
it ought to pass for the Work of a divine
and almighty Hand and Power: But
there is no such care taken in the De∣scription
of any of the Diseases, which
<HI>Jesus</HI> cured; much less of this before us;
against the miraculousness of which, con∣sequently,
there are these two Exceptions
to be made:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That we know nothing of the
Nature of this poor Man's Blindness; nor
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
what was the defect of his Eyes; nor whe∣ther
it was curable by Art or not: With∣out
which Knowledge, it is impossible and
unreasonable to assert, that there was a
Miracle wrought in the Cure of him. If
his blindness or weakness of Eye-sight
was curable by human means, and Jesus
did use those means, there's an end of the
Miracle. If the <HI>Evangelist</HI> had given us
an accurate Description of the Condition
of this Man's Eyes before Cure, we could
have judg'd better: But this is their con∣stant
neglect in all the Distempers <HI>Jesus</HI>
heal'd, and is enough to induce us to doubt
of his miraculous Power. There are, as I
have said, some sorts of sore or blind Eyes
curable by Art, as Experience does testify;
and there are others incurable, as <HI>Physi∣cians</HI>
and <HI>Patients</HI> do lament. Of which
sort this Man's was, we know not. The
worst that we know of his Case, is, that
he was blind from his Birth, or Infancy,
which might be; and yet Time, Nature
and Art, may give relief to him. As a
Man advances in Years, the diseases of
Childhood and Youth wear off. What we
call the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> or an Inflamation in
the Eyes, in time will abate of its Malig∣nity.
Nature will not only by degrees
work the Cure it-self, but the seasonable
help of a good <HI>Oculist</HI> will soon expedite
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
it, tho in time of Infancy he could be of
no use. And who knows but this might
be the Case of this blind Man, whose
Cure <HI>Jesus</HI> by his Art did only hasten
and help forward. However, there are
Grounds enough to suspect, that it was
not divine Power which heal'd this Man,
or <HI>Jesus</HI> had never prepared and order'd
an <HI>Ointment</HI> and <HI>Wash</HI> for him.</P>
<P>Should our <HI>Divines</HI> suppose or de∣scribe,
for the <HI>Evangelist,</HI> a state of
Blindness in this Man, incurable by Art;
that would be begging the Question,
which no Unbeliever will grant. But
to please them, I will yield, without
Enquiry into the Nature of this Man's
Blindness, that, if <HI>Jesus</HI> had used no
Medicines; if with only a word of his
Mouth he had cured the Man, and he
had instantaneously recover'd, as the Word
was spoken; here would have been a
real and great Miracle, let the Blindness
or Imperfection of the Man's Sight be∣fore,
be of what kind or degree soever.
But <HI>Jesus</HI>'s use of Washings and Oint∣ments
absolutely spoils and destroys the
Credit of the Miracle, and we ought
by no means to ascribe <HI>that</HI> to the im∣mediate
Hand and Power of God, which
<HI>Medicines</HI> and <HI>Balsams</HI> are apply'd to the
Effect of. And this brings me to the</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17"/>
<HI>Second</HI> Exception against the miracu∣lousness
of the Cure of this blind Man,
which is, that <HI>Jesus</HI> used human means
for the Cure of him; which means,
whether they were at all proper and ef∣fectual
in themselves, do affect the Credit
of the Miracle, and give occasion of sus∣picion,
that it was Art and not divine
Power that heal'd him, or <HI>Jesus,</HI> for
his Honour, had never had recourse to
the use of them. And what were those
Means, or that Medicine, which <HI>Jesus</HI>
made use of? Why, "He spit upon the
Ground, and made a Balsam of Dirt
and Spittle, and anointed the poor
Man's Eyes with it, and he recover'd."
A strange and odd sort of an Ointment,
that I believe was never used before, nor
since, for sore and blind Eyes! I am
not Student enough in <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Sur∣gery</HI>
to account for the natural and ra∣tional
use of this Balsam; but wish that
skilful Professors of those Sciences would
help me out at this difficulty. If they
could rationally account for the use of
this Eye-salve, tho it was by supposing,
that Jesus imperceptibly had in his Mouth
a proper unctuous and balsamick Sub∣stance,
which he dissolv'd into Spittle,
they would do great service to a certain
Cause; and I wonder none of them,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
whether well or ill affected to Religion,
have as yet bent their Thoughts to it.</P>
<P>In the Practice of <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI>
there are sometimes very odd and un∣accountable
Medicaments made use of;
and now-and-then very whimsical and
seemingly ridiculous ones, by old Women,
to good Purpose: But none of them are
to be compared to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Balsam for
sore Eyes. I have heard of a merry
<HI>Mountebank</HI> of Distinction, whose ca∣tholick
Medicine was <HI>Hasty-Pudding,</HI>
which indeed is a notable Remedy against
the <HI>Esuriency</HI> of the Stomach, that the
Poor often labour under. But <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Eye-Salve, for absurdity, whim, and in∣congruity,
was never equall'd, either in
jest or in earnest, by any <HI>Quack-Doctor.</HI>
Whether <HI>Infidels</HI> think of this Ointment
of the Holy <HI>Jesus</HI> with a smile; or re∣flect
on it with disdain, I can't guess.
As to myself, I should think with St.
<HI>Chrysostom</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Quid Lutum illinere oportet? hoc potius caecum reddere, quis unquam hoc pacto curatus est? <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> , that this Eye-Salve of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
would sooner put a Man's Eyes out,
than restore a blind one to his Sight. And
I believe that our <HI>Divines,</HI> for the Cre∣dit
of the Miracle, and our <HI>Surgeons,</HI>
for the Honour of their Science, will
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
agree, that it could not be naturally ope∣rative
and effective of the Cure of the
blind Man.</P>
<P>What then was the Reason of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
using this strange Eye-Salve, when, for
the sake of the Miracle, and for the ho∣nour
of his own Power, he should have
cured the Man with a word speaking?
This is a Question and Objection in St.
<HI>Cyril</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Quam ob causam dicet aliquis, cum omnia solo Verbo praestare possit, nulloque negotio, Lutum quidem sputo macerat? <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> against Ministers of the Letter,
who are obliged to give an Answer to it,
that will consist with the Wisdom and
Power of <HI>Jesus,</HI> otherwise they must
give up the Miracle, or make him a
vain insignificant and trifling Agent. St.
<HI>Cyril,</HI> of whose mind I am, says <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Sed Rationem quandam mysticam habet Vis Rei istius de sputo. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> that
the Reason of the use of this Balsam
made of Dirt and Spittle is to be fetch'd
from the Mystery. But, in as much as
our <HI>Divines</HI> will never agree to that,
which would be of ill Consequence to
their Ministry, they must give a good
Reason of their own, which I despair of
seeing, that will comport with the Let∣ter.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20"/>
St. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> too, says <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ei autem qui caecus fuerat a Nativitate, jam non per sermonem sed per operationem praestitit visum; non vanè, neque prout evenit, hoc faciens, sed ut osten∣eret manum Dei, eam quae ab initio plasmavit Homi∣nem, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Contra Haeres. L. v. c. 15.</NOTE> , that the <HI>Clay
and Spittle</HI> was of no service to the Cure
of the blind Man; and yet <HI>Jesus</HI> did
not use it <HI>in vain.</HI> Is not this an In∣consistency?
How will our <HI>Divines</HI> ad∣just
it? With <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> I am sure they'll
not mystically solve the Difficulty; there∣fore
if they don't provide another So∣lntion
of it to satisfaction, either their
Ministry of the Letter, or the Reputa∣tion
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and this Miracle, must
suffer for it.</P>
<P>I am puzzled to think, how our
<HI>Divines</HI> will extricate themselves out of
this Strait, and account for the use of
this Eye-Slave, without any Diminution
of the Miracle. Surely, they will not
say that <HI>Jesus</HI> used this sensless and in∣significant
Ointment to put a <HI>Slur</HI> upon
the Practice of <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI> as if
other Medicines were of no more avail
than his <HI>Dirt</HI> and <HI>Spittle.</HI> They have
more wit than to say so; least it in∣cense
a noble and most useful Profession,
not so much against themselves, as a∣gainst
<HI>Jesus,</HI> and provoke them to a
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
nicer and stricter Enquiry than I can
make into his Miracles, the Diseases he
cured, and his manner of Operation;
and to infer from thence, that he
could be no miraculous Healer of Dis∣eases
who used Medicines; nor his <HI>Evan∣gelists</HI>
orthodox at Theology, who were
so inexpert at Anatomy and the Descrip∣tion
of bodily Distempers. This might
be of bad Consequence to Religion: And
yet I wonder that none of them, who
may be supposed a little disaffected to
Christianity, have taken the Hint from
this pretended Miracle before us, and some
others, to endeavour at a Proof of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
being little better than a <HI>Quack-Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>If I was, what I am not, an <HI>Infidel,</HI>
I should think, from the Letter of this
Story, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was a <HI>juggling Impos∣tor,</HI>
who would pass for a miraculous
Healer of Diseases, tho he used under∣hand,
proper Medicines. The <HI>Clay and
the Spittle</HI> he made an open shew of, as
what, to Admiration, he would cure the
blind Man with; but in reserve he had
a more sanative Balsam, that he subtilly
slip't in the room of the Clay, and re∣peatedly
to good purpose anointed the
Man's Eyes with it. But as the Autho∣rity
of the Fathers, and their mystical
Interpretation of this Story, is alone my
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
safe-guard against such an ill opinion of
<HI>Jesus</HI>; so I would now gladly know
upon what Bottom the Faith of our
<HI>Divines</HI> can stand, as to this Miracle, and
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s divine Power in it.</P>
<P>I have perused some of our <HI>Commen∣tators</HI>
on the Place, and don't perceive
that they hesitate at this strange Eye-Salve;
nor make any Questions about
the pertinent or impertinent Use of it.
Whether it is, that they sleep over the
Story, or are aware of greater Difficultys
in it, than can be easily surmounted, and
therefore dare not touch on't, I know
not. But now that we enjoy Liberty
of Debate, which will make us Philo∣sophers,
and I have taken the Freedom
to make a stricter Scrutiny than ordinary
into <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, and to consider what
absurditys, their Storys, and <HI>this</HI> in par∣ticular,
are clog'd with; it is incumbent
on our <HI>Divines</HI> to answer solidly these
Questions, <HI>viz.</HI> What was the Reason
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Use of this Eye-Salve made
of Clay and Spittle? Whether, if it was
of service to the Cure of the blind Man,
it does not destroy the Miracle? And if
it had no Effect in the Cure of him,
whether <HI>Jesus</HI> was not a <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>trifling</HI>
Operator, making use of insignificant and
impertinent Medicines to the Diminution
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
of his divine Power? These Questions
are not ludicrous, but <HI>calm and sedate
Reasoning,</HI> which <HI>Bishop Smalbroke</HI> <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See his Sermon before the Societys for Reformation, <HI>p.</HI> 12.</NOTE> 
does not disapprove of. Therefore a grave,
rational, and substantial Answer is expec∣ted
to them, such as will be a Vindi∣cation
of the Wisdom and Power of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> without any Diminution of the
Miracle.</P>
<P>Should our <HI>Divines</HI> say, that this
Matter was an Act of unsearchable
Wisdom, and must be left to the Will
of our Saviour, and not curiously pry'd
into, any more than some other Dis∣pensations
of Providence, that are past
finding out: This Answer, which I be∣lieve
to be the best, that can be given,
will not do here. The Miracles of
<HI>Jesus</HI> are, as our <HI>Divines</HI> own, Appeals
to our Reason and Senses for his Autho∣rity;
and by our Reason and Senses they
are to be try'd, condemn'd or approved
of. If they will not abide the test of
Reason and Sense, they are to be rejec∣ted,
and <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Authority along with
them. Therefore a more close, pertinent
and serious Answer is to be given to the
said Questions; which as I believe to
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
be impossible, consistently with the Let∣ter;
so our <HI>Divines</HI> must of necessity go
along with me to the Fathers for a mys∣tical
and allegorical Interpretation of the
Story of this Eye-Salve; or the Miracle
will fall to the Ground, and <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
divine Power be in great danger with
it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> (who is one of <HI>Bishop Smal∣broke</HI>'s
Greek Commentators, that should
strictly adhere to the Letter) signifies,
as I before observ'd, that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Use of
this Clay and Spittle would be an Ab∣surdity,
if it was not to be accounted for,
from the Mystery.</P>
<P><HI>Eusebius Gallicanus,</HI> treating on this
Miracle, says <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ipse Salvator noster apertissime ostendit, quod ejus Miracula aliquid significent; dum ea faciendo, ali∣vuid agit, quod Ratione carere videatur. Nisi enim aliquid significaret, quid necessarium fuit, in hujus caeci Illuminatione, ut Lutum faceret, quo oculos ejus lini∣ret, cui solum dicere sufficiens erat.

apparently manifests that his Miracles
are of a spiritual and mystical Signifi∣cation,
because in the Work of them,
he does somewhat or other, that lite∣rally
has no Sense nor Reason in it.
As for Instance, in the Cure of this
blind Man, what occassion was there
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
for <HI>Clay and Spittle</HI> to anoint his Eyes,
if it was not of a mystical meaning,
when with a Word of his Mouth,
<HI>Jesus</HI> could have cured him? Let us
then set aside the Letter of the Story,
and search for the Mystery, and con∣sider
who is meant by this blind
Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>Origen</HI> too, upon occasion of this
Miracle, and its Absurdity according to
the Letter, says <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Similitudo erat &amp; Typus futurorum unumquodque quod fiebat in Corpore. Veluti nescio quis à Nativitate caecus Visum recuperavit.

allegorical Interpretation of this <HI>Clay</HI> and
<HI>Spittle</HI> of our Lord; but as it is hard to
apprehend his meaning, I shall not here
insist on it. <HI>Origen</HI> says <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Saliva sua ungens Oculos caeci &amp; mittens ad <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>am</HI> quod interpretatur <HI>Missus,</HI> mittebat quippe illos, quos spiritu unxit, &amp;c. <HI>In Isai. c.</HI> vi.</NOTE> , that the

<HI>Spittle,</HI> is to be understood of the Unc∣tion

does not give us rightly to understand
the Metaphor and Figure. St. <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> says, that by the <HI>Clay</HI> and <HI>Spit∣tle</HI>
is meant <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Saliva est perfecta Doctrina. <HI>In Marc.</HI> c. viii.</NOTE> <HI>perfect Doctrine,</HI> which

without departing from their Opinions,
by the <HI>Spittle</HI> of Jesus must be under∣stood
the <HI>Water</HI> of the Spirit instill'd into
the <HI>Earth</HI> of the Letter of the Scriptures,
which temper'd together, does, in the
Judgment of them all, make <HI>perfect Doc∣trine</HI>
to the opening of the Eyes of our
Understanding in the Knowledge of the
Providence of God of all Ages; which
Knowledge, Light, Sight, or Illumination,

mystical Reason, by himself, for the use
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
of this Ointment of <HI>Clay</HI> and <HI>Spittle,</HI> to
the Cure of this blind Man, which I
shall not stay to illustrate, but only have
cited it for the Meditation of the Lear∣ned
and Curious.</P>
<P>The Story of the blind Man, as St.
<HI>John</HI> has related it, is long, and would
take up more time, than I have to spare
at present, to go thro' all the Parts of
it. What I have done at present is e∣nough
to awaken others to the Consi∣deration,
not only of the Absurdities of
the Letter, but of the mystical Inter∣pretation
of the rest.</P>
<P N="10">The Miracle, which consisted literally
in the Cure of a blind Man by the use
of an Ointment made of <HI>Dirt</HI> and <HI>Spit∣tle,</HI>
is absurd, sensless and unaccountable;
but in the Mystery, there is Wisdom
and Reason. And the Cure of Mankind
of the Blindness of his Understanding,
by the <HI>Spirit</HI>'s being temper'd with the
<HI>Letter</HI> of the Scriptures, which is the
mystical <HI>Eye-Salve,</HI> will not only be a most
stupendous Miracle, but a Proof of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
<HI>Messiahship</HI> beyond all contradiction, in
as much as by such an opening of the
Eyes of our Understandings, which have
been hitherto dark, we shall see, how
he is the Accomplishment of the Law
and the Prophets. And so I pass to a
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
10. Tenth Miracle of Jesus, <HI>viz.</HI> <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">John ii.</NOTE> 
<HI>That of his turning Water into Wine, at
a Marriage in</HI> Cana <HI>of</HI> Galilee. This
is call'd the beginning of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Mira∣cles;
but whether it is to be understood
of the <HI>First</HI> of his whole Life, or of the
<HI>First</HI> that he wrought in <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI>
is not agreed amongst <HI>Divines.</HI> I shall
not enter into the Dispute, which as it
is of no Consequence to my Cause in
hand; so I shall pass it by, and not
urge any Arguments for or against either
side of it.</P>
<P>Tho I would not for the World be
so impious and profane as to believe,
what is contain'd and imply'd in the
Letter of this Story; yet I am still too
grave to handle it as ludicrously as I
ought; and it is now against the grain,
that I write so freely as I shall against
it, being unwilling, not only to put the
<HI>Clergy</HI> out of all Temper, but, to give
<HI>Scoffers</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> so great an Advan∣tage
against their Ministry of the Letter.
Some may wonder that I, who have
gone so far in the ludicrous display of
the gross Absurdities of some other Mi∣racles,
should boggle at this. But to be
ingenuous, and speak the Truth sincerely,
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
I am still a Christian (for all what
the <HI>Bishop</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s, <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">See his Speech in Convocation, printed in the <HI>Post-Boy</HI> of <HI>March</HI> the 30th.</NOTE> <HI>Arch∣deacon
Stubbs,</HI> and others would make of
me) upon the Principles of the Fathers,
and have a greater Veneration for the
Person of the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI> than to be for∣ward
to make such sport with him, his Mo∣ther,
and his Disciples, as this Story affords
Scope for. And if it was not for the necessi∣ty
of turning the <HI>Clergy</HI>'s Heads to the Con∣sideration
of Mysterys, this Miracle should
have been pass'd by in silence.</P>
<P>There were some antiently, whom St.
<HI>Chrysostom</HI> <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Rursus hoc in loco calumniantur nonnulli hunc ebriosorum fuisse Conventum, <HI>&amp;c. In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> writes of, whether <HI>Jews,</HI>
<HI>Gentiles,</HI> or <HI>Hereticks,</HI> I know not, who
took great offence at the Story of this
Wedding, accounting it, from what is re∣lated
in St. <HI>John,</HI> as a riotous Feast,
and that <HI>Jesus</HI> and his Mother, and his
Disciples, not only bore a part in the
Revellings, but were most to blame for
them; or he should not have countenanced
them with his Presence, much less pro∣moted
them, by the Change of a large
quantity of Water into Wine for the use
of a Company, who were already <HI>drunk</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
with it. But I, with St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> am
inclined to believe, that, if <HI>Jesus</HI> did
grace this Wedding with his Presence,
there was no Excess encouraged, or so
much as suffer'd at it. If he did accept
of the Invitation of the Bridegroom, it
was for an opportunity, not so much to
turn <HI>Water</HI> into <HI>Wine,</HI> as to make a pro∣per
Discourse to the People of conjugal
Duties; and, as he was a searcher of the
Hearts, secretly to admonish the Married
of the Sin and Mischief of Adultery;
tho we read not of a seasonable and
good Word spoken at it.</P>
<P>And the Empress <HI>Eudocia,</HI> a nursing
Mother of the Church, has given us a
Poetical, and I hope a fictitious Descrip∣tion
of this Wedding. She makes a
sumptuous and voluptuous Feast of it;
and writes <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Pueri aut Saltatores volutabantur, in his autem Tibiae, Lyraeque Vocem habebant. Mulieres autem Cantum accipientes, volvebantur per medias Quaecunque optimatum erant uxores atque filiae. Ill vero ad Saltationem &amp; desiderabilem Cantum Conversi delectabantur, &amp;c. In <HI>Homero-Centon. Empress</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Musick</HI> and <HI>Dancing</HI>
in abundance, enough to make us think
of such Mirth and Pastime here, as was
unbecoming of a Company of Saints to
be present at. Whether it was, that this
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
<HI>Empress,</HI> being only accustom'd to the
Excesses of a Court, could form no mea∣ner
Conceptions of a Country Wedding;
or whether she had any extra-scriptural
Authority for what she writ, I know
not: But I believe, that, if <HI>Jesus</HI> was at
all at a Marriage-Feast, the whole was
conducted with Decency, Order, and So∣briety;
and if he there wrought any
Miracle, it was to manifest his Glory,
to the Conversion of some, and Confir∣mation
of the Faith of others.</P>
<P>And our <HI>Translators</HI> of the <HI>Bible</HI> too
have given occasion to suspect some∣what
of Excess at this Wedding; or
they need not have made the Waterpots
to hold two or three Firkins apiece. If
I had been the Translator, they should
not have held above two or three <HI>Pints</HI>
apiece, which Measure is as agreeable to
the Original as <HI>Firkin</HI>; neither can I
imagine, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> if he did convert
Water into Wine, would do it in so
large a Measure, for fear of an intempe∣rate
abuse of it, but only gave the Com∣pany
a cast of his miraculous Power,
and a little taste of his Love and Good∣will
to them.</P>
<P>Such are the Conceptions, that, to the
Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> I am willing to form
of this <HI>Wedding</HI>; and wish that the
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
Letter of the Story did suggest no worse
Thoughts of it to us. I should be pleas'd,
if no <HI>Infidel</HI> really could, what I, but
for the sake of the Mystery most un∣willingly
should, write any ludicrous
Descants on it. But if this Story had
been related of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> as
it is of our <HI>Jesus,</HI> I would have ridi∣cul'd
and satiriz'd it to the utmost of
my Power, and have render'd him and
his Disciples of all Nations, as contemp∣tible
as I could, for the Belief of it;
and I don't doubt, but our Christian
<HI>Priests</HI> would have given me ample Prai∣ses
and Commendations for so doing. It
is said of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> that for the Enter∣tainment
of his Friends, he commanded
variety of nice Dishes of Meat, together
with Bowls of choicest Wine, all on a
sudden to descend upon his Table and
range themselves in good Order. Whe∣ther
there was any Truth in this Mira∣cle
of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> is not the Question;
but Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication of the Christian Religion.</HI> p. 82.</NOTE> could see a Fault
in it, (tho none in <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Wine at this
Wedding) as if it was done for the Plea∣sure
of luxurious Appetites, tho we read
of no Intemperance at it, which can't be
said of the <HI>Wedding-Feast</HI> before us. Our
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
<HI>Divines</HI> I suppose, no more than myself,
believe any thing of the said Miracle in
<HI>Apollonius</HI>; but, if it was really wrought,
I fancy, I could have lampoon'd him for
it, and would have made it a diabolical
Work, like that, as Fables go, of the
Feastings of <HI>Wizards</HI> and <HI>Witches</HI>; and
our <HI>Divines</HI> (passing by <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Wine</HI>
here) would readily, as they are Be∣lievers
of the Storys of Witchcraft, have
struck in with me.</P>
<P>But setting aside that miraculous Story
of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> which has but <HI>one</HI> Voucher;
the Case before us is <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>turning Wa∣ter
into Wine</HI> for the use of Men, who
had before <HI>well drank.</HI> How shall I
force Nature and Faith to ridicule this
Story? How shall I lay aside that pro∣found
Veneration for the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI>
which Conversation with the Fathers,
more than the Prejudice of Education
has begotten in me, and ludicrously here
treat him and his Miracle too, as is in∣cumbent
upon me, to make way for the
Mystery? In short, I can't do it, in my
own Name; but having met with a sati∣rical
Invective of a supposed Jewish <HI>Rabbi</HI>
to this purpose, I here publish it, that
our <HI>Clergy,</HI> as well as myself, may
think of an Answer to it, and so pre∣vent
that Mischief it may do by being
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
handed about among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI>
in Manuscript. It is as follows;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>You Christians pay Adoration to
<HI>Jesus,</HI> whom you believe to be a di∣vine
Author of Religion, sent of God
for the Instruction, Reformation and
Salvation of Mankind; and what in∣duces
you to this Belief of him, is,
(besides some obscure Prophecies, which
you can't agree upon, and which nei∣ther
your selves, nor any body else
understands the Application of) the
History of his Miracles: But I won∣der,
you should have a good opinion
of him for his Miracles, which, if he
wrought no better than what are re∣corded
of him, by your <HI>Evangelists,</HI>
are, if duly consider'd, enough to a∣lienate
your Hearts from him. I can't
spare time now to examine into all of
them, but according to the cursory
Observation I have made on them, there
is not one so well circumstanced, as to
merit a considerate Man's belief, that
it was the Work of an omnipotent,
all-wise, just and good Agent. Some
of them are absurd Tales, others foo∣lish
Facts, others unjust Actions, others
ludicrous Pranks, others jugling Tricks,
others magical Enchantments; and if
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
many of them had been better and
greater Operations than they are, and
of a more useful and stupendous na∣ture
than they seem to be; yet the
first Miracle that he wrought, <HI>viz.</HI>
that of his <HI>turning Water into Wine</HI>
at an extravagant and voluptuous Wed∣ding
at <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> is enough to
turn our Stomachs against all the rest.
It is in itself enough to beget in us
an ill opinion of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and to prepossess
us with an aversion to his Religion,
without farther Examination into it.
It is enough to make us suspect his o∣ther
Miracles, of what name soever,
to be of a base, magical, and diaboli∣cal
Extraction; or he had never set
up for a divine worker of Miracles
with so ill a grace. Would any so∣ber,
grave, serious and divine Person,
as you Christians suppose <HI>Jesus</HI> to have
been, have vouchsaf'd his Presence at
a Wedding, where such Levities, Di∣versions
and Excesses (in our Nation of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as in all others)
were indulg'd on such Occasions, as
were not fit to be seen, much less
countenanc'd by the <HI>Saint,</HI> you would
make of him. If your <HI>Jesus,</HI> his Mo∣ther,
and his Disciples had not been
merry Folks in themselves, they would
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
have declined the Invitation of the
<HI>Bridegroom</HI>; nay, if they had been at
all graver and more serious People
than ordinary, no Invitation had been
given to such <HI>Spoil-Sports</HI>: But boon
Companions they were, and of comi∣mical
Conversation, or there had been
at a Wedding no room for them. You
Christians may fancy, what you please,
of <HI>Jesus</HI> and his Mother's Saintship;
but the very Text of the Story im∣plies,
they were Lovers of good Fel∣lowship
and Excess too, upon occa∣sion;
or he had never, upon her Inti∣mation,
turn'd so large a quantity of
Water into Wine, after all or most of
the Company were far gone with it.
You may suppose, if you please, that
all were sober, and none intoxicated,
and that the want of Wine pro∣ceeded
from the abundance of Com∣pany,
rather than excess in drinking;
but why then did <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evange∣list</HI>
use the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which im∣plies,
they were more than half seas
over? And if <HI>Jesus</HI> and his Mother
had not both a mind to <HI>top</HI> them up;
the one would not have requested, nor
the other have granted a Miracle to
that purpose. Whether <HI>Jesus</HI> and his
Mother themselves were at all <HI>cut,</HI> as
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
were others of the Company, is not
so certain. She might be an abstemi∣ous
Dame for ought we know; tho if
old Stories are true of her familiarity
with a <HI>Soldier,</HI> of whom came her
<HI>chara Deûm Soboles,</HI> in all probabi∣lity
she would take a <HI>Dram</HI> and a <HI>Bot∣tle</HI>
too. But it looks as if <HI>Jesus</HI> him∣self
was a little <HI>in</HI> for't, or he had
never spoke so waspishly and snap∣pishly
to his Mother, saying, <HI>Woman,</HI>
<HI>what have I to do with thee? mine
Hour is not yet come:</HI> which was ve∣ry
unbecoming of a dutiful Son, who,
excepting when he ran away from
his Parents, and put them to <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 48.</NOTE> 
<HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Trouble</HI> to look him up,
was, and is still in Heaven, say the
<HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> a most obedient Child.
You modern Christians may put what
Construction you can upon the words
above of <HI>Jesus</HI> to his Mother, to salve
his Credit; but the Fathers of your
Church <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Christus asperius respondit, quid tibi &amp; mihi, Mulier? <HI>St. Chrysost. in Loc. Johan.</HI> Vide &amp; <HI>Theophy∣lact. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> confess them to be a sharp
and surly Reply to her, which, if it
did not proceed from the natural bad∣ness0
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
of his Temper, derived, <HI>ex traduce,</HI>
from his supposed Father yet, was cer∣tainly
the effect of Drinking; and
that's the more likely, because it is
a <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>witless</HI> Sentence, such as
<HI>Fuddlecaps</HI> utter by halves, when the
<HI>Wine's in,</HI> and the <HI>Wit's out.</HI> Your
modern <HI>Commentators</HI> are sadly puz∣zled
to make good Sense of this bro∣ken
and abrupt Sentence of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and
a pertinent Reply of it, to what his
Mother said to him, <HI>they have no
Wine:</HI> If you will bear with me, I'll
help you out at this dead lift, and
give you the true meaning of it <HI>thus.
Jesus</HI>'s Mother being apprised of a
deficiency of Wine, and willing, as well
as the <HI>Bridegroom,</HI> that the Company
should be thorowly merry before they
parted, intimates to her Son, (whom
she knew to be initiated in the My∣sterys
of <HI>Bacchus</HI>) <HI>that they had no
Wine:</HI> But before she could finish her
Request to him, He, mistaking her
meaning, imagines, she was caution∣ing
against drinking more Wine, and
exhorting him to go home, where∣upon
he takes her up short and quick,
saying, <HI>Woman, what have you to do
with me?</HI> (for that too is the <HI>English</HI>
of the <HI>Greek</HI>) I'll not be interrupted
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
in my Cups, nor break Company
<HI>for mine Hour is not yet come</HI> to de∣part:
But after he rightly apprehend∣ed
her, he goes to work, and rather
than the Company should want their
fill, by trick of Art, like a <HI>Punch∣maker,</HI>
meliorates Water into what they
call'd Wine. That this is the obvious
Interpretation, and natural Paraphrase
of the Words before us, shall be try'd
by the absurd Comments now-a-days
put upon them, that are enough to
make a considerate Man laugh, if not
hiss at them.</P>
<P>Some antient Hereticks <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Vide Sanctum Augustinum. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> , very
gravely infer'd from this Expression,
<HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee,</HI>
that <HI>Mary</HI> was neither a Virgin, nor
<HI>Jesus</HI> her Son; or he had never ac∣costed
her with such blunt Language,
that implys, they could not be so a∣kin
to each other. This was a per∣plexity
to St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> and gave him
some trouble to explain the Expres∣sion,
consistently with her Virginity
(for all she cohabited with the old Car∣penter)
and his Filiation. But this
being a quibble, that has been long
since dropt, I shall not revive, nor in∣sist
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
on it. But that the Expression
above do's suppose a little Inebriation
in <HI>Jesus,</HI> I may averr, neither is
there a better Solution to be made of
it.</P>
<P>The Fathers of your Church, be∣ing
sensible of the absurdity, abrupt∣ness,
impertinence, pertness, and sensles∣ness
of the Passage before us accord∣ing
to the Letter, had recourse to
a mystical and allegorical Interpreta∣tion,
as the only way to make it con∣sistent
with the Wisdom, Sobriety and
Duty of the Holy <HI>Jesus.</HI> But you
<HI>Moderns,</HI> abandoning Allegories and
Mysteries in Miracles, have endea∣vour'd,
I say, to put other Construc∣tions
upon it, as may comport with
the Letter and Credit of Jesus: But
how insipid and sensless they are,
I appeal to a reasonable Man, who
will give himself the trouble to con∣sult
them, upon the Place, and save
me the pains of a tedious and nau∣seous
Work to recount them for him.</P>
<P>But to humour the Christian Priest∣hood
at this Day, I will suppose that
<HI>Jesus,</HI> and his Mother, and Disciples,
tho Fishermen, to have been all sober,
grave, and serious at this Wedding,
suitably to the Opinion that their Fol∣lowers
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
now would have us to enter∣tain
of them. But then it is hard
to conceive them, less than Spectators
and even Encouragers of Excess and
Intemperance in others; or <HI>Jesus,</HI> af∣ter
their more than sufficient drink∣ing
for the satisfaction of Nature,
had never turn'd Water into Wine,
nor would his Mother have requested
him to do it, if, I say, they had not
a mind, and took Pleasure in it too, to
see the Company quite <HI>stitch'd up.</HI></P>
<P>A sober, prudent and wise Philoso∣pher
or <HI>Magician,</HI> in the place of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> if he had an Art or Power to
turn Water into Wine, would never
have exercis'd it upon such an occa∣sion;
no, not to please his best Friends,
nor in obedience to the most indul∣gent
Parent. What would he have
said in such a Case? That the Com∣pany
had drank sufficiently already,
and there was no need of more Wine:
The Bridegroom had kindly and plen∣tifully
entertain'd his Guests, and he
would not for the Honour of God,
who had endow'd him with a divine
Power, be at the Expence of a Mi∣racle
to promote the least Intemperance.
Whether such a Speech and Resolu∣tion
in <HI>Jesus,</HI> upon this occasion,
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
would not have been more commen∣dable,
than what he did, let any one
judge.</P>
<P>If I was a Christian, I would, for
the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> renounce this
Miracle, and not magnify and extol
it as a divine and good Act, as many
now-a-days do. I would give into,
and contend for the Truth of <HI>that
Gloss,</HI> which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> of old <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Apud St. Chrysostomum <HI>in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> 
by way of Objection put upon it,
<HI>viz. That the Company having ex∣hausted
the Bridegroom's Stock of Wine,
and being in Expectation of more</HI>;
Jesus, <HI>rather than the Bridegroom should
be put to the Blush for deficiency,
palm'd a false Miracle, by the help
of the Governour of the Feast, upon
a drunken Crew</HI>; <HI>that is, having some
spirituous Liquors at hand, mingled
them with a quantity of Water, which
the Governour of the Feast vouch'd
to be incomparable good Wine, mira∣culously
made by</HI> Jesus: <HI>and the Com∣pany
being, thro' a vitiated Palate,
uncapable of distinguishing better from
worse, and of discovering the Fraud,
admired the Wine and the Miracle</HI>;
<HI>and applauded</HI> Jesus <HI>for it, and per∣haps</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<HI>became his Disciples upon it.</HI> If
I, I say, was a Disciple of <HI>Jesus,</HI> I
would give this Story such an old
turn for his Credit. And I appeal
to indifferent Judges, whether such a
daubing of the Miracle, to remove the
Offence of <HI>Infidels</HI> at this Day, would
not be politically and wisely done of
me. Whether modern Christians may
be brought into such a Notion of
this supposed Miracle, I know not;
but really there is room enough to
suspect such a Fraud in it.</P>
<P>But supposing <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Change of
Water into Wine to have been a real
Miracle; none commission'd of God
for the Reformation and Instruction
of Mankind would ever have done it
here. Miracles (as Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication of the Christian Religion,</HI> p. 82.</NOTE> 
says excellently well) <HI>must be such
things, as that it is consistent with
the Perfections of God,</HI> to interest
himself in; and again, <HI>they must ar∣gue
not only the Power of God, but
his Love to Mankind, and his Inclina∣tion
to do them good</HI>; which this of
<HI>Jesus</HI> is so far from, that it has an
an evil Aspect and Tendency, as is
above represented; consequently it is
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
to be rejected, and no longer esteem'd
a divine Miracle; neither is <HI>Jesus</HI> to
be received as a Revealer of God's
Will for it, as Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> will
bear me witness.</P>
<P>No doubt on't, but you Christian
Priests would have us <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>In∣fidels,</HI>
to believe the whole Com∣pany
at this Wedding, for all what
is intimated by St. <HI>John</HI> to the con∣trary,
to consist of sober and demure
Saints. I will suppose so; but then,
what occasion had they at all for
Wine? What reason could there be
for God's Power to interpose and make
it, especially in so large a quantity,
for them? I can conceive none. If
any of the Company had been taken
with fainting Fits; and <HI>Jesus</HI> for
want of a Cordial Bottle, had created
a chearing Dram or two, I could not
have found fault with it; tho even
here, if he had restored the <HI>Patient</HI>
with a word of his Mouth, it had
been a better Miracle, than making
of Wine for him: But that he should
make for a Company of Sots, a large
quantity of Wine, of no less than
twelve or eighteen Firkins of <HI>English</HI>
Measure, enough to intoxicate the
whole Town of <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> is
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
what can never be accounted for by
a Christian, who should, one would
think, wish this Story, for the Repu∣tation
of <HI>Jesus</HI> expunged out of the
New Testament.</P>
<P>Besides, if <HI>Jesus</HI> had really and mi∣raculously
made Wine, which no Power
or Art of Man could do, he should,
to prevent all suspicion of deceit in
the Miracle, have done it without
the use of Water. You Christians say,
he is the original Cause of all Things
out of Nothing; why then did he
not <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Sed quanam gratia, antequam implerentur, non fecit Miraculum, quod longè fuisset admirabilius? Siqui∣dem aliud est subjectae Materiae qualitatem mutare, ali∣ud ipsam substantiam ex nihilo facere. <HI>Chrysos. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> create this Wine out of no∣thing?
why did he not order the
Pots to be emptied of their Water,
if there was any in them, and then
with a word of his Mouth command
the filling them with Wine instead of
it? Here had been an unexceptiona∣ble
Miracle, which no <HI>Infidels</HI> could
have cavil'd at, for any thing, but the
<HI>needlessness</HI> of it. But this subject
Matter of Water spoils the Credit of
the Miracle. The Water-Pots, it seems,
are to be fill'd, before <HI>Jesus</HI> could do
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
the notable Feat; is not this enough
to make us think, that Jesus was but
an artificial <HI>Punch-maker?</HI> Could not
he create Wine without Water for a
Transmutation? Yes, you'll say he
could: what was the Reason then, that
he did not? This is a reasonable Ques∣tion
to a learned Priesthood; and a ra∣tional
Answer should be given to
it. And a Question too it is that
heretofore has been under debate.
Some said that the Water might be
used to abate of the <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Saepe obest Magnitudo, ne Miracula creditu sint facilia. <HI>Theophylaect. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> immensity
of the Miracle, which otherwise for
its greatness might have surpass'd all
belief. But this Reason will not do.
A Miracle can't be too great in itself,
if well attested, to transcend Credit:
but it may easily be too little to con∣ciliate
the Faith of a Free-Thinker.
The Fathers of your Church fetch'd a
Reason, for the use of Water here,
from the Mystery; but since Mysterys
on Miracles are set aside by the Priest∣hood
of this Age, they are to assign
another and good Reason of their own;
or this Miracle is to be rejected, as a
piece of Art and Craft in the Ope∣rator,
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
if for no other Reason than this,
that <HI>Jesus</HI> used Water to make Wine.</P>
<P>All that I have to say more to this
Miracle, is, that it is to be wish'd, if
Jesus could turn Water into Wine, that
he had imparted the Secret and Power
to his Disciples of the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of
all Ages since, which would have been
of greatest Advantage to them in this
World. He has empower'd them, they
say, to remit Sins, which few old
Sinners think themselves the less in
danger for: And he has enabled them,
some say, to transubstantiate Bread in∣to
Flesh, and Wine into Blood,
which none but foolish and supersti∣tious
Folks believe they ever did:
And he promised to invest them with
a Power to do greater Miracles than
himself, even to remove Mountains,
and to curse Trees; but I thank God,
they never were of so strong a Faith,
as to put it in Practice, or we might
have heard of the <HI>natural</HI> state, as well
as we do now of the <HI>civil</HI> state of some
Countrys, ruin'd and overturn'd by
them. But this Power to transmute
<HI>Water into Wine,</HI> without Labour and
Expence, would have been of better
worth to them, than all their other
Priestly Offices. Not, that our Con∣duits
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
would thereupon run with Wine,
instead of Water; or that Wine would
be cheaper and more plentiful than it
is now, excepting among themselves,
if they could withal curse Vineyards.
They would make the best Penny
they could of their divine Power.
And as surely as they can now sell
the Water-drops of their Fingers at a
Christening, at a good Rate, they would
set a better Price on their miraculously
made Wine, and give a notable Rea∣son
for its dearness, <HI>viz.</HI> that Miracles
should not be <HI>cheap,</HI> which would
bring them into Contempt, and lessen
the Wonder and Admiration of them.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>So ends the Invective of a suppos'd
Jewish <HI>Rabbi</HI> against this Miracle; which
our <HI>Divines,</HI> as well as myself, are to
consider of an Answer to. Whether
they shall think themselves able to an∣swer
the rational Parts of it, consistently
with the Letter, I know not; but I
own myself unable, and believe it impos∣sible
for them, to do it: And therefore
they must of necessity go along with me
to the mystical Interpretation of the Fa∣thers;
or this Miracle will turn to the
dishonour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and disadvantage of
his Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51"/>
<HI>Justin Martyr</HI> <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">In Dialog. cum Tryphone, <HI>p.</HI> 364.</NOTE> says, it is absurd
to take the Stories of the Marriages and
Concubinages of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> of the
Old Testament in a literal Sense. And
indeed, literally consider'd, they are some
of them too luscious Tales to be related
by divine and inspired Penmen: where∣upon
he, as well as St. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Philo-Judaeus</HI>
 <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">In Lib. de Abrahamo.</NOTE> , turn these Stories, for the
Honour of God and Edification of his
Church, into an Allegory. Consequently,
if <HI>Justin</HI> had had an occasion to speak
of this Marriage before us, there's no
doubt on't, but he would have made My∣stery
of all and every Part of it.</P>
<P>To the same purpose <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Matt. Tract.</HI> xxii.</NOTE> says,
"That since the Law is a shadow of
good Things to come, and writes some∣times
of Marriages and of Husbands
and Wives; we are not to understand
it of Marriages according to the Flesh,
but of the spiritual Marriage between
Christ and his Church. As for Instance,
<HI>Abraham</HI> had two Sons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> here we
ought not to confine our Thoughts to
carnal Marriages, and their Offsprings;
but to extend them to the Mysteries
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
here signified. And there are almost
a thousand other places in Scripture
about Marriages; but in every place
(<HI>unusquisque Locus castum &amp; divinum
de Nuptiis continet Intellectum secun∣dum
Expositionem moralem</HI>) is to have
a divine, moral, and mystical Con∣struction
put on't. Whoever therefore
reads the Scriptures about Marriages,
and understands no more by them,
than carnal Marriages; he errs, not
knowing the Scriptures nor the Power
of God." From hence may be easily
concluded, what was <HI>Origen</HI>'s opinion a∣bout
this Marriage in <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI>
if there were no other Passages in him
for a Confirmation of it. But to come
closer to the Purpose.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Aliquid enim &amp; in ipsis factis innuit nobis, puto, quia non sine causa venit ad Nuptias. Excepto Mira∣culo, aliquid in ipso facto Mysterii &amp; Sacramenti latet. Pulsemus ut aperiet &amp; de Vino invisibili inebriet nos. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> says, there is Mys∣tery
signified in the Story of this Marriage,
as in all <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, which it be∣comes
us to open and search for; till, if
possible, we are <HI>inebriated</HI> with the spiri∣tual
and invisible Wine, that <HI>Jesus</HI> made
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
at this Feast. And again <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">Nihil dicemus, quid sibi velint Hydriae, quid Aqua in Vinum conversa, quid Architriclinius, quid Sponsus, quid Mater Jesu in Mysterio, quid ipsae Nup∣tiae? <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> says, Let
us then consider the several Particulars of
the Story, and what is meant by the six
Waterpots; and the Water that is turn'd
into Wine; and the Governor of the
Feast; and who are the Bridegroom and
the Bride; and who is the Mother of <HI>Jesus</HI>
in a Mystery; and what is to be under∣stood
by the Marriage.</P>
<P>And again, says St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Per hoc invitatus Dominus venit ad Nuptias, ut ostenderetur Sacramentam Nuptiarum,—Illarum Nuptiarum Sponsus Personam Domini figurabat, cui dictum est, servasti bonum Vinum usque adhuc, Bonum Vinum id est Evangelium servasti usque adhuc. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> , there
is Mystery in this Marriage, or <HI>Jesus</HI> up∣on
no invitation had gone to it. The
Bridegroom is our Lord himself, to whom
it is said thou hast reserv'd the good Wine
of the Gospel <HI>until now,</HI> that is, until the
typified Time of the Celebration of this
mystical Marriage, which according to St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Sex Hydriae sunt sex Aetates Temporum capientes Prophetiam pertinentem ad omnes gentes sive in duobus generibus hominum, id est, Judaeis &amp; Graecis, sive in tribus propter Noe tres Filios. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> is to be on the sixth Age
of the World, signified by the six Water-Pots,
holding two or three Firkins apiece,
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
that is, all Mankind, as they are divided
into the <HI>two</HI> sorts of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
or into <HI>three,</HI> as they are descended of
the <HI>three</HI> Sons of <HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P>And in another Place, the same St.
<HI>Augustin</HI> interpreting this Story, says <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Vocatur Salvator ad Nuptias, hoc est, Ecclesiae voto spiritus sanctus invocatur.—Venit cum Discipulis suis, id est, in Loco sancto, Turba sanctorum. Mi∣rabilia Dei Maria Mater expectat, hoc est, Virtutem Christi expectat Ecclesia.—Maria ait, ecce Vina de∣ficiant, hoc est, Vinum Spiritus Ecclesia optat excipere.—Numquid Mulierem dicit Jesu Mariam, quae Virgo post Pactum inventa est?

thus; "Our Saviour is invited to a Mar∣riage;
what can that mean but that the
Holy Spirit is courted and invocated by
the Church, wishing to be espoused to
him? <HI>Jesus</HI> comes with his Disciples,
that is, into a holy Place of a Company
of Saints. <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of our Lord
signifies to him, <HI>that they have no Wine</HI>;
so the Church makes known to him,
the Deficiency of the Spirit, which she
waits for the Power of. And if <HI>Jesus</HI>
calls <HI>Mary,</HI> a Woman; he means the
Church, who by Transfiguration may
be a Virgin, the Mother, the Spouse of
Christ, and a Whore too."</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55"/>
And again St. <HI>Augustin</HI> explaining <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Vinum multis Locis accipimus Scripturas Sanctas meracissimum Vigorem coelestis sapientiae continentes, quibus incalescant sensus &amp; inebrientur Affectus.

what is meant by the Water, and the
Wine that it wou'd be turn'd into, at
the Time of the spiritual Celebration of
this Marriage of Christ with his Spouse of
the Church, says plainly enough, that by
<HI>Water</HI> is meant the Letter of the Scrip∣tures;
and by the best <HI>Wine</HI> is to be un∣derstood
spiritual Interpretations, which
would transport the understandings of Men
with divine knowledge; and warm their
Hearts and Affections into a spiritual <HI>In∣ebriation</HI>;
after the similitude of Wine
natural.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch,</HI> a most antient
Greek Commentator (who according to
<HI>Bishop Smalbroke</HI> should strictly adhere to
the Letter) says <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Per Nuptias, Conjunctionem Christi &amp; Ecclesiae, hoc est Veteris &amp; Novi Testamenti Traditionem debe∣mus accipere. Sponsus est Christus. Architriclinius est Moses. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> , that by this Mar∣riage
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
is meant the Conjunction of Christ
and his Church, as it is the Tradition of
the Old and New Testament. And that
<HI>Jesus</HI> himself is the Bridegroom; and
<HI>Moses</HI> the Governor of the Feast.</P>
<P>Other Fathers, such as St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> St.
<HI>Theophylact</HI> and St. <HI>Jerome</HI> are of the same
mind about the mystical Interpretation of
this Marriage, as might be prov'd by Pas∣sages
out of them, if I had room here to
cite them. But I must observe here, that
according to the Fathers, the Story of this
Marriage is but another Emblem of the
Marriage of the Lamb with the Bride of
the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> spoken of in the <HI>Re∣velations,</HI>
to which all the Fowls of the
Air will be invited, that is, spiritual and
heavenly minded Christians, who <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Volucres Coeli sunt verè puri &amp; ad caelestis sa∣pientiae Cognitionem evolare parati. <HI>Clem. Alex. Strom. L.</HI> iv.</NOTE> soar
and fly aloft in their divine and sublime
Contemplations on the anagogical Sense
of the Scriptures, which will exhibit those
intellectual Dainties, they are there to be
entertain'd with.</P>
<P>What I have here said out of the Fa∣thers
to the Story of this Marriage, is
enough to quicken our <HI>Divines</HI> to search
for the like mystical Interpretation of
the whole. The Part of it that's most
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
difficult to be spiritually expounded, is
that saying of <HI>Jesus</HI> to his Mother,
<HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine Hour is not yet come.</HI> For the clear
Interpretation of which, I own, I meet
with little in the Fathers. But St. <HI>Au∣gustin</HI>
 <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Quid mihi &amp; tibi est, Mulier? Procul dubio, Fratres, latet ibi aliquid Mysterii. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> assures us, there's latent My∣stery
in the words. How then shall we
come at it? Why, if we cast away the
<HI>Interrogation,</HI> and look upon the Sen∣tence,
as ellyptical, like an infinite num∣ber
of prophetical ones, the Sense para∣phrastically,
and agreeably to the rest of
the Mystery, arises thus: In answer to
the Woman of the Church's Expectation
of the Wine of the Spirit; <HI>Jesus</HI> will
tell her or make her to understand of
what importance it is to her (and him∣self)
to be supply'd with that mystical
Wine to her Edification, which it was
not his time to pour forth upon the
Church, till the Celebration of his Nup∣tials
with her.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the Mi∣racle
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s turning Water into Wine
at a Marriage of <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee.</HI> Whe∣ther
it be not an absurd and offensive
Story according to the Letter, let any
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
one judge. If the supposed Jewish <HI>Rabbi</HI>
has forced a worse Sense upon it, than
it will naturally bear, our <HI>Clergy</HI> may
expostulate with him for it, which they
hardly will any otherwise than by Ex∣clamations
against him, without Reason
and Authority. But in the mystical Ope∣ration
of this Miracle at the Marriage of
Christ with his Church, there will be
the Wisdom and Power and Goodness of
God visible. And it will be a demon∣stration
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>Messiahship,</HI> in as much
as the Water of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets can't be turn'd into the
Wine of spiritual Interpretations, but we
must discern how he is the Accomplisher
and Fulfiller of them. And so I pass to
an</P>
<P N="11">11. Eleventh Miracle of Jesus, <HI>viz.</HI>
 <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Matt. ix. Mark ii. Luke v.</NOTE> That of his healing a Paralytick,
for whom the Roof of the House was
broken up to let him down into the
Room where <HI>Jesus</HI> was.</P>
<P>And this Story (without excepting that
of the Pool of <HI>Bethesda</HI>) is the most
monstrously absurd, improbable and in∣credible
of any according to the Letter.
There is not one Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI> spe∣cifically
related, that does not labour un∣der
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
more or less Absurdities, either in
Substance or Circumstance: But this, for
number and greatness of Absurdities, I
think surpasses them all: And the Ab∣surdities
of it too are so obvious and stare
a Man in the Face, that I wonder they
are hitherto overlook'd, and that consi∣derate
and intelligent Persons have not
before now hesitated and boggled at them.
If Interest had not blinded the Eyes of
our learned <HI>Clergy,</HI> they would easily
have descry'd the Incredibilities and Ab∣surdities
of this Story; and in another
<HI>Impostor</HI>'s Case presently have pointed
them out to the ridicule of his Admirers
and Adorers.</P>
<P>If a Man was to torture his Brains for
the Invention of a romantick Tale of im∣probable
and surprizing Circumstances,
that he might, withal, hope to palm for
a Truth, if it was but for a Week or a
Day, upon the Faith and Understanding
of the Credulous; he could never have
presumed, I think, so far upon the weak∣ness
of their Intellects, as to imagine any
thing so grosly and notoriously contradic∣tory
to Sense and Reason, would have
gone down with them, as is <HI>this</HI> before
us, which has pass'd currently thro' ma∣ny
Ages of the Church, has been read
with attention by the Learned, and re∣vered
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
by the rest of Christians, without
any exception, hesitation, or doubt of
the Truth of it. In short, so palpable is
the falsity of the Story of this Miracle,
that it requires no Sagacity to detect it;
and was it not for the sake of the My∣stery
more than to expose the Folly of
the <HI>Clergy</HI> in believing of it, I had never
bestow'd the following Pains on it.</P>
<P>The People, it seems, so press'd and
throng'd about the Door of the House,
where <HI>Jesus</HI> was, that the Paralytick and
his Bearers could not get near it. What
did they so throng and press for? Was
it to see <HI>Jesus,</HI> who was <HI>without Form
and Comeliness,</HI> according to the Prophet
<HI>Isaiah</HI>; or, who was one of the most
graceful of the Sons of Men, as <HI>Painters</HI>
and <HI>Publius Lentulus</HI> do describe him?
This could not be the Reason of the
Croud. Tho a Person extraordinary, ei∣ther
for Beauty or Deformity may at∣tract
the Eyes of the People, and oc∣casion
too a Throng about him; yet this
could be no Reason for a <HI>Press</HI> about
<HI>Jesus,</HI> at <HI>Capernaum,</HI> where he dwelt,
and was commonly seen and well known.</P>
<P>Was it then to hear him preach?
Nor this neither. Tho an excellent
Preacher does sometimes, and a very in∣different
one does oftener draw multi∣tudes
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
after him; yet <HI>Jesus,</HI> as a Pro∣phet,
was without Honour at <HI>Capernaum,</HI>
his own Country; consequently, it is
not to be supposed that, for his Doc∣trine,
he was so much follow'd here, tho
we read, that he <HI>preach'd the Word unto
them.</HI></P>
<P>Was it then to behold him working
of Miracles and curing of the diseased?
This is the likeliest Reason of the Crouds
and Throng about him. And perhaps
it was a Day appointed beforehand for
his healing of the diseased, which might
occasion a more than ordinary Concourse
of the People. But then this Reason
would have induced the People to make
way for the <HI>Lame, Blind,</HI> and <HI>Paraly∣ticks</HI>
to come to <HI>Jesus</HI>; or they frustra∣ted
their own Hopes and Expectations of
seeing Miracles wrought; and acted more
unreasonably than ever Mob did, or can
be supposed to do.</P>
<P>But whatever was the Reason of this
tumultuous Crouding, which is hard to
be accounted for; it's said, the poor
<HI>Paralytick</HI> with his Bearers could not
get to the Door of the House for the
<HI>Press,</HI> and therefore in all haste is he
haul'd to the Top of the House, and let
down, thro' a breach of the Roof, into
the Room where <HI>Jesus</HI> was. What need
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
was there of such haste and pains to get
to <HI>Jesus</HI> for a Cure? It was but wait∣ing
a while, not many Hours, and in
all probability the Tumult would be ap∣peas'd,
and access easily had to him.
But that the Bearers of the poor Man
should enterprise a trouble and difficulty
that could not require less Time, than
the Tumult could be supposed to last,
is a little strange and somewhat incre∣dible.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> says <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">Paralyticus repletum videret Theatrum, Aditus interclusos, Portum obseptum,—Non tamen dixit Propinquis suis, quid hoc Rei est? Expectemus, quous∣vue Domus evacuetur, Theatrum dimittatur, recedent, vui congregati sunt, poterimus privatim ad illum acce∣vere. <HI>In Homil. de hoc Paralyt.</HI></NOTE> , that the <HI>Pa∣ralytick</HI>
saw that the Market-place or
Street was throng'd with People, who
had obstructed all Passage to the House,
where <HI>Jesus</HI> was; and yet he did not
so much as say to his Friends and Bea∣rers,
"What's the Reason of this Tu∣mult?
Let's stay till it is appeas'd,
and the House clear'd of the People,
who ere long will depart; and then
we shall privately and quietly get ad∣mittance
to Jesus." But why did he
not say so? Any one beside himself and
his Bearers, if they had any Reason and
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
Senses about them, would have so ar∣gued.
St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> says, it was their
<HI>Faith</HI> that made them in such haste to
get to <HI>Jesus:</HI> But I should have thought,
their <HI>Faith</HI> might have work'd <HI>Patience,</HI>
and disposed them to stay till Jesus could
come out to them, or they get in to him:
And it is an Addition to the strangeness
and incredibility of the Story, that it
did not.</P>
<P>But supposing this <HI>Paralytick</HI> in such
haste and danger of Life, that he could
not wait the dispersion of the Tumult,
but, for want of a free entrance at the
Door, is, cost what it will, to be rais'd
to the top of the House, and a breach
must be there made for him. The Ques∣tion
is, whether such an Enterprize was
or could be feisable and practicable? I
have no Conception of the possibility of
it. If they could not get to the Door
of the House for the Press; of conse∣quence
they could not come at the Sides
of it. How should they? over the Heads
of the People? That's not to be ima∣gined;
consequently here's another dif∣ficulty
in the Story, that renders it yet
more strange and incredible.</P>
<P>But, without questioning the possibi∣lity
and easiness of getting the <HI>Parly∣tick</HI>
and his Couch over the Heads of
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
the Mob, to the sides of the House; thi∣ther
he is brought, where we now behold
him and his Bearers with their Pullies,
Ropes, and Ladders (that were not at
hand, nor could suddenly be procured)
hauling and heaving him to the top of
the House. Of what height the House
was, is not of much Consequence. Some
for the Credit of the Story may say
 <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">Dicet aliquis valde dimissum fuisse Locum, à quo per Tegulas deposuerunt Paralytici Lectum. <HI>Johan. Ne∣pot. Hieros. in Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> , it was a <HI>very low one</HI>; tho antient
and modern <HI>Commentators</HI> are pretty well
agreed, that it was an <HI>upper-Room,</HI> where
<HI>Jesus</HI> was; consequently the House was
at least two Stories high: But if it was
much higher, I'll allow that Art and
Pullies (which they wanted for the pre∣sent)
would raise the Man and his Bed
to the top of it: So we will not dis∣pute
nor differ upon that matter. On
the top of the House then, we are now
to behold the <HI>Paralytick</HI> and his Bearers
with their Hatchets and Hammers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
(which they forgot to bring with them,
for they could not think of any use
they should have of them) uncovering
the Roof of the House; breaking up
<HI>Tiles, Spars,</HI> and <HI>Rafters,</HI> and making a
Hole, capacious enough for the Man and
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
his Bed to be let through. An odd, strange,
and unaccountable Work <HI>this,</HI> which, if
they had not been cunning Fellows, would
hardly have enter'd into their Heads to
project. But at work they are, when it
was well, if Jesus and his Disciples e∣scaped
with a only broken Pate, by the fal∣ling
of Tiles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if the rest were
not almost smother'd with the Dust; for
it was over their Heads that the breach
was made. Where was the good Man of
the House all this while? Would he
suffer his House to be thus broken up,
and not command them to desist from
their foolish and needless Attempt, till
the Mob was quell'd, and there was a free
entrance at the Door of his House, which
could not be long first? Is there nothing
in all this, of difficulty and obstruction
in the way of the belief of this Story?</P>
<P>Some modern <HI>Commentators,</HI> being a∣ware
of these difficulties in this Story,
and willing to reconcile Men to the ea∣sier
belief of it, say, as <HI>Drusius</HI> <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Judaeorum Tecta plana erant, &amp; non in Coni formam fastigiata. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> did,
that the Houses of <HI>Judaea</HI> were <HI>flat∣roof'd,</HI>
<HI>and not ridg'd</HI>: And Doctors,
<HI>Lightfoot</HI> and <HI>Whitby</HI> <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> say, there was
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
a Door on their flat Roofs, by which the
<HI>Jews</HI> used to ascend to the top of their
Houses, where they discours'd on the
Law and religious Matters; and that it
was thro' such a Door, by a little wide∣ning
of the sides of it, that the <HI>Para∣lytick</HI>
was let down in the presence of
<HI>Jesus.</HI> To which Opinion I would yield,
if it was not liable to these Objections,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it is not reconcilable to what
St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, of <HI>their letting the Para∣lytick
down thro' the Tiling with his
Couch, in the midst, where Jesus was</HI>;
nor hardly consistent with what St. <HI>Mark</HI>
says, of their <HI>uncovering</HI> and <HI>breaking
up the Roof of the House:</HI> which Ex∣pressions
the <HI>Evangelists</HI> had never used,
if there had been a Door for him to de∣scend
by. But to indulge <HI>Lightfoot</HI> and
<HI>Whitby</HI> in their Notion; I may ask them,
what occasion was there then of wide∣ning
the door-way, and breaking down
the sides of it? They'll say, because the
Passage otherwise was too narrow, for the
Man's Couch to get thro'. Why then
did not they take him out of his Couch,
and let him down in a Blanket, a Chair,
or a Basket? Or rather, why did not
<HI>Jesus,</HI> to prevent this Trouble and Damage
to the House, ascend thro' this Door, to
the Top of it, and there speak the healing
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
Word to this poor Man? To say, that
<HI>Jesus</HI> could not or would not go up to
the Paralytick, I would not, for Fear of
an Imputation of Blasphemy against me.
Our <HI>Divines</HI> therefore are to look for,
what they'll hardly find, an Answer to
the said Question, which will consist with
the Wisdom, the Goodness and Honour of
<HI>Jesus</HI>; or here will be another and in∣superable
Bar to the Credibility of this
Story.</P>
<P>In short, there are more and greater Dif∣ficultys
affecting the Credit of this Mira∣cle,
on the side of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than any before
urg'd. Could not he, as it was antiently
 <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Numquid enim facilem illi potuit Accessum red∣dere? <HI>Apud Chrysostom. de hoc Paralyt.</HI></NOTE> objected, have made the Access to
himself more easy? Could not he, to pre∣vent
all this Trouble and Pains of getting
to the Top of the House; and of breaking
up the Roof of it, have desired or even
forc'd the People to make way for this
poor Man and his Bearers? This was not
impossible for him to do. If it was hard
for another; it was not for him, who was
omnipotent. He that could drive his
Thousands before him out of the Temple;
and draw as many after him into the Wil∣derness,
might surely, by Force or Per∣suasion
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
have made the People, how unrea∣tonably
mobbish soever, to retreat. And
shy did he not? Without a good and sa∣tisfactory
Answer, which I can't conceive,
to this Question, here is the most unac∣countable
and incredible part of the whole
Story, that reflects on the Wisdom, the
Power and Goodness of <HI>Jesus.</HI> If there
had been no other absurd Circumstances of
it, this is enough to spoil its Credit, so
far as that I believe it impossible for
<HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI> with all their
Wit, Penetration and Sagacity to get o∣ver
it.</P>
<P>Believe then the Story of this Miracle,
thus taken to Pieces, who can? It is such
an Accumulation of Absurdities, Improba∣bilities,
and Incredibilities, that a Man of
the most easy Faith, if he at all think,
can't digest. It's not credible, I said, to
suppose, the People of <HI>Capernaum,</HI> where
<HI>Jesus</HI> dwelt, and was well known and
little admired, would at all <HI>press</HI> to see
or hear him: And if the occasion of their
Concourse was to behold his Miracles;
it is less reasonable to think they would
tumultuate to their own disappointment;
but rather make way for the diseased, for
the satisfaction of their own Curiosity, to
come to him: And if they did mob it
to their own disappointment, about the
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
Door of the House; it was next to im∣possible
for the poor Man and his Couch
to be heav'd over their Heads, and rais'd
to the top of it: More unreasonable yet
to think, the Master of the House would
suffer the Roof of it to be so broken up:
But most of all against Reason to sup∣pose,
<HI>Jesus</HI> would not give forth the heal∣ing
word, and prevent all this Labour,
or by his divine Power disperse the Peo∣ple,
that the <HI>Paralytick</HI> might have present
and easy access to him.</P>
<P>Whether all this be not absolutely
shocking of the Credit of this Story, let
my Readers judge. In my Opinion, no
Tale more monstrously romantick can be
told. I don't here question <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Power
to heal this Paralytick, nor the miracu∣lousness
of the Cure of him: The trou∣ble
of that Question is saved me, by
the many other incredible Circumstances
of the Story, which are such a Contra∣diction
to Sense and Reason, as is not to
be equall'd, in any thing, that's com∣monly
receiv'd and believ'd by Mankind.
<HI>Cicero</HI> says, that there is nothing so ab∣surd,
which some of the Philosophers have
not held. And they might and did, some
of them, hold gross Absurdities. But the
Letter of the Story of this Miracle be∣fore
us, which is the Object of the Faith
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
of our learned Priesthood at this Day, a is
match for the worst of them.</P>
<P>But as absurd, as this Story is, I ex∣pect
that our <HI>Clergy</HI> will be disgusted at
my ludicrous display of it; and that
Arch-Deacon <HI>Stubbs</HI> in particular will a∣gain
be ready to exclaim against me, and
say, that this is turning a <HI>miraculous
Fact,</HI> and a <HI>divine Testimony</HI> of our Re∣ligion
into Ridicule. Whereupon it is
to be wish'd, <HI>that Arch-Deacon</HI> would
write, what would be a Pleasure to see,
a Vindication of this Story. If he can
account for the possibility and credibi∣lity
of the Letter of it, he shall have
my leave to make another dull Speech
in <HI>Convocation</HI> against me. And it is not
unlikely, but he may say as much for
it, as another Man: For as the Story is
senseless, so it is the better suited to his
Head and Brains. But if he don't, I
much question, whether any other Cler∣gyman
of more Wit will, appear in De∣fence
of it.</P>
<P>So absurd is the Letter of this Story,
that for the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and Cre∣dibility
of his Gospel, it is absolutely
necessary to turn it into Allegory. To the
Fathers then, let us go for their help in
this Case. If they did not read me a better
Lecture upon this Miracle, than do our
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
modern <HI>Commentators,</HI> I should be almost
tempted to renounce my Religion upon
it: But as they have rationally and
rightly instructed me in its true meaning,
so I retain my Christian Faith, and ad∣mire
the Sublimity of the Mystery, which
I am now to give an account of.</P>
<P>By this <HI>Paralytick,</HI> St. <HI>Hilary</HI> <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">In Paralytico Gentium universitas offertur me∣denda. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> 
says, is to be understood <HI>Mankind</HI> of all
Nations, which opinion too the Fathers
held of the <HI>Paralytick,</HI> who was heal'd
at the Pool of <HI>Bethesda.</HI> And by his
Palsy is not meant any bodily Distemper,
but the spiritual Palsy of the Soul, that
is, as St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Paralyticus potest intelligi Anima dissoluta Mem∣bris, id est, bonis operibus. <HI>Inter. Quaest. Evang.</HI></NOTE> and St. <HI>Jerome</HI>
 <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Paralysis Typus est Torporis, quo piger jacet in Malitia Carnis, habens desiderium Salutis, &amp; Torporis Ignavia &amp; duplis Cogitationibus, ac si enervatus Membris ostendit. <HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> interpret, a dissoluteness of Morals,
and an unsteadiness of Faith and Princi∣ples,
which is the Condition of Mankind
at present, who want <HI>Jesus</HI>'s help for
the Cure of it. <HI>Eusebius Gallicanus</HI>
 <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">In hoc enim quod ait, remittuntur tibi Peccata, interiorem hominem, id est, spiritum paryliticum esse demonstrat. Hoc enim non dixisset, si ad Corporis In∣firmitatem respexisset. Non ideo Corpus sanatur, quia Anima à peccatis liberatur. <HI>In Homil. in Dominic.</HI> xix. <HI>post Pentecost.</HI></NOTE> says, our Saviour's words signify,
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
that it is not a bodily but a spiritual
Disease here meant; or he had never
said to the Paralytick, <HI>Son, thy Sins are
forgiven thee,</HI> which words respect the
inward Man, and demonstrate the Palsy
here to be a disease of the Soul.</P>
<P>The Man sick of the Palsy had <HI>four
Bearers.</HI> And who are they mystically
in this Case? Why, the Fathers <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Sed qui sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> isti quatuor, qui hunc Paralyticum portant &amp; Domino offerunt. Per hos enim nescio, qui melius quam quatuor Evangelistae intelligi possunt.

Marci.</HI></NOTE> 
understand by them the <HI>four Evangelists,</HI>
on whose Faith and Doctrine Mankind
is to be carry'd unto Christ; for no
Soul can be brought unto him, for the
Sanation of his Sins and Errors, but by
these <HI>four.</HI></P>
<P>But to the top of the House is Mankind,
thus paralytically diseased, to be carry'd
by the four Evangelists, his Bearers. And
what then is this House and its Top?
The House of <HI>Jesus</HI> is the intellectual
Edifice of the World, otherwise call'd
Wisdom's House, of the beautiful Build∣ings
of which the Scriptures prophetically
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
treat: therefore to the <HI>sublime Sense</HI> of
the Scriptures, call'd the Top <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Tectum Domus qua Christus docet, ascendendum, id est, Sacrae Scripturae Sublimitas est appetenda. <HI>Bedae in Loc. Lucae.</HI></NOTE> of the
House, is Man to be taken: He is not
to abide in the <HI>low and literal Sense</HI>
 <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">Non utique in Infimis exterius, qua turbae tumul∣tuantur remanendum, sed Tectum Domus, &amp;c. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> of them, where People <HI>press</HI> and
strive in vain to come to <HI>Jesus.</HI> But if
he is taken to the Sublimity of the Scrip∣tures
and there <HI>open</HI> <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">Patefacto Tecto, aeger ad Jesum summittitur, quia reseratis Scripturarum Mysteriis, ad Notitiam Christi pervenitur. <HI>Bedae in Loc.

<P>Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> who is altogether a
a Transcriber of the Fathers, for which
Reason I cite him among the Fathers,
says <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Et bene Domus Jesu juxta alterius Evangelistae Nar∣rationem tegulis esse contecta reperitur, quia sub contemp∣tibili Literarum Velamine, si adsit, qui reseret, divina spiritualis Gratiae Virtus invenietur. Denudatio etenim Tegularum in Domo Jesu, Apertio est, in utilitate Li∣terae, sensus spiritualis &amp; arcanorum coelestium. <HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> , that by the <HI>Tiles</HI> of the House
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
spoken of in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> is meant the <HI>Let∣ter</HI>
of the Scriptures, which is to be
laid open for the manifestation of Christ
and of divine Mysteries to the healing
of Man's spiritual Palsy, the unsteadi∣ness
and dissoluteness of his Morals and
Principles.</P>
<P>So much, in short, then to the mystical
Interpretation of the Story of this Mi∣racle.
The literal Sense of it is so en∣cumber'd
with romantick Circumstances,
as are enough to turn a Man's Heart
against Christianity it self: But in the
Mystery there will be a most stupendous
Miracle, which will be not only an Ar∣gument
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s divine Power, but of
his <HI>Messiahship,</HI> as certainly as his House
of Wisdom, of which the Scriptures
write, is open'd to the Manifestation of
his Presence, and to the Cure of Man∣kind
of his paralytical Disease, call'd an
instability of Faith and Principles.</P>
<P>And thus have I, in this <HI>Discourse,</HI>
taken into Examination three more of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles; which I submit to the
Judgment of my Readers, whether the
literal Story of them does not consist of
Absurdities, Improbabilities and Incredi∣bilites
according to the Proposition be∣fore
us; and whether there is not a
necessity, for the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
turn them into prophetical and parabo∣lical
Narratives of what will be myste∣riously
and more wonderfully done by
him.</P>
<P>My next <HI>Discourse,</HI> if my mind hold,
shall treat on the three Stories of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
raising of the dead, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Widow
of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; after which I will give the
literal History of Christ's Resurrection,
that sandy Foundation of the Church, a
Review; and so conclude my Discourses
on the Miracles of our Saviour.</P>
<P>To run thro' all the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
and handle them in the manner I have
done the foregoing, would be a long and
tedious Work. But if our <HI>Divines</HI> shall
think, I have selected only those Mira∣cles,
which are obnoxious to Cavil and
Ridicule; and have omitted others, that
literally are a more unexceptionable
Testimony of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s divine Power, and
Authority; I will, for their Satisfaction,
take more of them to Task, and give
the Letter of their Stories, the like ludi∣crous
treatment. If I mistake not, the
Miracles already spoken to, together with
those of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s raising of the dead, and
of his own Resurrection, are the most
famous and remarkable of any others:
And according to the Observation I have
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
made on the rest, they are no less but ra∣ther
more liable to Ridicule and Excep∣tion.
But if any are of a contrary Opi∣nion,
and will let me know, which in
their Judgment are more unexceptio∣nable
Miracles, I will vouchsafe them
an Examination. I am sure there is not
one Miracle, which the Fathers of the
Church did not turn into Allegory; and
if we don't at this Day make mystical
Operations of them, they will none of
them, according to the Letter, stand their
Ground, nor abide the Test of a critical
Inquiry into them.</P>
<P>I don't expect, that this <HI>Discourse</HI> will
be any more pleasing and acceptable to
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Let∣ter</HI>
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, as well as of the
Prophecies of him, than any of my for∣mer:
But their Displeasure in the Case
will give me no Disturbance, nor am I
concern'd about any Resentment, they
can make of it. If they are offended at
these <HI>Discourses,</HI> they should as they came
forth, have written solid Confutations
of them, and so have prevented my Pub∣lication
of any more of this kind: But
instead of serious and potent Reasonings
against me, I have met with little else
but oral Railings, Exclamations, Defa∣mations,
and attempts for Prosecution;
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
which have been so far from terrifying
me, that they give me a secret Plea∣sure,
and animate me to proceed in the
Undertaking in hand.</P>
<P>I did not much question but the <HI>Bi∣shop</HI>
of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> whom I look'd up∣on
as a Person of Ingenuity and Learning
would, before this Time, have publish'd
somewhat in Confutation of one or other
of my former <HI>Discourses.</HI> Whether he
was not obliged to it, or to make me
some publick Reparation of the Injury
done to my Reputation, by his slande∣rous
Sermon, I appeal now to the wor∣shipful
<HI>Societys</HI> for Reformation of Man∣ners;
to whom, and to other Civil Ma∣gistrates,
I hope his Sermon, without
Reason, will be a Caution, that no Pulpit-Invective
move them to prosecute or
think the worse of any Author.</P>
<P>Liberty of thinking, writing and judg∣ing
for our selves in Religion is a natural,
a Christian, and a protestant <HI>Right.</HI> It is
a <HI>Right</HI> that the Magistrate as well as the
Subject are interested in, and are to see
to the Conservation of, or their Under-standings
as well as their Purses will be
ridden and oppress'd by an ignorant and
tyrannical Priesthood. I urge not this
for my own security against Prosecution
for Infidelity and Blasphemy, declaring
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
that if the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> St. <HI>Da∣vids,</HI>
or <HI>Arch-Deacon Stubbs,</HI> who are
zealous for Persecution, will but engage
me on the Stage of Controversy, and
make good their Accusations against me,
I will submit to the worst Punishment,
that can be inflicted on the worst Offen∣der.</P>
<P>In the mean time I will go on with
my Undertaking, to the advancement of
Truth, and demonstration of the <HI>Messiah∣ship</HI>
of the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI> to whom be
Glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
