<L>BOAST of proud Shropshire, Oxford's lasting shame,</L>
<L>Whom none but Coxcombs scorn, but Fools defame,</L>
<L>Eternal war with dulness born to wage,</L>
<L>Thou Paracelsus of this wondrous age;</L>
<L>BEDDOES, the philosophic Chymist's Guide,</L>
<L>The Bigot's Scourge, of Democrats the Pride;</L>
<L>Accept this lay; and to thy Brother, Friend,</L>
<L>Or name more dear, a Sans Culotte attend,</L>
<L>While in Rhyme's Galligaskins I enclose</L>
<L>The broad posteriors of thy brawny prose,</L>

And sing, by thee inspir'd, in tuneful strain,</L>
<L>The blest return of Saturn's golden reign!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh had I, silly swain, the force and fire</L>
<L>Of some, whom Frenchmen's bloody deeds inspire;</L>
<L>Could I, ascending on the wing of sound,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the grand, the lofty and profound,</L>
<L>Rise above mortal ken in rapturous glow,</L>
<L>Leaving poor pursy Sense to pant below;</L>
<L>Could I, for ever studious to refine,</L>
<L>Prank with my pearly phrase each pretty line,</L>
<L>Or like an empty Bottle, deep immers'd,</L>
<L>Whence Bubbles after Bubbles bustling burst,</L>
<L>Amus'd to view my noisy nothings swell,</L>
<L>In the sweet vanity of thought excel;</L>
<L>Now bursting o'er the bounds of vulgar Rhyme,</L>
<L>Gracefully great and terribly sublime;</L>
<L>Trolling in full-toned melody along</L>
<L>With all the clattering clang of modern song;</L>
<L>I'd hail the progress of those blissful days,</L>
<L>When fair Philosophy's meridian rays</L>

Shall brighten Nature's face, shall drive the Moles</L>
<L>Of blinking Error to their secret holes,</L>
<L>Disperse the darkness of primaeval Night,</L>
<L>And bid a new Creation rise to light!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed, great days! and bring, oh! bring to view</L>
<L>Things strange to tell! Incredible, but true!</L>
<L>Behold, behold, the Golden Age appears:</L>
<L>Skip, skip, ye Mountains! Forests lend your Ears!</L>
<L>See red-capt Liberty from heaven descend,</L>
<L>And real Prodigies her steps attend!</L>

<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The renovation of the world under the benign influence of French Freedom has been long foretold by prophets of every description, by some who manufacture verses, others who manufacture cotton, by maudling Mrs's, and mincing Misses, by enlight∣ened Lawyers and more enlightened Physicians; but by none more fully expected, more ardently longed for, than by <HI>Dr. Beddoes</HI> and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Gentleman of Pembroke College, Oxford, to whom Dr. Beddoes addresses a late elaborate work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> appellation</NOTE> his "<HI>Dear Giddy!</HI>" The great Dr. assures us, that not only science in general will shortly advance towards perfection, but that in particular "a new Medicine will arise from the ashes of the old with healing in its wings." How this revolution is to be effected we are informed in the dedication of his Observations on Calculus, &amp;c. p. 4. "We are just beginning to catch a glimpse of the laws of animal Nature; <HI>and now when the human mind seems in so many countries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be roused from that torpor, by which it has so long been benumbed, we may reason∣ably indulge the expectation of a rapid progress in this the most beneficial of all the sciences.</HI> An infinitely small portion of genius has hitherto been exerted to diminish the sum of our painful sensations; <HI>and the force of society has been exclusively at the disposal of Des∣pots and Juntos, the great Artificers of human Evil. Should an entire change in these two respects any where take place, every member of society might soon expect to experience in his own person the consequence of so happy an innovation; and should the example be generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there is no improvement in the condition of the World, for which we might not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the bloodless rivalship of Nations.</HI>" But we are told, that the same influence of Liberty and Genius will not only in other respects effect equal wonders, but produce greater blessings. "We know," exclaims this egregious Chymist, "that vegetables are capable of forming oils either exactly the same as those of Animals, or very nearly resembling them. Thus we have the suet of the Croton Sebiferum, the butter of the Phoenix Dactylifera and of the Butyrum Cacao. <HI>When, from a more intimate acquaint∣ance with them, we shall be better able to apply the Laws of organic bodies to the accommo∣dation as well as preservation of Life, may we not, by regulating the vegetable functions, teach our woods and hedges to supply us with Butter and Tallow?</HI>" Observations on Calculus, &amp;c. p. 109.</NOTE> No more the lazy Ox shall gormandize,</L>

"Nor, however remote Medicine may be at present from such perfection, do I see any reason to doubt, that by taking advantage of various and continual acces∣sions as they accrue to Science, the same power may be acquired over living as is at present exercised over some inanimate bodies; and that not only the cure and preven∣tion of diseases, but <HI>the art of protracting the fairest season of Life, and rendering Health more vigorous,</HI> will one day half realize the dream of Alchemy!" <HI>Beddoes's Letter to Darwin,</HI> p. 29.</NOTE> To ages shall extend Life's lengthen'd span.</L>
