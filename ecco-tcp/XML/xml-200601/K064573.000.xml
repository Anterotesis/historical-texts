<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in God
<HI>THOMAS,</HI>
Lord BISHOP of <HI>Bangor.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hatever we poor <HI>Au∣thors</HI>
may sometimes
pretend to, by the De∣dication
of our Works
to <HI>Great</HI> Men; it's cer∣tain
we aim at nothing less than Re∣wards
we deserve them or not: That this
is my Design in <HI>Dedications,</HI> is so
apparent, that it's to no Purpose to
deny or dissemble it.</P>
<P>Wherefore else have I made
Choice of some of our Learned and
Wealthy <HI>Bishops</HI> for the Patrons of
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
these <HI>Discourses,</HI> which I foresaw
would be grateful to their nice and
critical Palates? Wherefore else
have I been so profuse of such Com∣pliments
on their <HI>Lordships,</HI> as I
was sure, they would take great
Pleasure in? Wherefore else, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> do I inscribe <HI>this</HI> to your
<HI>Right Reverend</HI> Name, but that I
expect your Approbation of it, and</P>
<P>Some, who are envious, <HI>My Lord,</HI>
of my good Fortune in <HI>Episcopal</HI> Pa∣trons,
will not believe that I have
receiv'd so much as one <HI>Purse</HI> of
<HI>Gold</HI> for any of my <HI>Dedications</HI>; but
I would have such Malignants to
know, that the less I have receiv'd,
the more there is behind: And I
can moreover assure them, that
their <HI>Lordships</HI> have it in their Heads
and their Hearts too, highly to ad∣vance
me in the World; and if their
Endeavours for my Promotion fail
not, I shall be a very <HI>Great</HI> Man.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Such primitive Doctrine, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> as I have reviv'd, must, in the
Judgment of our <HI>Bishops,</HI> be deserv∣ing
of their distinguish'd Favours:
And if they should Design for me
such a <HI>mystical</HI> Crown of Glory, as
the <HI>Gentile Priests</HI> help'd some of
the Fathers of the Church to; I
profess without Dissimulation, that,
for all my Love to <HI>Mysteries,</HI> it will
be more than I am ambitious of:
But if the Honour is forc'd on me,
it will be my Duty to their <HI>Lord∣ships,</HI>
to sound an <HI>allegorical</HI> Trum∣pet
of their Fame, that their
Names, which might otherwise be
soon forgotten, may be everlasting∣ly
remember'd for their Love and
Good-will towards me.</P>
<P>But the chief Foundation, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> of my Merits lies, they say,
in my Treatment of the Miracles
of our Saviour, after the Manner
you handled a Scripture-Prophecy,
of a <HI>Man's kicking a Serpent on the
Pate, for biting him by the Heels</HI>:
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
And if your <HI>Lordship</HI> got a <HI>Welsh-Bishoprick</HI>
upon it, what may not I
expect for my more meritorious
Works of the same kind? The
Great <HI>Mr. Scheme</HI> has celebrated
your Praise for that Effort of your
Wit: And I must needs say, to your
<HI>Lordship</HI>'s Applause, that were not
your Thoughts unhappily shackled
with Interest and Subscriptions, (an
Unhappiness you sadly lament!)
you would endeavour to make as
pleasant Work with the <HI>Letter</HI> of
the <HI>Old,</HI> as I can do with that of
the <HI>New</HI> Testament.</P>
<P>I have not here Room, <HI>My Lord,</HI>
for a sufficient and deserv'd <HI>Enco∣mium</HI>
on your <HI>Use and Intent of Pro∣phecy</HI>;
therefore must be content to
say of it, in short, that it is a most
curious Piece of, what the Fathers
call, <HI>Engastromuthism</HI>; or such a
singular Specimen of a Webb, spun
out of a Man's own Bowels, as one
of fewer Brains in his Head can
hardly equal.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
It was wisely done of your <HI>Lord∣ship</HI>
to caution your Readers against
taking your <HI>Book</HI> for an Answer to
Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI>; otherwise it had not
been impossible, but some others as
well as the <HI>Worshipful Benchers</HI> of
the <HI>Temple</HI> might have mistaken
the <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Intent</HI> of it.</P>
<P>After I had gone thro' your <HI>beau∣tifully-printed</HI>
Work, I wish'd, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> for another <HI>Decoration</HI> of it,
that some Annotations out of the
Fathers had been subjoin'd to it.
How would your Notions then and
Theirs about Prophecy have stood
as a <HI>Foil</HI> to each other! How
should I then have admired the
Difference between a <HI>Rich</HI> Bishop
and a <HI>Poor</HI> Father as to Wit and
Sense! How should I then have
contemplated the Usefulness of Ec∣clesiastical
Wealth in our <HI>Clergy</HI> for
the Understanding of the Inspira∣tions
of the poor old Prophets!</P>
<P>When your <HI>Lordship</HI> is call'd upon
for another Edition of your <HI>Book,</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
vouchsafe me the Favour of ma∣king
some marginal Remarks on it,
which shall not be without their
good Use. As you know, savoury
Sawce makes some sort of Food go
down the better; so a little more
of that Salt, which Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has
too sparingly sprinkled on your
<HI>Work,</HI> will give your <HI>Readers,</HI> a
right Relish of it: But whether I
am indulg'd this Favour or not; I
shall take another opportunity, ac∣cording
to Promise elsewhere made,
of testifying to the World, how
much I am,</P>

<HEAD>A FIFTH
DISCOUsRSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ccording to Promise in my
last <HI>Discourse,</HI> I am in <HI>this</HI>
to take into Examination
the three Miracles of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
raising the dead, <HI>viz.</HI> Of
<HI>Iairus</HI>'s Daughter <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. Mark v. Luke viii.</NOTE>; of
the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Luke vii.</NOTE>; and of
<HI>Lazarus</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">John xi.</NOTE>: The literal Stories of which
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
I shall show to consist of Absurdities, Im∣probabilities
and Incredibilities, in Order
to the mystical Interpretation of them:
And because some of our <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Cler∣gy</HI>
were a little disgusted at the ludicrous
Treatment of the <HI>Letter</HI> of some foregoing
Miracles, I will handle these with the
more Caution; being as unwilling, as any
Man of my primitive Faith can be, to
offend weak Brethren.</P>
<P>Whether <HI>Jesus</HI> rais'd any more from the
dead, besides the foresaid three Persons is
uncertain from the Evangelical History.
St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Quot autem mortuos visibiliter suscitaverat quis novit? non enim omnia quae fecit scripta sunt. <HI>Jo∣hannes</HI> hoc dicit, multa alia fecit Jesus, quae si scripta essent, arbitror totum Mundum non posse Libros capere. Multi ergo sunt alii sino dubio suscitati, sed non frustra tres commemorati. <HI>In Serm.</HI> xcviii.</NOTE> thinks, he rais'd many
others; and he founds his Opinion on the
modest <HI>Hyperbole</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> who sup∣poses
 <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 25.</NOTE> <HI>the World it self could not con∣tain
the Books that might be Written of Je∣sus.</HI>
And <HI>Eusebius Gallicanus,</HI> of whose
Mind entirely I am, says <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Non autem vacat a Mysterio, quod, cum plur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Dominus suscitaverat, tres tantum Evangelistae eum sus∣citasse scripserunt. <HI>In Homil. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quintae post Domi∣nic. </HI>4<HI>tam.</HI></NOTE> the Reason
lies in the Mystery, why these <HI>three,</HI> and
no more than these <HI>three</HI> Miracles of this
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
Kind are recorded by the <HI>Evangelists.</HI> But
since our <HI>Divines</HI> are averse to Mysteries on
Miracles, I would gladly know their Opi∣nion,
whether <HI>Jesus</HI> rais'd any others from
the dead, or not: I have made some search
into modern Writers for their Opinion in
this Case, but can't find it: And unless
I knew their Opinion, it would be lost
Labour to argue against either Side of the
Question, and much more against both
Sides of it: But I can assure our <HI>Divines,</HI>
that, which Side of the Question soever
they should hold, the Consequence upon
the Argument would be neither better nor
worse, than that they must of necessity
espouse the mystical and allegorical Inter∣pretation
of these Miracles, or grant that
<HI>Jesus</HI> literally rais'd none from the dead
at all.</P>
<P>But waving that sort of Argument for
the present against the <HI>Letter</HI>; these three
Miracles are reputed the greatest that <HI>Jesus</HI>
wrought: And I believe, it will be
granted on all hands, that the restoring a
Person, indisputably dead, to Life again,
is a stupendous Miracle; and that two or
three such Miracles well circumstanced,
and credibly reported, are enough to con∣ciliate
the Belief of Mankind, that the
Author of them was a divine Agent, and
invested with the Power of God, or he
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
could not do them. But God knows, (and
for the sake of the Mystery, I am not
sorry to say it) this is far from being the
Case of these three Miracles before us, or
of any one them.</P>
<P>That these three Miracles are not equal∣ly
great, but differ in Degree, is visible
enough to any one, that but cursorily reads,
and compares theirs Stories one with ano∣ther.
The Fathers of the Church <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Suscitaverat Dominus filiam Jairi Principis Syna∣gogr, sed adhuc mediante morte, adhuc viante Spiritu, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>huc Anima Claustra Tartari nesciente. Suscitavit &amp; unicum Matris filium, sed sic ut retineret Pheretrum, ut anticiparet Sepulchrum, ut Corruptionem suspenderet, &amp; praeven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ret faetorem; ut ante mortuo Vitam redderet, quam tota mortuus jura Mortis intraret. Circa Lazarum vero quod geritur totum singulare est, quem circa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mortis impleta est. <HI>In Pet. Chrysol. Serm.</HI> lxiii.</NOTE>
have taken Notice of such a Difference
amongst them. The greatest of the three,
and indeed, the <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Inter omnia Miracula quae fecit Dominus noste. Jesu Christus, Lazari Resurrectio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>praecipue praedicatur. <HI>St. August. in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> greatest Miracle, that
<HI>Jesus</HI> is suppos'd to have wrought, is that
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection; which, in
Truth, was a most prodigious Miracle, if
his Corps was putrified and stank; or if
there were no just Exceptions to be made
to the Credibility of the Story. Next to
that, in magnitude, is <HI>Jesus</HI>'s raising of
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
the Widow's Son, as they were carrying
him to his Burial: And a great Miracle it
was to bring him to Life again; if none be∣fore
or since had been mistaken for dead,
and carried to their Graves alive; or if
no Impostor and his Confederates could
frame such a seemingly miraculous Scene,
as is that whole Story, to his own Glory.
The least of the three is that of his raising
<HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, which in Appearance
is so far from a Miracle, that according to
the Story itself, she was but asleep, or by
the Shrieks of By-standers frighted out of
her Senses for the present.</P>
<P>But however it really might be with
these three supposed dead and revived Per∣sons;
the Case of none of them was well
enough circumstanced to serve the Purpose
of our <HI>Divines.</HI> I am apt to believe with
the Fathers, that <HI>Jesus</HI> actually did raise
the dead; but then, as these Miracles are
only recorded for the sake of the <HI>Mystery,</HI>
I affirm that none of them, as to the
<HI>Letter,</HI> will abide the Test of a critcal
Examination, nor stand its Ground against
such Exceptions as may be made to them.
If <HI>Jesus</HI> was to raise any dead Bodies to
Life, for a Testimony of his divine Power
and Authority, he would and should have
made Choice of other dead Persons, un∣der
other Circumstances of Death; and
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
the History of their Resurrection should
have been more credibly and carefully
transmitted to Posterity, so as there should
have been no Room left to make a reasona∣ble
Doubt of the Truth of it. But this,
I say, is not the Case in the Resuscitation
of any of these Persons, as will appear
from the following Remarks and Obser∣vations
upon them. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Observe, that the unnatural and pre∣posterous
Order of Time, in which these
Miracles are related, justly brings them all
under suspicion of Fable and Forgery.
The greatest of the three is indisputably
that of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection; but since
this is only mention'd by St. <HI>John,</HI> who
wrote his Gospel after the other <HI>Evange∣lists,</HI>
and above sixty Years, according to
the best Computation, after our Lord's
Ascension; here is too much Room for
Cavil and Question, whether this Story be
not entirely his Invention. What could
be the Reason that <HI>Matthew,</HI><HI>Mark,</HI> and
<HI>Luke,</HI> who all wrote their Gospels before
<HI>John,</HI> and many Years nearer to the
Death of our Saviour, should omit to re∣cord
this remarkable and most illustrious
Miracle of <HI>Lazarus?</HI> They could not for∣get
it, nor be ignorant of it, if the Story
had been really true: and to assign any
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
other Reason than Ignorance or Forgetful∣ness,
is hard and impossible. To aggran∣dize
the Fame of their Master, for a Worker
of Miracles, was the Design of all the <HI>Evan∣gelists,</HI>
especially of the three first, who
may be presumed to make a Report of
the greatest, if not of all, that <HI>Jesus</HI>
wrought: But that there should come
after them an <HI>Evangelist</HI> with an huge and
superlatively great Miracle, and meet with
Credit for it, is against all Sense and Rea∣son;
neither is there any Story, so disor∣derly
told, in all History, that <HI>Critics</HI> will
admit of the Belief of. The first Writer
of the Life of an <HI>Hero,</HI> to be sure makes
mention of all the grand Occurrences of
it, and leaves no Room for <HI>Biographers</HI> af∣terwards,
but to enlarge and paraphrase
upon what he has written, with some
other Circumstances and Additions of less
Moment. If a third or a fourth <HI>Biogra∣pher</HI>
after him shall presume to add a more
illustrious Transaction of the <HI>Hero</HI>'s Life,
it will be rejected as Fable and Romance,
tho' for no other Reason than this, that the
first Writer must have been appris'd of it,
and would have inserted its Story, if there
had been any Truth in it. And whether
St. <HI>John</HI>'s Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection,
that Miracle of Miracles, ought not to be
subjected to the like Criticism upon it,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<HI>Christians</HI> may consider, and <HI>Infidels</HI> will
judge.</P>
<P>What then was the Reason, I ask again,
that the three first <HI>Evangelists</HI> neglected to
record this renown'd Miracle of <HI>Lazarus?</HI>
And why too (may I enquire here) did
not <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> mention the Story
of the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, as they
could not but know of it, if true, more
certainly than <HI>Luke,</HI> the Companion of
<HI>Paul,</HI> who alone has made a Report of
it? <HI>Grotius</HI> says, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Mirum videri potest Historiam hanc tam illustrem a Matthae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> &amp; Marco omissam. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>it may seem strange
that this illustrious Miracle of the Widow's
Son</HI> was omitted by <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI>:
And what is the Reason that <HI>Grotius</HI> gives
for this strange Omission? Why, he tells
us <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Sed videtur mihi horum uter{que} contentus fui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> uno Exemplo redditae Vitae in Jairi filia ex quo similia alia possunt intelligi. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that these two Evangelists were
content with one miraculous Instance of this
Kind, by which Christians might judge of</HI>
Jesus'<HI>s Power in others also.</HI> And is this
Reason sufficient? True it is, they were
content with one Instance; but if they
had made a Report of two or three more
of the same sort, no body would have
thought their History of <HI>Christ</HI> overcharg'd
with impertinent and tautological Repeti∣tions.
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
But one Instance of a Person rais'd
from the dead, they were, says <HI>Grotius,</HI>
content with: And I'll grant one to be
sufficient: But which then should they, as
wise and considerate <HI>Historians</HI> have made
Choice of, the greatest or the least Mira∣cle?
The greatest, to be sure, and that
was of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> or of the Widow's Son,
if they knew of either. But instead of ei∣ther
of these, they tell us the Story of <HI>Jai∣rus</HI>'s
Daughter, that is <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Nondum perfecta Mors est in Puella. <HI>St. August.</HI> in Serm. xcviii.</NOTE> an imperfect
and disputable Miracle, in Comparison of
the other two, which consequently they
knew nothing at all of, or they would have
preferr'd the Report of them.</P>
<P>If <HI>Matthew,</HI> the first Writer, had re∣corded
only the Story of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> whose
Resurrection was the greatest Miracle;
and if <HI>Luke</HI> had added <HI>that</HI> of the Wi∣dow
of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son; and <HI>John</HI> lastly had
remember'd us of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, which
the other <HI>Evangelists,</HI> not through Igno∣rance
or Forgetfulness, but studying Bre∣vity,
had omitted, then all had been
well; and no Objection had hence lain
against the Credit of any of these Mira∣cles,
or against the Authority of the <HI>E∣vangelists:</HI>
But this unnatural and pre∣posterous
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
Order of Time, in which these
Miracles are recorded (the greatest being
postponed to the least) administers just
Occasion of suspicion of the Truth and
Credibility of all their Stories. And it is
lucky for Christianity, that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>In∣fidels</HI>
have not hitherto hit upon the <HI>Absur∣dity</HI>
of this preposterous Narration, or
they might have form'd a cogent Ob∣jection
against these Miracles thus, say∣ing;</P>
<P>"<HI>Jesus,</HI> it is manifest, rais'd not the
dead at all. The only Person, that
Christians can reasonably pretend, he
did raise, was <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, whom
<HI>Matthew</HI> writes of; and she, according
to the Story was only in a Sleep, or an
Extacy, when <HI>Jesus</HI> revived her. But
the <HI>Galileans,</HI> who were after a Time
call'd <HI>Christians,</HI> finding their Account
in a Resurrection-Miracle; <HI>Luke,</HI> for
the former Advantage of the Cause, de∣vised
another Story of better Circum∣stances,
in the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son:
But this not being so great a Miracle, as
the Church still wanted; <HI>John,</HI> when
no body was alive to contradict and ex∣postulate
with him for it, trumps up a
long Story of a thumping Miracle, in
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s raising of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who had
been not only dead, but buried so long
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
that he stank again. But to prove the
Story of this Miracle to be false and fa∣bulous,
we need say no more than that
it was last recorded. If there had been
any Truth in it, the first <HI>Evangelist</HI>
would have remember'd us of it.</P>
<P>"We don't suppose, that you Christians,
because of your Prejudices, will sub∣scribe
to this Account, that we thus
give of the Rise of these Miracles: But
this is certain, that if these three Mira∣cles
had not been reported of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
but of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in the same disorder of
Time, by three different Historians,
you would presently have scented the
Forgery and Imposture: You would
justly have affirm'd that the three Stories
were apparently three Fables and Fals∣hoods;
and that the three Historians
visibly strove to outstretch each other:
That the <HI>first</HI> was sparing and modest in
his Romance; and the <HI>second,</HI> being sen∣sible
of the Insufficiency of the former's
Tale, devises a Miracle of a bigger
Size; which still not proving sufficient to
the End proposed; the <HI>third</HI> Writer,
rather than his Prophet's Honour should
sink for want of a Resurrection-Miracle,
forges a Story of a monstrously huge
one; against which it is, and always will
be Objection enough, that it was not
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
related by the first Historian. So would
you Christians argue against these three
Miracles in another Impostor's Case;
and there is not a judicious <HI>Critic</HI> in the
Universe, that would not approve of
the Argument, and applaud the Force
of it, tho' you will not endure the
Thoughts of it in the Case of your
<HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>"But to come nearer home to you;
supposing <HI>John</HI> (who was then above a
Hundred, and in his Dotage) had not
reported this Miracle of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; but
that <HI>Clement</HI> (joining it with his <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">In Epist. prima ad Corinth. Cap. xxv.</NOTE> in∣credible
Story of the Resurrection of a
<HI>Phaenix</HI>) or <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or <HI>Polycarp,</HI> or the
Author of the <HI>Apostolical Constitutions</HI>
had related it; would not your Chris∣tian
<HI>Critics</HI> have been at work to ex∣plode
it? There is not an antient extra∣evangelical
Tradition of any Note about
<HI>Jesus,</HI> that some or other of your <HI>Cri∣tics</HI>
have not boggled at; but such a
Story as this of <HI>Lazarus</HI> would have
been received by none. I question,
whether Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> would not have
rejected the <HI>Constitutions</HI> upon such a
Story in them; or if his Fancy for some
other Things in them had overcome his
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
Reason against this; yet <HI>Bishop Small-broke,</HI>
who has written against the Ca∣nonicalness
of the <HI>Constitutions,</HI> with
his judicious Animadversions upon this
Story, would absolutely have over∣thrown
their Authority. And what
would he have said here? Not only
that the Miracle smells rankly of Forge∣ry
and Fraud, or the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> especi∣cially
<HI>Matthew,</HI> had never forgotten to
record it; but he would have reminded
us of intrinsic Notes (<HI>hereafter to be men∣tion'd</HI>)
of Absurdity, and Incredibility,
that would for ever have cashier'd the
Belief of it. And whether we <HI>Infidels</HI>
ought not to take the same Liberty to
criticize on <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel, which you
do on your Apostolical Fathers, who
wrote before him, let the impartial and
unprejudiced judge: If in justice we
ought to take it; we are sure we could
give two or three notable Reasons (but
that We will not now put Christians
out of Temper with them) why <HI>John</HI>
may be suspected of a Mistake or Fraud
in this Miracle, rather than any other
Christian Writer of the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second</HI>
Century."</P>
<P>To such an unhappy Objection, arising
from the unnatural and preposterous Order
of Time, in which they are recorded,
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
are these three Miracles before us obnoxi∣ous.
And I am thinking how Ministers of
the Letter will be able to get over it. As
for my self, who am for the mystical Inter∣pretation
of these Miracles, I have a solid
and substantial Answer at hand to the fore∣said
Objection, an Answer that curiously
accounts for the Order of Time in which
these Miracles are related; but my Answer

another good one of their own, that will

their Ministry.</P>

But how weak and insufficient both their
Solutions are, I will not spare Time to
consider, till some <HI>Writer</HI> shall appear in
Defence of the Sufficiency and Strength of
one or other of them. And so I pass to a</P>
<P N="2">2. Second Observation, by Way of Ob∣jection
to the <HI>Letter</HI> of these Miracles, and
that is, by enquiring, what became of
these three Persons after their Resurrection?
How long did they live afterwards? And
of what Use and Advantage were their
restored <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ives to the Church or to Man∣kind?
The Evangelical and Ecclesiastical
History is entirely silent as to these Ques∣tions,
which is enough to make us suspect
their Stories to be merely romantick or
parabolical; and that there were no such
Persons rais'd from the dead; or we must
have heard somewhat of their Station and
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
Conversation in the World afterwards.
It's true, that <HI>Ephiphanius</HI> <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Quin &amp; illud inter traditiones reperimus triginta tum Annos natum fuisse Lazaru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, cum a mortuis excitatus est; at{que} idem ille postea triginta aliis annis vixit. <HI>In Haeres.</HI> lxvi. <HI>Sect.</HI> 34.</NOTE> says, what
he found among Traditions, that <HI>Lazarus</HI>
lived thirty Years after his Resurrection:
But how did he spend his Time all that
while? Was it to the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
to the Service of the Church, and Proga∣gation
of the Gospel? Of that we know
nothing; tho in Reason and Gratitude to
<HI>Jesus,</HI> his Benefactor, it ought to have
been so spent; and if it had been so em∣ploy'd,
History surely would have inform'd
us of it. According to the Opinion of
<HI>Grotius,</HI> in a Citation above, <HI>Lazarus</HI> for
the rest of his restored Life absconded, and
skull'd about the Country for Fear of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who lay in Wait for him; which is
a Suggestion, not only dishonourable to
<HI>Jesus,</HI> as if the same Power, that rais'd
him from the dead, could not protect him
against his Enemies; but reproachful to
<HI>Lazarus</HI> himself, who should have chosen
to suffer Death again, rather than not bear
an open Testimony to <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Author
of his Resurrection. However it was, we
hear no more of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> than that he
lived thirty Years afterwards, which Tra∣dition,
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
without other Memorials of his
Life, brings the Miracle more under suspi∣cion
of Fable, than if he had dy'd soon
after it. And of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and of
the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, which is asto∣nishing,
we read nothing at all. Does not
this Silence in History about them, make
their Miracles questionable, and but like
<HI>Gulliverian</HI> Tales of Persons and Things,
that out of the Romance, never had any
Being.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI> did but <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>call a little Child, and
set him in the midst</HI> of his Disciples; and
that Act was remember'd in the Piety and
Zeal <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">In Nicephor. Callist. Eccl. Hist. L. ii. c. 35.</NOTE> of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> who made a re∣nown'd
Bishop. But the Favour and Bles∣sing
conferr'd on these three rais'd Persons
was exceedingly greater; and one might
have expected, that <HI>Lazarus</HI> and the Wi∣dow's
Son would have been eminent Mi∣nisters
of the Gospel. But instead of that,
their Lives afterwards were pass'd in Ob∣scurity,
or, what's as bad, Ecclesiastical
History has neglected a Report of them.
What can any one hereupon think less,
than that the Favour of the Miracles was
lost on undeserving Persons, which I ab∣hor
the Thoughts of; or that their Stories
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
are but Parables, which I rather incline to.</P>
<P>Ministers of the <HI>Letter</HI> may here say,
"That the Ecclesiastical History of the A∣postolical
Age is very scanty; and that
many Memorials of other Persons and
Transactions are lost and buried in Ob∣livion:
Which unhappy Fate has at∣tended
the after-Lives and Actions of
these rais'd Persons, or undoubtedly we
should have had a famous Record of
them." This is not impossible; tho'
in the Wisdom of Providence it is hardly
probable, but that some more Remem∣brance
must have been left of one or o∣ther,
if not of all the three Persons; in as
much as such a Remembrance of them
would now-a-days have no less gain'd a
Belief of the Miracles, than this Historical
Silence tends to the Discredit of them.</P>
<P>It's somewhat strange, that we hear no
more of the after-Fame and Life of any
of the diseased Persons, whom <HI>Jesus</HI> mi∣raculously
cured; excepting of the Wo∣man,
heal'd of an Issue of Blood; who,
tho' she <HI>spent</HI> ALL <HI>she had, even</HI> ALL
<HI>her Living</HI> upon <HI>Physicians</HI>; yet out of
the Remains of it erected, says <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">In Eccl. Hist. L. vii. c. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Eu∣sebius,</HI>
at <HI>Caesarea Philippi,</HI> two most cost∣ly
Statues of Brass, to the Memory of
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> and of herself, and of the Miracle
wrought by him; which Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">In Loc. Matthaei.</NOTE>
as if he was tainted with Infidelity, endea∣vours
to make an idle Tale of. But ex∣cepting,
I say this Story of this Woman,
we hear nothing of any other heal'd Per∣son;
which is Matter of some Specula∣tion:
But that the Persons rais'd from
the dead should not at all be mention'd
in History for their Labours and Lives
afterwards to the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> is ab∣solutely
unaccountable. Whether such a
profound Silence in History about them be
not shocking of the Credit of the Mira∣cles,
let our <HI>Divines</HI> consider. I am of
Opinion that if <HI>Jesus</HI> really rais'd these Per∣sons
from the dead; this and no other Rea∣son,
in the Providence of God, can be gi∣ven
for the Silence of Ecclesiastical Histo∣ry
about them afterwards, than to make
<HI>dead-letter'd</HI> Stories of their Miracles, in
order to turn our Heads entirely to the
Consideration of their mystical Significa∣tion,
without which the <HI>Letter,</HI> for the
Argument before us, is deserving of no
Regard nor Credit. But</P>
<P N="3">3. By way of Objection to the <HI>Letter</HI>
of these three Miracles, let us consider the
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
Condition of the Persons rais'd from the
dead; and whether they were at all pro∣per
Persons for <HI>Jesus</HI> to work such a Mi∣racle
upon, in Testimony of his divine
Power. If they were improper Persons
according to the <HI>Letter,</HI> it's not credible
that He, who was the Wisdom of God,
would raise them; or if he did, it was
because they were the properest to make
mystical Emblems of their Stories.</P>
<P>That <HI>Jesus</HI> ought to have rais'd all that
dy'd, where-ever he came, during the
Time of his Ministry, none, I presume,
can hold. Two or three Instances of his
almighty and miraculous Power of this
Kind will be allow'd to be sufficient:
But then they must be wisely and judici∣ously
made Choice of, out of a vast Num∣ber
of Persons, that must needs die in
that Time. Where then was his Wisdom
and Prudence to chuse these three Persons
above others to that Honour? Why were
all of them, or indeed any one of them
preferr'd to other Persons of a different
Age and Condition in the World? Nay,
if the <HI>Letter</HI> of their Stories is only to be
regarded, were not all these three Per∣sons
almost the improperest and most un∣fit
of any for <HI>Jesus</HI> to exercise that Power
on?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="28"/>
<HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter was an insignificant
<HI>Girl</HI> of twelve Years old: And there
could be no Reason for raising her, but to
wipe Sorrow from the Hearts, and Tears
from the Eyes of her Parents, who ought
to have been better Philosophers, than im∣moderately
to grieve for her. And was
here a good Reason for <HI>Jesus</HI> to interpose
with his Almighty Powe? No certainly;
a Lecture of Patience and Resignation in
this Case had been enough. And tho
<HI>Jesus</HI> could raise her from the dead; yet
for as much as that Favour was to be con∣ferr'd
but on a few; and his Miracles
ought to be useful as well as conspicuous,
she should have been pass'd by, as an im∣proper
Object of his Power, in Compari∣son
of many others, presently to be na∣med.
If therefore a better Reason, than
what's discernible in the <HI>Letter,</HI> is not to
be fetch'd from the Mystery; I can't sup∣pose
that <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Wisdom of God would
raise this <HI>Girl</HI>; but that the modern Be∣leif
of her Resuscitation, exclusive of the
mystical Signification, is, as shall be by and
by argued, altogether groundless.</P>
<P>The Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son too was
but a <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Youth,</HI> and whether any
thing older than the <HI>Girl</HI> above is doubt∣ful;
but his Life certainly was of no
more Importance to the World after, than
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
before his Resurrection. And why was
he then one of the <HI>three</HI> to be rais'd from
the dead? Why had he this Honour done
him, before others of greater Age, Worth,
and Use to MankInd? Some will say, for
the Comfort of his sorrowful Mother.
And is this Reason sufficient? A Discourse
on the Pleasures of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bosom,
where she would e'er long meet her Son,
had been enough to chear her Heart. If
therefore the Fathers don't help me to a
solid mystical Reason, why the Son and
<HI>only Son</HI> of a Widow was to be rais'd by
<HI>Jesus,</HI> as they were carrying him to his Bu∣rial,
I'll not believe, He would raise this
dead <HI>Boy</HI> rather than many others, for the
Manifestation of his Power; but that the
Story of his Resurrection, as shall soon be
reasonably proved, was all Sham and Cheat.</P>
<P><HI>Lazarus</HI> indeed was <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Friend,
whom he Loved; and as I will not que∣stion
but <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Affection was wisely and
deservedly placed on him; so here, to
Appearance, was a better Reason for the
raising of him, than of either of the other
Two. But even this Reason, supposing
<HI>Jesus</HI> was to raise but three Persons, is
not sufficient against the Cases of many
others, that may be put for the Mani∣festation
of his Power, for the Illustration
of his Wisdom and Goodness, and for the
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
Conversion of Unbelievers: Consequently,
if this Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI> be not parabolical,
the litteral Fact is disputable, and obnoxi∣ous
to such Exceptions presently to be ob∣served
against it, as will not be easily got
over.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI> rais'd the dead, and wrought o∣ther
Miracles, say our <HI>Divines</HI> often, not
only to manifest his own Power and Glo∣ry,
but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good: For which
Reason his Miracles are useful and bene∣ficial
as well as stupendous and supernatu∣ral
Acts, on purpose to conciliate Men's
Affections as well as their Faith to him.
On this Topick our <HI>Divines</HI> are copious
and rhetorical, when they write on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Miracles, as if no more useful and won∣derful
Works could be done, than what
he did. And I do agree with them, that
(what Reason bespeaks) the Miracles of a
pretended Author of Religion ought to be
both as useful and great as well as could
be. But such were not <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles
according to <HI>Letter,</HI> and least of all his Acts
of raising the dead. For if we consider
the Persons rais'd by him, we shall find,
he could hardly have exerted his Power
on any of less Importance to the World,
both before and after their Resurrection.
A young <HI>Girl</HI> indeed is fitter to be rais'd
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
than a decripid old Woman, who by the
Course of Nature was to return to Cor∣ruption
again, as soon as restored to Life:
And a <HI>Boy</HI> rather than an infirm old Man
for the same Reason: And <HI>Lazarus</HI> the
Friend of <HI>Jesus,</HI> perhaps, and but perhaps,
rather than his profess'd Enemy. But
what are these three Persons in Compari∣son
of many others of other Circum∣stances?
Instead of a <HI>Boy,</HI> and a <HI>Girl</HI> and
even of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who were all of no
Consequence to the Publick, either before
or since; I should think, <HI>Jesus</HI> ought to
have rais'd an useful Magistrate, whose
Life had beed a common Blessing; an in∣dustrious
Merchant, whose Death was a
publick Loss; a Father of a numerous
Family, which for a comfortable Subsist∣ance
depended on him. Such dead Ob∣jects
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Power and Compassion
could not but offer themselves, during the
Time of his Ministry, and if he meant to
be as useful as he could, in his Miracles,
he would have laid hold on them. If a
few Persons only were to be rais'd from
the dead, the foresaid were the properest,
whose Resurrection and Return to Life
would have begotten the Applause as well
as the Wonder of the World; would
most extensively have spread <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Fame;
and would have gain'd him the Love and
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
Discipleship of all that heard of his being
so great a Benefactor to Mankind. Such
Instances of his Power would have de∣monstrated
him to be a most benign as
well as a mighty Agent; and none in In∣terest
or Prejudice could have open'd their
Mouths against him, especially if the Per∣sons
rais'd from the dead were selected
upon the Recommendation of the People
of this or that City. But that an insigni∣ficant
<HI>Boy</HI> and a <HI>Girl,</HI> (forsooth!) and the
obscure <HI>Lazarus,</HI> are preferr'd by <HI>Jesus,</HI>
to such publick and more deserving Per∣sons
is unaccountable. Their Story there∣fore,
upon this Argument, savours of Ro∣mance
and Fraud; and unless the <HI>Mystery</HI>
help us to, what the <HI>Letter</HI> can't, a good
Reason for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Conduct here, the Mi∣racles
may be hence justly question'd, and
the Credibility of their Report disputed.</P>
<P>But now I am speaking of the Fitness
and Unfitness of deceased Persons to have
this grand Miracle wrought on them; it
comes into my Head to ask, why <HI>Jesus</HI>
rais'd not <HI>John</HI> the Baptist to Life again?
A Person of greater Merits, and more
worthy of the Favour of <HI>Jesus</HI> and of
this Miracle, could not be. If <HI>Jesus</HI>
could raise any from the dead he would
surely have raised him; and why did he
not? This is a reasonable Question, and an
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
Answer should be thought on for it. Was
it a Thing out of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Power? Not so;
He was Omnipotent, and could by Force
or Persuasion have rescued <HI>John</HI>'s Head out
of the Hands of his Enemies; and the
tacking it again to his Body, and the infu∣sing
new Life into him was no more dif∣ficult
to <HI>Jesus,</HI> than the Resuscitation of a
stinking Carcass. If <HI>Jesus</HI> had here exer∣ted
his Power, and rais'd his dearest Friend
and choicest Minister for the Preparation,
if not Propagation of the Gospel, none
could question his Ability to raise any
others, tho he had rais'd no more. But
in as much as <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> one of his
singular Merits and Services to <HI>Christ,</HI> was
overlook'd and neglected by him; and
three useless and insignificant Persons had
this Honour done them, the Facts may rea∣sonably
be called into question, and, if
the Mysteries don't solve the Difficulty,
their litteral Stories may hence be account∣ed
foolish, fictitious and fabulous; especi∣ally
if we consider,</P>
<P N="4">4. That none of these three rais'd Per∣sons
had been long enough dead to ampu∣tate
all Doubt of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s miraculous
Power in their Resurrection. As to <HI>Jairus</HI>'s
Daughter, she was but newly expired, if
at all dead, when <HI>Jesus</HI> brought her to
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
Life again. <HI>Jesus</HI> himself says, she was
but asleep. And according to <HI>Theophanes
Cerameus</HI> <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Puellam ex illo Tumultu plangentium stupore cor∣reptam esse, non vero defunctam. <HI>In Homil. de Juri filia.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Theophilact</HI> <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">In Loc. Matthae.</NOTE> there
is Room to suspect that this <HI>Girl</HI> was only
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>beside herself.</HI> And it is not im∣possible,
but the passionate Skreams of the
Feminine By-standers might fright her into
Fits, that bore the Appearance of Death;
otherwise why did <HI>Jesus</HI> turn these inor∣dinate
Weepers out of the House, before
he could bring her to her Senses again? And
why did he tell her Parents, that she was
only in asleep, but to Comfort them with
the Possibility of his awakening her out of it?
Is not this destructive of the Miracle, and
making no more of it, than what another
Man might do? And is there not some
Probability, that here's all of this Story?
But supposing she was really dead, yet for
the sake of an indisputable Miracle in her
Resurrection, it must be granted, that she
ought to have been much longer, some
Days if not Weeks, dead and buried.</P>
<P>As to the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, there
was somewhat more of the Appearance of
Death in him, than in <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter.
He was carried forth to his Burial, and so
may be presumed to be really a dead
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
Corpse. But might not here be Fraud or
Mistake in the Case? History and com∣mon
Fame affords Instances of the mista∣ken
Deaths of Persons, who sometimes
have been unfortunately buried alive, and
at other Times happily, by one Means or
other, restored to Life: And who knows
but <HI>Jesus,</HI> upon some Information or
other, might suspect this Youth to be
in a lethargick State, and had a Mind to
try, if by chafeing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he could not do,
what successfully he did, bring him to his
Senses again: Or might not a Piece of
Fraud be here concerted between <HI>Jesus,</HI>
a subtil Youth, and his Mother and others;
and all the Formalities of a Death and Bu∣rial
contrived, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> whose Fame for
a Worker of Miracles was to be rais'd,
might here have an Opportunity to make a
shew of a grand one. The Mourning of
the Widow, who had her Tears at Com∣mand
and <HI>Jesus</HI>'s casual meeting of the
Corpse upon the Road, looks like Contri∣vance
to put the better Face upon the
Matter. God forbid, that I should sus∣pect,
there was any Fraud of this Kind
here; but of the Possibility of it, none
can doubt. And where there is a Pos∣sibility
of Fraud, it is Nonsense, and
mere Credulity to talk of a real, certain
and stupendous Miracle, especially where
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
the Juggler and pretended Worker of Mi∣racles
has been detected in some of his
other Tricks. All that I have to say here
to this Matter, is, that if <HI>Jesus</HI> had a
Mind to raise the Son of this Widow, in
Testimony of his divine Power, he should
have suffer'd him to have been buried two
or three Weeks first; otherwise, if the
Mystery don't account for <HI>Jesus</HI>'s stopping
the Bearers of the Corpse upon the Road,
here is too much Room for suspicion of
Cheat in the Letter of the Story.</P>
<P><HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Case seems to be the less excep∣tionable
of the three. He had been buried
<HI>four Days,</HI> and supposed to be putrified in
the Opinion of his Sister <HI>Mary,</HI> and of mo∣dern
Christians: And if so, his Resuscita∣tion
was a most grand and indisputable
Miracle. And I could have wish'd, if I
had not loved the <HI>Mystery</HI> rather than
the <HI>Letter,</HI> that no Cavil and Exception
could have been made to it. Whether <HI>La∣zarus,</HI>
who was <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Friend and beloved
Disciple, would not come into Measures
with his Lord, for the Defence of his Ho∣nour,
and Propagation of his Fame, <HI>Infi∣dels,</HI>
who take Christianity for an Impos∣ture,
will not question: And whether he
would not consent to be interr'd alive, in
a hollow Cave, where there was only a
Stone laid at the Mouth of it, as long as
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
a Man could fast, none of them will doubt.
Four Days was almost too long for a Man
to fast without danger of Health; but if
those <HI>four Days</HI> are number'd according to
the Arithmetick of Jesus'<HI>s three Days</HI> in his
Grave, they are reducible to two Days and
three Nights, which Time, if no Victuals
were secretly convey'd with him, a Man
might fast in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Cave. As to the
<HI>stinking</HI> of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Carcass: that, <HI>Infidels</HI>
will say, was but the Assertion of his Sister
beforehand, like a Prologue to a Farce.
None of the Spectators at his Resurrection
say one Word of his stinking. And as to
the Weepings and Lamentations of <HI>Jesus</HI>
and of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Sisters, they will say
that was all Sham and Counterfeit, the
better to carry on the Juggle of a feign'd
Resurrection. And what's worst of all,
they will say, that tho <HI>Jesus</HI> did call <HI>La∣zarus</HI>
forth with a <HI>loud Voice,</HI> as if he had
been as deaf as a dead Man; yet his <HI>Face
was bound about with a Napkin,</HI> so that
the Spectators could not discern what was
of the Essence of the Miracle, the Change
of his Countenance from a dead to a live
one, which is a plain Sign, that it was all
Fraud and Imposture.</P>
<P>God forbid, that I should have the same
sense with <HI>Infidels,</HI> of this Matter; but to
be just to their Suggestions and Imagina∣tions
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
here, I must needs say, there are some
other unhappy Circumstances, presently to
be consider'd, in this Story, which, if they
are not emblematical, make it the most
notorious Cheat and Imposture that ever
was put upon Mankind. In the mean
Time, from what is here argued, it is
plain, that <HI>Lazarus</HI> was not so long dead
and buried, as that there is no Room to
doubt of the Miracle of his Resurrection.</P>
<P>Now whether these Arguments against
these three Miracles, drawn from the
Shortness of the Time, in which these
Persons lay for dead, have any Force in
them, let our <HI>Divines</HI> consider. If no∣thing
of all this is in their Opinion affect∣ing
of the Credit of the Miracles; yet
they must allow, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> if he could
raise the dead, might have made Choice of
other Instances of Persons, more unquesti∣onably
dead, who had lain longer in their
Graves, and were in a visible State of Putre∣faction.
And if this grand Miracle of raising
the dead was to be wrought by <HI>Jesus</HI> for
the Manifestation of his Glory, and in
Testimony of his Authority; he should
have exercised his Power on some such
Persons, nominated by the Magistrates of
this or that City, who with the People
should be present at the miraculous Ope∣ration,
beholding the putrified Bodies,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
(without a Napkin before their Faces) and
how they were suddenly enliven'd and in∣vigorated
with new Flesh, after the Simi∣litude
of their pristine Form, when in
Health and full Strength. Because that <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
rais'd not some such Persons to Life,
I must take the Stories of the three Mira∣cles
before us to be but typical of more
mysterious Works; or believe them for
the Arguments above to be downright
Cheats and Fables. And what is enough
to induce a modern <HI>Divine</HI> to this Opini∣on.
Is</P>
<P N="5">5. The Consideration, that none of
these rais'd Persons did or could, after the
Return of their Souls to their Bodies, tell
any Tales of their separate Existence o∣therwise
the Evangelists had not been si∣lent
in this main Point, which is of the
Essence of Christianity. Are not our <HI>Di∣vines</HI>
here reduced to an unhappy <HI>Dilemma,</HI>
either to deny the separate Existence of the
Soul, or the precedent Deaths of these
rais'd Persons? As Christians, we profess
to believe both, which seemingly are in∣compatiable;
or the Evangelists had made
such a Relation, as their return'd Souls had
given of the other World. Was any Per∣son,
in this Age, to be rais'd to Life, that
had been any time dead; the first Thing
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
that his Friends and Acquaintance would
enquire of him, would be to know, where
his Soul had been; in what Company;
and how it had fared with him; and His∣torians
would certainly record his Narra∣tive.
The same Curiosity could not but
possess People of old, when these Miracles
were wrought; and if the rais'd Persons
had told any Stories of their separate Ex∣istance,
the Evangelists no less unques∣tionally
would have reported them, in as
much as such a Report would have been,
not only a Confirmation of that Doctrine,
which is of the Essence of our Religion; but
an absolute Confutation of the <HI>Sadducees</HI>
and <HI>Sceptists</HI> of that Age, and of the <HI>Ma∣terialists</HI>
of this. But this their Silence in
this Case is of bad Consequence, either to
the Doctrine of the Soul's Existence in Se∣paration
from the Body, or to these Mira∣cles
themselves, since we must hereupon
almost necessarily hold, that these rais'd
Persons were not at all dead, or that their
Souls dy'd with them.</P>
<P>The Author of a Sermon, ascrib'd to
St. <HI>Augustin</HI> tells us <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Atque ut miraculum divinae Virtutis accresce∣ret, dum Convivis interrogantibus tristia Loca paena∣rum, sedes{que} alta nocte semper obscuras, Lazarus indicat diligenti narratione per ordinem. Diu quaesiti longis{que} temporibus ignorati invenerunt tandem Inferi Prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>m. <HI>In Serm.</HI> cxvi. <HI>Append. St. August.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Lazarus</HI> af∣ter
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
his Resurrection made a large Report of
<HI>Hell,</HI> where he had been: But as this is a
mere Fiction of that Author, without the
least Authority from Scripture; so I pre∣sume
it will be accounted a <HI>Blunder</HI> in
him, to suppose the Soul of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the
Friend and beloved of <HI>Jesus,</HI> was in Hell.
The Soul of <HI>Jesus</HI> indeed, for Reasons best
known to himself, upon his Death, de∣scended
into Hell, when some think he
should rather have gone, with the penitent
Thief, into Paradise. But the Thoughts,
that any of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Friends should go to
Hell, I suppose will not be born with;
or what will become of the Preachers of
this Age, who would be accounted Men
of that Denomination. And if <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s
Soul had been in Paradise, it was hardly
a good Work in <HI>Jesus</HI> to recall it, for thir∣ty
Years afterwards, to the Miseries and
Troubles of this wicked World. I wish
therefore our <HI>Divines</HI> could determine,
where <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Soul was for the four
Days of his Burial; because I can't possi∣bly
conceive any thing else, than that he
was not really dead, or that his Soul dy'd
with him, or went to a bad place, other∣wise
after his Resurrection he had never
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
absconded for fear of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as if he
was unwilling to die again, and return to
the Place from whence he came.</P>
<P>But however it was with the Souls of
these rais'd Persons before their Re-union to
their Bodies, here is another Difficulty and
Objection against these Miracles; and how
will our <HI>Divines</HI> get over it? Perhaps they
may say, that tho' these rais'd Persons were
before really dead; yet their Souls were
not as yet gone to their Places prepared of
God for them, but continued hovering
about their Bodies, like the Flame about
the Snuff of a Candle, with desires
<Q><L>—iterum{que} reverti</L><L>Corpora—</L></Q>
to be again rejoin'd to them. And with∣all
my Heart let this Answer pass, if our
<HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> can so agree upon it. As
for my own Opinion, it is this, that these
Miracles of <HI>Jesus</HI> are Parables, and that it
was beside the Purpose of the Parable,
and of the <HI>Evangelists</HI> to say any thing of
the Place and State of the Soul upon
its Separation from the Body; otherwise
the Letter of their Stories is manifestly ob∣noxious
to the Objection above, or the
Deaths of these pretended rais'd Persons,
upon Christian Principles, are questionable.
But</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="36" REF="43"/>
6. And lastly, Let us consider the in∣trinsick
Absurdities and Incredibilities of
the several Stories of these three Miracles.
And such Absurdities shall we find in them,
that, if they had been intended as Testi∣monies
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s divine Power, had never
been inserted in their Narratives.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and her Resur∣rection
from the dead, St. <HI>Hilary</HI> <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Princeps hic, Lex esse intelligitur, quae Domi∣num orat pro Plebe, quam ipsa Christo praedicata ejus Adventus Expectatione nutriverat, ut Vi tam mortuae reddat. Nam nullum Principem credidisse legimus, ex quo Persona hujus principis orantis merito in Typum ap∣tabitur. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE>
hints, that there was no such Person as
<HI>Jairus</HI> whose Name was fictitious, and
coin'd with a spiritual Signification for the
Use of the Parable; and he gives this
Reason, and a good Reason it is, why he
thought so, because it is elsewhere <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">John vii. 48. and xii. 42.</NOTE>
intimated in the Gospel, that none of the
Rulers of the Synagogues confessedly be∣lieved
on <HI>Jesus.</HI> Is not here then a stum∣bling-Block
at the Threshold of the Let∣ter
of this Story? But why did <HI>Jesus</HI> say,
this Girl was but in a Sleep? If he was
going to work a Miracle in her Resuscita∣tion,
he should not have call'd Death,
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
<HI>Sleep</HI>; but if others had been of a contra∣ry
Opinion, he should first have convinced
them of the Certainty of her Death, be∣fore
he did the great Work on her. And
why did he charge the Parents of the Girl
not to speak of the Miracle? If he meant
it as a Testimony of his divine Power,
he should rather have exhorted them, in
justice to himself to publish it, and make
it well known. And why, as St. <HI>Ambrose</HI>
 <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Quae tamen tantae diversitatis Causa? Supra pub∣lice Viduoe filius suscitatur, hic removentur plures arbitri. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> puts the Question, did he turn the
People out of the House, before he would
raise her? The more Witnesses are pre∣sent
at a Miracle, the better it is attested,
and the more readily believed by others;
and who should be present at the Miracle
rather than those who were incredulous of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s divine Power? Are not all these
Circumstances, so many <HI>Absurdities,</HI> which,
if they are not to be accounted for in the
<HI>Mystery,</HI> are so far destructive of the <HI>Let∣ter,</HI>
as that it is Nonsense and Folly in our
<HI>Divines</HI> to talk of a Miracle here, against
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s express Word and Prohibition to
the contrary.</P>
<P>As to the Story of the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s
Son, excepting what is before observed of
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
the shortness of the Time, in which he lay
dead, and of the Unfitness of his Person
to be rais'd before an Husband and Father
of a Family, to the Comfort of his Wife
and Children, (which are enough to over∣throw
the Credility of the Miracle) I have
here no more Fault to find in the Letter
of it.</P>
<P>But the long Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI> is so brim∣ful
of Absurdities, that, if the Letter alone
is to be regarded; St. <HI>John,</HI> who was then
above a hundred, when he wrote it, had
lived beyond his Reason and Senses, or he
could not have committed them.</P>
<P>I have not Room here to make Remarks
on all these Absurdities, which would be
the Work of a Volume; but shall single
out three or four of them at present, re∣serving
the rest for another Opportunity,
when the whole Story of this Miracle will
appear to be such a Contexture of Folly
and Fraud in its Contrivance, Execution,
and Relation, as is not to be equall'd in
all Romantick History; and our <HI>Divines</HI>
will find themselves so distress'd upon the
Dissection and Display of it, as that they
must of Necessity allow this Story to be
but a Parable; or, what's most grievous
to think on, give up their Religion upon
it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46"/>
<HI>First</HI> then, observe that <HI>Jesus</HI> is said to
have <HI>wept.</HI> and <HI>groan'd</HI> for the Death of
<HI>Lazarus:</HI> But why so, says <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Qua igitur Ratione, qui tanta haec erat facturus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quod evenit, judicasset merito Lacrymis esse prosequen∣dum? <HI>In Homil. de Cratiarum Actione.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Basil?</HI>
Was not this an <HI>Absurdity</HI> to weep at all
for the Death of him, whom he could,
and was about to recover to Life again?
Another Man may as reasonably grieve
for the Absence of his Friend, whose Com∣pany
and Presence he can retrieve in an
Instant, as that <HI>Jesus</HI> should shed Tears
for <HI>Lazarus</HI> in this Case. If <HI>Jesus</HI> could
not or would not raise him from the dead,
he ought not, as a Philosopher, who knows
Man is born to die, to betray so much
Weakness as to weep for him. Patience
and Resignation unto God upon the Death
of our dearest Friends and Relations is
what all Philosophers have rightly taught;
and <HI>Jesus,</HI> one would think, should have
been the most Heroical Example of these
Graces; and how came he to fail of it
here? A Stoical Apathy had better be∣came
him than such childish and effemi∣nate
Grief, which not only makes him a
mean and poor-spirited Mortal; but is a
gross <HI>Absurdity</HI> and <HI>Incredibility</HI> upon Con∣sideration
of his Will and Power to fetch
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
<HI>Lazarus</HI> to Life again. If there be not,
according to the Fathers, Mystery in these
Tears of <HI>Jesus,</HI> they are a foolish and un∣natural
Prelude to a Farce, he was acting
in the pretended Resuscitation of <HI>Lazarus.</HI></P>
<P>Some antient Catholicks, not being ap∣prised
of the Mystery; were so offended
at these Words, <HI>Jesus wept,</HI> that, as <HI>Epi∣phanius</HI>
 <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lacrymatus est Jesus,</HI> quod aliquando erasum fu∣isse a Catholicis quibusdam scribit Epiphanius. Vid. <HI>Drusium in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> says, they expung'd them out
of their Bibles; and I wonder, they have
not, before now, disturb'd the Faith of
Ministers of the Letter, to the utter Re∣jection
of the Miracle.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Observe that <HI>John</HI> says, it was
with <HI>a loud Voice,</HI> that <HI>Jesus</HI> call'd <HI>Laza∣rus</HI>
forth out of his Cave. And why, I
pray, a louder Voice than ordinary? Was
dead <HI>Lazarus</HI> deafer than <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daugh∣ter,
or the Widow's Son? Or was his
Soul at so great a Distance from his Body,
as he could not hear a still and low Voice?
Some such silly Reason as <HI>this</HI> must be gi∣ven
for this <HI>loud Voice</HI> here; but how ab∣surd
it is according to the Letter, Infidels
will judge, till Christians can assign a bet∣ter.
The dead can hear the Whisper of
the Almighty, if Power go along with it,
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
as soon as the Sound of a Trumpet. St.
<HI>John</HI> then should not have written of a
<HI>loud Voice,</HI> unless he meant to adapt his
Story to the Capacities and Conceptions of
the Vulgar, who have no Apprehensions
of God's Power, out of sensible and hu∣man
Representations of it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because that a Miracle should
be well guarded against all Suspicion of
Fraud, I was thinking to make it an <HI>Ab∣surdity,</HI>
that the Napkin, before <HI>Jesus</HI> rais'd
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> was not taken from his Face, that
the Spectators might behold his mortified
Looks, and the miraculous Change of his
Countenance from Death unto Life. What
<HI>Infidels</HI> think of this Circumstance I know
not: I hope it is not with them a Token
of Fraud and Imposture; tho I must needs
say, that if the Fathers did not let me in∣to
the Mystery of the Napkin about <HI>Laza∣rus</HI>'s
Face when <HI>Jesus</HI> call'd him forth, I
should not my self like it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> and lastly, Observe, St. <HI>John</HI>
says, v. 45. that <HI>many of the Jews, who
had seen the Things that Jesus did</HI> here;
<HI>believed on him</HI>; and <HI>some of them,</HI> v. 46.
who did not believe, <HI>went their Ways to
the Pharisees and told them what Things
Jesus had done</HI> in this pretended Miracle,
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
and how the Business was transacted:
Whereupon the Chief Priests and Phari∣sees
were so far incens'd as v. 53. <HI>from that
Day forth they took Council together to put
him to Death</HI>; and Ch. xii. 10. <HI>consulted,
that they might put</HI> Lazarus <HI>also to Death.</HI>
Jesus <HI>therefore</HI> (and his Disciples and <HI>La∣zarus</HI>
fled for it, for they) v. 54. <HI>walk'd
no more openly among the Jews,</HI> but <HI>went
thence into a Country near to the Wilderness</HI>
(a convenient hiding Place) <HI>and there con∣tinued
with his Disciples</HI>; otherwise in all
Probability they had been all sacrificed.</P>
<P>I dare not argue upon these Circum∣stances,
neither would I, for the Honour
of <HI>Jesus</HI> have mention'd them; but that
my old Friend, the Jewish <HI>Rabbi,</HI> who
help'd me to the Satirical Invective against
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracle of <HI>turning Water into Wine,</HI>
has hence form'd an Objection against <HI>La∣zarus</HI>'s
Resurrection, and sent me a <HI>Letter</HI>
upon it, desiring me to publish it, and ex∣hort
the <HI>Clergy</HI> to answer it; otherwise he
would clandestinely hand it about to the
Prejudice of our Religion: Whereupon I,
rather than Christianity should so suffer, do
here publish it, and it is as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>Sr.</HI> When we last discours'd on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Miracles, I promised to send you my
Thoughts on <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection,
which I look upon as a notorious Im∣posture,
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
and for the Proof of it, need go no
farther, than to the Circumstances of its
Story, which your <HI>Evangelist</HI> has related.</P>
<P>If there had been an indisputable Mi∣racle
wrought in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrecti∣on;
why were the <HI>Chief-Priests</HI> and <HI>Pha∣risees</HI>
so incens'd upon it, as <HI>to take
Council to put both Jesus</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> to
<HI>Death for it?</HI> Where was the Provoca∣tion?
I can conceive none. Tho' the
<HI>Jews</HI> were ever so canker'd with Ma∣lice
and Hatred to <HI>Jesus</HI> before; yet
such a most stupendous Miracle was e∣nough
to stop their Mouths, and turn
their Hearts: Or if their Prejudices a∣gainst
<HI>Jesus</HI> were insuperable, and they
hated him but the more for the Num∣ber
and Greatness of his Miracles; yet
why is poor <HI>Lazarus,</HI> inoffensive <HI>Laza∣rus,</HI>
upon whom this good and great
Work was wrought, an Object of their
Hatred too? Your <HI>Divines</HI> are to give a
credible and probable Account of this
Matter, such a one as will comport with
Reason and Sense; or we shall conclude,
that it was <HI>Fraud,</HI> detected in this pre∣tended
Miracle, which justly provok'd
the Indignation of our Ancestors.</P>
<P>To say, what is all you can say, that
it was downright inhumanity, Barbarity
and Brutality in the <HI>Jews</HI> to hate <HI>La∣zarus</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
as well as <HI>Jesus,</HI> will not do here.
Tho' this may pass with many Christians,
who are ready to swallow, without
chewing, any evil Reports of our Na∣tion;
yet it can't go down with rea∣sonable
and unprejudic'd Men, who
must have other Conceptions of human
Nature in all Ages and Nations, than
to think it possible, that a Man, in <HI>La∣zarus</HI>'s
Case, can be hated and persecu∣ted
for having had such a good and won∣derful
Work done on him. And why
then was he hated and persecuted? I
say, for this, and no other Reason, than
because he was a Confederate with <HI>Jesus</HI>
in the wicked Imposture, he was putting
upon Mankind.</P>
<P>But supposing, what is never to be
granted, that the <HI>Jews</HI> of old were so
inhuman, brutish, and barbarous as to
hate and persecute <HI>Lazarus</HI> as well as
<HI>Jesus</HI> for this Miracle; yet why did
<HI>Jesus</HI> and his Disciples, with <HI>Lazarus,</HI>
run away and abscond upon it? for they
v. 54. <HI>walk'd no more openly among the</HI>
Jews, <HI>but went thence into a Country near
to the Wilderness, and there</HI> Jesus <HI>continued
with his Disciples.</HI> Is not here a plain
Sign of Guilt and of Fraud? Men, that
have God's Cause, Truth and Power on
their Side, never want Courage and Re∣solution
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
to stand to it. And however
your Christian <HI>Priests</HI> may palliate the
cowardly and timerous Conduct of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
and his Confederates in this Case;
yet with me, it's like Demonstration,
that there was a discover'd Cheat in the
Miracle, or they would undauntedly
have faced their Enemies, without Fears
And Apprehensions of Danger from them.</P>
<P>Our Ancestors then, who unques∣tionably
detected the Fraud, were in the
right on't to prosecute with Severity,
the whole Party concern'd in it: And if
they had aveng'd the Wickedness of it
upon <HI>Lazarus</HI> as well as they did upon
<HI>Jesus,</HI> I should have commended them
for it. Whether such a monstrous Im∣posture,
as was this pretended Miracle,
happily discover'd does not call aloud for
Vengeance and most exemplary Punish∣ment;
and whether any Nation of the
World would suffer the like with Im∣punity,
let any Man judge.</P>
<P>For all the Reports of your Gospels,
it is unnatural to hate a miraculous
Healer of Diseases; and there must be
somewhat supprest about the Inveteracy
of the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Jesus,</HI> or his healing
Power, if it was so great as is imagined,
must have reconciled them to him: But
that they should hate not only <HI>Jesus</HI> for
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
raising the dead, but the Person rais'd
by him, is improbable, incredible, and
impossible.</P>
<P>If Historians can parrallel this Story of
the Malignity of the <HI>Jews</HI> towards
<HI>Jesus</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> upon such a real Mi∣racle,
with any Thing equally barbarous
and inhuman, in any other Sect or Na∣tion;
we will acknowledge the Truth
of it against our ancient Nation: Or if
such Inhumanity, abstractedly consider'd,
be at all agreeable to the Conceptions any
one can form of Human Nature in the
most uncivilis'd and brutish People, we
will allow our Ancestors, in this Case,
to have been that People.</P>
<P>Was such a real and indisputable Mi∣racle,
as this of <HI>Lazarus</HI> is supposed, to be
wrought at this day in Confirmation of
Christianity, I dare say, it would bring
all us <HI>Jews,</HI> to a Man, into the Belief
of it: And I don't think it possible, for
any People to be so begotten, byass'd,
and prejudiced, as not to be wrought
on by it. Or if they would not part
with their Interests and Prejudices upon
it, they would have more Wit and
Temper, than to break forth into a
Rage against all or any of the Persons
concern'd in it. And, for my Life, I
can entertain no worse Thoughts of our
old Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54"/>
Supposing God should send an Am∣bassador
at this day, who, to convince
Christians of the Mischiefs and Incon∣venience
of an <HI>Hireling Priesthood,</HI>
should work such a Miracle as was this
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection, in the Pre∣sence
of a multitude of Spectators; how
would your <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> behave
themselves upon it? Why, they would
be as mute as Fishes; or if they did
fret and grieve inwardly for the Loss
of their Interests; yet they would have
more Prudence (ask them else,) than to
show their Anger openly, and persecute
both <HI>Agent</HI> and <HI>Patient</HI> for it. Where∣fore
then are they so censorious and un∣charitable
as to preach and believe ano∣ther
Notion and Doctrine of our An∣cestors?</P>
<P>But if a false Prophet, for the subver∣sion
of an <HI>Hireling Priesthood,</HI> should,
in spite to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> counterfeit such a
Miracle, and be detected in the Opera∣tion;
how then would Priests and Peo∣ple,
Magistrates and Subjects behave up∣on
it? Why, they would be full of In∣dignation,
and <HI>from that day forth would
take Council to put</HI> the Impostor and his
Confederate to Death, of which they
would be most deserving; and if they
did not abscond and fly for it, like <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
and his Disciples <HI>to a Wilderness in the
Country</HI> to hide themselves, the Rage of
the Populace would hardly wait the
Leisure of Justice to dispatch and make
terrible Examples of them. Was not
this exactly the Case of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Impo∣sture
in the Resurrection of <HI>Lazarus,</HI>
and of the Punishment he was threaten'd
with, and afterwards most justly under∣went
for it?</P>
<P>Mankind may be in some Cases very
obdurate, and so hard of Belief, as to stand
it out against Sense, Reason and De∣monstration:
But I will not think worse
of our Ancestors than of the rest of
Mankind; or that they any more than
others would have withstood a clear and
indisputable Miracle in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resu∣scitation.
Such a manifest Miracle, let
it be wrought for what End and Pur∣pose,
we can possibly imagine, would
strike Men with Awe and Reverence;
and none could hate and persecute the
Author of the Miracle; least He who
could raise the dead, should exert his
Power against themselves, and either
wound or sinite them dead with it.
For which Reason, the Resurrection of
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> on the certain Knowledge of
our Ancestors, was all Fraud, or they
would have reverenc'd and adored the
Power of him, that did it.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56"/>
It may be true, what <HI>John</HI> says, that
<HI>many of the Jews, who had seen the
Things that Jesus did, believed on him,</HI>
that is, believed that he had wrought
here a great Miraale: But who were
these? the ignorant and credulous, whom
a much less <HI>juggler</HI> than Mr. <HI>Fawkes</HI>
could easily impos'd on. But on the o∣ther
hand, it is certain, according to <HI>Chris∣tian
Commentators,</HI> that <HI>some of them</HI> did
not believe the Miracle, but <HI>went their
ways to the Pharisees and told them what
Things Jesus had done,</HI> that is, told
them, after what manner the Intrigue
was managed; and complain'd of the
Fraud in it. How they came to suspect
and discover the Fraud, was not <HI>John</HI>'
Business to relate; and for want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
other ancient Memorials, we can only
guess at it. Perhaps they discern'd some
motion in <HI>Lazarus</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Body, before the
Word of Command, to <HI>come forth,</HI> was
given; perhaps they discover'd some
Fragments of the Food, that for <HI>four
days</HI> in the Cave, he had subsisted on:
But however this was, they could not
but take Notice of the <HI>Napkin about his
Face</HI> all the while; which <HI>Jesus,</HI> to pre∣vent
all suspicion of Cheat, should have
first order'd to be taken off, that his
mortify'd Countenance might be view'd,
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
before the miraculous Change of it to
Life was wrought. This neglect in
<HI>Jesus</HI> (which I wonder <HI>John</HI> had no
more Wit than to hint at) will be a last∣ing
Objection to the Miracle. <HI>Jesus</HI>
was wiser, than not to be aware of the
Objection, which he would have obvi∣ated,
if he durst, by a Removal of the
Napkin, to the satisfaction of all Spec∣tators
there present. Because this was
not done, we <HI>Jews</HI> now deny, there
was any Miracle wrought; and, whe∣ther
our Unbelief upon this Circum∣stance
be not well grounded, we appeal
to Christian Priests themselves, who
must own, that if there was a Miracle
here, the Matter was ill conducted by
<HI>Jesus,</HI> or foolishly related by his <HI>Evan∣gelist.</HI></P>
<P>It is a sad Misfortune, that attends our
modern enquiry after Truth, that there
are no other Memorials extant of the
Life and Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than what
are written by his own Disciples. Not
only old Time has devour'd, but Chri∣stians
themselves, (which in the Opini∣on
of the impartial makes for us) when
they got Power into their Hands, wil∣fully
destroy'd many Writings of our An∣cestors,
as well as of <HI>Celsus</HI> and <HI>Porphi∣ry</HI>
and others, which they could not an∣swer;
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
otherwise I doubt not but they
would have given us clear Light into
the Imposture of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrecti∣on:
But if <HI>Jesus,</HI> according to his own
<HI>Evangelists,</HI> was arraign'd for a <HI>Decei∣ver</HI>
and <HI>Blasphemer,</HI> in pretending to the
Sonship and Power of God by his Mi∣racles;
in all Probability this Piece of
Fraud in <HI>Lazarus</HI> was one Article of the
Indictment against him; and what makes
it very likely, is that the <HI>Chief Priests</HI>
and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> from the Date of this pre∣tended
Miracle, <HI>took Council together to
put him to Death,</HI> not clandestinely or
tumultuously to murder him, but judici∣ally
to punish him with Death, which,
if they proved their Indictment by cre∣dible
and sufficient Witnesses, he was
most worthy of.</P>
<P>As it is plain from the Story in <HI>John,</HI>
that there was a Dispute among the By∣standers
at <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection, whe∣ther
it was a real Miracle or not; so it
is the Opinion of us <HI>Jews,</HI> which is of
the Nature of a Tradition, that the
<HI>Chief-Priests</HI> and civil Magistrates of <HI>Be∣thany,</HI>
for the better Determination of
the Dispute and quieting of the Minds of
the People, requir'd that <HI>Jesus</HI> should
re-act the Miracle upon another Person,
there lately dead and buried. But <HI>Je∣sus</HI>

declining this Test of his Power, the
whole Multitude of Believers as well as
of Unbelievers before, question'd the
Resurrection of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; and were high∣ly
incens'd against both him and <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
for the Deceit in it. And this was
<HI>one</HI> Reason among others of that vehe∣ment
and universal Outcry and Demand,
at <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Tryal, for his Crucifixion. I'll
not answer for the Certainty of this
Tradition or Opinion, but as the Expe∣dient
was obvious, so it has the Face of
Truth and Credibility; and for the
Proof of it, I need only appeal to Chris∣tain
<HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Magistrates</HI>; whether,
under a Dispute of a Miracle of that
Consequence, they would not require,
for full Satisfaction, it should be acted
over again; and, if the <HI>Juggler</HI> refused,
whether there would not be a general
Clamour of People of all Ranks for his
<HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matthev, Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> who knew
as much of this Sham Miracle as <HI>John,</HI>
had not the Confidence to report it;
because, when they wrote, many Eye-Witnesses
of the Fraud were alive to
disprove and contradict them; therefore
they confined their Narratives to <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
less juggling Tricks, that had pass'd more
current: But after the <HI>Jewish</HI> State
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
was dissolved, their judicial Records were
destroy'd, and every Body dead that
could confute him, <HI>John</HI> ventures a∣broad
the Story of this Miracle; and if
the good Providence of God had not
infatuated him, in the Insertion of the
Circumstances here observed, it might
have pass'd through all Generations to
come, as well as it has done for many
past, for a grand Miracle.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> have you a few of my
Thoughts on the pretended Miracle of
<HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection. I have more to
bestow on it, but that I would not be
tedious. There's no need to argue a∣gainst
the other two Resurrection-Stories.
You know <HI>omne majus includit minus,</HI>
and if the greatest of the three Miracles
be an Imposture, the two less ones of
Consequence are Artifice and Fraud.
And rather than the Miracle of <HI>Lazarus</HI>
shall stand its Ground, I'll have t'other
Bout at it from some other Circum∣stances;
the Consideration of which will
make it as foolish and wicked an Impo∣sture,
as ever was contrived and tran∣sacted
in the World; such a <HI>wicked Im∣posture</HI>
of most pernicious Consequence to
the Welfare of the Publick, that it is
no Wonder, the People, by an unani∣mous
Voice, call'd for the Releasement
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
of <HI>Barabbas,</HI> a Robber and Murderer,
before <HI>Jesus.</HI> I don't suppose these Ar∣guments
against this Miracle will be con∣vincing
of your Christian <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are
hired to the Belief of it. But howe∣ver,
a <HI>Bishop</HI> of many <HI>thousands</HI> a Year
to believe, can't in Conscience deny,
that the Arguments above are a sufficient
Justification of our <HI>Jewish</HI> Disbelief of
it.</P>
<P>If you, Sir, should write a Discourse
gainst the Letter of the Story of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Resurrection, I beg of you to ac∣cept
of a few of my Conceptions on that
Head, which, I promise you, shall be
out of the common Road of thinking.
Your <HI>Divines</HI> think they have exhausted
that Subject, and absolutely confuted
all Objections that can be made against
it, but are much mistaken. Sometimes
we <HI>Jews</HI> dip into their Writings on this
Head, and always smile with Indigna∣tion
at their foolish Invectives against the
Blindness of the Eyes, and Hardness of
the Hearts of our Ancestors. If they
would but favour us with a Liberty to
write for our selves, a reasonable Liber∣ty,
which in this Philosophical Age we
don't despair of, especially under so wise
just and good a Civil Administration, as
this Nation is happily bless'd with, we
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
would cut them out some more Work,
which they are not aware of. In the
mean Time I am your assured Friend,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>N. N.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<HI>Jewish Rabbi,</HI> which consists of <HI>calm</HI> and
<HI>sedate</HI> Reasoning, or I would not have
publish'd it; for I am resolv'd he shall no
more impose upon me with his ludicrous
and bantering Stuff, like his Satirical In∣vective
against <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracle of <HI>turning
Water into Wine,</HI> so offensive to our Godly
<HI>Bishops.</HI> And because it consists of <HI>calm</HI>
and <HI>sedate</HI> Reasoning, which <HI>Bishop Smal∣broke</HI>
allows of, I hope his <HI>Lordship</HI> will
take it into Consideration, and write an
Answer to it, which I, without the Help
of the Mystery, can't do.</P>
<P>If the foresaid <HI>Letter</HI> be offensive to our
<HI>Clergy,</HI> who don't judge it meet that the
<HI>Jews</HI> should take this Liberty to write
against the Miracles of our Saviour, and in
Vindication of their own disbelief of Chris∣tianity,
I beg of them, for the Love of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> not to let their Displeasure be visi∣bly
seen; because the <HI>Jews</HI> will then laugh
in their Sleeves, and perhaps openly insult
and triumph upon it: But if they will pri∣vately
acquaint me with their Displeasure
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
at it, I'll promise them to hold no more
Correspondence with such <HI>Jewish Rabbies</HI>;
neither will I ever hereafter publish any other
Objections against <HI>Christ</HI>'s Religion and Mi∣racles,
than what come from the <HI>Hoten∣tots</HI>
and <HI>Pawawers:</HI> and then it will be
strange, if our dignified <HI>Clergy,</HI> of most
grave and demure Looks, can't solidly
confute the worst, that such ignorant and
illiterate People can urge against them.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with my Objec∣tions
against the Letter of these three Mi∣racles.
If our <HI>Divines</HI> shall think there is
little or nothing of Force in them; then
an Answer, which I should be glad to see,
may the more easily be made to them.
As for my part, without being conceited
of the Acuteness and Strength of any of
the Objections, I think it impossible satis∣factorily
to reply to them, without having
Recourse to the Opinions of the Fathers,
that these three Miracles, whether they
were ever litterally transacted or not, are
now but emblematical Representations of
mysterious and more wonderful Opera∣tions
to be perform'd by <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>To the Fathers then let us go for their
mystical Interpretation of these Miracles.
St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> in his Introduction to a Ser∣mon
on the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, says
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
 <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Quidam corporalia ejus Miracula stupentes, ma∣jora intueri non norunt. Quidam vero ea, quae gesta audiunt in Corporibus nunc amplius in Animis admiran∣tur.—Dominus enim noster Jesus Christus ea quae facie∣bat corporaliter, etiam spiritaliter volebat intelligi; ne∣que enim Miracula propter Miracula faciebat, sed ut illa quae faciebat, mira essent Videntibus, vera essent Intelli∣gentibus.—Alii &amp; facta mirati &amp; intellecta assecuti. Tales nos esse debemus in Schola Christi.—Hoc dixi (de ficu arefacta) ut persuaderem Dominum Jesum Chris∣tum ideo Miracula fecisse, ut aliquid illis Miraculis sig∣nificaret; ut excepto eo, quod mira &amp; magna &amp; divina erant, aliquid inde etiam disceremus. Videamus ergo quid nos discere voluit in tribus mortuis, quos suscitavit. <HI>In Serm.</HI> xcviii.</NOTE> thus, "There are some so silly as to
stand amazed at the corporal Miracles
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and have no Consideration of
his greater and spiritual Miracles, signi∣fied
by them: but others who are wiser
can hear of the Things that <HI>Jesus</HI> did
on Men's Bodys, without being astonish'd
at them, chusing rather to contemplate
with Admiration his more wonderful
Works on Men's Souls, after the simili∣tude
of bodily Miracles. And these are
the Christians that conform their Studies
to the Will of our Lord; who would
have his corporal Miracles, spiritually
interpreted: For He wrought not Mi∣cles
in the Flesh, for the sake of such
Miracles abstractedly consider'd; but
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
that, if they were surprising to some
Mens Senses, they should be more asto∣nishing
to the Understanding of others,
who apprehend the spiritual Meaning of
them. And they who by Contempla∣tion
can attain to the mystical Signifi∣cation
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles, are the best
Scholars and most learn'd Disciples in
his Church and School. And, (<HI>speaking
of the Absurdity of Jesus's cursing the
Figtree according to the Letter</HI>) present∣ly
after says, that this he observ'd, that
he might persuade his Hearers to think,
that our Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> therefore wrought
Miracles, that he might signify somewhat
by them, which he would have his Dis∣ciples
to learn and consider of. Come
now, <HI>says he,</HI> and let us see what we are
mistically and spiritually to understand
by the Stories of the three Persons rais'd
from the dead."</P>
<P>There are two Ways, that the Fathers
took in the moral and mystical Interpreta∣tion
of these Miracles: One was from the
Number <HI>three,</HI> and their Difference in Mag∣nitude.
According to which they said
with St. <HI>Augustin</HI> <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Ista tria Genera Mortuorum, sunt tria Genera <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rum, quos hodie suscitat Christus.—Sunt ergo instar filiae Synagogae Principis, qui peccatum intus in Corde babent, in facto nondum habent. Con∣demnatur Consensus ad Iniquitatem; respiratur ad Sa∣lutem at{que} Justitiam. Surgit mortuus in Domo, revivis∣cit Cor in Cogitationis Secreto. Facta est ista Resurrectio Animae mortuae intus intra Latebras Conscientiae, tan∣quam intra Domesticos Parietes.—Alii post Consen∣sum eunt in factum, tanquam efferentes mortuum, ut quod latebat in Secreto, appareat in publico. Nonne illi juve∣ni dictam est. <HI>Tibi dico, surge</HI> &amp; redditus est Matri; sic qui jam fecerit, si forte admonitus &amp; commotus Verbo Veritatis ad Christi Vocem resurgit, vivus redditur Ec∣clesiae.—Qui autem faciendo quod malum est, etiam mala Consuetudine se implicant, tales Consuetudine ma∣ligna pressi, tanquam sepulti, ita sepulti ut de Lazaro dictum est, jam <HI>putet.</HI> In Serm. xcviii.</NOTE> that these three
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
sorts of dead Persons, so rais'd to Life,
are Figures of three sorts of Sinners,
whom <HI>Jesus</HI> raiseth from the death of Sin
to the Life of Righteousness. They who
have conceiv'd Sin in their Hearts, and
have not brought it forth into Act; are
figured by <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, who lay
dead in the House of her Father, and was
not taken forth to her Burial. Others,
who after Cogitation and Consent, pass into
actual Sin are figured by the Young Man,
carried towards his Grave. But those
Sinners, who are habituated and long ac∣custom'd
to Sin, are like <HI>Lazarus</HI> bury'd,
and in a stinking Condition under the Cor∣ruption
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
of it; whom <HI>Jesus,</HI> for all that,
with the <HI>loud Voice</HI> of the Praedication of
his Gospel, will call forth out of the
Death and Grave of their Sins to a new
Life. So does St. <HI>Augustin</HI> make these
three dead Persons and their Resurrections,
Emblems of the said three Sorts of Sin∣ners,
who are dead in Trespasses and Sins,
and by the Power of <HI>Jesus</HI> quicken'd to a
Life of Righteousness. And to this Opi∣nion
of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> do St. <HI>Ambrose, Euse∣bius
Gallicanus,</HI> and Venerable <HI>Bede</HI> agree.
And according to this Notion of these
Miracles they descend to a particular Ex∣plication
of the several Parts of their Sto∣ries.
As to give you two or three In∣stances.</P>
<P>The People who were turn'd out of the
House, upon the raising of <HI>Jarius</HI>'s Daugh∣ter,
which is an <HI>Absurdity</HI> according to the
<HI>Letter</HI> are, says <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cum ejecta esset Turba, intravit.</HI> Moraliter non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>esurgit Anima, quae intrinsecus jacet mortua, nisi prius a secretioribus Cordis excludatur inopportuna saecularium Cogitationum Multitudo. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bede,</HI> a Multitude
of wordly and wicked Thoughts, which,
except they are excluded from the Secrets
of the Heart, are a Hindrance of the Re∣surrection
of a Sinner to a new Life.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="70"/>
The Bearers of the Young Man <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Mali isti Portitores, qui ad sepeliendum hominem ferunt, sunt Vitia &amp; maligni spiritus, Haeretici &amp; seduc∣tores. Hos enim nisi Dominus sisteret, quoscun{que} semel acciperent, sepulturae &amp; aeternae Damnationi traderent. Suscitatus igitur Adolescens sedet, loquitur &amp; Matri redditur, quia ad Penitentiam conversus in Ecclesiae pace quiescit, Dei Magnalia loquitur, sua peccata con∣fitetur; &amp; Ecclesiae reconciliatur. <HI>Euseb.

and Seducers; and the <HI>Widow,</HI> his
Mother, to whom he was restored, is the
<HI>Church,</HI> who mourns for the Death of such
Sinners, as are typified by that Young
Man.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>weeping</HI> for dead <HI>Lazarus,</HI> which
is an <HI>Absurdity</HI> according to the <HI>Letter,</HI>
is a Sign <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Et <HI>lacrymatus est Jesus.</HI> Lacrymemur igitur &amp; nos pro omnibus illis, quos in Faetore Vitiorum jacere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>entimus. <HI>Euseb. Gallic. in Homil. Feriae</HI> 5<HI>tae post Domin.</HI> 4<HI>tam.</HI></NOTE> of the deplorable State,
that habitual Sinners are in, enough to
excite the Sorrows and Mournings of good
Christians, who have the Spirit of <HI>Christ,</HI>
for them. And the Stone that lay at the
Grave of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> is <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Lapis autem revolutus a Monumento significat Infidelitatis Duritiam ab Hominum Corde submotam. <HI>Theop. Antioch. in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> a figure of the
Hardness of the Heart of such a Sinner
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
which must be taken away before <HI>Jesus</HI>
will call him to a new Life. So do the
Fathers moralise and allegorise every Mi∣nute
Circumstance of these three Miracles,
as any one, who will consult them, may
find, and save me the Trouble of a tedious
Recital of their Authorities.</P>
<P>But the other mystical Way of interpre∣ting
these three Miracles is by making
them Types of three great Events at the
Time of <HI>Christ</HI>'s spiritual Advent. Accor∣dingly
the raising of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter is
a Type of the Conversion of the <HI>Jews</HI> at
that Day, as <HI>Eusebius Gallicanus</HI> <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Quod enim tunc temporis factum est in una Puella, hoc in fine Temporum futurum est, ut fiat in tota. Sonagoga. <HI>In Homil. Feriae</HI> 5<HI>ta post Domin.</HI> 4<HI>tam.</HI></NOTE> and
venerable <HI>Bede</HI> <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Synagoga circa finem saeculi erit restituta saluti. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> and others expound
it. By <HI>Jairus,</HI> the Ruler of a <HI>Synagogue</HI>;
is meant <HI>Moses</HI> <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Jairus illuminatus vel illuminans, Moses intelli∣gitur. <HI>Bed.</HI> in <HI>Loc. Mat.</HI></NOTE>; and by his Daugh∣ter
is to be understood the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI>
which, being at present in a State of Spi∣ritual
Death, will be revived and conver∣ted
in the Perfection of Time. And to
the mystical Resurrection or Restitution of
the <HI>Jewish Synagogue,</HI> call'd <HI>Jairus</HI>'s
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
Daughter, will <HI>Jesus</HI> come <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Ad hanc ergo Principis filiam dum properat Dei Verbum, ut salvos faceret filios Israel, sancta Ec∣clesia de Gentibus congregata, quae inferiorum Lapsu Criminum deperibat, paratam aliis fide praeripuit Sani∣tatem. <HI>St. Ambros. in Loc. Luc.</HI> Quod vero post restitu∣tam immundae Mulieri Valetudinem, defuncta Puella a mortuis restituitur; ne hoc quidem ab exquisita Allegoria alienum. Nam Reliquiae salvae fiant, juxta Apostolum, cum ingressa fuerit Gentium Plenitudo. <HI>Theop. Ceram. in Homil. de Jairi filia.</HI></NOTE> at the
same Time he heals the Woman of the
Church of her Issue of Blood. And this is
the Reason that the Stories of these two
Miracles are blended together by the <HI>Evan∣gelists,</HI>
with their synchronical Numbers
of the Age of the <HI>Girl</HI> and of the Disease
of the Woman; because they are Types of
that blessed Scene of Affairs at the Conver∣sion
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> when the Fulness of the
<HI>Gentiles</HI> is come in. Concerning which
blessed state of the Church, <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Quarum Rerum Causa multa fuere Jesu Mira∣cula. <HI>In Johan. Cap. XI.</HI></NOTE>
says, <HI>Jesus</HI> wrought many Miracles, by
Way of Type and Figure.</P>
<P>Among all the Miracles that <HI>Jesus</HI>
wrought, and are recorded by the <HI>Evan∣gelists,</HI>
I think, as far as I have had Occa∣sion
to observe, the Fathers are most scan∣ty
in their Interpretations of that of the
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son: Excepting what
is before noted of his being a figure of a
Sinner dead in actual, tho not habitual
Sin, I find very little. But if <HI>Origen</HI>'s
Comments on this Miracle had been ex∣tant,
I dare say he would have given us
this following Interpretation of it. This
Widow, he would have call'd the Church;
and her <HI>only Son</HI> or masculine Offspring, he
would have call'd the <HI>Spiritual Sense</HI> of
the Scriptures, which is now dead, and
that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI> who are
his Bearers, are for interring him within
the <HI>Earth</HI> of the <HI>Letter:</HI> But <HI>Jesus,</HI> upon
his Spiritual Advent will put a stop to the
Intention of such Bearers, by reviving the
<HI>Spiritual Sense</HI> of the Scriptures; and by
restoring it, like a <HI>quicken'd Son,</HI> to the
Comfort of his Mother, the Church; who
has been in a sorrowful and lamentable
Condition upon the Death and Want of
it. This, I am sure, would be <HI>Origen</HI>'s
Interpretation of this Miracle, which, if I
had Room here, by a little Circumlocu∣tion,
I could prove.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Resurrection, it is in the
Opinion of the Fathers <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Per Lazarum Genus humanum ostenditur. <HI>Theop. Antioch. in Loc. Johan.</HI> Nostra Resurrectio figuratur per Lazari Resurrectionem.—Spelunca sive Sepulchrum Lazari Litteram Legis umbratilem de∣signat.—<HI>Magna Voce clamavit Jesus,</HI> id <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Prae∣dicatio Evangelii per quam humana Natura Peccatorum Vinculis &amp; in Scpulchro Infidelitatis jacens vocatur ad Vitam. <HI>Theop. Ceram. in Homil. de Lazaro.</HI></NOTE> a Type of the
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
general and mystical Resurrection of Man∣kind
in the Perfection of Time. But this
is a most copious Subject; and unless I
could here throughly handle it, I had much
better say nothing.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the three
Resurrection Stories. If the <HI>Convocation,</HI>
next Session, would determine by an Or∣thodox
Vote, whether <HI>Jesus</HI> rais'd any
more, than the said three Persons, from
the dead or not; I would present them
with a new and more entertaining Chain
of Thoughts against these Miracles; such
a Chain of Thoughts, as, upon the Con∣clusion,
let them hold which Side of the
Question they please, will necessarily in∣duce
us to hold the mystical Meaning of
these Miracles, or to grant that <HI>Jesus</HI>
rais'd none from the dead at all.</P>
<P>My next and last <HI>Discourse</HI> on <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Miracles shall be against the Letter of the
Story of his own Resurrection, in which,
if our <HI>Bishops</HI> will keep their Temper
and Patience, till I publish it, I'll cut
out such a Piece of Work for our <HI>Boy∣lean</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="75"/><HI>Lectures,</HI> as shall hold them tug, so
long as the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the <HI>Letter</HI> and an
<HI>Hireling Priesthood</HI> shall last. If <HI>Christ be
not risen,</HI> then, according to the Inference
of St. <HI>Paul, is their Preaching vain</HI>; and
why should the People be any longer
charg'd with the Maintenance of an igno∣rant
and idle Order of Men, to no Use and
Purpose?</P>
<P>If I had not had Experience of it, I
could never have believed that, for all the
ludicrous Nature of these <HI>Discourses,</HI> our
<HI>dignified Clergy</HI> could have been so foolish
or malicious as to prosecute me for an <HI>In∣fidel</HI>
and <HI>Blasphemer</HI> upon them. How a
Man may be mistaken in himself! I took
my self for a real Advocate for the Truth
of Christianity; and was so vain as to ima∣gine
these Discourses tended to a Demon∣stration
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship: And tho
the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> may be of a contrary
Opinion, yet I am still so conceited of
my Ability to defend our Religion, that
I'll stake my Life against his <HI>Bishoprick,</HI>
which I'll not be troubled with, if I win it,
that he can't form an Objection against
Christianity, which I can't solidly confute,
and make our Readers merry too, with his
Weakness and Impertinence in it. But
perhaps it may be unbecoming of his
Lordship's Character, and against the
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
Grain, to make an Objection to that Re∣ligion,
which he finds much <HI>temporal,</HI> as
well as some <HI>spiritual</HI> Comfort in the Pro∣fession
of; I will therefore descend to ano∣ther
Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> If he'll but publish
an Answer to the <HI>Jewish Rabbi</HI>'s Letter in
this Discourse, and vouchsafe me the plea∣sure
of a Reply to him; then (to save the
Civil Magistrate's Trouble) I will suffer
any Punishment that in his Clemency he
shall think fit to inflict on me, for what's
past. Oh, what a Hazard do I here run of
Life or Liberty!</P>
<P>Some Christians, in my Case, would
think it a sad Misfortune to be odiously
represented as an <HI>Infidel</HI> and <HI>Blasphemer</HI>;
but I, in Temper and Principle, despise
such Obloquies, Slanders and Defama∣tions;
and would not give a Rush to re∣move
them, so long as I had the Answer
of a good Conscience that I was unde∣serving
of them: But considering, that it
is the Duty of a Christian to seek the Peace
and Friendship of all about him, and espe∣cially
of our good <HI>Bishops,</HI> who, in Compas∣sion
to the Danger they think my Soul is
in, have taken zealous and laudable Pains
with the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> for my Con∣viction
and Conversion; I do here, for the
sake of a Reconciliation with their <HI>Lord∣ships</HI>
and other good People, make a for∣mal
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
and solemn Confession of my Chri∣stian
Faith, which tho' I don't express in
the Words of the <HI>Apostical, Nicene</HI> or
<HI>Athanasian</HI> Creeds; yet will do it in such
Terms as will be a Demonstration that
at the Bottom I am sound as a <HI>Roch.</HI> Be
it known then to all Christian People,

<HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the <HI>Let∣ter,</HI>

the Cause of the Infidelity and Apostacy of
these latter Times.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the Spirit and Power of
<HI>Jesus</HI> will soon enter the Church and

the manner he is suppos'd to have dri∣ven
the <HI>Buyers</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI> out of the Tem∣ple.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These are a few Articles of that Faith,
once deliver'd to the <HI>Saints</HI> of the primi∣tive
Church, which I firmly believe, and
will earnestly contend for. Now I ap∣peal
to the Christian World, whether a
Man of such a Faith, like Heart of Oak,
can be an Infidel or Blasphemer. Upon
this ingenuous Confession of my Faith,
which I make by way of Atonement for
my past supposed Errors and Offences, I
hope the <HI>Bishops</HI> and all good Christian
People will be reconciled to me.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jame's</HI> says, that <HI>Faith without
Works is dead,</HI> and how a Man ought to
how his Faith by his Works, without
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
which Faith is an empty and airy Nothing.
Accordingly I am making what haste I can
to show the Sincerity of my Faith by
these my <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Discourses</HI> of this Kind.
And by the Grace of God, I hope our
Bishops will find me as unmoveable as a
Rock in the said Faith.</P>
<P>According to the foresaid Articles of
this my Faith, I am so fully convinced, not
only of the Error of the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the
<HI>Letter,</HI> but of the Mischiefs and Incon∣veniences
of an <HI>Hireling-Priesthood,</HI> that,
having set my Shoulders to the Work, I
am resolv'd, by the Help of God, to en∣deavour
to give <HI>both</HI> a Lift out of this
World. This is fair and generous Warn∣ing
to our <HI>Clergy</HI> to sit fast, and look to
their own Safety, or they may find me a
stronger Man than they may be aware of.
And tho I don't expect long to survive
the Accomplishment of so great and
glorious a Work; yet I am delightfully
ravish'd and transported with the Fore∣thought
and Contemplation of the Happi∣ness
of Mankind, upon the Extinction of
Ecclesiastical <HI>Vermin,</HI> out of God's House;
when the World will return to its <HI>Primo∣genial</HI>
and <HI>Paradisaical</HI> State of Nature,
Religion and Liberty; in which we shall be
<HI>all taught of God,</HI> and <HI>have no need</HI> of
foolish and contentious Priest, hired to ha∣rangue
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
us with his Noise and Nonsense.
Which blessed State of the World God of
his infinite Mercy hasten, for the sake of
our Spiritual Messiah, Mediator and Re∣deemer
<HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> To whom be Glory
for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
