<HEAD>MEMOIRS of the AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE enthusiasm of poetry, like that of reli∣gion,
has frequently a powerful influence on
the conduct of life, and either throws it into the
retreat of uniform obscurity, or marks it with irre∣gularities
that lead to misery and disquiet. The
gifts of imagination bring the heaviest task upon
the vigilance of reason; and to bear those faculties
with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmness and of cool attention
which doth not always attend the higher gifts of
the mind. Yet, difficult as nature herself seems to
have rendered the task of regularity to genius, it is
the supreme consolation of <HI>dulness</HI> and <HI>folly,</HI> to point
with gothic triumph to these excesses, which are
the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed.
Perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their
stupidity for the consistency of their conduct, they
plume themselves on an imaginary virtue, which
has its origin in what is really their disgrace.—Let
such, if such dare approach the shrine of COLLINS,
withdraw to a respectful distance, and, should they
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
behold the ruins of genius, or the weakness of an
exalted mind, let them be taught to lament that
nature has left the noblest of their works imper∣fect.</P>
<P>OF such men of genius as have borne no public
character, it seldom happens that any memoirs can
be collected, of consequence enough to be record∣ed
by the biographer. If their lives pass in obscu∣rity,
they are generally too uniform to engage our
attention; if they cultivate and obtain popularity,
envy and malignity will mingle their poison with
the draughts of praise; and through the industry
of those unwearied fiends, their reputation will be
so chequered, and their characters so disguised, that
it shall become difficult for the historian to separate
truth from falshood.</P>
<P>OF our exalted poet, whose life, though far
from being popular, did not altogether pass in pri∣vacy,
we meet with few other accounts than such
as the life of every man will afford, <HI>viz.</HI> when he
was born, where he was educated, and where he
died. Yet even these simple memoirs of the man
will not be unacceptable to those who admire the
poet: for we never receive pleasure without a de∣sire
to be acquainted with the source from whence
it springs; a species of curiosity, which, as it seems
<PB N="iii" REF="6"/>
to be instinctive, was, probably, given us for the
noble end of gratitude; and, finally, to elevate the
enquiries of the mind to that fountain of perfection
from which all human excellence is derived.</P>
<P>CHICHESTER, a city in Sussex, had the honour
of giving birth to the author of the following po∣ems,
about the year 1721. His father, who was
a reputable tradesman in that city, intended him
for the service of the church; and with this view,
in the year 1733, he was admitted a scholar of that
illustrious seminary of genius and learning, Win∣chester
college, where so many distinguished men
of letters, so many excellent poets have received
their classical education. Here he had the good
fortune to continue seven years under the care of
the very learned Dr. Burton; and at the age of
nineteen, in the year 1740, he had merit sufficient
to procure a distinguished place in the list of those
scholars, who are elected, upon the foundation of
Winchester, to New College in Oxford. But as
there were then no vacancies in that society, he
was admitted a commoner of Queen's College in
the same university; where he continued till July
1741, when he was elected a demy of Magdalen
College. During his residence at Queen's, he was
at once distinguished for genius and indolence; his
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>
exercises, when he could be prevailed upon to
write, bearing the visible characteristics of both.
This remiss and inattentive habit might probably
arise, in some measure, from disappointment: he
had, no doubt, indulged very high ideas of the a∣cademical
mode of education, and when he found
science within the fetters of logic and of Aristotle,
it was no wonder if he abated of his diligence to
scek her where the search was attended with artifi∣cial
perplexities, and where, at last, the pursuer
would grasp the shadow for the substance.</P>
<P>WHILE he was at Magdalen College, he applied
himself chiefly to the cultivation of poetry, and
wrote the epistle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and the
Oriental Eclogues, which, in the year 1742, were
published under the title of <HI>Persian Eclogues.</HI>—The
success of these poems was far from being equal to
their merit; but to a novice in the pursuit of fame,
the least encouragement is sufficient: if he does
not at once acquire that reputation to which his
merit intitles him, he embraces the encomiums of
the few, forgives the many, and intends to open
their eyes to the striking beauties of his next Pub∣lication.</P>
<P>WITH prospects such as these, probably, Mr.
Collins indulged his fancy, when, in the year 1743,
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
after having taken the degree of a batchelor of arts,
he left the university, and removed to London.</P>
<P>To a man of small fortune, a liberal spirit, and
uncertain dependencies, the metropolis is a very
dangerous place. Mr. Collins had not been long in
town before he became an instance of the truth of
this observation. His pecuniary resources were ex∣hausted,
and to restore them by the exertion of ge∣nius
and learning, though he wanted not the pow∣er,
he had neither steadiness nor industry. His ne∣cessities,
indeed, sometimes carried him as far as a
scheme, or a title page for a book; but, whether
it were the power of dissipation, or the genius of
repose that interfered, he could proceed no farther.
Several books were projected, which he was very able
to execute; and he became, in idea, an historian,
a critic, and a dramatic poet by turns. At one time he
determined to write an history of the revival of Let∣ters;
at another to translate and comment upon
Aristotle's Poetics; then he turned his thoughts to
the Drama, and proceeded so far towards a trage∣dy—as
to become acquainted with the manager.</P>
<P>UNDER this unaccountable dissipation, he suf∣fered
the greatest inconveniencies. Day succeeded
day, for the support of which he had made no pro∣vision,
and in which he was to subsist either by the
<PB N="vi" REF="9"/>
long-repeated contributions of a friend, or the ge∣nerosity
of a casual acquaintance.—Yet indolence
triumphed at once over want and shame; and nei∣ther
the anxieties of poverty, nor the heart-burning
of dependance had power to animate resolution to
perseverance.</P>
<P>As there is a degree of depravity into which if a
man falls, he becomes incapable of attending to any
of the ordinary means that recall men to virtue, so
there are some circumstances of indigence so ex∣tremely
degrading, that they destroy the influences
of shame itself; and most spirits are apt to sink,
under their oppression, into a sullen and unambiti∣ous
despondence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this might be with regard to Mr.
Collins, we find that, in the year 1746, he had
spirit and resolution enough to publish his <HI>Odes de∣scriptive
and allegorical.</HI> Mr. MILLAR, a book∣seller
in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and a favourer of genius,
<HI>when once it has made its way to same,</HI> published
them ON THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT.—He hap∣pened,
indeed, to be in the right not to publish
them on his own; for the sale was by no means
successful: and hence it was that the author, con∣ceiving
a just indignation against a blind and taste∣less
age, burnt the remaining copies with his own
hands.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="10"/>
ALLEGORICAL and abstracted poetry was above
the taste of those times, as much, or more than it
is of the present. It is in the lower walks, the
plain and practical paths of the muses only that the
generality of men can be entertained. The higher
efforts of imagination are above their capacity;
and it is no wonder therefore, if the Odes descrip∣tive
and allegorical met with few admirers.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances, so mortifying to e∣very
just expectation, when neither his wants were
relieved, nor his reputation extended, he found
some consolation in changing the scene, and visit∣ing
his uncle, colonel MARTIN, who was, at that
time, with our army in Flanders. Soon after his
arrival, the colonel died, and left him a considerable
fortune.</P>
<P>HERE, then, we should hope to behold him
happy; possessed of independence, and removed
from every scene, and every monument of his former
misery. But, fortune had delayed her favours till
they were not worth receiving. His faculties had
been so long harrassed by anxiety, dissipation, and
distress, that he fell into a nervous disorder, which
brought with it an unconquerable depression of spi∣rits,
and at length reduced the finest understanding
to the most deplorable childishness. In the first
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>
stages of his disorder he attempted to relieve him∣self
by travel, and passed into France; but the grow∣ing
malady obliged him to return; and having con∣tinued,
with short intervals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems to have been in one of these intervals, that he was visited by an ingenious friend, who tells us he found him with a book in his hand, and being asked what it was, he an∣swered, that "he had but one book, but that was the best." It was the New-Testament in English.</NOTE> in this pitiable state
till the year 1756, he died in the arms of a sister at
Chichester.</P>
<P>MR. Collins was, in stature, somewhat above the
middle size; of a brown complexion, keen, ex∣pressive
eyes, and a sixed, sedate aspect, which, from
intense thinking, had contracted an habitual frown.
His prosiciency in letters was greater than could
have been expected from his years. He was skilled
in the learned languages, and acquainted with the
<HI>Italian, French,</HI> and <HI>Spanish.</HI>—It is observable that
none of his poems bear the marks of an amorous
disposition, and that he is one of those few poets, who
have sailed to Delphi, without touching at Cythera.
The allusions of this kind that appear in his Orien∣tal
Eclogues were indispensable in that species of
poetry; and it is very remarkable that in his <HI>Passi∣ons,</HI>
an ode for music, love is omitted, though it
should have made a principal figure there.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE, a valley near BAGDAT.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Time, the Morning.</STAGE>
<L>YE Persian maids, attend your poet's lays,</L>
<L>And hear how shepherds pass their golden days.</L>
<L>Not all are blest, whom fortune's hand sustains</L>
<L>With wealth in courts, nor all that haunt the plains:</L>
<L>Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell;</L>
<L>'Tis virtue makes the bliss, where'er we dwell.</L>
<L>Thus Selim sung, by sacred truth inspir'd;</L>
<L>Nor praise, but such as truth bestow'd desir'd:</L>
<L>Wise in himself, his meaning songs conveyed</L>
<L>Informing morals to the shepherd maid;</L>
<L>Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find,</L>
<L>What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind</L>
<L>When sweet and blushing, like a virgin bride,</L>
<L>The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride,</L>
<L>When wanton gales along the valleys play,</L>
<L>Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away:</L>
<L>By Tigris' wand'ring waves he sat, and sung</L>
<L>This useful lesson sor the fair and young.</L>
<L>Ye Persian dames, he said, to you belong,</L>
<L>Well may they please, the morals of my song:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
No fairer maids, I trust than you are found,</L>
<L>Grac'd with soft arts, the peopled world around!</L>
<L>The morn that lights you, to your loves supplies</L>
<L>Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes:</L>
<L>For you those flowers her fragrant hand bestow,</L>
<L>And yours the love that kings delight to know.</L>
<L>Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are,</L>
<L>The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair!</L>
<L>Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray,</L>
<L>Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display;</L>
<L>Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright,</L>
<L>But, dark within, they drink no lustrous light:</L>
<L>Such are the maids, and such the charms they boast,</L>
<L>By sense unaided, or to virtue lost.</L>
<L>Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain</L>
<L>That love shall blind, when once he fires the swain;</L>
<L>Or hope a lover by your faults to win,</L>
<L>As spots on ermin beautify the skin:</L>
<L>Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care</L>
<L>Each softer virtue that adorns the fair;</L>
<L>Each tender passion man delights to find,</L>
<L>The lov'd perfections of a female mind!</L>
<L>Blest were the days, when Wisdom held her reign,</L>
<L>And shepherds sought her on the silent plain;</L>
<L>With Truth she wedded in the secret grove,</L>
<L>Immortal Truth, and daughters bless'd their love.</L>
<L>O haste, fair maids! ye Virtues come away,</L>
<L>Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way!</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
The balmy shrub, for you shall love our shore,</L>
<L>By Ind excell'd or Araby no more.</L>
<L>Lost to our fields, for so the fates ordain,</L>
<L>The dear deserters shall return again.</L>
<L>Come thou, whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear,</L>
<L>To lead the train, sweet Modesty appear:</L>
<L>Here make thy court amidst our rural scene,</L>
<L>And shepherd-girls shall own thee for their queen.</L>
<L>With thee be Chastity, of all afraid,</L>
<L>Distrusting all, a wise suspicious maid;</L>
<L>But man the most—not more the mountain doe</L>
<L>Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe.</L>
<L>Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew;</L>
<L>A silken veil conceals her from the view.</L>
<L>No wild desires amidst thy train be known,</L>
<L>But Faith, whose heart is fix'd on one alone:</L>
<L>Dcsponding Meekness, with her down-cast eyes,</L>
<L>And friendly Pity, full of tender sighs;</L>
<L>And Love the last: by these your hearts approve,</L>
<L>These are the virtues that must lead to love.</L>
<L>Thus sung the swain; and ancient legends say,</L>
<L>The maids of Bagdat verified the lay:</L>
<L>Dear to the plains, the Virtues came along.</L>
<L>The shepherds lov'd, and Selim bless'd his song.</L>

<L>IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste</L>
<L>The driver Hassan with his camels past:</L>
<L>One cruise of water on his back he bore,</L>
<L>And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store;</L>
<L>A fan of painted feathers in his hand,</L>
<L>To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.</L>
<L>The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky,</L>
<L>And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh;</L>
<L>The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,</L>
<L>Shrill roar'd the winds, and dreary was the view!</L>
<L>With desperate sorrow wild, th' affrighted man</L>
<L>Thrice sigh'd, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:</L>
<L>"Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>"When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
<L>Ah! little thought I of the blasting wind,</L>
<L>The thirst or pinching hunger that I find!</L>
<L>Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall Thirst assuage,</L>
<L>When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage?</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign;</L>
<L>Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine?</L>
<L>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</L>

<L>Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,</L>
<L>Or moss-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</L>
<L>Which plains more blest, or verdant vales bestow:</L>
<L>Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are found,</L>
<L>And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.</L>
<L>"Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>"When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
<L>Curst be the gold and silver which persuade</L>
<L>Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade!</L>
<L>The lilly peace outshines the silver store,</L>
<L>And life is dearer than the golden ore:</L>
<L>Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown,</L>
<L>To every distant mart and wealthy town.</L>
<L>Full oft we tempt the land, and oft the sea:</L>
<L>And are we only yet repay'd by thee?</L>
<L>Ah! why was ruin so attractive made,</L>
<L>Or why fond man so easily betray'd?</L>
<L>Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,</L>
<L>The gentle voice of peace, or pleasure's song?</L>
<L>Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side,</L>
<L>The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</L>
<L>Why think we these less pleasing to behold,</L>
<L>Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>"Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>"When first srom Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
<L>O cease, my fears!—all frantic as I go,</L>
<L>When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe,</L>
<L>What if the lion in his rage I meet!—</L>
<L>Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when day's declining light</L>
<L>Yields her pale empire to the mourner night,</L>
<L>By hunger rous'd, he scours the groaning plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train:</L>

<L>At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep,</L>
<L>If aught of rest I find, upon my sleep:</L>
<L>Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around,</L>
<L>And wake to anguish with a burning wound.</L>
<L>Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor,</L>

<P>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, etc.</HEAD>
<P>THE genius of the pastoral, as well as of every
other respectable species of poetry, had its ori∣gin
in the East, and from thence was transplanted by
the Muses of Greece; but whether from the continent
of the lesser Asia, or from Egypt, which, about the
aera of the Grecian pastoral, was the hospitable nurse
of letters, it is not easy to determine. From the sub∣jects
and the manner of Theocritus, one would incline
to the latter opinion, while the history of Bion is in
savour of the former.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though it should still remain a doubt
through what channel the pastoral travelled westward,
there is not the least shadow of uncertainty concerning
its Oriental origin.</P>
<P>In those ages, which, guided by sacred chronolo∣gy,
from a comparative view of time, we call the
early ages, it appears from the most authentic histo∣rians,
that the chiess of the people employed themselves
in rural exercises, and that astronomers and legisla∣tors
were at the same time shepherds. Thus Strabo
informs us that the history of the creation was com∣municated
to the Egyptians by a Chaldean shepherd.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79"/>
FROM these circumstances it is evident not only
that such shepherds were capable of all the dignity
and elegance peculiar to poetry, but that whatever
poetry they attempted would be of the pastoral kind;
would take its subjects from those scenes of rural sim∣plicity
in which they were conversant, and, as it was
the offspring of Harmony and Nature, would employ
the powers it derived from the former to celebrate the
beauty and benevolence of the latter.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find that the most ancient po∣ems
treat of agriculture, astronomy, and other objects
within the rural and natural systems.</P>
<P>WHAT constitutes the difference between the Geor∣gic
and the Pastoral is love, and the colloquial, or dra∣matic
form of composition peculiar to the latter: this
form of composition is sometimes dispensed with,
and love and rural imagery alone are thought suffici∣ent
to distinguish the pastoral. The tender passion,
however, seems to be essential to this species of poetry,
and is hardly ever excluded from those pieces that
were intended to come under this denomination: e∣ven
in those eclogues of the Amoebean kind, whose only
purport is a trial of skill between contending shep∣herds,
love has its usual share, and the praises of
their respective mistesses are the general subjects of the
competitors.</P>
<P>IT is to be lamented that scarce any oriental com∣positions
of this kind have survived the ravages of ig∣norance,
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
tyranny and time; we cannot doubt that
many such have been extant, possibly as far down as
that fatal period, never to be mentioned in the world
of letters without horrour, when the glorious monu∣ments
of human ingenuity perished in the ashes of the
Alexandrian library.</P>
<P>THOSE ingenious Creeks whom we call the parents
of pastoral poetry were, probably, no more than imi∣tators
of imitators, that derived their harmony from
higher and remoter sources, and kindled their poeti∣cal
fires at those unextinguished lamps which burned
within the tombs of oriental genius.</P>
<P>IT is evident that Homer has availed himself of
those magnificent images and descriptions so fre∣quently
to be met with in the books of the Old Testa∣ment;
and why may not Theocritus, Moschus and
Bion have found their archetypes in other eastern wri∣ters,
whose names have perished with their works?
yet, though it may not be illiberal to admit such a
supposition, it would, certainly, be invidious to con∣clued
what the malignity of cavillers alone could sug∣gest
with regard to Homer, that they destroyed the
sources from which they borrowed, and, as it is fa∣bled
of the young of the pelican, drained their sup∣porters
to death.</P>
<P>As the septuagint-translation of the Old Testament
was performed at the request, and under the patro∣nage
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it were not to be won∣dered
if Theocritus, who was entertained at that
prince's court, had borrowed some part of his pasto∣ral
imagery from the poetical passages of those books.—I
think it can hardly be doubted that the Sicilian
poet had in his eye certain expressions of the prophet
Isaiah, when he wrote the following lines.</P>

<L>On the rude thorn Narcissus dress his hair—</L>
<L>All, all revers'd—The pine with pears be crown'd,</L>
<L>And the bold deer shall drag the trembling hound.</L></Q>
<P>The cause, indeed, of these phenomena is very diffe∣rent
in the Greek from what it is in the Hebrew po∣et;
the former employing them on the death, the
latter on the birth of an important person: but the
marks of imitation are nevertheless obvious.</P>
<P>IT might, however, be expected that if Theocri∣tus
had borrowed at all from the sacred writers, the
celebrated pastoral Epithalamium of Solomon, so
much within his own walk of Poetry, would not cer∣tainly
have escaped his notice. His Epithalamium on
the marriage of Helena, moreover, gave him an o∣pen
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
field for imitation; therefore, if he has any ob∣ligations
to the royal bard, we may expect to find
them there. The very opening of the poem is in the
spirit of the Hebrew song:
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
The colour of imitation is still stronger in the follow∣ing
passage:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
This description of Helen is infinitely above the style
and figure of the Sicilian pastoral—"She is like the
rising of the golden morning, when the night de∣parteth,
and when the winter is over and gone.
She resembleth the cypress in the garden, the
horse in the chariots of Thessaly." These figures
plainly declare their origin, and others equally imi∣tative
might be pointed out in the same idyllium.</P>
<P>THIS beautiful and luxuriant marriage-pastoral of
Solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental ec∣logue
that has survived the ruins of time; a happiness
for which it is, probably, more indebted to its sacred
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
character than to its intrinsic merit. Not that it is by
any means destitute of poetical excellence: like all the
eastern poetry, it is bold, wild and unconnected in
its figures, allusions and parts, and has all that grace∣ful
and magnificent daring which characterises its
metaphorical and comparative imagery.</P>
<P>IN consequence of these peculiarities, so ill adapted
to the frigid genius of the north, Mr. COLLINS could
make but little use of it as a precedent for his oriental
eclogues; and even in his third eclogue, where the
subject is of a similar nature, he has chosen rather to
follow the mode of the Doric and the Latian pastoral.</P>
<P>THE scenery and subjects then of the following ec∣logues
alone are Oriental; the style and colouring are
purely European; and, for this reason, the author's
preface, in which he intimates that he had the origi∣nals
from a merchant who traded to the East, is o∣mitted
as being now altogether superfluous.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the merit of these eclogues, it
may justly be asserted, that in simplicity of descripti∣on
and expression, in delicacy and softness of num∣bers,
and in natural and unaffected tenderness, they
are not to be equalled by any thing of the pastoral
kind in the English language.</P>

<P>THIS eclogue, which is entitled Selim, or the

The moral precepts which the intelligent
shepherd delivers to his fellow-swains and virgins,
their companions, are such as would infallibly pro∣mote
the happiness of the pastoral life.</P>

The two <HI>similes</HI> borrowed from rural objects are not
only much, in character, but perfectly natural and ex∣pressive.
There is, notwithstanding, this defect in
the former, that it wants a peculiar propriety; for
purity of thought may as well be applied to <HI>chastity</HI>
as to <HI>modesty;</HI> and from this instance, as well as from
a thousand more, we may see the necessity of distin∣guishing,
in characteristic poetry, every object by
marks and attributes peculiarly its own.</P>
<P>IT cannot be objected to this eclogue that it wants
both these essential <HI>criteria</HI> of the pastoral, love and
the drama; for though it partakes not of the latter,
the former still retains an interest in it, and that too
very material, as it professedly consults the virtue and
happiness of the lover, while it informs what are the
qualities
—that must lead to love.</P>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the advantages that any species of poetry
can derive from the novelty of the subject and
scenery, this eclogue possesses. The rout of a camel∣driver
is a scene that scarce could exist in the imagi∣nation
of an European, and of its attendant distresses
he could have no idea.—These are very happily and
minutely painted by our descriptive poet. What sub∣lime
simpliciry of expression! what nervous plainness
in the opening of the poem!
<Q><L>In silent horror o'er the boundless waste</L>
<L>The driver Hassan with the camels past.</L></Q>
The magic pencil of the poet brings the whole scene
before us at once, as it were by enchantment, and in
this single couplet we feel all the effect that arises from
the terrible wildness of a region unenlivened by the
habitations of men. The verses that describe so mi∣nutely
the camel-driver's little provisions, have a touch∣ing
influence on the imagination, and prepare to en∣ter
more feelingly into his future apprehensions of
distress:
<Q><PB N="88" REF="87"/>
<L>Bethink thee Hassan, where shall thirst assuage,</L>
<L>When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage!</L></Q>
It is difficult to say whether his apostrophe to, the
"mute companions of his toils" is more to be
admired for the elegance and beauty of the poetical
imagery, or for the tenderness and humanity of the
sentiment. He who can read it without being affect∣ed,
will do his heart no injustice, if he concludes it to
be destitute of sensibility:
<Q><L>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</L>
<L>In all my griess a more than equal share!</L>
<L>Here, where no springs in murmur break away,</L>
<L>Or moss-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</L>
<L>Which plains more blest, or verdant vales bestow:</L>
<L>Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are found,</L>
<L>And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.</L></Q>
Yet in these beautiful lines there is a flight error,
which writers of the greatest genius very frequently
fall into.—It will be needless to observe to the accurate
reader that in the fifth and sixth verses there is a ver∣bal
pleonasm, where the poet speaks of the <HI>green</HI> de∣lights
of <HI>verdant</HI> vales. There is an oversight of
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
the same kind, in the Manners, an Ode; where the
poet says,
<Q><L>—Seine's <HI>blue</HI> nymphs deplore,</L>
<L>In <HI>watchet</HI> weeds—</L></Q>
This fault is indeed a common one, but to a reader
of taste it is nevertheless disgustful; and it is menti∣oned
here as the error of a man of genius and judg∣ment,
that men of genius and judgment may guard
against it.</P>
<P>MR. COLLINS speaks like a true Poet as well in sen∣timent
as expression, when, with regard to the thirst
of wealth, he says,
<Q><L>Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,</L>
<L>The gentle voice of peace, or pleasure's song?</L>
<L>Or wherefor think die flowery mountain's side,</L>
<L>The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</L>
<L>Why think we these less pleasing to behold,</L>
<L>Than dreary deserts, if, they lead to gold?</L></Q>
But, however just these sentiments may appear to thofse
who have not revolted from nature and simplicity, had
the author proclaimed them in Lombard-street, or
Cheapside, he would, not have been complimented with
the understanding of the bellman.—A striking proof
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
that our own particular ideas of happiness regulate
our opinions concerning the sense and wisdom of o∣thers!</P>
<P>It is impossible to take leave of this most beautiful
eclogue without paying the tribute of admiration so
justly due to the following nervous lines.
<Q><L>What if the lion in his rage I meet!—</L>
<L>Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when day's declining light</L>
<L>Yields her pale empire to thc mourner night,</L>
<L>By hunger rous'd, he scours the groaning plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt wolves and fullen tygers in his train:</L>
<L>Before them death with shrieks directs their way,</L>
<L>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.</L></Q>
This, amongst many other passages to be met with in
the writings of Collins, shews that his genius was
perfectly capable of the grand and magnificent in de∣scription,
notwithstanding what a learned writer has
advanced to the contrary. Nothing, certainly, could
be more greatly conceived, or more adequately ex∣pressed
than the image in the last couplet.</P>
<P>THAT deception, sometimes used in rhetoric and
poetry, which presents us with an object, or sen∣timent
contrary to what we expected, is here intro∣duced
to the greatest advantage:
<Q><PB N="91" REF="90"/>
<L>Farewell the youth, whom sighs could not detain,</L>
<L>Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain!</L>
<L>Yet as thou go'st, may every blast arise—</L>
<L>Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs!</L></Q>
But this, perhaps, is rather an artificial prettyness,
than a real, or natural beauty.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="eclogue">
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
<HEAD>ECLOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>THAT innocence, and native simplicity of man∣ners,
which, in the first eclogue, was allowed
to constitute the happiness of love, is here beautifully
described in its effects. The Sultan of Persia marries
a Georgian shepherdess, and finds in her embraces
that genuine felicity which unperverted nature alone
can bestow. The most natural and beautiful parts of
this eclogue are those where the fair Sultana refers
with so much pleasure to her pastoral amusements,
and those scenes of happy innocence in which she had
passed her early years; particularly when, upon her
first departure,
<Q><L>Oft as she went, she backward turn'd her view,</L>
<L>And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu.</L></Q>
This picture of amiable simplicity reminds one of that
passage, where Proserpine, when carried off by Plu∣to,
regrets the loss of the flowers she had been ga∣thering.</P>
<Q><L>Collecti flores tunicis cecidere remissis:</L>
<L>Tantaque simplicitas puerilibus adfuit annis,</L>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE beautiful, but unfortunate country, where
the scene of this pathetic eclogue is laid, had
been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its
savage neighbours, when Mr. Collins so affectingly
described its misfortunes. This ingenious man had
not only a pencil to pourtray, but a heart to feel for
the miseries of mankind, and it is with the utmost
tenderness and humanity he enters into the narrative
of Circassia's ruin, while he realizes the scene, and
brings the present drama before us. Of every cir∣cumstance
that could possibly contribute to the tender
effect this pastoral was designed to produce, the poet
has availed himself with the utmost art and address.
Thus he prepares the heart to pity the distresses of
Circassia, by representing it as the scene of the hap∣piest
love.</P>
<Q><L>In fair Circassia, where, to love inclin'd,</L>
<L>Each swain was blest, for every maid was kind.</L></Q>
<P>To give the circumstances of the dialogue a more af∣fecting
solemnity, he makes the time midnight, and
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
describes the two shepherds in the very act of flight
from the destruction that swept over their country:
<Q><L>Sad o'er the dews, two brother shepherds fled,</L>
<L>Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led:</L></Q>
There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet <HI>wilder∣ing,</HI>
which strikes us more forcibly, the more we con∣sider
it.</P>
<P>THE opening of the dialogue is equally happy,
natural and unaffected; when one of the shepherds,
weary and overcome with the flight, calls upon his
companion to review the length of way they had pass∣ed.—This
is, certainly, painting from nature, and the
thoughts, however obvious, or destitute of refinement,
are perfectly in character. But as the closest pursuit
of nature is the surest way to excellence in general,
and to sublimity in particular, in poetical descripti∣on,
so we find that this simple suggestion of the shep∣herd
is not unattended with magnificence. There is
grandeur and variety in the landskip he describes:
<Q><L>And first review that long extended plain,</L>
<L>And yon wide groves, already past with pain!</L>
<L>Yon ragged cliff, whose dangerous path we tried!</L>
<L>And last, this lofty mountain's weary side.</L></Q>
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
There is, in imitative harmony, an act of expressing
a slow and difficult movement by adding to the usual
number of pauses in a verse. This is observable in
the line that describes the ascent of the mountain:
<Q>And last ‖ this losty mountain's ‖ weary side ‖</Q>
Here we find the number of pauses, or musical bars,
which, in an heroic verse, is commonly two, increas∣ed
to three.</P>
<P>THE liquid melody, and the numerous sweetness of
expression in the following descriptive lines is almost
inimitably beautiful:
<Q><L>Sweet to the fight is Zabran's flowery plain,</L>
<L>And once by nymphs and shepherds lov'd in vain!</L>
<L>No more the virgins shall delight to rove</L>
<L>By Sargis' banks, or Irwan's shaddy grove;</L>
<L>On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale,</L>
<L>Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale.</L></Q>
Nevertheless in this delightful landskip there is an ob∣vious
sault: there is no distinction between the plain
of Zabran and the vale of Aly; they are both <HI>flowery,</HI>
and consequently undiversisied. This could not pro∣ceed
from the poet's want of judgment, but from in∣attention:
it had not occurred to him that he had
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
employed the epithet <HI>flowery</HI> twice within so short a
compass; an oversight which those who are accu∣stomed
to poetical, or, indeed, to any other species
of composition, know to be very possible.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more beautifully conceived, or
more pathetically expressed than the shepherd's ap∣prehensions
for his fair country-women, exposed to
the ravages of the invaders.</P>
<Q><L>In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves,</L>
<L>For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves:</L>
<L>In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair,</L>
<L>Their eye's blue languish, and their golden hair!</L>
<L>Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send;</L>
<L>Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend.</L></Q>
<P>There is, certainly, some very powerful charm in the
liquid melody of sounds. The editor of these poems
could never read, or hear the following verse repeat∣ed
without a degree of pleasure otherwise entirely un∣accountable:
<Q>Their eye's <HI>blue languish,</HI> and their <HI>golden hair.</HI></Q>
Such are the Oriental Eclogues, which we leave with
the same kind of anxious pleasure we feel upon a tem∣porary
parting with a beloved friend.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="97"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, etc.</HEAD>
<P>THE genius of COLLINS was capable of every de∣gree
of excellence in lyric poetry, and perfectly
qualified for that high province of the muse. Possess∣ed
of a native ear for all the varieties of harmony and
modulation, susceptible of the finest feelings of ten∣derness
and humanity, but, above all, carried away
by that high enthusiasm, which gives to imagination
its strongest colouring, he was, at once, capable of
soothing the ear with the melody of his numbers, of
influencing the passions by the force of his <HI>pathos,</HI> and
of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of description.</P>
<P>IN consequence of these powers, but, more parti∣cularly,
in consideration of the last, he chose such
subjects for his lyric essays as were most favourable for
the indulgence of description and allegory; where he
could exercise his powers in moral and personal paint∣ing;
where he could exert his invention in con∣ferring
new attributes on images or objects already
known, and described, by a determinate number of
characteristics; where he might give an uncommon
eclat to his figures, by placing them in higher atti∣tudes
<PB N="100" REF="98"/>
or in more advantageous lights, and introduce
new forms from the moral and intellectual world into
the society of inpersonated beings.</P>
<P>SUCH, no doubt, were the advantages he derived
from the descriptive and allegorical nature of his
themes.</P>
<P>IT seems to have been the whole industry of our
author (and it is, at the same time, almost all the
claim to moral excellence his writings can boast) to
promote the influence of the social virtues, by paint∣ing
them in the fairest and happiest lights.
<Q>Melior fieri tuendo,</Q>
would be no improper motto to his poems in general,
but of his lyric poems it seems to be the whole moral
tendency and effect. If, therefor, it should appear
to some readers that he has been more industrious to
cultivate description than sentiment; it may be ob∣served
that his descriptions themselves are sentimental,
and answer the whole end of that species of writing,
by embellishing every feature of virtue, and by con∣veying,
through the effects of the pencil, the finest
moral lessons to the mind.</P>
<P>HORACE speaks of the fidelity of the ear in prese∣rence
to the uncertainty of the eye; but if the mind
receives conviction, it is, certainly, of very little im∣portance
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>
through what medium, or by which of the
senses it is conveyed. The impressions left on the
imagination may, possibly, be thought less durable
than the deposits of the memory, but it may very
well admit of a question whether a conclusion of rea∣son,
or an impression of imagination, will soonest make
its way to the heart. A moral precept conveyed in
words is only an account of truth in its effects; a mo∣ral
picture is truth exemplified; and which is most
likely to gain on the affections, it may not be difficult
to determine.</P>
<P>THIS, however, must be allowed, that those works
approach the nearest to perfection which unite these
powers and advantages; which at once influence the
imagination, and engage the memory; the former
by the force of animated, and striking description,
the latter by a brief but harmonious conveyance of
precept: thus, while the heart is influenced through
the operation of the passions, or the fancy, the effect,
which might otherwise have been transient, is secur∣ed
by the co-operating power of the memory, which
treasures up in a short aphorism the moral of the
scene.</P>
<P>THIS is a good reason, and this, perhaps, is the
only reason that can be given, why our dramatic per∣formances
should generally end with a chain of coup∣lets.
In these the moral of the whole piece is usually
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
conveyed, and that assistance which the memory bor∣rows
from rhyme, as it was probably the original
cause of it, gives its usefulness and propriety even there.</P>
<P>AFTER these apologies for the <HI>descriptive</HI> turn of
the following odes, something remains to be said on
the origin and use of <HI>allegory</HI> in poetical composition.</P>
<P>BY this we are not to understand the trope in the
schools, which is defined <HI>aliud verbis, aliud sensu
ostendere,</HI> and of which Quintilian says, <HI>Usus est, ut
tristia dicamus melioribus verbis, out bonae rei gratia
quaedam contrariis significemus,</HI> etc. It is not the ver∣bal,
but the sentimental allegory, not allegorical ex∣pression
(which, indeed, might come under the term
of <HI>metaphor</HI>) but allegorical imagery, that is here
in question.</P>
<P>WHEN we endeavour to trace this species of figu∣rative
sentiment to its origin, we find it coeval with
literature itself. It is generally agreed that the most
ancient productions are poetical, and it is certain
that the most ancient poems abound with allegorical
imagery.</P>
<P>IF, then, it be allowed that the first literary pro∣ductions
were poetical, we shall have little or no diffi∣culty
in discovering the origin of allegory.</P>
<P>At the birth of letters, in the transition from hiero∣glyphical
to literal expression, it is not to be wonder∣ed
if the custom of expressing ideas by personal ima∣ges
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>
which, had so long prevailed, should still retain
its influence on the mind, though the use of letters
had rendered the practical application of it superflu∣ous.
Those who had been accustomed to exprefs
strength by the image of an elephant, swiftness by
that of a panther, and courage by that of a lion,
would make no scruple of substituting, in letters, the
symbols for the ideas they had been used to repre∣sent.</P>
<P>HERE we plainly see the origin of <HI>allegorical expres∣sion,</HI>
that it arose from the <HI>ashes</HI> of hieroglyphics;
and if to the same cause we should refer that figura∣tive
boldness of style and imagery which distinguish
the oriental writings, we shall, perhaps, conclude
more justly, than if we should impute it to the supe∣rior
grandeur of the eastern genius.</P>
<P>FROM the same source with the <HI>verbal,</HI> we are to
derive the <HI>sentimental</HI> allegory, which is nothing more
than a continuation of the metaphorical or symbolical
expression of the several agents in an action, or the
different objects in a scene.</P>
<P>The latter most peculiarly comes under the denomi∣nation
of allegorical imagery; and in this species of
allegory we include the impersonation of passions, af∣fections,
virtues and vices, <HI>etc.</HI> on account of which,
principally, the following odes were properly termed
by their author, allegorical.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102"/>
WITH respect to the utility of this figurative writ∣ing,
the same arguments, that have been advanced in
favour of descriptive poetry, will be of weight like∣wise
here. It is, indeed from impersonation, or, as
it is commonly termed personification, that poetical
description borrows its chief powers and graces. With∣out
the aid of this, moral and intellectual painting
would be flat and unanimated, and even the scenery
of material objects would be dull without the intro∣duction
of fictitious life.</P>
<P>THESE observations will be most effectually illu∣strated
by the sublime and beautiful odes that occasi∣oned
them: in those it will appear how happily this
allegorical painting may be executed by the genuine
powers of poetical genius, and they will not fail to
prove its force and utility by passing through the ima∣gination
to the heart.</P>

<HEAD>ODE TO PITY.</HEAD>
<Q><L>BY Pella's Bard, a magic name,</L>
<L>By all the griefs his thought could frame,</L>
<L>Receive my humble rite:</L>
<L>Long, Pity, let the nations view</L>
<L>Thy sky-worn robes of tenderest blue,</L>
<L>And eyes of dewy light!</L></Q>
<P>The propriety of invoking Pity through the mediati∣on
of Euripides is obvious.—That admirable poet had
the keys of all the tender passions, and, therefor,
could not but stand in the highest esleem with a wri∣ter
of Mr. COLLIN'S sensibility.—He did,indeed, ad∣mire
him as much, as MILTON professedly did, and
probably for the same reasons; but we do not find
that he has copied him so closely as the last mention∣ed
poet has sometimes done, and particularly in the
opening of Samson-Agonistes, which is an evident i∣mitation
of the following passage in the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>

<P><PB N="106" REF="104"/>
The "eyes of dewy light" is one of the happiest
strokes of imagination, and may be ranked among
those expressions which
<Q>—give us back the image of the mind.</Q>
<Q><L>Wild ARUN too has heard thy strains,</L>
<L>And Echo, 'midst thy native plains,</L>
<L>Been sooth'd, with Pity's lute.</L></Q>
<Q><L>There first the wren thy myrtles shed</L>
<L>On gentlest OTWAY'S infant head.—</L></Q>
Suffex, in which country the Arun is a small river,
had the honour of giving birth to OTWAY as well as
to COLLINS. Both these poets became the objects
of that pity by which their writings are distinguished.
There was a similitude in their genius and in their
sufferings. There was a resemblance in the misfor∣tunes
and in the dissipation of their lives; and the
circumstances of their death cannot be remembered
without pain.</P>
<P>THE thought of painting in the temple of Pity the
history of human misfortunes, and of drawing the
scenes from the tragic muse, is very happy, and in
every respect worthy the imagination of COLLINS.</P>

<HEAD>ODE TO FEAR.</HEAD>
<P>MR. C—who had often determined to apply
himself to dramatic poetry, seems here, with
the same view, to have addressed one of the princi∣pal
powers of the drama, and to implore that mighty
influence she had given to the genius of Shakespear:
<Q><L>Hither again thy fury deal,</L>
<L>Teach me but once like him to feel:</L>
<L>His cypress wreath my meed decree,</L>
<L>And I, O Fear, will dwell with thee!</L></Q>
In the construction of this nervous ode the author has
shewn equal power of judgment and imagination.
Nothing can be more striking than the violent and ab∣rupt
abbreviation of the measure in the fifth and sixth
verses, when he feels the strong influences of the pow∣er
he invokes:
<Q><L>Ah Fear! ah frantic Fear!</L>
<L>I see, I see thee near.</L></Q>
The editor of these poems has met with nothing in
the same species of poetry, either in his own, or in
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>
any other language, equal, in all respects, to the fol∣lowing
description of Danger.
<Q><L>Danger, whose limbs of giant-mold,</L>
<L>What mortal eye can fix'd behold?</L>
<L>Who stalks his round and hideous sorm,</L>
<L>Howling amidst the midnight storm,</L>
<L>Or throws him on the ridgy steep</L>
<L>Of some loose, hanging rock to sleep.</L></Q>
It is impossible to contemplate the image conveyed in
the two last verses without these emotions of terror it
was intended to excite. It has, moreover, the entire
advantage of novelty to recommend it; sor there is
too much originality in all the circumstances to sup∣pose
that the author had in his eye that description
of the penal situation of Cataline in the ninth AEneid:
<Q><L>—Te, Catalina, minaci</L>
<L>Pendentem scopulo—</L></Q>
The archetype of the English poet's idea was in na∣ture,
and probably, to her alone he was indebted, for
the thought. From her, likewise, he derived that
magnificence of conception, that horrible grandeur
of imagery displayed in the following lines.
<Q><PB N="109" REF="107"/>
<L>And those, the fiends, who near allied,</L>
<L>O'er Nature's wounds, and wrecks preside;</L>
<L>While Vengeance, in the lurid air,</L>
<L>Lifts her red arm, expos'd and bare:</L>
<L>On whom the ravening Brood of fate,</L>
<L>Who lap the blood of Sorrow, wait.</L></Q>
That nutritive enthusiasm, which cherishes the seeds of
poetry, and which is, indeed, the only soil wherein
they will grow to perfection, lays open the mind to
ail the influences of fiction. A passion for whatever
is greatly wild, or magnificent in the works of nature,
seduces the imagination to attend to all that is extra∣vagant,
however unnatural. Milton was notorious∣ly
fond of high romance, and gothic <HI>diableries;</HI> and
Collins, who in genius and enthusiasm bore no very
distant resemblance to Milton, was wholly carried a∣way
by the same attachments.
<Q><L>Be mine to read the visions old,</L>
<L>Which thy awakening bards have told:</L>
<L>And, lest thou meet my blasted view,</L>
<L>HOLD EACH STRANGE TALE DEVOUTLY TRUE.</L></Q>

<HEAD>ODE TO SIMPLICITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE measure of the ancient ballad seems to have
been made choice of for this ode, on account
of the subject, and it has, indeed, an air of simplici∣ty,
not altogether unaffecting.</P>
<Q><L>By all the honey'd store</L>
<L>On Hybla's thymy shore,</L>
<L>By all her blooms, and mingled murmurs dear,</L>
<L>By her whose love-lorn woe,</L>

<P>This allegorical imagery of the honey'd store, the
blooms, and mingled murmurs of Hybla, alluding to
the sweetness and beauty of the <HI>attic</HI> poetry, has the
finest and the happiest effect: yet, possibly, it will
bear a question whether the ancient Greek tragedians
had a general claim to simplicity in any thing more
than the plans of their drama. Their language, at
least, was infinitely metaphorical; yet it must be own∣ed
that they justly copied nature and the passions,
and so far, certainly, they were entitled to the palm
of true simplicity: the following most beautiful speech

<HEAD>ODE
On the Poetical Character.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Procul! O! procul este profani!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS ode is so infinitely abstracted and replete
with high enthusiasm, that it will find few readers
capable of entering into the spirit of it, or of relish∣ing
its beauties. There is a style of sentiment as ut∣terly
unintelligible to common capacities, as if the
subject were treated in an unknown language; and it
is on the same account that abstratcted poetry will ne∣ver
have many admirers. The authors of such po∣ems
must be content with the approbation of those
heaven-favoured geniuses, who, by a similiarity of
taste and sentiment, are enabled to penetrate the high
mysterics of inspired fancy, and to pursue the loftiest
flights of enthusiastic imagination. Nevertheless the
praise of the distinguished few is certainly preferable
to the applause of the undiscerning million; for all
praise is valuable in proportion to the judgment of
those who conser it.</P>
<P>As the subject of this ode is uncommon, so are the
style and expression highly metaphorical and abstract∣ed;
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>
thus the sun is called "the rich-hair'd youth of
morn," the ideas are termed "the shadowy tribes
of mind," <HI>etc.</HI> We are struck with the propriety
of this mode of expression here, and it assords us new
proofs of the analogy that subsists between language
and sentiment.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more lostily imagined than the
creation of the Cestus of Fancy in this ode: the alle∣gorical
imagery is rich and sublime: and the obser∣vation
that, the dangerous passions kept aloof, during
the operation, is founded on the strictest philosophical
truth; for poetical fancy can exist only in minds that
are perfectly serene, and in some measure abstracted
from the influences of sense.</P>
<P>THE scene of Milton's "inspiring hour" is per∣fectly
in character, and described with all those wild∣wood
appearances, of which the great poet was so en∣thusiastically
fond:
<Q><L>I view that oak, the fancied glades among,</L>
<L>By which, as Milton lay, his evening ear,</L>
<L>Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>ODE,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ODE TO MERCY.</HEAD>
<P>THE ode written in 1746, and the ode to Mer∣cy,
seem to have been written on the same oc∣casion,
<HI>viz.</HI> the late rebellion; the sormer in memo∣ry
of those heroes who fell in defence of their coun∣try,
the latter to excite sentiments of compassion in
savour of those unhappy and deluded wretches who
became a sacrifice to public justice.</P>
<P>THE language and imagery of both are very beau∣tiful,
but the seene and figures described in the strophe
of the ode to Mercy are exquisitely striking, and would
afford a painter one of the finest subjects in the world.</P>

<PB N="116" REF="114"/>
<HEAD>ODE TO LIBERTY.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient states of Greece, perhaps the only
ones in which a perfect model of liberty ever
existed, are naturaily brought to view in the opening
of the poem.</P>
<Q><L>Who shall awake the Spartan sise,</L>
<L>And call in solemn sounds to life,</L>
<L>The youths whose locks divinely spreading,</L>
<L>Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue, <HI>etc?</HI></L></Q>
<P>There is something extremely bold in this imagery of
the locks of the Spartan youths, and greatly superior
to that deseription Jocasta gives us of the hair of Po∣lynices:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
<Q><L>What new Alcaeus, facy-blest,</L>
<L>Shall sing the sword, in myrtles drest, <HI>etc?</HI></L></Q>
This alludes to a fragment of Alcaeus still remaining,
in which the poet celebrates Harmodius and Aristogi∣ton,
<PB N="117" REF="115"/>
who slew the tyrant Hipparchus, and thereby
restored the liberty of Athens.</P>
<P>THE fall of Rome is here most nervously described
in one line:
<Q>With heaviest sound, a giant-statue, fell.</Q>
The thought seems altogether new, and the imitative
harmony in the structure of the verse is admirable.</P>
<P>AFTER, bewailing the ruin of ancient liberty, the
poet considers the influence it has retained, or still re∣tains,
among the moderns; and here the republics of
Italy naturally engage his attention.—Florence, in∣deed,
only to be lamented on the account of losing
its liberty under those patrons of letters, the Medice∣an
family; the <HI>jealous</HI> Pisa, justly so called in respect to
its long impatience and regret under the same yoke;
and the small Marino, which, however unrespectable
with regard to power or extent of territory, has, at
least, this distinction to boast, that it has preserved
its liberty longer than any other state ancient or mo∣dern,
having, without any revolution, retained its
present mode of government near 1400 years. More∣over
the patron saint who founded it, and from whom
it takes its name, deserves this poetical record, as he
is, perhaps, the only saint that ever contributed to
the establishment of freedom.
<Q><PB N="118" REF="116"/>
<L>Nor e'er her former pride relate,</L>
<L>To sad Liguria's bleeding slate.</L></Q>
In these lines the poet alludes to those ravages in the
state of Genoa, occasioned by the unhappy divisions
of the Guelphs and Gibelines.
<Q><L>—When the savour'd of thy choice,</L>
<L>The daring archer heard thy voice.</L></Q>

<P>THE Flemings were so dreadfully oppressed by this
sanguinary general of Philip the second, that they of∣fered
their sovereignty to Elizabeth; but, happily
for her subjects, she had policy and magnanimity e∣nough
to refuse it. <HI>Deformeaux,</HI> in his <HI>Abrége Chro∣nologique
de l' Histoire d'Espagne,</HI> thus describes the
sufferings of the Flemings. "Le Duc d' Albe ache∣voit

<HEAD>ODE,
To a Lady, on the Death of Colonel CHARLES
ROSS in the Action at Fontenoy.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>Written MAY, MDCCXLV.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE iambic kind of numbers, in which this ode
is conceived, seems as calculated for tender
and plaintive subjects, as for those where strength or
rapidity is required—This, perhaps, is owing to the
repetition of the strain in the same stanza; for sorrow
rejects variety, and affects an uniformity of complaint.
It is needless to observe that this ode is replete with
harmony, spirit, pathos: and there, surely, appears
no reason why the seventh and eighth stanzas should
be omitted in that copy printed in Dodsley's collecti∣on
of poems.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="ode">
<PB N="121" REF="119"/>
<HEAD>ODE TO EVENING.</HEAD>
<P>THE blank ode has for some time solicited ad∣mission
into the English poetry; but its efforts
hitherto seem to have been vain, at least its recepti∣on
has been no more than partial. It remains a que∣stion,
then, whether there is not something in the
nature of blank verse less adapted to the lyric than to
the heroic measure, since, though it has been gene∣rally
received in the latter, it is yet unadopted in the
former. In order to discover this, we are to consider
the different modes of these different species of poetry.
That of the heroic is uniform; that of the lyric is va∣rious:
and in these circumstances of uniformity and
variety, probably, lies the cause why blank verse
has been successful in the one, and unacceptable in
the other. While it presented itself only in one form,
it was familiarized to the ear by custom; but where
it was obliged to assume the different shapes of the ly∣ric
muse, it seemed still a stranger of uncouth figure,
was received rather with curiosity than with pleasure,
and entertained without that ease, or satisfaction,
which acquaintance and familiarity produce—More∣over,
the heroic blank verse obtained a sanction of
infinite importance to its general reception, when it
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
was adopted by one of the greatest poets the world e∣ver
produced, and was made the vehicle of the no∣blest
poem that ever was written. When this poem
at length extorted that applause which ignorance and
prejudice had united to withhold, the versification soon
found its imitators, and became more generally suc∣cessful
than even in those countries from whence it was
imported. But lyric blank verse has met with no such
advantages; for Mr. Collins, whose genius and judg∣ment
in harmony might have given it so powerful an
effect, has left us but one specimen of it in the Ode to
Evening.</P>
<P>IN the choice of his measure he seems to have had
in his eye Horace's ode to Pyrrha; for this ode bears
the nearest resemblance to that mixt kind of the ascle∣piad
and pherecratic verse; and that resemblance in
some degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme, while
it reminds us of those great masters of antiquity,
whose works had no need of this whimsical jingle
of sounds.</P>
<P>FROM the following passage one might be induced
to think that the poet had it in view to render his sub∣ject
and his versification suitable to each other on this
occasion, and that, when he addressed himself to the
sober power of evening, he had thought proper to lay
aside the soppery of rhyme;
<Q><PB N="123" REF="121"/>
<L>Now teach me, Maid compos'd,</L>
<L>To breathe some <HI>sosten'd</HI> strain,</L>
<L>Whose numbers stealing thro' thy dark'ning vale,</L>
<L>May not unseemly with its <HI>stillness</HI> suit;</L>
<L>As, musing slow, I hail</L>
<L>Thy genial, lov'd return!</L></Q>
But whatever were the numbers, or the versification
of this ode, the imagery and enthusiasm it contains
could not fail of rendering it delightful. No other of
Mr. Collins's odes is more generally characteristic of
his genius. In one place we discover his passion for
visionary beings:
<Q><L>For when thy solding star arising shews</L>
<L>His paly circlet, at his warning lamp</L>
<L>The fragrant Hours and Elves</L>
<L>Who slept in buds the day,</L></Q>
<Q><L>And many a nymph, who wreaths her brows with fedge,</L>
<L>And sheds the freshening dew, and, lovelier still,</L>
<L>The pensive pleasures sweet</L>
<L>Prepare thy shadowy car.</L></Q>
In another we behold his strong bias to melancholy:
<Q><PB N="124" REF="122"/>
<L>Then let me rove some wild and heathy scene,</L>
<L>Or find some ruin 'midst its dreary dells,</L>
<L>Whose walls more awful nod</L>
<L>By thy religious gleams.</L></Q>
Then appears his taste for what is wildly grand and
magnificent in nature; when, prevented by storms
from enjoying his evening walk, he wishes for a situ∣ation,
<Q><L>That from the mountain's side,</L>
<L>Views wilds and swelling floods.</L></Q>
And, through the whole, his invariable attachment to
the expression of painting;
<Q><L>—and marks o'er all</L>
<L>Thy dewy fingers draw</L>
<L>The gradual, dusky veil.</L></Q>
It might be a sufficient encomium on this beautiful
ode to observe, that it has been particularly admired
by a lady to whom Nature has given the most perfect
principles of taste. She has not even complained of
the want of rhyme in it, a circumstance by no means
unfavourable to the cause of lyric blank verse; sor
surely, if a fair reader can endure an ode without
bells and chimes, the masculine genius may dispense
with them.</P>

<PB N="125" REF="123"/>
<HEAD>THE MANNERS. AN ODE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the subject and sentiments of this ode, it
seems not improbable that the author wrote it
about the time when he left the University; when, wea∣ry
with the pursuit of academical studies, he no lon∣ger
confined himself to the search of theoretical know∣lege,
but commenced the <HI>scholar of humanity,</HI> to stu∣dy
nature in her works, and man in society.</P>
<P>THE following farewell to science exhibits a very
just as well as striking picture; for however exalted
in the theory the Platonic doctrines may appear, it is
certain that Platonism and Pyrrhonism are nearly al∣lied:
<Q><L>Farewell the porch, whose roof is seen</L>
<L>Arch'd with th' enlivening olive's green:</L>
<L>Where Science, prank'd in tissued vest,</L>
<L>By Reason, Pride, and Fancy drest,</L>
<L>Comes like a bride, so trim array'd,</L>
<L>To wed with Doubt in Plato's shade!</L></Q>
When the mind goes in pursuit of visionary systems,
it is not far from the regions of doubt; and the great∣er
its capacity to think abstractedly, to reason and re∣fine,
<PB N="126" REF="124"/>
the more it will be exposed to and bewildered in
uncertainty.—From an enthusiastic warmth of temper,
indeed, we may for a while be encouraged to persist
in some adopted system; but when that enhusiasm,
which is founded on the vivacity of the passions, gra∣dually
cools and dies away with them, the opinions
it supported drop from us, and we are thrown upon
the inhospitable shore of doubt.—A striking proof of
the necessity of some moral rule of wisdom and vir∣tue,
and some system of happiness established by un∣erring
knowlege and unlimited power!</P>
<P>IN the poet's address to Humour in this ode, there
is one image of singular beauty and propriety. The
ornaments in the hair of <HI>wit</HI> are of such a nature,
and disposed in such a manner, as to be perfectly sym∣bolical
and characteristic:
<Q><L>Me too amidst thy band admit,</L>
<L>There, where the young-ey'd, healthful Wit,</L>
<L>(Whose jewels in his. crisped hair</L>
<L>Are plac'd each other's beams to share,</L>
<L>Whom no delights from thee divide)</L>
<L>In laughter loos'd attends thy side.</L></Q>
Nothing could be more expressive of wit, which con∣sists
in a happy collision of comparative and relative
<PB N="127" REF="125"/>
images, than this reciprocal reflection of light from
the disposition of the jewels.
<Q><L>O Humour, thou whose name is known</L>
<L>To Briton's favour'd isle alone!</L></Q>
The author could only mean to apply this to the
time when he wrote, since other nations had produc∣ed
works of great humour as he himself acknowleges
afterwards.
<Q><L>By old Miletus, <HI>etc.</HI></L>
<L>By all you taught the Tuscan maids, <HI>etc.</HI></L></Q>
The Milesian and Tuscan romances were by no means
distinguished for humour; but as they were the mo∣dels
of that species of writing in which humour was
afterwards employed, they are, probably for that
reason only, mentioned here.</P>

<HEAD>THE PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Ode for Music.</HEAD>
<P>IF the music, which was composed for this ode, had
equal merit with the ode itself, it must have been
the most excellent performance of the kind, in which
poetry and music have, in modern times, united.
Other pieces of the same nature have derived their
greatest reputation from the perfection of the music
that accompanied them, having in themselves little
more merit than that of an ordinary ballad: but in
this we have the whole soul and power of poetry—Expression
that, even without the aid of music, strikes
to the heart; and imagery, of power enough to tran∣sport
the attention without the forceful alliance of
corresponding sounds! what, then, must have been
the effect of these united!</P>
<P>IT is very observable that though the measure is
the same, in which the musical efforts of fear, anger
and despair are described, yet by the variation of the
cadence, the character and operation of each is strong∣ly
expressed: thus particularly of despair:
<Q><PB N="129" REF="127"/>
<L>With woeful measures wan Despair—</L>
<L>Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd,</L>
<L>A solemn, strange and mingled air,</L>
<L>'Twas sad by fits; by starts 'twas wild.</L></Q>
He must be a very unskilful composer who could not
catch the power of imitative harmony from these lines.</P>
<P>THE picture of Hope that follows this is beautiful
almost beyond imitation. By the united powers of ima∣gery
and harmony, that delightful Being is exhibited
with all the charms and graces that pleasure and fan∣cy
have appropriated to her:
<Q><L>Relegat, qui semel percurrit;</L>
<L>Qui nunquam legit, legat.</L></Q>
<Q><L>But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,</L>
<L>What was thy delighted measure?</L>
<L>Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,</L>
<L>And bad the lovely seenes at distance hail!</L>
<L>Still would her touch the strain prolong,</L>
<L>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</L>
<L>She call'd on Echo still thro' all the song;</L>
<L>And where her sweetest theme she chose,</L>
<L>A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,</L>
<L>And Hope enchanted smil'd, and wav'd her gold∣en
hair.</L></Q>
<PB N="130" REF="128"/>
In what an exalted light does the above stanza place
this great master of imagery and harmony! what va∣ried
sweetness of numbers! what delicacy of judg∣ment
and expression! how characteristically does Hope
prolong her strain, repeat her soothing closes, call
upon her associate Echo for the same purposes, and
display every pleasing grace peculiar to her!
<Q>And Hope enchanted smil'd, and wav'd her golden
hair.</Q>
<Q><L>Legat, qui nunquam legit;</L>
<L>Qui semel percurrit, relegat.</L></Q>
The descriptions of joy, jealousy and revenge are ex∣cellent,
though not equally so; those of melancholy
and chearfulness are superior to every thing of the
kind; and, upon the whole, there may be very little
hazard in asserting that this is the finest ode in the
English language.</P>

DEATH OF MR. THOMSON.</HEAD>
<P>MR. COLLINS had <HI>skill to complain.</HI> Of that
mournful melody and those tender images
which are the distinguishing excellencies of such pie∣ces
as bewail departed friendship, or beanty, he was
<PB N="132" REF="130"/>
an almost unequalled master. He knew perfectly to
exhibite such circumstances, peculiar to the objects,
as awaken the influences of pity; and while, from his
own great sensibility, he felt what he wrote, he na∣turally
addressed himself to the feelings of others.</P>
<P>To read such lines as the following, all beautiful
and tender as they are, without corresponding emo∣tions
of pity, is surely impossible:
<Q>The tender thought on thee shall dwell.</Q>

The ode on the death of Thomson seems to have been
written in an excursion to Richmond by water. The
rural scenery has a proper effect in an ode to the me∣mory
of a poet, much of whose merit lay in descrip∣tions
of the same kind, and the appellations of
"Druid" and "meek nature's child" are happily
characteristic. For the better understanding of this
ode, it is necessary to remember that Mr. Thomson
lies buried in the church of Richmond.</P>
