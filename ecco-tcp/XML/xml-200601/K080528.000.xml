<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. QUIN.</STAGE>
<L>I Come not here your Candour to implore</L>
<L>For Scenes, whose Author is, alas! no more;</L>
<L>He wants no Advocate his Cause to plead;</L>
<L>You will yourselves be Patrons of the Dead.</L>
<L>No Party his Benevolence confin'd</L>
<L>No Sect—alike it flow'd to all Mankind.</L>
<L>He lov'd his Friends (forgive this gushing Tear:</L>
<L>Alas! I feel I am no Actor here)</L>
<L>He lov'd his Friends with such a Warmth of Heart,</L>
<L>So clear of Int'rest, so devoid of Art,</L>
<L>Such generous Freedom, such unshaken Zeal,</L>
<L>No Words can speak it, but our Tears may tell.—</L>
<L>O candid Truth, O Faith without a Stain,</L>
<L>O Manners gently firm, and nobly plain,</L>
<L>O sympathizing Love of others Bliss,</L>
<L>Where will you find another Breast like His?—</L>
<L>Such was the Man—the Poet well you know:</L>
<L>Oft has he touch'd your Hearts with tender Woe:</L>
<L>Oft in this crouded House with just Applause</L>
<L>You heard him teach fair Virtue's purest Laws;</L>
<L>For his chaste Muse employ'd her Heav'n-taught Lyre</L>
<L>None but the noblest Passions to inspire,</L>
<L>Not one immoral, one corrupted Thought,</L>
<L>One Line, which dying he could wish to blot.</L>
<L>Oh may To-night your favourable Doom</L>
<L>Another Laurel add to grace his Tomb:</L>
<L>Whilst he, superior now to Praise or Blame,</L>
<L>Hears net the feeble Voice of Human Fame.</L>
<L><PB REF="22"/>
Yet if to those whom most on Earth he lov'd,</L>
<L>From whom his pious Care is now remov'd,</L>
<L>With whom his liberal Hand, and bounteous Heart</L>
<L>Shar'd all his little Fortune could impart,</L>
<L>If to those Friends your kind Regard shall give</L>
<L>What they no longer can from His receive,</L>
<L>That, that, even now, above yon starry Pole,</L>
<L>May touch with Pleasure his immortal Soul.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHENCE is it, TULLUS, that our Arms are stopt</L>
<L>Here on the Borders of the <HI>Roman</HI> State?</L>
<L>Why sleeps that Spirit, whose Heroic Ardour</L>
<L>Urg'dy ou to break the Truce, and pour'd our Host,</L>
<L>From all th'united Cantons of the <HI>Volsci,</HI></L>
<L>On their unguarded Frontier? Such Designs</L>
<L>Brook rot an Hour's Delay; their whole Success</L>
<L>Depends on instant vigorous Execution.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>VOLUSIUS, I approve thy brave Impatience;</L>
<L>And will to thee, in Confidence of Friendship,</L>
<L>Disclose my secret Soul. Thou know'st GALESUS,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
Whose Freedom <HI>CAIUS MARCIUS,</HI> once his Guest,</L>
<L>Of all the Spoil of sack'd <HI>Corioli,</HI></L>
<L>Alone demanded; and who thence to <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>From Gratitude and Friendship, follow'd MARCIUS;</L>
<L>Whence lately to our <HI>Antium</HI> he return'd,</L>
<L>With Overtures of Peace propos'd by <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know him well; an antiquated Sage</L>
<L>Of that romantic School, <HI>Pythagoras</HI></L>
<L>Establish'd here on our <HI>Hesperian</HI> Shore;</L>
<L>Whose gentle Dictates only serve to tame</L>
<L>Enfeebled Mortals into Slaves.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>GALESUS,</L>
<L>Doubtless, possesses many civil Virtues;</L>
<L>Is gentle, good; for Rectitude of Heart</L>
<L>And Innocence of Life by all rever'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pardon me, TULLUS, if my faithful Bluntness</L>
<L>Deems you too lib'ral in his Praise. In Peace,</L>
<L>Such may perhaps do well, when Prating rules</L>
<L>An idle World; but in tempestuous Times</L>
<L>They are stark naught, these visionary Statesmen,</L>
<L>Fit Rulers only for their golden Age.</L>
<L>The rugged Genius of rapacious <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>For other Men, and other Counsels, calls.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Thoughts are mine—I only meant to tell thee</L>
<L>The Part he bears in this ill-tim'd Delay.</L>
<L>Soon as our gather'd Army march'd from <HI>Antium,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, whose attentive Caution</L>
<L>Watch'd all our Motions, took at once th' Alarm</L>
<L>And sent a Herald, ere we past their Borders,</L>
<L>With formal Ceremony, to demand</L>
<L>The Cause of our Approach.—Had I been Master,</L>
<L>I would have answer'd at the Gates of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>But this GALESUS, who attends our Camp</L>
<L>Among the <HI>Volscian</HI> Deputies, so pleaded</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
The Laws of Nations, made such loud Complaints</L>
<L>Against th' Infraction of the Publick Faith,</L>
<L>So teaz'd us with the Pedantry of States,</L>
<L>That I was forc'd, unwilling, to permit</L>
<L>His Freedman, TITUS, to be sent to <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>With our Demands. If these the Senate grants,</L>
<L>We then are in the Toils of Peace entangled,</L>
<L>In spite of all my Efforts to avoid them.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O 'tis a wild Chimera! Peace with <HI>Rome!</HI></L>
<L>Dream not of that, unless die <HI>Volscian</HI> Courage</L>
<L>Be quite subdu'd, and only seeks to gild</L>
<L>A vile Submission with that specious Name.</L>
<L>Learn Wisdom from your Neighbours. Peace with
<HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>Has quell'd the <HI>Latines,</HI> tam'd their free-born Spirit,</L>
<L>And by her Friendship honour'd them with Chains.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>She ne'er will grant it on the just Conditions</L>
<L>I now have brought the <HI>Volsci</HI> to demand:</L>
<L>The Restitution of our conquer'd Cities,</L>
<L>And fair Alliance upon equal Terms.</L>
<L>I know the <HI>Roman</HI> Insolence will scorn</L>
<L>To yield to this: and TITUS must return</L>
<L>Within three Days, the longest Term allow'd him;</L>
<L>Of which the Third is near elaps'd already.</L>
<L>Then even GALESUS will not dare to stop us,</L>
<L>With superstitious Forms, and solemn Trisles,</L>
<L>From letting loose th'unbridled Rage of War</L>
<L>Against those hated Tyrants of <HI>Hesperia.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thanks to the Gods! my Sword will then be free.</L>
<L>Then, poor <HI>Corioli!</HI> thy bleeding Wounds,</L>
<L>Thy Treasures sack'd, thy captivated Matrons,</L>
<L>Shall amply be reveng'd by thy VOLUSIUS:</L>
<L>Then, TULLUS, from the losty Brows of MARCIUS</L>
<L>Thou may'st regain the wreaths his conquering hand,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
By partial Fortune aided, tore from thine.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O my VOLUSIUS! thou, who art a Soldier,</L>
<L>A try'd and brave one too, say, in thy Heart</L>
<L>Dost thou not scorn me? thou, who saw'st me bend</L>
<L>Beneath the half-spent Thunder of a Foe,</L>
<L>Warm from the Conquest of <HI>Corioli,</HI></L>
<L>Which, rushing furious in with those, whose Sally</L>
<L>He had repell'd, he feiz'd almost alone;</L>
<L>And gave to Fire and Sword. Yet thence he flew,</L>
<L>Scorning the Plunder of our richest City,</L>
<L>His Wounds undrest, without a Moment's Respite,</L>
<L>To where our Armies on the fearful Edge</L>
<L>Of Battle stflood; and, asking of the Consul</L>
<L>To be oppos'd to me, with mighty Rage,</L>
<L>Resistless, bore us down.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLUSIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>True Valour, TULLUS,</L>
<L>Lies in the Mind, the never-yielding Purpose,</L>
<L>Nor owns the blind Award of giddy Fortune.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Soul, my Friend, my Soul is all on Fire!</L>
<L>Thirst of Revenge consumes me! the Revenge</L>
<L>Of generous Emulation, not of Hatred.</L>
<L>This happy <HI>Roman,</HI> this proud MARCIUS haunts me.</L>
<L>Each troubled Night when Slaves and Captives sleep,</L>
<L>Forgetful of their Chains, I, in my Dreams,</L>
<L>Anew am vanquish'd; and, beneath his Sword</L>
<L>With Horror sinking, feel a tenfold Death,</L>
<L>The Death of Honour. But I will redeem—</L>
<L>Yes, MARCIUS, I will yet redeem my Fame.</L>
<L>To face thee once again is the great Purpose</L>
<L>For which alone I live.—Till then how slow,</L>
<L>How tedious lags the Time! while Shame corrodes
me,</L>
<L>With many a bitter Thought; and injur'd Honour</L>

<L>"Mother, you have no more a Son; and thou,</L>

<L>WHAT is the Mind of Man? A restless Scene</L>
<L>Of Vanity and Weakness; shifting still,</L>
<L>As shift the Lights of our uncertain Knowlege;</L>
<L>Or as the various Gale of Passion breathes.</L>
<L>None ever thought himself more deeply founded</L>
<L>On what is right, nor felt a nobler Ardor,</L>
<L>Than I, when I invested CAIUS MARCIUS</L>
<L>With this ill-judg'd Command. Now it appears</L>
<L>Distraction, Folly, monstrous Folly! Meanness!</L>
<L>And down I plunge, betray'd even by my Virtue,</L>
<L>From Gulph to Gulph, from Shame to deeper Shame.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I listen'd, TULLUS, to th' important Scene</L>
<L>That lately pass'd before us, with most strict</L>
<L>Unprejudic'd Attention; and have since</L>
<L>Revolv'd it in my Mind, both as a Man,</L>
<L>Ally,d to all Mankind, and as a <HI>Volscian.</HI></L>
<L>Indeed our Terms are high, and by the Manner</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="43"/>
In which they were prescrib'd by CORIOLANUS,</L>
<L>Are what we cannot hope will e'er be granted.</L>
<L>They should be soften'd. Let us yield a little,</L>
<L>Conscious ourselves to a great Nation's Pride,</L>
<L>The Pride of human Nature. Could the <HI>Romans</HI></L>
<L>Stoop to such Peace, commanded by the Sword,</L>
<L>They then were Slaves, unworthy our Alliance.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Gods! do I hear in thee, one of the Chiefs</L>
<L>Intrusted with the Honour of the <HI>Volsci,</HI></L>
<L>An Advocate for <HI>Rome?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I glory, TULLUS,</L>
<L>To own myself an Advocate for Peace.</L>
<L>Peace is the happy natural State of Man;</L>
<L>War his Corruption, his Disgrace—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>His Safeguard!</L>
<L>His Pride! his Glory!—What but War, just War,</L>
<L>Gave <HI>Greece</HI> her Heroes? Those who drew the Sword</L>
<L>(As we do now) against the Sons of Rapine;</L>
<L>To quell proud Tyrants, and to free Mankind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, TULLUS, when to just Defence the Warrior</L>
<L>Confines his Force, he is a worship'd Name,</L>
<L>Dear to Mankind, the First and Best of Mortals!</L>
<L>Yet still, if this can by soft Means be done,</L>
<L>And fair Accommodation, that is better.</L>
<L>Why should we purchase with the Blood of Thou∣sands,</L>
<L>What may be gain'd by mutual just Concession?</L>
<L>Why give up Peace, the best of human Blessings,</L>
<L>For the vain cruel Pride of useless Conquest?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>These soothing Dreams of philosophic Quiet</L>
<L>Are only fit for unfrequented Shades.</L>
<L>The Sage should quit the busy bustling World</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="44"/>
Ill suited to his gentle Meditations,</L>
<L>And in some Desart find that Peace he loves.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mistaken Man! Philosophy consists not</L>
<L>In airy Schemes, or idle Speculations:</L>
<L>The Rule and Conduct of all social Life</L>
<L>Is her great Province. Not in lonely Cells</L>
<L>Obscure she lurks, but holds her heavenly Light</L>
<L>To Senates and to Kings, to guide their Councils,</L>
<L>And teach them to reform and bless Mankind.</L>
<L>All Policy but her's is false, and rotten;</L>
<L>All Valour not conducted by her Precepts</L>
<L>Is a destroying Fury sent from Hell</L>
<L>To plague unhappy Man, and ruin Nations.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To stop the Waste of that destroying Fury,</L>
<L>Is the great Cause and Purpose of this War.</L>
<L>Art thou a Friend to Peace?—subdue the <HI>Romans.</HI></L>
<L>Who, who, but they, have turn'd this antient Land,</L>
<L>Where, from <HI>Saturnian</HI> Times, harmonious Concord</L>
<L>Still lov'd to dwell, into a Scene of Blood,</L>
<L>Of endless Discord, and perpetual Rapine?</L>
<L>The Sword, the vengeful Sword, must drain away</L>
<L>This boiling Blood, that thus disturbs the Nations!</L>
<L>Talk not of Terms. It is a vain Attempt</L>
<L>To bind th' Ambitious and Unjust by Treaties:</L>
<L>These they elude a thousand specious Ways;</L>
<L>Or if they cannot find a fair Pretext,</L>
<L>They blush not in the Face of Heaven to break them.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why then affronted Heaven will combat for us.</L>
<L>Set Justice on our Side, and then my Voice</L>
<L>Shall be as loud for War as thine; my Sword</L>
<L>Shall strike as deep; at least my Blood shall flow</L>
<L>As freely, TULLUS, in my Country's Cause.</L>
<L>But as I then would die to serve the <HI>Volscians,</HI></L>
<L>So now I dare to serve them by opposing,</L>
<L>Even with my single Voice, th' impetuous Torrent</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="45"/>
That hurries us away beyond the Bounds</L>
<L>Of temperate Wisdom; and presume to tell thee,</L>
<L>It is thy Passion, not thy Prudence dictates</L>
<L>This haughty Language.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, it is my Passion,</L>
<L>A Passion for the Glory of my Country,</L>
<L>That scorns your narrow Views of timid Prudence.</L>
<L>Our injur'd Honour drew our Swords, and never</L>
<L>Shall they be sheath'd while I command the <HI>Volscians,</HI></L>
<L>Till <HI>Rome</HI> submits to <HI>Antium.</HI>—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Rome</HI> will perish</L>
<L>Ere she submit; and she has still her Walls,</L>
<L>The Strength of her Allies, her native Valour,</L>
<L>Which oft has sav'd her in the worst Extremes,</L>
<L>And, stronger yet than all, Despair, to aid her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TULLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>All these will nought avail her, if our Fears</L>
<L>Come not to her Assistance—But, GALESUS,</L>
<L>Why urge you this to me? Go, talk to MARCIUS.</L>
<L>The War has given him all his Pride could hope for,</L>
<L>To see <HI>Rome</HI>'s Senate humbled at his Feet:</L>
<L>He now may wish to reign in Peace at <HI>Antium,</HI></L>
<L>And thou, perhaps, art come an Envoy from him,</L>
<L>To learn if I shall prove a quiet Subject.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GALESUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thro' this unguarded Opening of thy Soul,</L>
<L>I see what stings thee—Ah! beware of Envy!</L>
<L>If that pale Fury seize thee, thou art lost!</L>
<L>TULLUS, 'tis easier far, from the clear Breast,</L>
<L>To keep out treacherous Vice, than to expel it.</L>
<L>Farewel. Remember I have done my Duty.</L>

<L><PB N="40" REF="46"/>
Must I now seek to hide them? O Misfortune!</L>
<L>To have reduc'd myself to such a State,</L>
<L>So much beneath the Greatness of my Soul,</L>

<L>The wretched Arts of vile Dissimulation!</L>

<L>Another Day will bring them to its Aid.</L>

To me? to me! thy Equal in Command?</L>

<L>Was it to Them, or Me, you hither came</L>

<L>I rais'd you from the Dust, a wretched Exile,</L>

<L>O ill-plac'd Confidence! What for all this</L>

<L><PB N="42" REF="48"/>
Of black Ingratitude. On what Foundations?</L>
<L>What have I done to merit such a Charge?</L>

<L><HI>Volscian</HI> Fathers,</L>
<L>And ye, brave Soldiers, see an awful Scene,</L>
<L>Demanding serious solemn Meditation.</L>
<L>This Man was once the Glory of his Age,</L>
<L>Disinterested, just, with every Virtue</L>
<L>Of civil Life adorn'd, in Arms unequall'd.</L>
<L>His only Blot was this; That, much provok'd,</L>
<L>He rais'd his vengeful Arm against his Country.</L>
<L>And, lo! the righteous Gods have now chastis'd him,</L>
<L>Even by the Hands of those for whom he fought.</L>

Whatever private Views and Passions plead,</L>
<L>No Cause can justify so black a Deed:</L>
<L>These, when the angry Tempest clouds the Soul,</L>
<L>May darken Reason, and her Course controul;</L>
<L>But when the Prospect clears, her startled Eye</L>
<L>Must from the treacherous Gulph with Horror fly,</L>
<L>On whose wild Wave, by stormy Passions tost,</L>
<L>So many hapless Wretches have been lost.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY
Mrs. WOFFINGTON.</STAGE>
<L>WELL! Gentlemen! and are you still so vain</L>
<L>To treat our Sex with arrogant Disdain,</L>
<L>And think, to you alone by partial Heav'n</L>
<L>Superior Sense and sovereign Pow'r are given.</L>
<L>When in the Story told To-night, you find,</L>
<L>With what a boundless Sway we rule the Mind,</L>
<L>And, by a few soft Words of ours, with Ease,</L>
<L>Can turn the proudest Hearts just where we please?</L>
<L>If an old Mother had such pow'rful Charms,—</L>
<L>To stop a stubborn <HI>Roman</HI>'s conquering Arms,—</L>
<L>Soldiers and Statesmen of these Days, with you</L>
<L>What think you wou'd a fair young Mistress do?</L>
<L>If with my grave Discourse, and wrinkled Face,</L>
<L>I thus could bring a Hero to Disgrace,</L>
<L>How absolutely may I hope to reign</L>
<L>Now I am turn'd to my own Shape again !</L>
<L>However, I will use my Empire well;</L>
<L>And, if I have a certain magic Spell</L>
<L><PB REF="70"/>
Or in my Tongue, or Wit, or Shape, or Eyes,</L>
<L>Which can subdue the Strong, and fool the Wise,</L>
<L>Be not alarm'd: I will not interfere</L>
<L>In State-Affairs, nor undertake to steer,</L>
<L>The Helm of Government,—as we are told</L>
<L>Those Female Politicians did of old:</L>
<L>Such dangerous Heights I never wish'd to climb—</L>
<L>Thank Heav'n! I better can employ my Time—</L>
<L>Ask you to what my Pow'r I shall apply?</L>
<L>To make my Subjects blest, is my Reply.</L>
<L>My Purposes are gracious all, and kind,</L>
<L>Some may be told—and some may be divin'd:</L>
<L>One, which at present I have most at Heart,</L>
<L>To you without Reserve I will impart:</L>
<L>It is my Sovereign Will,—Hear, and obey,—</L>
<L>That you with Candour treat this <HI>Orphan Play.</HI></L>
