<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE I have ventur'd to write a Poem on a Gentle∣man who is universally acknowledg'd to be the Honour of our Country as a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> prompted by the same Ambition, I address it to her most il∣lustrious <HI>Patriot.</HI></P>
<P>Tho', by the wise Choice of the best of <HI>Kings,</HI> you are engag'd in the highest and most active Scenes of Life, balancing the Power of <HI>Europe,</HI> watch∣ing over our common Welfare, infor∣ming the whole Body of Society and Commerce, and even like Heaven dis∣pensing Happiness to the Discontented

and Ungrateful; tho' thus gloriously employ'd, yet are you not less atten∣tive, in the Hour of Leisure, to the Variety, Beauty, and Magnificence of Nature, nor less delighted, and asto∣nish'd at the Discoveries of the incom∣parable <HI>Newton.</HI> The same compre∣hensive Genius which Way soever it looks must have a steady, clear, and unbounded Prospect.</P>
<P>But not to encroach any further on your important Moments all devoted to the Good of Mankind, I once more plead the Dignity of my Subject for my Excuse in this Approach, and beg Leave to subscribe my self, with the sincerest Veneration,</P>

<HEAD>A POEM Sacred to the Memory of Sir ISAAC NEWTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>HALL the great Soul of NEWTON quit this Earth,</L>
<L>To mingle with his Stars, and every Muse,</L>
<L>Astonish'd into Silence, shun the Weight</L>
<L>Of Honours due to his illustrious Name!</L>
<L>But what can Man?—Even now the Sons of Light,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
In Strains such as delight the Ear of GOD,</L>
<L>Hail his Arrival on the Coasts of Bliss.</L>
<L>Yet am not I deterr'd, tho' high the Theme,</L>
<L>And sung to Harps of Angels; for with you,</L>
<L><HI>Aetherial Flames!</HI> ambitious I aspire</L>
<L>In Nature's general Symphony to join.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND what new Wonders can ye show your Guest!</L>
<L>Who, while on this dim Spot where Mortals toil</L>
<L>Clouded in Dust, from <HI>Motion</HI>'s simple Laws</L>
<L>Could trace the boundless Hand of Providence,</L>
<L>Wide-working thro' this universal Frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAVE ye not listen'd while he bound the <HI>Suns,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Planets</HI> to their Spheres! Th' unequal Task</L>
<L>Of Humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd</L>
<L>O'er erring Man the Year, and oft disgrac'd</L>
<L>The Pride of Schools, before their Course was known</L>
<L>Full in its Causes and Effects to Him,</L>
<L>All-piercing Sage! Who sat not down and dreamt</L>
<L>Romantic Schemes, defended by the Din</L>
<L>Of specious Words, and Tyranny of Names,</L>
<L>But bidding his amazing Mind attend,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
And with heroick Patience Years on Years</L>
<L>Deep-searching, saw at last the System dawn,</L>
<L>And shine, of all his Race, on him alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT were his Raptures then! how pure! how strong!</L>
<L>And what the Triumphs of old <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>By his diminish'd, but the Pride of Boys</L>
<L>In some small Fray victorious! When instead</L>
<L>Of shatter'd Parcels of this Earth usurp'd</L>
<L>By Violence unmanly, and sore Deeds</L>
<L>Of Cruelty and Blood, <HI>Nature herself</HI></L>
<L>Stood all subdu'd by him, and open laid</L>
<L>Her every latent Glory to his View.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND first our <HI>solar System</HI> he survey'd</L>
<L>With accurate Ken, and by the mingling Power</L>
<L>Of <HI>Gravitation</HI> and <HI>Projection</HI> saw</L>
<L>The whole in silent Harmony revolve.</L>
<L>Drawn to his lengthen'd Eye th' attending <HI>Moons,</HI></L>
<L>Design'd to chear remoter Planets, were</L>
<L>By him in all their mix'd Proportions seen.</L>
<L>He also fix'd the wandering <HI>Queen of Night,</HI></L>
<L>Whether she wanes into a scanty Orb▪</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Or waxing broad with her pale shadowy Light</L>
<L>In a soft Deluge overflows the Sky.</L>
<L>Her every Motion clear discerning, He</L>
<L>Adjusted to th' obsequious <HI>Main,</HI> and taught</L>
<L>Why now the mighty Mass of Waters swells</L>
<L>Resistless, heaving on the broken Rocks,</L>
<L>And the full River turning; till again</L>
<L>The Tide revertive, unattracted, leaves</L>
<L>A Yellow Waste of idle Sands behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN breaking hence, he took his ardent Flight</L>
<L>Thro' the blue Infinite; and every <HI>Star,</HI></L>
<L>Which the clear Concave of a Winter's Night</L>
<L>Pours on the Eye, or Astronomic Tube,</L>
<L>Far-stretching, snatches from the dark Abyss,</L>
<L>Or such as farther in successive Skies</L>
<L>To Fancy only shine, at his Approach</L>
<L>Blaz'd into <HI>Suns.</HI> Th' enlivening Centre each</L>
<L>Of an harmonious System. All, combin'd,</L>
<L>And rul'd unerring by that single Power</L>
<L>Which draws the Stone projected to the Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O UNPROFUSE Magnificence divine!</L>
<L>O <HI>Wisdom</HI> truly perfect! thus to call</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
From a few Causes such a Scheme of Things,</L>
<L>Effects so various, beautiful, and great,</L>
<L>An Universe compleat! And O Belov'd</L>
<L>Of Heaven! into th' Almighty's Councils thus</L>
<L>To be admitted, and allow'd to scan</L>
<L>The rising, moving, wide-establish'd Frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE too, unbaffled in his Aim, pursu'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Comet</HI> to' the long Elliptic Curve,</L>
<L>As round innumerous Worlds he wound his Way,</L>
<L>Till to the Forehead of the Evening-Sky</L>
<L>Reduc'd, the blazing Wonder glares anew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Heavens are all his own. Finish'd by him</L>
<L>The fair Discovery lies; and every Eye</L>
<L>May lay the useless Telescope aside,</L>
<L>Unless it be to hold the great Acquests</L>
<L>By <HI>Newton</HI> made: Who from the wild Domain</L>
<L>Of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Des Cartes.</NOTE> <HI>French Dreamer</HI> rescu'd Heaven and Earth.</L>
<L>All <HI>Europe</HI> stood appall'd; but found it vain</L>
<L>To keep at Odds with Demonstration strong,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
And lingering to resist the awakening Force</L>
<L>Of Truth. At once their pleasing Visions fled,</L>
<L>With the gay Shadows of the Morning mix'd,</L>
<L>When <HI>Newton</HI> rose, our Philosophic Sun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TH' Aerial Flow of <HI>Sound</HI> was known to Him,</L>
<L>From whence it first in wavy Circles breaks,</L>
<L>Till the touch'd Organ takes the Message in.</L>
<L>Nor could the darting <HI>Beam,</HI> of Speed immense,</L>
<L>Escape his swift Pursuit, and measuring Glance.</L>
<L>Even <HI>Light it self,</HI> which every thing displays,</L>
<L>Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter Mind</L>
<L>Untwisted all the shining Robe of Day;</L>
<L>And from the whitening, undistinguish'd Blaze,</L>
<L>Collecting every Ray into his Kind,</L>
<L>To the charm'd Eye educ'd the gorgeous Train</L>
<L>Of <HI>Parent-Colours.</HI> First the flaming <HI>Red</HI></L>
<L>Sprung vivid forth; the tawny <HI>Orange</HI> next;</L>
<L>And then delicious <HI>Yellow;</HI> by whose Side</L>
<L>Fell the kind Beams of all-refreshing <HI>Green.</HI></L>
<L>Then the pure <HI>Blue</HI> that swells autumnal Skies</L>
<L>Aetherial play'd; and then of sadder Hue</L>
<L>Emerg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the deepen'd <HI>Indico,</HI> as when</L>
<L>The heavy-skirted Evening droops with Frost.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
While the last Gleanings of refracted Light</L>
<L>Dy'd in the fainting <HI>Violet</HI>away.</L>
<L>These, when the Clouds distil the rosy Shower,</L>
<L>Shine out distinct adown the watry Bow,</L>
<L>While o'er our Heads the dewy Vision bends</L>
<L>Delightful, melting on the Fields beneath.</L>
<L>Myriads of mingling Dies from these result,</L>
<L>And Myriads still remain, th' exhaustless Source</L>
<L>Of Beauty ever-flushing, ever-new!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DID ever Poet image ought so fair,</L>
<L>Dreaming in whispering Groves, by the hoarse Brook!</L>
<L>Or Prophet, to whose Rapture Heav'n descends!</L>
<L>Even now the setting Sun and liveri'd Clouds,</L>
<L>Seen, <HI>Greenwich,</HI> from thy lovely Heights, declare</L>
<L>How just, how beauteous the refractive Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE noiseless <HI>Tide of Time,</HI> all bearing down</L>
<L>To vast <HI>Eternity</HI>'s unbounded Sea</L>
<L>Where the green Islands of the Happy shine,</L>
<L>He backward stem'd alone; and to it's Source</L>
<L>Ascending, mark'd it's Periods, and hung out</L>
<L>His Lights at equal Distances to guide</L>
<L>Historian, wilder'd on his darksome Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>BUT who can number up his Labours? Who</L>
<L>His high Discoveries sing? When but a few</L>
<L>Of the deep-studying Race can stretch their Minds</L>
<L>To image what he knew, as clear as they</L>
<L>The Truths self-evident with which he link'd</L>
<L>His far thest Views. For is there ought that's great.</L>
<L>That's wonderful, and hard, deterring Search?</L>
<L>That was his Prize! and worthy of his Toil</L>
<L>Unfailing, Who the lonely <HI>Monarch</HI> reign'd</L>
<L>Of <HI>Science</HI> thin-inhabited below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT Wonder then that his <HI>Devotion</HI> swell'd</L>
<L>Responsive to his Knowledge! For could he,</L>
<L>Whose piercing mental Eye diffusive saw</L>
<L>The finish'd University of Things,</L>
<L>In all its Order, Magnitude, and Parts,</L>
<L>Forbear incessant to adore that Power</L>
<L>Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAY, ye who best can tell, ye happy few,</L>
<L>Who saw him in the softest Lights of Life,</L>
<L>All unwithheld, indulging to his Friends</L>
<L>The vast, unborrow'd Treasures of his Mind.</L>
<L>O speak the wondrous Man! how mild, how calm,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
How greatly humble, how divinely good,</L>
<L>How firm, establish'd on eternal Truth,</L>
<L>Pure as his Faith, and active as his Love,</L>
<L>Fervent in doing well, with every Nerve</L>
<L>Still pressing on, forgetful of the Past,</L>
<L>And panting for Perfection! far above</L>
<L>Those little Cares, and visionary Joys</L>
<L>That so befool the fond, impassion'd Heart</L>
<L>Of over-cheated, ever-trusting Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND say, ye downward, gloomy-minded Tribe,</L>
<L>Ye who, unconscious of those nobler Flights</L>
<L>That reach impatient at immortal Life,</L>
<L>Against the Prime, indearing Privilege</L>
<L>Of <HI>Being</HI> dare contend, say can a Soul</L>
<L>Of such extensive, deep, tremendous Powers▪</L>
<L>Enlarging still, be but a finer Breath</L>
<L>Of Spirits dancing thro' their Tubes awhile▪</L>
<L>And then for ever lost in vacant Air?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT hark! Methinks I hear a warning Voice,</L>
<L>Solemn as when some awful Change is come,</L>
<L>Sound thro' the World—<HI>"He's dead.—The Measure's full,</HI></L>
<L>"And I resign my Charge.—<HI>Ye mouldering Stones</HI></L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
That build the towring Pyramid, the proud</L>
<L>Triumphal Arch, the Monument effac'd</L>
<L>By ruthless Ruin, and whate'er supports</L>
<L>The worship'd Name of grey Antiquity,</L>
<L>Down to the Dust! What Grandeur can ye boast</L>
<L>While <HI>Newton</HI> lifts his Column to the Skies</L>
<L>Beyond the Waste of Time!—Let no weak Drop</L>
<L>Be shed for him. The Beauty in her Bloom</L>
<L>Cut off, the Joyous Youth, and darling Child,</L>
<L>These are the Tombs that claim the tender Tear,</L>
<L>And Elegiac Song, but <HI>Newton</HI> calls</L>
<L>For other Notes of Gratulation high,</L>
<L>That now he wanders thro' those endless Worlds</L>
<L>He here so well descry'd, and wondering talks,</L>
<L>And Hymns their Author with his glad Compeers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O BRITAIN'S Boast! Whether with Angels thou</L>
<L>Sittest in dread Discourse, or Fellow Saints</L>
<L>Who joy to see the Honour of their Kind;</L>
<L>Or whether mounted on Cherubic Wing,</L>
<L>Thy swift Career is with the whirling Spheres,</L>
<L>Comparing Things with Things, in Rapture lost</L>
<L>And lowly Adoration for that Light</L>
<L>So plenteous ray'd into thy Mind below,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
From Light himself, O look with Pity down</L>
<L>On Humankind, a frail, erroncous Race!</L>
<L>Asswage the Madness of a frantic World!</L>
<L>But chiefly o'er thy Country's Cause preside,</L>
<L>And be her <HI>Genius</HI> call'd! Her Council steer,</L>
<L>Correct her Manners, and inspire her Youth!</L>
<L>For, guilty as she is, she brought thee forth,</L>
<L>And glorious in thy Name; she points thee out</L>
<L>To all her Sons, and bids them eye thy Star:</L>
<L>While in Expectance of th' arrousing Blast,</L>
<L>When Time shall be no more, thy sacred Dust</L>
<L>Sleeps with her Kings, and dignifies the Scene.</L>
