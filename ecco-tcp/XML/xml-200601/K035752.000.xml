<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM A Lady in <HI>ENGLAND</HI>; TO A GENTLEMAN at <HI>AVIGNON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO Thee, dear Rover, and thy vanquish'd Friends,</L>
<L>The Health, she wants, thy gentle <HI>Chloe</HI> sends:</L>
<L>Though much You suffer, think I suffer more,</L>
<L>Worse than an Exile on my Native Shore.</L>
<L>Companions in your Master's Flight you roame,</L>
<L>Unenvy'd by your haughty Foes at home;</L>
<L>For-ever near the Royal Outlaw's side</L>
<L>You share his Fortunes, and his Hopes divide,</L>
<L>On glorious Schemes, and Thoughts of Empire dwell,</L>
<L>And with Imaginary Titles swell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say (for thou know'st I own his sacred Line,</L>
<L>The Passive Doctrine, and the Right Divine)</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Say, what new Succours do's the Chief prepare?</L>
<L>The Strength of Armies? Or the Force of Pray'r?</L>
<L>Do's he from Heav'n or Earth his Hopes derive?</L>
<L>From Saints Departed? Or from Priests Alive?</L>
<L>Nor Saints nor Priests can <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Troops withstand,</L>
<L>And Beads drop useless through the Zealot's Hand;</L>
<L>Heav'n to our Vows may Future Kingdoms owe,</L>
<L>But Skill and Courage win the Crowns below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E're to thy Cause, and Thee, my Heart inclin'd,</L>
<L>Or Love to Party had seduce'd my Mind,</L>
<L>In Female Joys I took a dull Delight,</L>
<L>Slept all the Morn, and Punted half the Night:</L>
<L>But now, with Fears and publick Cares possest,</L>
<L>The Church, the Church, for-ever breaks my Rest.</L>
<L>The <HI>Post-Boy</HI> on my Pillow I explore,</L>
<L>And sift the News of ev'ry foreign Shore,</L>
<L>Studious to find new Friends, and new Allies;</L>
<L>What Armies march from <HI>Sueden</HI> in Disguise;</L>
<L>How <HI>Spain</HI> prepares her Banners to unfold,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rome</HI> deals out her Blessings, and her Gold:</L>
<L>Then o'er the Map my Finger, taught to stray,</L>
<L>Cross many a Region marks the winding Way;</L>
<L>From Sea to Sea, from Realm to Realm I rove,</L>
<L>And grow a mere Geographer by Love.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
But still <HI>Avignon,</HI> and the pleasing Coast</L>
<L>That holds Thee banish'd, claims my Care the most,</L>
<L>Oft on the well-known Spot I fix my Eyes,</L>
<L>And Span the Distance that between us lies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not our <HI>James,</HI> tho' foil'd in Arms, Despair,</L>
<L>Whilst on his Side he reckons half the Fair:</L>
<L>In <HI>Britain</HI>'s lovely Isle a shining Throng</L>
<L>War in his Cause, a thousand Beauties strong.</L>
<L>Th' unthinking Victors vainly boast their Pow'rs;</L>
<L>Be Theirs the Musquet, while the Tongue is Ours.</L>
<L>We Reason with such Fluency and Fire,</L>
<L>The Beaux we baffle, and the Learned tire,</L>
<L>Against her Prelates plead the Churche's Cause,</L>
<L>And from our Judges vindicate the Laws.</L>
<L>Then mourn not, hapless Prince, thy Kingdoms lost,</L>
<L>A Crown, tho' late, thy sacred Brow may boast;</L>
<L>Heav'n seems through Us thy Empire to decree,</L>
<L>Those who Win Hearts, have giv'n their Hearts to Thee.</L>
<L>What Dames! what Doctors in thy Cause combine!</L>
<L>What Petticoats in Either Sex are Thine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ha'st thou not heard that, when profusely gay</L>
<L>Our well-drest Rivals grace'd their Sov'raign's Day,</L>
<L>We stubborn Damsels met the publick View</L>
<L>In loathsome Wormwood, and repenting Rue?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
What Whig but trembled, when our spotless Band</L>
<L>In Virgin Roses whiten'd half the Land!</L>
<L>Who can forget what Fears the Foe possest,</L>
<L>When Oaken Boughs mark'd ev'ry loyal Breast!</L>
<L>Less scar'd near <HI>Medway</HI>'s Stream the <HI>Norman</HI> stood,</L>
<L>When cross the Plain he spy'd a marching Wood,</L>
<L>'Till, near at hand, a Gleam of Swords betray'd</L>
<L>The Youth of <HI>Kent</HI> beneath it's wandring Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those, who the Succours of the Fair despise,</L>
<L>May find that we have Nails as well as Eyes.</L>
<L>Thy Female Bands, O Prince by Fortune crost,</L>
<L>At least more Courage than thy Men may boast:</L>
<L>Our Sex has dar'd the Mugg-House Chiefs to meet,</L>
<L>And purchas'd Fame in many a well-fought Street.</L>
<L>From <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> the Region of Renown,</L>
<L>The Land of Love, the <HI>Paphos</HI> of the Town,</L>
<L>Fair Patriots sallying oft have put to flight</L>
<L>With all their Poles the Guardians of the Night,</L>
<L>And bore, with Screams of Triumph, to their Side</L>
<L>The Leader's Staff in all its painted Pride.</L>
<L>Nor fears the Hawker in her warbling Note</L>
<L>To vend the discontented Statesman's Thought.</L>
<L>Tho' red with Stripes, and recent from the Thong,</L>
<L>Sore smitten for the Love of sacred Song,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
The tuneful Sisters still pursue their Trade,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Philomela</HI> darkling in the Shade.</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Trott</HI> attends, forgetful of a Fare,</L>
<L>And Hums in Concert o'er his Empty Chair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while, regardless of the Royal Cause,</L>
<L>His Sword for <HI>James</HI> no Brother Sov'rain draws.</L>
<L>The Pope himself, surrounded with Alarms,</L>
<L>To <HI>France</HI> his Bulls, to <HI>Corfu</HI> sends his Arms,</L>
<L>And though He hears his Darling Son's Complaint,</L>
<L>Can hardly spare one Tutelary Saint,</L>
<L>But lists them all to guard his own Abodes,</L>
<L>And into Ready Money coyns his Gods.</L>
<L>The dauntless <HI>Suede,</HI> pursu'd by vengeful Foes,</L>
<L>Scarce keeps his own hereditary Snows;</L>
<L>Nor must the friendly Roof of kind <HI>Lorrain</HI></L>
<L>With Feasts regale our Garter'd Youth again:</L>
<L>Safe, <HI>Bar-le-duc,</HI> within thy silent Grove</L>
<L>The Pheasant now may perch, the Hare may rove:</L>
<L>The Knight, who aims unerring from afar,</L>
<L>Th' Advent'rous Knight, now quits the Sylvan War:</L>
<L>Thy brinded Boars may slumber un-dismay'd,</L>
<L>Or grunt secure beneath the Chesnut Shade.</L>
<L>Inconstant <HI>Orleans</HI> (still we mourn the Day</L>
<L>That trusted <HI>Orleans</HI> with Imperial Sway)</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Far o'er the <HI>Alps</HI> our helpless Monarch sends,</L>
<L>Far from the Call of his desponding Friends.</L>
<L>Such are the Terms to gain <HI>Britainnia</HI>'s Grace!</L>
<L>And such the Terrours of the <HI>Brunswick</HI> Race!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was it for this the Sun's whole Lustre fail'd,</L>
<L>And sudden Midnight o'er the Noon prevail'd!</L>
<L>For this did Heav'n display to Mortal Eyes</L>
<L>Aërial Knights and Combates in the Skies!</L>
<L>Was it for this <HI>Northumbrian</HI> Streams look'd Red!</L>
<L>And <HI>Thames</HI> driv'n backward show'd his Secret Bed!</L>
<L>False Auguries! th' insulting Victor's Scorn!</L>
<L>Ev'n our own Prodigies against us turn!</L>
<L>O Portents constru'd on our Side in vain!</L>
<L>Let never Tory trust Eclipse again!</L>
<L>Run clear, ye Fountains! be at Peace, ye Skies!</L>
<L>And, <HI>Thames,</HI> henceforth to thy green Borders rise▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Rome</HI> then must the Royal Wand'rer go,</L>
<L>And fall a Suppliant at the Papal Toe?</L>
<L>His Life in Sloth inglorious must he wear,</L>
<L>One half in Luxury, and one in Pray'r?</L>
<L>His Mind perhaps at length debauch'd with Ease</L>
<L>The proffer'd Purple and the Hat may please.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Shall He, whose Ancient Patriarchal Race</L>
<L>To mighty <HI>Nimrod</HI> in One Line we trace▪</L>
<L>In solemn Conclave sit, devoid of Thought,</L>
<L>And poll for Points of Faith his Trusty Vote!</L>
<L>Be summon'd to his Stall in time of Need,</L>
<L>And with his casting Suffrage fix a Creed!</L>
<L>Shall He in Robes on stated Days appear,</L>
<L>And <HI>English</HI> Hereticks curse once a Year!</L>
<L><HI>Garnet</HI> and <HI>Faux</HI> shall He with Pray'rs invoke,</L>
<L>And beg that <HI>Smithfield</HI> Piles once more may smoak!</L>
<L>Forbid it Heav'n! my Soul, to Fury wrought,</L>
<L>Turns almost <HI>Hanoverian</HI> at the Thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> I feel my Heart decline,</L>
<L>And fear, O <HI>Brunswick,</HI> 'twill be wholly Thine;</L>
<L>Yet still his Share thy Rival will contest,</L>
<L>And still the Double Claim divides my Breast.</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>James</HI> with pitying Eyes I view,</L>
<L>And wish my Homage were not <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Due:</L>
<L>To <HI>James</HI> my Passions and my Weakness guide,</L>
<L>But Reason sways me to the Victor's Side.</L>
<L>Though griev'd I speak it, let the Truth appear;</L>
<L>(You know my Language, and my Heart, sincere.)</L>
<L>In vain did Falshood his fair Fame disgrace;</L>
<L>What force had Falshood, when He show'd his Face!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
In vain to War our boastful Clans were led;</L>
<L>Heaps driv'n on Heaps, in the dire Shock they fled:</L>
<L><HI>France</HI> shuns his Wrath, nor raises to our Shame</L>
<L>A second <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in Another Name:</L>
<L>In <HI>Britain</HI>'s Funds their Wealth all <HI>Europe</HI> throws,</L>
<L>And up the <HI>Thames</HI> the World's Abundance flows:</L>
<L>Spite of feign'd Fears, and artificial Cries,</L>
<L>The Pious Town sees Fifty Churches rise:</L>
<L>The Hero triumphs as his Worth is known,</L>
<L>And sits more firmly on his Shaken Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To my sad Thought no Beam of Hope appears</L>
<L>Through the long Prospect of succeeding Years.</L>
<L>The Son, aspiring to his Father's Fame,</L>
<L>Shows all his Sire: Another and the Same.</L>
<L>He, blest in lovely <HI>Carolina</HI>'s Arms,</L>
<L>To future Ages propagates Her Charms:</L>
<L>With Pain and Joy at strife, I often trace</L>
<L>The mingled Parents in each Daughter's Face,</L>
<L>Half sick'ning at the Sight, too well I spie</L>
<L>The Father's Spirit through the Mother's Eye:</L>
<L>In vain new Thoughts of Rage I entertain,</L>
<L>And strive to Hate their Innocence in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Princess! happy by thy Foes confest!</L>
<L>Blest in thy Husband! in thy Children blest!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
As They from Thee, from Them New Beauties born,</L>
<L>While <HI>Europe</HI> lasts, shall <HI>Europe</HI>'s Thrones adorn.</L>
<L>Transplanted to each Court, in times to come,</L>
<L>Thy Smile Celestial and un-fading Bloom</L>
<L>Great <HI>Austria</HI>'s Sons with softer Lines shall grace,</L>
<L>And smooth the Frowns of <HI>Bourbon</HI>'s haughty Race.</L>
<L>The fair Descendents of thy sacred Bed</L>
<L>Wide-branching o'er the Western World shall spread,</L>
<L>Like the fam'd <HI>Banian</HI> Tree, whose pliant Shoot</L>
<L>To Earthward bending of it's self takes Root,</L>
<L>Till, like their Mother Plant, ten thousand stand</L>
<L>In verdant Arches on the fertile Land;</L>
<L>Beneath her Shade the tawny <HI>Indian</HI> roves,</L>
<L>Or hunts at large through the wide echoing Groves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Thou, to whom these mournful Lines I send,</L>
<L>My promis'd Husband, and my dearest Friend;</L>
<L>Since Heav'n appoints this favour'd Race to reign,</L>
<L>And Blood has drench'd the <HI>Scottish</HI> Fields in vain;</L>
<L>Must I be wretched, and thy Flight partake?</L>
<L>Or wilt not Thou, for thy lov'd <HI>Chloe</HI>'s sake,</L>
<L>Tir'd out at length, submit to Fate's Decree?</L>
<L>If not to <HI>Brunswick,</HI> O return to me!</L>
<L>Prostrate before the Victor's Mercy bend:</L>
<L>What spares whole Thousands, may to Thee extend.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Should blinded Friends thy doubtful Conduct blame,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Brunswick</HI>'s Virtues will secure thy Fame:</L>
<L>Say, these invite thee to approach his Throne,</L>
<L>And own the Monarch, Heav'n vouchsafes to own.</L>
<L>The World, convinc'd, thy Reasons will approve,</L>
<L>Say this to Them; but swear to Me 'twas Love.</L>
