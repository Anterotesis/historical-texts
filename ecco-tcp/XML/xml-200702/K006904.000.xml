<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Occasion of the Law-Suit.</HEAD>
<P>I Need not tell you of the great Quarrels that have
happen'd in our Neighbourhood, since the Death
of the late Lord <HI>Strutt;</HI> how the Parson and a
cunning Attorney got him to settle his Estate upon
his Cousin <HI>Philip Baboon,</HI> to the great disappoint∣ment
of his Cousin Esquire <HI>South.</HI> Some stick not to say,
that the Parson and the Attorney forg'd a Will, for
which they were well Paid by the Family of the <HI>Ba∣boons:</HI>
Let that be as it will, it is matter of Fact, that
the Honour and Estate have continued ever since in the
Person of <HI>Philip Baboon.</HI></P>
<P>You know that the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI> have for many Years
been possess'd of a very great Landed Estate, well con∣dition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
wooded, water<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, with Coal, Salt, Tin, Cop∣per,
Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all within themselves; that it has been
the Misfortune of that Family, to be the Property of
their Stewards, Tradesmen, and inferior Servants, which
has brought great Incumbrances upon them; at the
same time not abating of their expensive way of Living,
has forc'd them to Mortgage their best Manors: It is
credibly reported, that the Butchers and Bakers Bills
of a Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> that lived Two hundred Years ago▪
are not yet paid.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip Baboon</HI> came first to the Possession of the
Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Estate, his Tradesmen as is usual upon
such Occasions, waited upon him to wish him Joy, and
bespeak his Custom: The two chief were <HI>John Bull</HI> the
Clothier, and <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> the Linnen-draper; they told
him, that the <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Frogs</HI> had serv'd the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI>
with Drapery Ware for many Years; that they were
honest and fair Dealers; that their Bills had never been
question'd; that the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI> lived generously, and
never us'd to dirty their Fingers with Pen, Ink, and
Counters; that his Lordship might depend upon their
Honesty, that they would use him as kindly as they had

<P>Some of <HI>Bull</HI>'s Friends advised him to take gentler

rough play. It is impossible to express the Surprize of

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The true Characters of John Bull, Nic. Frog, and Hocus.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better understanding the following History,
the Reader ought to know, That <HI>Bull,</HI> in the
main, was an honest plain-dealing Fellow, Chole∣rick,
Bold, and of a very unconstant Temper; he dreaded
not Old <HI>Lewis</HI> either at Back-Sword, single Fauchion,
or Cudgel-play; but then he was very apt to quarrel
with his best Friends, especially if they pretended to
govern him: If you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter'd him▪ you might lead him
like a Child. <HI>John</HI>'s Temper depended very much up∣on
<PB REF="7"/>
the Air; his Spirits rose and fell with the Weather-glass.
<HI>John</HI> was quick, and understood his Business very well, but
no Man alive was more careless, in looking into his Ac∣counts,
or more cheated by Partners, Apprentices, and
Servants: This was occasioned by his being a Boon-Com∣panion,
loving his Bottle and his Diversion; for to say
Truth, no Man kept a better House than <HI>John,</HI> nor spent
his Money more generously. By plain and fair dealing,
<HI>John</HI> had acquir'd some Plumbs, and might have kept them,
had it not been for his unhappy Law-Suit.</P>
<P><HI>Nic. Frog</HI> was a cunning fly Whore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, quite the reverse
of <HI>John</HI> in many Particulars; Covetous, Frugal; minded
domestick Affairs; would pine his Belly to save his Pocket,
never lost a Farthing by careless Servants, or bad Debtors:
He did not care much for any sort of Diversions, except
Tricks of <HI>High-German</HI> Artists, and <HI>Leger de main;</HI> no
Man exceeded <HI>Nic.</HI> in these, yet it must be own'd, That
<HI>Nic.</HI> was a fair Dealer, and in that way had acquir'd im∣mense
Riches.</P>
<P><HI>Hocus</HI> was an old cunning Attorney, what he wanted of
Ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in Law, was made up by a Clerk which he kept, that
was the prettiest Fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow in the World; he lov'd Money,
was smooth Tongu'd, gave good Words, and seldom lost his
Temper: He was not worse than an Infidel; for he pro∣vided
plentifu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly for his Family, but he lov'd himself better
than them all: He had a termagant Wise, and, as the

<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the various Success of the Law-Suit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LAW is a Bottomless Pit, it is a Cormorant, a Harpy that
devours every thing; John Bull</HI> was flatter'd by his
Lawyers that his Suit would not last above a Year
or two at most; that before that time he would be in
quiet Possession of his Business; yet ten long Years did
<HI>Hocus</HI> steer his Cause through all the <HI>Meanders</HI> of the
Law, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the Courts; no Skill, no Address, was wan∣ting;
and to say Truth, <HI>John</HI> did not starve the Cause:
there wanted not <HI>Tellow Boys</HI> to see Counsel, hire Wit∣nesses,
and bribe Juries. Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> was generally Cast,
<PB REF="8"/>
never had one Verdict in his favour; and <HI>John</HI> was pro∣mis'd.
That the next would be the final Determination;
but alas! that final Determination, and happy Conclusion
was like an inchanted Island, the nearer <HI>John</HI> came to it,
the further it went from him: New Tryals upon new
Points still arose; new Doubts, new Matters to be cleared
in short. Lawyers seldom part with so good a Cause ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they have got the Oyster, and their Clients the Shell, <HI>John</HI>
Money, Book Debts, Bonds, Mortgages, all went into the
Lawyers Pockets; then <HI>John</HI> began to borrow Money up
in <HI>Bank-Stock, East-India</HI> Bonds, and now and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Farm went to Pot: At last it was thought a good Ex∣pedient
to set up Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s Title to prove the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Forg'd, and dispossess <HI>Philip</HI> Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> at once; here a
gain was a new Field for the <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and the Caul
grew more intricate than ever. <HI>John</HI> grew madder and
madder: Wherever he met any of Lord <HI>Strutt's</HI> Ser∣vants
he tore off their Cloaths: Now and then you
would see them come home naked, without Shoes
Stockings and Linnen. As for Old <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> he was
reduc'd to his last Shift, tho' he had as many as any o∣ther:
His Children were reduced from rich Silks to <HI>Doi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

<P>IT is wisely observed by a great Philosopher, That Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<HI>John Bull,</HI> who from an honest and plain Trades∣man,
had got such a haunt about the Courts of Justice
and such a Jargon of Law-words, that he concluded
himself as able a Lawyer, as any that pleaded at the Bar,
or sat on the Bench: He was overheard one day, talking
to himself after this manner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">How capriciously does Fate
or Chance dispose of Mankind? How seldom is that

born, and a Lawyer I will be; one is never too Old
to learn▪</Q> All this while <HI>John</HI> had con'd over such a
Catalogue of hard words, as were enough to conjure up
the Devil; these he used to bubble indifferently in all
Companies, especially at Coffee-houses; so that his
Neighbour Tradesmen began to shun his Company as a
Man that was crack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Instead of the Affairs of <HI>Black∣well-Hall,</HI>

enough by it to reimburse him of all his Charges; That if
he study'd, he would undoubtedly arrive to the Dignity
of a Lord Chief Justice: as for the Advice of honest
Friends and Neighbours, <HI>John</HI> despis'd it; he look'd up∣on
them as Fellows of a low Genius, poor grovelling
Mechanicks; <HI>John</HI> reckon'd it more Honour to have

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. How John discover'd that Hocus had an Intrigue with his
Wife, and what follow'd thereupon.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOhn</HI> had not run on a madding so long had it not
been for an extravagant Bitch of a Wife, whom <HI>Hocus</HI>
perceiving <HI>John</HI> to be fond of, resolv'd to win over
to his side. It is a true saying, <HI>That the last Man of the
Parish that knows of his Cuckoldom, is himself.</HI> It 'twas
observed by all the Neighbourhood, that <HI>Hocus</HI> had
Dealings with <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> that were not so much for
<PB REF="10"/>
his Honour; but this was perceiv'd by <HI>John</HI> a little too
late: She was a luxurious Jade, lov'd splendid Equipages,
Plays, Treats, and Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, differing very much from the
sober Manners of her Ancestors, and by no means fit
for a Tradesman's Wife. <HI>Hocus</HI> fed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Extravagancy
(what was still more shameful) with <HI>John's</HI> own Money.
Every body said that <HI>Hocus</HI> had a Months mind to her
Body; be that as it will, it is matter of Fact, <HI>that</HI> up∣on
all occasions she run out extravagantly on the Praise
of <HI>Hocus.</HI> When <HI>John</HI> us'd to be finding fault with
his Bills, she us'd to reproach him as ungrateful to his great∣est
Benefactor; One that had taken so much pains in
his Law-Suit, and retriev'd his Family from the Oppres∣sion
of old <HI>Lewis Baboon.</HI> A <HI>good swinging Sum of John's</HI>
readiest Cash, went towards building of <HI>Hocus</HI>'s Country
House. This Affair between <HI>Hocus</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was now
so open, that all the World were scandaliz'd at it;
<HI>John was not so Clod-pated,</HI> but at <HI>last</HI> he took the Hint.
The Parson of the Parish Preaching one Day a little sharp∣ly
against Adultery, Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> told her Husband▪ That he
was a very uncivil Fellow to use such course Language
before People o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condition, That <HI>Hocus</HI> was of the same
mind, and that they would joyn to have him turn'd out
of his Living for using personal Reflections. How do
you mean, says <HI>John,</HI> by personal Reflections? I hope
in God, Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he did not reflect upon you. No, thank
God, my Reputation is too well established in the World
to receive any hurt from such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul Mouth'd Scoun∣dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
as he; his Doctrine tends only to make Husbands
Tyrants, and Wive Slaves; must we be shut up, and
Husbands left to their Liberty? Very pretty indeed; a
Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must never go abroad with a Platonick to see a
Play or a Ball, she must never stir without her Hus∣band;
nor walk in Spring Garden with a Cousin. I
do say, Husband, and I will stand by it, That without
the innocent Freedoms of Life, Matrimony would be a
most intollerable State; And that a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e's Virtue,
ought to be the result of her own reason, and not
of her Husband<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Government; for my part, I would
scorn a Husband that would be Jealous, if he saw
a Fellow in Bed with me. All this while <HI>John</HI>'s
Blood boyl'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Veins, he was now confirm'd
<PB REF="11"/>
in all his Suspicions; Jade, Bitch and Whore were
the best Words that <HI>John</HI> gave her. Things went from
better to worse, 'till Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> aim'd a Knife at <HI>John,</HI> tho'
<HI>John</HI> threw a Bottle at her Head very brutally indeed:
After this there was nothing but Confusion; Bottles,
Glasses, Spoons, Plates, Knives, Forks, and Dishes flew
about like Dust, res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt of which was, That Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>
receiv'd a bruise in her Right side, of which she dy'd
half a Year after: The Bruise imposthumated, and
afterwards turn'd to a stinking Ulcer, which made every
body shie to come near her she melt so; yet she wanted
not the help of many able Physicians, who attended very
diligently, and did what Men of skill could do, but all
to no purpose, for her Condition was now quite despe∣rate,
all regular Physicians and her nearest Relations
having giv'n her over.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How Signior Cavallo, an Italian Quack, undertook to Cure
Mrs. Bull of her Ulcer.</HEAD>
<P>THere is nothing so impossible in Nature, but Mon∣tebanks
will undertake; nothing so incredible,
but they will affirm: Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s Condition was
look'd upon as desperate by all the Men of Art; then
Signior <HI>Cavallo</HI> judged it was high time for him to inter∣pose,
he bragged that he had an infallible Ointment and
Plaister, which being applied to the Sore would Cure
it in a few Days; at the same time he would give her
a Pill that would purge off all her bad Humours, sweeten
her Blood, and rectifie her disturb'd Imagination: In
spite of all Signior <HI>Cavallo</HI>'s Applications the Patient
grew worse every Day, she stank so no body durst come
within a Stone's throw of her, except Signior <HI>Cavallo</HI>
and his Wife▪ whom he sent every Day to Dress her, she
having a very gentle soft Hand. All this while Signior
apprehended no Danger. If one ask'd him how Mrs.
<HI>Bull</HI> did, better and better, says Signior <HI>Cavallo;</HI> the
Parts heal, and her Constitution mends, if she submits
to my Government▪ she will be abroad in a little time.
Nay, it is reported, that he wrote to her Friends in the
Country, that she should Dance a Jig next <HI>October</HI> in
<HI>Westmister</HI>-Hall; that her Illness had been chiefly owing
to bad Physicians. At last Signior one Day was sent
<PB REF="12"/>
for in great haste, his Patient growing worse and worse;
when he came he affirmed, that it was a gross Mistake,
that she never was in a fairer Way: Bring hither the
Salve, says he; and give her a plentiful Draught of my
Cordial. As he was applying his Ointments, and admi∣nistring
the Cordial▪ the Patient gave up the Ghost, to
the great Confusion of Signior <HI>Cavalio,</HI> and the great Joy
of <HI>Bull</HI> and his Friends. Signior slung away out of the
House in great disorder, and swore there was foul Play,
for he was sure his Medicines were infallible. Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>
having dy'd without any Signs of Repentance or Devo∣tion,
the Clergy would hardly allow her Christian Bu∣rial.
The Relations had once resolved to sue <HI>John</HI> for
the Murder, but considering better of it, and that such
a Trial would rip up old Sores, and discover things not
so much to the Reputation of the Deceased, they dropt
their Design. She left no Will, only there was found
in her strong Box the following Words wrote on a scrip
of Paper, <HI>My Curse on</HI> John Bull <HI>and all my Posterity, if
ever they come to any Composition with my Lord</HI> Strutt.
There were many Epitaphs writ upon her, one was as
follows;

<P><HI>JOHN</HI> quickly got the better of his Grief, and seeing
that neither his Constitution, nor the Affairs of his
Family could permit him to live in an unmarried State

the reverse of the other in her Temper, not but
that she lov'd Money, for she was of a saving Temper,
