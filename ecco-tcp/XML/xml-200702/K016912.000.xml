<P>Mr. BURKE's SPEECH, IN WESTMINSTER-HALL, On the 18th and 19th of February, 1788, WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES.</P>
<P>THIS SPEECH CONTAINS WHAT MR. BURKE, IN HIS LETTER TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY, CALLS
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THOSE STRONG FACTS WHICH THE MANA∣GERS FOR THE COMMONS HAVE OPENED AS OFFENCES, AND WHICH GO SERIOUSLY TO AFFECT MR. SHORE'S ADMINISTRATION, AS ACTING CHIEF OF THE RE∣VENUE BOARD."</Q></P>
<P>WITH A PREFACE, CONTAINING MR. BURKE'S LETTER TO THE CHAIRMAN, ON SIR JOHN SHORE'S APPOINTMENT TO THE GOVERN∣MENT OF BENGAL, AND REMARKS UPON THAT LETTER.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the recess of Parliament, when Mr. Burke has no authority to interfere in his senatorial character, in the concerns of any public body in the kingdom; he has addressed a letter to the Chairman of the East India Company, to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"That he has heard, and that the report is generally credited, that Mr. Shore is in nomination, or actually appointed, to the office of Governor General of Bengal.—<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
That, having been appointed by the House of Commons, a Member of the Com∣mittee, to impeach one of their late Go∣vernors General, he thinks it his duty to inform the Chairman, that in the ex∣ercise of the functions imposed on that Committee by the House, they had found Mr. Shore to be materially con∣cerned <HI>as a principal actor and party in certain of the offences charged upon Mr. Hastings</HI>; namely, in the mal-adminis∣tration of the Revenue Board; of which, under Mr. Hastings, he was for some con∣siderable time the acting Chief.</P>
<P>"That he thinks it incumbent upon him also to inform the Chairman, that some of the matters charged as misdemeanors, <HI>in which it appears that Mr. Shore was concerned,</HI> are actually in evidence before the Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
"That other facts of a very strong nature, which the Managers for the Commons <HI>have opened as offences,</HI> are upon the Com∣pany's records; copies of which are in the possession of the Managers, and, that they go <HI>seriously to affect Mr. Shore's ad∣ministration, as acting Chief of the Revenue Board.</HI></P>
<P>"That, the Committee of Managers can∣not consistently with their duty, in making good the charge confided to them by the House of Commons, avoid a proceeding on those matters, or taking such steps, both for supporting the evidence already before the Peers, as well as putting the other, and not less important matters, into such a course of proceeding, as the ends of justice and the public policy may require. That the Managers have not in any instance deviated from their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
"That, in this situation, it is for the Court of Directors to consider the con∣sequences, <HI>which possibly may follow,</HI> from sending out in offices of the highest rank, and of the highest possible power, <HI>persons whose conduct appearing on their own records, is, at the first view of it, very reprehensible; and against whom such criminal matter, on such grounds, in a manner so solemn, and by men acting under such an authority as that of the House of Commons, is partly at issue, and the rest opened and offered before the highest Tribunal in the nation.</HI>"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Burke, in the first paragraph of his letter appears to be ignorant of what every man knew, who looked into a newspaper, a month ago.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September the intended appointment of Sir John Shore was announced. On the 25th he was unanimously appointed.
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
On the 2d of October his Majesty was pleased to create him a Baronet of Great Britain; so that he came under that descrip∣tion of persons, whom, to use Mr. Burke's words, <Q REND="inline">"The King delighteth to honour"</Q> and we should have imagined, that so loyal a subject as Mr. Burke, would have delighted to know the King's pleasure. On the 3d of October Sir John Shore kissed hands on his creation, and on his appointment; and dined on that day with the Court of Direc∣tors, and the King's Ministers. On the 11th of October he was at the Queen's Drawing-Room. On the 12th he left London. On the 14th, the day Mr. Burke's letter is dated, he was at Bath, and quitted it, to proceed to to Falmouth, on the 17th.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Burke is so much in the woods, that he heard not one single word of these several circumstances, though he does say, that the account is generally credited, of his being in nomination, <HI>or actually appointed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7"/>If he believed the last repeat, he very well <HI>knew,</HI> that, whether the <HI>first idea</HI> of Sir John Shore's appointment originated in Leaden∣hall-street, in Mr. Dundas's apartments, at Somerset House, or at Mr. Pitt's seat at Holwood; it could <HI>only</HI> be <HI>made</HI> with the <HI>full, complete, and entire approbation of the King and his Ministers.</HI> The public must look to Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas for the propriety of Sir John Shore's appointment. Mr. Burke's letter is therefore a direct attack upon those ministers; whom he has ventured to threaten with the future vengeance of Parliament, for preferring a man whose con∣duct <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>he alone,</HI> has represented as, at the first view of it, <HI>very reprehensible.</HI></P>
<P>We are confident that so strong an in∣stance of presumption, in an individual, is not to be met with. Mr. Burke has no right at this moment to use the name or authority of the House of Commons, for
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
any purpose whatever; still less, for that of intimidation. Either his letter was intended to stop Sir John Shore's appointment, to annul it, if it had taken place—or it was an unmeaning rhapsody. But, Mr. Burke does not know that the House will <HI>re-appoint</HI> him a Manager. It is even possible, that the House may say,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We will not be the tools and instruments of corrupt, revenge∣ful, or factious men, of any party or description. Above £60,000 has, by this time, been expended in a disgraceful persecution of an indivual. We voted to <HI>continue</HI> the impeachment of Mr. Hastings, not from any knowledge <HI>we</HI> had of the charges preferred against him, for <HI>we</HI> never looked into a <HI>single</HI> allegation; but, because <HI>we</HI> thought a dissolution did not of necessity abate an impeachment; and, because we had so much confidence in <HI>the sense</HI> and <HI>justice of the last House,</HI> as to believe that they did not place an implicit
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
credit in the assertions of any man; but that they had <HI>sober and rational grounds</HI> for be∣lieving that Mr. Burke <HI>spoke truth,</HI> when he told them, that Sir John Shore was <HI>a creature of Mr. Hastings</HI>; that, kingdoms which Mr. Hastings found flourishing, he left <HI>desolate</HI>; that a <HI>whole people happy</HI> at his accession, he made miserable for thirteen years; and that the <HI>public re∣venues</HI> which were <HI>productive</HI> on his ar∣rival, declined <HI>rapidly</HI> under his admins∣tration. But, to our <HI>astonishment,</HI> the King's Ministers have promoted to the high office of Governor of Bengal, the very man whom Mr. Burke has <HI>called the creature of Mr. Hastings</HI>; and whom Mr. Burke so strongly censured in Westminster-Hall. We find that this gentleman, so selected, has solemnly deposed before the Peers, that Bengal had greatly <HI>improved</HI> in <HI>population</HI> and <HI>agriculture</HI> during the go∣vernment of Mr. Hastings; that under
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>
him <HI>property</HI> was better protected, and the natives happier, than under their own So∣vereigns, and that of Mr. Hastings the Natives <HI>had a very favourable opinion.</HI> Have the King's Ministers selected a man for so high an office, who is capable of laying <HI>perjury on his soul to serve Mr. Hastings?</HI> and if not, if Sir John Shore is to be <HI>believed upon his oath,</HI> we disgrace our∣selves, and our Constituents, by suffering such execrable falsehoods to continue to stain the journals of the last Parliament. Nor is this all: the King's India Minister has annually presented accounts of the state of Bengal to this House. We have ourselves seen by those accounts the pro∣gressive improvement of the revenues of Bengal during his government, and since his departure; and they <HI>prove,</HI> supposing the accounts to be <HI>correct,</HI> that Sir John Shore has sworn the truth. Whatever motives the King's India Ministers may
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
have for acting so <HI>inconsistently,</HI> we ought to be actuated by a love of justice alone. As Representatives of the peo∣ple, it would be disgraceful to us, to vote away their money annually, and to oppress, in a manner unexampled in any age or nation, a meritorious individual, because infamy must rest somewhere, if any part of this prosecution has been wantonly, maliciously, or carelessly un∣dertaken. But the infamy will fall upon our heads, if after such clear and decisive proofs, that Bengal was <HI>not</HI> in the situation described by Mr. Burke, we still permit him to say, in the name of the Commons of Great Britain, that the country has been desolated, its inhabitants plundered and destroyed, and its revenues diminished by Mr. Hastings."</Q></P>
<P>We think it much more natural for the House to declare these manly sentiments, be∣cause
<PB N="xi" REF="12"/>
they are the sentiments <HI>universally prevalent amongst their constituents,</HI> than to find them ready to second Mr. Burke's attack of Sir John Shore, or to vote alter∣nately with Mr. Dundas, that white is black, and black is white.</P>
<P>But can Mr. Burke in this instance depend upon Mr. Pitt? and was it an article in that curious treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We state this fact of the treaty, on the authority of a pamphlet which is in every body's hands. We have no doubt of the truth of it, because Mr. Burke declared in the House, that Mr. Pitt <HI>had neutralized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI> him by his conduct <HI>on the impeachment of Mr. Hastings.</HI></NOTE>, which so completely <HI>neutra∣lized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI> Mr. Burke, that for two years he has ceased to abuse Mr. Pitt in the gross terms which he formerly applied to him: was it, we ask, an article of the treaty, that the national purse, the national honour, the honour of the King, and even of Mr. Pitt himself, should be ceded <HI>for ever</HI> to Mr. Burke? Though Mr. Pitt may have listen∣ed
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
with calm tranquillity, or with secret satis∣faction to Mr. Burke, while he spent his rage upon his old connections, or upon Mr. Hastings, yet he will hardly be pleased with so very direct an attack upon himself.</P>
<P>It was a duty <HI>imposed by the law</HI> upon Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, to examine with the closest attention every transaction of Sir John Shore's public life, before they <HI>acquiesced</HI> in his appointment. We are <HI>confident</HI> that in this instance they performed their duty; and we believe that <HI>they,</HI> and not the Direc∣tors, were induced to <HI>solicit</HI> Sir John Shore to accept the office, because he appeared to them to have acted with the strictest in∣tegrity and honour, and for the national interests, in all those transactions, which, Mr. Burke presumes to say, appeared, on the first view, <HI>very reprehensible.</HI></P>
<P>We are indeed well aware that Mr. Burke has brought Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas into
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
an unfortunate dilemma. Sir John Shore's appointment <HI>does throw some little disgrace</HI> upon <HI>that impeachment</HI> for which those Mi∣nisters <HI>voted</HI>; but, in justice to all parties, we will state <HI>how far they were concerned.</HI></P>
<P>The whole of that immense mass of mat∣ter, which was called "Revenues," was opened by Mr. Francis, in a Committee of the whole House, on the 19th of April 1787. The charge, in substance, was, that between 1772, and 1785, Mr. Hastings had violated private property, had oppressed most griev∣ously persons of all ages, ranks, and de∣scriptions, had annihilated the nobility and country gentlemen of a great empire, and had materially injured the public revenues, by his various and oppressive modes of col∣lecting them.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt most eloquently and strenuously opposed every allegation in the charge. He
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
declared that Mr. Francis's description of Bengal was utterly <HI>unfounded,</HI> that country being in a most <HI>flourishing</HI> and <HI>prosperous state,</HI> and that his statement of a <HI>declining revenue</HI> was <HI>disproved, by the evidence of figures.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Fox, with much vehemence, supported Mr. Francis, and expressed his concern that Mr. Pitt, <HI>who had lately been in the habit of agreeing with them,</HI> should differ upon this, <HI>the most important of all their charges</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Fox undoubtedly was right, that this was the <HI>most important of all the articles.</HI> It was so stated by Mr. Burke originally, who declared, that if Mr. Hastings <HI>had</HI> improved the face of a country, had made a numerous people happy, had extended commerce, and encreased population, and the Public income; <HI>he</HI> never would have conceived the idea of entering into a <HI>minute scrutiny</HI> of the conduct of such a man. If this were not mere <HI>verbiage,</HI> what can Mr. Burke say, after having heard the evidence of Sir John Shore?</NOTE>. He was supported warmly by Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>Upon the division, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Gren∣ville, Mr. Dundas, and Lord Mulgrave, the
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
four India Ministers, with their Secretary, Mr. Rouse, the Speaker of the House of Com∣mons, and the Law Officers of the Crown, were in a minority. Fifty-five voted with Mr. Pitt, seventy-one with Mr. Francis, who consequently carried his question by a ma∣jority of fifteen.</P>
<P>To those who do not know what was the <HI>routine</HI> of business, in the <HI>last Parliament,</HI> it may be necessary to explain <HI>how</HI> such a cir∣cumstance occurred.</P>
<P>It was the custom of the Treasury to send notes to their friends, to request attendance, when the Minister was anxious to succeed in a question, and the Opposition had some active partizan who took the same means <HI>to collect their forces.</HI> Mr. Francis being a man of some consequence, on their side, the party were summoned, <HI>and they came in a body to his support.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>Whether Mr. Pitt from delicacy did not issue his Treasury notes, as it was a judicial question, or whether he was determined that his influence should never be exercised <HI>for Mr. Hastings,</HI> though he took ample pains, on many occasions, to exercise it <HI>against him,</HI> the fact is, that from a thin attendance of Mr. Pitt's friends, he was left in a mi∣nority.</P>
<P>But there were <HI>other stages</HI> in the course of this article when Mr. Pitt might have thrown it out, had he pleased; for it was not pre∣sented to the House in its <HI>present form,</HI> until the 10th of May, and the Tuesday fol∣lowing was appointed for taking it into con∣sideration. At this time, Mr. Dundas had opened his first India Budget, and, to a man of <HI>reason,</HI> it was perfectly clear, that unless Mr. Dundas <HI>imposed false accounts upon the House,</HI> the Revenue Article was a gross libel on the Government of Bengal.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>A Member, who believed Mr. Dundas told truth, and that the article was filled with false assertions, took the liberty to speak to Mr. Pitt on the 10th of May, upon this subject, and also to Mr. Rouse. He remind∣ed Mr. Pitt, that he had voted against the Revenue article <HI>in toto.</HI> He pointed out how glaringly it falsified all Mr. Dundas's asser∣tions, and all his accounts, and he asked Mr. Pitt if he did not intend to oppose it on the Tuesday, and to endeavour to throw it out altogether. Mr. Pitt told that Member, in reply, that he should give no further op∣position to the article, but he did not con∣descend to explain <HI>his reasons</HI> for being silent; so that, <HI>in point of fact,</HI> Mr. Pitt <HI>actually voted</HI> in direct contradiction to sentiments forcibly and eloquently delivered by him∣self: any opposition by an unconnected Member to an article which Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox supported would have been idle in the extreme.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>But if Mr. Pitt had given <HI>notice,</HI> that he would oppose the revenue article on <HI>its third reading,</HI> and if then he had pointed out how materially it cut up all that Mr. Dundas had said, we are confident that the article would have been totally rejected. We re∣member to have seen Mr. Pitt a little ruffled on being left in a minority, on a question relative to the African Carrying Trade; he told the House that he would oppose the clause which had been carried against him, <HI>on the Report</HI>; and <HI>then,</HI> an irresistible phalanx crowded down, which insured his success.</P>
<P>As the matter now stands, we allow that the last Parliament agreed with Mr. Francis, that Bengal was <HI>irretrievably ruined,</HI> and with Mr. Dundas, <HI>that it was the most flourishing country in India.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>this House</HI> is not at all responsible for the <HI>absurdity</HI> or the <HI>injustice</HI> of the last;
<PB N="xix" REF="20"/>
what has this House ever heard about Bengal, except from Mr. Dundas? and <HI>his communications</HI> have been most flattering, indeed, to Mr. Hastings; and to Sir John Shore, who acted under him.</P>
<P>Of the revenue article voted by the last Parliament, this House <HI>knows nothing,</HI> for the best of all possible reasons; because it would not condescend <HI>to inquire.</HI></P>
<P>This House voted two Resolutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first on the 19th of December 1790, the second on the 14th of February 1791.</NOTE>. The first, that the Impeachment of Mr. Hastings was <HI>depending</HI>; or, in other words, that an impeachment existing at a dissolution, was not <HI>abated</HI> by that dissolution.</P>
<P>The second Resolution was, that this House would proceed no further in the Impeachment beyond those articles <HI>on which the Managers had already closed their evi∣dence,</HI> excepting <HI>only</HI> to <HI>Contracts, Pensions,</HI>
<PB N="xx" REF="21"/>
and <HI>Allowances</HI>; and those were finished in six days, in Westminster Hall.</P>
<P>Beyond this, the present House has not gone. The articles voted by the last House may have been very well, or very ill found∣ed; very true, or very false.—They might have been considered with great care and attention, or by far the greater number may not to this moment have been read by the Members who voted for them—This House neither knew, nor cared, about them—They <HI>lent the authority of their name</HI> to <HI>all</HI> that the Managers <HI>had done in the last Parliament,</HI> of which they could know <HI>nothing,</HI> and they <HI>tied up Mr. Burke</HI> from <HI>proceeding beyond cer∣tain specified points in future.</HI></P>
<P>We conclude it was an article of the treaty with Mr. Pitt, which the latter in∣sisted upon, that Mr. Burke should not go on <HI>eternally,</HI> because he <HI>lamented</HI> in the House<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The 14th of February 1791.</NOTE>,
<PB N="xxi" REF="22"/>
that he was <HI>compelled</HI> to yield to the crimi∣nal impatience of the times, and to give up all the remaining articles, the Contracts ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, therefore, cannot stir one step without the <HI>authority of the House</HI>—No con∣sequences hostile to the Directors, or to the King's Ministers, can follow from Sir John Shore's appointment; unless he can persuade the House to <HI>rescind</HI> their last resolution. The House may undoubtedly prefer <HI>new articles,</HI> even while Mr. Hastings is upon his defence—The House <HI>may</HI> prolong the trial as long as it lives, and its successors may also continue it until a hundred more of the Judges make a journey to the other world—There is nothing <HI>substantially unjust,</HI> that the House may not do according to the strict forms of Parliamentary Impeach∣ments; but Mr. Burke has no right to pre∣sume that the House <HI>will</HI> suffer him to move an inch beyond <HI>a Reply,</HI> upon the matter
<PB N="xxii" REF="23"/>
<HI>now at issue.</HI> If there is common sense in his letter, he must move to impeach Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, for reducing to <HI>con∣tempt</HI> the impeachment of Mr. Hastings, by nominating to the office of Governor General, a man who has been <HI>a principal actor and party</HI> in the mal-administration of the revenues; but we confidently affirm, that he has not a <HI>shadow</HI> of foundation, on which to rest a charge against the King's Ministers, or the Court of Directors. The King's Ministers never would allow that the revenues had been ill administered.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke writes to the Chairman,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Managers for the Commons have opened <HI>facts of a very strong nature,</HI> which go <HI>seriously</HI> to affect Mr. Shore's admi∣nistration, and they <HI>offered</HI> evidence upon them to the Lords."</Q></P>
<P>It is true, that <HI>Mr. Burke</HI> did open such facts, as he calls them; but, in the first
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24"/>
place, he acted without authority in opening them—and secondly, the facts, or by far the greater number of them, <HI>were not true</HI>—and thirdly, Sir John Shore cannot be responsi∣ble for such facts as were true, in any possible point of view. He certainly <HI>did</HI> reflect very <HI>seriously</HI> upon the character and conduct of Sir John Shore; but in so doing <HI>he exceeded his powers,</HI> and it was neither more nor less, than the groundless calumny of an unauthorized individual.</P>
<P>To prevent, therefore, <HI>all further misre∣presentations,</HI> we now publish <HI>those facts of a very strong nature,</HI> which Mr. Burke <HI>opened,</HI> and we print them from minutes taken at the time by a short-hand writer. There may still be some errors, owing to the rapidity of Mr. Burke's utterance, but they cannot materially affect his argument: those who have read Mr. Dodsley's abstract in his Register, will find how clearly both accounts agree in all essential points.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="25"/>If Mr. Burke's doctrine were to prevail, what would be Mr. Pitt's situation!! A Manager, on an India Impeachment, has but to select all the meritorious servants of the public, and if he can, like Mr. Burke, call names with the fluency of a Marat, or a Parisian Poissarde, he may apply the epithet <HI>Creature</HI> to one man, <HI>Secret Agent</HI> to a second, <HI>Bribe Broker</HI> to a third, <HI>Murderer</HI> to a fourth, <HI>Corrupt Instrument</HI> to a fifth, <HI>Captain General of Iniquity</HI> to a sixth, <HI>Villain</HI> to a seventh, and so on, until he forces Mr. Pitt to have recourse to the Ranks of Opposition for a Governor General.</P>
<P>Many years ago Mr. Burke played the same game, though he then acted by authority.—As soon as the Rockingham Administration were in power, he drew out a Parliamentary Report<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1782.</NOTE>, in which he most violently attacked the Directors for appointing Sir John Mac∣pherson, and Mr. Stables, to the Supreme
<PB N="xxv" REF="26"/>
Council, and the Hon. Mr. Stuart, and Mr. Sulivan, to a succession, upon vacancies.</P>
<P>He imputed to Sir John Macpherson, a design to support the Nabob of Arcot, by bribing the King's Ministers, and Parlia∣ment itself. Mr. Stables was an improper person, because he had not been in the Civil Service; Mr. Stuart was an accused man; and Mr. Sulivan was the son of the Chairman.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke, however, has once more thought proper to allude
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to the offences opened by the Managers,"</Q> that is, <HI>by him∣self,</HI> the story shall be told in intelligible language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Managers knew nothing of this story until Mr. Burke told it in Westminster Hall, and he himself only got the hint of it, from Mr. Francis, two days be∣fore the trial commenced.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The day after he had concluded his ac∣count <HI>of those offences,</HI> the late Lord Chan∣cellor
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27"/>
(for the trial, after surviving almost a hundred of its Judges, has now outlived the President of the Court) stated in the House of Lords,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the new matter introduced by Mr. Burke in his opening speech, was of such a nature that, compared with it, the articles, important as they were, <HI>sunk to utter insignificance</HI>; and that Mr. Burke would be a <HI>calumniator,</HI> if he did not put it into such a form as might enable Mr. Hastings to refute it; if he could not re∣fute it, then no punishment in the power of their Lordships to inflict, could be adequate to his offences."</Q></P>
<P>The Duke of Richmond took the same line; and added the epithet "base," to that of calumniator.</P>
<P>Of these speeches Mr. Burke took no notice. In the next year, 1789, Mr. Burke, in one of his rants, called Mr. Hastings "a Murderer;" Mr. Hastings complained
<PB N="xxvii" REF="28"/>
to the House of Commons next day of this scandalous outrage; he complained also, of the introduction of the story of Deby Sing in the preceding year, and he prayed the House to frame both accusations into articles, if <HI>they</HI> thought there were grounds to do so; if not, to redress the injury which he had sustained.</P>
<P>The House censured Mr. Burke for the first offence against decency and justice; but they rejected the second complaint, not because it was <HI>unfounded,</HI> but because Mr. Hastings had not complained of the injury, as soon as he received it.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke affirmed, <HI>upon this occasion,</HI> that he was <HI>determined</HI> to go into this story of Deby Sing.—The year passed over, <HI>and he did nothing.</HI></P>
<P>In the next year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 18th of May.</NOTE>, 1790, <HI>evidence</HI> was offered upon it, as he tells the Chairman; but, however, in such a manner, we will venture
<PB N="xxviii" REF="29"/>
to say, as no <HI>lawyer</HI> could have advised; for instead of going to the House of Commons, and there stating <HI>the grounds</HI> for implicating Mr. Hastings in any transactions of Deby Sing, as a foundation for an additional ar∣ticle; either Mr. Burke, or Mr. Anstruther, called for an opinion delivered by Mr. Hastings in January 1785, in which he says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he so well knows the character and abilities of Rajah Deby Sing, as easily to conceive it was in his power to commit the enormities laid to his charge, and to conceal the ground of them from the English Resident, Mr. Goodlad."</Q></P>
<P>Upon this opinion, the Managers said,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they would next proceed to shew what those enormities were, which might be concealed from the English gentlemen residing there, and which might be committed without their knowing any thing of the matter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="30"/>This miserable attempt was instantly op∣posed by the Counsel of Mr. Hastings, who at the same time pressed Mr. Burke to go to the Commons, and if he could persuade <HI>them</HI> to accuse Mr. Hastings, they would most eagerly, and gladly meet the accusa∣tion; but they would neither allow Mr. Burke to make charges of <HI>his own authority,</HI> nor permit him to adduce evidence upon charges so made.</P>
<P>The opinion of the Lords was called for, and they <HI>instantly</HI> determined,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is <HI>not</HI> competent for the Managers for the Commons to give evidence of the enor∣mities actually committed by Deby Sing, <HI>the same not being charged in the Impeach∣ment</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Printed evidence, page 1251,</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>A rational man would have supposed, that after such a decision, Mr. Burke would have done one of two things—either that which his
<PB N="xxx" REF="31"/>
<HI>character</HI> and his <HI>honour</HI> required: namely, to bring the subject <HI>fully before the last House of Commons,</HI> or to have been silent for ever. He did not adopt the first and best measure; nay, as it respects <HI>Mr. Hastings,</HI> he has totally dropped it; but as soon as his Majesty had honoured Sir John Shore by his favour, and when the King's Ministers had selected him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for an office of the highest trust, and the highest possible power,"</Q> then Mr. Burke revived this story of Deby Sing, in his letter to the Chairman, in order to make an im∣pression <HI>against Sir John Shore.</HI>
To rescue <HI>his character,</HI> therefore, from the calumnies of Mr. Burke—to rescue the character of the British nation in India, from the reproach which Mr. Burke has so unjustly cast upon it; we have printed his speech, and we have added explanatory notes, in order to prove that no one English gentleman can be re∣sponsible for the conduct of Deby Sing.</P>
<P>It has been rumoured in the vicinity of St. James's, that Mr. Burke has complained
<PB N="xxxi" REF="32"/>
of Sir John Shore's appointment to Mr. Dundas in very strong terms. To this worthy gentleman, his complaints are not impro∣perly addressed. In return for Mr. Burke's important services to Ministers, he might have expected a continuance of that cordial support which Mr. Dundas has hitherto given him, in carrying on the impeachment.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke may have addressed Mr. Dun∣das with great propriety, in the following terms: To support you in office, I have given up character, principle, and consistency. No very long period has elapsed since I affirmed, in the face of the House of Commons, and of my country,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That all the acts and monuments in the records of pecula∣tion, the consolidated corruption of ages, the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of Roman iniquity, never equalled the gigantic corruption of a single act,"</Q> conceived and executed by you and
<PB N="xxxii" REF="33"/>
Mr. Pitt.
I solemnly pledged myself to be
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a steady, earnest, and faithful assistant to any one who should bring forward any plan that might tend to a subversion of that most <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>oppressive</HI> system for the government of India<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The passages marked by inverted commas, are taken from the speeches printed by Mr. Burke himself.</NOTE>,"</Q> which you and Mr. Pitt have established under the sanc∣tion of Parliament; but so completely was I<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "<HI>neutralized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI>"</Q> by your support of the impeachment, that I have now <HI>forgot</HI> all my former speeches, though I printed them publicly, and though Mr. Dodsley has very lately sent a fresh edition of them into the world.</P>
<P>The system which I censured so loudly, is still continued in all its parts; but I have <HI>long since</HI> ceased to sound the trumpet of alarm; and you may violate Treaties, you may disgrace the honour of Great
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="34"/>
Britain; in short, you <HI>might</HI> have done <HI>any thing,</HI> provided you had given me all the money, and all the time, and all the influence I wanted to carry on the im∣peachment. But it was not enough that I ceased to be your determined and persever∣ing opponent; I have lately rendered you most essential services. I have lost no opportunity of exposing the weakness of that party, to whose interests my best days were devoted. I have used every means in my power to scatter them to atoms. I have so far <HI>succeeded,</HI> that the <HI>people</HI> now believe there is hardly one honest public man in this nation. I have supported your Proclamation. I have excited the fears of the Aristocratic Whigs, and I have made the Houses of Wentworth, Cavendish, and Bentinck, your own.</P>
<P>In return for these important services, you have disgraced me in the opinion of
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="35"/>
every man of honour in the nation. You ought to have remembered the high tone which I affected, when I originally moved the Impeachment of Mr. Hastings. I did not venture at once to accuse him of spending half a million improvidently, in thirteen years, while he added millions to the public resources—with all the ex∣travagance of the American war before their eyes; with the pensions, sinecure places, and Peerages, so lavishly bestowed by Ministers of late years, open to their view; the Country Gentlemen would have scouted every idea of a criminal prosecu∣tion upon so contemptible charge; I, there∣fore, played a deeper, and a more artful part—I began by telling them, that pro∣vinces, once most flourishing, Mr. Hastings had desolated—that countries, once emi∣nently peopled, were now inhabited only by beasts of prey—that institutions, sacred in the opinions of nations, he had pub∣licly
<PB N="xxxv" REF="36"/>
violated—that commerce he had destroyed, and that the revenues by his mismanagement had greatly declined. The Country Gentlemen believed me, and they voted with me. My work from this time was easy, in the House; but out of doors, your annual budget, in which you so pointedly contradicted all my state∣ments, hurt my reputation considerably; and as if that were not enough, you have now taken a step which has <HI>ruined me,</HI> and will materially injure <HI>you.</HI> Had you <HI>no recollection</HI> of the evidence which <HI>the new Baronet</HI> gave in Westminster Hall? The man, whom <HI>you</HI> have made Governor General, has sworn, that from 1770 to 1789, including every year of Mr. Hasting's administration, Bengal had pro∣gressively <HI>improved</HI> in agriculture and <HI>popu∣lation,</HI> that the natives were <HI>happier,</HI> and their property <HI>better protected, in that period,</HI> than under their own sovereigns, and that
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="37"/>
<HI>of Mr. Hastings</HI> they entertained <HI>a very favourable opinion.</HI> How can I affirm here∣after, that Mr. Hastings was a tyrant, an oppressor, a murderer, a captain-general of iniquity, or that India, on his departure from it, felt relieved from a weight under which she had long groaned? It will be said to me, if the solemn testimony of a man, whom <HI>your gracious sovereign de∣lighteth to honour,</HI> and whom his confiden∣tial servants have appointed Governor General of India, is to be believed, you, Mr. Burke, have been imposing upon, and deceiving us. What answer can I make? unless I am ready to pronounce that next to that act which I so violently censured a few years ago, this appointment of Sir John Shore is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the most gigantic instance of corruption"</Q> ever committed in the world!</P>
<P>But though you and Mr. Pitt had no
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="38"/>
consideration <HI>for me,</HI> you might have been alarmed <HI>for yourselves.</HI> Though it be true, that you differed most widely from me as to the state of Bengal, and when I declared it to be ruined irretrievably, you pronounced it to be most <HI>flourishing</HI> and <HI>prosperous,</HI> yet it is equally true, that you <HI>ultimately voted</HI> with me, and you have paid the Solicitors bill, for very heavy charges incurred by my orders, in an attempt to prove <HI>legally</HI> what <HI>you</HI> have publickly declared to be utterly <HI>un∣founded in truth.</HI></P>
<P>You ought to have recollected, that since this most unhappy business in France, the people of England have had the insolence to think, and to speak what they think, with much more freedom than formerly. There is no longer a blind reverence paid to great names, or to great authorities—Remember my words in Parliament, prophetic they were, and the prediction is almost accom∣plished.
<PB N="xxviii" REF="39"/>
I said, that in this impeachment of Mr. Hastings,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Infamy must necessarily rest somewhere."</Q>
It will not be from me alone, that the public will ask, how it hap∣pens that sixty thousand pounds of their money has been expended? that the first principle of Magna Charta has been violated by the extension of a criminal trial to a period unknown <HI>in former times,</HI> and which no man could have suspected would have happened <HI>at any time?</HI> They will say, that you have proved your disbelief of the <HI>foun∣dation</HI> of this impeachment, by preferring a man who has destroyed <HI>that foundation</HI> by his evidence; or they will take up the ar∣gument in my letter to the Chairman, and totally condemn the appointment, so that in either case, <HI>you</HI> cannot escape the censure of the public—and was this a time to turn po∣litics into farce? The mysteries of Govern∣ment should be concealed from the too prying eyes of the swinish multitude. I have
<PB N="xxxix" REF="40"/>
<HI>in my time</HI> been guilty of great indiscretions, but I have repented, and have made every reparation in my power. The time was, when I affirmed, and took care to let the whole world know,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's speech on the Reform, February 1780.</NOTE> were na∣turally lovers of low company."</Q>
The time was when I censured the University of Oxford, for its unconstitutional address to the Throne<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In May 1776, on the American war.</NOTE>. The time was when I com∣plimented the republican Thomas Paine, as the great and successful champion of Ameri∣can independence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol, in 1777.</NOTE>. The time was when I gloried in my correspondence with good Dr. Francklin<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's speech in December 1781.</NOTE>, though the law pronounced him a rebel, and declared such correspond∣ence to be illegal. The time was when the King's friends were disgusted by certain in∣temperate words, which fell from me, during
<PB N="xl" REF="41"/>
his indisposition, but I am now the avowed champion of monarchy, of the church, and of aristocracy throughout the world. In∣deed, my dear friend, you have acted incon∣siderately to give no harsher term to your conduct. This was not a time to expose me, or to risque your own situation. What conclusion can sober and thinking men come to? They will say, that Mr. Hastings having been made, as you well know, the ladder by which Mr. Pitt and yourself climbed to power, you took the first opportunity to shew <HI>ministerial gratitude</HI> for favours con∣ferred. They will say that <HI>my old friends</HI> having lost <HI>their situations,</HI> by attacking that man, felt a resentment which is <HI>venial</HI> at least, and that they have acted under the in∣fluence of that resentment. Of myself, they will say, that my enquiries have been so very deep, that I must have known the true state of India to be, as <HI>you</HI> have described it, in the House of Commons. In short, when
<PB N="xli" REF="42"/>
they consider, that no one person whom we have represented as having been injured by Mr. Hastings, has been redressed by you or Mr. Pitt—that no one <HI>resource</HI> which Mr. Hastings procured, has been <HI>abandoned</HI> by government—that no one system which <HI>he</HI> framed, has been altered essentially <HI>by you</HI>—that the man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Shore.</NOTE> whom I described as having entered into a corrupt collusion with another person, whom I painted as the most execra∣ble of villains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deby Sing.</NOTE>, has been selected by you, for the government of Bengal—that this man, so selected, was for many years the principal Manager of the Revenues under Mr. Hastings, and has borne testimony to the prosperous condition of Bengal, the happiness of its in∣habitants, and their regard for Mr. Hastings: When they consider, that the credit of the two great parties of England, and of the last Parliament, is implicated in the decision of the impeachment, and that with all the
<PB N="xlii" REF="43"/>
influence, and all the money, employed in more than five years, we have not been able to procure <HI>one solitary individual</HI> to prefer a complaint against Mr. Hastings <HI>from In∣dia</HI>; but, on the contrary, have received the most <HI>damning proofs</HI> of the respect and vene∣ration in which the natives of India hold this persecuted man; what will be the conclusion? what can be the conclusion which the peo∣ple will draw? It must be this; that we have been actuated by private motives, in thus persisting in error, and ought to be responsible to our country, for so unprecedented a pro∣traction of a criminal trial.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke might well express these sen∣timents to Mr. Dundas. He has favoured his late Fellow-Managers with a copy of his letter to the Chairman, and it would be <HI>to their edification</HI> if he would <HI>also</HI> give them the contents of his letter to Mr. Dundas.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. BURKE's SPEECH, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DINAGEPORE, my Lords, is a country-pretty nearly as large as all Yorkshire together, and has a prince at the head called the Rajah, or Zemindar, of Dinagepore. I find that about July<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died in April 1780, and his adopted son was on the 20th of June 1780, ordered to succeed to the zemindary, by an unanimous vote of the board, Messrs. Hastings, Francis, and Wheler.</NOTE> 1780, the Rajah died, leaving a half brother and a son. A litiga∣tion instantly arose in the family; and this litigation was intirely to be referred, and it must finally be decided by the Governor Ge∣neral and Council, being the ultimate autho∣rity
<PB N="2" REF="45"/>
for all the revenue questions there, and they were to proceed on the opinion of the register in their decision. It came before Mr. Hastings, and I find he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, the whole Board.</NOTE> decided the question in favour of Sudernand Sing, son of the Rajah, against his half brother. I find on that decision a rent settled, and a fine paid, so that all this transaction is fair and above board, and I find along with it many extraordinary acts, for I find that Mr. Hast∣ings took a part in favour of the minister Hyderbeg, agreeable to the principles of others, and contrary to his own; and on his establishing the authority of the minister Hyderbeg, I find he gave the guardianship of this son to the brother of the Rajah, as he is called, the brother of the wife of the late Rajah deceased; and when the steward of the province was coming down to represent his case to Mr. Hastings, Mr. Hastings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The whole Board.</NOTE> not only sent him back, so far from hearing him fully, but he ordered him actually to be turned out of his office, to bring in another that could only increase the family dissension.
<PB N="3" REF="46"/>
I find he has taken a sum of £40,000 in 1780, for this account seems to begin in July 1780, or somewhere thereabouts; and to the same period in 1781 there was a regu∣lar payment; so that if it refers to the money paid to him from the Rajah, it is a sum of money corruptly taken by him. As judge he receives it for judgment: but whether the judgment be right or wrong, true or false, he corruptly receives the sum of £40,000 for that judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This assertion could not be true, because this money began to be received on the 11th of August 1779, eight months before the death of the old Rajah, and, as appears by the managers' evidence, was principally paid in the year 1779.</NOTE>; he received it, you will observe, through Gunga Govind Sing, who was the broker of agreements: he was the person that was to receive it by monthly instalments, and to pay it to Mr. Hastings. Gunga Govind Sing's son had in his hand all the papers and documents, so that Mr. Hast∣ings takes a bribe from an infant of five or six years old, through the hands of the re∣gister, whose opinion was to have the whole weight in settling the judgment. This was not a public tribute or fine; so that in fact,
<PB N="4" REF="47"/>
through the register of the country, the keeper of the records, he receives a bribe from a family in point of judgment in dis∣inheriting the brother. I do not say whether it was proper or not, I know these questions of adoption are the most curious in the Gen∣too law; this I know, he succeeded for a bribe, through a man who was in the office of record: this I contend, and I find very soon, other parties concerned.</P>
<P>My Lords, I found very soon after this that the man who gave it, and all the officers under him, were turned out of their employments by Gunga Govind Sing. My Lords, we find them all accused without any appearance or trace upon record, of the mis∣management of his affairs, and accordingly to prevent the relations of his adopted mother, to prevent those who might be supposed to have interest in the family, from abusing him in the trust of his affairs and management of his fortune, Gunga Govind Sing, for I hope you will not suffer me, if I had a mind, to name that tool of a thing called the Com∣mittee, of £62,000 a year: Gunga Govind
<PB N="5" REF="48"/>
Sing, I will do him justice to say, that if he had known that there was another man more accomplished in all iniquity than Gunga Govind Sing, Mr. Hastings would have given him the first place in his confidence, turns them all out of office: but then there was another next to him, a person called Deby Sing, he ranked under Gunga Govind Sing. This man, although he had in former transactions in Purnea for sook the very shape, rules, and names of virtue, yet Mr. Hastings is to acquit him of this—they were reconciled on this occasion. Deby Sing came into of∣fice, superseding all the others.—There is an English gentleman, one Mr. Goodlad, whom you will hear of presently; they appointed him, and the first act they do is cut off £1000 a month from the Rajah's allowance, because he is stated to be extravagant, and to have a great number of dependants to maintain: in short, there is such a flutter and bustle, there never was such a tender guardianship and superin∣tendance as Deby Sing uses, <HI>always with the knowledge of Mr. Hastings,</HI> to this poor Rajah, who had just given £40,000 (if he did give £40,000) for his inheritance to Mr. Hastings; but probably because that money could not
<PB N="6" REF="49"/>
come out of the surplus of his affairs, Mr. Goodlad had taken £1000 a month from his establishments, which will go very hand∣somely to the payment of any private fine: but Mr. Hastings should at least have ex∣amined before they were turned out, whether it was proper or no. Now they are turned out, and when I come to enquire, I do not find that the new guardians have brought to ac∣count one shilling of the money they received; there is not a single shadow, no not one word, to be found in the accounts of Deby Sing and Mr. Goodlad. They first put Deby Sing in possession of the Rajah's family, and the management of it; and the very next step, in the course of one year, is to give him the farming of the whole receipt of these three provinces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke makes an important mistake here.—Deby Sing took the farm of Dinagepore in May 1781. In September 1781, Mr. Shore entered a minute on the Committee Proceedings, stating the enormous expences of the Zemindar of Dinagepore, an infant of six years of age, and recommending a reduction of those ex∣pences. In consequence of this minute, Deby Sing and Mr. Goodlad had the superintendence of the family. Mr. Hastings had <HI>been three months absent from Calcutta</HI> at this time, and did not return until February 1782.</NOTE>. If the <HI>Peshcush</HI> was not received
<PB N="7" REF="50"/>
as a bribe for the nomination of the Rajah, it was received as a bribe for office. Which is the best or the worst, I shall not pretend to determine; or whether Mr. Hastings got it from Deby Sing for appointing him guardian, or for the judgment; but you find the Rajah in his possession, you find his house and education in his possession: this makes it necessary you should know, that after com∣mitting the family of the Rajah to him, he accepted the proposals Deby Sing made in the name of his son; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and" (say the Committee)
"his abilities and indefatigable attention to business are so well known, that we trust the measure will meet with your approba∣tion, &amp;c.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This is a quotation from a letter written by Mr. Shore to the Governor General and Council in the month of November 1781, in which he relates the measures taken by the Committee of Revenue for let∣ting the lands of Bengal. It appears by that letter, that the Zemindar of Dinagepore being a minor, the Com∣mittee had farmed the province to Deby Sing, upon this principle only, that he had offered what they thought the best terms for the Company, and being a man whom Mr. Shore had well known from his intimacy with Mr. Ducarell, and by Deby Sing's having been em∣ployed under Mr. Shore himself for many years at Moorshedabad, he gives him that fair character, which he conceived him to merit. It was in 1772 that Deby Sing was accused of mal-practices during the famine of 1770, and in 1773 he was acquitted, chiefly on the testimony of Mr. Ducarell.</NOTE>"</Q>
Here is an acknowledgment of his fidelity, and that he is a person to
<PB N="8" REF="51"/>
whom no objection can be made. This pre∣sent to Mr. Hastings is by him recorded, and sent to the East India Company. Mr. Hastings has recorded (though he publicly authorised Deby Sing's nomination to this great body of power) that he knew Deby Sing to be a man against whom the most atrocious iniquities were charged, that were ever charged upon man. Now, though it is a large field, and though it is a thing that I feel reluctance in mentioning, exhausted as I am at present; yet such is the magnitude of the subject, such the hurtful consequences of superseding all persons, to give the country into the hands of Gunga Govind Sing and Deby Sing, that I will proceed. It is not a subject for me perhaps to go into, unless I can prove to you that Mr. Hastings knew
<PB N="9" REF="52"/>
the man, and that he has avowed his know∣ledge of him, though he accepts him as a man against whom no possible objection could be made.</P>
<P>It is necessary to state to you who was this Deby Sing, to whom these great trusts were appointed and profits given. Deby Sing was a person of the tribe of Banyans, that is to say, the trading and merchant class of India; and he was practised in all those little arts and frauds to get money, and was successful: He was employed by Mahomed Reza Cawn, while that great man had the management of all the affairs of state and revenue in his hands under the Company. Deby Sing paid his court to him with all the assiduity and subtilness which those who have no princi∣ple are very apt to use. When M. R. Cawn was brought down by Mr. Hastings and ordered on a strange charge to Calcutta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a singular fact, that as often as people in power in England have had a wish to carry a point against the East India Company, they have had recourse to the foulest calumnies. Mr. Burke here does justice to Ma∣homed Reza Cawn; but in 1773, when Lord North and his friends made Mr. Hastings <HI>the single exception</HI> to the universal abuse bestowed upon the servants of the Com∣pany, Colonel Dow wrote a book, in which there is the following passage reflecting upon Mahomed Reza Cawn:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Year after year brought new tyrants, or confirmed the old in the practice of their former oppression. The tenants being at length ruined, the farmers were unable to make good their contract with go∣vernment. Their cruelties to those in prison re∣coiled at length on themselves. Many of them were bound to stakes, and whipped: but their poverty ceased to be feigned. Their complaints were heard in every square of Moorshedabad, <HI>and not a few of them expired in agonies under the lash.</HI>"</Q>
In 1783, at the distance of ten years, when <HI>another attack</HI> was made upon the Company, a similar unjustifiable calumny was repeated by Mr. Burke. Mahomed Reza Cawn, no longer in power under the British government, had <HI>recovered</HI> his character, but <HI>our administration</HI> in India was as bad as ever.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were we to be driven out of India this day (said Mr. Burke in 1783), nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed during the inglorious period of our dominion, by any thing better than the Ourang Outang, or the Tiger."</Q></NOTE>,
<PB N="10" REF="53"/>
Deby Sing lent him considerable sums of money, for this great man was accused of great crimes, and acquitted, £250,000 in debt; that is to say, as soon as he was a
<PB N="11" REF="54"/>
great debtor he ceased to be a great criminal. Deby Sing obtained his interest, and one of the first great concerns intrusted to him was the province of Purnea: how did he shew himself there? he so well acquitted himself in that place, that the province was totally ruined and desolated. To give you an idea of this, the revenue, that in one year was £90,000, fell the next year to £60,000; and he so completely dried up all the source of the revenue, that it produced not equal to half of what it had been originally let at. Now when the farmers, who were Calcutta Banyans, looked at the province in which they hoped to make their for∣tunes, they suddenly fled from it, and gave £10,000 to be rid of the bargain. The corruptions and oppressions were too abominable to escape notice, and accordingly this man was removed from his employment in 1773, but not from his profits, which he kept<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to a transaction which happened imme∣diately after Mr. Hastings came to Bengal in 1772. Deby Sing had managed the province of Purnea when it was superintended by Mr. Ducarell. A complaint was preferred against him to Mr. Hastings, in 1772, who ordered him under a guard to Moorshedabad. After a full enquiry, the complaint was proved to be ill-founded, and Mr. Ducarell (of whom Mr. Fox spoke in such high terms of praise) was the principal evi∣dence to prove his innocence, and his merit.—Mr. Burke knows this just as well as the editor does.</NOTE>. Stigmatized, but still in power, he

obtains the office of high Duan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deby Sing was appointed Duan to the provincial council of Moorshedabad, and Mr. Shore Persian trans∣lator to that council, in November 1773; the former continued in this office until the abolition of the pro∣vincial council in February 1781. Mr. Burke so con∣founds dates and places, that it is necessary to explain what he leaves so obscure.</NOTE>, or deputy steward of the great province, the capital of the country: in short, the whole power of Duan fell into his hands.</P>
<P>The council consisted of young men, not, like other young men, of pleasurable dispositions, but, like young men in India, willing to possess pleasure, and the means of acquiring a good fortune, by the effects of ruin. Deby Sing took compassion upon them,
<PB N="13" REF="56"/>
and endeavoured to lead them to the ways of property, and pleasure. There is a tax in that country much more productive than honourable—a tax on public prostitutes, which Deby Sing imposed, and with that ability for which he has been so much com∣mended, he selected those who had the great∣est personal merit: the ladies were called Pearl of Price, Ruby of Pure Blood, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. all those fine names that height∣ened the general harmony, and increased the vivid satisfactions of love, with all the al∣lurements of avarice: and Deby Sing made frequent visits to the young gentlemen.—He carried this moving seraglio about with him wherever he went, and he supplied his guests liberally with the best wines of France, and exquisite entertain∣ment; with the Indian perfumes, and every thing that tends to increase the luxu∣ries of such a scene. This great magician amongst them, chaste in the middle of disso∣luteness, sober in the midst of drunkenness, and active in the lap of drowsiness, brought these young men such papers to sign, as in a sober hour never could have been given; and
<PB N="14" REF="57"/>
accordingly he conveyed to himself such grants, as never could have been made other∣wise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We can take upon us to affirm that the whole of this account is a fable. This provincial council con∣sisted of some of the ablest servants ever employed in the revenue line in Bengal. On its first formation, the second member of the government was the chief, Mr. Baber the second, Mr. Maxwell third, Mr. Hosea fourth, and Mr. Hogarth fifth; some of those were succeeded by Mr. Cowper, now a member of the su∣preme council, Mr. David Anderson, whose merits are generally known, Mr. Moore, Mr. Foley, and others: but not one of that loose and detestable character de∣scribed by Mr. Burke.</NOTE>. This keeper of brothels is the man that was chosen by Mr. Hastings as a pro∣per man to superintend the young Rajah, to lead him in the path of all piety and virtue. Deby Sing knew that pleasure would not do alone, and he supplied pleasure under that species of entertainments which he knew very well how to manage, but it would not have done if he had not done something also for their necessitites; and accordingly he got the sole and regular government: he got several provinces under various names, sometimes appearing in his own name, sometimes dis∣appearing
<PB N="15" REF="58"/>
and shrouding himself under others, as successful or detected villany gave him countenance, or made him timid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not one trace of such transactions in the province of Moorshedabad, as Mr. Burke relates, is to be found.</NOTE>. My Lords, in this new case every situation was a new bribe; he oppressed the people, and in one of them he publicly acted by proxy. As for the farm at Dinagepore, he was given it with great apparent considera∣tion: he was given it at an advanced rent, but he was to take care it should not be levied with any new contribution, and he was sent by Mr. Hastings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is a very unfounded statement—Deby Sing got the farm of Dinagepore from the Committee of Re∣venue, in May 1781, after much consideration, upon no other ground than this, that his terms were, upon comparison with other proposals, the most advantageous to Government, and the same for the other two pro∣vinces.—The acts of the Committee were confirmed by the Governor General and Council.</NOTE> to govern these three great countries of Dinagepore, Rungpore, and Edaracpore. He did not lose a moment. If you can forget his character, you may easily believe that
<PB N="16" REF="59"/>
Deby Sing had not a more correct me∣mory. The first thing he did<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charge on the public investigation was dis∣poved.—Mr. Burke states this, and all that follow, as if they had been facts proved by evidence.</NOTE> was to seize on all the gentlemen of that country, throw them all in prison, keep them in irons, and oblige them to sign a paper for the in∣crease of their rents<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This also was disproved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The next step he took, was to lay on them a number of new taxes, which by his co∣venants he was not to have laid; those taxes amounted to as much as the increased rent of the landed gentry and freeholders of the country. Being thus in imprisonment, oblig∣ed to sign those bonds, and loaded with taxes, they became totally unable to pay, the next step was, to seize on and sequester the lands: those that pay no taxes are the de∣mesne lands for themselves and their fami∣lies, and those that pay rents, are those that wish to maintain an independance. These demesne lands were sold for one year's pur∣chase,
<PB N="17" REF="60"/>
the price there is ten years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was proved that the lands sold, which were very inconsiderable in their value, were sold at a fair price. Deby Sing was compelled to restore them, and to lose the purchase money, because he had acted without the permission of Government in making the pur∣chases.</NOTE>. Who were they sold to? You are ready to antici∣pate me: they were sold to Deby Sing him∣self, through one of his agents: they amounted in all, to the amount of £70,000 sterling a year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We should imagine there must be a mistake here, as the lands sold, did not amount to seventy thousand rupees a year, and the Governor General and Council compelled Deby Sing to restore them all. The price of lands in Bengal is two, and not ten years purchase. The whole rent of Rungpore was not more than £120,000 a year.</NOTE>, but according to the value of money in that country, they were worth very con∣siderable sums; but were sequestered, and purchased so much under their proper rate, that the fee simple of an acre of land sold for about seven or eight shillings, and the miserable wretches received the payment for the lands out of the money that was collected from them. The money was
<PB N="18" REF="61"/>
put into a separate collection, and the moment it was paid, the rents were raised again, and the produce was reserved as a sacred deposit for himself, or some other person whom Mr. Hastings should appoint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was no accusation of this sort made.</NOTE>. The next was the sale of the goods: they were obliged to carry them to market, and there is one circumstance that will especially call for your pity. Most of the persons who are principal landholders or Zemindars, happen∣ed at that time to be women. The sex <HI>there</HI> are in a state of imprisonment, but by their sanctity they are treated with all possible at∣tention and respect. No hand of the law can touch them, but they have a custom of sending family bailiffs and family serjeants into their houses, and accordingly such persons came into their houses, and became masters of them; the men and women all fled; all the charity lands were sold at the same market. But this is not all; there were things yet dearer to them, the poor consolations of imagination at death, for all the substantial miseries of life. There were lands set apart for their funeral service; how dear they were to all
<PB N="19" REF="62"/>
the people of India I hope you will know on further enquiry. But this tyranny of Deby Sing, more consuming than fire, more greedy than the grave, seized these lands also; and sold, indeed, almost all the Zemindars pos∣sessions. Their houses were burnt, their carts were broken up. These things are to come in proof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was <HI>impossible,</HI> until the matter should be first charged in the House of Commons; that House, whose Delegate Mr. Burke was, <HI>never heard a word of this story.</HI></NOTE>. This was the manner in which all the principal gentry, all the se∣condary gentry, all the women, and all the minors, were disposed of. What was the situation of the poor men, of the yeomen? I say, their situation is ten thousand times worse, if possible, if there are degrees of degradation in utter ruin. They were driven like horned cattle into the common prison, and there they were obliged to sign, as the principal Zemindars had done before; they were obliged to sign recognitions to their utter ruin; they were let out only to their destruction. There were such an incredible variety of new taxes imposed every day, that they were obliged to sell almost all the corn
<PB N="20" REF="63"/>
of the country at once. It happening to be a year of fulness, and the markets overloaded, their crops did not sell for above one-fourth of the value, so that being overloaded with taxes, they came to the next resource; they were obliged to sell every where, and hurry to market all the cattle: those cattle that were worth 20 s. or 25 s. a-piece, five of them were known to sell for 10 s. The next thing that they were to part with was the ornaments of the women. They were obliged to be parted with. They do not decorate themselves according to our mode, but their decoration was a resource upon emergency, and if they have got any gold, it may serve for assistance. They were all forced to be brought to market along with the cattle; so that gold and silver sold for 20 per cent. under its value. But some will say, gold and silver sold under its value! certainly, where there is an overloaded market and wicked purchasers.</P>
<P>Permit me, my Lords, to set before you the state of the people that remain, the victims of this oppression. What you are going to hear is an answer from the author, Deby
<PB N="21" REF="64"/>
Sing; who being charged with this compul∣sory sale of the lands, says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is notorious that poverty generally prevails among the husbandmen, and the poor are seldom pos∣sessed of any substance except at the time they reap their harvest; and this is the case, that such numbers of them were swept away by famine, their effects were only a little earthen-ware, and their houses a handful of straw, the sale of which was not worth a few rupees—but it is still in∣credible that there should not be a want of purchasers."</Q>—My Lords, I produce this strange testimomy from the per∣son himself who was concerned in racking these people, and I produce it to shew the state of the country. It is not bribes of £40,000 only. Those who give these bribes of £40,000 must receive four times that sum. The people, while they were ha∣rassed in this manner, sought that dreadful resource that misery is apt to fly to;—they fell into the hands of usurers. Usurers are a bad resource at any time; those usurers, to the hardness of that kind of description of people, added another that makes men ten times
<PB N="22" REF="65"/>
worse, that is, their own necessity. They had very little help against the oppression of power; they were obliged to pay, to answer the bribes and gifts given to Mr. Hastings, not 5, 10, 20, or 50 per cent.;—no such thing; 600 per cent. by the year; beggaring the people, therefore, was the only resource. Such is the consequence of bribery.—The poor unfortunate people, in this way stript of every thing, land and cattle, their in∣instruments of husbandry next go to market; after that, the persons attending them dragged them from their own miserable hovels, and their last homes were burnt to the ground. It was not the exaction of revenue, it was a cruel robbery; and there remained to the unhappy people of that country but two things, their families and their friends. Men generally console themselves with a satisfac∣tion, in proportion as they are deprived of other advantages, that they still find a re∣source at home; but the most tender of parents, the most affectionate and tender husbands, could not console themselves with their children or their wives. This was the case of the country in respect of their penury.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="66"/>I am obliged to make use of some apology for the horrid scene I am now going to open.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the punishments inflicted upon the Ryots of Rungpore and Dinagepore, were in many instances of such nature, that I would ra∣ther wish to draw a veil over them, than shock your feelings by a detail; but it is substantially necessary for the sake of jus∣tice and humanity, and the honour of Government, that they should be exposed, to be remembered in future."</Q></P>
<P>My Lords, let this be my anticipating apology. It is indeed a most disgraceful scene to human nature that I am now going to mention. When the people were stript of every thing, it was in some cases suspected,
<PB N="25" REF="68"/>
and justly, that they had hid some part of their grain. Their bodies were then ap∣plied to the fiercest mode of torture, which was this: they began with them, by wind∣ing cords about their fingers; there they clung and were incorporated together; then they hammered wedges of wood and iron between their fingers, till they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cruelties mentioned in this part of Mr. Burke's speech were charged to have been committed in a small district, called Dhee Jumla, dependent upon Dinage∣pore.

What was the return? Cords, ham∣mers,
<PB N="26" REF="69" MS="y"/>
tortures, and maiming was the re∣turn. This is the situation in which those hands were bound, which act with resistless power when they are lifted up to heaven, powerful in prayer against the authors of such confusion. Let us at least deprecate, and secure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ourselves from the vengeance due to those who massacred them. Let us, for God's sake: it is a serious thought. They begun there, but if they begun there, there they did not stop. The heads of the villages, the leading yeomen of the country, re∣spectable for their virtue, and age, were tied together, two and two: unoffending and thus helpless, they were then thrown over a bar, and beat with bamboo canes on the soles of their feet, 'till their nails started from their toes; and were afterwards so beaten with cudgels, that their blood ran both from their noses, eyes, and ears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charge was also proved to be false, after the fullest investigation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>My Lords, they did not stop there; bam∣boos, wangees, rattans, canes, commonwhips, and scourges, were not sufficient. They
<PB N="27" REF="70"/>
found a tree in the country which bears strong and sharp thorns. Not satis∣fied with those other cruelties, they scourged them with that. Not satisfied with this, but searching every thing through the deepest parts of nature, where she seems to have forgot her usual bene∣volence, they found a poisonous plant, which is a deadly caustic, which inflames the bruised part, and often ends with death. This they applied to those wounds. My Lords, this we know, that there are men so made, that even the pains of the body fortify the sufferer to bear the pains of the mind. The mind strengthens as the body suffers, and rises with an elastic force against those that torture it. The mind gets the better of the body. Those people that are dealt with in this manner, people that can bear their own tortures, cannot bear those of their children and friends. The innocent children were brought and scourged before the face of their parents! cruelly scourged before their parents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After a very full enquiry, this charge was found to be false.</NOTE>!
<PB N="28" REF="71"/>
They bound the father and the son face to face, arm to arm, body to body, and in that state, they whipt them with every refinement of cruelty; so that every blow which escaped the father, should fall upon the son, and every blow which escaped the son, should fall upon the father; so that where they did not wound the sense, they should wound and tear the sensibilities of nature. This was not all. Virgins that were kept from the sight of sun, were dragged into the public court, which should be a refuge against all oppression; and there in the presence of the day, their delicacies were offended, and their virginity cruelly violated, by the basest and cruellest of man∣kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not a syllable of this charge was true.</NOTE>. It did not end there. The wives of the men of the country only suffered less by this, they lost their honour in the bottom of the most cruel dungeons, where they were confined<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This charge, and the next also, proved totally false.</NOTE>. These are wrongs to the people, wrongs to their manners, wrongs to their bodies, and the feelings of man∣kind; they were dragged out naked, in

that situation exposed to public view, and scourged before all the people.</P>
<P>My Lords, here is my authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The authority thus quoted by Mr. Burke, was a translation of a complaint delivered to Mr. Pater∣son, and by him transmitted just as he received it, to the Board of Revenue.

They ap∣plied burning torches, and cruel slow fire, to their bodies.</P>
<P>My Lords, I am ashamed to open it; these infernal fiends, in defiance of every thing divine and human, plunged torches
<PB N="30" REF="73"/>
into the source of life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This charge excited equal horror; but on the ful∣lest enquiry, it was proved to have been made with∣out the smallest foundation.</NOTE>.

These are cruelties that arose from the giving power to such a man as Deby Sing, and his in∣fernal villains.</P>
<P>My Lords, I had forgot, I have it here, the manner in which you may know the length, the breadth, and depth of these horrible cruelties. They took these unfor∣tunate husbandmen whom they had impri∣soned; they whipt them: I assure you, these details are not pleasant, but they are useful. These men were taken often out of prison, awoke from their sleep, and these tormentors watched for the moments when

They were plunged into cold water, then led out into the villages, to see if they could raise any thing from the hands of the villagers.</P>
<P>My Lords, the people of India are patience itself; their patience is too criminal; but they burst at once into a wild and universal up∣roar and unarmed rebellion, from one end to another. The two provinces<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is not a true statement. The fact is, that <HI>Dinagepore</HI> never broke out into rebellion.

The people fell,

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"I cannot con∣clude without an additional remark, that there never was a cause which appears to have been more thoroughly investigated, or more impartially conduct∣ed. Every member of the existing government at the time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Messirs, Hastings, Wheler, Macpherson, and Stables.</NOTE>, it is notorious, had formed a decisive opinion against Deby Sing, in consequence of Mr. Paterson's reports; and the measures adopted were conformable to those sentiments, and calculated to shew that, if proved guilty, he had no mercy to expect. It was under this decided and avowed disapprobation of Government, that the Commissioners reluctantly undertook an in∣vestigation of this cause. Their proceedings, in my opinion, do equal credit to their integrity and to their understandings. Facts are not left to bare assertion for support. Every charge (and some not specifically pointed out to the Commissioners) is examined with scrupulous accuracy; and wherever evidence could be obtained, it has been sought for, and brought forward. The proceedings are not summary, but voluminous and minute; and if the conduct of any Zemindar or farmer in the country were to pass an investigation of the same nature, I may venture to assert, that he would not be deemed innocent."</P>
<P>"The transactions in Dhee Jumla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where the atrocious cruelties stated by Mr. Burke were said to have been committed.</NOTE>, being wholly un∣connected with the proceedings in Rungpore, I have followed the example of the Commissioners, in consi∣dering them separately. Their report is so full, clear, and decisive, that I shall content myself with referring to that in support of my opinion, which is, that Deby Sing, so far from being culpable in any instance alleged against him, appears to have been moderate in his demands for rent, attentive to the complaints preferred, and to have punished the persons proved to have oppressed the Ryots, on their complaints. <HI>I am happy also to remark, that many of the worst accu∣sations preferred against him appear to have had no existence whatever.</HI>"</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Though Sir John Shore acquits Deby Sing of having had any share in such acts of cruelty as were really committed in Dhee Jumla, while he states also that many of the worst accusations were utterly unfounded, yet the conduct of Deby Sing in <HI>Rungpore</HI> did not escape his censure; at the same time he thought it but justice to remark, that the actual guilt of Deby Sing bore no sort of proportion to the magnitude of the charges pre∣ferred against him.</P></NOTE>. To say no more, he was a patient witness of the rebellion. He immediately sent
<PB N="33" REF="76"/>
for British officers, who ordered military ex∣ecution; and you may easily believe how
<PB N="34" REF="77"/>
soon regular troops got the better of unarmed despair. They were conquered, vanquished, and slaughtered; and Mr. Goodlad ordered, that of these miserable people, two or three should undergo the process of the law, and be publicly hanged up; and hanged up they were.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, though the rebellion seemed to be crushed, the country was in that situation that Mr. Goodlad was
<PB N="35" REF="78"/>
obliged to write down to Calcutta, that there never had been so material and serious a rebellion in Bengal. This was in 1782, and it made a very great noise in Calcutta. But there is such a gulph between us and Calcutta, that I venture to say, not one of all the great and noble auditors present ever heard of it. On the contrary, it is a constant rule that, whenever any thing is quiet in Bengal, you are sure to hear of it. Here, the inside of Bengal Government was exposed to view. When they heard this, they thought it behoved them not to pass by such conduct, and which a poor easy man could not tell how to account for. They, therefore, cast about for a good-natured easy man, who should make that sort of report, which might lay faults on both sides; and, as a retrospect could only tend to renew greivances, that the criminal should be left in possession of his acquisitions, and the people of their possessions. They wished it might appear, that the material cause of the insurrection might be the determination of the Zemindars to pay no more rent. The Committee, however, thought it necessary to send a Commissioner to examine into the
<PB N="36" REF="79"/>
cause of the insurrection, and they cast about to find a man that was fit to be a good re∣presenter of affairs, that so the channel of all this ferocity and wickedness should be con∣cealed. Accordingly, they found out a man of a tolerable free character, supposed to be a man of moderation, almost to excess; mild, quiet, totally unconnected with party, and of peaceable character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it were of consequence to expose Mr. Burke's blunders upon all occasions, the writer of this note would observe, that the real character of Mr. Paterson (except that he is a man of honour and integrity) is di∣rectly the <HI>reverse</HI> of Mr. Burke's description. He is a gentleman of uncommonly <HI>lively parts,</HI> a very neat poet, an excellent companion, and, with great good nature in private life, possesses an admirable turn for satire, as every man of letters in Bengal well knew. Mr. Paterson was appointed the Commissioner on the recommendation of Sir John Shore, the latter being the acting Chief of the Committee, and Mr. Paterson <HI>one of his assistants.</HI></NOTE>. They thought that just such a man as that, was exactly the man for their purpose; and they took it for granted, that from him they might expect an account in which faults should be left out on both sides, and buried in oblivion; and it should be remembered, that a retrospect could only tend to renew grievances. They chose
<PB N="37" REF="80"/>
well; but there never was a man so mistaken in the world. Mr. Paterson, undert his quiet, honest character, concealed a vigorous mind, deciding understanding, and a feeling heart. He is the son of a gentleman of venerable age, and extraordinary character, in this country, who long filled the seat of Chairman of the Committee of Supply in the House of Commons, but is now retired to an honour∣able rest in the neighbourhood; this son, as soon as he was appointed to the commis∣sion, dreaded the consequences; but to justify himself, he took out a letter that he had received from his father, which was the preservation of his character, and the destruc∣tion of his fortune; and this letter enjoined him to pursue such a perfect line of con∣duct, and to hazard every prosecution rather than to disgrace truth, that he went up into the country in a proper frame of mind to do his duty. I beg to read from his letter, how that gentleman found that country on his arrival, and how he accounts for the re∣bellion.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In my two reports, I have set forth the general manner that oppession has provoked the husbandmen to part with
<PB N="38" REF="81" MS="y"/>

Conceive the situation of the husbandman.

<P>You will allow the full effect of prejudice on this subject; the consequence of a loss of the cast to these persons I have stated to your Lordships before; the loss of the cast there amounts to more than a complete excommu∣nication, outlawry, or attainder, in this coun∣try; the man or woman that has lost their cast are no longer the children of their parents,
<PB N="39" REF="82"/>
and they can survive only in the estimation of the lowest and basest of mankind. But there was an instrument of torture to them still worse: there is a kind of pillory, a disgrace in that country, particularly to the Bramins, which is, to be put on a bullock, with drums beating, and led through the town; this was so done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This punishment was inflicted, and very properly, upon a man called Basdeo Doss, who had of his own authority <HI>inflicted such of the cruelties upon some of the in∣habitants of Dhee Jumla, as they really suffered.</HI> When Sir John Shore gave his opinion in November 1788, upon this cause, he remarked, that Basdeo Doss de∣served the most exemplary punishment for his con∣duct.</NOTE>, and the people supplicated that the man should not be so cruelly treated. I have now stated the causes of the rebellion, and the opi∣nion of the man when he saw that coun∣try; which was not a matter of inquisi∣tion, it was a matter of public notoriety. There is an expression of one of the men that went into it, that he passed twelve miles without seeing a light, and with∣out finding means of fire to dress his neces∣sary

food. All these hurtful calamities were the consequence of the government of Deby Sing; one would imagine that this drew up∣on him the severity of the Governor; that if ever there were any arbitrary power, it would be here exercised: we must not be too hasty in forming an opinion. The re∣port of the Commissioner might be sub∣jected to great mistakes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to a minute of Sir John Shore, which he presented in the Committee of Revenue, in which he expresses his doubts of the truth of the facts, and observes, that if they were of such a nature as Mr. Paterson had stated, proofs might be procured without any difficulty.</NOTE>; Gunga Govind Sing, when it came before him, well played his part. On the first report, the commit∣tee were a little stunned; they did not know what to do with it, but at last, after that, came down a full report, with evidence in the full body of it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is not the case—Mr. Paterson merely trans∣mitted the complaints as he received them, and was not responsible either for their truth or falsehood.</NOTE>; as the Commissioner was a man of business, and of serious thinking, he made such a report, filled with such a body

of evidence, as probably the records of that country cannot furnish. Reports of all per∣sons who act in the government by its autho∣rity, in public functions, exercising public trust, are entitled to presumptive credit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is undoubtedly true; but it was not from any doubt of Mr. Paterson's veracity, that Sir John Shore <HI>required some proofs</HI> of the assertions made by the Natives, who delivered the complaints to Mr. Paterson.</NOTE> for the truth of all they assert, and throw the responsibility and the burden of the proof on those that shake it; unless corruption, malice, or some evil disposition is found in the per∣son who makes this report, it ought to pass in the opinion of those who ordered it as proof; but very different ideas prevail in this committee of Mr. Hastings. The first act of this executive body, neither having the right or the name of a judicial character, was to turn Mr. Paterson into a voluntary accuser: having made a charge, they call upon him to prove it; they put Deby Sing against Mr. Paterson; they take an objection, that the depositions are not all upon oath, they were never ordered to be upon oath, not one
<PB N="42" REF="85"/>
word is upon oath; they throw a doubt, a shadow, upon them all. In short, Deby Sing appears, as your Lordships imagine he will appear, a very difficulty, a very slur in the way of their commission, and they suppose that Mr. Paterson has been carried away by the warmth of his imagination; that he has as∣sumed what is not to be proved: they allow that presumptive proofs are pretty strong against Deby Sing, and Mr. Hastings is of opinion, that there is nothing here charged against him, of which he is not guilty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here again is one of those <HI>misrepresentations</HI> of which, we hope, Mr. Burke <HI>only</HI> is capable. Mr. Hastings never pronounced any opinion on the case of Deby Sing, be∣cause the enquiry was not completed during his Govern∣ment; but he was so much prejudiced against him, that he ordered him <HI>to be removed from all</HI> his appoint∣ments <HI>pending the</HI> enquiry; and he declared, just before he left Bengal, that such was his opinion of Deby Sing, that he thought he <HI>might</HI> be guilty of the enormities alleged against him, and that he <HI>might</HI> be able to con∣ceal them from Mr. Goodlad.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM convinced that my continuation of this cause has been attended with some dif∣ficulties
<PB N="44" REF="87"/>
to your Lordships, on account of my inability to proceed yesterday; but your Lord∣ships' love of justice has removed every ob∣struction, and I therefore proceed with con∣fidence to the business now before your Lordships. I think, to the best of my re∣membrance, the House adjourned at the period of time in which I was endeavouring to illustrate the mischiefs that happened from Mr. Hastings throwing off his respon∣sibility, by delegating that power to a council, and in fact to Black Men, and the conse∣quence of it, in preventing the detection and the punishment of the grossest abuses that ever were known to be committed in India, or in any other part of the world. I stated to you, that Mr. Commissioner Paterson was sent into that country; that he was sent, with all the authority of Government, with powers not only to hear, to report, but to redress the grievances which he should find; in short, there was nothing wanted to his power, but an honest Court to report to. He reported those things which I delivered to you, and did very imperfectly, very faintly, and short∣ly, according to my materials, state to you,
<PB N="45" REF="88"/>
that, instead of being furnished with that share of power which Mr. Hastings has en∣deavoured to use on other occasions against those who had incurred his private resent∣ment, this man was put in all business of offence and defence, which the most litigious and prevaricating laws that ever were in∣vented to screen peculation and power from the cries of an oppressed people could effect. Mr. Paterson, who as I stated, was deputed, with all the authority of Government, to a great province, was now considered as a voluntary accuser, and to make good the articles of his charge against Deby Sing; but I believe Deby Sing did not long remain in the hum∣ble sinking suppliant situation of a man under charges, or in a secondary and subordinate situation, as answering those charges. By degrees, as the protection increased, his bold∣ness grew along with it; he no longer took the tone of an accused person, he reverses the situation imposed on Mr. Patterson; he beeomes Mr. Paterson's accuser; he began at first to say, he believed he was mistaken; took up things a little too warmly; he now steps forward, charges him with forgery,
<PB N="46" REF="89"/>
and desires to be heard in this nominal Com∣mittee. This business has now taken a third shape; first, Mr. Paterson is a Commissioner, to report; then he is to make good his charge; then he is accused and ordered to answer the charges; this is the third metamorphosis of Mr. Paterson's situation. In this situation, which is what I will venture to say never hap∣pened before in the annals of mankind, he was ordered to bring Deby Sing to prison, that in∣famous character, that abandoned mortal, load∣ed with crimes by the Committee themselves. Deby Sing was committed under guard, but he was soon taken from under that guard, and he sat assessor by the side of Mr. Pa∣terson. In such a situation all human con∣stancy would be shaken, and its manhood gone. To report the grievances of those that had been rich, but were now undone by oppressors, was invidious; the road of for∣tune was easy to Mr. Paterson. I believe you are convinced, that the Committee would not have received a different report, as a proof of bribery; they would rather have received it as tending to soften and conciliate this dif∣ficult matter, and to settle the order of
<PB N="47" REF="90"/>
Government as soon as possible; but this man, who withstood all temptations; whose honour, fidelity, principle, and good cha∣racter, received the thanks, and withstood the thanks of those that accused him; this man was turned into the accused person in this Committee. In this situation, I must do him the justice to say, he never tottered one moment; he stood like a hero<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of this part of the account is so ex∣tremely wild, that no man, without explanation, can understand it. Sir John Shore complained, that Mr. Paterson's accounts were inaccurate or vague, and he censured him for disrespect to the Committee. Mr. Paterson replied; and after much altercation the Com∣mittee sent to the Supreme Council all their corres∣pondence with Mr. Paterson, and <HI>every document and every information</HI> which they had received from him, relative to the insurrection, and to the conduct of Deby Sing. The Supreme Council <HI>(Mr. Hastings being at Lucknow),</HI> viz. Mr. Wheler, Sir John Macpherson, and Mr. Stables, met four days successively, morning and evening, and having read Mr. Paterson's reports, and the documents, they unanimously resolved, <HI>that three sworn Commissioners</HI> should be appointed to go through this cause, and that Deby Sing should be <HI>confined,</HI> and his property <HI>attached,</HI> until judgment was pronounced by the Governor General and Council. The whole of this proceeding is strictly <HI>just, fair,</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI>; but were it otherwise, Mr. Hastings was <HI>absent,</HI> and <HI>igno∣rant of every part of it.</HI> Sir John Shore observes, in 1788, that every member of the Bengal Government, in 1783-4, had formed a <HI>decided opinion against Deby Sing,</HI> and that if found guilty, <HI>he had no mercy to expect.</HI></NOTE>; he was sent
<PB N="48" REF="91"/>
as a protector, when the people looked upon him as carrying with him the whole power of Government. He was forced to go back, to try whether among a miserable, ruined, undone, abject people, he was to find any who had courage enough to stand to their former accusations; such treatment no ser∣vant of Government ever received. The next step was to appoint another set of Com∣missioners, to try the question between him and Deby Sing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Here Mr. Burke closes his account of the com∣plaints which were made from Rungpore. We will therefore, in a very few words, give a fair state of the transactions relative to that province.</P>
<P>In the year 1781, Sir John Shore and the Committee of Revenue conceived that the Government ought to receive about seventy thousand rupees a year from that province, beyond the rent of the preceding year: and at that advanced rent Deby Sing agreed to take it, entering into obligations not to impose any additional taxes upon the Ryots. This engagement was for two years. The first year's rent was paid without a ba∣lance, or a complaint. When six months of the second year were expired, an insurrection broke out in the province, and Mr. Paterson was sent by Sir John Shore and the Committee to enquire and report the cause of it. He transmitted to the Committee several papers, in which certain Zemindars and Ryots stated the several facts which Mr. Burke has mentioned. To determine upon the truth of these complaints, the Su∣preme Council appointed three sworn Commissioners, and, after the fullest and the most minute investiga∣tions, by far the greater number were found to have no sort of foundation. In some instances, Deby Sing, following the example <HI>of the Zemindars,</HI> had collected the revenues with a rigour and severity very unusual under the British Government in India, and he was com∣pelled to make complete satisfaction for every act of injustice he had committed; but, when the points in which he <HI>was culpable</HI> are compared with the <HI>accusations</HI> stated by Mr. Burke, the man must appear to be per∣fectly innocent. The unjustifiable deception of Mr. Burke was, in stating all the facts, as if they had been <HI>proved</HI> and established by evidence.</P></NOTE>, Who were those gentle∣men
<PB N="49" REF="92"/>
men appointed on the commission? A set of juniors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The three gentlemen appointed were <HI>three years senior to Mr. Paterson in the</HI> service; and, as Sir John Shore well observed, <HI>reluctantly</HI> undertook the office imposed upon them, and which it was not in their power to refuse.</NOTE>. They were to enquire into the pro∣ceedings,
<PB N="50" REF="93"/>
and he was to appear like an ac∣cused person, but without authority to make out such a state of defence as he could. In that situation he represented and sent, I be∣lieve, one of the most pathetic memorials that ever was sent to a Council. He was a man of honour and principle, and well de∣served, for his conduct, the honour of suf∣fering all the persecutions in the cause of virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Paterson applied to the Supreme Council for permission to go to Rungpore. This permission the Council, viz. Messrs. Wheler, Macpherson, and Stables, granted; Mr. Hastings being absent, and as utterly unconnected with the business as Mr. Burke himself.</NOTE>. He went back into that country without his commission. The junior ser∣vants that were sent to enquire into the iniquity, into the utter ruin of the country, spent a long time in matters of form; but they found they could not do without a re∣presentative, and Deby Sing was sent down to them. This man was under an accusa∣tion; he was considered as a prisoner, and according to the mild ways of that country, and especially where they chose to be mild, he was not imprisoned in the common goal
<PB N="51" REF="94"/>
at Calcutta; not in the prison of the Fort; not in the goal where Nundcomar was put, when he appeared in Calcutta; he was put under sepoys; he was permitted to go abroad; and Mr. Hastings, with an address which seldom failed him, and never wanting to a man possessing £700,000, managed to con∣vert this guard into a retinue of honour.—They attended him with their side-arms only, and marked him out as a great magistrate, in∣stead of attending upon him as a guard. When he was ordered to send a vaqueel, he refused; upon which the Commissioners, finding they could do without him, instead of saying, if you will not send, you are not to come yourself, al∣lowed him to come. It was not necessary for him to be there, but he comes himself; and enters this place rather as a person arriving from vic∣tory, than as a man under the load of these charges. The complainants saw him a per∣son high in authority in the country. All these marks of respect should have been turned into marks of infamy to this infer∣nal villain, whose conduct, I have had the honour, or rather, I should say, I have been obliged, to mention to your Lordships.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="95"/>Mr. Paterson, seeing the minds of the people broken, subdued, and prostrate under it, and that so far from the means of repre∣senting his duty between the criminal and magistrate, he had not that of defending his own innocence, represented to these Com∣missioners, the junior servants of the Com∣pany, that this appearance, and this immense retinue, tending to strike terror into the minds of the natives, had prevented him from exe∣cuting justice. The Council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, Mr. Wheler, Sir John Macpherson, and Mr. Stables, in the absence of Mr. Hastings.</NOTE> sat upon it, and they found it was true that it would have an evil tendency. On the other hand, they say, for they are very tender, he should appear under a guard; therefore, they take a middle way, and they ordered them to UN∣SKREW their bayonets, and to consider them as troops. The next step they took, was to release Mr. Paterson from all concern in these transactions. One would have thought that it was only right for Deby Sing to be excluded. No, there he sat as a sovereign four years. They enjoyed the office, and
<PB N="53" REF="96"/>
Deby Sing remained in honour, though in something like confinement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This concluding part of Mr. Burke's speech is un∣fortunately but too true; the special Commission of Enquiry was appointed in March 1784. Mr. Hastings, who was then absent, and did not return to Calcutta until November, and left India the first of February following, expressed his surprise that the report had not been made; and moved, that the Commissioners should be peremptorily ordered to make their report in two months. The enquiry was so <HI>minute,</HI> that it was not until February 1787 that they en∣tirely closed all their proceedings; and it was not until the 26th of November 1788, that judgment was pro∣nounced, which Lord Cornwallis justly laments as a great evil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, to bring all this business home to Mr. Hastings. I stated to you, be∣fore that I considered Mr. Hastings as re∣sponsible for the acts of the people he em∣ployed; doubly responsible, if he knew them to be bad. I charge him with putting men of evil characters in situations, in which any evil might be committed. I charge him as Chief Governor with destroying the in∣stitutions of the country; which were, and ought to have been, the check upon this peo∣ple.
<PB N="54" REF="97"/>
I charge him with putting a person called a Steward, or <HI>Dewan</HI> of the province, as a controul on the Farmers General of it; so that no controul should exist; and that he should be let loose to rapine and destruction; for the two offices were both vested in him. It may be asked—Did Mr. Hastings order these cruelties? I answer, No. But if be had kept firm to the duty that the Act of Parliament had appointed, all the revenue regulations must have been made by him. But, instead of that, he appointed Gunga Govind Sing, and placed him in the seat of government. Mr. Hastings is responsible for destroying his own legal capacity; next for destroying the legal capacity of the council; not one of whom could have any knowledge of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is something so very foreign from the actual fact in this statement, that we shall offer a few remarks upon it. It has happened that Sir John Shore arrived in England in time to depose in Westminster-Hall, that the appointment of the Committee of Revenues did <HI>not</HI> tend to deprive the Supreme Council of all knowledge of a revenue; and that it did not tend to throw power into the hands of Mr. Hastings. The public official accounts prove, that considerable advantages resulted to the public, by an actual increase of the revenues, at a time, as Mr. Hastings observed to the Directors, in May 1781,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when the preservation of the Company's in∣terest <HI>in every part of India</HI> depended upon realizing the resources of Bengal."</Q>
Without troubling our readers with confused and perplexed accounts of remis∣sions, settlements, or balances, we shall content our∣selves by taking from the records in Westminster-Hall the actual amount of the net money paid into the Company's treasury from the landed revenues, the three years <HI>preceding,</HI> and the three years <HI>subsequent</HI> to that plan of Mr. Hastings', which is supposed, contrary to truth, and the universal knowledge of mankind, to have involved Bengal in such a scene of distress as no other country ever experienced:

<P>So that this country, so ruined and undone, by the change produced a net addition of 13, 89, 328 Sicca rupees, or £150,000 sterling; and the improved, and improving, state of Bengal, from that time to this, must convince any rational being, that there is no foundation for the many simple stories we have heard of the dis∣tressed state of Bengal; for if Mr. Hastings had violently kept up the revenue for three years by improper or oppressive exactions, those revenues must have fallen off in succeeding years; whereas, in fact, the country has continued progressively improving to the present time.</P></NOTE>. When he had done that, and had
<PB N="55" REF="98"/>
destroyed all power in the country, he had every thing in his own hands; and for all things he is answerable. They could not
<PB N="56" REF="99"/>
possibly have concealed from the public eye such acts as these; the Provincial Councils had removed, but Mr. Hastings destroyed, every charge. Having destroyed every con∣troul, above and below, and delivered the whole country into the hands of Gunga Govind Sing, for all his acts he is respon∣sible. I have read to you, and I hope, and trust, it is fresh in your remembrance, that Deby Sing was presented to Mr. Hastings by Gunga Govind Sing, namely, by that set of servants, as they call themselves, who act as they themselves tell us, and most naturally, as the tools of Govind Sing: and he is fur∣ther responsible, because he took the bribe of Dinagepore, the country that was ravaged in this manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have already stated that <HI>Rungpore,</HI> and not <HI>Di∣nagepore,</HI> was the province in which the insurrection broke out.</NOTE>. We shall prove he took
<PB N="57" REF="100"/>
bribes of some body or other in power of £40,000, through the medium of that per∣son whom he had appointed to exercise all the affairs of the Supreme Council above, and of all the subordinate Council below.—So that you see, he had appointed a Coun∣cil of Tools, at the expence of £62,000 to do all the offices, for the purpose of esta∣blishing a bribe-factor general, a general receiver, and agent of bribes, through all the country, and he is answerable for the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Burke, in his most singular composition, as∣sumes it <HI>as a fact,</HI> that Mr. Hastings had delivered over the whole kingdom of Bengal to Gunga Govind Sing, in whose hands the Committee of Revenue were <HI>tools</HI>; and, therefore, for all <HI>his acts Mr. Hastings is responsible.</HI></P>
<P>But in this letter to the Court of Directors, remon∣strating against the appointment of Sir John Shore to the government of Bengal, he affirms, that he finds Mr. Shore to have been materially concerned <HI>as a prin∣cipal actor and party</HI> in the mal-administration of the Revenue Board; and that against him much criminal matter is, at this moment, at issue before the highest Tribunal in the nation.</P>
<P>Without attempting to reconcile to common sense such absurdities and contradictions, it will be suffi∣cient to observe, that <HI>no one act</HI> of oppression alleged to have been committed by Mr. Hastings, or by Sir John Shore, or by Gunga Govind Sing, has been <HI>proved</HI>; and, let the calculation be made in any possible way, it will be found, that in the three years following the establishment of the Committee of Revenue, the reve∣nues actually <HI>netted</HI> considerably <HI>more</HI> than the revenues <HI>netted</HI> in the three last years of the Provincial Council.</P>
<P>That Mr. Burke most grossly abused the power <HI>delegated</HI> to him by the last Parliament, is <HI>unquestionably true.</HI> He confessed it, when he said, that he <HI>ought not</HI> to be expected, like Shylock, <HI>to cut just the pound of flesh, and no more.</HI> To shew the mans utter <HI>inconsistency upon all subjects,</HI> we insert the following passage from his "Appeal:"</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What can sound with such horrid discordance in the <HI>moral ear,</HI> as this position, that a Delegate, <HI>with limited powers,</HI> may break his engagement to his constituents, <HI>assume an authority never committed to him to alter things at his pleasure;</HI> and then, if he can per∣suade <HI>a large number of men, to flatter him in the power he has usurped,</HI> that he is absolved in his own con∣science, and ought to stand acquitted in the eyes of mankind. On this scheme, the maker of the ex∣periment must begin with <HI>a determined perjury. That point is certain.</HI> He must take his chance for the ex∣piatory addresses. This is to make <HI>the success of villainy</HI> the standard <HI>of innocence.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>It is true, Mr. Burke was not a <HI>sworn delegate</HI>; but no man of honour needs <HI>an oath,</HI> to keep him to the strict line of his duty. He has well defined the functions <HI>of a delegate</HI>; let us examine how he exer∣cised those functions himself.</P>
<P>He was appointed <HI>one of the delegates</HI> of the last House of Commons. His duty was <HI>defined</HI>; namely, to make good <HI>certain articles,</HI> which <HI>that House</HI> had voted. Though the fact be true, that the House had never read by far the greater number of those articles, yet Mr. Burke had an undoubted right to expatiate, as he pleased, on every allegation in those articles, however irregularly or unjustly they were voted. But in mani∣fest contradiction <HI>to his own sense of the moral obligations imposed upon a delegate,</HI> he introduced the episode of Deby Sing; a subject on which <HI>his constituents</HI> had never heard a word, and of course they could give <HI>him</HI> no instructions upon it. Nor was this all; he told his story most unfairly.</P>
<P>He imposed upon his auditors, by stating the facts, as if the <HI>truth</HI> of them was beyond all question, and that, consequently, the only matter for consideration hereafter would be, whether Mr. Hastings and Sir John Shore could be made <HI>responsible</HI> for the facts. Yet Mr. Burke <HI>knew</HI> that the <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>falsehood</HI> of the facts was a subject of a very long and solemn enquiry, the result of which was, as it has <HI>since</HI> appeared, that the facts charged were false in their most material parts. Where the charges were not without foundation, it was proved that they had been very greatly exaggerated.</P></NOTE>.</P>
