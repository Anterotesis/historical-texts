<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Reign of Claudius.—Defeat of the Goths.—Victories, Triumph, and Death, of Aurelian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UNDER the deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the empire was oppressed and almost destroyed by the soldiers, the tyrants, and the barbarians. It was saved by a series of great princes, who derived their obscure origin from the martial provinces of Illyricum. Within a period of about thirty years, Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his colleagues, triumphed over the foreign and domestic enemies of the state, re-established, with the military dis∣cipline, the strength of the frontiers, and deserved the glorious title of Restorers of the Roman world.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16"/>
The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a succession of heroes. The indignation of the people imputed all their calamities to Gallie∣nus, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aureolus invades Italy, is defeated and be∣sieged at Milan.</NOTE> and the far greater part were, indeed, the consequence of his dissolute manners and careless administration. He was even destitute of a sense of honour, which so frequently supplies the ab∣sence of public virtue; and as long as he was permitted to enjoy the possession of Italy, a vic∣tory of the barbarians, the loss of a province, or the rebellion of a general, seldom disturbed the tranquil course of his pleasures. At length, a considerable army, stationed on the Upper Da∣nube, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 268.</NOTE> invested with the Imperial purple their leader Aureolus; who disdaining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of Rhaetia, passed the Alps, occupied Milan, threatened Rome, and challenged Gallienus to dispute in the field the sovereignty of Italy. The emperor, provoked by the insult, and alarmed by the instant danger, suddenly exerted that latent vigour, which some∣times broke through the indolence of his temper. Forcing himself from the luxury of the palace, he appeared in arms at the head of his legions, and advanced beyond the Po to encounter his compe∣titor. The corrupted name of Pontirolo <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pons Aureoli,</HI> thirteen miles from Bergamo, and thirty-two from Milan. See Cluver. Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 245. Near this place, in the year 1703, the obstinate battle of Cassano was fought between the French and Austrians. The excellent relation of the Chevalier de Folard, who was present, gives a very distinct idea of the ground. See Polybe de Folard, tom. iii. p. 223—248.</NOTE> still preserves the memory of a bridge over the Adda, which, during the action, must have proved an
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
object of the utmost importance to both armies. The Rhaetian usurper, after receiving a total de∣feat and a dangerous wound, retired into Milan. The siege of that great city was immediately formed; the walls were battered with every en∣gine in use among the ancients; and Aureolus, doubtful of his internal strength, and hopeless of foreign succours, already anticipated the fatal consequences of unsuccessful rebellion.</P>
<P>His last resource was an attempt to seduce the loyalty of the besiegers. He scattered libels through their camp, inviting the troops to desert an unworthy master, who sacrificed the public happiness to his luxury, and the lives of his most valuable subjects to the slightest suspicions. The arts of Aureolus diffused fears and discontent among the principal officers of his rival. A con∣spiracy was formed by Heraclianus the Praetorian praefect, by Marcian, a general of rank and repu∣tation, and by Cecrops, who commanded a nu∣merous body of Dalmatian guards. The death of Gallienus was resolved; and notwithstanding their desire of first terminating the siege of Milan, the extreme danger which accompanied every moment's delay, obliged them to hasten the exe∣cution of their daring purpose. At a late hour of the night, but while the emperor still protracted the pleasures of the table, an alarm was suddenly given, that Aureolus, at the head of all his forces, had made a desperate sally from the town; Gal∣lienus, who was never deficient in personal bra∣very, started from his silken couch, and, without
<PB N="4" REF="18" MS="y"/>
allowing himself time either to put on his armour or to assemble his guards, he mounted on horse∣back, and rode full speed toward the supposed place of the attack. Encompassed by his declared or concealed enemies, he soon, amidst the noc∣turnal tumult, received a mortal dart from an uncertain hand. Before he expired, a patriotic <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 268. March 20. Death of Gallienus.</NOTE> sentiment rising in the mind of Gallienus, in∣duced him to name a deserving successor, and it was his last request, that the Imperial ornaments should be delivered to Claudius, who then com∣manded a detached army in the neighbourhood of Pavia. The report at least was diligently pro∣pagated, and the order cheerfully obeyed by the conspirators, who had already agreed to place Claudius on the throne. On the first news of the emperor's death, the troops expressed some sus∣picion and resentment, till the one was removed, and the other assuaged, by a donative of twenty pieces of gold to each soldier. They then ra∣tified the election, and acknowledged the merit of their new sovereign <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the death of Gallienus, see Trebellius Pollio in Hist. Au∣gust. p. 181.

<P>The obscurity which covered the origin of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and eleva∣tion of the emperor Claudius.</NOTE> Claudius, though it was afterwards embellished by some flattering fictions <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Some supposed him, oddly enough, to be a bastard of the younger Gordian. Others took advantage of the province of Dar∣dania, to deduce his origin from Dardanus, and the ancient kings of Troy.</NOTE>, sufficiently betrays
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
the meanness of his birth. We can only discover that he was a native of one of the provinces bor∣dering on the Danube; that his youth was spent in arms, and that his modest valour attracted the favour and confidence of Decius. The senate and people already considered him as an excellent officer, equal to the most important trusts; and censured the inattention of Valerian, who suffered him to remain in the subordinate station of a tri∣bune. But it was not long before that emperor distinguished the merit of Claudius, by declaring him general and chief of the Illyrian frontier, with the command of all the troops in Thrace, Maesia, Dacia, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, the ap∣pointments of the praefect of Egypt, the establish∣ment of the proconsul of Africa, and the sure prospect of the consulship. By his victories over the Goths, he deserved from the senate the ho∣nour of a statue, and excited the jealous appre∣hensions of Gallienus. It was impossible that a soldier could esteem so dissolute a sovereign, nor is it easy to conceal a just contempt. Some un∣guarded expressions which dropt from Claudius, were officiously transmitted to the royal ear. The emperor's answer to an officer of confidence, de∣scribes in very lively colours his own character and that of the times. <Q>There is not any thing capable of giving me more serious concern, than the intelligence contained in your last dis∣patch <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Notoria,</HI> a periodical and official dispatch which the Emperors received from the <HI>frumentarii,</HI> or agents dispersed through the pro∣vinces. Of these we may speak hereafter.</NOTE>: that some malicious suggestions have

indisposed towards us the mind of our friend and <HI>parent</HI> Claudius. As you regard your al∣legiance, use every means to appease his re∣sentment, but conduct your negociation with secrecy; let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops; they are already provoked, and it might inflame their fury. I myself have sent him some presents: be it your care that he accept them with pleasure. Above all, let him not suspect that I am made acquainted with his imprudence. The fear of my anger might urge him to desperate counsels <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 208. Gallienus describes the plate, vestments, &amp;c. like a man who loved and understood those splendid trifles.</NOTE>.</Q> The presents which accompanied this humble epistle, in which the monarch solicited a reconciliation with his discontented subject, consisted of a con∣siderable sum of money, a splendid wardrobe, and a valuable service of silver and gold plate. By such arts Gallienus softened the indignation, and dispelled the fears, of his Illyrian general; and, during the remainder of that reign, the for∣midable sword of Claudius was always drawn in the cause of a master whom he despised. At last, indeed, he received from the conspirators the bloody purple of Gallienus: but he had been ab∣sent from their camp and counsels; and however he might applaud the deed, we may candidly presume that he was innocent of the knowledge of it <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Julian (Orat. i. p. 6.) affirms that Claudius acquired the em∣pire in a just and even holy manner. But we may distrust the par∣tiality of a kinsman.</NOTE>. When Claudius ascended the throne, he was about fifty-four years of age.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21"/>
The siege of Milan was still continued, and Aureolus soon discovered, that the success of his artifices had only raised up a more determined <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Aureolus.</NOTE> adversary. He attempted to negociate with Clau∣dius a treaty of alliance and partition. <Q>Tell him, replied the intrepid emperor, that such proposals should have been made to Gal∣lienus; <HI>he,</HI> perhaps, might have listened to them with patience, and accepted a colleague as despicable as himself <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 203. There are some trifling differences con∣cerning the circumstances of the last defeat and death of Aureolus.</NOTE>.</Q> This stern refusal, and a last unsuccessful effort, obliged Aureolus to yield the city and himself to the discretion of the conqueror. The judgment of the army pro∣nounced him worthy of death, and Claudius, after a feeble resistance, consented to the execution of the sentence. Nor was the zeal of the senate less ardent in the cause of their new sovereign. They ratified, perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal, the election of Claudius; and as his predecessor had shewn himself the personal enemy of their order, they exercised under the name of justice a severe revenge against his friends and family. The senate was permitted to discharge the un∣grateful office of punishment, and the emperor reserved for himself the pleasure and merit of ob∣taining by his intercession a general act of indem∣nity <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people loudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. The senate decreed that his relations and servants should be thrown down headlong from the Gemonian stairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had his eyes torn out whilst under examination.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="22"/>
Such ostentatious clemency discovers less of the real character of Claudius, than a trifling circum∣stance in which he seems to have consulted only <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clemency and justice of Clau∣dius.</NOTE> the dictates of his heart. The frequent rebel∣lions of the provinces had involved almost every person in the guilt of treason, almost every estate in the case of confiscation; and Gallienus often displayed his liberality, by distributing among his officers the property of his subjects. On the ac∣cession of Claudius, an old woman threw herself at his feet, and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony. This general was Claudius him∣self, who had not entirely escaped the contagion of the times. The emperor blushed at the re∣proach, but deserved the confidence which she had reposed in his equity. The confession of his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample restitution <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the arduous task which Claudius had under∣taken, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He under∣takes the reforma∣tion of the army.</NOTE> of restoring the empire to its ancient splen∣dour, it was first necessary to revive among his troops a sense of order and obedience. With the authority of a veteran commander, he represented to them, that the relaxation of discipline had in∣troduced a long train of disorders, the effects of which were at length experienced by the soldiers themselves; that a people ruined by oppression, and indolent from despair, could no longer sup∣ply a numerous army with the means of luxury, or even of subsistence; that the danger of each individual had increased with the despotism of the
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
military order, since princes who tremble on the throne, will guard their safety by the instant sa∣crifice of every obnoxious subject. The emperor expatiated on the mischiefs of a lawless caprice which the soldiers could only gratify at the ex∣pence of their own blood; as their seditious elec∣tions had so frequently been followed by civil wars, which consumed the flower of the legions either in the field of battle or in the cruel abuse of victory. He painted in the most lively colours the exhausted state of the treasury, the desolation of the provinces, the disgrace of the Roman name, and the insolent triumph of rapacious bar∣barians. It was against those barbarians, he de∣clared, that he intended to point the first effort of their arms. Tetricus might reign for a while over the West, and even Zenobia might preserve the dominion of the East <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Zonaras on this occasion mentions Posthumus; but the regis∣ters of the senate (Hist. August. p. 203.) prove that Tetricus was already emperor of the western provinces.</NOTE>. These usurpers were his personal adversaries; nor could he think of indulging any private resentment till he had saved an empire, whose impending ruin would, unless it was timely prevented, crush both the army and the people.</P>
<P>The various nations of Germany and Sarmatia, who fought under the Gothic standard, had al∣ready <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 269. The Goths invade the empire.</NOTE> collected an armament more formidable than any which had yet issued from the Euxine. On the banks of the Niester, one of the great rivers that discharge themselves into that sea, they constructed a fleet of two thousand, or even
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
of six thousand vessels <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">The Augustan History mentions the smaller, Zonaras the larger, number; the lively fancy of Montesquieu induced him to prefer the latter.</NOTE>; numbers which, how∣ever incredible they may seem, would have been insufficient to transport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty thousand barbarians. Whatever might be the real strength of the Goths, the vigour and success of the expedition were not adequate to the greatness of the preparations. In their passage through the Bosphorus, the un∣skilful pilots were overpowered by the violence of the current; and while the multitude of their ships were crowded in a narrow channel, many were dashed against each other, or against the shore. The barbarians made several descents on the coasts both of Europe and Asia; but the open country was already plundered, and they were repulsed with shame and loss from the fortified cities which they assaulted. A spirit of discou∣ragement and division arose in the fleet, and some of their chiefs sailed away towards the islands of Crete and Cyprus; but the main body pursuing a more steady course, anchored at length near the foot of mount Athos, and assaulted the city of Thessalonica, the wealthy capital of all the Ma∣cedonian provinces. Their attacks, in which they displayed a fierce but artless bravery, were soon interrupted by the rapid approach of Clau∣dius, hastening to a scene of action that deserved the presence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire. Impatient for battle, the Goths immediately broke up their
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>
camp, relinquished the siege of Thessalonica, left their navy at the foot of mount Athos, traversed the hills of Macedonia, and pressed forwards to engage the last defence of Italy.</P>
<P>We still possess an original letter addressed by Claudius to the senate and people on this memo∣rable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress and firm∣ness of Claudius.</NOTE> occasion. <Q>Conscript fathers, says the emperor, know that three hundred and twenty thousand Goths have invaded the Roman ter∣ritory. If I vanquish them, your gratitude will reward my services. Should I fall, re∣member that I am the successor of Gallienus. The whole republic is fatigued and exhausted. We shall fight after Valerian, after Ingenuus, Regillianus, Lollianus, Posthumus, Celsus, and a thousand others, whom a just contempt for Gallienus provoked into rebellion. We are in want of darts, of spears, and of shields. The strength of the empire, Gaul, and Spain, are usurped by Tetricus, and we blush to ac∣knowledge that the archers of the East serve under the banners of Zenobia. Whatever we shall perform, will be sufficiently great <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Trebell. Pollio in Hist. August. p. 204.</NOTE>.</Q> The melancholy firmness of this epistle announces a hero careless of his fate, conscious of his dan∣ger, but still deriving a well-grounded hope from the resources of his own mind.</P>
<P>The event surpassed his own expectations and those of the world. By the most signal victories <NOTE PLACE="marg">His victory over the Goths.</NOTE> he delivered the empire from this host of barba∣rians, and was distinguished by posterity under

Zonaras, l. xii. p. 638. Aurel. Victor in Epitom. Victor Junior in Caesar. Eutrop. ix. 11. Euseb. in Chron.</NOTE> do not enable us to describe the order and circum∣stances of his exploits; but, if we could be in∣dulged in the allusion, we might distribute into three acts this memorable tragedy. I. The de∣cisive battle was fought near Naissus, a city of Dardania. The legions at first gave way, op∣pressed by numbers, and dismayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was inevitable, had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief. A large detachment rising out of the secret and dif∣ficult passes of the mountains, which, by his or∣der, they had occupied, suddenly assailed the rear of the victorious Goths. The favorable instant was improved by the activity of Claudius. He revived the courage of his troops, restored their ranks, and pressed the barbarians on every side. Fifty thousand men are reported to have been slain in the battle of Naissus. Several large bodies of barbarians, covering their retreat with a moveable fortification of waggons, retired, or rather escaped, from the field of slaughter. II. We may presume that some insurmountable diffi∣culty, the fatigue, perhaps, or the disobedience, of the conquerors, prevented Claudius from com∣pleting in one day the destruction of the Goths. The war was diffused over the provinces of Maesia, Thrace, and Macedonia, and its opera∣tions drawn out into a variety of marches, sur∣prises,
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
and tumultuary engagements, as well by sea as by land. When the Romans suffered any loss, it was commonly occasioned by their own cowardice or rashness; but the superior talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the coun∣try, and his judicious choice of measures as well as officers, assured on most occasions the success of his arms. The immense booty, the fruit of so many victories, consisted for the greater part of cattle and slaves. A select body of the Gothic youth was received among the Imperial troops; the remainder was sold into servitude; and so considerable was the number of female captives, that every soldier obtained to his share two or three women. A circumstance from which we may conclude, that the invaders entertained some designs of settlement as well as of plunder; since even in a naval expedition they were accompanied by their families. III. The loss of their fleet, which was either taken or sunk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A vast circle of Ro∣man posts distributed with skill, supported with firmness, and gradually closing towards a com∣mon centre, forced the barbarians into the most inaccessible parts of mount Haemus, where they found a safe refuge, but a very scanty subsistence. During the course of a rigorous winter, in which they were besieged by the emperor's troops, fa∣mine and pestilence, desertion and the sword, continually diminished the imprisoned multitude. On the return of spring, nothing appeared in <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 270.</NOTE> arms except a hardy and desperate band, the
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the mouth of the Niester.</P>
<P>The pestilence which swept away such num∣bers of the barbarians, at length proved fatal to <NOTE PLACE="marg">March. Death of the empe∣ror, who recom∣mends Aurelian for his successor.</NOTE> their conqueror. After a short but glorious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidst the tears and acclamations of his subjects. In his last illness, he convened the principal officers of the state and army, and in their presence recom∣mended Aurelian, one of his generals, as the most deserving of the throne, and the best qua∣lified to execute the great design which he himself had been permitted only to undertake. The virtues of Claudius, his valour, affability <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">According to Zonaras (l. xii. p. 638.), Claudius, before his death, invested him with the purple; but this singular fact is rather contradicted than confirmed by other writers.</NOTE>, jus∣tice, and temperance, his love of fame and of his country, place him in that short list of emperors who added lustre to the Roman purple. Those virtues, however, were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age of Constantine, who was the great grand∣son of Crispus, the elder brother of Claudius. The voice of flattery was soon taught to repeat, that the gods, who so hastily had snatched Clau∣dius from the earth, rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual establishment of the empire in his family <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">See the life of Claudius by Pollio, and the orations of Ma∣mertinus, Eumenius, and Julian. See likewise the Caesars of Ju∣lian, p. 313. In Julian it was not adulation, but superstition and vanity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="29"/>
Notwithstanding these oracles, the greatness of the Flavian family (a name which it had pleas∣ed them to assume) was deferred above twenty <NOTE PLACE="marg">The at∣tempt and fall of Quintilius.</NOTE> years, and the elevation of Claudius occasioned the immediate ruin of his brother Quintilius, who possessed not sufficient moderation or courage to descend into the private station to which the patriotism of the late emperor had condemned him. Without delay or reflection, he assumed the purple at Aquileia, where he commanded a considerable force; and though his reign lasted only seventeen days, he had time to obtain the sanction of the senate, and to experience a mu∣tiny of the troops. As soon as he was informed that the great army of the Danube had invested the well-known valour of Aurelian with Imperial power, he sunk under the fame and merit of his rival; and ordering his veins to be opened, pru∣dently <NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> withdrew himself from the unequal con∣test <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. i. p. 42.

<P>The general design of this work will not per∣mit us minutely to relate the actions of every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin and services of Aurelian.</NOTE> emperor after he ascended the throne, much less to deduce the various fortunes of his private life. We shall only observe, that the father of Aure∣lian was a peasant of the territory of Sirmium, who occupied a small farm, the property of Au∣relius, a rich senator. His warlike son inlisted in the troops as a common soldier, successively
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
rose to the rank of a centurion, a tribune, the praefect of a legion, the inspector of the camp, the general, or, as it was then called, the duke, of a frontier; and at length, during the Gothic war, exercised the important office of commander in chief of the cavalry. In every station he dis∣tinguished himself by matchless valour <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Theoclius (as quoted in the Augustan History, p. 211.) affirms, that in one day he killed, with his own hand, forty-eight Sarma∣tians, and in several subsequent engagements nine hundred and fifty. This heroic valour was admired by the soldiers, and celebrated in their rude songs, the burden of which was <HI>mille, mille, mille occidit.</HI></NOTE>, rigid discipline, and successful conduct. He was in∣vested with the consulship by the emperor Vale∣rian, who styles him, in the pompous language of that age, the deliverer of Illyricum, the re∣storer of Gaul, and the rival of the Scipios. At the recommendation of Valerian, a senator of the highest rank and merit, Ulpius Crinitus, whose blood was derived from the same source as that of Trajan, adopted the Pannonian peasant, gave him his daughter in marriage, and relieved with his ample fortune the honourable poverty which Aurelian had preserved inviolate <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Acholius (ap. Hist. August. p. 213.) describes the ceremony of the adoption, as it was performed at Byzantium, in the presence of the emperor and his great officers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The reign of Aurelian lasted only four years <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurelian's successful reign.</NOTE> and about nine months; but every instant of that short period was filled by some memorable at∣chievement. He put an end to the Gothic war, chastised the Germans who invaded Italy, reco∣vered Gaul, Spain, and Britain out of the hands of Tetricus, and destroyed the proud monarchy
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
which Zenobia had erected in the East, on the ruins of the afflicted empire.</P>
<P>It was the rigid attention of Aurelian, even to the minutest articles of discipline, which be∣stowed <NOTE PLACE="marg">His severe discipline.</NOTE> such uninterrupted success on his arms. His military regulations are contained in a very concise epistle to one of his inferior officers, who is commanded to enforce them, as he wishes to become a tribune, or as he is desirous to live. Gaming, drinking, and the arts of divination, were severely prohibited. Aurelian expected that his soldiers should be modest, frugal, and labo∣rious; that their armour should be constantly kept bright, their weapons sharp, their clothing and horses ready for immediate service; that they should live in their quarters with chastity and so∣briety, without damaging the corn fields, with∣out stealing even a sheep, a fowl, or a bunch of grapes, without exacting from their landlords, either salt, or oil, or wood. <Q>The public al∣lowance, continues the emperor, is suffi∣cient for their support; their wealth should be collected from the spoil of the enemy, not from the tears of the provincials <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 211. This laconic epistle is truly the work of a soldier; it abounds with military phrases and words, some of which cannot be understood without difficulty. <HI>Ferramenta samiata</HI> is well explained by Salmasius. The former of the words means all weapons of offence, [and is contrasted with <HI>Arma,</HI> defensive ar∣mour. The latter signifies keen and well sharpened.</NOTE>.</Q> A single instance will serve to display the rigour, and even cruelty, of Aurelian. One of the soldiers had seduced the wife of his host. The guilty wretch
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
was fastened to two trees forcibly drawn towards each other, and his limbs were torn asunder by their sudden separation. A few such examples impressed a salutary consternation. The punish∣ments of Aurelian were terrible; but he had sel∣dom occasion to punish more than once the same offence. His own conduct gave a sanction to his laws, and the seditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned to obey, and who was worthy to command.</P>
<P>The death of Claudius had revived the faint∣ing spirit of the Goths. The troops which guarded the passes of Mount Haemus, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He con∣cludes a treaty with the Goths,</NOTE> banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehension of a civil war; and it seems probable that the remaining body of the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favourable op∣portunity, abandoned their settlements of the Ukraine, traversed the rivers, and swelled with new multitudes the destroying host of their coun∣trymen. Their united numbers were at length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful conflict ended only with the approach of night <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. i. p. 45.</NOTE>. Exhausted by so many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted during a twenty years war, the Goths and the Romans consented to a lasting and beneficial treaty. It was earnestly solicited by the barba∣rians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to whose suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the decision of that important question. The
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
Gothic nation engaged to supply the armies of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries, consisting entirely of cavalry, and stipulated in return an undisturbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube, provided by the emperor's care, but at their own expence. The treaty was observed with such religious fidelity, that when a party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of pluner, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts, as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements. It is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who had exacted as hostages the sons and daugh∣ters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed something to this pacific temper. The youths he trained in the exercise of arms, and near his own person: to the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman edu∣cation, and by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers, gradually intro∣duced between the two nations the closest and most endearing connexions <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Dexippus (ap.

convinced him of the solid advantages, and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace, of thus con∣tracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian subjects, removed from those distant pos∣sessions which they were unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to the southern side of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was yielded to their in∣dustry, and a new province of Dacia still pre∣served the memory of Trajan's conquests. The old country of that name detained, however, a considerable number of its inhabitants, who dreaded exile more than a Gothic master <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">The Walachians still preserve many traces of the Latin lan∣guage, and have boasted, in every age, of their Roman descent.

These degenerate Romans continued to serve the empire, whose allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their conquerors the first no∣tions of agriculture, the useful arts, and the con∣veniences of civilised life. An intercourse of commerce and language was gradually established between the opposite banks of the Danube; and after Dacia became an independent state, it often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the invasions of the savages of the North. A sense of interest attached these more settled bar∣barians to the alliance of Rome, and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and useful friendship. This various colony, which
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
filled the ancient province, and was insensibly blended into one great people, still acknowledg∣ed the superior renown and authority of the Go∣thic tribe, and claimed the fancied honour of a Scandinavian origin. At the same time the lucky though accidental resemblance of the name of Gaeta, infused among the credulous Goths a vain persuation, that, in a remote age, their own ancestors, already seated in the Dacian provinces, had received the instructions of Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Sesostis and Darius <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">See the first chapter of Jornandes.

<P>The emperor was almost at the same time <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 270. September.</NOTE> informed of the irruption, and of the retreat, of the barbarians. Collecting an active body of troops, he marched with silence and celerity along the skirts of the Hercynian forest; and the Alemanni, laden with the spoils of Italy, arrived at the Danube, without suspecting, that on the opposite bank, and in an advantageous post, a Roman army lay concealed and prepared to in∣tercept their return. Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians, and permitted about half their forces to pass the river without disturb∣ance and without precaution. Their situation and astonishment gave him an easy victory; his skilful conduct improved the advantage. Dis∣posing the legions in a semicircular form, he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the Danube, and wheeling them on a sudden towards the centre, inclosed the rear of the Ger∣man host. The dismayed barbarians, on what∣soever side they cast their eyes, beheld with de∣spair, a wasted country, a deep and rapid stream, a victorious and implacable enemy.</P>
<P>Reduced to this distressed condition, the Ale∣manni no longer disdained to sue for peace. Aurelian received their ambassadors at the head of his camp, and with every circumstance of

martial pomp that could display the greatness and discipline of Rome. The legions stood to their arms in well-ordered ranks and awful silence. The principal commanders, distinguish∣ed by the ensigns of their rank, appeared on horse∣back on either side of the Imperial throne. Behind the throne, the consecrated images of the emperor, and his predecessors <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">The emperor Claudius was certainly of the number; but we are ignorant how far this mark of respect was extended; if to Cae∣sar and Augustus, it must have produced a very awful spectacle; a long line of the masters of the world.</NOTE>, the golden eagles, and the various titles of the legions, engraved in letters of gold, were exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver. When Aurelian assumed his seat, his manly grace and majestic figure <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 210.</NOTE> taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple of their con∣queror. The ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground in silence. They were commanded to rise, and permitted to speak. By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy, magnified their exploits, expatiated on the vicis∣situdes of fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed confidence, demanded a large subsidy, as the price of the alliance which they offered to the Romans. The answer of the emperor was stern and imperious. He treated their offer with contempt, and their demand with indignation, reproached the barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of the laws of peace, and finally dismissed them with the choice only of submitting to his un∣conditioned

Aurelian had resign∣ed a distant province to the Goths; but it was dangerous to trust or to pardon these perfidious barbarians, whose formidable power kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms.</P>
<P>Immediately after this conference, it should <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ale∣manni in∣vade Italy,</NOTE> seem that some unexpected emergency required the emperor's presence in Pannonia. He de∣volved on his lieutenants the care of finishing the destruction of the Alemanni, either by the sword, or by the surer operation of famine. But an active despair has often triumphed over the indolent assurance of success. The bar∣barians, finding it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman camp, broke through the posts in their rear, which were more feebly or less carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a different road, returned to∣wards the mountains of Italy <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 215.</NOTE>. Aurelian, who considered the war as totally extinguished, received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the Allemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed in the territory of Milan. The le∣gions were commanded to follow, with as much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting, the rapid flight of an enemy, whose infantry and cavalry moved with almost equal swiftness. A few days afterwards the emperor himself marched to the relief of Italy, at the
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
head of a chosen body of auxiliaries (among whom were the hostages and cavalry of the Van∣dals), and of all the Praetorian guards who had served in the wars on the Danube <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Dexippus, p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread <NOTE PLACE="marg">and are at last van∣quished by Aurelian.</NOTE> themselves from the Alps to the Apennine, the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and his officers was exercised in the discovery, the attack, and the pursuit of the numerous detachments. Not∣withstanding this desultory war, three consider∣able battles are mentioned, in which the prin∣cipal force of both armies was obstinately en∣gaged <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Victor Junior, in Aurelian.</NOTE>. The success was various. In the first, fought near Placentia, the Romans received so severe a blow, that, according to the expression of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the immediate dissolution of the empire was appre∣hended <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 216.</NOTE>. The crafty barbarians, who had lin∣ed the woods, suddenly attacked the legions in the dusk of the evening, and, it is most pro∣bable, after the fatigue and disorder of a long march. The fury of their charge was irresistible; but at length, after a dreadful slaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied his troops, and restored, in some degree, the honour of his arms. The second battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the spot which, five hundred years before, had been fatal to the brother of Hannibal <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">The little river or rather torrent of Metaurus near Fano, has been immortalized, by finding such an historian as Livy, and such a poet as Horace.</NOTE>. Thus far the successful Germans
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
had advanced along the Aemilian and Flaminian way, with a design of sacking the defenceless mistress of the world. But Aurelian, who, watchful for the safety of Rome, still hung on their rear, found in this place the decisive mo∣ment, of giving them a total and irretrievable defeat <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">It is recorded by an inscription found at Pezaro. See Gruter. cclxxvi. 3.</NOTE>. The flying remnant of their host was exterminated in a third and last battle near Pavia; and Italy was delivered from the inroads of the Alemanni.</P>
<P>Fear has been the original parent of super∣stition, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Supersti∣tious cere∣monies.</NOTE> and every new calamity urges trembling mortals to deprecate the wrath of their invisible enemies. Though the best hope of the republic was in the valour and conduct of Aurelian, yet such was the public consternation, when the bar∣barians were hourly expected at the gates of Rome, that, by a decree of the senate, the Sibylline books were consulted. Even the emperor him∣self, from a motive either of religion or of po∣licy, recommended this salutary measure, chided the tardiness of the senate <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">One should imagine, he said, that you were assembled in a Christian church, not in the temple of all the gods.</NOTE>, and offered to sup∣ply whatever expence, whatever animals, what∣ever captives of any nation, the gods should require. Notwithstanding this liberal offer, it does not appear, that any human victims expiat∣ed with their blood the sins of the Roman peo∣ple. The Sibylline books enjoined ceremonies of a more harmless nature, processions of priests <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 271. January 11.</NOTE>
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
in white robes, attended by a chorus of youths and virgins; lustrations of the city and adjacent country; and sacrifices, whose powerful influ∣ence disabled the barbarians from passing the mystic ground on which they had been celebrat∣ed. However puerile in themselves, these super∣stitious arts were subservient to the success of the war; and if, in the decisive battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they saw an army of spectres combating on the side of Aurelian, he received a real and effectual aid from this imaginary rein∣forcement <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 215, 216. gives a long account of these ceremonies, from the Registers of the senate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But whatever confidence might be placed in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortifica∣tions of Rome.</NOTE> ideal ramparts, the experience of the past, and the dread of the future, induced the Romans to construct fortifications of a grosser and more sub∣stantial kind. The seven hills of Rome had been surrounded, by the successors of Romulus, with an ancient wall of more than thirteen miles <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Natur. iii. 5. To confirm our idea, we may ob∣serve, that for a long time Mount Caelius was a grove of oaks, and Mount Viminal was over-run with osiers; that, in the fourth cen∣tury, the Aventine was a vacant and solitary eetirement; that, till the time of Augustus, the Esquiline was an unwholesome burying∣ground; and that the numerous inequalities, remarked by the an∣cients in the Quirinal, sufficiently prove that it was not covered with buildings. Of the seven hills, the Capitoline and Palatine only, with the adjacent vallies, were the primitive habitation of the Roman people. But this subject would require a dissertation.</NOTE>. The vast inclosure may seem dispro∣portioned to the strength and numbers of the infant state. But it was necessary to secure an

ample extent of pasture and arable land, against the frequent and sudden incursions of the tribes of Latium, the perpetual enemies of the repub∣lic. With the progress of Roman greatness, the city and its inhabitants gradually increased, filled up the vacant space, pierced through the useless walls, covered the field of Mars, and, on every side, followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Exspatiantia tecta multas addidere urbes, is the expression of Pliny.</NOTE>.

of the North. To chastise domestic tyrants, and to reunite the dismembered parts of the empire, was a task reserved for the second of those warlike emperors. Though he was ac∣knowledged by the senate and people, the fron∣tiers of Italy, Africa, Illyricum, and Thrace, confined the limits of his reign. Gaul, Spain, and Britain, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, were still possessed by two rebels, who alone, out of so numerous a list, had hitherto escaped the dangers of their situation; and to complete the ignominy of Rome, these rival thrones had been usurped by women.</P>
<P>A rapid succession of monarchs had arisen and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Succession of usurp∣ers in Gaul.</NOTE> fallen in the provinces of Gaul. The rigid vir∣tues of Posthumus served only to hasten his destruction.

He was slain at Cologne, by a conspiracy of jealous hus∣bands, whose revenge would have appeared more justifiable, had they spared the innocence of his son. After the murder of so many valiant princes, it is somewhat remarkable, that a female for a long time controlled the fierce legions of Gaul, and still more singular, that she was the mother of the unfortunate Victorinus. The arts and treasures of Victoria enabled her successively to place Marius and Tetricus on the throne, and to reign with a manly vigour under the name of those dependent emperors. Money of copper, of silver, and of gold, was coined in her name; she assumed the titles of Augusta and Mother of the Camps: her power ended only with her life; but her life was perhaps shortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Pollio assigns her an article among the thirty tyrants.

<P>When, at the instigation of his ambitious pa∣troness, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The reign and defeat of Tetri∣cus.</NOTE> Tetricus assumed the ensigns of royalty, he was governor of the peaceful province of Aquitaine, an employment suited to his charac∣ter and education. He reigned four or five years over Gaul, Spain, and Britain, the slave and sovereign of a licentious army, whom he dreaded, and by whom he was despised. The valour and fortune of Aurelian at length opened
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>
the prospect of a deliverance. He ventured to disclose his melancholy situation, and conjured the emperor to hasten to the relief of his unhappy <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 271. Summer.</NOTE> rival. Had this secret correspondence reached the ears of the soldiers, it would most probably have cost Tetricus his life; nor could he resign the sceptre of the West, without committing an act of treason against himself. He affected the appearances of a civil war, led his forces into the field against Aurelian, posted them in the most disadvantageous manner, betrayed his own coun∣sels to the enemy, and with a few chosen friends deserted in the beginning of the action. The rebel legions, though disordered and dismayed by the unexpected treachery of their chief, de∣fended themselves with desperate valour, till they were cut in pieces almost to a man, in this bloody and memorable battle, which was fought near Chalons in Champagne <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Pollio in Hist.

<P>As early as the reign of Claudius, the city of Autun, alone and unassisted, had ventured to declare against the legions of Gaul.

She was of a dark complexion (for in speaking of a lady, these trifles become important). Her teeth were of a pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon fire, tempered by the most attractive sweetness. Her voice was strong and harmonious. Her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study. She was not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but possessed in equal perfection the Greek, the Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn up for her own use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly compared the beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the sublime Longi∣nus.</P>
<P>This accomplished woman gave her hand to <NOTE PLACE="marg">her valour.</NOTE> Odenathus, who from a private station raised himself to the dominion of the East. She soon became the friend and companion of a hero. In the intervals of war, Odenathus passionately delighted in the exercise of hunting; he pursued with ardour the wild beasts of the desert, lions, panthers, and bears; and the ardour of Zenobia in that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own. She had inured her constitution to fatigue, disdained the use of a covered carriage,
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>
generally appeared on horseback in a military habit, and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the troops. The success of Odenathus was in a great measure ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude. Their splendid victories over the Great King, whom they twice pursued as far as the gates of Ctesi∣phon, laid the foundations of their united fame and power. The armies which they commanded, and the provinces which they had saved, acknow∣ledged not any other sovereigns than their invin∣cible chiefs. The senate and people of Rome revered a stranger who had avenged their captive emperor, and even the insensible son of Valerian accepted Odenathus for his legitimate colleague.</P>
<P>After a successful expedition against the Gothic <NOTE PLACE="marg">She re∣venges her husband's death,</NOTE> plunderers of Asia, the Palmyrenian prince re∣turned to the city of Emesa in Syria.

was remembered; and Maeonius, with a few daring associates, assassinated his uncle in the midst of a great entertainment. Herod, the son <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<P>With the assistance of his most faithful friends, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and reigns over the East and Egypt.</NOTE> she immediately filled the vacant throne, and governed with manly counsels Palmyra, Syria, and the East, above five years. By the death of Odenathus, that authority was at an end which the senate had granted him only as a personal distinction; but his martial widow, disdaining both the senate and Gallienus, obliged one of the Roman generals, who was sent against her, to retreat into Europe, with the loss of his army and his reputation <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 180, 181.</NOTE>. Instead of the little pas∣sions which so frequently perplex a female reign, the steady administration of Zenobia was guided by the most judicious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon, she could calm her resentment: if it was necessary to punish, she could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her strict oeconomy was accused of avarice; yet on
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>
every proper occasion she appeared magnificent and liberal. The neighbouring states of Arabia, Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of her ancestors, the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt. The emperor Clau∣dius acknowledged her merit, and was content, that, while <HI>he</HI> pursued the Gothic war, <HI>she</HI> should assert the dignity of the empire in the East <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">See in Hist.

The conduct, however, of Zenobia, was attend∣ed with some ambiguity; nor is it unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an in∣dependent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts of Asia, and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to the successors of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Timolaus, Herennianus, and Vaballathus. It is supposed that the two former were already dead before the war.

every circumstance, that we can scarcely distin∣guish them from each other, except by observing that the first was fought near Antioch <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">At a place called Immae. Eutropius, Sextus Rufus, and Je∣rome, mention only this first battle.</NOTE>, and the second near Emesa <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 217. mentions only the second.</NOTE>. In both, the queen of Palmyra animated the armies by her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdas, who had already signalized his military talents by the conquest of Egypt. The nume∣rous forces of Zenobia consisted for the most part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They fled in real or affected disorder, engaged the Palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit, harassed them by a desul∣tory combat, and at length discomfited this im∣penetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry. The light infantry, in the mean time, when they had exhausted their quivers, remaining without pro∣tection against a closer onset, exposed their naked sides to the swords of the legions. Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops, who were usu∣ally stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose valour had been severely tried in the Alemannic war <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. i. p. 44—48. His account of the two battles is clear and circumstantial.</NOTE>. After the defeat of Emesa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army. As far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations sub∣ject to her empire had joined the standard of the
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
conqueror, who detached Probus, the bravest of his generals, to possess himself of the Egyp∣tian provinces. Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of Odenathus. She retired within the walls of her capital, made every preparation for a vigorous resistance, and declared with the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last moment of her reign and of her life should be the same.</P>
<P>Amid the barren deserts of Arabia, a few cul∣tivated <NOTE PLACE="marg">The state of Palmy∣ra.</NOTE> spots rise like islands out of the sandy ocean. Even the name of Tadmor, or Palmyra, by its signification in the Syriac as well as in the Latin language, denoted the multitude of palm trees which afforded shade and verdure to that temperate region. The air was pure, and the soil, watered by some invaluable springs, was capable of producing fruits as well as corn. A place possessed of such singular advantages, and situated at a convenient distance <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">It was five hundred and thirty-seven miles from Seleucia, and two hundred and three from the nearest coast of Syria, according to the reckoning of Pliny, who, in a few words (Hist.

Rome, and flourished more than one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate though honour∣able rank of a colony. It was during that peace∣ful period, if we may judge from a few remain∣ing inscriptions, that the wealthy Palmyrenians constructed those temples, palaces, and porticos of Grecian architecture, whose ruins, scattered over an extent of several miles, have deserved the curiosity of our travellers. The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to reflect new splendour on their country, and Palmyra, for a while, stood forth the rival of Rome: but the competition was fatal, and ages of prosperity were sacrificed to a moment of glory <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Some English travellers from Aleppo <HI>discovered</HI> the ruins of Palmyra, about the end of the last century. Our curiosity has since been gratified in a more splendid manner by Messieurs Wood and Dawkins.

<P>In his march over the sandy desert between <NOTE PLACE="marg">It is be∣sieged by Aurelian,</NOTE> Emesa and Palmyra, the emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs; nor could he always defend his army, and especially his bag∣gage, from those flying troops, of active and daring robbers, who watched the moment of surprise, and eluded the slow pursuit of the le∣gions. The siege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and important, and the emperor, who, with incessant vigour, pressed the attacks in person, was himself wounded with a dart. <Q>The Roman people, says Aurelian, in an original letter, speak with contempt of the
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
war which I am waging against a woman. They are ignorant both of the character and of the power of Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations, of stones, of arrows, and of every species of missile wea∣pons. Every part of the walls is provided with two or three <HI>balistae,</HI> and artificial fires are thrown from her military engines. The fear of punishment has armed her with a des∣perate courage. Yet still I trust in the pro∣tecting deities of Rome, who have hitherto been favourable to all my undertakings <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 218.</NOTE>.</Q> Doubtful, however, of the protection of the gods, and of the event of the siege, Aurelian judged it more prudent to offer terms of an ad∣vantageous capitulation; to the queen, a splen∣did retreat; to the citizens, their ancient privi∣leges. His proposals were obstinately rejected, and the refusal was accompanied with insult.</P>
<P>The firmness of Zenobia was supported by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">who be∣comes master of Zenobia and of the city.</NOTE> hope, that in a very short time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the desert; and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the East, and particularly the Persian monarch, would arm in the defence of their most natural ally. But fortune and the perseverance of Aure∣lian overcame every obstacle. The death of Sapor, which happened about this time <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">From a very doubtful chronology I have endeavoured to extract the most probable date.</NOTE>, dis∣tracted the councils of Persia, and the incon∣siderable succours that attempted to relieve Pal∣myra,

were easily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor. From every part of Syria, a regular succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp, which was increased by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from the conquest of Egypt. It was then that Zenobia resolved to fly. She mounted the fleet∣est of her dromedaries <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 218. Zosimus, l. i. p. 50. Though the camel is a heavy beast of burden, the dromedary, who is either of the same or of a kindred species, is used by the natives of Asia and Africa on all occasions which require celerity. The Arabs affirm, that he will run over as much ground in one day, as their fleetest horses can perform in eight or ten. See Buffon Hist. Naturelle, tom. xi. p. 222, and Shaw's Travels, p. 167.</NOTE>, and had already reach∣ed the banks of the Euphrates, about sixty miles from Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian's light horse, seized, and brought back a captive to the feet of the em∣peror. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 273.</NOTE> Her capital soon afterwards surrendered, and was treated with unexpected lenity. The arms, horses, and camels, with an immense treasure of gold, silver, silk, and precious stones, were all delivered to the conqueror, who leaving only a garrison of six hundred archers, returned to Emesa, and employed some time in the distri∣bution of rewards and punishments at the end of so memorable a war, which restored to the obe∣dience of Rome those provinces that had re∣nounced their allegiance since the captivity of Valerian.</P>
<P>When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian, he sternly asked her, How <NOTE PLACE="marg">Behaviour of Zeno∣bia.</NOTE>
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors of Rome! The answer of Zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect and firmness. <Q>Be∣cause I disdained to consider as Roman em∣perors an Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Pollio in Hist. p. 199.</NOTE>.</Q> But as female fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial; she trembled at the angry clamours of the soldiers, who called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the gene∣rous despair of Cleopatra, which she had pro∣posed as her model, and ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her friends. It was to their counsels which governed the weak∣ness of her sex, that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance; it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the cruel Aure∣lian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent vic∣tims of her fear, will survive that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him. Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered soldier, but they had served to elevate and harmonise the soul of Lon∣ginus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestowing comfort on his afflicted friends <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 219. Zosimus, l. i. p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>

Returning from the conquest of the East, Au∣relian had already crossed the Streights which divide Europe from Asia, when he was pro∣voked <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion and ruin of Palmy∣ra.</NOTE> by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred the governor and garrison which he had left among them, and again erected the standard of revolt. Without a moment's deli∣beration, he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed by his rapid ap∣proach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 219.</NOTE>, that old men, women, children, and peasants, had been involved in that dread∣ful execution, which should have been confined to armed rebellion; and although his principal concern seems directed to the re-establishment of a temple of the Sun, he discovers some pity for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants the permission of rebuilding and in∣habiting their city. But it is easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts, and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling fortress, and at length a miser∣able village. The present citizens of Palmyra, consisting of thirty or forty families, have erected their mud cottages within the spacious court of a magnificent temple.</P>
<P>Another and a last labour still awaited the in∣defatigable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurelian suppresses the rebel∣lion of Firmus in Egypt.</NOTE> Aurelian; to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, who, during the revolt of
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally, as he proudly styled himself, of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a wealthy merchant of Egypt. In the course of his trade to India, he had formed very intimate connexions with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whose situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy introduction into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom, and, at the head of their furious multitude, broke into the city of Alex∣andria, where he assumed the Imperial purple, coined money, published edicts, and raised an army, which, as he vainly boasted, he was capa∣ble of maintaining from the sole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a feeble defence against the approach of Aurelian; and it seems almost unnecessary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured, and put to death. Aurelian might now congratulate the senate, the people, and himself, that in little more than three years, he had restored universal peace and order to the Roman world <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">See Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 220. 242. As an instance of luxury, it is observed, that he had glass windows. He was remarkable for his strength and appetite, his courage and dexterity.

The pomp was opened by twenty elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the most curious animals from every climate of the North, the East, and the South. They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators, devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of Asia, the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed in exact symmetry or artful disorder. The ambassadors of the most remote parts of the earth, of Aethio∣pia, Arabia, Persia, Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their rich or singular dresses, displayed the fame and power of the Roman emperor, who exposed likewise to the public view the presents that he had received, and particu∣larly a great number of crowns of gold, the offer∣ings of grateful cities. The victories of Aure∣lian were attested by the long train of captives who reluctantly attended his triumph, Goths, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians. Each people was dis∣tinguished by its peculiar inscription, and the title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the Gothic nation who had been taken in arms <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Among barbarous nations, women have often combated by the side of their husbands. But it is <HI>almost</HI> impossible, that a society of Amazons should ever have existed either in the old or new world.</NOTE>. But every eye, disregarding

The beau∣teous figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold; a slave supported the gold chain which encircled her neck, and she almost fainted under the intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded on foot the magnificent chariot, in which she once hoped to enter the gates of Rome. It was followed by two other chariots, still more sump∣tuous, of Odenathus and of the Persian monarch. The triumphal car of Aurelian (it had formerly been used by a Gothic king) was drawn, on this memorable occasion, either by four stags or by four elephants <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Most probably the former; the latter, seen on the medals of Aurelian, only denote (according to the learned Cardinal Noris) an oriental victory.</NOTE>. The most illustrious of the senate, the people, and the army, closed the so∣lemn procession.

<P>But however, in the treatment of his unfor∣tunate rivals, Aurelian might indulge his pride, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His treat∣ment of Tetricus and Zeno∣bia.</NOTE> he behaved towards them with a generous cle∣mency, which was seldom exercised by the an∣cient conquerors. Princes who, without success, had defended their throne or freedom, were fre∣quently strangled in prison, as soon as the tri∣umphal pomp ascended the Capitol. These usurpers, whom their defeat had convicted of the crime of treason, were permitted to spend their lives in affluence and honourable repose. The emperor presented Zenobia with an elegant villa at Tibur, or Tivoli, about twenty miles from the capital; the Syrian queen insensibly sunk into a Roman matron, her daughters married into noble families, and her race was not yet extinct in the fifth century <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist.

<P>So long and so various was the pomp of Au∣relian's <NOTE PLACE="marg">His mag∣nificence and devo∣tion.</NOTE> triumph, that although it opened with the dawn of day, the slow majesty of the pro∣cession ascended not the Capitol before the ninth hour; and it was already dark when the emperor returned to the palace. The sestival was pro∣tracted by theatrical representations, the games of the circus, the hunting of wild beasts, com∣bats of gladiators, and naval engagements. Li∣eral donatives were distributed to the army and people, and several institutions, agreeable or be∣neficial to the city, contributed to perpetuate the glory of Aurelian. A considerable portion of his oriental spoils was consecrated to the gods of Rome; the Capitol, and every other temple, glittered with the offerings of his ostentatious piety; and the temple of the Sun alone received

<P>The arms of Aurelian had vanquished the fo∣reign and domestic foes of the Republic.

But if we attentively reflect how much swifter is the progress of cor∣ruption than its cure, and if we remember that the years abandoned to public disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of Aure∣lian, we must confess that a few short intervals of peace were insufficient for the arduous work
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
of reformation. Even his attempt to restore the integrity of the coin, was opposed by a formid∣able insurrection. The emperor's vexation breaks out in one of his private letters. <Q>Surely, says he, the gods have decreed that my life should be a perpetual warfare. A sedition within the walls has just now given birth to a very serious civil war. The workmen of the mint, at the instigation of Felicissimus, a slave to whom I had intrusted an employment in the finances, have risen in rebellion. They are at length suppressed; but seven thousand of my soldiers have been slain in the contest, of those troops whose ordinary station is in Dacia, and the camps along the Danube <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 222. Aurelian calls those soldiers <HI>Hiberi Riparienses, Castriani,</HI> and <HI>Dacisci.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Other writers, who confirm the same fact, add likewise, that it happened soon after Aurelian's triumph; that the decisive engagement was fought on the Caelian hill; that the workmen of the mint had adulterated the coin; and that the emperor restored the public credit, by deliver∣ing out good money in exchange for the bad, which the people was commanded to bring into the treasury <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. i. p. 56. Eutropius, ix. 14. Aurel. Victor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We might content ourselves with relating this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Observa∣tions upon it.</NOTE> extraordinary transaction, but we cannot dissem∣ble how much in its present form it appears to us inconsistent and incredible. The debasement of the coin is indeed well suited to the admini∣stration of Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
instruments of the corruption might dread the inflexible justice of Aurelian. But the guilt, as well as the profit, must have been confined to a few; nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm a people whom they had injured, against a monarch whom they had betrayed. We might naturally expect, that such miscreants should have shared the public detestation, with the informers and the other ministers of oppres∣sion; and that the reformation of the coin should have been an action equally popular with the destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the emperor's orders were burnt in the forum of Trajan <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 222. Aurel. Victor.</NOTE>. In an age when the principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious means; but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of intolerable taxes, imposed either on the land or on the necessaries of life, may at last provoke those who will not, or who cannot, relinquish their country. But the case is far otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients, restores the just value of money. The transient evil is soon obliterated by the permanent bene∣fit, the loss is divided among multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experience a sensible diminution of treasure, with their riches, they at the same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they derived from the posses∣sion
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
of them. However Aurelian might chuse to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his reformation of the coin could only furnish a faint pretence to a party already powerful and discontented. Rome, though deprived of free∣dom, was distracted by faction. The people, towards whom the emperor, himself a plebeian, always expressed a peculiar fondness, lived in per∣petual dissention with the senate, the equestrian order, and the Praetorian guards <NOTE N="91" PLACE="foot">It already raged before Aurelian's return from Egypt. See Vopiscus, who quotes an original letter. Hist. August. p. 244.</NOTE>. Nothing less than the firm though secret conspiracy of those orders, of the authority of the first, the wealth of the second, and the arms of the third, could have displayed a strength capable of con∣tending in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which, under the conduct of a martial sovereign, had atchieved the conquest of the West and of the East.</P>
<P>Whatever was the cause or the object of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of Aurelian.</NOTE> rebellion, imputed with so little probability to the workmen of the mint, Aurelian used his vic∣tory with unrelenting rigour <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 222. The two Victors. Eutro∣pius, ix. 14. Zosimus (l. i. p. 43.) mentions only three senators, and places their death before the eastern war.</NOTE>. He was natu∣rally of a severe disposition. A peasant and a soldier, his nerves yielded not easily to the im∣pressions of sympathy, and he could sustain with∣out emotion the sight of tortures and death. Trained from his earliest youth in the exercise of arms, he set too small a value on the life of a
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
citizen, chastised by military execution the slight∣est offences, and transferred the stern discipline of the camp into the civil administration of the laws. His love of justice often became a blind and furious passion; and whenever he deemed his own or the public safety endangered, he dis∣regarded the rules of evidence, and the propor∣tion of punishments. The unprovoked rebel∣lion with which the Romans rewarded his ser∣vices, exasperated his haughty spirit. The no∣blest families of the capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark conspiracy. A hasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody prose∣cution, and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the emperor. The executioners (if we may use the expression of a contemporary poet) were fatigued, the prisons were crowded, and the un∣happy senate lamented the death or absence of its most illustrious members <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot"><L>Nulla catenati feralis pompa senatûs</L>

At the head of an army, less formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and valour, the emperor advanced as far as the Streights which divide Europe from Asia. He there experienced, that the most ab∣solute power is a weak defence against the effects of despair. He had threatened one of his secre∣taries who was accused of extortion; and it was known that he seldom threatened in vain. The last hope which remained for the criminal, was to involve some of the principal officers of the army in his danger, or at least in his fears. Artfully counterfeiting his master's hand, he shewed them, in a long and bloody list, their own names devoted to death. Without suspect∣ing or examining the fraud, they resolved to secure their lives by the murder of the emperor. On his march, between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian was suddenly attacked by the conspira∣tors,

<P>SUCH was the unhappy condition of the Ro∣man emperors, that, whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the same. A <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraordi∣nary con∣test be∣tween the army and the senate for the choice of an empe∣ror.</NOTE> life of pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almost every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of treason and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable by its extraordinary consequences. The legions admired, lamented, and revenged, their victo∣rious chief. The artifice of his perfidious secre∣tary was discovered and punished. The deluded conspirators attended the funeral of their injured sovereign, with sincere or well-feigned contri∣tion, and submitted to the unanimous resolution of the military order, which was signified by the following epistle. <Q>The brave and fortunate armies to the senate and people of Rome. The crime of one man, and the error of many, have deprived us of the late emperor Aurelian. May it please you, venerable lords and fathers! to place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a successor whom your judgment shall declare worthy of the Imperial purple! None of those, whose guilt or misfortune have
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
contributed to our loss, shall ever reign over us <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 222. Aurelius Victor mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the senate.</NOTE>.</Q> The Roman senators heard, without surprise, that another emperor had been assassi∣nated in his camp: they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the modest and dutiful ad∣dress of the legions, when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul, diffused the most pleasing astonishment. Such honours as fear and perhaps esteem could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their deceased sovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could in∣spire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic, who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the senate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwithstanding this flattering appeal, the most prudent of the assembly declined exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multitude. The strength of the le∣gions was, indeed, a pledge of their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom re∣duced to the necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be expected, that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of fourscore years? Should the soldiers relapse into their ac∣customed seditions, their insolence might disgrace the majesty of the senate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice. Motives like these dictated a decree, by which the election of a new em∣peror was referred to the suffrage of the military order.</P>

The contention that ensued is one of the best attested, but most improbable events in the his∣tory of mankind <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus, our principal authority, wrote at Rome, sixteen years only after the death of Aurelian; and, besides the recent notoriety of the facts, constantly draws his materials from the Journals of the Senate, and the original papers of the Ulpian library. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this transaction as they were in ge∣neral of the Roman constitution.</NOTE>. The troops, as if satiated <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 275. Feb. 3.</NOTE> with the exercise of power, again conjured the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A peaceful interreg∣num of eight months.</NOTE> senate to invest one of its own body with the Im∣perial purple. The senate still persisted in its re∣fusal; the army in its request. The reciprocal offer was pressed and rejected at least three times, and whilst the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to receive a master from the hands of the other, eight months insensibly elapsed: an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during which the Roman world remained without a sovereign, without an usurper, and without a sedition. The generals and magistrates appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary functions; and it is observed, that a proconsul of Asia was the only considerable person removed from his office, in the whole course of the interregnum.</P>
<P>An event somewhat similar, but much less au∣thentic, is supposed to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and character, bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was vacant during twelve months, till the elec∣tion of a Sabine philosopher, and the public peace was guarded in the same manner, by the union of the several orders of the state. But, in the
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
time of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was easily preserved in a small and virtuous community <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Liv. i. 17. Dionys. Halicarn. l. ii. p. 115. Plutarch in Nu∣ma, p. 60. The first of these writers relates the story like an ora∣tor, the second like a lawyer, and the third like a moralist, and none of them probably without some intermixture of fable.</NOTE>. The decline of the Roman state, far different from its infancy, was attended with every cir∣cumstance that could banish from an interregnum the prospect of obedience and harmony: an im∣mense and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of empire, the servile equality of despotism, an army of four hundred thousand mercenaries, and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwithstanding all these temptations, the disci∣pline and memory of Aurelian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions maintained their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the Imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the pro∣vinces. A generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the senate, as the only expedient capable of restoring the re∣public to its ancient beauty and vigour.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the murder of Aurelian, the consul <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 275. Sept. 25.</NOTE> convoked an assembly of the senate, and reported <NOTE PLACE="marg">The consul assembles the senate.</NOTE>
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
the doubtful and dangerous situation of the em∣pire. He slightly insinuated, that the precarious loyalty of the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour, and of every accident; but he re∣presented, with the most convincing eloquence, the various dangers that might attend any far∣ther delay in the choice of an emperor. Intelli∣gence, he said, was already received, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, and occupied some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul. The ambition of the Persian king kept the East in perpetual alarms; Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were exposed to foreign and domestic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer even a female sceptre to the sanctity of the Roman laws. The consul then addressing himself to Ta∣citus, the first of the senators <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q>Vopiscus (in Hist. August. p. 227.) calls him <Q>primae sententiae consularis;</Q> and soon afterwards <HI>Princeps senatûs.</HI></Q> It is natural to suppose, that the monarchs of Rome, disdaining that humble title, resigned it to the most ancient of the senators.</NOTE>, required his opinion on the important subject of a proper can∣didate for the vacant throne.</P>
<P>If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall esteem the birth of Tacitus <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Taci∣tus.</NOTE> more truly noble than that of kings. He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian, whose writings will instruct the last generations of man∣kind <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The only objection to this genealogy, is, that the historian was named Cornelius, the emperor, Claudius. But under the lower empire, surnames were extremely various and uncertain.</NOTE>. The senator Tacitus was then seventy-five

years of age <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian Chronicle, by an obvious mistake, transfers that age to Aurelian.</NOTE>. The long period of his in∣nocent life was adorned with wealth and honours. He had twice been invested with the consular dignity <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In the year 273, he was ordinary consul. But he must have been Suffectus many years before, and most probably under Vale∣rian.</NOTE>, and enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between two and three millions sterling <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bis millies octingenties.</HI> Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 229. This sum, according to the old standard, was equivalent to eight hundred and forty thousand Roman pounds of silver, each of the value of three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus, the coin had lost much of its weight and purity.</NOTE>. The experience of so many princes, whom he had esteemed or endured, from the vain follies of Elagabalus to the useful rigour of Aurelian, taught him to form a just estimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations, of their sublime station. From the assiduous study of his immortal ancestor he derived the knowledge of the Roman constitution, and of human nature <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">After his accession, he gave orders that ten copies of the histo∣rian should be annually transcribed and placed in the public libraries. The Roman libraries have long since perished, and the most valuable part of Tacitus was preserved in a single MS. and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. See Bayle, Dictionnaire, Art. <HI>Tacite,</HI> and Lipsius ad Annal. ii. 9.</NOTE>. The voice of the people had already named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire. The ungrateful rumour reached his ears, and induced him to seek the retirement of one of his villas in Campania. He had passed two months in the delightful privacy of Baiae, when he reluctantly obeyed the sum∣mons
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
of the consul to resume his honourable place in the senate, and to assist the republic with his counsels on this important occasion.</P>
<P>He arose to speak, when, from every quarter of the house, he was saluted with the names of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is elect∣ed empe∣ror,</NOTE> Augustus and Emperor. <Q>Tacitus Augustus, the gods preserve thee, we chuse thee for our sovereign, to thy care we intrust the republic and the world. Accept the empire from the authority of the senate. It is due to thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.</Q> As soon as the tumult of acclamations subsided, Tacitus attempted to decline the dangerous honour, and to express his wonder, that they should elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigour of Aurelian. <Q>Are these limbs, conscript fa∣thers! fitted to sustain the weight of armour, or to practise the exercises of the camp? The variety of climates, and the hardships of a mi∣litary life, would soon oppress a feeble con∣stitution, which subsists only by the most tender management. My exhausted strength scarcely enables me to discharge the duty of a senator; how insufficient would it prove to the arduous labours of war and government? Can you hope, that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose days have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement? Can you de∣sire that I should ever find reason to regret the favourable opinion of the senate <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 227.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>The reluctance of Tacitus, and it might pos∣sibly <NOTE PLACE="marg">and ac∣cepts the purple.</NOTE> be sincere, was encountered by the affec∣tionate
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
obstinacy of the senate. Five hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the greatest of the Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, had ascend∣ed the throne in a very advanced season of life; that the mind, not the body, a sovereign, not a soldier, was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him no more than to guide by his wisdom the valour of the legions. These pressing though tumultuary instances were se∣conded by a more regular oration of Metius Fal∣conius, the next on the consular bench to Ta∣citus himself. He reminded the assembly of the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a virtuous and experi∣enced senator, and, with a manly, though per∣haps a selfish, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to re∣member the reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own family, but in the republic. The speech of Falconius was enforced by a general acclamation. The emperor elect submitted to the authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of his equals. The judgment of the senate was confirmed by the consent of the Roman people, and of the Prae∣torian guards <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 228. Tacitus addressed the Praetorians by the appellation of <HI>sanctissimi milites,</HI> and the people by that of <HI>sacratissimi Quirites.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The administration of Tacitus was not un∣worthy of his life and principles. A grateful <NOTE PLACE="marg">Authority of the se∣nate.</NOTE> servant of the senate, he considered that national

council as the author, and himself as the subject, of the laws <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">In his manumissions he never exceeded the number of an hun∣dred, as limited by the Caninian law, which was enacted under Augustus, and at length repealed by Justinian. See Casaubon ad locum Vopisci.</NOTE>. He studied to heal the wounds which Imperial pride, civil discord, and military violence, had inflicted on the constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient re∣public, as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and the virtues of Trajan and the An∣tonines. It may not be useless to recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to have regained by the elec∣tion of Tacitus <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">See the lives of Tacitus, Florianus, and Probus, in the Au∣gustan History; we may be well assured, that whatever the soldier gave, the senator had already given.</NOTE>. 1. To invest one of their body, under the title of emperor, with the ge∣neral command of the armies and the govern∣ment of the frontier provinces. 2. To deter∣mine the list, or as it was then styled, the Col∣lege of Consuls. They were twelve in number, who, in successive pairs, each, during the space of two months, filled the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office. The authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was exercised with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor in favour of his brother Florianus. <Q>The senate, exclaimed Tacitus, with the ho∣nest transport of a patriot, understand the cha∣racter of a prince whom they have chosen.</Q>
<PB N="66" REF="81"/>
3. To appoint the proconsuls and presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magi∣strates their civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive ap∣peals through the intermediate office of the prae∣fect of the city from all the tribunals of the em∣pire. 5. To give force and validity, by their decrees, to such as they should approve of the emperor's edicts. 6. To these several branches of authority, we may add some inspection over the finances, since, even in the stern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue from the public service <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 216. The passage is perfectly clear; yet both Casaubon and Salmasius wish to correct it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their joy and confi∣dence.</NOTE> all the principal cities of the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica, Corinth, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and Carthage, to claim their obedience, and to inform them of the happy revolution, which had restored the Roman senate to its ancient dignity. Two of these epistles are still extant. We likewise possess two very sin∣gular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators on this occasion. They discover the most excessive joy, and the most unbounded hopes. <Q>Cast away your indolence, it is thus that one of the senators addresses his friend, emerge from your retirements of Baiae and Puteoli.

our just authority, the end of all our desires. We hear appeals, we appoint pro∣consuls, we create emperors; perhaps too we may restrain them—to the wise, a word is suf∣ficient <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 230. 232, 233. The senators celebrated the happy restoration with hecatombs and public rejoi∣cings.</NOTE>.</Q> These lofty expectations were, how∣ever, soon disappointed; nor, indeed, was it pos∣sible, that the armies and the provinces should long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome. On the slightest touch, the unsupported fabric of their pride and power fell to the ground. The expiring senate displayed a sudden lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished for ever.</P>
<P>All that had yet passed at Rome was no more than a theatrical representation, unless it was ra∣tified <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 276. Tacitus is acknow∣ledged by the army.</NOTE> by the more substantial power of the le∣gions. Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream of freedom and ambition, Tacitus proceeded to the Thracian camp, and was there, by the Prae∣torian praefect, presented to the assembled troops, as the prince whom they themselves had de∣manded, and whom the senate had bestowed. As soon as the praefect was silent, the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers with eloquence and propriety. He gratified their avarice by a liberal distribution of treasure, under the names of pay and donative. He engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration, that although his age might disable him from the performance of mili∣tary exploits, his counsels should never be un∣worthy

<P>Whilst the deceased emperor was making pre∣parations for a second expedition into the East, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Alani invade Asia, and are repuls∣ed by Ta∣citus.</NOTE> he had negociated with the Alani, a Scythian people, who pitched their tents in the neighbour∣hood of the lake Moeotis. Those barbarians, al∣lured by presents and subsidies, had promised to invade Persia with a numerous body of light ca∣valry. They were faithful to their engagements; but when they arrived on the Roman frontier, Aurelian was already dead, the design of the Persian war was at least suspended, and the ge∣nerals, who, during their interregnum, exercised a doubtful authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them. Provoked by such treatment, which they considered as trifling and perfidious, the Alani had recourse to their own valour for their payment and revenge; and as they moved with the usual swiftness of Tartars, they had soon spread themselves over the pro∣vinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Ga∣latia. The legions, who from the opposite shores of the Bosphorus could almost distinguish the flames of the cities and villages, impatiently urged their general to lead them against the in∣vaders. The conduct of Tacitus was suitable to his age and station. He convinced the barba∣rians, of the faith, as well as of the power, of the empire. Great numbers of the Alani, ap∣peased by the punctual discharge of the engage∣ments
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
which Aurelian had contracted with them, relinquished their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their own deserts, beyond the Phasis. Against the remainder who refused peace, the Roman emperor waged, in person, a successful war. Seconded by an army of brave and expe∣rienced veterans, in a few weeks he delivered the provinces of Asia from the terror of the Scythian invasion <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 230. Zosimus, l. i. p. 57. Zo∣naras, l. xii. p. 637. Two passages in the life of Probus (p. 236. 238.) convince me, that these Scythian invaders of Pontus were Alani. If we may believe Zosimus (l. i. p. 58.), Florianus pur∣sued them as far as the Cimmerian Bosphorus. But he had scarcely time for so long and difficult an expedition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the empe∣ror Taci∣tus.</NOTE> duration. Transported, in the depth of winter, from the soft retirement of Campania, to the foot of mount Caucasus, he sunk under the unaccus∣tomed hardships of a military life. The fatigues of the body were aggravated by the cares of the mind. For a while, the angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthu∣siasm of public virtue. They soon broke out with redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent, of the aged emperor. His mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt, and he was incessantly tormented with factions which he could not assuage, and by de∣mands which it was impossible to satisfy. What∣ever flattering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public disorders, Tacitus soon was convinced, that the licentiousness of the army
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>
disdained the feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was hastened by anguish and disappoint∣ment. It may be doubtful whether the soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent prince <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only say that he died; Victor Junior adds, that it was of a fever. Zosimus and Zonaras affirm, that he was killed by the soldiers. Vopiscus mentions both ac∣counts, and seems to hesitate. Yet surely these jarring opinions are easily reconciled.</NOTE>. It is certain, that their insolence was the cause of his death. He expired at Tyana in Cappadocia, after a reign of only six months and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 276. April 12.</NOTE> about twenty days <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">According to the two Victors, he reigned exactly two hundred days.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, be∣fore <NOTE PLACE="marg">Usurpation and death of his bro∣ther Flori∣anus.</NOTE> his brother Florianus shewed himself unwor∣thy to reign, by the hasty usurpation of the purple, without expecting the approbation of the senate. The reverence for the Roman constitu∣tion, which yet influenced the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to dispose them to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the precipitate ambition of Florianus. The dis∣content would have evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the heroic Pro∣bus, boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate. The contest, however, was still unequal; nor could the most able leader, at the head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria, en∣counter, with any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe, whose irresistible strength appeared to support the brother of Tacitus. But the fortune
<PB N="71" REF="86"/>
and activity of Probus triumphed over every ob∣stacle. The hardy veterans of his rival, accus∣tomed to cold climates, sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of Cilicia, where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their numbers were diminished by frequent desertion, the passes of the mountains were feebly defended; Tarsus opened its gates, and the soldiers of Flo∣rianus, when they had permitted him to enjoy the Imperial title about three months, delivered the empire from civil war by the easy sacrifice of <NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> a prince whom they despised <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 231. Zosimus, l. i. p. 58, 59. Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. Aurelius Victor says, that Probus assumed the em∣pire in Illyricum; an opinion which (though adopted by a very learned man) would throw that period of history into inextricable confusion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fa∣mily sub∣sists in ob∣scurity.</NOTE> perfectly erased every notion of hereditary right, that the family of an unfortunate emperor was in∣capable of exciting the jealousy of his successors. The children of Tacitus and Florianus were per∣mitted to descend into a private station, and to mingle with the general mass of the people. Their poverty indeed became an additional safe∣guard to their innocence. When Tacitus was elected by the senate, he resigned his ample pa∣trimony to the public service <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 229.</NOTE>, an act of gene∣rosity specious in appearance, but which evidently disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his descendants. The only consolation of their fallen state, was the remembrance of transient
<PB N="72" REF="87"/>
greatness, and a distant hope, the child of a flat∣tering prophecy, that at the end of a thousand years, a monarch of the race of Tacitus should arise, the protector of the senate, the restorer of Rome, and the conqueror of the whole earth <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">He was to send judges to the Parthians, Persians, and Sarma∣tians, a president to Taprobana, and a proconsul to the Roman island (supposed by Casaubon and Salmasius to mean Britain). Such a history as mine (says Vopiscus with proper modesty) will not subsist a thousand years to expose or justify the prediction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The peasants of Illyricum, who had already <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and eleva∣tion of the emperor Probus.</NOTE> given Claudius and Aurelian to the sinking em∣pire, had an equal right to glory in the elevation of Probus <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">For the private life of Probus, see Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 234-237.</NOTE>. Above twenty years before, the emperor Valerian, with his usual penetration, had discovered the rising merit of the young soldier, on whom he conferred the rank of tribune, long before the age prescribed by the military regula∣tions. The tribune soon justified his choice, by a victory over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a near relation of Va∣lerian; and deserved to receive from the empe∣ror's hand the collars, bracelets, spears, and ban∣ners, the mural and the civic crown, and all the honourable rewards reserved by ancient Rome for successful valour. The third, and afterwards the tenth, legion were intrusted to the command of Probus, who, in every step of his promotion, shewed himself superior to the station which he filled. Africa and Pontus, the Rhine, the Da∣nube, the Euphrates, and the Nile, by turns af∣forded
<PB N="73" REF="88"/>
him the most splendid occasions of display∣ing his personal prowess and his conduct in war. Aurelian was indebted to him for the conquest of Egypt, and still more indebted for the honest courage with which he often checked the cruelty of his master. Tacitus, who desired by the abi∣lities of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military talents, named him commander in chief of all the eastern provinces, with five times the usual salary, the promise of the consulship, and the hope of a triumph. When Probus ascended the Imperial throne, he was about forty-four years of age <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">According to the Alexandrian Chronicle, he was fifty at the time of his death.</NOTE>; in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the army, and of a mature vigour of mind and body.</P>
<P>His acknowledged merit, and the success of <NOTE PLACE="marg">His re∣spectful conduct towards the senate.</NOTE> his arms against Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we may credit his own professions, very far from being desirous of the empire, he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance. <Q>But it is no longer in my power, says Probus, in a private letter, to lay down a title so full of envy and of danger. I must continue to personate the character which the soldiers have imposed upon me <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">The letter was addressed to the Praetorian praefect, whom (on condition of his good behaviour) he promised to continue in his great office.

For you are the legal so∣vereigns of the world, and the power which you derive from your ancestors, will descend to your posterity. Happy would it have been, if Florianus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a private inheritance, had ex∣pected what your majesty might determine, either in his favour, or in that of any other person. The prudent soldiers have punished his rashness. To me they have offered the title of Augustus. But I submit to your cle∣mency my pretensions and my merits <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist.

August 3.</NOTE> the senators were unable to disguise their sa∣tisfaction, that Probus should condescend thus humbly to solicit a sceptre which he already pos∣sessed. They celebrated with the warmest gra∣titude his virtues, his exploits, and above all his moderation. A decree immediately passed, with∣out a dissenting voice, to ratify the election of the eastern armies, and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the Imperial dignity: the names of Caesar and Augustus, the title of Father of his country, the right of making in the same day three motions in the senate <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 238. It is odd, that the senate should treat Probus less favourably than Marcus Antoninus. That prince had received, even before the death of Pius, <HI>Jus quintae relationis.</HI> See Capitolin. in Hist. August. p. 24.</NOTE>, the office
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
of Pontifex Maximus, the tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of investi∣ture, which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of the emperor, expressed the constitu∣tion of the ancient republic. The reign of Pro∣bus corresponded with this fair beginning. The senate was permitted to direct the civil admini∣stration of the empire. Their faithful general asserted the honour of the Roman arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">See the dutiful letter of Probus to the senate, after his German victories. Hist. August. p. 239.</NOTE>. Yet, whilst he gratified their vanity, he must se∣cretly have despised their indolence and weakness. Though it was every moment in their power to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud successors of the Scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclusion from all military employments. They soon experienced, that those who refuse the sword, must renounce the sceptre.</P>
<P>The strength of Aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies of Rome. After his death they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Victories of Probus over the barba∣rians.</NOTE> seemed to revive with an increase of fury and of numbers. They were again vanquished by the active vigour of Probus, who, in a short reign of about six years <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">The date and duration of the reign of Probus are very correctly ascertained by Cardinal Noris, in his learned work, De Epochis Sy∣ro-Macedonum, p. 96—105.

He broke the wandering power of the Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquish their spoil. The Gothic nation courted the alliance of so warlike an emperor <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 239.</NOTE>. He attacked the Isaurians in their mountains, besieged and took several of their strongest castles <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. i. p. 62—65.) tells a very long and trifling story of Lycius the Isaurian robber.</NOTE>, and flattered himself that he had for ever suppressed a domestic foe, whose in∣dependence so deeply wounded the majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurper Firmus in the Upper Egypt, had never been per∣fectly appeased, and the cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of the Blemmyes, still maintained an obscure rebellion. The chas∣tisement of those cities, and of their auxiliaries the savages of the South, is said to have alarmed the court of Persia <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. i. p. 65. Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 239, 240. But it seems incredible, that the defeat of the Savages of Aethiopia could affect the Persian monarch.</NOTE>, and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of Probus. Most of the exploits which distinguished his reign, were at∣chieved by the personal valour and conduct of the emperor, insomuch that the writer of his life expresses some amazement how, in so short a time, a single man could be present in so many distant wars. The remaining actions he intrusted to the care of his lieutenants, the judicious choice of
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
whom forms no inconsiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian, Constantius, Ga∣lerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of other chiefs, who afterwards ascended or sup∣ported the throne, were trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Besides these well-known chiefs, several others are named by Vopiscus (Hist. August. p. 241.), whose actions have not reached our knowledge.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the most important service which Probus <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 277.</NOTE> rendered to the republic, was the deliverance of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He deli∣vers Gaul from the invasion of the Ger∣mans,</NOTE> Gaul, and the recovery of seventy flourishing cities oppressed by the barbarians of Germany, who, since the death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with impunity <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">See the Caesars of Julian, and Hist. August. p. 238. 240, 241.</NOTE>. Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders, we may distinguish, with some degree of clearness, three great armies, or rather nations, successively vanquished by the valour of Probus. He drove back the Francs into their morasses; a descrip∣tive circumstance from whence we may infer, that the confederacy known by the manly appellation of <HI>Free,</HI> already occupied the flat maritime coun∣try, intersected and almost overflown by the stag∣nating waters of the Rhine, and that several tribes of the Frisians and Batavians had acceded to their alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a considerable people of the Vandalic race. They had wandered in quest of booty from the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine. They esteem∣ed themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution of all their booty, the permis∣sion
<PB N="78" REF="93"/>
of an undisturbed retreat. They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their punish∣ment was immediate and terrible <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. i. p. 62. Hist. August. p. 240. But the latter suppose the punishment inflicted with the consent of their kings; if so, it was partial, like the offence.</NOTE>. But of all the invaders of Gaul, the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and Si∣lesia <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">See Cluver. Germania Antiqua, l. iii. Ptolemy places in their country the city of Calisia, probably Calish in Silesia.</NOTE>. In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the first rank by their numbers and fierceness. <Q>The Arii (it is thus that they are described by the energy of Tacitus) study to improve by art and circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism. Their shields are black, their bodies are painted black. They chuse for the combat the darkest hour of the night. Their host advances, covered as it were with a fune∣real shade <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot"><HI>Feralis umbra,</HI> is the expression of Tacitus: it is surely a very bold one</NOTE>; nor do they often find an enemy capable of sustaining so strange and infernal an aspect. Of all our senses, the eyes are the first vanquished in battle <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Germ. (c. 43.)</NOTE>.</Q> Yet the arms and discipline of the Romans easily discomfited these horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a general engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs, fell alive into the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor, unwilling to reduce a brave people to dispair, granted them an honourable capitulation, and permitted them
<PB N="79" REF="94"/>
to return in safety to their native country. But the losses which they suffered in the march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the invad∣ers; a work of labour to the Romans, and of expence to the emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barbarian <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 238.</NOTE>. But as the fame of warriors is built on the destruction of human kind, we may naturally suspect, that the sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers, and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of Probus.</P>
<P>Since the expedition of Maximin, the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">and car∣ries his arms into Germany.</NOTE> generals had confined their ambition to a defen∣sive war against the nations of Germany, who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the em∣pire. The more daring Probus pursued his Gallic victories, passed the Rhine, and displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the Neckar. He was fully convinced, that nothing could reconcile the minds of the bar∣barians to peace, unless they experienced in their own country the calamities of war. Germany, exhausted by the ill success of the last emigra∣tion, was astonished by his presence. Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his camp, and fell prostrate at his feet. Such a
<PB N="80" REF="95"/>
treaty was humbly received by the Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate. He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to detain any part of the spoil. A considerable tribute of corn, cattle, and horses, the only wealth of bar∣barians, was reserved for the use of the garrisons which Probus established on the limits of their territory. He even entertained some thoughts of compelling the Germans to relinquish the exercise of arms, and to trust their differences to the justice, their safety to the power, of Rome. To accomplish these salutary ends, the constant residence of an Imperial governor, supported by a numerous army, was indispensably requisite. Probus therefore judged it more expedient to defer the execution of so grèat a design; which was indeed rather of specious than solid utility <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 238, 239. Vopiscus quotes a letter from the emperor to the senate, in which he mentions his design of reducing Germany into a province.</NOTE>. Had Germany been reduced into the state of a province, the Romans, with immense labour and expence, would have acquired only a more ex∣tensive boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians of Scythia.</P>
<P>Instead of reducing the warlike natives of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He builds a wall from the Rhine to the Da∣nube.</NOTE> Germany to the condition of subjects, Probus contented himself with the humble expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads. The country, which now forms the circle of Swabia,
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
had been left desert in the age of Augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. vii. According to Velleius Paterculus (ii. 108.), Maroboduus led his Marcomanni into Bohemia: Cluverius (German. Antiq. iii. 8.) proves that it was from Swabia.</NOTE>. The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a roving temper and of des∣perate fortunes, occupied the doubtful possession, and acknowledged, by the payment of tythes, the majesty of the empire <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">These settlers from the payment of tythes were denominated, <HI>Decumates.</HI> Tacif. Germania, c. 29.</NOTE>. To protect these new subjects, a line of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the Rhine to the Da∣nube. About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence began to be practised, these garrisons were connected and covered by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades. In the place of so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus constructed a stone-wall of a considerable height, and strengthened it by towers at convenient dis∣tances. From the neighbourhood of Newstadt and Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills, vallies, rivers, and morasses, as far as Wimpfen on the Necker, and at length termi∣nated on the banks of the Rhine, after a wind∣ing course of near two hundred miles <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">See Notes de l'Abbe de la Bleterie à la Germanie de Tacite, p. 183. His account of the wall is chiefly borrowed (as he says himself) from the <HI>Alsatia Illustrata</HI> of Schoepflin.</NOTE>. This important barrier, uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of Europe, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
the barbarians, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with the greatest facility into the heart of the empire. But the experience of the world from China to Britain, has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">See Recherches sur les Chinois et les Egyptiens, tom. ii. p. 81—102. The anonymous author is well acquainted with the globe in general, and with Germany in particular: with regard to the latter, he quotes a work of M. Hanselman; but he seems to confound the wall of Probus, designed against the Alemanni, with the fortification of the Mattiaci, constructed in the neighbourhood of Francfort against the Catti.</NOTE>. An active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attack, must, in the end, discover some feeble spot or some unguarded moment. The strength, as well as the atten∣tion, of the defenders is divided; and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest troops, that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly deserted. The fate of the wall which Probus erected, may confirm the general obser∣vation. Within a few years after his death, it was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered ruins, universally ascribed to the power of the Daemon, now serve only to excite the wonder of the Swabian peasant.</P>
<P>Among the useful conditions of peace imposed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc∣tion and settlement of the bar∣barians.</NOTE> by Probus on the vanquished nations of Ger∣many, was the obligation of supplying the Ro∣man army with sixteen thousand recruits, the bravest and most robust of their youth. The emperor dispersed them through all the provinces, and distributed this dangerous reinforcement in small bands of fifty or sixty each, among the
<PB N="83" REF="98"/>
national troops; judiciously observing, that the aid which the republic derived from the barba∣rians, should be felt but not seen <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">He distributed about fifty or sixty Barbarians to a <HI>Numerus,</HI> as it was then called, a corps with whose established number we are not exactly acquainted.</NOTE>. Their aid was now become necessary. The feeble elegance of Italy and the internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms. The hardy frontier of the Rhine and Danube still produced minds and bodies equal to the labours of the camp; but a perpetual series of wars had gradually diminished their numbers. The infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected the principles of population, and not only de∣stroyed the strength of the present, but inter∣cepted the hope of future generations. The wisdom of Probus embraced a great and bene∣ficial plan of replenishing the exhausted frontiers, by new colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed lands, cattle, instruments of husbandry, and every encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of the republic. Into Britain, and most probably into Cambridgeshire <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Camden's Britannia, Introduction, p. 136.; but he speaks from a very doubtful conjecture.</NOTE>, he transported a considerable body of Vandals. The impossibility of an escape reconciled them to their situation, and in the subsequent troubles of that island, they approved themselves the most faithful servants of the state <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. i. p. 62. According to Vopiscus, another body of Vandals was less faithful.</NOTE>. Great num∣bers
<PB N="84" REF="99"/>
of Franks and Gepidae were settled on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine. An hun∣dred thousand Bastarnae, expelled from their own country, cheerfully accepted an establishment in Thrace, and soon imbibed the manners and sen∣timents of Roman subjects <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 240. They were probably expelled by the Goths. Zosim. l. i. p. 66.</NOTE>. But the expec∣tations of Probus were too often disappointed. The impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill brook the slow labours of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom, rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions, alike fatal to themselves and to the provinces <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 240.</NOTE>; nor could these artificial supplies, however repeated by succeeding emperors, re∣store the important limit of Gaul and Illyricum to its ancient and native vigour.</P>
<P>Of all the barbarians who abandones their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Daring en∣terprise of the Franks.</NOTE> new settlements, and disturbed the public tran∣quillity, a very small number returned to their own country. For a short season they might wander in arms through the empire; but in the end they were surely destroyed by the power of a warlike emperor. The successful rashness of a party of Franks was attended, however, with such memorable consequences, that it ought not to be passed unnoticed. They had been esta∣blished by Probus, on the sea-coast of Pontus, with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of the Alani. A fleet stationed in one of the harbours of the Euxine, fell into the
<PB N="85" REF="100"/>
hands of the Franks; and they resolved, through unknown seas, to explore their way from the mouth of the Phasis to that of the Rhine. They easily escaped through the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, and cruizing along the Medi∣terranean, indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder, by frequent descents on the unsus∣pecting shores of Asia, Greece, and Africa. The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the navies of Athens and Carthage had formerly been sunk, was sacked by a handful of barba∣rians, who massacred the greatest part of the trembling inhabitants. From the island of Sicily, the Franks proceeded to the columns of Her∣cules, trusted themselves to the ocean, coasted round Spain and Gaul, and steering their tri∣umphant course through the British channel, at length finished their surprising voyage, by land∣ing in safety on the Batavian or Frisian shores <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Panegyr. Vet. v. 18. Zosimus, l. i. p. 66.</NOTE>. The example of their success, instructing their countrymen to conceive the advantages, and to despise the dangers, of the sea, pointed out to their enterprising spirit, a new road to wealth and glory.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was almost impossible that he could at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Saturni∣nus in the East;</NOTE> once contain in obedience every part of his wide-extended dominions. The barbarians, who broke their chains, had seized the favourable opportunity of a domestic war. When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he devolved the command
<PB N="86" REF="101"/>
of the East on Saturninus. That general, a man of merit and experience, was driven into rebel∣lion by the absence of his sovereign, the levity of the Alexandrian people, the pressing instances of his friends, and his own fears; but from the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of empire, or even of life. <Q>Alas! he said, the republic has lost a useful servant, and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the ser∣vices of many years. You know not, con∣tinued he, the misery of sovereign power; a sword is perpetually suspended over our head. We dread our very guards, we distrust our companions. The choice of action or of re∣pose is no longer in our disposition, nor is there any age, or character, or conduct, that can protect us from the censure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne, you have doomed me to a life of cares, and to an un∣timely fate. The only consolation which re∣mains is, the assurance that I shall not fall alone <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 245, 246. The unfortunate ora∣tor had studied rhetoric at Carthage, and was therefore more proba∣bly a Moor (Zosim. l. i. p. 60.) than a Gaul, as Vopiscus calls him.</NOTE>.</Q> But as the former part of his pre∣diction was verified by the victory, so the lat∣ter was disappointed by the clemency of Probus. That amiable prince attempted even to save the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the soldiers. He had more than once solicited the usurper himself, to place some confidence in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his cha∣racter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 279.</NOTE>
<PB N="87" REF="102"/>
that he had punished, as a malicious in∣former, the first who related the improbable news of his defection <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 638.</NOTE>. Saturninus might, perhaps, have embraced the generous offer, had he not been restrained by the obstinate distrust of his adherents. Their guilt was deeper, and their hopes more sanguine, than those of their expe∣rienced leader.</P>
<P>The revolt of Saturninus was scarcely extin∣guished <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 280. of Bono∣sus and Proculus in Gaul.</NOTE> in the East, before new troubles were excited in the West, by the rebellion of Bonosus and Proculus in Gaul. The most distinguished merit of those two officers was their respective prowess, of the one in the combats of Bacchus, of the other in those of Venus <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">A very surprising instance is recorded of the prowess of Proculus. He had taken one hundred Sarmatian virgins. The rest of the story he must relate in his own language; Ex his unâ nocte decem inivi: omnes tamen, quod in me erat, mulieres intra dies quindecim red∣didi. Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 246.</NOTE>, yet neither of them were destitute of courage and capacity, and both sustained, with honour, the august cha∣racter which the fear of punishment had engaged them to assume, till they sunk at length beneath the superior genius of Probus. He used the victory with his accustomed moderation, and spared the fortunes as well as the lives of their innocent families <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Proculus, who was a native of Albengue on the Genoese coast, armed two thousand of his own slaves.

<P><PB N="88" REF="103"/>
The arms of Probus had now suppressed all the foreign and domestic enemies of the state. His mild but steady administration confirmed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 281.</NOTE> re-establishment of the public tranquillity; nor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Triumph of the em∣peror Pro∣bus.</NOTE> was there left in the provinces a hostile barba∣rian, a tyrant, or even a robber, to revive the memory of past disorders. It was time that the emperor should revisit Rome, and celebrate his own glory and the general happiness. The triumph due to the valour of Probus was conducted with a magnificence suitable to his fortune, and the people who had so lately admired the trophies of Aurelian, gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic successor <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 240.</NOTE>. We cannot, on this occa∣sion, forget the desperate courage of about four∣score Gladiators, reserved with near six hundred others, for the inhuman sports of the amphi∣theatre. Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their confine∣ment, and filled the streets of Rome with blood and confusion. After an obstinate resistance, they were overpowered and cut in pieces by the regular forces; but they obtained at least an honourable death, and the satisfaction of a just revenge <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. i. p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The military discipline which reigned in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His disci∣pline.</NOTE> camps of Probus, was less cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and exact. The latter had punished the irregularities of the soldiers with unrelenting severity, the former
<PB N="89" REF="104"/>
prevented them by employing the legions in constant and useful labours. When Probus commanded in Egypt, he executed many con∣siderable works for the splendour and benefit of that rich country. The navigation of the Nile, so important to Rome itself, was improved; and temples, bridges, porticoes, and palaces, were constructed by the hands of the soldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as husbandmen <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 236.</NOTE>. It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to preserve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness, he had oblig∣ed them to form large plantations of olive trees along the coast of Africa <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Aurel. Victor in Prob. But the policy of Hannibal, unnoticed by any more ancient writer, is irreconcileable with the history of his life. He left Africa when he was nine years old, returned to it when he was forty-five, and immediately lost his army in the deci∣sive battle of Zama. Livius, xxx. 37.</NOTE>. From a similar principle, Probus exercised his legions in cover∣ing, with rich vineyards, the hills of Gaul and Pannonia, and two considerable spots are describ∣ed, which were entirely dug and planted by military labour <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 240. Eutrop. ix. 17. Aurel. Victor in Prob. Victor Junior. He revoked the prohibition of Domitian, and grant∣ed a general permission of planting vines to the Gauls, the Britons, and the Pannonians.</NOTE>. One of these, known under the name of Mount Almo, was situated near Sirmium, the country where Probus was born, for which he ever retained a partial affection, and whose gratitude he endeavoured to secure, by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract of marshy ground. An army thus employ∣ed,
<PB N="90" REF="105"/>
constituted perhaps the most useful, as well as the bravest, portion of Roman subjects.</P>
<P>But in the prosecution of a favourite scheme, the best of men, satisfied with the rectitude of <NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> their intentions, are subject to forget the bounds of moderation; nor did Probus himself suffici∣ently consult the patience and disposition of his fierce legionaries <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Julian bestows a severe, and indeed excessive, censure on the rigour of Probus, who, as he thinks, almost deserved his fate.</NOTE>. The dangers of the military profession seem only to be compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness; but if the duties of the soldier are incessantly aggravated by the labours of the peasant, he will at last sink under the intolerable burden, or shake it off with indigna∣tion. The imprudence of Probus is said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops. More at∣tentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army, he expressed the vain hope, that, by the establishment of universal peace, he should soon abolish the necessity of a standing and mer∣cenary force <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 241. He lavishes on this idle hope a large stock of very foolish eloquence.</NOTE>. The unguarded expression prov∣ed fatal to him. In one of the hottest days of summer, as he severely urged the unwholesome labour of draining the marshes of Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fatigue, on a sudden threw down their tools, grasped their arms, and broke out into a furious mutiny. The emperor, con∣scious of his danger, took refuge in a lofty tower, constructed for the purpose of surveying the
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
progress of the work <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Turris ferrata. It seems to have been a moveable tower, and cased with iron.</NOTE>. The tower was instantly forced, and a thousand swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the unfortunate Probus. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 282, August.</NOTE> The rage of the troops subsided as soon as it had been gratified. They then lamented their fatal rashness, forgot the severity of the emperor, whom they had massacred, and hastened to per∣petuate, by an honourable monument, the me∣mory of his virtues and victories <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">Probus, et vere probus situs est: Victor omnium gentium Bar∣bararum: victor etiam tyrannorum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the legions had indulged their grief <NOTE PLACE="marg">Election and cha∣racter of Carus.</NOTE> and repentance for the death of Probus, their unanimous consent declared Carus, his Praetorian praefect, the most deserving of the Imperial throne. Every circumstance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature. He gloried in the title of Roman Citizen; and affected to compare the purity of <HI>his</HI> blood, with the foreign and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors; yet the most inquisitive of his contemporaries, very far from admitting his claim, have variously deduced his own birth, or that of his parents, from Illyricum, from Gaul, or from Africa <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">Yet all this may be conciliated. He was born at Narbonne in Illyricum, confounded by Eutropius with the more famous city of that name in Gaul. His father might be an African, and his mo∣ther a noble Roman. Carus himself was educated in the capital. See Scaliger, Animadversion. ad Euseb. Chron. p. 241.</NOTE>. Though a soldier, he had received a learned education; though a senator, he was invested with the first dignity of
<PB N="92" REF="107"/>
the army; and in an age, when the civil and mi∣litary professions began to be irrecoverably sepa∣rated from each other, they were united in the person of Carus. Notwithstanding the severe justice which he exercised against the assassins of Probus, to whose favour and esteem he was highly indebted, he could not escape the suspicion of being accessary to a deed from whence he de∣rived the principal advantage. He enjoyed, at least before his elevation, an acknowledged cha∣racter of virtue and abilities <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Probus had requested of the senate an equestrian statue and a marble palace, at the public expence, as a just recompence of the singular merit of Carus. Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 249.</NOTE>; but his austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and cruelty; and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate whether they shall not rank him in the number of Roman tyrants <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist.

<P>The authority of the senate expired with Pro∣bus <NOTE PLACE="marg">The senti∣ments of the senate and peo∣ple.</NOTE>; nor was the repentance of the soldiers dis∣played by the same dutiful regard for the civil power, which they had testified after the unfor∣tunate death of Aurelian. The election of Carus was decided without expecting the approbation of the senate, and the new emperor contented
<PB N="93" REF="108"/>
himself with announcing, in a cold and stately epistle, that he had ascended the vacant throne <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 249. Carus congratulated the senate, that one of their own order was made emperor.</NOTE>. A behaviour so very opposite to that of his ami∣able predecessor, afforded no favourable presage of the new reign; and the Romans, deprived of power and freedom, asserted their privilege of licentious murmurs <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 242.</NOTE>. The voice of congratula∣tion and flattery was not however silent; and we may still peruse, with pleasure and contempt, an eclogue, which was composed on the accession of the emperor Carus. Two shepherds, avoiding the noon-tide heat, retire into the cave of Fau∣nus. On a spreading beech they discover some recent characters. The rural deity had described, in prophetic verses, the felicity promised to the empire, under the reign of so great a prince. Faunus hails the approach of that hero, who, receiving on his shoulders the sinking weight of the Roman world, shall extinguish war and fac∣tion, and once again restore the innocence and security of the golden age <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">See the first eclogue of Calphurnius. The design of it is pre∣ferred by Fontenelle, to that of Virgil's Pollio. See tom. iii. p. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is more than probable, that these elegant <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carus de∣feats the Sarma∣tians, and marches into the East;</NOTE> trifles never reached the ears of a veteran general, who, with the consent of the legions, was pre∣paring to execute the long suspended design of the Persian war. Before his departure for this distant expedition, Carus conferred on his two

sons, Carinus and Numerian, the title of Caesar, and investing the former with almost an equal share of the Imperial power, directed the young prince, first to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul, and afterwards to fix the seat of his residence at Rome, and to assume the govern∣ment of the western provinces <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 353. Eutropius, ix. 18. Pagi Annal.</NOTE>. The safety of Illyricum was confirmed by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians; sixteen thousand of those bar∣barians remained on the field of battle, and the number of captives amounted to twenty thou∣sand. The old emperor, animated with the fame and prospect of victory, pursued his march, in the midst of winter, through the countries of Thrace and Asia Minor, and at length, with his younger son Numerian, arrived on the confines of the Persian monarchy.

His ambassadors entered the camp about sun-set, at the time when the troops were satisfying their hunger with a frugal repast. The Persians expressed their desire of being introduced
<PB N="95" REF="110"/>
to the presence of the Roman emperor. They were at length conducted to a soldier, who was seated on the grass. A piece of stale bacon and a few hard pease composed his supper. A coarse woollen garment of purple was the only circum∣stance that announced his dignity. The confer∣ence was conducted with the same disregard of courtly elegance. Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness, assured the am∣bassadors, that, unless their master acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render Persia as naked of trees, as his own head was destitute of hair <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Synesius tells this story of Carinus; and it is much more natu∣ral to understand it of Carus, than (as Petavius and Tillemont chuse to do) of Probus.</NOTE>.

<P>The threats of Carus were not without effect.

<PB N="96" REF="111"/>
domestic factions, and the greater part of their forces were detained on the frontiers of India. Rome and the East received with transport the news of such important advantages. Flattery and hope painted, in the most lively colours, the fall of Persia, the conquest of Arabia, the sub∣mission of Egypt, and a lasting deliverance from the inroads of the Scythian nations <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">To the Persian victory of Carus, I refer the dialogue of the <HI>Philopatris,</HI> which has so long been an object of dispute among the learned.

The darkness which overspread the sky was so thick, that we could no longer distinguish each other; and the incessant flashes of lightning took from us the knowledge of all that passed in the ge∣neral confusion. Immediately after the most violent clap of thunder, we heard a sudden cry, that the emperor was dead; and it soon ap∣peared, that his chamberlains, in a rage of grief, had set fire to the royal pavillion, a cir∣cumstance which gave rise to the report that Carus was killed by lightning. But, as far as
<PB N="97" REF="112"/>
we have been able to investigate the truth, his death was the natural effect of his disorder <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 250. Yet Eutropius, Festus, Rufus, the two Victors, Jerome, Sidonius Apollinaris, Syncellus, and Zona∣ras, all ascribe the death of Carus to lightning.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance. The ambition of the aspir∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is suc∣ceeded by his two sons Cari∣nus and Numerian.</NOTE> generals was checked by their mutual fears, and young Numerian, with his absent brother Carinus, were unanimously acknowledged as Ro∣man emperors. The public expected that the successor of Carus would pursue his father's foot∣steps, and without allowing the Persians to re∣cover from their consternation, would advance sword in hand to the palaces of Susa and Ecba∣tana <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">See Nemesian. Cynegeticon, v. 71, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the legions, however strong in num∣bers and discipline, were dismayed by the most abject superstition. Notwithstanding all the arts that were practised to disguise the manner of the late emperor's death, it was found impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude, and the power of opinion is irresistible. Places or per∣sons struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror, as singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">See Festus and his commentators, on the word <HI>Scribonianum. Places</HI> struck with lightning, were surrounded with a wall: <HI>things</HI> were buried with mysterious ceremony.</NOTE>. An oracle was re∣membered, which marked the river Tigris as the fatal boundary of the Roman arms. The troops, terrified with the fate of Carus and with their own danger, called aloud on young Numerian to obey the will of the gods, and to lead them away from
<PB N="98" REF="113"/>
this inauspicious scene of war. The feeble em∣peror was unable to subdue their obstinate preju∣dice, and the Persians wondered at the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 250. Aurelius Victor seems to believe the prediction, and to approve the retreat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 384. Vices of Carinus.</NOTE> late emperor, was soon carried from the frontiers of Persia to Rome; and the senate, as well as the provinces, congratulated the accession of the sons of Carus. These fortunate youths were strangers, however, to that conscious superiority, either of birth or of merit, which can alone render the possession of a throne easy, and as it were natural. Born and educated in a private station, the elec∣tion of their father raised them at once to the rank of princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months afterwards, left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire. To sustain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of virtue and prudence was requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the brothers, was more than commonly deficient in those qualities. In the Gallic war, he discovered some degree of personal courage <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Nemesian. Cynegeticon, v. 69. He was a contemporary, but a poet.</NOTE>; but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he abandoned himself to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his fortune. He was soft yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of taste; and though ex∣quisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the public esteem. In the course of a few months,
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
he successively married and divorced nine wives, most of whom he left pregnant; and notwith∣standing this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge such a variety of irregular appetites, as brought dishonour on himself and on the noblest houses of Rome. He beheld with inveterate ha∣tred all those who might remember his former obscurity, or censure his present conduct. He banished, or put to death, the friends and coun∣sellors whom his father had placed about him, to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted with the meanest revenge his school-fellows and companions, who had not sufficiently respected the latent majesty of the emperor. With the se∣nators, Carinus affected a lofty and regal de∣meanour, frequently declaring, that he designed to distribute their estates among the populace of Rome. From the dregs of that populace, he se∣lected his favourites, and even his ministers. The palace, and even the Imperial table, was filled with singers, dancers, prostitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and folly. One of his door-keepers <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cancellarius.</HI> This word, so humble in its original, has by a singular fortune rose into the title of the first great office of state in the monarchies of Europe. See Casaubon and Salmasius, ad Hist. August. p. 253.</NOTE> he intrusted with the govern∣ment of the city. In the room of the Praetorian praefect, whom he put to death, Carinus substi∣tuted one of the ministers of his looser pleasures. Another who possessed the same, or even a more infamous, title to favour, was invested with the consulship. A confidential secretary, who had
<PB N="100" REF="115"/>
acquired uncommon skill in the art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own consent, from the irksome duty of signing his name.</P>
<P>When the emperor Carus undertook the Per∣sian war, he was induced, by motives of affection as well as policy, to secure the fortunes of his family, by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the armies and provinces of the West. The in∣telligence which he soon received of the conduct of Carinus, filled him with shame and regret; nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the republic by a severe act of justice, and of adopting, in the place of an unworthy son, the brave and virtuous Constantius, who at that time was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation of Constantius was for a while deferred; and as soon as the father's death had released Carinus from the controul of fear or decency, he displayed to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 253, 254. Eutropius, ix. 19. Victor Junior. The reign of Diocletian indeed was so long and prosperous, that it must have been very unfavourable to the repu∣tation of Carinus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The only merit of the administration of Cari∣nus that history could record or poetry celebrate, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He cele∣brates the Roman games.</NOTE> was the uncommon splendour with which, in his own and his brother's name, he exhibited the Roman games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre. More than twenty years after∣wards, when the courtiers of Diocletian repre∣sented to their frugal sovereign the fame and po∣pularity
<PB N="101" REF="116"/>
of his munificent predecessor, he ac∣knowledged, that the reign of Carinus had in∣deed been a reign of pleasure <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 254. He calls him Carus, but the sense is sufficiently obvious, and the words were often con∣founded.</NOTE>. But this vain prodigality, which the prudence of Diocletian might justly despise, was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the Roman people. The oldest of the citizens, recollecting the spectacles of for∣mer days, the triumphal pomp of Probus or Au∣relian, and the secular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged that they were all surpassed by the superior magnificence of Carinus <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">See Calphurnius, Eclog. vii. 43. We may observe, that the spectacles of Probus were still recent, and that the poet is seconded by the historian.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The spectacles of Carinus may therefore be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spectacles of Rome.</NOTE> best illustrated by the observation of some parti∣culars, which history has condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors. If we con∣fine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts, however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of the execution, we are obliged to confess, that neither before nor since the time of the Romans, so much art and expence have ever been lavished for the amusement of the people <NOTE N="85" PLACE="foot">The philosopher Montaigne (Essais, l. iii. 6.) gives a very just and lively view of Roman magnificence in these spectacles.</NOTE>. By the order of Probus, a great quan∣tity of large trees, torn up by the roots, were transplanted into the midst of the circus. The spacious and shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches, a thousand stags, a
<PB N="102" REF="117"/>
thousand fallow deer, and a thousand wild boars; and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude. The tragedy of the succeeding day consisted in the massacre of an hundred lions, an equal number of lionesses, two hundred leopards, and three hundred bears <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 240.</NOTE>. The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his triumph, and which his successor exhibited in the secular games, was less remarkable by the number than by the singu∣larity of the animals. Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty to the eyes of the Roman people <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">They are called <HI>Onagri;</HI> but the number is too inconsiderable for mere wild-asses. Cuper (de Elephantis Exercitat. ii. 7.) has proved from Oppian, Dion, and an anonymous Greek, that zebras had been seen at Rome. They were brought from some island of the ocean, perhaps Madagascar.</NOTE>. Ten elks, and as many camelopards, the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander over the plains of Sarma∣tia and Aethiopia, were contrasted with thirty African hyaenas, and ten Indian tygers, the most implacable savages of the torrid zone. The un∣offending strength with which Nature has en∣dowed the greater quadrupeds, was admired in the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Carinus gave an hippopotamus (see Calphurn. Eclog. vii. 66.).

While the populace gazed with stupid wonder on
<PB N="103" REF="118"/>
the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed observe the figure and properties of so many dif∣ferent species, transported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre of Rome. But this accidental benefit, which science might derive from folly, is surely insufficient to justify such a wanton abuse of the public riches. There occurs, however, a single instance in the first Punic war, in which the senate wisely connected this amusement of the multitude with the interest of the state. A considerable number of ele∣phants, taken in the defeat of the Carthaginian army, were driven through the circus by a few slaves, armed only with blunt javelins <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Natur. viii. 6. from the annals of Piso.</NOTE>. The useful spectacle served to impress the Roman sol∣dier with a just contempt for those unwieldy ani∣mals; and he no longer dreaded to encounter them in the ranks of war.</P>
<P>The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts, was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The am∣phitheatre.</NOTE> conducted with a magnificence suitable to a peo∣ple who styled themselves the masters of the world; nor was the edifice appropriated to that entertainment less expressive of Roman greatness.

It was a building of an elliptic figure, five hundred and sixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and sixty-seven in breadth, founded on fourscore arches, and rising, with four successive orders of architecture, to the height of one hundred and

It reached almost to the heavens, according to Calphurnius (Eclog. vii. 23.), and surpassed the ken of human sight, according to Ammianus Marcellinus (xvi. 10.). Yet how trifling to the great pyramid of Egypt, which rises 500 feet perpendicular!</NOTE>. The outside of the edifice was en∣crusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The slopes of the vast concave, which formed the inside, were filled and surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats of marble likewise, co∣vered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease above fourscore thousand spectators <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot">According to different copies of Victor, we read 77,000, or 87,000 spectators; but Maffei (l. ii. c. 12.) finds room on the open sents for no more than 34,000.

Sixty-four <HI>vomitories</HI> (for by that name the doors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth the immense multitude; and the entrances, passages, and stair-cases, were contrived with such exqui∣site skill, that each person, whether of the sena∣torial, the equestrian, or the plebeian order, ar∣rived at his destined place without trouble or confusion <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">See Maffei, l. ii. c. 5—12.

of the edifice, the <HI>arena,</HI> or stage, was strewed with the finest sand, and successively assumed the most different forms. At one moment it seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns of Thrace.

In the decoration of these scenes, the Roman emperors displayed their wealth and liberality; and we read on various occasions, that the whole furniture of the amphi∣theatre consisted either of silver, or of gold, or of amber <NOTE N="96" PLACE="foot">Consult.

The poet who describes the games of Carinus, in the character of a shepherd at∣tracted to the capital by the fame of their magni∣ficence, affirms, that the nets designed as a de∣fence against the wild beasts, were of gold wire; that the porticoes were gilded, and that the <HI>belt</HI> or circle which divided the several ranks of spec∣tators from each other, was studded with a pre∣cious Mosaic of beautiful stones <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">Balteus en gemmis, en in lita porticus auro.

<P>In the midst of this glittering pageantry, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 284. Sept. 12.</NOTE> emperor Carinus, secure of his fortune, enjoyed

the acclamations of the people, the flattery of his courtiers, and the songs of the poets, who, for want of a more essential merit, were reduced to celebrate the divine graces of his person <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">Et Martis vultus et Apollinis esse putavi, says Calphurnius; but John Malela, who had perhaps seen pictures of Carinus, de∣scribes him as thick, short, and white, tom. i. p. 403.</NOTE>.

<P>The sons of Carus never saw each other after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of Numerian with the army from Persia.</NOTE> their father's death.

It is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the administration, or the provinces, of the empire; but it is very unlikely that their union would have proved of any long duration. The jealousy of power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters. In the most corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian deserved to reign in a happier period. His affable manners and gentle virtues secured him, as soon as they became known, the regard and affections of the public. He possessed
<PB N="107" REF="122"/>
the elegant accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as adorn the humblest and the most exalted station. His eloquence, how∣ever it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on the model of Cicero, as on that of the modern declaimers; but in an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit, he contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his contemporaries, and still remained the friend of his rivals; a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or the superiority of his genius <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">He won all the crowns from Nemesianus, with whom he vied in didactic poetry. The senate eracted a statue to the son of Carus, with a very ambiguous inscription, <Q>To the most powerful of ora∣tors.</Q> See Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 251.</NOTE>. But the talents of Numerian were rather of the contemplative, than of the ac∣tive kind. When his father's elevation reluc∣tantly forced him from the shade of retirement, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him for the command of armies. His constitu∣tion was destroyed by the hardships of the Per∣sian war; and he had contracted, from the heat of the climate <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">A more natural cause, at least, than that assigned by Vopis∣cus (Hist. August. p. 251.), incessantly weeping for his father's death.</NOTE>, such a weakness in his eyes, as obliged him, in the course of a long retreat, to confine himself to the solitude and darkness of a tent or litter. The administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was devolved on Arrius Aper, the Praetorian praefect, who, to the power of his important office, added the honour of be∣ing father-in-law to Numerian. The Imperial
<PB N="108" REF="123"/>
pavilion was strictly guarded by his most trusty adherents; and during many days, Aper deli∣vered to the army the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">In the Persian war, Aper was suspected of a design to betray Carus. Hist. August. p. 250.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was not till eight months after the death of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Numerian.</NOTE> Carus, that the Roman army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the Tigris, arrived on those of the Thracian Bosphorus. The le∣gions halted at Chalcedon in Asia, while the court passed over to Heraclea, on the European side of the Propontis <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">We are obliged to the Alexandrian Chronicle, p. 274, for the knowledge of the time and place where Diocletian was elected emperor.</NOTE>. But a report soon cir∣culated through the camp, at first in secret whis∣pers, and at length in loud clamours, of the em∣peror's death, and of the presumption of his ambitious minister, who still exercised the sove∣reign power in the name of a prince who was no more. The impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of suspense. With rude curiosity they broke into the Imperial tent, and discovered only the corpse of Numerian <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 251. Eutrop. ix. 88. Hieronym. in Chron. According to these <HI>judicious</HI> writers, the death of Numerian was dis∣covered by the stench of his dead body. Could no aromatics be found in the Imperial household?</NOTE>. The gradual decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his death was natural; but the concealment was interpreted as an evidence of guilt, and the measures which Aper had taken to secure his election, became the immediate
<PB N="109" REF="124"/>
occasion of his ruin. Yet, even in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops observed a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly dis∣cipline had been re-established by the martial successors of Gallienus. A general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at Chalcedon, whither Aper was transported in chains, as a prisoner and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the camp, and the gene∣rals and tribunes formed a great military council. They soon announced to the multitude, that their <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 284. Sept. 17.</NOTE> choice had fallen on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or body-guards, as the person the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Election of the empe∣ror Diocle∣tian.</NOTE> most capable of revenging and succeeding their beloved emperor. The future fortunes of the candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour. Conscious that the station which he had filled, exposed him to some suspi∣cions, Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and rais∣ing his eyes towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own innocence, in the presence of that all-seeing Deity <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Aurel. Victor. Eutropius, ix. 20. Hieronym. in Chron.</NOTE>. Then, assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge, he commanded that Aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal. <Q>This man, said he, is the murderer of Numerian;</Q> and, without giving him time to enter on a dangerous justifi∣cation, drew his sword, and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate praefect. A charge supported by such decisive proof, was admitted without contradiction, and the legions, with re∣peated
<PB N="110" REF="125"/>
acclamations, acknowledged the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian <NOTE N="107" PLACE="foot">Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 252. The reason why Diocle∣tian killed <HI>Aper</HI> (a wild boar), was founded on a prophecy and a pun, as foolish as they are well known.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before we enter upon the memorable reign of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat and death of Carinus.</NOTE> that prince, it will be proper to punish and dis∣miss the unworthy brother of Numerian. Ca∣rinus possessed arms and treasures sufficient to support his legal title to the empire. But his personal vices overbalanced every advantage of birth and situation. The most faithful servants of the father despised the incapacity, and dreaded the cruel arrogance, of the son. The hearts of the people were engaged in favour of his rival, and even the senate was inclined to prefer an usurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian in∣flamed the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret intrigues, and open pre∣parations for a civil war. In the spring, the forces of the East and of the West encountered <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 285.

<P>AS the reign of Diocletian was more illus∣trious than that of any of his predecessors, so was his birth more abject and obscure. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elevation and cha∣racter of Diocleti∣an.</NOTE> The strong claims of merit and of violence had frequently superseded the ideal prerogatives of nobility; but a distinct line of separation was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 285.</NOTE> hitherto preserved between the free and the ser∣vile part of mankind. The parents of Diocle∣tian had been slaves in the house of Anulinus, a Roman senator; nor was he himself distin∣guished by any other name, than that which he derived from a small town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother deduced her origin <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Eutrop. ix. 19.

Antiqua, tom. i. p. 393.); and the original name of the fortunate slave was probably Docles; he first length∣ened it to the Grecian harmony of Diocles, and at length to the Roman majesty of Diocletianus. He likewise assumed the Patrician name of Valerius, and it is usually given him by Aurelius Victor.</NOTE>. It is, however, probable, that his father obtained the freedom of the family, and that he soon acquired an office of scribe, which was commonly exer∣cised

Favourable oracles, or rather the consciousness of superior merit, prompted his aspiring son to pursue the profession of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be extremely curious to observe the gradation of arts and accidents which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles, and to dis∣play that merit to the world. Diocletian was successively promoted to the government of Mae∣sia, the honours of the consulship, and the im∣portant command of the guards of the palace. He distinguished his abilities in the Persian war; and, after the death of Numerian, the slave, by the confession and judgment of his rivals, was declared the most worthy of the Imperial throne. The malice of religious zeal, whilst it arraigns the savage fierceness of his colleague Maximian, has affected to cast suspicions on the personal courage of the emperor Diocletian <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lactantius (or whoever was the author of the little treatise De Mortibus Persecutorum) accuses Diocletian of <HI>timidity</HI> in two places, c. 7, 8. In chap. 9, he says of him, "erat in omni tumultu meti∣culosus et animi disjectus."</NOTE>. It would not be easy to persuade us of the cowardice of a soldier of fortune, who acquired and preserved the esteem of the legions, as well as the favour of so many warlike princes. Yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to attack the most vulnerable part. The valour of Dio∣cletian was never found inadequate to his duty or to the occasion; but he appears not to have
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
possessed the daring and generous spirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame, disdains artifice, and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were useful rather than splendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the experience and study of mankind; dexterity and application in business; a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, of mildness and rigour; profound dissimulation under the disguise of military frank∣ness; steadiness to pursue his ends; flexibility to vary his means; and above all, the great art of submitting his own passions, as well as those of others, to the interest of his ambition, and of colouring his ambition with the most specious pretences of justice and public utility. Like Augustus, Diocletian may be considered as the founder of a new empire. Like the adopted son of Caesar, he was distinguished as a statesman rather than as a warrior; nor did either of those princes employ force, whenever their purpose could be effected by policy.</P>
<P>The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for <NOTE PLACE="marg">His cle∣mency and victory.</NOTE> its singular mildness. A people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror, if the usual punishments of death, exile, and confis∣cation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity, beheld, with the most pleasing asto∣nishment, a civil war, the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle. Diocletian received into his confidence Aristobulus, the principal minister of the house of Carus, respect∣ed the lives, the fortunes, and the dignity of his adversaries, and even continued in their respec∣tive
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
stations the greater number of the servants of Carinus <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">In this encomium, Aurelius Victor seems to convey a just, though indirect, censure of the cruelty of Constantius. It appears from the Fasti, that Aristobulus remained praefect of the city, and that he ended with Diocletian, the consulship which he had com∣menced with Carinus.</NOTE>. It is not improbable that motives of prudence might assist the humanity of the art∣ful Dalmatian; of these servants, many had pur∣chased his favour by secret treachery; in others, he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfor∣tunate master. The discerning judgment of Au∣relian, of Probus, and of Carus, had filled the several departments of the state and army with officers of approved merit, whose removal would have injured the public service, without promot∣ing the interest of the successor. Such a con∣duct, however, displayed to the Roman world the fairest prospect of the new reign, and the emperor affected to confirm this favourable pre∣possession, by declaring, that, among all the vir∣tues of his predecessors, he was the most ambi∣tious of imitating the humane philosophy of Marcus Antoninus <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor styles Diocletian, "Parentem potius quam Dominum." See Hist. August. p. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The first considerable action of his reign seem∣ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Associati∣on and character of Maxi∣mian.</NOTE> to evince his sincerity as well as his modera∣tion. After the example of Marcus, he gave himself a colleague in the person of Maximian, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D 286.

I have followed M. de Tillemont (Histoire des Empereurs, tom, iv. p. 500—505.), who has weighed the several reasons and difficulties with his scrupulous accuracy.</NOTE>. But the
<PB N="116" REF="131"/>
motives of his conduct, as well as the object of his choice, were of a very different nature from those of his admired predecessor. By investing a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple, Marcus had discharged a debt of private grati∣tude, at the expence, indeed, of the happiness of the state. By associating a friend and a fel∣low-soldier to the labours of government, Dio∣cletian, in a time of public danger, provided for the defence both of the East and of the West. Maximian was born a peasant, and, like Aure∣lian, in the territory of Sirmium. Ignorant of letters <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In an oration delivered before him (Panegyr. Vet. ii. 8.), Ma∣mertinus expresses a doubt whether his hero, in imitating the con∣duct of Hannibal and Scipio, had ever heard of their names. From thence we may fairly infer, that Maximian was more desirous of being considered as a soldier than as a man of letters: and it is in this manner that we can often translate the language of flattery into that of truth.</NOTE>, careless of laws, the rusticity of his appearance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated fortune the meanness of his ex∣traction. War was the only art which he pro∣fessed. In a long course of service he had dis∣tinguished himself on every frontier of the em∣pire; and though his military talents were form∣ed to obey rather than to command, though, perhaps, he never attained the skill of a con∣summate general, he was capable, by his valour, constancy, and experience, of executing the most
<PB N="117" REF="132"/>
arduous undertakings. Nor were the vices of Maximian less useful to his benefactor. Insen∣sible to pity, and fearless of consequences, he was the ready instrument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once suggest and disclaim. As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been offered to prudence or to re∣venge, Diocletian, by his seasonable intercession, saved the remaining few whom he had never designed to punish, gently censured the severity of his stern colleague, and enjoyed the compa∣rison of a golden and an iron age, which was universally applied to their opposite maxims of government. Notwithstanding the difference of their characters, the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendship which they had contracted in a private station. The haughty turbulent spirit of Maximian, so fatal afterwards to himself and to the public peace, was accus∣tomed to respect the genius of Diocletian, and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

From a motive either of pride or superstition, the two emperors assumed the titles, the one of Jovius, the other of Herculius.

<P>But even the omnipotence of Jovius and Her∣culius <NOTE PLACE="marg">Associa∣tion of two Cae∣sars.</NOTE> was insufficient to sustain the weight of the public administration. The prudence of Diocletian discovered, that the empire, assailed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Galerius and Con∣stantius.</NOTE> on every side by the barbarians, required on every side the presence of a great army, and of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

In describing the country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have already delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly, styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances both of virtue and ability, he appears to have possessed a manifest superiority over the elder. The birth of Constantius was less obscure
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his fa∣ther, was one of the most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of the emperor Claudius <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Julian, the grandson of Constantius, boasts that his family was derived from the warlike Maesians. Misopogon, p. 348. The Dardanians dwelt on the edge of Maesia.</NOTE>. Although the youth of Constantius had been spent in arms, he was en∣dowed with a mild and amiable disposition, and the popular voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained. To strengthen the bonds of political, by those of domestic union, each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of the Caesars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to Con∣stantius; and each obliging them to repudiate their former wives, bestowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted son <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Galerius married Valeria, the daughter of Diocletian; if we speak with strictness, Theodora, the wife of Constantius, was daugh∣ter only to the wife of Maximian.

Italy and Africa were considered as the department of Maximian; and for his pecu∣liar portion, Diocletian reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich countries of Asia. Every one was sovereign within his own jurisdiction; but their
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
united authority extended over the whole mo∣narchy; and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues with his counsels or presence. The Caesars, in their exalted rank, revered the majesty of the emperors, and the three younger princes invariably acknowledged, by their gra∣titude and obedience, the common parent of their fortunes. The suspicious jealousy of power found not any place among them; and the sin∣gular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus of music, whose harmony was regu∣lated and maintained by the skilful hand of the first artist <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Julian in Caesarib. p. 315.

<P>This important measure was not carried into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Series of events.</NOTE> execution till about six years after the association of Maximian, and that interval of time had not been destitute of memorable incidents. But we have preferred, for the sake of perspicuity, first to describe the more perfect form of Diocletian's government, and afterwards to relate the actions of his reign, following rather the natural order of the events, than the dates of a very doubtful chronology.</P>
<P>The first exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few words by our imperfect wri∣ters, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 287. State of the peasants of Gaul.</NOTE> deserves, from its singularity, to be record∣ed in a history of human manners. He sup∣pressed the peasants of Gaul, who, under the
<PB N="121" REF="136"/>
appellation of Bagaudae <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">The general name of <HI>Bagaudae</HI> (in the signification of Rebels) continued till the fifth century in Gaul. Some critics derive it from a Celtic word <HI>Bagad,</HI> a tumultuous assembly. Scaliger ad Eu∣seb.

The <HI>nai∣veté</HI> of his story is lost in our best modern writers.</NOTE>. It should seem, that very many of those institutions, referred by an easy solution to the feudal system, are derived from the Celtic barbarians. When Caesar sub∣dued the Gauls, that great nation was already divided into three orders of men; the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The first governed by superstition, the second by arms, but the third and last was not of any weight or account in their public councils. It was very natural for the Plebeians, oppressed by debt, or apprehensive of injuries, to implore the protec∣tion of some powerful chief, who acquired over their persons and property, the same absolute rights as, among the Greeks and Romans, a master exercised over his slaves <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Caesar de Bell. Gallic. vi. 13. Orgetorix, the Helvetian, could arm for his defence a body of ten thousand slaves.</NOTE>. The greatest part of the nation was gradually reduced into a state of servitude; compelled to perpetual labour on the estates of the Gallic nobles, and confined to the soil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the no less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws. During the long series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of Gal∣lienus
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
to that of Diocletian, the condition of these servile peasants was peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once the complicated tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of the soldiers, and of the officers of the revenue <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Their oppression and misery are acknowledged by Eumenius (Panegyr. vi. 8.), Gallias efferatus injuriis.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their patience was at last provoked into de∣spair. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their re∣bellion,</NOTE> On every side they rose in multitudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with irresistible fury. The ploughman became a foot soldier, the shepherd mounted on horseback, the deserted villages and open towns were abandoned to the flames, and the ravages of the peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Panegyr. Vet. ii. 4. Aurelius Victor.</NOTE>. They asserted the natural rights of men, but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty. The Gal∣lic nobles justly dreading their revenge, either took refuge in the fortified cities, or fled from the wild seene of anarchy. The peasants reign∣ed without controul; and two of their most daring leaders had the folly and rashness to assume the Imperial ornaments <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Aelianus and Amandus. We have medals coined by them. Goltzius in Thes. R. A. p. 117. 121.</NOTE>. Their power soon expired at the approach of the legions.

A severe retaliation was inflicted <NOTE PLACE="marg">and chas∣tisement.</NOTE> on the peasants who were found in arms: the affrighted remnant returned to their respective

So strong and uniform is the current of popular passions, that we might almost venture, from very scanty materials, to relate the particulars of this war; but we are not disposed to believe that the principal leaders Aelianus and Amandus were Christians <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">The fact rests indeed on very slight authority, a life of St. Ba∣bolinus, which is probably of the seventh century.

Francicar. tom. i. p. 662.</NOTE>, or to insinuate, that the rebel∣lion, as [it] happened in the time of Luther, was occasioned by the abuse of those benevolent principles of Christianity, which inculcate the natural freedom of mankind.</P>
<P>Maximian had no sooner recovered Gaul from <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 287.</NOTE> the hands of the peasants, than he lost Britain by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Carausius in Britain.</NOTE> the usurpation of Carausius. Ever since the rash but successful enterprise of the Franks under the reign of Probus, their daring countrymen had constructed squadrons of light brigantines, in which they incessantly ravaged the provinces adjacent to the ocean <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor calls them Germans. Eutropius (ix. 21.) gives them the name of Saxons. But Eutropius lived in the ensu∣ing century, and seems to use the language of his own times.</NOTE>. To repel their desul∣tory incursions, it was found necessary to create a naval power; and the judicious measure was prosecuted with prudence and vigour. Gessoria∣cum, or Boulogne, in the straights of the British channel, was chosen by the emperor for the sta∣tion of the Roman fleet; and the command of it was intrusted to Carausius, a Menapian of the
<PB N="124" REF="139"/>
meanest origin <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">The three expressions of Eutropius, Aurelius Victor, and Eu∣menius, "vilissime natus," "Bataviae alumnus," and "Menapiae civis," give us a very doubtful account of the birth of Carausius. Dr. Stukely, however, (Hist. of Carausius, p. 62.) chuses to make him a native of St. David's, and a prince of the blood royal of Britain. The former idea he had found in Richard of Cirencester, p. 44.</NOTE>, but who had long signalized his skill as a pilot, and his valour as a soldier. The integrity of the new admiral corresponded not with his abilities. When the German pi∣rates sailed from their own harbours, he con∣nived at their passage, but he diligently inter∣cepted their return, and appropriated to his own use an ample share of the spoil which they had acquired. The wealth of Carausius was, on this occasion, very justly considered as an evi∣dence of his guilt; and Maximian had already given orders for his death. But the crafty Me∣napian foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor. By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and secured the barbarians in his interest. From the port of Boulogne he sailed over to Britain, persuaded the legion, and the auxiliaries which guarded that island, to embrace his party, and boldly assuming, with the Imperial purple, the title of Augustus, defied the justice and the arms of his injured sovereign <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Panegyr. v. 12. Britain at this time was secure, and slightly guarded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When Britain was thus dismembered from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Import∣ance of Britain.</NOTE> empire, its importance was sensibly felt, and its loss sincerely lamented. The Romans celebrated,
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
and perhaps magnified, the extent of that noble island, provided on every side with convenient harbours; the temperature of the climate, and the fertility of the soil, alike adapted for the production of corn or of vines; the valuable minerals with which it abounded; its rich pas∣tures covered with innumerable flocks, and its woods free from wild beasts or venomous ser∣pents. Above all, they regretted the large amount of the revenue of Britain, whilst they confessed, that such a province well deserved to become the seat of an independent monarchy <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Panegyr. Vet. v. 11. vii. 9. The orator Eumenius wished to exalt the glory of the hero (Constantius), with the importance of the conquest.

A century and half before, it hardly paid its own establishment. See Appian in Proaem.</NOTE>. During the space of seven years, it was possessed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Power of Carausius,</NOTE> by Carausius; and fortune continued propitious to a rebellion, supported with courage and abi∣lity. The British emperor defended the frontiers of his dominions against the Caledonians of the North, invited, from the continent, a great number of skilful artists, and displayed, on a variety of coins that are still extant, his taste and opulence. Born on the confines of the Franks, he courted the friendship of that for∣midable people, by the flattering imitation of their dress and manners. The bravest of their youth he enlisted among his land or sea forces; and in return for their useful alliance, he com∣municated to the barbarians the dangerous know∣ledge
<PB N="126" REF="141"/>
of military and naval arts. Carausius still preserved the possession of Boulogne and the ad∣jacent country. His fleets rode triumphant in the channel, commanded the mouths of the Seine and of the Rhine, ravaged the coasts of the ocean, and diffused beyond the columns of Her∣cules the terror of his name. Under his com∣mand, Britain, destined in a future age to ob∣tain the empire of the sea, already assumed its natural and respectable station of a maritime power <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">As a great number of medals of Carausius are still preserved, he is become a very favourite object of antiquarian curiosity, and every circumstance of his life and actions has been investigated with sagacious accuracy.

But the adoption of the two Caesars restored new vigour to the Roman arms; and while the Rhine was guarded by the presence of Maximian, his brave associate Constantius assum∣ed the conduct of the British war. His first enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne. A stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the harbour, intercepted all hopes of relief. The town surrendered after an obstinate <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 292.</NOTE> defence; and a considerable part of the naval strength of Carausius fell into the hands of the besiegers. During the three years which Con∣stantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest of Britain, he secured the coast of Gaul, invaded the country of the Franks, and deprived the usurper of the assistance of those powerful allies.</P>
<P>Before the preparations were finished, Con∣stantius <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 294.</NOTE> received the intelligence of the tyrant's <NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> death, and it was considered as a sure presage of the approaching victory. The servants of Ca∣rausius imitated the example of treason, which he had given. He was murdered by his first minister Alectus, and the assassin succeeded to his power and to his danger. But he possessed not equal abilities either to exercise the one, or to repel the other. He beheld, with anxious terror, the opposite shores of the continent, al∣ready filled with arms, with troops, and with
<PB N="128" REF="143"/>
vessels; for Constantius had very prudently di∣vided his forces, that he might likewise divide the attention and resistance of the enemy. The attack was at length made by the principal squa∣dron, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 296.</NOTE> which, under the command of the praefect <NOTE PLACE="marg">Recovery of Britain by Con∣stantius.</NOTE> Asclepiodatus, an officer of distinguished merit, had been assembled in the mouth of the Seine. So imperfect in those times was the art of navi∣gation, that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans, who ventured to set sail with a side-wind, and on a stormy day. The weather proved favourable to their enterprise. Under the cover of a thick fog, they escaped the fleet of Alectus, which had been stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them, landed in safety on some part of the western coast, and convinced the Britons, that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a fo∣reign invasion. Asclepiodatus had no sooner dis∣embarked the Imperial troops, than he set fire to his ships; and, as the expedition proved for∣tunate, his heroic conduct was universally ad∣mired. The usurper had posted himself near London, to expect the formidable attack of Con∣stantius, who commanded in person the fleet of Boulogne; but the descent of a new enemy required his immediate presence in the West. He performed this long march in so precipitate a manner, that he encountered the whole force of the praefect with a small body of harassed and disheartened troops. The engagement was soon terminated by the total defeat and death of
<PB N="129" REF="144" MS="y"/>
Allectus; a single battle, as it has often hap∣pened, decided the fate of this great island; and when Constantius landed on the shores of Kent, he found them covered with obedient subjects. Their acclamations were loud and unanimous; and the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe, that they sincerely rejoiced in a revo∣lution, which, after a separation of ten years, restored Britain to the body of the Roman em∣pire <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">With regard to the recovery of Britain, we obtain a few hints from Aurelius Victor and Eutropius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Britain had none but domestic enemies to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defence of the fron∣tiers.</NOTE> dread; and as long as the governors preserved their fidelity, and the troops their discipline, the incursions of the naked savages of Scotland or Ireland could never materially affect the safety of the province. The peace of the con∣tinent, and the defence of the principal rivers which bounded the empire, were objects of far greater difficulty and importance. The policy of Diocletian, which inspired the councils of his associates, provided for the public tranquillity, by encouraging a spirit of dissention among the barbarians, and by strengthening the fortifica∣tions of the Roman limit. In the East he fixed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortifica∣tions.</NOTE> a line of camps of Egypt to the Persian domi∣nions, and, for every camp, he instituted an adequate number of stationary troops, command∣ed by their respective officers, and supplied with every kind of arms, from the new arsenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emesa, and Damas∣cus <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">John Malela, in Chron. Antiochen, tom. i. p. 408, 409.</NOTE>.
<PB N="130" REF="145"/>
Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the well-known valour of the barbarians of Europe. From the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and citadels, were diligently re∣established, and, in the most exposed places, new ones were skilfully constructed; the strictest vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier, and every expedient was practised that could render the long chain of fortifications firm and impenetrable <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. i. p. 3.

Panegyr. Vet. iv. 18.</NOTE>. A barrier so respect∣able was seldom violated, and the barbarians often turned against each other their disappointed rage. The Goths, the Vandals, the Gepidae, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissentions of the bar∣barians.</NOTE> the Burgundians, the Alemanni, wasted each others strength by destructive hostilities, and whosoever vanquished, they vanquished the ene∣mies of Rome.

years, and along a frontier of many hundred miles. Sometimes the barbarians suspended their domestic animosities, and the relaxed vigi∣lance of the garrisons sometimes gave a passage to their strength or dexterity. Whenever the provinces were invaded, Diocletian conducted himself with that calm dignity which he always affected or possessed; reserved his presence for such occasions as were worthy of his interposition, never exposed his person or reputation to any unnecessary danger, ensured his success by every means that prudence could suggest, and display∣ed, with ostentation, the consequences of his vic∣tory. In wars of a more difficult nature, and more doubtful event, he employed the rough valour of Maximian, and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to the wise counsels and auspicious influence of his benefactor. But after the adoption of the two Caesars, the emperors themselves retiring to a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Valour of the Caesars.</NOTE> less laborious scene of action, devolved on their adopted sons the defence of the Danube and of the Rhine.

have been actions of considerable danger and merit. As he traversed the open country with a feeble guard, he was encompassed on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy. He retreated with difficulty towards Langres; but, in the general consternation, the citizens refused to open their gates, and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope. But on the news of his distress, the Roman troops hastened from all sides to his relief, and before the evening he had satisfied his honour and re∣venge by the slaughter of six thousand Ale∣manni <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">In the Greek text of Eusebius, we read six thousand, a num∣ber which I have preferred to the sixty thousand of Jerome, Orosius, Eutropius, and his Greek translator Paeanius.</NOTE>.

<P>The conduct which the emperor Probus had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Treatment of the bar∣barians.</NOTE> adopted in the disposal of the vanquished, was imitated by Diocletian and his associates.

of arms, except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the military service. Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands, with a less servile tenure, to such of the barbarians as solicited the protection of Rome. They granted a settlement to several colonies of the Carpi, the Bastarnae, and the Sarmatians; and, by a dan∣gerous indulgence, permitted them in some mea∣sure to retain their national manners and inde∣pendence <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">There was a settlement of the Sarmatians in the neighbourhood of Treves, which seems to have been deserted by those lazy Barba∣rians: Ausonius speaks of them in his Moselle.

The cha∣racter of the Egyptian nation, insensible to kind∣ness, but extremely susceptible of fear, could alone justify this excessive rigour. The seditions of Alexandria had often affected the tranquillity and subsistence of Rome itself. Since the usurp∣ation of Firmus, the province of Upper Egypt, incessantly relapsing into rebellion, had embraced the alliance of the savages of Aechiopia. The number of the Blemmyes, scattered between the island of Meroe and the Red Sea, was very in∣considerable, their disposition was unwarlike, their weapons rude and inoffensive <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. xvii. p. 1. 172.

Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while the attention of the state was engaged in more serious wars, their vexatious inroads might again harass the repose of the province. With a view of opposing to the Blemmyes a suitable adversary, Diocletian persuaded the Nobatae, or people of Nubia, to remove from their ancient habitations in the de∣serts of Lybia, and resigned to them an exten∣sive but unprofitable territory above Syene and the cataracts of the Nile, with the stipulation, that they should ever respect and guard the fron∣tier of the empire. The treaty long subsisted; and till the establishment of Christianity intro∣duced stricter notions of religious worship, it was annually ratified by a solemn sacrifice in the isle of Elephantine, in which the Romans, as well as the barbarians, adored the same visible or invi∣sible powers of the universe <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">See Procopius de Bell.

It is much more likely, that his good sense discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions, and that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his subjects from the mischievous <NOTE PLACE="marg">Novelty and pro∣gress of that art.</NOTE> pursuit. It may be remarked, that these ancient books, so liberally ascribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more recent adepts. The Greeks were inat∣tentive either to the use or to the abuse of chy∣mistry. In that immense register, where Pliny has deposited the discoveries, the arts, and the errors of mankind, there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals; and the persecu∣tion of Diocletian is the first authentic event in the history of alchymy. The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs diffused that vain science over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of the human heart, it was studied in China as in Europe, with
<PB N="138" REF="153"/>
equal eagerness, and with equal success. The darkness of the middle ages ensured a favourable reception to every tale of wonder, and the re∣vival of learning gave new vigour to hope, and suggested more specious arts of deception. Phi∣losophy, with the aid of experience, has at length banished the study of alchymy; and the present age, however desirous of riches, is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">See a short history and confutation of Alchymy, in the works of that philosophical compiler, La Mothe le Vayer, tom. i. p. 327-353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The reduction of Egypt was immediately fol∣lowed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per∣sian war.</NOTE> by the Persian war. It was reserved for the reign of Diocletian to vanquish that powerful nation, and to extort a confession from the suc∣cessors of Artaxerxes, of the superior majesty of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>We have observed under the reign of Valerian, that Armenia was subdued by the perfidy and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiridates the Arme∣nian.</NOTE> arms of the Persians, and that, after the assassi∣nation of Chosroes, his son Tiridates, the infant heir of the monarchy, was saved by the fidelity of his friends, and educated under the protection of the emperors. Tiridates derived from his exile such advantages as he could never have obtained on the throne of Armenia; the early knowledge of adversity, of mankind, and of the Roman discipline. He signalized his youth by deeds of valour, and displayed a matchless dex∣terity, as well as strength, in every martial ex∣ercise, and even in the less honourable contests

of the Olympian games <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">See the education and strength of Tiridates in the Armenian history of Moses of Chorene, l. ii. c. 76. He could seize two wild bulls by the horns, and break them off with his hands.</NOTE>. Those qualities were more nobly exerted in the defence of his bene∣factor Licinius <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">If we give credit to the younger Victor, who supposes that in the year 323, Licinius was only sixty years of age, he could scarcely be the same person as the patron of Tiridates; but we know from much better authority (Euseb. Hist. Ecclesiast. l. x. c. 8.), that Licinius was at that time in the last period of old age: sixteen years before, he is represented with grey hairs, and as the contemporary of Galerius. See Lactant. c. 32. Licinius was probably born about the year 250.</NOTE>. That officer, in the sedition <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 282.</NOTE> which occasioned the death of Probus, was ex∣posed to the most imminent danger, and the en∣raged soldiers were forcing their way into his tent, when they were checked by the single arm of the Armenian prince. The gratitude of Ti∣ridates contributed soon afterwards to his restora∣tion. I icinius was in every station the friend and companion of Galerius, and the merit of Galerius, long before he was raised to the dignity of Caesar, had been known and esteemed by Dio∣cletian. In the third year of that emperor's reign, Tiridates was invested with the kingdom of Armenia. The justice of the measure was not less evident than its expediency. It was time to rescue from the usurpation of the Persian mo∣narch an important territory, which, since the reign of Nero, had been always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the house of Arsaces <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">See the sixty-second and sixty-third books of Dion Cassius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="155"/>
When Tiridates appeared on the frontiers of Armenia, he was received with an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty. During twenty-six <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 286.</NOTE> years, the country had experienced the real and <NOTE PLACE="marg">His resto∣ration to the throne of Arme∣nia.</NOTE> imaginary hardships of a foreign yoke. The Persian monarchs adorned their new conquest with magnificent buildings; but those monu∣ments had been erected at the expence of the people, and were abhorred as badges of slavery. The apprehension of a revolt had inspired the most rigorous precautions: oppression had been <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the coun∣try.</NOTE> aggravated by insult, and the consciousness of the public hatred had been productive of every measure that could render it still more impla∣cable. We have already remarked the intolerant spirit of the Magian religion. The statues of the deified kings of Armenia, and the sacred images of the sun and moon, were broke in pieces by the zeal of the conqueror; and the perpetual fire of Ormuzd was kindled and preserved upon an altar erected on the summit of mount Bagavan <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">Moses of Chorene, Hist. Armen. l. ii. c. 74. The statues had been erected by Valarsaces, who reigned in Armenia about 130 years before Christ, and was the first king of the family of Arsaces (see Moses Hist. Armen. l. ii. 2, 3.). The deification of the Arsa∣cides is mentioned by Justin (xli. 5.) and by Ammianus Marcel∣linus (xxiii. 6.).</NOTE>. It was natural, that a people exasperated by so many injuries, should arm with zeal in the cause <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of the people and no∣bles.</NOTE> of their independence, their religion, and their hereditary sovereign. The torrent bore down every obstacle, and the Persian garrisons retreated before its fury. The nobles of Armenia flew to

the standard of Tiridates, all alleging their past merit, offering their future service, and soliciting from the new king those honours and rewards from which they had been excluded with disdain under the foreign government <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">The Armenian nobility was numerous and powerful. Moses mentions many families which were distinguished under the reign of Valarsaces (l. ii. 7.), and which still subsisted in his own time, about the middle of the fifth century. See the preface of his Editors.</NOTE>. The command of the army was bestowed on Artavasdes, whose father had saved the infancy of Tiridates, and whose family had been massacred for that gene∣rous action. The brother of Artavasdes obtained the government of a province. One of the first military dignities was conferred on the fatrap Otas, a man of singular temperance and forti∣tude, who presented to the king, his sister <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">She was named Chosroiduchta, and had not the <HI>os patulum</HI> like other women.

In those ages the Chinese kept a garrison at Kashgar, and one of their generals, about the time of Trajan, marched as far as the Caspian sea. With regard to the in∣tercourse between China and the western countries, a curious me∣moir of M. de Guignes may be consulted, in the Academie des In∣scriptions, tom. xxxii. p. 355.</NOTE>. Having incurred the displeasure of his master, Mamgo, with his fol∣lowers, retired to the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection of Sapor. The emperor of China claimed the fugitive, and alleged the rights of sovereignty. The Persian monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality, and with some difficulty avoided a war, by the promise that he would banish Mamgo to the uttermost parts of the West; a punishment, as he described it, not less dreadful than death itself. Armenia was chosen for the place of exile, and a large district was assigned to the Scythian horde, on which they might feed their flocks and herds, and re∣move their encampment from one place to an∣other, according to the different seasons of the year. They were employed to repel the invasion of Tiridates; but their leader, after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had received from the Persian monarch, resolved to abandon his party. The Armenian prince, who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power of Mamgo, treated him with distinguished respect; and by admitting him into his confidence, ac∣quired
<PB N="143" REF="158"/>
a brave and faithful servant, who contri∣buted very effectually to his restoration <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">See Hist. Armen. l. ii. c. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>For a while, fortune appeared to favour the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per∣sians reco∣ver Arme∣nia.</NOTE> enterprising valour of Tiridates. He not only expelled the enemies of his family and country from the whole extent of Armenia, but in the prosecution of his revenge he carried his arms, or at least his incursions, into the heart of Assyria. The historian, who has preserved the name of Tiridates from oblivion, celebrates, with a de∣gree of national enthusiasm, his personal prowess; and, in the true spirit of eastern romance, de∣scribes the giants and the elephants that fell be∣neath his invincible arm. It is from other infor∣mation that we discover the distracted state of the Persian monarchy, to which the king of Armenia was indebted for some part of his advantages. The throne was disputed by the ambition of con∣tending brothers; and Hormuz, after exerting without success the strength of his own party, had recourse to the dangerous assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the Cas∣pian Sea <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Ipsos Persas ipsumque Regem ascitis Saccis, et Russis, et Gellis, petit frater Ormies.

The civil war was, however, soon terminated, either by a victory, or by a recon∣ciliation; and Narses, who was universally ac∣knowledged as king of Persia, directed his whole

force against the foreign enemy. The contest then became too unequal; nor was the valour of the hero able to withstand the power of the mo∣narch. Tiridates, a second time expelled from the throne of Armenia, once more took refuge in the court of the emperors. Narses soon re∣established his authority over the revolted pro∣vince; and loudly complaining of the protection afforded by the Romans to rebels and fugitives, aspired to the conquest of the East <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Moses of Chorene takes no notice of this second revolution, which I have been obliged to collect from a passage of Ammianus Marcellinus (l. xxiii. 5.).

<P>Neither prudence nor honour could permit the <NOTE PLACE="marg">War be∣tween the Persians and the Romans.</NOTE> emperors to forsake the cause of the Armenian king, and it was resolved to exert the force of the empire in the Persian war. Diocletian, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The conduct of the legions was intrusted to the intrepid valour of Galerius, who, for that important purpose, was removed from the banks of the Danube to those of the Euphrates. The armies soon encountered each other in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat of Galerius.</NOTE> plains of Mesopotamia, and two battles were fought with various and doubtful success: but the third engagement was of a more decisive na∣ture;
<PB N="145" REF="160"/>
and the Roman army received a total over∣throw, which is attributed to the rashness of Ga∣lerius, who, with an inconsiderable body of troops, attacked the innumerable host of the Persians <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">Our five abbreviators, Eutropius, Festus, the two Victors, and Orosius, all relate the last and great battle; but Orosius is the only one who speaks of the two former.</NOTE>. But the consideration of the country that was the scene of action, may suggest another reason for his defeat. The same ground on which Galerius was vanquished, had been rendered me∣morable by the death of Crassus, and the slaugh∣ter of ten legions. It was a plain of more than sixty miles, which extended from the hills of Carrhae to the Euphrates; a smooth and barren surface of sandy desert, without a hillock, with∣out a tree, and without a spring of fresh water <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">The nature of the country is finely described by Plutarch, in the life of Crassus, and by Xenophon, in the first book of the Ana∣basis.</NOTE>. The steady infantry of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirst, could neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their ranks without exposing themselves to the most immi∣nent danger. In this situation they were gradu∣ally encompassed by the superior numbers, ha∣rassed by the rapid evolutions, and destroyed by the arrows of the barbarian cavalry. The king of Armenia had signalized his valour in the battle, and acquired personal glory by the public mis∣fortune. He was pursued as far as the Eu∣phrates; his horse was wounded, and it appeared impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy.
<PB N="146" REF="161"/>
In this extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which he saw before him: he dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armour was heavy, the river very deep, and at those parts at least half a mile in breadth <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">See Foster's Dissertation in the second volume of the translation of the Anabasis by Spelman; which I will venture to recommend as one of the best versions extant.</NOTE>; yet such was his strength and dexterity, that he reached in safety the opposite bank <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Hist. Armen. l. ii. c. 76. I have transferred this exploit of Tiridates from an imaginary defeat to the real one of Galerius.</NOTE>. With regard to the Roman general, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape; but when he returned to Antioch, Diocletian received him, not with the tenderness <NOTE PLACE="marg">His recep∣tion by Diocle∣tian.</NOTE> of a friend and colleague, but with the indigna∣tion of an offended sovereign.

At the head of a chosen army of twenty-five thousand men, Galerius again passed the Euphrates; but, instead of exposing his legions in the open plains of Mesopotamia, he advanced through the mountains of Armenia, where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause, and the country as favourable to the ope∣rations of infantry, as it was inconvenient for the motions of cavalry <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor says, "Per Armeniam in hostes contendit, que ferme sola, seu facilior vincendi via est."

A surprize, especially in the night-time, was for the most part fatal to a Persian army. <Q>Their horses were tied, and generally shackled, to prevent their running away; and if an alarm happened, a Persian had his housing to fix, his horse to bridle, and his corslet to put on, before he could mount <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Xenophon's Anabasis, l. iii.

and, in the general confusion, the wound∣ed monarch (for Narses commanded his armies in person) fled towards the deserts of Media. His sumptuous tents, and those of his satraps, afforded an immense booty to the conqueror; and an incident is mentioned, which proves the rustic but martia ignorance of the legions in the ele∣gant superfluities of life. A bag of shining lea∣ther filled with pearls, fell into the hands of a private soldier; he carefully preserved the bag, but he threw away its contents, judging, that whatever was of no use could not possibly be of any value <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">The story is told by Ammianus, l. xxii.

Several of his wives, his sisters, and children, who had attended the army, were made captives in the defeat. But though the character of Galerius had in general very little affinity with that of Alexander, he imitated, after his victory, the amiable behaviour of the Macedonian towards the family of Darius. The wives and children of Narses were protected from violence and rapine, conveyed to a place of safety, and treated with every mark of respect and tenderness, that was due from a generous enemy, to their age, their sex, and their royal dignity <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">The Persians confessed the Roman superiority in morals as well as in arms.

The power, or at least the spirit of Narses, had been broken by his last defeat; and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could stop the progress of the Roman arms. He dispatched Apharban, a servant who possessed his favour and confidence, with a com∣mission to negociate a treaty, or rather to receive whatever conditions the conqueror should im∣pose. Apharban opened the conference by ex∣pressing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Speech of the Persian ambassa∣dor.</NOTE> his master's gratitude for the generous treatment of his family, and by soliciting the li∣berty of those illustrious captives. He celebrated the valour of Galerius without degrading the re∣putation of Narses, and thought it no dishonour to confess the superiority of the victorious Caesar, over a monarch who had surpassed in glory all
<PB N="150" REF="165"/>
the princes of his race. Notwithstanding the justice of the Persian cause, he was empowered to submit the present differences to the decision of the emperors themselves; convinced as he was, that, in the midst of prosperity, they would not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune. Apharban concluded his discourse in the style of eastern allegory, by observing that the Roman and Persian monarchies were the two eyes of the world, which would remain imperfect and muti∣lated if either of them should be put out.</P>
<P><Q>It well becomes the Persians, replied Ga∣lerius, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer of Galerius.</NOTE> with a transport of fury, which seemed to convulse his whole frame, it well becomes the Persians to expatiate on the vicissitudes of for∣tune, and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of moderation. Let them remember their own <HI>moderation</HI> towards the unhappy Va∣lerian. They vanquished him by fraud, they treated him with indignity. They detained him till the last moment of his life in shame∣ful captivity, and after his death they exposed his body to perpetual ignominy.</Q> Softening, however, his tone, Galerius insinuated to the am∣bassador, that it had never been the practice of the Romans to trample on a prostrate enemy; and that, on this occasion, they should consult their own dignity, rather than the Persian merit. He dismissed Apharban with a hope, that Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain, from the clemency of the empe∣rors, a lasting peace, and the restoration of his
<PB N="151" REF="166"/>
wives and children. In this conference we may discover the fierce passions of Galerius, as well as his deference to the superior wisdom and au∣thority of Diocletian. The ambition of the for∣mer grasped at the conquest of the East, and had proposed to reduce Persia into the state of a pro∣vince. The prudence of the latter, who adhered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Modera∣tion of Di∣ocletian.</NOTE> to the moderate policy of Augustus and the An∣tonines, embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a successful war by an honourable and advantageous peace <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Adeo Victor (says Aurelius) ut ni Valerius, cujus nutu omnia gerebantur, abnuisset, Romani fasces in provinciam novam ferrentur. Verum pars terrarum tamen nobis utilior quaesita.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards appointed Sicorius Probus, one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusion</NOTE> of their secretaries, to acquaint the Persian court with their final resolution. As the minister of peace, he was received with every mark of po∣liteness and friendship; but, under the pretence of allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey, the audience of Probus was deferred from day to day; and he attended the slow mo∣tions of the king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the river Asprudus in Media. The secret motive of Narses in this delay, had been to collect such a military force, as might enable him, though sincerely desirous of peace, to negociate with the greater weight and dignity. Three persons only assisted at this important con∣ference, the minister Apharban, the praefect of the guards, and an officer who had commanded

on the Armenian frontier <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">He had been governor of Sumium (Pet. Patricius in Excerpt. Legat. p. 30.). This province seems to be mentioned by Moses of Chorene (Geograph. p. 360.), and lay to the East of Mount Ara∣rat.</NOTE>. The first condition proposed by the ambassador, is not at present of a very intelligible nature; that the city of Nisibis might be established for the place of mutual ex∣change, or, as we should formerly have termed it, for the staple of trade, between the two em∣pires. There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as Nisibis was situated within their own domi∣nions, and as they were masters both of the im∣ports and exports, it should seem, that such re∣straints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty. To render them more effectual, some stipulations were probably re∣quired on the side of the king of Persia, which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity, that Narses could not be per∣suaded to subscribe them. As this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was no longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in its natural channels, or contented themselves with such restrictions, as it depended on their own authority to esta∣blish.</P>
<P>As soon as this difficulty was removed, a so∣lemn peace was concluded and ratified between <NOTE PLACE="marg">and arti∣cles of the treaty.</NOTE> the two nations. The conditions of a treaty so glorious to the empire, and so necessary to Persia,
<PB N="153" REF="168"/>
may deserve a more peculiar attention, as the history of Rome presents very few transactions of a similar nature; most of her wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest, or waged against barbarians ignorant of the use of letters. I. The Aboras, or, as it is called by Xenophon, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abo∣ras fixed as the limits between the em∣pires.</NOTE> the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary between the two monarchies <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">By an error of the geographer Ptolemy, the position of Sin∣gara is removed from the Aboras to the Tigris, which may have produced the mistake of Peter, in assigning the latter river for the boundary, instead of the former. The line of the Roman frontier traversed, but never followed, the course of the Tigris.</NOTE>. That river, which rose near the Tigris, was increased a few miles below Nisibis, by the little stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of Singara, and fell into the Euphrates at Circesium, a frontier town, which, by the care of Diocletian, was very strongly fortified <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Procopius de Edificiis, l. ii. c. 6.</NOTE>. Mesopotamia, the object of so many wars, was ceded to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty, renounced all pre∣tensions to that great province. II. They relin∣quished <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cession of five pro∣vinces be∣yond the Tigris.</NOTE> to the Romans five provinces beyond the Tigris <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">Three of the provinces, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Carduene, are allowed on all sides. But instead of the other two, Peter (in Excerpt. Leg. p. 30.) inserts Rehimene and Sophene. I have pre∣ferred Ammianus (l. xxv. 7.), because it might be proved, that Sophene was never in the hands of the Persians, either before the reign of Diocletian, or after that of Jovian. For want of correct maps, like those of M. d'Anville, almost all the moderns, with Tillemont and Valesius at their head, have imagined, that it was in respect to Persia, and not to Rome, that the five provinces were situate beyond the Tigris.</NOTE>. Their situation formed a very useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon im∣proved
<PB N="154" REF="169"/>
by art and military skill. Four of these, to the north of the river, were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent; Intiline, Zab∣dicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene: but on the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of Carduene, the an∣cient seat of the Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia. The ten thou∣sand Greeks traversed their country, after a pain∣ful march, or rather engagement, of seven days; and it is confessed by their leader, in his incom∣parable relation of the retreat, that they suffered more from the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of the Great King <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Xenophon's Anabasis, l. iv.

It <NOTE PLACE="marg">Armenia.</NOTE> is almost needless to observe, that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome, was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of the Imperial supremacy were fully asserted and se∣cured. The limits of Armenia were extended as far as the fortress of Sintha in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of justice. Of the provinces already mentioned beyond the Tigris, the four first had been dismembered by the Parthians from the

Its prin∣cipal city, in the same situation perhaps as the modern Tauris, was frequently honoured with the residence of Tiridates; and as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Compare Herodotus, l. i. c. 97. with Moses Choronens.

But they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves.

<P>The arduous work of rescuing the distressed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Triumph of Diocle∣tian and Maximi∣an.</NOTE> empire from tyrants and barbarians had now been completely atchieved by a succession of Illyrian peasants. As soon as Diocletian entered into the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 303.

The triumph of Diocletian and Maximian was less magnificent perhaps than those of Aurelian and Probus, but it was dignified by several cir∣cumstances of superior fame and good fortune. Africa and Britain, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Nile, furnished their respective trophies; but the most distinguished ornament was of a more
<PB N="157" REF="172"/>
singular nature, a Persian victory followed by an important conquest. The representations of ri∣vers, mountains, and provinces, were carried before the Imperial car. The images of the captive wives, the sisters, and the children of the Great King, afforded a new and grateful spec∣tacle to the vanity of the people <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">Eutropius (ix. 27.) mentions them as a part of the triumph. As the <HI>persons</HI> had been restored to Narses, nothing more than their <HI>images</HI> could be exhibited.</NOTE>. In the eyes of posterity this triumph is remarkable, by a distinction of a less honourable kind. It was the last that Rome ever beheld. Soon after this period, the emperors ceased to vanquish, and Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire.</P>
<P>The spot on which Rome was founded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Long ab∣sence of the empe∣rors from Rome.</NOTE> had been consecrated by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles. The presence of some god, or the memory of some hero, seemed to animate every part of the city, and the empire of the world had been promised to the Capitol <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Livy gives us a speech of Camillus on that subject (v. 51—55.), full of eloquence and sensibility, in opposition to a design of removing the seat of government from Rome to the neighbouring city of Veii.</NOTE>. The native Romans felt and confessed the power of this agreeable illusion. It was derived from their ancestors, had grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was protected, in some mea∣sure, by the opinion of political utility. The form and the seat of government were intimately blended together, nor was it esteemed possible to transport the one without destroying the

According to the ingenious conjecture of Le Fevre and Dacier, the third ode of the third book of Horace was intended to divert Augustus from the execution of a similar design.</NOTE>. But the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conquest; the provinces rose to the same level, and the vanquished nations acquired the name and pri∣vileges, without imbibing the partial affections, of Romans. During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient constitution, and the influence of custom, preserved the dignity of Rome. The emperors, though perhaps of Afri∣can or Illyrian extraction, respected their adopt∣ed country, as the seat of their power, and the centre of their extensive dominions. The emer∣gencies of war very frequently required their presence on the frontiers; but Diocletian and Maximian were the first Roman princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in the provinces; and their conduct, however it might be suggested by private motives, was jus∣tified by very specious considerations of policy. The court of the emperor of the West was, for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their resi∣dence at Milan</NOTE> the most part, established at Milan, whose situ∣ation, at the foot of the Alps, appeared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany. Milan soon assum∣ed the splendour of an Imperial city. The houses are described as numerous and well-built;
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
the manners of the people as polished and liberal. A circus, a theatre, a mint, a pa∣lace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian; porticoes adorned with statues, and a double circumference of walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it seem oppressed even by the proximity of Rome <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">See Aurelius Victor, who likewise mentions the buildings erected by Maximian at Carthage, probably during the Moorish war. We shall insert some verses of Ausonius de Clar. Urb. v.

To rival the majesty of Rome was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, who employed his lei∣sure, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and Nico∣media.</NOTE> and the wealth of the East, in the embel∣lishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of Europe and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the Danube and the Euphrates. By the taste of the monarch, and at the expence of the people, Nicomedia acquired, in the space of a few years, a degree of magnificence which might appear to have required the labour of ages, and became inferior only to Rome, Alex∣andria, and Antioch, in extent or populousness <NOTE N="91" PLACE="foot">Lactant. de M. P. c. 17. Libanius, Orat. viii. p. 203.</NOTE>. The life of Diocletian and Maximian was a life
<PB N="160" REF="175"/>
of action, and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps, or in their long and frequent marches; but whenever the public business al∣lowed them any relaxation, they seem to have retired with pleasure to their favourite residences of Nicomedia and Milan. Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his Roman triumph, it is extremely doubtful whe∣ther he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire. Even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed two months. Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people, he quitted Rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he should have ap∣peared in the senate, invested with the ensigns of the consular dignity <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">Lactant. de M. P. c. 17. On a similar occasion Ammianus mentions the <HI>dicacitas plebis,</HI> as not very agreeable to an Imperial ear. (See l. xvi. c. 10.)</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dislike expressed by Diocletian towards <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debase∣ment of Rome and of the se∣nate.</NOTE> Rome and Roman freedom, was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result of the most artful policy. That crafty prince had framed a new system of Imperial government, which was afterwards completed by the family of Constan∣tine; and as the image of the old constitution was religiously preserved in the senate, he resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration. We may recollect, about eight years before the elevation of Dio∣cletian, the transient greatness, and the ambi∣tious hopes, of the Roman senate. As long as that enthusiasm prevailed, many of the nobles
<PB N="161" REF="176"/>
imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom; and after the successors of Probus had withdrawn their countenance from the republican party, the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment. As the sovereign of Italy, Maximian was intrusted with the care of extin∣guishing this troublesome, rather than danger∣ous, spirit, and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper. The most illustrious mem∣bers of the senate, whom Diocletian always affect∣ed to esteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the accusation of imaginary plots; and the possession of an elegant villa, or a well cultivated estate, was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot">Lactantius accuses Maximian of destroying fictis criminatio∣nibus lumina senatûs (De M.

The camp of the Praetorians, which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the ma∣jesty of Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their power, they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the authority of the senate. By the prudent measures of Diocletian, the numbers of the Prae∣torians were insensibly reduced, their privileges abolished <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">Truncatae vires urbis, imminuto praetoriarum cohortium atque in armis vulgi numero.

They had acquired much reputation by the use of the <HI>plumbatae,</HI> or darts loaded with lead. Each soldier carried five of these, which he darted from a considerable distance, with great strength and dex∣terity. See Vegetius, i. 17.</NOTE>. But the most fatal though secret wound, which the senate received from the hands of Diocletian and Maximian, was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their absence. As long as the emperors resided at Rome, that assembly might be oppressed, but it could scarcely be neglected. The successors of Augustus exercised the power of dictating whatever laws their wis∣dom or caprice might suggest; but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate. The model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees; and wise princes, who respected the prejudices of the Roman people, were in some measure obliged to assume the lan∣guage and behaviour suitable to the general and first magistrate of the republic. In the armies and in the provinces, they displayed the dignity of monarchs; and when they fixed their residence at a distance from the capital, they for ever laid aside the dissimulation which Augustus had recommended to his successors. In the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive power, the sovereign advised with his ministers, instead of consulting the great council of the nation. The name of the senate was mentioned with honour till the last period of the empire; the
<PB N="163" REF="178"/>
vanity of its members was still flattered with honorary distinctions <NOTE N="96" PLACE="foot">See the Theodosian Code, l. vi. tit. ii. with Godefroy's com∣mentary.</NOTE>; but the assembly which had so long been the source, and so long the instrument of power, was respectfully suffered to sink into oblivion. The senate of Rome, losing all connection with the Imperial court and the actual constitution, was left a venerable but use∣less monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.</P>
<P>When the Roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their ancient capital, they easily <NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil ma∣gistracies laid aside.</NOTE> forgot the origin and nature of their legal power. The civil offices of consul, of proconsul, of cen∣sor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed, betrayed to the people its republican extraction. Those modest titles were laid aside <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">See the 12th dissertation in Spanheim's excellent work de Usu Numismatum. From medals, inscriptions, and historians, he ex∣amines every title separately, and traces it from Augustus to the moment of its disappearing.</NOTE>; and if they still distinguished their high station by the appellation of Emperor, or IMPERATOR, that word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and no longer denoted the general of the Roman armies, but the sove∣reign of the Roman world. The name of Em∣peror, which was at first of a military nature, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperial dignity and titles.</NOTE> was associated with another of a more servile kind. The epithet of DOMINUS, or Lord, in its primitive signification, was expressive, not of the authority of a prince over his subjects, or
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
of a commander over his soldiers, but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">Pliny (in Panegyr. c. 3. 55, &amp;c.) speaks of <HI>Dominus</HI> with exe∣cration, as synonymous to Tyrant, and opposite to Prince. And the same Pliny regularly gives that title (in the tenth book of the epistles) to his friend rather than master, the virtuous Trajan. This strange contradiction puzzles the commentators, who think, and the translators, who can write.</NOTE>. Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with abhorrence by the first Caesars. Their resistance insensibly became more feeble, and the name less odious; till at length the style of <HI>our Lord and Emperor,</HI> was not only be∣stowed by flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments. Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the successors of Diocletian still declined the title of King, it seems to have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy. Wherever the Latin tongue was in use (and it was the lan∣guage of government throughout the empire), the Imperial title, as it was peculiar to them∣selves, conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of King, which they must have shared with an hundred barbarian chieftains; or which, at the best, they could derive only from Romulus or from Tarquin. But the sentiments of the East were very different from those of the West. From the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of Asia had been celebrated in the Greek lan∣guage by the title of BASILEUS, or King; and since it was considered as the first distinction
<PB N="165" REF="180"/>
among men, it was soon employed by the servile provincials of the East, in their humble addresses to the Roman throne <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">Synesius de Regno, Edit. Petav. p. 15.

Such extravagant compliments, how∣ever, soon lose their impiety by losing their meaning; and when the ear is once accustomed to the sound, they are heard with indifference as vague though excessive prosessions of respect.</P>
<P>From the time of Augustus to that of Diocle∣tian, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Diocletian assumes the diadem, and intro∣duces the Persian ce∣remonial.</NOTE> the Roman princes conversing in a familiar manner among their fellow-citizens, were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid to senators and magistrates. Their principal distinction was the Imperial or military robe of purple; whilst the senatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the equestrian by a narrow, band or stripe of the same honourable colour. The pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian, engaged that artful prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of Persia <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">See Spanheim de Usu Numismat. Dissertat. xii.</NOTE>. He ven∣tured to assume the diadem, an ornament detest∣ed by the Romans as the odious ensign of roy∣alty, and the use of which had been considered
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
as the most desperate act of the madness of Caligula. It was no more than a broad white fillet set with pearls, which encircled the empe∣ror's head. The sumptuous robes of Diocletian and his successors were of silk and gold; and it is remarked with indignation, that even their shoes were studded with the most precious gems. The access to their sacred person was every day rendered more difficult, by the institution of new forms and ceremonies. The avenues of the palace were strictly guarded by the various <HI>schools,</HI> as they began to be called, of domestic officers. The interior apartments were intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs; the increase of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of the progress of despotism. When a subject was at length admitted to the Imperial presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his rank, to fall prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to the eastern fashion, the divinity of his lord and master <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor. Eutropius ix. 26. It appears by the Pane∣gyrists, that the Romans were soon reconciled to the name and cere∣mony of adoration.</NOTE>. Diocletian was a man of sense, who, in the course of private as well as public life, had formed a just estimate both of himself and of mankind: nor is it easy to conceive, that in substituting the manners of Persia to those of Rome, he was seriously actuated by so mean a principle as that of vanity. He flattered himself, that an ostentation of splendour and luxury would sub∣due the imagination of the multitude; that the
<PB N="167" REF="182"/>
monarch would be less exposed to the rude licence of the people and the soldiers, as his person was secluded from the public view; and that habits of submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of veneration. Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical representation; but it must be confessed, that of the two comedies, the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter. It was the aim of the one to disguise, and the object of the other to display, the unbounded power which the em∣perors possessed over the Roman world.</P>
<P>Ostentation was the first principle of the new <NOTE PLACE="marg">New form of admini∣stration, two Au∣gusti, and two Cae∣sars.</NOTE> system instituted by Diocletian. The second was division. He divided the empire, the provinces, and every branch of the civil as well as military administration. He multiplied the wheels of the machine of government, and rendered its ope∣rations less rapid but more secure. Whatever advantages, and whatever defects might attend these innovations, they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the first inventor; but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full maturity and perfection <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">The innovations introduced by Diocletian, are chiefly deduced, 1st, from some very strong passages in Lactantius; and, 2dly, from the new and various offices, which, in the Theodosian code, appear <HI>already</HI> established in the beginning of the reign of Constantine.</NOTE>. Reserving, therefore, for the reign of Constan∣tine

a more exact picture of the new empire, we shall content ourselves with describing the prin∣cipal and decisive outline, as it was traced by the hand of Diocletian. He had associated three colleagues in the exercise of the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he considered the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution. It was his intention, that the two elder princes should be distinguished by the use of the diadem, and the title of <HI>Augusti:</HI> that, as affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should regularly call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues; and that the <HI>Caesars,</HI> rising in their turn to the first rank, should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors. The empire was divided into four parts. The East and Italy were the most ho∣nourable, the Danube and the Rhine the most laborious stations. The former claimed the presence of the <HI>Augusti,</HI> the latter were intrusted to the administration of the <HI>Caesars.</HI> The strength of the legions was in the hands of the four part∣ners of sovereignty, and the despair of succes∣sively vanquishing four formidable rivals, might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general. In their civil government, the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with their joint names, were received in all the provinces, as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority. Notwithstanding these precautions,
<PB N="169" REF="184"/>
the political union of the Roman world was gra∣dually dissolved, and a principle of division was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned the perpetual separation of the eastern and western empires.</P>
<P>The system of Diocletian was accompanied <NOTE PLACE="marg">Increase of taxes.</NOTE> with another very material disadvantage, which cannot even at present be totally overlooked; a more expensive establishment, and consequently an increase of taxes, and the oppression of the people. Instead of a modest family of slaves and freedmen, such as had contented the simple greatness of Augustus and Trajan, three or four magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the empire, and as many Roman <HI>kings</HI> contended with each other and with the Persian monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and luxury. The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and of servants, who filled the different departments of the state, was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm expression of a contemporary), <Q>when the proportion of those who received, exceeded the proportion of those who con∣tributed, the provinces were oppressed by the weight of tributes <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">Lactant. de M. P. c. 7.</NOTE>.</Q> From this period to the extinction of the empire, it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints. According to his religion and situ∣ation, each writer chuses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodosius, for the
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
object of his invectives; but they unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public impositions, and particularly the land-tax and capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times. From such a con∣currence, an impartial historian, who is obliged to extract truth from satire, as well as from pa∣negyric, will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse, and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices, than to the uniform system of their admi∣nistration. The emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but during his reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establishing pernicious precedents, rather than of exercising actual oppression <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Indicta lex nova quae sane illorum temporum modestiâ tole∣rabilis, in perniciem processit. Aurel. Victor, who has treated the character of Diocletian with good sense, though in bad Latin.</NOTE>. It may be added, that his revenues were manag∣ed with prudent oeconomy; and that after all the current expences were discharged, there still remained in the Imperial treasury an ample pro∣vision either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state.</P>
<P>It was in the twenty-first year of his reign that Diocletian executed his memorable resolution of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdicati∣on of Dio∣cletian and Maximi∣an.</NOTE> abdicating the empire; an action more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger Antoninus, than from a prince who had never practised the lessons of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme power.
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
Diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the world the first example of a resignation <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Solus omnium, post conditum Romanum Imperium, qui ex¦tanto fastigio sponte ad privatae vitae statum civilitatemque remearet. Eutrop. ix. 28.</NOTE>, which has not been very frequently imitated by succeed∣ing monarchs. The parallel of Charles the Fifth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Resem∣blance to Charles the Fifth.</NOTE> however, will naturally offer itself to our mind, not only since the eloquence of a modern histo∣rian has rendered that name so familiar to an English reader, but from the very striking resem∣blance between the characters of the two empe∣rors, whose political abilities were superior to their military genius, and whose specious virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art. The abdication of Charles appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude of fortune; and the disappointment of his favourite schemes urged him to relinquish a power which he found in∣adequate to his ambition. But the reign of Diocletian had flowed with a tide of uninter∣rupted success; nor was it till after he had van∣quished all his enemies, and accomplished all his designs, that he seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire. Neither Charles nor Diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of life; since the one was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of those princes, their wars and journies, the cares of royalty, and their application to business, had

already impaired their constitution, and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age <NOTE N="107" PLACE="foot">The particulars of the journey and illness are taken from Lac∣tantius (c. 17.), who may <HI>sometimes</HI> be admitted as an evidence of public facts, though very seldom of private anecdotes.</NOTE>.</P>

From the inclemency of the weather, and the fatigue of the journey, he soon contracted a slow illness; and though he made easy marches, and was generally carried in a close litter, his disorder, before he arrived at Nicomedia, about the end of the summer, was become very serious and alarming. During the whole winter he was confined to his palace; his danger inspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health, from the joy or con∣sternation which they discovered in the coun∣tenances and behaviour of his attendants. The rumour of his death was for some time univer∣sally believed, and it was supposed to be con∣cealed, with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened during the absence of the Caesar Galerius. At length, however, on the first of March, Diocletian once more appeared in public, but so pale and emaciated, that he could scarcely have been recognised by those to whom his person was the most familiar. It was time to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">His pru∣dence.</NOTE>
<PB N="173" REF="188"/>
sustained during more than a year, between the care of his health and that of his dignity. The former required indulgence and relaxation, the latter compelled him to direct, from the bed of sickness, the administration of a great empire. He resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honourable repose, to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquish the theatre of the world to his younger and more active asso∣ciates <NOTE N="108" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor ascribes the abdication, which had been so variously accounted for, to two causes. 1st, Diocletian's contempt of ambition; and 2dly, His apprehension of impending troubles.

<P>The ceremony of his abdication was perform∣ed in a spacious plain, about three miles from Nicomedia. The emperor ascended a lofty throne, and in a speech, full of reason and dig∣nity, declared his intention, both to the people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion. As soon as he had di∣vested <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 305.

Even in the splendour of the Roman triumph, Diocletian had meditated his design of abdicat∣ing the government. As he wished to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him, either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he would descend from the throne, whenever he should receive the ad∣vice and the example. This engagement, though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter <NOTE N="110" PLACE="foot">See Panegyr. Veter. vi. 9. The oration was pronounced after Maximian had reassumed the purple.</NOTE>, would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce temper of Maximian, whose passion was the love of power, and who neither desired present tran∣quillity nor future reputation. But he yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his wiser colleague had acquired over him, and re∣tired, immediately after his abdication, to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost impossible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tranquillity.</P>
<P>Diocletian, who, from a servile origin, had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Retire∣ment of Diocletian at Salona.</NOTE> raised himself to the throne, passed the nine last years of his life in a private condition. Reason had dictated, and content seems to have accom∣panied, his retreat, in which he enjoyed for a long time the respect of those princes to whom he had resigned the possession of the world <NOTE N="111" PLACE="foot">Eumenius pays him a very fine compliment: <Q>At enim divi∣num illum virum, qui primus imperium et participavit et posuit, consilii et facti sui non poenitet; nec amisisse se putat quod sponte transcripsit.

It is seldom that minds, long exercised in busi∣ness, have formed any habits of conversing with themselves, and in the loss of power they prin∣cipally regret the want of occupation. The amusements of letters and of devotion, which afford so many resources in solitude, were inca∣pable of fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at least he soon recovered, a taste for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures, and his leisure hours were sufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening. His answer to Maximian is deservedly celebrated. He was solicited by that restless old man to re∣assume <NOTE PLACE="marg">His phi∣losophy,</NOTE> the reins of government, and the Imperial purple. He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity, calmly observing, that if he could shew Maximian the cabbages which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power <NOTE N="112" PLACE="foot">We are obliged to the younger Victor for this celebrated bon môt.

Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity, the truth is concealed from his know∣ledge; he can see only with their eyes, he hears nothing but their misrepresentations. He confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness, and disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjects. By such infamous arts, added Diocletian, the best and wisest princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers <NOTE N="113" PLACE="foot">Hist. August. p. 223, 224. Vopiscus had learned this con∣versation from his father.</NOTE>.</Q> A just estimate of greatness, and the assurance of im∣mortal fame, improve our relish for the plea∣sures of retirement; but the Roman emperor had filled too important a character in the world, to enjoy without alloy the comforts and security of a private condition. It was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication. It was impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences. Fear, sorrow, and discontent, sometimes pursued him into the solitude of Sa∣lona. His tenderness, or at least his pride, was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and the last moments of Diocle∣tian were embittered by some affronts, which Licinius and Constantine might have spared the father of so many emperors, and the first author of their own fortune. A report, though of a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">and death. A. D. 313.</NOTE> doubtful nature, has reached our times, that he

prudently withdrew himself from their power by a voluntary death <NOTE N="114" PLACE="foot">The younger Victor slightly mentions the report.

<P>Before we dismiss the consideration of the life <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descrip∣tion of Sa∣lona and the adja∣cent coun∣try.</NOTE> and character of Diocletian, we may, for a mo∣ment, direct our view to the place of his retire∣ment. Salona, a principal city of his native province of Dalmatia, was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the measurement of the public highways) from Aquileia and the con∣fines of Italy, and about two hundred and seventy from Sirmium, the usual residence of the empe∣rors whenever they visited the Illyrian frontier <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot">See the Itiner. p. 269. 272. Edit. Wessel.</NOTE>. A miserable village still preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth century, the remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble columns, continued to attest its ancient splendour <NOTE N="116" PLACE="foot">The Abate Fortis, in his Viaggio in Dalmazia, p. 43. (printed at Venice in the year 1774, in two small volumes in quarto) quotes a MS. account of the antiquities of Salona, composed by Giambattista Giustiniani about the middle of the xvith century.</NOTE>. About six or seven miles from the city, Diocletian constructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his design of abdicating the empire. The choice of a spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury, did not
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
require the partiality of a native. <Q>The soil was dry and fertile, the air is pure and whole∣some, and though extremely hot during the summer months, this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious winds, to which the coasts of Istria and some parts of Italy are ex∣posed. The views from the palace are no less beautiful than the soil and climate were in∣viting. Towards the west lies the fertile shore that stretches along the Hadriatic, in which a number of small islands are scattered in such a manner, as to give this part of the sea the appearance of a great lake. On the north side lies the bay, which led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country beyond it, appearing in sight, forms a proper contrast to that more extensive prospect of water, which the Hadriatic presents both to the south and to the east. Towards the north, the view is ter∣minated by high and irregular mountains, situated at a proper distance, and, in many places, covered with villages, woods, and vine∣yards <NOTE N="117" PLACE="foot">Adam's antiquities of Diocletian's palace at Spalatro, p. 6. We may add a circumstance or two from the Abate Fortis: the little stream of the Hyader, mentioned by Lucan, produces most exquisite trout, which a sagacious writer, perhaps a monk, supposes to have been one of the principal reasons that determined Diocletian in the choice of his retirement.

Though Constantine, from a very obvious pre∣judice, affects to mention the palace of Diocle∣tian with contempt <NOTE N="118" PLACE="foot">Constantin. Orat. ad Coetum Sanct. c. 25.

Porphyr. de Statu Imper. p. 86.</NOTE>. It covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and ten English acres. The form was quadran∣gular, flanked with sixteen towers. Two of the sides were near six hundred, and the other two near seven hundred feet in length. The whole was constructed of a beautiful free-stone, extract∣ed from the neighbouring quarries of Trau or Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself. Four streets, intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several parts of this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden Gate. The ap∣proach was terminated by a <HI>peristylium</HI> of granite columns, on one side of which we discover the square temple of Aesculapius, on the other the octagon temple of Jupiter. The latter of those deities Diocletian revered as the patron of his fortunes, the former as the protector of his health. By comparing the present remains with the pre∣cepts of Vitruvius, the several parts of the build∣ing, the baths, bedchamber, the <HI>atrium,</HI> the <HI>basi∣lica,</HI> and the Cyzicene, Corinthian, and Egyp∣tian
<PB N="180" REF="195"/>
halls, have been described with some degree of precision, or at least of probability. Their forms were various, their proportions just, but they were all attended with two imperfections, very repugnant to our modern notions of taste and conveniency. These stately rooms had neither windows nor chimnies. They were light∣ed from the top (for the building seems to have consisted of no more than one story), and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls. The range of principal apartments was protected towards the south-west, by a portico of five hundred and seventeen feet long, which must have formed a very noble and delightful walk, when the beau∣ties of painting and sculpture were added to those of the prospect.</P>
<P>Had this magnificent edifice remained in a soli∣tary country, it would have been exposed to the ravages of time; but it might, perhaps, have escaped the rapacious industry of man. The village of Aspalathus <NOTE N="120" PLACE="foot">D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 162.</NOTE>, and long afterwards the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins. The golden gate now opens into the market-place. St. John the Baptist has usurped the honours of Aesculapius: and the temple of Jupiter, under the protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church. For this account of Diocletian's palace, we are principally indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiosity car∣ried

The magnificent work which their journey produced, was published in London seven years afterwards.</NOTE>. But there is room to suspect, that the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their purpose to represent. We <NOTE PLACE="marg">Decline of the arts.</NOTE> are informed by a more recent and very judi∣cious traveller, that the awful ruins of Spalatro are not less expressive of the decline of the arts, than of the greatness of the Roman empire in the time of Diocletian <NOTE N="122" PLACE="foot">I shall quote the words of the Abate Fortis. <Q>E'bastevol∣mente nota agli amatori dell'Architettura, e dell'Antichità, l'opera del Signor ADAMS, che a donato molto a que' superbi vestigi coll'abituale eleganza del suo toccalapis e del bulino.

If such was indeed the state of architecture, we must naturally be∣lieve that painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible decay. The practice of architecture is directed by a few general and even mechanical rules. But sculpture, and above all, painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the forms of nature, but of the cha∣racters and passions of the human soul. In those sublime arts, the dexterity of the hand is of lit∣tle avail, unless it is animated by fancy, and guided by the most correct taste and observa∣tion.</P>
<P>It is almost unnecessary to remark, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of letters.</NOTE> civil distractions of the empire, the licence of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbarians, and
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
the progress of despotism, had proved very un∣favourable to genius, and even to learning. The succession of Illyrian princes restored the empire, without restoring the sciences. Their military education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of letters; and even the mind of Diocletian, however active and capacious in business, was totally uninformed by study or spe∣culation. The professions of law and physic are of such common use and certain profit, that they will always secure a sufficient number of prac∣titioners, endowed with a reasonable degree of abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that the students in those two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who have flourished within that period. The voice of poetry was silent. History was reduced to dry and confused abridg∣ments, alike destitute of amusement and instruc∣tion. A languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service of the em∣perors, who encouraged not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of their pride, or the defence of their power <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">The orator Eumenius was secretary to the emperors Maximian and Constantius, and Professor of Rhetoric in the college of Autun.

Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial me∣ditations, their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy. They flattered themselves that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison; claimed a familiar inter∣course with daemons and spirits; and, by a very singular revolution, converted the study of phi∣losophy into that of magic. The ancient sages

had derided the popular superstition; after dis∣guising its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory, the disciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its most zealous defenders. As they agreed with the Christians in a few mysterious points of faith, they attacked the remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil war.

<P>THE balance of power established by Dio∣cletian subsisted no longer than while it was sustained by the firm and dexterous hand of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Period of civil wars and confu∣sion.</NOTE> the founder. It required such a fortunate mix∣ture of different tempers and abilities, as could scarcely be found or even expected a second time; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 305—323.</NOTE> two emperors without jealousy, two Caesars with∣out ambition, and the same general interest in∣variably pursued by four independent princes. The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and con∣fusion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who, viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to increase their respective forces at the expence of their subjects.</P>
<P>As soon as Diocletian and Maximian had re∣signed the purple, their station, according to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and situa∣tion of Constan∣tius.</NOTE> rules of the new constitution, was filled by the
<PB N="186" REF="201"/>
two Caesars, Constantius and Galerius, who im∣mediately assumed the title of Augustus <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">M. de Montesquieu (Considerations sur la Grandeur et la Deca∣dence des Romains, c. 17.) supposes, on the authority of Orosius and Eusebius, that, on this occasion, the empire, for the first time, was <HI>really</HI> divided into two parts. It is difficult, however, to dis∣cover in what respect the plan of Galerius differed from that of Dio∣cletian.</NOTE>. The honours of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former of those princes, and he continued, under a new appellation, to administer his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain. The government of those ample provinces was suffi∣cient to exercise his talents, and to satisfy his ambition. Clemency, temperance, and mode∣ration, distinguished the amiable character of Constantius, and his fortunate subjects had fre∣quently occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the passions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hic non modo amabilis, sed etiam venerabilis Gallis suit; praecipue quòd Diocletiani suspectam prudentiam, et Maximiani sanguinariam violentiam imperio ejus evaserant. Eutrop. Breviar. x. 1.</NOTE>. Instead of imitating their eastern pride and magnificence, Constantius preserved the modesty of a Roman prince. He declared, with unaffected sincerity, that his most valued treasure was in the hearts of his people, and that, whenever the dignity of the throne, or the danger of the state, required any extraordinary supply, he could depend with con∣fidence on their gratitude and liberality <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Divitiis Provincialium (mel. <HI>provinciarum)</HI> ac privatorum studens, fisci commoda non admodum affectans; ducensque melius publicas opes a privatis haberi, quam intra unum claustrum reservari.

<PB N="187" REF="202"/>
provincials of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, sensible of his worth and of their own happiness, reflected with anxiety on the declining health of the em∣peror Constantius, and the tender age of his nu∣merous family, the issue of his second marriage with the daughter of Maximian.</P>
<P>The stern temper of Galerius was cast in a very different mould; and while he commanded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Gale∣rius.</NOTE> the esteem of his subjects, he seldom condescended to solicit their affections. His fame in arms, and above all, the success of the Persian war, had elated his haughty mind, which was naturally impatient of a superior, or even of an equal. If it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an injudicious writer, we might ascribe the abdication of Diocletian to the menaces of Ga∣lerius, and relate the particulars of a <HI>private</HI> con∣versation between the two princes, in which the former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed ingratitude and arrogance <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de Mort. Persecutor. c. 18. Were the particulars of this conference more consistent with truth and decency, we might still ask, how they came to the knowledge of an obscure rhetorician? But there are many historians who put us in mind of the admirable saying of the great Condè to cardinal de Retz; <Q>Ces coquins nous font parler et agir, comme ils auroient fait eux-memes à notre place.</Q></NOTE>. But these obscure anecdotes are sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of Diocletian. Whatever might otherwise have been his intentions, if he had apprehended any

<P>After the elevation of Constantius and Galerius <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Caesars, Severus and Max∣imin.</NOTE> to the rank of <HI>Augusti,</HI> two new <HI>Caesars</HI> were re∣quired to supply their place, and to complete the system of the Imperial government. Dio∣cletian was sincerely desirous of withdrawing him∣self from the world; he considered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firmest support of his family and of the empire; and he con∣sented, without reluctance, that his successor should assume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination. It was fixed without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of the West. Each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of manhood, and who might have been deemed the most natural candidates for the vacant honour. But the impotent resent∣ment of Maximian was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate Constantius, though he might despise the dangers, was humanely apprehensive of the calamities of civil war. The two persons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Caesar, were much better suited to serve the views of his ambition; and their principal recommendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or personal consequence. The first of these was Daza, or, as he was afterwards called, Maximin, whose mother was the sister of Galerius. The
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
unexperienced youth still betrayed by his man∣ners and language his rustic education, when, to his own astonishment as well as that of the world, he was invested by Diocletian with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Caesar, and intrusted with the sovereign command of Egypt and Syria <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Sublatus nuper a pecoribus et silvis (says Lactantius de M.

At the same time, Severus, a faithful servant, addicted to pleasure, but not incapable of busi∣ness, was sent to Milan, to receive from the re∣luctant hands of Maximian the Caesarean orna∣ments, and the possession of Italy and Africa <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">His diligence and fidelity are acknowledged even by Lactantius, de M.

In the full confidence, that the approaching death of Constantius would leave him sole master of the Roman world, we are as∣sured that he had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes, and that he medi∣tated his own retreat from public life, after he should have accomplished a glorious reign of about twenty years <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">These schemes, however, rest only on the very doubtful autho∣rity of Lactantius, de M.

<P N="1">I. The fame of Constantine has rendered pos∣terity <NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth, education, and escape of Con∣stantine. A. D. 274.</NOTE> attentive to the most minute circumstances of his life and actions. The place of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have been the subject not only of literary but of national disputes. Notwithstanding the recent tradition, which assigns for her father, a British king, we are obliged to confess, that Helena was the daughter of an innkeeper <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">This tradition, unknown to the contemporaries of Constantine, was invented in the darkness of monasteries, was embellished by Jeffrey of Monmouth, and the writers of the xiith century, has been defended by our antiquarians of the last age, and is seriously re∣lated in the ponderous history of England, compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He transports, however, the kingdom of Coil, the imaginary father of Helena, from Essex to the wall of Anto∣ninus.</NOTE>; but at the same time we may defend the legality of her marriage, against those who have represented her as the concubine of Constantius <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Eutropius (x. 2.) expresses, in a few words, the real truth, and the occasion of the error, "ex obscuriori matrimonio ejus filius." Zosimus (l. ii. p. 78.) eagerly seized the most unfavourable report, and is followed by Orosius (vii. 25.), whose authority is oddly enough overlooked by the indefatigable but partial Tillemont. By insisting on the divorce of Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her marriage.</NOTE>. The great Constan∣tine was most probably born at Naissus, in Da∣cia <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">There are three opinions with regard to the place of Constan∣tine's birth. 1. Our English antiquarians were used to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyrist; <Q>Britannias illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.</Q> But this celebrated passage may be referred with as much propriety to the accession as to the nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have ascribed the honour of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulph of Nicomedia (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174.), which Constantine dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Justinian adorned with many splendid buildings (Procop. de Aedificiis, v. 2.). It is indeed probable enough, that Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum; and that Constantius might lodge there when he returned from a Persian embassy in the reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering life of a soldier, the place of his marriage, and the places where his children are born, have very little connection with each other. 3. The claim of Naissus is supported by the anonymous writer, published at the end of Am∣mianus, p. 710, and who in general copied very good materials; and it is confirmed by Julius Firmicius (de Astrologiâ, l. i. c. 4.), who flourished under the reign of Constantine himself. Some ob∣jections have been raised against the integrity of the text, and the application of the passage of Firmicius; but the former is established by the best MSS. and the latter is very ably defended by Lipsius de Magnitudine Romana, l. iv. c. 11. et Supplement.</NOTE>;

Instead of following Constantius in the West, he re∣mained in the service of Diocletian, signalized his valour in the wars of Egypt and Persia, and
<PB N="192" REF="207"/>
gradually rose to the honourable station of a tri∣bune of the first order. The figure of Constan∣tius was tall and majestic; he was dexterous in all his exercises, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole conduct, the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence; and while his mind was engrossed by ambition, he appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure. The favour of the people and soldiers, who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of Caesar, served only to exasperate the jealousy of Galerius; and though prudence might restrain him from exercising any open violence, an ab∣solute monarch is seldom at a loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Galerius, or perhaps his own courage, exposed him to single combat with a Sarmatian (Anonym. p. 710.) and with a monstrous lion.

He ended his life in the Imperial palace of York, fifteen months after he had received the title of Au∣gustus, and almost fourteen years and a half after he had been promoted to the rank of Caesar. His death was immediately succeeded by the ele∣vation of Constantine. The ideas of inheritance and succession are so very familiar, that the ge∣nerality of mankind consider them as founded, not only in reason, but in nature itself. Our imagination readily transfers the same principles from private property to public dominion: and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a son whose merit seems to justify the esteem, or even the hopes of the people, the joint influence of prejudice and of affection operates with irre∣sistible

The flower of the western armies had followed Constantius into Britain, and the national troops were reinforced by a numerous body of Alemanni, who obeyed the orders of Crocus, one of their hereditary chieftains <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Cunctis qui aderant annitentibus, sed praecipue Croco <HI>(alii Eroco)</HI> Alamannorum Rege, auxilii gratiâ Constantium comitato, imperium capit.

The practice grew familiar, and at last became fatal.</NOTE>. The opinion of their own importance, and the assu∣rance that Britain, Gaul, and Spain would ac∣quiesce in their nomination, were diligently in∣culcated to the legions by the adherents of Con∣stantine. The soldiers were asked, Whether they could hesitate a moment between the honour of placing at their head the worthy son of their beloved emperor, and the ignominy of tamely expecting the arrival of some obscure stranger, on whom it might please the sovereign of Asia to bestow the armies and provinces of the West. It was insinuated to them, that gratitude and li∣berality held a distinguished place among the virtues of Constantine; nor did that artful prince shew himself to the troops, till they were pre∣pared to salute him with the names of Augustus and Emperor. The throne was the object of his desires; and had he been less actuated by ambi∣tion, it was his only means of safety. He was well acquainted with the character and sentiments of Galerius, and sufficiently apprized, that if he wished to live he must determine to reign. The
<PB N="195" REF="210"/>
decent and even obstinate resistance which he chose to affect <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">His panegyrist Eumenius (vii. 8.) ventures to affirm, in the presence of Constantine, that he put spurs to his horse, and tried, but in vain, to escape from the hands of his soldiers.</NOTE>, was contrived to justify his usurpation; nor did he yield to the acclamations of the army, till he had provided the proper ma∣terials for a letter, which he immediately dis∣patched to the emperor of the East. Constantine informed him of the melancholy event of his fa∣ther's death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession, and respectfully lamented, that the affectionate violence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the Imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner. The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise, dis∣appointment, and rage; and as he could seldom restrain his passions, he loudly threatened, that he would commit to the flames both the letter and the messenger. But his resentment insensibly <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is ac∣knowledg∣ed by Ga∣lerius, who gives him only the title of Caesar, and that of Augustus to Severus.</NOTE> subsided; and when he recollected the doubtful chance of war, when he had weighed the cha∣racter and strength of his adversary, he consented to embrace the honourable accommodation which the prudence of Constantine had left open to him. Without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague, as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite

Severus.

<P>The children of Constantius by his second marriage were six in number, three of either sex, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The bro∣thers and sisters of Constan∣tine.</NOTE> and whose Imperial descent might have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of Helena. But Constantine was in the thirty∣second year of his age, in the full vigour both of mind and body, at the time when the eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than thir∣teen years old. His claim of superior merit had been allowed and ratified by the dying emperor <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">The choice of Constantine, by his dying father, which is war∣ranted by reason, and insinuated by Eumenius, seems to be con∣firmed by the most unexceptionable authority, the concurring evi∣dence of Lactantius (de M.

<P N="2">II. The ambitious spirit of Galerius was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontent of the Ro∣mans at the appre∣hension of taxes.</NOTE> scarcely reconciled to the disappointment of his views upon the Gallic provinces, before the un∣expected loss of Italy wounded his pride as well as power in a still more sensible part. The long absence of the emperors had filled Rome with discontent and indignation; and the people gra∣dually discovered, that the preference given to Nicomedia and Milan, was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of Diocletian, but to the permanent form of government which he had instituted. It was in vain that, a few months after his abdication, his successors dedicated, un∣der his name, those magnificent baths, whose ruins still supply the ground as well as the ma∣terials for so many churches and convents <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">See Gruter Inscrip. p. 178. The six princes are all mentioned, Diocletian and Maximian as the senior Augusti and fathers of the emperors. They jointly dedicate, for the use of <HI>their own</HI> Romans, this magnificent edifice. The architects have delineated the ruins of these <HI>Thermae;</HI> and the antiquarians, particularly Donatus and Nardini, have ascertained the ground which they covered. One of the great rooms is now the Carthusian church; and even one of the porter's lodges is sufficient to form another church, which belongs to the Feuillans.</NOTE>. The tranquillity of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was disturbed by the impatient mur∣murs of the Romans; and a report was insensibly
<PB N="198" REF="213"/>
circulated, that the sums expended in erecting those buildings, would soon be required at their hands. About that time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the state, had in∣duced him to make a very strict and rigorous in∣quisition into the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation, both on their lands and on their persons. A very minute survey ap∣pears to have been taken of their real estates; and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">See Lactantius de M. P. c. 26. 31.</NOTE>. The privileges which had exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces, were no longer regarded: and the officers of the revenue already began to number the Roman people, and to settle the proportion of the new taxes. Even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly extinguished, the tamest subjects have sometimes ventured to resist an unprecedented invasion of their property; but on this occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult, and the sense of private interest was quickened by that of national honour. The conquest of Macedonia, as we have already ob∣served, had delivered the Roman people from the weight of personal taxes. Though they had experienced every form of despotism, they had now enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years; nor could they patiently brook the inso∣lence of an Illyrian peasant, who, from his distant residence in Asia, presumed to number Rome
<PB N="199" REF="214"/>
among the tributary cities of his empire. The rising fury of the people was encouraged by the authority, or at least the connivance, of the se∣nate; and the feeble remains of the Praetorian guards, who had reason to apprehend their own dissolution, embraced so honourable a pretence, and declared their readiness to draw their swords in the service of their oppressed country. It was the wish, and it soon became the hope, of every citizen, that after expelling from Italy their fo∣reign tyrants, they should elect a prince who, by the place of his residence, and by his maxims of government, might once more deserve the title of Roman emperor. The name, as well as the situation, of Maxentius, determined in his favour the popular enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Maxentius was the son of the emperor Maxi∣mian, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maxentius declared emperor at Rome. A. D. 306. 28th Oct.</NOTE> and he had married the daughter of Gale∣rius. His birth and alliance seemed to offer him the fairest promise of succeeding to the empire; but his vices and incapacity procured him the same exclusion from the dignity of Caesar, which Constantine had deserved by a dangerous supe∣riority of merit. The policy of Galerius pre∣ferred such associates, as would never disgrace the choice, nor dispute the commands of their benefactor. An obscure stranger was therefore raised to the throne of Italy, and the son of the late emperor of the West was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles distant from the capital. The gloomy passions of his soul, shame, vexation, and rage were in∣flamed by envy on the news of Constantine's suc∣cess;
<PB N="200" REF="215"/>
but the hopes of Maxentius revived with the public discontent, and he was easily persuaded to unite his personal injury and pretensions with the cause of the Roman people. Two Praetorian tribunes and a commissary of provisions under∣took the management of the conspiracy; and as every order of men was actuated by the same spirit, the immediate event was neither doubtful nor difficult. The praefect of the city, and a few magistrates, who maintained their fidelity to Se∣verus, were massacred by the guards; and Max∣entius, invested with the Imperial ornaments, was acknowledged by the applauding senate and people as the protector of the Roman freedom and dignity. It is uncertain whether Maximian was previously acquainted with the conspiracy; but as soon as the standard of rebellion was erect∣ed at Rome, the old emperor broke from the re∣tirement <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximian re-assumes the purple.</NOTE> where the authority of Diocletian had condemned him to pass a life of melancholy soli∣tude, and concealed his returning ambition under the disguise of paternal tenderness.

<P><PB N="201" REF="216"/>
According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague, the emperor Severus immedi∣ately hastened to Rome, in the full confidence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat and death of Severus.</NOTE> that, by his unexpected celerity, he should easily suppress the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licentious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut against him, the walls filled with men and arms, an ex∣perienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops without spirit or affection. A large body of Moors deserted to the enemy, al∣lured by the promise of a large donative; and, if it be true that they had been levied by Maxi∣mian in his African war, preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of alle∣giance. Anulinus, the Praetorian praefect, de∣clared himself in favour of Maxentius, and drew after him the most considerable part of the troops, accustomed to obey his commands. Rome, ac∣cording to the expression of an orator, recalled her armies; and the unfortunate Severus, desti∣tute of force and of counsel, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation to Ravenna. Here he might for some time have been safe. The for∣tifications of Ravenna were able to resist the at∣tempts, and the morasses that surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach, of the Italian army. The sea, which Severus com∣manded with a powerful fleet, secured him an inexhaustible supply of provisions, and gave a free entrance to the legions, which, on the return of spring, would advance to his assistance from
<PB N="202" REF="217"/>
Illyricum and the East. Maximian, who con∣ducted the siege in person, was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his army in the fruitless enterprise, and that he had nothing to hope either from force or famine. With an art more suitable to the character of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack, not so much against the walls of Ravenna, as against the mind of Severus. The treachery which he had expe∣rienced, disposed that unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and adherents. The emissaries of Maximian easily persuaded his credulity, that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town, and prevailed upon his fears not to ex∣pose himself to the discretion of an irritated con∣queror, but to accept the faith of an honourable capitulation. He was at first received with hu∣manity, and treated with respect. Maximian conducted the captive emperor to Rome, and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had secured his life by the resignation of the purple. But Severus could obtain only an easy death and an Imperial funeral. When the sentence was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 307. February.</NOTE> signed to him, the manner of executing it was left to his own choice; he preferred the favourite mode of the ancients, that of opening his veins: and as soon as he expired, his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been constructed for the family of Gallienus <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">The circumstances of this war, and the death of Severus, are very doubtfully and variously told in our ancient fragments (see Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 555.).

Though the characters of Constantine and Maxentius had very little affinity with each other, their situation and interest were the same; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximian gives his daughter Fausta, and the title of Augustus, to Con∣stantine. A. D. 307. March 31.</NOTE> prudence seemed to require that they should unite their forces against the common enemy. Not∣withstanding the superiority of his age and dig∣nity, the indefatigable Maximian passed the Alps, and courting a personal interview with the sove∣reign of Gaul, carried with him his daughter Fausta as the pledge of the new alliance. The marriage was celebrated at Arles with every cir∣cumstance of magnificence; and the ancient col∣league of Diocletian, who again asserted his claim to the western empire, conferred on his son-in∣law and ally the title of Augustus. By consent∣ing to receive that honour from Maximian, Con∣stantine seemed to embrace the cause of Rome and of the senate; but his professions were am∣biguous, and his assistance slow and ineffectual.

Romans; or, as he expressed his intentions, in the furious language of a barbarian, to extir∣pate the senate, and to destroy the people by the sword. But the skill of Maximian had concerted a prudent system of defence. The invader found every place hostile, fortified, and inaccessible; and though he forced his way as far as Narni, within sixty miles of Rome, his dominion in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp. Sensible of the increasing difficulties of his enter∣prise, the haughty Galerius made the first ad∣vances towards a reconciliation, and dispatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the Roman princes by the offer of a conference and the declaration of his paternal regard for Maxen∣tius, who might obtain much more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance of war <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">With regard to this negociation, see the fragments of an ano∣nymous Historian, published by Valesius at the end of his edition of Ammianus Marcellinus, p. 711.

The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness, his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and it was not long be∣fore he discovered, that, unless he provided for his safety by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the fate of Severus. The wealth, which the Romans defended against his rapacious tyranny, they freely contributed for his destruc∣tion. The name of Maximian, the popular arts of his son, the secret distribution of large sums, and the promise of still more liberal rewards,

checked the ardour, and corrupted the fidelity of the Illyrian legions; and when Galerius at length gave the signal of the retreat, it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his ve∣terans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory and honour. A con∣temporary writer assigns two other causes for the failure of the expedition; but they are both of such a nature, that a cautious historian will scarcely venture to adopt them. We are told that Galerius, who had formed a very imperfect notion of the greatness of Rome by the cities of the East, with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the siege of that immense capital. But the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible to the enemy; Rome had long since been accustomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror; nor could the tempo∣rary enthusiasm of the people have long con∣tended against the discipline and valour of the legions. We are likewise informed, that the le∣gions themselves were struck with horror and re∣morse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to violate the sanctity of their venerable parent <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

veterans. His father had undertaken a second journey into Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who had assembled an army on the frontier, to join the pursuit and to complete the victory. But the actions of Constantine were guided by reason and not by resentment. He persisted in the wise resolution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire, and he no longer hated Galerius, when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an object of terror <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

<P>The mind of Galerius was the most susceptible <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elevation of Licinius to the rank of Augus∣tus;</NOTE> of the sterner passions, but it was not however incapable of a sincere and lasting friendship. Li∣cinius, whose manners as well as character were <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 307. Nov. 11.</NOTE> not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affection and esteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period perhaps of their youth and obscurity. It had been cemented by the freedom and dangers of a military life; they had advanced, almost by equal steps, through the successive honours of the service; and as soon as Galerius was invested with the Imperial dig∣nity, he seems to have conceived the design of raising his companion to the same rank with him∣self. During the short period of his prosperity, he considered the rank of Caesar as unworthy of the age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him the place of Constantius, and the empire of the West. While the emperor
<PB N="208" REF="223"/>
was employed in the Italian war, he intrusted his friend with the defence of the Danube; and im∣mediately after his return from that unfortunate expedition, he invested Licinius with the vacant purple of Severus, resigning to his immediate command the provinces of Illyricum <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">M. de Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 559.) has proved, that Licinius, without passing through the intermediate rank of Caesar, was declared Augustus, the 11th of November, A.

The <NOTE PLACE="marg">and of Maximin.</NOTE> news of his promotion was no sooner carried into the East, than Maximin, who governed, or ra∣ther oppressed, the countries of Egypt and Syria, betrayed his envy and discontent, disdained the inferior name of Caesar, and notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius, exacted, almost by violence, the equal title of Augustus <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

For the first, and indeed for the last time, the Roman world was administered by six emperors. In the West, Constantine and Maxentius affected <NOTE PLACE="marg">Six empe∣rors. A.

<P>When Maximian had reluctantly abdicated the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Misfor∣tunes of Maximi∣an.</NOTE> empire, the venal orators of the times applauded his philosophic moderation. When his ambition excited, or at least encouraged, a civil war, they returned thanks to his generous patriotism, and gently censured that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him from the public ser∣vice <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">See Panegyr.

But it was impossible, that minds like those of Maximian and his son, could long possess in harmony an undivided power. Maxentius considered himself as the legal sovereign of Italy, elected by the Roman senate and people; nor would he endure the controul of his father, who arrogantly declared, that by <HI>his</HI> name and abi∣lities the rash youth had been established on the throne. The cause was solemnly pleaded before the Praetorian guards, and those troops, who dreaded the severity of the old emperor, espoused the party of Maxentius <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

The life and freedom of Maximian were however respected, and he re∣tired from Italy into Illyricum, affecting to la∣ment his past conduct, and secretly contriving

But Galerius, who was well ac∣quainted with his character, soon obliged him to leave his dominions, and the last refuge of the disappointed Maximian was the court of his son-in-law Constantine <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Ab urbe pulsum, ab Italia fugatum, ab Illyrico repudiatum, tuis provinciis, tuis copiis, tuo palatio recepisti.

Had he persevered in this resolution, he might have ended his life with less dignity indeed than in his first retire∣ment, yet, however, with comfort and reputa∣tion. But the near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the state from whence he was fallen, and he resolved, by a desperate effort, either to reign or to perish. An incursion of the Franks had summoned Constantine, with a part of his army, to the banks of the Rhine; the remainder of the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul, which lay exposed to the enterprises of the Italian emperor, and a considerable treasure was deposited in the city of Arles. Maximian either craftily invented, or hastily credited, a vain report of the death of
<PB N="211" REF="226"/>
Constantine. Without hesitation he ascended the throne, seized the treasure, and scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the soldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the memory of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could establish his authority, or finish the nego∣tiation which he appears to have entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Constan∣tine defeated all his hopes. On the first news of his perfidy and ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to the Saone, embarked on the last mentioned river at Chalons, and at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived at the gates of Arles, with a military force which it was impossible for Max∣imian to resist, and which scarcely permitted him to take refuge in the neighbouring city of Mar∣seilles. The narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either for the escape of Maximian, or for the succours of Maxentius, if the latter should chuse to disguise his invasion of Gaul, under the honourable pre∣tence of defending a distressed, or, as he might allege, an injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay, Constantine gave orders for an immediate assault; but the scaling∣ladders were found too short for the height of the walls, and Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did against the arms of Caesar, if the garrison, conscious either of their fault or of their danger, had not pur∣chased

After he had lost the assistance, and disdained the moderate counsels, of Diocletian, the second period of his active life was a series of public calamities and personal mortifications, which were terminated, in about three years, by an ignominious death. He de∣served his fate; but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of Constantine, if he had spared an old man, the benefactor of his fa∣ther, and the father of his wife. During the whole of this melancholy transaction, it appears that Fausta sacrificed the sentiments of nature to her conjugal duties <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. ii. p. 82. Eumenius in Panegyr.

his retreat from Italy about four years, and wisely relinquishing his views of universal empire, he devoted the remainder of his life to the enjoy∣ment of pleasure, and to the execution of some works of public utility, among which we may distinguish the discharging into the Danube the superfluous waters of the lake Pelso, and the cutting down the immense forests that encom∣passed it; an operation worthy of a monarch, since it gave an extensive country to the agricul∣ture of his Pannonian subjects <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor, c. 40. But that lake was situated on the Upper Pannonia, near the borders of Noricum; and the province of Valeria (a name which the wife of Galerius gave to the drained country) undoubtedly lay between the Drave and the Danube (Sex∣tus Rufus, c. 9.) I should therefore suspect that Victor has con∣founded the lake Pelso with the Volocean marches, or, as they are now called, the lake Sabaton. It is placed in the heart of Valeria, and its present extent is not less than 12 Hungarian miles (about 70 English) in length, and two in breadth. See Severini Pannonia, l. i. c. 9.</NOTE>.

He had no sooner expired in his palace of Nico∣media, than the two emperors who were indebted for their purple to his favour, began to collect <NOTE PLACE="marg">His domi∣nion shared between Maximin and Lici∣nius.</NOTE> their forces, with the intention either of disput∣ing, or of dividing, the dominions which he had left without a master. They were persuaded however to desist from the former design, and to agree in the latter. The provinces of Asia fell to the share of Maximin, and those of Europe augmented the portion of Licinius. The Helle∣spont and the Thracian Bosphorus formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of those narrow seas, which flowed in the midst of the Roman world, were covered with soldiers, with arms, and with fortifications. The deaths of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors to four. The sense of their true interest soon connected Licinius and Constantine; a secret al∣liance was concluded between Maximin and Maxentius, and their unhappy subjects expected with terror the bloody consequences of their in∣evitable dissensions, which were no longer re∣strained by the fear or the respect which they had entertained for Galerius <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">See Eusebius, l. ix. 6. 10.

<P>Among so many crimes and misfortunes occa∣sioned <NOTE PLACE="marg">Admini∣stration of Constan∣tine in Gaul. A. D. 306—312.</NOTE> by the passions of the Roman princes, there is some pleasure in discovering a single
<PB N="215" REF="230"/>
action which may be ascribed to their virtue. In the sixth year of his reign, Constantine visited the city of Autun, and generously remitted the arrears of tribute, reducing at the same time the proportion of their assessment, from twenty-five to eighteen thousand heads, subject to the real and personal capitation <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">See the viiith Panegyr. in which Eumenius displays, in the presence of Constantine, the misery and the gratitude of the city of Autun.</NOTE>. Yet even this indul∣gence affords the most unquestionable proof of the public misery. This tax was so extremely oppressive, either in itself or in the mode of col∣lecting it, that whilst the revenue was increased by extortion, it was diminished by despair: a considerable part of the territory of Autun was left uncultivated; and great numbers of the pro∣vincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws, than to support the weight of civil society. It is but too probable, that the bountiful emperor relieved, by a partial act of liberality, one among the many evils which he had caused by his ge∣neral maxims of administration. But even those maxims were less the effect of choice than of ne∣cessity. And if we except the death of Maxi∣mian, the reign of Constantine in Gaul seems to have been the most innocent and even virtuous period of his life. The provinces were protected by his presence from the inroads of the barba∣rians, who either dreaded or experienced his ac∣tive valour. After a signal victory over the Franks and Alemanni, several of their princes
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>
were exposed by his order to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre of Treves, and the people seem to have enjoyed the spectacle, without discover∣ing, in such a treatment of royal captives, any thing that was repugnant to the laws of nations or of humanity <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Eutropius, x. 3.

<P>The virtues of Constantine were rendered more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyranny of Maxen∣tius in Italy and Africa. A. D. 306—312.</NOTE> illustrious by the vices of Maxentius. Whilst the Gallic provinces enjoyed as much happiness as the condition of the times was capable of re∣ceiving, Italy and Africa groaned under the do∣minion of a tyrant as contemptible as he was odious. The zeal of flattery and faction has in∣deed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquished to the glory of their successful rivals; but even those writers who have revealed, with the most freedom and pleasure, the faults of Constantine, unanimously confess, that Maxen∣tius was cruel, rapacious, and profligate <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Julian excludes Maxentius from the banquet of the Caesars with abhorrence and contempt; and Zosimus (l. ii. p. 85.) accuses him of every kind of cruelty and profligacy.</NOTE>. He had the good fortune to suppress a slight rebel∣lion in Africa. The governor and a few adhe∣rents had been guilty; the province suffered for their crime. The flourishing cities of Cirtha and Carthage, and the whole extent of that fertile country, were wasted by fire and sword. The abuse of victory was followed by the abuse of law and justice. A formidable army of sycophants
<PB N="217" REF="232"/>

Aurelius Victor.</NOTE>. So signal a victory was celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and Maxentius exposed to the eyes of the people the spoils and captives of a Roman province. The state of the capital was no less deserving of compassion than that of Africa. The wealth of Rome supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expences, and the ministers of his revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine. It was under his reign that the method of exacting a <HI>free gift</HI> from the senators was first invented; and as the sum was insensibly increased, the pretences of levying it, a victory, a birth, a marriage, or an Imperial consulship, were pro∣portionably multiplied <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The passage of Aurelius Victor should be read in the following manner.

Maxentius had im∣bibed the same implacable aversion to the senate, which had characterized most of the former ty∣rants of Rome: nor was it possible for his un∣grateful temper to forgive the generous fidelity which had raised him to the throne, and sup∣ported him against all his enemies. The lives of the senators were exposed to his jealous suspi∣cions, the dishonour of their wives and daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual pas∣sions <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Panegyr.

It may be presumed, that an Imperial lover was seldom reduced to sigh in vain; but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual, he had recourse to violence; and there remains <HI>one</HI> me∣morable example of a noble matron, who pre∣served her chastity by a voluntary death.

A prince of such a character, alike inca∣pable of governing either in peace or in war, might purchase the support, but he could never obtain the esteem, of the army. Yet his pride was equal to his other vices.

he was sufficiently acquainted, at first dissembled the insult, and sought for redress by the milder expedients of negotiation, till he was convinced, that the hostile and ambitious designs of the Italian emperor made it necessary for him to arm in his own defence. Maxentius, who openly avowed his pretensions to the whole monarchy of the West, had already prepared a very consider∣able force to invade the Gallic provinces on the side of Rhaetia; and though he could not expect any assistance from Licinius, he was flattered with the hope that the legions of Illyricum, allured by his presents and promises, would desert the standard of that prince, and unanimously declare themselves his soldiers and subjects <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 84, 85.

The enterprise was as full of danger as of glory; and the unsuccessful event of two former invasions was sufficient to inspire the most serious <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions.</NOTE> apprehensions. The veteran troops who revered the name of Maximian, had embraced in both those wars the party of his son, and were now restrained by a sense of honour, as well as of interest, from entertaining an idea of a second desertion. Maxentius, who considered the Prae∣torian guards as the firmest defence of his throne, had increased them to their ancient establish∣ment; and they composed, including the rest of the Italians who were inlisted into his service, a formidable body of fourscore thousand men. Forty thousand Moors and Carthaginians had been raised since the reduction of Africa. Even Sicily furnished its proportion of troops; and the armies of Maxentius amounted to one hun∣dred and seventy thousand foot, and eighteen thousand horse. The wealth of Italy supplied the expences of the war; and the adjacent pro∣vinces were exhausted, to form immense maga∣zines of corn and every other kind of provisions. The whole force of Constantine consisted of ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. ii. p. 86.) has given us this curious account of the forces on both sides.

At the head of about forty thousand soldiers, he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at least four times superior to his own. But the armies of Rome, placed at a secure distance from danger, were enervated by indulgence and luxury. Habituat∣ed to the baths and theatres of Rome, they took the field with reluctance, and were chiefly com∣posed of veterans who had almost forgotten, or of new levies, who had never acquired, the use of arms and the practice of war. The hardy legions of Gaul had long defended the frontiers of the empire against the barbarians of the North; and in the performance of that laborious service, their valour was exercised and their discipline confirmed. There appeared the same difference between the leaders as between the armies. Caprice or flattery had tempted Maxentius with the hopes of conquest; but these aspiring hopes soon gave way to the habits of pleasure and the consciousness of his inexperience. The intrepid mind of Constantine had been trained from his earliest youth to war, to action, and to military command.</P>

Tradition, and a resemblance of names <HI>(Alpes Penninae),</HI> had assigned the first of these for the march of Hannibal (see Simler de Alpibus). The Chevalier de Folard (Polybe, tom. iv.) and M. d'Anville have led him over Mount Genevre.

But in the course of the intermediate period, the generals, who have attempted the passage, have seldom experienced any difficulty or resistance.

active diligence, that he descended into the plain of Piedmont before the court of Maxentius had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine. The city of Susa, however, which is situated at the foot of Mount Cenis, was surrounded with walls, and provided with a garrison sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader; but the impatience of Constantine's troops disdained the tedious forms of a siege. The same day that they appeared before Susa, they applied fire to the gates, and ladders to the walls; and mount∣ing to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows, they entered the place sword in hand, and cut in pieces the greatest part of the gar∣rison. The flames were extinguished by the care of Constantine, and the remains of Susa pre∣served from total destruction. About forty miles from thence, a more severe contest awaited him. A numerous army of Italians was assem∣bled under the lieutenants of Maxentius in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Turin.</NOTE> plains of Turin. Its principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which the Romans, since the decline of their discipline, had borrow∣ed from the nations of the East. The horses, as well as the men, were clothed in complete armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies. The aspect of this cavalry was formidable, their weight almost irresistible; and as, on this occasion, their gene∣rals had drawn them up in a compact column or wedge, with a sharp point, and with spreading
<PB N="225" REF="240"/>
flanks, they flattered themselves that they should easily break and trample down the army of Con∣stantine. They might perhaps have succeeded in their design, had not their experienced ad∣versary embraced the same method of defence, which in similar circumstances had been prac∣tised by Aurelian. The skilful evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this massy co∣lumn of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fled in confusion towards Turin; and as the gates of the city were shut against them, very few escap∣ed the sword of the victorious pursuers. By this important service, Turin deserved to experience the clemency and even favour of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of Italy between the Alps and the Po not only acknowledged the power, but embraced with zeal the party, of Constantine <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Zosimus as well as Eusebius hasten from the passage of the Alps, to the decisive action near Rome.

<P>From Milan to Rome, the Aemilian and Fla∣minian <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege and battle of Verona.</NOTE> highways offered an easy march of about four hundred miles; but though Constantine was impatient to encounter the tyrant, he pru∣dently directed his operations against another army of Italians, who, by their strength and position, might either oppose his progress, or, in case of a misfortune, might intercept his retreat. Ruricius Pompeianus, a general distin∣guished by his valour and ability, had under his
<PB N="226" REF="241"/>
command the city of Verona, and all the troops that were stationed in the province of Venetia. As soon as he was informed that Constantine was advancing towards him, he detached a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an en∣gagement near Brescia, and pursued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of Verona. The necessity, the importance, and the diffi∣culties of the siege of Verona, immediately pre∣sented themselves to the sagacious mind of Con∣stantine <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">The Marquis Maffei has examined the siege and battle of Ve∣rona, with that degree of attention and accuracy, which was due to a memorable action that happened in his native country. The for∣tifications of that city, constructed by Gallienus, were less extensive than the modern walls, and the Amphitheatre was not included within their circumference. See Verona Illustrata, Part i. p. 142. 150.</NOTE> The city was accessible only by a narrow peninsula towards the west, as the other three sides were surrounded by the Adige, a ra∣pid river which covered the province of Venetia, from whence the besieged derived an inexhausti∣ble supply of men and provisions. It was not without great difficulty, and after several fruitless attempts, that Constantine found means to pass the river at some distance above the city, and in a place where the torrent was less violent. He then encompassed Verona with strong lines, push∣ed his attacks with prudent vigour, and repelled a desperate sally of Pompeianus. That intrepid general, when he had used every means of de∣fence that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could afford, secretly escaped from Ve∣rona,
<PB N="227" REF="242"/>
anxious not for his own but for the pub∣lic safety. With indefatigable diligence he soon collected an army sufficient either to meet Con∣stantine in the field, or to attack him if he ob∣stinately remained within his lines. The em∣peror, attentive to the motions, and informed of the approach, of so formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the siege, whilst, at the head of those troops on whose valour and fidelity he more particularly depended, he advanced in person to engage the general of Maxentius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according to the usual practice of war; but their experienced leader, perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own, suddenly changed his disposi∣tion, and reducing the second, extended the front of his first line, to a just proportion with that of the enemy. Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can execute without confusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove decisive: but as this engagement began towards the close of the day, and was contested with great obsti∣nacy during the whole night, there was less room for the conduct of the generals than for the cou∣rage of the soldiers. The return of light dis∣played the victory of Constantine, and a field of carnage covered with many thousands of the van∣quished Italians. Their general Pompeianus was found among the slain; Verona immediately surrendered at discretion, and the garrison was

made prisoners of war <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">They wanted chains for so great a multitude of captives; and the whole council was at a loss; but the sagacious conqueror ima∣gined the happy expedient of converting into fetters the swords of the vanquished.

When the officers of the victorious army congratulated their master on this important success, they ventured to add some respectful complaints, of such a nature, however, as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without displeasure. They represented to Constantine, that, not contented with perform∣ing all the duties of a commander, he had ex∣posed his own person with an excess of valour which almost degenerated into rashness; and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the preservation of a life, in which the safety of Rome and of the empire was involved <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Panegyr.

<P>While Constantine signalized his conduct and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indolence and fears of Maxen∣tius.</NOTE> valour in the field, the sovereign of Italy appear∣ed insensible of the calamities and danger of a civil was which raged in the heart of his domi∣nions.

Concealing, or at least attempting to conceal, from the public knowledge the mis∣fortunes of his arms <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Literas calamitatum suarum indices supprimebat. Panegyr.

<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
was scarcely sufficient to awaken him from this fatal security; he flattered himself, that his well-known liberality, and the majesty of the Roman name, which had already delivered him from two invasions, would dissipate with the same facility the rebellious army of Gaul. The officers of experience and ability, who had served under the banners of Maximian, were at length compelled to inform his effeminate son of the imminent danger to which he was reduced; and, with a freedom that at once surprised and con∣vinced him, to urge the necessity of preventing his ruin, by a vigorous exertion of his remaining power. The resources of Maxentius, both of men and money, were still considerable. The Praetorian guards felt how strongly their own interest and safety were connected with his cause; and a third army was soon collected, more nu∣merous than those which had been lost in the battles of Turin and Verona. It was far from the intention of the emperor to lead his troops in person. A stranger to the exercises of war, he trembled at the apprehension of so dangerous a contest; and as fear is commonly superstitious, he listened with melancholy attention to the ru∣mours of omens and presages which seemed to menace his life and empire. Shame at length supplied the place of courage, and forced him to take the field. He was unable to sustain the
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
contempt of the Roman people. The circus resounded with their indignant clamours, and they tumultuously besieged the gates of the pa∣lace, reproaching the pusillanimity of their in∣dolent sovereign, and celebrating the heroic spi∣rit of Constantine <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">See Panegyr. Vet. xi. 16. Lactantius de M. P. c. 44.</NOTE>. Before Maxentius left Rome, he consulted the Sibylline books.

Constantine had always apprehended that the tyrant would consult the dictates of fear, and perhaps of prudence; and that, instead of risk∣ing his last hopes in a general engagement, he would shut himself up within the walls of Rome. His ample magazines secured him against the danger of famine; and as the situation of Con∣stantine admitted not of delay, he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of destroying with fire and sword the Imperial city, the noblest reward of his victory, and the deliverance of

Their long front filled a very spacious plain, and their deep array reached to the banks of the Tyber, which cover∣ed their rear, and forbade their retreat. We are informed, and we may believe, that Constantine disposed his troops with consummate skill, and that he chose for himself the post of honour and danger. Distinguished by the splendour of his arms, he charged in person the cavalry of his rival; and his irresistible attack determined the fortune of the day. The cavalry of Maxentius was principally composed either of unwieldy cui∣rassiers, or of light Moors and Numidians. They yielded to the vigour of the Gallic horse, which possessed more activity than the one, more firmness than the other. The defeat of the two wings left the infantry without any protection on
<PB N="232" REF="247"/>
its flanks, and the undisciplined Italians fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant whom they had always hated, and whom they no longer feared. The Praetorians, conscious that their offences were beyond the reach of mercy, were animated by revenge and despair. Notwithstanding their repeated efforts, those brave veterans were unable to recover the vic∣tory: they obtained, however, an honourable death; and it was observed, that their bodies covered the same ground which had been occu∣pied by their ranks <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Exceptis latrocinii illius primis auctoribus, qui desperatâ veniâ, locum quem pugnae sumpserant texere corporibus. Panegyr. Vet. ix. 17.</NOTE>. The confusion then be∣came general, and the dismayed troops of Max∣entius, pursued by an implacable enemy, rushed by thousands into the deep and rapid stream of the Tyber. The emperor himself attempted to escape back into the city over the Milvian bridge, but the crowds which pressed together through that narrow passage, forced him into the river, where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his armour <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">A very idle rumour soon prevailed, that Maxentius, who had not taken any precaution for his own retreat, had contrived a very artful snare to destroy the army of the pursuers; but that the wooden bridge which was to have been loosened on the approach of Con∣stantine, unluckily broke down under the weight of the flying Ita∣lians. M. de Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 576.) very seriously examines whether, in contradiction to com∣mon sense, the testimony of Eusebius and Zosimus ought to prevail over the silence of Lactantius, Nazarius, and the anonymous, but contemporary orator, who composed the ninth panegyric.</NOTE>. His body, which had sunk very deep into the mud, was found with some

difficulty the next day. The sight of his head, when it was exposed to the eyes of the people, convinced them of their deliverance, and admo∣nished them to receive, with acclamations of loy∣alty and gratitude, the fortunate Constantine, who thus atchieved by his valour and ability the most splendid enterprise of his life <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 86—88, and the two Panegyrics, the for∣mer of which was pronounced a few months afterwards, afford the clearest notion of this great battle. Lactantius, Eusebius, and even the Epitomes, supply several useful hints.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the use of victory, Constantine neither de∣served <NOTE PLACE="marg">His recep∣tion,</NOTE> the praise of clemency, nor incurred the censure of immoderate rigour <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, the enemy of Constantine, allows (l. ii. p. 88.), that only a few of the friends of Maxentius were put to death; but we may remark the expressive passage of Nazarius (Panegyr. Vet. x. 6.), Omnibus qui labefactari statum ejus poterant cum stirpe de∣letis. The other orator (Panegyr. Vet. ix. 20, 21.) contents him∣self with observing, that Constantine, when he entered Rome, did not imitate the cruel massacres of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla.</NOTE>. He inflicted the same treatment, to which a defeat would have exposed his own person and family, put to death the two sons of the tyrant, and carefully extir∣pated his whole race. The most distinguished adherents of Maxentius must have expected to share his fate, as they had shared his prosperity and his crimes; but when the Roman people loudly demanded a greater number of victims, the conqueror resisted, with firmness and huma∣nity, those servile clamours which were dictated by flattery as well as by resentment. Informers were punished and discouraged; the innocent, who had suffered under the late tyranny, were recalled from exile, and restored to their estates.

A general act of oblivion quieted the minds and settled the property of the people, both in Italy and in Africa <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">See the two Panegyrics, and the laws of this and the ensuing year, in the Theodosian Code.</NOTE>. The first time that Constantine honoured the senate with his presence, he reca∣pitulated his own services and exploits in a mo∣dest oration, assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard, and promised to re-establish its ancient dignity and privileges. The grateful senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty titles of honour, which it was yet in their power to bestow; and without presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they passed a de∣cree to assign him the first rank among the three <HI>Augusti</HI> who governed the Roman world <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Panegyr. Vet. ix. 20. Lactantius de M. P. c. 44. Maximin, who was confessedly the eldest Caesar, claimed, with some shew of reason, the first rank among the Augusti.</NOTE>. Games and festivals were instituted to preserve the fame of his victory, and several edifices raised at the expence of Maxentius, were dedicated to the honour of his successful rival. The triumphal arch of Constantine still remains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arts, and a singular testimony of the meanest vanity. As it was not possible to find in the capital of the empire, a sculptor who was capable of adorning that pub∣lic monument; the arch of Trajan, without any respect either for his memory or for the rules of propriety, was stripped of its most elegant figures. The difference of times and persons, of actions and characters, was totally disregarded. The
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
Parthian captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never carried his arms beyond the Euphrates; and curious antiquarians can still discover the head of Trajan on the trophies of Constantine. The new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the vacancies of ancient sculpture, are executed in the rudest and most unskilful manner <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Adhuc cuncta opera quae magnifice construxerat, urbis fanum, atque basilicam, Flavii meritis patres sacravere.

<P>The final abolition of the Praetorian guards <NOTE PLACE="marg">and con∣duct at Rome.</NOTE> was a measure of prudence as well as of revenge. Those haughty troops, whose numbers and pri∣vileges had been restored, and even augmented, by Maxentius, were for ever suppressed by Con∣stantine. Their fortified camp was destroyed, and the few Praetorians who had escaped the fury of the sword, were dispersed among the legions, and banished to the frontiers of the empire, where they might be serviceable without again becoming dangerous. <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Praetoriae legiones ac subsidia factionibus aptiora quam urbi Romae, sublata penitus; simul arma atque usus indumenti militaris. Aurelius Victor. Zosimus (l. ii. p. 89.) mentions this fact as an historian; and it is very pompously celebrated in the ninth Pane∣gyric.</NOTE>. By suppressing the troops which were usually stationed in Rome, Constantine gave the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the disarmed capital was exposed without protection to the insults or neglect of its distant master. We may observe,
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
that in this last effort to preserve their expiring freedom, the Romans, from the apprehension of a tribute, had raised Maxentius to the throne. He exacted that tribute from the senate under the name of a free gift. They implored the assistance of Constantine. He vanquished the tyrant, and converted the free gift into a per∣petual tax. The senators, according to the de∣claration which was required of their property, were divided into several classes. The most opulent paid annually eight pounds of gold, the next class paid four, the last two, and those whose poverty might have claimed an exemp∣tion, were assessed however at seven pieces of gold. Besides the regular members of the se∣nate, their sons, their descendants, and even their relations, enjoyed the vain privileges, and sup∣ported the heavy burdens, of the senatorial order; nor will it any longer excite our surprise, that Con∣stantine should be attentive to increase the number of persons who were included under so useful a de∣scription <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Ex omnibus provinciis optimates viros Curiae tuae pignera∣veris; ut Senatûs dignitas . . . . ex totius Orbis flore consisteret.

After the defeat of Maxentius, the victorious emperor passed no more than two or three months in Rome, which he visited twice during the remainder of his life, to celebrate the solemn festivals of the tenth and of the twen∣tieth years of his reign. Constantine was almost
<PB N="237" REF="252"/>
perpetually in motion to exercise the legions, or to inspect the state of the provinces. Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Sirmium, Naissus, and Thes∣salonica, were the occasional places of his resi∣dence, till he founded a NEW ROME on the con∣fines of Europe and Asia <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">From the Theodosian Code, we may now begin to trace the motions of the emperors; but the dates both of time and place have frequently been altered by the carelessness of transcribers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before Constantine marched into Italy, he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">His alli∣ance with Licinius. A. D. 313.

He had pro∣mised his sister Constantia in marriage to that prince; but the celebration of the nuptials was deferred till after the conclusion of the war, and the interview of the two emperors at Milan, which was appointed for that purpose, appeared to cement the union of their families and inte∣rests <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. ii. p. 89.) observes, that before the war, the sister of Constantine had been betrothed to Licinius. According to the younger Victor, Diocletian was invited to the nuptials; but having ventured to plead his age and infirmities, he received a second letter filled with reproaches for his supposed partiality to the cause of Maxentius and Maximin.</NOTE>. In the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged to take leave of each other. An inroad of the Franks summoned Constantine to the Rhine, and the hostile ap∣proach of the sovereign of Asia demanded the immediate presence of Licinius. Maximin had <NOTE PLACE="marg">War be∣tween Maximin and Lici∣nius. A.

<PB N="238" REF="253"/>
the depth of winter. The season was severe and tempestuous; great numbers of men as well as horses perished in the snow; and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains, he was oblig∣ed to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced marches. By this extra∣ordinary effort of diligence, he arrived, with a harassed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus, before the lieutenants of Licinius were apprised of his hostile inten∣tions. Byzantium surrendered to the power of Maximin, after a siege of eleven days. He was detained some days under the walls of Heraclea; and he had no sooner taken possession of that city, than he was alarmed by the intelligence, that Licinius had pitched his camp at the distance of only eighteen miles. After a fruitless nego∣ciation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The de∣feat, April 30,</NOTE> in which the two princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each other's adherents, they had recourse to arms. The emperor of the East commanded a disciplined and veteran army of above seventy thousand men, and Licinius, who had collected about thirty thousand Illyrians, was at first oppressed by the superiority of num∣bers. His military skill, and the firmness of his troops, restored the day, and obtained a decisive victory. The incredible speed which Maximin exerted in his flight, is much more celebrated than his prowess in the battle. Twenty-four hours afterwards he was seen pale, trembling, and without his Imperial ornaments, at Nico∣media, one hundred and sixty miles from the
<PB N="239" REF="254"/>
place of his defeat. The wealth of Asia was yet unexhausted; and though the flower of his vete∣rans had fallen in the late action, he had still power, if he could obtain time, to draw very numerous levies from Syria and Egypt. But he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>and death of the for∣mer.</P>
<P>August.</P></NOTE> survived his misfortune only three or four months. His death, which happened at Tarsus, was vari∣ously ascribed to despair, to poison, and to the divine justice. As Maximin was alike destitute of abilities and of virtue, he was lamented nei∣ther by the people nor by the soldiers. The provinces of the East, delivered from the terrors of civil war, cheerfully acknowledged the autho∣rity of Licinius <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">Zosimus mentions the defeat and death of Maximin as ordi∣nary events: but Lactantius expatiates on them (de M.

<P>The vanquished emperor left behind him two <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of Lici∣nius.</NOTE> children, a boy of about eight, and a girl of about seven, years old. Their inoffensive age might have excited compassion; but the com∣passion of Licinius was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him from <HI>extinguishing</HI> the name and memory of his adversary. The death of Severianus will admit of less excuse, as it was dictated neither by revenge nor by policy. The conqueror had never received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth, and the short and obscure reign of Severus in a distant part of the empire was already forgotten. But the exe∣cution of Candidianus was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude. He was the natural son
<PB N="240" REF="255"/>
of Galerius, the friend and benefactor of Lici∣nius. The prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight of a diadem; but he hoped that under the protection of princes, who were indebted to his favour for the Imperial purple, Candidianus might pass a secure and honourable life. He was now advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition, was sufficient to exasperate the jea∣lous mind of Licinius <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M. P. c. 50. Aurelius Victor touches on the different conduct of Licinius, and of Constantine, in the use of victory.</NOTE>. To these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny, we must add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that prince conferred on Galerius the title of Caesar, he had given him in marriage his daughter Valeria, whose melancholy adventures might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy. She had fulfilled and even surpassed the duties of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Unfortu∣nate fate of the empress Valeria and her mo∣ther.</NOTE> a wife. As she had not any children herself, she condescended to adopt the illegitimate son of her husband, and invariably displayed towards the unhappy Candidianus the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother. After the death of Galerius, her ample possessions provoked the avarice, and her personal attractions excited the desires, of his successor Maximin <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">The sensual appetites of Maximin were gratified at the expence of his subjects. His eunuchs, who forced away wives and virgins, examined their naked charms with anxious curiosity, lest any part of their body should be found unworthy of the royal embraces. Coyness and disdain were considered as treason, and the obstinate fair one was condemned to be drowned. A custom was gradually introduced, that no person should marry a wife without the per∣mission of the emperor, "ut ipse in omnibus nuptiis praegustator esset." Lactantius de M. P. c. 38.</NOTE>. He had a wife still alive,
<PB N="241" REF="256"/>
but divorce was permitted by the Roman law, and the fierce passions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gratification. The answer of Va∣leria was such as became the daughter and widow of emperors; but it was tempered by the pru∣dence which her defenceless condition compelled her to observe. She represented to the persons whom Maximin had employed on this occasion, that even if honour could permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a thought of second nuptials, decency at least must for∣bid her to listen to his addresses at a time when the ashes of her husband and his bene∣factor were still warm; and while the sorrows of her mind were still expressed by her mourn∣ing garments. She ventured to declare, that she could place very little confidence in the professions of a man, whose cruel inconstancy was capable of repudiating a faithful and affec∣tionate wife <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M. P. c. 39.</NOTE>. On this repulse, the love of Maximin was converted into fury, and as wit∣nesses and judges were always at his disposal, it was easy for him to cover his fury with an ap∣pearance of legal proceedings, and to assault the reputation as well as the happiness of Valeria. Her estates were confiscated, her eunuchs and domestics devoted to the most inhuman tortures,
<PB N="242" REF="257"/>
and several innocent and respectable matrons, who were honoured with her friendship, suffered death, on a false accusation of adultery. The empress herself, together with her mother Prisca, was condemned to exile; and as they were igno∣miniously hurried from place to place before they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces of the East, which, dur∣ing thirty years, had respected their august dig∣nity. Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes of his daughter; and, as the last return that he expected for the Im∣perial purple, which he had conferred upon Maximin, he entreated that Valeria might be permitted to share his retirement of Salona, and to close the eyes of her afflicted father <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">Diocletian at last sent cognatum suum, quendam militarem ac potentem virum, to intercede in favour of his daughter (Lactantius de M. P. c, 41.). We are not sufficiently acquainted with the his∣tory of these times, to point out the person who was employed.</NOTE>. He entreated, but as he could no longer threaten, his prayers were received with coldness and dis∣dain; and the pride of Maximin was gratified, in treating Diocletian as a suppliant, and his daughter as a criminal. The death of Maximin seemed to assure the empresses of a favourable alteration in their fortune. The public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard, and they easily found means to escape from the place of their exile, and to repair, though with some precaution, and in disguise, to the court of Li∣cinius. His behaviour, in the first days of his
<PB N="243" REF="258"/>
reign, and the honourable reception which he gave to young Candidianus, inspired Valeria with a secret satisfaction, both on her own account, and on that of her adopted son. But these grate∣ful prospects were soon succeeded by horrour and astonishment, and the bloody executions which stained the palace of Nicomedia, sufficiently con∣vinced her, that the throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than himself. Valeria consulted her safety by a hasty flight, and, still accompanied by her mother Prisca, they wandered above fifteen months <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Valeria quoque per varias provincias quindecim mensibus ple∣beio cultû pervagata.

It might perhaps have been expected that the conquerors, fatigued with civil war, and con∣nected by a private as well as public alliance, would have renounced, or at least would have suspended, any farther designs of ambition. And yet a year had scarcely elapsed after the death of Maximin, before the victorious emperors turned their arms against each other. The genius, the success, and the aspiring temper, of Constantine, may seem to mark him out as the aggressor; but the perfidious character of Licinius justifies the most unfavourable suspicions, and by the faint light which history reflects on this transaction <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">The curious reader, who consults the Valesian Fragment, p. 713, will perhaps accuse me of giving a bold and licentious para∣phrase; but if he considers it with attention, he will acknowledge that my interpretation is probable and consistent.</NOTE>, we may discover a conspiracy fomented by his arts against the authority of his colleague. Con∣stantine had lately given his sister Anastasia in marriage to Bassianus, a man of a considerable family and fortune, and had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of Caesar. According to the system of government instituted by Diocle∣tian, Italy, and perhaps Africa, were designed
<PB N="245" REF="260"/>
for his department in the empire. But the per∣formance of the promised favour was either at∣tended with so much delay, or accompanied with so many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of Bassianus was alienated rather than secured by the honourable distinction which he had obtained. His nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius, and that artful prince, by the means of his emissaries, soon contrived to enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new Caesar, to irritate his discontents, and to urge him to the rash enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit from the justice of Constantine. But the vigilant emperor discovered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after solemnly renouncing the alliance of Bassianus, despoiled him of the pur∣ple, and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and ingratitude. The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was required to deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in his domi∣nions, confirmed the suspicions already enter∣tained of his perfidy; and the indignities offered at Aemona, on the frontiers of Italy, to the statues of Constantine, became the signal of discord be∣tween the two princes <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">The situation of Aemona, or, as it is now called, Laybach, in Carniola (d'Anville Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 187.), may suggest a conjecture. As it lay to the north-east of the Julian Alps, that important territory became a natural object of dispute between the sovereigns of Italy and of Illyricum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The first battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia, situated on the river Save, about <NOTE PLACE="marg">First civil war be∣tween them.</NOTE>
<PB N="246" REF="261"/>
fifty miles above Sirmium <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Cibalis or Cibalae (whose name is still preserved in the obscure ruins of Swilei) was situated about fifty miles from Sirmium, the capital of Illyricum, and about one hundred from Taurunum, or Belgrade, and the conflux of the Danube and the Save. The Ro∣man garrisons and cities on those rivers are finely illustrated by M. d'Anville, in a memoir inserted in l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii.</NOTE>. From the incon∣siderable forces which in this important contest two such powerful monarchs brought into the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Cibalis. A. D. 315. 8th Oct.</NOTE> field, it may be inferred, that the one was sud∣denly provoked, and that the other was unex∣pectedly surprised. The emperor of the West had only twenty thousand, and the sovereign of the East no more than five and thirty thousand, men. The inferiority of number was, however, compensated by the advantage of the ground. Constantine had taken post in a defile about half a mile in breadth, between a steep hill and a deep morass, and in that situation he steadily expected and repulsed the first attack of the enemy. He pursued his success, and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions of Illyricum rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The missile weapons on both sides were soon ex∣hausted; the two armies, with equal valour, rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears, and the doubtful contest had already last∣ed from the dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening, when the right wing, which Constantine led in person, made a vigorous and decisive charge. The judicious retreat of Licinius saved
<PB N="247" REF="262"/>
the remainder of his troops from a total defeat; but when he computed his loss, which amounted to more than twenty thousand men, he thought it unsafe to pass the night in the presence of an active and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp and magazines, he marched away with se∣crecy and diligence at the head of the greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed be∣yond the danger of a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wife, his son, and his treasures, which he had deposited at Sirmium. Licinius passed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on the Save, hastened to collect a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In his flight he be∣stowed the precarious title of Caesar on Valens, his general of the Illyrian frontier <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. ii. p. 90, 91.) gives a very particular account of this battle; but the descriptions of Zosimus are rhetorical rather than military.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plain of Mardia in Thrace was the theatre <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Mardia.</NOTE> of a second battle no less obstinate and bloody than the former. The troops on both sides dis∣played the same valour and discipline; and the victory was once more decided by the superior abilities of Constantine, who directed a body of five thousand men to gain an advantageous height, from whence, during the heat of the action, they attacked the rear of the enemy, and made a very considerable slaughter. The troops of Licinius, however, presenting a double front, still main∣tained their ground, till the approach of night put an end to the combat, and secured their re∣treat

The Epitomes furnish some circumstances; but they frequently confound the two wars between Licinius and Constantine.</NOTE>. The loss of two battles, and of his bravest ve∣terans, reduced the fierce spirit of Licinius to sue for peace. His ambassador Mistrianus was admitted to the audience of Constantine; he ex∣patiated on the common topics of moderation and humanity, which are so familiar to the elo∣quence of the vanquished; represented, in the most insinuating language, that the event of the war was still doubtful, whilst its inevitable ca∣lamities were alike pernicious to both the con∣tending parties; and declared, that he was au∣thorised to propose a lasting and honourable peace in the name of the <HI>two</HI> emperors his mas∣ters. Constantine received the mention of Va∣lens with indignation and contempt. <Q>It was not for such a purpose, he sternly replied, that we have advanced from the shores of the western ocean in an uninterrupted course of combats and victories, that, after rejecting an ungrateful kinsman, we should accept for our colleague a contemptible slave. The abdica∣tion of Valens is the first article of the treaty <NOTE N="91" PLACE="foot">Petrus Patricius in Excerpt. Legat. p. 27. If it should be thought that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies more properly a son-in-law, we might conjecture, that Constantine, assuming the name as well as the du∣ties of a father, had adopted his younger brothers and sisters, the children of Theodora.

<PB N="249" REF="264"/>
It was necessary to accept this humiliating con∣dition, and the unhappy Valens, after a reign of a few days, was deprived of the purple and of his life. As soon as this obstacle was removed, the tranquillity of the Roman world was easily restored. The successive defeats of Licinius had ruined his forces, but they had displayed his courage and abilities. His situation was almost desperate, but the efforts of despair are some∣times formidable; and the good sense of Con∣stantine preferred a great and certain advantage to a third trial of the chance of arms. He con∣sented <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Treaty of peace.</P>
<P>December.</P></NOTE> to leave his rival, or, as he again styled Licinius, his friend and brother, in the possession of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt; but the provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, were yielded to the western empire, and the dominions of Constan∣tine now extended from the confines of Caledo∣nia to the extremity of Peloponnesus. It was stipulated by the same treaty, that three royal youths, the sons of the emperors, should be called to the hopes of the succession. Crispus and the young Constantine were soon afterwards declared Caesars in the West, while the younger Licinius was invested with the same dignity in the East. In this double proportion of honours, the con∣queror asserted the superiority of his arms and power <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 93. Anonym. Valesian. p. 713. Eutro∣pius, x. 5.

It is however certain, that the younger Con∣stantine and Licinius were not yet born; and it is highly probable that the promotion was made the 1st of March, A. D. 317. The treaty had probably stipulated that two Caesars might be created by the western, and one only by the eastern emperor; but each of them reserved to himself the choice of the persons.</NOTE>.</P>

The reconciliation of Constantine and Licinius, though it was embittered by resentment and jea∣lousy, by the remembrance of recent injuries, <NOTE PLACE="marg">General peace and laws of Constan∣tine. A. D. 315—323.</NOTE> and by the apprehension of future dangers, main∣tained, however, above eight years, the tran∣quillity of the Roman world. As a very regular series of the Imperial laws commences about this period, it would not be difficult to transcribe the civil regulations which employed the leisure of Constantine. But the most important of his institutions are intimately connected with the new system of policy and religion, which was not perfectly established till the last and peace∣ful years of his reign. There are many of his laws, which, as far as they concern the rights and property of individuals, and the practice of the bar, are more properly referred to the private than to the public jurisprudence of the empire; and he published many edicts of so local and temporary a nature, that they would ill deserve the notice of a general history. Two laws, how∣ever, may be selected from the crowd; the one, for its importance, the other, for its singularity; the former for its remarkable benevolence, the latter for its excessive severity. 1. The horrid practice, so familiar to the ancients, of exposing or murdering their new-born infants, was be∣come
<PB N="251" REF="266"/>
every day more frequent in the provinces, and especially in Italy. It was the effect of dis∣tress; and the distress was principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes, and by the vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their insolent debtors. The less opulent or less industrious part of mankind, instead of rejoicing in an in∣crease of family, deemed it an act of paternal tenderness to release their children from the im∣pending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to support. The humanity of Con∣stantine, moved, perhaps, by some recent and extraordinary instances of despair, engaged him to address an edict to all the cities of Italy, and afterwards of Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to those parents who should produce, before the magistrates, the chil∣dren whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate. But the promise was too li∣beral, and the provision too vague, to effect any general or permanent benefit <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot">Codex Theodosian. l. xi. tit. 27. tom. iv. p. 188. with Go∣defry's observations. See likewise, l. v. tit. 7—8.</NOTE>. The law, though it may merit some praise, served rather to dis∣play than to alleviate the public distress. It still remains an authentic monument to contradict and confound those venal orators, who were too well satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or misery under the government of a generous sovereign <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">Omnia foris placita, domi prospera, annonae ubertate, fructuum copiâ, &amp;c.

<PB N="252" REF="267"/>
against rapes were dictated with very little indulgence, for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature; since the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal violence which compelled, but even to the gentle seduc∣tion which might persuade, an unmarried wo∣man, under the age of twenty-five, to leave the house of her parents. <Q>The successful ravisher was punished with death; and as if simple death was inadequate to the enormity of his guilt, he was either burnt alive, or torn in pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatre. The virgin's declaration that she had been car∣ried away with her own consent, instead of saving her lover, exposed her to share his fate. The duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the parents of the guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the sentiments of Nature pre∣vailed on them to dissemble the injury, and to repair by a subsequent marriage the honour of their family, they were themselves punished by exile and confiscation. The slaves, whe∣ther male or female, who were convicted of having been accessary to the rape or seduction, were burnt alive, or put to death by the in∣genious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity of melted lead. As the crime was of a public kind, the accusation was permitted even to strangers. The commencement of the action was not limited to any term of years, and the consequences of the sentence
<PB N="253" REF="268"/>
were extended to the innocent offspring of such an irregular union <NOTE N="95" PLACE="foot">See the edict of Constantine, addressed to the Roman people, in the Theodosian Code, l. ix. tit. 24. tom. iii. p. 189.</NOTE>.</Q> But whenever the offence inspires less horror than the punish∣ment, the rigour of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of mankind.

Theod. tom. iii. p. 193.</NOTE>; and even Constantine himself very frequently alleviated, by partial acts of mercy, the stern temper of his general institutions. Such, indeed, was the sin∣gular humour of that emperor, who shewed him∣self as indulgent, and even remiss, in the execu∣tion of his laws, as he was severe, and even cruel, in the enacting of them. It is scarcely possible to observe a more decisive symptom of weakness, either in the character of the prince, or in the constitution of the government <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">Eusebius (in Vitâ Constant. l. iii. c. 1.) chooses to affirm, that in the reign of his hero, the sword of justice hung idle in the hands of the magistrates.

<P>The civil administration was sometimes inter∣rupted <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣thic war.</NOTE> by the military defence of the empire.

The Goths, who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian had felt the weight of the Roman arms, respected the power of the empire, even in the midst of its intestine divisions. But the strength of that warlike nation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years; a new generation had arisen, who no longer remembered the misfor∣tunes of ancient days: the Sarmatians of the lake Moeotis followed the Gothic standard either as subjects or as allies, and their united force was poured upon the countries of Illyricum. Cam∣pona, Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of several memorable sieges and battles <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">See Zosimus, l. ii. p. 93, 94; though the narrative of that historian is neither clear nor consistent. The Panegyric of Opta∣tianus (c. 23.) mentions the alliance of the Sarmatians with the Carpi and Getae, and points out the several fields of battle. It is supposed, that the Sarmatian games, celebrated in the month of No∣vember, derived their origin from the success of this war.</NOTE>; and though Constantine encountered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed at length in the contest, and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious retreat, by restoring the booty and prisoners which they had taken. Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indig∣nation of the emperor. He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barbarians who
<PB N="255" REF="270"/>
had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head of his legions he passed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which had been con∣structed by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest recesses of Dacia <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot">In the Caesars of Julian (p. 329.

But the old emperor, awakened by the approaching danger, deceived the expectations of his friends as well as of his enemies. Calling forth that spirit and those abi∣lities by which he had deserved the friendship of Galerius and the Imperial purple, he prepared himself for the contest, collected the forces of the East, and soon filled the plains of Hadri∣anople with his troops, and the Streights of the Hellespont with his fleet. The army consisted of one hundred and fifty thousand foot, and fifteen thousand horse; and as the cavalry was drawn, for the most part, from Phrygia and Cappadocia, we may conceive a more favourable opinion of the beauty of the horses, than of the courage and dexterity of their riders. The fleet was composed of three hundred and fifty gallies of three ranks of oars. An hundred and thirty of these were furnished by Egypt, and the adja∣cent coast of Africa. An hundred and ten sailed from the ports of Phoenicia and the isle of Cy∣prus; and the maritime countries of Bithynia, Ionia, and Caria, were likewise obliged to pro∣vide an hundred and ten gallies. The troops of Constantine were ordered to rendezvous at Thes∣salonica; they amounted to above an hundred
<PB N="257" REF="272"/>
and twenty thousand horse and foot <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 94, 95.</NOTE>. Their emperor was satisfied with their martial appear∣ance, and his army contained more soldiers, though fewer men, than that of his eastern com∣petitor. The legions of Constantine were levied in the warlike provinces of Europe; action had confirmed their discipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and there were among them a great number of veterans, who, after seventeen glorious campaigns under the same leader, prepared them∣selves to deserve an honourable dismission by a last effort of their valour <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Constantine was very attentive to the privileges and comforts of his fellow-veterans (Conveterani), as he now began to style them. See the Theodosian Code, l. vii. tit. 20. tom. ii. p. 419. 429.</NOTE>. But the naval pre∣parations of Constantine were in every respect much inferior to those of Licinius. The mari∣time cities of Greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the celebrated harbour of Piraeus, and their united forces consisted of no more than two hundred small vessels: a very feeble armament, if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped and main∣tained by the republic of Athens during the Pe∣loponnesian war <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Whilst the Athenians maintained the empire of the sea, their fleet consisted of three, and afterwards of four, hundred gallies of three ranks of oars, all completely equipped and ready for immediate service. The arsenal in the port of Piraeus had cost the republic a thousand talents, about two hundred and sixteen thousand pounds. See Thucydides de Bel. Peloponn. l. ii. c. 13. and Meursius de Fortuna Attica, c. 19.</NOTE>. Since Italy was no longer
<PB N="258" REF="273"/>
the seat of government, the naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually neglected; and as the shipping and mariners of the empire were supported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that they should the most abound in the industrious provinces of Egypt and Asia. It is only surprising that the eastern emperor, who possessed so great a supe∣riority at sea, should have neglected the oppor∣tunity of carrying an offensive war into the centre of his rival's dominions.</P>
<P>Instead of embracing such an active resolution, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Hadriano∣ple. A. D. 323. July 3.</NOTE> which might have changed the whole face of the war, the prudent Licinius expected the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he had fortified with an anxious care that be∣trayed his apprehension of the event. Constan∣tine directed his march from Thessalonica to∣wards that part of Thrace, till he found himself stopped by the broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus, and discovered the numerous army of Licinius, which filled the steep ascent of the hill, from the river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were spent in doubtful and distant skir∣mishes; but at length the obstacles of the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of Constantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of Constantine, which, though it can scarcely be paralleled either in po∣etry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an histo∣rian, the partial enemy of his fame. We are
<PB N="259" REF="274"/>
assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the river Hebrus, accompanied only by <HI>twelve</HI> horsemen, and that by the effort or terror of his invincible arm, he broke, slaughtered, and put to slight a host of an hundred and fifty thou∣sand men. The credulity of Zosimus prevailed so strongly over his passion, that among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he seems to have selected and embellished, not the most important, but the most marvellous. The valour and danger of Constantine are attested by a slight wound which he received in the thigh, but it may be discovered even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text, that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of five thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy, whose attention was diverted by the con∣struction of a bridge, and that Licinius, per∣plexed by so many artful evolutions, was reluc∣tantly drawn from his advantageous post to com∣bat on equal ground in the plain. The contest was no longer equal. His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquished by the ex∣perienced veterans of the West. Thirty-four thousand men are reported to have been slain. The fortified camp of Licinius was taken by assault the evening of the battle; the greater part of the fugitives, who had retired to the moun∣tains, surrendered themselves the next day to the discretion of the conqueror; and his rival,
<PB N="260" REF="275"/>
who could no longer keep the field, confined himself within the walls of Byzantium <NOTE N="107" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 95, 96.

<P>The siege of Byzantium, which was immedi∣ately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Byzanti∣um, and naval vic∣tory of Crispus.</NOTE> undertaken by Constantine, was attended with great labour and uncertainty. In the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly considered as the key of Europe and Asia, had been repaired and strengthened; and as long as Licinius remained master of the sea, the gar∣rison was much less exposed to the danger of fa∣mine than the army of the besiegers. The naval commanders of Constantine were summoned to his camp, and received his positive orders to force the passage of the Hellespont, as the fleet of Licinius, instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy, continued inactive in those narrow streights where its superiority of numbers was of little use or advantage. Crispus, the em∣peror's eldest son, was intrusted with the execu∣tion of this daring enterprise, which he per∣formed with so much courage and success, that he deserved the esteem, and most probably ex∣cited the jealousy, of his father. The engage∣ment lasted two days, and in the evening of the first, the contending fleets, after a considerable and mutual loss, retired into their respective har∣bours

An hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed, five thousand men were slain, and Amandus, the admiral of the Asiatic fleet, escaped with the utmost difficulty to the shores of Chalcedon. As soon as the Hellespont was open, a plentiful convoy of provisions flowed into the camp of Constantine, who had already advanced the operations of the siege. He constructed ar∣tificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium. The lofty towers which were erected on that foundation, galled the besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines, and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places. If Licinius persisted much longer in the defence, he exposed himself to be involved in the ruin, of the place. Before he was surrounded he prudently removed his person and treasures to Chalcedon in Asia; and as he was always desirous of associating com∣panions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune, he now bestowed the title of Caesar on Martini∣anus,

The vigilant emperor did not how∣ever neglect the last struggles of his antagonist. A considerable part of his victorious army was transported over the Bosphorus in small vessels, and the decisive engagement was sought soon after their landing on the heights of Chrysopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari. The troops of Licinius, though they were lately raised, ill armed, and worse disciplined, made head against their conquerors with fruitless but desperate va∣lour, till a total defeat and the slaughter of five and twenty thousand men irretrievably deter∣mined the fate of their leader <NOTE N="110" PLACE="foot">Eusebius (in Vitâ Constantin. l. ii. c. 16, 17.) ascribes this decisive victory to the pious prayers of the emperor.

promise, confirmed by an oath, that after the sacrifice of Martinianus, and the resignation of the purple, Licinius himself should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in peace and affluence. The behaviour of Constantia, and her relation to the contending parties, naturally recals the remembrance of that virtuous matron who was the sister of Augustus, and the wife of Antony. But the temper of mankind was al∣tered, and it was no longer esteemed infamous for a Roman to survive his honour and inde∣pendence. Licinius solicited and accepted the pardon of his offences, laid himself and his pur∣ple at the feet of his <HI>lord</HI> and <HI>master,</HI> was raised from the ground with insulting pity, was ad∣mitted the same day to the Imperial banquet, and soon afterwards was sent away to Thessalo∣nica, which had been chosen for the place of his confinement <NOTE N="111" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 102. Victor Junior in Epitome. Anonym. Valesian. p. 714.</NOTE>. His confinement was soon ter∣minated by death, and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the soldiers, or a decree of the senate, was suggested as a motive for his execution. According to the rules of tyranny, he was accused of forming a conspiracy, and of holding a trea∣sonable correspondence with the barbarians; but as he was never convicted, either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence, we may per∣haps be allowed, from his weakness, to presume his innocence <NOTE N="112" PLACE="foot">Contra religionem sacramenti Thessalonicae privatus occisus est.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>The Progress of the Christian Religion, and the Sen∣timents, Manners, Numbers, and Condition, of the primitive Christians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A CANDID but rational inquiry into the pro∣gress and establishment of Christianity, may be considered as a very essential part of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Import∣ance of the inquiry.</NOTE> history of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by open violence, or under∣mined by slow decay, a pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up in silence and obscurity, derived new vigour from opposition, and finally erected the triumphant banner of the cross on the ruins of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Christi∣anity confined to the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a revolution of thir∣teen or fourteen centuries, that religion is still professed by the nations of Europe, the most dis∣tinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By the industry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by the means of their colonies has been firmly established from Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.</P>
<P>But this inquiry, however useful or entertain∣ing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its difficul∣ties.</NOTE> is attended with two peculiar difficulties. The scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiasti∣cal
<PB N="266" REF="281"/>
history seldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church. The great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the gospel; and, to a careless observer, <HI>their</HI> faults may seem to cast a shade on the faith which they professed. But the scandal of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph of the Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only <HI>by whom,</HI> but likewise <HI>to whom,</HI> the Divine Revelation was given. The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of de∣scribing Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native purity. A more melan∣choly duty is imposed on the historian. He must discover the inevitable mixture of error and cor∣ruption, which she contracted in a long resi∣dence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.</P>
<P>Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire <NOTE PLACE="marg">Five causes of the growth of Christiani∣ty.</NOTE> by what means the Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the established religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious but satisfactory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling providence of its great Author. But as truth and reason seldom find so favourable a reception in the world, and as the wisdom of Providence frequently condescends to use the passions of the human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as instruments to execute its purpose; we may still be permitted,
<PB N="267" REF="282"/>
though with becoming submission, to ask, not indeed what were the first, but what were the se∣condary causes of the rapid growth of the Christian church. It will, perhaps, appear, that it was most effectually favoured and assisted by the five following causes: I. The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and un∣social spirit, which, instead of inviting, had de∣terred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. II. The doctrine of a future life, im∣proved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. III. The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church. IV. The pure and austere morals of the Christians. V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which gra∣dually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire.</P>
<P N="1">I. We have already described the religious <NOTE PLACE="marg">THE FIRST CAUSE. Zeal of the Jews.</NOTE> harmony of the ancient world, and the facility with which the most different and even hostile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other's superstitions.

Their attachment to the law of Moses was equal to their detestation of foreign religions.

<P>This inflexible perseverance, which appeared <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its gradual increase.</NOTE> so odious or so ridiculous to the ancient world, assumes a more awful character, since Providence has deigned to reveal to us the mysterious history
<PB N="270" REF="285"/>
of the chosen people. But the devout and even scrupulous attachment to the Mosaic religion, so conspicuous among the Jews who lived under the second temple, becomes still more surprising, if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their forefathers. When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai; when the tides of the ocean, and the course of the planets were suspended for the convenience of the Israelites; and when temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences of their piety or disobedience, they perpetually relapsed into rebellion against the visible majesty of their Di∣vine King, placed the idols of the nations in the sanctuary of Jehovah, and imitated every fan∣tastic ceremony that was practised in the tents of the Arabs, or in the cities of Phoenicia <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">For the enumeration of the Syrian and Arabian deities, it may be observed, that Milton has comprised in one hundred and thirty very beautiful lines, the two large and learned syntagmas, which Selden had composed on that abstruse subject.</NOTE>. As the protection of Heaven was deservedly with∣drawn from the ungrateful race, their faith ac∣quired a proportionable degree of vigour and purity. The contemporaries of Moses and Joshua had beheld with careless indifference the most amazing miracles. Under the pressure of every calamity, the belief of those miracles has pre∣served the Jews of a later period from the uni∣versal contagion of idolatry; and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind, that singular people seems to have yielded a stronger and more ready assent to the traditions

It would be easy, but it would be unbecoming, to justify the complaint of the Deity from the whole tenor of the Mosaic history.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reli∣gion better suited to defence than to conquest.</NOTE> defence, but it was never designed for conquest; and it seems probable that the number of pro∣selytes was never much superior to that of apos∣tates. The divine promises were originally made, and the distinguishing rite of circumcision was enjoined to a single family. When the posterity of Abraham had multiplied like the sands of the sea, the Deity, from whose mouth they received a system of laws and ceremonies, declared him∣self the proper and as it were the national God of Israel; and with the most jealous care sepa∣rated his favourite people from the rest of man∣kind. The conquest of the land of Canaan was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances, that the victo∣rious Jews were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility with all their neighbours. They had been commanded to extirpate some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the Di∣vine will had seldom been retarded by the weak∣ness of humanity. With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or al∣liances, and the prohibition of receiving them into the congregation, which in some cases was perpetual, almost always extended to the third,
<PB N="272" REF="287"/>
to the seventh, or even to the tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the faith of Moses, had never been inculcated as a precept of the law, nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a voluntary duty. In the admission of new citizens, that unsocial people was actuated by the selfish vanity of the Greeks, rather than by the generous policy of Rome. The descendants of Abraham were flat∣tered by the opinion, that they alone were the heirs of the covenant, and they were apprehen∣sive of diminishing the value of their inherit∣ance, by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the earth. A larger acquaintance with man∣kind, extended their knowledge without correct∣ing their prejudices; and whenever the God of Israel acquired any new votaries, he was much more indebted to the inconstant humour of po∣lytheism than to the active zeal of his own mis∣sionaries <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">All that relates to the Jewish proselytes has been very ably treated by Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 6, 7.</NOTE>. The religion of Moses seems to be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single nation; and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order, that every male, three times in the year, should present himself before the Lord Jehovah, it would have been impossible that the Jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the promised land <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">See Exod. xxiv. 23. Deut. xvi. 16. the commentators, and a very sensible note in the Universal History, vol. i. p. 603. edit. fol.</NOTE>. That obstacle was indeed removed by the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but the most con∣siderable
<PB N="273" REF="288"/>
part of the Jewish religion was involved in its destruction; and the pagans, who had long wondered at the strange report of an empty sanctuary <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot"><P>When Pompey, using or abusing the right of conquest, entered into the Holy of Holies, it was observed with amazement, <Q>Nullâ intus Deûm effigie, vacuam sedem et inania arcana.</Q> Tacit.

<P>Nil praeter nubes et coeli numen adorant.</P></NOTE>, were at a loss to discover what could be the object, or what could be the instruments, of a worship which was destitute of temples and of altars, of priests and of sacrifices. Yet even in their fallen state, the Jews, still asserting their lofty and exclusive privileges, shunned, instead of courting, the society of strangers. They still insisted with inflexible rigour on those parts of the law which it was in their power to practise. Their peculiar distinctions of days, of meats, and a variety of trivial though burdensome observ∣ances, were so many objects of disgust and aver∣sion for the other nations, to whose habits and prejudices they were diametrically opposite. The painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">A second kind of circumcision was inflicted on a Samaritan or Egyptian proselyte. The sullen indifference of the Talmudists, with respect to the conversion of strangers, may be seen in Basnage, His∣toire des Juifs, l. vi. c. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, Christianity offered <NOTE PLACE="marg">More libe∣ral zeal of Christiani∣ty.</NOTE> itself to the world, armed with the strength of the Mosaic law, and delivered from the weight of its fetters. An exclusive zeal for the truth of religion, and the unity of God, was as carefully
<PB N="274" REF="289"/>
inculcated in the new as in the ancient system: and whatever was now revealed to mankind con∣cerning the nature and designs of the Supreme Being, was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious doctrine. The divine authority of Moses and the prophets was admitted, and even established, as the firmest basis of Christi∣anity. From the beginning of the world, an uninterrupted series of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Messiah, who, in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the Jews, had been more fre∣quently represented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his expia∣tory sacrifice, the imperfect sacrifices of the tem∣ple were at once consummated and abolished. The ceremonial law, which consisted only of types and figures, was succeeded by a pure and spiritual worship, equally adapted to all climates, as well as to every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood, was substituted a more harmless initiation of water. The promise of divine favour, instead of being partially confined to the posterity of Abraham, was universally pro∣posed to the freeman and the slave, to the Greek and to the barbarian, to the Jew and to the Gen∣tile. Every privilege that could raise the pro∣selyte from earth to Heaven, that could exalt his devotion, secure his happiness, or even gratify that secret pride, which, under the semblance of devotion, insinuates itself into the human heart,
<PB N="275" REF="290"/>
was still reserved for the members of the Christian church; but at the same time all mankind was permitted, and even solicited, to accept the glo∣rious distinction, which was not only proffered as a favour, but imposed as an obligation. It be∣came the most sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and relations the inesti∣mable blessing which he had received, and to warn them against a refusal that would be se∣verely punished as a criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but all-powerful deity.</P>
<P>The enfranchisement of the church from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Obstinacy and reasons of the be∣lieving Jews.</NOTE> bonds of the synagogue, was a work however of some time and of some difficulty. The Jewish converts, who acknowledged Jesus in the cha∣racter of the Messiah foretold by their ancient oracles, respected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they obstinately adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors, and were desirous of imposing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the number of believers. These Judaising Christians seem to have argued with some degree of plausibility from the divine origin of the Mosaic law, and from the immu∣table perfections of its great Author. They af∣firmed, <HI>that</HI> if the Being, who is the same through all eternity, had designed to abolish those sacred rites which had served to distinguish his chosen people, the repeal of them would have been no less clear and solemn than their first promulga∣tion: <HI>that,</HI> instead of those frequent declarations, which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of
<PB N="276" REF="291"/>
the Mosaic religion, it would have been repre∣sented as a provisionary scheme intended to last only till the coming of the Messiah, who should instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">These arguments were urged with great ingenuity by the Jew Orobio, and refuted with equal ingenuity and candour by the Christian Limborch. See the Amica Collatio (it well deserves that name), or account of the dispute between them.</NOTE>: <HI>that</HI> the Messiah himself, and his disciples who conversed with him on earth, instead of authorizing by their example the most minute observances of the Mosaic law <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Jesus—circumcisus erat; cibis utebatur Judaicis; vestitû simili; purgatos scabie mittebat ad sacerdotes; Paschata et alios dies festos religiosé observabat: Si quos sanavit sabatho, ostendit non tantum ex lege, sed et exceptis sententiis talia opera sabatho non in∣terdicta. Grotius de veritate Religionis Christianae, l. v. c. 7. A little afterwards (c. 12.), he expatiates on the condescension of the apostles.</NOTE>, would have published to the world the abolition of those useless and obsolete ceremonies, without suffering Christianity to remain during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the Jewish church. Arguments like these ap∣pear to have been used in the defence of the ex∣piring cause of the Mosaic law; but the industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the ambiguous language of the Old Testament, and the ambiguous conduct of the apostolic teachers. It was proper gradually to unfold the system of the Gospel, and to pronounce, with the utmost caution and tenderness, a sentence of condemnation so repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing Jews.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="292"/>
The history of the church of Jerusalem affords a lively proof of the necessity of those precau∣tions, and of the deep impression which the Jew∣ish <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Na∣zarene church of Jerusalem.</NOTE> religion had made on the minds of its sec∣taries. The first fifteen bishops of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews; and the congregation over which they presided, united the law of Moses with the doctrine of Christ <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Paene omnes Christum Deum sub legis observatione credebant. Sulpicius Severus, ii. 31. See Eusebius, Hist. Ecclesiast. l. iv. c. 5.</NOTE>. It was natural that the primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days after the death of Christ, and was governed almost as many years under the immediate inspection of his apostle, should be received as the standard of orthodoxy <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Mosheim de Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum Magnum, p. 153. In this masterly performance, which I shall often have oc∣casion to quote, he enters much more fully into the state of the pri∣mitive church, than he has an opportunity of doing in his General History.</NOTE>. The distant churches very frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent, and relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms. But when numerous and opulent societies were established in the great cities of the empire, in Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome, the reverence which Jerusalem had in∣spired to all the Christian colonies insensibly di∣minished. The Jewish converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who had laid the foundations of the church, soon found themselves overwhelmed by the increasing mul∣titudes, that from all the various religions of polytheism inlisted under the banner of Christ:
<PB N="278" REF="293"/>
and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their peculiar apostle, had rejected the intolerable weight of Mosaic ceremonies, at length refused to their more scrupulous brethren the same tole∣ration which at first they had humbly solicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple, of the city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was severely felt by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith, they main∣tained so intimate a connexion with their impious countrymen, whose misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to the contempt, and more justly ascribed by the Christians to the wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins of Jerusalem to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan, where that ancient church languished above sixty years in solitude and ob∣scurity <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. iii. c. 5. Le Clerc, Hist. Ecclesiast. p. 605. Dur∣ing this occasional absence, the bishop and church of Pella still re∣tained the title of Jerusalem. In the same manner, the Roman pontiffs resided seventy years at Avignon; and the patriarchs of Alexandria have long since transferred their episcopal seat to Cairo.</NOTE>. They still enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout visits to the <HI>Holy City,</HI> and the hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But at length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fana∣ticism of the Jews filled up the measure of their calamities; and the Romans, exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the rights of vic∣tory with unusual rigour. The emperor found∣ed,
<PB N="279" REF="294"/>
under the name of Aelia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Dion Cassius, l. lxix. The exile of the Jewish nation from Jerusalem is attested by Aristo of Pella (apud Euseb. l. iv. c. 6.), and is mentioned by several ecclesiastical writers; though some of them too hastily extend this interdiction to the whole country of Pa∣lestine.</NOTE>, to which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the sever∣est penalties against any of the Jewish people who should dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders. The Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common pro∣scription, and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by the influence of temporal advantages. They elected Marcus for their bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles, and most probably a native either of Italy or of some of the Latin provinces. At his persuasion, the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the Mosaic law, in the practice of which they had persevered above a century. By this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices, they purchased a free admission into the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with the Catholic church <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. iv. c. 6.

<P>When the name and honours of the church of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ebio∣nites.</NOTE> Jerusalem had been restored to Mount Sion, the crimes of heresy and schism were imputed to the obscure remnant of the Nazarenes, which refused
<PB N="280" REF="295"/>
to accompany their Latin bishop. They still preserved their former habitation of Pella, spread themselves into the villages adjacent to Damas∣cus, and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of Boerea, or, as it is now called, of Alep∣po, in Syria <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Le Clerc. (Hist. Ecclesiast. p. 477. 535.) seems to have collected from Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and other writers, all the principal circumstances that relate to the Nazarenes or Ebionites. The nature of their opinions soon divided them into a stricter and a milder sect; and there is some reason to conjecture, that the family of Jesus Christ remained members, at least, of the latter and more moderate party.</NOTE>. The name of Nazarenes was deemed too honourable for those Christian Jews, and they soon received from the supposed poverty of their understanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous epithet of Ebio∣nites <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Some writers have been pleased to create an Ebion, the ima∣ginary author of their sect and name.

In a few years after the return of the church of Jerusalem, it became a matter of doubt and controversy, whether a man who sin∣cerely acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah, but who still continued to observe the law of Moses, could possibly hope for salvation. The humane temper of Justin Martyr inclined him to answer this question in the affirmative; and though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffi∣dence, he ventured to determine in favour of such an imperfect Christian, if he were content to practise the Mosaic ceremonies, without pre∣tending
<PB N="281" REF="296"/>
to assert their general use or necessity. But when Justin was pressed to declare the sen∣timent of the church, he confessed that there were very many among the orthodox Christians, who not only excluded their Judaising brethren from the hope of salvation, but who declined any intercourse with them in the common offices of friendship, hospitality, and social life <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">See the very curious Dialogue of Justin Martyr with the Jew Tryphon.

For this date consult the accurate note of Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. ii. p. 511.</NOTE>. The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was na∣tural to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of separation was fixed between the disciples of Moses and those of Christ. The unfortunate Ebionites, rejected from one religion as apostates, and from the other as heretics, found themselves compelled to assume a more decided character; and although some traces of that obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century, they insensibly melted away either into the church or the synagogue <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Of all the systems of Christianity, that of Abyssinia is the only one which still adheres to the Mosaic rites (Geddes's Church His∣tory of Aethiopia, and Dissertations de le Grand sur la Relation du P.

While the orthodox church preserved a just medium between excessive veneration and im∣proper contempt for the law of Moses, the vari∣ous <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gno∣stics.</NOTE> heretics deviated into equal but opposite extremes of error and extravagance. From the acknowledged truth of the Jewish religion, the Ebionites had concluded that it could never be abolished. From its supposed imperfections the Gnostics as hastily inferred that it never was in∣stituted by the wisdom of the Deity. There are some objections against the authority of Moses and the prophets, which too readily present them∣selves to the sceptical mind; though they can only be derived from our ignorance of remote antiquity, and from our incapacity to form an adequate judgment of the divine oeconomy.

The Mosaic account of the creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the Gnostics, who would not listen with patience to the repose of the Deity after six days labour, to the rib of Adam, the garden of Eden, the trees of life and of knowledge, the speaking serpent, the forbidden fruit, and the condemnation pronounced against human kind for the venal offence of their first progenitors <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Dr. Burnet (Archaeologia, l. ii. c. 7.) has discussed the first chapters of Genesis with too much wit and freedom.</NOTE>.

As the terms of communion were insensibly narrowed, and the spiritual authority of the prevailing party was exercised with in∣creasing severity, many of its most respectable adherents, who were called upon to renounce, were provoked to assert their private opinions, to pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles, and openly to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the church. The Gnostics were distinguished as the most polite, the most learned, and the most wealthy of the Christian name, and that general appellation which expressed a superiority of knowledge, was either assumed by their own pride, or ironically bestowed by the envy of their adversaries. They were almost without exception of the race of the Gentiles, and their principal founders seem to have been natives of Syria or Egypt, where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the body to indolent and contemplative de∣votion. The Gnostics blended with the faith of Christ many sublime but obscure tenets, which they derived from oriental philosophy, and even from the religion of Zoroaster, concerning the eternity of matter, the existence of two prin∣ciples, and the mysterious hierarchy of the in∣visible world <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">In the account of the Gnostics of the second and third cen∣turies, Mosheim is ingenious and candid; Le Clerc dull, but exact; Beausobre almost always an apologist; and it is much to be feared, that the primitive fathers are very frequently calumniators.</NOTE>.

It is therefore somewhat sin∣gular that Ignatius (Epist. ad Smyrn. Patr.

For the most part they arose in the second century, flourished during the third, and were suppressed in the fourth or fifth, by the prevalence of more fashionable controversies, and by the superior ascendant of the reigning power. Though they constantly disturbed the peace, and frequently disgraced the name, of religion, they contributed to assist rather than to retard the progress of Christianity. The Gentile converts, whose strong∣est objections and prejudices were directed against the law of Moses, could find admission into many Christian societies, which required not from their untutored mind any belief of an antecedent revelation.

apprehending that either the mockery, or the compliance, would expose him to the resentment of any invisible, or, as he conceived them, ima∣ginary powers. But the established religions of Paganism were seen by the primitive Christians in a much more odious and formidable light. It was the universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics, that the daemons were the au∣thors, the patrons, and the objects of idolatry <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">The unanimous sentiment of the primitive church is very clearly explained by Justin.

Those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from the rank of angels, and cast down into the infernal pit, were still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies, and to seduce the minds, of sinful men. The daemons soon dis∣covered and abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards devotion, and, artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from their Creator, they usurped the place and honours of the Supreme Deity. By the success of their malicious contrivances, they at once gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the only comfort of which they were yet susceptible, the hope of involving the human species in the par∣ticipation of their guilt and misery. It was con∣fessed, or at least it was imagined, that they had distributed among themselves the most import∣ant characters of polytheism, one daemon assum∣ing the name and attributes of Jupiter, an∣other of Aesculapius, a third of Venus, and a fourth perhaps of Apollo <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Tertullian (Apolog. c. 23.) alleges the confession of the Dae∣mons themselves as often as they were tormented by the Christian exorcists.</NOTE>; and that, by the

advantage of their long experience and aërial nature, they were enabled to execute, with suf∣ficient skill and dignity, the parts which they had undertaken. They lurked in the temples, instituted festivals and sacrifices, invented fables, pronounced oracles, and were frequently allowed to perform miracles. The Christians, who, by the interposition of evil spirits, could so readily explain every praeternatural appearance, were disposed and even desirous to admit the most ex∣travagant fictions of the Pagan mythology. But the belief of the Christian was accompanied with horror. The most trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the daemon, and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of God.</P>
<P>In consequence of this opinion, it was the first <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abhor∣rence of the Chris∣tians for idolatry.</NOTE> but arduous duty of a Christian to preserve him∣self pure and undefiled by the practice of ido∣latry. The religion of the nations was not merely a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples.

Some idea may
<PB N="293" REF="308"/>
be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians for such impious ceremonies, by the scrupulous delicacy which they displayed on a much less alarming occasion. On days of general festivity, it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown their heads with a garland of flowers. This innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution. But it most unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the house∣hold gods, that the laurel was sacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers, though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning, had been dedicated in their first origin to the service of superstition. The trembling Christians, who were persuaded in this instance to comply with the fashion of their country, and the commands of the magistrate, laboured under the most gloomy apprehensions, from the re∣proaches of their own conscience, the censures of the church, and the denunciations of divine vengeance <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Tertullian has composed a defence, or rather panegyric, of the rash action of a Christian soldier, who, by throwing away his crown of laurel, had exposed himself and his brethren to the most imminent danger.

The writings of Cicero <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">In particular, the first book of the Tusculan Questions, and the treatise De Senectute, and the Somnium Scipionis, contain, in the most beautiful language, every thing that Grecian philosophy, or Roman good sense, could possibly suggest on this dark but im∣portant object.</NOTE> represent in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SE∣COND CAUSE. The doc∣trine of the im∣mortality of the soul among the philoso∣phers;</NOTE> most lively colours the ignorance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient philosophers with regard to the immortality of the soul. When they are desirous of arming their disciples against the fear of death, they inculcate, as an obvious, though melancholy position, that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the calamities of life; and that those can no longer suffer who no longer exist. Yet there were a few sages of Greece and Rome who had conceived a more exalted, and, in some respects, a juster idea of human nature; though it must be con∣fessed, that, in the sublime inquiry, their reason had been often guided by their imagination, and that their imagination had been prompted by
<PB N="295" REF="310"/>
their vanity. When they viewed with compla∣cency the extent of their own mental powers, when they exercised the various faculties of me∣mory, of fancy, and of judgment, in the most profound speculations, or the most important la∣bours, and when they reflected on the desire of same, which transported them into future ages, far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave; they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts of the field, or to suppose, that a be∣ing, for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a spot of earth, and to a few years of duration. With this favourable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science, or rather the language, of Metaphysics. They soon discovered, that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a substance distinct from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual, incapable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher de∣gree of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison. From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who trod in the footsteps of Plato, deduced a very unjus∣tifiable conclusion, since they asserted, not only the future immortality, but the past eternity of the human soul, which they were too apt to con∣sider as a portion of the infinite and self-existing spirit, which pervades and sustains the universe <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">The pre-existence of human souls, so far at least as that doc∣trine is compatible with religion, was adopted by many of the Greek and Latin fathers.

A doctrine thus removed beyond the senses and the experience of mankind, might serve to amuse the leisure of a philosophic mind; or, in the silence of solitude, it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue; but the faint impression which had been received in the schools, was soon obliterated by the commerce and business of active life. We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent persons who flou∣rished in the age of Cicero, and of the first Cae∣sars, with their actions, their characters, and their motives, to be assured that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state. At the bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not apprehensive of giving offence to their hearers, by exposing that doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected with contempt by every man of a liberal education and understanding <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">See Cicero pro Cluent. c. 61.

<PB N="297" REF="312"/>
But we may perceive several defects inherent to the popular religions of Greece and Rome, which rendered them very unequal to so arduous a task. 1. The general system of their mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs; and the wisest among the Pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority. 2. The description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and of poets, who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters, who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little equity, that a solemn truth, the most congenial to the human heart, was oppressed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">The xith book of the Odyssey gives a very dreary and inco∣herent account of the infernal shades. Pindar and Virgil have em∣bellished the picture; but even those poets, though more correct than their great model, are guilty of very strange inconsistencies. See Bayle, Responses aux Questions d'un Provincial, part iii. c. 22.</NOTE>. 3. The doctrine of a future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith. The providence of the gods, as it related to public communities rather than to private in∣dividuals, was principally displayed on the visible theatre of the present world. The petitions which were offered on the altars of Jupiter or Apollo, expressed the anxiety of their worship∣pers for temporal happiness, and their ignorance or indifference concerning a future life <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">See the xvith epistle of the first book of Horace, the xiiith Sa∣tire of Juvenal, and the iid Satire of Persius: these popular discourses express the sentiment and language of the multitude.</NOTE>.

important truth of the immortality of the soul was inculcated with more diligence as well as success in India, in Assyria, in Egypt, and in Gaul; and since we cannot attribute such a dif∣ference <NOTE PLACE="marg">among the barbari∣ans;</NOTE> to the superior knowledge of the barba∣rians, we must ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood, which employed the mo∣tives of virtue as the instrument of ambition <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">If we confine ourselves to the Gauls, we may observe, that they intrusted, not only their lives, but even their money, to the security of another world.

The same custom is more darkly insinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2.

To the authority of scripture the Pharisees added that of tradition, and they ac∣cepted, under the name of traditions, several speculative tenets from the philosophy or religion of the eastern nations. The doctrines of fate or predestination, of angels and spirits, and of a future state of rewards and punishments, were in the number of these new articles of belief; and as the Pharisees, by the austerity of their manners, had drawn into their party the body of the Jewish people, the immortality of the soul became the prevailing sentiment of the syna∣gogue,

under the reign of the Asmonaean princes and pontiffs. The temper of the Jews was in∣capable of contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of a Polytheist; and as soon as they admitted the idea of a future state, they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the nation. Their zeal, however, added no∣thing to its evidence, or even probability: and it was still necessary, that the doctrine of life and immortality, which had been dictated by na∣ture, approved by reason, and received by su∣perstition, should obtain the sanction of divine truth from the authority and example of Christ.</P>

The revolution of seven∣teen centuries has instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error was permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itself, and all the various race of man∣kind, should tremble at the appearance of their divine judge <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">This expectation was countenanced by the twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew, and by the first epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians.

These calculations were formed on the Septuagint, which was universally received during the six first centuries.

From what causes then is the Apocalypse at present so generally received by the Greek, the Roman, and the Protestant churches? The following ones may be assigned. 1. The Greeks were subdued by the authority of an im∣postor, who, in the sixth century, assumed the character of Dionysius the Areopagite. 2. A just apprehension, that the grammarians might become more important than the theologians, engaged the council of Trent to fix the seal of their infallibility on all the books of Scrip∣ture, contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the number of which the Apocalypse was fortunately included.

It might, however, afford some consolation to Roman vanity, that the pe∣riod of their empire would be that of the world itself; which, as it had once perished by the element of water, was destined to experience a second and speedy destruction from the element of fire. In the opinion of a general conflagra∣tion, the faith of the Christian very happily coin∣cided with the tradition of the East, the philo∣sophy of the Stoics, and the analogy of Nature; and even the country, which, from religious motives, had been chosen for the origin and principal scene of the conflagration, was the best adapted for that purpose by natural and physical causes; by its deep caverns, beds of sulphur, and numerous volcanoes, of which those of Aetna, of Vesuvius, and of Lipari, exhibit a very im∣perfect representation.

their devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer, of fasting, and of vigils, to receive the extraordinary impulse, they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in extasy what was inspired, being mere organs of the holy spirit, just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Athenagoras in Legatione.

We may add, that the de∣sign of these visions was, for the most part, either to disclose the future history, or to guide the present administration of the church. The ex∣pulsion of the daemons from the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted to torment, was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of religion, and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apologists, as the most convincing evidence of the truth of Christianity. The awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner, and in the presence of a great number of spectators; the patient was relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist, and the van∣quished daemon was heard to confess, that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiously usurped the adoration of mankind <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Tertullian (Apolog. c. 23.) throws out a bold defiance to the Pagan magistrates.

that in the days of Irenaeus, about the end of the second century, the resurrection of the dead was very far from being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle was frequently perform∣ed on necessary occasions, by great fasting and the joint supplication of the church of the place, and that the persons thus restored to their pray∣ers, had lived afterwards among them many years <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">Irenaeus adv.

At such a period, when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories over death, it seems difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers, who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection. A noble Gre∣cian had rested on this important ground the whole controversy, and promised Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, that if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had been actually raised from the dead, he would imme∣diately embrace the Christian religion.

than that of the preceding generation, till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own inconsistency, if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable Bede, or to the holy Ber∣nard, the same degree of confidence which, in the second century, we had so liberally granted to Justin or to Irenaeus <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">It may seem somewhat remarkable, that Bernard of Clairvaux, who records so many miracles of his friend St. Malachi, never takes any notice of his own, which, in their turn, however, are carefully related by his companions and disciples. In the long series of ec∣clesiastical history, does there exist a single instance of a saint assert∣ing that he himself possessed the gift of miracles?</NOTE>. If the truth of any of those miracles is appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous nations to convert; and sufficient motives might always be produced to justify the interposition of Heaven. And yet since every friend to revela∣tion is persuaded of the reality, and every reason∣able man is convinced of the cessation, of mira∣culous powers, it is evident that there must have been <HI>some period</HI> in which they were either sud∣denly or gradually withdrawn from the Christian church. Whatever aera is chosen for that pur∣pose, the death of the apostles, the conversion of the Roman empire, or the extinction of the Ari∣an heresy <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">The conversion of Constantine is the aera which is most usu∣ally fixed by protestants. The more rational divines are unwilling to admit the miracles of the ivth, whilst the more credulous are un∣willing to reject those of the vth century.</NOTE>, the insensibility of the Christians who lived at that time will equally afford a just matter of surprise.

Credulity performed the office of faith; fana∣ticism was permitted to assume the language of inspiration, and the effects of accident or con∣trivance were ascribed to supernatural causes. The recent experience of genuine miracles should have instructed the Christian world in the ways of Providence, and habituated their eye (if we may use a very inadequate expression) to the style of the divine artist. Should the most skil∣ful painter of modern Italy presume to decorate his feeble imitations with the name of Raphael or of Correggio, the insolent fraud would be soon discovered and indignantly rejected.</P>
<P>Whatever opinion may be entertained of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Use of the primitive miracles.</NOTE> miracles of the primitive church since the time of the apostles, this unresisting softness of tem∣per, so conspicuous among the believers of the second and third centuries, proved of some acci∣dental benefit to the cause of truth and religion. In modern times, a latent and even involuntary scepticism adheres to the most pious dispositions. Their admission of supernatural truths is much less an active consent, than a cold and passive acquiescence. Accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of Nature, our reason, or at least our imagination, is not sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the Deity. But, in the first ages of Christi∣anity, the situation of mankind was extremely different. The most curious, or the most cre∣dulous, among the Pagans, were often persuad∣ed to enter into a society, which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The primitive
<PB N="315" REF="330"/>
Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraordinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every side they were incessantly assaulted by daemons, comforted by visions, instructed by prophecy, and surpri∣singly delivered from danger, sickness, and from death itself, by the supplications of the church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so frequently conceived themselves to be the ob∣jects, the instruments, or the spectators, very happily disposed them to adopt with the same ease, but with far greater justice, the authentic wonders of the evangelic history; and thus mira∣cles that exceeded not the measure of their own experience, inspired them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding. It is this deep impression of supernatural truths, which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith; a state of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favour and of future felicity, and recommended as the first or per∣haps the only merit of a Christian. According to the more rigid doctors, the moral virtues, which may be equally practised by infidels, are destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our justification.</P>

The first apologists of Christianity who justify the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors, display, in the most lively colours, the reformation of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel. As it is my intention to remark only such human causes as were permitted to second the influence of reve∣lation, I shall slightly mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive Christians much purer and more austere than those of their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate successors; repentance for their past sins, and the laudable desire of supporting the reputation of the society in which they were engaged.</P>
<P>It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of their re∣pentance.</NOTE> ignorance or the malice of infidelity, that the Christians allured into their party the most atro∣cious criminals, who, as soon as they were touch∣ed by a sense of remorse, were easily persuaded to wash away, in the water of baptism, the guilt of their past conduct, for which the temples of the gods refused to grant them any expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared from mis∣representation, contributes as much to the ho∣nour as it did to the increase of the church <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">The imputations of Celsus and Julian, with the defence of the fathers, are very fairly stated by Spanheim, Commentaire sur les Cesars de Julian, p. 468.</NOTE>. The friends of Christianity may acknowledge without a blush, that many of the most eminent

saints had been before their baptism the most abandoned sinners. Those persons, who in the world had followed, though in an imperfect man∣ner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived such a calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude, as rendered them much less susceptible of the sudden emotions of shame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to so many wonderful conversions. After the example of their Divine Master, the missionaries of the gospel disdained not the society of men, and especially of women, oppressed by the con∣sciousness, and very often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerged from sin and supersti∣tion to the glorious hope of immortality, they resolved to devote themselves to a life, not only of virtue, but of penitence. The desire of per∣fection became the ruling passion of their soul; and it is well known, that while reason embraces a cold medicrity, our passions hurry us, with rapid violence, over the space which lies between the most opposite extremes.</P>
<P>When the new converts had been enrolled in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Care of their repu∣tation.</NOTE> the number of the faithful, and were admitted to the sacraments of the church, they found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual, but of a very innocent and respectable nature.

In proportion to the smallness of its num∣bers, the character of the society may be affect∣ed by the virtue and vices of the persons who compose it; and every member is engaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over his own behaviour, and over that of his brethren, since, as he must expect to incur a part of the common disgrace, he may hope to enjoy a share of the common reputation. When the Christians of Bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny, they assured the proconsul, that, far from being engaged in any unlawful conspiracy, they were bound by a solemn obli∣gation to abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the private or public peace of society, from theft, robbery, adultery, per∣jury, and fraud <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Plin.

<P>It is a very honourable circumstance for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Morality of the fa∣thers.</NOTE> morals of the primitive Christians, that even their faults, or rather errors, were derived from an excess of virtue.

Ambitious to exalt the perfection of the gospel above the wisdom of philosophy, the zealous fa∣thers have carried the duties of self-mortification, of purity, and of patience, to a height which it is scarcely possible to attain, and much less to preserve, in our present state of weakness and corruption.

<P>There are two very natural propensities which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Principles of human nature.</NOTE> we may distinguish in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions, the love of pleasure and the love of action. If the former is refined by art and learning, improved by the charms of social intercourse, and corrected by a just regard to oeconomy, to health, and to reputation, it is productive of the greatest part of the happiness of private life. The love of action is a principle of a much stronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger, to ambition, and to re∣venge; but when it is guided by the sense of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every virtue; and if those virtues are accom∣panied with equal abilities, a family, a state, or an empire, may be indebted for their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single man. To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute most of the useful and respectable, qualifications. The character in which both the one and the other should be united and harmonised, would seem to consti∣tute the most perfect idea of human nature. The insensible and inactive disposition, which should be supposed alike destitute of both, would be rejected, by the common consent of mankind, as utterly incapable of procuring any happiness

In our present state of existence, the body is so inseparably connected with the soul, that it seems to be our interest to taste, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of which that faithful companion is susceptible.

Gay apparel, magnificent houses, and ele∣gant furniture, were supposed to unite the dou∣ble guilt of pride and of sensuality: a simple and mortified appearance was more suitable to the Christian who was certain of his sins and doubt∣ful of his salvation.

<P>The chaste severity of the fathers, in whatever <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their sen∣timents concerning marriage and chasti∣ty.</NOTE> related to the commerce of the two sexes, flow∣ed from the same principle; their abhorrence of every enjoyment, which might gratify the sen∣sual, and degrade the spiritual, nature of man.

The primitive Christians were dead to the busi∣ness and pleasures of the world; but their love of action, which could never be entirely extin∣guished, soon revived, and found a new occu∣pation in the government of the church. A separate society, which attacked the established religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt some form of internal policy, and to appoint a sufficient number of ministers, intrusted not only with the spiritual functions, but even with the temporal direction of the Christian common∣wealth. The safety of that society, its honour, its aggrandisement, were productive, even in the most pious minds, of a spirit of patriotism, such as the first of the Romans had felt for the repub∣lic, and sometimes, of a similar indifference, in the use of whatever means might probably con∣duce to so desirable an end. The ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honours and offices of the church, was disguised by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit, the power and consideration, which, for that purpose only, it became their duty to solicit. In the exercise of their functions, they were fre∣quently called upon to detect the errors of heresy, or the arts of faction, to oppose the designs of perfidious brethren, to stigmatize their charac∣ters
<PB N="329" REF="344"/>
with deserved infamy, and to expel them from the bosom of a society, whose peace and happiness they had attempted to disturb. The ecclesiastical governors of the Christians were taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; but as the former was refined, so the latter was insensibly corrupt∣ed, by the habits of government. In the church as well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any public station rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness, by their knowledge of mankind, and by their dex∣terity in business; and while they concealed from others, and perhaps from themselves, the secret motives of their conduct, they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent passions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional de∣gree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of spiritual zeal.</P>

that the apostles declined the office of legislation, and rather chose to endure some par∣tial scandals and divisions, than to exclude the Christians of a future age from the liberty of varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the changes of times and circum∣stances. The scheme of policy, which, under their approbation, was adopted for the use of the first century, may be discovered from the prac∣tice of Jerusalem, of Ephesus, or of Corinth. The societies which were instituted in the cities of the Roman empire, were united only by the ties of faith and charity. Independence and equality formed the basis of their internal con∣stitution. The want of discipline and human learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the <HI>prophets</HI> <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">For the prophets of the primitive church, see Mosheim, Dis∣sertationes ad Hist. Eccles. pertinentes, tom. ii. p. 132—208.</NOTE>, who were called to that func∣tion without distinction of age, of sex, or of natural abilities, and who, as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the effusions of the spirit in the assembly of the faithful. But these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by the prophetic teachers. They displayed them at an improper season, presump∣tuously disturbed the service of the assembly, and by their pride or mistaken zeal they introduced, particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long and melancholy train of disorders <NOTE N="107" PLACE="foot">See the epistles of St. Paul, and of Clemens, to the Corinthi∣ans.</NOTE>.

As the institution of prophets became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were with∣drawn, and their office abolished. The public functions of religion were solely intrusted to the established ministers of the church, the <HI>bishops</HI> and the <HI>presbyters;</HI> two appellations which, in their first origin, appear to have distinguished the same office and the same order of persons. The name of Presbyter was expressive of their age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom. The title of Bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the Christians who were committed to their pastoral care. In proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful, a larger or smaller number of these <HI>episcopal presbyters</HI> guided each infant congregation with equal au∣thority, and with united counsels <NOTE N="108" PLACE="foot">Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, l. vii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the most perfect equality of freedom re∣quires <NOTE PLACE="marg">Institution of bishops as presi∣dents of the college of presby∣ters.</NOTE> the directing hand of a superior magistrate; and the order of public deliberations soon intro∣duces the office of a president, invested at least with the authority of collecting the sentiments, and of executing the resolutions, of the assembly. A regard for the public tranquillity, which would so frequently have been interrupted by annual or by occasional elections, induced the primitive Christians to constitute an honourable and per∣petual magistracy, and to choose one of the wisest and most holy among their presbyters to execute, during his life, the duties of their ecclesiastical governor. It was under these circumstances that
<PB N="332" REF="347"/>
the lofty title of Bishop began to raise itself above the humble appellation of presbyter; and while the latter remained the most natural dis∣tinction for the members of every Christian senate, the former was appropriated to the dig∣nity of its new president <NOTE N="109" PLACE="foot">See Jerome ad Titum, c. 1. and Epistol. 85.

presbyters, who were first dignified with the epis∣copal title, could not possess, and would proba∣bly have rejected, the power and pomp which now encircles the tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre of a German prelate. But we may define, in a few words, the narrow limits of their original jurisdiction, which was chiefly of a spi∣ritual, though in some instances of a temporal, nature <NOTE N="113" PLACE="foot">See Mosheim in the first and second centuries. Ignatius (ad Smyrnaeos, c. 3, &amp;c.) is fond of exalting the episcopal dignity. Le Clerc (Hist. Eccles. p. 569.) very bluntly censures his conduct. Mosheim, with a more critical judgment (p. 161.), suspects the pu∣rity even of the smaller epistles.</NOTE>. It consisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church, the superintendency of religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly increased in number and variety, the consecration of ecclesiastical ministers, to whom the bishop assigned their respective func∣tions, the management of the public fund, and the determination of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose before the tri∣bunal of an idolatrous judge. These powers, during a short period, were exercised according to the advice of the presbyteral college, and with the consent and approbation of the assembly of Christians. The primitive bishops were con∣sidered only as the first of their equals, and the honourable servants of a free people. Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death, a new president was chosen among the presbyters by the suffrage of the whole congregation, every

<P>Such was the mild and equal constitution by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provincial councils.</NOTE> which the Christians were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apostles. Every society formed within itself a separate and independent republic: and although the most distant of these little states maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and depu∣tations, the Christian world was not yet connect∣ed by any supreme authority or legislative assem∣bly. As the numbers of the faithful were gra∣dually multiplied, they discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union of their interest and designs. Towards the end of the second century, the churches of Greece and Asia adopted the useful institutions of provincial sy∣nods, and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council from the celebrated examples of their own coun∣try, the Amphictyons, the Achaean league, or the assemblies of the Ionian cities. It was soon established as a custom and as a law, that the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and autumn. Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few distinguished presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a
<PB N="335" REF="350"/>
listening multitude <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot">Acta Concil. Carthag. apud Cyprian. Edit. Fell, p. 158. This council was composed of eighty-seven bishops from the pro∣vinces of Mauritania, Numidia, and Africa; some presbyters and deacons assisted at the assembly; praesente plebis maximâ parte.</NOTE>. Their decrees, which were styled Canons, regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline; and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the holy spirit would be poured on the united assem∣bly of the delegates of the Christian people. The institution of synods was so well suited to private ambition and to public interest, that in the space of a few years it was received through∣out the whole empire. A regular correspondence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Union of the church.</NOTE> was established between the provincial councils, which mutually communicated and approved their respective proceedings; and the catholic church soon assumed the form, and acquired the strength, of a great soederative republic <NOTE N="116" PLACE="foot">Aguntur praeterea per Graecias illas, certis in locis concilia, &amp;c.

<P>As the legislative authority of the particular <NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of episcopal authority.</NOTE> churches was insensibly superseded by the use of councils, the bishops obtained by their alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrary power; and as soon as they were connected by a sense of their common interest, they were ena∣bled to attack, with united vigour, the original rights of their clergy and people. The prelates of the third century imperceptibly changed the language of exhortation into that of command, scattered the seeds of future usurpations, and
<PB N="336" REF="351"/>
supplied, by scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason. They exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was represented in the EPISCOPAL OFFICE, of which every bishop enjoyed an equal and un∣divided portion <NOTE N="117" PLACE="foot">Cyprian, in his admired treatise De Unitate Ecclesiae, p. 75—86.</NOTE>. Princes and magistrates, it was often repeated, might boast an earthly claim to a transitory dominion: it was the episcopal authority alone which was derived from the deity, and extended itself over this and over another world. The bishops were the vicegerents of Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic substitutes of the high priest of the Mo∣saic law. Their exclusive privilege of confer∣ring the sacerdotal character, invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the administration of the church, they still consulted the judgment of the presbyters, or the inclination of the people, they most carefully in∣culcated the merit of such a voluntary conde∣scension. The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in the assembly of their brethren; but in the government of his peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his <HI>flock</HI> the same implicit obedience as if that favourite me∣taphor had been literally just, and as if the shep∣herd had been of a more exalted nature than that of his sheep <NOTE N="118" PLACE="foot">We may appeal to the whole tenor of Cyprian's conduct, of his doctrine, and of his Epistles.

was not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance on the other. The de∣mocratical part of the constitution was, in many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested opposition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotism received the ignominious epi∣thets of faction and schism; and the episcopal cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labours of many active prelates, who, like Cy∣prian of Carthage, could reconcile the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the Christian virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and martyr <NOTE N="119" PLACE="foot">If Novatus, Felicissimus, &amp;c. whom the bishop of Carthage expelled from his church, and from Africa, were not the most de∣testable monsters of wickedness, the zeal of Cyprian must occasion∣ally have prevailed over his veracity.

<P>The same causes which at first had destroyed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre-emi∣nence of the metro∣politan churches.</NOTE> the equality of the presbyters, introduced among the bishops a pre-eminence of rank, and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction. As often as in the spring and autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of personal merit and re∣putation was very sensibly felt among the mem∣bers of the assembly, and the multitude was go∣verned by the wisdom and eloquence of the few. But the order of public proceedings required a more regular and less invidious distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the councils of each province, was conferred on the bishops of the principal city, and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty titles of Metropo∣litans

Nor was it long before an emulation of pre-eminence and power prevailed among the metropolitans them∣selves, each of them affecting to display, in the most pompous terms, the temporal honours and advantages of the city over which he presided; the numbers and opulence of the Christians, who were subject to their pastoral care; the saints and martyrs who had arisen among them, and the purity with which they preserved the tradition of the faith, as it had been transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle or the apostolic disciple, to whom the foundation of their church was ascribed <NOTE N="121" PLACE="foot">Tertullian, in a distinct treatise, has pleaded against the he∣retics, the right of prescription, as it was held by the apostolic churches.</NOTE>.

Al∣most at the same period, the bishop of Carthage, from a society less opulent than that of Rome, collected an hundred thousand sesterces (above eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling), on a sudden call of charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried away captives by the barbarians of the desert <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Cyprian.

was the society of Christians either desirous or capable of acquiring, to any considerable degree, the incumbrance of landed property. It had been provided by several laws, which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of mortmain, that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to any corporate body, without either a special privilege or a particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate <NOTE N="137" PLACE="foot">Diocletian gave a rescript, which is only a declaration of the old law; "Collegium, si nullo speciali privilegio subnixum sit, haereditatem capere non posse, dubium non est."

<P>The bishop was the natural steward of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Distribu∣tion of the revenue.</NOTE> church; the public stock was intrusted to his

Apostol. ii. 35.</NOTE>. If we may give credit to the vehement declamations of Cyprian, there were too many among his African brethren, who, in the execution of their charge, violated every precept, not only of evangelic perfection, but even of moral virtue. By some of these un∣faithful stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual pleasures, by others they were perverted to the purposes of private gain, of fraudulent purchases, and of rapacious usury <NOTE N="140" PLACE="foot">Cyprian de Lapsis, p. 89.

But as long as the contributions of the Christian people were free and unconstrained, the abuse of their confidence could not be very frequent, and the general uses to which their liberality was applied, reflected honour on the religious society. A decent portion was reserved for the mainte∣nance of the bishop and his clergy; a sufficient sum was allotted for the expences of the public worship, of which the feasts of love, the <HI>agapae,</HI> as they were called, constituted a very pleasing part. The whole remainder was the sacred pa∣trimony of the poor. According to the discre∣tion of the bishop, it was distributed to support widows and orphans, the lame, the sick, and the aged of the community; to comfort strangers and pilgrims, and to alleviate the misfortunes of

II. It is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from its communion and benefits, such among its members as reject or violate those <NOTE PLACE="marg">Excom∣munica∣tion.</NOTE> regulations which have been established by ge∣neral consent. In the exercise of this power, the censures of the Christian church were chiefly directed against scandalous sinners, and particu∣larly those who were guilty of murder, of fraud, or of incontinence; against the authors, or the followers of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the episco∣pal order; and against those unhappy persons, who, whether from choice or from compulsion, had polluted themselves after their baptism by any act of idolatrous worship. The consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as a spiritual nature. The Christian against whom it was pronounced, was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful. The ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved: he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons whom he the most esteemed, or by whom he had been the most tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulsion from a respectable society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace, he was shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind. The situation of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy; but, as it usually happens, their apprehensions far exceeded their
<PB N="349" REF="364"/>
sufferings. The benefits of the Christian com∣munion were those of eternal life, nor could they erase from their minds the awful opinion, that to those ecclesiastical governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics, in∣deed, who might be supported by the conscious∣ness of their intentions, and by the flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of salvation, endeavoured to regain, in their separate assemblies, those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they no longer derived from the great society of Christians. But almost all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or idolatry, were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously desirous of being re∣stored to the benefits of the Christian commu∣nion.</P>
<P>With regard to the treatment of these penitents, two opposite opinions, the one of justice, the other of mercy, divided the primitive church. The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused them for ever, and without exception, the meanest place in the holy community, which they had disgraced or deserted, and leaving them to the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only with a faint ray of hope, that the contrition of their life and death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being <NOTE N="145" PLACE="foot">The Montanists and the Novatians, who adhered to this opi∣nion with the greatest rigour and obstinacy, found <HI>themselves</HI> at last in the number of excommunicated heretics.

sentiment was embraced in practice as well as in theory, by the purest and most respectable of the Christian churches <NOTE N="146" PLACE="foot">Dionysius ap. Euseb. iv. 23. Cyprian, de Lapsis.</NOTE>. The gates of reconcilia∣tion and of Heaven were seldom shut against the returning penitent; but a severe and solemn form of discipline was instituted, which, while it served to expiate his crime, might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation of his example. Humbled by a public confession, emaciated by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Public pe∣nance.</NOTE> fasting, and clothed in sackcloth, the penitent lay prostrate at the door of the assembly, im∣ploring with tears the pardon of his offences, and soliciting the prayers of the faithful <NOTE N="147" PLACE="foot">Cave's Primitive Christianity, part iii. c. 5. The admirers of antiquity regret the loss of this public penance.</NOTE>. If the fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the Divine Justice; and it was al∣ways by slow and painful gradations that the sinner, the heretic, or the apostate, was re-ad∣mitted into the bosom of the church. A sen∣tence of perpetual excommunication was, how∣ever, reserved for some crimes of an extraordi∣nary magnitude, and particularly for the inex∣cusable relapses of those penitents who had al∣ready experienced and abused the clemency of their ecclesiastical superiors. According to the circumstances or the number of the guilty, the exercise of the Christian discipline was varied by the discretion of the bishops. The councils of Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the same
<PB N="351" REF="366"/>
time, the one in Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons, which are still ex∣tant, seem to breathe a very different spirit. The Galatian, who after his baptism had repeat∣edly sacrificed to idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years, and if he had se∣duced others to imitate his example, only three years more were added to the term of his exile. But the unhappy Spaniard, who had committed the same offence, was deprived of the hope of reconciliation, even in the article of death; and his idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other crimes, against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced. Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of calum∣niating a bishop, a presbyter, or even a dea∣con <NOTE N="148" PLACE="foot">See in Dupin, Bibliothèque Ecclesiastique, tom. ii. p. 304—313, a short but rational exposition of the canons of those councils, which were assembled in the first moments of tranquillity, after the persecution of Diocletian. This persecution had been much less severely felt in Spain than in Galatia; a difference which may, in some measure, account for the contrast of their regulations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The well-tempered mixture of liberality and rigour, the judicious dispensation of rewards and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dig∣nity of episcopal govern∣ment.</NOTE> punishments, according to the maxims of policy as well as justice, constituted the <HI>human</HI> strength of the church. The bishops, whose paternal care extended itself to the government of both worlds, were sensible of the importance of these prerogatives, and covering their ambition with the fair pretence of the love of order, they were jealous of any rival in the exercise of a discipline

so necessary to prevent the desertion of those troops which had inlisted themselves under the banner of the cross, and whose numbers every day became more considerable. From the im∣perious declamations of Cyprian, we should na∣turally conclude, that the doctrines of excom∣munication and penance formed the most essen∣tial part of religion; and that it was much less dangerous for the disciples of Christ to neglect the observance of the moral duties, than to de∣spise the censures and authority of their bishops. Sometimes we might imagine that we were listen∣ing to the voice of Moses, when he commanded the earth to open, and to swallow up, in con∣suming flames, the rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of Aaron; and we should sometimes suppose that we heard a Roman consul asserting the majesty of the republic, and declaring his inflexible resolution to enforce the rigour of the laws. <Q>If such irregularities are suffered with impunity (it is thus that the bi∣shop of Carthage chides the lenity of his col∣league), if such irregularities are suffered, there is an end of EPISCOPAL VIGOUR <NOTE N="149" PLACE="foot">Cyprian.

despised by the world, is more truly grateful to the pride of the human heart, than the possession of the most despotic power, imposed by arms and conquest on a reluctant people.</P>
<P>In the course of this important, though per∣haps <NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitu∣lation of the five causes.</NOTE> tedious, inquiry, I have attempted to dis∣play the secondary causes which so efficaciously assisted the truth of the Christian religion. If among these causes we have discovered any ar∣tificial ornaments, any accidental circumstances, or any mixture of error and passion, it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their imperfect nature. It was by the aid of these causes, exclusive zeal, the immedi∣ate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of the primitive church, that Chris∣tianity spread itself with so much success in the Roman empire. To the first of these the Chris∣tians were indebted for their invincible valour, which disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to vanquish. The three succeeding causes supplied their valour with the most formidable arms. The last of these causes united their courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that irresistible weight, which even a small band of well-trained and intrepid volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined multitude, ignorant of the subject, and careless of the event of the war. In the various religions of Polytheism, some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakness of polythe∣ism.</NOTE>

The ministers of polytheism, both in Rome and in the provinces, were, for the most part, men of a noble birth, and of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honourable distinction, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a public sacrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expence, the sacred games <NOTE N="151" PLACE="foot">The office of Asiarch was of this nature, and it is frequently mentioned in Aristides, the Inscriptions, &amp;c.

There were likewise Bithyniarchs, Lyciarchs, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites, according to the laws and fashion of their country. As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life, their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of interest, or by the habits of an ecclesi∣astical character. Confined to their respective temples and cities, they remained without any connexion of discipline or government; and whilst they acknowledged the supreme jurisdic∣tion of the senate, of the college of pontiffs, and
<PB N="355" REF="370"/>
of the emperor, those civil magistrates contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining, in peace and dignity, the general worship of man∣kind. We have already seen how various, how loose, and how uncertain were the religious sen∣timents of Polytheists. They were abandoned, almost without controul, to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy. The accidental circum∣stances of their life and situation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand deities, it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them.</P>
<P>When Christianity appeared in the world, even <NOTE PLACE="marg">The scep∣ticism of the Pagan world proved fa∣vourable to the new religion,</NOTE> these faint and imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power. Human reason, which by its unassisted strength is incapable of perceiving the mysteries of faith, had already obtained an easy triumph over the folly of Pa∣ganism; and when Tertullian or Lactantius em∣ploy their labours in exposing its falsehood and extravagance, they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of Cicero or the wit of Lucian. The contagion of these sceptical writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their readers. The fashion of incredulity was communicated from the philosopher to the man of pleasure or business, from the noble to the plebeian, and from the master to the menial slave who waited at his table, and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his conversation. On public occa∣sions
<PB N="356" REF="371"/>
the philosophic part of mankind affected to treat with respect and decency the religious in∣stitutions of their country; but their secret con∣tempt penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise, and even the people, when they dis∣covered that their deities were rejected and de∣rided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehensions concerning the truth of those doctrines, to which they had yielded the most implicit belief. The decline of ancient prejudice exposed a very numerous portion of human kind to the danger of a painful and com∣fortless situation. A state of scepticism and sus∣pense may amuse a few inquisitive minds. But the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude, that if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of their pleasing vision. Their love of the marvellous and supernatural, their curiosity with regard to future events, and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which favoured the establish∣ment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar is the necessity of believing, that the fall of any system of mythology will most probably be suc∣ceeded by the introduction of some other mode of superstition. Some deities of a more recent and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation, fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction,
<PB N="357" REF="372"/>
whilst, at the same time, it was adorned with all that could attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the veneration of the people. In their actual disposition, as many were almost disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment; an object much less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of their passions. Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection, instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of Christianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not still more rapid and still more universal.</P>
<P>It has been observed, with truth as well as <NOTE PLACE="marg">as well as the peace and union of the Ro∣man em∣pire.</NOTE> propriety, that the conquests of Rome prepared and facilitated those of Christianity. In the second chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asia, and Africa, were united under the dominion of one sovereign, and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of language. The Jews of Palestine, who had fondly expected a temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the mi∣racles of the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to publish, or at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel <NOTE N="152" PLACE="foot">The modern critics are not disposed to believe what the fathers almost unanimously assert, that St. Matthew composed a Hebrew gospel, of which only the Greek translation is extant.

There is the strongest reason to believe, that before the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine, the faith of Christ had been preach∣ed in every province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the foundation of the several <NOTE PLACE="marg">Historical view of the pro∣gress of Christian∣ity</NOTE> congregations, the numbers of the faithful who composed them, and their proportion to the un∣believing multitude, are now buried in obscurity, or disguised by fiction and declamation.

<P>The rich provinces that extend from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">in the East.</NOTE> Euphrates to the Ionian sea, were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the Gentiles dis∣played his zeal and piety. The seeds of the gospel, which he had scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently cultivated by his disciples; and it should seem that, during the two first centuries, the most considerable body of Christians was contained within those limits. Among the so∣cieties which were instituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illustrious than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo, and of Antioch.

To these domestic testimonies we may add the confession, the complaints, and the ap∣prehensions of the Gentiles themselves.

who either celebrate or lament the progress of Christianity in the East, it may in general be observed, that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces. One circumstance, however, has been fortunately preserved, which seems to cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject. Under the reign of Theo∣dosius, after Christianity had enjoyed, during more than sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favour, the ancient and illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand per∣sons, three thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations <NOTE N="159" PLACE="foot">Chrysostom. Opera, tom. vii. p. 658. 810.</NOTE>. The splendour and dignity of the queen of the East, the acknow∣ledged populousness of Caesarea, Seleucia, and Alexandria, and the destruction of two hundred and fifty thousand souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder Justin <NOTE N="160" PLACE="foot">John Malela, tom. ii. p. 144. He draws the same conclusion with regard to the populousness of Antioch.</NOTE>, are so many convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less than half a million, and that the Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed a fifth part of that great city. How different a proportion must we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the triumphant church, the West with the East, remote villages with populous towns, and countries recently converted to the faith, with
<PB N="362" REF="377"/>
the place where the believers first received the appellation of Christians! It must not, however, be dissembled, that, in another passage, Chry∣sostom, to whom we are indebted for this useful information, computes the multitude of the faith∣ful as even superior to that of the Jews and Pa∣gans <NOTE N="161" PLACE="foot">Chrysostom. tom. i. p. 592. I am indebted for these passages, though not for my inference, to the learned Dr. Lardner. Credi∣bility of the Gospel History, vol. xii. p. 370.</NOTE>. But the solution of this apparent diffi∣culty is easy and obvious. The eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the eccle∣siastical constitution of Antioch; between the list of Christians who had acquired Heaven by bap∣tism, and the list of citizens who had a right to share the public liberality. Slaves, strangers, and infants were comprised in the former; they were excluded from the latter.</P>
<P>The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Egypt.</NOTE> its proximity to Palestine, gave an easy entrance to the new religion. It was at first embraced by great numbers of the Therapeutae, or Essenians of the lake Mareotis, a Jewish sect which had abated much of its reverence for the Mosaic ceremonies. The austere life of the Essenians, their fasts and excommunications, the community of goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline <NOTE N="162" PLACE="foot">Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. 2. c. 20, 21, 22, 23. has ex∣amined, with the most critical accuracy, the curious treatise of Philo, which describes the Therapeutae. By proving that it was composed as early as the time of Augustus, Basnage has demonstrated, in spite of Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17.), and a crowd of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutae were neither Christians nor monks. It still remains probable that they changed their name, preserved their manners, adopted some new articles of faith, and gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian Ascetics.</NOTE>. It was in
<PB N="363" REF="378"/>
the school of Alexandria that the Christian theo∣logy appears to have assumed a regular and sci∣entifical form; and when Hadrian visited Egypt, he found a church composed of Jews and of Greeks, sufficiently important to attract the no∣tice of that inquisitive prince <NOTE N="163" PLACE="foot">See a letter of Hadrian, in the Augustan History, p. 245.</NOTE>. But the pro∣gress of Christianity was for a long time confined within the limits of a single city, which was itself a foreign colony, and till the close of the second century the predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian church. Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Deme∣trius, and the number was increased to twenty by his successor Heraclas <NOTE N="164" PLACE="foot">For the succession of Alexandrian bishops, consult Renaudot's History, p. 24, &amp;c.

Whatever was strange or odious, whoever was guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that immense capital, to elude the vigilance of the law. In such a various conflux of nations, every teacher, either of truth or of falsehood, every founder, whether of a virtuous or a cri∣minal association, might easily multiply his dis∣ciples or accomplices. The Christians of Rome, at the time of the accidental persecution of Nero, are represented by Tacitus as already amount∣ing to a very great multitude <NOTE N="167" PLACE="foot">Ingens multitudo is the expression of Tacitus, xv. 44.</NOTE>, and the lan∣guage of that great historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the senate, it was likewise appre∣hended that a very great multitude, as it were <HI>another people,</HI> had been initiated into those ab∣horred mysteries. A more careful inquiry soon demonstrated, that the offenders did not exceed seven thousand; a number indeed sufficiently alarming, when considered as the object of pub∣lic justice <NOTE N="168" PLACE="foot">T. Liv. xxxix. 13. 15, 16, 17.

It is with the same candid allow∣ance
<PB N="365" REF="380"/>
that we should interpret the vague expres∣sions of Tacitus, and in a former instance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods. The church of Rome was un∣doubtedly the first and most populous of the em∣pire; and we are possessed of an authentic record which attests the state of religion in that city about the middle of the third century, and after a piece of thirty-eight years. The clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop, forty-six pres∣byters, seven deacons, as many sub-deacons, forty-two acolythes, and fifty readers, exorcists, and porters. The number of widows, of the in∣firm, and of the poor, who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred <NOTE N="169" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. vi. c. 43. The Latin translator (M. de Valois) has though proper to reduce the number of presbyters to forty∣four.</NOTE>. From reason, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may venture to estimate the Christians of Rome at about fifty thousand. The populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the Chris∣tians might constitute at the most a twentieth part <NOTE N="170" PLACE="foot">This proportion of the presbyters and of the poor, to the rest of the people, was originally fixed by Burnet (Travels into Italy, p. 168), and is approved by Moyle (vol. ii. p. 151.).

The western provincials appeared to have de∣rived the knowledge of Christianity from the same source which had diffused among them the lan∣guage, <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Africa and the western provinces.</NOTE> the sentiments, and the manners of Rome.

The African Christians soon formed one of the principal members of the primitive church.

and importance of their religious societies, which during the course of the third century were ani∣mated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius. But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must content ourselves with discovering, in the time of Marcus Antoni∣nus, the feeble and united congregations of Ly∣ons and Vienna; and even as late as the reign of Decius, we are assured, that in a few cities only, Arles, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges, Cler∣mont, Tours, and Paris, some scattered churches were supported by the devotion of a small num∣ber of Christians <NOTE N="173" PLACE="foot">Rarae in aliquibus civitatibus ecclesiae, paucorum Christianorum devotione, resurgerent.

Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion, but as it is seldom com∣patible with zeal, we may perceive and lament the languid state of Christianity in those pro∣vinces which had exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue; since they did not, during the three first centuries, give birth to a single eccle∣siastical writer. From Gaul, which claimed a just pre-eminence of learning and authority over all the countries on this side of the Alps, the light of the gospel was more faintly reflected on the remote provinces of Spain and Britain; and if we may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian, they had already received the first rays

the new religion, within a century after the death of its divine author, had already visited every part of the globe. <Q>There exists not, says Justin Martyr, a people, whether Greek or Barbarian, or any other race of men, by what∣soever appellation or manners they may be distinguished, however ignorant of arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tents, or wander about in covered waggons, among whom prayers are not offered up in the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of all things <NOTE N="177" PLACE="foot">Justin Martyr, Dialog. cum Tryphon. p. 341.

It will still remain an undoubted fact, that the barbarians of Scythia and Germany, who afterwards subverted the Roman monarchy, were involved in the dark∣ness of paganism; and that even the conversion of Iberia, of Armenia, or of Aethiopia, was not attempted with any degree of success till the sceptre was in the hands of an orthodox empe∣ror <NOTE N="178" PLACE="foot">See the fourth century of Mosheim's History of the Church.

From Edessa, the principles of Christianity were easily introduced into the Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the successors of Artaxerxes; but they do not appear to have made any deep impression on the minds of the Persians, whose religious system, by the labours of a well-disciplined order of priests, had been constructed with much more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of Greece and Rome <NOTE N="182" PLACE="foot">According to Bardesanes (ap.

From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of Christianity, it may perhaps seem probable, that the number of its proselytes <NOTE PLACE="marg">General proportion of Chris∣tians and Pagans.</NOTE> has been excessively magnified by fear on the one side, and by devotion on the other. According to the irreproachable testimony of Origen <NOTE N="183" PLACE="foot">Origen contra Celsum, l. viii. p. 424.</NOTE>, the proportion of the faithful was very inconsider∣able when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving world; but, as we are left without any distinct information, it is impossible to deter∣mine, and it is difficult even to conjecture, the real numbers of the primitive Christians. The most favourable calculation, however, that can be deduced from the examples of Antioch and of Rome, will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the banner of the cross before the important conversion of Constantine. But their habits of faith, of zeal, and of union, seemed to multiply their numbers; and the same causes which contributed to their future increase, served to render their actual strength more apparent and more formidable.</P>
<P>Such is the constitution of civil society, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the first Christians were mean and igno∣rant.</NOTE> whilst a few persons are distinguished by riches, by honours, and by knowledge, the body of the people is condemned to obscurity, ignorance, and poverty. The Christian religion, which addressed itself to the whole human race, must consequently collect a far greater number of proselytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of life.
<PB N="372" REF="387"/>
This innocent and natural circumstance has been improved into a very odious imputation, which seems to be less strenuously denied by the apolo∣gists, than it is urged by the adversaries, of the faith; that the new sect of Christians was almost entirely composed of the dregs of the populace, of peasants and mechanics, of boys and women, of beggars and slaves, the last of whom might sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged. These obscure teachers (such was the charge of malice and infidelity) are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in private. Whilst they cautiously avoid the dangerous en∣counter of philosophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and insinuate them∣selves into those minds, whom their age, their sex, or their education, has the best disposed to receive the impression of superstitious terrors <NOTE N="184" PLACE="foot">Minucius Foelix, c. 8. with Wowerus's notes.

<P>This unfavourable picture, though not devoid <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some ex∣ceptions with re∣gard to learning;</NOTE> of a faint resemblance, betrays, by its dark co∣louring and distorted features, the pencil of an enemy. As the humble faith of Christ diffused itself through the world, it was embraced by several persons who derived some consequence from the advantages of nature or fortune. Aris∣tides, who presented an eloquent apology to the emperor Hadrian, was an Athenian philosopher <NOTE N="185" PLACE="foot">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. iv. 3. Hieronym. Epist. 83.</NOTE>. Justin Martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of Zeno, of Aristotle, of Pythagoras,

and of Plato, before he fortunately was accosted by the old man, or rather the angel, who turned his attention to the study of the Jewish pro∣phets <NOTE N="186" PLACE="foot">The story is prettily told in Justin's Dialogues. Tillemont (Mem. Ecclesiast. tom. ii. p. 334.), who relates it after him, is sure that the old man was a disguised angel.</NOTE>. Clemens of Alexandria had acquired much various reading in the Greek, and Ter∣tullian in the Latin, language. Julius Africanus and Origen possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their times; and although the style of Cyprian is very different from that of Lactantius, we might almost discover that both those writers had been public teachers of rhe∣toric. Even the study of philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians, but it was not always productive of the most salutary effects; knowledge was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion, and the description which was designed for the followers of Artemon, may, with equal propriety, be applied to the various sects that resisted the successors of the apostles. <Q>They presume to alter the holy scriptures, to abandon the ancient rule of faith, and to form their opinions according to the subtile precepts of logic. The science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry, and they lose sight of Heaven while they are em∣ployed in measuring the earth. Euclid is per∣petually in their hands. Aristotle and Theo∣phrastus are the objects of their admiration; and they express an uncommon reverence for the works of Galen. Their errors are derived

<P>Nor can it be affirmed with truth, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">with re∣gard to rank and fortune.</NOTE> advantages of birth and fortune were always separated from the profession of Christianity.

His unsuspected testimony may, in this instance, obtain more credit than the bold challenge of Tertullian, when he addresses him∣self to the fears as well as to the humanity of the proconsul of Africa, by assuring him, that if he persists in his cruel intentions, he must decimate Carthage, and that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank, senators and matrons of noblest extraction, and the friends or relations of his most intimate friends <NOTE N="189" PLACE="foot">Tertullian ad Scapulam.

the Christian sect <NOTE N="190" PLACE="foot">Cyprian. Epist. 79.</NOTE>. The church still continued to increase its outward splendour as it lost its internal purity; and, in the reign of Diocletian, the palace, the courts of justice, and even the army, concealed a multitude of Christians, who endeavoured to reconcile the interests of the pre∣sent, with those of a future, life.</P>
<P>And yet these exceptions are either too few in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian∣ity most favourably received by the poor and simple.</NOTE> number, or too recent in time, entirely to re∣move the imputation of ignorance and obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the first proselytes of Christianity.

Our serious thoughts will suggest to us, that the apostles themselves were chosen by providence among the fishermen of Galilee, and that the lower we de∣press the temporal condition of the first Chris∣tians, the more reason we shall find to admire their merit and success. It is incumbent on us diligently to remember, that the kingdom of Heaven was promised to the poor in spirit, and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of mankind, cheerfully listen to the divine pro∣mise of future happiness; while, on the contrary, the fortunate are satisfied with the possession of this world; and the wise abuse in doubt and dis∣pute their vain superiority of reason and know∣ledge.</P>

which in our eyes might have seemed the most worthy of the heavenly present. The names of Seneca, of the elder and the younger Pliny, of Tacitus, of Plutarch, of Galen, of the slave Epic∣tetus, and of the emperor Marcus Antoninus, adorn the age in which they flourished, and exalt the dignity of human nature. They filled with glory their respective stations, either in active or contemplative life; their excellent understand∣ings were improved by study; Philosophy had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular superstition; and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue. Yet all these sages (it is no less an object of sur∣prise than of concern) overlooked or rejected the perfection of the Christian system. Their lan∣guage or their silence equally discover their con∣tempt for the growing sect, which in their time had diffused itself over the Roman empire. Those among them who condescend to mention the Christians, consider them only as obstinate and perverse enthusiasts, who exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines, without being able to produce a single argument that could engage the attention of men of sense and learning <NOTE N="191" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lardner, in his first and second volume of Jewish and Christian testimonies, collects and illustrates those of Pliny the younger, of Tacitus, of Galen, of Marcus Antoninus, and per∣haps of Epictetus (for it is doubtful whether that philosopher means to speak of the Christians).

It is at least doubtful whether any of these phi∣losophers perused the apologies which the primi∣tive Christians repeatedly published in behalf of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ne∣glect of prophecy</NOTE> themselves and of their religion; but it is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by abler advocates. They expose with super∣fluous wit and eloquence, the extravagance of Polytheism. They interest our compassion by displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured brethren. But when they would demon∣strate the divine origin of Christianity, they insist much more strongly on the predictions which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the appearance of the Messiah. Their favourite argument might serve to edify a Christian or to convert a Jew, since both the one and the other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies, and both are obliged, with devout reverence, to search for their sense and their accomplishment. But this mode of per∣suasion loses much of its weight and influence, when it is addressed to those who neither under∣stand nor respect the Mosaic dispensation and the prophetic style <NOTE N="192" PLACE="foot">If the famous prophecy of the Seventy Weeks had been al∣leged to a Roman philosopher, would he not have replied in the words of Cicero, "Quae tandem ista auguratio est, annorum potius quam aut mensium aut dierum?"

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>The Conduct of the Roman Government towards the Christians, from the Reign of Nero to that of Constantine.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion, the sanctity of its moral precepts, and the innocent as well as austere lives of the greater <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian∣ity perse∣cuted by the Ro∣man em∣perors.</NOTE> number of those, who during the first ages em∣braced the faith of the gospel, we should natu∣rally suppose, that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due reverence, even by the unbelieving world; that the learned and the polite, however they might deride the miracles, would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect; and that the magistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected an order of men who yield∣ed the most passive obedience to the laws, though they declined the active cares of war and govern∣ment. If on the other hand we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism, as it was in∣variably maintained by the faith of the people, the incredulity of philosophers, and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors, we are at a loss to discover what new offence the Christians had committed, what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity, and what new motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their
<PB N="382" REF="397"/>
gentle sway, to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects, who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive mode of faith and worship.</P>
<P>The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant cha∣racter, to oppose the progress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of Christ, his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most ami∣able and philosophic character, and according to the laws of an emperor, distinguished by the wis∣dom and justice of his general administration. The apologies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christians who obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty, of conscience, were alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government. The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been re∣corded with care; and from the time that Chris∣tianity was invested with the supreme power, the governors of the church have been no less dili∣gently employed in displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the conduct, of their Pagan adver∣saries. To separate (if it be possible) a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an un∣digested mass of fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the causes, the extent, the duration, and the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the
<PB N="383" REF="398"/>
first Christians were exposed, is the design of the present Chapter.</P>
<P>The sectaries of a persecuted religion, de∣pressed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into their motives.</NOTE> by fear, animated with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to appreciate, the motives of their ene∣mies, which often escape the impartial and dis∣cerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution. A reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians, which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Poly∣theism. It has already been observed, that the religious concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be expected, that they would unite with indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself from the communion of mankind, and claiming the exclusive possession of divine knowledge, should disdain every form of worship, except its own, as impious and ido∣latrous. The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence: they were justly for∣feited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the Jews, and by them alone, the consideration of the treatment which they expe∣rienced
<PB N="384" REF="399"/>
from the Roman magistrates, will serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by facts, and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecution of Christianity.</P>
<P>Without repeating what has been already men∣tioned, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellious spirit of the Jews.</NOTE> of the reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of Jerusalem, we shall only observe, that the destruction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors, and authorize religious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice and the public safety. From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the domi∣nion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsus∣pecting natives <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In Cyrene they massacred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude. Many of these unhappy victims were sawed asunder, according to a precedent to which David had given the sanction of his example. The victorious Jews devoured the flesh, licked up the blood, and twisted the entrails like a girdle round their bodies. See Dion Cassius, l. lxviii. p. 1145.</NOTE>; and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of
<PB N="385" REF="400"/>
the Roman government, but of humankind <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Without repeating the well-known narratives of Josephus, we may learn from Dion (l. lxix. p. 1162.), that in Hadrian's war 580,000 Jews were cut off by the sword, besides an infinite number which perished by famine, by disease, and by fire.</NOTE>. The enthusiasm of the Jews was supported by the opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous master; and by the flat∣tering promise which they derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Messiah would soon arise, destined to break their fetters, and to invest the favourites of heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by announcing himself as their long-expected deliverer, and by calling on all the descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of Israel, that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army, with which he resisted dur∣ing two years the power of the emperor Ha∣drian <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For the sect of the Zealots, see Basnage, Histoire des Juiss, l. i. c. 17. for the characters of the Messiah, according to the Rabbis, l. v. c. 11, 12, 13. for the actions of Barchochebas, l. vii. c. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these repeated provocations, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Toleration of the Jew∣ish religi∣on.</NOTE> the resentment of the Roman princes expired after the victory; nor were their apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and danger. By the general indulgence of polytheism, and by the mild temper of Antoninus Pius, the Jews were restored to their ancient privileges, and once more obtained the permission of circum∣cising their children, with the easy restraint, that they should never confer on any foreign proselyte
<PB N="386" REF="401"/>
that distinguishing mark of the Hebrew race <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">It is to Modestinus, a Roman lawyer (l. vi. regular.), that we are indebted for a distinct knowledge of the Edict of Antoninus. See Casaubon ad Hist. August. p. 27.</NOTE>. The numerous remains of that people, though they were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem, were permitted to form and to main∣tain considerable establishments both in Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of Rome, to enjoy municipal honours, and to obtain at the same time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of society. The modera∣tion or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was instituted by the vanquished sect. The pa∣triarch, who had fixed his residence at Tiberias, was empowered to appoint his subordinate mi∣nisters and apostles, to exercise a domestic juris∣diction, and to receive from his dispersed bre∣thren an annual contribution <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. iii. c. 2, 3. The office of Patriarch was suppressed by Theodosius the younger.</NOTE>. New synagogues were frequently erected in the principal cities of the empire; and the sabbaths, the fasts, and the festivals, which were either commanded by the Mosaic law, or enjoined by the traditions of the Rabbis, were celebrated in the most solemn and public manner <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">We need only mention the purim, or deliverance of the Jews from the rage of Haman, which, till the reign of Theodosius, was celebrated with insolent triumph and riotous intemperance. Bas∣nage, Hist. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 17. l. viii. c. 6.</NOTE>. Such gentle treatment insen∣sibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews. Awakened from their dream of prophecy and
<PB N="387" REF="402"/>
conquest, they assumed the behaviour of peace∣able and industrious subjects. Their irrecon∣cileable hatred of mankind, instead of flaming out in acts of blood and violence, evaporated in less dangerous gratifications. They embraced every opportunity of over-reaching the idolaters in trade; and they pronounced secret and ambi∣guous imprecations against the haughty kingdom of Edom <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">According to the false Josephus, Tsepho, the grandson of Esau, conducted into Italy the army of Aeneas, king of Carthage. An∣other colony of Idumaeans, flying from the sword of David, took refuge in the dominions of Romulus. For these, or for other rea∣sons of equal weight, the name of Edom was applied by the Jews to the Roman empire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jews were a peo∣ple which followed, the Chris∣tians a sect which deserted, the religi∣on of their fathers.</NOTE> the deities adored by their sovereign and by their fellow-subjects, enjoyed however the free exer∣cise of their unsocial religion; there must have existed some other cause, which exposed the dis∣ciples of Christ to those severities from which the posterity of Abraham was exempt. The differ∣ence between them is simple and obvious; but, according to the sentiments of antiquity, it was of the highest importance. The Jews were a <HI>nation;</HI> the Christians were a <HI>sect:</HI> and if it was natural for every community to respect the sacred institutions of their neighbours, it was incum∣bent on them to persevere in those of their an∣cestors. The voice of oracles, the precepts of philosophers, and the authority of the laws, una∣nimously enforced this national obligation. By their lofty claim of superior sanctity, the Jews
<PB N="388" REF="403"/>
might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race. By disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might de∣serve their contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous or absurd; yet since they had been received during many ages by a large society, his followers were justified by the example of mankind; and it was univer∣sally acknowledged, that they had a right to practise what it would have been criminal in them to neglect. But this principle which pro∣tected the Jewish synagogue, afforded not any favour or security to the primitive church. By embracing the faith of the Gospel, the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education, violated the religi∣ous institutions of their country, and presump∣tuously despised whatever their fathers had be∣lieved as true, or had reverenced as sacred. Nor was this apostacy (if we may use the expression) merely of a partial or local kind; since the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria, would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of Athens or Carthage. Every Christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family, his city, and his province. The whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of mankind. It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment. Though his situation might excite the pity, his
<PB N="389" REF="404"/>
arguments could never reach the understanding, either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world. To their apprehensions, it was no less a matter of surprise, that any indi∣viduals should entertain scruples against comply∣ing with the established mode of worship, than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners, the dress, or the language of their na∣tive country <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">From the arguments of Celsus, as they are represented and refuted by Origen (l. v. p. 247-259.), we may clearly discover the distinction that was made between the Jewish <HI>people</HI> and the Chris∣tian <HI>sect.</HI> See in the Dialogue of Minucius Foelix (c. 5, 6.) a fair and not inelegant description of the popular sentiments, with regard to the desertion of the established worship.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeed∣ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christia∣nity accus∣ed of athe∣ism, and mistaken by the peo∣ple and philoso∣phers.</NOTE> by resentment; and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous impu∣tation of impiety. Malice and prejudice con∣curred in representing the Christians as a society of atheists, who, by the most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire, had me∣rited the severest animadversion of the civil ma∣gistrate. They had separated themselves (they gloried in the confession) from every mode of superstition which was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism: but it was not altogether so evident what deity, or what form of worship, they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity. The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the Su∣preme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude, who were at a loss to discover
<PB N="390" REF="405"/>
a spiritual and solitary God, that was neither re∣presented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol, nor was adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals, of altars and sacrifices <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Cur nullas aras habent? templa nulla? nulla nota simulacra?—Unde autem, vel quis ille, aut ubi, Deus unicus, solitarius, destitutus? Minucius Foelix, c. 10. The Pagan interlocutor goes on to make a distinction in favour of the Jews, who had once a tem∣ple, altars, victims, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The sages of Greece and Rome, who had elevated their minds to the contempla∣tion of the existence and attributes of the First Cause, were induced by reason or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the privilege of this philosophical devotion <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">It is difficult (says Plato) to attain, and dangerous to publish, the knowledge of the true God. See the Theologie des Philosophes, in the Abbé d'Olivet's French translation of Tully de Naturâ Deo∣rum, tom. i. p. 275.</NOTE>. They were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth, but they con∣sidered them as flowing from the original dis∣position of human nature; and they supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the senses, would, in proportion as it receded from super∣stition, find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the visions of fana∣ticism. The careless glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the Chris∣tian revelation, served only to confirm their hasty opinion, and to persuade them, that the principle, which they might have revered, of the divine unity, was defaced by the wild enthusiasm,
<PB N="391" REF="406"/>
and annihilated by the airy speculations, of the new sectaries. The author of a celebrated dia∣logue, which has been attributed to Lucian, whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt, betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine perfections <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of the Philopatris perpetually treats the Christians as a company of dreaming enthusiasts, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. and in one place, manifestly alludes to the vision, in which St. Paul was transported to the third heaven. In another place, Triephon, who personates a Christian, after deriding the Gods of Paganism, proposes a mysterious oath,</P>

<P>It might appear less surprising, that the found∣er of Christianity should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a prophet, but that he should be adored as a God. The Polytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith, which seemed to offer any resemblance, however distant or imperfect, with the popular mythology; and the legends of Bacchus, of Hercules, and of Aesculapius, had, in some measure, prepared their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">According to Justin Martyr (Apolog. Major, c. 70-85), the daemon, who had gained some imperfect knowledge of the prophe∣cies, purposely contrived this resemblance, which might deter, though by different means, both the people and the philosophers from embracing the saith of Christ.</NOTE>. But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes, who, in the
<PB N="392" REF="407"/>
infancy of the world, had invented arts, insti∣tuted laws, and vanquished the tyrants or mon∣sters who infested the earth; in order to choose for the exclusive object of their religious wor∣ship, an obscure teacher, who, in a recent age, and among a barbarous people, had fallen a sa∣crifice either to the malice of his own country∣men, or to the jealousy of the Roman govern∣ment. The Pagan multitude, reserving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected the inestimable present of life and immortality, which was offered to mankind by Jesus of Nazareth. His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary sufferings, his universal benevolence, and the sublime simplicity of his actions and cha∣racter, were insufficient, in the opinion of those carnal men, to compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and of success; and whilst they re∣fused to acknowledge his stupendous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave, they misrepresented, or they insulted, the equi∣vocal birth, wandering life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author of Christianity <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">In the first and second books of Origen, Celsus treats the birth and character of our Saviour with the most impious contempt. The orator Libanius praises Porphyry and Julian for consuting the folly of a sect, which styled a dead man of Palestine, God, and the son of God, Socrates, Hist. Ecclesiast. iii. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The personal guilt which every Christian had <NOTE PLACE="marg">The union and assem∣blies of the Christians considered as a dan∣gerous conspiracy.</NOTE> contracted, in thus preferring his private senti∣ment to the national religion, was aggravated in a very high degree by the number and union of the criminals. It is well known, and has been already observed, that Roman policy viewed with
<PB N="393" REF="408"/>
the utmost jealousy and distrust any association among its subjects; and that the privileges of private corporations, though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes, were bestowed with a very sparing hand <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">The emperor Trajan refused to incorporate a company of 150 fire-men, for the use of the city of Nicomedia. He disliked all associations. See Plin. Epist. x. 42, 43.</NOTE>. The religious as∣semblies of the Christians, who had separated themselves from the public worship, appeared of a much less innocent nature: they were illegal in their principle, and in their consequences might become dangerous; nor were the empe∣rors conscious that they violated the laws of jus∣tice, when, for the peace of society, they pro∣hibited those secret and sometimes nocturnal meetings <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">The proconsul Pliny had published a general edict against un∣lawful meetings. The prudence of the Christians suspended their Agapae; but it was impossible for them to omit the exercise of pub∣lic worship.</NOTE>. The pious disobedience of the Christians made their conduct, or perhaps their designs, appear in a much more serious and cri∣minal light; and the Roman princes, who might perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready submission, deeming their honour concerned in the execution of their commands, sometimes attempted, by rigorous punishments, to subdue this independent spirit, which boldly acknowledged an authority superior to that of the magistrate. The extent and duration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it every day more deserving of his animadversion. We have already seen that the active and successful zeal of
<PB N="394" REF="409"/>
the Christians had insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every city of the em∣pire. The new converts seemed to renounce their family and country, that they might con∣nect themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society, which every where assumed a different character from the rest of mankind. Their gloomy and austere aspect, their abhor∣rence of the common business and pleasures of life, and their frequent predictions of impending calamities <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">As the prophecies of the Antichrist, approaching conflagration, &amp;c. provoked those Pagans whom they did not convert, they were men∣tioned with caution and reserve; and the Montanists were censured for disclosing too freely the dangerous secret. See Mosheim, p. 413.</NOTE>, inspired the Pagans with the appre∣hension of some danger, which would arise from the new sect, the more alarming as it was the more obscure. <Q>Whatever, says Pliny, may be the principle of their conduct, their inflex∣ible obstinacy appeared deserving of punish∣ment <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Neque enim dubitabam, quodcunque esset quod faterentur (such are the words of Pliny), pervicaciam certe et inflexibilem obstinatio∣nem debere puniri.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed the offices of religion were at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manners calumni∣ated.</NOTE> first dictated by fear and necessity; but they were continued from choice. By imitating the awful secresy which reigned in the Eleusinian mysteries, the Christians had flattered themselves that they should render their sacred institutions more re∣spectable in the eyes of the Pagan world <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">See Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, vol. i. p. 101. and Span∣heim, Remarques sur les Caesars de Julien, p. 468, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But
<PB N="395" REF="410"/>
the event, as it often happens to the operations of subtile policy, deceived their wishes and their expectations. It was concluded, that they only concealed, what they would have blushed to dis∣close. Their mistaken prudence afforded an op∣portunity for malice to invent, and for suspi∣cious credulity to believe, the horrid tales which described the Christians as the most wicked of human kind, who practised in their dark recesses every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest, and who solicited the favour of their unknown God by the sacrifice of every moral virtue. There were many who pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of this ab∣horred society. It was asserted, <Q>that a new∣born infant, entirely covered over with flour, was presented, like some mystic symbol of ini∣tiation, to the knife of the proselyte, who un∣knowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error; that as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated, the sectaries drank up the blood, greedily tore asunder the quivering members, and pledged themselves to eternal secresy, by a mutual consciousness of guilt. It was as confidently affirmed, that this inhuman sacrifice was suc∣ceeded by a suitable entertainment, in which intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust; till, at the appointed moment, the lights were suddenly extinguished, shame was ba∣nished, nature was forgotten; and, as acci∣dent might direct, the darkness of the night

<P>But the perusal of the ancient apologies was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their im∣prudent defence.</NOTE> sufficient to remove even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary. The Christians, with the intrepid security of inno∣cence, appeal from the voice of rumour to the equity of the magistrates. They acknowledge, that if any proof can be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to them, they are worthy of the most severe punishment. They provoke the punishment, and they challenge the proof. At the same time they urge, with equal truth and propriety, that the charge is not less devoid of probability, than it is destitute of evi∣dence; they ask, whether any one can seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the Gospel, which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful enjoyments, should inculcate the practice of the most abominable crimes; that a large society should resolve to dishonour itself in the eyes of its own members; and that a great number of persons of either sex, and every age and character, insensible to the fear of death or infamy, should consent to violate those principles which nature and education had imprinted most

It must, however, be acknowledged, that the conduct of the emperors who appeared the least favourable
<PB N="399" REF="414"/>
to the primitive church, is by no means so cri∣minal as that of modern sovereigns, who have employed the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinions of any part of their sub∣jects. From their reflections, or even from their own feelings, a Charles V. or a Louis XIV. might have acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience, of the obligation of faith, and of the innocence of error. But the princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were strangers to those principles which inspired and authorised the inflexible obstinacy of the Christians in the cause of truth, nor could they themselves dis∣cover in their own breasts, any motive which would have prompted them to refuse a legal, and as it were a natural, submission to the sacred institutions of their country. The same reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt, must have tended to abate the rigour, of their perse∣cutions. As they were actuated, not by the furious zeal of bigots, but by the temperate po∣licy of legislators, contempt must often have relaxed, and humanity must frequently have sus∣pended the execution of those laws, which they enacted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ. From the general view of their cha∣racter and motives we might naturally conclude: I. That a considerable time elapsed before they considered the new sectaries as an object deserv∣ing of the attention of government. II. That in the conviction of any of their subjects who were accused of so very singular a crime, they
<PB N="400" REF="415"/>
proceeded with caution and reluctance. III. That they were moderate in the use of punishments; and IV. That the afflicted church enjoyed many intervals of peace and tranquillity.

The slow and gradual abolition of the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to the more early proselytes of the Gospel. As they were far the greater part of the race of Abraham, they were distinguished by the peculiar mark of circumcision, offered up their devotions in the Temple of Jerusalem till its final destruction, and received both the Law and the Prophets as the genuine inspirations of the Deity. The Gentile converts, who by a spi∣ritual adoption had been associated to the hope of Israel, were likewise confounded under the

It was not long, per∣haps, before the Jews themselves, animated with a fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith, perceived the gradual separation of their Nazarene bre∣thren from the doctrine of the synagogue; and they would gladly have extinguished the dan∣gerous heresy in the blood of its adherents. But the decrees of heaven had already disarmed their malice; and though they might sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sedition, they no longer possessed the administration of criminal justice; nor did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman magistrate the rancour of their own zeal and prejudice. The provincial governors declared themselves ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the public safety: but as soon as they were informed, that it was a question not of facts but of words, a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the Jewish laws and prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the majesty of Rome seriously to discuss the obscure differences which might arise among a

The character of the philosophic historian, to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge of this singular transaction, would alone be sufficient to recommend it to our most attentive consideration.</P>
<P>In the tenth year of the reign of Nero, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fire of Rome un∣der the reign of Nero.</NOTE> capital of the empire was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example of former ages <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. xv. 38—44. Sueton. in Neron. c. 38. Dion Cassius, l. lxii. p. 1014. Orosius, vii. 7.</NOTE>. The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman virtue, the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars, the most holy temples, and the most splendid palaces, were involved in one common destruction. Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided, four only subsisted entire, three were levelled with the ground, and the remaining seven, which had experienced the fury of the flames, displayed a melancholy prospect of ruin and desolation. The vigilance of government appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might alleviate the sense of so dreadful a calamity. The Imperial gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude, temporary buildings were erected for their accommodation, and a plentiful supply of corn and provisions was distributed at
<PB N="404" REF="419"/>
a very moderate price <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">The price of wheat (probably of the <HI>modius)</HI> was reduced as low as <HI>terni Nummi;</HI> which would be equivalent to about fifteen shil∣lings the English quarter.</NOTE>. The most generous policy seemed to have dictated the edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the construction of private houses; and as it usually happens, in an age of prosperity, the conflagra∣tion of Rome, in the course of a few years, pro∣duced a new city, more regular and more beau∣tiful than the former. But all the prudence and humanity affected by Nero on this occasion were insufficient to preserve him from the popular suspicion. Every crime might be imputed to the assassin of his wife and mother; nor could the prince, who prostituted his person and dig∣nity on the theatre, be deemed incapable of the most extravagant folly. The voice of rumour accused the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital; and as the most incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people, it was gravely reported, and firmly be∣lieved, that Nero, enjoying the calamity which he had occasioned, amused himself with singing to his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">We may observe, that the rumour is mentioned by Tacitus with a very becoming distrust and hesitation, whilst it is greedily transcribed by Suetonius, and solemnly confirmed by Dion.</NOTE>. To divert a suspicion, which the power of de∣spotism was unable to suppress, the emperor re∣solved to substitute in his own place some ficti∣tious criminals. <Q>With this view (continues

Tacitus) he inflicted the most exquisite tor∣tures on those men, who, under the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel pu∣nishment of the Christians, as the in∣cendiaries of the city.</NOTE> with deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ, who in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death, by the sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">This testimony is alone sufficient to expose the anachronism of the Jews, who place the birth of Christ near a century sooner (Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. v. c. 14, 15.). We may learn from Josephus (Antiquitat. xviii. 3.), that the procuratorship of Pilate corresponded with the last ten years of Tiberius, A. D. 27—37. As to the particular time of the death of Christ, a very early tradition fixed it to the 25th of March, A. D. 29, under the con∣sulship of the two Gemini (Tertullian adv. Judaeos, c. 8.). This date, which is adopted by Pagi, cardinal Norris, and Le Clerc, seems, at least, as probable as the vulgar aera, which is placed (I know not from what conjectures) four years later.</NOTE>. For a while, this dire superstition was checked; but it again burst forth; and not only spread itself over Judaea, the first seat of this mis∣chievous sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which receives and protects, whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessions of those who were seized, discovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot"><HI>Odio humani generis convicti.</HI> These words may either signify the hatred of mankind towards the Christians, or the hatred of the Christians towards mankind. I have preferred the latter sense, as the most agreeable to the style of Tacitus, and to the popular error, of which a precept of the Gospel (See Luke xiv. 26.) had been, perhaps, the innocent occasion. My interpretation is justified by the authority of Lipsius; of the Italian, the French, and the English translators of Tacitus; of Mosheim (p. 102.), of Le Clerc (Historia Ecclesiast. p. 427.), of Dr. Lardner (Testimonies, vol. i. p. 345.), and of the bishop of Gloucester (Divine Legation, vol. iii. p. 38.).

They died in torments, and their torments were embittered by insult and derision. Some were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and exposed to the fury of dogs: others again, smeared over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the melan∣choly spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse race, and honoured with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the popu∣lace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but the pub∣lic abhorrence was changed into commisera∣tion, from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare, as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Tacit.

<P N="1">1. The most sceptical criticism is obliged to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the pas∣sage of Ta∣citus rela∣tive to the persecu∣tion of the Christians by Nero.</NOTE> respect the truth of this extraordinary fact, and the integrity of this celebrated passage of Ta∣citus. The former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate Suetonius, who mentions the pu∣nishment which Nero inflicted on the Christians, a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in Nerone, c. 16.

The latter may be proved by the consent of the most ancient ma∣nuscripts; by the inimitable character of the style of Tacitus; by his reputation, which
<PB N="408" REF="423"/>
guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud; and by the purport of his narration, which accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes, without insinuating that they possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">The passage concerning Jesus Christ, which was inserted into the text of Josephus, between the time of Origen and that of Euse∣bius, may furnish an example of no vulgar forgery. The accom∣plishment of the prophecies, the virtues, miracles, and resurrection of Jesus, are distinctly related. Josephus acknowledges that he was the Messiah, and hesitates whether he should call him a man. If any doubt can still remain concerning this celebrated passage, the reader may examine the pointed objections of Le Fevre (Haver∣camp. Joseph. tom. ii. p. 267—273.), the laboured answers of Daubuz (p. 187—232.), and the masterly reply (Bibliothéque Ancienne et Moderne, tom, vii. p. 237—288.) of an anonymous critic, whom I believe to have been the learned Abbé de Lon∣guerue.</NOTE>. 2.

Before he gave himself to the Public, he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity, and he was more than forty years of age, when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola, extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant poste∣rity. After making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the description of Ger∣many, he conceived, and at length executed, a
<PB N="409" REF="424"/>
more arduous work; the history of Rome, in thirty books, from the fall of Nero to the ac∣cession of Nerva. The administration of Nerva introduced an age of justice and prosperity, which Tacitus had destined for the occupation of his old age <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Principatum Divi Nervae, et imperium Trajani, uberiorem securioremque materiam senectuti seposui. Tacit. Hist. i.</NOTE>; but when he took a nearer view of his subject, judging, perhaps, that it was a more honourable, or a less invidious office, to record the vices of past tyrants, than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning monarch, he chose rather to relate, under the form of annals, the actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus. To collect, to dispose, and to adorn a series of fourscore years, in an immortal work, every sen∣tence of which is pregnant with the deepest ob∣servations and the most lively images, was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during the greatest part of his life. In the last years of the reign of Trajan, whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond its ancient limits, the historian was describing, in the second and fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of Tiberius <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">See Tacit. Annal. ii. 61. iv. 4.</NOTE>; and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne, before Tacitus, in the regular prosecu∣tion of his work, could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the un∣fortunate Christians. At the distance of sixty years, it was the duty of the annalist to adopt
<PB N="410" REF="425"/>
the narratives of contemporaries; but it was na∣tural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin, the progress, and the character of the new sect, not so much ac∣cording to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero, as according to those of the time of Hadrian. 3. Tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas, which, in his extreme conciseness, he has thought proper to suppress. We may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome, whose obscurity, as well as innocence, should have shielded them from his indignation, and even from his notice. The Jews, who were numerous in the capital, and oppressed in their own country, were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people; nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation, who already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke, might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge. But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace, and even in the heart of the tyrant; his wife and mistress, the beautiful Poppaea, and a favourite player of the race of Abraham, who had already employed their intercession in behalf of the obnoxious people <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">The player's name was Aliturus. Through the same channel, Josephus (de Vitâ suâ, c. 3.), about two years before, had obtained the pardon and release of some Jewish priests who were prisoners at Rome.</NOTE>. In their room it.

was necessary to offer some other victims, and it might easily be suggested that, although the genuine followers of Moses were innocent of the fire of Rome, there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of GALILAEANS, which was capable of the most horrid crimes. Under the appellation of GALILAEANS, two distinctions of men were confounded, the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles; the disciples who had embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">The learned Dr. Lardner (Jewish and Heathen Testimonies, vol. ii. p. 102, 103.) has proved that the name of Galilaeans, was a very ancient, and perhaps the primitive, appellation of the Chris∣tians.</NOTE>, and the zealots who had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiquitat. xviii. 1, 2. Tillemont, Ruine des Juifs, p. 742. The sons of Judas were crucified in the time of Claudius.

When the batter∣ing ram had made a breach, they turned their swords against their wives, their children, and at length against their own breasts. They died to the last man.</NOTE>. The former were the friends, the latter were the enemies, of humankind; and the only resem∣blance between them consisted in the same in∣flexible constancy, which, in the defence of their cause, rendered them insensible of death and tortures. The followers of Judas, who impelled their countrymen into rebellion, were soon buried under the ruins of Jerusalem; whilst those of Jesus, known by the more celebrated name of Christians, diffused themselves over the Roman empire. How natural was it for Tacitus, in the time of Hadrian, to appropriate to the Christians,
<PB N="412" REF="427"/>
the guilt and the sufferings, which he might, with far greater truth and justice, have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost ex∣tinguished! 4.

The Latins (from the time of Jerome) improved on that hint, asserted the perpetual celibacy of Joseph, and justified by many similar examples the new interpretation that Jude, as well as Simon and James, who are styled the brothers of Jesus Christ, were only his first cousins.

<P N="2">II. About ten years afterwards, under the reign <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance of Pliny concerning the Chris∣tians.</NOTE> of Trajan, the younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master with the government of Bithynia and Pontus. He soon found himself at a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should direct his conduct in the execution of an office the most repugnant to his humanity. Pliny had never assisted at any judicial proceed∣ings against the Christians, with whose name alone he seems to be acquainted; and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt, the method of their conviction, and the degree of their punishment. In this per∣plexity he had recourse to his usual expedient, of submitting to the wisdom of Trajan an impartial, and in some respects, a favourable, account of the new superstition, requesting the emperor, that he would condescend to resolve his doubts, and to instruct his ignorance <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Plin.

The life of Pliny had been employed in the acquisition of learn∣ing,

From <HI>his</HI> ignorance there∣fore we may derive some useful information. We may assure ourselves, that when he accepted the government of Bithynia, there were no gene∣ral laws or decrees of the senate in force against the Christians; that neither Trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors, whose edicts were re∣ceived into the civil and criminal jurisprudence, had publicly declared their intentions concerning the new sect; and that whatever proceedings had been carried on against the Christians, there were none of sufficient weight and authority to esta∣blish a precedent for the conduct of a Roman magistrate.</P>
<P>The answer of Trajan, to which the Christians <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trajan and his succes∣sors esta∣blish a le∣gal mode of pro∣ceeding against them.</NOTE> of the succeeding age have frequently appealed, discovers as much regard for justice and huma∣nity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions of religious policy <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Plin.

Instead of dis∣playing the implacable zeal of an inquisitor,
<PB N="419" REF="434"/>
anxious to discover the most minute particles of heresy, and exulting in the number of his vic∣tims, the emperor expresses much more solicitude to protect the security of the innocent, than to prevent the escape of the guilty. He acknow∣ledges the difficulty of fixing any general plan; but he lays down two salutary rules, which often afforded relief and support to the distressed Chris∣tians. Though he directs the magistrates to punish such persons as are legally convicted, he prohibits them, with a very humane inconsistency, from making any inquiries concerning the sup∣posed criminals. Nor was the magistrate allow∣ed to proceed on every kind of information. Anonymous charges the emperor rejects, as too repugnant to the equity of his government; and he strictly requires, for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of Christianity is imputed, the positive evidence of a fair and open accuser. It is likewise probable, that the persons who assumed so invidious an office, were obliged to declare the grounds of their suspicions, to specify (both in respect to time and place) the secret assemblies, which their Christian adversary had frequented, and to disclose a great number of circumstances, which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from the eye of the pro∣fane. If they succeeded in their prosecution, they were exposed to the resentment of a con∣siderable and active party, to the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind, and to the ig∣nominy which, in every age and country, has

attended the character of an informer. If, on the contrary, they failed in their proofs, they incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty, which, according to a law published by the em∣peror Hadrian, was inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their fellow-citizens the crime of Christianity. The violence of personal or super∣stitious animosity might sometimes prevail over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger; but it cannot surely be imagined, that accusations of so unpromising an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the Pagan subjects of the Roman empire <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Eusebius (Hist.

The second Apology of Justin contains some curious particulars relative to the accusations of Christians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The expedient which was employed to elude <NOTE PLACE="marg">Popular clamours.</NOTE> the prudence of the laws, affords a sufficient proof how effectually they disappointed the mis∣chievous designs of private malice or superstitious zeal. In a large and tumultuous assembly the restraints of fear and shame, so forcible on the minds of individuals, are deprived of the greatest part of their influence. The pious Christian, as he was desirous to obtain or to escape the glory of martyrdom, expected, either with im∣patience or with terror, the stated returns of the public games and festivals. On those occasions, the inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were collected in the circus of the theatre, where every circumstance of the place, as well as of the
<PB N="421" REF="436"/>
ceremony, contributed to kindle their devotion, and to extinguish their humanity. Whilst the numerous spectators, crowned with garlands, per∣fumed with incense, purified with the blood of victims, and surrounded with the altars and sta∣tues of their tutelar deities, resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures, which they con∣sidered as an essential part of their religious wor∣ship; they recollected that the Christians alone abhorred the gods of mankind, and by their ab∣sence and melancholy on these solemn festivals, seemed to insult or to lament the public felicity. If the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity, by a plague, a famine, or an unsuc∣cessful war; if the Tyber had, or if the Nile had not, risen beyond its banks; if the earth had shaken, or if the temperate order of the sea∣sons had been interrupted, the superstitious Pa∣gans were convinced, that the crimes and the impiety of the Christians, who were spared by the excessive lenity of the government, had at length provoked the Divine Justice. It was not among a licentious and exasperated populace, that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed; it was not in an amphitheatre, stained with the blood of wild beasts and gladiators, that the voice of compassion could be heard. The impatient clamours of the multitude denounced the Chris∣tians as the enemies of gods and men, doomed them to the severest tortures, and venturing to accuse by name some of the most distinguished of the new sectaries, required with irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly appre∣hended

It was not so much the past offence, as the actual resistance, which excited the indignation of the magistrate. He was persuaded that he offered them an easy par∣don, since if they consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar, they were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause.

It was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavour to reclaim, rather than to punish, those deluded enthusiasts. Varying his tone according to the age, the sex, or the situation of the pri∣soners, he frequently condescended to set before their eyes every circumstance which could render life more pleasing, or death more terrible; and to solicit, nay to intreat, them, that they would shew some compassion to themselves, to their families, and to their friends <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">See the rescript of Trajan, and the conduct of Pliny. The most authentic acts of the martyrs abound in these exhortations.</NOTE>. If threats and persuasions proved ineffectual, he had often re∣course to violence; the scourge and the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argu∣ment, and every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and, as it appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The ancient apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal truth and severity, the irregular conduct of their persecutors, who, contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding, admitted the use of torture, in order to obtain, not a con∣fession, but a denial, of the crime which was the object of their inquiry <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">In particular, see Tertullian (Apolog. c. 2, 3.), and Lactantius (Institut.

The monks of suc∣ceeding ages, who, in their peaceful solitudes, entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature. In particu∣lar,
<PB N="424" REF="439"/>
it has pleased them to suppose, that the zeal of the Roman magistrates, disdaining every con∣sideration of moral virtue or public decency, endeavoured to seduce those whom they were unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to seduce. It is related, that pious females, who were prepared to despise death, were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, and called upon to determine whe∣ther they set a higher value on their religion or on their chastity. The youths to whose licen∣tious embraces they were abandoned, received a solemn exhortation from the judge, to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars. Their violence how∣ever was commonly disappointed, and the season∣able interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses of Christ from the dishonour even of an involuntary defeat. We should not indeed neglect to remark, that the more ancient as well as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with these extra∣vagant and indecent fictions <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">See two instances of this kind of torture in the Acta Sincera Martyrum, published by Ruinart, p. 160. 399.

The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth cen∣turies ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolators of their own times. It is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the empire, might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace, and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be stimulated by motives of avarice or of per∣sonal resentment <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">The conversion of his wife provoked Claudius Herminianus, governor of Cappadocia, to treat the Christians with uncommon seve∣rity.

Two officers of rank, who were intrusted with that commission, placed Cyprian between them in a chariot; and as the proconsul was not then at leisure, they conducted him, not to a prison, but to a private house in Carthage, which belonged to one of them.

His faithful presbyters and deacons were permit∣ted to accompany their holy bishop. They assisted him in laying aside his upper garment, spread linen on the ground to catch the precious relics of his blood, and received his orders to bestow five-and-twenty pieces of gold on the executioner. The martyr then covered his face with his hands, and at one blow his head was separated from his body. His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles: but in the night it was removed, and transported in a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination to the burial-place of the Christians. The funeral of Cyprian was publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magistrates; and those among the faithful who had performed the last offices to his person and his memory, were secure from the danger of inquiry or of punishment. It is remark∣able, that of so great a multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of mar∣tyrdom <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Pontius, c. 19.

It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live an apostate: but on that choice depended the alternative of honour or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Various in∣citements to martyr∣dom.</NOTE> infamy. Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had employed the profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or ambition, it was still incumbent on him to support the character which he had assumed <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Whatever opinion we may entertain of the character or prin∣ciples of Thomas Becket, we must acknowledge that he suffered death with a constancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs.

But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere con∣viction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached, the crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of desire rather than of terror. It is not easy to extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declama∣tions of the Fathers, or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory and happiness which they con∣fidently promised to those who were so fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of religion <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">See in particular the treatise of Cyprian de Lapsis, p. 87—98.

the fire of martyrdom supplied every defect and expiated every sin; that while the souls of ordi∣nary Christians were obliged to pass through a slow and painful purification, the triumphant sufferers entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliss, where, in the society of the patri∣archs, the apostles, and the prophets, they reigned with Christ, and acted as his assessors in the universal judgment of mankind. The assurance of a lasting reputation upon earth, a motive so congenial to the vanity of human nature, often served to animate the courage of the martyrs. The honours which Rome or Athens bestowed on those citizens who had fallen in the cause of their country, were cold and unmeaning demonstra∣tions of respect, when compared with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expressed towards the victorious cham∣pions of the faith. The annual commemoration of their virtues and sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony, and at length terminated in religious worship. Among the Christians who had publicly confessed their religious principles, those, who (as it very frequently happened) had been dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the Pagan magistrates, obtained such honours as were justly due to their imperfect martyrdom and their generous resolution. The most pious females courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters which they had worn, and on the wounds which they had received.

Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain, the intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace had disposed for the easy reception of religious truth. On these melancholy occasions, there were many among the Gentiles who pitied, who admired, and who were converted.

As the lives of the faithful became less mortified and austere, they were every day less ambitious of the ho∣nours of martyrdom; and the soldiers of Christ, instead of distinguishing themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism, frequently deserted their post, and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their duty to resist. There were three methods, however, of escaping the flames of persecution, which were not attended with an equal degree of guilt: the first indeed was ge∣nerally allowed to be innocent; the second was of a doubtful, or at least of a venial, nature; but the third implied a direct and criminal apos∣tacy from the Christian faith.</P>

If he entertained any doubt of his own constancy, such a delay afforded him the opportunity of preserving his life and honour by flight, of withdrawing himself into some ob∣scure retirement or some distant province, and of patiently expecting the return of peace and security. A measure so consonant to reason was soon authorized by the advice and example of the most holy prelates; and seems to have been censured by few, except by the Montanists, who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate adherence to the rigour of ancient discipline <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot">Tertullian considers flight from persecution, as an imperfect, but very criminal, apostacy, as an impious attempt to elude the will of God, &amp;c. &amp;c.

In every persecution there were great numbers of unworthy Christians, who publicly disowned or renounced the faith which they had professed; and who confirmed the sin∣cerity of their abjuration, by the legal acts of burning incense or of offering sacrifices.

IV. Notwithstanding the general rules, esta∣blished for the conviction and punishment of the Christians, the fate of those sectaries, in an ex∣tensive <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alterna∣tives of severity and tolera∣tion.</NOTE> and arbitrary government, must still, in a great measure, have depended on their own behaviour, the circumstances of the times, and the temper of their supreme as well as subordi∣nate rulers. Zeal might sometimes provoke, and prudence might sometimes avert or assuage, the superstitious fury of the Pagans. A variety of motives might dispose the provincial gover∣nors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the laws; and of these motives, the most forcible was their regard not only for the public edicts, but for the secret intentions of the em∣peror, a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the flames of persecution. As often as any occasional severities were exer∣cised in the different parts of the empire, the primitive Christians lamented and perhaps mag∣nified their own sufferings; but the celebrated <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ten persecu∣tions.</NOTE> number of <HI>ten</HI> persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth century, who possessed a more distinct view of the pro∣sperous or adverse fortunes of the church, from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian.

suggested this calculation to their minds; and in their application of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history, they were careful to select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the Christian cause <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">See Mosheim, p. 97. Sulpicius Severus was the first author of this computation; though he seemed desirous of reserving the tenth and greatest persecution for the coming of the Antichrist.</NOTE>. But these transient persecutions served only to revive the zeal, and to restore the discipline of the faithful: and the moments of extraordinary rigour were compen∣sated by much longer intervals of peace and security. The indifference of some princes, and the indulgence of others, permitted the Christ∣ians to enjoy, though not perhaps a legal, yet an actual and public, toleration of their reli∣gion.</P>
<P>The apology of Tertullian contains two very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Supposed edicts of Tiberius and Mar∣cus Anto∣ninus.</NOTE> ancient, very singular, but at the same time very suspicious instances of Imperial clemency; the edicts published by Tiberius, and by Marcus Antoninus, and designed not only to protect the innocence of the Christians, but even to pro∣claim those stupendous miracles which had at∣tested the truth of their doctrine.

We are required to believe, <HI>that</HI> Pontius Pilate in∣formed

The edict of Marcus Antoninus is supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude, for the mi∣raculous deliverance which he had obtained in the Marcomannic war. The distress of the le∣gions, the seasonable tempest of rain and hail, of thunder and of lightning, and the dismay and defeat of the barbarians, have been celebrated by the eloquence of several Pagan writers. If there were any Christians in that army, it was natural that they should ascribe some merit to

the servent prayers, which, in the moment of danger, they had offered up for their own and the public safety. But we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble, by the Imperial medals, and by the Antonine column, that nei∣ther the prince nor the people entertained any sense of this signal obligation, since they una∣nimously attribute their deliverance to the pro∣vidence of Jupiter, and to the interposition of Mercury. During the whole course of his reign, Marcus despised the Christians as a philosopher, and punished them as a sovereign <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">On this miracle, as it is commonly called, of the thundering legion, see the admirable criticism of Mr. Moyle, in his Works, vol. ii. p. 81—390.</NOTE>.</P>

Under the gracious protection of Marcia, they passed in safety the thirteen years of a cruel ty∣ranny; and when the empire was established in the house of Severus, they formed a domestic but more honourable connexion with the new court. The emperor was persuaded, that, in a dangerous sickness, he had derived some benefit, either spiritual or physical, from the holy oil, with which one of his slaves had anointed him. He always treated with peculiar distinction se∣veral persons of both sexes who had embraced the new religion. The nurse as well as the pre∣ceptor of Caracalla were Christians; and if that young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of hu∣manity, it was occasioned by an incident, which, however trifling, bore some relation to the cause of Christianity <NOTE N="108" PLACE="foot">Compare the life of Caracalla in the Augustan History, with the epistle of Tertullian to Scapula.

frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful, and converted to his own use a con∣siderable part of the public revenue. By his pride and luxury, the Christian religion was ren∣dered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles.

Several councils were held, confuta∣tions were published, excommunications were pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused, treaties were con∣cluded and violated, and at length Paul of Samosata was degraded from his episcopal cha∣racter, by the sentence of seventy or eighty bishops, who assembled for that purpose at An∣tioch, and who, without consulting the rights of the clergy or people, appointed a successor by their own authority. The manifest irregularity of this proceeding increased the numbers of the discontented faction; and as Paul, who was no

The victory of Aurelian chang∣ed the face of the East, and the two contending parties, who applied to each other the epithets of schism and heresy, were either commanded or permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror. This public and very singular trial affords a convincing proof, that the exist∣ence, the property, the privileges, and the inter∣nal policy, of the Christians were acknowledged, if not by the laws, at least by the magistrates of the empire. As a Pagan and as a soldier, it could scarcely by expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion, whether the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith. His determination, however, was founded on the general principles of equity and reason. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The sen∣tence is executed by Aure∣lian.</NOTE> He considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable judges among the Chris∣tians, and as soon as he was informed, that they <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The bishops held an honourable rank in their respective provinces, and were treated with dis∣tinction and respect, not only by the people, but by the magistrates themselves. Almost in every city, the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the increasing multitude of proselytes; and in their place more stately and capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the faithful.

Prosperity had relaxed the nerves of discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice, prevailed in every congregation. The pres∣byters aspired to the episcopal office, which every day became an object more worthy of their ambition.

<P>Notwithstanding this seeming security, an at∣tentive <NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of zeal and superstiti∣on among the Pa∣gans.</NOTE> observer might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured. The zeal and rapid progress of the Christians awakened the Polytheists from their supine indif∣ference in the cause of those deities, whom custom and education had taught them to revere. The mutual provocations of a religious war, which had already continued above two hundred years, exasperated the animosity of the contending par∣ties. The Pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent and obscure sect, which presumed to

accuse their countrymen of error, and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery. The habits of justifying the popular mythology against the in∣vectives of an implacable enemy, produced in their minds some sentiments of faith and reve∣rence for a system which they had been accus∣tomed to consider with the most careless levity. The supernatural powers assumed by the church inspired at the same time terror and emulation.

The minds of those princes had never been enlightened by science; education had never softened their temper. They owed their greatness to their swords, and in their most ele∣vated fortune they still retained their superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants. In the gene∣ral administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their benefactor had established; but they frequently found occasions of exercising within their camp and palaces a secret persecu∣tion <NOTE N="144" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. viii. c. 4. c. 17.

The soldiers, as soon as they recovered from their astonishment, secured the person of Marcellus.

Examples of such a nature savour much less of religious persecution than of martial or even civil law: but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors, to justify the severity of Galerius, who dismissed a great number of Christian officers from their employ∣ments; and to authorize the opinion, that a sect of enthusiasts, which avowed principles so repug∣nant to the public safety, must either remain useless, or would soon become dangerous, sub∣jects of the empire.</P>

Perhaps they represented, that the glorious work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect, as long as an independent people was permitted to subsist and multiply in the heart of the provinces. The Christians (it might speciously be alleged), renouncing the gods and the institutions of Rome, had constituted a distinct republic, which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired any military force: but which was already governed by its own laws and magistrates, was possessed of a public treasure, and was intimately connected in all its parts, by the frequent assemblies of the bishops, to whose decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obe∣dience. Arguments like these, may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new system of persecution: but though we may suspect, it is not in our power to relate, the secret intrigues of the palace, the pri∣vate views and resentments, the jealousy of women or eunuchs, and all those trifling but decisive causes which so often influence the fate of empires, and the counsels of the wisest monarchs <NOTE N="148" PLACE="foot">The only circumstance which we can discover, is the devotion and jealousy of the mother of Galerius.

The doors were instantly broke open; they rushed into the sanctuary; and as they searched in vain for some visible object of worship, they were obliged to content themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of holy scripture. The ministers of Diocletian were followed by a nume∣rous body of guards and pioneers, who marched in order of battle, and were provided with all the instruments used in the destruction of forti∣fied cities.

It was enacted, that their churches, in all the provinces of the empire, should be demolished to their founda∣tions; and the punishment of death was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies for the purpose of religious worship. The philosophers, who now assumed the unwor∣thy office of directing the blind zeal of persecu∣tion, had diligently studied the nature and genius of the Christian religion; and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to be contained in the writ∣ings of the prophets, of the evangelists, and of the apostles, they most probably suggested the order, that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates; who were commanded, under the severest penalties, to burn them in a public

and solemn manner. By the same edict, the property of the church was at once confiscated; and the several parts of which it might consist, were either sold to the highest bidder, united to the Imperial domain, bestowed on the cities and corporations, or granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers. After taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship, and to dissolve the government, of the Christians, it was thought necessary to subject to the most intolerable hard∣ships the condition of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of Nature, of Rome, and of their ancestors. Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honours or employments; slaves were for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom, and the whole body of the people were put out of the protec∣tion of the law. The judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a Christian. But the Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themselves had suffered; and thus those unfortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity, while they were excluded from the benefits, of public justice. This new species of martyrdom, so painful and lingering, so obscure and ignominious, was, perhaps, the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful: nor can it be doubted that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors. But the policy of a well-ordered government must sometimes have

<P>His fears were soon alarmed by the view of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fire of the palace of Nicomedia imputed to the Chris∣tians.</NOTE> danger from which he very narrowly escaped. Within fifteen days the palace of Nicomedia, and even the bedchamber of Diocletian, were twice in flames; and though both times they were extinguished without any material damage, the singular repetition of the fire was justly con∣sidered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence. The sus∣picion naturally fell on the Christians; and it was suggested, with some degree of probability, that those desperate fanatics, provoked by their present sufferings, and apprehensive of impending calamities, had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren, the eunuchs of the palace, against the lives of two emperors, whom they detested as the irreconcileable enemies of the church of God. Jealousy and resentment pre∣vailed in every breast, but especially in that of Diocletian. A great number of persons, distin∣guished either by the offices which they had filled, or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were thrown into prison. Every mode of torture was put in practice, and the court, as well as city, was polluted with many bloody executions <NOTE N="155" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M. P. c. 13, 14.

But as it was found impossible to extort any discovery of this mysterious transaction, it seems incumbent on us either to presume the innocence, or to admire the resolution, of the sufferers. A few days afterwards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia, declaring, that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace, he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of the Chris∣tians. The ecclesiastical historians, from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect know∣ledge of this persecution, are at a loss how to account for the fears and dangers of the empe∣rors. Two of these writers, a Prince and a Rhe∣torician, were eye-witnesses of the fire of Nico∣media. The one ascribes it to lightning, and the divine wrath; the other affirms, that it was kin∣dled by the malice of Galerius himself <NOTE N="156" PLACE="foot">See Lactantius, Eusebius, and Constantine, ad Coetum Sanc∣torum, c. 25. Eusebius confesses his ignorance of the cause of the fire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the edict against the Christians was designed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the first edict.</NOTE> for a general law of the whole empire, and as Diocletian and Galerius, though they might not wait for the consent, were assured of the concur∣rence, of the western princes, it would appear more consonant to our ideas of policy, that the governors of all the provinces should have received secret instructions to publish, on one and the same day, this declaration of war within their respective departments. It was at least to be
<PB N="473" REF="488"/>
expected, that the convenience of the public highways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost dispatch from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities of the Roman world; and that they would not have suffered fifty days to elapse, before the edict was published in Syria, and near four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa <NOTE N="157" PLACE="foot">Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. tom. v. part i. p. 43.</NOTE>. This delay may perhaps be im∣puted to the cautious temper of Diocletian, who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures of persecution, and who was desirous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye, before he gave way to the disorders and discon∣tent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant provinces. At first, indeed, the magis∣trates were restrained from the effusion of blood; but the use of every other severity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal; nor could the Christians, though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches, resolve to inter∣rupt their religious assemblies, or to deliver their sacred books to the flames. The pious obstinacy of Felix, an African bishop, appears to have embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the go∣vernment. The curator of his city sent him in chains to the proconsul. The proconsul trans∣mitted him to the Praetorian praefect of Italy; and Felix, who disdained even to give an evasive answer, was at length beheaded at Venusia, in Lucania, a place on which the birth of Horace

This precedent, and perhaps some Imperial rescript, which was issued in consequence of it, appeared to authorize the governors of provinces, in punishing with death the refusal of the Christians to deliver up their sacred books. There were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity of ob∣taining the crown of martyrdom; but there were likewise too many who purchased an igno∣minious life, by discovering and betraying the holy scripture into the hands of infidels. A great number even of bishops and presbyters acquired, by this criminal compliance, the opprobrious epithet of <HI>Traditors;</HI> and their offence was pro∣ductive of much present scandal, and of much future discord, in the African Church <NOTE N="159" PLACE="foot">See the first book of Optatus of Milevis against the Donatists at Paris, 1700.

But the ruin of the churches was easily effected by the authority of the govern∣ment, and by the labour of the Pagans. In some provinces, however, the magistrates con∣tented themselves with shutting up the places of
<PB N="475" REF="490"/>
religious worship. In others, they more literally complied with the terms of the edict; and after taking away the doors, the benches, and the pulpit, which they burnt, as it were in a funeral pile, they completely demolished the remainder of the edifice <NOTE N="160" PLACE="foot">The ancient monuments, published at the end of Optatus, p. 261, &amp;c. describe, in a very circumstantial manner, the proceed∣ings of the governors in the destruction of churches.

It consisted of two chalices of gold, and six of silver; six urns, one kettle, seven lamps, all likewise of silver; besides a large quantity of brass uten∣sils, and wearing apparel.</NOTE>. It is perhaps to this melan∣choly occasion, that we should apply a very remarkable story, which is related with so many circumstances of variety and improbability, that it serves rather to excite than to satisfy our curi∣osity. In a small town in Phrygia, of whose name as well as situation we are left ignorant, it should seem, that the magistrates and the body of the people had embraced the Christian saith; and as some resistance might be apprehended to the execution of the edict, the governor of the province was supported by a numerous detach∣ment of legionaries. On their approach the citizens threw themselves into the church, with the resolution either of defending by arms that sacred edifice, or of perishing in its ruins. They indignantly rejected the notice and permission which was given them, to retire, till the soldiers, provoked by their obstinate refusal, set fire to the building on all sides, and consumed, by this ex∣traordinary

As Phrygia reached to the confines of Isauria, it is possible that the restless temper of those independent Barbarians may have contributed to this misfortune.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some slight disturbances, though they were suppressed almost as soon as excited, in Syria <NOTE PLACE="marg">Subse∣quent e∣dicts.</NOTE> and the frontiers of Armenia, afforded the ene∣mies of the church a very plausible occasion to insinuate, that those troubles had been secretly fomented by the intrigues of the bishops, who had already forgotten their ostentatious profes∣sions of passive and unlimited obedience <NOTE N="162" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. viii. c. 6. M. de Valois (with some probability) thinks that he has discovered the Syrian rebellion in an oration of Libanius; and that it was a rash attempt of the tribune Eugenius, who with only five hundred men seized Antioch, and might perhaps allure the Christians by the promise of religious toleration. From Eusebius (l. ix. c. 8.) as well as from Moses of Chorene (Hist. Armen. l. ii. c. 77, &amp;c.) it may be inferred, that Christianity was already introduced into Armenia.</NOTE>. The resentment, or the fears, of Diocletian, at length transported him beyond the bounds of moderation, which he had hitherto preserved, and he declared, in a series of cruel edicts, his intention of abolishing the Christian name. By the first of these edicts, the governors of the provinces were directed to apprehend all persons of the ecclesiastical order; and the prisons, des∣tined for the vilest criminals, were soon filled with a multitude of bishops, presbyters, deacons,
<PB N="477" REF="492"/>
readers, and exorcists. By a second edict, the magistrates were commanded to employ every method of severity, which might reclaim them from their odious superstition, and oblige them to return to the established worship of the gods. This rigorous order was extended, by a subse∣quent edict, to the whole body of Christians, who were exposed to a violent and general persecu∣tion <NOTE N="163" PLACE="foot">See Mosheim, p. 938; the text of Eusebius very plainly shews, that the governors, whose powers were enlarged, not restrained, by the new laws, could punish with death the most obstinate Christians, as an example to their brethren.</NOTE>. Instead of those salutary restraints, which had required the direct and solemn testi∣mony of an accuser, it became the duty as well as the interest of the Imperial officers, to discover, to pursue, and to torment, the most obnoxious among the faithful. Heavy penalties were de∣nounced against all who should presume to save a proscribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods, and of the emperors. Yet, notwithstand∣ing the severity of this law, the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans, in concealing their friends or relations, affords an honourable proof, that the rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the sentiments of nature and huma∣nity <NOTE N="164" PLACE="foot">Athanasius, p. 833. ap. Tillemont, Mem. Ecclesiast. tom. v. part i. p. 90.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts <NOTE PLACE="marg">General idea of the persecu∣tion,</NOTE> against the Christians, than, as if he had been desirous of committing to other hands the work of persecution, he divested himself of the Impe∣rial

purple. The character and situation of his colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce, and sometimes inclined them to sus∣pend, the execution of these rigorous laws; nor can we acquire a just and distinct idea of this important period of ecclesiastical history, unless we separately consider the state of Christianity, in the different parts of the empire, during the space of ten years, which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian, and the final peace of the church.</P>
<P>The mild and humane temper of Constantius <NOTE PLACE="marg">In the wes∣tern pro∣vinces un∣der Con∣stantius and Con∣stantine;</NOTE> was averse to the oppression of any part of his subjects. The principal offices of his palace were exercised by Christians. He loved their persons, esteemed their fidelity, and entertained not any dislike to their religious principles. But as long as Constantius remained in the subordi∣nate station of Caesar, it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of Diocletian, or to disobey the commands of Maximian. His au∣thority contributed, however, to alleviate the sufferings which he pitied and abhorred. He consented, with reluctance, to the ruin of the churches; but he ventured to protect the Chris∣tians themselves from the fury of the populace, and from the rigour of the laws. The provinces of Gaul (under which we may probably include those of Britain) were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed, to the gentle interposition of their sovereign <NOTE N="165" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. viii. c. 13. Lactantius de M. P. c. 15. Dod∣well (Dissertat. Cyprian. xi. 75.) represents them as inconsistent with each other. But the former evidently speaks of Constantius in the station of Caesar, and the latter of the same prince in the rank of Augustus.</NOTE>. But Datianus,
<PB N="479" REF="494"/>
the president or governor of Spain, actuated either by zeal or policy, chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors, than to understand the secret intentions of Constantius; and it can scarcely be doubted, that his provincial admini∣stration was stained with the blood of a few martyrs <NOTE N="166" PLACE="foot">Datianus is mentioned in Gruter's Inscriptions, as having determined the limits between the territories of Pax Julia, and those of Ebora, both cities in the southern part of Lusitania. If we re∣collect the neighbourhood of those places to Cape St. Vincent, we may suspect that the celebrated deacon and martyr of that name has been inaccurately assigned by Prudentius, &amp;c. to Saragossa, or Va∣lentia. See the pompous history of his sufferings, in the Memoires de Tillemont, tom. v. part ii. p. 58—85. Some critics are of opi∣nion, that the department of Constantius, as Caesar, did not include Spain, which still continued under the immediate jurisdiction of Maximian.</NOTE>. The elevation of Constantius to the supreme and independent dignity of Augustus, gave a free scope to the exercise of his virtues, and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from establishing a system of toleration, of which he left the precept and the example to his son Constantine. His fortunate son, from the first moment of his accession, declaring himself the protector of the church, at length deserved the appellation of the first emperor, who publicly professed and established the Christian religion. The motives of his conversion, as they may variously be deduced from benevolence, from policy, from conviction, or from remorse; and the progress of the revolution, which, under his powerful influence, and that of his sons, rendered
<PB N="480" REF="495"/>
Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire, will form a very interesting and impor∣tant chapter in the third volume of this history. At present it may be sufficient to observe, that every victory of Constantine was productive of some relief or benefit to the church.</P>
<P>The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced <NOTE PLACE="marg">in Italy and Africa, under Maximian and Seve∣rus;</NOTE> a short but violent persecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were strictly and cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian, who had long hated the Christians, and who delighted in acts of blood and violence. In the autumn of the first year of the persecution, the two empe∣rors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph; several oppressive laws appear to have issued from their secret consultations, and the diligence of the magistrates was animated by the presence of their sovereigns. After Diocletian had divested himself of the purple, Italy and Africa were administered under the name of Severus, and were exposed, without defence, to the implacable resentment of his master Galerius. Among the martyrs of Rome, Adauctus deserves the notice of posterity. He was of a noble family in Italy, and had raised himself, through the successive honours of the palace, to the important office of treasurer of the private demesnes. Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only person of rank and distinction who appears to have suf∣fered death, during the whole course of this general persecution <NOTE N="167" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. viii. c. 11.

The revolt of Maxentius immediately restored peace to the churches of Italy and Africa; and the same tyrant who oppressed every other class <NOTE PLACE="marg">under Maxenti∣us;</NOTE> of his subjects, shewed himself just, humane, and even partial, towards the afflicted Christians. He depended on their gratitude and affection, and very naturally presumed, that the injuries which they had suffered, and the dangers which they still apprehended from his most inveterate enemy, would secure the fidelity of a party al∣ready considerable by their numbers and opu∣lence <NOTE N="168" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. viii. c. 14. But as Maxentius was vanquished by Constantine, it suited the purpose of Lactantius to place his death among those of the persecutors.</NOTE>. Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the bishops of Rome and Carthage, may be considered as the proof of his toleration, since it is probable that the most orthodox princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their established clergy. Marcellus, the former of those prelates, had thrown the capital into confusion, by the severe penance which he im∣posed on a great number of Christians, who, during the late persecution, had renounced or dissembled their religion. The rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions; the blood of the faithful was shed by each other's hands, and the exile of Marcellus, whose pru∣dence seems to have been less eminent than his zeal, was found to be the only measure capable of restoring peace to the distracted church of
<PB N="482" REF="497"/>
Rome <NOTE N="169" PLACE="foot">The epitaph of Marcellus is to be found in Gruter, Inscript. p. 1172. No. 3. and it contains all that we know of his history. Marcellinus and Marcellus, whose names follow in the list of popes, are supposed by many critics to be different persons; but the learned Abbé de Longuerre was convinced that they were one and the same.

<P>We may observe that Damasus was made bishop of Rome, A. D. 366.</P></NOTE>. The behaviour of Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, appears to have been still more reprehensible. A deacon of that city had pub∣lished a libel against the emperor. The offender took refuge in the episcopal palace; and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities, the bishop refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice. For this treasonable resistance, Mensurius was sum∣moned to court, and instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or banishment, he was permit∣ted, after a short examination, to return to his diocese <NOTE N="170" PLACE="foot">Optatus contr. Donatist. l. i. c. 17, 18.</NOTE>. Such was the happy condition of the Christian subjects of Maxentius, that whenever they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of martyrs, they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant provinces of the East. A story is related of Aglae, a Ro∣man lady, descended from a consular family, and possessed of so ample an estate, that it required
<PB N="483" REF="498"/>
the management of seventy-three stewards. Among these, Boniface was the favourite of his mistress; and as Aglae mixed love with devo∣tion, it is reported that he was admitted to share her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the East. She intrusted Boniface with a con∣siderable sum of gold, and a large quantity of aromatics; and her lover, attended by twelve horsemen and three covered chariots, undertook a remote pilgrimage, as far as Tarsus in Cilicia <NOTE N="171" PLACE="foot">The Acts of the Passion of St. Boniface, which abound in miracles and declamation, are published by Ruinart (p. 283-291.), both in Greek and Latin, from the authority of very ancient manu∣scripts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sanguinary temper of Galerius, the first <NOTE PLACE="marg">in Illyri∣cum and the East, under Ga∣lerius and Maximi∣an.</NOTE> and principal author of the persecution, was formidable to those Christians, whom their mis∣fortunes had placed within the limits of his do∣minions; and it may fairly be presumed, that many persons of a middle rank, who were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty, very frequently deserted their native country, and sought a refuge in the milder cli∣mate of the West. As long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could with difficulty either find or make a con∣siderable number of martyrs, in a warlike coun∣try, which had entertained the missionaries of the gospel with more coldness and reluctance than any other part of the empire <NOTE N="172" PLACE="foot">During the four first centuries, there exist few traces of either bishops or bishoprics in the western Illyricum. It has been thought probable that the primate of Milan extended his jurisdiction over Sirmium, the capital of that great province. See the Geographia Sacra of Charles de St. Paul, p. 68-76. with the observations of Lucas Holstenius.</NOTE>. But when Ga∣lerius
<PB N="484" REF="499"/>
had obtained the supreme power and the government of the East, he indulged in their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty, not only in the provinces of Thrace, and Asia, which ac∣knowledged his immediate jurisdiction; but in those of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, where Maximin gratified his own inclination, by yield∣ing a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor <NOTE N="173" PLACE="foot">The viiith book of Eusebius, as well as the supplement con∣cerning the martyrs of Palestine, principally relate to the persecution of Galerius and Maximin. The general lamentations with which Lactantius opens the vth book of his Divine Institutions, allude to their cruelty.</NOTE>. The frequent disappoint∣ments of his ambitious views, the experience of six years of persecution, and the salutary reflec∣tions which a lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of Galerius, at length convinced him that the most violent efforts of despotism are insufficient to extirpate a whole people, or to subdue their religious prejudices. Desirous of repairing the mischief that he had occasioned, he published in his own name, and in those of Licinius and Constantine, a general edict, which, after a pompous recital of the Im∣perial titles, proceeded in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Among the important cares which have oc∣cupied <NOTE PLACE="marg">Galerius publishes an edict of toleration.</NOTE> our mind for the utility and preserva∣tion of the empire, it was our intention to correct and re-establish all things according to
<PB N="485" REF="500"/>
the ancient laws and public discipline of the Romans. We were particularly desirous of reclaiming, into the way of reason and nature, the deluded Christians, who had renounced the religion and ceremonies instituted by their fathers; and presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity, had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy, and had collected a various society from the different provinces of our empire. The edicts which we have published to enforce the worship of the gods, having exposed many of the Christians to danger and distress, many having suffered death, and many more, who still persist in their impious folly, being left destitute of <HI>any</HI> public exercise of religion, we are disposed to extend to those unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency. We per∣mit them therefore freely to profess their pri∣vate opinions, and to assemble in their con∣venticles without fear or molestation, provided always that they preserve a due respect to the established laws and government. By another rescript we shall signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates; and we hope that our indulgence will engage the Christians to offer up their prayers to the deity whom they adore, for our safety and prosperity, for their own, and for that of the republic <NOTE N="174" PLACE="foot">Eusebius (l. viii. c. 17.) has given us a Greek version, and Lactantius (de M. P. c. 34.), the Latin original, of this memorable edict. Neither of these writers seems to recollect how directly it contradicts whatever they have just affirmed of the remorse and re∣pentance of Galerius.</NOTE>.</Q> It is not
<PB N="486" REF="501"/>
usually in the language of edicts and manifestos, that we should search for the real character or the secret motives of princes; but as these were the words of a dying emperor, his situation, per∣haps, may be admitted as a pledge of his sin∣cerity.</P>
<P>When Galerius subscribed this edict of tolera∣tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of the church.</NOTE> he was well assured that Licinius would readily comply with the inclinations of his friend and benefactor, and that any measures in favour of the Christians, would obtain the approbation of Constantine. But the emperor would not venture to insert in the preamble the name of Maximin, whose consent was of the greatest im∣portance, and who succeeded a few days after∣wards to the provinces of Asia. In the first six months, however, of his new reign, Maximin affected to adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor; and though he never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict, Sabinus, his Praetorian praefect, addressed a circular letter to all the governors and magistrates of the provinces, expatiating on the Imperial clemency, acknowledging the in∣vincible obstinacy of the Christians, and directing the officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosecutions, and to connive at the secret assem∣blies of those enthusiasts. In consequence of these orders, great numbers of Christians were released from prison, or delivered from the mines. The confessors, singing hymns of triumph, re∣turned into their own countries; and those who had yielded to the violence of the tempest, soli∣cited
<PB N="487" REF="502"/>
with tears of repentance their re-admission into the bosom of the church <NOTE N="175" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, l. ix. c. 1. He inserts the epistle of the praefect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But this treacherous calm was of short dura∣tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximin prepares to renew the persecuti∣on.</NOTE> nor could the Christians of the East place any confidence in the character of their sovereign. Cruelty and superstition were the ruling passions of the soul of Maximin. The former suggested the means, the latter pointed out the objects, of persecution. The emperor was devoted to the worship of the gods, to the study of magic, and to the belief of oracles. The prophets or phi∣losophers, whom he revered as the favourites of heaven, were frequently raised to the govern∣ment of provinces, and admitted into his most secret councils. They easily convinced him, that the Christians had been indebted for their vic∣tories to their regular discipline, and that the weakness of polytheism had principally flowed from a want of union and subordination among the ministers of religion. A system of govern∣ment was therefore instituted, which was evi∣dently copied from the policy of the church. In all the great cities of the empire, the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of Max∣imin; and the officiating priests of the various deities were subjected to the authority of a supe∣rior pontiff, destined to oppose the bishop, and to promote the cause of paganism. These pontiffs acknowledged, in their turn, the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high-priests of the province, who acted as the immediate
<PB N="488" REF="503"/>
vicegerents of the emperor himself. A white robe was the ensign of their dignity; and these new prelates were carefully selected from the most noble and opulent families. By the influ∣ence of the magistrates, and of the sacerdotal order, a great number of dutiful addresses were obtained, particularly from the cities of Nico∣media, Antioch, and Tyre, which artfully repre∣sented the well-known intentions of the court as the general sense of the people; solicited the emperor to consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his clemency; expressed their ab∣horrence of the Christians, and humbly prayed that those impious sectaries might at least be excluded from the limits of their respective ter∣ritories. The answer of Maximin to the address which he obtained from the citizens of Tyre is still extant. He praises their zeal and devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction, descants on the obstinate impiety of the Christians, and be∣trays, by the readiness with which he consents to their banishment, that he considered himself as receiving, rather than as conferring, an obliga∣tion. The priests as well as the magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts, which were engraved on tables of brass; and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effusion of blood, the most cruel and igno∣minious punishments were inflicted on the refrac∣tory Christians <NOTE N="176" PLACE="foot">See Eusebius, l. viii. c. 14. l. ix. c. 2—8.

The Asiatic Christians had every thing to dread from the severity of a bigoted monarch, who prepared his measures of violence with such <NOTE PLACE="marg">End of the persecuti∣ons.</NOTE> deliberate policy. But a few months had scarcely elapsed, before the edicts published by the two western emperors obliged Maximin to suspend the prosecution of his designs: the civil war which he so rashly undertook against Licinius employed all his attention; and the defeat and death of Maximin soon delivered the church from the last and most implacable of her enemies <NOTE N="177" PLACE="foot">A few days before his death, he published a very ample edict of toleration, in which he imputes all the severities which the Chris∣tians suffered to the judges and governors, who had misunderstood his intentions.

<P>In this general view of the persecution, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Probable account of the suffer∣ings of the martyrs and con∣fessors.</NOTE> was first authorized by the edicts of Diocletian, I have purposely refrained from describing the particular sufferings and deaths of the Christian martyrs. It would have been an easy task, from the history of Eusebius, from the declamations of Lactantius, and from the most ancient acts, to collect a long series of horrid and disgustful pic∣tures, and to fill many pages with racks and scourges, with iron hooks, and red hot beds, and with all the variety of tortures which fire and steel, savage beasts and more savage executioners, could inflict on the human body. These melan∣choly scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and miracles destined either to delay the death, to celebrate the triumph, or to discover the relics, of those canonized saints who suffered for the name of Christ. But I cannot determine

what I ought to transcribe, till I am satisfied how much I ought to believe. The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius himself, in∣directly confesses, that he has related whatever might redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace, of religion <NOTE N="178" PLACE="foot">Such is the <HI>fair</HI> deduction from two remarkable passages in Eusebius, l. viii. c. 2. and de Martyr. Palestin. c. 12. The pru∣dence of the historian has exposed his own character to censure and suspicion. It was well known that he himself had been thrown into prison; and it was suggested that he had purchased his deliverance by some dishonourable compliance. The reproach was urged in his life-time, and even in his presence, at the council of Tyre. See Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. viii. part i. p. 67.</NOTE>. Such an acknowledgment will na∣turally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history, has not paid a very strict regard to the observance of the other: and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of Eusebius, which was less tinctured with cre∣dulity, and more practised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his contemporaries. On some particular occasions, when the magis∣trates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest or resentment, when the zeal of the martyrs urged them to forget the rules of pru∣dence, and perhaps of decency, to overturn the altars, to pour out imprecations against the em∣perors, or to strike the judge as he sat on his tribunal, it may be presumed that every mode of torture, which cruelty could invent or constancy could endure, was exhausted on those devoted

victims <NOTE N="179" PLACE="foot">The ancient, and perhaps authentic, account of the sufferings of Tarachus, and his companions (Acta Sincera Ruinart, p. 419—448), is filled with strong expressions of resentment and contempt, which could not fail of irritating the magistrate.

Two circumstances, however, have been unwarily mentioned, which insinuate that the general treatment of the Christians, who had been apprehended by the officers of justice, was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to have been. 1. The confessors who were con∣demned to work in the mines, were permitted, by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers, to build chapels, and freely to profess their religion in the midst of those dreary habita∣tions <NOTE N="180" PLACE="foot">Euseb. de Martyr. Palestin. c. 13.</NOTE>. 2. The bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the Chris∣tians, who voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates. Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts, who blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death. Others were allured by the hope, that a short confinement would expiate the sins of a whole life; and others again were ac∣tuated by the less honourable motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence, and perhaps a considerable profit, from the alms which the charity of the faithful bestowed on the prisoners <NOTE N="181" PLACE="foot">Augustin.

church had triumphed over all her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A convenient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs, whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been renewed, and whose lost members had miraculously been re∣stored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty, and of silencing every objection. The most extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.</P>
<P>The vague descriptions of exile and imprison∣ment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of martyrs.</NOTE> of pain and torture, are so easily exag∣gerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind; the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocle∣tian, his associates, and his successors. The recent legendaries record whole armies and cities, which were at once swept away by the undistin∣guishing rage of persecution. The more ancient writers content themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical invectives, without conderscending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were permitted to

seal with their blood their belief of the gospel. From the history of Eusebius, it may however be collected, that only nine bishops were punished with death; and we are assured, by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine, that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to that honourable appellation <NOTE N="182" PLACE="foot">Eusebius de Martyr. Palestin. c. 13. He closes his narration, by assuring us, that these were the martyrdoms inflicted in Pales∣tine, during the <HI>whole</HI> course of the persecution. The vth chapter of his viiith book, which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt, may seem to contradict our moderate computation; but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the historian. Chusing for the scene of the most exquisite cruelty, the most remote and se∣questered country of the Roman empire, he relates, that in Thebais, from ten to one hundred persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day. But when he proceeds to mention his own jour∣ney into Egypt, his language insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Instead of a large, but definite number, he speaks of many Christians (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>); and most artfully selects two ambiguous words (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), which may signify either what he had seen, or what he had heard; either the expectation, or the execution, of the punishment. Having thus provided a secure evasion, he com∣mits the equivocal passage to his readers and translators; justly con∣ceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the most favour∣able sense. There was perhaps some malice in the remark of Theo∣dorus Metochita, that all who, like Eusebius, had been conversant with the Egyptians, delighted in an obscure and intricate style. (See Valesius ad loc.)</NOTE>. As we are un∣acquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time, it is not in our power to draw any useful inferences from the former of these facts: but the latter may serve to justify a very important and probable conclusion. According to the distribution of Roman provinces, Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire <NOTE N="183" PLACE="foot">When Palestine was divided into three, the praefecture of the East contained forty-eight provinces. As the ancient distinctions ofnations were long since abolished, the Romans distributed the pro∣vinces, according to a general proportion of their extent and opu∣lence.</NOTE>;
<PB N="494" REF="509"/>
and since there were some governors, who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful <NOTE N="184" PLACE="foot">Ut gloriari possint nullum se innocentium peremisse, nam et ipse audivi aliquos gloriantes, quia administratio sua, in hâc parte, fuerit incruenta. Lactant. Institut. Divin. v. 11.</NOTE>, it is reasonable to believe, that the country which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Galerius and Max∣imin; the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between the ten years of the per∣secution, will allow an annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same proportion to the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was either suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire, on whom a ca∣pital punishment was inflicted by a judicial sen∣tence, will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons. Since it cannot be doubted that the Christians were more numerous, and their enemies more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any for∣mer persecution, this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the num∣ber of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose of introdu∣cing Christianity into the world.</P>

We shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind; that even admitting, without hesitation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusi∣on.</NOTE> or enquiry, all that history has recorded, or de∣votion has feigned, on the subject of martyrdoms, it must still be acknowledged, that the Christians, in the course of their intestine dissentions, have inflicted far greater severities on each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the Roman empire in the West, the bishops of the Imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of superstition which they had erected, and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason, was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century, assumed the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud; a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscrip∣tions, wars, massacres, and the institution of the holy office. And as the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as of religious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles the Fifth are said to have suffered by the hand of the execu∣tioner; and this extraordinary number is attested

Edit. fol.</NOTE>, a man of genius and learning, who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contending sects, and who composed the annals of his own age and country, at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of intelligence, and increased the danger of de∣tection. If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotius, it must be allowed, that the number of Protestants, who were exe∣cuted in a single province and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman em∣pire. But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence; if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the Reformers <NOTE N="186" PLACE="foot">Fra-Paolo (Istoria del Concilio Tridentino, l. iii.) reduces the number of Belgic martyrs to 50,000.
