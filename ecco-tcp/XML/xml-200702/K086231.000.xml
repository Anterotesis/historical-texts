<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE thirty years ago, Mr. WILKS (then one of the patentees of the theatre royal) gave an old manuscript play, call'd, <HI>The Guiltless Adultress; or, Judge in his own Cause,</HI> to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, who was then manager of what us'd to be call'd, <HI>the summer company.</HI> This company consisted, in general, of the junior part of the performers; who, during the vacation time, commonly acted twice, or thrice, a week. As they play'd on shares (divided in proportion ac∣cording to their several salaries stipulated in the winter) their endeavours to please the town generally produc'd 'em double pay, on those nights; sometimes more.</P>
<P>This kept most of 'em from strolling into the country, for the summer season: it added to their income, and gave 'em an op∣portunity of getting forward in their business, in a more regular manner, than has been practis'd of late years. It had its effect: performers then try'd their force in characters, in the summer; and became, by practice therein, gradually acquainted with their business, and the town with them. Nor was every one suppos'd to be equal, at their very setting out, to the most capital characters of the drama.</P>
<P>But to return to the play.—By the hand, and the long time it had been in the possession of the managers, it was suppos'd to have been one of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's (formerly a patentee) and, by the opening of the piece, palpably was found∣ed on a play of MASSENGER's, call'd, <HI>The Fatal Dowry—</HI>(this last piece has often been enquired after in vain)—Mr. WILKS recommended it to Mr. CIBBER to be got up in the summer, with some alterations—It lay by some time.—In the year 1733, it was intended for the stage in the summer—But the performers were then shut out of the theatre, by the then patentees of Drury-Lane.—A candid account of which will be given, when Mr. CIBBER has a proper opportunity to speak thereof, in his purpos'd history of the stage.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
In the following year, when the principal comedians of that time return'd from the theatre in the Hay-Market, and play'd under the direction of Mr. FLETEWOOD, it was propos'd agen to have a summer company; as the use of it, both to the actors and managers, had been experienced. Many light pieces were then reviv'd, and several new petit pieces brought on the stage; such as, <HI>The Devil to Pay, The Mock Doctor,</HI> &amp;c. which prov'd afterwards lasting entertainments in the winter season.</P>
<P>'Twas in <HI>The Devil to Pay,</HI> in a summer season, Mrs. CLIVE (then Miss KAFTOR) first surpriz'd a delighted audi∣ence with a proof of her extraordinary genius, in the character of NELL. Her spirited simplicity, and strong natural humour, carried her thro' the part with an astonishing variety, and pro∣priety. She shew'd herself an excellent original.—She has had many followers, some imitators; and, 'tis but justice to add, no equal. She then promis'd to be, what she has since prov'd, one of the first performers of the stage: and, when judi∣ciously examined in the general various cast of parts she acts, 'tis imagined, she will be allow'd not to be inferior to any per∣former of her time.</P>
<P>Well, this is digression on digression—(pardon it, reader, and let it pass)—In 1734, a summer company was agen pro∣pos'd. They play'd once the play of <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> to a very great house. The manager (jealous, least the company shou'd get too much) order'd the farther acting to be stopp'd. It was judg'd, indeed, the jealousy of some actors (who were not concern'd in the summer) gave this advice—so the affair dropp'd—and there has been no summer playing since.</P>
<P>But, to return to our play.—On a revisal, it was judg'd to want some alterations—Accordingly, Mr. CIBBEE requested his kind friend the late Mr. HILL (who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office) to correct it—How much he was taken with the play, will appear on a perusal of some letters of his relative thereto, (pub∣lish'd in his collection) and sent to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, about the year 1746.—Let it suffice here, to add—Mr. HILL almost new wrote the whole; and the last act was entirely his, in conduct, sentiment, diction, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
It was brought on the stage at the theatre in the Hay-Market early this year, 1758—When his Grace the Duke of DEVON∣SHIRE humanely consider'd the unfortunate, extraordinary condition of a comedian (who has had more frequent opportu∣nities of happily entertaining the town) and gave him liberty to try his fortune, awhile, at the little theatre in the Hay-Market.</P>
<P>But what mighty matters could be hop'd, from a young, raw, unexperienced company, hastily collected, and as hastily to be employ'd (but sinking men catch at reeds) while establish'd theatres were open to entertain the town, with the united force of tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime, song, dance, and a long train of <HI>et ceteras—</HI>Some rational, and some other ex∣hibitions, which are so frequently follow'd in a winter season?</P>
<P>Mr. CIBBER was out of pocket by his undertaking; yet this does not prevent his having a grateful sense of the favours he received, from those noble personages, and other friends, who have frequently pratonis'd his undertakings.—To acknow∣ledge a favour, is but gratitude—To name the persons, might appear vanity.</P>
<P>It may not be improper, on this occasion to signify, as Mr. CIBBER has not had the wish'd success at the theatre in the Hay-Market—That Mr. RICH has, with great good-nature, granted the use of his theatre in Covent-Garden to Mr. CIBBER, for his benefit, the beginning of next month—When a <HI>new mock-tragedy,</HI> (which many persons of taste have approv'd of, and which the author has kindly allow'd Mr. CIBBER to make use of on this occasion) will be acted, with all the variety of scenes, machines, songs, dirges, processions, &amp;c. &amp;c.—requisite to embellish (<HI>a-la-moderne</HI>) this extraordinary heroick piece.</P>

<STAGE>Spoke by Mr. CIBBER. (Then in mourning for his father)</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>OUR scenes, to-night, would nature's pangs impart;</L>
<L>True filiel piety should reach the heart.</L>
<L>I feel it now—That thought the tear shall claim;</L>
<L>To merit sacred, and immortal fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sleeps the honour'd dust, which gave me birth;</L>
<L>Recent in death, but newly lodg'd in earth:</L>
<L>Forgive the heart-felt grief! the filial lay!</L>
<L>The public tear might drop o'er CIBBER's clay!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His comic force—for more than half an age;</L>
<L>His well-wrote moral scene, his manly page,</L>
<L>Your fathers fathers pleas'd—His scenes shall live;</L>
<L>And, to your childrens children, equal pleasure give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive the filial dews that thus distil—</L>
<L>'Tis from the heart they flow, and not from skill:</L>
<L>By nature mov'd, your patience thus I try;</L>
<L>Art would but give my suff'ring soul the lie.</L>
<L>Now for the father's sake, the son endure;</L>
<L>Let his paternal worth your smile secure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let his rich merit my poor wants attone;</L>
<L>His high desert I plead—Boast none my own.</L>
<L>Let then this tribute, to the father due;</L>
<L>This public tribute, be approv'd by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whatever faults may thro' this piece be shewn,</L>
<L>No living bard can now those faults attone,</L>
<L>While such you, transient, mark—Let mercy spare,</L>
<L>Such parts as you may think some merit share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where judgment wakes, let candour intervene,</L>
<L>Mark out the failings with that golden mean,</L>
<L>Nor for a single sentence damn a scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To our young actors too your smiles extend;</L>
<L>Youth claims indulgence—as want claims a friend:</L>
<L>Whate'er their flatt'ring hopes, their fears are great,</L>
<L>Which your applause alone can dissipate:</L>
<L>And, 'tis a maxim with the truly brave,</L>
<L>They triumph most, who generously save.</L>

<LG>
<L>POOR (at first op'ning) seems the plot we chuse:</L>
<L>But no felt indigence unfir'd the muse.</L>
<L>Insolvent pris'ner—bears no awful sound!</L>
<L>Yet—hope strong buildings—on that humble ground.</L>
<L>Debtor and creditor th' account begin:</L>
<L>But then comes joy—wife—mis'ry—death and sin!</L>
<L>While, from these varying lights, fierce fires we raise,</L>
<L>Lend but attention—and your tears shall praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few are the public stains, that tinge the fame</L>
<L>Of this brave, rich, good-natur'd nation's name:</L>
<L>Yet, one there is—from time's long license, grown—</L>
<L>That blots out pity—and turns flesh, to stone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis—the deaf rage, that (where hard wants oppress)</L>
<L>Doubles th' insolvent suff'rer's dire distress.</L>
<L>Stung by this wasp, past friendships lose their weight;</L>
<L>Warp'd estimation wears a face like hate:</L>
<L>Suspended mercy bids affliction smart;</L>
<L>And, in a scale of flint, immures her heart.</L>
<L>Self—yet, unreach'd by woe—made proud, by gain,</L>
<L>Blind to disaster—and insulting pain;</L>
<L>In ease, short-sighted—hugs her lot, secure—</L>
<L>And marks no diff'rence—'twixt the base, and poor;</L>
<L>Flings from calamity, turns short on grief,</L>
<L>And, to the prison's grave, refers relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So—for awhile—triumphantly severe!</L>
<L>Tow'rs the bid insult—and disdains to hear.</L>
<L>At last, comes disappointment home—Then, starts</L>
<L>Touch'd sense—and wonders at mens cruel hearts!</L>
<L>Then (self still upmost) the rous'd sleeper shakes;</L>
<L>And insolently hopes—compassion wakes!</L>
<L>But scorn close waits upon the scorner's heel;</L>
<L>And he, that shunn'd to hear—vouchsafes to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too late, he feels!—The Eye, that wakes for all,</L>
<L>Fore-doom'd his anguish—and enjoys his fall;</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
Points, to his trembling view, that wise man's school—</L>
<L>That god-given law—th' all-temp'ring golden rule:</L>
<L>Bids him thank bitterness, for due despair;</L>
<L>And, since he cou'd not pity, learn to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From our last age's plays exemplar aim,</L>
<L>Present and past, we find too much the same:</L>
<L>Stern, unrelenting int'rest's partial will</L>
<L>Reign'd then resistless—and it reigns so still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How happy were th' effect—cou'd miseries, here,</L>
<L>From pride's correction (mourn'd by pity's tear)</L>
<L>Teach the dry rock to melt, in pain-touch'd flow;</L>
<L>And ease th' unhoping crouds, that sigh, in woe!</L>

<L>Admitted the deaf, head-strong, thoughtless lover,</L>
<L>Both to the house and chamber. I advis'd</L>

<L>Can furnish such attacks with fit defences.</L>
<L>Let trusty spouse, when business sends him packing,</L>
<L>("Safe bind safe find") leave no due caution lacking.</L>
</LG>

<L>I see some judge-like eyes, that look too sprightly</L>
<L>To miss a she law-point, put to 'em rightly.</L>
<L>Is mine the court's decree?—I humbly move it;</L>
<L>That, if your hearts affirm—your hands approve it.</L>
