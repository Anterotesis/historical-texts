<LG>
<L>AT its first rise, which all agree on,</L>
<L>This noble Science was CHALDEAN.</L>
<L>That antient people, as they fed</L>
<L>Their flocks upon the Mountain's head,</L>
<L>Gaz'd on the Stars, observ'd their motions,</L>

<L>Each learned Priest, O strange to tell,</L>
<L>Could circles make, and cast a spell,</L>
<L>Could read and write, and taught the Nation</L>
<L>The holy art of Divination.</L>
<L>Nobles themselves, for at that time</L>
<L>Knowledge in Nobles was no crime,</L>
<L>Could talk as learned as the Priest,</L>
