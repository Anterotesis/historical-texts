<L>TO wake the Soul by tender Strokes of Art,</L>
<L>To raise the Genius, and to mend the Heart,</L>
<L>To make Mankind in conscious Virtue bold,</L>
<L>Live o'er each Scene, and Be what they behold:</L>
<L>For this the Tragic-Muse first trod the Stage,</L>
<L>Commanding Tears to stream thro' every Age;</L>
<L>Tyrants no more their Savage Nature kept,</L>
<L>And Foes to Virtue wonder'd how they wept.</L>
<L>Our Author shuns by vulgar Springs to move</L>
<L>The Hero's Glory, or the Virgin's Love;</L>
<L>In pitying Love we but our Weakness show,</L>
<L>And wild Ambition well deserves its Woe.</L>
<L>Here Tears shall slow from a more gen'rous Cause,</L>
<L>Such Tears as Patriots shed for dying Laws:</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
He bids your Breasts with Ancient Ardor rise,</L>
<L>And calls forth <HI>Roman</HI> Drops from <HI>British</HI> Eyes.</L>
<L>Virtue confess'd in human Shape he draws,</L>
<L>What <HI>Plato</HI> Thought, and God-like <HI>Cato</HI> Was:</L>
<L>No common Object to your Sight displays,</L>
<L>But what with Pleasure Heav'n it self surveys;</L>
<L>A brave Man struggling in the Storms of Fate,</L>
<L>And greatly falling with a falling State!</L>
<L>While <HI>Cato</HI> gives his little Senate Laws,</L>
<L>What Bosom beats not in his Country's Cause?</L>
<L>Who sees him act, but envies ev'ry Deed?</L>
<L>Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed?</L>
<L>Ev'n when proud <HI>Caesar</HI> 'midst triumphal Cars,</L>
<L>The Spoils of Nations, and the Pomp of Wars,</L>
<L>Ignobly Vain, and impotently Great,</L>
<L>Show'd <HI>Rome</HI> her <HI>Cato</HI>'s Figure drawn in State;</L>
<L>As her dead Father's rev'rend Image past,</L>
<L>The Pomp was darken'd, and the Day o'ercast,</L>
<L>The Triumph ceas'd—Tears gush'd from ev'ry Eye;</L>
<L>The World's great Victor past unheeded by;</L>
<L>Her Last good Man dejected <HI>Rome</HI> ador'd,</L>
<L>And honour'd <HI>Caesar</HI>'s less than <HI>Cato</HI>'s Sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Britains</HI> attend: Be Worth like this approv'd,</L>
<L>And show you have the Virtue to be mov'd.</L>
<L>With honest Scorn the first fam'd <HI>Cato</HI> view'd</L>
<L><HI>Rome</HI> learning Arts from <HI>Greece,</HI> whom she subdu'd;</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Our Scene precariously subsists too long</L>
<L>On <HI>French</HI> Translation, and <HI>Italian</HI> Song.</L>
<L>Dare to have Sense your selves; Assert the Stage,</L>
<L>Be justly warm'd with your own Native Rage.</L>
<L>Such Plays alone should please a <HI>British</HI> Ear,</L>
<L>As <HI>Cato</HI>'s self had not disdain'd to hear.</L>

<L>Of <HI>Cato</HI> and of <HI>Rome.</HI>—Our Father's Death</L>
<L>Would fill up all the Guilt of Civil War,</L>

Th' Insulting Tyrant prancing o'er the Field</L>
<L>Strow'd with <HI>Rome</HI>'s Citizens, and drench'd in Slaughter,</L>

<L>Oh <HI>Portius,</HI> is there not some chosen Curse,</L>

<L>Believe me, <HI>Marcus,</HI> 'tis an impious Greatness,</L>

<L>Through the dark Cloud of IIIs that cover him,</L>
<L>Break out, and burn with more triumphant Brightness!</L>
<L>His Suff'rings shine, and spread a Glory round him;</L>

<L>That court's the Yoke, and bows the Neck to <HI>Caesar?</HI></L>
<L>Pent up in <HI>Utica</HI> he vainly forms</L>

<L>Of thickest Foes, and rush on certain Death,</L>
<L>Then shalt thou see that <HI>Marcus</HI> is not slow</L>
<L>To follow Glory, and confess his Father.</L>
<L>Love is not to be reason'd down, or lost</L>
<L>In high Ambition, and a Thirst of Greatness;</L>

<L>Thy Father will not act what misbecome's him.</L>

<L>Among thy Father's Friends, see them embarqued;</L>

<L>Alas, I tremble when I think on <HI>Cato,</HI></L>
<L>In every View, in every Thought I tremble!</L>
<L><HI>Cato</HI> is stern, and awful as a God,</L>

I saw him stretcht at Ease, his Fancy lost</L>

<BYLINE>By Dr. <HI>GARTH.</HI></BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. <HI>Porter.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHAT odd fantastick Things we Women do!</L>
<L>Who wou'd not listen when young Lovers woo?</L>
<L>But die a Maid, yet have the Choice of Two!</L>
<L>Ladies are often cruel to their Cost;</L>
<L>To give you Pain, themselves they punish most.</L>
<L>Vows of Virginity shou'd well be weigh'd;</L>
<L>Too oft they're cancell'd, tho' in Convents made.</L>
<L>Wou'd you revenge such rash Resolves—you may:</L>
<L>Be spightful—and believe the thing we say,</L>
<L>We hate you when you're easily said Nay.</L>
<L>How needless, if you knew us, were your Fears?</L>
<L>Let Love have Eyes, and Beauty will have Ears.</L>
<L>Our Hearts are form'd, as you your selves wou'd chuse,</L>
<L>Too proud to ask, too humble to refuse:</L>
<L>We give to Merit, and to Wealth we sell;</L>
<L>He sighs with most Success that settles well.</L>
<L>The Woes of Wedlock with the Joys we mix;</L>
<L>'Tis best repenting in a Coach and six.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blame not our Conduct, since we but pursue</L>
<L>Those lively Lessons we have learn'd from you:</L>
<L>Your Breasts no more the Fire of Beauty warms,</L>
<L>But wicked Wealth usurps the Power of Charms;</L>
<L><PB REF="70"/>
What Pains to get the Gaudy Thing you hate,</L>
<L>To swell in Show, and be a Wretch in State!</L>
<L>At Plays you ogle, at the Ring you bow;</L>
<L>Even Churches are no Sanctuaries now.</L>
<L>There, golden Idols all your Vows receive;</L>
<L>She is no Goddess that has nought to give.</L>
<L>Oh, may once more the happy Age appear,</L>
<L>When Words were artless, and the Thoughts sincere;</L>
<L>When Gold and Grandeur were unenvy'd Things,</L>
<L>And Courts less coveted than Groves and Springs.</L>
<L>Love then shall only mourn when Truth complains,</L>
<L>And Constancy feel Transport in its Chains.</L>
<L>Sighs with Success their own soft Anguish tell,</L>
<L>And Eyes shall utter what the Lips conceal:</L>
<L>Virtue again to its bright Station climb,</L>
<L>And Beauty fear no Enemy but Time.</L>
<L>The Fair shall listen to Desert alone,</L>
<L>And every <HI>Lucia</HI> find a <HI>Cato</HI>'s Son.</L>
