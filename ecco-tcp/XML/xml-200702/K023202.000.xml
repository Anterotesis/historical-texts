<L>THY Forests, <HI>Windsor!</HI> and thy green Retreats,</L>
<L>At once the Monarch's and the Muse's Seats,</L>
<L>Invite my Lays. Be present, Sylvan Maids!</L>

<L>The Groves of <HI>Eden,</HI> vanish'd now so long,</L>
<L>Live in Description, and look green in Song:</L>
<L><HI>These,</HI> were my Breast inspir'd with equal Flame,</L>
<L>Like them in Beauty, should be like in Fame.</L>
<L>Here Hills and Vales, the Woodland and the Plain,</L>
<L>Here Earth and Water seem to strive again,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Chaos</HI>-like together crush'd and bruis'd,</L>
<L>But as the World, harmoniously confus'd:</L>
<L>Where Order in Variety we see,</L>
<L>And where, tho' all things differ, all agree.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Here waving Groves a checquer'd Scene display,</L>
<L>And part admit and part exclude the Day;</L>
<L>As some coy Nymph her Lover's warm Address</L>
<L>Nor quite indulges, nor can quite repress.</L>
<L>There, interspers'd in Lawns and opening Glades,</L>
<L>Thin Trees arise that shun each others Shades.</L>
<L>Here in full Light the russet Plains extend;</L>
<L>There wrapt in Clouds the blueish Hills ascend:</L>
<L>Ev'n the wild Heath displays her Purple Dies,</L>
<L>And' midst the Desart fruitful Fields arise,</L>
<L>That crown'd with tufted Trees and springing Corn,</L>
<L>Like verdant Isles the sable Waste adorn.</L>
<L>Let <HI>India</HI> boast her Plants, nor envy we</L>
<L>The weeping Amber or the balmy Tree,</L>
<L>While by our Oaks the precious Loads are born,</L>
<L>And Realms commanded which those Trees adorn.</L>
<L>Not proud <HI>Olympus</HI> yields a nobler Sight,</L>
<L>Tho' Gods assembled grace his tow'ring Height,</L>
<L>Than what more humble Mountains offer here,</L>
<L>Where, in their Blessings, all those Gods appear.</L>
<L>See <HI>Pan</HI> with Flocks, with Fruits <HI>Pomona</HI> crown'd,</L>
<L>Here blushing <HI>Flora</HI> paints th' enamel'd Ground,</L>
<L>Here <HI>Ceres</HI>' Gifts in waving Prospect stand,</L>
<L>And nodding tempt the joyful Reaper's Hand,</L>
<L>Rich Industry sits smiling on the Plains,</L>
<L>And Peace and Plenty tell, a STUART reigns.</L>

<L>The lonely Lords of empty Wilds and Woods.</L>
<L>Cities laid waste, they storm'd the Dens and Caves</L>
<L>(For wiser Brutes were backward to be Slaves)</L>
<L>What could be free, when lawless Beasts obey'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Elements a Tyrant sway'd?</L>
<L>In vain kind Seasons swell'd the teeming Grain,</L>
<L>Soft Show'rs distill'd, and Suns grew warm in vain;</L>
<L>The Swain with Tears to Beasts his Labour yields,</L>
<L>And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd Fields.</L>
<L>No wonder Savages or Subjects slain</L>
<L>Were equal Crimes in a Despotick Reign;</L>
<L>Both doom'd alike for sportive Tyrants bled,</L>
<L>But Subjects starv'd while Savages were fed.</L>
<L>Proud <HI>Nimrod</HI> first the bloody Chace began,</L>
<L>A mighty Hunter, and his Prey was Man.</L>

The levell'd Towns with Weeds lie cover'd o'er,</L>
<L>The hollow Winds thro' naked Temples roar;</L>
<L>Round broken Columns clasping Ivy twin'd;</L>
<L>O'er Heaps of Ruins stalk'd the stately Hind;</L>
<L>The Fox obscene to gaping Tombs retires,</L>

<L>Lo <HI>Rufus,</HI> tugging at the deadly Dart,</L>
<L>Bleeds in the Forest, like a wounded Hart.</L>
<L>Succeeding Monarchs heard the Subjects Cries,</L>
<L>Nor saw displeas'd the peaceful Cottage rise.</L>
<L>Then gath'ring Flocks on unknown Mountains fed,</L>
<L>O'er sandy Wilds were yellow Harvests spread,</L>
<L>The Forests wonder'd at th' unusual Grain,</L>
<L>And secret Transports touch'd the conscious Swain.</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Liberty, Britannia</HI>'s Goddess, rears</L>
<L>Her chearful Head, and leads the golden Years.</L>

<L>Ye vig'rous Swains! while Youth ferments your Blood,</L>
<L>And purer Spirits swell the sprightly Flood,</L>
<L>Now range the Hills, the thickest Woods beset,</L>
<L>Wind the shrill Horn, or spread the waving Net.</L>
<L>When milder Autumn Summer's Heat succeeds,</L>
<L>And in the new-shorn Field the Partridge feeds,</L>
<L>Before his Lord the ready Spaniel bounds,</L>
<L>Panting with Hope, he tries the furrow'd Grounds,</L>
<L>But when the tainted Gales the Game betray,</L>
<L>Couch'd close he lyes, and meditates the Prey;</L>
<L>Secure they trust th' unfaithful Field, beset,</L>
<L>Till hov'ring o'er 'em sweeps the swelling Net.</L>
<L>Thus (if small Things we may with great compare)</L>
<L>When <HI>Albion</HI> sends her eager Sons to War,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, in the Gen'ral's Sight, the Host lye down</L>
<L>Sudden, before some unsuspecting Town,</L>
<L>The Young, the Old, one Instant makes our Prize,</L>
<L>And high in Air <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Standard flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! from the Brake the whirring Pheasant springs,</L>
<L>And mounts exulting on triumphant Wings;</L>
<L>Short is his Joy! he feels the fiery Wound,</L>
<L>Flutters in Blood, and panting beats the Ground.</L>
<L>Ah! what avail his glossie, varying Dyes,</L>
<L>His Purple Crest, and Scarlet-circled Eyes,</L>

The vivid Green his shining Plumes unfold;</L>
<L>His painted Wings, and Breast that flames with Gold?</L>

<L>And trace the Mazes of the circling Hare.</L>
<L>(Beasts, taught by us, their Fellow Beasts pursue,</L>
<L>And learn of Man each other to undo.)</L>
<L>With slaught'ring Guns th' unweary'd Fowler roves,</L>
<L>When Frosts have whiten'd all the naked Groves;</L>
<L>Where Doves in Flocks the leafless Trees o'ershade,</L>
<L>And lonely Woodcocks haunt the watry Glade.</L>
<L>He lifts the Tube, and levels with his Eye;</L>
<L>Strait a short Thunder breaks the frozen Sky.</L>
<L>Oft, as in Airy Rings they skim the Heath,</L>
<L>The clam'rous Plovers feel the Leaden Death:</L>
<L>Oft as the mounting Larks their Notes prepare,</L>
<L>They fall, and leave their little Lives in Air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In genial Spring, beneath the quiv'ring Shade</L>
<L>Where cooling Vapours breathe along the Mead,</L>
<L>The patient Fisher takes his silent Stand</L>
<L>Intent, his Angle trembling in his Hand;</L>
<L>With Looks unmov'd, he hopes the Scaly Breed,</L>
<L>And eyes the dancing Cork and bending Reed.</L>

<L>Swift Trouts, diversify'd with Crimson Stains,</L>
<L>And Pykes, the Tyrants of the watry Plains.</L>

<L>Now <HI>Cancer</HI> glows with <HI>Phoebus</HI>' fiery Car;</L>
<L>The Youth rush eager to the Sylvan War;</L>
<L>Swarm o'er the Lawns, the Forest Walks surround,</L>
<L>Rowze the fleet Hart, and chear the opening Hound.</L>
<L>Th' impatient Courser pants in ev'ry Vein,</L>
<L>And pawing, seems to beat the distant Plain,</L>
<L>Hills, Vales, and Floods appear already crost,</L>
<L>And ere he starts, a thousand Steps are lost.</L>
<L>See! the bold Youth strain up the threatning Steep,</L>
<L>Rush thro' the Thickets, down the Vallies sweep,</L>
<L>Hang o'er their Coursers Heads with eager Speed,</L>
<L>And Earth rolls back beneath the flying Steed.</L>

<L>Here, as old Bards have sung, <HI>Diana</HI> stray'd</L>
<L>Bath'd in the Springs, or sought the cooling Shade;</L>

And now his Shadow reach'd her as she run,</L>
<L>(His Shadow lengthen'd by the setting Sun)</L>
<L>And now his shorter Breath with sultry Air</L>

<L>In vain on Father <HI>Thames</HI> she calls for Aid,</L>
<L>Nor could <HI>Diana</HI> help her injur'd Maid.</L>
<L>Faint, breathless, thus she pray'd, nor pray'd in vain;</L>
<L>" Ah <HI>Cynthia!</HI> ah—tho' banish'd from thy Train,</L>
<L>" Let me, O let me, to the Shades repair,</L>
<L>" My native Shades—there weep, and murmur there.</L>
<L>She said, and melting as in Tears she lay,</L>
<L>In a soft, silver Stream dissolv'd away.</L>
<L>The silver Stream her Virgin Coldness keeps,</L>

<L>Still bears the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The River <HI>Loddon.</HI></NOTE>Name the hapless Virgin bore,</L>

<L>The headlong Mountains and the downward Skies,</L>
<L>The watry Landskip of the pendant Woods,</L>

<L>Hail Sacred <HI>Peace!</HI> hail long-expected Days,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Thames</HI>'s Glory to the Stars shall raise!</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Tyber</HI>'s Streams immortal <HI>Rome</HI> behold,</L>
<L>Tho' foaming <HI>Hermus</HI> swells with Tydes of Gold,</L>
<L>From Heav'n it self tho' sev'nfold <HI>Nilus</HI> flows,</L>
<L>And Harvests on a hundred Realms bestows;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
These now no more shall be the Muse's Themes,</L>
<L>Lost in my Fame, as in the Sea their Streams.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Volga</HI>'s Banks with Iron Squadrons shine,</L>
<L>And Groves of Lances glitter on the <HI>Rhine,</HI></L>
<L>Let barb'rous <HI>Ganges</HI> arm a servile Train;</L>
<L>Be mine the Blessings of a peaceful Reign.</L>
<L>No more my Sons shall dye with <HI>British</HI> Blood</L>
<L>Red <HI>Iber</HI>'s Sands, or <HI>Ister</HI>'s foaming Flood;</L>
<L>Safe on my Shore each unmolested Swain</L>
<L>Shall tend the Flocks, or reap the bearded Grain;</L>
<L>The shady Empire shall retain no Trace</L>
<L>Of War or Blood, but in the Sylvan Chace,</L>
<L>The Trumpets sleep, while chearful Horns are blown,</L>
<L>And Arms employ'd on Birds and Beasts alone.</L>
<L>Behold! th' ascending <HI>Villa's</HI> on my Side</L>
<L>Project long Shadows o'er the Chrystal Tyde.</L>
<L>Behold! <HI>Augusta</HI>'s glitt'ring Spires increase,</L>
<L>And Temples rise, the beauteous Works of Peace.</L>
<L>I see, I see where two fair Cities bend</L>
<L>Their ample Bow, a new <HI>White-Hall</HI> ascend!</L>
<L>There mighty Nations shall inquire their Doom,</L>
<L>The World's great Oracle in Times to come;</L>
<L>There Kings shall sue, and suppliant States be seen</L>
<L>Once more to bend before a <HI>British</HI> QUEEN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Trees, fair <HI>Windsor!</HI> now shall leave their Woods,</L>
<L>And half thy Forests rush into my Floods,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Bear <HI>Britain</HI>'s Thunder, and her Cross display,</L>
<L>To the bright Regions of the rising Day;</L>
<L>Tempt Icy Seas, where scarce the Waters roll,</L>
<L>Where clearer Flames glow round the frozen Pole;</L>
<L>Or under Southern Skies exalt their Sails,</L>
<L>Led by new Stars, and born by spicy Gales!</L>
<L>For me the Balm shall bleed, and Amber flow,</L>
<L>The Coral redden, and the Ruby glow,</L>
<L>The Pearly Shell its lucid Globe infold,</L>
<L>And <HI>Phoebus</HI> warm the ripening Ore to Gold.</L>
<L>The Time shall come, when free as Seas or Wind</L>
<L>Unbounded <HI>Thames</HI> shall flow for all Mankind,</L>
<L>Whole Nations enter with each swelling Tyde,</L>
<L>And Oceans join whom they did first divide;</L>
<L>Earth's distant Ends our Glory shall behold,</L>
<L>And the new World launch forth to seek the Old.</L>
<L>Then Ships of uncouth Form shall stem the Tyde,</L>
<L>And Feather'd People crowd my wealthy Side,</L>
<L>While naked Youth and painted Chiefs admire</L>
<L>Our Speech, our Colour, and our strange Attire!</L>
<L>Oh stretch thy Reign, fair <HI>Peace!</HI> from Shore to Shore,</L>
<L>Till Conquest cease, and Slav'ry be no more:</L>
<L>Till the freed <HI>Indians</HI> in their native Groves</L>
<L>Reap their own Fruits, and woo their Sable Loves,</L>
<L><HI>Peru</HI> once more a Race of Kings behold,</L>
<L>And other <HI>Mexico's</HI> be roof'd with Gold.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Exil'd by Thee from Earth to deepest Hell,</L>
<L>In Brazen Bonds shall barb'rous <HI>Discord</HI> dwell:</L>
<L>Gigantick <HI>Pride,</HI> pale <HI>Terror,</HI> gloomy <HI>Care,</HI></L>
<L>And mad <HI>Ambition,</HI> shall attend her there.</L>
<L>There purple <HI>Vengeance</HI> bath'd in Gore retires,</L>
<L>Her Weapons blunted, and extinct her Fires:</L>
<L>There hateful <HI>Envy</HI> her own Snakes shall feel,</L>
<L>And <HI>Persecution</HI> mourn her broken Wheel:</L>
<L>There <HI>Faction</HI> roars, <HI>Rebellion</HI> bites her Chain,</L>
<L>And gasping Furies thirst for Blood in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here cease thy Flight, nor with unhallow'd Lays</L>
<L>Touch the fair Fame of <HI>Albion</HI>'s Golden Days.</L>
<L>The Thoughts of Gods let <HI>Granville</HI>'s Verse recite,</L>
<L>And bring the Scenes of opening Fate to Light.</L>
<L>My humble Muse, in unambitious Strains,</L>
<L>Paints the green Forests and the flow'ry Plains,</L>
<L>Where Peace descending bids her Olives spring,</L>
<L>And scatters Blessings from her Dove-like Wing.</L>
<L>Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless Days,</L>
<L>Pleas'd in the silent Shade with empty Praise;</L>
<L>Enough for me, that to the listning Swains</L>
<L>First in these Fields I sung the Sylvan Strains.</L>
