<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor's chief intention in making the following Collection was to bring into one point of view the best pieces which have appeared since the conclusion of Dodsley's collection; and he will venture to affirm, that whatever be the merit of that entertaining miscel∣lany, this does not fall short any ways of it, as some of the volumes in that are made up from the publications of a few years; whereas this contains whatever has been most applauded in a course of twenty. But he has not con∣fined himself to that period only, but inserted many pieces, in his opinion, of great merit, which the inattention of the public, or the obscurity of the publication, had long suffered to remain unnoticed. To these are added many originals by writers of acknowledged merit; among which those of Mr. Mendez, author of the Chaplet, and several admired poems in Dodsley's Miscellany, make no mean figure. Mr. Mendez was reckoned among the most agreeable poets of his time, and, perhaps, he was the only one that was ever worth one hundred thousand pounds.</P>

<HEAD>AN ELEGY, On the DEATH of a LADY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written in 1760.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM MASON, M.A.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE midnight clock has toll'd; and hark, the bell</L>
<L>Of Death beats slow! heard ye the note profound?</L>
<L>It pauses now; and now, with rising knell,</L>
<L>Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound.</L>
<L>Yes *** is dead. Attend the strain,</L>
<L>Daughters of Albion! Ye that, light as air,</L>
<L>So oft have tript in her fantastic train,</L>
<L>With hearts as gay, and faces half as fair:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
For she was fair beyond your brightest bloom:</L>
<L>(This Envy owns, since now her bloom is fled)</L>
<L>Fair as the Forms that, wove in Fancy's loom,</L>
<L>Float in light vision round the Poet's head.</L>
<L>Whene'er with soft serenity she smil'd,</L>
<L>Or caught the orient blush of quick surprize,</L>
<L>How sweetly mutable, how brightly wild,</L>
<L>The liquid lustre darted from her eyes?</L>
<L>Each look, each motion wak'd a new-born grace,</L>
<L>That o'er her form its transient glory cast:</L>
<L>Some lovelier wonder soon usurp'd the place,</L>
<L>Chas'd by a charm still lovelier than the last.</L>
<L>That bell again! It tells us what she is:</L>
<L>On what she was no more the strain prolong:</L>
<L>Luxuriant Fancy pause: an hour like this</L>
<L>Demands the tribute of a serious Song.</L>
<L>MARIA claims it from that sable bier,</L>
<L>Where cold and wan the slumberer rests her head;</L>
<L>In still small whispers to reflection's ear,</L>
<L>She breathes the solemn dictates of the Dead.</L>
<L>O catch the awful notes, and lift them loud;</L>
<L>Proclaim the theme, by Sage, by Fool rever'd;</L>
<L>Hear it, ye Young, ye Vain, ye Great, ye Proud!</L>
<L>'Tis Nature speaks, and Nature will be heard.</L>
<L>Yes, ye shall hear, and tremble as you hear,</L>
<L>While, high with health, your hearts exulting leap:</L>
<L>Ev'n in the midst of pleasure's mad career,</L>
<L>The mental Monitor shall wake and weep.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
For say, than ***'s propitious star,</L>
<L>What brighter planet on your births arose;</L>
<L>Or gave of Fortune's gifts an ampler share,</L>
<L>In life to lavish, or by death to lose!</L>
<L>Early to lose; while, born on busy wing,</L>
<L>Ye sip the nectar of each varying bloom:</L>
<L>Nor fear, while basking in the beams of spring,</L>
<L>The wintry storm that sweeps you to the tomb;</L>
<L>Think of her Fate! revere the heav'nly hand</L>
<L>That led her hence, though soon, by steps so slow;</L>
<L>Long at her couch Death took his patient stand,</L>
<L>And menac'd oft, and oft withheld the blow:</L>
<L>To give Reflection time, with lenient art,</L>
<L>Each fond delusion from her soul to steal;</L>
<L>Teach her from Folly peaceably to part,</L>
<L>And wean her from a world she lov'd so well.</L>
<L>Say, are ye sure his Mercy shall extend</L>
<L>To you so long a span? Alas, ye sigh:</L>
<L>Make then, while yet ye may, your God your friend,</L>
<L>And learn with equal ease to sleep or die!</L>
<L>Nor think the Muse, whose sober voice ye hear,</L>
<L>Contracts with bigot frown her sullen brow;</L>
<L>Casts round Religion's orb the mists of fear,</L>
<L>Or shades with horrors, what with smiles should glow.</L>
<L>No; she would warm you with seraphic fire,</L>
<L>Heirs as ye are of heav'n's eternal day;</L>
<L>Would bid you boldly to that heav'n aspire,</L>
<L>Not sink and slumber in your cells of clay.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Know, ye were form'd to range yon azure field,</L>
<L>In yon aethereal founts of bliss to lave;</L>
<L>Force then, secure in Faith's protecting shield,</L>
<L>The Sting from Death, the Vict'ry from the Grave.</L>
<L>Is this the bigot's rant? Away ye Vain,</L>
<L>Your hopes, your fears in doubt, in dulness steep:</L>
<L>Go sooth your souls in sickness, grief, or pain,</L>
<L>With the sad solace of eternal sleep.</L>
<L>Yet will I praise you, triflers as ye are,</L>
<L>More than those Preachers of your fav'rite creed,</L>
<L>Who proudly swell the brazen throat of War,</L>
<L>Who form the Phalanx, bid the battle bleed;</L>
<L>Nor wish for more: who conquer, but to die.</L>
<L>Hear, Folly, hear; and triumph in the tale:</L>
<L>Like you, they reason; not, like you, enjoy</L>
<L>The breeze of bliss, that fills your silken sail:</L>
<L>On Pleasure's glitt'ring stream ye gayly steer</L>
<L>Your little course to cold oblivion's shore:</L>
<L>They dare the storm, and, through th'inclement year,</L>
<L>Stem the rough surge, and brave the torrent's roar.<NOTE PLACE="foot">NOTE. In a book of <HI>French</HI> verses, entitled <HI>Oeuvres du Philosophe de sans Souci,</HI> and lately reprinted at <HI>Berlin</HI> by authority, under the title of <HI>Poesies Diverses,</HI> may be found an epistle to marshal KEITH, writ∣ten professedly against the immortality of the Soul. By way of specimen of the whole, take the following lines:<Q><L>De l'avenir, cher KEITH, jugeons par le passé;</L>
<L>Comme avant que je fusse il n'avoit point pensé,</L>
<L>De meme, apres ma mort, quand toutes mes parties</L>
<L>Par le corruption seront aneanties,</L>
<L>Par un meme destin il ne pensera plus;</L>
<L>Non, rien n'est plus certain, soyons-en convaincu, &amp;c.</L></Q> It is to this epistle, that the rest of the Elegy alludes.</NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Is it for Glory? that just Fate denies.</L>
<L>Long must the warrior moulder in his shroud,</L>
<L>E'er from her trump the heav'n-breath'd accents rise,</L>
<L>That lift the Hero from the fighting croud.</L>
<L>Is it his grasp of Empire to extend?</L>
<L>To curb the fury of insulting foes?</L>
<L>Ambition, cease: the idle contest end:</L>
<L>'Tis but a Kingdom thou canst win or lose.</L>
<L>And why must murder'd myriads lose their all,</L>
<L>(If Life be all) why desolation lour,</L>
<L>With famish'd frown, on this affrighted ball,</L>
<L>That thou may'st flame the meteor of an hour?</L>
<L>Go wiser ye, that flutter Life away,</L>
<L>Crown with the mantling Juice the goblet high;</L>
<L>Weave the light dance, with festive freedom gay,</L>
<L>And live your moment, since the next ye die.</L>
<L>Yet know, vain Scepticks, know, th'Almighty mind,</L>
<L>Who breath'd on Man a portion of his fire,</L>
<L>Bad his free Soul, by earth nor time confin'd,</L>
<L>To Heav'n, to Immortality aspire.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Nor shall the Pile of Hope, his Mercy rear'd,</L>
<L>By vain Philosophy be e'er destroy'd:</L>
<L>Eternity, by all or wish'd or fear'd,</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">SELIM; OR, THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT.</STAGE>
<STAGE>TIME, THE MORNING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>YE Persian maids, attend your poet's lays,</L>
<L>And hear how shepherds pass their golden days.</L>
<L>Not all are blest, whom fortune's hand sustains</L>
<L>With wealth in courts, nor all that haunt the plains:</L>
<L>Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell;</L>
<L>'Tis virtue makes the bliss, where'er we dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<L>Thus Selim sung, by sacred Truth inspir'd;</L>
<L>Nor praise, but such as Truth bestow'd, desir'd:</L>
<L>Wise in himself, his meaning songs convey'd</L>
<L>Informing morals to the shepherd maid;</L>
<L>Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find,</L>
<L>What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When sweet and blushing, like a virgin bride,</L>
<L>The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride,</L>
<L>When wanton gales along the valleys play,</L>
<L>Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away;</L>
<L>By Tigris' wandering waves he sat, and sung</L>
<L>This useful lesson for the fair and young.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Persian dames, he said, to you belong,</L>
<L>Well may they please, the morals of my song:</L>
<L>No fairer maids, I trust, than you are found,</L>
<L>Grac'd with soft arts, the peopled world around!</L>
<L>The morn that lights you, to your loves supplies</L>
<L>Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes:</L>
<L>For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow,</L>
<L>And yours the love that kings delight to know.</L>
<L>Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are,</L>
<L>The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair!</L>
<L>Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray,</L>
<L>Boast but the worth Bassora's pearls display;</L>
<L>Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright,</L>
<L>But, dark within, they drink no lustrous light:</L>
<L>Such are the maids, and such the charms they boast,</L>
<L>By sense unaided, or to virtue lost.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain</L>
<L>That love shall blind, when once he fires the swain;</L>
<L>Or hope a lover by your faults to win,</L>
<L>As spots on ermin beautify the skin:</L>
<L>Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care</L>
<L>Each softer virtue that adorns the fair;</L>
<L>Each tender passion man delights to find,</L>
<L>The lov'd perfections of a female mind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest were the days, when wisdom held her reign,</L>
<L>And shepherds sought her on the silent plain;</L>
<L>With Truth she wedded in the secret grove,</L>
<L>Immortal Truth, and daughters bless'd their love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O haste, fair maids! ye Virtues come away,</L>
<L>Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way!</L>
<L>The balmy shrub, for you shall love our shore,</L>
<L>By Ind excell'd or Araby no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lost to our fields, for so the fates ordain,</L>
<L>The dear deserters shall return again.</L>
<L>Come thou, whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear,</L>
<L>To lead the train, sweet modesty appear:</L>
<L>Here make thy court amidst our rural scene,</L>
<L>And shepherd girls shall own thee for their queen.</L>
<L>With thee be Chastity, of all afraid,</L>
<L>Distrusting all, a wise suspicious maid;</L>
<L>But man the most—not more the mountain doe</L>
<L>Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe.</L>
<L>Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew;</L>
<L>A silken veil conceals her from the view.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
No wild desires amidst thy train be known,</L>
<L>But Faith, whose heart is fix'd on one alone:</L>
<L>Desponding Meekness, with her down-cast eyes,</L>
<L>And friendly Pity, full of tender sighs;</L>
<L>And love the last: by these your hearts approve,</L>
<L>These are the virtues that must lead to love.</L>
<L>Thus sung the swain; and ancient legends say,</L>
<L>The maids of Bagdat verified the lay:</L>
<L>Dear to the plains, the Virtues came along,</L>
<L>The shepherds lov'd, and Selim bless'd his song.</L>

<STAGE>TIME, MID-DAY.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste</L>
<L>The driver Hassan with his camels past:</L>
<L>One cruise of water on his back he bore,</L>
<L>And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store;</L>
<L>A fan of painted feathers in his hand,</L>
<L>To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.</L>
<L>The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky,</L>
<L>And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh;</L>
<L>The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,</L>
<L>Shrill roar'd the winds, and dreary was the view!</L>
<L>With desperate sorrow wild, th' affrighted man</L>
<L>Thrice sigh'd, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! little thought I of the blasting wind,</L>
<L>The thirst or pinching hunger that I find!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="18"/>
Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall Thirst asswage,</L>
<L>When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage?</L>
<L>Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign;</L>
<L>Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</L>
<L>In all my griefs a more than equal share!</L>
<L>Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,</L>
<L>Or moss-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</L>
<L>Which plains more blest, or verdant vales bestow:</L>
<L>Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are found,</L>
<L>And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Curst be the gold and silver which persuade</L>
<L>Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade!</L>
<L>The lilly peace outshines the silver store,</L>
<L>And life is dearer than the golden ore:</L>
<L>Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown,</L>
<L>To every distant mart and wealthy town.</L>
<L>Full oft we tempt the land, and oft the sea:</L>
<L>And are we only yet repay'd by thee?</L>
<L>Ah! why was ruin so attractive made,</L>
<L>Or why fond man so easily betray'd?</L>
<L>Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,</L>
<L>The gentle voice of peace, or pleasure's song?</L>
<L>Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side,</L>
<L>The mountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="19"/>
Why think we these less pleasing to behold,</L>
<L>Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O cease, my fears!—all frantic as I go,</L>
<L>When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe,</L>
<L>What if the lion in his rage I meet!—</L>
<L>Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when day's declining light</L>
<L>Yields her pale empire to the mourner night,</L>
<L>By hunger rous'd, he scours the groaning plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train:</L>
<L>Before them death with shrieks directs their way,</L>
<L>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.</L>
<L>" Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</L>
<L>" When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep,</L>
<L>If aught of rest I find, upon my sleep:</L>
<L>Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around,</L>
<L>And wake to anguish with a burning wound.</L>
<L>Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor,</L>
<L>From lust of wealth, and dread of death secure!</L>
<L>They tempt no deserts, and no griefs they find;</L>

<L>From early dawn the live-long hours she told,</L>
<L>'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold.</L>
<L>Deep in the grove, beneath the secret shade,</L>
<L>A various wreath of odorous flowers she made:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="22"/>
Gay-motley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose,</L>
<L>The violet blue that on the moss-bank grows;</L>
<L>All-sweet to sense, the flaunting rose was there:</L>
<L>The finish'd chaplet well-adorn'd her hair.</L>

<LG>
<L>Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray,</L>
<L>By love conducted from the chace away;</L>
<L>Among the vocal vales he heard her song,</L>
<L>And sought the vales and echoing groves among:</L>

<L>Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind</L>
<L>To the sweet vale, and flowery mead inclin'd;</L>
<L>And oft as spring renew'd the plains with flowers,</L>

<HEAD>ALBIN and the DAUGHTER of MEY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An old tale, translated from the Irish.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the late Mr. JEROM STONE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHence come these dismal sounds that fill our ears!</L>
<L>Why do the groves such lamentations send!</L>
<L>Why sit the virgins on the hill of tears,</L>
<L>While heavy sighs their tender bosoms rend!</L>
<L>They weep for ALBIN with the flowing hair,</L>
<L>Who perish'd by the cruelty of MEY;</L>
<L>A blameless hero, blooming, young, and fair;</L>
<L>Because he scorn'd her passion to obey.</L>
<L>See on you western hill the heap of stones,</L>
<L>Which mourning friends have raised o'er his bones!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O woman! bloody, bloody was thy deed;</L>
<L>The blackness of thy crime exceeds belief;</L>
<L>The story makes each heart but thine to bleed,</L>
<L>And fills both men and maids with keenest grief!</L>
<L>Behold thy daughter, beauteous as the sky,</L>
<L>When early morn transcends yon eastern hills,</L>
<L>She lov'd the youth who by thy guile did die,</L>
<L>And now our ears with lamentations fills:</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="54"/>
'Tis she, who sad, and grov'ling on the ground,</L>
<L>Weeps o'er his grave, and makes the woods resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A thousand graces did the maid adorn:</L>
<L>Her looks were charming and her heart was kind;</L>
<L>Her eyes were like the windows of the morn,</L>
<L>And Wisdom's habitation was her mind.</L>
<L>A hundred heroes try'd her love to gain:</L>
<L>She pity'd them, yet did their suits deny:</L>
<L>Young ALBIN only courted not in vain,</L>
<L>ALBIN alone was lovely in her eye:</L>
<L>Love fill'd their bosoms with a mutual flame;</L>
<L>Their birth was equal, and their age the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her mother MEY, a woman void of truth,</L>
<L>In practice of deceit and guile grown old,</L>
<L>Conceiv'd a guilty passion for the youth,</L>
<L>And in his ear the shameful story told:</L>
<L>But o'er his mind she never could prevail;</L>
<L>For in his life no wickedness was found;</L>
<L>With shame and rage he heard the horrid tale,</L>
<L>And shook with indignation at the sound:</L>
<L>He fled to shun her; while with burning wrath</L>
<L>The monster, in revenge, decreed his death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amidst Lochmey, at distance from the shore,</L>
<L>On a green island, grew a stately tree,</L>
<L>With precious fruit each season cover'd o'er,</L>
<L>Delightful to the taste, and fair to see:</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="55"/>
This fruit, more sweet than virgin honey found,</L>
<L>Serv'd both alike for physic and for food;</L>
<L>It cur'd diseases, heal'd the bleeding wound,</L>
<L>And hunger's rage for three long days withstood.</L>
<L>But precious things are purchas'd still with pain,</L>
<L>And thousands try'd to pluck it, but in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For at the root of this delightful tree,</L>
<L>A venomous and awful dragon lay,</L>
<L>With watchful eyes, all horrible to see,</L>
<L>Who drove th' affrighted passengers away.</L>
<L>Worse than the viper's sting its teeth did wound,</L>
<L>The wretch who felt it soon behov'd to die;</L>
<L>Nor could physician ever yet be found</L>
<L>Who might a certain antidote apply:</L>
<L>Ev'n they whose skill had sav'd a mighty host,</L>
<L>Against its bite no remedy could boast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Revengeful MEY, her fury to appease,</L>
<L>And him destroy who durst her passion slight,</L>
<L>Feign'd to be stricken with a dire disease,</L>
<L>And call'd the hapless ALBIN to her sight:</L>
<L>" Arise, young hero! skill'd in feats of war,</L>
<L>On yonder lake your dauntless courage prove;</L>
<L>To pull me of the fruit, now bravely dare,</L>
<L>And save the mother of the maid you love.</L>
<L>I die without its influence divine;</L>
<L>Nor will I taste it from a hand but thine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
<L>With downcast-look the lovely youth reply'd,</L>
<L>" Though yet my feats of valour have been few,</L>
<L>My might in this adventure shall be try'd;</L>
<L>I go to pull the healing fruit for you."</L>
<L>With stately steps approaching to the deep,</L>
<L>The hardy hero swims the liquid tide;</L>
<L>With joy he finds the dragon fast asleep,</L>
<L>Then pulls the fruit, and comes in safety back;</L>
<L>Then with a chearful countenance, and gay,</L>
<L>He gives the present to the hands of MEY.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Well have you done, to bring me of this fruit;</L>
<L>But greater signs of prowess must you give:</L>
<L>Go pull the tree entirely by the root,</L>
<L>And bring it hither, or I cease to live."</L>
<L>Though hard the task, like lightning fast he flew,</L>
<L>And nimbly glided o'er the yielding tide;</L>
<L>Then to the tree with manly steps he drew,</L>
<L>And pull'd, and tugg'd it hard, from side to side:</L>
<L>Its bursting roots his strength could not withstand;</L>
<L>He tears it up, and bears it in his hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But long, alas! ere he could reach the shore,</L>
<L>Or fix his footsteps on the solid sand,</L>
<L>The monster follow'd with a hideous roar,</L>
<L>And like a fury grasp'd him by the hand.</L>
<L>Then, gracious God! what dreadful struggling rose!</L>
<L>He grasps the dragon by th' invenom'd jaws,</L>
<L>In vain: for round the bloody current flows,</L>
<L>While its fierce teeth his tender body gnaws.</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="57"/>
He groans through anguish of the grievous wound,</L>
<L>And cries for help; but, ah! no help was found?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the maid, now wond'ring at his stay,</L>
<L>And rack'd with dread of some impending ill,</L>
<L>Swift to the lake, to meet him, bends her way;</L>
<L>And there beheld what might a virgin kill!</L>
<L>She saw her lover struggling on the flood,</L>
<L>The dreadful monster gnawing at his side;</L>
<L>She saw young ALBIN fainting, while his blood</L>
<L>With purple tincture dy'd the liquid tide!</L>
<L>Though pale with fear, she plunges in the wave,</L>
<L>And to the hero's hand a dagger gave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! too late; yet gath'ring all his force,</L>
<L>He drags, at last, his hissing foe to land.</L>
<L>Yet there the battle still grew worse and worse,</L>
<L>And long the conflict lasted on the strand.</L>
<L>At length he happily descry'd a part,</L>
<L>Just where the scaly neck and breast did meet;</L>
<L>Through this he drove a well-directed dart,</L>
<L>And laid the monster breathless at his feet.</L>
<L>The lovers shouted when they saw him dead,</L>
<L>While from his trunk they cut the bleeding head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon the venom of his mortal bite</L>
<L>Within the hero's bosom spreads like flame;</L>
<L>His face grew pale, his strength forsook him quite,</L>
<L>And o'er his trembling limbs a numbness came.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="58"/>
Then fainting on the slimy shore he fell,</L>
<L>And utter'd, with a heavy, dying groan,</L>
<L>These tender words, "My lovely maid, farewel!</L>
<L>Remember ALBIN; for his life is gone!"</L>
<L>These sounds, like thunder, all her sense oppress'd,</L>
<L>And swooning down she fell upon his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last, the maid awak'ning as from sleep,</L>
<L>Felt all her soul o'erwhelm'd in deep despair,</L>
<L>Her eyes star'd wild, she rav'd, she could not weep,</L>
<L>She beat her bosom, and she tore her hair!</L>
<L>She look'd now on the ground, now on the skies,</L>
<L>Now gaz'd around, like one imploring aid:</L>
<L>But none was near in pity to her cries,</L>
<L>No comfort came to sooth the hapless maid!</L>
<L>Then grasping in her palm, that shone like snow,</L>
<L>The youth's dead hand, she thus express'd her wo.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Burst, burst, my heart! the lovely youth is dead,</L>
<L>Who, like the dawn, was wont to bring me joy;</L>
<L>Now birds of prey will hover round his head,</L>
<L>And wild beasts seek his carcase to destroy;</L>
<L>While I who lov'd him, and was lov'd again,</L>
<L>With sighs and lamentable strains must tell,</L>
<L>How by no hero's valour he was slain,</L>
<L>But struggling with a beast inglorious fell!</L>
<L>This makes my tears with double anguish flow,</L>
<L>This adds affliction to my bitter woe!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
<L>Yet fame and dauntless valour he could boast;</L>
<L>With matchless strength his manly limbs were bound;</L>
<L>That force would have dismay'd a mighty host,</L>
<L>He show'd, before the dragon could him wound.</L>
<L>His curling locks, that wanton'd in the breeze,</L>
<L>Were blacker than the raven's ebon wing;</L>
<L>His teeth were whiter than the fragrant trees,</L>
<L>When blossoms clothe them in the days of spring;</L>
<L>A brighter red his glowing cheeks did stain,</L>
<L>Than blood of tender heifer newly slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A purer azure sparkled in his eye,</L>
<L>Than that of icy shoal in mountain found;</L>
<L>Whene'er he spoke, his voice was melody,</L>
<L>And sweeter far than instrumental sound.</L>
<L>O he was lovely! fair as purest snow,</L>
<L>Whose wreaths the tops of highest mountains crown;</L>
<L>His lips were radiant as the heav'nly bow;</L>
<L>His skin was softer than the softest down;</L>
<L>More sweet his breath than fragrant bloom, or rose,</L>
<L>Or gale that cross a flow'ry garden blows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when in battle with our foes he join'd,</L>
<L>And sought the hottest dangers of the fight,</L>
<L>The stoutest chiefs stood wond'ring far behind,</L>
<L>And none durst try to rival him in might!</L>
<L>His ample shield then seem'd a gate of brass,</L>
<L>His awful sword did like the lightning shine!</L>
<L>No force of steel could through his armour pass,</L>
<L>His spear was like a mast, or mountain-pine!</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="60"/>
Ev'n kings and heroes trembled at his name,</L>
<L>And conquest smil'd where-'er the warrior came!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great was the strength of his unconquer'd hand,</L>
<L>Great was his swiftness in the rapid race;</L>
<L>None could the valour of his arm withstand,</L>
<L>None could outstrip him in the days of chace.</L>
<L>Yet he was tender, merciful, and kind;</L>
<L>His vanquish'd foes his clemency confess'd;</L>
<L>No cruel purpose labour'd in his mind,</L>
<L>No thought of envy harbour'd in his breast.</L>
<L>He was all gracious, bounteous, and benign,</L>
<L>And in his soul superior to a king!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now he's gone! and nought remains but wo</L>

<L>Around his tomb my tears shall ever flow,</L>

<L>Ye maids, and matrons, from your hills descend,</L>
<L>To join my moan, and answer tear for tear;</L>
<L>With me the hero to his grave attend,</L>
<L>And sing the songs of mourning round his bier.</L>
<L>Through his own grove his praise we will proclaim,</L>

<HEAD>THE ACTOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADDRESSED TO BONNELL THORNTON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ACTING, dear Thornton, its perfection draws</L>
<L>From no observance of mechanic laws:</L>
<L>No settled maxims of a fav'rite stage,</L>
<L>No rules deliver'd down from age to age,</L>
<L>Let players nicely mark them as they will,</L>
<L>Can e'er entail hereditary skill.</L>
<L>If, 'mongst the humble hearers of the pit,</L>
<L>Some curious vet'ran critic chance to sit,</L>
<L>Is he pleas'd more because 'twas acted so</L>
<L>By Booth and Cibber thirty years ago?</L>
<L>The mind recals an object held more dear,</L>
<L>And hates the copy, that it comes so near.</L>
<L>Why lov'd we Wilks's air, Booth's nervous tone;</L>
<L>In them 'twas natural, 'twas all their own.</L>
<L>A Garrick's genius must our wonder raise,</L>
<L>But gives his mimic no reflected praise.</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="74"/>
Thrice happy Genius, whose unrival'd name</L>
<L>Shall live for ever in the voice of Fame!</L>
<L>'Tis thine to lead, with more than magic skill,</L>
<L>The train of captive passions at thy will;</L>
<L>To bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow</L>
<L>In the sweet sense of sympathetic woe:</L>
<L>Through ev'ry vein I feel a chilness creep,</L>
<L>When horrors such as thine have murder'd sleep;</L>
<L>And at the old man's look and frantic stare</L>
<L>'Tis Lear alarms me, for I see him there.</L>
<L>Nor yet confin'd to tragic walks alone,</L>
<L>The comic muse too claims thee for her own.</L>
<L>With each delightful requisite to please,</L>
<L>Taste, spirit, judgment, elegance, and ease,</L>
<L>Familiar nature forms thy only rule,</L>
<L>From Ranger's rake to Drugger's vacant fool.</L>
<L>With powers so pliant, and so various blest,</L>
<L>That what we see the last, we like the best.</L>
<L>Not idly pleas'd, at judgment's dear expence,</L>
<L>But burst outrageous with the laugh of sense:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perfection's top, with weary toil and pain,</L>
<L>'Tis genius only that can hope to gain.</L>
<L>The play'r's profession (tho' I hate the phrase,</L>
<L>'Tis so mechanie in these modern days)</L>
<L>Lies not in trick, or attitude, or start,</L>
<L>Nature's true knowledge is his only art.</L>
<L>The strong-felt passion bolts into the face,</L>
<L>The mind untouch'd, what is it but grimace?</L>
<L>To this one standard make your just appeal,</L>
<L>Here lies the golden secret; learn to FEEL.</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="75"/>
Or fool, or monarch, happy, or distrest,</L>
<L>No actor pleases that is not possess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once on the stage, in Rome's declining days,</L>
<L>When Christians were the subject of their plays,</L>
<L>E'er persecution dropp'd her iron rod,</L>
<L>And men still wag'd an impious war with God,</L>
<L>An actor flourish'd of no vulgar fame,</L>
<L>Nature's disciple, and Genest his name.</L>
<L>A noble object for his skill he chose,</L>
<L>A martyr dying 'midst insulting foes;</L>
<L>Resign'd with patience to religion's laws,</L>
<L>Yet braving monarchs in his Saviour's cause.</L>
<L>Fill'd with th' idea of the secret part,</L>
<L>He felt a zeal beyond the reach of art,</L>
<L>While look and voice, and gesture, all exprest</L>
<L>A kindred ardour in the player's breast;</L>
<L>Till as the flame thro' all his bosom ran,</L>
<L>He lost the actor, and commenc'd the man:</L>
<L>Profest the faith, his pagan gods denied,</L>
<L>And what he acted then, he after died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The player's province they but vainly try,</L>
<L>Who want these pow'rs, deportment, voice, and eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The critic sight 'tis only grace can please,</L>
<L>No figure charms us if it has not ease.</L>
<L>There are, who think the stature all in all,</L>
<L>Nor like the hero, if he is not tall.</L>
<L>The feeling sense all other want supplies,</L>
<L>I rate no actor's merit from his size.</L>
<L>Superior height requires superior grace,</L>
<L>And what's a giant with a vacant face?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
<L>Theatric monarchs, in their tragic gait,</L>
<L>Affect to mark the solemn pace of state.</L>
<L>One foot put forward in position strong,</L>
<L>The other, like its vassal, dragg'd along.</L>
<L>So grave each motion, so exact and slow,</L>
<L>Like wooden monarchs at a puppet-show.</L>
<L>The mien delights us that has native grace,</L>
<L>But affectation ill supplies its place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unskilful actors, like your mimic apes,</L>
<L>Will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes;</L>
<L>However foreign from the poet's art,</L>
<L>No tragic hero but admires a start.</L>
<L>What though unfeeling of the nervous line;</L>
<L>Who but allows his attitude is fine?</L>
<L>While a whole minute equipois'd he stands,</L>
<L>Till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands!</L>
<L>Resolv'd, though nature hate the tedious pause,</L>
<L>By perseverance to extort applause.</L>
<L>When Romeo sorrowing at his Juliet's doom,</L>
<L>With eager madness bursts the canvas tomb,</L>
<L>The sudden whirl, stretch'd leg, and lifted staff,</L>
<L>Which please the vulgar, make the critic laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To paint the passion's force, and mark it well,</L>
<L>The proper action nature's self will tell:</L>
<L>No pleasing pow'rs distortions e'er express,</L>
<L>And nicer judgment always loaths excess.</L>
<L>In sock or buskin, who o'erleaps the bounds,</L>
<L>Disgusts our reason, and the taste confounds.</L>
<L>Of all the evils which the stage molest,</L>
<L>I hate your fool who overacts his jest:</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="77"/>
Who murders what the poet finely writ,</L>
<L>And, like a bungler, haggles all his wit,</L>
<L>With shrug, and grin, and gesture out of place,</L>
<L>And writes a foolish comment with his face.</L>
<L>Old Johnson once, tho' Cibber's perter vein</L>
<L>But meanly groupes him with a num'rous train,</L>
<L>With steady face, and sober hum'rous mien,</L>
<L>Fill'd the strong outlines of the comic scene.</L>
<L>What was writ down, with decent utt'rance spoke,</L>
<L>Betray'd no symptom of the conscious joke;</L>
<L>The very man in look, in voice, in air,</L>
<L>And tho' upon the stage, appear'd no play'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The word and action should conjointly suit,</L>
<L>But acting words is labour too minute.</L>
<L>Grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong;</L>
<L>While sober humour marks th' impression strong.</L>
<L>Her proper traits the fixt attention hit,</L>
<L>And bring me closer to the poet's wit;</L>
<L>With her delighted o'er each scene I go,</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd, and not asham'd of being so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let the generous actor still forbear</L>
<L>To copy features with a mimic's care!</L>
<L>'Tis a poor skill, which ev'ry fool can reach,</L>
<L>A vile stage-custom, honour'd in the breach.</L>
<L>Worse as more close, the disingenuous art</L>
<L>But shews the wanton looseness of the heart.</L>
<L>When I behold a wretch, of talents mean,</L>
<L>Drag private foibles on the public scene,</L>
<L>Forsaking nature's fair and open road</L>
<L>To mark some whim, some strange peculiar mode,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="78"/>
Fir'd with disgust, I loath his servile plan,</L>
<L>Despise the mimic, and abhor the man.</L>
<L>Go to the lame, to hospitals repair,</L>
<L>And hunt for humour in distortions there!</L>
<L>Fill up the measure of the motley whim</L>
<L>With shrug, wink, snuffle, and convulsive limb;</L>
<L>Then shame at once, to please a trifling age,</L>
<L>Good sense, good manners, virtue, and the stage!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis not enough the voice be sound and clear,</L>
<L>'Tis modulation that must charm the ear.</L>
<L>When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan,</L>
<L>And whine their sorrows in a see-saw tone,</L>
<L>The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes</L>
<L>Can only make the yawning hearers doze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The voice all modes of passion can express,</L>
<L>That marks the proper word with proper stress.</L>
<L>But none emphatic can that actor call,</L>
<L>Who lays an equal emphasis on all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some o'er the tongue the labour'd measures roll</L>
<L>Slow and delib'rate as the parting toll,</L>
<L>Point ev'ry stop, mark ev'ry pause so strong,</L>
<L>Their words, like stage-processions, stalk along.</L>
<L>All affectation but creates disgust,</L>
<L>And e'en in speaking we may seem too just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor proper, Thornton, can those sounds appear</L>
<L>Which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear:</L>
<L>In vain for them the pleasing measure flows,</L>
<L>Whose recitation runs it all to prose;</L>
<L>Repeating what the poet sets not down,</L>
<L>The verb disjointing from its friendly noun,</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="79"/>
While pause, and break, and repetition join</L>
<L>To make a discord in each tuneful line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some placid natures fill th' allotted scene</L>
<L>With lifeless drone, insipid and serene;</L>
<L>While others thunder ev'ry couplet o'er,</L>
<L>And almost crack your ears with rant and roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>More nature oft and finer strokes are shown,</L>
<L>In the low whisper than tempestuous tone.</L>
<L>And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixt amaze,</L>
<L>More powerful terror to the mind conveys,</L>
<L>Than he, who swol'n with big impetuous rage,</L>
<L>Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, who in earnest studies o'er his part,</L>
<L>Will find true nature cling about his heart.</L>
<L>The modes of grief are not included all</L>
<L>In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl;</L>
<L>A single look more marks th' internal woe,</L>
<L>Than all the windings of the lengthen'd oh.</L>
<L>Up to the face the quick sensation flies,</L>
<L>And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes!</L>
<L>Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair,</L>
<L>And all the passions, all the soul is there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain Ophelia gives her flowrets round,</L>
<L>And with her straws fantastic strews the ground,</L>
<L>In vain now sings, now heaves the desp'rate sigh,</L>
<L>If phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye.</L>
<L>In Cibber's look commanding sorrows speak,</L>
<L>And call the tear fast trickling down my cheek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There is a fault which stirs the critic's rage;</L>
<L>A want of due attention on the stage.</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="80"/>
I have seen actors, and admir'd ones too,</L>
<L>Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue;</L>
<L>In their own speech who whine, or roar away,</L>
<L>Yet seem unmov'd at what the rest may say;</L>
<L>Whose eyes and thoughts on diff'rent objects roam,</L>
<L>Until the prompter's voice recal them home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Divest yourself of hearers, if you can,</L>
<L>And strive to speak, and be the very man.</L>
<L>Why should the well-bred actor wish to know</L>
<L>Who fits above to-night, or who below?</L>
<L>So, 'mid th' harmonious tones of grief or rage,</L>
<L>Italian squallers oft disgrace the stage;</L>
<L>When, with a simp'ring leer, and bow profound,</L>
<L>The squeaking Cyrus greets the boxes round;</L>
<L>Or proud Mandane, of imperial race,</L>
<L>Familiar drops a curt'sie to her grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To suit the dress demands the actor's art,</L>
<L>Yet there are those who over-dress the part.</L>
<L>To some prescriptive right gives settled things,</L>
<L>Black wigs to murd'rers, feather'd hats to kings:</L>
<L>But Michael Cassio might be drunk enough,</L>
<L>Tho' all his features were not grim'd with snuff.</L>
<L>Why shou'd Pol Peachum shine in satin cloaths?</L>
<L>Why ev'ry devil dance in scarlet hose?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But in stage-customs what offends me most</L>
<L>Is the slip-door, and slowly-rising ghost.</L>
<L>Tell me, nor count the question too severe,</L>
<L>Why need the dismal powder'd forms appear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When chilling horrors shake th' affrighted king,</L>
<L>And guilt torments him with her scorpion sting;</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="81"/>
When keenest feelings at his bosom pull,</L>
<L>And fancy tells him that the seat is full;</L>
<L>Why need the ghost usurp the monarch's place,</L>
<L>To frighten children with his mealy face?</L>
<L>The king alone shou'd form the phantom there,</L>
<L>And talk and tremble at the vacant chair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Belvidera her lov'd loss deplore,</L>
<L>Why for twin spectres bursts the yawning floor?</L>
<L>When with disorder'd starts, and horrid cries,</L>
<L>She paints the murder'd forms before her eyes,</L>
<L>And still pursues them with a frantic stare,</L>
<L>'Tis pregnant madness brings the visions there.</L>
<L>More instant horror would enforce the scene,</L>
<L>If all her shudd'rings were at shapes unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poet and actor thus, with blended skill,</L>
<L>Mould all our passions to their instant will;</L>
<L>'Tis thus, when feeling Garrick treads the stage,</L>
<L>(The speaking comment of his Shakespear's page)</L>
<L>Oft as I drink the words with greedy ears,</L>
<L>I shake with horror, or dissolve with tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, ne'er may folly seize the throne of taste,</L>
<L>Nor dulness lay the realms of genius waste!</L>
<L>No bouncing crackers ape the thund'rer's fire,</L>
<L>No tumbler float upon the bending wire!</L>
<L>More natural uses to the stage belong,</L>
<L>Than tumblers, monsters, pantomime, or song.</L>
<L>For other purpose was that spot design'd:</L>
<L>To purge the passions, and reform the mind,</L>
<L>To give to nature all the force of art,</L>
<L>And while it charms the ear to mend the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
<L>Thornton, to thee, I dare with truth commend,</L>
<L>The decent stage as virtue's natural friend.</L>
<L>Tho' oft debas'd with scenes profane and loose,</L>
<L>No reason weighs against it's proper use.</L>
<L>Tho' the lewd priest his sacred function shame,</L>
<L>Religion's perfect law is still the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall they, who trace the passions from their rise,</L>
<L>Shew scorn her features, her own image vice?</L>
<L>Who teach the mind it's proper force to scan,</L>
<L>And hold the faithful mirror up to man,</L>
<L>Shall their profession e'er provoke disdain,</L>
<L>Who stand the foremost in the mortal train,</L>
<L>Who lend reflection all the grace of art,</L>
<L>And strike the precept home upon the heart?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, hapless artist! tho' thy skill can raise</L>
<L>The bursting peal of universal praise,</L>
<L>Tho' at thy beck applause delighted stands,</L>
<L>And lifts, Briareus' like, her hundred hands,</L>
<L>Know, fame awards thee but a partial breath!</L>
<L>Not all thy talents brave the stroke of death.</L>
<L>Poets to ages yet unborn appeal,</L>
<L>And latest times th' eternal nature feel.</L>
<L>Tho' blended here the praise of bard and play'r,</L>
<L>While more than half becomes the actor's share,</L>
<L>Relentless death untwists the mingled fame,</L>
<L>And sinks the player in the poet's name.</L>
<L>The pliant muscles of the various face,</L>
<L>The mien that gave each sentence strength and grace,</L>
<L>The tuneful voice, the eye that spoke the mind,</L>
<L>Are gone, nor leave a single trace behind.</L>

<P><HI>N.B.</HI> In a comedy of FLETCHER, called <HI>The Knight of the burning Pefile,</HI> old MERRY THOUGHT enters repeating the fol∣lowing verses:<Q><L>When it was grown to dark midnight,</L>
<L>And all were fast asleep,</L>
<L>In came MARGARET's grimly ghost,</L>
<L>And stood at WILLIAM's feet.</L></Q> This was, probably, the beginning of some ballad, commonly known, at the time when that author wrote; and is all of it, I be∣lieve, that is any where to be met with. These lines, naked of or∣nament and simple as they are, struck my fancy: and, bringing fresh into my mind an unhappy adventure, much talked of formerly, gave birth to the foregoing poem; which was written many years ago.</P>

<L>FAIR morn ascends: soft zephir's wing</L>

<L>A mountain fades into the sky;</L>
<L>While winding round, diffus'd and deep,</L>

<L>The turbulence of hopes and fears,</L>
<L>The storm of fate, the cloud of years,</L>

<L>Reposes late in Death's calm night:</L>
<L>Fled from the trophy'd roofs of state,</L>
<L>Abodes of splendid pain, and hate;</L>
<L>Fled from the couch, where, in sweet sleep,</L>

<L>In silence feasting ear and eye,</L>

<L>But when the sun, with noontide ray,</L>
<L>Flames forth intolerable day;</L>
<L>While Heat sits fervent on the plain,</L>
<L>With Thirst and Languor in his train;</L>
<L>All nature sickening in the blaze:</L>
<L>Thou, in the wild and woody maze.</L>

<L>There, plung'd amid the shadows brown,</L>

<L>Attentive, in his airy mood,</L>

<L>The chidings of the headlong brook;</L>
<L>The green leaf shivering in the gale;</L>
<L>The warbling hill, the lowing vale;</L>
<L>The distant woodman's echoing stroke;</L>
<L>The thunder of the falling oak.</L>
<L>From thought to thought in vision led,</L>

<L>Sages, or Poets. See they rise!</L>
<L>And shadowy skim before his eyes.</L>

<L>While thus I mus'd beneath the shade,</L>

Dumb silence grew upon the hour;</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A certain young lady was surprized, on horse-back, by a violent storm of wind and rain from the SOUTH-WEST; which made her dismount, somewhat precipitately.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THE God, in whose gay train appear</L>
<L>Those gales that wake the purple year;</L>
<L>Who lights up health and bloom and grace</L>
<L>In NATURE's, and in MIRA's face;</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="91"/>
To speak more plain, the western wind,</L>
<L>Had seen this brightest of her kind:</L>
<L>Had seen her oft with fresh surprize!</L>
<L>And ever with desiring eyes!</L>
<L>Much, by her shape, her look, her air,</L>
<L>Distinguish'd from the vulgar fair;</L>
<L>More, by the meaning soul that shines</L>
<L>Thro' all her charms, and all refines.</L>
<L>Born to command, yet turn'd to please,</L>
<L>Her form is dignity, with ease:</L>
<L>Then—such a hand, and such an arm,</L>
<L>As age or impotence might warm!</L>
<L>Just such a leg too, ZEPHIR knows,</L>
<L>The Medicéan VENUS shows!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So far he sees; so far admires.</L>
<L>Each charm is fewel to his fires:</L>
<L>But other charms, and those of price,</L>
<L>That form the bounds of PARADISE,</L>
<L>Can those an equal praise command;</L>
<L>All turn'd by Nature's finest hand?</L>
<L>Is all the consecrated ground</L>
<L>With plumpness, firm, with smoothness, round?</L>
<L>The world, but once, one ZEUXIS saw,</L>
<L>A faultless form who dar'd to draw:</L>
<L>And then, that all might perfect be,</L>
<L>All rounded off in due degree,</L>
<L>To furnish out the matchless piece,</L>
<L>Were rifled half the toasts of GREECE.</L>
<L>'Twas PITT's white neck, 'twas DELIA's thigh;</L>
<L>'Twas WALDEGRAVE's sweetly-brilliant eye;</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="92"/>
'Twas gentle PEMBROKE's ease and grace,</L>
<L>And HERVEY lent her maiden-face.</L>
<L>But dares he hope, on BRITISH ground,</L>
<L>That these may all, in one, be found?</L>
<L>These chiefly that still shun his eye?</L>
<L>He knows not; but he means to try.</L>
<L>AURORA rising, fresh and gay,</L>
<L>Gave promise of a golden day,</L>
<L>Up, with her sister, MIRA rose,</L>
<L>Four hours before our London beaus;</L>
<L>For these are still asleep and dead,</L>
<L>Save ARTHUR's sons—not yet in bed.</L>
<L>A rose, impearl'd with orient dew,</L>
<L>Had caught the passing fair one's view;</L>
<L>To pluck the bud he saw her stoop,</L>
<L>And try'd, behind, to heave her hoop:</L>
<L>Then, while across the daisy'd lawn</L>
<L>She turn'd, to feed her milk-white fawn,</L>
<L>Due westward as her steps she bore,</L>
<L>Would swell her petticoat, before;</L>
<L>Would subtley steal his face between,</L>
<L>To see—what never yet was seen!</L>
<L>" And sure, to fan it with his wing,</L>
<L>No nine-month symptom e'er can bring:</L>
<L>His aim is but the nymph to please,</L>
<L>Who daily courts his cooling breeze."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But listen, fond believing maid:</L>
<L>When Love, soft traitor, would persuade,</L>
<L>With all the moving skill and grace</L>
<L>Of practic'd passion in his face,</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="93"/>
Dread his approach, distrust your power—</L>
<L>For oh! there is one shepherd's hour:</L>
<L>And tho' he long, his aim to cover,</L>
<L>May, with the friend, disguise the lover,</L>
<L>The sense, or nonsense, of his wooing</L>
<L>Will but adore you into ruin.</L>
<L>But, for those butterflies, the beaus,</L>
<L>Who buzz around in tinsel-rows,</L>
<L>Shake, shake them off, with quick disdain:</L>
<L>Where insects settle, they will stain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, ZEPHIR oft the nymph assail'd,</L>
<L>As oft his little arts had fail'd:</L>
<L>The folds of silk, the ribs of whale,</L>
<L>Resisted still his feeble gale.</L>
<L>With these repulses vex'd at heart,</L>
<L>Poor ZEPHIR has recourse to art:</L>
<L>And his own weakness to supply,</L>
<L>Calls in a brother of the sky,</L>
<L>The rude South-West; whose mildest play</L>
<L>Is war, mere war, the Russian way:</L>
<L>A tempest-maker by his trade,</L>
<L>Who knows to ravish, not persuade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The terms of their aëreal league,</L>
<L>How first to harrass and fatigue,</L>
<L>Then, found on some remoter plain,</L>
<L>To ply her close with wind and rain;</L>
<L>These terms, writ fair and seal'd and sign'd</L>
<L>Should WEB or STUKELY wish to find,</L>

<HEAD>A PRAYER FOR INDIFFERENCE.</HEAD>

<L>OFT I've implor'd the Gods in vain,</L>
<L>And pray'd till I've been weary;</L>
<L>For once I'll try my wish to gain</L>
<L>Of Oberon the fairy.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
<L>Sweet airy being, wanton sprite,</L>
<L>That lurk'st in woods unseen;</L>
<L>And oft by Cynthia's silver light</L>
<L>Tripst gaily o'er the green!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If e'er thy pitying heart was mov'd,</L>
<L>As ancient stories tell,</L>
<L>And for th' Athenian maid, who lov'd,</L>
<L>Thou sought'st a wondrous spell;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! deign once more t' exert thy power;</L>
<L>Haply some herb or tree,</L>
<L>Sov'reign as juice of western flower,</L>
<L>Conceals a balm for me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I ask no kind return of love,</L>
<L>No tempting charm to please:</L>
<L>Far from the heart those gifts remove,</L>
<L>That sighs for peace and ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor peace nor ease the heart can know,</L>
<L>Which, like the needle true,</L>
<L>Turns at the touch of joy or woe,</L>
<L>But, turning, trembles too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far as distress the soul can wound,</L>
<L>'Tis pain in each degree:</L>
<L>'Tis bliss but to a certain bound;</L>
<L>Beyond is agony.</L>

<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
<L>Take then this treacherous sense of mine,</L>
<L>Which dooms me still to smart;</L>
<L>Which pleasure can to pain refine,</L>
<L>To pain new pangs impart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, haste to shed the sacred balm!</L>
<L>My shatter'd nerves new-string;</L>
<L>And for my guest, serenely calm,</L>
<L>The nymph, Indifference bring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At her approach, see Hope, see Fear,</L>
<L>See Expectation fly;</L>
<L>And Disappointment in the rear,</L>
<L>That blasts the promis'd joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tear, which pity taught to flow,</L>
<L>The eye shall then disown:</L>
<L>The heart that melts for other's woe,</L>
<L>Shall then scarce feel its own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wounds which now each moment bleed,</L>
<L>Each moment then shall close,</L>
<L>And tranquil days shall still succeed</L>
<L>To nights of calm repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, fairy elf! but grant me this,</L>
<L>This one kind comfort send;</L>
<L>And so may never-fading bliss</L>
<L>Thy flow'ry paths attend!</L>
</LG>

<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
<L>So may the glow-worm's glimm'ring light</L>
<L>Thy tiny footsteps lead</L>
<L>To some new region of delight,</L>

<LG>
<L>And be thy acorn goblet fill'd</L>
<L>With heav'ns ambrosial dew;</L>
<L>From sweetest, freshest flow'rs distill'd,</L>

<L>He made the glorious choice:</L>
<L>Severe, indeed, th' attempt he knew,</L>
<L>Youth's genial ardors to subdue:</L>
<L>For Pleasure Cytherea's form assum'd,</L>
<L>Her glowing charms divinely bright,</L>

<L>While deepening blushes soon confest</L>
<L>The alternate passions in his breast.</L>
<L>Her lips of coral hue,</L>
<L>Young Spring embalm'd with nectar-dew:</L>
<L>That swelling bosom half-reveal'd,</L>
<L>Those eyes that sparkle heavenly light,</L>
<L>His breast with tender tumults fill'd,</L>
<L>And wak'd his soul to soft delight.</L>
<L>Her limbs, that amorous silks enfold,</L>
<L>Were cast in nature's finest mould;</L>
<L>Persuasion's sweetest language hung</L>
<L>In melting accents on her tongue:</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="108"/>
Deep in his heart, th' inchanting tale</L>
<L>Imprest her pleasing power,</L>
<L>She points along the daisied vale,</L>
<L>And shews th' Elysian bower:</L>
<L>Her hand, that trembling ardors move,</L>
<L>Conducts him blushing to the blest alcove,</L>
<L>That sweet recess of dying love!</L>
<L>Ah! see o'erpower'd by beauty's arms,</L>
<L>And won by love's resistless charms,</L>
<L>The captive youth obeys the strong alarms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And will no guardian power above</L>
<L>From ruin save the son of Jove?</L>
<L>Ah! shall that soft delicious chain</L>
<L>The godlike victim thus enslave;</L>
<L>Kind heaven his sinking soul sustain,</L>
<L>And from perdition snatch the brave!—</L>
<L>By heavenly mandate Virtue came,</L>
<L>To wake the slumbering sparks of fame,</L>
<L>To kindle and arouse the dying flame.</L>
<L>Swift as the quivering needle wheels,</L>
<L>Whose point the magnet's influence feels;</L>
<L>Imprest with filial awe,</L>
<L>The wondering hero saw</L>
<L>Her form transcendent shine</L>
<L>With majesty divine;</L>
<L>And while he view'd the holy maid,</L>
<L>His heart a sacred impulse sway'd:</L>
<L>His eyes with eager tumult roll,</L>
<L>As on each rival-nymph they bend,</L>
<L>Whilst love, regret, and hope divide his soul</L>
<L>By turns, and with conflicting anguish rend.</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="109"/>
But soon he felt fair Virtue's voice compose</L>
<L>The painful struggle of intestine woes:</L>
<L>He felt her balm each pang destroy:</L>
<L>And all the numbers of his heart,</L>
<L>Retun'd by her celestial art,</L>
<L>Now swell'd to strains of nobler joy.</L>
<L>Thus tutor'd by her magic lore,</L>
<L>His happy steps the realms explore,</L>
<L>Where guilt and error are no more:</L>
<L>The clouds that veil'd his intellectual ray,</L>
<L>Before her breath dispelling, melt away.</L>
<L>Broke loose from Pleasure's glittering chain,</L>

<L>Convinc'd, resolv'd, to Virtue then he turn'd,</L>
<L>And in his breast paternal glory burn'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>So when on Britain's other hope she shone,</L>
<L>Like him the royal youth she won:</L>

<L>The lowliest vot'ry of the tuneful Nine,</L>

<L>OH! form'd by nature, and refin'd by art,</L>
<L>With charms to win, and sense to fix the heart!</L>
<L>By thousands sought, Clotilda, can'st thou free</L>
<L>Thy crowd of captives, and descend to me?</L>
<L>Content in shades obscure to waste thy life,</L>
<L>A hidden beauty, and a country-wife.</L>

<L>In some small hamlet on the lonely plain,</L>
<L>Where Thames, thro' meadows, rolls his mazy train;</L>
<L>Or where high Windsor, thick with greens array'd,</L>
<L>Waves his old oaks, and spreads his ample shade,</L>
<L>Fancy has figur'd out our calm retreat;</L>
<L>Already round the visionary seat</L>
<L>Our limes begin to shoot, our flow'rs to spring,</L>
<L>The brooks to murmur, and the birds to sing.</L>
<L>Where dost thou lie, thou thinly-peopled green?</L>

May cheat you once.—Will that device,</L>
<L><HI>Neat as imported,</HI> cheat you twice?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis wrong to raise your expectations:</L>
<L>Poets be dull in dedications!</L>
<L>Dulness in these to wit prefer—</L>
<L>But there indeed you seldom err.</L>
<L>In prologues, prefaces, be flat!</L>
<L>A silver button spoils your hat.</L>

<L>At <HI>Athens</HI> once, fair queen of arms and arts,</L>
<L>There dwelt a citizen of moderate parts!</L>
<L>Precise his manner, and demure his looks,</L>
<L>His mind unletter'd, tho' he dealt in books;</L>
<L><PB N="124" REF="130"/>
Amorous, tho' old; tho' dull, lov'd repartee;</L>

<L>It <HI>hath,</HI> and <HI>doth,</HI> was rarely known to fail,</L>
<L>Himself the hero of each little tale:</L>
<L>With wits and lords this man was much delighted,</L>
<L>And once (it has been said) was near being knighted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One <HI>Aristophanes</HI> (a wicked wit,</L>
<L>Who never heeded grace in what he writ)</L>
<L>Had mark'd the manner of this <HI>Grecian</HI> sage,</L>
<L>And thinking him a subject for the stage,</L>
<L>Had, from the lumber, cull'd with curious care,</L>
<L>His voice, his looks, his gesture, gait and air,</L>
<L>His affectation, consequence, and mien,</L>
<L>And boldly launch'd him on the comic scene;</L>
<L>Loud peals of plaudits thro' the circle ran,</L>
<L>All felt the satire, for all knew the man.</L>

<L>Then <HI>Peter—Petros</HI> was his classic name,</L>

Indulge the muse in innocence and ease,</L>

<L>But most in quick short repartee they shine</L>
<L>Of local humour: or from plays purloin</L>
<L>Each quaint stale scrap which every subject hits,</L>
<L>Till fools almost imagine they are wits.</L>
<L>Hear them on Shakespear! there they foam, they rage!</L>

<HEAD>THE ELM AND VINE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FABLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Inscribed to a LADY who expressed a great aversion to MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN Aesop's days, when trees cou'd speak,</L>
<L>And talk in Hebrew, Latin, Greek,</L>
<L>An elm and vine, by chance near neighbours,</L>
<L>Tho' separate, each pursu'd their labours;</L>
<L>The vine, with native sweetness fraught,</L>
<L>For man prepar'd the chearing draught;</L>
<L>Her tendrils curl'd along the plain,</L>
<L>And ruddy clusters swell'd amain.</L>
<L>The tow'ring elm could little boast,</L>
<L>But leaves—a barren shade at most;</L>
<L>Save when by woodman's sturdy stroke</L>
<L>Cut down to make a chair, or spoke;</L>
<L>Yet tho' but small his claim to merit,</L>

<L>His neighbour's worth he view'd with smiles,</L>
<L>And long'd to share her useful toils.</L>

For, "O! said he, were we but one,</L>

<L>" While your rich fruit time might mature</L>
<L>" From storms and savage beasts secure;</L>
<L>" Our mutual help would soothe our care,</L>
<L>" And heav'n approve the happy pair."</L>

<L>" Forbear, sir elm, the vine reply'd,</L>
<L>" Nor wonder if your suit's deny'd.</L>
<L>" Shall I give up my independence,</L>

<L>At this the modest elm struck mute,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In arts long since has Britain been renown'd,</L>
<L>In arms high honour'd, and in letters crown'd:</L>
<L>The same great goddess who so nobly sung.</L>

Their deathless Marlbro' to the triumph led,</L>

<L>Strikes heav'n's high arches with the British name;</L>
<L>Tho' on the sands of Africa it glows,</L>
<L>Or casts a day-light on the Zemblian snows;</L>
<L>Still there are faults in Britain to be found,</L>
<L>Which spring as freely as in common ground.—</L>
<L>We are too gay,—they frequently too sad;—</L>
<L>We run stark wild;—they melancholy mad;</L>
<L>Extremes of either reason will condemn,</L>
<L>Nor join with us, nor vindicate with them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The human genius, like revolving suns,</L>
<L>An equal circuit in the bosom runs:</L>

<L>Must strike out new diversities of taste,</L>
<L>To one grand point eternally it leans,</L>
<L>Howe'er it warps or differs in the means.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence on no nation let us turn our eyes,</L>
<L>And idly raise it spotless to the skies;</L>
<L>Nor still more idly let our censures fall,</L>
<L>Since knaves and madmen may be found in all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here then we rest, nor further can contend,</L>
<L>For since the best will find some fault to mend,</L>
<L>Let us, where'er the virtues shed their fire,</L>
<L>With fervor reverence, and with zeal admire;</L>
<L>Exert our care the gath'ring blaze to trace,</L>
<L>And mark the progress only, not the place:</L>

<L>IT chanc'd of late a shepherd swain,</L>

<L>Within a thicket on a plain</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her golden hair o'erspread her face;</L>

<L>The snepherd stood and gaz'd his fill;</L>
<L>Nought durst he do; nought durst he say;</L>
<L>Whilst chance, or else perhaps his will,</L>
<L>Did guide the god of love that way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
<L>The crafty boy thus sees her sleep,</L>

<LG>
<L>There come, he steals her shafts away,</L>

<L>Scarce was he gone, but she awakes,</L>

<L>AS near Porto-Bello lying</L>
<L>On the gently swelling flood,</L>
<L>At midnight with streamers flying</L>
<L>Our triumphant navy rode;</L>
<L>There while Vernon sate all-glorious</L>
<L>From the Spaniards' late defeat:</L>

<L>In the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy, and dark,</L>
<L>And the labourers snore as they lie,</L>
<L>Not a noise to disturb us, unless a dog bark</L>
<L>In the farm, or the village hard by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At the time of sweet rest, and of quiet like this,</L>
<L>Ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids,</L>
<L>Let us welcome the season, and taste of that bliss,</L>

<HEAD>THE PIN.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>FOR once, ye critics, let the sportive Muse</L>
<L>Her fool's cap wear, spite of the shaking head</L>
<L>Of stern-eyed Gravity—for, tho' the Muse</L>
<L>To frolic be dispos'd, no song she chants</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="172"/>
Immoral; nor one picture will she hold,</L>
<L>But Virtue may approve it with a smile.</L>
<L>Ye sylvan deities! awhile adieu!</L>
<L>Ye curling streams! whose banks are fring'd with flowers,</L>
<L>Violet and hare-bell, or the king-cup bright,</L>
<L>Farewell! for I must leave your rich perfumes</L>
<L>To sing the Pin in ever sounding lays:</L>
<L>But not that Pin, at whose circumference</L>
<L>Rotund, the strong-nerv'd rustic hurls the bowl</L>
<L>Ponderous and vast: nor that which window bars</L>
<L>From thief nocturnal: nor that other call'd</L>
<L>A skittle; chiefly found where alehouse snug</L>
<L>Invites mechanic to the flowing cup</L>
<L>Of Calvert's mild, o'er-canopied with froth.</L>
<L>No—'tis the Pin so much by ladies us'd;</L>
<L>Without whose aid the nymph of nicest taste,</L>
<L>Of neatest mould, a slattern would appear.</L>
<L>Hail then, thou little useful instrument!</L>
<L>Tho' small, yet consequential. For by thee</L>
<L>Beauty sets off her charms, as at the glass</L>
<L>Lucy, or Phillis, best adapts thy point.</L>
<L>Without thy service would the ribband flaunt</L>
<L>Loose to the fanning gale, nor on the head</L>
<L>Of belle would stand her whimsical attire.</L>
<L>The kerchief from her neck of snow would fall</L>
<L>With freedom bold, and leave her bosom bare.</L>
<L>How would the sempstress trim thy want regret</L>
<L>As she her apron forms! And how the man</L>
<L>Of law, sagacious, with his spectacles</L>
<L>On nose reverted! frequent does he want</L>
<L><PB N="167" REF="173"/>
Thy prompt assistance, to connect his scraps</L>
<L>And notes obliterated o'er. Thee oft</L>
<L>In alley, path, wide square, and open street,</L>
<L>The miser picks, as conscious of thy use;</L>
<L>With frugal hand, accompanied with brow</L>
<L>Of corrugated bent, he sticks thee safe,</L>
<L>Interior on his coat; then creeps along,</L>
<L>Well judging thy proportion to a groat.</L>
<L>Thro' all thy different storehouses to trace</L>
<L>Thy presence, either in the sculptur'd dome,</L>
<L>Or tenement clay-built, would ask a pen</L>
<L>With points almost as various as thy heads.</L>
<L>Where-e'er thou art, or in whatever form,</L>
<L>Magnificent in silver, or in brass,</L>
<L>Or wire more humble, nightly may'st thou lie</L>
<L>Safe on thy cushion'd bed, or kiss the locks</L>
<L>Of Chloe, sleeping on the pillow's down.</L>

<HEAD>PARODY ON THE CITY AND COUNTRY MOUSE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Country vicar in his homely house,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his lot, and happy in his spouse,</L>
<L>With simple diet, at his humble board,</L>
<L>Once entertain'd the chaplain of a lord;—</L>
<L>He gave him (all he could) a little fish,</L>
<L>With sauce of oysters, in no silver dish;</L>
<L>And, for the craving stomach's sure relief,</L>
<L>The glory of Old England, rare Roast-beef,</L>
<L>Horse-radish and potatoes, Ireland's pride;</L>
<L>A pudding too the prudent dame supply'd:</L>
<L>Their cheering beverage was a pint of port</L>
<L>(Tho' small the quantum) of the better sort;</L>
<L>But plenty of good beer, both small and stout,</L>
<L>With wine of elder to prevent the gout.</L>
<L>The vicar hop'd, by such a various treat,</L>
<L>To tempt his scarf-embellish'd friend to eat;</L>
<L>With nicest bits provok'd his guest to dine,</L>
<L>He carv'd the haddock, and he serv'd the wine:</L>
<L>Content his own sharp stomach to regale</L>
<L>With plain, substantial roast-meat and mild ale.</L>
<L>Our courtly chaplain, as we may suppose,</L>
<L>At such old-fashion'd commons curl'd his nose;</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="182"/>
He tried in vain to piddle, and, in brief,</L>
<L>Pish'd at the pudding, and declin'd the beef;</L>
<L>At length, their homely dinner finish'd quite,</L>
<L>Thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' How can my brother in this paltry town</L>
<L>' Live undistinguish'd, to the world unknown?</L>
<L>' And not exalt your towering genius higher,</L>
<L>' Than here to herd with country clown—or squire;</L>
<L>' Stunn'd with the discord of hoarse cawing rooks,</L>
<L>' The roar of winds, the dissonance of brooks,</L>
<L>' Which discontented thro' the valley stray,</L>
<L>' Plaintive and murmuring at their long delay.</L>
<L>' Come, come with me, nor longer here abide;</L>
<L>' You've friends in town, and I will be your guide:</L>
<L>' Soon great preferment to your share will fall,</L>
<L>' A good fat living, or perhaps—a stall.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These weighty reasons sway'd the vicar's mind—</L>
<L>To town he hied, but left his wife behind:—</L>
<L>Next levee day he waited on his Grace,</L>
<L>With hundreds more, who bow'd to get a place;</L>
<L>Shov'd in the croud, he stood amaz'd to see</L>
<L>Lords who to Baal bent the supple knee,</L>
<L>And doctors sage he could not but admire,</L>
<L>Who stoop'd profoundly low—to rise the higher.</L>
<L>So much of ermine, lace, beaus, bishops, young and old,</L>
<L>'Twas like a cloud of sable edg'd with gold:</L>
<L>By turns his Grace the servile train addrest,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with a smile, or in a whisper blest.</L>
<L>Sick of the scene, the vicar sought the door,</L>
<L>Determin'd never to see London more;</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="183"/>
But, as his friend had pleas'd the hour to fix,</L>
<L>First went to dinner to my Lord's at six;—</L>
<L>He knock'd—was usher'd to the room of state,</L>
<L>(My Lord abroad) and dinner serv'd in plate;</L>
<L>Which, tho' it seem'd but common soup and hash,</L>
<L>Was really callipee and callipash,</L>
<L>(The relicks of the gaudy day before)</L>
<L>What Indians eat, and Englishmen adore;</L>
<L>With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feast,</L>
<L>Sooth'd his own pride, and gratify'd his guest:</L>
<L>All this conspir'd our Stoic to controul,</L>
<L>And warpt the steady purpose of his soul—</L>
<L>When lo! the cry of fire creates amaze—</L>
<L>" The next house, Lady Riot's, in a blaze"—</L>
<L>Aghast the vicar stood, in wild affright,</L>
<L>Then briefly thus address'd the priest polite:</L>
<L>" Adieu, my friend—your state I envy not—</L>
<L>" Beef, liberty, and safety be my lot."</L>

He enters, fearless of a snare,</L>
<L>For how should fraud inhabit there?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now by frequent visits free,</L>
<L>At first he perches on her knee;</L>
<L>Then, grown by long acquaintance bolder,</L>
<L>Familiarly ascends her shoulder;</L>
<L>And, wholly now devoid of fear,</L>
<L>Plays with the pendant in her ear;</L>

<L>They mark'd the transports of his eye,</L>

<L>A numerous circle of his foes;</L>
<L>Grief touch'd his soul, to see them there,</L>
<L>But, with a seeming easy air,</L>
<L>He took his place among the rest,</L>

<L>Alas, how soon can time destroy</L>
<L>The surest pledge of earthly joy?</L>

<L>Ungrateful to his kindest friends;</L>
<L>One instance sure might serve to show him!</L>

<LG>
<L>Some then recounted all the arts</L>
<L>He us'd, to vanquish little hearts;</L>
<L>Affirm'd, he still was making love,</L>
<L>And kept a miss in every grove;</L>

<L>Scandal, tho' pointed in the dark,</L>

<L>Nor thought, that creatures so polite</L>
<L>Could deal in calumny and spite!</L>

<L>And doubts his own discerning eyes,</L>
<L>But, ah, how obvious is disguise?</L>
<L>At length of hope itself bereft,</L>
<L>When now no friendly look was left,</L>
<L>And every mark of fondness fled;</L>
<L>He hung his wings, and droop'd his head.</L>
<L>And am I then resign'd, he says,</L>

<L>By these defrauded of my bliss?</L>
<L>Is all her kindness come to this?</L>

<L>WHAT! tho' thou com'st in sable mantle clad,</L>

<L>Thee here I hail, tho' terrors round thee wait,</L>
<L>And winds tempestuous howl along the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But shall I then so soon forget the days</L>
<L>When Ceres led me thro' her wheaten mines!</L>
<L>When autumn pluck'd me, with his tawny hand,</L>
<L>Empurpled clusters from ambrosial vines!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So soon forget, when up the yielding pole</L>
<L>I saw ascend the silver-bearded hop!</L>
<L>When Summer, waving high her crown of hay,</L>
<L>Pour'd o'er the mead her odoriferous crop!</L>
</LG>

<L>Father of heaven and earth! this change is thine:</L>

<L>Ah me! how blest was once a peasant's life,</L>
<L>No lawless passion swell'd my even breast;</L>

<L>Sound were my slumbers, and my heart at rest.</L>
</LG>

<L>I ne'er for guilty painful pleasures rov'd;</L>

<L>From all the hamlet cull'd whom best I lov'd,</L>
<L>With her I staid my heart, with her my bed.</L>

<LG>
<L>To gild her worth I ask'd no wealthy power,</L>
<L>My toil could feed her, and my arm defend;</L>
<L>In youth or age, in pain or pleasure's hour,</L>
<L>The same fond husband, father, brother, friend.</L>

<L>WHEN Envy saw yon Gothic structure rise,</L>
<L>She view'd the fabric with malignant eyes:</L>
<L>With grief she gazes on the antique wall,</L>
<L>The pictur'd windows, and the trophy'd hall.</L>
<L>Thro' well-ranged chambers, next she bends her way,</L>
<L>Gloomy, not dark, and chearful, tho' not gay;</L>
<L>Where to the whole, each part proportion bears,</L>
<L>And all around, a pleasing aspect wears.</L>
<L>Towards the study then her footsteps tend,</L>
<L>Where columns rise, and sculptur'd arches bend:</L>
<L>Here soothing Melancholy holds her seat,</L>
<L>And Contemplation seeks the lov'd retreat.</L>
<L>The garden next displays a magic scene</L>
<L>Of fragrant plants and never-fading green:</L>
<L>Each various season, various gifts bestows,</L>
<L>The lilac, woodbine, and the blooming rose;</L>
<L>Hence, in clear prospect to the gazer's eye,</L>
<L>Woods, hills, and streams, in sweet confusion lie.</L>
<L>The silver Thames, as he pursues his way,</L>
<L>Seems here to loiter, and prolong his stay.</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="230"/>
These matchless charms, her indignation move,</L>
<L>She weeps to find she cannot but approve:</L>
<L>Then sorely sighing, from her canker'd breast,</L>
<L>Thus the curst fiend her impious woes exprest:</L>
<L>Am I in vain the foe to all thy race?</L>
<L>'Twas I that wrought thy patriot sire's disgrace;</L>
<L>In vain I strove to blot his honour'd name,</L>
<L>Brighter it shines, restor'd by endless fame:</L>
<L>And must another Walpole break my rest,</L>
<L>And must thy praises, my repose molest?</L>
<L>'Tis thine, by various talents, still to please,</L>
<L>To plan with judgment, execute with ease;</L>
<L>With equal skill, to build, converse and write,</L>
<L>To charm the mind, and gratify the sight.</L>
<L>Ah! could I but these battlements o'erthrow,</L>
<L>And lay this monument of genius low?</L>
<L>But vain the wish, for art and nature join</L>
<L>To add perfection to the fair design:</L>
<L>It must proceed, for so the fates decree,</L>
<L>Yet mark the sentence that's pronounc'd by me:</L>
<L>Thousands that view it shall the work despise,</L>

<HEAD>THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF VIRGIL.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY MAPHOEUS VEGIUS.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Translated into ENGLISH VERSE, By MOSES MENDES, Esq.</BYLINE>
<HEADNOTE>
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE great character Maphaeus Vegius bore among the learned, may be a sufficient reason for me to have attempted the following translation; in which I was the more encouraged, as I do not know of any other version but one by Thomas Twine, doctor of physic, printed in the year 1584; and he, I am sure, is no powerful antagonist. I shall not pretend to criticise upon my author; but shall only observe, by the way, that I think him too fond of repetitions, some of which I have hurried over, and others I have entirely struck out.</P>
<P>Maphaeus Vegius was born at Lodi, in the Milaneze, in the year 1407, and was secretary of the briefs to pope Martin the Fifth, and afterwards datary. He was like∣wise endowed with a canonry of St. Peter's, with which he was so well contented, that he refused a rich bishoprick. Pope Eugenius the Fourth, and Nicholas the Fifth, out of their regard for his learning, and affection to his person, continued him in his office of datary.</P>
<P>He died at Rome in the year 1459.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Turnus being slain by Eneas, the Rutuli submit to the conqueror, and are suffered to carry off their dead leader with all his armour, except the belt of Pallas, which īs to be sent back to Evander. Eneas sacrifices to the gods. Latinus deplores the death of Turnus. So does Daunus his father, who likewise laments a great confla∣gration, that lays his city in ashes, and is miraculously trans∣formed into a bird called a heron. Latinus sends messengers to Eneas with proposals of peace, and a treaty of marriage with his daughter Lavinia, which are both accepted. He comes to Lau∣rentum, marries the daughter of the king, and at his death succeeds him in the kingdom, having first founded a city of his own, which he names Lavinium. Venus interceeds with Jupiter to make her son a god, which he consents to. She flies with him to heaven, and he is afterwards worshipped by the Romans.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>DEform'd in dust now Turnus press'd the ground,</L>
<L>The soul indignant rushing from the wound,</L>
<L>While eminent amid the gazing bands,</L>
<L>Like Mars himself, the Trojan victor stands;</L>
<L><PB N="230" REF="236"/>
Groans thick in consort from the Latians rise,</L>
<L>And ev'ry heart in every bosom dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the tall wood bewails in hollow sound,</L>
<L>By storms impell'd, her honours on the ground:</L>
<L>Now, fix'd in earth their spears, the humbled foe</L>
<L>Rest on their swords, and targets from them throw;</L>
<L>Condemn the thirst of battle, and abhor</L>
<L>The dreaded fury of destructive war;</L>
<L>Submit to all the conqu'ror shall impose,</L>
<L>And pardon crave and end of all their woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when two bulls, inflam'd with martial rage,</L>
<L>Impetuous in the bloody fight engage,</L>
<L>To each his herd inclines, who anxious wait</L>
<L>The dubious conflict, and their champion's fate;</L>
<L>But, one victorious, t'others dames in awe</L>
<L>From their foil'd chief their former faith withdraw:</L>
<L>They grieve indeed, but join with one accord</L>
<L>To share the fortunes of an happier lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So the Rutulians, struck with mighty dread,</L>
<L>Tho' deep their sorrow for their leader dead,</L>
<L>Yet now the Phrygians glorious arms would join,</L>
<L>Conducted by a leader so divine;</L>
<L>And a firm league of lasting peace implore,</L>
<L>That cruel war might vex their lives no more.</L>
<L>Then striding o'er the foe, the ghastly dead,</L>
<L>The Trojan chief expostulating said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
<L>" What madness seiz'd thee, Daunian, in the thought,</L>
<L>That we by Heaven's appointment hither brought,</L>
<L>Here planted by the thunderer's decree,</L>
<L>Could from our mansions be expell'd by thee?</L>
<L>Oh rash, the will celestial to oppose,</L>
<L>To anger Jove, and make the gods thy foes.</L>
<L>At length the utmost of thy rage is done</L>
<L>'Gainst Teucer's race with breach of league begun:</L>
<L>Lo, future times from this instructive day</L>
<L>Almighty Jove shall fear to disobey;</L>
<L>And learn from dread example, to abhor</L>
<L>The crime of kindling, without cause, a war.</L>
<L>Now boast thy arms: a noble corse thou'rt laid;</L>
<L>Since such a price thou for Lavinia paid:</L>
<L>Nor yet shall fame to thy dishonour tell,</L>
<L>That thou defeated by Eneas fell.</L>
<L>But, oh Rutulians, bear away your chief,</L>
<L>Funereal rites perform, indulge your grief;</L>
<L>With all his arms your hero I restore,</L>
<L>Except the belt which erst young Pallas wore;</L>
<L>That, to his hoary sire I mean to send,</L>
<L>Perhaps some comfort may the gift attend:</L>
<L>The sullen joy that slak'd revenge bestows,</L>
<L>May sooth his soul, and mollify his woes.</L>
<L>And ye, Ausonians, under better stars</L>
<L>Shall lead your legions to successful wars,</L>
<L>If justice wield the sword. I never sought</L>
<L>To harm your friends, but self-defending fought,</L>
<L>To save my own the hostile steel I drew,</L>
<L>Fate crown'd my honest aim, and frown'd on you."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
<L>Eneas said, and sought with inward joy</L>
<L>The walls that hold the poor remains of Troy;</L>
<L>Mean while his troops their well-lov'd chief attend,</L>
<L>And with reproach the conquer'd hosts offend:</L>
<L>Their shouts triumphant eccho to the sky,</L>
<L>The mettl'd coursers neigh, and seem to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pious Trojan ere he light the fire</L>
<L>Due to his friends upon the sacred pyre,</L>
<L>By other flames begins his just returns,</L>
<L>And to the gods each holy altar burns;</L>
<L>Observant ever of his country's rites,</L>
<L>The mitred priest devoted heifers smites.</L>
<L>The clam'rous swine increase the heaps of slain,</L>
<L>And milk-white lambkins plead for life in vain.</L>
<L>Forth from each victim are the entrails torn,</L>
<L>And piece-meal cut, in sacred chargers borne.</L>
<L>They strip the fleecy mother of her pride,</L>
<L>And roasting fires th' attendant throngs provide:</L>
<L>From deep-mouth'd urns they pour upon the shrine</L>
<L>Their due libations to the god of wine.</L>
<L>With grateful incense they the pow'rs invoke,</L>
<L>And from each altar curls the fragrant smoke.</L>
<L>The choral bands the hymns appointed sing</L>
<L>To thee, O Venus, and to Heav'ns Great King;</L>
<L>Saturnian Juno heard her praise with joy,</L>
<L>Her rage abated tow'rd the sons of Troy.</L>
<L>Mars too was sung, and then the num'rous host</L>

<L><PB N="233" REF="239"/>
Eneas with his hands to Heaven address'd,</L>
<L>And folding young Iülus to his breast,</L>
<L>Bespoke the boy; "At length, my only son,</L>
<L>Our toils are o'er, the task of war is done,</L>

<L>Next to his friends he turn'd him graceful round,</L>
<L>" Ye sons of Ilion, ever-faithful found,</L>
<L>Too long, alas, we've strangers been to ease,</L>
<L>The brunt of battle, and the rage of seas</L>

<L>So spoke the chief, revolving in his mind</L>
<L>The various fortunes that attend mankind,</L>
<L>Rejoic'd to see the objects of his care</L>
<L>Safe, thro' his means, from tempests, rage, and war.</L>

<L>The sad Rutulians their dead leader bear,</L>

Presaging fears his anxious breast divide:</L>
<L>But when he saw the wound in Turnus side,</L>
<L>He quickly caught the epidemic woe,</L>
<L>His bosom heav'd, his eyes in torrents flow,</L>

Few, few alas, a monarch's cares behold,</L>
<L>He sighs in purple, and repines in gold,</L>

<L>" Ah, what avail'd, mistaken Turnus say,</L>

<L>Nor yet had Daunus heard, his son no more</L>

<L>For while the Latins had engag'd in fight,</L>
<L>And war-like Turnus glory'd in his might,</L>

<L>When from amid the flames was seen to rise</L>
<L>With clapping wings, a fowl that cuts the skies:</L>

<L>When good Latinus, finding that 'twas vain</L>

But if stern rage has turn'd his view aside,</L>

<L>Kings rouse the nations, and the world's in arms."</L>

<LG>
<L>The sacred priest fast by the altar stands,</L>
<L>And joins in marriage-bond their plighted hands:</L>
<L>With peals of joy the vaulted roofs resound,</L>
<L>And Hymeneal songs are wafted all around.</L>
<L>And now Achates, by his prince fore-taught,</L>
<L>From out the camp the various presents brought.</L>
<L>Vests work'd with gold which Hector's consort gave,</L>
<L>Ere yet the Greeks had cross'd the briny wave;</L>
<L>A collar too, whose gems emitted flame,</L>
<L>And once the honour of the princely dame:</L>
<L>Nor was forgot a bowl insculptur'd high,</L>
<L>Pond'ious to bear, and beauteous to the eye,</L>
<L>Which on Anchises' board did whilom blaze,</L>
<L>The gift of Priam in his happier days.</L>
<L>This for Latinus good Achates brings,</L>
<L>Such royal presents kings may send to kings:</L>
<L>But the gay robes, and collar's radiant pride,</L>
<L>Are justly destin'd for the blooming bride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now converse sweet, and joy without allay,</L>
<L>Deceives the winged hours, and closes day;</L>
<L>The genial feast is serv'd in sumptuous state,</L>
<L>For luxury, at times, becomes the great.</L>
<L>On purple couches all the nobles lie,</L>
<L>The taught attendants wait attentive by;</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="257"/>
From chrystal urns are living waters pour'd,</L>
<L>And every dainty loads the regal board.</L>
<L>Bright Ceres here provides her gifts divine,</L>
<L>And the red god bestows his choicest wine.</L>
<L>With eye attentive ev'ry waiter stands,</L>
<L>And flies to execute each guest's commands.</L>
<L>This serves the chargers, that the mantling bowl,</L>
<L>And crowds in billows seem to wave, and roll.</L>
<L>Latinus near Iülus at the board,</L>
<L>Heard him with transport, and devour'd each word;</L>
<L>For in the godlike youth at once combin'd,</L>
<L>The grace of feature with the worth of mind;</L>
<L>His manly talk, his observations sage,</L>
<L>Bespoke a judgment riper than his age.</L>
<L>Nor could the king with-hold his honest praise,</L>
<L>" Take this embrace, thou wonder of thy days:</L>
<L>Thrice bless'd Eneas, sure the gods conspire</L>
<L>To make each son add lustre to the sire."</L>

<L>The banquet ended, some their talk employ</L>
<L>On Grecian battles, and the fall of Troy:</L>
<L>Now of Laurentum's broils, what shrinking bands</L>
<L>Fled from the foe, or dar'd opposers hands;</L>
<L>Who first broke thro' the ranks with furious force,</L>
<L>And thro' the slaughter urg'd his foaming horse.</L>
<L>But much Eneas and Latinus told</L>
<L>Of Latium's ancient deeds, and hero's old;</L>
<L>How Saturn flying from his offspring's rage,</L>
<L>In fair Hesperia hid his hoary age,</L>
<L><PB N="252" REF="258"/>
Hence Latium call'd: he taught to raise the vine,</L>
<L>And the forc'd earth her bounties to resign;</L>
<L>A wand'ring race, and mountain-bred he tam'd,</L>
<L>By arts improv'd them, and with laws reclaim'd.</L>
<L>Again Jove seeks his father's realms, to taste</L>
<L>Electra's beauties, and the dame embrac'd,</L>
<L>Whence Dardanus was born: his brothers slain</L>
<L>By his own hand, he fled across the main.</L>
<L>From Corythus he fled, with num'rous bands,</L>
<L>And safely settled on the Phrygian lands.</L>
<L>Proud of his birth, he in his banner bore</L>
<L>The bird of Jove, which after, Hector wore.</L>
<L>Much fame he won, which time shall ne'er destroy,</L>
<L>Th' immortal founder of imperial Troy.</L>
<L>To choral airs the high-roof'd palace rings,</L>
<L>The torches blaze, the minstrel sweeps the strings;</L>
<L>Trojan and Latians to the sound advance,</L>
<L>And mingle friendly in the mazy dance.</L>
<L>For thrice three days in revelry and joy</L>
<L>They drown'd their cares: at length the chief of Troy</L>
<L>To other tasks directs his curious eyes,</L>
<L>Mark'd out by plows shall destin'd cities rise;</L>
<L>Here form they trenches, there dig ditches wide,</L>
<L>When, strange to say, the Phrygian leader spy'd</L>
<L>A blazing glory round Lavinia's head,</L>
<L>Which to the sky its flamy honours spread.</L>
<L>He stood aghast, nor knew what meant the sign;</L>
<L>But thus his pray'r address'd: "O king divine,</L>
<L>Of men and gods! if e'er my Trojan bands</L>
<L>Have unrepining follow'd thy commands,</L>

<L>If I have led them to these pious deeds,</L>
<L>Explain this omen that belief exceeds.</L>
<L>Ah may no dire portent our peace oppose,</L>
<L>Be ended here, O Jove! our various woes."</L>
<L>While thus he pray'd, his mother lay conceal'd</L>
<L>Behind a cloud; but, soon to sight reveal'd,</L>
<L>Thus sooths her son: "Thy doubts and cares give o'er,</L>
<L>Interpret right the happiness in store</L>
<L>The gods predict. Peace spreads her olive wand,</L>
<L>And buxom plenty crowns the laughing land.</L>
<L>The lambient glories round Lavinia seen,</L>

<L>From her a mighty race of chiefs shall rise,</L>
<L>Whose fame immortal shall ascend the skies;</L>
<L>The vanquish'd world with pride shall wear their chain,</L>

<L>With such affection for these realms they burn,</L>

O'er Trojan bands thy legal sway maintain,</L>
<L>'Till good Latinus seeks the Elysian plain;</L>
<L>Then double scepters shall my offspring grace,</L>

<L>One common law shall bind them all in one,</L>
<L>No fell division, and distinction none.</L>
<L>Yet mark, O mark, what still remains for thee,</L>

<L>Thy days spun out, thou shalt not mix with earth,</L>

<L>She spoke, and quickly darting from the sight,</L>
<L>Streak'd the thin ether with a trail of light.</L>

<L>The hero stood revolving in his mind</L>
<L>The various bounties which the pow'rs design'd;</L>

<L>And now the mother of each smiling love,</L>

<L>Quick from the starry pole fair Venus glides,</L>

<L>If it e'er can give pleasure to know my career,</L>
<L>When proud London I left with intentions so queer,</L>
<L>Accept it in verse. On the very first day</L>
<L>When the queen of warm passions precedes the fair May,</L>
<L>When, so custom prescribes, and to follow old rules,</L>
<L>One half of mankind makes the other half fools;</L>
<L><PB N="258" REF="264"/>
From the town I first breath'd in, I sally'd in haste</L>
<L>Thro' Highgate and Finchley, and Barnet I pass'd:</L>
<L>At St. Alban's I din'd with a laughing gay crew,</L>
<L>Not complete was the set without Tucker and you.</L>
<L>Where the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dunstable.</NOTE>Eighth of our Harries deserted his mate,</L>
<L>And procur'd a full sentence against his old Kate,</L>

<L>And tho' at the Crown, we ne'er thought of the King.</L>
<L>The morrow succeeding I got from my bed,</L>
<L>As a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread;</L>
<L>But the gods, who will never abandon a poet,</L>
<L>As oft has been said, condescended to show it,</L>
<L>In a coach and six horses the storm I defy'd;</L>
<L>And, left by my friends, thro' the tempest I ride.</L>
<L>Newport-Pannel receiv'd me, and gave me a dinner,</L>
<L>And a bed at Northampton was press'd by a sinner:</L>
<L>No signs of fair weather, the West Chester coach</L>
<L>At nine the next morning, a welcome approach,</L>
<L>Presents fresh example; I travell'd all day,</L>
<L>At Crick eat my dinner, at Coventry lay;</L>
<L>I tremble whene'er I reflect on the roads</L>
<L>That lead to those dirty worm-eaten abodes,</L>
<L>Where a <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lady Godiva.</NOTE>woman rode naked their taxes to clear,</L>

<L>Next morning the fun, with a face of red hue,</L>
<L>Had clear'd up th' expanse, and array'd it in blue,</L>

<L>I forgot to advise you, the sky being clear,</L>
<L>'Twas at Coventry first I ascended my chair;</L>
<L>But, alas, on the morrow, how dismal the sight!</L>
<L>For the day had assum'd all the horrors of night,</L>
<L>The clouds their gay visage had chang'd to a frown,</L>
<L>And in a white mantle cloath'd Litchfield's old town;</L>
<L>But at noon all was o'er, when intrepid and bold</L>
<L>As a train-band commander, or Falstaff of old,</L>
<L>And proudly defying the wind and the snow,</L>
<L>When the danger was pass'd, I determin'd to go.</L>
<L>At Stone I repos'd, but at Ousley I din'd,</L>
<L>When our reck'ning was cheap and the landlord was kind:</L>

<L>On the banks of the Wever, at Namptwich renown'd</L>
<L>For an excellent brine pit, our dinner we found;</L>

The wine was not bad, tho' the ale did displease,</L>

<L>O'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue,</L>

And a Turk or Chinese is as well understood</L>
<L>By these Roisters, who boast of Cadwalladar's blood,</L>
<L>As an Englishman here, who is certainly undone</L>
<L>If he thinks to make use of the language of London.</L>
<L>From Flint we depart with our landlord and guide,</L>

<L>Now ascend Penmenrose, oh! beware as you rise,</L>

<L>Nor stumble the feet, nor grow dizzy the head;</L>
<L>If you slip, not mankind can avert your sad doom,</L>
<L>Dash'd against the rough rocks, and the sea for your tomb!</L>
<L>The danger is past, and now Conway's broad beech,</L>

<L>We follow'd our route, and cross'd Penmenmaur'sside,</L>

<L>At the quay of St. George in St. Patrick's chief town:</L>
<L>Thence I wrote to my friend, nor believe what those say,</L>

<BYLINE>BY Mr. MENDES.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE sons of man, by various passions led,</L>
<L>The paths of bus'ness or of pleasure tread;</L>
<L>The florist views his dear carnation rise,</L>
<L>And wonders who can doat on Flavia's eyes;</L>
<L>The lover sees, unmov'd, each gaudy streak,</L>
<L>And knows no bloom but that on Daphne's cheek:</L>
<L>While some grow pale o'er Newton, Locke, or Boyle,</L>
<L>Miss reads romances, and my lady Hoyle;</L>
<L>Thus inclination binds her fetters strong,</L>
<L>And, just as judgment marks, we're right or wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair are those hills where sacred laurels grow,</L>
<L>Rul'd by the pow'r who draws the golden bow;</L>
<L>But see how few attain the dang'rous road,</L>
<L>How few are born to feel th' inspiring god!</L>
<L>Yet all, to reach the arduous summit try,</L>
<L>From soaring Pope to reptile Ogleby.</L>
<L>Among the rest, your friend attempts to climb,</L>
<L>But ah, how diff'rent poesy and rhyme!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mid-night bard, reciting to his bell,</L>
<L>Who breaks our rest, and tolls the muses knell,</L>
<L>Is just a poet matchless and divine,</L>
<L>As he a Raphael, who, on ale-house sign,</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="274"/>
Seats his bold George in attitude so quaint,</L>
<L>That none can tell the dragon from a saint.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reckon each sand in wide New-market plain,</L>
<L>Mount yon blue vault, and count the starry train;</L>
<L>But numbers ne'er can comprehend the throng</L>
<L>Of retail dealers in the art of song.</L>
<L>Like summer flies they blot the solar ray,</L>
<L>And, like their brother insects, live a day.</L>
<L>Am I not blasted by some friendless star,</L>
<L>To know my wants, yet wage unequal war?</L>
<L>I own I am; and dabbling thus in rhyme,</L>
<L>'Tis folly's bell that rings the pleasing chyme;</L>
<L>Bit by the bard's tarantula I swell,</L>
<L>Write off the raging fit, and all is well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet, perhaps, to lose my time this way</L>
<L>Is better far than some mis-spend the day.</L>
<L>The fatal dice-box never fill'd my hand,</L>
<L>By me no orphan weeps his ravish'd land;</L>
<L>What ward can tax me with a deed unjust?</L>
<L>What friend upbraids me with a broken trust?</L>
<L>(Some few except, whom pride and folly blind,</L>
<L>I found them chaff, and give them to the wind)</L>
<L>Like a poor bird, and one of meanest wing,</L>
<L>Around my cage I flutter, hop, and sing.</L>
<L>Unlike in this my brethren of the bays,</L>
<L>I sue for pardon, and they hope for praise;</L>
<L>And when for verse I find my genius warm,</L>
<L>Like infants sent to school, I keep from harm.</L>
<L><PB N="269" REF="275"/>
What time the dog-star with unbating flames</L>
<L>Cleaves the parch'd earth, and sinks the silver Thames;</L>
<L>While the shrill tenant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The grasshopper.</NOTE> of the sun-burnt blade,</L>
<L>(A poet he, and singing all his trade)</L>
<L>Tears his small throat, I brave the sultry ray,</L>
<L>And deep-embower'd, escape the rage of day.</L>
<L>Thrice bless'd the man, who, shielded from the beam,</L>
<L>Sings lays melodious to the sacred stream;</L>
<L>Thrice bless'd the stream, who views his banks of flow'rs,</L>
<L>Crown'd with the Muse's or imperial tow'rs,</L>
<L>Whose limpid waters as they onwards glide,</L>
<L>See humble oziers nod, or threat'ning squadrons ride.</L>

<L>Health to my friend, and to his partner, peace,</L>
<L>A good long life, and moderate increase;</L>
<L>May Dulwich garden double treasures share,</L>
<L>And be both Flora and Pomona's care.</L>
<L>Ye Walton naiads, guard the fav'rite child,</L>
<L>Drive off each marsh-born fog; ye zephyrs mild,</L>
<L>Fan the dear innocent; ye fairies, keep</L>
<L>Your wonted distance, nor disturb his sleep;</L>
<L>Nor in the cradle, while your tricks you play,</L>
<L>The changeling drop, and bear our boy away.</L>
<L>However chance may chalk his future fate,</L>
<L>Or doom his manhood to be rich or great,</L>
<L>Is not our care; oh, let the guiding pow'r</L>
<L>Decide that point, who rules the natal hour;</L>
<L>Nor shall we seek, for knowledge to enrich,</L>
<L>The Delphic tripod, or your Norwood witch.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
<L>But Tucker doubts, and "if not rich," he cries,</L>
<L>" How can the boy reward the good and wife?</L>
<L>Give him but gold, and merit ne'er shall freeze,</L>
<L>But rise from want to affluence and ease:</L>
<L>The G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ido's touch shall warm his throbbing heart,</L>
<L>The patri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's bust shall speak the sculptor's art;</L>

<L>The Muse he may admire, but ne'er reward."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this I grant; but does it follow then,</L>
<L>That parts have drawn regard from wealthy men?</L>
<L>Did Gay receive the tribute of the great?</L>
<L>No, let his tomb be witness of his fate:</L>
<L>For Milton's days are too long past to strike;</L>
<L>The rich of all times ever were alike.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See him, whose lines "in a fine frenzy roll,"</L>
<L>He comes to tear, to harrow up the soul;</L>
<L>Bear me, ye pow'rs, from his bewitching sprite,</L>
<L>My eye-balls darken at excess of light;</L>
<L>How my heart dances to his magic strain,</L>
<L>Beats my quick pulse, and throbs each bursting vein.</L>
<L>From Avon's bank with ev'ry garland crown'd,</L>
<L>'Tis his to rouse, to calm, to cure, to wound;</L>
<L>To mould the yielding bosom to his will,</L>
<L>And Shakespear is inimitable still:</L>

<L>That while in sleep my senses wasted lay,</L>
<L><PB N="272" REF="278"/>
The waking soul, which sports in fancy's beam,</L>
<L>Work'd on my drowsy lids, and form'd a dream;</L>
<L>Then to my lines a due attention keep,</L>
<L>For oft when poets dream, their readers sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On a wide champian, where the surges beat</L>
<L>Th' extended beach, then sullenly retreat,</L>
<L>A dismal cottage rear'd its turfy head,</L>
<L>O'er which a yew her baleful branches spread;</L>
<L>The owl profane his dreadful dirges sung,</L>
<L>The passing bell the foul night-raven rung;</L>
<L>No village cur here bay'd the cloudless moon,</L>
<L>No golden sunshine chear'd the hazy noon,</L>
<L>But ghosts of men by love of gold betray'd,</L>
<L>In silence glided thro' the dreary shade.</L>
<L>There sat pale Grief in melancholy state,</L>
<L>And brooding Care was trusted with the gate,</L>
<L>Within, extended on the cheerless ground,</L>
<L>An old man lay in golden fillet bound;</L>
<L>Rough was his beard, and matted was his hair,</L>
<L>His eyes were fiery red, his shoulders bare;</L>
<L>Down furrow'd cheeks hot tears had worn their way,</L>
<L>And his broad scalp was thinly strew'd with grey;</L>
<L>A weighty ingot in his hand he prest,</L>
<L>Nor seem'd to feel the viper at his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around the caitiff, glorious to behold,</L>
<L>Lay minted coinage, and historic gold;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medals.</NOTE></L>

<L>THE radiant ruler of the year</L>
<L>At length his wint'ry goal attains,</L>
<L>Soon to reverse the long career,</L>
<L>And northward bend his golden reins.</L>
<L>Prone on Potosi's haughty brow</L>
<L>His fiery streams incessant flow,</L>
<L>Ripening the silver's ductile stores;</L>
<L>While, in the cavern's horrid shade,</L>
<L>The panting Indian hides his head,</L>
<L>And oft th' approach of eve explores.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo, on this deserted coast</L>
<L>How faint the light! how thick the air!</L>
<L>Lo, arm'd with whirlwind, hail and frost,</L>
<L>Fierce winter desolates the year.</L>
<L>The fields resign their chearful bloom:</L>
<L>No more the breezes waft perfume;</L>

No more the warbling waters roll:</L>
<L>Deserts of snow fatigue the eye,</L>

<L>Now thro' the town promiscuous throngs</L>
<L>Urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire;</L>
<L>Harmonious dances, festive songs,</L>
<L>To charm the midnight hours conspire.</L>
<L>While mute and shrinking with her fears,</L>
<L>Each blast the cottage-matron hears,</L>
<L>As o'er the hearth she sits alone:</L>
<L>At morn her bridegroom went abroad,</L>
<L>The night is dark, and deep the road;</L>
<L>She sighs, and wishes him at home.</L>

<L>But thou, my lyre, awake, arise,</L>

<L>How pleasing wears the wint'ry night,</L>

<L>While, by the taper's trembling light,</L>
<L>I seem those awful courts to tread</L>
<L>Where chiefs and legislators lie,</L>

<L>Discourse like this attention claim'd;</L>
<L>Grandeur the mother's breast inflam'd;</L>

<L>So, to the neighbouring meadow carry'd,</L>
<L>A formal ass the couple marry'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Torn from the tyrant mother's side,</L>
<L>The trembler goes, a victim-bride,</L>
<L>Reluctant meets the rude embrace,</L>
<L>And bleats among the howling race.</L>
<L>With horror oft her eyes behold</L>
<L>Her murder'd kindred of the fold;</L>
<L>Each day a sister lamb is serv'd,</L>
<L>And at the glutton's table carv'd;</L>

The crashing bones he grinds for food,</L>
<L>And slakes his thirst with streaming blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love, who the cruel mind detests,</L>
<L>And lodges but in gentle breasts,</L>
<L>Was now no more. Enjoyment past,</L>
<L>The savage hunger'd for the feast;</L>
<L>But (as we find in human race,</L>
<L>A mask conceals the villain's face)</L>
<L>Justice must authorize the treat;</L>
<L>Till then he long'd, but durst not eat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As forth he walk'd, in quest of prey,</L>
<L>The hunters met him on the way;</L>
<L>Fear wings his flight; the marsh he sought!</L>
<L>The snuffing dogs are set at fault.</L>
<L>His stomach baulk'd, now hunger gnaws;</L>
<L>Howling, he grinds his empty jaws;</L>
<L>Food must be had—and lamb is nigh;</L>
<L>His maw invokes the fraudful lye.</L>
<L>Is this (dissembling rage) he cry'd,</L>
<L>The gentle virtue of a bride?</L>
<L>That, leagu'd with man's destroying race,</L>
<L>She sets her husband for the chace?</L>
<L>By treach'ry prompts the noisy hound</L>
<L>To scent his footsteps on the ground?</L>
<L>Thou trait'ress vile! for this thy blood</L>
<L>Shall glut my rage, and dye the wood!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So saying, on the lamb he flies;</L>
<L>Beneath his jaws the victim dies.</L>

<L>Lo! Discord enters at the sacred porch,</L>
<L>Rage in her frown, and terror on her crest:</L>
<L>Ev'n at the hallow'd lamps she lights her torch,</L>
<L>And holds it flaming to each virgin breast.</L>

<L>Three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled,</L>

<L>Yet then what solemn scenes deceiv'd my choice!</L>
<L>The pealing organ's animating sound,</L>
<L>The choral virgins' captivating voice,</L>
<L>The blazing altar, and the priests around:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The train of youths array'd in purest white,</L>

<L>The thousand lamps that pour'd a flood of light,</L>
<L>The kiss of peace from all the vestal throng:</L>

<L>The golden censers toss'd with graceful hand,</L>

<L>No wakening joy informs my sullen breast,</L>

<L>This caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow,</L>

<HEAD>A RECEIPT how to make L'EAU DE VIE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the late Mr. CHARLES KING.</BYLINE>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN AT THE DESIRE OF A LADY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GROWN old, and grown stupid, you just think me fit,</L>
<L>To transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt;</L>
<L>And a comfort it is to a wight in distress,</L>
<L>He's of some little use—but he can't be of less.</L>
<L>Were greater his talents;—you might ever command</L>
<L>His head,—("that's worth nought")—then, his heart and his hand.</L>
<L>So your mandate obeying he sends you, d'ye see,</L>
<L>The genuine receipt to make L'eau de la vie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take seven large lemons, and pare them as thin</L>
<L>As a wafer, or, what is yet thinner, your skin;</L>
<L>A quart of French brandy, or rum is still better;</L>
<L>(For you ne'er in receipts should stick close to the letter:)</L>
<L>Six ounces of sugar next take, and pray mind</L>
<L>The sugar must be the best double-refin'd;</L>
<L>Boil the sugar in near half a pint of spring water,</L>
<L><PB N="309" REF="315"/>
In the neat silver sauce-pan you bought for your daughter;</L>
<L>But be sure that the syrup you carefully skim,</L>
<L>While the scum, as 'tis call'd, rises up to the brim;</L>
<L>The fourth part of a pint you next must allow</L>
<L>Of new milk, made as warm as it comes from the cow.</L>
<L>Put the rinds of the lemons, the milk and the syrup,</L>
<L>With the rum in a jar, and give 'em a stir up;</L>
<L>And, if you approve it, you may add some perfume;</L>
<L>Goa-stone, or whatever you like in its room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let it stand thus three days,—but remember to shake it;</L>
<L>And the closer you stop it, the richer you make it.</L>
<L>Then filter'd thro' paper, 'twill sparkle and rise,</L>
<L>Be as soft as your lips, and as bright as your eyes.</L>
<L>Last, bottle it up; and believe me the vicar</L>
<L>Of E— himself ne'er drank better liquor:</L>
<L>In a word, it excels, by a million of odds,</L>
<L>The nectar your sister presents to the Gods.</L>

<L>Ye shepherds, henceforward be mute,</L>

<L>So give me my Corydon's flute,</L>
<L>And thus—let me break it in twain.</L>
