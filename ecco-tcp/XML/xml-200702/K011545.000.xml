<HEAD>THE PREFACE To Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Am so little inclin'd to trouble even Men of Merit, with the Address of such Trifles as These, that it was impossible I shou'd so much as have thought of Yourself with that View, if Honest <HI>Bernard,</HI> your Bookseller, had not inform'd me, That You (I suppose it was out of the Fulness of your known Zeal for our Church and Constitution) had taken upon you to assert, that Printing any thing in Praise of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Russia</HI> wou'd be receiv'd as a Satyr on the Government.</P>
<P>'Tis possible, that under this Disguise of Opinion, Your Excess of Good-breeding may have conceal'd your Dislike of the Performance; for I find it a Difficulty to conceive, how so whimsical an Objection cou'd come into a Head, so well stor'd with Judgment, as we are to conclude Yours to be, from Your <HI>Essay on Criticism.</HI></P>
<P>Let either of these sage Cases be the Right, I consider their Importance as Equal; and take this Occasion, with a Frankness, like Your own, to assure You, that my Esteem for Your <HI>Genius</HI> as a Poet, is so very considerable, that it is hardly exceeded by my Con∣tempt of Your Vanity.</P>
<P>What led me to embrace an Opportunity of knowing Your Opinion, was a Disposition which two Lines in Your <HI>Essay</HI> above-mention'd shall explain for me;</P>
<L>Trust not Your-self; but Your Defects to know,</L>
<L>Make Use of Ev'ry Friend:—And Ev'ry Foe:</L>
<P>I cou'd not, I confess, consider you as a <HI>Friend,</HI> having that very great Misfortune to languish under, of not being reckon'd in the Number of Your Acquaintance: But in the <HI>Last</HI> of the two Lights, I presum'd, I might regard You, since Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> for whose Skill in Judging I profess an Esteem, has assured us, that You are a Kind of <HI>Foe</HI> to e∣very Body but Your-self, and on that Foundation, supports his rough Attempt <HI>to pull the Lyon's Skin from a certain little Ass</HI> he there mentions, and I fear he means You, Sir.</P>
<P>When I consider'd You in this Character, I made no doubt but any Poem wou'd have had the Good Fortune to come out of Your Hands well examined, that I shou'd have heard of <HI>Rough Verse,</HI> improper <HI>Sentiments,</HI> and a World of <HI>Poetical</HI> Errors: But I profess Your Penetration over-shot all my Fears, and I cannot find Words to express my Astonish∣ment at Your Capacity, when Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> lisp'd out, That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> said, <HI>there were several good Things in the</HI> Northern-Star, <HI>BUT, it would be taken for an Insult on the Government: FOR, tho' the</HI> Czar <HI>is King</HI> George <HI>'s Ally; yet we are like∣ly to quarrel with</HI> Sweden; <HI>and</HI> Muscovy, whisper'd Bernard, <HI>lies, he says, in the North!</HI></P>
<P>If this pleasant Discovery was Your Real Opinion, we must, I'm asraid, learn to <HI>pity</HI> the Weakness of a Judgment, which, I know, is Heroic enough to wish rather for <HI>Envy, tho' a sturdier Passion, and agree with You heartily, that,</HI></P>
<L><HI>A</HI> Little Learning <HI>is a dangerous Thing.</HI></L>
<P>But if you dislik'd the Poem, as a Poem, why did you not fairly avow the Disrelish? I could have own'd a Conviction of Error, with the same Satisfaction, I feel, when I repay a Civility. Shall I put you in Mind, that Dislike not own'd openly, stands condemn'd by a Judge, whose Sentence Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> of all Mankind, will be the last to appeal from,</P>
<L>Be Niggards of Advice, on no Pretence,</L>
<L>For the worst Avarice is that of Sense:</L>
<L>With mean Complacence ne'er betray your Trust,</L>
<L>Nor be so civil, as to prove unjust:</L>
<P>Pope <HI>'s Essay on Criticism.</HI></P>
<P>I must, by no Means, imagine, that a supercilious Result, from Neglect of examining into the Merits of a Cause, he pretends to decide, can he charg'd with any Justice on the Au∣thor of the following Lines, unless he was religious enough to write them, with Design to lash himself by Way of Penance.</P>
<L><HI>Of all the Causes, which conspire to blind</HI></L>
<L><HI>Man's Erring Judgment, and misguide the Mind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>What the weak Head, with strongest Byass, rules,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is,</HI> Pride, <HI>the neverfailing Vice of Fools.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whatever Nature has, in Worth, deny'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>She gives. in large Recruits, of needful Pride:</HI></L>
<P>In short, if I writ Verse often enough to make my Vanity Rampant; I should shrewdly suspect, that you were mightily taken with this Poem, since you thought it worth your while
<PB REF="3"/>
to give it an ill Charàcter; for You▪ who rever iie, have told the World, and I suppose you assert Nothing but from Your own Knowledge,</P>
<L>That still the Worst with most Regret, Commend,</L>
<L>And each bad Writer is as bad a Friend.</L>
<L>And while Self-Love each jealous Writer rules,</L>
<L>Contending Wits become the Sport of Fools:</L>
<P>But. if I was not afraid, that You wou'd think me Ill-natur'd, I wou'd observe in your Favour, on this Occasion, that tho' all these foregoing Verses are Your own Words, they way posibly be very different from Your Sentiments; for I remember, that, among the rest, You, tell us, by Way of Warning.</P>
<P><HI>That Men of Wit may their own Rules invade,</HI></P>
<P><HI>As Kings dispense with Laws, themselves have made.</HI></P>
<P>I will therefore take Advantage, from my having been pretty conversant with your Writings, to seek a better Reason yet, for the Oddness of your Notion, that this <HI>North∣ern-Star</HI> is a Satyr on the <HI>Government.</HI> Your abovemention'd Cabinet of Sentences is so well furnished, that, like a Masquerade-shop at <HI>Venice.</HI> it will give a Man what Face he pleases in a Twinkling; but I presume, I have hit the Right Nail, when I stop at the fol∣lowing <HI>Simile.</HI></P>
<L>All seems infected, that th' infected Spy,</L>
<L>As all looks Yellow to the Jaundic'd Eve:</L>
<P>But however, tho▪ as <HI>Teague</HI> in the Comedy, finds his Mouth run from one Side to the other, and cannot for his Life say <HI>Ladyship</HI> to Mrs. <HI>Day,</HI> without laughing in her Face, I cannot without much Difficulty grow Grave, when I compare the Judge with the Sen∣tence; yet to allow all possible fair Quarter, let us suppose, that the <HI>Czar,</HI> as He is not; were now actually our Enemy—Are his Merits less shining? Does His Glory depend on His Friendship for <HI>Britain?</HI> Contemptible Meanness of Thought! Is it necessary to∣wards becoming a <HI>Patriot,</HI> among the <HI>English,</HI> that every Thing must be hated, that is▪ <HI>Foreign?</HI> At that Rate the <HI>toto divisos orbe Britannos</HI> wou'd be more applicable to our Humour than it is to our Sitvation.</P>
<P>Next to deserving well ourselves, it is the noblest Perfection of Nature, to admire and applaud those, who do so; But to have no Ear open to Renown at a Distance, were base, vain and brutal, equally distasteful to Humanity and Wisdom. We may talk what we please of our <HI>Natural Advantages.</HI> There is one <HI>Natural Defect,</HI> which will sha∣dow them All; and which makes it impossible to widen our Power, till we enlarge our Conceptions.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe that Nothing has contributed more to this Narrowness of Mind, than the Flatteries of our Poets: who generally writing for a precarious Subsistance, can no Way so easily succeed, as by falling in with the Weakness and Byass of Mens Natures; and hence all our Women are Nymphs, Angels, or Goddesses; our Men, Demi-Hero's; all our Soldiers are invincible; all our Generals beyond <HI>Caesar;</HI> all our Kings like <HI>Augus∣tus;</HI> and every Lord who has a Penny in his Pocket, and a Crotchet in His Imagination, a very <HI>Mecaenas.</HI></P>
<P>A Poet shou'd sometimes stand high, and look wide for a Subject; If He is always Do∣mestic, He will be often unnatural. <HI>Virgil's</HI> celebrated Praise of his <HI>Italy,</HI> had been Falshood and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attery, apply'd to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> He knew and admired the Delights of His Country, and acted as became Him, when he justly commended them. But our High∣way-Poets, whose utmost Reach of Skill is a <HI>Poor Imitation,</HI> forget that they make <HI>Them∣selves</HI> contemptible▪ instead of ornamenting their Subject, when Peace in <HI>our</HI> Climate is dress'd in her <HI>Olives;</HI> when <HI>Pan</HI> fills our Woods, and <HI>Tritons</HI> our Seas; and our Shep∣herds <HI>sit Piping,</HI> like the Swains of <HI>Arcadia.</HI></P>
<P>A meer Poet, that is to say, a Wretch, who has nothing but the Jingle in his Brain to ring Chimes to his Vanity, and whose whole Trade is Rhyme-jobbirg; such a Creature is certainly the most worthless Incumbrance of his Country. His Arrogance is the only Thing more Remarkable than his Ignorance. The fantastical Merit that swells him, is, like o∣ther Ill-Humors▪ the more noxious for its Thinness. Useful Science is an Air much too Gross for His Intellects: Biting Scorn, and Universal Neglect turn their Points on His Conceitedness, and while the whole World strives in vain to correct him by Disgrace and Reproaches, All that Tempest to Him is no more, than Blowing Wind in a Bladder, the stronger the Puff, the more boisterous the Swelling.</P>
<P>All this, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> must reeds know, between his double Capacity, of <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Critic;</HI> and, if so, He has given a Judgment, as well corrupt, as ridiculous, in attributing to <HI>Party</HI> the Endeavours of <HI>Justice.</HI> But if after all, it was not the <HI>Subject,</HI> but the <HI>Poem,</HI> that found no Favour in His Eyes, I will take upon me to assure Him, it sues not for the Blessing: Let him like it as ill as He pleases, I dare at least, undertake, it shall easily defend it self against any Attack, of His making; which, pray Sir, inform Him, since you are His greatest Admirer, and oblige</P>

<HEAD>THE Northern Star. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BORN in an Age, when Virtue's Vigour fails,</L>
<L>Where Praise is <HI>Dumb,</HI> or <HI>Speaks,</HI> as Change prevails;</L>
<L>Where strugling Courage stoops to Want's Controll,</L>
<L>And Fortune's ev'ry Tide o'erwhelms the Soul;</L>
<L>Where hard-press'd Poverty the Contest flies,</L>
<L>And with low Flatt'ry, shameful Succour buys;</L>
<L>Where ill-judg'd Worth, by Pow'r, and Wealth, is weigh'd,</L>
<L>And servile Poets make their <HI>Art</HI> a <HI>Trade.</HI></L>
<L>Rise, Genr'ous Muse! And let the Wand'rers know,</L>
<L>'Tis base to Praise, where they no Praises owe:</L>
<L>That Justice scorns an undue Fame to sell;</L>
<L>And Nothing claims Renown, but Doing-well;</L>
<L>That He dishonours Verse, who bows his Theme,</L>
<L>To Great Mens Fortune, or to Rich Mens Phlegm;</L>
<L>That, thro' all Forms, the Muse shou'd <HI>Merit</HI> trace,</L>
<L>A Blessing, unconfin'd to Rank, or Place;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
That Narrow Minds conceive not Virtue right,</L>
<L>And Worlds, not Realms, shou'd be the Poet's Flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Extend thy Truth-plum'd Wings, Unbyass'd Muse!</L>
<L>Discern with Caution, but with Boldness chuse:</L>
<L>If, in some dusky Corner, thou shalt find</L>
<L>A ragged Fortune hide a noble Mind,</L>
<L>Disperse the Cloud, and be the Labour thine,</L>
<L>To teach such shame-fac'd Virtue how to shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, where thou seest some wealthy Churl with-hold</L>
<L>Th' enliv'ning Use of His imprison'd Gold,</L>
<L>If meanly Proud, the Wretch disdains to weigh</L>
<L>The Wise Man's Wants against the treasur'd Clay;</L>
<L>With pointed Satyr pierce his stubborn Soul,</L>
<L>Till Sense of Shame does Pride of Heart controll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er Statesmens Actions keep a watchful Eye,</L>
<L>The Stains, they make, assume the blackest Dye!</L>
<L>If, rais'd by Chance, some Wretch, not form'd for Sway,</L>
<L>Exerts the Cover'd Beast, and hunts for Prey:</L>
<L>If, all untaught in Pow'r, He drives with Rage,</L>
<L>And, blust'ring, shakes His temporary Stage,</L>
<L>Whisper unwelcom Notice in His Ear,</L>
<L>That where Abuse spreads wide, Revenge is near.</L>
<L>But stay! To nobler Aims address thy View,</L>
<L>And mark the mighty Deeds, which Monarchs do:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Their Good Example sways unfix'd Mankind,</L>
<L>And dim-ey'd Princes make whole Nations Blind</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When God-like <HI>Caesar</HI> rul'd Ungrateful <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>And Budding Empire shot a fragrant Bloom,</L>
<L>His Virtues made those Slaves more blest than He,</L>
<L>Who Murder'd <HI>Him,</HI> to be, unsafely, Free.</L>
<L>When Bloody <HI>Nero</HI> fill'd That <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Throne,</L>
<L>Corrupted Justice durst no Virtue own:</L>
<L>Degen'rate <HI>Rome</HI> became the Villain's Post,</L>
<L>And He was safest, there, whose Guilt was most.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Undreading, therefore, when Occasion calls,</L>
<L>Enter Proud Palaces, Imperious Walls;</L>
<L>There, Good, or Ill, detect the reigning Fact,</L>
<L>For Truth is Truth, however Princes act.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sublimely fir'd, I snatch the Glorious Aim,</L>
<L>'Tis Great indeed, to give the <HI>Royal</HI> Fame!</L>
<L>But, where, O! Spotless Light of Reason's Eye!</L>
<L>Where, among Princes, shall I Virtue spy?</L>
<L>Shall my own Sov'reign's Praise enrich my Lines?</L>
<L>No:—With known Force, Domestick Glory shines:</L>
<L>Vain were the Thought, and needless the Design,</L>
<L>To say, to Angels, Heav'n is all Divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Northward, unbridl'd Muse! Direct thy Flight,</L>
<L>Where a New Sun adorns the Land of <SUP>(1)</SUP> Night:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Where Arts, and Arms, a Rising Empire <HI>sound,</HI></L>
<L>Doom'd to refine the World, and Girt it round.</L>
<L>Thou, Mighty <HI>CZAR!</HI> in that <SUP>(2)</SUP> Contracted Name,</L>
<L>Shalt out-weigh <HI>Caesar,</HI> in thy Pow'r and Fame!</L>
<L>Led by thy Forming Hand, Victorious still,</L>
<L>And almost New-created, by Thy Skill,</L>
<L>Intrepid Legions wait thy Doomful Nod,</L>
<L>As Hosts, from <HI>Moses,</HI> watch'd the Will of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, God like Object of my Muse's Praise,</L>
<L>Thou, Best Invok'd! Inspire my Rising Lays!</L>
<L>Kindle my Glowing Soul with Fire like Thine,</L>
<L>And lend me <HI>Bluze,</HI> to make Thy Wonders shine.</L>
<L>Tho' right to mark How tow'ring Eagles fly,</L>
<L>Requires the Sharpness of an Eagle's Eye,</L>
<L>Tho' High-rais'd View does best a Prospect show,</L>
<L>Which He can Ill describe who stands too low,</L>
<L>Yet, if, aspiring to the Theme, I find</L>
<L>Thy Glory's Lustre strike my op'ning Mind,</L>
<L>O! Prince, the Grateful Arrogance forgive!</L>
<L>No Genuine Muse, so charm'd, can silent live!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perish that narrow Pride, from Custom grown,</L>
<L>That makes Men blind to Merits not their own:</L>
<L><HI>Briton,</HI> and <HI>Russian,</HI> differ but in Name,</L>
<L>In Nature's Sense, All Nations are the same:</L>
<L>One Universe claims One Creator's Care,</L>
<L>And Man is Reason's Subject Every-where.</L>

<L>While untrac'd <HI>Nile,</HI> with swelling Torrent strays,</L>

<L><HI>Egypt,</HI> in Influence, and the World, in Fame:</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ages, obscurely pass'd, unmark'd by Fame,</L>
<L>Had almost robb'd this Empire of its Name:</L>
<L>Unmeasur'd States lay hid, in noiseless Reign,</L>
<L>And <HI>Russia</HI> took up half our World in vain:</L>
<L>Weakly inspir'd, the Mass did slowly roll,</L>
<L>Like some huge Giant, with a Pigmy's Soul:</L>
<L>Till Ripening Time an Equal <HI>Genius</HI> sent,</L>
<L>Divinely siz'd to suit the vast Event:</L>
<L><HI>He</HI> breath'd Prolific Vigour o'er the Land,</L>
<L>And moulded Order, with his skilful Hand;</L>
<L>The swelling Energy of Pow'r spread wide,</L>
<L>And bore down proud Obstruction like a Tide:</L>
<L>In sudden State, a dreadful Empire rose</L>
<L>Which, Late, no Hope, and, Now, no Danger knows.</L>

<L>In Marble Quarries, thus, to swell their Gain,</L>
<L>Men blow up hollow Rocks, with nitrous Grain;</L>

<L>And yields, reluctant, to its forceful Fate:</L>
<L>The Cave, unroof'd, with sudden Splendor, bright,</L>

<L>Did not, O Prince! Thy Love of Art's soft Charms</L>
<L>Ungrind the keener Influence of thy Arms;</L>
<L>Well might the Jealous World malign Thy Sway,</L>
<L>And, anxious, wink, against Thy Stream of Day!</L>
<L>But Thy Great Soul has taught Thee, that the Brave</L>
<L>Wish not to conquer, but with View to save:</L>
<L>That 'tis a Monarch's Task to steer his Reign,</L>
<L>Betwixt the wild Extremes of <HI>Mean,</HI> and <HI>Vain:</HI></L>
<L>To curb Presumption's Childhood with Restraint,</L>

<HEAD>Explanatory NOTES, Referr'd to, in the POEM.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1) I Call <HI>Russia The Land of Night,</HI> not only <HI>Literally,</HI> as its general Distance from the Sun occasions tedious and uncomfortable Winters, but also in a <HI>Me∣taphorical</HI> Sense, because an almost total Absence of the Arts (till this <HI>Czar</HI>'s Reign) had wrapt the Country in a Night of Ignorance.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>In that Contracted Name. Czar</HI> is a Contraction of the Word <HI>Caesar,</HI> and is us'd to signify a King, or Emperor, not only in the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue, but the <HI>Scla∣vonian,</HI> and some others; and, no doubt, deriv'd its Rise from that Title of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors. Nor is there any other Difference in the Words than the Contraction only, since the antient Latin Pronunciation was not <HI>Caesar,</HI> as we speak it, but the <HI>C</HI> being pronounc'd as a <HI>K,</HI> made <HI>Kaisar,</HI> and, in that Manner, it was undoubtedly spoken by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Germans have no other Title for the Emperors to this Day, than <HI>Kaisar,</HI> which the smallest Variation changes into <HI>Czar,</HI> according to the <HI>Russian</HI> Appellation.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Almost ow'd Distinction to his Hand.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Russia</HI> have for many Ages been possess'd of very large Dominions, and a Power as extensive, and un∣bounded, as most other Princes; yet, partly by their distant Situation, and partly by their Want of Skill in Arms and Arts, it is certain that they are but lately become Known to these Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and were never formidable, 'till they ow'd it to the Genius of their present Monarch.</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>Gave their scatter'd Limbs a Head.</HI> Every Body knows that <HI>Theseus</HI> gather'd the <HI>Athenians</HI> into a Body, from a dispers'd and solitary Way of living; and founded and peopled the City of <HI>Athens,</HI> which was before but a little Village, tho' a Kingly Seat, where he brought them to a Relish of Society, and usefully, instructed them in the Knowledge of improving their united Power.</P>
<P N="5">(5) <HI>Nations, Numberless as Lybian Sands.</HI> The <HI>Hyperbole</HI> may plead more than Poetical Licence to excuse it; for, if, according to the Practice of Great Part of the <HI>East,</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> each distinct <HI>Tribe</HI> or <HI>Herd,</HI> may be indulg'd in their Ambition to be thought a particular <HI>Nation,</HI> as most Writers have practis'd, Then may the petty <HI>Herds</HI> of <HI>Tartars,</HI> almost every where surrounding <HI>Russia,</HI> added to the wild Variety of Inhabitants in <HI>Siberia, Samoieda, &amp;c.</HI> who depend upon the <HI>Czar,</HI> be call'd <HI>Numberless,</HI> without much Help from the <HI>Hyperbole.</HI></P>
<P N="6">(6) <HI>The Shaggy Samoid.</HI> The <HI>Samoiedes</HI> are a People subject to the <HI>Czar,</HI> and in∣habiting a large Tract of Land, from <HI>Nova Zemla,</HI> to the Neighbourhood of <HI>Arch∣angel,</HI> and extending along the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea. They neither Plough nor Sow, their Country being too cold to produce Corn; so that they live chiefly on dry'd Fish and Turneps, and the Flesh of a Kind of Deer, which feeds on the Moss of their Heaths: And, with the Skins of these Deer, having a very thick, warm Fur, they cloath and defend themselves from the Sharpness of the Frost, and covering them∣selves all over, keep the Snow from blowing in at their Necks; and live three Months, in the Year, without Sight of the Sun.</P>
<P N="7">(7) <HI>O'er Lands, where scarce the Russian Name has past.</HI> Notwithstanding the just Notion, which <HI>Europe</HI> has conceiv'd for some Years past, of the formidable Power of the <HI>Russian</HI> Arms, yet is their Country so little known, to the Generality of other Nations, that it is almost Universally called <HI>Muscovy,</HI> tho' that is only the Name of its old Capital <HI>Muscow:</HI> And the <HI>English</HI> might, with the same Justice, in fo∣reign Countries, be called by no other Name than The <HI>Londoners.</HI></P>
<P N="8">(8) <HI>Thence sudden Fleets have shadow'd Distant Seas.</HI> It is known, that the <HI>Cza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> has on a sudden, cover'd the <HI>Baltick,</HI> with a powerful Fleet of Men of War and Gallies; which was sufficiently seen, when He transported His Army to join with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in the intended Descent upon <HI>Schonen:</HI> And on the other Side of His Dominions, He has built a Fleet against the <HI>Turks,</HI> to serve upon the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> most of which Ships, being of very great Force, were built at <HI>Vero∣nize,</HI> a Town seated on a Branch of the famous <HI>Tanais,</HI> and falling into the <HI>Palue Maotis,</HI> not far from the City of <HI>Azoph.</HI></P>

(9) <HI>The V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgin Caspian.</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> has caus'd Ships to be sent down the <HI>Volga</HI> into the <HI>Caspian-Sea,</HI> to make Discoveries on the Side of <HI>Georgia, Persia, Armenia,</HI> and independant <HI>Tartary,</HI> and a considerable Trade, for the Products of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> is already carried on, from several Ports in that Sea, to <HI>Astracan,</HI> and thence dispers'd over <HI>Russia,</HI> by the <HI>Volga</HI> and the <HI>Don.</HI> This Sea is call'd the <HI>Virgin-Caspian,</HI> because it has no known Communication with any other, being the largest Lake in the Universe, about five hundred Miles long, and, in Breadth, four hundred; and by Means of this Sea, the <HI>Czar</HI> has at all Times, an Inlet into the Heart of <HI>Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> whenever he shall think of extending His Conquests that Way.</P>
<P N="10">(10) <HI>A Rival Power, in Naval Struggle try'd.</HI> The <HI>Turks,</HI> 'till the Reign of this Illustrious Prince the <HI>Czar,</HI> possess'd Entire Dominion in the <HI>Euxine:</HI> But the <HI>Russian</HI> Fleets can now dispute their Title; and, of this, the <HI>Turks</HI> have had Ex∣perience ever since the Year 1696. when the Loss of <HI>Azoph</HI> was the Consequence of an Overthrow at Sea, by the <HI>Russian</HI> Gallies, commanded by the <HI>Czar</HI> in Per∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. The Terror this Defeat occasion'd at <HI>Constantinople</HI> was so great, that they built new Castles on the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> and took all possible Precautions to prevent some future Attempt that Way, by the <HI>Russian</HI> Navy; but so much in Vain, that I am convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and could justify it by Reason and Demonstration, that, if the <HI>Czar</HI> shou'd, as it is now likely he will, declare War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> he may, with the smallest Expence, or Hazard, imaginable, begin his Success by laying <HI>Constantinople</HI> in Ashes, or possessing it, if he pleases, and maintaining it against all possible Efforts of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power.</P>
<P N="11">(11) <HI>Yok'd Hellespont.</HI> The Passage of this famous Chanel is guarded, and made as the <HI>Turks</HI> falsly believe, impossible to be forc'd, by two old Castles, called the <HI>Dardanelles;</HI> one seated on the <HI>Asian</HI> Side, the other on the <HI>European,</HI> about three Quarters of a Mile asunder; and having each a Platform of prodigious out∣of-Size Artillery, carrying Stone Bullets of two or three Foot Diameter.</P>
<P N="12">(12) <HI>Now greet their</HI> Russia <HI>by an untry'd Way.</HI> If <HI>Constantinople</HI> were in the Hands of the <HI>Czar;</HI> and the <HI>Hellespont;</HI> by that Means subject to Him, His Ships from the South Parts of His Dominions, bordering on <HI>Circassia,</HI> might, thro' the <HI>Bosphorus, Propontis, Hellespont,</HI> and <HI>Aegean,</HI> pass into the <HI>Mediterran an,</HI> and coming thro' the Streights Mouth, sail <HI>Northward,</HI> and reach <HI>Russia</HI> again, at the Port of <HI>Archangel.</HI></P>
<P N="13">(13) <HI>Feel their Pride shake,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Chinese,</HI> tho' vastly distant from <HI>Russia,</HI> have been warr'd upon by that Nation, and made to conceive very different Idea's of them, from those which their Pride had before suggested to them: And the <HI>Czar</HI> duely sensible of the many Advantages, which may arise from a perfect Dis∣covery of that Immensity of Desart, which divides Him from <HI>China,</HI> has com∣pleated that Design, and built Forts and large Towns, all the Way, at proper Di∣stances, for the Defence, and Entertainment of His Subjects, who travel, every Year from one Empire to the other by Land, carrying out and bringing back such Commodities, as are most in Demand by the Merchants of both Nations. They set out, when the Winter has cover'd all the Country with Snow, and the Surface of that Snow is so harden'd by Frost, that they are drawn with great Swift∣ness over it, in Sleds, by a large Kind of Deer; they, who ride in the Sled, being cover'd with thick, and warm Furs, for Defence against the Severity of the Cold.</P>
<P N="14">(14) <HI>Where Proud Discov'ry has so oft been lost.</HI> Abundance of Ships have been lost, and great Numbers of excellent Mariners been frozen to Death, in the Search of a North Eastern Passage to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> by the Way of <HI>Nova Zemla,</HI> and the great Sea of <HI>Tartary.</HI> If there is such a Passage, as there must be, unless the <HI>Russian</HI> Dominions are join'd on the North, to <HI>America,</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> has a Design to discover it; and will undoubtedly succeed in it, because His Situation affords him an Advantage, which no other Monarch is Master of.</P>
<P N="15">(15) <HI>Prophetic Greece re-hopes Her own.</HI> There has, long, been a Prophecy among the <HI>Greeks.</HI> that their Redemption from the <HI>Turkish Yoke,</HI> shall be owing to a fair, white hair'd People from the North; and they are strongly, and universally per∣swaded, that the <HI>Russians</HI> are the People, meant in the Prophecy.</P>
<P N="16">(16) <HI>And, when eight hundred lab'ring Tears were past.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Romans,</HI> assisted by the Strength of their National Virtue, in the Infancy of their Power, grew sud∣denly Glorious, yet they reach'd not the Height of their Empire, till the Days of <HI>Trajan;</HI> which Summit of Authority is hinted at by the <HI>Aspiring to Rule,</HI> and <HI>Panting after Fame,</HI> in the Poem.</P>
