<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO the sacred Majesty of Kings (I am sensible) ought not in common cases to be approach'd by every little Busy-body, or frivolous Remon∣strance-maker; yet when our Prince's Palace is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fire, and his sacred Person in the midst of the Flames, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e meanest of his Subjects hath the Privilege then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve him warning of his Danger, and to assist to quench <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Fire: And this I am afraid, Sir, is at present too near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Case, or I would not have assum'd the Boldness to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sturb your Repose, or have plac'd my self so disadvanta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eously before your Majesty, as I must expect to appear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the Character of a publick Censor of the Manners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Ministers, and a petty State-Reformer. But it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot I alone that am thus concern'd and busy for the Pub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck; the whole World are at this time mournfully reflec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing upon the miserable Estate we are fallen into from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat happy and glorious Prospect of things which we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1688 and 1689: This has put all Men upon Enquiry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to the Causes of the unhappy Change of our Affairs; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I find it agreed on all hands, that the principal Occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f our Misfortunes (or rather Mismanagements) is from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he intrusting those with the Government of all, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere the Creatures and Tools of the two last Reigns, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re irreconcilable Enemies to your Majesty's Government; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who oppos'd your coming to the Crown; those who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eclar'd to your Face King <HI>James</HI> the only Rightful King; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who sold their Country and betray'd it to the two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Kings, and will be always ready to sell it even to the <HI>French</HI> King, if he prove the fairest Chapman.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>I have heard that <HI>Thurloe,</HI> who was Secretary of Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> being ask'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. how they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> support their Government so long, when all the Nobilit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentry and Clergy were against it? he reply'd, <HI>By intrusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> those only in the Management of all Affairs, who were as hearti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> against that Nobility, Gentry and Clergy.</HI> I do not apply th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> literally; for God be prais'd, your Majesty has a great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all these several Degrees of Men, who are most hearti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and zealously in your Interests: But I mean by this, that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are to oppose your Enemies with their Enemies, not wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Friends; and that the Design of keeping out Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>James</HI> with Jacobites, seems to be as impracticable, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Project prov'd of setting up Popery with a Protestan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Army.</P>
<P>Yet there are some about your Majesty, who (for ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and private Ends) endeavour to possess you with the de¦structive Politicks of courting and buying your Enemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into your Service; and would persuade you, that Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>James</HI>'s Tories are the only Party truly principl'd for Mo¦narchy, and are fittest for Employment, as being lon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practis'd in Business: And that (on the contrary) you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty's best Friends, whom they call Whigs, are not onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ignorant, and unacquainted with Publick Business, but ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Haters of Monarchy, of Commonwealth Principles; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at best, for making their Kings no more than Dukes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Venice,</HI> and Kings of Clouts. Now this is a Notion so false, so fatal to the Prosperity of your Affairs, and so dan∣gerous to the very Being of your Government, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot but think it highly necessary, that this matter should be fairly stated and laid before your Majesty. I am sensible how unfit I am for the Task, and how open I lie to a Charge of Presumption in attempting it, But as the Son of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who was from his Birth dumb, broke Silence when he saw his Father in the Hands of his Murderers; so (since I saw no other Champion appear in this Cause) I re∣solv'd to break thro all Impediments, even those of Nature, and to endeavour the Rescue of my King out of the Hands of those who have already been the Ruin of two Kings, your Majesty's Predecessors, and who will undoubtedly bring you and your Affairs into great Difficulties, if you be not deliver'd from their Counsels.</P>
<P>In order to this, I have impartially made a Collection (in the following Dialogue) of all the Arguments which Whigs imploy against the Tories, or Tories against the Whigs, and submit it to your Majesty's discerning Judg∣ment, and most piercing and distinguishing Wisdom (upon the whole) which of them are most proper for your Ma∣jesty to employ; those who were in the Interest of Popery
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of <HI>France,</HI> or those who oppos'd both to the Death. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appeal to you, Sir, whether a Tory's being for the Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne Right of Succession, and consequently for King <HI>James</HI>'s Monarchy, makes him the fitter in Principle to be employ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y King <HI>William?</HI> Or, whether his boasted Skill in Busi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess will be of any use to your Majesty, if he be in Prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple and Inclination for King <HI>James,</HI> and believes King <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illiam</HI> a King <HI>de facto</HI> only, without a Rightful Title, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in plain <HI>English,</HI> an Usurper? If these Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as their Principles will naturally lead them to do) use all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Skill in their several Stations, to obstruct and make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifficult your Affairs, to betray your Designs to your Ene∣mies, to countenance and protect King <HI>James</HI>'s Friends in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll their Plots and Contrivances, furnish them with In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elligence, help them to Passes, Escapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which things (it cannot be deny'd) have been and are daily done by some Persons employ'd in this Government: Of what Use, Sir, or Service then is this boasted Skill in Business to your Majesty's Interests? Certainly Men less conversant in Publick Affairs, who have a Zeal for your Government, would be of more Use and Service to you; Men who were persecuted by King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> either in their own Persons, or in the Persons of their Friends, who were fin'd, imprison'd, and some of their Relations hang'd in those Reigns, are more likely to act in earnest against King <HI>James,</HI> and in the supporting your Majesty and your Government, than those who had their Fortunes and their Families rais'd by King <HI>James</HI> and his Brother King <HI>Charles,</HI> and who hope to be rais'd yet more by his Return, or at least to secure in his Government what they have got in this, by obliging him and his Friends, at the Price of sacrificing you and your's.</P>
<P>For Example: Is it reasonable to believe the E. of <HI>N.</HI> whose Father and Family was rais'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> for prostituting the Law (and his nauseous Rhe∣torick) to the Designs of those two Brothers, who himself was a Privy-Counsellor with Father <HI>Peters,</HI> and chosen by King <HI>James</HI> at the time of the Revolution to treat with your Majesty at <HI>Hungerford,</HI> in order to delay your Progress to <HI>London</HI>; and lastly, who so violently oppos'd your Ma∣jesty's being crown'd King, as to lay an eternal Obligation upon King <HI>James</HI> by it: I say, Sir, is it reasonable to be∣lieve this Gentleman so proper a Secretary of State to your Majesty, as the E. of <HI>S.</HI> who has so mortally dis∣oblig'd King <HI>James,</HI> in being so early, and so zealous in your Interests, who went at the Head of that Message to King <HI>James</HI> wherein he was requir'd to retire from <HI>White∣hall</HI>; who has since that been so instrumental to place and
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
preserve the Crown upon your Head; and has, in a word, broken all Measures so with King <HI>James,</HI> as to leave no possibility of a Reconciliation to him, and consequently has no Retreat from this Government, but is oblig'd in common Sense to serve your Majesty faithfully and zea∣lously?</P>
<P>Or can your Majesty think Mr. <HI>K.</HI> who (it is generally said) believes himself the Son of King <HI>J.</HI> and it is known by all the World, owes his Fortune to him; who (if we may believe Report) at the time of the Revolution, agreed with Captain <HI>Tosyer,</HI> to carry the Ships he then commanded in the <HI>Straits</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> in <HI>France</HI> (had not the com∣mon Sailors very rudely oppos'd the Project) who after this acquitted himself so ill at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> in letting the <HI>Thoulon</HI> Squadron pass by him in his sight, without fighting them; and to conclude, has made so unaccountable a Campagn of it this Summer: Can your Majesty (give me leave to say, Sir) think this Gentleman (after all this) fitter to com∣mand the Fleet of <HI>England,</HI> than Mr. <HI>R.</HI> whose Provoca∣tions to King <HI>James</HI> are never to be forgiven by him; who was one of the most instrumental Men in <HI>England</HI> in placing you upon the Throne; who last Year gave you the greatest and most glorious Victory that ever was obtain'd by us at Sea; and whose Courage, Conduct and Fidelity the Par∣liament of <HI>England</HI> has unanimously attested?</P>
<P>And now, Sir (if I may presume so far) will your Ma∣jesty be pleas'd to examine what Honour, what Profit has accru'd to you, or the Nation, by your employing these Gentlemen who have of late been at the Head of the Ministry? For God's sake, Sir, cast up the Account of the last four Years Management, and see what you have gain'd by changing Whigs for Torys. Have not your Af∣fairs gone backward both at home and abroad? Have not Mismanagements been multiply'd? Have you not cool'd your Friends, and yet not gain'd your Enemies? Do not almost all the Tories you employ drink King <HI>James</HI>'s Health in your Wine, and serve him in your Offices? Do they not obstruct all Business which ought to be dispatch'd, and dispatch all Business which ought to be obstructed? brow∣beat your Friends, and delay them in the most just Pre∣tences, but comply with your Enemies in their most un∣reasonable Demands; nay, connive at their Cabals and Conspiracies, and snatch them out of the Hands of Justice, when the Law has sentenc'd them to Death for their Trea∣sons? Would not such Ministers and Friends as these be less dangerous to you, when profess'd Enemies, nay in Arms against you in the Field, than in your Council, Ca∣binet and Offices? Undoubtedly they would.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>But I know the common Answer to all these kind of Complaints is, That it is more easy to find Faults than Remedies. If you please therefore, Sir, we will consider of Remedys, and I think there may be some found out both easy and certain, and they are these: First, Sir, be pleas'd to remove from your Person, Council and Offices of Trust, Men bred up and confirm'd in Principles de∣structive to our <HI>English</HI> Government, and hateful to your People; and to discountenance all State-Projecters, and Mountebank-Ministers, who make Wounds in the State to recommend their Balsam: Throw out, Sir, these <HI>Achans</HI> to be ston'd by the People, who will otherwise, I fear, prevent God's Favour to you; who blast your Success a∣broad, and rob you of the Affections of your Subjects at home, with their accursed thing, I mean that Tinsel Power with which these Miscreants dazle the Eyes of Princes, and lead them out of the right way. God is dis∣pleas'd with it: For uncontroulable and unaccountable Power is the Right and Attribute of God alone; and (as the Scripture tells us) <HI>He will not give his Glory unto another; nor suffer those to act like Gods, who are to die like Men.</HI> Your People also will be displeas'd with a Despotick Power; for the Kings of <HI>England</HI> are bound by Laws, by mutual Compacts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (as you your self, Sir, have set forth most unanswerably in your Declaration when you came over) and if these are broken, <HI>English-men,</HI> who believe them∣selves Subjects to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> (as by Law esta∣blish'd) and not Slaves to any particular Person<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Otherwise King <HI>James</HI> would have a fairer Pretence, than I hope we shall ever allow him.</NOTE>; they become impatient, angry, and at length perhaps unreasonable. And whenever they see their King beset with Ministers of Lawless Principles (those wholesale Merchants of Arbitrary Power) they grow mistrustful and uneasy, and are apt in such Cases to shut their Purses, and open their Mouths. And give me leave to say, Sir, had not the People been made apprehensive and jealous, by seeing these Men in the Ministry, whose mis∣chievous Methods they were so well acquainted with, and did so much abhor; no general Excise, no Loans, no Powers would have been thought by the People of <HI>England,</HI> too much to have intrusted you with; so highly they esteem'd your generous Relief of them, your unequal Courage, and the many other admirable Vertues they saw shine in you. An <HI>English</HI> King is the greatest Monarch upon Earth, when he reigns in the Hearts of his Subjects; and all other Methods to Power and Greatness have been found ineffectual in <HI>England,</HI> I remember I once saw
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
written over a Mercer's Shop, <HI>Keep thy Shop, and thy Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will keep thee:</HI> and tho it be a homely Allusion, it is very applicable to the present Point; <HI>Keep your Laws, Sir, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Laws will keep you</HI>; support your People in their Right and Liberties, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> shall pass her Royal Word for them, they will support your just Prerogative a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> home and your Honour abroad. And, Sir, by the way do not let your Flatterers give you a cheap Opinion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power deriv'd from the People; for it is undoubtedly from their Consent, that all Power must come: Nor let them make you uneasy that your Title to the Crown is from the universal free Choice of the Commons of <HI>England.</HI> Be¦lieve me, your Ministers, nor the two learned Bishops who have scribled upon this Subject, will ever be able to find you a better.</P>
<P>In the next place, discharge all Jacobites and Trimmer from Offices of Trust: For such as either desire King <HI>James,</HI> or from their Fear, or Wisdom, endeavour to de∣serve from him (so much as their Pardon) I humbly con∣ceive are unfit for your Service at this Juncture; tho when the Government is more settl'd, I am for entertain∣ing all who give Proofs of their Penitence for their past Actions and Opinions.</P>
<P>But, Sir, Purgatives will not alone perfect the Cure of your Government, and restore it to perfect Health; you must make use of Alteratives too, there must be a Change of Measures, as well as a Discharge of Men: And the Method I would humbly offer is this.</P>
<P>First; To make the Interest of <HI>England</HI> your chief De∣sign and Aim; and since you are an <HI>English</HI> King, to be∣come intirely an <HI>English-man. England</HI> is a Nation jealous of Rivals in her Prince's Favour, and thinks her self de∣serving of all his Care, and all his Caresses. If the Peo∣ple of <HI>England</HI> think you have a favourable Opinion of them, they will endeavour to deserve it; if not, they may perhaps deserve your worst Opinion too. This Humour of the Nation Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> found early, and apply'd her self so happily to it, as by this single Point to master all her Difficulties (the greatest it may be that ever Prince had to struggle with) whereas her Successors, by contrary Measures, brought themselves into very unfortunate Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>In the next place, Sir, let me desire you to avoid con∣cerning your self in Elections of Members in Parliament, or influencing them when chosen: the Parliament is a sacred part of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, and like the <HI>Israelites</HI> Ark of old, is not to be touch'd profanely, but with great Danger to those who touch it so. And therefore, Sir, it will be
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur true Interest to leave the People free to their Choice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the Members free to their Opinions when chosen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is still fresh in our Memories, how much the Practices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the late Reigns in corrupting Elections, and closeting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embers of Parliament, enrag'd the Nation, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d reason to resent it; for if (for the sake of a Vote) a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ember of Parliament shall be plac'd in an Office of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rust he is not fit for, this is destroying the Government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo ways at once: For, to speak in the Phrase of the Ministry, it is making a Parliament of Clouts, and an Officer of Clouts at the same stroke. Rejecting Bills offer'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Parliament of publick Benefit, and for securing our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntient Government, and the Fundamental Rights of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bject, was highly displeasing to the Nation also in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te Reigns, and will be so in all Reigns: As was likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e denying the People their undoubted Right of frequent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arliaments. They had also in the late Governments an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvention to make a Pump of the Parliament, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouring in a Pint of Water, to fetch out a Tun: This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as justly most provoking to the Nation, and treasur'd up Wrath against the Day of Wrath.</P>
<P>The refusing of Bills, and the Contempt of Addresses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Parliament against Ministers, or in any other Cases, has likewise given great Offence in former Reigns. For tho the House of Commons, seconded by the House of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords, cannot reach the Life or Estate of any Person, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a full Proof in form of Law; yet because it is so diffi∣cult a matter to come at such a Proof, a Vote of the House of Commons against any Minister, has always been esteem'd by all Kings (who were well with the People) a sufficient Reason for the removing them from Court: and I have heard that our King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. (a warlike and wise Prince) upon an Address from the Parliament against some of his Ministers, reply'd, <HI>I know no Evil by these Men; but if they are thought unfit by my Parliament for my Service, I shall not think fit to continue them in it.</HI></P>
<P>All these things, Sir, therefore are most carefully to be avoided by your Majesty: They will appear with a worse Grace in you, who have declar'd and made War against these Practices, than in your Predecessors. For as St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>Thou who hast said, Ye shall not commit Adultery, dost thou commit Adultery? Thou who hast said, Ye shall not steal, dost thou steal?</HI> You must by no means, Sir, give this occasion of Clamour and Recrimination to your Enemies. But be pleas'd to follow this General Rule, always to be∣ware of the Ministers, and to avoid the Schemes and Counsels of King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI>'s Government, and then you can scarce err: For whatever is opposite to
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
their Principles and Practices, is the direct Road to yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Security and Success.</P>
<P>In the next place, Sir, let Rewards and Punishment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be duly and impartially distributed; this is a Rule <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which all Ages and Governments have paid the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Respect and Observance, and to which the present Mo¦narch of <HI>France</HI> does chiefly owe the Prosperity of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Affairs: and without this Principle no Government ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subsist.

Let you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soldiers be encourag'd, and prefer'd according to their Bravery and Abilities, without Favour or Affection: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bravest otherwise will follow the Example of Cowards, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they find they have no Advantage over them by thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Courage; for all Men would be Cowards if they durs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> To an <HI>English</HI> Soldier a Smile or a kind Word is as accep¦table at some times as a Month's Pay; and if you wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> condescend to a Commendation of what they do well, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will endeavour on the next occasion to exceed what the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did before: For if you are once Master of their Love you are sure to have the Disposal of their Lives.

Let the Insolence of your Ene∣mies be rebuk'd, and Rebels and Traitors to your Govern¦ment be severely punish'd, and not courted and caress'd for in the present State of Affairs all Mercy to your Ene¦mies is Cruelty to your self and Friends: and it encourage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Enemies, and disheartens your Loyal Subjects, to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Insolents brave the Government unpunish'd, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see your treacherous Ministers solliciting the Pardon o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every condemn'd Traitor; and making their Court to King <HI>James</HI> at the Price of your Safety, is most provoking to every good Man. Besides, it looks like your having a Doubt of your own Right and Title to the Government▪ to be thus backward in asserting it; and is so interpreted by the Jacobites.</P>
<P>Intelligence as another Point of mighty Consequence and can scarce be purchas'd too dear: For it is the Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Government, and directs all its Actions properly, and without it you consult in the dark, and execute blind fold you know not what to act, what to fear, where to attack

I do not mean by this that we are to penetrate into the <HI>French</HI> King's Counsels, or rifle his Cabinet, that I am afraid is out of the reach of our Power, and of our Purse: But I cannot but think we may be able to know the Marches of their Armies, and the Motions of their Fleets, without selling our Souls to the Devil for Intelligence, or breaking our Exchequer.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have set before your Majesty, what, in my poor Judgment, is for your Interest to pursue, and what is for your Service to avoid; what will make your Maje∣sty and this Nation happy, what will make both unhappy: and I heartily pray the great, good and wise God, to di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t, bless and prosper your Majesty in all your glorious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>signs for the Defence of these Kingdoms, and of <HI>Chris∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom,</HI> against the common Enemy. If I have us'd too great a Freedom, or have offended in what I design'd for your Service, I am sorry for it: I call God to witness, my Plainness proceeded from my Zeal and Affection to your Interests, and the Prosperity of your Affairs, and not from any factious, saucy or unmannerly Principle. I wish some abler Pen had taken upon him this Part. But I must own, it provok'd me to see my Country and my King so forsaken; the one of Advocates, the other of honest Counsel: and this urg'd me to take upon me these two Characters, of Advocate and Adviser, both which I confess my self very unfit for: Not, but that as I said in the beginning, I take it to be the Privilege, nay and the Duty too of every <HI>English</HI> Subject (provided it be per∣form'd form'd with a decent and due Respect) to lay before the King such Matters as may be dangerous to his Person or Government, to be conceal'd from his Knowledg (for we are not ty'd up in <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Spanish</HI> Forms, where the King must be wet to the Skin, if he whose proper Office <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o is be not in the way to put on his Cloke.)

<P><HI>Whig.</HI> In the same Interest; why, who thinks that now?</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> What, in one of your old peevish Fits? I thought now all things go to your Mind, you would have been in better Humour.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> You were begotten, born and bred in Mistakes, and I doubt not but you will continue so to your end: Yet you cannot be so grosly mistaken sure as to think all things go to any honest <HI>Englishman</HI>'s Mind; when you, who were the Tools of the two last Reigns, the Instruments of all our past and present Misfortunes, and the declar'd Cause of the War which brought on the late Revolution, are not∣withstanding the only Men courted by this Govern∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> I am afraid you will never be pleas'd with any Mo∣narchical Government.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> That is a Point I know you have been long endea∣vouring to put upon the World, but more industriously upon the Court; yet I wonder at your Impudence of urging it now, since it is so fresh in every Man's Memory, how zealously the Whigs struggled in the late Convention to settle the Monarchy, whilst you contested as zealously to make it an Anarchy.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> We will talk more of this by and by: But if you were so instrumental as you say in setting up this Go∣vernment, why are you so out of Humour with what you have made your selves?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<HI>Whig.</HI> Disappointment you must allow a just Cause of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esentment. We hop'd from new Lords, new Laws, new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inisters, and new Methods: but if still we are to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e same Ministers, and consequently the same Methods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he very Tools of the two last Reigns, and consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same Work; this I take (in my Lord <HI>H—</HI>s Phrase) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be a Change, without an Alteration; and, in my Opi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, gives too just occasion of Dislike: and I cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nk this way of managing Affairs, must end unhappily, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth to Prince and People.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> But how come, you and I to be so concern'd either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Prosperity of Princes, who never think of us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as we can serve some present Turn of theirs; or for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest of Mob, who will sing Ballads upon us under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allows, when we are hanging there for their sakes? Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee <HI>Whig,</HI> grow wise, and do not torment thy self thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith State-Affairs; let Princes take care of themselves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he People of themselves, and let us take care of ourselves. My Method is, to get what I can, and let Courts do what they will.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> Why then, Sir, with your leave, your Method is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> foolish as it is knavish: For whoever sells his Country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a lawless Power, leaves himself nor his Family no Certainty, no Property in what he has gotten by his Treachery; nay, his Estate is as often the Snare, as the Comfort of his Life. It proves sometimes a <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vine∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, and makes him the Eye-sore of some hungry Court Favourite. And I would ask, Whether a small Estate fenc'd about with Laws, and the Possession thereof secur'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o you and your Family, is not of more Value, than a much greater Revenue, of which you cannot assure your self the Possession one minute? Your Forefathers thought the Laws and Liberties of <HI>England</HI> worth their Care and Contest, and waded thro Rivers of Blood to leave them in force to their Posterity. And the Church once made it an Article of their Religion, <HI>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari</HI>: But thou dost renounce all the Principles of Humanity, of common Sense, and of Religion, and oughtst to be driven out of a Country which thou makest open Pro∣fession to sell and betray. And as for what you say of the Ingratitude of Princes and People, the one to his faithful and affectionate Subjects, the other to their zealous Pa∣triots; this does not discharge you from your Duty to either. But (in answer to the first) if you will serve Princes no farther than you serve your Country in serving them, that Service will always reward it self; and for the Mob, as you are ever pleas'd most mannerly to call your Coun∣trymen and Fellow-Citizens, if any prove so sordid as you

<P><HI>Whig.</HI> As for your Fashion of Government, Mr. <HI>Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> I hope it is either gone to the Grave with King <HI>Charles,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>France</HI> with King <HI>James</HI>; and could heartily wish yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would follow it to either Place.

As I take it, the Prin¦ciples of Liberty and Property have always been in fashion amongst Men of Sense and Estates in <HI>England,</HI> and eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be.

<P><HI>Whig.</HI> Not at all; that only proves a Mistake some¦where; and where the Mistake is, if you please, we wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> inquire: and I think it will best appear by examining th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> original Rise, Principles and Practices of both Parties.</P>

<P><HI>Tory.</HI> You <HI>Whigs</HI> have been the occasion of all this t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for you were so irreconcilable to some Ministers of St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the beginning of the Revolution, because they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made a few slips in the late Reigns; or perhaps beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they had hang'd some of your Friends, a Father, or B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ther, or so; that you forc'd them to take in some Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom they themselves thought not very proper for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Government: But if you will run a Man down, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> support himself at any rate; for Men are but Men. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> withal I believe they hop'd that a Place would buy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Party out of their Principles, and that all whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought into the Government, would be oblig'd by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> means to be for the Government.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> This is very far fetch'd, Mr. <HI>Tory,</HI> tho it is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first time I have heard it. But as to the first part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Paragraph, the Matter of Fact is false: The <HI>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> were willing to forget all past Miscarriages, and be reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cil'd to any Minister that could be honest, as I shew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you before. But these Gentlemen quickly convinc'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World, that they were grown so old and stiff in the former Mischiefs, that they were capable of no oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Bent or Impression, but what they had taken in the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reigns. And it was plain to every Man who had Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they were no sooner in the Ministry, but they fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into their old Schemes, which no honest Man could com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into; and which I am afraid the Court has not found th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Effects from, which these <HI>Evil Counsellors</HI> promis'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> It's true, by giving Places to all that were supple an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complying, you have brought in the Knaves of all Parties But since that which brings them into the Service of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Government, is their own Interest, and not that of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Government; it will be reasonable for our Rulers to ex¦pect, that the whole Design of such Men will be rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how to serve themselves of the Government, than ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to serve it. To conclude, Sir, notwithstanding all yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have said in excuse of your Ministers and their Method<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I cannot but remain in my first Opinion, That <HI>the Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> easy Phlegm, born on the Confines of Indifference,</HI> as Sir <HI>Samue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tuke</HI> in <HI>F—ch-like Fustian</HI> describes our lukewarm Neutrals are not fit Men to be employ'd in our Government, as the Case stands at present, but will prove as destructive to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as downright <HI>Jacobites.</HI></P>

But yet we hope we may claim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinction to be made betwixt our Party, who not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fess, but have maintain'd to the death the Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghts and Libertys of their Country; and yours, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King <HI>Charles</HI>'s and beginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e up all these things; and who, tho you are employ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sworn to the present Government, made publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>joicings at the Slaughter of our Armies and Destruc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of our Fleets.

<P><HI>Tory.</HI> Just now you seem'd to agree to a Comprehension, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd were for welcoming the Prodigals, as you call'd them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow you are for excluding them again.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> No, I am for receiving any <HI>Tory,</HI> as I told you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat seeks the Government, and becomes a true Penitent: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut I would not have the Government seek them, nor would I have them entrusted in this critical time without some marks of their Repentance and Regeneracy; and by our Easiness give them the Opportunity of selling us to the <HI>French</HI> K. or K. <HI>James,</HI> as I fear some of 'em do at this time.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> All that's Malice and Stuff, and not reasonably to be apprehended: And I tell you once more, it is the Opinion of some wise Men, that the King cannot follow
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
a more fatal Counsel than to confine himself to any on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Party of his Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> Then your Patrons have been advising him fatall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these four Years; for they have been persuading the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to throw himself intirely into your hands.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> They never refus'd to receive any Whig, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would comply, and come under their Protection; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King will chuse any one Party, I think we of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church are the most numerous and considerable, and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fittest as such to be employ'd by him.</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> Now you are retir'd into your Sanctuary, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church,</HI> you think you are safe, and it is indeed dangerou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pursuing you: But however I'll venture it; and since yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> force me, I must repeat again some of those Argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have given you already, why you are not fit to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trusted by this Government. First, you Tories do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe your selves King <HI>William</HI>'s Subjects, and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are very unfit to be employ'd by him as his Servants▪ Secondly, it cools the Affections of the People, to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those employ'd in Places of highest Trust, who they hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Demonstration are not for the Government even whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are in it. And by this Method it is plain the King (according to the Fable) loses his <HI>Shoulder of Mutton,</HI> by catching at the <HI>Shadow</HI>; and by aiming at both Parties, he has neither.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> I confess I am for the King's relying on one Party as much as you are (tho not yours) but however, there are great and wise Men, as I told you, of another Opi∣nion; and I have heard it ask'd, Why this method of uni∣ting all Parties should not have as good an effect here as in <HI>Holland,</HI> for there the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> reconcil'd all to the common Interest?</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> I'll tell you why: First, it appears all Parties there sincerely intended the Good of the Government; which, it is too plain, is not your case. Secondly, Nei∣ther Party had any other Head to repair to, as you <HI>Tories</HI> have. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had no pretending Rival to the Right of Stadtholder; but the King has here a Rival, a Father-in-Law, who pretends a Right to the Crown, who is supported by the greatest Power that ever was known in <HI>Europe,</HI> so as to make the Event appear doubtful, even to those who are most zealous to this Government. And by this means the Friends of King <HI>James</HI> are en∣courag'd to be firm to his Interests, and Neutrals; nay, and even his fearful Enemies are frighted from acting with a Zeal against him. Is this a time then to be trying Experiments, to put our selves and our Affairs into the
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
hands of Men bred up, and principled against the Design of this Government? Is this a time to reconcile our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lves to our Enemies, and to take Men out of Plots, and place them in our Cabinet? No sure, with my Lord <HI>N—</HI>'s leave, <HI>this is not the time.</HI> In this time of danger, those who have been the antient and declar'd Enemies of King <HI>James,</HI> and who have most reason to ex∣pect being hang'd if he return, are most fit for the King to rely on. But when these Difficulties are master'd, as much Comprehension as you please. In the mean time your Education in <HI>Toryism,</HI> your Obligations to King <HI>James,</HI> and, which is more than both, your present Hopes from him, will make you so averse to this Government, that no Favour, no Courtship can engage you heartily in its Interests; and it is nonsense to expect you should fight for a Title you have always declar'd to disapprove of.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> You are always harping upon that string: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pposing we do not approve of the making him King, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t we know how to obey Kings when they are made; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u, after you have made a King, are using him like your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reature, clipping his Power, and finding fault with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onduct. For my part, <HI>if I were a King, I would sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>give a Man that dislik'd my Title, than one who dislik'd my Conduct.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> Why then, Mr. <HI>Tory,</HI> you would be none of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sest Princes: For he who finds fault with your Conduct may be your Friend, but he who finds fault with your Title must be your Enemy, or else a Knave, and acts against his Conscience. But how does this Article ap∣pear, of the <HI>Whigs</HI> being dissatify'd with the King's Conduct in any point, but in his employing you, and the Conse∣quences of it? Is it from giving chearfully whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ums were demanded in Parliament? Is it being ready to advance Mony upon the most remote Funds, in offer∣ing their Persons to the Publick Service in all times of Danger, notwithstanding all Browbeatings and Discourage∣ments; by breaking all Measures with King <HI>James</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Party, that they discover their Dislike and Dissatis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction to the King or his Government? But if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isapprove that the Friends of King <HI>James</HI> should be King <HI>William</HI>'s Ministers, that those should be plac'd in all Offi∣ces who hate him and betray him, will he have reason to take their Dislike of this part of his Conduct so very unkindly from them, as to forgive it less than your re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouncing his Right and Title to the Crown?

And was not this Gen∣tleman on this account laid aside gently and privately, and this matter huddled up for fear of any Reflection on our Monarchical Favourites, and put on the Publick as Passes forg'd (as indeed they were by our own Officers) and a lame Proclamation put out with Rewards to the Discoverer, but without a Pardon for Life, when they knew the whole matter before-hand?

<P><HI>Tory.</HI> But where could you get such able Officers, if these were discharg'd?</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> As the Case stands, one honest Man will be of more service than ten such able Men: The Forms of Business will be quickly learn'd, and want of Expe∣rience will be less fatal to us, than want of Fidelity. Most of the Under-Places require a very indifferent Understanding, and little Experience to carry on the Business: And if you ascend to the Ministry, I cannot help thinking my Lord <HI>Sh—y,</HI> or Sir <HI>J.

ever any Government in so promising a Condition, as ours was at the time of the Revolution? Were we not the Hopes of all our Allies, and the Terrour of our Enemies? And is not the case alter'd with us? I fear it is. To be plain, a Ministry from <HI>Wapping</HI> could not have made worse work on't than yours have done. Ministers who know not so much as what Mony their Affairs will require, but ask the Parliament too little, and manage it so as to make it less: That want Intel∣ligence so much, that Matters of the greatest Conse∣quence have been publick in every Coffee-house three Days before it comes to the Secretary's Office; parti∣cularly the loss of our Merchants Fleet, and beating our Army in <HI>Flanders:</HI> As if (as one said) Secretaries, like Cuckolds, were to know their Dishonour and Misfor∣tunes last. Then the Return of our Fleets for want of Provisions, laying out Mony in false Expeditions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anting it thereby in true Necessities; imperfect Or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs, from whence proceeds imperfect Execution; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sides, they prove an Excuse to Officers even in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost fatal Miscarriages; with a thousand more Misma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gements and Treacheries from the top to the bottom of the Ministry, too tedious to relate here.</P>
<P><HI>Tory.</HI> And do you think the Government would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter serv'd at this time by Novices and Strangers to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usiness?</P>
<P><HI>Whig.</HI> I have answer'd you that before: I think it would be much better serv'd by ignorant Friends, than under∣standing Enemies; tho I am far (at the same time) from granting you that Point, for I am sure there are more Men of Sense and Capacity to be found amongst the <HI>Whigs</HI> than amongst the <HI>Tories</HI>; and that Experience is not of such mighty Consequence as you would infer, will appear, if you will please to call to mind the Men employ'd in Publick Affairs by <HI>Cromwel.</HI> Was ever Government better serv'd than his? and yet he chose Men of the most private Condition, and one would have thought most unqualify'd for Publick Business, Taylors, Draymen, broken Shop-keepers, raw Scholars, and some few of the middling Gentry. But being careful to chuse Men principled against the Government of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and zealous for the Interest of the Government then on foot; they did Wonders, supported their Friends, and were awful to their Enemies; and this with all the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy, both Church of <HI>England</HI> and Presbyterian, in perpetual Combinations and Con∣spiracies against them at home, and a War in <HI>Ireland,</HI>

But to return to the Point of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harge, we must confess likewise that we have not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much under the Government of our Superiours as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou are, nor so industrious in supporting each other's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ivate and particular Interests. But to the first I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight answer, That Fools and Beggars are more easily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by the Nose than Men of Sense and Estates: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd as to the latter, I must put you in mind, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Societies of <HI>Ignatius</HI> and of <HI>Newgate</HI> are both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem as much united as you, in universal Mischief; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Roguery makes a stronger Glew and Cement than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertue, because there are more Men capable of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer than of the latter. And tho it were to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish'd, that the <HI>Whigs</HI> were more friendly, and had more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncern for the Support of one another in all their ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Pretences; yet God forbid there should ever be such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Friendship and Partiality amongst them, as to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emn and disgrace those who gain Victories, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are not of their Party; and to support and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd those who have lost the Ships, Trade and Honour of the Nation, because they are their Creatures.
