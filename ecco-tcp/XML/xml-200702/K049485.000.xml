<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable THE Earl of Jersey, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any thing may attone for the Liberty I take in offering this trifle to your Lordship, it is, that I will Engage not to be guilty of the Common Vice of Dedications, nor pre∣tend to give the World an account of the many good qualities they ought to admire in your Lordship. I hope I may reckon on it as some little piece of merit, in an age where there are so many people write Panegyricks, and so few deserve 'em. I am sure you ought not to sit for your Picture, to so ill a hand as mine. Men of your Lordship's Figure and Station, tho Useful and Ornamantal to the Age they live in, are yet reserv'd for the Labours of the Historian, and the Entertain∣ment of Posterity; nor ought to be aspers'd with such pieces of Flattery while living, as may render the true History sus∣pected
<PB REF="3"/>
to those that come after. That which should take up all my Care at present, is most humbly to beg your Lordships pardon for Importuning you upon this account; for imagin∣ing that your Lordship, (whose hours are all dedicated to the best and most important uses) can have any leisure for this piece of Poetry. I beg, my Lord, that you will receive it, as it was meant, a mark of my Entire Respect and Veneration.</P>
<P>I hope it may be some advantage to me, that the Town has not receiv'd this Play ill; to have depended meerly upon your Lordships good nature, and have offer'd something without any degree of merit, would have been an unpardonable fault, espe∣cially to so good a Judge. The Play it self, as I present it to your Lordship, is a much more perfect Poem than it is in the representation on the Stage. I was led into an Error in the writing of it, by thinking that it would be easier to retrench than to add: But when I was at last necessitated, by reason of the extreme length, to cut off near six hundred Lines, I found that it was maim'd by it to a great disadvantage. The Fable (which has no manner of relation to any part of true History,) was left dark and intricate, for want of a great part of the narration, which was left out in the first Scene; and the Chain and Connexion, which ought to be in the Dialogue, was inter∣rupted in many other places. But since what was omitted in the Acting, is now kept in, I hope it may indifferently Enter∣tain your Lordship at an unbending hour. The faults which are most generally found, (and which I could be very proud of submitting to your Lordship's Judgment, if you can have leisure for so trivial a cause,) are, that the Catastrophe in the fifth Act is barbarous, and shocks the Audience. Some people, whose Judgment I ought to have a deference for, have told me that they wisht I had given the latter part of the story quite another turn; that <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> and <HI>Amestris</HI> ought to have been preserv'd, and made happy in the Conclusion of the Play; that besides the satisfaction which the Spectators would have had to have seen two Vertuous (or at least Innocent) Characters, re∣warded and successful, there might have been also a more No∣ble and Instructive Moral drawn that way. I must confess if this be an Error, (as I perhaps it may,) it is a voluntary one
<PB REF="4"/>
and an Error of my Judgment: Since in the writing I actually made such a sort of an Objection to my self; and chose to wind up the story this way. Tragedies have been al∣low'd, I know, to be written both ways very beautifully. But since Terror and Pity are laid down for the Ends of Tragedy, by the great Master and Father of Criticism, I was always inclin'd to fancy, that the last and remaining Impressions, which ought to be left on the minds of an Audience, should proceed from one of these two. They should be struck with Terror in several parts of the Play, but always Conclude and go away with Pity, a sort of regret proceeding from good nature, which, tho an uneasiness, is not always disagreeable, to the person who feels it. It was this passion that the famous Mr <HI>Otway</HI> succeeded so well in touching, and must and will at all times affect people, who have any tenderness or humanity. If therefore I had sav'd <HI>Ar∣taxerxes</HI> and <HI>Amestris,</HI> I believe (with submission to my Judges) I had destroy'd the greatest occasion for Compassion in the whole Play. Any body may perceive, that she is rais'd to some degrees of happiness, by hearing that her Father and Husband are living, (whom she had suppos'd dead,) and by seeing the Enemy and Persecuter of her Family dying at her feet, purpose∣ly, that the turn of her death may be more surprizing and pitiful. As for that part of the Objection, which says, that Innocent persons ought not to be shewn unfortunate; The suc∣cess and general approbation, which many of the best Trage∣dies that have been writ, and which were built on that founda∣tion, have met with, will be sufficient answer for me.</P>
<P>That which they call the Poetical Justice, is, I think, strictly observ'd, the two principal Contrivers of Evil, the Statesman and Priest, are punish'd with death; and the Queen is depos'd from her authority by her own Son; which, I suppose, will be allowed as the severest mortification that could happen to a woman of her Imperious temper.</P>
<P>If there can be any excuse for my Entertaining your Lordship with this <HI>Detail</HI> of Criticisms, it is, That I would have this first mark of the honour I have for your Lordship appear with as few faults as possible. Did not the prevailing Character of your Lordship's Excellent humanity and good nature encourage
<PB REF="5"/>
me, what ought I not to fear from the niceness of your Taste and Judgment? The delicacy of your reflexions may be very satal to so rough a Draught as this is; but if I will believe, (as I am sure I ought to do) all men that I have heard speak of your Lordship, they bid me hope every thing from your Good∣ness. This is that I must sincerely own, which made me ex∣tremely Ambitious of your Lordship's Patronage for this Piece. I am but too sensible, that there are a multitude of faults in it; but since the good nature of the Town has cover'd, or not taken notice of 'em, I must have so much discretion, as not to look with an affected nicety into 'em my self. With all the Faults and Imperfections which it may have, I must own, I shall be yet very well satisfied with it, if it gives me an opportunity of reckoning my self from this time,</P>

<LG>
<L>IF Dying Lovers yet deserve a Tear,</L>
<L>If a sad story of a Maids despair,</L>
<L>Yet move Compassion in the pitying fair,</L>
<L>This day the Poet does his Art employ,</L>
<L>The soft accesses of your Souls to try.</L>
<L>Nor let the Stoick boast his mind unmov'd,</L>
<L>The Brute Philosopher, who ne're has prov'd</L>
<L>The Joy of Loving or of being Lov'd;</L>
<L>Who scorns his humane nature to confess,</L>
<L>And striving to be more than man, is less.</L>
<L>Nor let the men, the weeping fair accuse</L>
<L>Those kind protectors of the Tragick Muse,</L>
<L>Whose Tears did moving <HI>Otway</HI>'s labours crown,</L>
<L>And made the poor <HI>Monimia</HI>'s Grief their own:</L>
<L>Those Tears, their art, not weakness has confest,</L>
<L>Their Grief approv'd the niceness of their taste,</L>
<L>And they wept most, because they judg'd the best.</L>
<L>O cou'd this Age's Writers hope to find</L>
<L>An Audience to Compassion thus inclin'd,</L>
<L>The Stage would need no Farce, nor Song nor Dance,</L>
<L>Nor Capering Monsieur brought from Active <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Clinch</HI> and his Organ Pipe, his Dogs and Bear,</L>
<L>To native <HI>Barnet</HI> might again repair,</L>
<L>Or breathe with Captain <HI>Otter, Bankside</HI> Air.</L>
<L>Majestick Tragedy shou'd once agen</L>
<L>In Purple Pomp adorn the swelling Scene.</L>
<L>Her search shou'd ransack all the Ancient's store,</L>
<L>The Fortunes of their Loves and Arms explore,</L>
<L>Such as might grieve you, but shou'd please you more.</L>
<L>What <HI>Shakespear</HI> durst not, this bold Age shou'd do,</L>
<L>And famous <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latian</HI> Beauties show.</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Shakespear,</HI> whose Genius to its self a Law,</L>
<L>Cou'd men in every height of Nature draw,</L>
<L>And Copy'd all but women that he saw.</L>
<L>Those Ancient Heroines your concern shou'd move,</L>
<L>Their Grief and Anger much, but most their Love;</L>
<L>For in the account of every Age we find</L>
<L>The best and fairest of that Sex were kind,</L>
<L>To Pity always, and to Love inclin'd.</L>
<L>Assert, ye fair ones, who in Judgment sit,</L>
<L>Your Ancient Empire over Love and Wit;</L>
<L>Reform our Sense, and teach the men t' Obey,</L>
<L>They'll leave their Tumbling if you lead the way.</L>
<L>Be but what those before to <HI>Otway</HI> were;</L>
<L>O were you but as kind, we know you are as fair.</L>

<SPEAKER>Mirz.</SPEAKER>
<L>That fatal Beauty,</L>
<L>With most malignant influence, has crost</L>
<L>My first and great Ambition. When my Brother,</L>
<L>The great <HI>Cleander</HI> fell by <HI>Memnon</HI>'s hand,</L>
<L>(You know the story of our Houses quarrel)</L>
<L>I sought the King for Justice on the Murderer;</L>
<L>And to confirm my interest in the Court,</L>
<L>In confidence of mighty wealth and power,</L>
<L>A long descent from Noble Ancestors,</L>
<L>And somewhat of the Beauty of the Maid,</L>

<L>'Tis true, I did so; Nor was it in vain;</L>

<L><HI>Memnon</HI> was banisht, and the Prince disgrac'd</L>
<L>Went into Exile with him. Since that time,</L>
<L>Since I have been admitted to her Council,</L>
<L>And have seen her, with unerring judgment guide</L>
<L>The Reins of Empire, I have been amaz'd,</L>
<L>To see her more than manly strength of Soul,</L>

<L>Still arm'd against the uncertain turns of Chance,</L>
<L>Untoucht by any weakness of her Sex,</L>

<SPEAKER>Mirz.</SPEAKER>
<L>Certainly Fate,</L>
<L>Or somewhat like the force of Fate, was in it;</L>
<L>And still whene're remembrance sets that scene</L>
<L>Before my eyes, I view it with amazement.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>I then was young, a stranger to the Court,</L>
<L>And only took the story as reported</L>
<L>By different Fame, you must have known it better.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mirz.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed I did, then favour'd by the King,</L>
<L>And by that means a sharer in the secret.</L>
<L>'Twas on a day of publick Festival,</L>
<L>When Beauteous <HI>Artemisa</HI> stood to view,</L>
<L>Behind the Covert of a Golden Lattice,</L>
<L>When King and Court returning from the Temple;</L>
<L>When just as by her stand <HI>Arsaces</HI> past,</L>
<L>The Windows, by design or chance, fell down,</L>
<L>And to his view expos'd her blushing Beauties.</L>
<L>She seem'd surpriz'd, and presently withdrew,</L>
<L>But ev'n that moment was an age in Love;</L>
<L>So was the Monarchs heart for passion moulded,</L>
<L>So apt to take at first the soft impression.</L>
<L>Soon as we were alone, I found the Evil</L>
<L>Already past a Remedy, and vainly</L>
<L>Urg'd the resentment of her injur'd Lord:</L>
<L>His Love was deaf to all.</L>

<L>Joy of her Conquest, and the hopes of Greatness,</L>
<L>Gave Lustre to her Charms, and made her seem</L>
<L>Of more than mortal Excellence. In short,</L>
<L>After some faint resistance, like a Bride</L>
<L>That strives a while, tho eager for the bliss,</L>
<L>The furious King Enjoy'd her.</L>
<L>And to secure their Joys, a snare was laid</L>

For her unthinking Lord, in which he fell</L>
<L>Before the fame of this could reach his Ears.</L>
<L>Since that, she still has by successful Arts</L>
<L>Maintain'd that power, which first her beauty gain'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mag.</SPEAKER>
<L>With deepest foresight, wisely has she laid</L>
<L>A sure foundation of the future greatness</L>
<L>Of <HI>Artaban,</HI> her only darling Son.</L>
<L>Each busie thought, that rouls within her breast,</L>

<L>That was a point well gain'd; nor were the Eldership</L>

<L>If <HI>Memnon</HI>'s interest did not prop his Cause.</L>
<L>Since then they stand secur'd, by being joyn'd,</L>
<L>From reach of open force; it were a Masterpiece</L>
<L>Worthy a thinking head, to sow division</L>

This Palace and the Temple, with loud Out-cries,</L>

<L><HI>Orchanes,</HI> e're I fled to give you notice,</L>
<L>Fell by the Prince's hand, the raging Torrent</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qu.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ungrateful Rebel! Do thy impious Arms</L>
<L>Pursue me for my too indulgent Fondness</L>
<L>And Care for thee?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Artab.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well has that Care been shewn,</L>
<L>Have you not fouly stain'd my sacred Fame?</L>
<L>Look on that Scene of Blood; the dire Effects</L>
<L>Of cruel Female Arts. But oh! what Recompence;</L>
<L>What can you give me for my murder'd Love?</L>
<L>Has not the Labyrinth of your fatal Counsels</L>

<L>By our bright Gods I swear I will assert</L>

<L>Thy Father once the Hero of his Age,</L>
<L>Was proud to be the Subject of my Sway,</L>
<L>The Warrior of the Womans Wits gave way,</L>
<L>And found it was his Interest to obey.</L>

And dost thou hope to shake off my Command;</L>
<L>Dost thou? The Creature of my forming hand.</L>

<L>Let a Guard wait the Queen, tho' nature plead</L>

<SPEAKER>Clean.</SPEAKER>
<L>Already he has met the Fate he merited,</L>
<L>This night the Hypocrite in grand Procession</L>
<L>March'd thro' the City to appease the people,</L>

<L>THE Spleen and Vapours, and this doleful Play,</L>
<L>Have mortify'd me to that height to day,</L>
<L>That I am almost in the mortal Mind,</L>
<L>To die indeed, and leave you all behind.</L>
<L>Know then, since I resolve in Peace to part,</L>
<L>I mean to leave to one alone my Heart.</L>
<L>(Last Favours will admit of no <HI>Partage,</HI></L>
<L>I bar all sharing; but upon the Stage.)</L>
<L>To one who can with one alone be blest</L>
<L>The peaceful Monarch of a single Breast.</L>
<L>To One—but Oh! how hard 'twill be to find</L>
<L>That Pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix in your Fickle changing Kind!</L>
<L>New Loves, new Interests, and Religious new,</L>
<L>Still your Fantastick Appetites pursue.</L>
<L>Your sickly Fancies loath what you possess;</L>
<L>And every restless Fool would change his Place;</L>
<L>Some weary of their Peace, and quiet grown,</L>
<L>VVant to be hoisted up alost, and shown;</L>
<L>VVhilst from the envted height, the wise get safely down.</L>
<L>VVe find your wavering Temper to our Cost,</L>
<L>Since all our Pains and Care to please is lost.</L>

<L>Her Sister Poetry's declining head.</L>
<L>Show but a Mimick Ape, or <HI>French</HI> Buffoon,</L>
<L>You to the other House in Shoals are gone,</L>
<L>And leave us here to Tune our Crowds alone.</L>
<L><HI>Must</HI> Shakespear, Fletcher, <HI>and laborious</HI> Ben,</L>
<L>Be left for <HI>Scaramouch</HI> and <HI>Harlaquin?</HI></L>
<L>Allow you are unconstant; yet 'tis strange,</L>
<L>For Sense is still the same, and ne're can change;</L>
<L>Yet even in that you vary as the rest;</L>
<L>And every day New Notions are profest;</L>
<L>Nay there's a Wit has found, as I am told,</L>
<L>New ways to Heaven, dispairing of the Old,</L>

<L>What think you of the Project? I'm for trying,</L>
<L>I'll lay aside these foolish Thoughts of Dying;</L>
