<HEAD>THE
CASE
OF
Dissenters, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> use to glory in the wide Extent,
and pure Catholicism, of their Dominion; the
<HI>Italians,</HI> from a Pretension of Superior Politeness
and Sagacity, contemn all Tramontanes; the Mo∣dern
<HI>French</HI> make to themselves a daily Triumph of the
Successes of their Grand Monarch; why may not my
Countrymen as well exult, that the Laws, by which we
are governed, are no other than such, as our selves, by a
due Representative, have chosen? Oh happy <HI>England!</HI>
May thy People esteem, as it deserves, a Benefit so singu∣lar;
may that Noble Representative of thine, called to
be Guardians of this Blessing, never want Foresight to
discover, and Prudence to prevent, the Dangers which may
arise to threaten it.</P>
<P>The ordinary Method with us is well known to be,
that the Addition of new Laws, or Amendment of old ones,
are proposed first by the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> and im∣mediately
publick Notice given when the same are to
come under a solemn Debate; which being several times
adjourn'd, there arises Opportunity sufficient, for the Sub∣jects
from all Parts of the Kingdom, to communicate to the
respective Members of Parliament, their Opinion severally
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
thereupon; so that in this respect seldom any thing of
Importance is concluded concerning the good People of
<HI>England,</HI> without their own tacit Consent at least, over
and above the Benefit of their being represented in com∣mon.
Such being then the Case, we cannot celebrate
enough our Happiness; we may basely overlook, but once
to lose it, would be Misery to us beyond Expression.</P>
<P>'Tis frequent moreover, for our Laws to be made tem∣porary
first, till the Experiment of a few Years has re∣commended
them for perpetual. As for those of the
highest Concern, when the Benefits or Effects are liable
to Doubt, we have seen some Bills undergo the Scrutiny
of several succeeding Sessions of Parliament before they
passed the Signature of Authority. Sometimes also our
Courts of Legislature, when the Inducements and Rea∣sons
of a Bill were not obvious to common Eyes, or
at least liable to Misconstruction, have thought good to
lay the same before the Publick, that their tender Regards
of general Emolument might the better appear.</P>
<P>Having observ'd various Methods of our Propitious Le∣gislature,
an Instance of several of them, but more espe∣cially
the latter, we are here to consider, I mean the late
Bill for Preventing Occasional Conformity, which was so
differently apprehended in the last Session of Parliament,
as no Debates during it were able to reconcile; but that
Matter is of such Concern, that the Proceedings thereupon
being printed by Authority, it seems not unworthy eve∣ry
true Lover of his Country, to put the same into the best
Light possible, in order to frame a right Judgment, how a
Bill like unto that (if at any time hereafter such should
be proposed) may affect the Commonweal; seeing the O∣pinion
which shall prevail thereof, there can be no doubt,
will be duly weighed by our Representees; and because
one Intention of our Lawgivers, in publishing the Ac∣count
of their Proceedings upon that Bill, might be (not
improbably) the better to collect the common Judgment
on it, a Desire to be assistant unto that, with a Concern
lest unhappy Animosities should grow among us, did en∣gage
me to draw into a clear and familiar Method of Dis∣course,
what is very obvious touching that Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
The Bill, which is the designed Theme of what follows,
I understand such as it passed last Session the House of
Commons, with the several Amendments agreed afterwards,
touching which, that my Argument may be the more di∣stinct,
I take the Liberty to digest it under Three Heads,
which are easily discernable on reading the said Bill, <HI>viz.</HI>
The Preamble, Extent, and Penalties, due Reference being
had thereto; however, these few things ought to be pre∣mised,
<HI>First,</HI> That the whole of it is Prudential and Politi∣cal,
not censuring directly the Persons and Cause of the
Dissenters beyond the Point of bearing Offices, nor inter∣dicting
any to be present at their Assemblies, except such
as are engaged in the Magistracy, or Places of Trust, there∣by
leaving the Matter of Conscience as it stood before.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> The Communion of the Lord's Supper is consi∣dered
herein as a Discrimination meerly civil; so that tho'
Papists and Protestant Dissenters are excluded from Offices
thereby, yet is there no Provision by the Law to render the
same a Barr to the Prophane and Scandalous; which is a
Consideration seems to concern the Honour of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the good Administration of the se∣veral
Trusts, to which it initiates: But because, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Se∣veral
Cases in Religion might be reducible under the Sub∣ject
of this Bill, I shall comply with the obvious Intenti∣on
of our Lawgivers, and confine my Discourse as much
as may be to a Secular Vein. To proceed therefore to the
Bill.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Touching the Preamble of it, it were not easie, per∣adventure,
in so few Words, for our Supreme Governors
to have given more Satisfaction to scrupulous Consciences
than in the Religious Declaration, that serves as an Introdu∣ction
here; because therein the Sense of the present Go∣vernment
appears, that those Severities, under which the
Dissenters groaned, before the late Act of Indulgence, <HI>were
then to be deem'd Persecution for Conscience sake;</HI> under
which Acceptation it is, that their Exemption from them
for the future (unless new Matter of Secular Offence to
the Government arises) is to stand upon Foundations no
less safe, than <HI>the Profession of the Christian Religion, and
particularly the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England. This
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
is the highest Attestation can be, that the Dissenters
are no longer to be look'd upon <HI>obnoxious to the Church
and State, or chargeable with Schism, Sedition and Rebelli∣on,</HI>
as the former Laws (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow suspended) did insist they
were; so that the Reason given by those Laws ceasing,
<HI>and since it is on all Hands agreed, great Advantages have
accrued from the Act of Indulgence,</HI> they may henceforth
expect, with the rest of their Fellow-Subjects, to partake
the Serenity and Benignity of a Government, which in all
other things ever was, and now is, the most clement under
the Sun. Thus is the Bond of engaging Goodness laid upon
them for ever; so that as since the late Glorious Revolu∣tion
they are found equally affectionate as others, to the
Interests and Settlement of the Crown, all the former stig∣matizing
Brands upon them are done away.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Recital of the present State of Law, which fol∣lows
the Religious Declaration,</HI> (that it provides already,
every Person admitted into any Office, should be conforma∣ble
to the Church) <HI>the Words of it cannot be taken in the
strictest Sense,</HI> there being many Offices and Employments,
to which Persons have been, and may be now, admitted,
without lying under an Obligation to receive the Sacrament,
or be conformable on that Account: For instance, Offices of
Inheritance, and in the Forests, Non-Commission Offices in the
Fleet, with many more; <HI>therefore what is asserted in this
Paragraph in the general, we must understand</HI> to relate to
such Persons and Offices only as are subsequently mention'd
in the Bill; but if those who break the Intention of a Law,
break the Law, it were fit and desireable that no Words
(if possible) might be used in any, which in the Sequel may
lead Men into Mistakes, touching that Intention.</P>
<P>The last Clause of the Preamble gives a very just Descrip∣tion
of the Case, which the Bill is designed to bring a Re∣medy
for; that is to say, <HI>No Man ordinarily frequenting
private Meetings, should qualifie himself for an Office, by re∣ceiving
only on that Account the Sacrament with the Church.</HI>
Now that nothing however be understood beyond the natu∣ral
Sense of the Words thereof, I take these Two Things
not to be absolutely concluded in them. <HI>First,</HI> That whilst
Conforming only for a Place has a Brand of Scandal affixed
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
on it; yet it does not follow that Occasional Conformity
otherwise (without such Design) ought to be reproach'd; for
as to such Persons, who join themselves to their Christian So∣cieties
severally, as taking the Conduct of them to be most
agreeable to the Word of God, and because it pleases the
Soveraign Spirit of Grace to co-operate more evidently up∣on
them therein, for such to go sometimes to a Divine
Service, different from what they frequent and chuse, is
an Expression of Charity to others, and ought not therefore
to be blamed. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It can no Ways be taken for con∣cluded,
that a Censure upon the Conformity in this Bill
mention'd, does imply <HI>going to a Meeting to be</HI> malum in
se, <HI>or savouring of Faction, or Criminal, Illegal, and Schis∣matical,</HI>
as the superceded Laws did constantly assert; for
the mention of it, as allowed by Law, does demonstrate
the contrary; the manifest and primary Purpose of this
Bill being rather to keep Dissenters from the Church,
than others from a Meeting; however, the mutual Free∣dom
in this Point, to the great Glory of our Times, sa∣vours
of that charitable Moderation, so remarkably emi∣nent
in the Primitive Ages of Christianity, as to occasion
those Universal Laws in the <HI>Creed,</HI> for every one <HI>to be∣lieve
the Holy Catholick Church, and the Communion of
Saints.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The enacting Part of this Bill, I term the
Extent of it, because it describes both the Crime and the
Offices thereby to be affected, whereof distinctly; first
then for the Crime, the Definition of it herein is the same
with that <HI>in Two several Acts, to prevent and suppress
Seditious Conventicles;</HI> and 16 and 22 <HI>Car.</HI> II. so that
what was criminal by them to all Persons, becomes a∣gain
so by this Bill to those in Office; the Qualifica∣tion
for Offices by express Terms of Law required at
present, is, in this respect, no more than once previously
to receive the Sacrament with the Church; but the Con∣formity
which would be required herein, is, (besides that) <HI>ne∣ver,
after once taking an Office, to be present at any Conventi∣cle
or Meeting, under Colour or Pretence of any Exercise of Re∣ligion,
in other manner than according to the Liturgy and Pra∣ctice
of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>where Five (more than the Family)
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
shall be.</HI> This is a sort of Qualification for Offices widely
different (as any may see) from what the Law requires
now; and we must observe, that throughout the Bill such
Terms are only used as have been commonly appropriated
to Protestant Dissenters; however, to be present at Mass is
tacitly included.</P>
<P>We do not go about to intimate, That the Injunctions of
the Law at present, <HI>to receive the Sacrament according
to the Rites and Usage of the Church,</HI> do not in the pri∣mary
Meaning of them imply, that the Persons ought to
be of that Communion; however, none can deny, but they
will very well bear a larger Sence also; whereby none
ought to be excluded Offices, who can give a publick Te∣stimony
they esteem a Communion with the Church law∣ful;
which latter Acceptation of the Laws, though the
generality of Dissenters stand Excluded by it, has all along,
for 40 Years past, brought into the Service of the Go∣vernment
(without very visible, ruinous, Effects) no inconsi∣derable
Number of Men, whom the proposed Bill in all
Appearance would finally render incapable.</P>
<P>Whether it may be for the publick Benefit any longer
to suffer the same Latitude in reference to Dissenters,
belongs only to the Supreme Powers to judge; but grant∣ing
here that it were not, we do with all Humility of∣fer
to Consideration, whether <HI>gentler Methods be not more
agreeable to the English Temper, Constitution of Govern∣ment;
nay, and the Interest of State, so the End may be
duly attained;</HI> in the Case then before us, if the Govern∣ment
for Example should require from the establish'd
Church, instead of one previous Communion (which is all
in the Law express'd) that Men in Office should attend
Four times Yearly, or oftner, at the Sacrament, would it
not be equal Security to the State, and greatly for the
Honour of the Church, but give no Matter of Offence
or Jealousie to Dissenters? Whereas if the Qualification
for Offices is to consist not so much in frequent and de∣vout
Attendance on the publick Celebrations, as in a Di∣stance
and Aversion to Dissenters, <HI>this cannot but minister
just Cause of Fear, that those Assemblies, at which once to be
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
present, exposes to so great a Censure, are not likely to
continue long allowed by Law.</HI></P>
<P>No Man can doubt but a Censure of this kind would
prove <HI>a Notorious Mark of Infamy upon the Assemblies of
Dissenters,</HI> and in that respect would affect them beyond
the Case of Officers; and the revived Definition of a Con∣venticle,
being <HI>under the Pretence and Colour of the Exer∣cise
of Religion,</HI> (it deserves to be consider'd) whether it
might not be construed to allude to, and imply, somewhat
of those dangerous Practices the Suspended Laws have
connected with the said Definition; but there are other
obvious Inconveniencies in this new Method of Qualifica∣tion,
for it would expose more a great deal than the pre∣sent
Way (as will be shewn elsewhere) to the predatory
Mercy of Informers; it debarrs the common natural Re∣spects
of Relations, in Baptisms, Funeral Sermons, and
the like: <HI>It casts a hazardous Discouragement upon Family
Prayer, whereat often, among Persons of Quality, and some∣times
others, more than Five may happen to be present;
and it brings all Foreign Churches under a Censure too;
whereas the Act of Uniformity provides, that the Penalties
thereof should not extend to any Reformed Churches of
Aliens, allowed, or to be allowed, by His Majesty or His
Successors; some such have since had Encouragement for
their Settlement from Parliament, and have proved bene∣ficial
in Manufactures to this Kingdom, toward which
their Liberty of Conscience, without Reflection, has not a
little contributed.</HI></P>
<P>The second Distinction I have made of the Extent (or
enacting Part, of this Bill) is of the Offices intended by it
to be affected, which clearly falls under a twofold Defi∣nition,
one the same with that in the Act, 25 <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For
preventing Dangers which may happen from Popish Recu∣sants;</HI>
the other of the 13 of <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For well governing
and regulating Corporations.</HI> Now because this seems the
most tender and sensible Part of the Bill, most liable to
Mistake, and upon the right Apprehension whereof our
Judgment of the whole must very much depend; before
I descend into a Disquisition of it, I beg leave to deviate
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
a little from the just Method of Discourse; and therefore
before I endeavour to prove what the Bill, under this Head,
would have enacted—new, I will first lay down and
consider the Reasons commonly alledg'd, why the same
ought to be.</P>
<P>What is commonly alledg'd, as the Ground of the new
Provisions in this Bill, amounts to thus much; that a
National Church being absolutely needful to a Govern∣ment,
the only effectual Way to preserve it, is by keep∣ing
the Civil Power in the Hands of such whose Pra∣ctice
and Principles are agreeable thereto; and that this
is equally necessary to the Safety and Peace of the State
likewise; but say they, the present Laws proving too
weak to secure those Blessings, because they are eluded
by Occasional Conformity, therefore there wants some new
Expedients to support them; these Maxims we can readily
grant; so far as the Security and Peace of the State ap∣pear
undoubtedly concern'd, so much is allowed on all
Hands for incontestible; but the Matter in question be∣fore
us seems to be, whether Occasional Conformity of
Dissenters has really endanger'd the Safety, and violated
the Peace, of Church and State? Or has any Principles in
it disagreeable therewith? Which Matter cannot yet be
taken for concluded, as the Proceedings of Parliament
publish'd do evince, and whereof therefore the present
Juncture and Occasion gives Liberty to speak.</P>
<P>In order to examine then this Matter aright, we think
proper to distinguish the Relation which the Occasional
Conformity of Dissenters may bear to the Church and
State severally; first therefore in Reference to the State,
<HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> (it may be agreed to us) <HI>is no new
thing, but even Coaeval with the Act of Uniformity it
self; so that in 40 Years Experience, if it were evi∣dent
that Injuries to the Peace of the Government had
arose thence, how came it to pass they should be overlookt
so long?</HI> But while several Ways were taken to enjoin
Conformity, how Occasional soever, it was in no kind
before made Penal to approve it, tho' thereby Offices
were attained; after such a large Attestation from Fact,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
it would be needless to say, Occasional Conformity of
Dissenters has in it self no Principles dangerous to the
Peace of the Government, if there were not another
sort of Conformity which does obstinately maintain such
as withdraw Men from their Allegiance to Her Gracious
Majesty, and from all Respect to the present Establish∣ment
of the Crown; but as to Principles, further than
is obvious from Practice, it is not my proper Province to
discourse, that being already sufficiently treated of by Di∣vines.</P>
<P>If
the Time past has not produced a Necessity of any
new Provision against Accidental or Occasional Conformi∣ty,
I think we may be confident the present much less
does; for if the Laws already in being do intend that
Men in Office should be entirely conformable, Her Gra∣cious
Majesty has assured all the World there can be no
Danger from Occasional Conformity in this Auspicious
Reign, by these Words of Her last Speech to the Parliament;
<HI>I shall always make it my particular Care to Encourage
and Maintain this Church as by Law establish'd, and eve∣ry
the least Member of it, in all their Just Rights and
Priviledges.</HI> And now having deliver'd my Sentiment,
upon Observations of the past and present Time, to go
further would be to wade into the Politicks beyond my
Depth. I can say nothing certain of Futurity; but since
the Dissenters are known, beyond doubt, to be very cor∣dially
affected to the Protestant Succession, methinks
whatever Qualifications may be judged requisite for Pla∣ces
of Magistracy and Publick Trust, they may well ex∣pect
(beyond a Provision for that) no Hardships will be
laid upon them now.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> To consider Occasional Conformity in Reference
to the Church, it might suffice to say, the Affairs of it
(distinct from those of the State) do no Ways lye un∣der
the Cognizance of such, whom that may vest with
Government; but for what properly concerns the Honour
and Welfare of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the first Words
of this Bill do imply, that her greatest Glory consists in
the Character of Moderation, Sweetness, and Charity,
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
truly Christian and Apostolick, and very justly, for this
would recommend her to all the Reformed Churches of
<HI>Christendom,</HI> as worthy to be acknowledg'd their Chief
and Best. <HI>In the Reign of Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>all the Pa∣pists
in</HI> England <HI>came to Church, and were Occasional Con∣formists,
yet the Government was not Uneasie, and in Dan∣ger,
by it; but the Pope fearing what that was like soon
to grow to, put a Stop to it by Bull, and the Church of</HI>
Rome <HI>does generally to this Day encourage every thing
like to Occasional Conformity of Protestants; and the Ef∣fects
shew they are in the right, and gain their Ends by
it.</HI> In like manner, can it be thought that the Church
has <HI>gained from any sort of the Dissenters among us, as
from those who have allowed and practiced an Occasional
Conformity with her? Has she not, by permitting it, obtained
many useful and worthy Members? Does not the Practice
of it weaken the Dissenters, and encrease her Reputation
and Authority?</HI> Where then has been the Damage to
the Church from Occasional Conformity? It would be
difficult to shew what Security, Honour or Interest, she
hast lost, during the greatest Indulgence to Dissenters in
the late Reign, of any thing she possess'd before that
time, during the unspeakable Sufferings of others; there∣fore
it must be an Accession of Honour and Safety unto
her, that she is now by Clemency become reverenced of
those who formerly were suspected for her Enemies.</P>
<P>Having thus made Enquiry, what Reason there is to
apprehend that the Safety of the Church and State has
been, or is, endanger'd by the Latitude allowed to Dis∣senters,
from the present Condition of the Laws; I pro∣ceed,
according to promise, to enquire what Alteration
would arise on the Head of Offices from the Bill now
under Consideration; which I shall do in Two Denomi∣nations
of them; I mean those comprehended in the Test
Act, and those peculiarly affected by that for regulating
Corporations; premising here only, that the Offices of
the latter sort, which do directly fall within the Test,
I judge better to consider in that Denomination, because
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
thereby what remains will be more distinct and intelli∣gible,
when we handle it apart.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> For the Test Clause, which is the former in this
part of the Bill, without reciting the Words of it, we
may be allowed to say upon good Authority, <HI>That ma∣nifestly
and indisputably it does comprehend all the consi∣derable
Offices and Imployments of Publick Trust in the
Kingdom, in which the Security of the Government may
be concerned; the Experience of 30 Years past has justi∣fied
the Measures taken by that Law, that it is exten∣sive
enough as to the several sorts of Offices for Publick
Security; the Terms of it are express, clear, and univer∣sally,
understood, without any Uncertainty as to what Im∣ployments
it relates, which is not so evident in those of
the Corporation Act; the said Act includes all Offices of
Magistracy, in especial, as well within Corporations as
without; and at the enacting of it there was little Regard
had to the Act for Regulating Corporations, because a
more effectual Security to the Church was given hereby.</HI>
It cannot be taxed as insufficient to compass the End de∣signed
by it, which was expresly to prevent Dangers
that might happen from Popish Recusants, and to ex∣clude
from Offices all others who will not take the
Sacrament according to the Usage of the Church esta∣blisht.
After this Manner, and in a due Medium, as would
be easie in another sort of Discourse, to make appear the
Safety and Peace of Church and State, have been fully
provided for; nor have the Measures of it to procure
those been any Ways (in particular the Penalties) found
deficient.</P>
<P>This Act being so extensive and compleat, that it
reaches whatever Offices concern the Safety of the Go∣vernment,
and is not deficient in any Means to attain
its End. If Dangers should from Occasional Conformity
arise, it were easie at any time to enjoin such Frequen∣cy
at the Publick Offices of the Church, as might deno∣minate
an entire Conformist, without a Brand upon sepa∣rate
Assemblies, to raise again the Seeds of Fatal Ani∣mosities;
but as to the Places of Magistracy and Pub∣lick
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
Trust, already comprehended in the Test, as they
concern the Security of State much more, so they affect
the Body of Dissenters much less, than those in the Cor∣porations;
for which Cause, what is to be said in their
Behalf is more properly referr'd to that Head. It would also
be very unbecoming any sort of Men to enter into Ar∣gument
with their Governors upon those high Points,
which are so absolutely in the Legislature to judge of
and determine; 'tis not fit for me so much as to offer an
Opinion: An Explanation of the Test, more to the Disad∣vantage
of Dissenters, might indeed deprive several of
some profitable Places, in the Royal Houshold, the Ex∣chequer,
the Navy, the Excise, the Customs, and else∣where;
but the Magistracy of the City would be the
chief Import of this Matter; concerning which, what
Inconveniences have arose to the Government from the
Course of Things for near 20 Years past there, and how
an Alteration in it will any Ways tend to the Advantage
of the State, is equally to me undiscernable; but this I
do adventure to say, that if Men, whom the Negative
Qualification of this Bill would have rendred incapable
to serve in such Offices, should have been finable never∣theless
for not serving them, and that <HI>toties quoties,</HI> as
the Humour of the World might lead, that sort of Per∣secution
might possibly rise pretty high.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> It remains to examine what the proposed Bill
would have introduced <HI>de novo,</HI> upon the Head of the
Corporation Act distinctly; the Clause whereof, expressive
of the Offices it would affect, is in these Words: <HI>Any
Mayor, Alderman, Recorder, Bayliff, Town-Clerk, Common-Coun∣cil-man,
or other Person, bearing any Office of Magistracy,
or Places, or Trusts, or other Imployment, relating to, or
concerning, the Government of the respective Cities, Cor∣porations,
Boroughs, Cinque-Ports, and their Members, and
other Port-Towns.</HI> As to so much hereof as concerns
Magistracy, the Test Act having better provided, my Dis∣course
is to be henceforth restrained to what herein
touches only the Intrinsick and Inferior Imployments, re∣lating
to the several Boroughs respectively, wherein the
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
Security of the Church and State does not seem to be
much concerned.</P>
<P><HI>Most of our Laws have sprung from the evident Necessities
of the Times, and so came in as Remedies to the pro∣per
Distempers of them, which is in none more apparent
than this of the Corporations the</HI> 13. Car. II. Those de∣plorable
Confusions which had tormented the Nation, for
nigh 20 Years preceeding, lay fresh upon the Minds of the
Parliament, when that Act was made; and 'tis evident
that nothing but so extraordinary a Juncture could have
excused some Parts of it: Nay, it was principally found∣ed
upon Reasons so peculiar to that time, they are sar
from being pertinent to ours, for there is now no solemn
League and Covenant needs to be renounced; the Decla∣ration
in it, that it is not lawful, upon any Pretence what∣soever,
to take up Arms against the King, and of Abhor∣rence
of that traiterous Position of doing so by his Autho∣rity
against his Person, or those commission'd by him,
(<HI>which was the Touchstone of the said Act and Times</HI>)
is now utterly abrogated, and no Person henceforth can be
obliged to take the same, as appears in the Act <HI>Primo W.</HI>
and <HI>M.</HI> for appointing other Oaths; the Oaths of Supre∣macy
and Allegiance therein are also chang'd; the Power
given by it to the Crown, to Constitute Commissioners for
Two Years to turn out, and put in the Corporation Offi∣cers
<HI>ad libitum,</HI> though they were conformable to the Qua∣lifications
required by the Act, was an Extravagance the
present Age would scarce approve; the Preamble speaks
of it as a thing too well known, that notwithstanding His
Majesties unparallell'd Goodness, in pardoning what was
past, there were many evil Spirits still working. <HI>We do
not therefore herein go about to censure the Measures of that
Act, as they were suted to the Juncture; but as the
Reasons, the Jealousies and Foundations, whereon that
Act was built, were so appropriate to that time, that the se∣veral
Parts of it here above mention'd (as unsuitable to
any other) are since abolish'd. It is pretty clear that the
primary Intent thereof had its full and due Effect from
the Commissioners Power, and the Imposition of renoun∣cing
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
the Covenant and Declaration of Fidelity,</HI> for there
was little regard had to it at the time that a more effectual
Security to the Church was provided by the Test.</P>
<P>We come therefore to consider in the next Place, what
remains yet unrazed of that Act in 13. <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>for well
governing and regulating Corporations;</HI> and then will clear∣ly
be discern'd what the proposed Bill would have su∣peradded,
touching the Offices of Magistracy, the Test
Act has much better and effectually provided, which has
been already consider'd; and therefore as to what is di∣stinctly
under my present Head of Discourse to be treated
of, there remains in Substance of the Corporation Act yet
in Force no more than this, <HI>That no Man shall be Pla∣ced,
Elected or Chosen in or to any Offices, or Places, or
Trusts, or other Imployment relating to, or concerning the
Government of the respective Boroughs,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>who has not
within One Year before such Election taken the Sacrament
according to the Rites of the Church of</HI> England; <HI>in De∣fault
whereof every such Election is thereby declared to
be void.</HI> This being the full Import of the said Act at pre∣sent,
it is upon that Foot a Measure must be taken, what
and how much the intended Bill would have enacted
new upon this Head; it cannot be amiss here to observe,
that the Corporation Act was the first after the Restaura∣tion,
which directly affected the Dissenters as such.</P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> in Corporations there are many Offices of a pri∣vate
and inferior Nature, (<HI>which cannot be fully speci∣fied,
because they are so various in the respective Boroughs</HI>)
whereon the Safety of the State does not appear manifestly
to depend, but regard only the Affairs of the particular Town
within it self. Some of these are Freeholds, and many of
them the whole Subsistence of Families, which have been
obtained by Purchase or long Services, or attained by Cu∣stom
of Course. Several of these the Dissenters are now
possess'd of, and perhaps have enjoyed many Years, under an
Obedience to all such Terms, as the Law now in being has
prescribed; and to dispoil Men of their Freeholds and
Possessions by a new Law, without Imputation of any
Crime; and when the Security of the Government does not
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
appear manifestly concern'd, is sure among English Alen very
hard.</P>
<P>That the Dissenters at this Day are not Disaffected to
the Queen and Establish'd Government, nor chargea∣ble
with Rebellion past, nor meditating new Troubles, or
any ways dangerous to the State, (under which Characters
the Corporation-Act consider'd them) the Preamble of this
very Bill now in Debate does intimate: For it asserts,
That <HI>the Act in the first Year of the Reign of the late
King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>of Ever-glorious Memory,
entituled, An Act for Exempting Their Majesties Protestant
Subjects, Dissenting from the Church of</HI> England, <HI>from the
Penalties of certain Laws, was in due Consideration, that
Persecution for Conscience only was contrary to the Profes∣sion
of the Christian Religion and Doctrine of the Church of</HI>
England.</P>
<P><HI>If then the Dissenters under an Obedience to all such Terms
as the Law now in being has prescribed,</HI> do possess many
inferior Offices in Corporations, which the present Bill,
when passed into an Act, would immediately seclude from;
besides those in the Magistracy, the Navy, the Customs,
the Excise, the Royal Houshold, and others, which under
the Head of the Test-Act it would also deprive them of, then
(sure enough) it takes from the Dissenters, what they en∣joyed
before by Law, and is not this to enact something
new? <HI>Moreover, the Dissenters at any time, upon the pre∣sent
Terms of Conforming, are now admittable to any Office
of what Quality soever in the Kingdom; but by this Bill they
would have a total Incapacity put upon them, in respect to
those under the Test and Corporation Acts above-mentioned.</HI>
Which Incapacity after the first Offence would extend to
Offices of Inheritance, and in the Forests, Non Commission
Offices in the Fleet, and many more, such as neither the
Test or Corporation-Acts, or any other, ever did, or in∣tended
to exclude them from.</P>
<P>It has been already insisted, That <HI>all the Offices wherein
the Safety of Church and State are manifestly concern'd,
are comprehended within the Test,</HI> and that the inferior Of∣fices
in the Boroughs do not come under the same Considera∣tions;
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
to have therefore the same Reasons of State urged
for an equal Animadversion upon the latter, seems very
unequal; for it brings great Difficulty on the Commercial
Sort of Men, to argue on those Topicks, while they plead
for no more than quiet Cohabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation with their Neighbours.
But if it be argued, that those poor Emolumen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the
Boroughs, which the Safety of the Government might
(doubtless) well enough indulge them, came within the In∣tent
at least of the Corporation-Act to deny to the Dissenters,
how should they judge of it but very severe, to have that
Act so explained and enforced to their Disadvantage, that
it should take Place more in the Reign of Her Gracious Ma∣jesty
than it has done in any time preceding?</P>
<P>In this Case the Dissenters do humbly apologize for
themselves (as it imports them) that granting whatever was
designed by this Bill, was the Intent then of the Corporati∣on-Act,
they do not now stand in the same Place the last
Age did at the passing thereof; the present Generation it
cannot be pretended have brought upon the Church and
State, Confusions, Ruin and Desolation; they have no Ways
disturbed the Peace of either, but have <HI>by Testimonies in∣contestible
shew'd, that neither their Principles or Practice
are inconsistent with Monarchy, but contrariwise most conform∣able
to the present Government and Settlement of the Crown,
nor are there any evil Spirits working of Rebellion among
them.</HI> If therefore the Intent of the Corporation-Act was
built upon Reasons peculiar to that time, they do en∣tirely
submit it to Consideration, whether a pursuing of the
same Intent now, and giving (by the negative Qualification
and Penalties of this Bill) an Extent and Force to it, which
in the Institution, or fince it never had before, without any
like Cause on their Part, would not be in the Nature of
punishing the Innocent for the sake of the Guilty, which
they do not doubt will be far from so Wise, Just and Good
a Government; but the proposed Bill they conceive upon the
Head only of the Corporation-Act, would have brought
upon them the extraordinary Hardships and Difficulties
here following.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19"/>
1<HI>st,</HI> The Qualification for Offices being made to consist
in the utmost Distance and Aversion unto them, will be a
Brand of Ignominy and Reproach upon the whole Body of
Dissenters, so that an Emulation in casting Injuries and Con∣tempt
upon them may in a little time be thought the best
Recommendation, and nearest Way to Preferment; is it
just therefore that the whole Body should suffer for the
sake comparatively of a very few, who have occasionally
Conformed?</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Reviving the Acts against Seditious Conventicles
in part, and giving a new Force to that of the Corpora∣tions,
they fear will give too much Occasion to Men of
violent Tempers, to declaim that they lye still under the
same odious Imputations of Disloyalty charged upon them
by those Acts, as if they gave really any manner of Jea∣lousie
to the State now; which Clamour (however cause∣less)
when it shall be industriously vented, would be in it
self a very heavy Affliction.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly, The Freeholds and Offices of an inferiour Nature,</HI>
in 600 Towns of <HI>England,</HI> or thereabouts, <HI>which have been
obtained by Purchase or long Services, or in Course, some
of them the whole Subsistence of Families, and of long time
possess'd, under an Obedience to all the Terms prescribed
by Law,</HI> would not only be immediately lost to the Posses∣sors,
but an Incapacity would lye upon all Dissenters for
the future of attaining the like, and (after the first Offence)
any other Offices in the Kingdom whatsoever; but they
hope <HI>the Crime charged upon some few of them, is not of
so detestable a Nature, that they ought all to be reduced to so
unhappy a Condition for it.</HI></P>
<P>4<HI>thly, In many Corporations the Election of Members to
serve in Parliament, is only in such as are concern'd in
the Government of them, and giving a Vote for a Representa∣tive
in Parliament, is the essential Privilege whereby every En∣glishman
preserves his Property, and whatsoever deprives
him of a Capacity for having such Vote, deprives him of
his Birthright.</HI> The Magistracy of Corporations, which by
the Test-Act now takes Place is one thing, but the Offices
affected by the new Bill would be quite another.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/>
5<HI>thly,</HI> There have been for several Towns and Cities
Acts passed of late Years, for setting the Poor on Work
therein, and punishing Vagrants, besides the former ancient
Hospitals; touching which the Dissenters are likely by this
Bill to have been excluded the appearing usefully in their
Places, which is a Mark of Dishonour on them, as well as
Discouragement to charitable Intentions.</P>
<P>6thly, To leave Protestant Dissenters subject to Fines and
Penalties, if they do not accept Offices (<HI>toties quoties</HI>) and
at the same time if they do accept, to restrain them upon
the severe Penalties of this Bill from doing what their Con∣science
obliges to, whether this would not (<HI>against the In∣tent
of the Bill</HI>) be Persecution for Conscience sake, <HI>all good
Men might be left to judge, but they only would feel,
and every Borough in</HI> England <HI>at Discretion be left to pro∣portion
the Degree.</HI></P>
<P>7<HI>thly,</HI> The Dissenters have Reason to fear innumerable In∣juries
and Oppressions (besides these mention'd) would be
their Lot, in all municipal Rates, Freedoms, Duties, Pri∣vileges,
Services, Parish-Offices, and every sort of Inter∣course
with their Townsmen and Neighbours. When upon
Complaint of any such Injuries those Fellow-Citizens, who
only have Power to do them Justice, are like to suffer in
their own Reputations, Interests and Employments for so do∣ing,
as Favourers of the phanatical, excluded, Party.</P>
<P>These Considerations of their suffering, though they ap∣pear
evident and unavoidable, are with all Candor and Re∣signation
referr'd to the Judgment of others; but the Dis∣senters
must crave Leave to add, that they would be the
more pungent and sensible upon Persons not chargeable by
the Bill with any Offence, because without Penal Laws and
their Attendants, with the clamorous Insults of the Pro∣phane
and designing, the very dissenting from the Pub∣lick,
is in it self (as to earthly Things) many ways a Mis∣fortune,
which nothing but unpretended Conscience (how∣ever
mistaken) would oblige them to.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Penalties, which are the last Part of the
Bill, shall be consider'd under Three Heads. 1<HI>st,</HI> What
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
Sutableness there is in them to the Act of Indulgence.
2<HI>dly,</HI> What Proportion between the Protestant Dissenters
and Popish. 3<HI>dly,</HI> What Danger from thence to the Inno∣cent.</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI>
For the Sutableness there is in these Penalties to
the Act of Indulgence; it may sure be granted, that <HI>the
good Effects of Liberty to tender Consciences are every∣where
visible, that the foregoing Bitterness and Animosities
are much calmed, the Dissenters brought to a Temper of Re∣spect,
and more Candor towards the Church, and the Church
satisfied by sufficient Experience, that the Freedom of others
does not lessen Her Security and Reputation. Thus is our</HI>
Sion <HI>at Unity within Her self, and the Unity of the Spi∣rit
in the Bond of Peace (according to the Prayer of our
Church) preserv'd.</HI> One cannot therefore lay to Heart the
Peace of our <HI>Jerusalem</HI> without some Concern, lest the
Severities of this Bill should contribute to disturb it;
for besides that it would dispossess immediately Persons
legally vested with Places, and affect many Offices which
no Law did before, and many ways be injurious in the
Boroughs, and leave Men to occasional Persecution for
Conscience sake, and be a Brand upon all the Assemblies
of Dissenters, as already has been instanced, there are in it
some further Peculiarities of Punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Before the Act of Indulgence, while Conventicles were Il∣legal
and Criminal Assemblies, even then a Man in Office,
who was present at them, was only liable to a
Fine of Ten Pounds, whereas by this Bill he is liable to
a Fine of 100 l. and 5 l.</HI> per Diem <HI>for Three Months, be∣sides
Loss of his Place.</HI> The Sum you see may amount
to 550 l. which is more than would need to beggar some
Thousands of Corporation; and other Officers in <HI>England,</HI>
whould be liable to it, and the more in Danger, because
the whole Sum goes to the Informer, which is good Booty
for that sort of Privateers; and the rather, when a Con∣viction
on this Bill, would not be so difficult, as in most
other Cases.</P>
<P>The Dissenters during the worst of their Prosecutions here∣tofore,
upon a visible Conformity, without Renunciation or
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
declared Abhorrence of their former Practice, were at any
time capable of Places of Profit and Trust, but this Bill
draws over all their Heads a dismal Cloud of Incapacity.
<HI>None will deny but a total Incapacity to serve his Prince and
Country is a Mark of high Infamy, so that next to the Loss of
Life it seems the heaviest Punishment, and in the several
Towns Corporate of</HI> England (which may probably be 6 or
700) <HI>to be rendred by Law incapable, of ever acquiring
the Support of any of those little Places which appertain
to them, besides those of Profit under the Head of the Test-Act,
and those many more (upon Conviction) which no Law
yet has ever affected, is altogether</HI> (if consider'd) <HI>a very
unhapyy Condition; but after the immediate Forfeiture of
all the several Offices, now legally possess'd by the Dissen∣ters,
upon the Passing of this Bill, then a Person might
still go to a Meeting, without Breach of any Law (as long
as the Toleration continues</HI>) and one would think such a
Man were <HI>bonus &amp; legalis homo,</HI> and capable of the Pri∣vileges
of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree-born Subject, and at Liberty to provide
for his Family and Maintainance, but to impose a severe
Censure on any Action allowed by Law, seems very un∣reasonable;
however that be, there would remain upon
all and every Man of the Dissenters, an Incapacity not
only as above, but (after the first Offence) for any Office
or Imployment whatsoever within the Kingdom, in which
Regard this Bill would extend to Offices of Inheritance,
and in the Forests, Non-Commission Offices in the Fleet,
with many more, which neither the Test or Corporation-Acts,
or any other, ever could affect, or ever intended so
to do.</P>
<P>As to the Shame and Incapacity of one Convicted upon
this Bill; that is to say, <HI>before he ever again could enter
by Grant or Election, into any Office or Imployment within
the Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>he must at the next Quarter-Sessi∣ons
of the County where he resides, or in one of Her Ma∣jesties
Courts at</HI> Westminster, <HI>in publick and open Court
make Oath in writing, that within the Year foregoing he
has not once been present at any Conventicle, but has Three
times at the least receiv'd the Sacrament at the Church;
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
which Oath is to be kept upon Record.</HI> This would not be so
much worthy of Consideration, nor the Aggravation of the
Sentence on a second Offence (as a Relapse and Apostacy)
if the value of the Forfeiture, and Easiness of Conviction,
did not put too much Hazard on the Innocent, even af∣ter
such Purgation, as well as before it.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The Proportion by the Penalties of this Bill, be∣tween
the Protestant and Papist, is to be scanned by Two
Ways: <HI>First,</HI> By examining whether they are equally lia∣ble
to Loss of Offices, and suffering the Punishments.
<HI>2dly,</HI> What Difference there is otherwise. For the <HI>first,</HI>
the Test being more expresly contrived, to eject all Popish
Recusants, and the Complexion of the Times since the
Grand Revolution, not favouring them, every Man will
agree with me, that the immediate Loss to them upon
passing this Bill would be nothing, they have no Con∣cern
in the Matter; but on the other Hand the Dissen∣ters
(<HI>under the Terms hitherto required by Law</HI>) do pos∣sess
many Offices, as has been distinctly intimated, the first
Loss to them thereupon would upon many Accounts be very
considerable. Now for the Punishments sufferable by this Bill,
the Dissenters enjoying a Liberty upon Condition of open
Doors, a Conviction would at all times be more feasable
upon them, than the Papists, who are enforced to conceal
their Worship by other Laws. Furthermore, the Nature
of the Protestant Worship requires all their Attendants at
once, whereas that of private Masses need not engage above
Five, besides the Family in the same Instant. Thus the
Papist would not be so exposed to the Forfeitures, Fine and
Incapacity, as the Protestant.</P>
<P>The Difference otherwise between the Popish and Pro∣testant
Dissenter is no more than this; that whereas the
Test-Act did more expresly intend the Papist, and the Pro∣testant
was but tacitly included, the Bill under Conside∣ration
uses such Terms only as have been appropriate to Prote∣stants,
and herein the Papist is but tacitly included, however
he is equally reach'd by the Intention and Penalties hereof;
and thus the Popish Dissenter and Protestant do stand upon a
Par; but granting the Papist is not liable to Loss of Be∣nefit
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
at all, or to suffering the Penalties like the Prote∣stant,
because Conviction is more difficult upon him, <HI>no
Man is made liable to suffer so much by any other Law,
for assisting at the solemnest Acts of that Religion, as he
would by this Bill, for being present at a Conventicle. A
Popish Convict, receiving the Sacrament of the Church
is immediately clear'd; no such Shame of Renuntiation;
no Incapacity lyes upon him. A Papist that shall relapse,
and fall under a second Conviction, is to be convicted over
again, without any Aggravation of his Censure. But Ju∣stice
and good Policy require there should be a Proportion
between the Offence and Punishment. Thus the Laws of</HI>
England <HI>have all along treated Papists as the most inve∣terate,
restless and formidable Enemies of the State, be∣cause
they depend upon a Foreign Power, and are sub∣ject
to it, which is such a one as always was, and ever will
be imployed to ruin us, theresore there has constantly been
a less degree of Punishment in the Laws upon the Prote∣stant
Dissenter than them.</HI> This Reason, if I be not mista∣ken,
has a considerable Accession of Weight to it in our
Days, the Papists having refused, since the late Revolu∣tion,
their Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> more than
ever from the early Days of the Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Let us consider what Danger would arise from
the Penalties of this Bill to the Innocent, for their Safe∣ty
seems the highest Concern of all Laws. <HI>Now for the
Administrations in publick, according to the Liturgy of the
Church, though for want of it before University-Sermons,
or upon an Omission of Prayer for the Royal Family, or
upon contravening the Practice of the Church of</HI> England,
<HI>Men would come within the Letter of this Bill, which
is a Condition not wholly out of Danger,</HI> yet 'tis likely the
obvious Design of it being against Dissenters, would ren∣der
a Prosecution in those Cases fruitless; <HI>however, Fami∣ly
Prayers differing from the Liturgy, at which should be
present more than Five accidentally above the Houshold,</HI>
(Circumstances not uncommon) <HI>would clearly come within
Reach, and then the Villany of a couple of bad Servants</HI>
(dismist perhaps for ill Practices) <HI>would have sufficient En∣couragement:</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
But the greatest Danger to the Innocent a∣rises
from Two Things in this Bill. <HI>First,</HI> From the Va∣lue
of the Forfeiture, which may amount to 500 <HI>l.</HI> and
is all given to the Informers, <HI>a Temptation beyond what is
commonly set before them by our Laws, or what the Inte∣grity
of the Age can well assure us against; for a dete∣stable
sort of Men there has been, who for much less Gains
have done wrongfully to a great many, and proved a very
Nusance to the Government, several of whom were Con∣victed
of Perjury about 20 Years ago. 2dly,</HI> The Easiness
of Conviction is another Subject of Danger to the Innocent, for
<HI>as the Law in relation to Offices now stands, every Man
chuses his own Witnesses to receiving of the Sacrament;
whose Attestation, with that of the Ministers and Church∣wardens,
being put upon Record, a Man is almost beyond
a Possibility of suffering by a false Accusation.</HI> But in the
Bill before us 'tis not so safe, for <HI>false Witnesses may chuse
to assign such a Time and Place</HI> (when they saw him at a
Meeting) <HI>as they know the Party least likely to disprove,
and the Accused in that Case has but a kind of Negative
Proof, to defend himself withal.</HI></P>
<P>As I have not presumed to draw into Argument the
Disposal of Offices, wherein the Safety of Church and
State did appear manifestly concern'd, so neither shall I
once enter into the Thoughts of those high Affairs,
which might be any ways affected by this Bill; as whe∣ther
the desirable Union with <HI>Scotland</HI> may not be em∣barassed
thereby; whether putting all Foreign Churches
under a Censure may weaken the good Understanding,
which ought to be between <HI>England</HI> and her Protestant
Allies; whether this Expedient bears due Regard to the
Condition of like Affairs among our nearest Neighbours,
<HI>Holland, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> or whether in time of so
dubious a War, especially since a Pretender to our Throne
is set up by the Enemy, it be proper to do any thing,
which may raise Heats and Animosities among our selves;
these being Matters cognizable only, by the proper Mini∣sters
of State, or the High Court of Parliament, and not fit
for private Persons to debate.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"/>
As to the grand Point of their Loyalty and due Alle∣giance,
which above all others the Dissenters are concern'd
to vindicate themselves about; Her Majesties Loving Sub∣jects,
who (being Protestants, and by the Rights of Nature
<HI>English</HI> Men) lye under the Unhappiness of dissenting in
some smaller Matters of Religion, from the Establish'd
Church, are abundantly satisfied from the Christian-like
Preamble of this Bill, and otherwise, that in the Sacred
Breast of Her most Excellent Majesty, and in those also of
the Highly Honoured Lords and Commons of <HI>England,</HI> they
stand fully acquitted from the vile and detestable Im∣putation
of any Principles repugnant to the Safety of this
Government; the Testimony of their own Consciences
does equally concur, and their Behaviour shall (as they
hope it does) demonstrate to all the World, that none of
their Fellow-Subjects can be more devoted to the present
Rightful and Lawful Settlement of the Crown; were
such Imputations true, they could never with any Face
complain of whatever Hardships were put upon them;
but being in the Case of the present Government absol∣ved
before God and Men, they do always allow themselves
to hope, that during their consonant and uniform Obe∣dience,
no Difficulties or Distresses will be laid upon them;
and above all, nothing which may look like a Blemish
upon their Loyalty; Her most Gracious Majesty (whom
God long preserve) has several times exprest her Pious
Parental Candor and Compassion unto them, who in∣deed,
without the Severity of Penal Laws, are for the
sake of undissembled Conscience daily under various Tem∣poral
Misfortunes, and as from that Disposition of Her
Majesties, they hold the Benefits of the Act of Indulgence,
(dear to them above all other earthly Considerations)
none can more ardently and sincerely than they, constant∣ly
do, and will implore the choicest Blessings of Heaven,
upon Her Excellent Majesty, and all their Governors.</P>
<P>To dissent from the Publick, they are sensible is al∣ways
to be in the Wrong; but if instead of the few
Things scrupled, wherein they are involuntarily so, their
Union in the Essential, and more important Points of Reli∣gion
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
with the Church, might find a due Consideration,
they doubt not but all Reproaches upon them, of any
hostile Dispositions towards it, would also be done away.
This is what, next to an affectionate Allegiance to the
State they could desire most, to vindicate to themselves
the Character of, and which they have for many Years,
by all Means so endeavour'd, that if the unfriendly Pas∣sions
of some Men, with the visible Interest of the Papists,
had not hindred, the same would long e'er this have crown∣ed
their Wishes with an universal Attestation: To dissent
touching Matters civil and common, from any Society
we are in, I appeal to all Men, does it imply Ill-will to
it? Why then should it be construed so in the Case before
us? Or if we please, why not quite otherwise?</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> is it not as a City, which
has an ambitious and powerful Enemy in the Field? She
has indeed other Fortifications more near and proper, but
why may not the Dissenters to her also be accounted, as
detached Outworks and Lines of Defence? Had ever the
common Enemy a Design immediate to execute upon this
City, but first his secret Engines were wrought to breed
Misunderstanding between the Town and her Dependants,
then open Attacks were made upon the separated Forts;
and while many Storms have fallen upon those, their Fi∣delity
to the Town has been the more approv'd, but the
City it self secure? No Persecutions could extort any Pe∣tition
from them for a Toleration of Popery. But after a
long and obstinate Defence, when those outward Posts
came to be abandon'd and demolish'd, did not the Ene∣my
soon get within the Town? The Papists ('tis true)
when once possess'd of their Conquest, to secure against
the Revolt of it, though before by open Force they had
taken and levell'd all those Redoubts, did then officiously
erect them anew, thinking to serve their Interest of them:
But the Dissenters, glad of Liberty indeed (who can blame
them?) no sooner discover'd the Enemy's Design, then
they adhered to their ancient Mother and Principal.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>
The Author hereof, to obviate undue Constructions▪
thinks fit to declare he is not liable to the Loss of any
Office by the foresaid Bill, nor has he reaped any per∣sonal
Advantage from the Revolution, or any ways from
the Government since; but the true Occasion of this Dis∣course
was not so much a Respect to the Dissenters, as
an accidental Computation in himself, of the flourishing
Estate of the Reformed Interest in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Com∣mencement
of the last Century, and of the dismal De∣clension
of it at the latter end, which gave him Occasion
to reflect, that in Humane Appearance, the only defensi∣ble
Bulwark of it now must consist, in the Welfare of
our Government, and an indissoluble Union with <HI>Holland.</HI>
Upon which Occasion, considering that <HI>the Indemnity of
Dissenters from Penal Laws, was by the Act of Indulgence
declared an effectual Means to unite our Protestant Fel∣low-Subjects
in Interest and Affection,</HI> He could not but
conclude, that the imposing new Penalties and Sufferings
would disunite them; and what can look more fatal
upon us than to see buried Animosities flame out afresh?
Who can tell but a Breach, when open'd, may, beyond
all our Foresight, grow in time so wide, that the mer∣ciless
Usurpations of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> may enter at it?</P>
<P><HI>But as to our Days, the Hope and Wishes of our
Enemies shall be disappointed, if we will listen to the
Direction, which the pious and prudent Authority over
us has prescribed, in appointing on the late Solemn
Fast</HI> (to obtain Success in this War, whereon the Safe∣ty
of the Kingdom does wholly depend) <HI>this Prayer for
our Use, and the God of Mercy vouchsafe us a favour∣able
Answer to it.</HI> Give us Grace, O Lord, seriously to
lay to Heart the great Dangers we are in, by our un∣happy
Divisions; take away all Hatred and Prejudice, and
whatsoever else may hinder us from Godly Union and
Concord. That as there is but one Body and one Spirit
and one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
Baptism, one God and Father of us all, so we may hence∣forth
be all of one Heart, and of one Soul, united in one
Holy Bond of Truth and Peace, of Faith and Charity;
and may with One Mind and One Mouth, glorifie thee, O
God, through Christ Jesus our Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
