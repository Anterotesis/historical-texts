<HEAD>AN AUTHENTIC NARRITIVE Of the Loss of the DODDINGTON INDIAMAN, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Deddington, Capt. Samson, failed from the Downs on the 23d. of April, 1755, in Company with the Pelham, the Houghton, the Streatham, and the Edge∣court, all in the Service of the East India Company, and in about seven Days got clear of the Channel; during this Time C. pt. Samson perceived that his Ship failed faster than any of the others, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was unwilling to lose the Advantage of this Superiority by keeping them Company: He therefore stood on alone, and having very soon lost Sight of them, he made Bonavista, one of the Cape de Verde Islands, lat. 16 North, on the 20th of May and on the 21 he got into Porto Prior Bay. It now app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared either that he had been mistaken in supposing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
his Ship to out sail the rest of the Fleet, or that he had lost Time by the Course he steered, for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two Hours before him. The Houghton arrived soon afterwards, but the Edgecourt did not come till the 26th.</P>
<P>On the 27th of May, the Doddington, Pelham, Streath am and Houghton, having taken in their Water, proceeded on the Voyage together, leaving the Edgecourt in the Road: they continued in Company steering S. by E. S E. till the 28th. when Capt. Samson thinking the Course too far easterly, order∣ed the Doddington to be kept South, which again separeted her from the rest of the Fleet, and after a fine Voyage of seve-Weeks she made the Land of the Cape of Good Hope. Hav∣ing just doubled the Cape, a new Departure was taken from de Agulhas on the 8th of July; and the Vessel having steered Eastward about 24 Hours, between the Latitude of 35d, 30 m, and 36d. the Captain ordered her to be kept E. N. E.</P>
<P>In this Course she continued till about a Quarter before One in the Morning of Thursday, July 17, when she struck: The Officer from whose Journal this Account is taken, was then a∣sleep in his Cabin, but being suddenly awaked from the Shock, he started up in the utmost Consternation, and made all the hast he could to get upon Deck; here all the Terrors of his Situa∣tion rushed upon him at once, he saw the Men dashed to and fro by the Violence of the Sea that rolled over them, and the Ship breaking to Pieces at every Stroke of the Surge; he crawled over, with great Difficulty, to the larboard Side of the Quarter-deck, which lay the highest out of Water, and there he found the Captain, who said very little more than they must all perish; in a few Minutes a Sea parted them, and he saw him no more. He made shift to get back to the Quarter-deck, but he was very much bruised, and the small Bone of his Left Arm was broken; all the rest of the Ship was under Water, and
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
shattered to Pieces. In this dreadful Situation, expecting every Moment to be swallowed up he heard somebody cry out Land! Upon this he looked eagerly about him, but tho he saw something which he supposed was taken for Land, he believed it to be only the Range of the Sea on the other Side of the Breakers; at the same Moment the Sea broke over him with great Violence, and not only forced him from his Hold, but stun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him by a violent Blow upon his Eye; tho' from this Time he lay insensible 'till after Day light, yet he continued upon the Wreck, and when he recovered he found himself made fast to a Plank by a Nail that had been forced into his Shoulder; besides the Pain that he felt from his Wounds and Bruises, he was now so benumbed with Cold, that he could scarce move either hand or foot; he called out as loud as he could, and was heard by the People on the Rocks▪ but they could give him no Assistance, so that it was a considerable Time before he could disengage himself and crawl on Shore.</P>
<P>This Shore was a barren uninhabitod Rock, in the Lat. of 33d. 44. m. South, and distant about 250 Leagues East of the Cape of Good Hope. Here were now met Mr. Evan Jones, Chief Mate, Mr. Jobn Collet 2d, Mr. William Webb 3d, and Mr. S, Powel 5th Mate; Richard Topping, Carpenter; Neal Bothwell and Nathaniel Chisholm, Quarter Masters; Daniel Ladova, the Captain's Steward; Henry Sharp, the Surgeon's Servant; Thomas Arnold, a Black, and John Mackdowal, Ser∣vants to the Captain. Robert Beaseley, John King, Gilbert Chain, Terence Mole, Jonas Rosenbury, John Glass,—Taylor, and Hendri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Scantz, Seamen; John Yets, Midship∣men, and John Lister, Ralph Smith, and Edward Dysoy, Ma∣trosses. These Persons being 23 in Number, were all that re∣mained of 276 Souls that were on board when the Ship struck.</P>
<P>Their first Care was to search among the Things which had been thrown upon the Rocks from the Ship, for something to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
cover them, in which they succeeded beyond their Hopes. The next Thing they felt the Want of was Fire, and this was not so easily supplied. some of them attempted to kindle two Piecee of Wood, by rubbing them together, but wirhout Success; others went peeping about among the Rocks to pick up fome∣thing that might serve for a Flint and Steel; after long Search they sound a Box that contained two Gun Flints. and a broken File; this was a joyful Acquisition, but still they had nothing that would kindle from a Spark, and till something like Tinder could be procured, the Flint and Steel were useless; a farther Search was therefore undertaken with inexpressible Sollitude and Anxiety; a Cask of Gunpowder was at last discovered, but to their great Disappointment it proved to be wet, however, upon a a near Examination, a small Quantity was sound at the Bottom of the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, which had suffered no Damage; some of this they bruised on a Linnen Rag, which served them very well sor Tin∣der, and a Fire was soon made; the bruised and wounded ga∣thered about it, and the rest went in Search of other Necesseries, without which the Rock could afford them but a short Respite from Destruction. In the Afternoon a Box of Wax C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndles, and a Case of Brandy were brought in, both were extremely welcome, especially the Brandy, of which every one thought it adviseable to take a Dram; soon after some others of the Party, returned with an Account that they had discovered a Cask full almost of fresh Water, which was yet of more Consequence than the Brandy, and Mr. Jones brought in some Piece of Salt Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, and soon after others arrived driving before them seven Hogs, which had come on Shore alive; some Casks of Beer, Water, and Flour, were also seen at a Distance. But it was not then possible to get them over the Rocks: the Approach of Night made it necessary to provide some Shelter, all Hands therefore were employ'd to make a Tent of some Canv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that had been thrown on Shore, which was at last effected, though it was so small for want of more Sail Cloth, that it would not hold them all. The Island was much frequented by a kind of Water-f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
something larger than a Duck, called a Gannet and the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh∣est Part of it was covered with their Durg; upon this Part they were obliged to build their Tent, for fear of being overflowed, and they placed those who could not walk, under the Tent, and kindled a Fire near them; but as they had passed the Day with∣out Food, they passed the Night without Rest besides, that they were sunk a Foot in the Fowl's Dung, the Night was so tempestious that the Wind blew away their Fire, and before it could be scraped together again, the Rain put it out.</P>
<P>In the Morning, which was Friday July the 18th, those that were able went again about the Rock, to see what could be saved from the Wreck but to their great Mortification, they found all the Casks which they had seen the Night before, except one of Beer, and one of Flour, staved to Pieces against the Rocks; soon after these were secured the Tide flowed up and put a Stop to the Work of that Day. The Company therefore was called together to eat their first Meal, and some Rashers of Pork were broiled upon the Coals for Dinner,</P>
<P>The sitting down thus desolare and forlorn, to a Repast, which they used to share in the convivial Charfulness, which naturally arose from the consciousness of present Plenty, and the Hope of future, struck them them with such a Sense of their Condition, that they burst into passionate Lamentations, wringing their Hands and looking round then with all the Wildnss of Despair; in such Tumult of Mind, our Thoughts hurry from one Object to another, to fix if possible, upon something that may afford Comfort; and one of the Company recollecting, that as the Car∣penter was among them they might build a Sloop, if they could procure Materials and Tools, mentioned this as a Subject of Hope to the rest; every Man's Attention was immediately turned upon the Carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt but he should be able to build a Sloop that would carry them all to some Port of Safety, if Tools and Materials could be found; at that Time
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
indeed, they had no rational Prospect of procuring either, any more than or being able to vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al a Sloop, if they had had one ready built; yet they had no soorer placed their Deliverance oneremove beyond total Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssibility, than they seemed to think it neither Improbable nor Difficult; they began to eat without farther repining, and from that Moment the Boat engrossed their whole Conversation, and they not only debated upon the Size and Manner of Rigging her but to what Port they should steer her, whether the Cape or Delegoa.</P>
<P>As soon as they had finished their Repair, some went in search of Tools, and others to mend the Tent, no Tools however were found that Day.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. They secured four Butts of Water, one Cask of Flower, one Hogshead of Brandy, and one of their little Boats, which had been thrown up by the Tide, in a shat∣tered Condition; but they found no Tools except a Scraper.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 20 They had the good Fortune to find a Hamper, in which there were Files, Sail-needles, Gimblets, and an Azi∣muth Compas Card. They also found two Quadrants, a Car-Penter's Adze, a Chissel, and three Sword-blades, and a Chest of Treasurer This search was made very early in the Morning, as there had been a prodigious Surf rolling in all the Day before, by which it was reasonable to suppose something would be thrown up. At Ten o'Clock they all assembled to Prayers, and did not go out again till after Dinner, when they found most of the Packets of Letters belonging to the King, and the Company; these they carefully dried and laid by.</P>
<P>The same Day, as they were searching about the Beach, they found the Boly of a Gentlewoman, which they knew to be that of Mrs. Collet, the Wife of their second Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who was then of a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Spot. The mutual Affection of this
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Couple was remara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly tender, and Mr. Jones, the first Mare immediately stepped aside to Mr Collet, and found means to take him to the other side of the Rock, while the other two Mates, the Carpenter, and some others, dug a Grave in the Bird's Dung, in which they deposited the Body, reading over it the Burial Service, from a French Prayer Book, which had driven ashore with her from the Wreck. Having thus paid the Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Humanity to the Dead, and concealed from Mr. Collet a Sight which would most sensibly, if not fatally, have affected him, they found means, after some Days, to disclose to him by degrees what they had done, and to give him the Wedding∣ring, which they had taken from her Finger. He received it with great Emotion, and afterwards spent many Days, in raising a Monument over the Grave, by piling up the squarest S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ones he could find, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op of which he fixed an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lank, and inscribed it with her Name, her Age, the Time of her Death, and some Account as the fatal Accident by which it was oc∣casioned.</P>
<P>On Monday, July 21, they secured some more Water and Pork, and found some Timber, Plank, Cordage, and Canvas. These they secured with great joy for the Boat, though as yet they were in want of many Implements, without which it was impossible for the Carpenter to work. He had just finished a Saw, but he had neither Hammer nor Nails. It happened, however, that one of the Seamen, Hendrick Scantz, a Sweed, having picked up an old Pair of Bellows, brought them to his Compani∣ons, and told them, that he had been by Profession a Smith, and that with these Bellows and a Forge, which he hoped they would be able, by his Direction, to build, he could furnish the Carpenter with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ools he would want, Nails included, as plenty of Iron might be obtained by burning the Timber which had come on Shore from the Wreck. This Acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt was received with a Transport of Joy; the Smith immediately ap∣plied himself to mend the Bellows, and the three following Days
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
were spent in building a Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and a Forge, in bringing toge∣ther the Timber and Plank for the Carpenter's use who was also busy in getting ready the few Tools he had, that he might Begin the Boat as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>July</HI> 24. The Carpenter, assisted by Chesho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, the Quarter-Master, began to work upon the Keel of the Boat▪ which they had determined should be a Sloop, 30 Feet long, and is wide. This Day also the Smith finished his Forge, and laid in a Quan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty of Fir for F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wel, From this Time the Carpenter and Smith contineed to work with indefatigable Illigence, except when they were prevented by the Weather; the Smith having furtunately found the Ring and not of a Power Anchor; which served him for an Anvil, supply'd Ches∣sels, Axes, Hammers, Nails, as they wanted, and the Car∣penter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fed them with great Dexterity and Dispatch, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when he fell sick.</P>
<P>As the Lives of the whole Company depended upon the Carpen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ they wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched his Recovery with the utmost Impa∣tience and Anxiety, and to their unspeakable Joy he was so far recovered on the 2d of August as to return to his Work.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Stores which they had saved from the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eck were so near exhau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, that they came to an Allowance of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Man per Day, and had no sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pork, except wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they were determined to keep to victual their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Water also fell short. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had recourse to several Expedients, they dug a Well, in hopes to and a Spring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but were disappointed; they attempted to knock down some of the Games that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed on the Top of the Rock, and in the they had some Success, but they found the Flesh very rank, of a Fistly Taste, and as black as a Shoe. They also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or Floa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, called a Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to go out a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with such Hooks and Line

<P>When they were driven to great Distress, they killed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but they had generally Succeess in Fishing on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they sometimes seet out two at a Time, It happened, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever, that Mr. Colle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the second Mate, and Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Midshipman, were very near being driven out to Sea on one of these Floats. where they would inevitably have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the 20th of August they had been Fishing all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> till about four o'Clock, when they weighed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to come in again, but the Wind suddenly fresh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning up to the Westward, they found, that instead of gaining ahed they drove out very fast. The People on Shore perceived their Distress, but knew not how to assist them, at last, however, they sent out another Float, with Killick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Ropes, which hoped would enable them to ride till the Wind became more moderate; but the Surf was so great, that it overfel her three Times, and the Men were obliged to swim ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. In the mean time they saw their Friends still driving out to Sea at a great Rate, and were just giving them up to inevitable Destruction. when the Carpenter sent them Word, that he would make the little Boat so tight, that she should not take in Water faster than one Man could lave it out. This gave them fresh hope, and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their Friends. The Carpenter dispatched the Boat in about a Quarter of an Hour, and she soon overtook the Float, and took Collet and Yets on Board. They soon found, however, that the Water gained very sast upon them; notwithstanding their utmost Efforts, and when she came in, she was so full of Water, that in a few Minutes she must have sunk.</P>
<P>As they were now afraid of venturing any more on the Rest, the Carpenter went again to wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k on the little Boat and put her into compleat Repair. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in fishing
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
was very uncertain: sometimes they took great Quantities, and sometimes they took none. Nor was the Supplies they obtained on Shore less pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carious: the Gannets would some∣times settle in amazing Num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, like a Cloud, and sometimes they would totally disappear for several Days together, This made them very desirous of finding some way to preserve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood they caught from Putrefactaion, that they might lay by the Surplus of a fortunate Day, to serve them when neither Gannets nor Fish were to be caught. They made several At∣tempts to eure both their Fish and their Fowl by smoak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it, but without Success. They then attempted to make Salt but this had like to have been fatal to them all. The Smith had mended a Copper Vessel for the Experiment, and they immedi∣ately began to work without knowing that their Process in Salt making would dissolve the Surface of the Copper into Verdi∣greese, and that this Solution or Rust of Copper was Poison Salt, however, was produced; but the Quality that made it poisonous happened to abound in such a Degree, as to make it intolerably offensive to the Taste; it was therefore thrown away but those who had ventured to palate it were seized with violent Cholicks, cold Sweats; and Reachings which suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt∣ly convinced them of the Danger they had escaped.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Sept,</HI> 3. They had now been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desolate Rock ever since the 17th of July near seven Weeks, and during this Time they had often seen a great Smoke on the main Land, which made them very desirous to send the Boat, to try what Assistance might be obtained from thence. On this Day, therefore, Bothwell, Rosenbury, and Taylor, set out on the Discovery, and at Night the People on shore made a large Fire on the highest Part of the Rock, as a Signal to them.</P>
<P>While they were waiting the Return of the Boat they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown into the utmost Consternation by an Accident which happened to the Carpenter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who unfortunately cut his Leg
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
with an Adze, in such a manner, that he was in great Danger of Bleeding to Death, they having no Surgeon among them, nor any Thing proper to apply to the Wound. At length. however, tho' with much Difficulty, the Blood was staunched and the Wound healed without any bad Symptom supervening.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 6. The Weather having been fair for 40 Hours, they impatiently expected the Return of the Boat. At Moon they became very uneasy at having seen nothing of her; but just as they were sitting down to Dinner, they were agreeably surprised by two of their People, who came running over the Rocks crying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut <HI>the Boat! the Boat!</HI> They all started up overjoyed at the Sound, and ran to see her come in, with great Hopes that she had succeded; but they soon distingushed, that she was rowed only by one Man, who plied both Oars: They concluded, therefore, that the other two were lost or detained; but presently they saw another get up from the Boottom of the Boat, where it was supposed he had lain down for some short Refreshment, and then the Boat came forward somewhat faster, though still at a slow Rate. The Dinner was now entirely forgot, and after they had waited an Hour on the Beach with the ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost Impatience, the Boat came in. The two Men were Rosenbury and Taylor, who, the Moment they stept on Shore, threw themselves on their Knees, and in a short but earnest Ejaculation returned Thanks to God for having once more set them safe upon this Place, which barren and desolate as it was, they now considered as an Asylum from a Situation of much greater Distress. Having exerted their utmost Effort to bring the Boat in, their Strength foreook them at once, and they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not able to rise from the Ground without Assistance.</P>
<P>As soon as they were g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t over to the Tent, by the Assistance of the rest, every Body was bu∣sy to procure them some Refreshment, for they found that the Boat was quite bare of provisions
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
and Water. They dressed them some Fish, with as much haste as they could, and perceiveing that they were quite exhausted with Watching and Labour, they left them when they had eat∣en their Meat, without asking any Questions, and they immediately fell asleep. The Behaviour of these honest Sailors to their Mess-mates, was an uncommon Instance of hearty Kindness, and generous Self-denial; the Impatience of their Curiosity must have been both encreased and justi∣fied in Proportion, as they were interested in the Account that was to gratify it; yet even this Cu∣riosity, in which Life itself was concerned, they had the kindness and the Fortitude to repress, rather than delay the Refreshment of others for its Gratification.</P>
<P>The Account which was given by the two Ad∣venturers when they awoke was to this Effect:</P>
<P>About three o'Clock on the Day they set out, they got round a Point, about six Leagues East of the Rock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as they approached, it had the App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arance of a double Point, which encouraged them to hope, that between the two Points they should find▪ Harbour; but in this hope they were diasppointed, for they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound a large Surf all along the Coast. However, about Fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o'Clock, having seen only one of the Natives, they ven∣tured
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
to pull in for Shore, but the Moment they got into the Surf, the Boat overset. By this Accident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bothwell was drowned, and the other two, who reached the Shore in an exhau∣sted and seeble Condition, were left destitute of every kind of Provision, except a small Keg of Brandy, As soon as they had a little recovered their Strength, they crawled along the Shore to seek for the Boat, having no other hope of shelter from the wild Beasts, which might be expected to come abroad in the Night. After some Search they found her, but they were too weak to get her up, and Darkness coming on, they were o∣bliged to lie down upon the Sand, with no other Covering than the Branches of a Tree, and in this Condition they passed the Night. As soon as the Morning dawned, they went again to look for the Boat, which the Surf had driven from where they left her. As they walked along the Coast they saw a Man and advanced towards him, upon which he ran away into the Woods that lay near the Beach, and were very thick. They went on, and soon after discovered the Bo∣dy of their Companion, Bothwell, which had been dragged up the sand a considerable distance from the Water, and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to Pieces by some wild Beast. This terified them exceedingly, and ha∣ving found the Beat, the dread of passing ano∣ther Night on Shore; detirmined them immedi∣ately to return. They were, however, prevented

in the Attempt by a Fresh Gale at West, and before they could put back, the Boat overset with them a Second time, and drove with them along Shore. After much struggleing and Swimming they got once more safe on the Land; but as they had now been fasting ever since Three o'Clock the Day before, they were fainting with Hunger and Fateigue. It happened, however, that they met with a Fruit resembleing an Apple, which they eagerly gathered and eat, without knowing either its name or its Quality. By good forune, it did them no harm; and being somewat refreshed by their antidiluvian Repast, they made shift to haul the Boat on Shore, and turning it upside down, they crept under it to sleep, being thus very well sheltered from the Sun, and secured against the wild Beasts. Those who know the irresistable Power of Sleep, after long Watching and exces∣sive Labour, will not conclude that their first Slumber was short, because their situation was incommodious or insecure; they waked, however, before the next Morning, and peeping under the Edge of the Boat, they could discern the Feet of several Creatures, which by their Claws they supposed to be Tygers, pass by them to and a∣gain. This was a sufficient Motive to remian in their resting Place till the Morning, when they looked out again, and saw the Feet of a Man. Upon this Discovery they came from under the Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the great Astonishment of the poor
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Savage, and two other Men and a Boy, who were at some Distance. When they had got all together, and were a little recovered from their Surprize, they made Signs to the Sailors to go a∣way, which they endeavoured to do, though they were able to move but very slowley</P>
<P><HI>Before they had gone far from the Boat, a conside∣rable Number of the Natives ran down upon them with their Lances. It happened that Rosenbury had picked up the Mast of the Boat, and a Pistol which had been washed on Shore, as he went along; being thus armed, when the Indians came down upon him, and being besides unable to run, he imprudently turn∣ed about, and exerting all his Strength, advanced to∣wards them in a threatening Manner, supposing that they would have been seized with a Panic, and re∣treated into the Woods.</HI></P>
<P>It happended, however, that he was mistaken; for instead of running away, they surrounded him, and began to whet their Lances. Taylor thought it was now Time to try what could be done by Supplication; he therefore threw himself on his Knees, and in a piteous Tone cried out for Mercy; but Rosenberry took Refuge in the Water. The Savages immediately came up to Taylor, and began to strip him: he suffered them quierly to take his Shoes and his Shirt, but when they attacked his Trowsers he made some Resist∣stance,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and by his Gestures, intreated they would not leave him quite naked, upon which they thought fit to desist. They then made Sings for Rosenberry to come to them, who was all this while swimming about in the Sea; but he refused, and made Signs that they would kill him. They then pointed to Taylor, intimating that they had not killed him: Upon this he came forward, and having first thrown them his Pistol, and all his Cloaths but his Shirt, he ventured to put him∣self into their Hands, When he came up they offered him no Violence, only held the Boat's Mast and the Pistol to him, by Way of deriding the Folly of his Attempt to fright them. They seemed to be very much pleased with the Cloathes, which they divided among them as far as they would go. They then began to rifle the Boat, and having taken all the Rope they could find, and the Hook by which the Rudder hung to the Stern-post, they began to knock the stern to peices, for the Iron which they saw was about it. Next to knocking the poor Wretches on the Head, this was the worst Thing they could do, and, rough as they were, they burst into Tears at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njury that was offered to their Boat, and intrea∣ted the Savages to desist, with such Agony of Di∣stress, that they suffered the Boat to remain as they found it. Encouraged by this Appearance of Placability and Kindness, and urged by Hun∣ger, they asked by Sings, for something to eat,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
this Request was also granted, and having given them some Roots, they again made Signs for them to depart; upon which they once more launched their Boat, and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into it, but the Wind blowing strong from the West, they could not put off. The Natives perceiving that they were willing to comply with their Desires, but not able, covered them with the Boat to sleep un∣der, and left them as they had sound them. The next Morning, the Weather being fine, and the Wind easterly, they launched the Boat a third Time, and returned back to the Rock.</P>
<P><HI>From this Time till</HI> Sunday <HI>the 29th of</HI> Septem∣ber, <HI>the Carpenter and Smith continued to work upon the Boat, and the People were busy in getting in from Time to Time what was thrown up from the Wreck, particularly Cordage and Canvas, to rig the Boat, and some Casks of fresh Water, which they were very solicitous to keep for Sea Stores, as their Escape in the Boat scarce depended less upon fresh Water than upon the Sails themselves. On this Day, after they had been at Prayers, a Duty which was regularly and pu∣blickly performed every Sunday, the Officers discover∣ed that the Chest of Treasure had been broke open, and the greater Part of it taken away and concealed. It may perhaps be thought strange, that People, whom Danger had made religious, should at the same Time be guilty of Theft; but, upon this Occasion, it should be remembred, that as soon as a Ship is lost, the Sai∣lors
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
lose their Pay, and the Captain his Command; every Distinction and Subordination that subsifled on Ship-board is at an End; and whatever is cast asho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from the Wreck is, by the Sailors, considered as com∣mon Property. The Men, therefore, who thought fit secretly to take what they deemed their Share of this Treasure, were not, in their own Opinion, guilty of Dishonesty, but intended only to secure what they feared the Officers would monopolize, and by this Means prevent Disputes, which, in their Circum∣stances, might produce fatal Effects. The Officers, however, when they discovered what had been done, and found that nodody would own they knew any Thing a∣bout it, proposed to write the Form of an Oath, and administer it separately to every Individual, the Officers to take it first. But to this the Majority immediately objected; for tho' they might not suppose they had committed a Crime by taking the Treasure, they knew it would be not only immoral, but impious, to swear they had not taken it. As the Minority were not in a Condition to support their Motion, the Affair was suffered to rest, without farther Enquiry or Re∣monstrance.</HI></P>
<P>On the 6th of October they found a Fowling∣piece; this was a joyful Acquisition, and though the Barrel was much bent, it was soon made ser∣viceable by the Carpenter, and used with great Success in shooting the Birds, which before they had no way of taking, but by knocking them down with a Stick.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<HI>On Friday October</HI> II. <HI>they perceived the Gannets, which had of late forsaken them, to hover again about the Rock in great Numbers, and were in hopes they would settle to lay their Eggs, in which, to their great Joy, they were not disappointed; for after this Time they were constantly supplied with Eggs in great Plenty, till the beginning of January, when the Sea∣son of laying was past.</HI></P>
<P>On Sunday October 20. Mr. Collet, Mr. Web, and two others, ventured out once more on the Float, but the Wind springing up very fresh, the Float broke loose, and drove with them to the other side of the Rocks. The Wind still rising, and the Sea running very high, it was impossible for the Boat to put out; they were therefore obli∣ged to remain all Night among the Seals on the Rocks, without any Shelter or Refreshment. But in this Situation, how dreadful, they received great Comfort from reflecting how much more dreadful it would have been, if instead of being driven to the Rocks, their Float had been carried out to Sea. It was Noon, the next Day before the Wind abated, and then the Boat ventured off; but as the Waves still ran high, it could bring in no more than two at a time, leaving the Float be∣hind them. They had now some rainy Weather, which proved very acceptable, as they contrived to save some of the Water for Sea Stores; but they were still in great want of Bread, having lived
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
many Days on short Allowance. As a last Re∣source, they thought of building an Oven, for they had some Burrels of Flower, though they had no Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: In this Attempt they succeeded, beyond their Expectations, and were able to con∣vert their Flower into tolerable Biscuit.</P>
<P><HI>This Biscuit, however, was at length so mar ex∣tended, that they were obliged to live upon a few Ounces a Day, without Brandy, of which only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amll Quantity remained, and this they prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved in∣available for the Use of the Carpenter. They were also so short of Water, that of this they were allowed but Half a Pint a Day.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition, however, they happily in a great Degree preserved their Health and Vigour, and on the 16th of February they launched their Boat, and called her the <HI>Happy Deliverance.</HI> On the 17th they got their little Pittance of Stores on Board, and on the 18th they set sail from the Rock, on which they had lived just seven Months, and to which at parting they gave the Name of <HI>Birds Island.</HI></P>
<P>When they embarked in their boat, the <HI>Happy Deliverance,</HI> at <HI>Berd Island,</HI> they were two and twenty in number, and had on board two buts and four hogsheads of water, two of the hogs that had come on shore from the ship alive, one firkin of
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
butter, about 90 ponnd of biscuit, and about ten ten days salt provisions, at two ounces a man per day, but this was quite rotten and decayed.</P>
<P>The joy which they felt at putting off from this dreadful seat of samine and desolation was too great to be expressed; but it was of very short con∣tinuance, for as soon as they got to the mouth of the little channel which led to the rock, the grap∣nails came home, and they were instantly driven on the rocks where their boat, which had cost seven months incessant labour, and was the found∣ation of all their hopes, struck so often and with such violence, that they were thrown into the ut∣most consternation, and expected every moment she would be broken to pieces. It was a great aggra∣vation of their distress, that no efforts of their own could at all contribute to extricate or relive them, so that they could only gaze at each other, and wait, helpless and inactive, for the moment of Destruction. In this condition, however, it pleased him whom the winds and waves obey, to relieve them; a swell of the sea took the boat so favour∣ably, that it lifted her from the rock on which she was beating, and carrying over her the bar, left her in four fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m calm water. Here they immedately anchored, to repair their damage by securing the grapnails, and this was not effectually done till noon the next day.</P>
<P>On the 18th of February, at about one in the
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
afternoon, they weighed and stood to the eastward, in order to make the river St. Lucia, on the coast of Africa, about 300 leagues to the north-east of the Cape, their first port. In this attempt they persisted till the second of March, being no less than twelve days and nights, without getting one mile on their course; for the currents, by which their ship had been driven out of her way, and which not being allowed for, had produced a fa∣tal error in their reckoning, now run so strong to the westward, that a fair wind, instead of carrying them forward, scarce enabled them to keep their ground. In the mean time, their provisions was very near exhausted, and being at once exposed both to shipwreck and famine, they determined to deliver themselves up to the course of the current, which they had endeavoured in vain to stem, and so get back to the Cape.</P>
<P>On the second of March, therefore, they bore away to the westward, but the very next day the wind, which, till then had been easterly, blew a strong gale from the west, so that the wind now counteracted the force of the current, and continuing to rise all that day and the following night, the next morning, Thursday, March 4, it it blew a strom. They now endeavoured to lie too, but they shipped such heavy seas, that they were in perpetual danger of being dashed to pieces, and were therefore compelled to send away under
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
their topsail only. They were thus driven before the tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, at a great rate, till the next morning about three o'clock, and then the weather became fine.</P>
<P>This course they continued till Wednesday, March the 10th, when the wind shifting to the eastward, they anchored in twelve fathom water, at the distance of about half a mile from the shore. In the evening many of the natives came down to the water-side, hallowing and making signs that they should land, which they many times attempt∣ed, but found it impracticable. In the morning the natives appeared again, repeating their signals, and driving down great numbers of cattle, but the poor wretches on board were still tantalized by the sight of plenty, which they could not reach, for no place to land could yet be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound.</P>
<P>—On Monday the 15th of March, they determined, at all events, to make an at∣tempt to get the sloop into river; having waited therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was high water, they sent the lit∣tle boat to sound ahead, and following her at a proper distance, they at length ventured over the bar, and having happily received no damage, they anchored in two fathom and a half of water.</P>
<P><HI>The natives had now come again to the shore, and the people on board got together some brass. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uttons</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<HI>small bits of iron, nails, and copper hoops, as the most likely commodities to exchange for mutton and beef. The copper hoops they bent into bracelets, to be worn on the legs and arms, such as are worn by all the na∣tives of this coast who have trafficked with Europeans, and are called Bangles With these baubles, which are prized by these poor savages, prehaps with as much reason as gems and gold are prized by those who hold their simplicity in contempt, the poor fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ished adven∣turers hastened on shore; and having soon made the na∣tives understand what they wanted, and what return they would make, two nll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, each weighing about</HI> 600 <HI>lb. weight, were driven down to the beach with great expedition, and bartered for about one pound weight of copder hooks and four brass buttons. Pro∣visions of all kinds were procured in great plenty at the same rate, particularly milk, and a small grain that resembled Guinea wheat. This grain they attempted to bake into into biscuit for sea stores, but could not succeed; however they found an excellent expedient, by boiling it wich their meat, which answered the same purpose as bread, and made very good food.</HI></P>
<P>They continued on shore at this place near a fortnight, and found the natives an honest, open, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mless, and friendly people, ready to do any kind office that in their power, and always divi∣ding what they brought from the chase, tho' it was ever so little, as far as it would go, with looks and gestures that strongly expressed that
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
pleasure which no selfish gratification can produce. Their manner of living and appearance were the same that have been so often described by those who have accounts of the people called Hotten∣tots, who inhabit the Cape of Good Hope, except that as these had not been used to any commerce with Europeans, they were more innocent, bene∣volent, and sincere. It is, however, remarkable, that among these people, who are all black, and woolly haired, there was a youth of about 12 or 14 years, who was quite white, and had regular European features, with fine light hair. The people of the sloop observed, that he was treated as a servant, being sent on errands, and sometimes not permitted to eat till the rest had done. They also took notice, that he disappeared a few days before they left the coast, and therefore they sus∣pected the natives were afraid they should carry him off with them, nor was one of the natives themselves to be seen the morning they went a∣way.</P>
<P><HI>On Monday, March</HI> 29, <HI>having laid in great plenty of provisions, they got safe over the bar, and made sail for the river St. Lucia, where they arrived on Tuesday the 6th of April, having found the cur∣rent more favourable than before, and no other occur∣rence having happened that was worth relating.</HI></P>
<P>Having got into the river, and anchored in three
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
fathom water, they went on shore, but they found the people very different from those with whom they last traded. When the brass buttons and bits of old iron were offered them, they refused them, and taking up some of the sand from the beach, they poured it out of one hand into the other, by which they might perhaps intend to intimate, that they wanted strong lipuors, tho' the sloop's people did not understand it; and, if they had, thep had no strong liquors for them. They made signs also, that they wanted some brass rings, big enough to serve as collars; but in this too their visitants were equally unable to gratify them.</P>
<P><HI>Among other things, howiver, which they offered to barter, was a brass handle of a chest, and a peice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had made eh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir colours of. These happened to be acceptable, and were purchased with two large ballocks and six good fowls. They also vouchsafed to purchase some of the brass bottons with pumpkins, potatoes, and other herbs and fruit.</HI></P>
<P>The natives of this part of the coast, by their frepuent dealings with Europeans, had learned to be cleanly in their persons and food, dressing their hair up very neatly, and laying aside the grease and garbage, with which the others anoint∣ed and adorned themselves; but at the same time they had learnt to be proud, crafty, deceitful,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
and dishonest. However, the adventures stayed with them till Sunday the 18th of April, and then getting all on board, they weighed and made sail.</P>
<P><HI>Hitherto they had been united by adversity in the bond of friendship; but as they had now a near pros∣hect of deliverance, their minds were less tender, and their different peculiarities of temper and opinion were indulged with less restraint. As they were sailing down the river, a dispute arose about the time and manner of crossing the bar, which was then very near, and it was carried so high, that some of them hawled down the sails, and lel go the grapnail close to the brake of a sand; nine of them then hoisted out the little boat, and went on shore, swearing that they would sooner take their chance of getting to De la Goa by land, than be drowned in attempting to get over the bar. Those who remained in the sloop were by this accident reduced to very great distress; for being prevented by the delay they had suffered, from getting over the bar at high water, and the wind and tide both setting out of the river at a great rate, they were very soon forced on the breakers, where there was then but</HI> 8 <HI>foot of wa∣ter, and the vessel drawing 5, she must inevitably have been grounded and beaten to pieces, before the river was half empty.</HI></P>
<P>It happened, however, contrary to all expecta∣tion, and from some unknown cause, that in less
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
than half an hour the surface of the water became smooth, and, by the vigorous efforts of those on board, the vessel was brought safely out of the river.</P>
<P><HI>From St. Luciaw, hich by their reckoning is in lati∣tude</HI> 28. 14. <HI>south, and longitude from London</HI> 30. 15. <HI>they took a new departure, and anchored in de la Goa road at</HI> 4 <HI>o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday the</HI> 2 <HI>of April, having again narrowly escaped ship∣wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck on some breakers the night before.</HI></P>
<P>Here they found the Rose galley, Captain Chandler, trading for beef and ivory, and most of them begged a passage with him to Bombay.</P>
<P><HI>After they had contunied here about three weeks three of the nine men who had deserted them at St. Lu∣cia, were brought up the river in a small boat of the country, and reported, that the other six were wait∣ing, without any covering but a shirt and of drawers, onthe other side of the bay of Delagoa, waiting for a boat to bring them over.</HI></P>
<P>On board the sloop there was, among other things, the remainder of the chest of treasure be∣longing to the East-India company, when had been b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke open upon the rock, and plundered of what the sailors thought their share of it, upon a supposition, that on the loss of the ship, it was be∣come
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
common proprity. The officers who had secured the remainder for the company, and who, till now, had no means of recovering the rest, told Capt. Chandler what had happened, and having consulted with him what to do, they enticed four or five of those who were on board the sloop, on shore, and two others on board the Rose galley: they then took Captain Chandler's pinnace, well manned and armed, and went on board their sloop, where they secured all the money, plate, and packets they could find, without osserin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g any violence to the people on board or expressing the least resentment or menice concerning the emcez∣zlement. The people, however, whom they left on board the sloop, fearing that they might be taken into custopy, weighed anchor, and went away in the night.</P>
<P><HI>On the 25th of May the officers and the rest of the crew, being on board the Rose galley, she weighed an∣chor, and proceeded not to Bombay, as was intend∣ed, but to Madagascar, this voyage having become necessary to compleat her cargo, beoause the natives of Delagoa having sold Capt. Chandler</HI> 100 <HI>bead of cattle, stole them all away again afterward, and re∣fusea to restore them without a new-consideratiou.</HI></P>
<P>The Rose galley, soon after she was at sea, made a sail, which, when they came up with, proved to be the sloop, which had taken in the
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
other six men, that were lest behind at St. Lucia; they had been taken on board alive, but three of them were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dead, and two more died the next day, having, after their lives had been so often preserved, almost to a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oolishly sacrified them to voluntary hardship and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>igne, in a fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unreasonable per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ance and causeless disgust. Two of the people on-board the sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op being convinced, that no harm was intended them; came on board the Rose: One of these was the corpenter, to the honour of whose ingenuity be it recorded, that the sloop, which he built on a de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te rock, with the fragment of the ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted together with such tools as the peices of iron casually thrown on shore, would supply, he now fold to Capt. Chandler for 2500 repees, which is nearly equal to 5001, sterling money. From this time the sloop pursued her voyage in company with the galley and both arrived at Madagascar after a pleasant voyago of two and twenty days.</P>
<P>Soon after they had anchored at Madagascar, they had the pleasure to see the Carnarvan, Capt. Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chinson, arrived there, in his voyage from London to China, and as the treasure and packets, which had been preserved from the Doddington, were to be delivered at Madras, the officers went with them on board the Carnarvan, and delivered them, with other private effects, to the company's agents there, on the 1st of August, 1756.</P>
