</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within the brain's most secret cells,</L>
<L>A certain <HI>Lord Chief Justice</HI> dwells</L>
<L>Of sov'reign pow'r, whom One and All,</L>

<L>And prostrate fall before their King.</L>
<L>Whatever unto them is brought,</L>
<L>Is carry'd on the wings of Thought</L>
<L>Before his throne, where, in full state,</L>
<L>He on their merits holds debate,</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="9"/>Examines, Cross-examines, Weighs</L>
<L>Their right to censure or to praise;</L>
<L>Nor doth his equal voice depend</L>
<L>On narrow Views of foe and friend,</L>

<L>Divert him from his steady course;</L>
<L>The Channel of Enquiry's clear,</L>
<L>No <HI>sham Examination</HI>'s here.</L>

<L>He, upright Justicer, no doubt,</L>

<L>What Virtue is, and What is Vice,</L>

<L>He takes upon him to explain</L>
<L>What Pleasure is, and what is Pain,</L>
<L>Whilst We, obedient to the Whim,</L>
<L>And resting all our faith on him,</L>
<L>True Members of the <HI>Stoic</HI> weal,</L>
<L>Must learn to think, and cease to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This glorious System form'd, for Man</L>
<L>To practise when and how he can,</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="10"/>If the five Senses in alliance</L>

<L>Nay should the <HI>Eye,</HI> that nicest Sense,</L>

<L>So that the Pleasures of the Mind</L>
<L>To a small circle are confin'd,</L>
<L>Whilst those which to the Senses fall,</L>
<L>Become the Property of All.</L>
<L>Besides (and this is sure a Case</L>

<L>Enough to strike beholders dead,</L>
<L>Gnashing his teeth, and in a flood</L>
<L>Pouring corruption forth and blood</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="81"/>From his chaf'd jaws; without remorse</L>
<L>Whipping, and spurring on his horse,</L>
<L>Whose sides, in their own blood embay'd,</L>
<L>E'en to the bone were open laid,</L>
<L>Came TYRANNY; disdaining awe,</L>
<L>And trampling over <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Law.</HI></L>
<L>One thing and only one He knew,</L>
<L>One object only would pursue,</L>
<L>Tho' Less (so low doth Passion bring)</L>
<L>Than man, he would be more than King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With ev'ry argument and art,</L>
<L>Which might corrupt the head and heart,</L>
<L>Soothing the frenzy of his mind,</L>
<L>Companion meet, was FLATT'RY join'd.</L>
<L>Winning his carriage, ev'ry look</L>
<L>Employ'd, whilst it conceal'd a hook;</L>
<L>When simple most, most to be fear'd;</L>
<L>Most crafty, when no craft appear'd;</L>
<L>His tales, no man like him could tell;</L>
<L>His words, which melted as they fell,</L>
<L>Might e'en a Hypocrite deceive,</L>
<L>And make an infidel believe,</L>
<L><PB N="207" REF="82"/>Wantonly cheating o'er and o'er</L>
<L>Those who had cheated been before:</L>
<L>Such FLATT'RY came in evil hour,</L>
<L>Pois'ning the royal ear of pow'r,</L>
<L>And, grown by <HI>Prostitution</HI> great,</L>
<L>Would be first Minister of State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within the Chariot, all alone,</L>
<L>High seated on a kind of throne,</L>
<L>With pebbles grac'd, a Figure came,</L>
<L>Whom Justice would, but dare not, name.</L>
<L>Hard times when Justice, without fear,</L>
<L>Dare not bring forth to public ear</L>
<L>The names of those, who dare offend</L>
<L>'Gainst Justice, and pervert her end;</L>
<L>But, if the Muse afford me grace,</L>
<L>Description shall supply the place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>foreign</HI> garments he was clad,</L>
<L><HI>Sage</HI> Ermine o'er the glossy <HI>Plaid</HI></L>
<L>Cast rev'rend honour, on his heart,</L>
<L>Wrought by the curious hand of Art,</L>
<L>In silver wrought, and brighter far</L>
<L>Than heav'nly or than earthly Star,</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="83"/>Shone a <HI>White Rose,</HI> the Emblem dear</L>
<L>Of him He ever must revere,</L>
<L>Of that dread Lord, who, with his host</L>
<L>Of faithful native rebels lost,</L>
<L>Like those black Spirits doom'd to hell,</L>
<L>At once from pow'r and virtue fell;</L>
<L>Around his clouded brows was plac'd</L>
<L>A <HI>Bonnet,</HI> most superbly grac'd</L>
<L>With mighty <HI>Thistles,</HI> nor forgot</L>
<L>The sacred motto, <HI>Touch me not.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the right-hand a sword He bore</L>
<L>Harder than Adamant, and more</L>
<L>Fatal than winds, which from the mouth</L>
<L>Of the rough North invade the South;</L>
<L>The reeking blade to view presents</L>
<L>The blood of helpless Innocents,</L>
<L>And on the hilt, as meek become</L>
<L>As Lambs before the Shearers dumb,</L>
<L>With downcast eye, and solemn show</L>
<L>Of deep unutterable woe,</L>
<L>Mourning the time when FREEDOM reign'd,</L>
<L>Fast to a rock was Justice chain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="209" REF="84"/>
<L>In his left-hand, in wax imprest,</L>
<L>With bells and gewgaws idly drest,</L>
<L>An <HI>Image,</HI> cast in baby mould,</L>
<L>He held, and seem'd o'erjoy'd to hold.</L>
<L>On this he fix'd his eyes, to this</L>
<L>Bowing he gave the loyal kiss,</L>
<L>And, for Rebellion fully ripe,</L>
<L>Seem'd to desire the ANTITYPE.</L>
<L>What if to that <HI>Pretender</HI>'s foes</L>
<L>His greatness, nay, his life he owes,</L>
<L>Shall common obligations bind,</L>
<L>And shake his constancy of mind?</L>
<L>Scorning such weak and petty chains,</L>
<L>Faithful to JAMES he still remains,</L>
<L>Tho' he the friend of GEORGE appear:</L>
<L>Dissimulation's Virtue here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Jealous and Mean, he with a frown</L>
<L>Would awe, and keep all merit down,</L>
<L>Nor would to Truth and Justice bend,</L>
<L>Unless <HI>out-bullied</HI> by his <HI>friend</HI>;</L>
<L>Brave with the Coward, with the brave</L>
<L>He is himself a Coward slave;</L>
<L><PB N="210" REF="85"/>Aw'd by his fears, he has no heart</L>
<L>To take a great and open part;</L>
<L>Mines in a subtle train he springs,</L>
<L>And, secret, saps the ears of Kings;</L>
<L>But not e'en there continues firm</L>
<L>'Gainst the resistance of a worm;</L>
<L><HI>Born in a Country,</HI> where the will</L>
<L><HI>Of One is Law to all,</HI> he still</L>
<L>Retain'd th' infection, with full aim</L>
<L>To spread it wheresoe'er he came;</L>
<L><HI>Freedom</HI> he hated, <HI>Law</HI> defied,</L>
<L>The Prostitute of Pow'r and Pride;</L>
<L><HI>Law</HI> he with ease explains away,</L>
<L>And leads bewilder'd Sense astray;</L>
<L>Much to the credit of his brain</L>
<L>Puzzles the cause he can't maintain,</L>
<L>Proceeds on most familiar grounds,</L>
<L>And, where he can't convince, confounds;</L>
<L>Talents of rarest stamp and size,</L>
<L>To Nature false, he misapplies,</L>
<L>And turns to poison what was sent</L>
<L>For purposes of nourishment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="211" REF="86"/>
<L><HI>Paleness,</HI> not such as on his wings</L>
<L>The Messenger of Sickness brings,</L>
<L>But such as takes its coward rise</L>
<L>From conscious baseness, conscious vice,</L>
<L>O'erspread his cheeks; <HI>Disdain</HI> and <HI>Pride,</HI></L>
<L>To upstart Fortunes ever tied,</L>
<L>Scowl'd on his brow; within his eye,</L>
<L>Insidious, lurking like a spy</L>
<L>To Caution principled by Fear,</L>
<L>Not daring open to appear,</L>
<L>Lodg'd covert <HI>Mischief; Passion</HI> hung</L>
<L>On his lip quiv'ring; on his tongue</L>
<L><HI>Fraud</HI> dwelt at large; within his breast</L>
<L>All that makes Villain found a nest,</L>
<L>All that, on hell's completest plan,</L>
<L>E're join'd to damn the heart of man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the Car reach'd land, He rose,</L>
<L>And with a look which might have froze</L>
<L>The heart's best blood, which was enough</L>
<L>Had hearts been made of sterner stuff</L>
<L>In Cities than elsewhere, to make</L>
<L>The very stoutest quail, and quake,</L>
<L><PB N="212" REF="87"/>He cast his baleful eyes around;</L>
<L>Fix'd without motion to the ground,</L>
<L>Fear waiting on surprize, All stood,</L>
<L>And Horror chill'd their curdled blood.</L>
<L>No more they thought of <HI>Pomp,</HI> no more</L>
<L>(For they had seen his face before)</L>
<L>Of <HI>Law</HI> they thought; the cause forgot,</L>
<L>Whether it was or Ghost, or Plot,</L>
<L>Which drew them there, They All stood more</L>
<L>Like Statues than they were before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What could be done? Could Art, could Force,</L>
<L>Or Both direct a proper course</L>
<L>To make this savage Monster tame,</L>
<L>Or send him back the way he came?</L>
<L>What neither Art, nor Force, nor Both</L>
<L>Could do, a <HI>Lord</HI> of foreign growth,</L>
<L><HI>A Lord</HI> to that base wretch allied</L>
<L>In Country, not in Vice and Pride,</L>
<L>Effected; from the self-same land,</L>
<L>(Bad news for our blaspheming band</L>
<L>Of Scribblers, but deserving note)</L>
<L>The Poison came, and Antidote.</L>
<L><PB N="213" REF="88"/>Abash'd the Monster hung his head,</L>
<L>And, like an empty Vision, fled;</L>
<L>His Train, like Virgin Snows which run,</L>
<L>Kiss'd by the burning bawdy Sun,</L>
<L>To lovesick streams, dissolv'd in Air;</L>
<L>JOY, who from absence seem'd more fair,</L>
<L>Came smiling, freed from slavish awe;</L>
<L>LOYALTY, LIBERTY, and LAW,</L>
<L>Impatient of the galling chain,</L>
<L>And Yoke of pow'r, resum'd their reign;</L>
<L>And, burning with the glorious flame</L>
<L>Of Public Virtue, MANSFIELD came.</L>
