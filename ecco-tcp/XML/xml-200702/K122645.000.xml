<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the following Es∣say originated in a private controversy; that is, a controversy carried on for some time in private, between the Church of which I am a member, and some other Churches of the same de∣nomination; and although I am in some measure sensible of my literary defects; yet something may be said by way of apology for my appearing thus in print.</P>
<P>(1) We have no other way of com∣municating our sentiments to all who are concerned in this controversy.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
(2) Some who were not immedi∣ately concerned herein, have heard of the dispute; and our sentiments have been so much misunderstood, that it seems necessary to rectify these mistakes. (3) The SUBJECT in de∣bate is, in our estimation, of infinite importance, and of universal concern∣ment; and therefore I have not con∣fined myself to the question as it stood amongst ourselves; but have endea∣voured to treat it in such a manner as to make this Essay equally interesting and useful to all who read it. (4) Although the truth of Christianity <HI>in general,</HI> has been supported with abi∣lity and success against the bold at∣tack made by Mr. Thomas Paine;
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
yet I have not met with any thing which I could esteem as a sufficient reply to the argument he has urged against that grand peculiarity of the Gospel,—<HI>the doctrine of Redemption.</HI> I have therefore attempted something in that way. (5) I am in hopes that (if there should seem a necessity for it) this little Essay may give occa∣sion to some more able Friend, to take up his pen.—For the rest, I can only say to the <HI>Critic,</HI>—Spare me!—but to the <HI>Deist, Jew,</HI> or <HI>Christian,</HI> I say—Spare not!—So much by way of Apology.</P>
<P>I have used, very freely, every thing I found to my purpose in human Authors; but I never rest any part of the argument upon their <HI>Au∣thority.</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
They frequently helped me to express my own thoughts with more ease and clearness, than I could otherwise have done; and therefore I used their Words; but so far am I from building upon the authority of their Names, that I differ widely from almost all of them, upon other matters.—The Age of Popery is gone: let every man now exercise <HI>his own</HI> rea∣soning Powers, and <Q REND="inline">"be fully persuad∣ed in <HI>his own</HI> mind."</Q></P>
<P>But although I reject all human au∣thority, in matters of a <HI>religious</HI> na∣ture, I have so frequently referred to the Authority of Revelation, that I fear the reader will not have patience to examine the Sacred Text: yet it is
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
what he ought to do.</P>
<P>As to that part of the book which is controversial; I can only say, (1) I hope I have neither misrepresented the sentiments, nor abused the per∣son of any man. (2) The replies I have made, and the proofs I have ad∣vanced, appear to me to be conclusive; and I am fully satisfied that the doc∣trine we maintain, is the most just to God, and the most safe to man, that can be imagined. But I do not expect that every one else will be thus minded. When we do not like a sentiment, it is easy to misrepresent it to ourselves and others; we can start objections, and refuse to be satis∣fied: and as to scripture texts, we can
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
either find a different sense for the words as they stand, or we can alter the translation. At least we may dar∣ken or perplex the question so as to make it a matter of doubtful disputa∣tion which therefore ought not to be insisted upon. For instance:—</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may say,—What a piece of work is here about a single word! Christ is called a <HI>Surety</HI> only once in all the Bible; and even then he is not said to be the Surety of <HI>Sin∣ners,</HI> but the Surety of a <HI>Testament.</HI>—Yet here is a book written upon the Suretiship of Christ!—I shall conclude the Preface with a reply to this.</P>
<P>(1) Although Christ is only <HI>once</HI> expressly called a Surety; yet since it
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
is GOD who calls him so, we are ab∣solutely certain that Christ does sus∣tain this Character. We do not find that it was said to Adam, any more than <HI>once,</HI>—<Q REND="inline">"On the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."</Q>—Was the threatening less certain? or of less importance? I might mul∣tiply instances of this kind. The word <HI>Atonement</HI> occurs but <HI>once</HI> in the New Testament; but the thing intended thereby is often mentioned: so it is with respect to the Suretiship of Christ.</P>
<P>As to the word <HI>Testament,</HI> it will be granted that it is of the same import, in this place, as the word <HI>Covenant.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Mr. M'Lean's treatise on the Apostolic Commission. p. 59.</BIBL></NOTE> Now as this is certainly a covenant
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
between GOD and <HI>man,</HI> Christ must be the Surety of <HI>sinners,</HI> for the follow∣ing reasons:</P>
<Q><P N="1">(1) "EGGUS <HI>or</HI> EGGUHTHS, <HI>A Surety;</HI> is one that undertaketh for another wherein he is <HI>defective;</HI> really or in re∣putation. Whatever the undertak∣ing be, whether in words or promise; or in depositing a real security in the hands of an arbitrator, or by any other personal engagement of life and body, it respects the <HI>defect</HI> of the per∣son for whom any one becomes a sure∣ty. Such an one is <HI>sponsor</HI> or <HI>fidejussor</HI> in all good authors and common use of speech. And if any one be of ab∣solute credit himself, and of a repu∣tation very unquestionable, there is
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
no need of a surety, unless in case of mortality. The words of a surety in the behalf of another, whose ability or reputation is dubious, are, <HI>(ad me recipio, faciet aut faciam,)</HI> <Q REND="inline">"I take the matter upon me, he shall do it, or I will."</Q></P>
<P N="2">(2) God therefore can have <HI>no sure∣ty</HI> properly, because there can be no conceiveable <HI>defect</HI> on his part. There may be indeed a question, whether any words or promise be <HI>his;</HI> but to assure us of that, is not the work of a surety, but of <HI>any means</HI> whatever that may give <HI>evidence</HI> that it is so. He doth indeed make use of <HI>witnesses</HI> to con∣firm his word; that is, to testify that he hath made such promises; but the
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
difference is wide enough between a <HI>witness</HI> and a <HI>surety;</HI> for the latter must be of <HI>more ability,</HI> or more credit and reputation, than he for whom he en∣gages, or there is no need of his sure∣tiship. This none can be for God.—And if this be not the notion of a surety in this place, the apostle makes use of a word no where else used in the whole scripture, to teach us that which it doth never signify among men; which is sufficiently improba∣ble and absurd. For the sole reason why he made use of it was, that from the nature and notion of it among men in other cases, we may under∣stand what he ascribes under that name to the Lord Jesus."</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
(3) "We on all accounts <HI>stand in need of a Surety</HI> for us, or on our behalf. Neither without the interposition of such a Surety could any Covenant between God and us be firm and sta∣ble, or an <HI>everlasting Covenant,</HI> ordered in all things and sure. In the first Covenant made with <HI>Adam</HI> there was no Surety, but God and men were the immediate Covenanters. And al∣though we were then in a state and condition able to perform and answer all the Terms of the Covenant, yet was it broken and disannulled. If this came to pass by the failure of the <HI>Promise</HI> of God, it was necessary that on the making of a new Covenant he <HI>should have a Surety</HI> to undertake for
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
him, that the Covenant might be sta∣ble and everlasting. But this is false and blasphemous to imagine. It was <HI>man alone</HI> who sailed and broke that Covenant. Wherefore it was neces∣sary that upon the making of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> and that with a design and purpose that it should <HI>never be disannulled</HI> as the former was, that we should have a <HI>Surety</HI> and undertaker for us. For if that <HI>first Covenant</HI> was not firm and stable because there was no <HI>Surety</HI> to undertake for us, not∣withstanding all that Ability which we had to answer the terms of it; how much less can any other be so, now our Natures are become de∣praved and sinful? Wherefore we
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
alone were <HI>capable of a Surety</HI> properly so called; we alone <HI>stood in need of</HI> him, and without him the Covenant could not be firm, and inviolate on our parts. The Surety therefore of this Covenant is so with God for us.</P>
<P N="4">(4) "It is the <HI>Priesthood of Christ</HI> that the Apostle treats of in this place, and that alone. Wherefore, seeing the Lord Christ is the Surety of the Covenant <HI>as a priest,</HI> and all the sa∣cerdotal actings of Christ have God for their <HI>immediate object,</HI> and are per∣formed with him on our behalf, he was <HI>properly</HI> A SURETY FOR US"</P><P>DR. OWEN</P></Q>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16" MS="y"/>
The following pages are designed to state and defend that work which Christ performed in the capacity of a SURETY. I have attempted to prove that he acted in this capacity, from his infancy to his death, in obeying the commandments, and suffering the penalty of the Moral Law. This is the DOCTRINE, however expressed, which these lines are intended to maintain. I contend not about parti∣cular words or modes of expression. THE TRUTH ITSELF, and not any par∣ticular mode of expressing it, is that which I labour to defend. Neither is it every particular <HI>circumstance</HI> at∣tending the life, death, resurrection and ascension of Christ, as they are
<PB N="xv" REF="17" MS="y"/>
stated in this Essay, which I contend for. I have mentioned these circumstances as I found them, or as I think I found them, in the scriptures, and that for the sake of illustration; but they are not all <HI>essential</HI> to the main point, as expressed above.—Therefore, if any one should think it his duty to ani∣madvert upon this Essay, let him not spend his time in cavilling at meer ex∣pressions or circumstances; but attend to the main Doctrine in question.</P>

<HEAD>PART I. The Doctrine stated.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. On the state of Man by Nature.</HEAD>
<P>I Take it for granted that there is a GOD, who presides over the universe, and takes notice of the moral actions of men; and conse∣quently that there is a future state of rewards and punishments, of happi∣ness and misery. It is also reasonable to believe that the MORAL LAW deli∣vered by Moses, and continued as a rule of life to Christians under the New Testament dispensation, is, in
<PB N="2" REF="19"/>
fubstance, the very same law which naturally binds all men; and by which God will judge the world. This law dictates to us our duty towards God and man. It also promises happiness to the obedient, and condemns the sinner.</P>
<P N="1">1. The moral law requires that we love the only true God, with all our heart, soul, mind and strength: this is the first and great commandment. The second is like unto it, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy∣self. Upon these two commandments hang all the law.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 22. 37-40.</BIBL></NOTE> Whatsoever flows naturally from this principle of love, is a part of the moral law,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 13. 8-10.</BIBL></NOTE> and is binding upon all mankind.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 3. 19.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. This law is enforced by a pro∣mise, and a threatning. If thou wilt
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>
enter into life, keep the Command∣ments:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 19. 17.</BIBL> <BIBL>Rom. 10. 5.</BIBL></NOTE> but cursed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gal. 3. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>—To be bound, <HI>upon these terms,</HI> to keep the commandments, is what the Scriptures usually intend by the expression, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>under the law.</HI>"<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 3. 19. Chap. 6. 14.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>All men are, by nature, under this law. The heathen nations, who had not this law as delivered by Moses, were nevertheless bound by it, as it is made known by the light of nature. All mankind (lunaticks, idiots, and infants excepted) may, and actually do know enough of this law to consti∣tute them sinners, and leave them without excuse when they act con∣trary to it.</P>
<P>In speaking of a law of nature, we have no occasion to strive with Philo∣sophers
<PB N="4" REF="21"/>
about what they call <HI>innate ideas.</HI> Equally impertinent would it be to enquire, what impressions of duty men would have had, if they were otherwise framed and situated than what they are; that is, if they were not every where surrounded with the visible works of their Creator: if they were not furnished with powers of body and mind suited to perceive these works: and if they had not been made Male and Female, Parents, Children, Brethren, &amp;c. Taking men as they are, it is evident they are abundantly furnished with the means of knowledge, to render them accountable to their maker for all their ways.</P>
<P>That which may be known of God, says Paul, is manifest unto men, for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him, from the
<PB N="5" REF="22"/>
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head; so that they are without excuse.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 19, 20.</BIBL></NOTE> It can do nothing toward invalidating these words of Scripture, to recount the many absurd notions of the heathen concerning the num∣ber and quality of their gods; because nothing more absurd has been either thought or done by them in regard to religion, than what has been done by those who have lived under the superior light of revelation. If Tran∣substantiation cannot prove that we are without a Bible, no more can idol∣atry prove that the heathen are with∣out a law of nature.</P>
<P>Having shewed that the heathens transgressed the first part of the law, (our duty toward God) the Apostle proceeds to speak of those things
<PB N="6" REF="23"/>
which regard man and man. And here, speaking of the propensity be-between the different sexes, which stands at the head of all other relati∣ons among mankind, he calls it <HI>natu∣ral;</HI> and a similar propensity between those of the same sex, he calls <HI>unnatu∣ral;</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 2, 6, 27.</BIBL></NOTE> therefore highly criminal. Is any other argument necessary to evince its criminality, beside an ap∣peal to the human breast? I hope not.—In like manner, the other relations formed by nature between parents and their offspring, between children of the fame parents, &amp;c. demand suitable affection and behavour; and to counteract that affecton is to act an <HI>unnatural</HI> part. Indeed the scriptures every where appeal to the human breast, as fixing the law of natural affection. Thus.—Can a woman for∣get her sucking child?<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Isa. 40. 15.</BIBL></NOTE>—Ye being
<PB N="7" REF="24"/>
evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 7. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>—Like as a father piti∣eth his children,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Psal. 103. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> &amp;c. &amp;c. Remark∣able are the words of Paul. Rom. 2. 14, 15. Here he says that the Gen∣tiles who had not the written law of Moses, were nevertheless a law unto themselves. He says they did the work of the law <HI>by nature,</HI> which shew∣ed it written in their hearts: not in∣deed by perfect <HI>obedience</HI> to it; but, as he says, by their mutual accusations and excuses touching the breaches of it. In this sense we see many in our own days doing the work of the law, even while they are in the act of dis∣obeying it. We can see the most in∣famous characters amongst men accu∣sing each other, and by their rapid exchange of the odious terms, <HI>drunk∣ard, whore, thief, lyar, ungrateful,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="8" REF="25"/>
we see them very quick sighted, and very capable of doing that work of the law which consists in condemning the guilty. Now Paul says they did this in his days, <HI>by nature.</HI> Moreover,</P>
<P>The Apostle shews, not only that the heathen had a sense of right and wrong, but also that they knew the judgment of God against sinners.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 32.</BIBL></NOTE> And when we consider how universal∣ly <HI>sacrifices</HI> prevailed amongst the hea∣then nations, we see Paul's testimony corroborated; and we may conclude that a dread of future punishment ever haunts the guilty breast, in a greater or less degree.</P>
<P>There are two opposite extremes which some men run into upon this subject. Some deny the very exist∣ence of the law of nature; whilst
<PB N="9" REF="26"/>
others contend for it's sufficiency to bring <HI>fallen</HI> man to happiness. Both parties are wrong. The law points out our duty, finds us guilty, con∣demns us, and there it leaves us.</P>
<P>When we read the history of all times and nations,—when we consi∣der what daily passes before our own eyes and in our own breasts, we find a melancholy proof of the scripture doctrine concerning our depraved state. The most renowned of the heathen Philosophers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Socrates.</NOTE> died in the prosession of idolatry;<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>Rollin's Ancient History.</BIBL></NOTE> the chief man<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Paul.</NOTE> in the strictest sect among the Jews, was found disaffected to the true character of God;<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Tim. 1. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> and christians unanimously say—<Q REND="inline">"In many things we all offend."<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>James 3. 2.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>How then shall man be just with God? Hail! thou SUN of RIGH∣TEOUSNESS!
<PB N="10" REF="27"/>
From the gloom of guilt and despair we turn our eyes toward thy chearing beams.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="28"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II. On the UNION between Christ and his people.</HEAD>
<P>IF in tracing the lowly steps of Immanuel from Bethlehem to Calvary, we should view him as a single indi∣vidual acting for himself alone, much of the beauty of his sacred history would be lost. To guard against this, it may be useful to take some notice in this place of the unity, or oneness, of Christ and his Elect. The in∣spired writers speak much of this union, and illustrate it in a variety of ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. This union was fore-ordained—it was fixed upon in the Divine mind
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>
before the foundation of the world: see Ephesians, Chap. 1. throughout.</P>
<P N="2">2. This union began to appear un∣der the Old Testament dispensation. It was prefigured by various types, even from the Creation downward. Adam and Eve:<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 2. 21-23.</BIBL> <BIBL>Eph. 5. 22-32.</BIBL></NOTE>—Every High-Priest, who bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his shoulders and on his breast:<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Exod. 28. 9-29.</BIBL></NOTE>—Every animal sacrifi∣ced <HI>in the people's stead</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 22. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>—all these pre∣figured, among other things, the union of Christ and his people. The Temple itself appears to have been a Type of Christ in such a sense as to comprehend his people.<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 2. 18-21.</BIBL> <BIBL>Eph. 2. 21, 22.</BIBL></NOTE> Nor did this union appear to saints of old only in types and shadows. The spirit of Christ was in his people, even before he came in the flesh:<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Pet. 1. 11.</BIBL></NOTE> and this spirit,
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>
by testifying of Christ, fixed the faith, hope, and love of the saints in him.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 8. 56.</BIBL> <BIBL>Heb. 11. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> It is true that there is something <HI>pecu∣liar</HI> in the gift of the divine spirit un∣der the New Testament dispensation; nevertheless the saints of old were not destitute of this amazing gift.</P>
<P N="3">3. This union between Christ and his Elect was drawn still closer, when the divine Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 1. 14.</BIBL></NOTE> For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the seed of Abra∣ham. At this time, and in this way, the Eternal WORD became the SON of God,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 1. 35.</BIBL></NOTE> and the BROTHER of all Gods' children. Thus he that sancti∣fieth, and they who are sanctified by him, are all of one Father, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them his <HI>Brethren.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 2. 11.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="31"/>
4. Adam was created the Foederal Head of his posterity—he stood as our representative, and we were all in his loins. So long as <HI>He</HI> obeyed, <HI>We</HI> obeyed in him; and when <HI>He</HI> sell, <HI>We</HI> also sell in him. This union pre∣figured that of Christ and his people.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 5. 12, 14.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. This union is compared with that which subsists between the Root, Stock, and Branches of a Tree:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 15. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>—and with the union which is formed be∣tween the Foundation, Corner-Stone, and superstructure of an Edifice:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eph. 2. 21, 22.</BIBL></NOTE>—and with the union which subsists be∣tween a Husband and Wife, particu∣larly that of Adam and Eve. Upon this account we are said to be mem∣bers of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eph. 5. 30.</BIBL></NOTE>—Another union largely insisted upon in the word of God, is
<PB N="15" REF="32"/>
that which we see between the Head and members of one and the same li∣ving Body:<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eph. 4. 3-16.</BIBL> <BIBL>1 Cor. 12. 12-27.</BIBL></NOTE> where One Spirit ani∣mates all the members, and governs every motion of the body.—This last comparison seems to carry the Union of Christ with his people, to the great∣est possible perfection—it approaches to the idea of personal identity. In∣deed the Spirit of Christ dwelling in, and informing, and actuating all the members of his body, the church, forms such a wonderful union between him and them, that he compares it to the Oneness of the Father and the Son!<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 17. 21-23.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. To the idea of union, we must add that of a SURETY.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 7. 22.</BIBL></NOTE> A surety, we all know, is a Bonds-man, or one who gives security for another: so that, if
<PB N="16" REF="33"/>
the debtor himself fails, his surety must pay his debts.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Prov. 22. 26, 27.</BIBL></NOTE> The debt we owe to God, considered as his <HI>creatures,</HI> is, a perfect and continued obedience to all his righteous commandments: but as we are not only creatures, but <HI>sinners,</HI> therefore justice has another demand, viz. satisfaction, or atonement for the sin committed.—If we carry the sen∣timents of this Section in our minds, the next will appear more beautiful and interesting.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="17" REF="34" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>SECTION III. A summary view of that important Work, in which every jot and tittle, precept and penalty, of the Moral Law, are amply fulfilled in our Divine Surety.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our first parents had sinned, and thereby forfeited the di∣vine favour, and brought misery and death into the world, then divine mercy began to unfold itself. <HI>The Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head,</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 3. 15.</BIBL></NOTE> was the first gracious promise to sinful man. Sacrifices also were immediately appointed, which served to cast light upon this obscure promise.
<PB N="18" REF="35"/>
Although this light was small, when compared with ours, yet it was suffici∣ent to give hope to the guilty, and we know not how far the spirit of Christ might open their understandings to comprehend it's import. Certainly when they saw a Lamb sacrificed in their stead, and their shame and na∣kedness, which sin had discovered, hid by the natural cloathing of the slaugh∣tered victim,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 3. 10, 21.</BIBL></NOTE> they might comprehend something of the true intent of the Promise: and Paul informs us that it was by <HI>Faith</HI> Abel offered a more ex∣cellent sacrifice than Cain.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 11. 4.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>At sundry times and in divers man∣ners<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 1. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> this first promise was repeated, and further explained; the light in∣creasing more and more as the time advanced. At length, Daniel fixed the time for the Messiah's appearance, and

<P>Judas, having received a band of men, and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, now came with lan∣terns, and torches, and weapons: and Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth to meet them, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

<P>Then the band, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took Je∣sus and bound him,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 18. 12.</BIBL></NOTE> and led him a∣way to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests,

Ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.

<P>The priests and elders having thus condemned Jesus, they consulted to∣gether again,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark 15. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> and resolved to carry

him before Pilate the Roman Gover∣nor, that he likewise might pass sen∣tence upon him. Without this they could not accomplish their purpose, because the power of life and death was now taken out of their hands.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 18. 31.</BIBL></NOTE> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas, unto the hall of Judgment. Pilate went out unto them and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? They answered, If he were not a ma∣lefactor, we would not have deliver∣ed him unto thee.

<P>Pilate being obliged to proceed to the tryal, the Jews began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that
<PB N="39" REF="56"/>
he himself is Christ, a King.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 2.</BIBL></NOTE> Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus answered, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Jews asked Jesus if he was the Son of God, he answered directly, <HI>I am;</HI> but when Pi∣late asked him if he was a King, he first sets him right about the import of the question, and then he answers it.—The question which the jews asked needed no explanation—it was plain they intended to ask if he were the Son of God in such a sense as would be blasphemy in any meer creature: to this he could directly reply, I am: But as Pilate intend∣ed (or might be understood) to ask if he were a <HI>temporal</HI> Monarch, therefore Jesus entered into this explanation.</NOTE> Pilate replied, Am I a jew? thine own nation, and the chief priests, have dilivered thee unto me, what hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should

not be delivered to the jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pi∣late therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am, (or, <HI>that which I am)</HI> A King. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness un∣to the truth: every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</P>
<P>Pilate having found that Jesus dis∣allowed <HI>fighting,</HI> and only proposed to erect a kingdom by bearing witness to truth, he plainly saw that his king∣dom could never interfere with the authority of Caesar.—What is truth! said he; and immediately went out to the jews, and said, I find in him no fault at all.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 18. 33-38.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>This exasperated the jews much, and they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching

throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 5.</BIBL></NOTE> Mark informs us that they accused him of <HI>many</HI> things: but he answered nothing.

<P>It is easy to see in Pilate, the great man in embarrassment. He evidently dreaded condemning Jesus, for fear of what might happen in the next world: but then he had measures to keep with the Jews, and with his master, Caesar; and this at length had the ascendency. At present, perhaps, he hoped to extricate himself from this dilemma, by the next step he took.—When Pilate heard of <HI>Galilee,</HI> he asked whether the man were a Gali∣lea?
<PB N="42" REF="59"/>
And as soon as he heard that he belonged to HEROD'S Jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who happened (so to speak) to be at Jerusalem at that time.</P>
<P>When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad, for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. Then he questioned with him in many words, but he an∣swered him nothing.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 6-9.</BIBL></NOTE>—The expecta∣tion of this great man being raised so high, his disappointment must have been very mortisying.—The chief priests and scribes stood and vehe∣mently accused Jesus.—We are not informed particularly of what they now accused him; but we may learn from the effect, that they ran upon

his having assumed the titles and honours of the Messiah; for the in∣sults he met with were plainly in derision of that.—And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 10, 11.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Pilate called the chief priests and the rulers together, and in the hear∣ing of the multitude he addressed them thus:—Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people, and behold, I having ex∣amined him before you, have found no fault in him touching the things whereof ye accuse him. No, nor yet Herod, for I sent you to him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. (For of necessity he must re∣lease one unto them at the feast) But the chief priest and elders persuaded
<PB N="44" REF="61"/>
the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. And they cried all at once, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas. Pilate willing to release Jesus, speak again unto them; but they cried, Crucify him, Crucify him. And he said unto them the third time, Why? what evil hath he done? I find no cause of death in him, I will there∣fore chastise him, and let him go. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he should be crucified: and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 13-23.</BIBL></NOTE> When Pilate saw that he could prevail no∣thing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it. Then answered
<PB N="45" REF="62"/>

<P>The soldiers having received orders to crucify Jesus, took him first and scourged him.

Pilate now goes forth again to the Jews, and thus accosts them:—Be∣hold, I bring him forth unto you, that ye may know I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe, and Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, Cru∣cify him, Crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him. The Jews answered, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 19. 4-8.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>When Pilate heard that Jesus cal∣led himself the Son of God, he was the more afraid, and went again into the judgment-hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate

said unto him, Speakest thou not un∣to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have pow∣er to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above.</P>
<P>Once more Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out, If thou let this man go <HI>thou art not Caesars friend;</HI> whosoever maketh himself a King, speaketh against Caesar. When Pilate heard <HI>that saying,</HI> he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat. And he said unto the Jews, Behold your king!

<P>As they led him to Calvary, there followed him a great company of peo∣ple, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him; but he said unto them, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children: for, behold, the days are coming in the which ye shall say, Blessed are the barren and

besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the sol∣diers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead al∣ready, they brake not his legs: but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forth with came there out blood and water.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The spear thrust into his side is thought to have reached his heart; for the water issuing from the wound seems to shew that the pericardium was pierced, and that Jesus had been some time dead.

<HEAD>SECTION, IV. As the payment of the uttermost farthing com∣pletes the satisfaction, which is immediately followed by giving a discharge; there∣fore, as our Surety has now fully paid our debts, it is expected that he should be discharged from the prison of the grave; and also take possession of the reward of Righteousness.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the important question is brought to a crisis, and the Judge of all is called upon, by both parties, to
<PB N="59" REF="76"/>
interpose and give decision.—Jesus had called God his Father in a sense which implied equality of nature;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 5. 16-18. Chap. 10. 30-33.</BIBL></NOTE> and accordingly he called upon all men to honour the Son even as they honoured the Father:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 5. 23.</BIBL></NOTE> The Jews, upon the other hand, called this Blasphemy.—Again: Jesus maintained that all men, himself only excepted, were sinners; and that they could obtain the divine favour only through him.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 3. 14-21. Chap. 6. 27.—58. and 10. 1-18. and 14. 6.</BIBL></NOTE> But the Jews could by no means admit the truth of this: they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, could not submit to be saved by the righteousness of our incarnate God.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 10. 1-4.</BIBL></NOTE> They had no objection to a Messiah who should tell them what good thing
<PB N="60" REF="77"/>
<HI>they</HI> should do to obtain eternal lise; but they were offended at the thought of his being the end of the law for righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth.</P>
<P>These were the chief points in de∣bate between Jesus and the Jewish nation; and when Jesus was dead and buried, they hoped that this contro∣versy was decided in their favour. They argued in a triumphant and in∣sulting manner even while Jesus was nailed to the Cross:—He saved others, let him <HI>save himself,</HI> (said they) if he be the Christ, the chosen of God. Let Christ the King of Israel descend from the Cross, that we may see and believe. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him; for he said, <HI>I am the Son of God.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 23. 35.</BIBL> <BIBL>Mark 15. 31.</BIBL> <BIBL>Mat. 27. 43.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>This triumph was premature. The decision of the question did not turn
<PB N="61" REF="78"/>
upon his coming down from the Cross, but upon his rising again from the dead. This was to be the grand proof on either side. If Christ did not rife from the dead, the Jews were right in rejecting him as the promised Mes∣siah; but if he did, then all he taught is TRUE, and the Jews were guilty of a murder the most atrocious that could be committed.</P>
<P>This medium of proof had been pre∣viously fixed upon. The Jews, more than once, demanded a sign of his being the Messiah; and Jesus referred them to his resurrection.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 12. 38-40.</BIBL> <BIBL>John 2. 18-22.</BIBL></NOTE> They did not forget this, as we shall see.</P>
<P>Jesus was crucified and buried on the Jew's preparation-day, that is, the day before the sabbath.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 19. 31.</BIBL></NOTE> The sabbath day commenced at sun-set,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lev. 23. 32.</BIBL></NOTE> and it was as much as they could do to
<PB N="62" REF="79"/>
to get the Bodies from the Cross, be∣fore its commencement.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 19. 31.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>On the day after the day of prepa∣ration, that is, on the sabbath day, which, as was observed, began when the sun was setting, the chief priests and pharisees came together to Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive. After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch, go your way, make it as sure as you can. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>Dan. 6. 17.</BIBL> where a similar precaution is used by Darius in the case of Daniel.</NOTE> and setting a watch.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 27. 62-66.</BIBL></NOTE> Thus while
<PB N="63" REF="80"/>
the chief priests and pharisees very prudently guarded against fraud, re∣solving, no doubt, to exhibit the body of Jesus after the third day as an im∣postor, they put the truth of his resur∣rection beyond all reasonable doubt, by furnishing a number of unexcep∣tionable witnesses to it, even the Roman Soldiers, whose testimony they themselves could not refuse: For be∣hold! At the appointed hour, the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door of the sepul∣chre. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow; and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 28. 1-4.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Jesus, without an Angel, could easily have opened himself a passage from the tomb; but it was meet that
<PB N="64" REF="81"/>
Angels should attend and open the door to their rising Lord: It was meet that his <HI>servant</HI> should dismiss a band of ruffians, and send them, terrified, to tell their employers the awful tale: There was also a propriety in the Angel's opening a free passage into the sepulchre for the friends of Jesus, and in waiting there until their arrival.</P>
<P>Very early in the morning, upon the first day of the week, the women came unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the Sun,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark 16. 2.</BIBL></NOTE> bringing the spices which they had prepared.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 24.</BIBL> 1. It appears that they were dis∣satisfied with the hasty manner in which (upon ac∣count of the approaching sabbath) the body of their Lord had been embalmed: so they came, when the sabbath was past, to do it properly.</NOTE> And as they went along they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepul∣chre?
<PB N="65" REF="82"/>
for it was great.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They seem unacquainted with all that had passed since the evening of the day on which their Lord was crucified, when the disciples rolled the stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</NOTE> And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark. 16, 3, 4.</BIBL></NOTE> And they entered in, but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 24. 3.</BIBL></NOTE> Upon this, one of them (Mary Magdalene) ran to seek the Apostles, to tell them the <HI>distressing</HI> news.

<P>While Mary Magdalene was gone in quest of the Apostles, it appears that the other women (having pro∣bably searched round the garden in

<P>After the women had departed, Peter and John came to the sepulchre, to examine the truth of what Mary Magdalene had told them concerning the body of Jesus being taken away; and Mary herself followed them. Peter and John having entered the sepulchre, and not finding the body of their Lord, they seem to have be∣lieved, as Mary did, that some one had taken it away: as yet they knew nothing of his resurrection. Then
<PB N="68" REF="85"/>
they went again unto their own home.—But Mary stood without at the se∣pulchre, weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre, and seeth two Angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain: And they say unto her, Woman why weepest thou? she saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, (probably being affrighted) and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, sup∣posing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>
saith unto her, <HI>Mary.</HI> She turned herself and saith unto him, MASTER!—Calling her by her name with his usual tone of voice, she knew him and would have embraced him; but he declined this for the present, giving her to understand that, as he was not yet ascended, she would have other opportunities for expressing her joy; but that she must go immediately and tell his <HI>Brethren.</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 20. 3-17.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>While these things were passing, the company of women who saw the Angels at the sepulchre, and who were despatched by them to tell the disciples what they saw and heard, found <HI>some</HI> of the disciples, and deli∣vered their message to them; amongst whom were Cleopas and his compa∣nion.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 24. 22, 23.</BIBL></NOTE> These women going in quest of some other of the disciples, Jesus
<PB N="70" REF="87"/>
met them, saying, All hail! And they came and fell at his feet, and worship∣ped him. Jesus saith unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 28. 9, 10.</BIBL></NOTE>—<HI>Now</HI> these women had something more to tell: Before, they could only say, We have seen a vision of Angels who said he is alive: but now they could say, We have seen him.</P>
<P>While the women were going to spread these glad tidings, some of the watch came into the City, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a great bribe unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 28. 11-13.</BIBL></NOTE>—The

priests could hardly be so stupid as not to know what judgment the world would form of guards telling what happened <HI>while they were asleep:</HI> but absurd as this might be, it was the best colour which could be put upon the matter.</P>
<P>The women having found their brethren, told all things which they had heard and seen. And they, when they had heard that Jesus was alive, and had been seen, and had spoken these things, believed not.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark 16. 10. 11.</BIBL></NOTE> Peter, however, who had been mentioned <HI>by name</HI> as one unto whom the news should be told,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark 16. 7.</BIBL></NOTE> arose, and ran a second time unto the sspulchre: and stooping down, he beheld nothing but the linen clothes, and departed, wonder∣ing in himself at that which was come to pass.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 24. 12.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>The Lord's appearance to Peter, mentioned 1 Cor. 15. 5. may have
<PB N="72" REF="89"/>
happened as he was returning from the sepulchre this second time; for we are certain it took place on the day of the resurrection.</P>
<P>After this, Jesus appeared to two of his disciples who were going to Emmaus; and a long and interesting conversation took place. Its length obliges me to omit it here, but the reader may see it in Luke 24.—These two disciples returned the same even∣ing to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven, (that is, the Apostles) and others with them. Before they came, Peter had arrived with a con∣firmation of the report first given by the women, and therefore the Apostles accost these two disciples thus, THE LORD IS RISEN INDEED, <HI>and hath ap∣peared unto Simon.</HI> Then Cleopas and his companion relate what they knew; and as they spake, Jesus himself stood
<PB N="73" REF="90"/>
in the midst of them; and gave them every demonstration that men are capable of receiving.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 24. 33-48.</BIBL> <BIBL>John 20. 19. 23.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>But Thomas, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said un∣to him, We have seen the Lord! But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</P>
<P>And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you. Then, turning to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands: and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side.—The sight of
<PB N="74" REF="91"/>
Jesus must have been sufficient to prove his refurrection; but the know∣ledge which he now shewed of what was doing when he was absent in body, brought his divinity so strongly to mind, that Thomas answered by say∣ing unto Jesus, My Lord, and my God!<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 20. 24-29.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Jesus having first by Angels,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 28. 7.</BIBL></NOTE> and afterwards in person,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 28. 10.</BIBL></NOTE> ordered his dis∣ciples to go home to Galilee, with a promise that they should see him there, they went. And when they were come to their respective homes, they followed their occupations as usual: and particularly the Apostles, who pursued their old trade of fishing upon the Lake. There were together, Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, James, John, and two other disciples. Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They
<PB N="75" REF="92"/>

When the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but they did not know him: owing, probably, to its being as yet some-what dark, and they being some distance from the shore. Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered, No. He said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They did so; and now they were not able to draw it for the mul∣titude of fishes. Therefore John saith unto Peter, It is the Lord!

<HEAD>PART II. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="objection">
<HEAD>OBJECTION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE famous Author of the Age of Reason says,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The doctrine of Redemption has for its basis, an idea of pecuniary justice, and not that of moral justice. If I owe a person money, and am not able to pay him, and he threatens to put me in prison, another person may take the debt upon himself, and pay it for me; but if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case is changed: moral justice cannot take the in∣nocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself.</HI>"</Q> To this we reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. This distinction between <HI>moral</HI> Justice, and <HI>pecuniary</HI> Justice, has no
<PB N="82" REF="99"/>
foundation in the nature of things. Justice is <HI>moral</HI> Justice still, whether it has to do with money or with mur∣der. When the moral law says, Owe no man any thing, it delivers a <HI>moral</HI> precept, and speaks the language of <HI>moral</HI> Justice, no less than when it says, Thou shalt not kill. What! is it no <HI>crime</HI> to contract debts when we are not able to pay? Surely it is. Yet if my friend is willing to become Surety for me, however innocent he may be, moral Justice requires that he should smart for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a Surety is admitted in any case, his admission is founded, not upon Justice <HI>only,</HI> but also upon mercy. If I owe money and am not able to pay it; and if Justice admits of ano∣ther person taking the debt upon himself and discharging it for me, this is uniting Justice and mercy to∣gether.
<PB N="83" REF="100"/>
When my friend sees me in distress, takes my place, and discharges my debts; this is an act of <HI>mercy;</HI>—Justice admits, but mercy performs it. Again: When my creditor demands payment of my Surety, his doing so is an act of Justice. So that, in this case, Justice <HI>demands,</HI> and mercy <HI>grants</HI> payment.</P>
<P N="3">3. From hence we may discover the principle upon which the office of a Surety is founded. It is ordained chiefly for the sake of harmonizing Justice and mercy. These two attri∣butes, in many cases, seem to clash. Justice might require the law to be put in force against an unfortunate or dishonest debtor; while mercy might prompt a Judge to spare him, either for his own, or for his miserable fami∣ly's sake. What is to be done in this case? If Justice is heard, mercy cries
<PB N="84" REF="101"/>
in vain: if mercy prevails, Justice re∣tires dissatisfied: but by the interposi∣tion of a Surety, mercy and Justice kiss and embrace each other. Does this render either attribute less ami∣able? Far from it: It heightens their native charms.—If Justice had refused the proposal of a Surety—a Surety every way able to answer its demands, would it not seem too implacable? And upon the other hand, if mercy had insisted upon the debt being can∣celled without payment, when the Surety could well afford it, would it not appear an enemy to Justice; and might not the creditor justly complain?</P>
<P N="4">4. Having discovered the principle upon which the office of a Surety pro∣ceeds, to determine, in any particular case, whether a Surety may or may not be admitted, we must consider whether the circumstances of the case
<PB N="85" REF="102"/>
be such, that, all things considered, the admission of a Surety can subserve the mutual purposes of Justice and mercy.</P>
<P N="5">5. We can now explain how it comes to pass that human laws can so seldom admit of a Surety in criminal cases. I say, <HI>seldom,</HI> because even human laws sometimes go this far: as, for instance, when a <HI>crime</HI> is punish∣ed by a fine, which is often the case, a man's friend may pay it for him. Again: sometimes when a crime is committed, the criminal is set at liberty by finding sureties for his future good behaviour; and if he afterwards is guilty of the same crime, his sureties are liable to suffer in his stead. And again: <HI>National Hostages</HI> are a very ancient and general expedient. In this case it is universally allowed that, when any person delivers himself up
<PB N="86" REF="103"/>
as the hostage or surety of his nation, he is liable to suffer for the crimes of his country. But, as has been obser∣ved, it is not always that human laws can admit of a surety in criminal cases. This is not because our legislators con∣demn the principle itself; for if they did, how could they adopt it in the instances just alluded to? but the rea∣son is, They find, in certain cases, the circumstances are such that a Surety cannot be made to subserve the mu∣tual purposes of justice and mercy, or answer any good end; but would ra∣ther be attended with many evil con∣sequences. For instance: When mur∣der is committed, justice demands life for life; and here it is impossible, amongst men, to make use of a surety. Because (1) Who would willingly die for a murderer? (2) If such a person could be found, who gave him power
<PB N="87" REF="104"/>
over his life, to dispose of it in such a way? (3) There would be no security for the future conduct of the criminal; and therefore it would only be depri∣ving society of a useful member, to give back one who might immediately commence his former destructive practices. (4) It could not even serve the purpose of mercy, because all that mercy might gain by the salvation of the criminal, it would lose again in the death of his surety.</P>
<P N="6">6. For these causes we grant to the objector, that, in many cases of a cri∣minal nature, <Q REND="inline">"All the circumstances are so changed, that moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty;"</Q> that is, justice cannot, under these circumstances, admit of a surety. But then, when these circumstances come to be named, not one of them can be objected to the Suretiship of Christ.
<PB N="88" REF="105"/>
For instance, (1) He had absolute power over his own life, and a sove∣reign right to dispose of it as he saw good. Moreover, having humbled himself to the state of a servant, he acted, not only by his own choice, but in obedience to the commandment of his Father. (2) No individual beside himself sustained the least inconveni∣ence from his undertaking. He did not redeem his people that they might continue their pernicious practices; but made it absolutely certain that they should leave them off, and begin a life of righteousness, the moment they should be made acquainted with what he had done for them. Their language upon this occasion is, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man. I restore him four-sold. (3) In substituting Jesus in the room
<PB N="89" REF="106"/>
of the guilty, all the ends of mercy, as well as divine justice, were fully answered: Myriads of men were thus raised from the greatest depth of guilt and misery, to an eternity of holiness and happiness. And although this cost our divine Surety much, yet, in the end he obtained what he deemed an ample recompense. He had power, not only to lay down his life, but also to take it again: he saw of the travel of his soul, and was satisfied: he saw the eternal happiness of his people se∣cured; and this gave him infinite de∣light: he saw every perfection of the God-head glorified in the highest, and the foundation laid for eternal halle∣lujah's from all the blessed: and he saw himself, in his human nature, crowned with that glory which, in his divine nature, he had with his Father before the world was. These
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>
considerations go to prove that it was perfectly consistent with justice, as well as glorious to divine mercy, to substitute Jesus in the room of his guilty people. To this we must add,</P>
<P N="7">7. It would not be consistent with justice to admit a <HI>sinner</HI> to glory, with∣out this substitution. Mercy might provide such a surety as justice could admit; but mercy could not, consis∣tently with justice, bestow happiness on the guilty without a Surety. No reason can be given why justice should refuse this Surety; but many reasons may be given why it should demand him. For instance: If the sinner had been saved without this Surety, the divine law would be made void. The part of a subject is to obey; the part of a Sovereign is to keep up the autho∣rity of his laws. Though subjects neglect their part, the Sovereign may
<PB N="91" REF="108"/>
do his. Though the law be broken, yet while that treatment is given to disobedience and obedience which the Law-giver has appointed, the autho∣rity of the law is still kept up: but if the Sovereign neglect his part, dis∣pense with the execution of the law, then the law passes away, and, in effect, the Governor resigns his autho∣rity and tolerates all manner of wicked∣ness and confusion. It is shocking to that reason which God has given us, to see a magistrate without power over his subjects; to see a parent without authority among his children, or a master among his servants: but this is nothing in comparison with be∣holding GOD destitute of authority among his creatures. In other cases, this want of authority would produce confusion only in kingdoms or families; but in this case it would bring the
<PB N="92" REF="109"/>
whole universe into disorder. The former would infer confusion only for a <HI>time:</HI> but this introduces confusion to <HI>eternity.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude this article with two very opposite specimens of reason∣ing; and leave the Reader to his choice.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Paine, after telling his readers that, <Q REND="inline">"No <HI>external</HI> evidence can, at this long distance of time, be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine of redemption or not," adds, "therefore the question can only be referred to the <HI>internal</HI> evidence which the thing carries in itself; and this," continues he, "affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication; for the inter∣nal evidence is, that the doctrine of redemption has for its basis, an idea of pecuniary justice, and not that of moral justice."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="110"/>
Jonathan says, <Q REND="inline">"As the character of THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR can no where be published but along with the doctrine of redemption, I am assured, by seeing the GRANDEST CHARACTER thence arising, that the doctrine must be true. For to suppose that the bare notion, or idea of any thing greater than God could ever be any where imagined, would be the wildest of all absurdities. Moreover, it must be very evident that that view of God, which the lower it abases the pride of man, raises his comfort and joy the higher;—which reduces man to the most unreserved dependence, while it exalts him to the summit of all happiness; could never be the contrivance of man, whose strongest impulse is towards the gratifying of his pride, and whose joy naturally rises or sinks according to the success
<PB N="94" REF="111"/>
thereof. Therefore, when the doctrine of redemption, and the character of God thence resulting, are conveyed to my mind by the same testimony, I have no room to doubt, that God, who alone can describe his own cha∣racter, is the testifier of both."<P>"This doctrine," continues Jona∣than, "while it proves all my former wisdom to be foolishness, opens to me a new and more delightful source of knowledge, throwing light upon a thousand facts that I could never ac∣count for before; shewing me a no less satisfactory than wonderful propriety, in all the extraordinary circumstances attending the Birth, Life, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus, and the ministry of his witnesses.—It throws light upon all the ancient sacred writings, and the extraordinary facts recorded in them, from the creation downwards.
<PB N="95" REF="112"/>
It sets my mind at rest, as to all the difficulties about the divine character, and the condition of man, which oc∣casionally pinched me before.—I am now reconciled to the entrance of sin and death into the world, and the whole dark side of things, on account of the light that shines from the great∣est darkness.—I am now reconciled to the shade, on account of the magnifi∣cent picture thence arising to my view. In a word, I thence perceive a no less amiable than grand uniformity of de∣sign, in all the works of God, from first to last. Whereas, should I shut my eyes against the light issuing from thence, I am immediately lost in an unfathomable abyss of—guilt, despair, and death."</P><P>"I am fully satisfied, then, in a∣greement with the Apostles, to hold this doctrine as the Gospel, the Word,
<PB N="96" REF="113"/>
and Testimony of God; and to call it, by way of eminence, THE TRUTH, in opposition to every false gloss upon the scriptures, and every false reason∣ing about the light or law of nature, or about any of the works, or ways of God.—Let this Truth be my compa∣nion, and I will not be ashamed in the presence of all the sons of So∣crates, though joined with those of Gamaliel."</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Jonathan.</P>
<P>The objection we have now consi∣dered, is supposed to come, not only from Deists, but also from all those nominal christians who reject, <HI>altoge∣ther,</HI> the Suretiship of Christ. As Deists deny the authority of the Bible, and as the others pay but little homage to it's divinity, I have hitherto avoided the impertinence of quoting that Book
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
in a way of proof. When arguing with such persons, it is necessary to meet them upon their own ground,—the light of nature.</P>
<P>The objections which follow, come from a different people—people who admit, <HI>in part,</HI> the Suretiship of Christ; and who profess a greater reverence for the Word of God. The question, therefore, and the medium of proof, are both changed. In the former case, the question was, Can divine Justice admit of a Surety to act and suffer for sinful men? In the present case, this is granted; and the question is, What was the sinner's Surety bound to per∣form? The former question was argu∣ed upon the ground of common sense; but this is to be determined by the word of God. Not that we are now to lay aside the use of our reason; only, whereas we formerly reasoned from

<HEAD>OBJECTION II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>WE grant that Christ <HI>died</HI> as our Sub∣stitute; but his conformity to the moral law is set before us as an <HI>example,</HI> which shews that he did not obey this law for us in his life, in the same precise sense in which he obeyed it for us in his death, otherwise we should have been as fully freed from obedi∣ence to it in every respect, as we are from it's penalty or curse.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P>His sufferings also are laid before us as an example;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 15. 12, 13.</BIBL> <BIBL>1 Peter 2. 21.</BIBL> <BIBL>1 John 3. 16.</BIBL></NOTE> and if his sufferings may be both substitutional and exem∣plary, why may not his obedience to the law be so also? If it be said, His sufferings are not exemplary in the same respect wherein they are substi∣tutional; I answer, Neither is his
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>
obedience. Obedience to the law, considered as the <HI>condition</HI> of happiness, is no more binding upon his disciples<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 6. 14.</BIBL></NOTE> than sufferings are, considered as <HI>ex∣piatory.</HI> And this indeed proves that he did obey the law for us, in the same respect in which he suffered for us; that is, <HI>As our Surety;</HI> for if he had not, we should have been bound to obey it ourselves, and that upon condition of obtaining happiness; for, obedience to this law is the unaltera∣ble condition upon which we may obtain eternal life. But I need not say much in reply to this objection. A babe in Christ will see that it betrays great ignorance of the nature of Chris∣tianity. When we are told that, If Christ obeyed the law for us, we can∣not be bound to observe it even as a rule of conduct; it is just like saying,
<PB N="101" REF="120" MS="y"/>
Since Christ has obeyed the law, as well as suffered its penalty, in order to give us a title to happiness; there∣fore we are under no obligation to glorify God for his mercy!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="objection">
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
<HEAD>OBJECTION III.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>THE holiness of Christ's heart and life, in conformity to the moral law, was a ne∣cessary qualification of his own person—it qualified him for the work he came to finish as our substitute, but it was not the very work itself.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P>If Christ had not been made under the law to fulfil it as our substitute, his conformity to it could not have been a necessary qualification of his own person: Immanuel would have been perfectly holy in heart and life, if he had never been bound to obey those precepts which are proper and pecu∣liar to <HI>meer creatures</HI>—to <HI>men—sinful</HI> men. Therefore when the incarnate God was made under the law, it was <HI>to redeem;</HI> not to <HI>qualify</HI> himself for re∣deeming. Thus the objection seems
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>
to form a flat contradiction to the word of God. To set this in a clearer light, let us consider (1) The law to which Immanuel conformed: (2) His conformity to this law: (3) The dig∣nity of the person who thus conform∣ed to this law.</P>
<P N="1">1. The law to which our divine Surety conformed, is the very same law which his people were under. <Q REND="inline">"He was made under the law, to re∣deem them that were under the law."</Q> The moral law may indeed be consi∣dered as the one law unto all God's reasonable creatures, in respect of the principle from which obedience should proceed, namely, <HI>Love.</HI> But still this law has different forms, according to the different natures, and also accord∣ing to the different circumstances of those to whom it is given: so that, in some respects, the law given to Angels,
<PB N="104" REF="123"/>
and the law given to men, will be different. It will not be said unto Angels,—<Q REND="inline">"Honour thy father and thy mother."</Q> Nor yet, <Q REND="inline">"Thou shalt not commit adultery."</Q> Such precepts as these are not adapted to their nature.—Again: The moral law will differ also according to the different circum∣stances of creatures of the same species. I shall mention two remarkable instan∣ces of this, which cast considerable light upon the question before us.—The first is that remarkable difference in the moral duties of men, which is caused by the entrance of Sin. The precept, <Q REND="inline">"Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour as thy self,"</Q> although it be the same precept both before and after the fall; yet it <HI>now</HI> binds us to do many things which would not have been our duty, if we had never sinned. For instance: If we had not sinned, this
<PB N="105" REF="124"/>
precept would only bind us to love the Righteous; for we and all our neighbours would have been of that description; but since we have sinned, this same precept binds us to love the unrighteous; for we and all our neigh∣bours are (at least by nature) of this character.—Another important differ∣ence in the moral law, which de∣pends upon the circumstances of those to whom it is given, is the difference between this law considered only as a rule of life, and considered as prescrib∣ing the condition of acquiring happi∣ness. This is not a fanciful but a real and important difference; and the persons to whom I now speak, will admit it. They know that all men are by nature under this law as pre∣scribing the terms and condition of acquiring happiness; but the believer in Jesus has a title to glory independ∣ent
<PB N="106" REF="125"/>
of his own obedience; and he conforms to the law only as a rule of conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are to consider Christ's con∣formity to this law. And here we must observe, (1) Christ was made un∣der the law, not before, but after the entrance of sin;—not when it bound man to love none but the righteous; but when it bound us to love sinners. (2) Christ's conformity to the law was constant and universal; that is, he <HI>continued</HI> in <HI>all</HI> things that are written in the book of the law to do them. (3) His conformity to this law was properly <HI>obedience;</HI> that is, submission to its au∣thority. This is plainly taught us when we are told that He was made <HI>under the law;</HI> for that expression always imports the authority of the law over its subjects. To which we must add, (4) Christ was not only
<PB N="107" REF="126"/>
bound to obey this law, as a rule of life, but in order to merit the reward of obedience. This is what the scrip∣tures usually intend by the phrase, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Under the law;</HI>"</Q> and there is no rea∣son for understanding it differently when we are informed that Christ was <HI>made under the law.</HI> Upon the contra∣ry, we have every reason for under∣standing the words in their usual sense; for, while he was fulfilling every jot and tittle of the law, we see him, not in the state of enjoying, but of merit∣ing the reward; and he obtained it DECAUSE he had loved righteousness and hated iniquity.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 1. 9.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Consider now the Dignity of the Person who thus obeyed the law. He is not a meer creature, like those upon whom this law is binding. He is the independent Jehovah.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Jer. 33. 16.</BIBL></NOTE> True, he has
<PB N="108" REF="127"/>
clothed himself in human nature; but he is the same person still. The per∣son who made the world; who sup∣ports all things by the word of his power; whose sovereign will is the supreme law of the universe,—this is the PERSON who was made under the law—a law adapted to <HI>creatures—meer</HI> creatures—creatures naturally below Angels, and made far lower still by sin!—This is the PERSON who <HI>obeyed</HI> this law—who obeyed it as dictating the terms and condition of acquiring happiness! And shall we say, If He had not submitted to this as our substi∣tute, He must have done so as his own personal qualification? Far be it!—Had man continued in his original purity, and had our Creator been plea∣sed to appear in our nature, his holi∣ness would, no doubt, incline him to love his imperfect image in sinless
<PB N="109" REF="128"/>
man: But this love would not be <HI>obe∣dience</HI> to the moral law: His appearing in human nature would not bring him so upon a level with his creatures, that we might consider God and man as <HI>neighbours</HI> bound by the same precept, and upon the same condition, to mu∣tual love. Therefore, when Imma∣nuel was made under the law, it must be that he might obey it as our sub∣stitute.</P>
<P>This argument acquires additional weight when we consider our divine Surety as made under the law after the entrance of sin. We have observed that the holiness of Immanuel would incline him to love his own image in <HI>sinless</HI> man; but it would be perfectly consistent with his holiness to detest the whole human race after they be∣came sinners; and therefore, to love sinful man in conformity to the moral

law, could never be essential to the holiness of our incarnate God. To what end then was he made under it? Why must he fulfil every jot and tittle of this law? Why must he do this in such a low, obscure, laborious, and sorrowful state? Why must he spend thirty years of his life in doing little else? Why must he do this in the form of a servant working for a reward? Why!—Because he was made under the law to redeem them that were under it.</P>
<P>Altho' the objector cannot prove his point without refuting the forego∣ing argument, yet I am at liberty to say, that this argument is not essen∣tial to the doctrine I contend for; I mean, it is not so essential as that the truth of the doctrine depends upon it.—If it were not blafphemy I might grant, for sake of argument, that the
<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
incarnate God could not be holy if he had not been made under the moral law—if he had not obeyed that law in the manner in which we have seen he did obey it; yet it would not fol∣low from hence that he did not obey this law for us; that is, as our Surety, and in our stead; for, since this law could have had no claim upon him if he had not been made man,—since he was made man upon our account,—and since his obedience is of infinitely greater merit than that of all the elect put together; therefore no good rea∣son can be given why he might not obey this law for himself (if such a thing could be necessary) and for us also. This <HI>alone</HI> is a sufficient answer to the objection: Yet we must remind the reader of what was said before, and that we by no means give up the former argument; for although holi∣ness
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
was essential to our Redeemer's Sacrifice, the obedience he yielded to the law was not essential to his own personal holiness: he would have been perfectly holy if he had never been made under the law, or bound to obey its precepts in the manner in which he did obey them.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>IF Christ had obeyed the law as our Surety, and that all through the previous course of his life, it would have superceded the necessity of his expiatory sufferings and death; for the law has not a double demand, but an alternative, requiring either perfect obedience, or the suffering of its penalty.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P>This objection is made up of truth and error connected together by false reasoning. It is <HI>not</HI> true that our Suretie's obedience to the law could supercede the necessity of his suffer∣ings and death; because the wages of sin is death.—It <HI>is</HI> true that there are some cases in which the law has not a double demand, but an alternative; but these cases are so essentially differ∣ent from the case of Christ and his people, that it must be false reasoning
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
which concludes that no more can be demanded in one case than in the other. But we shall be more particular:</P>
<P N="1">1. If a man could be found who had continued in all things that are writ∣ten in the book of the law to do them, certainly he would not deserve to suf∣fer the penalty, because, in this case, no sin has been committed. But it is equally certain that those for whom Christ obeyed the law, have sinned; and this makes the difference.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a sinner has finished his course of tryal, and filled up the mea∣sure of his iniquity, then the divine law consigns him over to hopeless mi∣sery. The "Alternative" does not run thus, <HI>Either obey the commandments or suf∣fer the penalty, and thou shalt obtain the reward;</HI> but rather thus, <HI>Obey, or thou hast forfeited for ever the promised reward, and also subjected thyself to endless misery.</HI>—
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
If obedience to the divine precepts, as a condition of life, as well as suffer∣ing the curse of a broken law, are not both required of the damned; it is because their case is hopeless—they are utterly rejected, and shut up in eternal despair.</P>
<P>Now I know of no other case but these two, wherein the law does not make a double demand; and these are, each of them, essentially differ∣ent from the case of Christ and his people. In the first of the two cases mentioned, the law does not demand the personally righteous to suffer its penalty, because they have not sinned: In the second case, the law does not re∣quire the damned to obey its precepts as a condition of life; because the prospect of a reward is totally cut off from them: But the case of Christ and his people stands thus;—They have
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
sinned, yet they do not suffer the penalty: They have not perfectly obeyed the commandments, yet they obtain the reward due to perfect obe∣dience. This difference is of such a nature as to demonstrate the fallacy of the reasoning in the objection. To see the truth of this, let us take (1) the case wherein the law does not de∣mand the suffering of its penalty; and (2) that wherein it does not demand obedience to its precepts as a condition of happiness; and let us reason from each of these cases to that of Christ and his people. In the first instance the argument will stand thus:</P>
<P><HI>The law does not require those to suffer its penalty, who have obeyed its precepts and</HI> NEVER SINNED; <HI>therefore it cannot re∣quire our Surety to obey its precepts and suffer its penalty, altho' we</HI> HAVE SINNED!—In the second instance the argument
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
runs thus: <HI>The law does not require the damned, upon whom the penalty is inflict∣ed, to obey its precepts as a condition of life, because</HI> NO REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN OR HELD OUT TO THEM; <HI>there∣fore the law cannot require our Surety to suffer its penalty and obey its precepts, al∣though</HI> THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN TO US!—A man who can∣not see into the fallacy of this reason∣ing, I can only say of him, that his case is lamentable. Others, it is hoped, will see, that, since the de∣merit of the damned, and the reward of the righteous, are both found in the case of a Christian, therefore the work of his Surety must comprehend what answers to each; that is, the <HI>penalty</HI> and the <HI>righteousness</HI> of the law. If not, it is evident that the eternal law must be made void in one respect or other. If our Surety had not suffered
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>
for our sins; and if, nevertheless we were to escape the wrath to come; it could no longer be said, <Q REND="inline">"The wages of sin is death."</Q> And if the command∣ments of the law are not obeyed for us, and that perfectly, and yet if we obtain the reward of perfect obedi∣ence; where shall we find the obedi∣ence to which this reward is promis∣ed? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I speak to men who are not vain enough to say, that they themselves have yielded this perfect obe∣dience.</NOTE> If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

<P><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P>Because it was chiefly in suffering the penalty of the law that he obeyed its precepts.—While he was growing up as a root out of a dry ground—a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief:—while he suffered poverty, that we might be made rich:—while he suffered shame and reproach, that we might escape both:—while he was in agony, that we might rejoice:—while he was stripped and scourged, that we might be healed:—while he

<P>ACTS OF THE APOSTLES: In this book we have the substance of what the Apostles preached unto sinners, and by which they were to be saved. In <HI>six</HI> of their sermons, or discourses, we find them careful to lay before their hearers, not only the sufferings, but also the righteousness of Christ. In these discourses he is three times emphatically called, THE HOLY ONE OF GOD:<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts. ii. 27. Chap. iii. 12-14. and xiii. 35.</BIBL></NOTE> and as often, THE JUST ONE.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts- . 14. Chap. vii. 52. and xxii. 14.</BIBL></NOTE> Peter gives a short, but comprehensive and beautiful de∣scription of his character when he

says, <HI>He went about doing good:</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts 10, 38.</BIBL></NOTE> and also when he calls him, <HI>A man approved of God.</HI><NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts 2. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>—If it should be objected, that although these teachers represent Christ as an Holy, Just, or Righteous person, yet they do not, in these dis∣courses, expressly affirm that he wrought his righteousness in the capa∣city of our head, representative, or Surety; I reply, neither do they, in these discourses, expressly affirm that he <HI>suffered</HI> in this capacity. One answer will equally suit his righteousness and sufferings. The truth is, there was no necessity for the Apostles to affirm, in these discourses, more expressly than they have done, that Christ obey∣ed or suffered <HI>for</HI> sinners: because, when they preached the righteousness and sufferings of Christ as the ground of hope; telling the people that,
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
<HI>Through his name,</HI> whosoever believed in him, should receive the remission of sins;<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts 10. 43.</BIBL></NOTE> and that, <HI>By him</HI> all that be∣lieve are justified from all things;<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts 13. 39.</BIBL></NOTE>—when the people heard this, I say, as many of them as understood it, would easily see that Christ must have stood in the capacity of our Surety; for it is this that lays a foundation for our being justified through him.</P>
<P>ROMANS. The doctrine of Imputed Righteousness appears, in this Epistle, not only to be a doctrine of Christi∣anity, but also to be one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of that religion. For the sake of in∣troducing this doctrine, the Apostle sets himself to prove that the whole world is become guilty before God;<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. Read from chap. 1. 19. to chap. 3. 19.</BIBL></NOTE> and he makes the forgiveness of sin,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 4. 6, 7.</BIBL></NOTE>

<P>The Righteousness which is impu∣ted to the believer, is worthy of being made <HI>so much</HI> account of.

Although the scriptures in general, and the Epistle before us in particular, are so very full and plain upon this, yet some men will remind us, in a way of <HI>opposition,</HI> that FAITH <HI>is imputed for righteousness.</HI> But the Apostle must be understood in a way consistent with himself.—It is a common thing with all writers, to use one and the same word to express an <HI>Object,</HI> and the <HI>faculty</HI> or affection which regards that object. Hence the words—<HI>fear, hope, joy, peace, love,</HI> &amp;c. are used indifferently to express the objects of these affec∣tions, and these affections themselves. God is called the <HI>fear</HI> of his people,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 31. 42.</BIBL> <BIBL>Isa. 8. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>because they sear him: Christ is our <HI>hope,</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Tim. 1. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> because we hope for happiness through him: He is our <HI>peace,</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eph. 2. 14.</BIBL></NOTE> because we enjoy peace with God through him: &amp;c.

used indifferently to express the <HI>Truth</HI> which we believe, and our <HI>belief</HI> of the truth.

<P><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P>Some things in this objection have been already considered, viz. what is said about Immanuel <HI>qualifying</HI> him∣self in holiness by his obedience to the moral law; and also what is said of his obedience to the law as an <HI>ex∣ample.</HI> I mention these particulars now, only to make other parts of the
<PB N="141" REF="160"/>
objection more plain to the Reader; for I find that many persons who read the book referred to above, do not understand the Author, upon the sub∣ject in hand. The <HI>Argument</HI> contain∣ed in the objection, shall be consider∣ed presently; but I shall first make a few observations upon the <HI>sentiment</HI> which that argument is intended to support.</P>
<P N="1">1. This sentiment, understood in the most favourable light, will stand thus:—Christ did not begin to act as the Surety or Substitute of his people, until about the time of his <HI>death:</HI> his foregoing obedience and sufferings were not substitutional, but intended for our example, and for his own per∣sonal qualification: but in his death he suffered the penalty, and also obeyed the commandments of the moral law, as his people's substitute and in their
<PB N="142" REF="161"/>
stead. And if we ask, How could he obey the commandments of the moral law in his <HI>death?</HI> the answer is,—In his death he manifested the perfection of love to God and man, which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law.</P>
<P N="2">2. This appears to me to be a very dangerous sentiment. It seems to ap∣proach so near the Truth, and it is supported (in some instances) by such plausible reasoning, and by so able an Advocate, that those who are weak in the Faith are in danger of being carried away by it.—But the Good Shepherd has said,—My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eter∣nal life; and they shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. This sentiment is, I suppose,
<PB N="143" REF="162"/>
perfectly <HI>new.</HI> It is no new thing, indeed, to deny that Christ fulfilled the commandments of the moral law in his people's stead; but it is of <HI>late</HI> that we have been told he did this in his death only, and not in his life. I cannot speak with absolute certain∣ty upon the <HI>novelty</HI> of this sentiment; but am of opinion that it was not thought of until the close of the eigh∣teenth Century. It has not, however, come too late to find footing in the world; for it seems to be adopted by several congregations in north and south Britain, and perhaps it may give birth to another denomination of Christians.</P>
<P N="4">4. At times I fancy I understand this sentiment pretty clearly; but at other times I find myself rather at a loss. This uncertainty is owing to the prin∣ciples upon which this sentiment is
<PB N="144" REF="163"/>
sometimes desended, and from which it's Advocates reason in order to op∣pose what they call the common popu∣lar doctrine: for, these principles seem to me as inconsistent with their own doctrine, as with that which they re∣ject. For instance,</P>
<P N="1">1. Christ's obedience to the law is set before us as an <HI>example</HI> for us to copy after, which shews <HI>(they</HI> say) that he did not obey this law as our substi∣tute, in his <HI>life.</HI>—Now these same people know that Christ's obedience in his <HI>death</HI> is also set before us as an ex∣ample to copy after; how then can <HI>they</HI> believe that he obeyed this law even in his death <HI>as our substitute?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They tell us that if Christ had obeyed the law for us in his life, it would have superseded his expiatory sufferings. Strange!—But, waving all other remarks, what is the reason that
<PB N="145" REF="164"/>
Christ's vicarious obedience to the law in his life, should supersede his expia∣tory sufferings; and yet his vicarious obedience to the law in his death, should <HI>not</HI> supersede them?—To this it has been replied,—<Q REND="inline">"His fulfilling the law for us in his death, includes his expiatory sufferings, and therefore cannot supersede them."</Q> But this answer leaves me just where I was. To tell me that, <HI>The suffering of the penalty is included in Christ's vicarious obe∣dience to the precepts of the law,</HI> is not to shew me <HI>the use and necessity of this;</HI> which is the thing I am inquiring after. It is the opinion of the Objector, that if Christ had obeyed the precepts of the law in his life as our substitute, then his sufferings, considered as ex∣piatory, would be superfluous. See∣ing this is his opinion, and seeing he professes to believe that Christ did
<PB N="146" REF="165"/>
obey these precepts <HI>for us</HI> (that is, as our substitute) in his death, I am at a loss to conceive what necessity <HI>he</HI> finds for the sufferings of Christ, <HI>con∣sidered as expiatory.</HI> To tell me that his obedience to the law in his death, includes his expiatory sufferings; is only to provoke a repetition of the question—Why?—why must this sub∣stitutional obedience include expiatory sufferings? Or, seeing this obedience does in fact include these sufferings, how is it that the former does not ren∣der the latter superfluous?</P>
<P N="3">3. When we plead for our Suretie's vicarious obedience and sufferings all through his life even unto death; the Objector tells us, that it is impossible to shew where the law makes this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>double demand.</HI>"</Q> He insists upon it that the law has not a double demand, but an alternative, requiring either
<PB N="147" REF="166"/>
perfect obedience, or else the suffering of its penalty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have considered this sentiment before, and mention it in this place only to point out the Objec∣tor s inconsistency.</NOTE>—This way of talking makes it very difficult to understand what these people intend to admit. One would think that what is here said, makes as much against their own sentiment, as it does against ours; and when they are reminded of this, their explanation only tends to involve their sentiment in complicated obscurity. When we tell them that their own sentiment, also, infers a double de∣mand of the law upon the sinner's Surety, they seem inclined to admit that it does so; but not <HI>such</HI> a double demand as we plead for: and they say that the double demand which they admit, may be reduced to a <HI>sin∣gle</HI> one. Upon this I would observe.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) If they realy intend to admit
<PB N="148" REF="167" MS="y"/>
that Christ did, at any time, living or dying, not only bear the curse, but also sulfil the precepts of the law <HI>as our substitute;</HI> this is the double de∣mand we plead for. The difference between the life and death of Christ, affects not the question concerning a <HI>double</HI> demand of the law; for it is not length of time, but the two things demanded which constitute the <HI>double</HI> demand. If our Surety had <HI>only</HI> to obey the precepts, or if he had <HI>only</HI> to suffer the penalty of the law, this would be but a <HI>single</HI> demand, al∣though he had been bound thus to obey, or else to suffer, all through life even unto death; and upon the other hand, if he was bound to obey, and also to suffer for us, this is a <HI>double</HI> demand, although he had thus obeyed and suffered only in the hour of death.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) When they talk of reducing
<PB N="149" REF="168"/>
what they seem to admit, to a <HI>single</HI> demand, I am altogether at a loss to know their method of doing so. If I were acquainted with their method of reducing, I could try it upon my own view of this doctrine; but as I do not, my sentiment must needs re∣main as it is. What their's will look like after it is reduced, I cannot tell; but it seems that,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) To be consistent with them∣selves, they must not only reduce a double demand to a single one, but that single one must be an <HI>alternative,</HI> in contradistinction to a double de∣mand; that is, Obedience to the pre∣cepts of the law, including the suffer∣ing of it's penalty, must be reduced to either one or the other of these two: for, they say, The law has not a dou∣ble demand, but an <HI>alternative,</HI> requir∣ing <HI>either perfect obedience, or else</HI> the <HI>suf∣fering of it's penalty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="169"/>
But whatever obscurity may attend this sentiment in other respects, one thing is plain, viz. It stands opposed to the belief of our Suretie's having acted in our name all through his state of humiliation,—from the time he was made under the law to redeem, until he said,—<HI>It is Finished.</HI> I am not sure, indeed, from whence <HI>they</HI> date the commencement of his substitutional work,—<HI>when</HI> he finished the righteous∣ness which (according to them) is ap∣propriated to his own personal quali∣fication, and <HI>when</HI> he began the other righteousness unto which our justifica∣tion is directly ascribed: but their argu∣ment seems to confine the latter to his death; meaning thereby. I suppose, the whole of his voluntary sufferings, from the time he was nailed to the cross, until his resurrection. Taking the sentiment in this view, we are
<PB N="151" REF="170"/>
now to consider the main argument upon which it rests, It is said,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The scriptures do not ascribe our justification directly to what Christ did through the whole course of his life, but always to what he did in his death."</Q> To this we reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. The inspired writers do indeed, and that very frequently, ascribe our justification and salvation to what Christ did in his death; and, consi∣dering his death as the <HI>completion</HI> of his substitutional undertaking, it would be strange if they did not ascribe our justification to it. But when the in∣spired writers ascribe our justification to the death of Christ, how does it appear that they intend to <HI>exclude,</HI> as <HI>substitutional,</HI> his foregoing obedience and sufferings?</P>
<P>To ascribe salvation in all it's parts to the death of Christ, and to believe,
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
at the same time, that Christ acted as our Surety all through his state of hu∣miliation, are not such inconsistent things as to render it impossible for an accurate speaker or writer to do both. Indeed I do not know an au∣thor of any note, who held the doctrine I contend for, but what does, nevertheless, ascribe our salvation to what Christ did in his <HI>death.</HI> I shall give a few instances out of many:<LIST>
<ITEM>OWEN: Mercy, Pardon and Grace, could find no other way to issue forth from the heart of the Father, but by the heart's <HI>blood</HI> of the Son.</ITEM>
<ITEM>WITSIUS: A right to all the bles∣sings of the covenant of grace was purchased <HI>at once</HI> to all the elect by Christ's <HI>death.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>MC. LAURIN: We must believe that Salvation is the purchase of Christs <HI>death.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>HERVEY: The <HI>death</HI> of Christ pro∣cured
<PB N="153" REF="172"/>
the pardon and acceptance of believers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SANDEMAN: Ask a Christian, What is his faith, the spring of all his hope? He answers you in a word, The <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>BOOTH: O remember! that grace has erected her throne. This forbids despair. For her wonderful throne is erected, not in the ruins of justice, not on the dishonour of the law; but, on the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lamb.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now it is well known that these Authors had no intention to <HI>confine</HI> the Suretiship of Christ to his death It is well known that they considered Christ as the substitute of sinners all through his state of humiliation; yet they ascribe salvation in all it's parts to his <HI>death,</HI> in language-<HI>as strong</HI> as that used by the Apostles.—The intelligent reader will readily perceive how far I intend this argument should go. I have no thoughts of supporting any
<PB N="154" REF="173"/>
doctrine by human authority; and therefore I do not quote these Authors to that end. It is suffici∣ent if they are allowed to be men who knew how to express their own thoughts with propriety of speech, and that they have actually done so upon this occasion. And why should not this be admitted? They considered the <HI>death</HI> of Christ as the <HI>completion</HI> of his vicarious work, and in this view they ascribe salvation to it. Is this to express their own thoughts improperly? I suppose no one will say so. What does this prove? It proves that to ascribe salvation to the death of Christ, does not amount to a denial of his having acted as our substitute all through his state of hu∣miliation; and consequently, when the Apostles ascribed salvation to his death, it does not prove that they in∣tended
<PB N="155" REF="174"/>
to exclude, as substitutional, his foregoing obedience and sufferings.—I may here remind our opposers of what certain of their <HI>own</HI> poets have said, and which they themselves re∣peatedly sing, viz.<Q><L>" Tis <HI>finished</HI>—THIS <HI>his dying groan</HI></L>
<L>" Shall sins of every kind atone:</L>
<L>" Millions shall be redeem'd from death</L>
<L>" By THIS <HI>his</HI> LAST <HI>expiring breath.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>The reasoner who should attempt to prove from this verse, that the poet who made, or that the persons who sing it, consider nothing in the suf∣ferings of Christ, as substitutional, but his dying groan, and last expiring breath, would serve the poet, and those who adopt his words, as some men do the apostles.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is past dispute that the scrip∣tures do, in other cases,—cases too
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
which are closely connected with that in hand, ascribe effects to the <HI>death</HI> of Christ, which belong also to the whole of his humiliation, obedience, and sufferings. For instance: Christ is represented as saying, <Q REND="inline">"Therefore doth my Father love me, <HI>because I lay down my life.</HI>"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 10. 17.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> Does this warrant us to say, that laying down his life was the <HI>only</HI> thing for which his Father loved him? No verily; not even though we should soften the matter by adding the words, <Q REND="inline">"immediately and directly."</Q> For, all that Christ did upon the earth, were immediate and direct causes of the Father's love.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 2. 40, 52. Chap. 3. 22.</BIBL> <BIBL>John 4. 34. Chap. 8. 29. and 15. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>—Again: Paul says, <Q REND="inline">"Jesus was crowned with glory and honour, <HI>for the suffering of death.</HI>"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 2. 9.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> Does this warrant us to say, that his death
<PB N="157" REF="176"/>
was the <HI>only</HI> direct cause for which he was crowned? Was he not highly exalted for the <HI>whole</HI> of his humiliati∣on, obedience, and sufferings?<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. 2. 6-9.</BIBL></NOTE>—for loving righteousness, and hating ini∣quity?<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 1. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>—for <HI>all</HI> that he did to glorify his Father upon the earth?<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>John 17. 4.</BIBL></NOTE>Certainly he was: yet the scriptures ascribe it to his <HI>death.</HI> Therefore, when the scriptures ascribe <HI>salvation</HI> to the death of Christ, why should we not understand them as including his fore∣going obedience and sufferings? To understand the scriptures thus, is only to take them for their own interpreter, and to explain what they say of the death of Christ, in one place, by what we are sure they intend, in another.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the scriptures ascribe sal∣vation to the <HI>death</HI> of Christ, it can∣not
<PB N="158" REF="177"/>
be with a view to exclude, as substitutional, his foregoing obedience and sufferings, because it is impossible to find an adequate cause or end for this obedience, or for these sufferings, (especially some of them) without admitting that they were substitu∣tional. For instance: What adequate cause or end shall we find for his dreadful sufferings in the garden, and from thence to Calvary, if we deny that they were substitutional? Was it merely for the sake of setting us an example, and qualifying himself in holiness, that he began to be sore amazed, and very heavy? that his soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death? that he was in an agony, and sweat great drops of blood falling to the ground? that he was taken from hence, bound, smitten, spit up∣on, blindsolded, mocked; stripped
<PB N="159" REF="178"/>
and scourged?—If the Objector should admit that these instances of suffering were substitutional, he must then abandon his argument, and be reduced to the necessity of begging the question: for these sufferings were no more undergone <HI>on the tree,</HI> than were any other sufferings of our Redeemer's life. And it must be noticed, that the Apostles not only ascribe our salvation to his last suffer∣ings and <HI>death,</HI> but also expressly to what he endured while hanging on the Tree.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gal. 3. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>—But if the Objector should go so far as to deny that the sufferings of Christ in the garden, and from thence until he was led forth to be crucified, were substitutional, he ought to provide a good reason for so doing; which, I am persuaded, is absolutely impossible. I conclude, therefore, that
<PB N="160" REF="179"/>
when the scriptures ascribe our justi∣fication to the <HI>death</HI> of Christ, it is not with any intention to exclude, as substitutional, his foregoing obedience and sufferings.</P>
<P>But the Objector has not only said that the scriptures always ascribe our justification to the <HI>death</HI> of Christ, but also that they never ascribe it, directly, to his foregoing obedience and suffer∣ings. We have therefore now to consider what authority he has for this part of his argument. In doing this, I shall (1) lay before the reader some passages of scripture which ap∣pear to ascribe our salvation to the <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ <HI>in general;</HI> and (2) make some further observations upon the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our divine Surety.</P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> I shall lay before the reader some passages of scripture which ap∣pear
<PB N="161" REF="180"/>
to ascribe our justification and salvation to the <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ <HI>in general.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poverty, Persecutions</HI> and <HI>Temptations,</HI> are remarkable instances of the suffer∣ings of Christ, and the scriptures as∣cribe our salvation to each of them.</P>
<P><HI>Poverty.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich,"<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>2 Cor. 8. 9.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> Now Christ <HI>became</HI> poor, when he was born of a woman, brought forth in a stable, and laid in a manger; he <HI>continued</HI> poor all through his life upon this earth; and at length died in the most dreadful kind of poverty. When any period of this state of poverty is contrasted with his
<PB N="162" REF="181"/>
original state, and with what he had a right to enjoy, as the Son of the Highest, from the first moment of his birth, it ought not to be esteemed a small matter. We should also re∣member that a state of life, such as our divine Surety led in this world, was part of the original curse pro∣nounced upon sinful man.—<Q REND="inline">"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in <HI>sorrow</HI> shalt thou eat of it ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE. Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou re∣turn."<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gen. 3. 17, 18, 19.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>
<P><HI>Persecution.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Let not them that
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed, <HI>for my sake:</HI> let not those that seek thee be confounded, <HI>for my sake,</HI> O God of Israel: BECAUSE for thy sake I have born reproach: shame hath covered my face.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Psalm. 69. 6, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</BIBL></NOTE></Q>—Upon this text we have to observe, (1) Christ is the speaker. (2) He is praying for his people, who deserve eternal shame and confusion of face, because they have sinned against God. (3) The reason why this shame and confusion is not to come upon his people, to whom it belonged, is, because their Surety bore reproach, shame covered his face. Now although this took place in its most eminent degree upon the Cross, it is plain from the context that Christ is here speaking of <HI>all</HI> that shame and reproach which he endured upon the earth.—It is past dispute
<PB N="164" REF="183"/>
with those who admit the authority of the New Testament, that the suffer∣ings mentioned in this Psalm, upon the ground of which our Advocate intercedes, are the sufferings of Christ <HI>in general.</HI> Compare verse 4. with John 15. 25. And verse 9. with John 2. 17.</P>
<P><HI>Temptations.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"In all things it be∣hoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful High Priest, in things pertaining to God, <HI>to make reconciliation for the sins</HI> of the people: <HI>for in that he himself hath</HI> SUFFERED, <HI>being</HI> TEMPTED; he is able to succour them that are tempted."<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 2. 17, 18.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> It is readily granted that the <HI>succour</HI> here mentioned, includes that conti∣nual support, relief and protection, which the tempted christian receives
<PB N="165" REF="184"/>
from Christ, who learned, by painful experience, how to feel for his people: but it is plain that this is not the only, nor yet the chief thing which the Apostle teaches. The particulars which relate to the case in hand, are (1) Paul ranks the temptations which Christ endured, amongst his <HI>sufferings:</HI> (2) These sufferings are amongst the <HI>all things</HI> in which it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren; to the end he might <HI>make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</HI>—Now Christ was tempted, not only in his death, but in all points like as we are.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 4. 15.</BIBL></NOTE> By what authority, then, do we exclude from his atonement, all those temptations which he endured before his death; and particularly those of which we read when he was led into the wilder∣ness, away from the habitations of
<PB N="166" REF="185"/>
men, <HI>to be tempted</HI> of the chief of the infernal spirits? In this horrid situation he continued during forty days and nights, without food.—How different this from the delightful abode of sin∣less Adam! How different from the proper habitation of Adam's Lord! This, indeed, is a fit situation for guilt and despair; but how came the Holy One of God in such a place!—in such company!</P>

sufferings, viz. <HI>the days of his flesh.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 5. 7.</BIBL></NOTE> Now, the DAYS <HI>of his flesh,</HI> are more than the HOURS of his crucifixion:—the days of his flesh, are the days of his humiliation, wherein he appear∣ed in the form of sinful flesh;<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 8. 3.</BIBL></NOTE> a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</P>
<P N="3">3. The sufferings of which the Apostle speaks in this place, and which he represents as belonging to Christ's priestly office, are of such a nature that, we have reason to believe, he certainly did endure them, all through the days of his flesh—He of∣fered up prayers and supplications with <HI>crying</HI>—with <HI>strong</HI> crying,—with strong crying and <HI>tears.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 5. 7.</BIBL></NOTE> Now com∣pare this with the history of Christ's life, given by the Evangelists. There we read of his sending the multitude away, dismissing his disciples also,
<PB N="172" REF="191"/>
and then retiring, not to repose after the labours of the day, but to a desert mountain to pray, and continuing there until about the fourth watch of the night.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 14. 23, 25.</BIBL></NOTE>—At another time we read of his rising up in the morning, a great while before day, and departing into a solitary place to pray.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mark 1. 35.</BIBL></NOTE> And again we are told of his going out into a mountain to pray, and continuing <HI>all night</HI> in prayer to God.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 6. 12.</BIBL></NOTE> Now, from these instances, we should conclude that it was common for him thus to spend his nights. Indeed the Evan∣gelist in one place, telling us of his retiring at night to the mount of Olives, says expressly, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>As he was wont.</HI>"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke 22. 39.</BIBL></NOTE></Q>—The last night which the Saviour of sinners spent in prayer to God, he permitted three of his disciples to be with him; and we know the awful
<PB N="173" REF="192"/>
account they give of what they saw and heard:—this was in the garden of Gethsemane. I do not positively affirm that all his nightly prayers were attended with <HI>equal</HI> sorrows; but this I know, that the Apostle speaks in a <HI>general</HI> way, when he tells us of the state of mind in which our High Priest offered up his prayers and supplications. When he tells us they were offered up with <HI>strong crying and tears,</HI> he does not appear to be speak∣ing of what was done on some one particular occasion; but he seems to be speaking, in general, of what he did <HI>in the days of his flesh.</HI> Moreover, these prayers and supplications which our High Priest offered up, with strong crying and tears, were a sub∣ject of <HI>Prophecy;</HI> and they are spoken of as being offered up, <HI>day and night, incessantly.</HI> Thus the Redeemer weeps:
<PB N="174" REF="193" MS="y"/>
<Q REND="inline">"O my God, I cry unto thee in the <HI>day time,</HI> but thou <HI>hearest not;</HI> and in the <HI>night-season,</HI> and <HI>am not silent.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Psalm. 22. 2.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> Up∣on these memorable words, I would make the following remarks: (1) We are sure that Jesus is the speaker. (2) This bitter complaint cannot re∣fer meerly to the scene in Gethse∣mane, because that scene took place at <HI>night;</HI> and the complaint is, <Q REND="inline">"O my God, I cry in the <HI>day-time.</HI>"</Q> Nei∣ther can it refer <HI>only</HI> to what Jesus suf∣fered on the Cross, because he was taken down from the Cross <HI>before sun∣set;</HI> and the complaint is, <Q REND="inline">"I cry in the day-time, and in the <HI>night-season.</HI>"</Q> (4) This complaint cannot well be <HI>confined</HI> to any one particular day and night, because the words are more properly expressive of daily, continu∣ed sorrow:—<Q REND="inline"><HI>O my God, I cry unto thee</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="194"/>
<HI>in the day time, but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent.</HI>"</Q> This way of speaking calls to our mind what the Evangelists tell us of his continuing whole nights in prayer, on mountains and in solitary places; and of this being his usual custom. (5) It appears from this <HI>second</HI> verse of the twenty-second Psalm, that our Re∣deemer had occasion, more than once, to use the words of the <HI>first</HI> verse, viz. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, &amp;c. We have just now mentioned some considerations which go to prove that the complaint uttered in the <HI>second</HI> verse, cannot be <HI>confined</HI> to the awful scene in Gethsemane; nor yet to that on the Cross; and if the <HI>second</HI> verse cannot be thus confined, no more can the <HI>first,</HI> as may appear from hence: The two verses seem to be closely connected together, and to
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
form <HI>one</HI> complaint:—<Q REND="inline">"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent."</Q>—Does not the suffering Redeemer connect, in this instance, his <HI>unheard cries,</HI> with his being <HI>forsaken of God?</HI> And when he himself complains of crying thus unto God, <HI>day and night, continually;</HI> shall <HI>we</HI> say, He never had occasion thus to complain, except during the six hours in which he hung upon the Cross? Let it be far from christians to contradict their Lord in any thing; and especially when his sufferings are in question. When he intimates, in any particular instance, that he suffered for our sins; the least we can do is to acknowledge that he did so.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="177" REF="196"/>
4. And being made perfect, (con∣tinues the Apostle) he became the Author of eternal salvation.—<HI>And be∣ing made perfect:</HI> this is just the form of expression which we might have ex∣pected, if, as we maintain, the Apos∣tle had been speaking of our Great High Priest, as gradually advancing, all through the days of his flesh, in the great work of Atonement. Consider∣ing all the sufferings of his life in this light, it was natural to add,—<HI>and be∣ing made perfect.</HI>—Our Great High Priest was made perfect by his last sufferings on the Cross, where, accord∣ing to his own words, he <HI>Finished</HI> his work. Being thus made perfect, he became the Author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him. By this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. There is no need of repeating this sacrifice,
<PB N="178" REF="197"/>
like those which were offered under the law: (for then must he often have suffered <HI>since the foundation of the world;)</HI> but now once, in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear, the second time, without sin, unto salvation.—I shall conclude what I have to say upon the <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ, in the words of WITSIUS: not with any view to strengthen the argument by the authority of his Name; but because he expresses my own views more clearly, perhaps, than I could have done myself.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I remember to have learned," says he, "in the communion of the re∣formed church, to the following effect:
<PB N="179" REF="198"/>
1st. That the death, wherewith God threatned man for sin, comprizes in its whole extent all that misery, which, by the justest despleasure of God, has followed upon sin, and to which the sinner man is obnoxious all his life, the principal part of which consists in the want of the favour of God, and in the keenest sense of the divine curse, to be chiefly inflicted, when it shall so please God. 2dly, That Christ, by the interposition of his engagements for the elect, took upon himself all that curse, which man was liable to, on account of sin; hence it was, that, in order to the payment of the debt he engaged for, he led a life, in the as∣sumed human nature, subject to many vicissitudes of misery, just like the life of a human sinner. 3dly, That, as God uses much forbearance with res∣pect to sinners, and moderates the
<PB N="180" REF="199"/>
bitterness of life with some sweetness of patience, till the day of vengeance, and of the retribution of his righteous judgment, when the whole weight of the curse shall light upon the con∣demned sinner; so also Christ, when in the form of sinful flesh, had not al∣ways the same sense of the painful ef∣fects of the sins that were laid upon him, but sometimes rejoiced in an eminent mixture of favour; till the hour and power of darkness came, when, being called to the bar, he had every thing dreadful to undergo. 4thly, That as the death, which con∣sists in the separation of the soul and body, is inflicted on the sinner man, as the fad effect of the wrath of God; so in like manner Christ underwent the same death, that, in this respect also, making satisfaction to divine justice, he might remove all the curse
<PB N="181" REF="200"/>
of that death from the elect. 5thly, In fine, that as all those miseries, taken together, are what sin deserves; so Christ, who, by his engagement, took upon himself all the debt of the elect, did, by all these miseries, to which he was subject all his life, satisfy divine justice; so that, taken all to∣gether, they constitute the ransom, which was due for our sins.—All the sufferings which Christ endured both in soul and body, through the whole course of his life, constitute his one and perfect satisfaction; though it be certain that those were the most greiv∣ous sufferings with which he encoun∣tred on the last night and day; and that what he bore in his body, were far exceeded by those that oppressed his soul: just as the whole of Christ's most holy obedience is imputed to us for righteousness, tho' he gave an
<PB N="182" REF="201"/>
eminent demonstration of it, when he was obedient in death."</Q>—We come now,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> to make some further ob∣servations upon the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Divine Surety. I do not intend to en∣ter fully into the consideration of this glorious Subject: if I had ability suit∣ed to such a task, my limits would not admit of it. All that I intend is, to propose one argument more, taken from what the Scriptures say of the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ, in reply to the Objection now before us.</P>
<P>The Objector will not admit that Christ obeyed and suffered, all through his life upon earth, as the Surety or Substitute of sinners. He cannot find, he says, that the Scriptures ascribe our justification directly to what Christ did in his life, but always to what he did in his death.—In reply to this we
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
have shewn (1) that when the Scrip∣tures ascribe our justification to the death of Christ, it is not with any in∣tention to exclude, as substitutional, his foregoing obedience and sufferings: (2) That the Scriptures do, in many places, ascribe our justification and sal∣vation to the sufferings of Christ in general; that is, to <HI>all</HI> the sufferings he endured in the days of his humili∣ation. To these considerations we have now to add, (what we have before proved) that our justification is ascribed, and that "<HI>directly,</HI>" to the Righteousness of Christ. This alone, one might imagine, is suffici∣ent to decide this question. But the Objector has found out a new way to evade the force of this argument. Hitherto, the question has been—Is the Righteousness of Christ (includ∣ing his sufferings) the immediate and
<PB N="184" REF="203"/>
direct cause of our justification? This question being decided in the affirma∣tive, the dispute was ended. The reason was, there existed no dispute about what was meant by the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of Christ. It was admitted upon all hands, that the Righteous∣ness of Christ, is his conformity to the Rule of Righteousness; or in other words, the whole of his obedience to the Moral Law. For men had not as yet learned to distinguish between his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his life, and his obedi∣ence to the precepts of the moral law in his death, and to assign different kinds of influence to this obedience in the justification of the ungodly. But by the help of these distinctions, the Objector can admit, in words, that our justification is ascribed directly to the Rightcousness of Christ and yet
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
deny that it is directly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader must impute the frequent repeti∣tion of the word "<HI>directly,</HI>" to the singularity of the sentiment I am opposing.</NOTE> ascribed to the holiness of his heart and life, in conformity to the moral law.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If the Reader doubts whether this be a fair re¦presentation, let him read the Objector's own words, page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of this Essay.</NOTE> So that it is not enough for us to prove that the scriptures ascribe our justifi∣cation directly to the Righteousness of Christ; we must also prove that the Righteousness of Christ is the whole of his conformity to that Rule of Righteousness under which he was made:—which, one would think, is so self evident, that it does not re∣quire, and that it hardly admits of proof. It is almost like attempting to prove, that the Righteousness of Christ is—the Righteousness of Christ. And perhaps some Readers may
<PB N="186" REF="205" MS="y"/>
blame me for saying any more upon a subject which is already so plain. Such as are thus minded, may here close the book. To others, we shall propose the following remarks:—</P>
<P N="1">1. The Righteousness of which we speak, is the Righteousness of CHRIST. It is not the Righteousness of the Eternal WORD, considered <HI>only</HI> as God, and as the Governor of the World; but it is that Righteousness which this Person wrought in our na∣ture, after he was made of a woman, and <HI>while he was under the Law.</HI> It is that Righteousness of his which con∣sists in a <HI>perfect conformity to every jot and title of the Law.</HI> If it be asked,—Is every action of his life from his birth to his death, included in this Righteousness? I answer directly, YES. Upon which I fancy I hear some exclaim,—What! did he con∣form
<PB N="187" REF="206"/>
to the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law as our Substitute? Did he work miracles as our Substitute?—Yes, <HI>in so far as his confor∣mity to the</HI> MORAL <HI>Law was concerned in these things.</HI> When he attended to the ceremonial law, he did so in obedi∣ence to the command of God; which is not a ceremonial, but <HI>moral</HI> duty.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Cor. vii. 19.</BIBL></NOTE> And while he wrought miracles, he was going about doing good;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts x. 38.</BIBL></NOTE> which is also a <HI>moral</HI> duty.—But the moral law never bound <HI>us</HI> to observe the ce∣remonial law: it never bound <HI>us</HI> to work miracles!—True; but it bound us to obey God, and to do good to man; and it is only in this sense that we consider the Righteousness of Christ as concerned in Ceremonies and Mi∣racles.—Indeed these things are very inconsistently objected to us, by the persons we now speak to. <HI>They</HI> also
<PB N="188" REF="207"/>
profess to believe that Christ obeyed the moral law as our substitute. And how do they say he did this?—By dying to redeem lost sinners.—But the moral law never commanded us to perform such a work as this! This was the greatest miracle of all! Yet if any one was to object this to them, they would, and very justly, consider it as an impertinent cavil. At least they would know how to answer it; and one answer will equally suit us both. Neither party need be afraid if the only thing that can be objected to us is, that Christ obeyed the law for us in a different, and far more ex∣cellent manner, than could be ex∣pected from us:—this is our Glory. The Righteousness of our Divine Surety does not exceed that which was demanded of the Elect, more than his <HI>Person</HI> exceeds their persons.
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
But who ever objected to the Sureti∣ship of Christ, meerly upon account of the excellency of his Person? Yea, I have heard one man, and only one, go thus far. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot admit the doctrine of imputed righteousness," he said, "for this reason;—The works of an <HI>Infinite</HI> Person, cannot be im∣puted to one that is finite."</Q>—But this seems to proceed upon a mistaken no∣tion of the nature of that imputation of which we speak. It is indeed im∣possible that any finite person should perform the works which are pecu∣liar to one who is infinite. And as the judgment of God is always ac∣cording to truth, it is equally impossi∣ble that he should <HI>so</HI> impute the Righteousness of Christ unto us, as to judge that this Righteousness is our own <HI>personal</HI> work. This therefore is not what the scriptures teach, neither
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
is it what any christian pleads for.—But it was not impossible for the Eter∣nal Word, who is an infinite Person, to take on him a finite nature; to unite himself to his elect, and be∣come their surety: it was not impossi∣ble for him, in their nature, and as their Surety to obey every jot and tit∣tle of the moral law, and suffer its penalty; nor is it impossible for God to impute this unto the persons for whom it was done; that is, it is not impossible for God to place it to their account, and, upon this ground, to jus∣tify them from all things, from which they could not be justified by their own personal performances. This is not impossible, but divinely true.—The Righteousness of our Incarnate God, is <Q REND="inline">"unto and upon all them that believe;"</Q> but neither he who wrought, nor he who imputes this
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
Righteousneis, nor they unto whom it is imputed, ever mistake it for the workmanship of a finite person. It is <HI>ours</HI> because it was wrought for us, and is imputed unto us; not because it is our own personal performance. There is indeed such a close union between Christ and his elect, that, because he died, rose, and reigns, and because his Righteousness is divine; they also are represented as dead, risen, reigning, and as made the Righteousness of God; but they are all this IN HIM, who is their Head and Representative. To obey and suf∣fer <HI>in the second Adam,</HI> is one thing; and to do so <HI>in our own Persons,</HI> is another.—Considering therefore the nature and grounds of this imputation, the infinity of the Person of our Surety is so far from making the imputation of his Righteousness impossible, that
<PB N="192" REF="211"/>
the reverse is true: for had he been a meer creature, he could have yeild∣ed no obedience to the law of God beyond what was necessary for himself: much less could he make reconcilia∣tion for the innumerable sins of the whole redeemed company, and work a Righteousness which should be ade∣quate to the demands of the law up∣on them all. It was necessary, in∣deed, that he should be <HI>man;</HI> for otherwise he could neither obey the precepts nor suffer the penalty of the law given to man; but it was his DI∣VINITY that gave sufficient worth and efficacy to the whole.—There is, then, a likeness, and there is also a difference, between the <HI>Person</HI> of our Surety, and our persons; and there is also a likeness and a difference be∣tween what the law demanded of us, and what he performed as our Surety.
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
As the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same: as we were under the law, he was made under it: as the law bound us to <HI>continue</HI> in <HI>all</HI> things that are written therein, he came to fulfil <HI>every jot and tittle</HI> of the law, and he <HI>always</HI> did those things that were pleasing in his Father's fight: and as we were exposed to the righteous curse of a broken law, so the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he suffered the just for the unjust. Thus far there is a likeness. But mark the difference: we were mere creatures, He was the Great Creator: the obedience which the law demanded of us, was only the o∣bedience of mere men: but His is the Righteousness of God: because we could never satisfy divine justice for our sins, we were doomed to end∣less
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
misery; but he being fully able to do this, his sufferings had an end.</P>
<P N="2">2. I think it has been proved that Christ <HI>suffered</HI> for the sins of his peo∣ple, not only in his <HI>death,</HI> but also through the whole course of his life; consequently he must have stood as our Surety all that time: and if he did so in suffering the penalty of the law, why not in obeying its precepts?</P>
<P N="3">3. I think we have also proved, that the Incarnate God had no occa∣sion to obey the moral law for him∣self; at least not in the manner in which he did obey it all through his state of humiliation; consequently it was for us he did so, and not for him∣self.</P>
<P N="4">4. Although the love which Christ manifested in his death, is undoubt∣edly included in his Righteousness, and is the most eminent instance of it;
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
yet we cannot think that this was all he intended, when he said he came to fulfil <HI>every jot and tittle</HI> of the law. This expression evidently includes, not only the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>weightier matters of the law,</HI>"</Q> such as perfect love to God and man; but also all <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the least of those commandments,</HI>"</Q> wherein that love should be expressed. And we find that the Righteousness of Christ does in fact answer to the most minute, as well as the most important duties of the law. It is universal, and in every respect perfect. Neither the greatest nor the least precept was neglected by him. He laid down his life for his brethren, in obedience to the high command of his Father, and he was subject to Joseph and Mary,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Luke, 2. 51.</BIBL></NOTE> in con∣formity to the fifth precept of the law. And it should be observed that he did
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
all this <HI>because</HI> it was easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for <HI>one tittle</HI> of the law to fail.</P>
<P N="5">5. Christ's obedience to the law was not only <HI>universal,</HI> but <HI>constant.</HI> Nor was this unnecessary; for although this law could have had no dominion over him, if he had not been made under it to redeem; yet, after he was made under it, he was bound to obey it in all points, and to <HI>continue</HI> his obedience unto the end. There∣fore all that Christ did in obedience to this law, is <HI>essential</HI> to his <HI>Righteous∣ness.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I think it must be granted that the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ, taken in the most proper and complete sense of the word, includes the whole of his obedience, from his infancy to his death; and why should we understand it as intending any thing short of this,
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
when our justification is ascribed di∣rectly to it. But,—</P>
<P N="7">7. We call upon the Objector to produce one single text of scripture, wherein the Righteousness of Christ must necessarily be understood as not including the <HI>whole</HI> of his conformity to the moral law, or eternal rule of Righteousness.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Essay in the words of DR. J. OWEN.</P>
<Q><P>"I cannot but judge it sounds ill in the ears of all Christians," says he, "That the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ as our Mediator and Surety unto the whole Law of God, was for himself, and not for us; or that what he did therein, was not that he might be the end of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth;—especially considering, that the saith of the church is, That
<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
he was given to us, born to us; that for us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and did, and suffered what was required of him."</P>
<P>"It is said, <HI>That this obedience was necessary as a</HI> QUALIFICATION <HI>of his Person, that he might be</HI> MEET <HI>to be a mediator for us; and therefore was for himself.</HI>—But this I positively deny. The Lord Christ was every way <HI>meet</HI> for the whole work of Mediation, by the <HI>ineffable union</HI> of the <HI>Human Nature</HI> with the <HI>Divine,</HI> which exalted it in dignity, honour, and worth, above any thing, or all things that ensued thereon. For hereby he became in his whole Person the Object of Di∣vine Worship and Honour; for <Q REND="inline">"<HI>When he bringeth the First Begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship Him.</HI>"</Q> Again, That which is
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
an <HI>effect</HI> of the Person of the Media∣tor as constituted such, cannot be a <HI>Qualification</HI> necessary unto its constitu∣tion."</P>
<P>"Whereas therefore he was nei∣ther made man, nor of the posterity of Abraham for himself, but for the Church, namely, to become thereby the <HI>Surety of the Covenant,</HI> and <HI>Repre∣sentative</HI> of the whole, his obedience as Man unto the Law in general, and as the Son of Abraham unto the law of Mofes, was for his people, and not for himself; it was so designed, so performed, and without a respect unto the Church, was of no use unto himself. <HI>He was born to us,</HI> and <HI>given to us, lived for us,</HI> and <HI>died for us; obeyed for us,</HI> and <HI>suffered for us,</HI> that <HI>by the obe∣dience of one, many might be made Righte∣ous.</HI> This was the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and this is the Faith of
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
she Church. And what he did <HI>for</HI> us, is <HI>imputed to us.</HI> This is included in the very notion of his <HI>doing it for us,</HI> which cannot be spoken in the true and proper sense, unless what he so did, be <HI>imputed unto us.</HI> And I think men ought to be cautious that they do not, by <HI>distinctions</HI> and studied <HI>evasions</HI> for the defence of their own private opinions, shake the foundations of the Christian Religion. And I am sure it will be easier for them, as it is in the proverb, to wrest the club out of the hand of Hercules, than to dis∣posses the minds of true Believers of this persuasion, viz, That what the Lord Christ did in obedience un∣to God according unto the Law, he designed in his love and grace to do it for them. He needed no obedience for himself, he came not into a capa∣city of yielding obedience, for him∣self,
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
but for us; and therefore for us it was, that He fulfilled the Law in obedience unto God, according unto the terms of it. The obligation that was on him unto obedience, was ori∣ginally no less for us, no less needful unto us, no more for himself, no more necessary unto him, than the obliga∣tion that was on him as the Surety of the Covenant, to suffer the penalty of the Law, was either the one or the other." Which may be illustrated thus: "When the Apostle Paul wrote those words unto Philemon concerning Onesimus (ver. 18.) <HI>If he hath wronged thee,</HI> dealt unrighteously or injuriously with thee, <HI>or oweth thee ought,</HI> wherein thou hast suffered loss by him, put it on my account, or im∣pute it all unto me; I will repay it, or answer for it all: He supposes that Philemon might have a double action
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
against Onesimus, the one of wrong or injury, the other of loss or debt: If he hath <HI>wronged thee, or oweth thee ought.</HI> Hereon he proposeth himself, and obligeth himself by his express obligation, <HI>I Paul have written it with my own hand,</HI> that he would answer for both. Hereby he was obliged in his own person to make satisfaction unto Philemon; but yet he was to do it for Onesimus, and not for him∣self."</P>
<P>"Some of the ancients disputed, That the Son of God should have been incarnate, although man had not sinned and fallen; but none of them once imagined, that he should have been so made man, as to be made un∣der the law, and be obliged thereby unto that obedience which he hath performed: But they judged that im∣mediately he was to have been a Glo∣rious
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
Head unto the whole Creation. For it is a common notion and pre∣sumption of all Christians, (but only such as will sacrifice these notions to their own private conceptions,) That the obedience which Christ yielded unto the law on the earth, in the state and condition wherein he did yield it, was not for himself, but for the Church, which was obliged unto per∣fect obedience, but was not able to ac∣complish it."</P>
