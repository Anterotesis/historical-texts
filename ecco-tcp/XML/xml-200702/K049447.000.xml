<HEAD>Observations on the <HI>Fifth Article of the Treaty of UNION,</HI> humbly offered to the Consideration of the Parliament, relat∣ing to <HI>Foreign Ships.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Matter of Difficulty upon this Head, I take to be as follows. — By the Article, all Ships, any of whose Owners were Foreigners at the Signing of the Treaty, shall be Deem'd still Fo∣reign Bottoms within the Terms of the Act of Na∣vigation.</P>
<P>The Reason of this is plain, Most of the Ship∣ping employ'd on the South-East of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are Fo∣reign Bottoms, and severals of them own'd by Fo∣reigners, principally <HI>Dutch.</HI> Now, as <HI>England</HI> is very careful to Encourage her own Shipping; and as <HI>Britain</HI> will after the Union still be so the Encrease, Employment and Building of Ships be∣ing one of the Principal Foundations of her Wealth. — It would be hard to admit any Ships, which are Foreign built, to be free Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when none that are so in <HI>England</HI> can be admitted.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> freely admits all Ships built in <HI>Scotland</HI> to
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
be free in all the Ports and Trade of <HI>Britain;</HI> — Nay, to go further, <HI>England</HI> allows by the Union, even <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, if bought by <HI>Scots</HI> Men, and belong∣ing to <HI>Scots</HI> Owners, to be free, which is more than any <HI>English-man</HI> can be allow'd. — Nay, If a Fo∣reign built Ship lay now at <HI>Leith</HI> Road, and her Owners were all <HI>English-men,</HI> she would not be Deem'd a free Ship by the Union, but the <HI>English</HI> Owners would loose the benefit of employing her; and the Reason of this is, to Encourage our own Shipping, on which so much depends, and this Bene∣fit will be plainly <HI>Scotland's</HI> at last.</P>
<P>But the Objection here, is, We have a great many Ships in our Trade that are Foreign built, and that are chiefly own'd by <HI>Scots-men,</HI> but perhaps may have one or more Owners abroad; and it would be hard that these <HI>Scots-men</HI> should lose the Benefit of their Ships which they employ in the Trade of their Native Country, only because they have some <HI>Dutch-men</HI> concerned with them, — when at the same time 'tis plain, that if these <HI>Dutch-men</HI> were not concerned, the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> would with great difficulty be carried on.</P>
<P>The Expedient proposed for this, as I meet with it, is, That a reasonable time should be given for the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> to buy out their <HI>Dutch</HI> Owners or sell their own Interest.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>
Or that it should have been said, All Ships &amp;c. whose Owners were <HI>Scots-men,</HI> at the End, or Ratifi∣cation of the Treaty, &amp;c. since till the Treaty is Con∣cluded, every <HI>Scots-man</HI> has a Right to employ any Ship whatever.</P>
<P>To Answer this, I crave leave to say, That this tho plausible in its self, has yet Inconveniencies of a nature Intolerable, because by this, any Man in <HI>England,</HI> as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may in the name of <HI>Scotsmen,</HI> Buy what number of Ships in <HI>Holland</HI> they please, and at the end of the Union, they become free Ships, to the general Ruine of the Shipping in the whole Island.</P>
<P>And this was Remarkably true, to <HI>England</HI>'s pro∣digious Loss, when in the last <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the Ships taken from <HI>Holland</HI> as Prize, were made free, the People bought <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, caused sham Privateers to take them, and for several years, some hundereds of them were Imployed in their Coal Trade, to the Ruine of the Town of <HI>Ipswick,</HI> where all the large Coal Ships used to be Built, — which Loss that Town never recovered.</P>
<P>To give a time therefore, to have all Ships Own'd by <HI>Scotsmen</HI> come in to be free, is to open a Door to a Mischief, which it cannot be desired, <HI>England</HI> should suffer in Trade; and the value now supposed to be Toucht here, is but very small.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
All that I can see in this, is, That a <HI>Medium</HI> be found out, which if it must be, tho I do not grant that necessity neither, <HI>is this,</HI> That <HI>at the time of the Treaty,</HI> the MAJOR PART of such Vessel did belong to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I confess this seems to have some colour of Reason in it, that the Majority should Denominate the whole, and I would hope <HI>England</HI> would not Dispute it, since they do not deny any Foreigners, Holding or Owning any Share of an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, but the Legitimacy of the Vessel consists in her Bottom.</P>
<P>Now if the Majority of Owners as to the Value, I mean, were not <HI>Scots,</HI> no Ship can be accounted Legitimate. If a <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant Owns ⅜ of a Ship, and a <HI>Dutchman</HI> ⅝ she cannot be accounted in Reason, any thing but a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, especially when her Bottom is <HI>Dutch</HI> too, for the Denomination must go with the Major; and it's not the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant is a part Owner of the <HI>Scotsman</HI>'s Ship, but the <HI>Scots∣man</HI> is a part Owner of the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s Ship.</P>
<P>This small <HI>Medium,</HI> I think, will reduce this Ar∣ticle to a Square, and an Explanatorie Clause to that purpose, will in two Lines determine that Point.</P>
<CLOSER>All which is Humbly Remitted to the Considerati∣on of the Right Honourable the Estates of Par∣liament.</CLOSER>
