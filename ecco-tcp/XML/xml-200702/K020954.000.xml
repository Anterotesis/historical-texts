<HEAD>THE CONFERENCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GRACE said in form, which Sceptics must agree,</L>
<L>When they are told that Grace was said by Me;</L>
<L>The Servants gone, to break the scurvy jest</L>
<L>On the proud Landlord, and his thread-bare guest;</L>
<L>The King gone round, my Lady too withdrawn,</L>
<L>My Lord, in usual taste, began to yawn,</L>
<L>And lolling backward in his Elbow-chair,</L>
<L>With an insipid kind of stupid stare,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>Picking his teeth, twirling his seals about —</L>
<L>CHURCHILL, You have a Poem coming out.</L>
<L>You've my best wishes; but I really fear</L>
<L>Your Muse in general is too severe,</L>
<L>Her Spirit seems her int'rest to oppose,</L>
<L>And, where She makes one friend, makes twenty foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>C.</HI> Your Lordship's fears are just, I feel their force,</L>
<L>But only feel it as thing of course.</L>
<L>The Man, whose hardy Spirit shall engage</L>
<L>To lash the vices of a guilty age,</L>
<L>At his first setting forward ought to know,</L>
<L>That ev'ry rogue he meets must be his foe,</L>
<L>That the rude breath of Satire will provoke</L>
<L>Many who feel, and more who fear the stroke.</L>
<L>But shall the partial rage of selfish men</L>
<L>From stubborn Justice wrench the righteous pen,</L>
<L>Or shall I not my settled course pursue,</L>
<L>Because my foes, are foes to Virtue too?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>L.</HI> What is this boasted Virtue, taught in Schools,</L>
<L>And idly drawn from antiquated rules?</L>
<L>What is her Use? point out one wholesome end?</L>
<L>Will She hurt foes, or can She make a Friend?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>When from long fasts fierce appetites arise,</L>
<L>Can this same Virtue stifle Nature's cries?</L>
<L>Can She the pittance of a meal afford,</L>
<L>Or bid thee welcome to one great Man's board?</L>
<L>When Northern winds the rough December arm</L>
<L>With frost and snow, can Virtue keep thee warm?</L>
<L>Canst Thou dismiss the hard unfeeling Dun</L>
<L>Barely by saying, Thou art Virtue's Son?</L>
<L>Or by base blund'ring Statesmen sent to jail,</L>
<L>Will MANSFIELD take this Virtue for thy bail?</L>
<L>Believe it not, the Name is in disgrace,</L>
<L>Virtue and TEMPLE now are out of place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quit then this Meteor, whose delusive ray</L>
<L>From wealth and honour leads thee far astray.</L>
<L>True Virtue means, let Reason use her eyes,</L>
<L>Nothing with Fools, and Int'rest with the Wise.</L>
<L>Would'st Thou be great, her patronage disclaim,</L>
<L>Nor madly triumph in so mean a name:</L>
<L>Let nobler wreaths thy happy brows adorn,</L>
<L>And leave to Virtue poverty and scorn.</L>
<L>Let Prudence be thy guide; who doth not know</L>
<L>How seldom Prudence can with Virtue go?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>To be Successful try thy utmost force,</L>
<L>And Virtue follows as a thing of course.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIRCO, who knows not HIRCO, stains the bed</L>
<L>Of that kind Master who first gave him bread,</L>
<L>Scatters the seeds of discord thro' the land,</L>
<L>Breaks ev'ry public, ev'ry private band,</L>
<L>Beholds with joy a trusting friend undone,</L>
<L>Betrays a Brother, and would cheat a Son:</L>
<L>What mortal in his senses can endure</L>
<L>The name of HIRCO, for the wretch is poor?</L>
<L>"Let him hang, drown, starve, on a dunghill rot,</L>
<L>"By all detested live, and die forgot;</L>
<L>"Let him, a poor return, in ev'ry breath</L>
<L>"Feel all death's pains, yet be whole years in death,"</L>
<L>Is now the gen'ral cry we all pursue;</L>
<L>Let FORTUNE change, and PRUDENCE changes too,</L>
<L>Supple and pliant a new system feels,</L>
<L>Throws up her Cap, and spaniels at his heels,</L>
<L>Long live Great HIRCO, cries, by int'rest taught,</L>
<L>And let his foes, tho' I prove one, be nought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>C.</HI> Peace to such Men, if such Men can have peace,</L>
<L>Let their Possessions, let their State increase,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>Let their base services in Courts strike root,</L>
<L>And in the season bring forth golden fruit,</L>
<L>I envy not; let those who have the will,</L>
<L>And, with so little Spirit, so much skill,</L>
<L>With such vile instruments their fortunes carve;</L>
<L>Rogues may grow fat, an Honest man dares starve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>L.</HI> These stale conceits thrown off, let us advance</L>
<L>For once to real life, and quit Romance.</L>
<L>Starve! pretty talking! but I fain would view</L>
<L>That man, that honest man would do it too.</L>
<L>Hence to Yon Mountain which outbraves the sky,</L>
<L>And dart from pole to pole thy strengthen'd eye,</L>
<L>Thro' all that space You shall not view one man,</L>
<L>Not one, who dares to act on such a plan.</L>
<L>Cowards in calms will say, what in a storm</L>
<L>The Brave will tremble at, and not perform.</L>
<L>Thine be the Proof, and, spite of all You've said,</L>
<L>You'd give Your Honour for a crust of bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>C.</HI> What Proof might do, what Hunger might effect,</L>
<L>What famish'd Nature, looking with neglect</L>
<L>On all She once held dear, what Fear, at strife</L>
<L>With fainting Virtue for the means of life,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Might make this coward flesh, in love with breath,</L>
<L>Shudd'ring at pain, and shrinking back from death,</L>
<L>In treason to my soul, descend to bear,</L>
<L>Trusting to Fate, I neither know, nor care,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Once,</HI> at this hour those wounds afresh I feel,</L>
<L>Which nor Prosperity nor Time can heal,</L>
<L>Those wounds, which Fate severely hath decreed,</L>
<L>Mention'd or thought of, must for ever bleed,</L>
<L>Those wounds, which humbled all that pride of Man,</L>
<L>Which brings such mighty aid to Virtue's plan;</L>
<L><HI>Once,</HI> aw'd by Fortune's most oppressive frown,</L>
<L>By legal rapine to the earth bow'd down,</L>
<L>My Credit at last gasp, my State undone,</L>
<L>Trembling to meet the shock I could not shun,</L>
<L>Virtue gave ground, and blank despair prevail'd;</L>
<L>Sinking beneath the storm, my Spirits fail'd,</L>
<L>Like PETER's Faith, 'till One, a Friend indeed,</L>
<L>May all distress find such in time of need,</L>
<L>One kind good Man, in act, in word, in thought,</L>
<L>By Virtue guided, and by Wisdom taught,</L>
<L>Image of him whom Christians should adore,</L>
<L>Stretch'd forth his hand, and brought me safe to shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<L><HI>Since,</HI> by good fortune into notice rais'd,</L>
<L>And for some little merit largely prais'd,</L>
<L>Indulg'd in swerving from Prudential rules,</L>
<L>Hated by Rogues, and not belov'd by Fools,</L>
<L>Plac'd above want, shall abject thirst of wealth</L>
<L>So fiercely war 'gainst my Soul's dearest health,</L>
<L>That, as a boon, I should base shackles crave,</L>
<L>And, born to Freedom, make myself a slave;</L>
<L>That I should in the train of those appear,</L>
<L>Whom Honour cannot love, nor Manhood fear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That I no longer skulk from street to street,</L>
<L>Afraid least Duns assail, and Bailiffs meet;</L>
<L>That I from place to place this carcase bear,</L>
<L>Walk forth at large, and wander free as air;</L>
<L>That I no longer dread the aukward friend,</L>
<L>Whose very obligations must offend,</L>
<L>Nor, all too froward, with impatience burn</L>
<L>At suff'ring favours which I can't return;</L>
<L>That, from dependance and from pride secure,</L>
<L>I am not plac'd so high to scorn the poor,</L>
<L>Nor yet so low, that I my Lord should fear,</L>
<L>Or hesitate to give him sneer for sneer;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>That, whilst sage Prudence my pursuits confirms,</L>
<L>I can enjoy the world on equal terms;</L>
<L>That, kind to others, to myself most true,</L>
<L>Feeling no want, I comfort those who do,</L>
<L>And with the will have pow'r to aid distress;</L>
<L>These, and what other blessings I possess,</L>
<L>From the indulgence of the PUBLIC rise;</L>
<L>All private Patronage my Soul defies.</L>
<L>By Candour more inclin'd to save, than damn,</L>
<L>A gen'rous PUBLIC made me what I Am.</L>
<L>All that I have, They gave; just Mem'ry bears,</L>
<L>The grateful stamp, and what I am is Theirs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>L.</HI> To feign a red-hot zeal for freedom's cause,</L>
<L>To mouthe aloud for liberties and laws,</L>
<L>For Public good to bellow all abroad,</L>
<L>Serves well the purposes of private fraud.</L>
<L>Prudence, by Public good intends her own;</L>
<L>If You mean otherwise, You stand alone.</L>
<L>What do we mean by Country and by Court,</L>
<L>What is it to Oppose, what to Support?</L>
<L>Mere words of course, and what is more absurd</L>
<L>Than to pay homage to an empty word!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>MAJORS and MINORS differ but in name,</L>
<L>Patriots and Ministers are much the same;</L>
<L>The only diff'rence, after all their rout,</L>
<L>Is that the One is <HI>in,</HI> the Other <HI>out.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Explore the dark recesses of the mind,</L>
<L>In the Soul's honest volume read mankind,</L>
<L>And own, in wise and simple, great and small,</L>
<L>The same grand leading Principle in All.</L>
<L>Whate'er we talk of wisdom to the wise,</L>
<L>Of goodness to the good, of public ties</L>
<L>Which to our country link, of private bands</L>
<L>Which claim most dear attention at our hands,</L>
<L>For Parent and for Child, for Wife and Friend,</L>
<L>Our first great Mover, and our last great End,</L>
<L>Is One, and, by whatever name we call</L>
<L>The ruling Tyrant, SELF is All in All.</L>
<L>This, which unwilling Faction shall admit,</L>
<L>Guided in diff'rent ways a BUTE and PITT,</L>
<L>Made Tyrants break, made Kings observe the law,</L>
<L>And gave the world a STUART and NASSAU.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hath Nature (strange and wild conceit of Pride)</L>
<L>Distinguish'd thee from all her sons beside?</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>Doth Virtue in thy bosom brighter glow,</L>
<L>Or from a Spring more pure doth Action flow?</L>
<L>Is not thy Soul bound with those very chains</L>
<L>Which shackle us, or is that SELF, which reigns</L>
<L>O'er Kings and Beggars, which in all we see</L>
<L>Most strong and sov'reign, only weak in Thee?</L>
<L>Fond man, believe it not; Experience tells</L>
<L>'Tis not thy Virtue, but thy Pride rebels.</L>
<L>Think, and for once lay by thy lawless pen;</L>
<L>Think, and confess thyself like other men;</L>
<L>Think but one hour, and, to thy Conscience led</L>
<L>By Reason's hand, bow down and hang thy head;</L>
<L>Think on thy private life, recal thy Youth,</L>
<L>View thyself now, and own with strictest truth,</L>
<L>That SELF hath drawn Thee from fair Virtue's way</L>
<L>Farther than Folly would have dar'd to stray,</L>
<L>And that the talents lib'ral Nature gave</L>
<L>To make thee free, have made thee more a slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quit then, in prudence quit, that idle train</L>
<L>Of toys, which have so long abus'd thy brain,</L>
<L>And captive led thy pow'rs; with boundless will</L>
<L>Let SELF maintain her state and empire still,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>But let her, with more worthy objects caught,</L>
<L>Strain all the faculties and force of thought</L>
<L>To things of higher daring; let her range</L>
<L>Thro' better pastures, and learn how to change;</L>
<L>Let her, no longer to weak faction tied,</L>
<L>Wisely revolt, and join our stronger side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>C.</HI> Ah! what, my Lord, hath private life to do</L>
<L>With things of public Nature? why to view</L>
<L>Would You thus cruelly those scenes unfold,</L>
<L>Which, without pain and horror to behold,</L>
<L>Must speak me something more, or less than man;</L>
<L>Which Friends may pardon, but I never can?</L>
<L>Look back! a Thought which borders on despair,</L>
<L>Which human Nature must, yet cannot bear.</L>
<L>'Tis not the babbling of a busy world,</L>
<L>Where Praise and Censure are at random hurl'd,</L>
<L>Which can the meanest of my thoughts controul,</L>
<L>Or shake one settled purpose of my Soul.</L>
<L>Free and at large might their wild curses roam,</L>
<L>If All, if All alas! were well at home.</L>
<L>No—'tis the tale which angry Conscience tells,</L>
<L>When She with more than tragic horror swells</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>Each circumstance of guilt; when stern, but true,</L>
<L>She brings bad actions forth into review;</L>
<L>And, like the dread hand-writing on the wall,</L>
<L>Bids late Remorse awake at Reason's call,</L>
<L>Arm'd at all points bids Scorpion Vengeance pass,</L>
<L>And to the mind holds up Reflexion's glass,</L>
<L>The mind, which starting, heaves the heart-felt groan,</L>
<L>And hates that form She knows to be her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of this—let private sorrows rest—</L>
<L>As to the Public I dare stand the test;</L>
<L>Dare proudly boast, I feel no wish above</L>
<L>The good of ENGLAND, and my Country's love.</L>
<L>Stranger to Party-rage, by Reason's voice,</L>
<L>Unerring guide, directed in my choice,</L>
<L>Not all the tyrant pow'rs of earth combin'd,</L>
<L>No, nor of hell, shall make me change my mind.</L>
<L>What! herd with men my honest soul disdains,</L>
<L>Men who, with servile zeal, are forging chains</L>
<L>For Freedom's neck, and lend a helping hand,</L>
<L>To spread destruction o'er my native land.</L>
<L>What! shall I not, e'en to my latest breath,</L>
<L>In the full face of danger and of death,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>Exert that little strength which Nature gave,</L>
<L>And boldy stem, or perish in the wave?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>L.</HI> When I look backward for some fifty years,</L>
<L>And see Protesting Patriots turn'd to Peers;</L>
<L>Hear men, most loose, for decency declaim,</L>
<L>And talk of Character, without a name;</L>
<L>See Infidels assert the cause of God,</L>
<L>And meek Divines wield persecution's rod;</L>
<L>See men transform'd to brutes, and brutes to men,</L>
<L>See WHITEHEAD take a place, RALPH change his pen,</L>
<L>I mock the zeal, and deem the Men in sport,</L>
<L>Who rail at Ministers, and curse a Court.</L>
<L>Thee, haughty as Thou art, and proud in rime,</L>
<L>Shall some Preferment, offer'd at a time</L>
<L>When Virtue sleeps, some Sacrifice to Pride,</L>
<L>Or some fair Victim, move to change thy side.</L>
<L>Thee shall these eyes behold, to health restor'd,</L>
<L>Using, as Prudence bids, bold Satire's sword,</L>
<L>Galling thy present friends, and praising those,</L>
<L>Whom now thy frenzy holds thy greatest foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>C.</HI> May I, (can worse disgrace on manhood fall?)</L>
<L>Be born a WHITEHEAD, and baptiz'd a PAUL;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>May I (tho' to his service deeply tied</L>
<L>By sacred oaths, and now by will allied)</L>
<L>With false feign'd zeal an injur'd God defend,</L>
<L>And use his name for some base private end;</L>
<L>May I (that thought bids double horrors roll</L>
<L>O'er my sick Spirits, and unmans my soul)</L>
<L>Ruin the Virtue which I held most dear,</L>
<L>And still must hold; may I, thro' abject fear,</L>
<L>Betray my Friend; may to succeeding times,</L>
<L>Engrav'd on plates of Adamant, my crimes</L>
<L>Stand blazing forth, whilst mark'd with envious blot,</L>
<L>Each little act of Virtue is forgot;</L>
<L>Of all those evils which, to stamp men curs'd,</L>
<L>Hell keeps in store for vengeance, may the worst</L>
<L>Light on my head, and in my day of woe,</L>
<L>To make the cup of bitterness o'erflow,</L>
<L>May I be scorn'd by ev'ry man of worth,</L>
<L>Wander, like Cain, a vagabond on earth,</L>
<L>Bearing about a Hell in my own mind,</L>
<L>Or be to SCOTLAND for my life confin'd,</L>
<L>If I am one amongst the many known,</L>
<L>Whom SHELBURNE fled, and CALCRAFT blush'd to own.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/><HI>L.</HI> Do you reflect what men you make your foes?</L>

<L>Friends I have made, whom Envy must commend,</L>
<L>But not one foe, whom I would wish a friend.</L>
<L>What if ten thousand BUTES and FOXES bawl,</L>

<L>'Tis not the Title, whether handed down</L>
<L>From age to age, or flowing from the crown</L>
<L>In copious streams on recent men, who came</L>
<L>From stems unknown, and sires without a name;</L>
<L>'Tis not the STAR, which our great EDWARD gave</L>
<L>To mark the virtuous, and reward the brave,</L>
<L>Blazing without, whilst a base heart within</L>
<L>Is rotten to the core with filth and sin;</L>
<L>'Tis not the tinsel grandeur, taught to wait,</L>
<L>At custom's call, to mark a fool of State</L>
<L>From fools of lesser note, that Soul can awe</L>
<L>Whose Pride is Reason, whose Defence is Law.</L>

<L>In vengeance with fresh STUARTS curse our state;</L>

<L>Thou GOD of <HI>Truth,</HI> Thou great, all-searching Eye,</L>
