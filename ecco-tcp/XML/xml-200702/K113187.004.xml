<DIV1 N="44" TYPE="section">

<P>MORE poetry was written in the single reign of Elizabeth, than in the two preceding centuries. The same causes, among others already enumerated and explained, which called forth genius and imagination, such as the new sources of fiction opened by a study of the classics, a familiarity with the French Italian and Spanish writers, the growing elegancies of the English language, the diffusion of polished manners, the felicities of long peace and public pros∣perity, and a certain freedom and activity of mind which im∣mediately followed the national emancipation from superstition, contributed also to produce innumerable compositions in poetry. In prosecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign, it there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore becomes necessary to reduce such a latitude of materials to some sort of methodical arrangement. On which account, I shall class and consider the poets of this reign, under the general heads, or divisions, of SATIRE, SON∣NET, PASTORAL, and MISCELLANEOUS poetry. Spenser will stand alone, without a class, and without a rival.</P>

Satire, specifically so called, did not commence in England till the latter end of the reign of queen Elizabeth. We have seen, indeed, that eclogues, and allegories were made the vehicle of satire, and that many poems of a satirical tendency had been published, long ago. And here, the censure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy, than extended to popular follies and vices. But the first professed English satirist, to speak technically, is bishop Joseph Hall, successive∣ly bishop of Exeter and Norwich, born at Bristow-park within the parish of Ashby de la Zouch in Leicestershire, in the year 1574, and at the age of fifteen, in the year 1588, admitted into Emanuel-college at Cambridge, where he remained about eight years. He soon became eminent in the theology of those times, preached against predestination before prince Henry with unrivalled applause, and discussed the doctrines of Armi∣nianism in voluminous dissertations. But so variable are our studies, and so fickle is opinion, that the poet is better known to posterity than the prelate or the polemic. His satires have outlived his sermons at court, and his laborious confutations of the Brownists. One of his later controversial tracts is, however, remembered on account of the celebrity of its an∣tagonist. When Milton descended from his dignity to plead the cause of fanaticism and ideal liberty, bishop Hall was the defender of our hierarchical establishment. Bayle, who knew Hall only as a theologist, seems to have written his life merely because he was one of the English divines at the Synod of Dort, in 1618. From his inflexible and conscientious attach∣ment to the royal and episcopal cause under king Charles the first, he suffered in his old age the severities of imprisonment and sequestration; and lived to see his cathedral converted into a barrack, and his palace into an ale-house. His uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world, and his mildness of manners and his humility were characteristical. He died, and was obscurely buried with∣out a memorial on his grave, in 1656, and in his eighty second
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
year, at Heigham a small village near Norwich, where he had sought shelter from the storms of usurpation, and the intole∣rance of presbyterianism.</P>
<P>I have had the good fortune to see bishop Hall's funeral∣sermon, preached some days after his interment, on the thir∣tieth day of September, 1656, at saint Peter's church in Nor∣wich, by one John Whitefoote, Master of Arts, and rector of Heigham. The preacher, no contemptible orator, before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the pa∣triarch Israel, thus illustrates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned, and which I am now hasten∣ing to consider. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Two yeares together he was chosen rheto∣rick professor in the universitie of Cambridge, and perform∣ed the office with extraordinary applause. He was noted for a singular wit from his youth: a most acute rhetorician, and an elegant poet. He understood many tongues; and in the rhetorick of his own, he was second to none that lived in his time <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fol. 3.</NOTE>."</Q> It is much to our present purpose to observe, that the style of his prose is strongly tinctured with the man∣ner of Seneca. The writer of the satires is perceptible in some of his gravest polemical or scriptural treatises; which are per∣petually interspersed with excursive illustrations, familiar allusions, and observations on life. Many of them were early translated into French; and their character is well drawn by himself, in a dedication to James the first, who perhaps would have much better relished a more sedate and profound theology. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Seldome any man hath offered to your royall hands a greater bundle of his owne thoughts, nor perhaps more varietie of discourse.

At the age of twenty-three, while a student at Emanuel∣college, and in the year 1597, he published at London three Books of anonymous Satires, which he called <HI>Toothless</HI> SATYRS, <HI>poetical, academical, moral</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In small duodecimo, Wh.

By VIR∣GIDEMIA, an uncouth and uncommon word, we are to under∣stand a Gathering or Harvest of rods, in reference to the nature of the subject.</P>
<P>These satires are marked with a classical precision, to which English poetry had yet rarely attained. They are replete with animation of style and sentiment. The indignation of the satirist is always the result of good sense. Nor are the thorns of severe invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry. The characters are delineated in strong and lively colouring, and their discriminations are touched with the masterly traces of genuine humour. The versification is equally energetic and elegant, and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the mo∣dern standard. It is no inconsiderable proof of a genius pre∣dominating over the general taste of an age when every preacher was a punster, to have written verses, where laughter was to be raised, and the reader to be entertained with sallies of pleasantry, without quibbles and conceits. His chief fault is obscurity, arising from a remote phraseology, constrained combinations, unfamiliar allusions, elleiptical apostrophes, and abruptness of expression. Perhaps some will think, that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactness and pe∣dantic anxiety of the scholar and the student. Ariosto in Ita∣lian, and Regnier in French, were now almost the only mo∣dern writers of satire: and I believe there had been an Eng∣lish translation of Ariosto's satires. But Hall's acknowledged patterns are Juvenal and Persius, not without some touches of
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
the urbanity of Horace. His parodies of these poets, or rather his adaptations of antient to modern manners, a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by Oldham, Ro∣chester, and Pope, discover great facility and dexterity of invention. The moral gravity and the censorial declamation of Juvenal, he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection, or adorns with a novelty and variety of images.</P>
<P>In the opening of his general PROLOGUE, he expresses a decent consciousness of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking. The laurel which he sought had been unworn, and it was not to be won without hazard.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>His first book, containing nine satires, is aimed at the nu∣merous impotent yet fashionable scribblers with which his age was infested. It must be esteemed a curious and valuable pic∣ture, drawn from real life, of the abuses of poetical composi∣tion which then prevailed; and which our author has at once exposed with the wit of a spirited satirist, and the good taste of a judicious critic. Of Spenser, who could not have been his cotemporary at Cambridge, as some have thought, but perhaps was his friend, he constantly speaks with respect and applause.</P>
<P>I avail myself of a more minute analysis of this Book, not only as displaying the critical talents of our satirist, but as his∣torical of the poetry of the present period, and illustrative of my general subject. And if in general, I should be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of these satires, my apology must be, my wish to revive a neglected writer of real genius, and my opinion, that the first legitimate author in our language of a species of poetry of the most important and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
popular utility, which our countrymen have so successfully cultivated, and from which Pope derives his chief celebrity, deserved to be distinguished with a particular degree of attention.</P>
<P>From the first satire, which I shall exhibit at length, we learn what kinds of pieces were then most in fashion, and in what manner they were written. They seem to have been, tales of love and chivalry, amatorial sonnets, tragedies, come∣dies, and pastorals.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>The compliment in the close to Spenser, is introduced and turned with singular address and elegance. The allusion is to Spenser's beautiful episode of the marriage of Thames and Medway, recently published, in 1595, in the fourth book of the second part of the FAIRY QUEEN <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">B. iv. C. xi.</NOTE>. But had I, says the poet, been inclined to invoke the assistance of a Muse, what Muse, even of a lower order, is there now to be found, who would condescend to sit and sing on the desolated margin of the Cam? The Muses frequent other rivers, ever since Spenser celebrated the nuptials of Thames and Medway. Cam has now nothing on his banks but willows, the types of desertion.</P>
<P>I observe here in general, that Thomas Hudson and Henry Lock, were the Bavius and Mevius of this age. In the RE∣TURN FROM PARNASSUS, 1606, they are thus consigned to oblivion by Judicio. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Locke and Hudson, sleep you quiet

<Q><L>And at her eare a pearle of greater valew</L>

Yet he is commended by Harrington for making this translation in a <Q REND="inline">"verie good and sweet English verse <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Transl. ORL. FUR. Notes, B. xxxv. p. 296. 1633. Hence, or from an old Play, the name HOLOFERNES got into Shake∣speare.</NOTE>,"</Q> and is largely cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, 1600. Lock applied the Sonnet to a spiritual purpose, and substituting christian love in the place of amorous passion, made it the vehicle of humiliation, holy comfort, and thanksgiving. This book he dedicated, under the title of the PASSIONATE PRESENT to queen Elizabeth, who perhaps from the title expected to be entertained with a subject of very different nature <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">I have before cited this Collection, which appeared in 1597, vol. iii. 445. That was a second edition. To his EC∣CLESIASTES there is a recommendatory poem by Lilly. Some of David's Psalms in verse appear with his name the same year.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the second satire, our author poetically laments that the nine Muses are no longer vestal virgins.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Whilom the Muses nine were vestal maides,</L>
<L>And held their temple in the secret shades</L>
<L>Of faire Parnassvs, that two-headed hill</L>
<L>Whose avncient fame the southern world did fill:</L>
<L>And in the stead of their eternal fame</L>
<L>Was the cool stream, that took his endless name</L>
<L>From out the fertile hoof of winged steed:</L>
<L>There did they sit, and do their holy deed</L>
<L>That pleas'd both heaven and earth.—</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He complains, that the <HI>rabble of rymesters new</HI> have engraft∣ed the myrtle on the bay; and that poetry, departing from its antient moral tendency, has been unnaturally perverted to the
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
purposes of corruption and impurity. The Muses have chang∣ed, in defiance of chastity,

<P>Marlow's OVID'S ELEGIES, and some of the dissolute sallies of Green and Nash, seem to be here pointed out.

<P>In the subsequent satire, our author more particularly censures the intemperance of his brethren; and illustrates their absolute inability to write, till their imaginations were animated by wine, in the following apt and witty comparison, which is worthy of Young.</P>
<Q><LG>

</LG></Q>
<P>In the succeeding lines, he confines his attack to Marlow, eminent for his drunken frolicks, who was both a player and a poet, and whose tragedy of TAMERLANE THE GREAT, repre∣sented before the year 1588, published in 1590, and confessed∣ly one of the worst of his plays, abounds in bombast. Its false splendour was also burlesqued by Beaumont and Fletcher in the COXCOMB; and it has these two lines, which are ridiculed by Pistol, in Shakespeare's KING HENRY THE FOURTH <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">A. ii.

<Q><L>Holla, you pamper'd jades of Asia,</L>

We should, in the mean time, remember, that by many of the most skilful of our dramatic writers, tragedy was now thought almost essentially and solely to consist, in the pomp of declamation, in sounding expressions, and unnatural amplifica∣tions of style. But to proceed.</P>

To complete these genuine and humorous anecdotes of the state of our stage in the reign of Elizabeth, I make no apology for adding the paragraph immediately following, which records the infancy of theatric criticism.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the next satire, he resumes this topic. He seems to have conceived a contempt for blank verse; ob∣serving that the English iambic is written with little trouble, and seems rather a spontaneous effusion, than an artificial con∣struction.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Too popular is tragick poesie,</L>

<L>Compileth worm-eat stories of old times.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>To these antique tales he condemns the application of the extravagant enchantments of Ariosto's ORLANDO FURIOSO, particularly of such licentious fictions as the removal of Merlin's tomb from Wales into France, or Tuscany, by the magic ope∣rations of the sorceress Melissa <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See ORL.

<P>Our poets, too frequently the children of idleness, too naturally the lovers of pleasure, began now to be men of the world, and affected to mingle in the dissipations and debauche∣ries of the metropolis. To support a popularity of character, not so easily attainable in the obscurities of retirement and study, they frequented taverns, became libertines and buffoons, and exhilarated the circles of the polite and the profligate. Their way of life gave the colour to their writings: and what had been the favourite topic of conversation, was sure to please, when recommended by the graces of poetry. Add to this, that poets now began to write for hire, and a rapid sale was to be obtained at the expence of the purity of the reader's mind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harrington has an Epigram on this subject.

<P>By <HI>tauernings,</HI> he means the encreasing fashion of frequent∣ing taverns, which seems to have multiplied with the play∣hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. As new modes of entertainment sprung up, and new places of public resort became common, the people were more often called together, and the scale of convivial life in London was enlarged.

In the second satire, he celebrates the wisdom and liberality of our ancestors, in erecting magnificent mansions for the ac∣commodation of scholars, which yet at present have little more use than that of reproaching the rich with their comparative neglect of learning.

<P>One of the vanities of the age of Elizabeth was the erection of monuments, equally costly and cumbersome, charged with a waste of capricious decorations, and loaded with superfluous and disproportionate sculpture. They succeeded to the rich solemnity of the gothic shrine, which yet, amid a profusion of embellishments, preserved uniform principles of architecture.</P>

<P>In the next, is the figure of a famished Gallant, or beau, which is much better drawn than in any of the comedies of those times. His hand is perpetually on the hilt of his rapier.

<P>In the Prologue to this book, our author strives to obviate the objections of certain critics who falsely and foolishly thought his satires too perspicuous. Nothing could be more absurd, than the notion, that because Persius is obscure, therefore obscurity must be necessarily one of the qualities of satire. If Persius, under the severities of a proscriptive and sanguinary government, was often obliged to conceal his meaning, this was not the case of Hall. But the darkness and difficulties of Persius arise in great measure from his own affectation and false taste. He would have been enigmatical under the mildest government. To be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any species of writing. Hall of himself is certainly obscure: yet he owes some of his obscurity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the Roman satirists.</P>
<P>The fourth Book breathes a stronger spirit of indignation,
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
and abounds with applications of Juvenal to modern manners, yet with the appearance of original and unborrowed satire.</P>
<P>The first is miscellaneous and excursive, but the subjects often lead to an unbecoming licentiousness of language and images. In the following nervous lines, he has caught and finely heightened the force and manner of his master.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Who list, excuse, when chaster dames can hire</L>

<L>After her husband's dozen years despair:</L>
<L>And now the bribed midwife sweares apace,</L>
<L>The bastard babe doth beare his father's face.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He thus enhances the value of certain novelties, by declaring them to be,
<Q><L>Worth little less than landing of a whale,</L>
<L>Or Gades spoils <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cadiz was newly taken.</NOTE>, or a churl's funerale.</L></Q></P>
<P>The allusion is to Spenser's Talus in the following couplet,
<Q><L>Gird but the cynicke's helmet on his head,</L>
<L>Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of leade?</L></Q></P>
<P>He adds, that the guilty person, when marked, destroys all distinction, like the cuttle-fish concealed in his own blackness.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L><PB N="32" REF="32"/>
Who list, complaine of wronged faith or fame,</L>
<L>When he may shift it to another's name.</L>

<P>He thus describes the effect of his satire, and the enjoyment of his own success in this species of poetry.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Now see I fire-flakes sparkle from his eyes,</L>
<L>Like to a comet's tayle in th' angrie skies:</L>

<P>The second is the character of an old country squire, who starves himself, to breed his son a lawyer and a gentleman. It appears, that the vanity or luxury of purchasing dainties at an exorbitant price began early.</P>

Great part of the third satire of the same book turns on this idea.</NOTE>. It may be presumed, that the practice was then carried on with the most arbitrary spirit of oppression and monopoly.</P>
<P>The third is on the pride of pedigree. The introduction is from Juvenal's eighth satire; and the substitution of the memo∣rials of English ancestry, such as were then fashionable, in the place of Juvenal's parade of family statues without arms or ears, is remarkably happy. But the humour is half lost, unless by recollecting the Roman original, the reader perceives the unexpected parallel.</P>

<P>The last of this Book, is a satire on the pageantries of the papal chair, and the superstitious practices of popery, with which it is easy to make sport.

<P>But this sort of ridicule is improper and dangerous. It has a tendency, even without an entire parity of circumstances, to burlesque the celebration of this aweful solemnity in the re∣formed church.

<P>The last Book consisting of one long satire only, is a sort of epilogue to the whole, and contains a humorous ironical de∣scription of the effect of his satires, and a recapitulatory view of many of the characters and foibles which he had before delineated. But the scribblers seem to have the chief share. The character of Labeo, already repeatedly mentioned, who was some cotemporary poet, a constant censurer of our author, and who from pastoral proceeded to heroic poetry, is here more distinctly represented. He was a writer who affected compound epithets, which sir Philip Sydney had imported from France, and first used in his ARCADIA <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">We have our author's opinion of Skelton in these lines of this satire. f. 83.

In epithets to joine two words in one,</L>
<L>Forsooth, for adjectives can't stand alone.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The arts of composition must have been much practiced, and a knowledge of critical niceties widely diffused, when ob∣servations of this kind could be written. He proceeds to remark, it was now customary for every poet, before he attempted the dignity of heroic verse, to try his strength by writing pastorals <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Though these lines bear a general sense, yet at the same time they seem to be connected with the character of Labeo, by which they are introduced.

It is extraor∣dinary, that they should not have afforded any <HI>choice flowers</HI> to ENGLAND'S PARNAS∣SUS, printed in 1600.</NOTE>. But whatever fame they had acquired, it soon received a check, which was never recovered. They were condemned to the flames, as licentious and immoral, by an order of bishop Bancroft in 1599. And this is obviously the chief reason why they are not named by our author, in the SPECIALITIES of his Life, written by himself after his preferment to a bishoprick <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">SHAKING OF THE OLIVE, or his Re∣maining Works, 1660. 4to. Nor are they here inserted.</NOTE>. They were, however, admired and imitated by Oldham. And Pope, who modernised Donne, is said to have wished he had seen Hall's satires sooner. But had Pope undertaken to modernise Hall, he must have adopt∣ed, because he could not have improved, many of his lines. Hall is too finished and smooth for such an operation. Donne, though he lived so many years later, was susceptible of modern refinement, and his asperities were such as wanted and would bear the chissel.</P>
<P>I was informed, by the late learned bishop of Glocester, that in a copy of Hall's Satires in Pope's library, the whole first satire of the sixth book was corrected in the margin, or interlined, in Pope's own hadn; and that Pope had written at the head of that satire, OPTIMA SATIRA.</P>
<P>Milton who had a controversy with Hall, as I have observed, in a remonstrance called an APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS, published in 1641, rather unsuitably and disingenuously goes out of his way, to attack these satires, a juvenile effort of his dignified adversary, and under every consideration alien to the dispute. Milton's strictures are more sarcastic than critical; yet they deserve to be cited, more especially as they present a striking specimen of those aukward attempts at humour and raillery, which disgrace his prose-works.</P>

who would be counted the FIRST ENGLISH SATYRIST, to abase himselfe to, who might have learned better among the Latin and Italian Satyrists, and in our own tongue from the VISION AND CREEDE OF PIERCE PLOWMAN, besides others before him, manifested a presumptuous undertaking with weak and unexamined shoulders. For a Satyr is as it were born out of a Tragedy, so ought to resemble his parentage, to strike high, and adventure dangerously at the most eminent vices among the greatest persons, and not to creep into every blind taphouse that fears a constable more than a satyr. But that such a poem should be TOOTHLESS, I still affirm it to be a bull, taking away the essence of that which it calls itself. For if it bite neither the persons nor the vices, how is it a satyr? And if it bite either, how is it toothless? So that TOOTHLESS SATYRS, are as much as if he had said TOOTHLESS TEETH, &amp;c <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS, Mil∣ton's Prose-works, vol. i. p. 186. edit. Amst. 1698. fol.

<P>With Hall's SATIRES should be ranked his MUNDUS ALTER ET IDEM, an ingenious satirical fiction in prose, where under a pretended description of the TERRA AUSTRALIS, he forms a pleasant invective against the characteristic vices of various nations, and is remarkably severe on the church of Rome. This piece was written about the year 1600, before he had quitted the classics for the fathers, and published some years afterwards, against his consent. Under the same class should also be mentioned his CHARACTERISMES OF VER∣TUES, a set of sensible and lively moral essays, which contain traces of the satires <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">WORKS ut supr. p. 171.

I take the opportunity of observing here, that among Hall's prose-works are some metaphrastic versions in metre of a few of David's Psalms <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">WORK<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, ut supr. p. 151.

<P>An able inquirer into the literature of this period has affirm∣ed, that Hall's Epistles, written before the year 1613 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See WORKS, ut supr. p. 275.</NOTE>, are the first example of epistolary composition which England had seen. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bishop Hall, he says, was not only our first satirist, but was the first who brought epistolary writing to the view of the public: which was common in that age to other parts of Europe, but not practiced in England till he published his own Epistles <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Whalley's INQUIRY INTO THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE, p. 41.</NOTE>."</Q> And Hall himself in the Dedication of his Epistles to Prince Henry observes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your grace shall herein perceiue a new fashion of discourse by EPISTLES, new to our language, vsuall to others: and, as nouelty is neuer without plea of vse, more free, more familiar <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">WORKS, ut supr. p. 172.

his epistolary style. I believe the second published correspon∣dence of this kind, and in our own language, at least of any importance after Hall, will be found to be EPISTOLAE HOE∣LIANAE, or the Letters of James Howell, a great traveller, an intimate friend of Jonson, and the first who bore the office of the royal historiographer, which discover a variety of literature, and abound with much entertaining and useful information <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"EPISTOLAE HOELIANAE, Familiar Letters, Domestic and Foreign, divided into sundry sections partly historical, po∣litical, and philosophical."</Q> Lond. 1645. 4to.

</LG></Q>
<P>In general it is not easy to give a specimen of Marston's satires, as his strongest lines are either openly vitiated with gross expression, or pervaded with a hidden vain of impure sentiment. The following humorous portrait of a sick inamorato is in his best, at least in his chastest, manner of drawing a character.</P>

<P>In the same satire he calls himself,
<Q><L>A beadle to the world's impuritie!</L></Q></P>
<P>Marston seems to have been the poetic rival of Hall at Cambridge, whom he repeatedly censures or ridicules. In the fourth satire, he supposes Hall's criticisms on Dubartas, the versions of David's Psalms by Sternhold and king James, Southwell's MARY and SAINT PETER'S TEARS, the MIR∣ROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and other pieces of equal reputa∣tion, to be the production of pedantry or malignity. And the remainder of this satire is no unpleasant parody of Hall's prefatory stanzas against envy <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from the SCOURGE OF VILLANIE, that Hall had caused a severe Epigram to be pasted on the last page of every copy of Marston's PIGMALION'S IMAGE, that was sent from London to the booksellers of Cambridge.

The comparison of the workmanship of a laced and plaited ruff, to the laboured nicety of the steel-work of Woodstock, is just. He adds, with an appearance of wit,
<Q><L>It hath more doubles farre than Ajax shield.</L></Q>
This was no exaggeration. The shield of Ajax was only sevenfold. To say nothing of one of the leading ideas, the delicacy of con∣texture, which could not belong to such a shield.</P>

<P>It is not that I am afraid of being tedious, that I find myself obliged to refrain from producing any more citations. There are however, a few more passages which may safely be quoted, but which I choose to reserve for future illustration.</P>
<P>There is a carelessness and laxity in Marston's versification, but there is a freedom and facility, which Hall has too fre∣quently missed, by labouring to confine the sense to the couplet. Hall's measures are more musical, not because the music of verse consists in uniformity of pause, and regularity of cadence. Hall had a correcter ear; and his lines have a tuneful strength, in proportion as his language is more polished, his phraseology more select, and his structure more studied. Hall's meaning, among other reasons, is not always so soon apprehended, on account of his compression both in sentiment and diction. Marston is more perspicuous, as he thinks less and writes hastily. Hall is superiour in penetration, accurate conception of character, acuteness of reflection, and the ac∣cumulation of thoughts and images. Hall has more humour, Marston more acrimony. Hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent perusal of other satirists, Marston from real life. Yet Hall has a larger variety of characters. He possessed the talent of borrowing with address, and of giving originality to his copies. On the whole, Hall is more elegant, exact, and elaborate.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68"/>
It is Marston's misfortune, that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel. His stream of poetry, if some∣times bright and unpolluted, almost always betrays a muddy bottom. The satirist who too freely indulges himself in the display of that licentiousness which he means to proscribe, ab∣solutely defeats his own design. He inflames those passions which he professes to suppress, gratifies the depravations of a prurient curiosity, and seduces innocent minds to an acquaint∣ance with ideas which they might never have known.</P>
<P>The satires of Hall and Marston were condemned to the same flame and by the same authority. But Hall certainly deserved a milder sentence. Hall exposes vice, not in the wantonness of description, but with the reserve of a cautious yet lively moralist. Perhaps every censurer of obscenity does some harm, by turning the attention to an immodest object. But this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof, by shewing the pernicious consequences of volup∣tuous excesses, by suggesting motives to an opposite conduct, and by making the picture disgustful by dashes of deformity. When Vice is led forth to be sacrificed at the shrine of virtue, the victim should not be too richly dressed.</P>

Ibid. f. 38. b.</NOTE>. Bastard, a native of Blandford in Dorsetshire, was removed from a fellowship of New-College Oxford, in 1591, being, as Wood says, <Q REND="inline">"much guilty of the vices belonging to the poets, "and given to libelling <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">ATH.

EPIGR. 118.</NOTE>."</Q> Wood, in his manuscript Collection of Oxford libels and lampoons, which perhaps he took as much pleasure in collect∣ing as the authors in writing, now remaining in the Ashmolean Museum, and composed by various students of Oxford in the reign of queen Elizabeth, has preserved two of Bastard's sa∣tyrical pieces <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">One of them is entitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An admo∣nition to the City of Oxford, or Mare∣plate's Bastardine."</Q> In this piece, says Wood, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"reflects upon all persons of note in Oxford, who were guilty of amorous exploits, or that mixed them∣selves with other men's wives, or with wanton houswives in Oxon."</Q> The other is a disavowal of this lampoon, written after his expulsion, and beginning <HI>Jenkin, why man,</HI> &amp;c. See Meres, WITS TR. f. 284.</NOTE>. By the patronage or favour of lord treasurer Suffolk, he was made vicar of Bere-regis, and rector of Hamer, in Dorsetshire; and from writing smart epigrams in his youth, became in his graver years a quaint preacher <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">There are two sets of his Sermons, Five, London, 1615, 4to.

<P>Wood also, a great dealer in the works of our old minor poets, yet at the same time a frequent transcriber from Meres, still more embarrasses this matter, where he says, that Lodge, after he left Trinity college at Oxford, about the year 1576, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had spent some time in exercising his fancy among the poets in the great city, he was esteemed, not Joseph Hall of Emanuel college excepted, the best for satyr among English men <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">ATH.

<P>Owen's idea of an epigram points out the notion which now prevailed of this kind of composition, and shews the propriety of blending the epigrams and satires of these times, under one class.

<P>Of the popularity of the epigram about the year 1600, if no specimens had remained, a proof may be drawn, together with evidences of the nature of the composition, from Marston's humourous character of Tuscus, a retailer of wit.</P>
