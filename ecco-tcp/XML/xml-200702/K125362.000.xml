<L>OF all the Girls that are so smart,</L>
<L>There's none like pretty Sally,</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>There is no Lady in the Land</L>
<L>Is half so sweet as Sally.</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>Her Father he makes Cabbage-Nets,</L>
<L>And thro' the Steets does cry them.</L>
<L>Her Mother she sells Laces long</L>
<L>To those that please to buy them.</L>
<L>But sure such Folks could ne'er beget</L>
<L>So sweet a Girl as Sally,</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our alley.</L>
<L>When she is by, I leave my Work,</L>
<L>I love her so sincerely.</L>
<L>My master comes like any Turk,</L>
<L>And bangs me most severely.</L>
<L>But let him bang his Belly-full,</L>
<L>I'll bear it all for Sally.</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>Of all the Days that are in the Week,</L>
<L>I dearly love but one Day.</L>
<L>And that's the Day that comes betwixt</L>
<L>The Saturday and Monday.</L>
<L>For then I'm drest all in my Best,</L>
<L>To walk abroad with Sally.</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>My Master carries me to church,</L>
<L>And often am I blamed,</L>
<L>Because I leave him in the lurch,</L>
<L>As soon as Text is named.</L>
<L>I leave the church in Sermon-time,</L>
<L>And slink away to Sally,</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>When Christmas comes about again,</L>
<L>Oh! then I shall have money;</L>
<L>I'll hoard it up, and box it all,</L>
<L>And give it to my Honey.</L>
<L>I wish it were Ten Thousand Pounds,</L>
<L>I'd give it all to Sally,</L>
<L>She is the Darling of my Heart,</L>
<L>And she lives in our Alley.</L>
<L>My Master and the Neighbours all</L>
<L>Make Game of me and Sally,</L>
<L>And but for her I'd better be</L>
<L>A slave, and row a Galley.</L>
<L>But when my seven long Years are out,</L>
<L>Oh! then I'll marry Sally.</L>
<L>Oh I then we'll wed, and then we'll bed,</L>
<L>But not in our Alley.</L>

<HEAD>Pretty Sally's Answer.</HEAD>
<L>OF all the Lads in London Town,</L>
<L>There's none I love like Johnny.</L>
<L>He walks so stately o'er the Ground,</L>
<L>I like him for my Honey.</L>
<L>And none but him I e'er will wed,</L>
<L>As my Name is Sally:</L>
<L>And I will dress me in my Best,</L>
<L>In spite of all our Alley.</L>
<L>Because that Nan and Sue did say,</L>
<L>That live in our Alley,</L>
<L>Unto Bess Franklin, do but see,</L>
<L>Look there goes pretty Sally.</L>
<L>But let them know, tho' they say so,</L>
<L>That I have Store of Money.</L>
<L>And can an Hundred Pounds bestow</L>
<L>On John, my dearest Honey.</L>
<L>'Tis true my Father deals in Nets,</L>
<L>My Mother in long Laces.</L>
<L>But what of that, if Johnny's pleas'd,</L>
<L>'Twon't hinder our embraces.</L>
<L>For Johnny he does often swear,</L>
<L>He dearly loves his Sally.</L>
<L>And for the Neighbours I don't care,</L>
<L>We will live in our Alley.</L>
<L>It's true, when Johnny comes along,</L>
<L>And I by chance do meet him,</L>
<L>His Master comes out with a Stick,</L>
<L>And sorely he doth beat him,</L>
<L>Yet Johnny shall be made Amends,</L>
<L>When his Time's out, by Sally,</L>
<L>In spite of all the Rogues and Whores</L>
<L>That live in our Alley.</L>
<L>There is one Day in every Week</L>
<L>That Johnny does come to me.</L>
<L>And then I own I am well pleas'd,</L>
<L>When he doth kiss and wooe me.</L>
<L>Then in the Fields we walk and talk,</L>
<L>He calls me dearest Sally,</L>
<L>I love him, and I'll have him too,</L>
<L>In spite of all our Alley.</L>
<L>His Cheeks are of a Crimson Red,</L>
<L>Black Eye-brows he does carry.</L>
<L>His Temper is so sweet and good,</L>
<L>My Johnny I will marry.</L>
<L>Tho' all our Neigbours spite us sore,</L>
<L>Because Johnny loves his Sally.</L>
<L>But I love Johnny more and more.</L>
<L>And a Fig for all our Alley.</L>
<L>Old Woman grumble, and the Maids</L>
<L>Are all in Love with Johnny</L>
<L>Their Guts to Fiddle-strings may fret,</L>
<L>For he'll not leave his Honey.</L>
<L>At Midsummer his Time is out,</L>
<L>Then Hand-in-Hand will Sally</L>
<L>Unto the Parson with him go,</L>
<L>In spite of all our Alley.</L>
