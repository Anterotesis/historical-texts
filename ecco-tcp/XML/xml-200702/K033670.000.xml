<HEAD>THE JOURNEY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SOME of my <HI>Friends</HI> (for <HI>Friends</HI> I must suppose</L>
<L>All, who, not daring to appear my foes,</L>
<L>Feign great good will, and, not more full of spite</L>
<L>Than full of craft, under false colours fight)</L>
<L>Some of my <HI>Friends</HI> (so lavishly I print)</L>
<L>As more in sorrow than in anger, hint</L>
<L>(Tho' that indeed will scarce admit a doubt)</L>
<L>That I shall run my stock of Genius out,</L>
<L>My no great stock, and, publishing so fast,</L>
<L>Must needs become a Bankrupt at the last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>"The Husbandman, to spare a thankful soil,</L>
<L>"Which, rich in disposition, pays his toil</L>
<L>"More than a hundred fold, which swells his store</L>
<L>"E'en to his wish, and makes his barns run o'er,</L>
<L>"By long Experience taught, who teaches best,</L>
<L>"Foregoes his hopes awhile, and gives it rest.</L>
<L>"The Land, allow'd its losses to repair,</L>
<L>"Refresh'd, and full in strength, delights to wear</L>
<L>"A second Youth, and to the Farmer's eyes</L>
<L>"Bids richer crops, and double harvests rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Nor think this practice to the earth confin'd,</L>
<L>"It reaches to the culture of the Mind.</L>
<L>"The Mind of Man craves rest, and cannot bear,</L>
<L>"Tho' next in pow'r to Gods, continual care.</L>
<L>"Genius himself (nor here let Genius frown)</L>
<L>"Must, to ensure his vigour, be laid down,</L>
<L>"And fallow'd well; had CHURCHILL known but this,</L>
<L>"Which the most slight observer scarce could miss,</L>
<L>"He might have flourish'd twenty years, or more,</L>
<L>"Tho' now <HI>alas!</HI> poor Man! worn out in four.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Recover'd from the vanity of youth,</L>
<L>I feel, <HI>alas!</HI> this melancholly truth,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Thanks to each cordial, each advising Friend,</L>
<L>And am, if not too late, resolv'd to mend,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to give some respite to my pen,</L>
<L>Apply myself once more to Books, and Men,</L>
<L>View what is present, what is past review,</L>
<L>And my old stock exhausted lay in new.</L>
<L>For twice six moons (let winds, turn'd Porters, bear</L>
<L>This oath to Heav'n) for twice six moons I swear,</L>
<L>No Muse shall tempt me with her Siren lay,</L>
<L>Nor draw me from improvement's thorny way.</L>
<L>Verse I abjure, nor will forgive that Friend,</L>
<L>Who in my hearing shall a Rime commend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It cannot be—Whether I will, or no,</L>
<L>Such as they are, my thoughts in measure flow.</L>
<L>Convinc'd, determin'd, I in prose begin,</L>
<L>But e're I write one sentence, Verse creeps in,</L>
<L>And taints me thro' and thro'; by this good light</L>
<L>In Verse I talk by day, I dream by night;</L>
<L>If now and then I curse, my curses chime,</L>
<L>Nor can I pray, unless I pray in rime.</L>
<L>E'en now I err, in spite of Common Sense,</L>
<L>And my Confession doubles my offence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Rest then my <HI>Friends</HI>—spare, spare your precious breath,</L>
<L>And be your slumbers not less sound than death;</L>
<L>Perturbed Spirits rest, nor thus appear</L>
<L>To waste your counsels in a spendthrift's ear,</L>
<L>On your grave lessons I cannot subsist,</L>
<L>Nor e'en in verse become <HI>Oeconomist</HI>;</L>
<L>Rest then my <HI>Friends,</HI> nor, hateful to my eyes,</L>
<L>Let Envy, in the shape of Pity, rise</L>
<L>To blast me e'er my time; with patience wait,</L>
<L>('Tis no long interval) propitious Fate</L>
<L>Shall glut your pride, and ev'ry Son of phlegm</L>
<L>Find ample room to censure and condemn.</L>
<L>Read some three hundred lines, (no easy task;</L>
<L>But probably the last that I shall ask)</L>
<L>And give me up for ever; wait one hour,</L>
<L>Nay not so much, Revenge is in your pow'r,</L>
<L>And Ye may cry, e'er Time hath turn'd his glass,</L>
<L>Lo! what <HI>We</HI> prophecied is come to pass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Those, who Poetry in Poems claim,</L>
<L>Or not read this, or only read to blame;</L>
<L>Let Those, who are by fiction's charms enslav'd,</L>
<L>Return me thanks for half a crown well-sav'd;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Let Those, who love a little gall in rime,</L>
<L>Postpone their purchase now, and call next time;</L>
<L>Let Those, who, void of Nature, look for art,</L>
<L>Take up their money, and in peace depart;</L>
<L>Let Those, who energy of diction prize,</L>
<L>For BILLINGSGATE quit FLEXNEY, and be wise;</L>
<L>Here is no lie, no gall, no art, no force,</L>
<L>Mean are the words, and such as come of course,</L>
<L>The Subject not less simple than the lay;</L>
<L>A plain, unlabour'd journey of a Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far from Me now be ev'ry tuneful Maid,</L>
<L>I neither ask, nor can receive their aid.</L>
<L><HI>Pegasus</HI> turn'd into a common hack,</L>
<L>Alone I jog, and keep the beaten track,</L>
<L>Nor would I have the Sisters of the hill</L>
<L>Behold their Bard in such a Dishabille.</L>
<L>Absent, but only absent for a time,</L>
<L>Let Them caress some dearer son of Rime,</L>
<L>Let Them, as far as Decency permits,</L>
<L>Without suspicion, play the fool with Wits,</L>
<L>'Gainst Fools be guarded; 'tis a certain rule,</L>
<L>Wits are safe things, there's danger in a Fool.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>Let Them, tho' modest, GRAY more modest wooe;</L>
<L>Let Them with MASON bleat, and bray, and cooe;</L>
<L>Let Them with FRANKLIN, proud of some small Greek,</L>
<L>Make Sophocles, disguis'd, in English speak;</L>
<L>Let Them with GLOVER o'er Medea doze;</L>
<L>Let Them with DODSLEY wail Cleone's woes,</L>
<L>Whilst He, fine feeling creature, all in tears,</L>
<L>Melts as they melt, and weeps with weeping Peers;</L>
<L>Let Them with simple WHITEHEAD, taught to creep</L>
<L>Silent and soft, lay FONTENELLE asleep;</L>
<L>Let Them with BROWNE contrive, no vulgar trick,</L>
<L>To cure the dead, and make the living sick;</L>
<L>Let Them in Charity to MURPHY give</L>
<L>Some old French piece, that he may steal and live;</L>
<L>Let Them with <HI>antick</HI> FOOTE subscriptions get,</L>
<L>And advertise a Summer-house of Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, or in any better way They please,</L>
<L>With these great Men, or with great Men like these,</L>
<L>Let Them their appetite for laughter feed;</L>
<L>I on my Journey all Alone proceed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If fashionable grown, and fond of pow'r</L>
<L>With <HI>hum'rous</HI> SCOTS let Them disport their hour;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Let Them dance, fairy like, round OSSIAN's tomb;</L>
<L>Let Them forge <HI>lies,</HI> and <HI>histories</HI> for HUME;</L>
<L>Let Them with HOME, the very Prince of verse,</L>
<L>Make something like a Tragedy in <HI>Erse</HI>;</L>
<L>Under dark Allegory's flimsy veil</L>
<L>Let Them with OGILVIE spin out a tale</L>
<L>Of rueful length; Let Them plain things obscure,</L>
<L>Debase what's truly rich, and what is poor</L>
<L>Make poorer still by jargon most uncouth;</L>
<L>With ev'ry pert, prim Prettiness of Youth</L>
<L>Born of false Taste, with Fancy (like a Child</L>
<L>Not knowing what It cries for) running wild,</L>
<L>With bloated Stile, by Affectation taught,</L>
<L>With much false Colouring, and little Thought,</L>
<L>With Phrases strange, and Dialect decreed</L>
<L>By Reason never to have pass'd the <HI>Tweed,</HI></L>
<L>With Words, which Nature meant each other's foe,</L>
<L>Forc'd to compound whether they will or no,</L>
<L>With such materials, Let Them, if They will,</L>
<L>To prove at once their pleasantry and skill,</L>
<L>Build up a Bard to war 'gainst Common Sense,</L>
<L>By way of Compliment to Providence;</L>
<L>Let Them with ARMSTRONG, taking leave of Sense,</L>
<L>Read musty lectures on <HI>Benevolence,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Or conn the pages of his gaping <HI>Day,</HI></L>
<L>Where all his former Fame was thrown away,</L>
<L>Where all, but barren labour, was forgot,</L>
<L>And the vain stiffness of a <HI>Letter'd</HI> SCOT;</L>
<L>Let Them with ARMSTRONG pass the term of light,</L>
<L>But not one hour of darkness; when the Night</L>
<L>Suspends this mortal coil, when Mem'ry wakes,</L>
<L>When for our past misdoings Conscience takes</L>
<L>A deep revenge, when, by Reflexion led,</L>
<L>She draws his curtains, and looks comfort dead,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry Muse be gone; in vain He turns</L>
<L>And tries to pray for sleep; an Aetna burns,</L>
<L>A more than Aetna in his coward breast;</L>
<L>And Guilt, with vengeance arm'd, forbids him rest.</L>
<L>Tho' soft as Plumage from young Zephyr's wing,</L>
<L>His couch seems hard, and no relief can bring.</L>
<L>INGRATITUDE hath planted daggers there,</L>
<L>No Good Man can deserve, no brave Man bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, or in any better way They please,</L>
<L>With these great Men, or with great Men like these,</L>
<L>Let Them their appetite for laughter feed;</L>
<L>I on my Journey all Alone proceed.</L>
