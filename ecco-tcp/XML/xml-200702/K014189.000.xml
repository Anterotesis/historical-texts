<SPEAKER>TOBY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL,—of all the cross-grain'd old Fellows breathing, my Ma∣ster's Mistresses Father is one of the most hard to be dealt withal; and therefore 'tis for a Man of my Parts to suc∣ceed in an Assair that has baffled the Wit
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
of all my Fellow-Servants. I perswad∣ed him, before he try'd his own Skill, to make proof of mine, and I'll warrant I'll get the Letter to the Lady's Hands, if once I come near enough to touch 'em. I have a strange Inclination to Woman-Hunting ever since I clamber'd over the House-top, and got to Bed to <HI>Moll</HI> at the next Door, through the Garret-Window. Stay, this is the House; let me see, I think I am Woman enough in the low∣er Parts, and I am sure my upper won't fail me. I have Brass enough in my Face, and Depth enough in my Consci∣ence to be really what I look to be—an <HI>Exchange</HI> Girl, Ifakins, I'll knock, come on't what will; I am sure I am safe enough in this Dress, for tho' 'tis no new thing to find a Knave in Petticoats, 'tis an immodest and an unlawful thing to look for him there.</P>

<P>Rare Fortune, I faith! Well, I must needs say in my own Commendation, 'tis not every Body's Talent to manage a thing discreetly. What will this Master of mine owe me for so great a Service as I shall certainly do him? When a Man has good luck among Women, they say he was born under <HI>Caper-corn,</HI> I think they call it; and I shall go near to prove that <HI>Caper-corn</HI> my Master's best Planet. Adsme, I hear 'em opening the Door, now for it.</P>
<STAGE>The Door opens, and enter <HI>Sir Timothy</HI> with a great Blunderbuss, and two Ser∣vants with Guns and Buff Belts.</STAGE>

<P>Oh, dear Sir! what do you mean? I never did you any harm in my Life, Sir—Oh! oh! loving Sir, have Mercy upon me dear Sir, for the sake of my spotless Vir∣ginity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Faith, <HI>Toby,</HI> I pitty thee with all my Heart; but thou may'st make a mo∣ral use of this unlucky Accident, and learn to believe thy self no wiser than other People. Go, lay aside the Woman, and and take up the Statue; all things are now ready for the last Trial, and it shall be put in Execution this very Evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby,</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, if your Worship pleas∣es, I had rather be the Carver's Man, than the Statue; for if the old Knight shou'd find out a Trick, my Disguise wou'd be so heavy that I cou'd not run away, and he might chance to shoot me thro' the Head with his Blunderbuss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pish! Fool! you know he's so purblind he can scarce see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but if he can't see, he can feel tho'; and, Sir, if he should happen to tickle my Sides, I shou'd burst out a laughing, and discover all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's impossible he shou'd su∣spect thee. I saw the Statue at the Stone-Cutter's, who told me, the old Gentleman expects it to be brought home every day, My painted Canvas is exactly copied from the Original, and the Pedestal 'tis to be plac'd on in the Hall is so high, that he won't be able to reach your Sides; or if he did, the Daub is so hard and so thick, 'twou'd deceive a nicer Touch than his I'll warrant thee. But are the Fellows at hand, who are to be concern'd in the management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are all drinking at the next Ale-house, and the Gentleman who is to act the Statue instead of me, Sir, is a Man every Inch of him. He married a Wo∣man who had beat six Husbands to death with the But-ends of their own Muskets, and in three Nights time made the wild Beast so very tame, Sir, that she fawns upon him like a Spaniel Bitch when she's afraid of a Kicking.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I know your Name, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuttum.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am vulgarly known by the Name of Corporal <HI>Cuttum;</HI> I have been a Soldier from my Cradle, and a Cuckold from my Marriage-Bed, Sir: I have run thro' all the Mazes of Fortune, but cou'd ne'r lay hold of the Gypsie: I believe I'm too <HI>honest</HI> to be <HI>prosperous</HI> in this Age! and if I live much longer, I shall be too old to be <HI>knavish.</HI> I wou'd gladly make some use of my time, Sir; for I have late∣ly learn'd to remember, that I come of a Race so much the Reverse of my way of living hitherto, that egad—if I continue honest much longer, I shall be the only Fool of my Family!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Cuttum,</HI> what Coun∣try are you of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuttum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, to tell you the plain Truth, there is no Country will own us, and we own no Country; we should be <HI>French</HI> by our Air, and <HI>Spaniards</HI> by our steps, Sir; but a parcel of scoundrel Rogues about Town will needs have the <HI>Cuttums</HI> to be an <HI>Irish</HI> Family, sor no other Reason egad, than the reach of their assurance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no Friends in Town to apply to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, there's a Relation of mine generally known about Town; he's a kind of a Wit, and has writ Plays; but he has an odd Humour, that makes him incapa∣ble of serving a Kinsman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Humour is that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, he has been so fond of fathering Strangers Children, that he scarce knows how to look upon the Son of a poor Relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>Cuttum,</HI> you are a merry Fellow; you know the task and the reward design'd you, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>My worthy Friend, Mr. <HI>Toby</HI> here, has inform'd me at large; and I am ready to prove with how much Zeal I would un∣dertake an action of greater difficulty up∣on a less temptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you you have heard the utmost of your danger; come the worst to the worst 'tis but a beating, and that I presume you could bear with Resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I a <HI>Cuttum,</HI> and do you ask that Question? 'slife, Sir! bear a beat∣ing?—Why, there's not a Branch of our Family, but has Patience enough that way sor an informing Constable, Bailiff's follower, Female Tatler, or Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> egad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well; I think all things are now in a readiness, we'll go in, and about it presently. But heark'e, <HI>Toby,</HI> is your disguise come home yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four hours ago, Sir—But now you talk of a Disguise, am I to be a Jew, or a Gentile?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spright.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a Jew by all means. Come along Mr. Corporal; while you are getting
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
ready I'll instruct you what to say to the Lady, for the ill Success of my last Let∣ter forbids me all Thoughts of sending a∣nother.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Sbud, don't tell me of my Pro∣mise; ask any Statesman in Christendom, if Promises are Chains on a wise Man's Will. 'Tis true, I told the young Fool <HI>Sprightly</HI> he should have you, but that was when no Body of a better Estate was of his Mind, Girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ties of Duty, Sir, first led me to encourage Mr. <HI>Sprightly</HI>'s Addresses, in obedience to your Commands; and now the ties of Honour forbid me to wrong a Man who so sincerely loves me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I gave him my word, that if he could outwit me, he should keep what he got, with my good Will, and a good Fortune; but alas, poor young Fool, his Birdlime is no better than Chaff, and an old Fowl is too wise to be taken by it. I have defeated five or six of his Projects al∣ready; and if he comes within the reach of my Blunderbuss, have at him, by Sir <HI>Jeremy.</HI></P>

<P>I am glad he's gone, for my Heart ak'd plaguily when he came to pull my Leg off. 'Tis a lucky Mistake that he thinks <HI>To∣by</HI> struck him; but I'll take this Opportuni∣ty to speak to the Lady. Madam—Madam—</P>
<STAGE>He leaps down, and stalks towards <HI>Leon.</HI> who turns, and shrieks at his approaching her.</STAGE>

<P>Oh! Heav'ns, what's here! Ghosts! Spirits! Devils! ah! help! help! help!</P>

<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now we are all undone, and e∣gad! if you die a Maid, 'tis no more than you deserve for your damu'd unseasonable squeaking.</P>
<STAGE>He runs to the Table, and with much ado gets up, and stands in his old Posture; but for haste mistakes, and puts the wrong Leg forward.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah me! I see too late this is a Trick of <HI>Sprightly</HI>'s.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> and his Servants.</STAGE>
<P>Oh! Sir! I was half frighted, but beg your
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
pardon for alarming you; being in a me∣lancholy Humour, I had forgot the Statue stood upon the Table, and looking that way on the sudden took it for a naked Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! did you so, good Daugh∣ter! I see very well what you would be at; this Excess of your Folly betrays the Lewd∣ness of your Thoughts. Let's see, that Ras∣cal Jew beat off my Spectacles—oh! here they lie—Well, I vow this is a very cu∣rious piece of Sculpture, no real Flesh and Blood could appear more lively. If that Knave <HI>Chissel</HI> had not sent it by a Jew, I could have been extreamly pleas'd with it. <STAGE>He views <HI>Cuttum</HI> all round, who expresses a great deal of Fear.</STAGE> But stay, I forgot to look whether I have not-hurt the Leg tho'—adso! what's here? I am sure this Limb does not stand as it did just now. Daughter, Daughter. <HI>Leon.</HI> Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look here, is it the right Po∣sture or no?</P>
<STAGE>While Sir <HI>Tim.</HI> turns to speak to his Daughter, <HI>Cut.</HI> puts his Leg as it was before.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Sir? Yes, pray what ails it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ails it? 'Slife I am bewitch'd—I am sure the Devil's either in me, or my Spectacles; why 'twas but this moment the Leg stood here, and now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death, Sir, stand out of my way, or you're as dead as a door-nail. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE> 'Slife, I'll be gone while I may; if I stay a quarter of an hour longer, I shall be poun∣ded in a Mortar.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! is my House become an enchanted Castle? What a plague, I shall be hooted at as I walk along the streets if this Jest passes on me. Here follow me, ye Rascals, I'll statue the Dog, I'll warrant him.</P>
<STAGE>He runs out with his Servants after <HI>Cuttum.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a wretched Condition has my Folly brought me to? if I slip this Op∣portunity of escaping while the House is in so great a Confusion, I shall be miserable for ever. I'll get out the back-way, and trust for∣tune for the Event of my Undertaking.</P>
<STAGE>She goes out.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here have I crawl'd about this quarter of an hour, and can find no means to reach the Door, without being discover'd by some of the old Fellow's Maidenhead-watchers; and, if I stay here much longer, the danger will be equal. A Pox take Pet∣ticoats for <HI>Toby,</HI> if this be the Effect of fol∣lowing them. What shall I do?—let me think a little—adsbobs I have it, I have an old black Mask in my Pocket with Horns upon it, I'll tie it on, and creep down into yonder Well, it looks like a dry one; or if I am drown'd, 'tis a better Death than to be drubb'd to Destruction—I'll lie quietly all Night, and in the Morn∣ing bolt thro' the Door in my Vizor and black Wastcoat; it may so happen, that
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
the Rogues will take me for the Devil that they say walks in this Neighbour∣hood, and give me free Passage—But first, down Cloak, that if the Well be deeper than ordinary, I may be sure to fall softly; I'll tie on the Mask when I'm safe at the bottom. So now for it, Neck or nothing, as the Proverb says.</P>
<STAGE>He throws down his Cloak, and gets into the Well.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who would have thought that the four Rogues who brought in that Dog of a Statue, should have waited so cun∣ningly to carry him off again upon occa∣sion? Adzooks but we maul'd them in their Retreat. Go, ye Rogues, get ye in∣to the Cellar, and drink your selves drunk, as a Reward for your Valour. <STAGE>The Servants go out bowing.</STAGE> Well, after all, this <HI>Sprightly</HI> is a brave bold Fellow, and deserves the Baggage heartily; for I never could imagine till now, that a∣ny Woman in the World was worth a Man's venturing a knock on the Pate for. My Daughter is afraid of a Reprof, and is crept silently into her Closet. I'll not di∣sturb her till Morning, but go write an Account of this Nights Works to her good old Grandmother in the Country.</P>

<P>Well, I have better luck now I'm a Devil, than I had when I was a Woman; and some arch Wags would from thence take occasion to swear that the Devil is the least of the two Evils. But I have no time to be witty at present. I see the Street Door open, and will lay hold on the Op∣portunity.</P>
