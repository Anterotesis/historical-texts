<HEAD><HI>The Vision,</HI> A POEM. Being an ANSWER to the Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI>'s SPEECH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a Person of Quality.</BYLINE>
<L>COme hither ye Dreamers of Dreams,</L>
<L>Ye Soothsayers, Vizards and Witches,</L>
<L>That puzzle the World with hard Names,</L>
<L>And without any meaning make Speeches:</L>
<L>Here's a Lord in the North,</L>
<L>Near <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Frith;</L>
<L>Tho little has been said of his Name or his Worth;</L>
<L>He's seen such a Vision, no Mortal can reach it,</L>
<L>I challenge the Clan of <HI>Egyptians</HI> to match it.</L>
<L>And first, in the dark it was told him,</L>
<L>Which might very well appall us,</L>
<L>That the World was a fighting of old time,</L>
<L>From <HI>Nimrod</HI> to <HI>Sardanapalus</HI>;</L>
<L>That it's all Revelation,</L>
<L>You may pawn your Salvation,</L>
<L>For the Devil a History gives the relation,</L>
<L>But it's all in the Deeps, no Mortal can reach it,</L>
<L>We may challenge the Clan of <HI>Egyptians</HI> to match it,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2"/>Then <HI>Scotland</HI> comes next on the Stage,</L>
<L>For in Visions you must not be nice,</L>
<L>And a skip of three thousand Years age,</L>
<L>Is nothing where Men are Concise;</L>
<L>I name it the rather</L>
<L>Because you may gather,</L>
<L>How that every Man is the Son of his Father,</L>
<L>A Truth for the future no Mortal can doubt,</L>
<L>Whatever they might, before he found it out.</L>
<L>But heark, now the Wonders begin,</L>
<L>And take care least the Vision should fright ye;</L>
<L>For if it should make you unclean,</L>
<L>He has not told how he would dight ye.</L>
<L>First the National Church,</L>
<L>Left quite in the Lurch,</L>
<L>Was a truckling down to the Steeple and Porch,</L>
<L>But what is still worse, she's afraid of her Friends,</L>
<L>So Fevers make frantick Men-hasten their Ends.</L>
<L>Was ever such Conjuring known,</L>
<L>Or the Church so claw'd by the Steeple,</L>
<L>Non-jurors are her Champions grown,</L>
<L>And the Prelatists vote for the People.</L>
<L>Protesters appear</L>
<L>And the <HI>Jacques</HI> they adhere,</L>
<L>And Anti-christ votes the true Church to secure,</L>
<L>O <HI>Scotland!</HI> Was ever such Conjuring known,</L>
<L>That the Mitre supports the same Church pull'd her down.</L>
<L>Then the Nation in Sack-cloth appear'd,</L>
<L>And the Visionest sadly bewail'd her,</L>
<L>For Mischiefs the like were ne'er heard,</L>
<L>Her Priv'lege of Slavery fail'd her.</L>
<L>For the Mob he complain'd</L>
<L>That being born Chain'd,</L>
<L>Blest Bondage was lost, and damn'd Freedom remain'd,</L>
<L>So with Liberty scar'd, and afraid to grow Rich;</L>
<L>They su'd for Repentance in a dolorous Speech.</L>
<L>And first our Amazement 'll increase.</L>
<L>The Souldiers disbanded appear,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>Poor Drudges put Prentices to Peace,</L>
<L>For want of the Blessings of War;</L>
<L>For tho it's in the Book,</L>
<L>Yet the Scripture mistook,</L>
<L>When it told us, our Swords should to Plow-shares be broke:</L>
<L>It might be long ago a Happiness there,</L>
<L>But it's plain by the Vision it's otherwise here.</L>
<L>The Merchants are next on the Stage;</L>
<L>The Enchantment has circl'd them in;</L>
<L>For fear they in Wealth should engage,</L>
<L>They resolve they'll never begin</L>
<L>The Burghs are afraid</L>
<L>They shall have too much Trade,</L>
<L>And the Nation to Plenty be safely betray'd,</L>
<L>So they gravely Address, that to keep them secure,</L>
<L>As you find them, you leave them, both Foolish and Poor.</L>
<L>The next is indeed a sad Sight,</L>
<L>The like on't has rarely been known,</L>
<L>'Twill ruin the Country quite,</L>
<L>It will never recover its own;</L>
<L>The Plow Man's undone,</L>
<L>From Father to Son;</L>
<L>For a terrible draw-back on Corn will come on,</L>
<L>In plenty they'll Ship it, be there never so much;</L>
<L>And to load us with Money, sell all to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></L>
<L>O ye Virgins! (both Sexes) draw near,</L>
<L>And tho it's but in Spectrum showen,</L>
<L>In sympathy lend us a Tear,</L>
<L>As the Case may sometime be your own;</L>
<L>The Ladies Condition</L>
<L>Deserves your Compassion;</L>
<L>'Tis very severe to make Beauty petition:</L>
<L>Yet here his strange Tragedies turn'd to a Jigg,</L>
<L>That the Men want Employments, yet the Ladies shou'd Beg.</L>
<L>Then a Crew of old Sailers were brought,</L>
<L>At their true Benefactors to Rail;</L>
<L>Their Freight for strange Nations was bought,</L>
<L>And this will cut off the Entail;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>They thought it was hard</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships to discard,</L>
<L>And to force the poor <HI>Scots</HI> their own Trade to regard,</L>
<L>For Liberty claims a Freedom to ill,</L>
<L>And it's hard to get Money against a Man's Will</L>
<L>And now the Exorcist in turn</L>
<L>Like a Ghost in a Circle arises,</L>
<L>Without any Tears he can mourn.</L>
<L>He is Extasies all and Surprises.</L>
<L>But what's wildest of all,</L>
<L>And does strangely appall,</L>
<L>Two hours he talk'd, and said nothing at all:</L>
<L>But let drop a few hypocritical Tears,</L>
<L>So the Crocodale weeps on the Carcase she tears;</L>
<L>Then in strange Hebrew words he bewail'd ye,</L>
<L>Tho the Jest was by few understood,</L>
<L><HI>Tu quoque mi fili Squadrone,</HI></L>
<L>Or in Scots, <HI>the Parliament</HI>'s <HI>wood,</HI></L>
<L>So <HI>Coesar</HI> they say,</L>
<L>Cry'd out in a fray,</L>
<L>When they kill'd him, because he'd his Country betray,</L>
<L>For <HI>Brutus</HI> his Country's Liberty sought,</L>
<L>Was a Simily e're-soon happily brought?</L>
<L>Thus he rummag'd the Histories old,</L>
<L>Like the Tale of the Bear, and the Fiddle;</L>
<L>For as 'twas unluckily told,</L>
<L>So the Story broke off in the middle.</L>
<L>Some said my Lord cry'd,</L>
<L>Tho others deny'd;</L>
<L>Which Matter of Moment it's hard to decide,</L>
<L>But here's a more difficult Matter remains,</L>
<L>To tell if he shew'd us less Manners or Brains.</L>
