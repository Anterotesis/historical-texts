<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE LARK, while she her Gratitude to prove,</L>
<L>Lauds with her sprightly Notes, immortal <HI>Jov</HI></L>
<L>Shuts not his Ear against the SPARROWS Lays;</L>
<L>Whose tuneless Pipe can only chirp his Praise.</L>
<L>Thus I, tho' Learned Bards before have strung</L>
<L>Their sounding Lyres, and most divinely Sung,</L>
<L>Fear not the Dictates of my Soul to own;</L>
<L>The less of Art, the more of Love is shown:</L>
<L>Vouchsafe, Great Prince, to hear my humble Muse,</L>
<L>And let my Zeal my Want of Skill excuse.</L>

<L>HAIL! Hero born to rule, and reconcile</L>
<L>The fatal Discords of our <HI>English</HI> Isle!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Our pure <HI>Religion,</HI> long the Mark of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Repriev'd by YOU Escapes her final Doom.</L>
<L>Innumber'd Joys YOU to <HI>Britannia</HI> bring,</L>
<L>And <HI>lo Paeans</HI> thro' the Nation ring.</L>
<L>Delightful <HI>Liberty,</HI> with Fears half dead,</L>
<L>Hears the glad Noise, and rears her pleasing Head;</L>
<L>Her slacken'd Nerves their former Strength regain,</L>
<L>And she her Life redates from GEORGE's Reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO Cruel <HI>Faction</HI> tore <HI>Rome</HI>'s ancient State,</L>
<L>And all her Glories seem'd the Sport of Fate;</L>
<L>When by Adoption <HI>Trajan</HI> took the Reins,</L>
<L>And check'd his People's Heats, and quench'd the Flames;</L>
<L>Enlarg'd her Bounds to distant <HI>India</HI>'s Shoar,</L>
<L>And taught her Drooping Eagles how to soar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU Sir, like him, the <HI>British</HI> Throne ascend;</L>
<L>May equal Victories your Reign attend.</L>
<L>When round the Continent the Trump of Fame</L>
<L>Did <HI>Britain</HI>'s Glory in your Right proclaim,</L>
<L>Tyrannick Monarchs, as with Thunder scar'd,</L>
<L>Sent up their Prayers impending Fates to ward;</L>
<L>Whilst BELGIA's LION brav'd his threaten'd Chain,</L>
<L>Rowl'd his Glad Eyes, and stretch'd his Paws again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BY your fam'd Justice, and your prudent Sway,</L>
<L><HI>France</HI> shall be taught to Love, or to Obey;</L>

Whilst YOU the Right of Liberty assert,</L>
<L>And all the Ills of broken Faith avert;</L>
<L>To <HI>Barcelona</HI> may Your Succours fly,</L>

<L>PROPHETICK Sages had this Day in View,</L>
<L>And nam'd our PATRON as a Type of You:</L>
<L>So Men to Oracles had once Regard,</L>

<L>THE swelling Waves, which often heretofore</L>
<L>Our yet lov'd King, the Glorious <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> bore,</L>
<L>Proud in conveying his Adopted Son,</L>
<L>Part with Regret, and murmur as they run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WELLCOME great Guardian of our <HI>British</HI> Land;</L>
<L>Receive the Nation rescu'd by thy Hand.</L>
<L><HI>A wicked Race of Men,</HI> for private Ends,</L>
<L>Had rais'd her baffled Foes, and sunk her Friends,</L>
<L>Dispers'd her Strength, and Royal <HI>ANN</HI> betray'd</L>
<L>Whilst in the Sunshine of her Smiles they play'd;</L>
<L>The Ruin rowl'd too fast for her to stem,</L>
<L>Whose greatest Weakness was her Choice of <HI>Them:</HI></L>
<L>When Heav'n, in Pity to those suppliant Few,</L>
<L>Who own'd its Power, and kept their Vows to YOU,</L>
<L>Came to our Aid, revers'd our low'ring Fate,</L>
<L>And by thy destin'd ARM retriev'd the State.</L>

<L>HAIL great Deliverer, much lov'd MONARCH Hail!</L>
<L>No more shall <HI>France,</HI> no more shall <HI>Rome</HI> prevail:</L>
<L>By Heav'ns Decree, YOU and your Issue stand</L>
<L>Sure Signs of future Safety to this Land.</L>
<L>So when th' Almighty caus'd the Flouds to cease,</L>
<L>He fix'd his Bow in Token of the Peace.</L>
