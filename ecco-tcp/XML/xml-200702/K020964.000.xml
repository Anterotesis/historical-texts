<L>Contrive to practice 'gainst the life</L>
<L>Of One, who, honour'd thro' the land,</L>
<L>For Freedom made a glorious stand,</L>

<L>Who will, for him, may cant and whine,</L>
<L>And let weak Conscience with her line</L>
<L>Chalk out their ways; such starving rules</L>

<L>Such was our <HI>Lawyer</HI>; by his side</L>
<L>In all bad qualities allied,</L>

<L>By birth a Lord; O sacred word!</L>
<L>O word most sacred, whence Men get</L>
<L>A Privilege to run in debt,</L>
<L>Whence They at large exemption claim</L>

<L>He seems, which strangers well might swear,</L>

<L>The Captain of a Colliery.</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="45"/>Look at his visage, and agree</L>
<L>Half-hang'd he seems, just from the Tree</L>
<L>Escap'd; a Rope may sometimes break,</L>
<L>Or Men be cut down by mistake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He hath not Virtue (in the school</L>

<L>His life is a continued scene</L>
<L>Of all that's infamous and mean;</L>
<L>He knows not change, unless, grown nice</L>
<L>And delicate, from vice to vice;</L>
<L>Nature design'd him, in a rage,</L>
<L>To be the WHARTON of his age,</L>
<L>But, having given all the Sin,</L>
<L>Forgot to put the Virtues in.</L>
<L>To run a horse, to make a match,</L>
<L>To revel deep, to roar a catch,</L>
<L>To knock a tott'ring watchman down,</L>
<L>To sweat a woman of the Town,</L>
<L>By fits to keep the Peace, or break it,</L>
<L>In turn to give a Pox, or take it,</L>

<L>OBSCENITY herself was there;</L>

<L>Before the Season of his birth,</L>
<L>BLASPHEMY, making way and room,</L>
<L>Had mark'd him in his Mother's womb;</L>
<L>Too honest (for the worst of men</L>
<L>In forms are honest now and then)</L>
<L>Not to have, in the usual way,</L>
<L>His Bills sent in; Too great, to pay;</L>
<L>Too proud, to speak to, if he meets</L>
<L>The honest Tradesman whom he cheats;</L>
<L>Too infamous to have a friend,</L>
