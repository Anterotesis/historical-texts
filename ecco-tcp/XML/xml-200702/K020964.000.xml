<L>Who will, for him, may cant and whine,</L>

<L>Whence They at large exemption claim</L>

<L><PB N="44" REF="45"/>Look at his visage, and agree</L>

<L>He hath not Virtue (in the school</L>

<L>His life is a continued scene</L>
<L>Of all that's infamous and mean;</L>
<L>He knows not change, unless, grown nice</L>

<L>Nature design'd him, in a rage,</L>
<L>To be the WHARTON of his age,</L>
<L>But, having given all the Sin,</L>
<L>Forgot to put the Virtues in.</L>
<L>To run a horse, to make a match,</L>

<L>To sweat a woman of the Town,</L>

<L>OBSCENITY herself was there;</L>

<L>Too honest (for the worst of men</L>

<L>Too proud, to speak to, if he meets</L>
