<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the COURT of FRANCE, And of the CITY of PARIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was soon after the Treaty, with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> that I came to the <HI>French</HI> Court. The King found it convenient, to conclude a Peace with that Prince; thereby, to ease himself of so expensive and troublesome a War, as that had prov'd; which he had been obliged to maintain on that side. This great Monarch, who having once put an end to the Civil Wars, which were rais'd in his Kingdom, while he was under age, had been so successful in his Undertakings, that he was look'd on as a Prince whom Providence design'd to raise above all others: found himself on a sudden, in danger of being cast down, from his greatest height of Grandeur; all <HI>Europe</HI> being united against him; and King <HI>William,</HI> who is now in Possession of the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Throne of <HI>England,</HI> having been invited thither, by some of that Kingdom; to deliver them from the Apprehensions they were under, that their Religion, Laws and Privileges, were in danger, from the Measures taken by King <HI>James</HI> and his Mi∣nisters: engaged so many Princes in his Interests by his prudent Conduct, that in a short time, he form'd a very considerable League; and put himself at the Head of so many Forces, that he was in a Condition to put a stop, to his most Christian Majesty's formida∣ble Power; under which, every thing had bowed be∣fore. So that by a Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issitude, frequent enough in Governments, one descended of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> preserv'd the House of <HI>Austria</HI> from its utter Ruin: The beginnings of which were owing to his illustrious Predecessor. Yet nothing in all this War, created more trouble to the King, than the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s declaring against him. He had often endeavour'd to take him off from the Confederates, but could not prevail. The Mareshal <HI>de Catinat,</HI> who commanded his Majesty's Army in <HI>Italy;</HI> and who is as well qua∣lify'd, for Negociations of State, as for the Business of War, was more successful than others had been. He sent the Count <HI>de Tesse,</HI> Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, to <HI>Turin;</HI> with Instructions, sui∣table to those he had himself received from Court: and that he might be the better heard, his Majesty added so many Troops to his Army, under the Ma∣reshal's Command, that he made it much Superiour to the Duke of <HI>Savoy's.</HI> He had two Reasons for doing this; one was that thereby he might make the Duke sensible of the Mischiefs he was capable of doing him; and the other was, that he might not be afraid of the foreign Troops, which he had call'd to his Assi∣stance; who might have offer'd to prescribe to him, if they had been equal to the united Forces of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy.</HI> The advantageous Proposals, that were offer'd to the Duke, made him hearken to an Accom∣modation. By one of the Articles of this Treaty,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
the Princess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> was to be given in Marriage to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> so soon as she was full twelve years of Age: Until which time, she was to be edu∣cated in <HI>France;</HI> for as yet she wanted fifteen or six∣teen months of it. And the King engaged, to give two Dukes and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> to remain Hostages in <HI>Savoy,</HI> till the Marriage should be accomplish'd. The King made choice of the Dukes <HI>de Froix</HI> and <HI>de Choiseul</HI> to go there, as the two Hostages; and gave each of them 12000 Livers to defray the ex∣pence of their Journey. The Dutchess <HI>du Lude,</HI> was appointed Lady of Honour, to this Princess. The Dutchess <HI>d' Arpajou,</HI> expected to have had the Honour of this Charge, because she had it under the Dauphi∣ness: And she was so vexed at the Disappointment, that in a short time she fell into an Apoplexy; which oblig'd her to go to the Waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> though the Season in which they are usually taken, was al∣ready past: but it's now believ'd, they are good for that Disease at any time of the year; and therefore no regard is had to any particular Season. The King appointed also six <HI>Dames du palais,</HI> one of which was the Countess <HI>de Roucy,</HI> who is this Dutchess's Daughter; upon which account, it was thought, that the King's having neglected her self, would not affect her any more: But, as we always prefer our own Interests to that of others, she was much more sen∣sible, of the Affront, which she thought was put up∣on her self, than of the Honour, which was done to her Daughter. It's but of late, that the Dutchess <HI>du Lude,</HI> could reasonably hope, to have been so for∣tunate, for she was not much in Favour at Court, nor of the number of those Ladies, who are allow'd to go to <HI>Marli;</HI> and the first time she went there, it cost her 2000 Crowns to the Princess <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> who makes money of every thing, and who procur'd her that Favour. She had some Difficulty to furnish the Money, yet she has reason to be well-pleas'd, that she employ'd it that way; for she has thereby had
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Opportunities, to act her part so well, that she is got much into the King's Favour, and into the Favour of those, in whom he has the greatest Confidence. After she was nam'd to her Charge, she took Jour∣ney, very soon for <HI>Pout-Beauvoisin,</HI> which sepa∣rates <HI>France</HI> from the Dominions of <HI>Savoy;</HI> at which Place she was to receive the Princess of <HI>Sa∣voy.</HI> The Countess <HI>de Roucy</HI> went thither also, with the other five <HI>Dames du palais,</HI> whom the King had named. The Marquiss <HI>de Dangeau</HI> (who had better Fortune than the Dutchess <HI>d' Arpajou,</HI> for he was nam'd Gentleman of Honour to the young Princess, which was the very Charge, he had with the late Dauphiness) went also to meet her, with the other Officers of her Houshold, whom the King had nam'd. The Count <HI>de Tesse,</HI> who was made her first Master of Horse, as a Reward of the good Services he had done at the Treaty, would have much rather chosen to have been Gentleman of Honour. The King had some time before granted the Marquiss <HI>de Dangeau,</HI> the great Privilege, of the Order of St. <HI>Lazarus;</HI> which the Count <HI>de Tesse</HI> thought, was a sufficient Reward, and that nothing more was design'd for him, but he soon found his mistake: Yet he has no reason to complain of his own Fortune; for he is one of those, whom the Court has us'd with the great∣est Kindness; yea, I may add, that he is even over∣burthen'd with its Favours: for in a short space of time, he was made Governour of <HI>Ypres,</HI> Knight of the Holy Ghost, Collonel General of the Dragoons, Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, and first Gentleman of the Horse to the Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> This might seem strange, but that we often see when a Courtier has once got much into Favour, the King is so lavish in bestowing Honours and Preferments upon him, that one would think, he was to keep none in reserve for others.</P>
<P>Some days after this, the Princess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> took her Journey from <HI>Turin</HI> for <HI>Pont-Beauvoisin,</HI> where
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
her Lady of Honour, waited for her with the King's Coaches. They whom the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> sent along with her, to be her Convoy, took leave of her at that Place. And when she had come as far as <HI>Lions,</HI> the Dutchess <HI>du Lude,</HI> made her stay a while there, as well to refresh her after the Fatigue of her Journey, as to satisfie the Curiosity of the People, who were passionately desirous to see her: after which she set forward in her Journey for <HI>Fountain-bleau,</HI> where the Court was at that time. The King went as far as <HI>Montargis</HI> to meet her, for he knew what day she was to be there; the Dauphin went along with his Majesty, as did also the Duke and Dutchess of <HI>Or∣leans;</HI> and having lodg'd there that night, they came to <HI>Nemours</HI> next day to dinner, where the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> waited for them: They were then within four Leagues of <HI>Fountain-bleau,</HI> which they easily reach'd before night. The Princess was then but a very Child, yet the King was so taken with her, that he stay'd full four hours in Company with her at <HI>Montargis.</HI> The Duke and Dutchess of <HI>Savoy</HI> had taught her so well her Lesson, that she seem'd to have Wit and Sense much above her Age. The Court be∣gan now to consider, what Name or Title should be given her, whether they should call her Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> or Princess of <HI>Savoy;</HI> the King inclined to the first, though she was not to be married for some considerable time: His reason was, that that Title would give her the Precedency of all the Princesses of the Blood, without giving them any reason to com∣plain. But the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> requested the King, that she might retain her own Title, till she was married to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> He thought per∣haps thereby to find a Precedent for him and his Fa∣mily, henceforth to claim Precedency at the <HI>French</HI> Court; for he knew well enough, that whatever Ti∣tle they gave her, she should always take the door of all the Ladies about the Court: And, it seems, he knew, that when one of his Ancestors was in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and disputed for Place with <HI>Henry de Bourbon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> at the door of the King's Antichamber, the King took the Prince by the Hand, and made him enter first; and to mor∣tifie the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> yet farther, he told him, that he knew not what he meant, in offering to vie with a Prince who might one day be his Master.</P>
<P>However, the present Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> having re∣quested the King, that his Daughter's Title might be continued till the Marriage; the King held a Council with his Ministers, that he might know what was fittest to be done on that Occasion: They fell upon a middle-way, which was to call her nei∣ther Duthess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> nor Princess of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but only <HI>the Princess,</HI> without adding any more; and thus she was always called till the day of her Mar∣riage: In the mean time, it was ordered, that she should have the Precedency of all the Princesses of the Blood, as being the presumptive Wife of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The King caus'd her to be enter∣tain'd with Diversions suitable to her Age. And Mon∣sieur <HI>L' abbee de Choisi,</HI> finding it was become fashio∣nable, to be employ'd in something relating to the young Princess; thought, that he should make his Court wonderfully well, by writing a Narrative of every thing, that had befallen her since she parted from <HI>Tarin.</HI> When this Book came first abroad, some People got into an Humour, of commending it highly in all Companies, as the finest Piece that had appear'd of a long time: But if they had been ask'd, what they found in it that made them boast so much of it, they had been puzled to tell what it was. The more ingenuous and frank sort of People spake quite otherwise of it, and instead of calling it so fine a Piece, they own'd plainly, that it was good for no∣thing. Monsieur <HI>L' abbee,</HI> who sets up for an inge∣nious Writer, was extremely vex'd at this; but all those who are look'd upon as the best Judges, agree∣ing in the same Opinion; his Book was by common
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
consent, condemn'd for waste Paper, to be sent to the Grocers Shops.</P>
<P>Before I proceed farther, I beg leave, to make a short Digression concerning this Author; he lost once fifty <HI>Lowis d' ors,</HI> at Game with that handsom Lady Madam <HI>Fresnoi;</HI> and having no ready Money, she trusted him for some time, but at last sent to ask it of him; he sent her instead of her Money, a Copy of some Books he had written; telling her at the same time, that if she long'd for the Money, because with∣out it, she had not wherewith to divert her self, at Game, as she had told him, in her Note to him; she might divert her self with those Books, till such time as he could satisfie her with Money. The Lady look'd upon this as a new way of paying Debts; but it tempted her to write Books as well as others, that by her own Compositions, she might satisfie her Cre∣ditors, when they ask'd Money of her.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject. The Duke of <HI>Sa∣voy</HI> was not at all well pleas'd, that his Daughter had only the Title <HI>of Princess,</HI> without having that of <HI>Savoy</HI> added to it: But if he could not have his Ambition satisfy'd in this matter, he try'd to have it in another. He caus'd a <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription to be set up, importing that after he had enlarged the Bounds of his Dominions, and recover'd the Keys of <HI>Italy,</HI> he had shut up the Temple of <HI>Janus.</HI> It cannot be said, that there was any manifest Falshood in this Inscrip∣tion; yet it was somewhat odd, that he should boast of such mighty Wonders, and in so strange a manner too: For it was never heard before, that the losing of Battels, and a whole Province too, was the way for a Prince to enlarge his Dominions, or to reduce his Enemy to Reason. The Inscription was put above a triumphal Arch, which was erected at <HI>Tarin,</HI> to set off a Fire-work that was raised there, to testifie the Joy of that Place for the Peace: And it was all he could boast of from the beginning of the War; since he had lost not only his Dutchy, but the Battels of
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<HI>Staffard</HI> and <HI>Marsaille</HI> into the bargain. Yet the great Number of Enemies, which <HI>France</HI> had at that time, made his Majesty reckon, that he should be a considerable Gainer, though he should deliver up <HI>Savoy</HI> to him, and even the Town and Citadel of <HI>Pignerol,</HI> which were taken by Cardinal <HI>Richeleu</HI> in Person, if by that Means he could oblige him to a Peace. By this Treaty, the Duke was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut into as good Circumstances, as if he himself had gain'd those Battels, and conquer'd a great Province.</P>
<P>The Duke having had the Pleasure to see two Dukes and Peers of <HI>France</HI> at his Court, resolv'd to revenge himself, and all the Princes of his Blood, of the Affront which <HI>Henry</HI> IV. put upon their Ancestor; and as that great King, had carrv'd it so high in his own House, as to make a Prince of his own Blood, take place of a Duke of <HI>Savoy:</HI> So the present Duke would needs carry it so high at his Court, as to make the Prince <HI>de Carignan</HI> (who is of his Fa∣mily, and elder Brother to the Count <HI>de Soissons</HI>) take place of the two <HI>French</HI> Dukes, when they came to pay him a Visit at his House. Had the King's great Master of Horse been there, to see a Prince triumph over these two Dukes, he had thought himself sufficiently reveng'd of them; for they were so far from yielding him the place in his own House, that they disputed it with him wheresoever they met him. Perhaps he will not soon forget a Debate he had on this Score, with the Duke <HI>de Montausier;</HI> who having told him, that he never thought, nor was it ever heard, that a younger Brother, of the Fa∣mily of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> would vie for Precedency with a Prince of a Sovereign House: The Duke <HI>de Montau∣sier</HI> answer'd him saucily, that he would let him know, that both as a younger Brother of the Fami∣ly of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> and as Duke and Peer of <HI>France,</HI> he would dispute the Precedency with him where ever they should meet. But though perhaps this Duke may have been much in the right upon the one Score,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
yet certainly he was not so upon the other; for a younger Brother, of the Family of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> or of any other House, can never be suppos'd equal to the Son of a Sovereign Prince. And, perhaps, he had not spoke after that manner, but that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was, at that time, dispossed of his Domi∣nions; so that he look'd upon the Princes of that House, but as younger Brothers of a good Family. And it was, no doubt, for this very reason, that much about the same time, the Count <HI>de Cre∣qui Berniulle,</HI> enter'd into a Debate with the late Count <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> younger Brother to the Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf,</HI> for he treated him just as if he had been his Equal; and was so very haughty, that when the Mareshals of <HI>France</HI> (before whom both of them were oblig'd to appear, to give account of their Quarrel) made some Distinction between them, and order'd him to go to the Prince's House, and there to beg Pardon for what had pass'd, his Behaviour to him was the same as before. It's true, he went to <HI>Harcourt,</HI> where the Prince dwelt at that time; but he caus'd drive his Coach to the very door of the Parlour, where the Mareshals of <HI>France</HI> had appointed the Count <HI>d' Harcourt</HI> to receive him: He found him there, with some Gentlemen of their Neighbourhood, for they themselves were near Neigh∣bours. The Prince had caused Chairs to be set for them, and had also reserv'd one for the Count <HI>de Crequi,</HI> while he himself design'd to sit in an El∣bow-chair: But so soon as the Count <HI>de Crequi</HI> (who was always of a great Presence of Mind) perceiv'd, that by this means, he intended to let him under∣stand the Difference between a Prince of a sove∣reign House, and a Gentleman of a good Family; he skilfully warded off the blow; for after he had made those Compliments to the Prince, which the Mare∣shals of <HI>France</HI> order'd him to do, he went to the Chair that was reserv'd for him; but instead of sit∣ting down in it, he put one knee upon the Seat of
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
it, and took hold of the back of it with his Hands: The Count <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> who had Orders prescrib'd him by the Mareshals of <HI>France,</HI> how to behave him∣self on that Occasion, as well as he; and who was obliged not to sit while he was standing, told him, that it would be more for his Conveniency to sit down in the Chair, and that at least, the Gentlemen who were there present, would take their Seats if he had once taken his: The Count <HI>d' Crequi</HI> answer'd him, that there was no need of Ceremonies among Neighbours as they were, and that he might sit down if he pleas'd; but as for himself, he was well enough as he was: With these words, he ended his Visit; and without giving the Prince time to make use of his Elbow-chair, took leave of him. The Prince was obliged to wait on him to the door of the Parlour; and the Distinction which he design'd to have made between them, turn'd more to his Shame than to his Honour. And he himself said plainly to one of the Gentlemen that was at his House, and in whom he put Confidence, that in his life-time, there was never any thing so mortified him, as the Count <HI>de Crequi</HI>'s Behaviour to him that day. The Mortification, no doubt, was great enough; but he met with one incomparably greater, (if he was sen∣sible of it) when the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> cudgell'd him at <HI>Luxenburg.</HI> This Treatment lets us see, that every Man is Master in his own House; and that there is a great Difference between a Prince of the Blood, and any other Prince in <HI>France,</HI> though of a Sovereign House. However, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s great Haughtiness was brought low soon after; I mean, when he went out of <HI>France,</HI> and betook him∣self to the Protection of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and took part with them, to the manifest Violation of that Allegiance which he ow'd his own Sovereign. I admire that we have not a full Account of all this, in the History that is written of his Life. It is well enough known, that so soon as he was at <HI>Namur,</HI> he found Reason to re∣pent,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
that ever he had left his native Country. The Author of that History, methinks, should have told us all the Journeys he made from that Town to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and from <HI>Brussels</HI> to <HI>Namur;</HI> endeavouring to adjust the Difference about Precedency with the Archduke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who pretended to take place of him: He should have told us also, all that happen'd in a Debate of the like nature, between his most se∣rene Highness, and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> If it had been Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s good Pleasure to have made use of this Juncture, to persuade the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> to return, he could have easily prevail'd; for he was almost mad, at the Treatment he met with: But that Minister, who thought it a piece of the best Policy he could contrive, to oblige him to quit <HI>France,</HI> was far from wishing his return thither. These, and a thousand other curious Things, which are wholly left out, deserv'd a place, in the History of that Prince's Life; and it would have been much more becoming an Historian, to have publish'd them, than to have entertain'd us, with so many Trifles and false Sto∣ries.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Author did not well know the Hi∣story of that Prince's Life; and he is so ingenuous, as to tell us so much, in the beginning of his Book; but since he acknowledged, that he was unable for such a Performance, why did he undertake it? There is no∣thing, in my Opinion, more inexcusable in an Author, than to confess his own Ignorance; for since he ac∣knowledges his own Failings, why does he venture to write Books? A pretty Idea indeed, he gives us of his Works! Were it not a thousand times better, he should say nothing of them? And may he not reasonably ex∣pect the common Fate of all such Authors; that is, to make himself contemptible, as they always do? When an Author is so silly, as to condemn himself, he must not expect afterwards, that others will deal more gently by him, than he has done by himself.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
But to return to my Subject. The Prince <HI>de Ca∣rignan</HI> having (as I have just now said) reveng'd his own Family and that of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of the Affronts that had been put upon them; there were many Dukes and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> who found their own Honour concern'd in the Treatment, which the Dukes of <HI>Froix</HI> and <HI>Choyseul</HI> had met with; and therefore they consulted together at private meetings, if they should complain to his Majesty of these two Dukes, for having disgrac'd their Character, in bearing with a thing so un∣worthy of their Rank: But the wisest of them, did not think fit to do it; for they thought it more than probable, that before they went from <HI>Versailles,</HI> they had Instructions given them in Writing, how to be∣have themselves at <HI>Turin;</HI> and therefore they could not hope for Redress, though they should make their Complaint. In the mean time, the more Reasons the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had to be well satisfied, the more did he caress the two Dukes; his very being an <HI>Ita∣lian,</HI> makes him dissemble naturally. The only thing he had to wish for, to make him compleatly satisfy'd, was, that <HI>Monsieur Louvois</HI> had been still alive; that he might have seen, with what Art and Skill he could revenge himself of Injuries that were done him; for as it was he, who had first provok'd him to engage in a War against the King, by the Slights he had gi∣ven him upon many Occasions: He would, no doubt, have been exceedingly pleas'd, could he but have ask'd him, what was now become of all that Haugh∣tiness and Contempt, with which he treated all the Sovereign Princes, whose Power was inferiour to his Majesty's.</P>
<P>This Prince having dealt after this manner by the two Hostages, and having nothing else that could vex them; thought it convenient to send them back to <HI>France,</HI> without waiting till his Daughter's Marriage should be accomplish'd. The pretence he used was, that he had so much Confidence in his Majesty, that he did not desire any other Security but his Word:
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
He said also to the two Dukes, that it was only for form sake, that ever he had ask'd Hostages of the King; and that he was now glad of the Opportunity he had, to let all <HI>Europe</HI> see, that he did not in the least doubt, but that his Majesty would faithfully perform every thing he had promis'd; that therefore they might return into <HI>France</HI> as soon as they pleas'd: yet they would not adventure to do this till they should receive his Majesty's Orders.</P>
<P>The King has also learn'd to dissemble, not only from the Lessons that Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> taught him, but also by long Experience in Government, and in the Exercise of a Sovereign Power; which has taught him, that the Art of dissembling is one of the most necessary Qualifications for a King: He first assured the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> of his Thankfulness for his Gene∣rosity, and then he order'd the two Dukes to return to <HI>France.</HI> At the same time, his Majesty sent an Ambassador into that Country; it was the Count <HI>de Briord,</HI> who belong'd to the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> with∣out whose Knowledge he had made an Interest for that Employment; for which his Highness was high∣ly offended at him, but dar'd not shew his Resent∣ments, for fear of a Reprimand from the King.</P>
<P>The Feast of Christmass was now at hand, and the Dutchess <HI>du Lude</HI> caused a little <HI>Jesus</HI> to be made, for a Present to the young Princess, after the custom of <HI>Italy.</HI> She found it upon her Toilet at her Levee; and the Case into which it was put, being of most ex∣quisite and curious Work, with panes of Chrystal, she was altogether charmed with it. But upon New∣years Day the King made her a much more magnifi∣cent Present; for he gave her an Apron with Jewels to the value of an Hundred thousand Franks in it. The Dauphin gave her another, which had cost him Forty thousand Franks: and these two New-years Gifts were accompanied with a third Present from the King, of all the Jewels that had ever belong'd to his own Queen, and to the late Dauphiness. The
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Count <HI>de Thoulouse,</HI> after the King's Example, gave so magnificent New-years Gifts, that they seem'd too great by much, for a private Person. No doubt, but what he did, was by the King's Allowance; and that even his Majesty advised him to it. But whatever was in that, it was to the Marquis <HI>d' Antin</HI> (who is his Brother by the Mother's side) that he made those rich Presents; and the whole Business was manag'd thus: The Marquiss <HI>d' Antin</HI> being gone to dine with his Brother in Law the Marquis <HI>de Barbesieux,</HI> he found under his Mapkin a Billet which was folded; he knew not what was the Import of it; and the Marquis <HI>de Barbesieux</HI> (who probably had put it there by his Majesty's Order) having forbidden him to blus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Lady should not know of it; he told him also, that all the Company would allow him to read it, and that they would refer it to his own Dis∣cretion, whether he would tell them what was in it or not; for they would not at all vex him. The Marquis <HI>d' Antin</HI> arose from the Table, and went to the Window to read it. He found, that in∣stead of coming from a Lady, as he at first had ima∣gin'd, it was come from the Count <HI>de Thoulouse,</HI> who took the Liberty to call him a big hoggish Fellow, for he look'd like one that had got enough of Food in his time: But he had no Reason to complain of this Freedom, since as the Contents of the Billet made him see clearly, that it proceeded from true Friendship: For the Count told him, that two years ago, he had re∣solved to give him a Pension of Ten thousand Livres a year; and that as it was but just he should have the Benefit of it from that time; so now he gave him notice, that he had not only settled it on him for the time coming, but had also order'd his Treasurer immediately to pay him 20000 Livers for the two past years. The Marquis <HI>d' Antin,</HI> being come back to the Table, told the Company, that they were not much mistaken, if they thought that this was a Bil∣let <HI>doux,</HI> that at least he himself took it for one;
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and he was sure he was in the right of it; and for that he would appeal to the Judgment of those present. He then told them the Contents of it; and so soon as they had heard them, they all own'd, that it was incomparably better than any Billet that could come even from the handsomest Lady. They had all the Reason in the World to think so, since 10000 Livers a year, and 20000 of ready Money is well worth any Mistress; especi∣ally now adays, when the World is so chang'd, that whereas formerly the Men sought after the Ladies, these do now seek after the Men; and almost all of them are become effronted to the highest Degree; and carry on their Debauchery so far, that many of them fuddle as if they were to gain no small Ho∣nour and Reputation by it: and since the Cordial Liquors came in Fashion, they make use of that Pre∣tence, to drink of every thing that pleases their Pal∣late, not excepting even Drandy it self, which they drink as if it were sweet Water; by which we may guess how well they relish other Liquors: and seeing their Tast is so viciated, that they love even that which Porters themselves detested not many years ago; it is not very probable, that they'll be at much Pains to re∣sist those Temptations, that procure those Pleasures, which are much more natural than the other; and which (in the Opinion of some People) are not al∣together so unworthy of the Female Sex. And the Truth is, the Ladies are generally sensible enough of this, and are become so impudent in those lewd Pra∣ctices, that one, whom I know very well, and who is none of the least considerable about the Court, know∣ing some time ago that her Gallant was to be mar∣ried, besought him to call at her House as he return'd from Church. It was the Niece of this <HI>Messalina</HI> whom he married; and the Niece's Modesty is as great as the Aunts Impudence: However, her Gal∣lant not being able to refuse her Desire, was no sooner in her Chamber, but she ask'd another Favour of
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
him, which was, that he would pass that day a bed with her; that at night her Niece might have nothing but what she had left. The Bridegroom stood in great need of Money, and knowing that she rewarded liberally, granted her Request; while the Friends, who were invited to the Marriage, were searching throughout all the parts of the Neighbourhood to know what was become of him. Yet this is not the only Court Lady of this Stamp. But every one of them were lash'd and expos'd sufficiently, in some Carols and Lampoons that were compos'd and pub∣lish'd soon after the Princess came to <HI>France.</HI> There we had the true and genuine History of every one of them, without the least Disguise. 'Tis true, it is not well done to discover to the World the Faults of other People; yet the exposing of them thus, was useful to persuade many of them to reflect upon their own Conduct, and to be more circumspect in time coming. But the worst thing of those Carols was, that they were so full of gross Immoralities, that ma∣ny who had but a small share of Religion detested them. The King (who was never of an Humour to bear with things of that nature, and less now than ever, that he is become devout in good earnest) made a deal of noise about them; and said openly before all the Court, that he had one good Counsel to give the Author of them, which was, that he would make his Escape in time, thereby to prevent the Punishments which he must inevitably undergo, if ever he come to be discover'd: If the Author had follow'd this Counsel, it had been the same thing as to have ac∣cus'd himself; and therefore, whoever he was, he put as good a Face on it, as they could do who were sensible of their own Innocence. There is not the least doubt but that he belongs to the Court, and that he is one of those who are best acquainted with it; for no body else could know so well, the History of every one's Life as that Author did; though after all he was mistaken in some things: However, after
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
many had been suspected, and among the rest, a Lady of very great Quality, because her Genius bends a little that way; it came at last to be generally belie∣ved, that the Chevalier de <HI>Bouillon</HI> was the man, but because there was no certain Proof of it, and that all that was said, was founded only on suspicion, he got no harm by it. The King was not satisfied that he had signified his displeasure against this Au∣thor, who had thus signalized himself for an impious Wretch, and perhaps for a Lyar too; (for it is not probable, that all the nasty things that are in those Carolls, can be litterally true) but his Majesty made it known also, that he would not take it well, if any body should sing them. But as there are some things above the Power of Kings, how great soever their Authority may be: So this Order took not much effect: every body sung them as before, except that they were cautious not to do it, in the hearing of those, who they thought would give an Account of it to his Majesty. For we must understand, that there are abundance of spies about the Court; and though some of them are known, as the Marquis <HI>de Termes,</HI> and some others, yet there are of them who act their parts so cunningly, that there is nothing they are less sus∣pected of, than of being what they truly are.</P>
<P>It was not only in these Carolls and Songs, that the Conduct of the Ladies was publickly censur'd: a cer∣tain Person, who is well known in the World, for an Im∣ployment of a quite other kind, than what he is natu∣rally fitted for, resolv'd to censure them also, in the same manner that he has for a long time, censur'd all man∣kind. As he sets up for a Jester and maker of Ballads, he made some upon the Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rements, which the Ladies now make use of, that they may be ready for an Engagement; he brought them forth in slippers, and quilted Wastcoats; ready to enter the Lifts: and though he nam'd no body, yet, as they who censure others, must not expect many thanks, especially when vicious customs are laid so deep, that it s next to im∣possible
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
to root them out, so his performances were so unacceptable, that as a Reward of his pains, he was soon born down and oppressed with a World of Cen∣sures and Reproaches. And that much after the same manner, that he had reproached others; that is, by Ballads and Lampoons: but with this difference, that whereas, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se which he had compos'd, he had been so civil, as not to name any body; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et they dealt so rudely by him, as to name him expresly; and, which was harder upon him, that they might cha∣stize him yet farther, they sent Copies of their Lam∣poons to his three Best Friends, the Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Chawnes,</HI> and the Marchioness <HI>de Louvois;</HI> whose houses he frequented daily, and who could not easily be without him. They were not well pleas'd, that others should be so unjust, as to calumniate him, who had never calumniated any person, because, as they said he had not nam'd any, in the Songs which he had made: Yet they cannot say, but that since the time, that from being Master of Requests, he had dwindl'd into a Poet of the <HI>Pont∣neuf;</HI> he has fallen foul upon several Persons of Quality, without being so circumspect; and there∣fore he must not expect, that all the World will be so favourable to him, as was the Cardinal and his other Friends. And as there was no great injustice in finding fault with what he had done, as to the Ladies; so, many others as well as he were of opi∣nion, that they had even done best, to have laid by their sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppers and Wastcoats. The thrust he gave in, being thus smartly pareed, and return'd upon him∣self, the poor Fellow was forc'd to shut himself up in his little Closet, without daring to peep abroad for some days. But as every man returns soon to his natural Temper, and as the Ladies too did not fail to provoke him anew, not to spare them, as hitherto he had done; we have since had a thou∣sand Ballads of his making, where he represents them prettily enough.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
If Lewdness was so ordinary at this time among the Women, it was not much less so, among the Men; but especially they were taken, with a very Frenzy and Madness, for which they could make no Apology; for besides the Vice of excessive drink∣ing, which many of them were addicted to, rather thro' bad custom, than by natural inclination; they had got into an humour of preferring the Women Play∣ers of the Playhouse, and the Opera, to their own Wives, though never so handsome; and their Hus∣bands were much to blame for it, if they were not modest and circumspect. And thus for the leavings of a great many other People, they forsook their own Wives, whom they might have enjoy'd all alone; yea, and provoked them too, to become common. For nothing more provokes a Wife to be unfaithful to her Husband, than when he slights her, and prefers other Women to her.</P>
<P>The Lords of the greatest Quality, were not more exempted from this vice, than were others; though they be more obliged than other People, to give good Example, for the higher and greater a Man's Station and Character is, the more is his behaviour exposed to the view of the publick.</P>
<P>There was one of them among the rest, who fell in Love with a Woman of the Opera, which very much vexed his Friends and Relations; but there was one thing encouraged him in his amours, and serv'd to harden him in his shameful and lewd Practi∣ces, and that was, that many of the most topping Ladies about the Court, went a purpose to the Opera, that they might see his Mistress, and speak highly to her advantage; for those who enter once into a vi∣cious way of living, can applaud Vice, with as little remorse, as others applaud Virtue. Those who were concern'd in this Nobleman, had perceiv'd sometime before, that it was necessary to observe his conduct narrowly: and therefore they put a wise and sober Man to attend him, who might give them an account
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
of his Behaviour. But as youth has an aversion to People of this sort, and usually considers them, as Pedagogues, whom they cannot bear with; so this young Lord endeavour'd, so soon as he could, to free himself of the bonds, which his friends had put upon him. All the young Gentlemen who made their court to him, confirm'd him as much as they could, in <HI>His Resolution;</HI> and they call'd his Observer by the name of <HI>Caius Garrulus,</HI> which sounded not unlike his own name, and they added an Epithite to it, which was somewhat suitable to his Employment. This young Gallant's Father, was extreamly concern'd, when he knew that his Son was so fond of this Actress: He spoke to him of it, as a thing which would ruin his Reputation. And at length he spoke to him, not only as from himself, but as from the King, to whom he knew that he pay'd very much Deference. And that his Counsels might make the greater impression upon his Son's mind, he told him, that they who were fond of that sort of People, met often with sad mis∣fortunes; and that his Rank and Quality did not at all secure him against the treachery of a <HI>Coquette,</HI> and that if he must have a Mistress, he should at least look for one, with whom he could live with greater safety than he could do with her. Notwithstanding all the Deference he had for the King, and the Du∣ty he ow'd to his Father, he made no other Answer, but that he would do all that was in his power, to satisfie both of them, but that he found so strong an inclination for that Woman, that he knew not if it was in his power to disengage himself altogether from her, on a sudden. He continued (notwithstanding all this) to visit her, and having told her every word his Father had spoke to him, they agreed that he should not pay her a visit for some days. <HI>Caius Garrulus</HI> advertised the young Gallants Friends of the visit he had paid, maugre all his Fathers Remonstrances to the contrary; upon which account, his Father spoke once more to him, and told him, that he must be
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
very incorrigible, in that he had so soon forgot what he had said to him formerly; and that being of so high a birth, as he was he ought at least to have delay'd that visit, for some days, thereby to give some proof of his obedience. He took him to task so seriously, as that the young Beau might have been perswaded, to re∣flect as seriously upon his own behaviour: He could not deny, but that he had paid her a visit, but the answer he gave, was, that with all due regard, to the Deference he ow'd him, he thought that he had no just ground to reprove him; That Civility, and good Manners, had obliged him to go and tell her, that he was peremptorily discharg'd to have any more Correspondence with her, and that having once had a kindness for her, he could do no less; for she might have been justly enrag'd against him, had he cast her off, without telling her why. That in the mean time, notwithstanding the great desire he had, to give him full satisfaction in that matter, yet he could not but own, that at the last visit, he had found her more charming than ever; that it troubled him much when he reflected upon his own weakness, but that all he could do in obedience to his Commands, was, to pray to God, for Strength and Resolution to obey them. His Father understood well enough, the meaning of all this, and conceiving no great hopes of him, he left him, being much out of humour, at his answer. It was two or three days before the Son paid another visit to his Mistress, yet he sent Letters to her every hour, and gave her notice, that next day, his Father was to give a splendid Ball, and that she must not fail to be there; but that she should come disguised in such and such a manner, that he might know her by her Garb. This Ball was the finest that had been seen of a long time, and all the Court was pre∣sent at it, but this young Lord could not as yet see his Mistress there, which put him out of humour, at a Lady, who would fain have had the same Interest in his affection, that the Actress had, and flattered her
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
self, with hopes, that if she was successful, his Father and his other Friends, would not find so much fault with it: She began to rally him for being out of Hu∣mour, that she might thereby find a way, to bring about her own purposes, but he was not at leisure to give her an answer, for he saw his Mistress come into the Ball that very moment. She was disguised in Man's dress, and he went immediately, and spoke to a young Princess, who was often engag'd in the Dance, that with the first opportunity she would please to take out the young Spark, who was in such and such a dress, pointing to his Mistress. She promis'd to do it, and was as good as her word. <HI>Caius Garrulus,</HI> who had always an eye upon him, having observ'd, that he look'd much to that side, where the new Masker was, and that immediately af∣ter he had spoken to that Princess, he began to suspect what it was he had said to her, yet he would let no body know his Jealousie, till he should be fully assured that he was in the right. And observing this new Masker very narrowly, the more he viewed him, the more was he perswaded that it was his Master's Mistress. By this time there was one came and took out the young Princess to dance, and immediately after, she took out this new Masker, which let <HI>Caius Garrulus</HI> clearly see that he was not mistaken, for he knew so well by her dancing, that it was she, whom he suspect∣ed, that tho' he had not had any other presumptions, that alone was sufficient to confirm him in his suspici∣ons. This Masker, who was truly the young Lord's Mis∣tress, after she had danced with the young Princess, was so affronted as to take out her Gallants Lady to dance with her. <HI>Caius Garrulus</HI> could bear no longer with her Impudence, but went and told his Masters Fa∣ther, who it was that had taken out his daughter in Law to dance: He had a good mind at first to have caus'd to throw her over the Window, and so had the young Lords Mother. But when they had reriected, that that would make too much noise, both
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
of them resolved to try calmer methods, for break∣ing off this correspondence: they caused to inform him, that she was false to him, and that others conversed familiarly with her; and unless he would give up converse with her, it was not safe for his own Lady to bed with him. But though they endeavoured under hand, to raise all the jealousies imaginable, in his mind, yet he would believe no∣thing. After these endeavours, his Father was af∣fraid, lest what he would have had his Son to believe, should prove true in good earnest; and therefore he appointed a Woman, to attend his Sons Mistress; and to observe her so narrowly, that it should not be in her power to prove false to his Son.</P>
<P>This young Lord was not the only Person, who was fond of the Women of Opera and Playhouse, con∣trary to the duty he ow'd both to himself, and to his Lady; there were many others who after his Exam∣ple, did the same thing; and but too many who had done it before him.</P>
<P>But among all those, whose inconsiderateness is the most astonishing, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is not one more inexcusable, than a certain Duke, who was old enough, to have given greater Proofs of his prudence; besides that he had married a young Princess, of incomparable Beauty, and who deserv'd beyond all comparison, to have been more esteemed, than all the Mistresses, he could find among that sort of Women. But no consideration would prevail with him, against lewd∣ness, and he was not only unfaithful to her, but left her for good and all, and went to keep House with his new Mistress: Before this happened, his Father, who was one of the greatest and richest Lords about the Court; had carried his Son's Lady, to his own Seat, in the Countrey, while her Hus∣band was in the Army. Her Mother who lov'd her most tenderly, was loath to part with her, and had much rather she had stay'd with her, but could not
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
obtain it; Yet her Daughter wrote to her soon after, and besought her to imploy all her interest with the King; that he would please to give orders that she should return, for she was not at all safe, with her Father in Law who had spoken to her of Amours, not∣withstanding her relation to him; and that he had spoken so very earnestly, that no time must be lost; if she had any concern for her honour, and the peace of her mind. It is not certain if all this was literally true, or if it was only concerted, between the Mo∣ther and the Daughter, to get her brought out of that Countrey, where her Father in Law dwelt, and of which she was wearied, that she might live with her Mother, who longed so much for her company. Whatever was in this, the Lady having spoke of it to his Majesty, obtained an order to the Dukes Fa∣ther, to send his Daughter in Law back to <HI>Paris.</HI> He was enraged against both of them, for the af∣front which they had put upon him; and therefore though he ought to have been the first, who should have reproved his Son for conversing with his new Mistress, which now began to appear; yet he was at no great pains, to disswade him from it; he al∣ledg'd they had served him a very Scurvy trick, and he was glad to revenge himself by this connivance. But if he thought this a good way to be revenged of them, he had very soon reason to be satisfied with it, for his Son became so passionately in love with this new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or rather he became such a very Fool, as when he knew that she was big with Child, he left his Wife, and went and lived with her: and his Father having given him no great yearly revenue, when he married him (though he himself had 400000 Livers a Year, besides great Summs of Money in his Coffers, and not one Farthing of Debt,) he found himself so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because of the two Families he had to provide for, and the charges he had been at in the Camp; that he resolved to do, what People will scarcely believe of one of his quality, that was, to
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
live without Coach, and without that great number of Pages and Lackeys, that Men of his quality usu∣ally have about them, and thus he reduced all his expences for the Winter time, to a very small mat∣ter; having only one Lackey for himself, and ano∣ther for his Mistress; and these he put in gray Cloaths, that when he took a Hackney to go abroad, neither he nor they might be known; The Women Servants wereas few in number, as the Lackeys, she had only a Chamber-maid and a Nurse, and this last serv'd with both hands, that is, she was Servant of the House, and Nurse at the same time. His Friends could bear no longer with his inconsiderateness, and this disgrace∣ful way of living; they spoke to him of it, as a thing that would stain his honour to such a degree, that it would be impossible for him, ever to retrieve it, and that he might not be altogether confounded with shame, as he ought to be for such Practises, they told him that this Woman had certainly bewitched him; that at least they had reason to think so; since it was so unnatural a thing in him, to part with the most lovely Princess in the World, and to keep house with a beggarly Strumpet, whose very Trade and Profession, was enough to make any body disgust her, though she was a Thousand times more charm∣ing in her Person than she seem'd to be. All the An∣swer he made them was, that they spoke so of her, only because they did not know her: But if they had conversed a little with her, they would soon be of another mind; in this they could not agree with him, and having taken leave of him, without being able to perswade him to alter his measures, they were grieved that he continued so obstinately to dis∣grace himself.</P>
<P>When they found this, they caused to speak under∣hand to the Woman her self, and threatn'd, that they would have recourse to Royal Authority, to have her shut up in a Convent, or in some Prison, if she would not even perswade the Duke to part with
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
her. One in her condition could not be well pleased with such a proposal, and it quite confounded her. She knew that those threatnings were not groundless, for she had known a Woman kept in Prison Seven or Eight Years, because she had been Mistress to the Count <HI>D'Harcourt,</HI> whom we have already spoken of. And therefore being resolved to prevent so great a mischief, she promised to do all that was in her power, to satisfy them; and she was as good as her word, for that very day after she had on set purpose, made a show of melancholy to the Duke; she told him that she could not any longer converse with him, as hitherto she had done; because her conscience re∣proached her continually with her guilt, and repre∣sented to her every moment, that she only was the cause that he abandoned his Lady the Dutchess; and that every body blamed her for it, as no doubt she deserved to be, insomuch that was there nothing but that one consideration, she was obliged to tell him, that he must resolve to break up with her, since their converse was equally shameful, and sinful to them both. The Duke was surprised at a discourse which he so little expected; but having still the more esteem of her upon this very account; because the two things she made use of as a pretence for this di∣vorce, are agreeable to a Lover, that is his own in∣terest and the virtue of the Person he loves; he did all he could to make her change her thoughts, but the fears of a Prison made her deaf to all his reasons and to all his caresses; she persisted in her resolution to give over all converse with him, and knowing nothing could more prevail with him to cause him to reflect upon his past conduct, than his own Lady's charming Beauty, which was indeed incomparably above hers, she told him that if she was as beautiful as his Lady, and if his Lady had nothing more charming about her than she had, she would not think it strange that he should forsake her, and live with her; but being obliged to confess, that all the ad∣vantage
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
was upon his Ladies side, she could not suffer any longer, that he should be called a Man of so ill a taste; as to choose the worse, and to forsake the better. He wou'd fain have perswaded her, that only her mo∣desty made her speak so of herself, that if his thoughts were asked in that matter, he would soon tell just the contrary, that he was as capable as any other to judge of their Beauties, having conversed so much with her. But his Mistress finding how he an∣swered her, and that it was impossible to make him gainsay any thing of all this, she betook herself to her first Argument; that her Conscience would not allow her to converse any longer with him.</P>
<P>The Duke considered all these discourses, as the effect of some secret discontent, that had put her in∣to an ill humour; and that he might bring her back to her ordinary Gaiety, he offer'd her some Presents, but she refus'd them generously, and as the most disinteressed Person in the World. In the mean time she gave notice to those who had threatned her, that she was using her utmost endeavours to satisfie them, but if they were desirous that she should suc∣ceed, it was needful they should do something upon their parts. They bestirred themselves immediate∣ly, knowing that it is best to strike the Iron while it is hot; and they came a purpose to wait on the Duke. He would have resisted all the Batteries, they could have raised against him, had they been alone; but his Mistress treating him with so much Indifference, and like a Woman who was absolutely resolv'd, to abandon her former Vices; he told them that there needed no more Importunities, for he was resolved to give them full satisfaction: But if they would know the true reason, why he resolv'd so; it was because his Mistress had determin'd him in it; she who alone had a more absolute Empire over him, than it was possible for all of them to have, when they were united together; that he chearfully and frankly own'd so much to them, hoping,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
that for their parts, they would also acknowledge that she was a much worthier Person than he could express: an evident Proof of which was, that she was fully resolved, to bid adieu to all sorts of Intrigues and Amours; a thing very unusual for Women, af∣ter they have once been accustomed to those Pleasures. But for her, he told them, that he had so good an opinion of her, he could be surety for her, she should never return to them, that at least he would comfort himself, with those thoughts of her. His Friends did not trouble themselves, to dispute this matter with him, nor were they such fools as to inform him, how much they had frighted her with their threatnings, they thought it enough, that they had brought him to their own Terms, and it was all one to them, by what means soever it was done; the only thing they desired was, how to bring the matter to an happy Issue, now that it was so well begun. They went to his Ladies Parents, and desi∣red, they might concurr with them in reconciling them together. But the Dutchess's Mother, (who after she had once taken back her Daughter to her house, could never resolve to part with her) told them resolutely that she would never consent to it. The Dukes Father gave them much the same An∣swer, for he continued to be extreamly angry, at what the young Princess had said of him. But, as Men ordinarily yield sooner to Reason than Women do, he was at last prevail'd with, but upon condi∣tion, that when his Daughter in Law should be re∣concil'd to her Husband, she should not see her Mother any more. This was to throw Oyl into the Flame, and serv'd only to provoke the Ladies In∣dignation, so that she withstood their Reconcile∣ment more than ever. The Prince her Husband, was much wiser and more reasonable than she was: He told her that by the Laws both of God and Man; they were oblig'd to contribute their endeavours for reconciling Husband and Wife; even though they
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
had but small hopes to succeed in it: But that in this case she was much more oblig'd to it, than o∣thers were; because it was the Concern of her Son in law, and her Daughter. But for all this, she continued obstinate, and she had such an Ascendant over him, that he us'd to do nothing but what she was pleas'd with, it was at last found necessary to speak to the King of it.</P>
<P>His Majesty was of the Fathers opinion, and thought that in procuring such an Agreement, they ought not to stand upon Punctilios; and therefore order'd the Dutchess to follow her Husbands Ad∣vice.</P>
<P>The Condition propos'd by her Son in law's Father, that she should not see her Daughter, was qualified, and she was allow'd to see her sometimes, but not above twice a Week, lest the Dukes Father should take it amiss. It went much against the Ladies Stomach, that they should set bounds to the Kind∣ness she had for her Daughter; and therefore she propos'd, that if she was not to see her Daughter but twice a Week; then her Son in law's Father, should not be allow'd to see her at all, and much less that they should live in the same House. They found out also a Medium for this, which was that he might see her, as often as his Son would allow him; and they told the Lady, that her Son in law, was more concerned than she was, that his Father should not see her Daughter; if all was true, that was said of him. After all these things were con∣certed, nothing remain'd, but to know, what the Duke would do with his Mistress and his Child; and that he would pitch upon a day for being fully recon∣ciled to his Dutchess. As to the first, he promis'd to allow them a Pension, which perhaps he has not been over careful to perform; yet I will not vouch this for a Truth; but because he was then as passio∣nately in love with her as ever, I may presume, he was prodigal enough of his Promises, but perhaps, he
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
has been as sparing in performing them; for Lovers easily forget their Promises, when they are not any more to see the Person, to whom they are made. As to the other matter, he made no difficulty in it; the day was appointed, and there was a new Mar∣riage solemniz'd. Before he went to Bed with his Wife, their Parents paid their Compliments to them, as if they had been, but a new married Couple: And their other Friends, after their example, did the same; in fine, they were both together, carried to the Opera, and to other publick places, that those who had heard of their Divorce, might see that the greatest Follies do not last always.</P>
<P>One would think, that such an example as this, might have had, a good Influence, upon those, who werefallen into the same frensy, that is upon those, who made but small account of their Wives, for the sake of these naughty Creatures; but we have not hitherto seen, any good that it hath done to a cer∣tain Duke, who though he has not as yet parted with his Wife, as the other did; yet, he lives not in much better Terms with her; one of these un∣happy Women of the Playhouse, having by some means engaged his Affections. has so bewitchd him, that of a long time, he has had no Converse with his Wife; and vet she's very young, and which is more, she's a Lady of great Vertue, which is so valuable an Accomplishment, yea, and so singular in this Age, as to deserve that a Husband should esteem it much more than he does.</P>
<P>'Tis true, she is not so great a beauty, as is an Aunt of her Husbands, who yet has not been much more fortunate, though she be a Lady of great Vir∣tue, as well as her Neice. This Lady was married to a Person of Honour, and a Man of as good Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as was about the Court, which is another reason why he should have used her well; for the more a Man has of Honour and true Sense, the more will he endeavour to acquit himself of his Duty. But he was so desperately in Love with a young Lady, who
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
is also of great vertue, and is at this time Superiour of the Maids of St. <HI>Marie de Chaliot,</HI> that he could not open his eyes, to see how happy he might have been in his own Wife. And he did even much worse, than did the two Dukes I last spoke of, for he did not so much as bed with her, the first Night of the Marriage: And if we will believe the accounts we have at Court, he suffered her to continue always a Maid, though they liv'd a long time together, and though there was never any publick breach between them. His Father, who was also a Man of good Sense, and so far from approving his want of affection to this Lady, that he was extreamly vexed at it, when he perceived it, and told him his thought of it, very freely; and finding the Arguments he made use of, made him nothing the wiser Man, he be thought himself of others, and try'd if perhaps they would be of greater force: He told him, that laying aside the authority of a Father, he would now only advise him as his true Friend, and that all he had to say to him, was, that all the Court look'd upon his Wife, as a very agreeable Lady, and that among them who esteem'd her much, she might perhaps find one whom she would think worthy of her Affection, that the best means how to prevent that, was for him to per∣form the duty of a Husband to her, otherwise per∣haps another might supply his place. This advice was sound and wholsome, but as this young Gentle∣man had shut his Eyes, and would not take notice of his Lady's true worth, so he stopt his Ears at his Father's Reasons, and held on his course, without ever troubling himself, with the thoughts of his future destiny. Yet the Horoscope, which his Father had cast for him, prov'd false, for there was never a Lady at Court, made her self be less talk'd of than she did However, her Husband died, and she kept for a second Husband, that, which is so much valued in a Bride. She was reputed a Widow, but was truly a Maid when she was married the second time
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
And as if she had been born under the strangest Planet that ever was. 'Tis generally believed that this se∣cond Husband, has not as yet made her change her condition. He was one of the handsomest men in <HI>France,</HI> yet altogether unfit for the Marriage Bed; and therefore his first Wife did not care much to dwell with him, though there was never any publick rupture between them, and though she might have made a very good figure at Court too: But she chose rather to leave him there alone, and to revenge her self of her hard fate, upon the Harts, and other wild Beasts, with whom she made War so long as she liv'd. 'Tis true, that when she was a dying, she made a Will in his Favours, which would seem to import quite other things, than what I have been just now alledging; for it's seld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m that a Wife will be so obliging to a Husband, unless she have first receiv'd of his Favours: But all Women are not of the same humour, and it must be said to the advantage of this Lady, that as to this matter, she was less concern'd, and much more modest, than many others are. Hunting was that which she took greatest Pleasure in, and because her Husband treated her always very kindly, save, in that, which most of other Women think the chief and essential part of a Husband's kindness. It seems she made no great account of it; And she had rather, that her Husband should enjoy her estate, than some of her Relations, whom she did not much esteem. She gave the trust of her Will, to the Duke <HI>De Les∣deguires,</HI> but he being surprised with a sudden Death, when he was least thinking of it, and when he had lived but to half the Age, that by the course of Na∣ture he might have done; it created much trouble afterwards to her Husband. Yet this was a sea∣sonable relief to him, and he had much need of it, to repair the breaches he had made in his own estate, in the time he had been at Court.</P>
<P>As the Court is the place of the World, where the greatest number of extraordinary things fall out:
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
so about the same time, that the terms of the Re∣conciliation (which I spoke of) were agreed to; There was one thing happened that did not sound well, for one of the principal Actors in it, and it has made People have but an ill Opinion of a Man, whom we now bring upon the Stage.</P>
<P>We must know then, that among other methods which the King had taken, to raise Money, for maintaining the War, he had publish'd an Edict, for the sale of some Governments, within the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of the Kingdom; and there was more need of Money, for the purchase of them, than either of Service or Merit. There is a little Town nam'd <HI>Rue,</HI> lying towards <HI>Abbeville</HI> in <HI>Piccardy,</HI> and the late Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf,</HI> was formerly Governour of it. And his Son the present Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf,</HI> finding that it would be very convenient for him, that he had the Govern∣ment of the same place, resolv'd to purchase it. There was one Monsieur <HI>d' Augancourt,</HI> a Gentleman of that Country, who was neither rich nor much ta∣ken notice of, some 25 Years ago, but has now a good estate, and lives in plenty, because he belong'd to the late Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and carry'd his <HI>Portofolio,</HI> when that Minister went to do busine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with the King. This Gentleman, I say, design'd also to purchase it; and so soon as he knew that the Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf</HI> had the same design, he took an odd method, to carry it against him; a method, which any other Man than he, would have been afraid of, but he was for bold Adventures, that he might bring about his Designs, and because he had not been altogether unsuccessful in another business, wherein he was once like to have been quite ruin'd, he hop'd he might succeed well enough in this; especially seeing what Friends or Interests soever, the Duke <HI>d Elbeuf</HI> could make, he was still much less to be fear'd, than was his former <HI>Antagonist</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Barbesieux.</HI> Yea it was not only with him he had contended, but with the whole Family of his Old Master the Mar∣quis
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
<HI>de Louvois,</HI> whose Memory he endeavour'd to blacken. I shall first give an Account of this Affair, and then I shall return to his business with the Duke <HI>d'Elbeufe.</HI></P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> being dead, this <HI>d' Au∣gincourt,</HI> who had the honour to be known to the King, because he had so very often, carry'd this Mi∣nister<HI>'s Portofolio,</HI> to the Door of his Majesties Closet; having asked and obtained a secret audience, told him, that he thought it his Duty to advertise him of one thing, which his Majesty knew nothing of before; which was, that his Majesty had always be∣lieved that all the projects which the late Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> had presented to him, were of his own con∣trivance, but it was far from being so, and that that Minister had always had recourse to him, when he had any thing to do of Consequence: That it was he who had projected such and such things, and that the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> was never able of himself, to do any thing to purpose; that his undertakings at <HI>Maintenon,</HI> were a sufficient proof of this, that at that place he had committed a great many faults, which he had never fallen into, had he but followed his advice, that he was ready to discover these faults and oversights to his Majesty, who, because of his great skill in Fortification, would soon be convinced, that what he said was true. The King who is truly skilful in these things, and perhaps much more so, than many People believe of him, finding that he offer'd to prove to a demonstration all the oversights, which he charg'd his late Minister with, gave him, upon that Account a fuller hearing than otherways he would have done. <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> having said whatever he thought fit for his own advantage, and the King knowing that in some things he was in the right, though in some also he was mistaken; was so far from telling him, that he did not approve of his ingrati∣tude to his Master, to whom he had been obliged of his Estate, that though these were his Sentiments,
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
yet on the contrary he told him, that he would con∣tinue the Pension to him, which he had given him upon the Marquis <HI>D' Louvois</HI>'s recommendation: <HI>D' Augincourt,</HI> though he was in some measure plea∣sed with the Kings bounty, because the cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuing of the Pension, was a Proof that his Majesty ap∣proved of what he had said, yet he was not altoge∣ther satisfied, for he had flattered himself, with the hopes of a much greater reward; and that his Ma∣jesty would make use of him, in his secret affairs, of which he pretended to have the Key; and expect∣ing that the King would bestow the late Marquis <HI>D'Louvois</HI> place upon him, he continued as often as he could find occasion, to speak all the ill of him he could think of. 'Tis impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble for one to behave himself after this manner at Court, but that a Mini∣ster shall have notice of it, and the Marquis <HI>D'Bar∣biseux</HI> was soon advertised of it, and he was struck to the very Heart with it; especially when he knew that the King had granted him his Pension; by which he understood that his Majesty believed ma∣ny of the things which he had alledged against his Fathers Memory. These thoughts galled him so much, that he resolved to be revenged on him, and meeting with him that very day, as he was going to the Kings Appartments, he was not Master enough of his Passions, for at first sight he gave him very harsh Language as he well deserved, but <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> who flattered himself, that since the King had heard him so favourably, he would cer∣tainly grant him the honour of his Protection, an∣swered him with as much insolence, as if he had never been his Fathers domestick. This insolent behaviour raised the Marquis <HI>D'Barbiseux</HI>'s passion to such a height, that he himself forgot the respect he owed to the place he was in; he took him by the Cravate and would have certainly strangled him, had not his Friends put him in mind, that the King would be highly offended at what he was doing. He yeilded
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
to their reasons and went immediately to the King, and told him, that he came to beg his pardon, for something he had done in a sudden fit of passion; that his Majesty knew how unaccountable <HI>D' Augincourts</HI> ingratitude was, towards his Father, tho' it was to him he owed all he had; that he had met with him accidentally at the door of the Antichamber; and not being able to command his passion, he had offered some violence to him, of which he humbly ac∣knowledged himself guilty, that tho' his passion lasted but a moment, because he had reflected upon it, yet he did not pretend to be excusable upon that account, and therefore he would submit to all the punish∣ments, that his Majesty should order for him, only he besought him to consider how natural it was for a Son, to be sensibly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ched with every thing that concerned his Fathers Honour. The King having heard him calmly, answered him, that it was good for him that he had so soon reflected upon his fault, and had put a stop to the course of his passion; but that he had done better if he had reflected sooner upon it, so as not to have committed it, that yet he would pardon him upon the account of what a Son ow'd to his Father; but upon condition always, that he should never again fall into the like enormity. The Marquis <HI>De Barbiseux</HI> acted like a wise man, thus to prevent the other in addressing himself to the King; for scarcely had he done it, when <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> presented himself before his Majesty, and demanded justice for the ill treatment he had met with from his Minister. The King told him he should have it, but that he would first examine how the matter went; but seeing he had once promised to pardon the Mar∣quis <HI>D' Barbiseux,</HI> all the satisfaction <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> could ever obtain, was that his Majesty told him, he had given him such a reprimand as was proper, and that he would be wiser in time coming, he told him also, that when one had been a menial Servant to a Man, as he had been to the Marquis <HI>D'Louvois,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
he ought to behave himself respectfully towards his Children.</P>
<P><HI>D'Augincourt</HI> might have learned from this, to have been wiser afterwards, than to contend with one that was above him, yet never thinking that the same accident might befall him, if he fell again into the same Errour; he no sooner formed the design of carrying the Government of <HI>Rue</HI> against the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> but he gave in a memoir against him to the King, which contained that this Prince, had been several times guilty of extortioning the People, within the bounds of his Government of <HI>Piccardy</HI> and <HI>Artois,</HI> and that his Majesty might give credit to this, he offered to prove it, so soon as he was commanded to do it: the King who knew that this Prince had some good qualities, for which he is deservedly esteemed, was troubled to see him stain'd with so black an ac∣cusation, as that of extortion is. Not but that he knew well enough, that accusations are not always true; he had seen abundance of instances in his own time, where the Accusations fell back upon the Heads of the Accusers; as it happened to <HI>Courbier</HI> and some others. But because this memoir was so conceived, as to have all the appearances of truth, the King knew not well what to say of it, and would not so much as speak of it; but the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> finding that the Farmers of the Kings revenues, asked much more for the Government of <HI>Rue,</HI> than it was worth, because <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had offered them Money, he had recourse to the King that he might not fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>His Majesty, who remembred what the other had said to his disadvantage, instead of answering him, so obligingly as he used to do, told him only, that he would consider of it. The Duke who knew his Majesties humour, which is to be kind and obliging, even to Persons of far less quality than he concluded presently from this answer, that some person had done him an ill office; He did all he cou'd,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
for some days, to discover who it might be, and knowing that <HI>D'Augincourt,</HI> had an Eye upon the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Rue,</HI> he was almost perswaded that he was the Man. His Ingratitude to his late Master, was enough to make him entertain these thoughts of him, yet that he might be more assur'd of it, he spoke again to the King, and begg'd to know, if he had as yet considered of his Request, as he had promised to do: His Majesty told him, that he had thought of it, but it could not be granted him, for some Reasons which he was unwilling to tell him. The Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> was yet more surprized at this Answer, than he was at the first, and was more per∣swaded than ever, that the King was not well pleased with him, and therefore he supplicated His Majesty, with the greatest Earnestness, that he would be graci∣ously pleased to tell him what it was, that he had to lay to his Charge. His Majesty answered him, that he had resolved to conceal it from him, that thereby he might save him the trouble, which the know∣ledge of it would certainly give him. But since he was so very earnest to know it, he would tell him plainly, that he had received a Memoir a∣gainst him, wherein he was accus'd, of extortion∣ing the People who lived under his Jurisdiction. 'Tis true the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> who is not very rich, and who loves to live great, and therefore had need to make the best advantage of every thing; had us'd his utmost Skill and Industry, in looking narrowly after his Affairs, so that nothing that did of right belong to him, could escape him; but how much soever he look'd after his own Interest, yet he had never been an Extortioner; and he could not endure that he should be unjustly accused of it: And therefore, he requested His Majesty, that In∣quiry should be made into it. He told him that he who was but a Young man, had rashly done some things in his time, which his Majesty could not approve of, that he most humbly begg'd pardon
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
for them, as he had also done, when he was first charged with them; but that he was content to lose his Head, if ever he was in the least guilty of what was now laid to his Charge. The King who was prepossessed with an Opinion, that <HI>D'Au∣gincourt</HI> would never have dared, to have given him the Memoir, if he had not been well assured, that what it contain'd was true; especially since he lived in the Neighbourhood, where he pretended that the Duke had been guilty of the Extortions; answered him, that he would not at all advise him, to search this matter to the bottom, least perhaps it might prove more to his hurt than he expected, and that at least it was probable it would prove so. This answer afflicted him yet more, than any of the former Answers had done; and therefore he continued to solicit His Majesty, that he would be pleased to allow him to justify him∣self. The King turned away from him, to speak to another Person of Quality, to whom he had something to say: And the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> going out with an heart full of Sorrow, resolved to em∣ploy all his own and his friends Interests, that he might be allowed to clear himself of this Calumny. As he went out of the Antichamber, he found <HI>D'Au∣gincourt</HI> with one of his Friends at the door of the Guard-hall, he took him aside, to speak to him in private. <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> left his friend alone, and the Duke asked him, if perhaps he was not the Man, who had given the King a certain Memoir, of which his Majesty had been just now speaking to him? <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> who had so much Impudence as to speak ill of his dead Master, by whose fa∣vour it was, that he had acquired all that he was worth; was impudent enough to own in the Dukes face, that he was the very Man; and which was more, he told him that he had promised to the King, to make good every thing that was in that Memoir, and that e're it was long, he would
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
be as good as his word. The Duke was so wise, as not to do as the Marquis <HI>de Barbisieux</HI> had done, when he fell into his hands. But instead of that, he contented himself to tell him, that he was satisfied to know, how far his Impudence had carried him, that he might come to be treated as he deserv'd, at another time, and in another place; that he would take notice of him, and at last he threaten'd him, that he would cause him to be cudgelled to death for a Rascal as he was. <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> went and complain'd to the King, and demanded Justice of him. The King told him, he was ready to do him Justice, but he must first prove what he had alledged against the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf;</HI> who expresly denied all that he had charged him with: And if he had calumniated him without ground, then the Duke had much more reason to demand Justice than he had. The Duke re∣turn'd to wait upon the King, and requested him to appoint Judges, to enquire into that matter; for if that were not done, his Reputation shou'd be brought into question, and that it was not just, that in prejudice of his Innocence any credit should be given, to such a lying Wretch as <HI>D'Augincourt:</HI> He told him at the same time, the designs that <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had upon the Government of <HI>Rue,</HI> and that he had taken this method of calumniating him, fearing least other∣wise, he should not be able to carry it against him. The King who is extreamly prudent and judicious, began to perceive how the matter stood, as soon as he heard this; and he guess'd, that Jealousie and interest, had made <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> do what he had done; and therefore he allowed that the Duke should clear himself; and promised to name Judges for that Affair: and which was more, he told him, that if he found <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had accused him falsly, he should cause to inflict any Punishment upon him, that the Duke thought fit. But the Judges were not named, for some time
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
after; insomuch that now, when I am writing these <HI>Memoirs;</HI> this Affair is not as yet ended.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Beaus</HI> of the Court; were become so profligate, that many lewd Women, came to be in vogue among them; and among the rest, the Women of the Playhouse and the Opera: But there were some others besides them, who came to be as much esteemed as they were; and especially one <HI>Ma∣demoiselle Chambonneau,</HI> the Daughter of a Gentle∣man of <HI>Poiton,</HI> who finding her self every way fit∣ted for Amours, thought it was pity, to bury so good Qualities, in an obscure Country place; and therefore, she came to <HI>Paris,</HI> where she might set them forth; in the view of the finest City, and of the finest Court in the World. Prince <HI>Philip,</HI> was one of her first Admirers; but he dy∣ing soon after, there were others succeeded him, who were fully equal to him, both for Personal Worth and Quality, so that she was no looser by the Change. But before I say any more of her, I beg leave to give an account of a silly Imper∣tinence of the Marshal <HI>de Milleraies</HI> Lady, who is the most whimsical Woman in the World, as to what concerns Quality.</P>
<P>This Prince had not lived a very Christian Life, at least, so far as appeared to the View of the World: And there was a devout Lady, who soon after his Death, said in a publick Company, where the Marshal's Lady was; that his Salvation was much to be doubted of, considering how irreli∣giously he had lived; that many People had been Witnesses of his Debaucheries, but none had ever heard of his Repentance. The Marshal's Lady answered, that she confessed that all that was true; but that God was merciful, especially to a Person of Prince <HI>Philip</HI>'s Quality; and that since God was good to all Mankind, he would be much more so, to such a Man as he was; and when it came to the damning of a Person of so great
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
Quality, God would think twice upon it before he did it: The Lady to whom she made this Answer, would not let her pass with it, though she knew her weak side, and that she was but a magotty Woman about these things, and therefore she could not hope for much satisfaction, from any thing she could say about them.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject, <HI>Madam Cham∣bonneau,</HI> being the Widow of a Person of such a Character, and being married to a second Hus∣band, who is yet more of it, all the young People of Quality resorted to her House. Her new Hus∣band was not at all jealous of her, and allow'd her to see every body. And she got a good num∣ber of young Favourites about her, out of which she was sure to make a choice of such Debauchees as were most agreeable to her humour; especially the Count <HI>de Donsi,</HI> eldest son to the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> a Man of as odd a Temper as his Father is; and to give his Character in one Word, I need only say, that he has all the Vices of the <HI>Manchinies,</HI> yea, and surpasses them in two things, that are ex∣treamly shameful in any man; but especially in a Person of his Quality. He can scarce speak a word without adding the Name of God to it, and Blasphemes as often as he speaks. And as for Drinking, it would seem that in what place soe∣ver he is, <HI>Bacchus</HI> had set up his Throne, and kept Court there: Yet these are the two great Quali∣ties he boasts most of, whereas he ought rather to consider them, as very dangerous Distempers; for in my opinion, he who is become a Slave, to two such disgraceful Vices, may justly look up∣on himself, as the most wretched and miserable of all Mortals. Notwithstanding all this, he is so very comely and handsome in his Person, that were he as sound in the Head, as he is well shap'd in the Body, we might easily excuse not only this <HI>Mad. Chambonneau,</HI> but many others; who after her
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Example, should show some Affection for him▪</P>
<P>This Counts Father, (who is sordidly penurious in some things, tho' in others he seems rather to be prodigal) did not allow him so much as one far∣thing of Money, which was the reason, that he had neither Servants nor Equipage. Perhaps he would have had him to go to the Market as he did himself; for we must know, that when the humour takes him, he makes no scruple to go thither: And 'tis pretty odd to see a Knight of the Holy Ghost with his blew Ribband, in a Publick Market, asking a Fruit woman, how she sells her Fruit and her Carrots. There was a man came once, and told <HI>Monsieur Baville</HI> Intendant of <HI>Lan∣guedoc,</HI> that he was seen doing so in the publick Market at <HI>Montpellier,</HI> but he could not tell his Name, for he that had seen him, did not know him; he sent immediately to all parts of the Town, to know who this Knight of the Holy Ghost might be, that was come thither; and so soon as he knew that it was the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> he went to pay him a Visit; and that he might engage him to reflect upon his own Conduct, as unwor∣thy of his Character; he told him, that he should not have known that he was in that Town, but that it had been told him, that he was seen in the Market, that when he first heard of it, he could not beleive it, till it was confirm'd to him by so many People, that at last he was forced to give credit to it, lest he should seem to be too incre∣dulous. The Duke answered him, that he had gone from his Lodgings, with a design to pay him a Visit, but that having thought it too early, and that he would not be up so soon; he had done after the Custom of <HI>Italy,</HI> which allows Masters to go themselves, and buy whatever they have a mind to eat; that he knew it was not so in <HI>France,</HI> but that for his part, he never stood upon such small matters, so that he might have the satisfaction to
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
have nothing upon his Table, but what did relish with him.</P>
<P>But this Man is of a singular humour in other things besides this, especially in his way of House∣keeping. For when he is not to have any Strangers at his Table, he gives fifty Sols a day for himself, and as much for his Lady, to the Steward of his House, who must therewith provide victuals for them both; and as to his Servants, he gives Ten Sols for every one of them, so that he is in no great hazard of being cheated; since the Steward can neither augment nor diminish the daily Allow∣ance. By this means its only when he entertains Strangers, that any thing beyond ordinary is to be seen in his House, and it's then, that he uses to go himself to the Market, which might be thought a sure Mark of a penurious Humour: Were it not that there is one thing remarkable in his House, that is not to be found elsewhere, and that is, that if a∣nother Man have one Cook, and an Under-cook; This Duke has six, or at least four of them; for he has an humour, that he will not suffer that one Cook should meddle but with one thing: So that he, who has the charge of the Roast Meat, never med∣dles with the Ragoo's, and he who has the charge of the Ragoo's, meddles not with the more dainty Dishes; and so of the rest.</P>
<P>A Man of so singular an humour as this is, could never allow his Son to live such a Life as he did; he had already quit his House, so as not to lodge in it, and he thought it high time to give a check to his extravagant way of living; he sent to him, and warn'd him not to see Mad. <HI>Chambonneau</HI> any more, or else he knew what remedies to find for his Distem∣per. He was afraid either that he should run him∣self into debt, by spending too much with her, or that he should be such a Fool, as to marry her pri∣vately, as was reported of him. He had reason to look upon him, as a Man that was capable of any¦thing

that was foolish and extravagant, though there had been no other ground for it, but only this, that he had taken upon himself the Title of a Duke, though it did not all belong to him, and which is yet worse, had no ground to hope that ever it should belong to him, for his Father's Patent is not for his Posterity, but only for his own Life time. So that when he comes to die, his Fa∣mily has done with that Title; as it happened not long ago to Monsieur <HI>Vieuville.</HI> By this, we may easily judge of the Father's humour, for he married his Lady, when her Aunt, Madam <HI>de Montespan,</HI> was in greatest favour with the King, and at her greatest height; yet he neglected to have that Honour ensur'd to his Posterity and Family, tho' it would have cost him nothing to obtain it, if he had but asked it.</P>
<P>However, the Count <HI>de Donsi,</HI> who had heard, that while his Father was a young Man, he had liv'd much after the same manner, that he did himself now while he was also young; and that he could not justly challenge him, for copying after his example, answered the Gentleman whom his Father had sent to him, that he could not think of leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> as he would have him do. The Duke procur'd a letter <HI>de Cachet</HI> from the King, for comitting him to the Bastile.</P>
<P>Mad. <HI>Chambonneau</HI> went the first and second day after he was taken up, and wandered up and down about the Castle, to try, if perhaps she might see him upon the Terrass, or in the Windows; but she dar'd not adventure to go in, and inquire for him, for they had threatned to put herself in Prison, if she should be found in a disguise, offering to pay him a visit: But she was so much a <HI>Coquette,</HI> that in two or Three days, she became indifferent, whether she should ever see him again or no; she troubled herself no more about him, but considered him as a dead Man, because he was no more in a con∣dition to do her service. Only she thought fit to keep some rules of decency with him, and there∣fore
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
she wrote some Letters to him, and expressed herself as tenderly, as if she had loved him as much as ever, and even imployed <HI>Mademoiselle de Sois∣sons</HI> (who's conduct is not much approved of, by those who are concerned in her Person and Interest) that she might assure him of it. <HI>Mademoiselle de Soissons</HI> went twice or thrice to the Bastile to deliver her Commission, and it may be she was glad of the opportunities, that she might see him her self. But the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> (who was jea∣lous of her, and to whom the Governour of the Castle, would not refuse any favour, because he ow'd his Fortune to Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> the Dukes Uncle,) prevailed so far that she was stopt at the Gate, and not suffered to enter, as if it had been by order from his Majesty. This was a notable affront for this Princess; who tho' she was warned of what was to befall her, yet could not believe that the Governour dar'd do such a thing, because she was grand Niece of the same Cardinal, to whom he had been Captain of the Guards.</P>
<P>But as he had learned from him, to make no great account of any sort of People, but of those who were rich and powerful; and she being neither the one nor the other, because of the many Disasters, that had befallen her family, he got soon over those considerations, that so he might gratify the Duke. She might have complained of this to the King, if she durst have spoken to him, but his Majesty was far from having any esteem for her, and he had already caused notice to be given her, that if she did not alter her conduct, he would be obliged to send her orders, that would not at all please her; and therefore she had ra∣ther put up the affront, and be silent, than by complaining, to put his Majesty in mind, that she did not live as a Lady of her quality ought to do. Yet the King did not forget her so soon, he remembered her more than ever; now that the
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> had married the Princess of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The honour that <HI>Mademoiselle de Soissons,</HI> had, to be of the same Family that the Princess is of, made him often reflect, how unworthy it was of her Character and Quality to live as she did; and seeing she would not be reclaim'd, by what was said to her, either from the King, or from her Friends, he sent her a Letter <HI>de Cachet,</HI> to de∣part out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Her Sister <HI>Mademoiselle Carignan</HI> got also a se∣cret rebuke, though her conduct was not altoge∣ther so disorderly as hers was; yet she came to be talked of, as conversing too frequently with a certain Duke, who was married: The King there∣fore sent to her, and offered her an Apartment at <HI>Versailles;</HI> upon condition that she would take a Governess of his naming. She had one already, who was as old a Woman as any I know; and <HI>Mademoiselle Carrignan</HI> took occasion from this, to excuse her self, for not accepting the honour which his Majesty had designed for her, and she told those who spake to her from his Majesty; that it would occasion the death of her old Go∣verness, if she should now put her a way, when she had been so long time with her; that it would look like a Tacite Accusation, that she had not been so careful as she ought to have been of her Education; that in all appearance she could not live long; and that so soon as she was dead, there could be nothing which she would so much re∣joyce at, as to make good use of the Favors, which his Majesty was pleased to offer her. <HI>Mademoiselle de Carignan,</HI> having by this means got her self off, she was very well pleased, that she had thereby shun'd the constraint, under which she should have been, had she liv'd at <HI>Versailles.</HI> She chose rather to keep her own little Court at the <HI>Hotel de Soissons,</HI> than to be one of those, who make
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
up the splendour at the Princesses Court: The good old Woman Madam <HI>de St. Martin</HI> who is her Governess, was extreamly well pleased, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the answer she had made; in the mean time, the Duke was advertised of this, and it was desired of him that he would take care, not to pay her so many visits, as he used to do; lest the King should send her such another order, as he had sent to her Sister.</P>
<P><HI>Mademoiselle Chambonneau</HI> was in a great conster∣nation, when she heard of <HI>Mademoiselle de Soisson's</HI> fate; she was affraid, that since the King had dealt so hardly by a Person of her Birth, he might come to deal more severely by her, how small provocation soever, she should give him; she therefore intreated many of the young <HI>Beaus</HI> that frequented her house, that they should come but seldom thither. But he who had succeeded to Prince <HI>Philip</HI> having encouraged her, by an Oath that he made to her, that he would preserve her, from all hazards; she soon recall'd those whom so lately she had advised to seek for diversions else∣where. But there were two of them, whom she endeavoured all she could, to discourage from coming to her House; because she thought neither of 'em fit for her purpose; the one was the <HI>Baillif D'Auvergne,</HI> eldest Son of the Count <HI>D'Au∣vergne;</HI> who had already so much offended his Fa∣ther, that he had nothing to expect from him. For he had forced him to ingage himself in the order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and to give up his right of primogeni∣ture in Favours of that Brother, who was next to him in age. The other was the <HI>Chevalier de Kailus,</HI> a younger brother of the Marquis <HI>de Kailus,</HI> who has married <HI>Mademoiselle de Vilette,</HI> a Cousin of <HI>Madam de Mantenons.</HI> This Man had not the same faults that the <HI>Baillif de Auvergne</HI> had; yet he had as small a share in <HI>Mademoiselle Chambonneau</HI>'s Fa∣vors as the other had, though I know not upon
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
what account it was so. And she endeavoured to set them at variance, that by the one, she might come to get rid of the other; or rather, that she might get rid of them both at the same time. The best means she could think on for this, was, under pretence of Friendship, to make every one of them believe, that the other spake much to his disadvantage; they easily believ'd what she said, for each of them was perswaded, that she loved him dearly; and therefore, thought it im∣possible, that she could tell him any thing, that was false. They began then to look a squint up∣on one another, but their Resentments were too strong to stop there. They agreed to do one ano∣ther Justice, with Sword in hand; and to try, which of them <HI>Madm. de Chambonneau</HI> should be∣long to. They agreed to meet, in the Court of the Abbey of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and that the one of them should make, as if he were going into the Church, while the other was coming out of it, that so, it might seem, that they had met only by chance; for they knew, how severe the King was to those, that dar'd to transgress his Edicts; and especially that, which he had made against Duels: they knew, that he could never be prevail'd with, to grant a Pardon to any Man who had been so un∣fortunate, as to fall into that Crime.</P>
<P>They met, as they had appointed, and drew their Swords, but were parted before much blood was shed. Yet the one of them wounded the o∣ther, and each of them retir'd to a Friends house; and resolved not to come abroad, till they should know first, if it was safe for them to appear; but they had notice very soon, that they should do well to lurk; and that the King was no sooner informed of their fighting, but that he had sent an Order to the Procuror General of the Parliament, to en∣quire after that Matter. The Count <HI>d' Auvergn</HI> went at the same time to <HI>Versailles,</HI> and said to
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
the King, that though he came to beg a favour of him, yet it was not at all for his Son, who had now of a long time behav'd himself so unworthi∣ly, that he did not concern himself in any thing upon his Account.</P>
<P>But seeing, as the case stood, if he was senten∣ced to die, the like Sentence must necessarily pass against the <HI>Chevalier de Kailus,</HI> who deserv'd much better than his Son did, that his Condition and Circumstances should be regarded; he did therefore, upon his Account, rather than upon his own, supplicate His Majesty to give Orders, that the whole Affair might be well examined; for if there was any credit to be given to those who waited on his Son, he had fought only upon an acciden∣tal Rencounter, and without any premeditated de∣sign to transgress His Majesty's Laws. It would have been a very extraordinary thing for a Fa∣ther, (who what Faults soever his Son hath com∣mitted, easily forgets them, when his Life is at Stake,) thus to have expressed himself, in good earnest; but it was fit, the Count should use some Art upon such an Occasion. He knew, that some∣times Prudence will oblige a Man to blame those, who he designs should be found innocent; espe∣cially, when he is speaking to those whom they are accountable to, for what they have done; and who are offended with them. For as one seldom gains any thing, by opposing a passionate Man, while his Anger is at its height; but upon the other hand brings him soonest to Reason, by seem∣ing to go along with him in his Sentiments; so it is with regard to a Prince, who alledges, that such a man has transgressed his Laws; and there∣fore deserves to be punished. However, the King having given him as favourable a Reception, as he could have desired; answered him, that both for his Sons sake, and for the sake of the Chevalier <HI>de Kailus,</HI> he wished that it might be found so,
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
as he had heard; but that he would be very soon informed of it, for he had already given such strict Orders about it, that it was altogether need∣less to give any more.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King came to be infor∣med, that it was upon <HI>Madam Chambonneau's</HI> Account, that they had come to fight; and that she had industriously set them together by the Ears, by her false Reports: Upon which he sent a Letter <HI>de cachet,</HI> ordering her to be banish d to <HI>Rowan.</HI> There were some young Counsellors of that Parliament, who got into a humour of courting her, but she found a great difference between them, and that great croud of Persons of Quality, who used to frequent her House at <HI>Paris.</HI> And being soon wearied of that Town, she would have lan∣guished to death, but that she hoped, that her Friends would employ all their Interests to have her recalled. But as among the vast number of Women, who live as she did, there are but few, who are so fortunate as was <HI>Ninon Lendos;</HI> that is, there are but few of them, who have the art to engage People to love them, notwithstanding all the Lewdness they can be guilty of; so those who had seen her at <HI>Paris,</HI> forgot her much soo∣ner than she thought of. And at last having lost all her hopes, she was so overwhelmed with grief, that she died soon after.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> who while she was at <HI>Rowan,</HI> knew his Son's Character better, than to be affraid that he would be at the pains to go thither, (for the Count <HI>de Donzi</HI> is a Man who can very soon forget both Friends and Mistresses) the Duke <HI>de Nevers</HI> I say, who had nothing to fear on that score, got an Order to set him at liberty: But it was upon condition, that he should go to <HI>Mou∣lins,</HI> and wait there, till the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI> his Cousin, with whom he had made the last Cam∣paign, and with whom he resolved that he should
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
make the next, should be in a readiness to set for∣ward for the Camp. In the mean while, <HI>Ma∣damoiselle de Soissons</HI> left <HI>Paris,</HI> in obedience to the King▪s Commands, and went to her Mother a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Brussels.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, who while her Husband was alive had been an Honour to <HI>France;</HI> as far, as a costly and magnificent way of living can be accounted so; had fallen on a sudden, (if I may so say, from Greatness and Splendor, into Poverty and Misery: having been accused of poysoning her Hus¦band; for which she was forced to make her Es¦cape into <HI>Flanders,</HI> without having so much as 24 Hours allowed her, to put her Affairs in order If we may give credit to what she says herself she was altogether innocent of this Crime: And it was her mortal Enemy, the Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> who had forged that Accusation against her, because she would never be in Friendship with him. But whatever may be in this, 'tis certain, that at Court, she has always been reputed guilty of that Crime. Whether it be, that she has still powerful Ene∣mies there, or that the King is convinced, that she is not unjustly accused, I cannot tell; but there is not one, that offers to espouse her Interests. Before that <HI>Madamoiselle de Soissons</HI> went to that Country, it was reported, that she would go to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and that <HI>Madam de Soissons</HI> her Mother, would go and live there also: because she could not live any longer at <HI>Brussels,</HI> where every thing was so dear. A certain Woman named <HI>Vendome,</HI> who is well known at Court, not by her Quality, but because she brings thither Sallads for the King and Nobility, which are better than any that comes from another hand; hearing, that this Princess was brought so very low, and remembring her former Splendour that she had often seen; was so touched with Compassion for her, that she sent her as much Money, as one of her small Stock
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
was able to spare, and 'tis said, that she received it; yea, and that she was very well pleased with it. But this is what I cannot aver for a truth, tho' I have heard it told to some Persons of the greatest Quality, who may have known something of it themselves. But I can scarcely believe, that this Princess, was ever reduc'd to so great Straits, as to accept of so small a Summ as that was; and at least, I wish it may not have been so, after having my self been Witness of the great Pomp she former∣ly liv'd in. Yet it was commonly reported at Court, that had not the Lady of a Foreign Prince's Mini∣ster, supplyed her with Money, she had not known how to satisfie her Baker and Butcher, who dun'd her continually for the Money she ow'd them.</P>
<P>Whatever was in this, her Family has been in a declining State these Twenty Five Years past, and is very much lower, than it was before that time; and this Princess's Son, who should have raised it up again, having been so low-spirited, as to Marry a Girl, who is unworthy of his Birth, has been obliged to go out of the Kingdom, because he found that he could not live in it with honour. And if it be true, that this Prin∣ces Mother, was guilty of what was laid to her charge, we may presume, that all that has befallen her, is the effect of Divine justice, which doth not suffer that Crimes of this nature should continue unpunished.</P>
<P><HI>Madamoiselle de Soissons,</HI> was not the only Person whose Conduct the King endeavoured to reform; he took much the same measures with <HI>Madam de la Force,</HI> who is one of the two Daughters which the late Marquis <HI>de Castelmoron</HI> had left be∣hind him; the other was married to the Marquis <HI>de Bricquemau,</HI> a Name well know among the French Protestants, as well as that of <HI>de la Force.</HI> But that Religion being now prohibited, the Marquis <HI>de Bricquemau,</HI> thought fit to obey the King,
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
who Commanded all his Subjects to be Roman Ca∣tholicks.</P>
<P><HI>Madamoiselle de la Force,</HI> had already had many Intrigues, which had made much noise; and a∣mong others, those with the Marquis <HI>de Nesle,</HI> and with the President <HI>de Brion's</HI> Son. This last had disgraced her yet more than the other; be∣cause this President's Son, was but of a very mean extract in comparison of her. For without having recourse to the idle fancies of the Family of <HI>la Force,</HI> which pretends to be descended of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> about which the Genea∣logists are not agreed; or to what is pretended, that the name of <HI>Nompart</HI> which they bear, with that of <HI>Caumont,</HI> was given them, because one of their Ancestors killed a Dragon, which de∣stroyed all that Country, where their chief Pos∣sessions and Interests in Land do now lie: I say, that without laying any stress on these things, it is certain that the Family of <HI>la Force,</HI> is a very Illustrious and a very Antient Family. It has produced two Mareschals of <HI>France,</HI> the one just after the other; of the first of which, the Father <HI>Mainbourg</HI> has given us a History, which he has composed after his own fancy, in his Book of <HI>Calvinism;</HI> but he is so often mistaken in every thing, that he has Written, that a Man must be at pains to compose as many Volumes as he has done, if he would take in hand to discover all his Mistakes. But since we have occasion here, to speak of this Mareschal, who was called <HI>James,</HI> I shall give a true and genuine account of what befel him, at the Massacre of St. <HI>Bartho∣lomew,</HI> quite different from what is given by that Jesuit.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> IX. having formed a design, to catch all the Protestants of <HI>France</HI> in one Net, and at the same time; made as many of them as he could, espe∣cially of the leading Men among them, come to
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
Court, that he might cause them to be murdered (so to speak) in his own sight; while by his Or∣ders, the same was to be done, upon the same day and at the same hour, in all the parts of the Kingdom: It is not my business, to tell here how it was possible, that such a Design could be executed, without being discovered before hand to those against whom it was formed; besides, that though I should make all the plausible Con∣jectures imaginable, I could not expect to succeed better, than they have done, who have beat their Brains to tell us their Conjectures about it; and at last I should be forced to confess, as they do, that it was a thing that God had resolved from all Eterni∣ty, and that he put a vail before the Eyes of all those who were appointed to suffer, that they might not know the imminent dangers that threatned them. However this be, <HI>James</HI>'s Father being come to <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> where he was called by the King, and having brought along with him his two Sons, <HI>viz. James</HI> and his elder Brother; he and they were among the first who were assassinated. <HI>James</HI> was but Fourteen Years old, but was of a much readier wit, than is usual for Boys of that age, and he seigned himself dead, upon his receiving the first blow; that was the reason why he was left there, and had no more wounds given him; and lying stretched out at full length between his Father and his Brother, who were killed dead, he had also so much presence of mindas to take off a Diamond of great value, which his Father had upon his Finger, and to put it in his Mouth, with an other which he had himself; for he did not doubt, but the People would soon come and strip them, and take every thing that was about them; and he was affraid, that if he should keep nothing for getting his Wound cured, and for main∣taining himself in some private place, till the storm were over, he might come to be starved to death. It happened just so as he had guessed would:
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
all the People about the <HI>Louvre,</HI> where his Fa∣ther was lodged, hearing what had been done, came immediately to make all the advantages they could of the Cloaths of these murdered Protestants. The Master of a Tennis Court, that was in that part of the Town, who knew Monsieur <HI>de la Force's</HI> Sons, because they had play'd sometimes at the Tennis, which he kept, happened by good luck to come to their House, when he was going a pillaging as well as others: He was so touched with compassion, when he saw them in that condition, that he cry'd out and spoke of it aloud, though he was all alone.</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who knew him, thought that he might trust himself with him, and tell him, that he was not as yet dead. The Master of the Tennis, being overjoyed to see him yet alive, bid him get up and go along with him; and promised to keep him in his House, and that he should not at all discover him, but that he should be in as great safety with him as ever he had been in his own Father's house; but because he had no Cloak to give him, and that he could not go out, naked as he was, for another had already stript him of his Cloaths; <HI>James</HI> therefore, desir'd him to go and seek for one to him, and to bring a Lanthorn with him, that he might have the grea∣ter Benefit of his kind Offers. The Master of the Tennis, brought him all that he had desired, and a Hat also; and making him go before him, as if he had been his Boy; he brought him to his house, where his Wife asked him, who he was; he told her, that she was not concerned to know that, and that she had nothing to do, but to use him kindly. She judged by this, that he was some Hu∣guenot of Note; which she was yet more perswa∣ded of, when upon his Finger, she saw the Dia∣monds which he had sav'd, and she coveted very much to have them; but not knowing any other way, how to come by them, she began to say to her Husband, that she was very desirous he should
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
put him out of doors; that she could not suffer him any longer to expose himself, for his sake, to those Inconveniencies that would inevitably befal him, if it should ever come to be known, that he had harboured such a Guest. Her Hus∣band, who had been forced to tell her who he was, that the hopes she might have, of being well re∣warded one day, might give her satisfaction; en∣deavoured to satisfie her with the same hopes. But she had rather have what was present, than what was but to come, and she continued to press him that he would rid himself of this Stranger; telling him, that it seem'd he knew not well what he was doing, when he put himself into so great hazard, without any prospect of ad∣vantage. The Tennis-court keeper, finding, that he could not satisfie her with Reason, advertised <HI>James</HI> of it, that he might choose rather to go else∣where, than to expose himself to new Dangers. <HI>La Force</HI> answered him, that he would soon find a Remedy for that: He knew that this Woman coveted his Diamonds, because she had many times spoken to him of them; he therefore gave her one of them, which procured him peace and quiet for some days. But because, that which he had kept to himself, was the finest of the two, and that he had given her only the least, her wicked hu∣mour returned very soon, insomuch that she di∣sturbed her Husband with her Importunities, as much as before. He who was a man of much ho∣nesty, could not approve of her Behaviour, and reproved her sharply for it. But finding that she persevered in her Covetousness, and that she va∣lued her Interest, more than any other thing, he spoke to <HI>Monsieur de la Force,</HI> that he might have a care, not to make a Present to her of the other Diamond, and he told him, that it would be much better for him, that he should go to one of his Friends houses, and that if he knew any of them
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
with whom he could trust himself; he would go himself, and ask him if he could be in safety at his house: <HI>Monsieur de la Force</HI> answered him, that he knew none, but <HI>Monsieur de Biron,</HI> and he en∣treated him to go to his house as from him; and that he knew him to be so generous, that he hoped, he would make no difficulty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o shelter him. The Master of the Tennis-court went thither, and ha∣ving asked a private Audience of him, he was surprised, and overjoyed at the same time, when he told him, that the young <HI>La Force</HI> was still alive. <HI>Monsieur de Biron</HI> desired, that he might come so soon as conveniently he could: he came to his house immediately; and that he might not be discovered, <HI>Monsieur de Biron,</HI> after he had discoursed a little with him, put him in his Livery as one of his Pages, and sent him to <HI>Biron.</HI> He was cured of the Wound, he received at the Massacre, and having taken Post, he stay'd in <HI>Guyenne,</HI> till the Persecution of the Protestants was over. He went afterwards to the War, where he signalized himself so gloriously, that he came to be in greater esteem than any of his Predecessors had ever been. And he came to be so much in favour with <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, that he was made Master of the Kings Wardrobe, and Captain of his Life∣guards. He afterwards married <HI>Monsieur de Biron</HI>'s Daughter, in gratitude to him, for having shel∣ter'd him, when he was in hazard of his Life; and at last he was advanced to the Dignity of Duke, and Peer, and Marshal of <HI>France.</HI> He died when he was Eighty years of Age, Loaded with Riches and Honour. His Son enjoyed all the same Honours, and having but one Daughter, she was married to <HI>Monsieur de Turenne.</HI> The Dutchy of <HI>la Force</HI> fell to the Posterity of <HI>James</HI>'s second Son, who enjoy it at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
<HI>Madamoiselle de la Force,</HI> of whom we are now discoursing, was descended also of the same <HI>James,</HI> who was her Grandfather; but her way of living being altogether unworthy of the Grandchild of so great a Man, who had lived always like a Man of true Honour and Vertue; the King cau∣sed a Complement to be made her, much like to that, which had been made to <HI>Madamoiselle de Soissons;</HI> he ordered that it should be told her, that there were but two things, of which she might choose one, that was, either to go out of the King∣dom, or to go in to a Convent: such an Order as this, was like a Thunderbolt to this young La∣dy. But as there is no disputing with the King, she chose the Convent; upon condition always, that His Majesty should give her, wherewith to pay her Board. For though she had many In∣trigues in her time, yet she was so much a Beggar, that she had not wherewith to maintain herself: Perhaps, had she been richer, she would not have gone and buried herself alive, within the Walls of a Cloyster; but as Necessity forces many People to do many things, which otherwise they would not incline to; it was impossible for her to take any other course, than what she did. There was one <HI>Madam Thaumur,</HI> who underwent the same Fate, though she was married, and her Hus∣band Captain of the Gallies of <HI>Versailles;</HI> yet he was so good natured, as never to complain of her Conduct. But the King, who had declared open∣ly before all the Court, that he would not suffer any Person, to give ill Example to another, knowing that himself was charitable enough, to comfort an old <HI>Suisse</HI> for the loss of his Wife, caused her to be shut up among the penitent Maids.</P>
<P>This frighted a great many Women, whose Conduct was nothing better than hers; while all good People approved of his Majesty's Re∣solution, for the Reformation of Manners.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
He commanded the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> that in his Station, he should vigorously pursue the same design as well as he did. That Prelate gave Or∣ders to the Clergy of that great City, that every one of them should enquire diligently, within the bounds of his Parish, after those who lived licen∣tiously, whether under the pretence of their Great∣ness, or under pretence of Clandestine Marriage. His Majesty's Care extended also, farther than this Capital City; for he sent the same Orders to all the Bishops of the Kingdom. The Bishop of <HI>Angers</HI> had a Man in his Diocess, who was ra∣ther rich than of Quality, and who was in one of these two Cases. It was the Count <HI>de Serran,</HI> who had been Chancellor of <HI>Monteur:</HI> he lived familiarly with one <HI>Madam Racapee;</HI> but it was not known how they came to live together, whe∣ther they lived in Whoredom, or if there had been a Clandestine Marriage between them; for these sorts of Marriages are much in fashion at this time, insomuch, that we seldom hear of any other. The Bishop went and paid him a visit, as he us'd frequently to do; but after he had dined with him, and with this Lady, who ordered all the Affairs of his house; he told him, that he would not de∣lay any longer to acquaint him, with the Reasons that had obliged him to pay him that visit. That His Majesty had commanded him to enquire of him, what was the Relation he was in to that Lady, who had the trust of every thing in his house. For if she served him only for his pleasure, and was not married to him, he must resolve never to see her any more. The Count <HI>de Serran</HI> knowing that his Wealth, which made him absolute in that Coun∣try, could do him no service, in shifting a que∣stion that was put to him in the Kings Name; was forced to own, that they were mar∣ried together. The Bishop answered him, that his owning of the Marriage was something, and
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
that he could discourse willingly with him upon the reasons, which he offered him at the same time, for hav∣ing so long concealed it; but that all that was not e∣nough, for such an Answer, as he must give the King. That if it were only he, who as Bishop of the place, came to enquire after it; he would be∣lieve it, upon his word; but since his business was with the King, it was absolutely necessary to shew other Proofs for it. The Count hearing him speak after such a manner, went and searched for the Marriage-contract, which he had made with this Lady, and shewed him at the same time, a Certificate of their Marriage. He asked for no more, and having given an Account of it to the King, it has produ∣ced so good an effect, that this Count owns it o∣penly in his Family; so that Madam <HI>de Racapee,</HI> is now considered as his Lady.</P>
<P>About this time, the City of <HI>Paris</HI> came to have one of its principal Magistrates changed, though this Office be neither ancient nor honourable; I mean the Office of <HI>Lieutenant de Police,</HI> which was at its first Institution, in the year 1667. bestowed upon <HI>Monsieur de la Reinie,</HI> who is still alive. For there was never any such Magistrate before that time, and all the parts of that Office were performed by the <HI>Lieutenant Civil.</HI> But His Majesty considering, that in so great a City as this Metropolis, it was too great a Charge for one Man, to attend particular Affairs, and the more publick Concerns of the City at the same time; he created this new Office in his Favour. 'Tis true, Political Reasons obliged him to institute it, as much as Zeal for Justice did. For the King had found by experience, while he was under age, that this City alone, was capable by its example, to cause an Insurrection throughout the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Kingdom. And therefore, he thought fit, to have a Man there, of his own Appointment, in whom he might put con∣fidence, who might narrowly observe every thing that was done in the City. He settled Twelve Thou∣sand
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Franks a year upon this Magistrate; and <HI>Mon∣sieur de la Reinie,</HI> after he had discharged this Office, for at least 25 years, becoming old, and perhaps that he might complement the chief Minister of State, desired him some years ago, that he would give him his Nephew <HI>Monsieur de Bignon</HI> for his Coadjutor.</P>
<P>As this Office, gives a Man much Authority and Interest at Court, upon which he immediately de∣pends; therefore, <HI>Monsieur Bignon,</HI> who is now In∣tendant of <HI>Picardy,</HI> accepted of it, by the Advice of his Parents and Friends; but being of a Family, that has been always obliging and full of huma∣nity, he became soon wearied of it; for he saw, that he could not discharge that Office, unless, he be∣came severe and rigorous, and therefore, he made an Interest, to be Intendant of a Province, and ob∣tained that of <HI>Amie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> In the mean while, <HI>Mon∣sieur de Reinie</HI> growing now very old, for he is about Eighty years of Age, supplicated anew, that he might be eased of this Burden, and that he might be allowed to sell his Office. The King granted his request, upon condition, that he should resign in favour of <HI>Monsieur d' Argenson.</HI> This Gentleman is of much better Quality than <HI>Monsieur de la Reinie,</HI> and falls nothing short of him, as to good sense; be∣sides, that he has all necessary Qualities to make himself to be feared, and his very Presence strikes dread, if it doth not create respect. His Father had been the Kings Embassador to the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> and his Ancestors were equally famous for the Gown and for the Sword; but 'tis seldom that a Man grows rich by Embassies, and his Father who is still alive, spent a good part of his own Estate in that Em∣ployment; so that his Son had been forced to ac∣cept of an Office, that was below him, that is, to be Lieutenant General of <HI>Limoges;</HI> but his good Fortune having brought him to Court, and having got some Commissions, of which he so acquitted him∣self,
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
that the Court was fully satisfied with what he had done, he thereby opened the way to this Employment we are now speaking of: The Lieu∣tenant <HI>de Police</HI> is answerable to the Parliament of <HI>Paris;</HI> and therefore <HI>Monsieur D' Argenson,</HI> some days, after he had entered upon his Office, went and pay'd a visit to the chief President, and begged the honour of his Protection. This Magistrate, who has a grave Aspect and affects to appear graver than he truly is, received him the same way, that he uses to receive all other People, and heard his Complement without so much as moving an Eyebrow: finding that he had done with it, made him no answer but these Three Words, <HI>Safety, Cleanness, Light;</HI> and im∣mediately turned his back upon him. <HI>Monsieur D' Argenson</HI> would have been more surprised, if he had not known his Character; but having known it of a long time, he returned home, thinking what could be the meaning of these Three Words, and he soon found it out. He understood easily that by the first, he meant, that he should take care of the night Watch, that no Robberies or Murders by Night might be heard of in the City. By the Second, that he should take care, that those who had the charge of clean∣sing the Streets, should punctually do their duty; and by the Third, that he should do the same, as to those, who have the charge of the Lan∣thorns: These Three parts of this Office, made <HI>Monsieur Bignon</HI> nauseate it; and there were also some other things in it, that were no less disa∣greable to such a Man as he is.</P>
<P>However, his niceness, was much to <HI>Monsieur de la Reinie's</HI> advantage, for he got Fifty Thou∣sand Crowns from <HI>Monsieur D' Argenson,</HI> for re∣signing his place to him; and he would have got much more, had not the King determined the Price. The Lieutenant <HI>de Police</HI> pays no yearly
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
Tax to the King for his Office, as all the Offices of Long Robe do, except the Chancellor, the Chief Presi∣dent of Parliament; and . . . . . And the King gave <HI>Monsieur D'Argenson,</HI> a Warrant of Retension for a Hundred Thousand <HI>Franks;</HI> He enter'd upon the Exercise of it, by declaring War against all those, whether Men or Women, that used to play at Lansquenet; He had express Orders for this, from his Majesty; because he had observed, that in some Years before, that unhappy Game, as well as the other Game of Basset; had ruin'd a great number of the Officers of his Army, who had been forced to quit their Companies, be∣cause, they had lost all the Money, with which, they should have raised Recruits.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Bignon</HI> Counsellor of State, who was the Father of that Gentleman I was just now speaking of; came to die suddenly, about this time, without having any time to prepare himself for another World: He had gone to bed at Night, af∣ter having taken his Supper as he used to do, without complaining of any Pain or Sickness; but the next Morning, he was found dead in his Bed. The Office of State which he had enjoyed, would have been very convenient for his Son, who had nothing else to hope for, by his Death; for all his Estate was not sufficient to pay his Debts; But because the King had declared long ago, that he would not at all, make those Offices like He∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itary ones, to descend from Father to Son, he therefore, thought it his interest to proceed cautiously in this matter, and to take prudent measures, before he should address himself to the King for it. It was easier for him, than it would have been for another Man, to bring about this design; because he was the Nephew of <HI>Monsieur de Ponchartrain,</HI> who had served the King to very good purpose, ever since the time that he was made Comptrollor-General, in the place o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
<HI>Monsieur le Pelletier.</HI> There were few, who could have acquitted themselves in so difficult a post, with so much Art and Success, as he has done, at a time, when the publick Affairs were in such a posture, as they have always been in since he was called to it. Tis certainly matter of Wonder and of Amazement at the same time, to see the dif∣ference betwixt the way of managing the King's Revenues at this time, and that which was taken under the Ministry of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin.</HI> For when there was need but of a Million, they were at incredible pains and toil, to contrive a way how to raise it: Those who are acquainted with the History of those times, know, that when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was taken in the year 1658. it could not be ran∣somed out of the Hands of the <HI>English,</HI> because we had not Three Millions of Money to give for it; for which Sum we could have recovered it, by vir∣tue of a secret Treaty with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> so that the King was forced to add a Million more to that Sum, when he redeemed it some Years after: Besides, it was needful then, to use all the Political Arts and Pretences imaginable, before that such a Sum could be raised Whereas now, if the King had use for Fifty Millions, he has nothing to do but to speak the word, and he has it, so to speak, in a Quarter of an Hour. However, <HI>Monsieur Pontchartrain</HI> did not rely so much upon his own Merits, as upon that account to flatter himself with the hopes of obtaining this fa∣vour to his Nephew, because of some difficulties which he foresaw must be removed, before he could speak of it to his Majesty: The great difficulty was, that the King had promised to <HI>Monsieur de Caumartin,</HI> Intendant of the Kings Revenues, the first place that should fall void, among the Counsellors of State: He knew that the King was mindful of his Promises, and that he would not forget them, but for very good Reasons; and therefore, he spake to <HI>Monsieur de Cau∣martin,</HI> and told him, he would oblige him very much,
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
if he would quit his Pretensions in Favour of his Ne∣phew. As every Man loves to oblige a Minister of State, so <HI>Monsieur Caumartin,</HI> promised not to do any thing, that could put his Majesty in mind of what he had promised him, but the King remembred it himself; so that when <HI>Monsieur de Ponchartrain</HI> spoke to him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnon,</HI> he answered, that he was very sorry he could not grant what he asked of him, but there were two Reasons that hindred him from doing it. The one was, that he had resol∣ved not to set th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Offices pass from Father to Son: The ohter was, that he was under a promise to give <HI>Monsieur Caumartin,</HI> the first of those places that should f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. So <HI>Monsieur Caumartin</HI> was made Coun∣sellor of State, though he was willing to have re∣nounced it, at <HI>Monsieur de Pontchartrain</HI>'s desire. The first time that he sat in Council, he pretended to take his Place, as if he had been always there, from the first Day he was named Intendant of the Reve∣nues, because these Intendants have a Brief of the Crown. as Counsellors of State; but those whom he would have taken place of, if he had succeeded in his Claim, opposing him in that matter, the Chan∣cellor, who was proper Judge in it, determined it in their Favour. Two or Three days before <HI>Monsieur de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnon's</HI> Death, his Brother, who was chief Presi∣dent of the great Council, fell sick, when his sickness appeared dangerous, (for he died of it within Six or Seven days after,) no body would tell him, what had befallen his Brother, lest he should become Appre∣hensive that he should soon follow him.</P>
<P>But because his Brother had come to see him in the beginning of his Sickness, but could not come af∣terwards, (for he was in his Grave) he asked the only Daughter he had, if he had already forgotten him. He had married this Daughter to <HI>Monsieur de Verthamont,</HI> Master of Requests, who was already one of the Richest Men that wore a Gown, but who came to be much Richer by succeeding him in
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
his Estate; for this <HI>Monsieur Bignon</HI> had incompara∣bly a greater Estate than his elder Brother: He was worth at least Four Hundred Thousand Crowns; yet his Daughter was nothing the hap∣pier for that, for her Husband did not love her at all: either because he thought she had not Beauty enough to deserve that he should love her; or be∣cause he was too much inclin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching to love a Wife; for it was known that he had Mistress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and she was forced to behave herself obligingly to them, and to keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with them, that so she might be often in company with her Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>band, for she had as much Affection for him, as he had Indifferency for her.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur de Verthamont's</HI> Inclinations to the Fe∣male Sex, his been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough known, of a long time; though somewhile and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell thereby into such an Inconvent me, as might have discouraged him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. He was in love with a young Girl, that had so me Brothers, who were Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. She was, at least of as good a Family as had as, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was a vast diff∣rence betwixt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is Fortunes; and the was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poor as he was rich: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Sister to comply with him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Measures as should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to give her a Por∣tion. Perhaps she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> though they had not advised her to it; and if we may be∣lieve what is repor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of her, she loved him, as much as he loved her. However this Girl having given him an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is surprised him with her, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hard up∣on him, if he would not do them Justice. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offer∣ed them a considerable Sum of Mercy, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would let him go. He had it not about him, for it was a greater Sum than a Man usually carries in his Pocket; but having given them his No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he thought it even best to pay it, without more ado, that his misfortunes might not come to be talked of:</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69"/>
If a certain Knight of the Holy Ghost, who is now at Court, could have thus compounded the matter with his Lady's Brothers, perhaps he had never married her; But these Gentlemen were not for capitulating on such Terms, as the Brothers of the former Girl had done; he was forced against his Will, to yield to their Terms; besides that, it may be, his Note would not have been so well an∣swered as was <HI>Monsieur de Verthamont</HI>▪s.</P>
<P>But that I may not go farther from my Subject; I say, that this Magistrate's Lady, having by some pretence or other, satisfied her Father, when he complained, that his Brother came not to see him; he died, without knowing that he was gone before him, and that he had payed that debt, that all men must necessarily pay. Though his Office was but of a late Creation, yet there were abundance of Candidates for it: for the place of Chief Presi∣dent, and especially, of such a famous Society as is the Great Council, is not to be slighted, when there is a fair opportunity of obtaining it. But the King, who has always a great regard to the Chil∣dren of his Ministers, when the Offices they have enjoyed, may, without any bad Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equence be dis∣posed of, as if they were hereditary, bestowed it upon Monsieur <HI>de Verthamont.</HI> For the reason why the Places of Counsellors of State should not be so disposed of, is, that if the King should let them descend to the Children, or to the nearest Kins∣men, he should not have, wherewith to reward those who serve him faithfully in the Counsel, and in the other Offices of the Gown. For they serve not for any other end, but that one day they may come to be Counsellors of State; at least, the hopes of this, has been their great motive for some time past; because we see, that the King has chosen Two or Three of that Body to be Chan∣cellors of the Kingdom, and therefore, every one strives to recommend himself to his Majesty, by his
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
diligence in his Service; whether in the Inten∣dancies, or in any other Commissions. We may easily be convinced, how much it is for the Kings Interest, to have Persons of this sort about him; and perhaps he should not find them so exact and punctual, in the discharge of their Duty, if it were not, that they have always that recompence in their View, as the fruit of all their Labours.</P>
<P>There were Two other Brothers, died some days after the death of the Two <HI>Bignons,</HI> and there was one strange thing observed of them; that never any thing happened to the one, but what befel the other at the same time: they were Twins, and so like one another in the Face, that had not the one been a Soldier, and the other a Lawyer, so that their different Garbs made them known, the one would have been often taken for the other. They were both much given to gaming, and if one lost his mo∣ney, it was sure the other lost his also, at the same time. When he who went to the Army was wound∣ed, the other was wounded also by a fall, or some other Accident. If the one had a Mistress that jilted him, the other met with the same Treat∣ment from his. In a word, all the difference that ever was taken notice of, was, that the one con∣tinued a Batchelor, much longer than the other; and there was nothing wanting in their whole life, but that one thing, to justifie what is ordinarily said of Children, that are born at the same Birth; That whatever happens to the one, inevitably be∣fals the other. But perhaps he who continued a Batchelor so long after the other was married, did so, because he thought his Brother not very happy in his Marriage. There are some Wives, who give no great Encouragement to Men, to ven∣ture upon Marriage, especially, when they set up for Wits, and will pass a judgment upon every thing. It is the two <HI>Bauquemars</HI> of whom I am now

not very becoming a Princess of the Blood, and especially a Grand-daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. the King, I say, considering her Poverty, and that besides, she had some Reasons for her Claim, which seem'd to answer his own Reasons, told her, that if she pleased, he would let her enjoy her Sister's Estate during her Life, upon condition, that she should re∣nounce the Property of it. This Princess, who de∣sired only to be rich by the Revenue, without troubling her self, with what might happen after her Death, consented very willingly to this Propo∣sal. But His Majesty has since that time, had some scruples of Conscience, because he had only given her the Profits of that Estate during her Life, which perhaps belonged to her in Property, and there∣fore, he has resigned the Property in her Favour, as he had formerly done the Revenue. This tenderness of Conscience, that will not allow this Prince to do any thing, for which it may reproach him, had made him reflect often, upon many things, that had passed during his Reign, which might be re∣presented in other Colours than those were, which had been made use of to perswade him to under∣take them. He saw, that his whole Kingdom was in a Flame, and that there was no other way to extinguish it, but by restoring a great number of Places, which his Enemies alleged he had taken only by force of Arms; and because he found it for his own conveniency to have them, without having any other right to them. If he had pleased, he might perhaps not only have let all <HI>Europe</HI> see the contrary, since he can give good reasons for what he has done; but he could have also main∣tain'd his right to those Places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y his Arms, since in despite of the prodigious Consederacy that has been form'd against him, he has always had the advantage of his Enemies, ever since he first per∣ceived their Designs against his Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/>
However, as His Majesty has of a long time been chiefly concerned with his eternal Sal∣vation; the care of which, has made many scru∣ples arise in his Conscience: So, we admired and were astonished to see, that on a sudden, he had offered to deliver up the Towns of <HI>Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Luxenburg,</HI> which were the strongest Barriers of his Kingdom; Nay, he offered also to deliver up many others, which it must be confessed, were ta∣ken airly, with Sword in hand, when his Enemies were Witnesses of his Victories, and could no lon∣ger resist his Arms, though they were all as∣sembled against him; so that it seems just to say, that he had a right to keep them or at least, to demand the Equivalent of them But the King considered, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would break this dreadful Conspiracy, and restore Peace to his People, who groan'd under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Burthen of the most cruel War, that ever was raised against any Soveraign, he must part with his own Interests He had sent long ago, the <HI>Steu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Calli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> to make Pro∣posals of Peace. He addressed himself to that Peo∣ple, rather than to any others; because he knew that the States, which subsist only by Trade, would hearken sooner, than any of the rest would do, when one spoke to them of putting an end to a War, which troubled them upon all quarters. Be∣sides, the <HI>Dutch</HI> could gain nothing, by the Con∣tinuance of it; for they were not like the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which flatters it self, that by the Conti∣nuance of War, it shall at last recover that su∣preme Power, that it once had in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. There was not one of the All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, except only this House, who could hope to make any ad∣vantage of what was then doing in <HI>Europe.</HI> In∣somuch, that it may be justly said, that all the Princes who were in that Confederacy, had taken up Arms, only for the Interests of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> for all the Conquests they could hope
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
for from the King, must have belonged to it. And though the Princes of the Empire had other Pre∣tensions; yet, seeing they find by long experience, that the Emperor makes use of them (if I may be allowed to speak so) only as the Ape made use of the Cat's Foot, to take the Chesnuts out of the Fire; and that he has always known how to make use of the Right of Sequestration (to which he pretends) to his own advantage and their loss, and that at the Peace of <HI>Nimiguen,</HI> he kept <HI>Philipsburg</HI> to him∣self, though it belonged to the Bishop of <HI>Spire:</HI> They could therefore easily see, that they exhau∣sted themselves only for his sake, and that they could expect no Benefit by it themselves. And though they had run headlong into the Confederacy against his Majesty, when it was propos'd to them; yet, that was only, because of the Fears they were under, from the Greatness of his Power. They con∣sidered, that it was their misfortune, to have their Do∣minions lying between Two Princes, whom they ought equally to suspect; and that they should do best to declare against him, who seemed to be in the greatest readiness to ruine them, rather than against the other, who was not as yet, in a condition to hurt them. These were the considerations that for∣med the Bonds, which united them so firmly with the Emperor; and which became the more indis∣soluble, that his Imperial Majesty found a way, how to keep these Princes in a dependance upon him, by making them believe, that the King had violated the Treaties of <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Nimiguen,</HI> and was a sworn Enemy of the Empire. It was not in His Majesty's Power at that time, to address himself either to them, to inform them of his good Intentions; or to the <HI>English,</HI> because they had set a Prince upon their Throne, whom His Majesty had not acknowledged as their lawful King; and whom he also considered as the very Soul of the confederacy, that had been form'd against him. It
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
is true, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had a sort of dependance up∣on this new King, both because he was their State∣holder, and because of a strict Union between him and the chief Men of their Republick. Yet, as His Majesty was resolved to acknowledge this Prince at last for King of <HI>England,</HI> so he believed, that what Bonds soever might be betwixt him and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they would never coldly entertain the Pro∣posals, which he cesigned to make them; especially, when they should see, that by removing this one Obstacle, there would be no great difficulty to ob∣tain a general Peace: And truly, <HI>Monsieur de Cal∣lieres</HI> needed not to have been at great pains, to make them sensible, what were like to be the ill Consequences of the War, as well for themselves, as for the Princes of the Empire; that he might thereby perswade them, that it was their Interest to concur with His Majesty, in restoring Peace to <HI>Europe.</HI> They knew their own Interests too well, not to be sensible, that their own Safety, as well as the Safety of many other Potentates consisted in keeping <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Austria</HI> in a Ballance, or to speak more properly, in keeping them in equality to one another; seeing they serve as Counter∣weights, to all the Princes of <HI>Christendom,</HI> to save them from falling under the Power, either of the one or the other. For just as in a Ballance, we see, that when one side is much heavier than the other, if a sufficient Weight be put into that other Scale, then both are equal; so has it always been, since these Two Families interfered with one a∣nother. All the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> have acted by the same Rule, in assisting the weakest of the Two, and putting a stop to the growing Power of the o∣ther. And this Maxim is observed at this time; and has put the Sword in the Hands of so many Potentates, who were formerly in His Majesty's Interests; especially the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and the Prin∣ces of the Empire, who found no Protection, either
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
so ready, or so safe, as his was; when they were like to have been subjected to the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>However, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> finding by the Proposals the King made, and his Offers to deliver up so ma∣ny Places, that if they could not bring these Two Houses to a just Equality, yet, they should at least make a Peace, upon such Terms, as that they need∣ed not be so very much afraid of His Majesty's Power, they gave <HI>Monsieur Callieres</HI> a very favour∣able Reception: yet they would not grant him a Passport, but by allowance from the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> And before they would enter into any Conferences with him, they would first see, if the Powers, he had brought from His Majesty, were in good form. But they could be in no better form, than they were, since they were seal∣ed with the Great Seal of <HI>France.</HI> There was one thing, that much hindred this Treaty, which was, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would do nothing, with∣out the Consent of <HI>England,</HI> and their other Allies. But this was nothing but what <HI>Monsieur Callieres</HI> expected. For before he came from <HI>France,</HI> he doubted very much, that he could perswade them to enter into a separate Treaty with the King. Yet, that had been done, at the Treaty of <HI>Ni∣meguen;</HI> where his Majesty's Plenipotentiaries found a way, how to make them jealous of the Prince of <HI>Oran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>'s Power; so that they made hast to make a separate Peace, which did soon oblige all the other Allies to an Accommodation with the King. But it was not fit at this time, so much as to propose what they were able then to effectuate. The <HI>Dutch</HI> became sensible of their mistake, and they would take care, not to fall in∣to it again. But <HI>Callieres,</HI> who as I have said, had considered of this before, and who had Or∣ders from the King, not at all to acknowledge the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> for King of <HI>England,</HI> till he should be assured of the Peace; found out an ex∣pedient,
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
for reconciling the Orders he had from the King his Master, with this difficulty which the <HI>Dutch</HI> made, not to treat without the Con∣sent of their Allies. It was, that they should not come to a final Conclusion in any thing, without their Approbation; but if they found reason to agree to any thing, they might communicate it to them; and that convenient measures might be taken afterwards. There was no Inconveniency in following this Advice, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were sa∣tisfied with it, and by Consent of their Allies too. They demanded, as Preliminaries of this Treaty, the Restitution of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and of the Towns of <HI>Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Luxenbourg. Callieres</HI> consented in the Kings Name, both to the one and the other; but upon Condition, that <HI>Lorrain</HI> should be resto∣red to the Duke of that Name; upon such Terms, as had been agreed to, at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen:</HI> The President Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, who took care of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain's</HI> Interests in <HI>Holland,</HI> opposed this; under Pretence, that when his Master engaged in the Confederacy, it was promised, that Peace should never be made, till he had full Satisfaction. He represented to the Confederates, that if his Dominions were not restored to him, but upon the Terms of the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> he should be so far from reaping any advantage by the Con∣federacy, that he should be a loser by it; since he could have made a much better market, had he taken other methods, by which he might have been put in possession of his Dominions before the War; but having thought himself oblig'd to follow his Fathers example, who would not hear of these Conditions, near Twenty Years ago; it was very hard for him, now, after so many Years, to find, that no better Conditions were offered him.</P>
<P>But as great Potentates, who are well pleased to engage those in their interests, who are much infe∣riour to them in Power, that they may be the more
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
successful in their designs; take not much care of their concerns, when they have no more use for them: so the Allies, after having spoke once or twice of this Affair, thought it not worth their while to insist any longer upon it: Mr. <HI>President Canon,</HI> gave in several Memoirs concerning it, and they told him, that they would take time to consider them, before any thing were concluded. And though the Empe∣rours Ministers joyned with him, for obtaining full satisfaction to this Duke; yet neither the one nor the other were able to effectuate any thing. Things being thus far advanced, upon the part of the Dutch; and the English having as strong Inclinations for a Peace as they had, because of the many Prizes that were taken from them at Sea, which had brought their Trade very low; It was agreed upon all Hands, that Plenipotentiaries should be named, for bringing that to perfection, which as yet was only begun; but they had some difficulty to agree upon the Place of the Congress. The Emperour would have had it, in some Town of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the King would not hear of that proposal: But his Imperial Majesty's great desire was, to Protract time, for he was not very desirous of the Peace; because so long as the War should last, he knew that he was Master of all the Princes of the Empire, who were obliged to obey his absolute Commands; and he was afraid, that if the Peace should be con∣cluded, they might come to open their Eyes, and be sensible of their true Interests; and to perceive, that in being so earnest, for the Increase of his Power, they should themselves be the Authors of his Usur∣pations upon their own Liberties and Prerogatives. But there was also another thing in his View, in which he consulted his own Interest, when he de∣sired, that the Treaty might be in some Town of the Empire; For since the Peace with <HI>Savoy,</HI> the King was superior in Forces to all the Confede∣rates; having sent all the Troops which had serv'd
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
in that Country, from thence into <HI>Germany:</HI> And the Emperour was afraid, lest <HI>Mentz</HI> should be be∣sieged; which would have been no difficult En∣terprize, had the King thought fit to employ his Forces that way.</P>
<P>But if he could not obtain, that <HI>Mentz</HI> should be the Place, yet he thought at least, they would be satisfied that <HI>Frankfort</HI> should be it. And that a Neutrality should be established, for 12 or 14 Leagues round about that Town, so that <HI>Mentz</HI> should be comprehended in it. But the King being stiff in this matter, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> having propos'd the <HI>Hague,</HI> for the Place of Meeting, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> agreed to, that those, whom His Maiesty should name for his Plenipo∣tentiaries, should reside at <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf,</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut One Leagues distant from it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were to be named by the other Princes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reside at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and that the Conferences should be kept at the Castle of <HI>Rys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick,</HI> which stands in the mid∣dle, and is equally distant from these Two Places.</P>
<P>Though the Emperor consented to this, as well as the rest of the Confederates; yet, it was a long time before he sent his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thither; which was a Proof, that he loved maner that the War should continue, than that a Peace should be conclu∣ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s for the King, he made no de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to name <HI>Mon∣sieur Courtin</HI> Counsellor of rate his Plenipotentiary; a Man every way capa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of such an Employment, and who had acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted himself very honourably in many Negotiations of great Importance: But he befought the King to excuse him in this, because he found his Eyes so bad, that it was to be fear'd, he should lose his sight altogether. It vexed the King to think that he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> look out for ano∣ther; and he was at pains to examine him, if perhaps there were some secret Reasons, which hindred him from embracing this Employment; but having at lust found, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in good ear∣nest; he nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in his place, <HI>Monsieur de Harlay,</HI> the Chancellor's Son-in-law, who is also a Coun∣sellor
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
of State: He gave him <HI>Monsieur do Creci</HI> for his Colleague, and honoured also <HI>Monsieur de Cal∣lieres</HI> with the same Title of Plenipotentiary. There were great things talk'd of this Man's Con∣duct; though I do not see, that there was need of much Art, to do all that he did; for a man has no occasion to show, how well he is qualified for Ne∣gotiations of State; unless he have to struggle with great difficulties, which at last he overcomes by his prudent Conduct, and brings the whole af∣fair to a happy Issue, for the Interest of the Prince that has imployed him: But this could not be said of <HI>Monsieur Callieres,</HI> who had made the Confe∣derates listen to his Proposals; only by promising in the Kings Name, that he would deliver up to them, a great number of Places, which they could not have been able to retake by force of Arms, in Twenty Years time, though they had been much stronger than they were. <HI>Monsieur de Harlay,</HI> had been already employed in some secret Negotiations, but had not been successful in them; but he and <HI>Monsieur Callieres,</HI> had a third Person joyned with them, in the great Affairs they were now to be employed in; who could direct and assist them, when they met with difficulties, that were too hard for them; I mean <HI>Monsieur de Creci,</HI> who is one of the best qualified Men in <HI>France,</HI> for Affairs of this nature. He and <HI>Monsieur de Harlay</HI> took their Journey together, that they might be at the place of the Congress in due time; but they were not very well satisfied with one anothers Compa∣ny; <HI>Monsieur de Harlay</HI> was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssatisfied, because <HI>Monsieur de Creci</HI>'s Reputation eclipsed his own; and <HI>Monsieur de Creci,</HI> because <HI>Monsieur de Harlay</HI> carried it so high, as if he had undervalued him.</P>
<P>The Dispositions they were both in made them soon give some Proofs, that they were dissatisfied with one another; for being come to <HI>L'Isle;</HI> there was
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
one <HI>Le Normand,</HI> a Farmer-General, who took up∣on him to Regale them; He was one of <HI>Monsieur de Creci</HI>'s Friends, upon which account he detain'd them there, a whole day longer, than they inten∣ded to have staid: And that they might not blame him, for making them lose so much time, he gave them Flying Coaches, to carry them Ten or Twelve Leagues farther on their Journey; but he put his Friend <HI>Monsieur de Creci</HI> into the finest Coach, with the finest Horses in it; while <HI>Monsieur de Harlay</HI> got but a sorry Coach, and Horses with such Col∣lars as draught Horses use to have instead of Har∣ness. This vexed <HI>Monsieur de Harlay</HI> very much, who presumed, that if there was any distinction to be made between them, it should have been to his advantage. The Farmer-General, might have per∣ceived by his looks, that he did not take it well of him, and he was heard to say behind his Back, that those who from nothing came to possess good Estates, could never learn to behave themselves like Gentlemen. However, he made use of the Coach and Horses, such as they were, but gave not many thanks to him who had provided them.</P>
<P>These Two Plenipotentiaries had met with a number of People, betwixt <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>L'Isle,</HI> who wished them a good Journey, and in the mean time besought them earnestly to put an end to their Miseries, by concluding a happy Peace. They were not at all surprized at this, for before they took their Journey, they knew, how much <HI>France</HI> need∣ed it. And we may easily judge, how much the Treasure of the Kingdom was exhausted, when we consider what Taxes and Subsidies must have been paid to the King, to enable him to resist so many Forces, as had conspired against him. He had no less than 500000 Men under Pay, by Sea and by Lard; which no doubt will appear incredible to Posterity: It was necessary, that People of all Ranks
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
and Conditions within the Kingdom, should bear their Proportionable share of this Burthen; so that in imposing the Taxes, there was a necessity to do every thing, so to speak, by Weight and Measure, that no man might be oppressed, or obliged to pay more than his Proportion. And this is what the King's Ministers have done, with so much Conduct and Prudence; that though every man is sensible of his own Loss; yet it is nothing, in comparison of what it would have been, if those Affairs had been managed by Persons of less Skill and Art, than they are. However, these Plenipotentiaries saw the same thing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that they had seen in <HI>France;</HI> that is, they saw, that the People there were no less weary of the War, than the <HI>French;</HI> They likewise besought them, with the greatest Earnestness, to use their utmost Endeavours for succeeding in the Treaty, which they were going to negotiate. At last they came to <HI>Delf,</HI> where the Houses were become so dear, since the People of that Town knew, that they were to come thi∣ther, that they could scarcely be had for Mo∣ney.</P>
<P>While these things were a doing, the Procura∣tor-General, whom the King had ordered to en∣quire into the matter of the Duel, that had been fought between the Bailist <HI>d' Auvergne</HI> and the <HI>Che∣valier de Kailus,</HI> gave him an Account of the Discovery, he had made in it: But it was not at all to their advantage: He reported, that ac∣cording to the <HI>Affidav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>'s that were made before him it was far from having been an accidental Rencounter, as their Parents had alledged; that never Duel was more clearly proved, and therefore he desired to know, what Orders His Majesty would give about it. His Majesty ordered, that they should be Arraigned, Indited and Tried as Crimi∣nals; so that the same Officer, having caused it to be published, through the City by sound of Trum∣pet;
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
as is usual upon such Occasions, the Parliament met, and outlawed them. By His Majesty's Edict against Duels, they ought to have been hang'd in Effigie. But the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng consented private∣ly to remit something of that Rigour, because of the Kindness he had for their Parents; and they were only condemned to lose their Heads, which was accordingly executed at the <HI>Greve,</HI> where their Pictures were put up, but were not suffered to be long there: For there were some People took them away about an hour after, that is, in the Twilight of the Evening. These sorts of things, are very or∣dinary in <HI>France;</HI> insomuch, that it's commonly said, that there is not one Great Family in the whole Kingdom, but what the like has happen'd to; and what has had Ladies and Daughters of naughty Lives. And therefore, the Parents of these Two unhappy young Gentlemen, were not much afflicted with the Loss of their Sons; nor were less in favour at Court, than they had been before▪ The Cardinal <HI>de Douillon,</HI> who is the Bailiff <HI>d' Au∣vergne</HI>'s Uncle, made a Jest of what his Nephew had dore; and of what had befallen him. In which his Eminence was not like many other people, who had rather be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gaged in the most difficult Affair in the World, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e accountable for a Duel. And it's certain, that the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssicurs de la Frette,</HI> could never extricate themselves out of those Troubles, which they brought upon themselves, 34 or 35 Years ago; by quarrelling with the Prince <HI>de Cha∣lais,</HI> as they were coming out of the <HI>Palais Royal.</HI> They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ght <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, but though all of them, or at least the greater part of them, were of the first Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lies of the Kingdom; nay, though the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe himself interceeded for a Remission to them, yet the King would never grant them one, so that some of them died, making their escape to one part, others to another, and of all those that were engaged in that Duel, I know none alive,
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
but the elder <HI>La Frette,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Flam∣marin.</HI> It is true, the Marquis <HI>d' Autin,</HI> the eldest Brother of <HI>Monsieur de Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pan,</HI> lost his Life in this Quarrel, having been wounded in the <HI>Vena cava,</HI> so that he died upon the spot. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Count <HI>d' Au∣vergne</HI> was afflicted for the loss of his Eldest Son, he was in some measure comforted, by what the Monks of <HI>Cluni</HI> did for one of his younger Sons, when he was not thinking of it. The Cardinal <HI>de Janson,</HI> the King's Ambassador at <HI>Rome,</HI> had de∣sired, that his Majesty might be pleased to recal him, and the Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> had got a Com∣mission to succeed him; and he being Abbot of <HI>Clu∣ni</HI> he visited that Abbey, as he was going to <HI>Rome.</HI> He is always very obliging, and engages all that know him to wish him well. So soon as he told these Monks, that he was going to <HI>Rome,</HI> and that perhaps, he might never see them any more, they replied, that they should be very sorry, if that should happen, but if it should be the good will of God so to order it, they would at least before they took leave of him, give a Testimony of the deep Sense they had of that Kindness and Concern, which his Eminence had always shown for them: They told him no more of it that day, but on the Morrow, they ordered that a Bell should be toll'd for a meeting of the Chapter, and then they chose <HI>Monsieur d' Auvergne,</HI> who is the Cardinal's Nephew, for his Coadjutor. They brought this good News to his Eminence, who knew not the cause of their meeting, and they told him at the same time, that since he was going to <HI>Rome,</HI> and that it belonged to the Pope to confirm their Election, they did not doubt, but he should obtain that favour of his Ho∣liness, when ever he thought fit to ask it; and they took leave of him, with this Compliment, for which his Eminence thanked them very heartily. For this is one of the most genteel and most honourable Abbies in <HI>France,</HI> though it be none of richest. Yet
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
it has Seven or Eight Thousand Livres of Revenue. But that, for which it is most to be valued, is, that it has Benefices, at it's Gift, to the value of near a Million of Revenue; so that the Abbot of this Place, has many opportunities, to make new Creatures to himself, and to reward those whom he has already.</P>
<P>The Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon</HI> would fain have carried along with him <HI>Monsieur de Coulanges,</HI> who is a pleasant sort of a man, and what he says, is ve∣ry diverting; he drinks, composes, and sings; and he has good Skill in Sauces and Ragoo's; and in a word, he knows how to spend his time agree∣ably, which makes many People desire his Com∣pany: He had once stay'd with his Eminence, in his Abbey of <HI>Pontoise,</HI> where he had always Peo∣ple of his own choice, at his Table. He had for∣merly travelled to <HI>Rome,</HI> with <HI>Monsieur de Chaulnes▪</HI> and he was as well known there to the Cardinals, as was the Ambassador himself. But he refused Cardinal <HI>Bouillon,</HI> what he had granted the other; and excused himself, under pretence of some Affairs: Whether, what he pretended, was true, or not, I cannot tell. The Instruction of greatest Impor∣tance, which his Eminence carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> was concerning the Affairs of <HI>Poland;</HI> where the que∣stion was, who should be chosen King of that King∣dom: Because <HI>John Sobieshi</HI> who had possessed that Throne since the Year 1674, died in 1697: He had left many Children by his Queen, whom he had married before he was promoted to the Royal Dig∣nity; her Maiden-Name was <HI>Francoise de Nation,</HI> Daughter of the Marquis <HI>d' Arquyen,</HI> of whose Family there was once a Mareshal of <HI>France,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Montigny.</HI> Her Birth should have united her closely to the <HI>French</HI> Interests. But Women resent the Affronts or the Refusals they meet with, more highly than others do. She had become an Enemy to the King long ago; because
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
he would not grant her the favour she desired of him, which was, to make her Father Duke and Peer of <HI>France;</HI> ever since which time, she has done all was in her power against <HI>France,</HI> and has not kept those measures, that Prudence and Civility obliged her to; insomuch, that she caused some Inso∣lencies to be done to the Marquis <HI>de Vitrich</HI> the King's Ambassador. The King her Husband, who tho' he was a man not only of as great Valour, as any in the World, but of great experience in War, of which he gave sufficient Proof, at his raising the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> when the Infidels besieged it, <HI>Ann,</HI> 1683. yet he was not a man of so much Prudence, in other Actions of his Life. For while he was upon the Throne, he behaved himself rather like a private man, than a Soveraign; his chief care was to hoard up Money, without taking any pains to make Creatures and Friends to himself, and his Children. He never considered, how ne∣cessary these were, for placing one of his Posterity upon the Throne, after his Death; or if he did consider this, he has thought, that they could al∣ways make themselves Friends, by the Treasures which he should leave them. And therefore, he sold all the Palatinates that came to be void; as well as every other thing, with which the for∣mer Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> used to gratifie the Nobi∣lity and Gentry of that Kingdom. These Practices, had alienated the hearts of his Subjects from him, as well those who had bought those Places, as those who expected to have had them in Gift, and with∣out Money: So that, his Children were far from having any ground to hope, that they should have the same good fortune that Three several Families, who possessed this Crown successively had formerly had; I mean the Families of <HI>Mamcllus, Jagellon</HI> and <HI>Pala∣tin,</HI> whose Children, so long as they had any, succeeded to the Throne; so that it did not pass into any other Family, than their own.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
However, the King having advice of all this, thought to place a Prince of his own Blood, upon that Throne, who was a Subject, and such a one too, as the <HI>Polanders</HI> must always have to be their King. For they are a People that soon despite their Prince, unless he be a brave Man, and capable to lead their Armies himself in Person, without which qualifica∣tion, he has buy a melancholy Life among them.</P>
<P>The last of the <HI>Palatins</HI> who enjoyed that Crown, was an Instance of this: And it's known, that this peo∣ple, obliged him to apdicate, so soon as they per∣ceived that his Conduct did not answer to that of his Ancestors. The Prince whom the King pro∣posed, was <HI>Francis Lewis de Bourbon</HI> Prince of <HI>Con∣ti;</HI> who in this War, which his Majesty had main∣tained against the greater part of <HI>Europe,</HI> has gi∣ven such extraordinary Proofs of his Valour and Con∣duct; that all the Army said openly, that the very Spirit and Soul of the late Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> his Un∣cle, who was one of the greatest Captains that ever <HI>France</HI> had, was return'd to this World, and had taken possession of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Body, that he might save his King and his Country from the Confederacy that was formed against them. I know that this way of expressing themselves, was altogether extraordinary and new; but as it was impossible for them to express more emphatically, the just E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cem they had for that Prince, as a sin∣gularly brave Man; so this way of speaking, passed so currant, and was so often repeated, that his Re∣putation for true Courage, is established in forreign Countries, as well as in <HI>France.</HI> Though this Prince is not rich, yet he sent 200000 Crowns of his own Money into <HI>Poland,</HI> to gain the Suffrages of those who had already Inclinations for him, on∣ly upon the Account of his great Fame. For, as this is the only time of Harvest with the great men of <HI>Poland,</HI> so a Prince needs never pretend to their
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
Crown, unless he will sow before hand, that they may reap the Fruits of it. The more that this Prince had of true merit, the more was <HI>Sobieski</HI>'s Widow-Queen, enraged against the King. She entertain'd hopes to have her eldest Son Prince <HI>James,</HI> chosen to succeed his Father; and for this very end, she had married him to a Sister of the Empress's, and of the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI>'s, that he might have the Emperors Assistance. But all the Assistance in the World, being of no use in that Country, unless it be supported with liberal Donatives, and she being narrow and penurious that way, as her Husband was. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> would have soon car∣ried it against Prince <HI>James,</HI> had there been no o∣ther Competitors for it.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> finding, that she could hard∣ly succeed in her designs for her eldest Son, en∣deavoured to perswade <HI>Monsieur l' Abbee de Polig∣nac,</HI> the French Ambassadour, to alter his mea∣sures, by offering, that if he would recommend the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI> to be chosen King, instead of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> she would unite her friends with his, upon condition, that the Duke, should marry her so soon as he was chosen. At the same time, she sent two of her Sons to <HI>Paris,</HI> under pretence of travelling, but her true designs was, that they might be Spies at the French Court; and might see, if the King was in such a Condition to support the Prince of <HI>Conti's</HI> pretensions, as the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> pretended. For it was repor∣ted in <HI>Poland,</HI> and almost in all foreign Countries, that <HI>France</HI> was drained both of Men and Money, and that it was so far from being able for such an undertaking, that it was upon the brink of ruin, unless a peace was speedily con∣cluded. The <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> gave the King an account of the Queen of <HI>Polands</HI> Proposals, but at the same time advised him not to trust her. And assur'd him, that she would rather make her
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
faction joyn with that of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> than with the Prince of <HI>Conti's.</HI> For she had so far forgotten, that she was a born Subject of <HI>France,</HI> that she thought of nothing so much, as how to embarass all his Majesty's Projects and Designs; In the mean time, the two Princes, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Constantine,</HI> younger Brothers of Prince <HI>James,</HI> came into <HI>France</HI> And that they might make the French Court entertain a better Opinion of their Mother, than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did from the Account that the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> had given of her, they brought along with them, near three Millions of Gold, and put Eight hundred thou∣sand Crowns of it into the Town-House i. e. the Bank of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> designed by this, to let the world see she had not renoun∣ced <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> had insinu∣ated: And that she was resolved to settle her two Sons in that Kingdom, in case they could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Honour. But besides, that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> seemed for her interest, she made also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> strantage by that Gold which she had sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for as to its fineneis, it was much below the standard of the <HI>French</HI> Coyn, yet it was ta∣ken into the Mint as if it had been the finest Gold in the world, for the King stood so much in need of Money, that he was content to take it as it was. When these two Princes were come to <HI>Paris,</HI> and to the Court, they were soon convinced by the Luxury they saw in both these Places, that the reports which had been industriously spread in <HI>Poland,</HI> were altogether false. They betook themselves to those diversions that Prin∣ces of their Age do usually entertain themselves with: They went to all the Balls that they heard of, and there was one thing besel them that de∣serves we should give an Account of it.</P>
<P>Being at one of these Balls, with Five or Six Gentlemen of their Retinue, who were Masked as
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
well as themselves, there was there one of the <HI>Mousquetaires</HI> of the Kings Houshold, who had put on the habit of a Counsellor, and was therewith Disguised. He chanced to meet with the young Princes, whom he did not know, and told them very Gravely, that it was to no purpose, that they should put themselves to so much trouble in a business wherein they could not succeed and therefore as their Counsel he would seriously ad∣vise them, to agree with their adversary, other∣ways, they would be cast in their suit. The two Princes had received letters from <HI>Poland,</HI> the day before, wherein they had the bad News, that the Queen their Mother despaired of succeeding in her designs; and this News had spread through the Town, so that they never reflected, that this dis∣course was said Innocently and without any other design, but that it might suit with the Garb he had then put on; They Imagined on the other hand, that he had spoken with relation to the news they had received, and they were so enra∣ged against him, that they thought it not enough, to call him Villain and Rogue, and that he was but an insolent Rascal, to behave, himself with so little respect to them, but they also Bastinad'd him Soundly. The poor Counsellor, finding that he had but a bad cause to plead for himself, began to cry out, What do this to me, a <HI>Mousquetaire,</HI> to me? as those of the Company of <HI>Mousquetaires</HI> use to do, when they find, that they have to deal with too strong a party. But the Princes of <HI>Poland</HI> pulling off their Masks, that it might be known who they were, there was not so much as one Person that would come to the assistance of the poor bastinado'd <HI>Mousquetaire.</HI> He marched off with the blows he had received, and resolved to complain to the King, from whom he expected more Justice; No doubt he had rea∣son to demand it, and would certainly have ob∣tained it, if he had had to do with those of hit own
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
Rank. But the Princes were before-hand with him in complaining to his Majesty. And he had the hard fortune to be sent to prison, so soon as he offered to speak of it. By this treatment, and by what he had before met with, he became sen∣sible, that it was not for his Interest, to take up a Trade that he had no skill in; and therefore he resolved never to profess it any more, or if he did, he would never give counsel but to those who as∣ked it of him. The one of these Princes was much handsomer than the other. And the King was resolved to give them the blew Ribban, <HI>i. e.</HI> to make them Knights of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> This was to do good for evil. For the Queen their Mother, never failed to do all that was in her Power, to traverse his Majesty's Designs. When they gave her Advice of this, she sent an Express to them, and told them, that she was surprized to find, that they had so much as listened to such a Proposal; since they could not but know, that if they accepted of it, they should thereby act direct∣ly contrary to the Interests of their Family; that they knew how a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she was engaged in the Interest of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and that they must follow her Example, in adhering closely to that House. By this it is manifest, that she had altogether forgot∣ten her Native Country, ever since she was put to it, to keep up the Splendour of her Childrens Family, by endeavouring to raise her Eldest Son to Royal Dignity. These Princes having received these Orders from their Mother, gave the King thanks for the Honour he had offered to do them, but excused themselves for not accepting of it: They frequented the Balls as formerly, tho' they were sometimes engaged in other Business; as par∣ticularly with the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> a Person of Quality in <HI>Brittany,</HI> who had but a little before, married one of the Marshal <HI>de Noaille</HI>'s Daugh∣ters.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>
This was no ill Match for him, especially, see∣ing the Mareshal was so much in favour. The King had given him the Command of his Army in <HI>Ca∣talonia,</HI> though he was not a Man of so much Ex∣perience as many others; for except, that he had commanded some Troops, in the time of Peace; be∣cause he was first Captain of the Life-guards, all the Preferment he had come to, was to be <HI>Aide de Camp</HI> to His Majesty. But the King added yet another Honour to this, and made him Mareshal of <HI>France,</HI> in the Year 1693. though no body could see, that he had done any great things to de∣serve such a Preferment. However, whether it be that His Majesty knows Peoples Merits better than others do; or if Fortune, which has favoured him in all his Undertakings, designed to approve of his Choice; this Mareshal gained very soon a conside∣rable Battle: He had formerly taken the Towns of <HI>Roses</HI> and <HI>Gironne;</HI> and then it was said of him, that though he had not done any thing to deserve the Mareshal's Staff, when he first received it; yet he had afterwards made it appear, that he was worthy of it. His Father who was one of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s Creatures, had been also a Captain of the Life-guards; and it was his Fortune to be rai∣sed to that Post when he was least expecting it. It was in the King's Minority, and the Occasion of it was this: The Queen Mother had become jealous of the Count <HI>de Termes;</HI> who was provi∣ded of the same Charge, so that he was forced to remove from the King's Person, at a time when it was his Turn to have waited upon him. When he was dismissed, she ordered that another Cap∣tain of the Guards should take his <HI>Batton;</HI> but they had all promised to one another, to do nothing to the Prejudice of their Fellow-Officer; for which the Count <HI>de Charost</HI> was banished; and Monsieur <HI>de Chandenier,</HI> was yet more unfortunate; for the Queen took his Commission from him, and gave
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
it to the Marshal <HI>de Nouailles</HI>'s Father, so that he was never able to recover it, though he lived a long time after. It was not for want of Time, that he could not succeed; nor was it for want of Conjunctures, that seemed favourable enough for him, for he was of the same Family, that Ma∣dam <HI>de Morte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pan</HI> was of: And since he was not more guilty than the Count <HI>de Charost,</HI> who was soon recalled from his Banishment, and made Duke and Peer of <HI>France;</HI> it may be said, that there is nothing in this World, but good or bad Fortune: For this Man was so far from being in a worse condition because of his Disobedience; that he rai∣sed his Fortune to such a degree, that he could not desire to raise it higher; while the unfortu∣nate Marquis <HI>de Chandinier,</HI> was quite undone with his Fall.</P>
<P>Tho' it be to the only late Duke <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> that his Family owes the present Greatness, to which it has arrived; yet it must be confessed, that it is an ancient and honourable Family. I know that the present <HI>Madame de Bouillon,</HI> when she was striving for the Door with the Dutchess <HI>de Nou∣ailles,</HI> spoke of her and her Family with so much Disdain, that if her Word could have been taken for it, the Family of <HI>Nouailles</HI> should have been thought a very despicable one: I know also, that she produced some old Papers, by which it was found, that one <HI>Anthony de Nouailles,</HI> had been Steward of the House, to the Viscount <HI>de Turenne;</HI> but as Stewards of the House at that time, were usually Gentlemen, and as there are younger Brothers of good Families, who are forced to condescend to meaner things than he did; so that One Instance, ought not to give us any mean Opinion of that Family, which is certainly very noble and very ancient. And it cannot to be said, that the Mar∣quis <HI>de Coaquin</HI> match'd below his Quality; when he married a Daughter of it, though it be true,
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
that his Family has sometimes made greater Al∣liances: For not to go far back, his Mother was <HI>Rohan Chabot,</HI> and his Grandmother <HI>Orleans Lon∣gueville.</HI> He had a great Estate in <HI>Brittany,</HI> which his Mother resigned in his favour, as she did al∣most every thing she could claim by her Marriage-Contract, and for her Dowry. For this is a La∣dy of extraordinary Virtue, and so soon as she had put her Affairs in order, she resolved to re∣tire into a Convent, and reserved nothing to her∣self, but 10000 Livres <HI>per Ann.</HI> which was by ve∣ry much less than what she had a Right to, if she had exacted so much as she might have done. Her Son was but 18 Years old, when he married <HI>Mada∣moiselle de Nouailles,</HI> but he was as tall a Man as he could expect to be at 25; and his Mother im∣portuned him to take a Wife, because he was the only Child his Father had left. This Lady had not been very happy in her Marriage, though she was of an agreeable Complexion, and of a very good Air, yet she had not so much Beauty as to please her Husband; and since she knew by her own Expe∣rience, what Disgusts Husbands use to take at their Wives, when they are not altogether agreeable; she ought at least to have chosen an handsome La∣dy for her Son, that he might not fall into the same Immoralities, that her Husband had done. But this was what she had thought least of, and she had soon reason to repent of it. For upon the Morrow after the Marriage, when some of her Sons Friends came to pay him their Compliments, upon that Occasion; he could not forbear telling them, that they needed not give themselves that trouble; that his Mother had chosen a Dwarf for him, instead of a Wife: That it seem'd she who was a devout Lady, had made this Choice, be∣cause the Duke <HI>de Nouailles</HI> was devout also. But for his part, he wish'd his Wife more so than either of them; that he might not be troubled with ly∣ing
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
with her: And that he was resolved henceforth to treat her as a Relique; that is, that he should never come near her, but upon Holy Days. From that day he gave such Proofs of his want of Affection to her, that all the Family took notice of it: They all consulted, what was fit to be done in such a Case; that <HI>Monsieur de Coaquin,</HI> might not engage himself in those lewd Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, that Hus∣bands use to betake themselves to, when they come to despise their Wives. The Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who is the Mareshal's Brother, was called among the first, to give Advice in this matter: And they all agreed, that because the new mar∣ried Lady was pale as Death, which made her the more disagreeable to her Husband, it was there∣fore necessary to find out some Expedient, to give her a better Colour, they had recourse to Painting, which is highly esteem'd among the Ladies, who by daubing their Faces with white and red, make themselves look to be of as fine Complexions as they plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. But many of the more scrupulous sort of People, were surprised, when they heard, that so good a Man as this Prelate, and so de∣vout a Lady as the Dowager of <HI>Nouailles,</HI> had advised such a thing as that. But though the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Dutchess <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> did not only cause this Lady's Face to be painted with white and red, but also caused Shooes to be made for her, with Heels that were a Quarter of an Ell high, that she might thereby appear so much the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; yet she was as unlovely in the Eyes of her Husband, as she had been before; nay, he thought her the more ugly, upon this very account; insomuch that instead of conversing with her, he entreated his Friends, who spoke to him sometimes of her and of his Father in Law, that if they would oblige him, they would not so much as speak either ill or good of them. In the mean time, he endeavoured to comfort himself, as well
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
as he could with good cheer, and in the Com∣pany of some Ladies, whom he visited, not upon the account of any familiar converse, but that he delighted to vex them, and they were never more out of humour, than when they saw him come into their Company, so that they would gladly have gone out at the Window, to shun any converse with him, if they could have done it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mareshal de Nouailles</HI> who has had more than twenty Children by his Lady, though she be not to this time much above forty years, had as yet another daughter to marry, there was a great difference between her and <HI>Madam de Coaquin.</HI> The one was as agreeable, as the other was deformed; which made one say to the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> that the Mareshal had given him <HI>Leah,</HI> but had kept <HI>Rachel.</HI> There was abundance of young Gentlemen who were Suitors to this new <HI>Rachel,</HI> both because her Father was much in favour at Court; and because she herself was so great a Beauty: The Count <HI>d' Estrees</HI> (who came to be happier than the rest; for it was he that married her;) was of the number of those who made their Addresses to her. His Ambition carried him to this, as much as any thing else. He considered, that though he was of a Family, which is in the Possession of more Honours, in the Person of his Father and his two Uncles, than any other Family is, yet that was no∣thing to him, unless he could attain to the like Ho∣nours: For tho' his Fathers elder Brother was Duke and Peer of <HI>France,</HI> and that his Son had succeeded to him in the same Honours, and though his Fa∣ther was Mareshal of <HI>France,</HI> and his Uncle a Car∣dinal, yet he himself had no Place or Rank at Court, and was only considered there, as a Person of Qua∣lity, as Ten Thousand others are. So that he saw nothing that could satisfie his Ambition, unless he went aboard of the Fleet, where he would be obliged to signalize himself, because he had the Sur∣vivance
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
of the Office of Vice-Admiral, which his Father was in Possession of: His Uncle the Car∣dinal, who had a greater Kindness for him, that for the Duke <HI>d' Estrees,</HI> though he was his Nephew as well as he, and by his elder Brother too, ad¦vised him to this Marriage; and he used his ut¦most Endeavours to bring it about, as the only means whereby he might be made a Duke, as his Cousin was. And he was so earnest in this Affair that he sent Word to the Duke <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if he could presume so much upon his favour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to employ him to procure a Dukes Patent to his Nephew, he should marry his Daughter without one Farthing of Portion: And he promised also to make him his Heir, and to make the Inheritance as good as he could. The Duke <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> who had not much Money to give with his Daughter and who had given no great Portion with <HI>Madame de Ceaquin,</HI> though he had made a shew of con¦tracting for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Franks,</HI> but it was in Cats are Rats, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that is, he had given him a Regiment, and some other lesser Preserments; the Duke I say, was not so rich, but that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sparing of his Money; and he was well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the Proposal, but he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, had better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to that Honour, upon the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Fathers great Services <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had with the King; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to marry his Daugh¦ter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he had to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was true, he had more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> others, to carry on such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was Captain of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him an easie Access to the King's Person; but that was not enough for a matter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so great Importance, and therefore he ought no
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
to trust to it so much, but that besides marrying his Daughter, he should take all the same measures he would do, if he were to marry another: But it was very difficult for the Count <HI>d' Estrees,</HI> to take those measures; because the Mareshal would not give him so much Money, as was necessary to put his Affairs in a good Condition. For want of this, they resolved upon all hands to deal with one <HI>Madame de Thoist,</HI> a rich Lady; she was the Widow of a <HI>Maîere de Comptes,</HI> and she had lent a considerable Sum to the <HI>Cardinal d' Estrees,</HI> and was not payed of it: And besides, she was a Friend of the Duke and Dutchess <HI>de Nouailles;</HI> and be∣cause she had no Children, they told her so often, that she ought to adopt <HI>Madamoiselle de Nouailles,</HI> for her Daughter, that though they could not pre∣vail with her to leave her all her Estate, yet they perswaded her to do something for her. And she offered at last, to give her what the Cardinal <HI>d' E∣strees</HI> owed her. But becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they would have more, the matter is put off to this time; for she will not give away all her Estate in her own Life-time; yet she promises, that besides the Sum which the Cardinal owes her, which she is willing to part with presently, she shall also consider this young Lady in her Will; so that she shall be sure of something more at her Death. That which sell out between the Princes of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> was not at all for his Advantage; if we may be∣lieve what is commonly reported. In the mean time, they took their Journey to return into their own Country; after they had been magnificently regaled, by many Persons that belonged to the Court. <HI>Monsieur de Langlee,</HI> who is none of the least considerable of them, if we consider nothing but his expensive way of living, was the first who gave them a splendid Entertainment; and acquit∣ted himself very handsomly in it. He is now in possession of being the first who regales Strangers of
<PB N="68" REF="99"/>
great Quality upon their arrival: Which made the King say, some time ago, <HI>i e.</HI> before the arri∣val of the two Princes, that <HI>Monsieur Langlee</HI> see∣med to be made for no other end, but to entertain all the strangers that came to Court. But he en∣tertains Persons of Quality, who are of the French Nation, as Magnificently, as he does strangers. There is not a Man about the Court that regales our Princes and Princesses so often, as he does, and he has got into a Custom, of providing a Collation for the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> as often as he comes to the Opera. It is but of late that he was in a condition to ac∣quit himself well in such an undertaking, for though his Father who was once but a poor man, and of mean extract, made up some small estate to him, yet it was far from being sufficient for such costly Entertainments. He has raised his Estate by gaming; which has put him in a condition to build so many fine Houses, and by which, he has so great yearly Revenues. And considering the first years of his gaming, and now that he is become rich, it may be said of him, what was once said to the President <HI>Belli∣evre</HI> by one that designed to flatter him. I confess that the beginning of this Discourse would be insipid, but that it is agreeable to the first beginnings of his fortune, and that the last part of it would be im∣pertinent, but that it suits with his present Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>This President, who was the chief Man in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> had always some Debate with <HI>Cardinal Mazarin,</HI> whom he did not much E∣steem, and it may be, the <HI>Cardinal</HI> had as little E∣steem for him, and perhaps he was in the right too. However, the Man I just now spoke of, knowing, what Opinion this Chief President had of his Emi∣nence; said to him once, whilst they were spea∣king of him, that no great Account was to be made of such Men, whose fortunes were volatile, and what show soever they made, yet they were
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
but like glaring meteors, which disappear'd in a short time. But on the other hand, he said that the Presidents fortune was built upon a rock, and that he must be a Man of very little sense, who did not see a great difference, between the one and the other. We may easily perceive, that the Man who spoke so, was best acquainted with old customs, since he magnified a chief President so much, and undervalued a chief Minister. And at most it is only during a Kings minority, that this way of reasoning will hold good. But now a days, he should be accounted a Mad-man, or one that had returned from the other world, that would speak at such a rate. In a word, if <HI>Monsieur de Langlees</HI> fortune, might have been compared to a Meteor, while his high spending was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded only upon what he gained at game, yet he has now settled it upon so many fair Buildings, in <HI>Paris</HI> and in the Country, that we may say, what the Man said to the President, that he had now foun∣ded it upon a Rock. <HI>Madame la Marquise de Be∣thunes,</HI> who is the Queen of <HI>Polands</HI> Sister, gave also a Magnificent Entertainment to the two Princes her Nephews. There were many Persons of Quality, of both Sexes, at this feast, and it en∣ded with a splendid Ball. Yet this Marchioness is not at all rich, nay she's very poor to be sister of a Queen; yet it was her own fault, that she had not a better estate. For when her husband was Ambassadour in <HI>Poland,</HI> the Queen her Sister was resolved to make her rich; But she became jea∣lous, that the Queen was in love with her husband, and that it was for his sake, that she made so kind Offers. Her jealousie made her commit a thou∣sand follies, which so displeased that Court, that her Husband dying there, all that she brought to <HI>France</HI> from that Country, was a gift of a hundred thousand Crowns, which the Late King of <HI>Poland</HI> gave her, upon the Estate of the Late Duke <HI>de Longueville.</HI></P>
<P>This Monarch had lent this Money, while he
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
was but great <HI>Mareshal</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> and when the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> was aspiring to that Crown. But his Sister the <HI>Dutchess de Nemours</HI> refused to pay it, as well as all the other sums, which he had borrowed at that time, that he might attain to Royal dignity. She pretended, that her brother was under age, when he borrowed these sums, and therefore, she was not obliged to pay them. This gave occasion to a Law suit, before the Coun∣cil, and it appeared intricate and doubtful. For the Law forbids to lend Money to Minors; unless it be manifestly for their advantage, and therefore. <HI>So∣biesky</HI> ought to lose his Money; because the Duke was not of age when he borrowed it. But the <HI>Marchioness de Bethunes,</HI> as well as the Dukes other Creditors, answered to this, that what might be considered in the case of ordinary Loans, ought not to be considered in such an extraordinary case as this was, when the borrower of the Money, designed to employ it for obtaining a Crown; and that this had been always the Opinion of the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> who while he was alive, was still desi∣rous that <HI>Monsieur l' Abbee d' Orleans,</HI> who was Brother and heir to the deceased Duke <HI>de Lon∣gueville,</HI> should pay punctually the full interest, of all the Money that had been Borrowed upon that Account That it was he, who took care of all the Affairs of the Family of <HI>Longueville,</HI> because <HI>L' Abbe d' Orleans,</HI> who was the Duke's elder Brother was but a weak Man, and unfit for Business. That, their Sister the Dutchess <HI>de Nemours</HI> dared not to have spoken any thing against the payment of those debts, so long as her Brother was alive. But now that he was dead, and that the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> who had always supported the Claim of the Creditors, was dead also; she who loved Cavils and litigious de∣bates, had brought them to the Trouble and Ex∣pence of a Law Suit. It was first debated before the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> but at last it was brought before
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
the Kings Council. Either because the affair was of importance, or that it ought in course of Law to have been carried thither. And it was truly the Kings Interest to take cognisance of it himself, es∣pecially at such a Juncture as that was, for it was his concern to gain the Polanders to the Prince of <HI>Conti's</HI> Interest, and not to give them cause to com∣plain, that they were cheated by the Duke <HI>de Lon∣gueville,</HI> who had borrowed Money of <HI>Sobiesky,</HI> and of several other Persons of Quality among them. Therefore the King Ordered the <HI>Marquis de Bar∣besieux</HI> to consider the case, and to report it fully in his Presence. For the Secretaries of his Majesty's Commands, of which this <HI>Marquis</HI> is one, are also Counsellors of state, and have the same Com∣missions, so that the King may Charge them with all sorts of business, as he can do any of the rest of that number. But after some days, his Majesty considered, that so young a man as the <HI>Marquis de Barbesieux,</HI> was scarcely capable of an affair of such importance; and that an old and experienced Coun∣sellor of state, would be much fitter for it. He therefore took it out of the <HI>Marquis</HI>'s hands, and Committed it to <HI>Monsieur de Ribere.</HI> But <HI>Madame de Nemours's</HI> Council had found so many shifts, that this has been put off from time to time, and is not as yet determined. Yet it is believed that she will be cast in it, as she was in another Law-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit, which she had against the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> before the <HI>Requetes du Palais.</HI> This case was of yet grea∣ter importance than the former; and there were some Circumstances in it, that were very conside∣rable, and therefore I shall give a full Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur l' Abbe d' Orleans,</HI> whom I just now mentioned, having renounced his right of Primo∣geniture, in favour of the <HI>Comte de St. Paul</HI> his younger Brother, who thereafter took the Title of
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
Duke <HI>de Longueville,</HI> he was in a short time restored to all his rights, by the Death of that Prince, who like a fool, was the Occasion of his own Death, as he was passing the <HI>Rhine. Monsieur l Abbee</HI> was wil∣ling to have made over the whole Estate to his Uncle the Prince of <HI>Condee;</HI> but this Prince, who enjoy∣ed eighteen hundred thousand Livres of yearly revenue, thought, that he had already more than was sufficient to make him happy, if Riches alone can make us so; and therefore he advised him to give it to his Mother, <HI>Madame de Longueville,</HI> who had more need of it than he. The <HI>Abbee</HI> was a man that did every thing he was advised to, especially if the Advice came from a Person of Authority, like the Prince <HI>de Condee:</HI> so that he agreed, that those who managed his affairs, should draw up his will, and that he should sign it. It was done as the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> was pleased to order it, and the <HI>Abbee</HI> altered not so much as one word in it. By this will he gave over the Principality of <HI>Neufchatel</HI> in <HI>Suitzerland</HI> with some other possessions, to his Mother the Dutchess <HI>de Longueville</HI> during her Life. But af∣ter her Death the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> had Right to them by the same will, if no new will should be made. But he who had already refused them, was resolved not to make any advantage of the <HI>Abbees</HI> will for the future, and therefore, he caused his right to be made over to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> after the Death of the Dutchess. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> had need of a good Estate, for his Fathers Marriage was disad∣vantageous for his Fortune, as well as for his Honour. He had resigned the <HI>Abbacy</HI> of <HI>St. Denis,</HI> with many other good benefices, for the sake of a Niece of Cardi∣nal <HI>Mazarins,</HI> who was truely a Virtuous Lady, but her Uncle gave her nothing in Marriage, though he had so pillaged <HI>France,</HI> that he might have given her a great Estate, without pinching himself in the least. Yet he had promised him Mountains of Gold, as he always used to do, when he had a design to co∣zen
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
any body, but having dealt by her and her Hus∣band as he usually did by all those, with whom he had any business, though he might at least have put some difference between him and others, both upon the Account of his Quality, and because his Niece was Married to him. This Prince died very poor for a Person of his Rank. However The Dutchess <HI>de Nemours</HI> being informed of the Will, which her Brother had made, importuned him so, as that she prevailed with him after the Prince of <HI>Condees</HI> Death, to make it void; and to make another will, by which he left the whole Inheritance to her. Now this <HI>Abbee</HI> dying soon after, and the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> pretending, that the will which had been made in his favour, ought to prevail against this Last will, the <HI>Requetes du Palais</HI> were the proper Judges, in the first point of the controversie. The Reasons of his plea, were, that <HI>Monsieur l' Abbee d' Orleans</HI> was <HI>non Compos</HI> when he made the Last will, so that it ought to be considered as if such a thing had never been done. If <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> had been well advised, she would have said the same of him when he made his first will, and she would have had no difficulty in proving it; so that the first being no better than the second, she should have succeeded by law, to the whole Estate; without any sentence in her favour, because she was his sister. But her Council it seems was as Visionary, as those who live beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> who plead for the Popes Infallibility. They maintain'd, that the Testator was sound in his Judgment, when he made the se∣cond will, whereby the first was made void. And they had no other way to prove this, but by the Popes Infallibility, who had put him into Priests orders, at the very time, that he made this second will. And they alledged, that it could not be suppo∣sed, that the Pope would have ordained him Priest, if he had not been in his right wits. And they thought this so good a Reason, that they could not conceive,
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
how it could have been answered. So that they neglected all other reasons, and adhered only to this one, to support their Cause. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> desired, he might be allowed to prove, that the <HI>Ab∣bee</HI> was <HI>nonCompos</HI> when he made his last Will, which he offered to do by Evidences that could not be excepted against. He was allowed to prove it, and he pro∣duced his Evidences, upon whose Deposition the whole Cause depended. The Question was, if <HI>Mon∣sieur l' Abbee d'Orleans</HI> was sound in his Judgment, when he made his second Will. But there was no great diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulty to resolve this Question, for there were Evidences that told things of him, that could not have been said of any Man, but one that was fit for a Bedlam. And among other things they de∣posed, that when he was going to say Mass, the first time after he was ordained Priest; he stopped when he came near to the Rails, which usually separates the Sanctuary and the Altar from the <HI>Neve</HI> of the Church, and there he tried if he could jump over the Rails, with his Feet close together. They de∣posed al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat when he found he was not able to do it, he came back about 20 Pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that he might give himself more Force by running; and in this mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Holy Sacri∣fice unto God Almighty; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a Thou∣sand other Proofs of his being a Fool, an Account of which wou'd be too tedious. <HI>Madam de Nemour's</HI> Council were aston shed, when they heard the Evi∣dences depose such things as these, and they wished then, that they had not relied so much upon the Popes Infallibility, and that they had taken better mea∣sures, but it was now too late. The Judges pro∣ceeded to pronounce a Sentence, by which that Prince, the <HI>Abbee,</HI> was declared to have been <HI>non compos,</HI> when he made his second Will.</P>
<P>Although the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> and all the Court were overjoyed, when they heard that the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> whom they lov'd so dearly had gain'd his
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
Cause; yet <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> appealed to the <HI>Grand Chambre,</HI> where she is still prosecuting it; but no body doubts, but that the Sentence which was pronounced, will be confirmed by a Decree. Some time before this Sentence was pronounced, <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> acted her part very dexte∣rously, and like a Lady of good Conduct: She knew, that she had a strong Party to deal with, in her Law-suit; and therefore, as her Brother's Heiress, she had given the Principality of <HI>Neufchatel</HI> to the <HI>Chevalier de Soissons,</HI> a Bastard Son of the late Count <HI>de Soissons,</HI> who was a Prince of the Blood, and her Uncle: For she was the Daughter of one of his Si∣sters; who was married to the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> her Father, and after whose Death, he married the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI>'s Sister. Now, when she gave this Principality to this <HI>Chevalier,</HI> she had obliged him to marry the Marshal <HI>de Luxenbourg</HI>'s Daughter; hoping that the need the Kingdom had of the Services of so great a Captain, in so formidable a War, as it had to maintain against so many Enemies, would give her an Interest with the King, sufficient to balance the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s. But this Marshal died to his Daughter's great Loss, before that the Sen∣tence which I have given an account of, was pro∣nounced; So that the Hopes vanished, which <HI>Ma∣dame de Nemours</HI> had comforted herself with, when she contrived that Marriage. Though it must be confessed, she took very good measures to bring about her Designs. But there was something in it, that was still worse for the <HI>Chevalier de Soissons;</HI> for he had resigned a good Abbacy that he might marry a Lady, who was neither rich nor handsome, and he had also taken the Title of Prince of <HI>Neuf∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatel,</HI> when he was upon the point of losing the Principality.</P>
<P>Though the gaining of this Cause, was for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Advantage, yet it was nothing in comparison of the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> which per∣haps
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
the King had obliged him to think of, more than he would have done, had he followed his own Inclinations: For he was become passionately in love with a Lady of great Quality; Insomuch, that tho' a Crown be so considerable, as that it deserves to be preferred to all other things; yet he seem'd not to to be too much concerned with it, lest he should have been obliged to quit his Mistress. But it was quite otherwise with <HI>Madame</HI> the Princess of <HI>Conti;</HI> the thing in the World she wished most was, that her Husband might be a King: Ambition, which is natural to Persons of her Rank and Quality, made her passionately desirous of this; but besides, she hoped, that the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> would take off her Husband, from the Affection he had for the o∣ther Lady; which yet she durst not complain of, for fear of displeasing him, and for some other Rea∣sons that must not be published. However, this Design for the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> met with great Opposition, and as the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> was mind∣ful of its own Concerns in the present Juncture of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> that it might by all means procure that Crown to one, who would closely ad∣here to its Interests. So the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> was not the only Person, that was in Competition for it, with Prince <HI>James.</HI> Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Ge∣neral of the Imperial Forces, and whose Merits were not much short of his own, was also one of the Competitors; and King <HI>William</HI> seemed to fa∣vour his Pretentions against Prince <HI>James;</HI> but this was only a sort of Phantome, which was brought forth upon the Theatre, to frighten the Actors, while his Imperial Majesty had resolved un∣der-hand in his Cabinet-council, to cause the Ele∣ctor of <HI>Saxony</HI> to be chosen, who for some Years past, had been closely in his Interests, and comman∣ded his Forces in <HI>Hungary,</HI> This Elector was a man of true Courage, as well as the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> so that the <HI>Po∣landers</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
could not refuse him upon that Score: For they are People, who will not have a King, but one that is capable both by Courage and Conduct, to head their Armies in Person, when it comes to fighting. But the great difficulty that they had to remove was, that he was a <HI>Lutheran;</HI> and this seem'd a very great one, because among the ma∣ny Laws, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> have made, for the Government of their Kingdom, they have establi∣shed this, for an unalterable one; that no Man shall be chosen King of <HI>Poland,</HI> but he who is of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion. And therefore, when the Em∣peror communicated his Designs to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of advancing him to the Throne of that Kingdom; he insinuated to him at the same time, that there was a necessity for him to change his Religion: At last, whether it was that he had but little Religion, as ordinarily the Great Men of the World have but a small share of it, or if it may be imputed to any other cause, I do not know; but he not only agreed to do what was desired of him, but he also abjured it privately, before the Bishop of <HI>Javarin;</HI> yet he did not this, till he saw, that there was a Party in <HI>Poland</HI> formed for him, which was capable to put the Crown on his Head: The Designs of this Party were kept so secret, that <HI>Monsieur L' Abbee de Polignac,</HI> had not the least notice of them, but continued to believe, that he had no body to grapple with, but Prince <HI>James,</HI> whom he was not much afraid of, because of his disobli∣ging Conduct: And the People were generally of Opinion, that he would follow his Example in too many things. So that <HI>Monsieur L' Abbee</HI> wrote to the <HI>French</HI> Court, that he hoped in a short time to bring the whole matter to an happy Issue. The Bishop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> whom the whole House of <HI>Au∣stria</HI> did chiefly rely on, for making its Designs effectual; being afraid that he should not be successful, because all the People had so great an
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
Esteem for the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and especially the Ladies, who all desired him for their King; thought it best to deal craftily in this matter, and to ma∣nage it to the best advantage he could for himself, when he found that he was at the Head of a Fa∣ction, that at least might make the <HI>French</HI> Em∣bassadour jealous of him, tho' it was not as yet so strong as his own. He caused it to be told him under-hand, that if he desired that he might not cross his Designs, it was in his Power to hinder him from doing it. That he knew he aspired to be a Cardinal, and that he considered, that the only way how he could attain to that Dignity, was by his being successful in his Negotiations for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> But if he would renounce all Pretentions in his favour, he would joyn Interests and unite Factions with him, by which means the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> would be infallibly secured to that Prince. No good Subject would have refused what this Bi∣shop desired, though perhaps no Man would have yielded to it, but with some Reluctancy. But <HI>Mon∣fieur L'Abbee</HI> scorned to hearken to such a Proposal, and did not so much as communicate it to the <HI>French</HI> Court, but pursued his former Designs; while the Bishop strengthned his Faction, by bringing over into it, the Party that had been for Prince <HI>James;</HI> for his Mother the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> was so enraged against the <HI>French,</HI> because they had traversed all her Designs for her Son; that she had rather the <HI>Polan∣ders</HI> should chuse any other Man than the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> so little did she remember the Place of her Birth, or that the King of <HI>France</HI> had been so instru∣mental as he was in the Election of the late King her Husband. Yet among all the Factions that were a∣mong the Palatinates, there was one thing in which they all agreed, that what Person soever they should chuse for King, he should purchase their Suffrages with good round Summs of Money; so that the 200000 Crowns, which the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had sent
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
into that Country, was but as a drop of Oyl in a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fire; but the King supplied his Indigence, and sent thither at one time and another 4000000 of Crowns. The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> borrowed Money with both Hands, from several Princes; that he might satisfie the covetous Desires of the <HI>Polanders;</HI> and King <HI>William</HI> lent him great Sums as well as the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg:</HI> In the mean while, this Prince made some of his Troops march toward the Confines of the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Dominions, that lie nearest to <HI>Po∣land;</HI> as if there had been some Difference between them, and the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> took Occasion from that to carry his own Troops out of <HI>Hungary,</HI> under pretence to defend his Dominions against the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> But all this marching of Troops on both sides, was only that they might join their Forces together in case of need; that is, in case there should be a double Election, as there was great ap∣pearance of it; that so the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> might make good his Election by Force of Arms.</P>
<P>While these things were doing, the Prince of <HI>Con∣ti</HI> diverted himself the best way he could, as if he had not in the least been concerned in any Business of Importance. He spoke of buying a House at <HI>Berci,</HI> as the Dukes <HI>de Chaulnes</HI> and <HI>de Gesvres</HI> had done; for each of them had one in that Town: The Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> who has that in common with many other Persons of Quality, that he does not always speak truth hearing him speak of a particular House, that belonged to one of the Farmers of the King's Reve∣nues, whose Name
 was—with which he said he was very well pleased; offered immediately to deal effectually with the Landlord, and that the Prince should have a good Bargain on't: And that he might believe, that he could perswade the Farmer to do any thing, he told the Prince, that if he pleas'd to sup in that House to morrow night, he would oblige the Master of the House to provide a Supper for him, and then he should have an Opportunity to see the
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
whole Contrivance, and all the Conveniencies of the House. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was well pleased with the Proposal; and told him that he was engag'd to be with the Dutchess <HI>de Bouillon</HI> at that time; but he would rather disengage himself than miss such an Opportunity: So they made an Appointment at that House, to morrow in the Evening. But while the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was at Dinner, the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> sent to tell him, that the Appointment could not be kept, because the Landlord, who was not accusto∣med to entertain Princes of the Blood in his House, was con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded with the Thoughts of it: as for him∣self, he was resolved to take the Advantage of that Disappointment, and that if the Prince was pleased to put off the Appointment till to morrow, he would do himself the honour to entertain him at dinner in the same House, with Seven or Eight of his Friends; such as he should chuse. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> said to the Man who brought him this Message, that he thank'd the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> for it, and that he ac∣cepted of it, and would be timely at the House to morrow, that he might have time to take a full View of it and consider it. He invited the Mar∣quis <HI>de Coastin,</HI> the President <HI>de Mesmes, Monsieur Caumartin,</HI> and some other Persons of Quality, to go along with him; but on the Morrow's morning came another from the Duke to make an Apology, that he could not wait upon him as he had promised, be∣cause of some Business of Importance, that had un∣expectedly fallen out, and which he was obliged to look after. But there was not so much as one Word of all this true: He did not so much as know the Man to whom the House belonged; he had not given him any Notice of the Appointment, which the Prince and he had made to sup at his House, nor had he any design himself, to entertain him at din∣ner in the same House; so that there were as ma∣ny Lies as Words, in all that he had said to him upon that Head. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> made a Jest
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
of all this, with his Friends, without troubling him∣self any more about it. There was one Mr. <HI>Cha∣pelle,</HI> who had been formerly one of the Prince's Domesticks, but at this time a Farmer of the Re∣venues, hearing one speak of it to Mr. <HI>Caumartin;</HI> went to his old Master and told him, that though he was far below the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI>'s Quality, yet he should acquit himself better of his Promise than he had done, in giving him an Entertainment at that very House, provided the Prince would not take it amiss, that he had presumed to invite him to it. The Prince answered, that he was well sa∣tisfied with it, and made a new Appointment with his Friends, to be there to morrow in the Evening, and Mr. <HI>Chapelle</HI> regaled him splendidly. There were at this Entertainment many Persons of Quality, both of Civil and Military Employments; and among the rest there were present those, whom the Prince had invited, when he was to have supped there upon the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI>'s Invitation. They discoursed about a great many things; and as it was impossible they could forget the Duke, so they took occasion to speak of a Visit, that his Mistress had lately paid to the Archbishop of <HI>Paris;</HI> because he had made an Ordinance, wherein this Lady found herself con∣cerned. There were many Persons who had taken advantage of his Predecessors easie Temper, and had obtained leave of him to have Chappels in their own Houses; and under pretence of hearing Mass in these private Chappels, they came so seldom to Church, that they scarcely heard Mass there, at the Four great Festivals of the Year. Now the Archbishop thought it necessary to remedy this Custom, and for that end he suppressed all those Licenses, that his Predecessors had granted; and ordained, that all those who desired to have the Benefit of them for the time to come, should appear before him, that he might examine the reasons upon which the Licenses had been granted. The Dukes Mistress
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
had got one of these Licences, and she paid a visit to the Archbishop, and intreated him to confirm what his predecessor had done. But this Prelat, having heard of her Lewdness and Licentious way of Living, which was so publick, that even her son had made no scruple sometime before to say to the King, when he asked him, if he would be ready in a short time, to go to the Army; that he could not be so soon in a readiness to go thither, because his Mother had been more concerned to get ready the Duke <HI>d'Elbeufs</HI> Equipage, than his. This Prelat I say, who knew all this, and a Thousand other ill things of her; an∣swered her coldly, that those who would wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship God acceptably, must fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st know him, and fear him, and that those who did know him and fear him, would always think their pains well bestowed, when they went to Church where the rest of his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvants use to serve and worship him; and without saving any more to her, he refused to Grant her requests. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and all the Company Commen∣ded the Archbishop, for having spoken to her after this manner, for tho it was but a word or two that he had said; yet it was Enough, to make her reflect of her own ill Conduct. The most part of them said also, that the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> was much in the wrong, to deal so unkindly as he did, by his own Lady, for the sake of an old antiquated Whore, who had the Impudence sometimes to boast of the fineness of her Complexion, when it was well enough known, that it was Entirely owing to painting; But there were some, who undertook to justify the Duke, though they could not justify this Lady his Mistress. They pleaded in his behalf, that since he had nothing to Live by, or to support his Character, except his Go∣vernment, he could not be much blamed, for ha∣ving a Kindness for a Lady, that rewarded him so Liberally as she did; That she was frequently giving him good sums, and therefore he dispensed with her age. That there were several others who would do the
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
same thing, if they were in his circumstances: and in a word it was an ordinary thing among the young Beaus of the Court.</P>
<P>This was not the only Lady whom they had put on the foot of paying them well. In the mean time, it had been always the fate of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d. who had been mightily in love with this Lady, to have Mistresses who fought only to enrich them∣selves at his expence, and with his spoils to enrich others before his face. Another Dutchess, whom this Prince had Lov'd, before this, had used him the very same way as this did, and the <HI>Chevalier de Cha∣lillon,</HI> who is known at present in the world, under the name of Marquis, had continued to render her good service as long as she had wherewithal to re∣compence him; and she thought she employ'd her Money very well, because he was handsome and very well shap'd, and besides, he was al∣ways ready when she had a Mind for him. For she was a woman that gave no quarter to her Lovers, and pay'd them only in proportion to their services. She had learn'd from a Lady that was her friend, and who had Learned it herself from an old <HI>Countess de Vertus,</HI> that things ought to be done in this manner, and at least that this was the practise of the old Countess her self, who passed amongst the women of her time for the Cunningest that was among them all. The world indeed had accus'd her of weakness of judgment, but they had done her the greatest in∣justice that can be done to a Woman; since so far from being a Fool as was Pretended, she had made it appear by one of the Principal Actions of her Life, that never any Lady had better understanding: for being grown old, and yet the prick of the flesh continuing to torment her, she took the Method that any honest Woman ought to take, which was, to find out a Husband for herself, tho she was quite decrepid. In the mean time, knowing by the ex∣perience that she had of the world, that she might come to be deceiv'd, unless she took all the precauti∣on
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
that prudence could possibly suggest, she did two things which shew the greatness of her Judgment. One was, to cast her Eyes on a Man whose figure promised fairly; The other was, to make a bar∣gain with him, to oblige him to his good behaviour. This Man was the <HI>Chevalier de la Porte,</HI> who after the same manner as the <HI>Chevalier de Châtillon</HI> is now from <HI>Chevalier</HI> come to be a <HI>Comte.</HI> He was of a good Family, and tho he was not come of the Dukes of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tagne,</HI> as her first Husband was, yet she could put him in his place, without being accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of making a mean Alliance. So being satisfy'd both of his Person and of his Birth, the Question was only how to se∣cure herself against the disgusts, which a Husband usu∣ally takes, especially when interest has oblig'd him to take the burthen of an old Carcass, which he never marries but in the view and hope of being quickly rid of it. A Woman of so much knowledg and Experience was not easily to be deceiv'd, and behold too, what Measures she took to avoid it. Af∣ter she had express'd the tender Sentiments she had for him, by which he reckon'd himself extremely Honored, because he had nothing, and she was very Rich, then she shewed him a strong box, in which there was Fifty Thousand Crowns of ready Money. Having opened it too, that he might be the more fully assured of what was in it, and having let him look on it as long as was enough to make him in love with it, she told him, that here was, what she in∣tended to give him, on Condition that when he was her Husband he should use her kindly. The <HI>Cheva∣lier de la Porte,</HI> who knew as well as any Man alive, how to make Promises; swore to her, Mountains and wonders, to perswade her, that if ever she did him that favour, he had rather dye a Thousand Deaths, than ever to be guilty of Ingratitude. It seems he thought she would trust to his Swearing. But the Countess retaining still her former senti∣ments, told him, that tho' she believed him a Man
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
of Honour and in that Quality that he would keep his word to her, nevertheless that she would take such Precautions with him, that she should have no reason ever to repent of; that a Husband very often laught at the Promises which he made to his Wife; that she had no Mind to be disappointed, and therefore had resolved to tell him once for all, that if he would have her 50 Thousand Crowns, he must merit them by using her obligingly; that the best thing a Husband can do to a Wife is to caress her frequently; that on her part she promised to give him ten <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> for every time he caressed her, and as often and as far as he erred his performances, he might reckon to be payed accordingly. At this rate, if he caressed her but three times a Night, there was thirty <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> sure for him in the Morning, but if he pushed his valor further, he might quickly make the strong Box pass from her Closet into his own. This clause and Condition was not very agreeable to the <HI>Che∣valier,</HI> tho on other occasions he had been often at work, without being so well Rewarded. But hav∣ing a Passion for this Money, he consented to gain it with the sweat of his Brow. The Lady married him privately, and keeping her word to him every Morning in Proportion to his services, he had quick∣ly emptied the strong box, if the Lady's Children had not perceived the intrigue betwixt them. They spoke to her of it, as a thing that made the world talk strangely of her conduct, and the Lady, finding herself straitned in this point, told them at last, that they were unjust to suspect her of Lewdness, that she did nothing but what was Lawful for her to do, that she was Married to the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and that she would lye with him as often as ever she plea∣sed. Her Children knowing that she had ready Money, and that this was the high way to squander it, endeavoured to get the Marrige annulled, on pretext, that her great Age, for she was at least Se∣venty and two, had made her Incapable to know what she was doing. The Affair being brought
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
before the Judges, the Advocates pleaded on both sides; these for the Children, alledged strongly what they had been told, that the Lady was moap'd and silly, and that the <HI>Chevalier</HI> had surpriz'd and im∣pos'd on her Weakness; but the Advocates on the other side, having utterly run down this Pretext, by producing the Bargain which she had made with the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and which she had given him fairly in Writing; the Children had certainly lost their Cause, but the Judges would not suffer the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> whose Desire to empty the strong Box, had brought him almost on his last Legs already, to go on to kill himself.</P>
<P>They considered likewise, that the Lady by this means, would ruin her Children; for if this Coffer were once emptied, she would sell all that she had, rather than fail to fill it again, in order to enter∣tain the good Services, which the <HI>Chevalier</HI> had not fail'd to perform very constantly. So the Mar∣riage was annull'd by Decree of Parliament, who nevertheless appointed the <HI>Chevalier</HI> to have 20000 Crowns, for the Reward of his Labour.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI>'s Mistresses us'd him much after the same manner, and made him pay as dear for his Pleasures, as this old Lady paid to the <HI>Chevalier;</HI> especially she to whom this little History was told, and whom the <HI>Marquis de Châtillon</HI> did so drain of her Acquisitions, that she is now as poor and miserable as once she was opulent. As for the other, whom the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> frequented, she managed it a little better, though in the mean time she stuck at no Expense or Reward, when he threat∣ned to leave her, and go and push his Fortune else∣where.</P>
<P>But, let us now pass to some other Subject: We must know then, that she who was Lady of Honour to <HI>Madam la Dutchesse,</HI> being resolved to retire from Court, her Place which is worth 2000 Crowns of Pension <HI>per Ann.</HI> was sought for, by a great many
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
Ladies of Quality; who besides the 2000 Crowns which they had in their View, considered also, that thereby they should have Opportunities to get into His Majesty's Favour; for he desires to have one al∣ways about <HI>Madam la Dutchesse,</HI> who will give him an exact Account of all that she does: And it is of for that reason, that he has appointed these sorts of Ladies of Honour, both for her and the other Princesses of the Blood; and that he himself has settled pensions upon them. And he has a politick design in it, for thereby he keeps both them and their Husbands in their Duty, because they know, that they have one in their House, who takes notice of every thing they do; so that they dare not adventure upon any thing that may in the least displease the King. The Marchioness <HI>de la Porte,</HI> whose Husband was once Admiral of a Squadron, and Nephew of the <HI>Comte de la Porte,</HI> whom I spoke of just now, having but a small Estate to live by, thought, that it would be very convenient for her, to have that Post, especially she having been a Wi∣dow for several Years. She had several Friends, and among others, the Marquis <HI>d' Angeau,</HI> who has some Interest at Court, and did his utmost to have carried the Place for her. He was once in a fair way to have succeeded in it, but that it was told the King, that this Lady was not of sufficient Quality for so honourable an Employment; yet no body ad∣ventured to speak any thing against her Conduct, for though she be no great Beauty, yet she is of so great Virtue, that she's as much esteemed, as those who are much more beautiful: And the late <HI>Monsieur de Croissy,</HI> was once afraid, that his Son, who is now Secretary of State, should be so taken with this Lady's true Merit, as to make a secret Marriage with her; and therefore he sent him into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he made him stay some Years, and did not recal him, till he thought it probable, that his long Absence had cured him of the Wounds, which his Converse with her had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119"/>
But her Enemies made use of another Argument against her; to which, had she got but a fair hear∣ing, she could have so satisfied the King, that no doubt she would have obtained her Desire. But they imposed upon His Majesty, and told him, that there were Two Families of <HI>la Porte</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> that the one of them was a good Family, and the other was naught, that she was of the last, and <HI>Monsieur de Mazarine</HI> was of the first, and if he should pre∣fer her to be Lady of Honour to <HI>Madame la Dutch∣esse,</HI> People of the lowest Rank might pretend to Advancement, as well as she. And by this means, they prevailed so far, as that she was excluded, and the Marchioness <HI>de l' Angle,</HI> was preferred to that Place. Though in the mean time, she could have justly pleaded, that her Husband was of as good a Family as the Marquis <HI>de la Porte,</HI> for the <HI>Marquis</HI> was of <HI>la Porte de Vesins,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Mazarin</HI> was of another <HI>la Porte.</HI> At least this was said when the Mareshal <HI>de la Milleray,</HI> who was the Marquis's Father, had made his Fortune under the Ministry of Cardinal <HI>Richelien,</HI> with whom he was first Cousins. It is true, there were some who then alledged, that his Father the Advocate <HI>la Porte,</HI> was not descended of the Family <HI>de la Porte de Vessins,</HI> though he pretended to be of it; and the Mar∣quis <HI>de Vesins</HI> was not well pleased with his Pre∣tences, insomuch, that he would have challenged him for taking the Coat of Arms, that belongs to his Family, but that he was so afraid of the Car∣dinal's Greatness, that he spoke nothing of it, unless it was to some particular Friends, to whom he would sometimes say, by way of Jest, that those who ad∣vised him to enter into a Law-suit, with the Mare∣shal upon that account, gave him bad Counsel; that he did not see how it could be pretended, that the Ma∣reshal had done him any Dishonour, by entring him∣self a Descendant of his Family, that on the contrary, he look'd upon it, as an evidence that the Mareshal con∣sidered
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
his Family, as better than many others, for which he was much obliged to him.</P>
<P>This was not the first time, the King had been imposed upon, on such Occasions. The late Mar∣quis <HI>de Renel,</HI> had some Enemies at Court, who in∣sinuated to His Majesty, that he was but of a very late Family, so, that though he was a Person of great Merit, yet the King who has great Considerations for Birth, look'd upon him, as one of those, whom he ought not to advance so soon as others; for there are People, of certain Names and Ranks, who have some Right to hope, that they shall not lan∣guish so long as others do, in the meer Expectation of the Favours, which his Majesty uses to bestow upon his Subjects. However, this Marquis having a great Desire to be Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, and thinking, that he ought to have been preferred sooner, he took occasion to speak of it one day to the King, and fairly represented to him, what good Services he had done him. The King gave him a favourable Hearing, as he always uses to do to those, who address to him, though few of them have the Honour to be known to him. But when his Majesty was pleased to answer him, the Marquis was surprised to hear him say, that he was in the wrong to be so impatient, and that he belie∣ved, he had done as much for him, as for any Man of his Rank. That every Man ought to do him so much Justice, as not to think he was forgotten or neglected; though Persons of great Quality were preferred to him. That it was true, that Merit ought to be rewarded, wherever it was found, and that he had always had a special Regard to it, ever since he had governed by himself, but that there were certain Families, which he thought fit to prefer to others, for they had been always in possession of the most honourable Offices, and the highest Preferments, both at Court, and in the Ar∣my; and that he could not without Injustice, de∣prive
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
their Children of them, unless he found that they had degenerated from the Virtue of their An∣cestors. The <HI>Marquis</HI> soon perceived by this Dis∣course, that his Majesty had been possessed with a mean opinion of his Birth: But he was so far from cont adicting what his Majesty had said, in favour of those who had been of honourable Families, that he told him, it was for that very reason, that he thought himself neglected, that though he was not a Duke and Peer, or had not so much as any Office of the Crown, yet he was of as good a Family, as the most part of those, who had been advan∣ced to higher Posts: That his Ancestors had had the Honour to do good Services, to his Majesty's Royal Ancestors, and that so long as he followed their Example, he did not see, why he was not capable of any of those Offices, that are designed for Per∣sons of the best Quality. If the <HI>Marquis</HI> was sur∣prised at His Majesty's Discourse, the King was no less surprised at his. He had always thought, that the <HI>Marquis</HI> was one of those upstart <HI>Mar∣quises,</HI> of whom there are so many at <HI>Paris,</HI> and especially of Citizens, who take upon them this Title, though the Foundations of it were laid only in their Fathers Coffers, or in some Offices of the Gown, which some of their Family has enjoyed. And being desirous to be fully informed in this mat∣ter, he asked him, if it was not true, that had been told him, that he was only <HI>de la Noblesse Bourgeoise, i. e.</HI> one who derived his Pedigree, only from rich Citizens, or from those who had enjoyed Offices of the Long Robe, as was said of the late Arch∣bishop o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Paris.</HI> When I speak after this manner, it is in Imitation of the Bishop of <HI>Noyon.</HI> For that Prel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, who is the Glory of Prelates, yet not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in which he ought to be it▪ but only, be∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e he thinks, that no Man is comparable to him, for the Quality of his Ancestors: and speaking one day of the Family of that Archbishop, he said, that it
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
could not be called an Honourable Family, but only one of the best of those Families, that have been rai∣sed by Lawyers, or that had made a Figure among the Citizens of <HI>Paris.</HI> What he said was true upon the matter, for there is a great difference between a Family that is truly honourable, and such a Fami∣ly as he was speaking of; but sometimes, all the Truth should not be told, especially if there is a great man who may take it amiss: for some days after the Chief President of the Parliament, who is descended of the same Family, that the late Archbishop was of, made the Bishop of <HI>Noyon</HI> sensible of his Folly. The Bishop being come to dine with him, and his Coach∣man having carried home his Coach Horses, resol∣ving to return with them in the Afternoon; the Chief President, who had been informed of what he had said of his Family, and who is seldom upon the Re∣serve with any man, especially, if he have any Quar∣rel against him, no sooner saw him, but he gave or∣ders to the Steward of his House, not to serve up din∣ner, till he was gone. The Bishop staid till the or∣dinary time of Dinner was past, and long'd for it, but seeing no appearance of it, he asked the President if that was one of his Fasting Days, he told him plain∣ly, that it was not, but that he had given Orders, that no Dinner should be served up, till he was gone, because it would be too great Presumption in him, and a Token that he had forgotten the meanness of his Birth, which was but of the <HI>Noblesse Burgeoise,</HI> if he should offer to entertain at his Table, so great a <HI>Seig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> and one of such an illustrious Descent, as he was of; to this he added some other Words to the same Purpose; and the Bishop was puzzled what to say to him; but after some dull Apologies, he was for∣ced to go home and dine at his own House; yet he would fain have staid dinner with the President, be∣cause his Coach Horses were not there; but the Pre∣sident chose to let him have the use of his Coach, ra∣ther than he should have staid dinner at his House.
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
But to return to the Marquis <HI>de Renel,</HI> he said to the King, that he knew no such thing in his Family, as <HI>la Noblesse Burgeoise;</HI> that every one of his An∣cestors, wore a Sword by his Side, and if there were any of the Family that had not done it, it was be∣cause he was consecrated to the Church, as was the Cardinal <HI>d' Amboise,</HI> who had the Honour, to be the first Minister of the Crown. When he spoke of this Cardinal, the King perceived, that he had been imposed upon, by those who had made him believe, that the Marquis was but of a late Family, and of mean Extract. So that, afterwards he did him Justice, and gave him what he had asked.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Choiseul,</HI> who had discorded with his Lady, was reconciled to her, after his Return from <HI>Savoy.</HI> She could hardly be prevailed with to live with her Husband, and though she was fully as much to blame, as he was, for the Breach that was betwixt them; yet she pretended, that it was not safe for her to live with him. But the King told her, that she had but one of two Things to chuse, either to cohabit with her Husband, or to go into a Nunnery. The very Thoughts of a Nun∣nery, is enough to fright a Lady, especially, when she has any Inclinations to be a <HI>Coquette,</HI> so that the very speaking of it, was enough to oblige her, to obey his Majesty's Commands. But the King's Care extended farther than to those Ladies, who did not live as they ought to do with their Husbands, he took care also, to curb the Extravagancies of many others, even though they did not belong to the Court, and being informed, that <HI>Monsieur l' Ab∣bee Lionne,</HI> the Son of the late <HI>Monsieur Lionne,</HI> Minister and Secretary of State, and who enjoyed the Abbacy of <HI>Marmoutier,</HI> with a great many o∣ther rich Benefices, did not behave himself so well, as his Character obliged him to do, he sent him a Letter <HI>de Cachett,</HI> ordering him to retire into a Seminary. He also appointed one to stay with
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
him, and to take care, that when any Benefices, that were at his Gift, became vacant, he should neither diminish the Revenues of them, nor be∣stow them upon unworthy Persons. <HI>Monsieur l' Abbee Roullier,</HI> whose Father had made so great an Estate by the Post Office, that he settled all his Children, as if they had been Persons of some Quality, was also sent to the Seminary of <HI>Notre Dame de Vertus,</HI> with an Order to those that had the Inspection of him, that they should not allow him to correspond with any Person, and that they shou'd oblige him to do Pennance; for all this was necessary, to reduce him to a right sense of his Duty, seeing he had become a Rake, and led such a profligate Life, that he equally disgraced the Character of an <HI>Abbee,</HI> with which he had been honoured, and that of a Magistrate, with which he was also cloathed; for he was Coun∣sellor Clerk of the Parliament of <HI>Paris:</HI> But he had so little Regard to what became the Dignity of those two Places, that there was not a grea∣ter <HI>Debauche</HI> in all the City. But notwith∣standing all the Care his Majesty took, to repress Immoralities, and to oblige all Persons, to live suitably to their Characters; yet the Genera∣lity of them, were so far from answering that Design, that there were greater Abuses committed than ever. For where there was one, that was thereby prevai∣led upon, to abandon his former vices, there were Thousands, who thought it enough, if they were so far Hypocrites, as to please his Majesty by an out∣ward Appearance: so that Hypocrisie began then to come in fashion, and there were never so many <HI>Tar∣tuffes,</HI> or Hypocritical Puritans, as began to appear at that time, among People of all Ranks, especially, among the Courtiers, though one would think, that such a Character, did less become them than any o∣thers. For it seems to be peculiar to the Court, that though Dissimulation may be Learned there, better
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
than in any other Place, yet it is a diffimulation of a quite other kind, than what I am now speaking of. For when a Courtier dissembles, he does it, that he may procure to himself as many Pleasures and Con∣veniences, as he can, and to shun Troubles and In∣conveniences, and not to be his own Tormentor and Executioner, as the Hypocrites; who makes himself miserable in this world as well as the next, so that it is an ordinary saying, that an <HI>Hypocrite is tho De∣vils Martyr.</HI> Those who had new Opinions to Pub∣lish, could not have found a time more Convenient for their Purpose, than this was. There was a cer∣tain sect which had lain hid under the Ashes, ever since <HI>Molinos</HI> had Adventured to broach his wild sen∣timents at <HI>Rome,</HI> and it began now to appear again at <HI>Versailles.</HI> The Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who was <HI>Preceptor</HI> to the young Princes of <HI>France,</HI> and had the reputation of a very devout Man, declared him∣self zealous for this Sect: Those who were of it did teach by a subtil kind of reasoning, tho' to speak the truth they did not avow it plainly, that the Body might do all sorts of wickedness while in the mean time, the Soul might be altogether Innocent and unconcerned, as to what the Body did, for if the Intention of the Soul was directed to God and for his Glory, then it was not in the least to be blamed for the ill that the Body did, which is under a strange captivity to the cor∣ruption that is in mans nature. There was one <HI>Ma∣dame Guyon,</HI> a Lady of no great Quality, but of so great an Estate, that she had Married her Daughter to the <HI>Comte de Vaul,</HI> Eldest Son of <HI>Monsieur Fouquet,</HI> who had already endeavoured to Propagate this abo∣minable Doctrin, for which reason she had been sent to <HI>Vincennes.</HI> But the Archbishop, of <HI>Cambray</HI> un∣dertaking to defend her Publickly, he Published a Book, in which by an abstract way of Reasoning, which no Body was capable to comprehend, he en∣deavoured to show, that this Doctrine was not in the least erroneous. He alledged the Writings of <HI>St.</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
<HI>Francis de Sales</HI> to justifie himself, and pretended, that he taught nothing, but what had been formerly taught by that Holy Man. Every Body was asto∣nished at the sight of this Book, and it had never been Printed, if the Author had been obliged to ask a licence for it. But the Bishops have a Privilege to Publish what Books they Please, though their works be not Examined, by those who are Authorised to give Licenses for Printing Books: And this piece was published, before it was known, that he had begun to write it. All the Hypocrites were over∣joyed, that a way was found out, for them to gratifie their sensual appetites, while they outward∣ly appeared vertuous, which they thought them∣selves obliged to do, lest they should lose the Kings Favour. But they were not suffered long to boast of this Imaginary victory: For as soon as this Book appeared, the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> The Bishops of <HI>Meaux</HI> and <HI>Chartres,</HI> with many other Prelats de∣clared against it; and the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> began im∣mediately to write a refutation of it; and besides, he joyned with the Archbishop of Paris and the Bishop of <HI>Chartres</HI> (both which had a great Interest at Court) to deal earnestly with his Majesty, that the young Princes, the <HI>Dauphins</HI> Sons, might not be kept any longer, under the Direction of a Prelat, whom they accused of the most horrible Impieties, that had ever appeared in the Church.</P>
<P>The King knew not well what to say to this, because he had always looked upon the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI> as a Man of good Morals, and of Exempla∣ry Piety. And it must be confessed, that there was never any Prelat appeared more zealous for Gods Glory; for he was so far from having ever given any bad Example, that on the Contrary, he had been very useful for the Edification of those, who saw him or conversed with him. However, the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and those other two Bishops, gave his Majesty no rest, till they had obtained what they
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
desired, and what they thought necessary to be done upon such an occasion, and they prevailed with him at last, to order the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> to re∣tire to his own Palace, till fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther orders. But before he came there, he had occasion to Practise the Do∣ctrin which he had undertaken to defend; it is com∣monly called Quietism, the meaning of which is, that a Man ought never to be troubled at any thing, that can happen to him: Now the Archbishops Palace had taken fire, by the fault of some Servants whom he kept there, and it had consumed not only all the Buildings, but also all the Furniture of the House, which had been very richly Furnished. Every Body desired to know, how he would take this accident, but he appeared still as firm and unconcerned, as if he had been altogether dis-interrested, Mean while, many Persons of Quality were suspected of the same Errors, that were charged upon him, and among o∣thers, the Duke <HI>de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>villiers</HI> and his Brother in Law the Duke <HI>de Chevreuse.</HI> The first was Gover∣nour to the young Princes of <HI>France,</HI> whose <HI>Preceptor</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> had been; and the thoughts of this were uneasie to the King, till he was satisfyed in it by the Duke himself; the King discoursed with him a long time in his Closet upon this Subject, upon which he had likewise a long conference with the Duke <HI>de Chevreuse;</HI> after which it appeared, that his Maiesty was undeceived, both as to the one and the other; yet their Ladies, who had al∣ways been of the Number of those, who went to <HI>Marli,</HI> did not go there to often as they had used to do before that time, which made some People believe, that the King Dissembled a little in his Carriage to them. The Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> wrote in his own Vindication, and pretended, that all that he had said in that Book, was true and orthodox, and offe∣red to submit himself to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> while the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> accused him of Heresie more than ever. The <HI>Abbee de la Trape,</HI> who had
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
some years before, Renounced the Quality of an <HI>Abbee</HI> that he might compleat his Penance, which he had been long under, in the Quality of a simple Monk, Declared himself also Mr <HI>de Cambrays</HI> Enemy, without waiting till his Holiness should Pronounce any thing concerning his Book, tho this Archbishop had sent it to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might know his thoughts of it. The <HI>Abbee</HI> wrote two Let∣ters upon this Subject, which the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> caused to be Published, in the beginning of his own Book; he thought by this to strengthen his cause, and that since he had to do with an Archbishop, who was a Man of Learning and had many Friends, he ought not to neglect any thing, that could in the least support him in it. He also sent his Nephew <HI>Monsieur l' Abbee Bossuet</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might there employ all his Interest to have the Archbishop condemned; at which, many good People were of∣fended, for they thought, that when a Man acted only through Zeal, it was not fit to create him so much trouble. <HI>Madame Guyon,</HI> who by the Interest her Friends had made for her, was set at Liberty, fell into another Enthusiastick Fit, in favour of this Sect. she propagated it every where, and infected the House of St. <HI>Cir</HI> with it, so that it was found necessary, to put some of the Nuns of that House, into other Con∣vents. In a Word, the King took all the Measures, that Prudence could suggest to him, to crush these Errors, before they should do any harm to the Church. While he was at so much pains to pre∣vent the ill Consequences of this Debate, there were other debates broke out, in the Churches of <HI>Rheims</HI> and <HI>Roan.</HI> The Archbishop of this last City, had made a List of some Books, which he had recom∣mended to those of his Diocese, to be made use of, for resolving cases of Conscience; but had not mentioned any of those Books, which the Jesuits think fittest for that purpose: these good Fathers took this so ill, that some of them appeared in Print against him: the Arch∣bishop

accused one of their Number as the Author, he pretended to know his Stile, and demanded of the society of Jesuits, that they would do him Justice in punishing this Author. The Fathers denied that he was the Man, and he denied it himself; and they sent him to <HI>Paris,</HI> that he might withdraw himself from the Effects of the Archbishops anger, who was doing all the mischief he could against him, as well as against all the rest of that Society. He made an exact search after the Printer of the Pamphlet, that had been Published against him, and having kept some of them in Prison for some time, the whole business vanished into smoke for want of evidences. The Schism that broke out in the Church of <HI>Rheims,</HI> was also Occasioned by a debate between the Archbishop and the Jesuits. These had publickly maintained in the Schools of the Colledge which they have in that City, two things that the Bishop was not Pleased with. The first was, That the Doctrine which <HI>Moli∣na</HI> taught, concerning Grace, had been virtuous in all the attacks, that its Enemies had made against it The Archbishop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> who is no <HI>Molinist,</HI> censured these <HI>Theses,</HI> as full of Falshoods, and published an Edict, declaring that they did not contain the true Doctrine of the Church: he therein also censured some other Passages, which they had cited in another <HI>Thesis,</HI> and this Edict being conceived in Terms, that they were very much dissatisfied with, they did much the same, that those of <HI>Roan</HI> had done. They wrote against it, and exposed it. So that the Archbishop, to oblige them to do him Ju∣stice, was advised, to cause the Provincial and the Three Rectors of their Houses at <HI>Paris,</HI> to be cited, that they might declare, if this Pamphlet, which had been Printed in that City had been done by their Order, or without their order. The Author had been more circumspect than to put his Name to it,
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
and the Bookseller and Printer had concealed their Names: But the Author had said enough, to let the World know, that he had composed it, by Or∣der of his Superiours; and it was upon that ac∣count, that the Archbishop would oblige the Pro∣vincial and the Three Rectors, to make their De∣claration. After they had met in a Chapter, up∣on this Business, they were so foolish, as to de∣clare, that the Pamphlet contained nothing, but what was consonant to Truth; and what they were ready to defend, So that having made this Confession, the Archbishop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> gave in his Address to the Parliament, desiring, that Judgment might pass against them, and that they might be obliged to make a publick Reparation of the Injury they had done him, in publishing so scandalous things against him. In this Address he said, that if they preten∣ded, as it seem'd they did, that they had been inju∣red by his Edict; then the Laws and Customs of the Church taught them, that there were but Two ways, by which they could have Redress. The one was, to have made it known to himself, by repre∣senting to him, wherein he had injured them: But if they thought, that he would be too partial in his own Cause, and would not retract what he had once done, how unjust soever it might be to them; then the other way was, to have addressed themselves to the Primate. He represents also, that it was not becoming private Men, to expose the Conduct of an Archbishop, by seditious Pamphlets. That such a thing might be of dangerous Consequence, besides, that it was a Breach of Charity. The thing which had given occasion to all this, was capable to have revived the great Dispute concerning Grace, which had made so much noise in the beginning of this Age, and therefore the King thought it ne∣cessary to put a stop to this Law-Suit, and told Fa∣ther <HI>de la Chaise,</HI> that it was his Royal Pleasure, that the Society of Jesuites, should give Satisfaction
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
to the Archbishop of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and having called the Chief President of the Parliament to <HI>Versailles,</HI> that he might give him such Orders, as he judged ne∣cessary about this Affair. He took up I know not how much time, in discoursing with him of the best Methods, for putting an end to it. The Jesuites, who had made a foolish Step, in justifying every thing that was in the Pamphlet, were very glad, that the King had fallen upon a way, how they might evite the Shame and Disgrace, which would have infallibly come upon them, if the Parliament had proceeded to pronounce a Sentence. They went to the Chief President, and told him, they were ready to obey the King's Orders; the President told them, he was glad, they were come to a Resolu∣tion, that was so much for their Interest, as well as reasonable in it self. He concerted the whole matter with them, that they should draw up a Writing, by which they should acknowledge, that they had taken wrong measures, in not addressing to the Archbishop himself, as they ought to have done; that he might have been pleased to have heard them in their own Vindication; and promi∣sing that they should take that method for the fu∣ture, if ever they should be so unfortunate, as to have occasion to complain of him. And that in this Writing, they should intreat the Archbishop to par∣don what was past, and to receive them and their Society again into his favour. The President com∣municated this Writing to the King, before it was signed, that he might know how his Majesty was satisfied with it. The Archbishop could not demand any more, so that he was content to put an end to the Debate, provided they should sign that Pa∣per. Perhaps they would not haye done it, if the King had not interposed his Authority, but the good learned Fathers, knew better than others did, that Scripture commands us expresly to obey supe∣riour Powers; and therefore it was no hard matter
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
to perswade them to do what the Archbishop had de∣manded of them.</P>
<P>About the same time that the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray</HI>'s Opinions (of which I have already given some Account) made so much Noise, the Princess <HI>d' Har∣court,</HI> was obliged to go to <HI>Normandy,</HI> where her Husband's Estate lies, to look after his private Affairs: She had been long at Court, and had always found a way to preserve her Interest in it, in all the Changes that fell out; though there were many others that were fully of as good sense as she, who were not able to do so much. So soon as she was gone from it, it was reported, that it was partly upon her account, that the Archbishop had been cast out of favour. And many were of opinion, that she was a <HI>Quietist,</HI> and so much the rather, because she retired so often, sometimes into one Convent, sometimes into another. But a Lady, who thought she knew her bet∣ter than others did, said to those who were speaking of her, that they were mistaken as to that Princess, and that she was not for creating trouble to herself, by an indiscreet Zeal; and that she could be Surety for her, that till the King, as well as his Ministers be∣came <HI>Quietists,</HI> she should not be one: But if they should declare them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves once in favour of that Par∣ty, she would not then promise for her; for never Lady was more inclined than she, to perform exactly what was enjoined by St. <HI>Peter, to obey every Ordi∣nance of Man, whether the King as supreme, or those who are in Authority under him.</HI> Those who were concerned in this Lady, and had been under some fears, that the Reports of her being <HI>Quietist</HI> might be true, were well satisfied with this Account of her. Soon after, she returned from <HI>Normandy,</HI> and was not behind with any Lady at Court, in exclaiming a∣gainst <HI>Quietism;</HI> and spoke upon all occasions, of no less than Fire and Faggot, for those of that Per∣swasion.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133"/>
About this time, the Chief President's Son, was made a Counsellor of State, in the Place of <HI>Monsieur Pussort,</HI> who at last had paid that Tribute, which all men owe to Nature, after he had been Two or Three Years, without being able to go to the Counsel, of which he was Dean. He was Uncle to the late <HI>Mon∣sieur Colbert,</HI> Minister and Secretary of State, and he was as his Right-hand to him, when he was con∣triving ways and means for enriching the King, at his Subject-Cost. For he had laid down some Ma∣xims of his own, by which he determined always in favour of the Exchequer. And it was never seen, that he had been so much as in one single Instance, prevailed with, even by the strongest Arguments, to determine otherwise. So that in the Council, he got the Name of <HI>Pussort</HI> the <HI>Fiscal.</HI> And when any man was so unhappy, as to have a Law-suit with the King, he had reason to give over his Cause for lost, if it de∣pended upon his Vote. But at last, when he found himself at the point of Death, he began to reflect, that he must give an account of all these things; the Thoughts of them, put him under great fears. His Confessor endeavoured to encourage him, by repre∣senting to him the Mercies of God, who pardons all the Sins a man has been guilty of, so soon as he comes to repent of them. The Archbishop of <HI>Roan,</HI> who was his Grand Nephew, and to whom he had left some part of his Estate, as he did to all these, who were within the same degrees of Kindred to him; nay, and to the Marquis <HI>de Seignelai</HI>'s Children too, tho' they were farther removed than the rest. I say, the Archbishop spoke much to the same purpose to him, that the Confessor had done. But the poor man was still afraid, that he did it only as thinking thereby to comply with his Humour. And he was the more confirmed in this, when he observed, that the Arch∣bishop, when he had gone into the Withdrawing∣room, to bring the <HI>Viaticum,</HI> chided the Parson of St. <HI>Roche,</HI> that he had not caused him to be put in
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
his Bed, instead of exciting him, who was a dying man, to pay that Respect and Veneration to that God, in whose presence he then was. However, in a short time, he was called to give an account of all his Actions, before God's Tribunal; and his Heirs had 500000 Crowns of Estate, which he left them to divide among themselves. And there was not so much as one of them, had any use for his House to dwell in; and therefore they sold it to <HI>Monsieur Bertin,</HI> Treasurer of the casual Revenues, who is a man of the greatest Curiosity of any in <HI>Paris,</HI> in the matter of Houshold Furniture. And as those at Court entertain the King, with accounts of every thing that falls out, so it was told his Ma∣jesty, that Mr. <HI>Bertin</HI> had bought the House, and that when he came to dwell in it, it would look quite another thing, than it did while Mr. <HI>Pussort</HI> was alive. They told him also, that he had the finest Carpets in the World, better than any that were in his Majesties Palace. The King had the Curiosity to go and see them, and he ask'd him, how much they had cost him, and where he had bought them. He answered, that he had paid 200 Crowns for the Piece of them, at the Auction of the Marquis <HI>de Segnelai</HI>'s Furniture. The King said be∣fore all the Court, that that Minister had always dealt so by him, so that when any fine thing, was brought from the <HI>Indies,</HI> he gave him the Re∣fuse, and took all the best to himself. And he added, that he had never known a more vain∣glorious man, than that Marquis; or one that was so conceited of his own Personage, that his Vanity had made him oftimes fail in point of good Breed∣ing, and in the Respect he ow'd him; for without considering that he was speaking to his King, he would have ask'd him sometimes, if he did not think he was well dress'd, and if he had not a good Air. Mr. <HI>Bertin</HI> finding that the King had a desire for the Carpets, intreated his Majesty to accept of them
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
from him; the King took them, but would not have them in a Gift; but caused him to be paid the Money that he had given for them. There were Three Ladies who had been Friends of Mr. <HI>Pussort,</HI> that expected, he would have considered them in his Will: And for that end, had complied for se∣veral Years, with all his Humours; they had e∣very Night entertained him with Diversions suitable to his own Fancy, and he had never given them so much as a Cup of Water for a reward, except Two Meals that he gave them a Year. The one of them was Marchioness <HI>de Merce,</HI> who was his Wife's Niece, and the other Two Persons, I shall not name; but they had fully as great a Desire to have their shares of his Money, as she had. But they were quite frustrated in their Hopes, as well as she. There were a great many who made In∣terest for his Place of Counsellor of State, as well as for his other Place of Counsellor of the Council of the Royal Revenues, by which he had 18000 Li∣vers of Sallary: But the King gave this last to <HI>Mon∣sieur de Pommere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the other to the Chief Pre∣sident's Son, as I have already said. He had been Attorney General before; but because he had made no great Figure in that Post, his Father addressed to the King, that he would be pleased to bestow this upon him, and frankly told his Majesty, that his reason was, because his Son was not sufficiently qualified for being Attorney General; that when he purchased that Office for him, he believed that he had been capable of discharging it; but he found, he had been in a mistake, and that therefore he would be glad to have him eased of the Honour of that Bur∣then, which he was not capable to bear. This was thought an odd sort of a Compliment, from such a man as the Chief President of the Parliament: And those who heard of it, ask'd one another, if it was necessary, that a man, that was of the Par∣liament, should be of greater Parts, than he who
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
is of the Council, where the nicest Affairs of the Kingdom are treated of. For it could not be said, that it was the want of Memory, or the Art of speaking in publick, that made him incapable of the Office of Attorney General; for while <HI>Mon∣sieur Talon</HI> had been in that Post, he had shown a way how to supply those defects; he had always read his Pleadings, and as it was no shame to i∣mitate a man, who as all <HI>France</HI> confessed, had ac∣quitted himself honourably in that Office, therefore they concluded, that certainly his Father knew of something else, that made him incapable of it. However the Father's Merits supplied all the Son's Imperfections; insomuch that the King, not only granted his Request, but another favour also, which he had not ask'd. For he allow'd him to sell the Office of Attorney General to the best Advantage. Upon which, there were a great many offered for it, who were as incapable of it, as the President's Son was; and who had much more Money than Merit. They considered also, that as the Incapa∣city of his Son, had been the Cause of his being promoted to be a Counsellor of State; so they might at last come to some Promotion for the same reason. Among the rest, there was a Master of Requests, who was the Son of another Master of Requests, and he concluded, that this was the on∣ly way, how he could raise himself, to the greatest Offices of the Council. And therefore he offered Money for it, as others did, and believed, that he ought to have been prefer'd to them, because he excell'd them in the Art of pronouncing ill, and stuttering in his Speech; and had lately married a young Girl, which had made him be much con∣sidered. But the Chief President, made an ill step in Politicks; for whereas he ought to have chosen one of the meanest Qualifications, that he might thereby let the World see, that his Son was not the only Person, that was incapable of that Em∣ Employment:
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
The Man he bargained with was <HI>Monsieur Joli de Fleuri</HI> whose Father had been Coun∣sellor of the Great Chamber. He got Four Hundred Thousand Franks for it, which was more by 50000 Franks, than is usually given for such an office. Then People began to say of this New Attorney General, that it seemed he had no mind to be Raised to the Office of a Counsellor of State, in that way that the Presidents Son had been Raised to it. For so soon as he was Instal'd in his Office, he made it appear, by his Eloquence and his great Capacity, that he was far above the Ordinary sort of Attorneys.</P>
<P>While these things were a doing among the Law∣yers, the Duke <HI>de Lausun,</HI> who has been so tossed by Fortune, ever since he first appeared upon the stage of the World, was very diligent in a Law suit he had against his Ladies family. When he was near Sixty Years of Age, he had Married a Daughter of the Mareshal <HI>de Lorges,</HI> who was not above Sixteen. In which he Play'd the Fool as much as when he put in for the Command of the Army in <HI>Ireland.</HI> For it's Equal∣ly ridiculous, for a Man of Sixty to Marry a Girl of Sixteen, and for one that has never had any Com∣mand but over his own Domesticks or Day Lobourers, to Command an Army. Yet as good sense would qualifie him for the one much more than for the o∣ther, so he managed his Wife in such a way, that he never became one of those Husbands, whose wives make them to be Pointed at in the streets; he gave her as many fine Cloaths as she Pleased, and as much Money as was Needful for her diversions. But it was upon Condition, that she should not keep Com∣pany, but with some old Dotards, of whom he was not much affraid. For as to the young Sparks a∣bout the Court, she was discharged in any terms to see them, or to admit of any visits from them; For by his own Experience he knew the Frailty of young Ladies. All these Precautions were the more justi∣ficable, because if it was in his Power to Secure this
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
young Lady for himself alone, she was well worth all the Pains he would be at in doing it. And he left nothing undone, that was Necessary for that End. The Governess, whom he appointed to wait upon her, was well Advanced in years; she had once been with <HI>Madame de Guise,</HI> and he trusted much to her Virtue, she was as seldom from her as was possible for her to be, and it was a rare thing to see this young Lady without her Guardian. She had great ad∣vantages secured to her by her Marriage Contract, without which the Mareshal <HI>de Lorges</HI> would not have given her in Marriage to him. But the Mare∣shal and his Lady had not given him any portion with her, yet <HI>Fremout,</HI> who had ammassed many Milli∣ons of Money, by farming the Kings Revenues, which had been his Imployment almost fifty year, supplied the want of a Portion, for in the Marriage Contract he had Engaged to Leave them a Hundred Thou∣sand Crowns, after his Death, and when he died sometime after, the Duke <HI>de Lausune</HI> was surprised, that his Son <HI>Mr. D'Onneuil</HI> and the Mareshalls Lady who was his Daughter, had renounced all Interest in the Estate, and had brought from <HI>Languedoc,</HI> a Little Girl of Eleven Years of Age, who called her∣self his Relation, and Pleaded she should be his heir∣ess by the benefit of his Inventory. His Widow had also Renounced, yet before she did it, she had Con∣curred with his Children, to put the best and most Valuable things out of the way. Upon this the Duke found himself under a Necessity, either to Content himself with any Effects that he found still Remaining of the Inheritance, or to Enter into a Law Suit, a∣gainst the Widow and her Son. For as to his Father in Law and Mother in Law, he could not ask anything of them; For they had not signed the Grant which his Ladies Grandfather had made, in Prospect of the Marriage. Besides that, they adhered to that Grant, which he had made to themselves, when they were Married together, so that he had not any Reason
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
Imaginable, to sue them at Law. But he su'd the Mother and the Son, and pretended that they had secret Conveyed out of the way, the Effects of the Estate, and, that they ought to be Ordered to pay him an Hundred Thousand Crowns, in Ready Money, without putting him to the pairs of seeking for Payment, out of such Remains of the Estate, as did still appear. But this was not all he Craved of them, For besides this 100000 Crowns, for which, <HI>Fremon</HI> had payed Interest so long as he Lived as of a thing that was already acquired, he had pro∣mised them, a Hundred Thousand Franks, out of the whole Estate; but his Widdow and her Son had ad∣justed matters so, that all that was Remaining of the Estate, after the Debts were Payed, was but at most 100000 Crowns; so that they Designed to have fru∣strated the Duke of 100000 Franks, besides that they would have left him in hazard, of being called to an Account, by the King and his Ministers, as or∣dinarly all those are, who Marry the Daughters or Grand Daughters of Farmers of his Majesties Reve∣nues. Unless the Marriage Portion has been Payed in Ready Money. The Duke <HI>de Lausun</HI> who had no great Skill to Dispute his Ground in <HI>Ireland,</HI> chose rather to quit it in time, than to Expose himself to the dangers that Threatned him; if he had Stayed to Dispute it with Sword in hand; thought, he could better understand the Debates of the <HI>Pallais;</HI> and tho' he had no more Served an Apprentiship in this, than he had done, in the war yet he Armed himself with a strong Resolution to plead to the utmost; rather than Do, what Monsieur <HI>d'Onneuil</HI> would have obli∣ged him to. The case was Brought before the <HI>Reque∣tes du Palais</HI> because of the Quality of the Parties who had the Right of <HI>Committimus,</HI> for Mr <HI>D'Omneuil,</HI> was Master of Requests, besides that the Duke was not obliged to appear before any other Court of that kind, unless he had Pleased to do it. He was enra∣ged above what can be Expressed, at the Methods
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
that were taken by <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and <HI>Mr. D'Onneuil</HI> in which they had engaged the <HI>Mareshal de Lorges</HI> and his Lady, and therefore he enjoyned the Dutchess, that she should not see either of them: this did very much trouble this Lady as well as her Mother the Mareshals Lady, who Loved her Daugh∣ter tenderly, but the Duke told his own Lady, That when he Enjoyned her this, It was not so much for satisfying his own resentment of the Injuries they had done him, as because her Interest was Concern'd in the debate. For he could not expect to Live Long, and after his Death, she could not expect any thing of his Estate, but what was provided to her, by the Marriage Contract, and therefore, It was Necessary, he should use all sorts of Means, for Preserving to her, what she ought to have from him. That if she had nothing, but what they now offered her, the Effects they would give her, would be liable to a Chamber of Justice, whenever it should please the King to erect one, and that they might even make him pay a Tax, by the first Order of Council that should be given in that matter. And that therefore, she ought to make her Mother sensible, that there wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not any hopes of a Reconciliation with her, unless she should oblige her Brother and <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> to do him Justice. These words made a great Impression upon the Dutchess mind, and as it is Natural for very Body to desire Riches, even to the Prejudice of a near friend, so she observed her Husband<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commands so Exactly, that she refused to be present at the Ce∣remony, when one of her Sisters was to put on the Nuns habit, and to Enter into a Convent at <HI>Conflaus,</HI> till her Husband told her, that he was satisfyed, she should go thither.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Monsieur de Phelypeaux,</HI> the only Son of <HI>Monsieur de Pontehartrain</HI> Minister and Secre∣tary of State Married his Lady. Who was a Daugh∣ter of a Sister of his Fathers, who had been Married to the <HI>Counte de Roye</HI> of the Family of <HI>Rochefocant.</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
He had gone to pay her a Visit, and the Marriage was Concluded, within three Days after. The Bride had but 24000 Livers of Portion, and the King gave her 6000 Livers of Pension, of which she had 4000 before, which the King had granted her, when she Embra∣ced the Roman Communion. For her Father had Dyed a Protestant in England, where he rather chose to End his Days, out of his Countrey, and deprived of the Honours which he might have Expected, upon Account of his Birth and Merits, than to Renounce his Religion. The Countess <HI>de Roye</HI> was also in that Kingdom, and had Carried thither three of her Chil∣dren, that she might Educate them in their Fathers Religion; while the Rest of them, which were many, chose Rather to Embrace the Roman Religion. this Lady whom Mr. <HI>Phelypeaux</HI> Married, was in a Convent at <HI>Soissons,</HI> when her Marrige was Concluded, And her Relations having sent a Coach for her, and having appointed Changes of fresh Horses by the way, that she might come in all hast, she came to the Countess <HI>de Roucy</HI> Lodgings, who was her Eldest Brothers Lady; Monsieur <HI>de Phelypeaux</HI> pay'd her a visit there that very day, and he returned upon the morrow, and dined with her. The <HI>Chevalier de Roye,</HI> who was this young Ladies Brother, was at dinner with them, and finding that <HI>Monsieur de Phylipeaux</HI> had caused a great many pieces of Clothe of Gold and Silver to be brought to him, that he might chuse what Pleased him best, he said to the Countess <HI>de Rocy</HI> that if she did well, she would take him off a Vest of one of the pieces, of that was sold for 20 Louis <HI>D'Ors</HI> the Ell. Madame de <HI>Roucy</HI> was not over hasty in doing it, and the young Bride, having Chosen what Pleased her best, The Mercer went home, before the Chevalier <HI>de Roye</HI> had his de∣sire. But after he was gone the Chevalier fell a Jesting with Madame <HI>de Roucy</HI> and said it was a mean thing in her to have let the Mercer go away, with the Brocado stufs, before she had done what he desired of
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
her, that it was the least she could have done for the Honour of her Sisters marriage. <HI>Monsieur de Pheli∣peaux</HI> seemed not to take any Notice of what he said, but so soon as he was gone home, he sent Orders to that Mercer, that the next morning he should wait upon the <HI>Chevalier de Roy,</HI> by the time he had got up, with that piece of Stuff, and that he should let him have as much of it as he desired, the Mer∣cer obeyed his Orders, and made his Compliments to the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and told him the Commission he had got. The <HI>Chevalier</HI> finding he might take what he pleased of the whole Piece, took not only as much as would be a Vest, but as much more, as would line him a Coat. The Marriage was solemnized with∣in two Days after, and the King gave only 50000 Crowns to <HI>Monsieur de Phelypeaux,</HI> though he used to make a Present of 200000 Franks, to the Son of one of his Ministers of State, upon Occasion of his Marriage. But he told <HI>Monsieur Pontchartrain,</HI> that he was not so liberal as he used to be, and that the then Juncture of Affairs was the Cause of it. For the War forced him against his Will, to be a good Husband of his Money, but that the present Loss should be made up to them another time. <HI>Monsieur Pontchartrain</HI> was a man of too great sense, not to take this Compliment as he ought to do. And be∣ing very glad to have a Daughter in Law of so good Quality, he had the Satisfaction to hear every bo∣dy approve of the choice he had made for his Son. He certainly quite outdid all that the former Mini∣sters of State had done, for raising their Families, and those of whom his Daughter in law was descen∣ded, were far more illustrious, than the Families of the <HI>Souvrees,</HI> or the <HI>Alegres,</HI> or the <HI>Matignons,</HI> with whom <HI>Tellier,</HI> and the <HI>Colberts</HI> had marched, and the Family of <HI>Crussol</HI> of which the <HI>Marquis de Barbesieux</HI>'s first Lady was a Daughter, was far short of them, though it was honoured with the Title of Duke and Peer of <HI>France.</HI> Next morning after this marriage,
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
there was 500 <HI>Loüis d'Ors,</HI> put under the young mar∣ried Lady's <HI>Toilette.</HI> Which was but a small Sum for a Lady of her Quality, there being ordinarily a greater Present made, to a <HI>Partizans</HI> Daughter. But the Evening before, she had got a Present of a little Box, with a great many fine Toys in it, and she found in the Bottom of it, a little Box full of Ear rings and Jewels.</P>
<P>Every Body went and paid Visits to the new mar∣ried Couple, and the Dutchess <HI>de Lausun,</HI> having gone to pay her Compliments, she saw her Mothers Lacqueys in the Antichamber, by which she knew, that she was there. And being unwilling to be found in Company with her, least she should ostend her Husband, she went out of the Room, designing to go home, though she had already caused notice to be given, that she was there. This was told to <HI>Ma∣dame de Phelypeaux,</HI> and to <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain,</HI> who was then in company with her, and who sent to call back the Dutchess, and went and spoke to her, and brought her into a Closet, and put her in company with her Mother. The Dutchess was once in hopes to have been married to <HI>Monsieur Phelypeaux</HI> and his Mother <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain</HI> would have been extremely glad, that she had been her Daugh∣ter in Law: But the Duke <HI>de Lausun,</HI> making his Addresses to her at the same time; the Mareshal <HI>de Lorges,</HI> who knew that the Duke was worth 100000 Livers a Year, loved rather to see his Daughter a Dutchess, than Daughter in Law to a Mi∣nister of State. This had made some Misunderstandings for some time, between <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain,</HI> and the Mareshal's Lady, but they were reconciled by this Marriage, and she was the first that told the Dutchess, that she ought to live in a better Corre∣spondence than she did with her Mother. The Ma∣reshal's Lady told her the same, and charged her with Ingratitude, since she knew well enough, how ten∣derly she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad always loved her. The Dutchess told

her, that if she pleased, she might easily remove the Cause, which she had to complain of her. That she wished for nothing more, than to see her frequent∣ly, and to live in good Terms with her, and that it was very unpleasant to her, to be deprived of that Happiness. But she was obliged to obey her Hus∣band, and it was in her Mothers Power, to cause Ju∣stice to be done him, and then all difficulties would be removed, that besides, if she loved her, as much as she said she did, she would cause ready money to to be paid to the Duke and her, that what they got might be exempted from those after Enquiries, to which the Estates of Farmers of the Kings Revenues are lyable. The Mareshal's Lady having no Incli∣nation to do any such thing, or perhaps being afraid that the doing it, might discover all the Effects, which had been conveyed out of the way, that her Mother, Brother and herself, might be secured from such an Enquiry, answered her, that she demanded what was impossible for her to grant: That she could not expect more than what she could have out of her Grandfathers Estate, and that to ask more, was a Proof, that she considered her own Interest, rather than what was reasonable. The Dutchess replied, that notwithstanding all she said, yet the Duke her Husband believed, that he did not demand any thing, but what was reasonable, but since she and her Friends were all of another Opinion, and he was positive in his Resolutions, it was not likely they would soon agree, that for herself, she was extremely vexed at it, because she found herself deprived of all that sweet Converse, she might have with her Parents, without any hopes of a Recon∣ciliation, because she knew her Husband to be of such an humour, that it was almost impossible to dissuade him from any thing that he had resolved upon. And he was certainly as headstrong, as a She-Mule, when he had got any thing once in his Head, and instead of being softned, by the Account the Du∣chess
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
gave him of her Mothers Grief, because she and they were not good Friends, he was more in∣censed against them, than before. And he not only prosecuted his Law-suit, but petitioned the Coun∣cil, that he might be allowed to bring it before other Judges, pretending that he having accused <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and her Son, for having intermeddled with the Estate of the deceased, they ought to plead their Cause before the Court of <HI>Aides,</HI> and not before the <HI>Requetes du Palais,</HI> by which we may perceive, that while he endeavoured to secure himself, against an Enquiry, he endeavoured to expose his Lady's Grand mother and her Uncle to one. This enraged them more than ever against him, especially because it was their Interest, that the World should not know, that <HI>Monsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Fremont</HI> was so rich, as he truly was when he died. For it is a Crime for those who farm the Revenues, to die so rich, and their Heirs are ordi∣narily called to account for it. They had a Thou∣sand Instances of this in other People, and though they had not had any, yet they had lately had an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance that concerned them nearly, and which no doubt, put them under great Apprehensions.</P>
<P>One who had been a Deputy or Clerk to Mr. <HI>Fre∣mont,</HI> was dissatisfied with him, perhaps because he had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t considered him in his Will, or it may be, because he had not made any great Fortune, while he was in his Service. However, he came to <HI>Monsr. Pentchartrain,</HI> and informed him, that he knew a certain place, where his deceased Master had hid 4000000<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Money, that he himself had assisted in putting it there; so that he spoke nothing, but what he knew to be certainly true. He was so po∣sitive in what he had said, that it was impossible for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Pentchartrain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to believe him; and there∣fore, he sent Orders to the Intendant at <HI>Roan,</HI> to go to the place, where this Deputy had told him the Money was hid, which was in a Cellar of a Castle, which <HI>Fremont</HI> had bought in <HI>Normandy.</HI> This De∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nither also, by order of the same Mi∣nister,
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
that he might point out the very Place, where it was hid. But when the Intendant had gone thither, and made as exact a Search, as was possible for him, there was nothing found. The Deputy thought to have excused himself, by saying it had been taken away, since the time that he had put it there: But as no Man should think to deal thus by a Minister of State; for they would be every day imposed upon, if those who offered to do it, were not punished for it: He was sent to Prison, and no doubt he deserved it, though he had not been guilty of any thing but of designing to ruin the Family of that Man, by whom he had acquired all the Estate he had; however the Duke <HI>de Laus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> pretending that if it was not in that place; that <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and her Son, had hid her Husband's and his Father's Treasures; yet as he pleaded before the Council, the Case ought to be referred to the Court of <HI>Aides;</HI> and his rea∣sons were, that it belonged to that Court, to take Cognisance of the Estates of Farmers of the King's Revenues, wherein the King himself was concerned directly or indirectly. That in the Case between <HI>Madame Fremont,</HI> Mr. <HI>Onneuil</HI> and him, the King's Interest was manifestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncerned, seeing the Que∣stion was, if they had concealed the Effects, that had belonged to a man imployed in the King's Revenues. There was scarce any Person of Note or Interest, whether at Court, or in the City, but solicited the one or for the other Party: And though the Mareshal <HI>de Lorges</HI> and his Lady, seem∣ed not to concern themselves in the Business, in which it was thought, that if they would declare themselves, it would be in favour of their Son in law and their Daughter, rather than for <HI>Madame de Fremont,</HI> and her Son; yet they solicited under-hand for these. They considered, that besides that the Me∣mory of the deceased ought to be dear unto them, not only because he was the Father of the Mareshal's
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
Lady, but because he had been a great Benefactor to them, both before and after their Marriage. They ought therefore, to do all that was in their Power, for saving his Estate from being seized. They thought it was very likely, that though the Stroak could not fall upon themselves, because of the Precautions they had taken, both in their Marriage Contract, and in the Gifts they had afterwards received, yet it might fall upon their Daughter, who instead of having the 100000 Crowns, that <HI>Madame de Frem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> and Mr. <HI>d'Onneuil</HI> were willing to pay her, she might be in hazard of losing the whole of it.</P>
<P>These Solicitations and under-hand Dealings, how close soever they were kept, yet came to the Duke's Ears, and enraged him to a greater degree, against his Father in law and Mother in law; so that it was ob∣served of him, that he took as much pains, to ob∣tain what he had desired of the Council, as he did Four or Five Years ago, to shun the Weight of King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s Arm. But all the pains he took, turned at last to his Confusion, for he was cast before the Council, and the only thing that the Chancellor said to him that could please him, because of the Hatred he bore to his Ladie's Grandmother and Uncle, was, that when such People as the deceased had been, did marry their Daughters or Grandaughters to Per∣sons of Quality, it was the first Step they made, to restore to the Publick, what they had robb'd it of, but by the good leave of that Magistrate, I do not think, that the Name of Restitution, agrees well to such an Action as that. For to restore a thing, is to give it back, after it has been taken, and to give it back to the rightful Owner too; but for a Man to loaden his Children or Grandchildren with Money, and by great Wealth to purchase to them a Blood that cannot mix with theirs, without some sort of Shame, and then to call this Restitution, was an odd way of speaking; and it is the first time I ever heard it call'd so. The Duke <HI>de Lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
being cast by the Council, and the Case remitted back to the <HI>Requêtes du Palais,</HI> their Friends offer'd to mediate for an Agreement between them. They per∣swaded the Duke, as well as <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and her Son, to submit the Cause, to the Arbitration of Two Counsellors of State; and having chosen <HI>Monsieur de la Reine,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur de Ribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> they told the Duke, that these Two Magistrates, being great Lovers of Justice, would give him as much satisfaction, as the <HI>Requêtes du Palais</HI> would do, provided he had a just Cause. But having got private Intelligence, that he could not expect great satisfaction from these Two Counsellors of State, and that they had said, that they did not think, that the Widow or Children of a <HI>Donor,</HI> could be obliged to pay ready money, when the Deceased had not left any, he became so suspicious of them, that he recalled a Blank he had signed, with an Obligation to acknowledge them for Judges. And would prosecute the Matter in all the Forms, before the <HI>Requetes du Palais,</HI> who laugh'd at his Pretensions, and a merced him in the Expences of the Suit.</P>
<P>If <HI>Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont</HI>'s pretended hidden Treasure mde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a great noise, and made many People say, that there was never a Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isan, <HI>i. e.</HI> one that Farms the King's Revenues saved, since he, who had robb'd the Peo∣ple of so much money by his Extortions; had not been at pains to restore any part of what he had robbed; yet there was one of them, that gave some grounds to think, that there are some People of that Employment, who sometimes think of their own Salvation. But I do not know, if it be enough for a man to think upon it, only as he did; for I think if a man be as much concerned in it, as he ought to be, he must join Effects and Deeds to his Thoughts, whatever may be the Result of them. However, this Business made as great noise, as the pretended hidden Treasure did, of which I gave just now an Ac∣count. One of these Farmers of the Revenues, (whose
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
Name I have forgot) died, and left Two Children, behind him, who did not live in great Friendship to∣gether; which happens often betwixt Brothers. The Father had in his Will considered the one, much more than the other; with which this last was very ill plea∣sed, and resolved to make his Brother uneasie, and threatned to tell Mr. <HI>Fonchartrain,</HI> of their deceased Father's Management; unless he would let him have an equal share in the Estate. I know not if he was such a Fool to do what he threatned, or if one who had been his Father's Clerk, had done as Mr. <HI>Fre∣mont</HI>'s Clerk did. But <HI>Mr. Ponchartrain,</HI> being in∣formed soon after their Father's Death, that there was something found among his Papers, that might turn to the King's Advantage; he sent a Commissary from <HI>Paris,</HI> to seal up all the Papers, which he had in the place where he died. It was within the Ge∣nerality of <HI>Alencon;</HI> and Mr. <HI>de Pommereu</HI>'s Son, who was Intendant of it, receiving Orders to be present, when the Cabinets, Coffers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were to be sealed; the whole Business was done, with all the Precautions, that could possibly be taken, in a matter, wherein they were afraid to be cheated. And the Intendant left a Garrison to continue there, till the Seals should be taken off. This Business fright∣ned all the <HI>Partisans,</HI> who were afraid, their Chil∣dren and Goods might be used the same way after their Deaths. But because in the time of so burthen∣some a War, the Court had often need of them, it was not thought convenient to discourage them, and therefore a Report was spread among the People, that the reason why the Papers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the deceased were sealed up, was because he had made a Will in favour of the King. When they had observed all the Forms that were usual on such Occasions, so that there was no reason could be given for any farther delay, the Intendant returned from <HI>Alencon,</HI> to assist at the opening of the Seals, which was done with all the usual Formalities, and in the Inventory of the Papers
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
which had been left by the Deceased; it was found there were Two Papers, by which the Partisan had declared, that God had given him Grace to examine his Conscience, and that he would not adventure to go into the other World, without restoring what he had taken wrongfully. In the first of these Papers, which clearly appeared to have been first done, tho' it was neither dated or signed; he said, that he had by indirect and unjust methods, gain'd 100000 Crowns, during the time he had been concerned in the Revenues, so that it was his Will, that his Heirs might restore that Sum to the King; as for the other Paper, it was found to have been written after the former, for it contained a Declaration, that after a mature and serious Reflection, upon all the Business he had been concerned in, he found that he had made an un∣just Acquisition of 400000 Livers; so that it was his Will, that his Children should restore it to his Majesty, out of his Estate. The Intendant sent Copies of the two Papers to Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> who in such a matter, would not rely upon his own Judgment, which was, that tho' they were not dated or signed, so that they would not signifie any thing between Two private Per∣sons; yet it might be otherwise, when the King was concerned in them. He therefore consulted all those, whom he thought capable to determine so nice a Que∣stion; some were of one opinion, and some of another. Those who were more for the Forms of Law, than for material Justice, did not think that the Heirs of the deceased could be sued in Law; seeing such Papers were not regarded in any Court of Justice. But on the other hand, those who followed the Maxims of Mr. <HI>Pussort</HI> the late Dean of the Council, (who, as I have already said, voted always in the King's favour whether his Majesty was Plaintiff or Defendant) made use of his Authority to prove, that the King had good reason to demand the 400000 Livers mentioned in the last of the Two Papers.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151"/>
Besides this Authority, which they reckoned upon as a Law, that had taken place in the time of a great Minister, who had reformed the State, and had put the King's Affairs into an excellent Condition; by the prodigious Taxes that had been laid upon the Par∣tisans; they alleged also, that when a man did ac∣knowledge, in a Paper written with his own Hand, that he had unjustly acquired such a Sum of money, that was by a Thousand times a more convincing Proof, than all the other Proofs; that could possibly be had. <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sieur Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chartr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI> was much of the same opinion, as the truth is, a man can hardly be of a∣nother: Yet there are certain Rules of Law, which must be observed, least the Laws themselves, to which they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late, should be violated: And therefore he spake nothing either for it, or against it, unless that it was to be wished, that all the Partisans, which had been formerly taxed, had done as this man did; since that would have been an established Rule by which the King might have legally demanded, what they had cheated him of. Because of this Ex∣pression, it was thought that he was much of <HI>Mr. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssort</HI>'s mind, as to the Partisans; yet it was an Expression no man could find fault with; for besides, that common sense will not allow a man to accuse himself unjustly, he was obliged to say all this, as suitable to his Office: However, all the Effects of the deceased Farmer of the Revenues were seized, so that, though he who had been the Informer in this matter, had not promised to find out 40000000 as <HI>Mr. de Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont</HI>'s Clerk had done, yet the Infor∣mation was found to be truer. The great need the King had of money at that time to support the War, was the reason, that this Minister thought it not proper, to neglect such a Business: Though to speak the Truth it was so small a matter, in com∣parison of what was needful to the support of that War, that it was no more capable to do it, than it is for a drop of Water to quench a great Flame.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152"/>
Though the King had been already necessitated to make a great many Edicts, yet he was still obliged to make new ones; and one among the rest, which gave occasion to a witty Ex∣pression of the <HI>Duke de Ferte</HI>'s, at least it was reckoned witty, by some little pretenders to Wit; though I confess, I am not of their mind, whether it be that I am but an ill Judg, or that they have been mistaken at that time. This Edict was concerning Coats of Arms belonging to Families. All the People of Quality were striving, who should make the best Projects for bringing in Money to the King; for they knew His Majesty would reward them for it; and most of them had need of some reward, because of the great Expence they were at, in the Army and at Court. The Dutchess of <HI>Ro∣quelaure</HI> was the Author of this Project, and had a good Re∣ward for it, and being come to <HI>Versailles</HI> some days after, with a very rich Petticoat; many of those little Pretenders who were standing round about the Duke <HI>de la Ferte,</HI> who made them sometimes laugh, desired him to take notice of that rich Petticoat, and to admire it. He said that it was no wonder it was rich and fine, seeing it was strew'd and deck'd with all their Scutcheons. This was the witty Expression that was so much talk'd of: Though I thought there was as little Wit in it, if not less, than in another which he had some days after, upon occasion of the King's going to S. <HI>Germain en Laye</HI> to pay a Visit to K. <HI>James</HI> and his Queen. Those who were with the Duke asked him, why the King went so often thither, he said, he did not exactly know what might be his Majesty's Reason, but he guessed, that the General Peace being now upon the point of being concluded; so that K. <HI>James</HI> could not stay any longer in that Kingdom: The King went to ac∣quaint him with the Article of Six Months stay: Every bo∣dy was perswaded, that seeing by this Peace, the King was to acknowledge King <HI>William</HI> for Rightful King of Great Britain; K. <HI>James</HI> would not stay and see his Ambassadors come to His Majesty's Court, and that therefore he would go to <HI>Rome,</HI> or at least to <HI>Avignon,</HI> to conceal his Misfortunes. But as he has learned by the Exercises of Piety and Devotion, which he has practised these many Years past, to take the saddest events as from the hand of God; so it is now found, that the Duke <HI>de la F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rte,</HI> was out in his guessing, when he thought that this Prince would soon leave S. <HI>Germains.</HI> Yet K. <HI>James</HI> resolved not to let the Peace be concluded, without making the Confederates sensible, that the Alliance they had entered into, with K. <HI>William,</HI> for setting him upon his Throne, might be of dangerous consequence to themselves. He cau∣sed a <HI>Manifesto</HI> to be drawn up, and copies of it to be given to all the Ministers of Princes and States, that were concerned in the Conferences at <HI>Reswick.</HI> In this <HI>Manifesto,</HI> he vindica∣ted himself from an Imputation, that his Subjects had char∣ged
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
him with; which was, that he had been always so strict∣ly in the Kings Interests, that he would never enter into any Treaty, with any other Potentates, for reducing his Power which was become formidable to all <HI>Europe.</HI> And the Confe∣derates themselves, who had often endeavoured to gain him, but could never prevail (whether it was that he was really in his Majesty's Interest, or that he thought it was for his own Interest, not to engage in War against him) made also use of the same pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt, when they deserted him. For when he sent some of his Servants to their Courts, (after K. <HI>William</HI> was entered into <HI>England</HI>) and desired them, that they would not give any assistance to that Prince, they met with so very cold a reception, that it is impossible to find its Parallel. And the Pope himself did as it were mock at him, so that the Person whom he sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> brought nothing back, but Beads instead of Summs of Money; tho' he informed his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liness, that the true Reason of his Misfortunes, was, that he had zeal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usly endeavoured to re-establish the Roman Ca∣tholick Religion in his Dominions; but how much soever it was the Pope's Interest to have protected him upon that ac∣count: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Holiness had his own share in those fears, which the King's great Power gave to all the other Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> so that he would not hearken, either to what Religion advised him to, or to what the Ordinary Interest of Popes uses to suggest to them on such occasions. After K. <HI>James</HI> had published his <HI>Manifesto,</HI> he met with the same treatment be had met with before; for tho' he clear'd himself, as well as he could, from the accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation I have already mentioned; and endeavoured also to make the Consederates sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble, that they might come to fall under as great Misfortunes, as had befallen him, if they should sufter that by the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaty of Peace, which was upon the point of being concluded, the Prince of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> should be acknowledged King of <HI>England:</HI> Yet they did not think it convenient, to treat him better than they had done before. So that there being no hopes left him, of being restored to his Throne, unless some great Re∣volution should happen in his Country: He intreated the King, that what Treaty soever he should make with his Ene∣mies, yet he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight never oblige him, to go to any great di∣stance from his Court. He thought Prudence obliged him to ask this of his Majesty: For he remembred, how after his Fa∣ther's misfortunes, his Brother and he had been forced to de∣part out of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance,</HI> where they thought to have found pro∣tection.</P>

<P>K. <HI>James</HI>'s Manifesto had no effect. It be∣ing the Interest of all the Confederates to keep K. <HI>William</HI> upon the Throne, that he had mounted by the unanimous consent of his People, they took no notice of it. The Plenipotentiaries, at the <HI>Reswick</HI> Treaty, carry'd on the Conferences without any great Concern in his Interest. All that <HI>France</HI> could do on his behalf, was, a secret Article providing for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een, his Wife's Joynture, to be sign'd at the same time with the Treaty. The insignificancy
<PB N="2" REF="155"/>
of this <HI>Manifesto,</HI> appear'd in his most Christian Majesties Declaration to all the Allies; that he own'd K. <HI>William</HI> as the lawful King: With∣out which Article, he could expect no Accommo∣dation. This accknowledgment did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch perplex that Prince, who went upon sure grounds: For in the Articles of Peace propos'd by the King, when his Plenipotentaries offer'd to state that Article, he advis'd 'em to dash it out, because he knew, very well, how to keep up the Dignity confer'd upon him by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> with the Succours of his People and Allies: So that this Question was to bear no Fi∣gure among those contested by the respective Parties.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Armies, pursuant to their usual Custom, made preparations for the Field; and the King having re-enforc'd his Troops, with those he had recall'd from <HI>Italy,</HI> would not listen to the Truce that was offer'd to him by the Allies. The Mareshalls <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and <HI>Boufflers,</HI> Commanded the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> which was the most considerable. But tho' they succeeded to the command the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> had before his Death, yet they were far short of succeeding to his Reputation. <HI>Vil∣leroy,</HI> for his first Adventure, suffer'd the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> to escape, whom he might have entirely defeated: And his carelesness, not to mention his Insufficiency, occasion'd the loss of <HI>Namur Boufflers</HI> having thrown himself into that Place, made so sorry a Defence, that, after his return from that Expedition, L' <HI>Apparat,</HI> who was chief Engineer at the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> told him to his Face, That if he had been with∣in the Walls of <HI>Namur,</HI> it had either been still in the King's Hands, or else he had cut off a great part of K. <HI>William's</HI> Army. The <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣shal</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="156"/>
was mightily surpriz'd with this Discourse, which seem'd to charge him either with Cow∣ardice, tho', indeed, <HI>L' Apparat</HI> was mistaken if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> took that for his weak side, or else with want of Experience: for one of these two must needs have occasion'd the loss of that Place: However he reply'd, That his success before <HI>Barcelona</HI> made him take such measures as be∣came him very ill; and that he would make him eat in his words, were it not that he knew he had receiv'd some Blows on the Head, which had turn'd his Brains. <HI>L' Apparat</HI> made Answer, That the Mareshal ought not to apply to him∣self what he mean'd of another: that he pray'd God to forbid that ever he should censure his Conduct; that he was very sensibIe of the defe∣rence and respect that was due to him; that he only mean'd, that Mr. <HI>de Megrigny,</HI> who was employ'd to defend <HI>Namur</HI> in the Quality of <HI>Engineer,</HI> had acted his part so very ill, that he would not stand to affirm that he either wanted Courage, or at least, had forgot himself. By this means, <HI>L' Apparat</HI> clear'd himself: And the <HI>Mareshal</HI> was very well pleas'd to see him throw upon another, what he had apply'd to himself. But Soldiers do not always examine things so nicely; whoever has the General Com∣mand, they impute all their good or bad Success to him. The whole Army regretted the loss of their late General. Besides, there was a vast difference between him, and those who fill'd his Post. Mareshal <HI>Villeroy</HI> was puff'd up with a great Opinion of himself, tho', at the same time, he never had done any thing upon which he could ground so much concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edness. On the contrary, the Soldiers call'd to mind, how contemptuous∣ly his Father treated him upon his return from the Siege of <HI>Lisle,</HI> by reason of some Charge
<PB N="4" REF="157"/>
laid against him, insomuch, that if he had not, by a desperate turn, retriev'd his Reputation in the Conquest of the County, which happen'd the next Year, he had run the risque of never returning. As for Mareshall <HI>Boufflers,</HI> 'tis true, he could not be charg'd with any such thing; for he was so cautious and irresolute, that 'twas manifest he was a stranger to that Presumption, that render'd the other unsupportable. But, af∣ter all, this irresolution spoke him diffident of himself; for which reason, the Soldiers said, The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> read what he had to do in his Hunch; but neither of the present Ge∣nerals could find any thing in their Heads.</P>
<P>Some Hours before that General's Death, he call'd the Duke of <HI>Montmoran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> his Eldest Son, to his Bed-side, and gave him to know, that to make him easy, he behov'd to give him a Pro∣mise, which would afford him some Comfort in his Passage to the other World. The Duke of <HI>Montmorancy</HI> promising Obedience to his Commands, the poor dying General buoy'd up with Hopes, told him, <HI>That since he had been long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Marchioness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f</HI> Belle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onds, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be the Fool to Marry her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, not to Marry her, when his Eyes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> This Lady was the Duke of <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Her Father's Devourness occasion'd her being Married to the Marquis of <HI>Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fonds;</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his Father, was as devout as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quis was not a proper ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for her: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er the Estate, nor a thousand other things, that a Lady, of her Quality, might have expected in a Husband. However, as Children do not always follow their Father's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot-steps, so the Marquis was not near so devc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t as the Maresh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll; upon which account,
<PB N="5" REF="158"/>
the Duke of <HI>Mazarin</HI> frequently repented that he had made him his Son-in-Law. At last, after the Marquis had liv'd some time with the Duke's Daughter, he was Kill'd at the head of his Regiment in the Battle of <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enkerke.</HI> The Government of <HI>Vincennes,</HI> being given by the Duke of <HI>Mazarin</HI> with his Daughter, be∣came vaca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by the Marquis's Death; so that the Marchioness was but in sorry circumstances for a Lady of Quality: For tho' the King gave that Government to her Son, and the survivor∣ship to the Maresh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of <HI>Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fonds,</HI> yet the in∣comes arising to her out of her Husband's Estate, were but very narrow. 'Twas for this reason, that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> fear'd his Son's Marrying of her, he being then a Widdower by the Death of his Wife, who was a Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Chevreuse.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Montmo∣rancy,</HI> whom his Father never press d to any thing that was not to his advantage, readily com∣ply'd with his Father's Demands in giving his Promise. Two Days after, the Duke of <HI>Luxem∣burg</HI> Died, and his Son resolv'd to stand to his Promise, tho' he continued still to visit the Wid∣dow, and even became more in Love with her than before: However having no Issue by his Wife, and being a Person of a great Figure in regard of the Government of <HI>Normandy,</HI> which his Father had procur'd him, he had a mind to Marry again. The Marchioness of <HI>Seignelay</HI> was a proper match for him, both for Estate and Quality. She was very handsome, and her Age bore a suitable proportion to his. But this Lady, being the Widdow of a Minister of State, in whose life-time every body stoop'd to her, stood upon the point of Honour, when she preceiv'd that the Duke's Agents pretended, that she behov'd to give the Duke considerable odds,
<PB N="6" REF="159"/>
because she had Children; after which she would never hear of the Proposal agen. She thought, that notwithstanding her Widdow-hood, she was, at any time, as good as the Duke of <HI>Montmor∣ancy,</HI> who had assum'd the Title of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> after his Father's Death; and that it became him to treat with her at even hands. The Duke finding she would not give him any thing, look'd out for a Wife else-where; and having pitch'd upon the only Daughter of the Marquis of <HI>Cle∣rembaut,</HI> who had formerly a place in <HI>Monsieur</HI>'s Houshold, Married her a few Days after. She was but fourteen Years of Age, and was very Pretty, tho' she was not a Beauty. Her Mother being the Widdow of Count <HI>du Plessis,</HI> the present D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of <HI>Choiseul</HI>'s Eldest Brother had Married her Husband for Love; and being acquainted with the Pleasure of the Conjugal State, when Man and Wife live in perfect Union, would needs put her Son-in-Law upon the same Foot with the Marquis of <HI>Clerembaut.</HI> She us'd all man∣ner of perswasives to oblige him to keep Com∣pany with no Woman but his Wife. But the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> having Married her Daugh∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r only for his Interest, and having always Lov'd the Marchioness of <HI>Bellefonds,</HI> did not like her Remonstrances. He told her, all the World was not like her Husband; and scarce any body but himself, could confine their Ad∣dresses to one Woman. His Mother-in-Law, not discourag'd by this answer, renew'd the at∣tack several times. She would even oblige him never to see his Mistress again: But the Duke would never give her his Promise to that effect; upon which she put the shrew upon him, and treated him, just as if the regulation of his Conduct had been her Province. The Duke did not like her ways: However, to make her sen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible,
<PB N="7" REF="160"/>
that <HI>that</HI> was not the way to win, or break him, he re-doubled his visits to the Marchioness of <HI>Bellefonds.</HI> This put the Old Woman into a Passion. She teaz'd her Son-in-Law so incessantly, that he was oblig'd to tell her, he would either take away his Wife to an∣other House (for they liv'd all together, the Mother-in-Law and her Husband being oblig'd, by the Contract of Marriage, to give them both Lodging and Diet) or else Dine and Sup always abroad. And, indeed, he was as good as his word: But when he saw all his Remon∣strances were ineffectual, he began to lye out in the Night: sometimes in the <HI>Bagnio</HI>'s, and sometimes in <HI>Luxemburg-House,</HI> which was still furnish'd. But all this was so far from producing the proposed Effect, that his Mo∣ther-in-Law grew still more uneasy, and trou∣blesome, insomuch, that he was quickly oblig'd to leave her for good and all.</P>
<P>This Duke had three Brethren, and two Sist∣ers, one of which Married the Prince of <HI>Neu∣schattel,</HI> as I intimated above; The other was shut up in a Convent, but would willingly have come out if she could. As for the Brethren, one of them was hunch-back'd like his Eather: For which reason, the late Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> design'd him for the Church, pursuant to the common Practice of Persons of Quality, who al∣lot only to God Almighty, what is not fit for the World. The two other Brethren were Count <HI>Luce,</HI> and Chevalier <HI>Luxembourg:</HI> The former being already a Brigadier in the King's Army, and in good repute among the Soldiers, quickly assum'd the Title of Duke of <HI>Chatillon,</HI> upon the Death of the Dutchess of <HI>Mekleburg,</HI> his Aunt, who made him her universal Heir, and, among other things, left him the Dutchy of
<PB N="8" REF="161"/>
<HI>Chatillon,</HI> with the Lands of <HI>Marlau,</HI> which brought in better than forty thousand Livres a Year. The King reviv'd that Dukedom in his Favour; for it had lain extinct by the Death of the Duke of <HI>Chatillon,</HI> his Aunts first Husband. This new Duke Married afterwards <HI>Mademoi∣selle de R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han,</HI> descended of an infamous Branch of the House of <HI>Tremouille;</HI> for the Marquis of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han</HI> her Father, and her Grand-Father, as well as the Abbot of <HI>Tremouille,</HI> her Uncle, were Persons that did not deserve such Illustrious Titles. As for Count <HI>Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nne,</HI> her Father's Elder Brother, 'tis true, he had more Sense than either her Father, or the Abbot, and did not love Drinking as they did: But, after all, he had never been much known in the World, if his Wife had not made up that Defect; for the care she took in spreading his Reputation, was Crown'd with such admirable success, that there were Generals in the Army who were not so much spoken of as he. However he did one thing that met with a general Approbation from the World, namely his separation from her, as soon as he saw her bestow upon others, what was only his due. But having inur'd him∣self to her Customs while they liv'd together, he retain'd a Tincture of 'em after her depar∣ture. He lov'd to see a great deal of Company in his House, as she did in hers; and a great many met there, and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m'd every Night. By th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s means, His Majesty, who always discou∣rag'd Impiety, came to be inform'd, that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt beyond many others in a dexterity of Coin-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Oaths. Upon this, His Majesty sent him word, <HI>That if he continued in that course, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me to repent it ere long.</HI> This Com∣pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent made him wiser than he was before; so that what further Progress he made in his wont∣ed
<PB N="9" REF="162"/>
Course, was done Incognito. 'Twas to be wish'd, that the King's Authority could have reform'd his Brethren as soon as himself. Tho' Swearing was not their Crime, yet one would not have taken them for Persons of Quality, unless he had known them. The Chevalier <HI>de Rohan,</HI> and the Abbot <HI>Tremouille,</HI> lodg'd in a scandalous Tippling-House; tho' the last was worth almost ten Thousand Livers a Year, and the first had enough to Live upon. Upon this account, a Gentleman belonging to the Court, to oblige them to recollect themselves, sent 'em a great Pacquet, Counter-sign'd by a Secretary of State, as if it had come from the Court: 'Twas address'd, <HI>To my Cousins, the Abbot</HI> Tre∣mouille, <HI>and Chevalier</HI> Rohan, <HI>at the six Monks Tavern, in</HI> Paris. 'Twas deliver'd to their Land∣lady, at a time, when they were abroad; and tho' they had not much Sense, yet they under∣stood it to be a ridiculing of their Drunkenness. The name of <HI>Cousin,</HI> in the Subscription, was a Privilege that all their Family formerly en∣joy'd, tho', at present, 'tis confin'd to the Eldest: So that if they were not Dukes and Peers, as they are at present, yet the King would al∣ways Dignifie them with the Title of My <HI>Cousin,</HI> unless His Majesty pleas'd to take that Preroga∣tive from them, as he has sometimes done to other Families.</P>
<P>For instance, the Counts of <HI>Clermont Lodeve,</HI> whose Posterity the Marquis of <HI>Sessack</HI> pretends, at present, to renew: This Family, I say, in former times, were intitled to the same Privi∣lege; and 'tis only of late, that the King de∣priv'd 'em of it, and that upon this occasion; The Elder Brother of that Marquis, being or∣der'd to the <HI>Bastile,</HI> by reason of a Blow he gave to the Bishop of <HI>Londeve,</HI> in <HI>Languedock,</HI> was
<PB N="10" REF="163"/>
in a quanda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y whether he should obey the Or∣der, or not, because he was not styl'd <HI>Cousin</HI> in the Seal'd Letter that was sent him. However, Count <HI>Olonne,</HI> who was worth almost forty Thousand Livers a Year, having no Children, resolv'd to marry Chevalier <HI>Rohan,</HI> his Brother, in hopes that the Off-spring would not resemble the Father. There being few Ladies of Quality, tho' never so Ordinary and Poor, that would accept of him for a Husband; He fix'd upon one of his own Cousins that had nothing, namely, <HI>Mademoiselle Noirmoutier,</HI> Sister to the Dutches∣ses of <HI>Brachiane,</HI> and <HI>Lanti:</HI> She was likewise of the <HI>Tremouille</HI> Family, and the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Noirmoutier,</HI> who had so great a hand in the first <HI>Paris</HI> War. As soon as he open'd the matter to her, she trembled from top to toe, as being acquainted with the Character of her design'd Husband; but his promise of settling his whole Estate upon his Brother, in case the marriage went on, and a great many other things that he represented to her as matter of Comfort, did so tame her, that she presently comply'd. And thus she married the Man in the World, that deserv'd least to be Lov'd; and upon other scores, had so little knowledge of his own Character, that some time after, when some Citizens came to Game at her House, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of 'em, not knowing the Chevalier, and see∣ing him offer her a Seat, bid him give her an∣other, because that one did not please her <HI>Mademoiselle Noirmoutier,</HI> who then enjoy'd the Title of Marchioness of <HI>Rohan,</HI> was oblig'd to put up a great many other Affronts. But, Gaming, which she lov'd to the last degree, made amends for every thing; and the Profit she drew from it, compensated the avarice of Count <HI>Olonne,</HI> who having made her Husband
<PB N="11" REF="164"/>
his Heir, was so sharp set, that he would give him nothing while he Liv'd. Mr. <HI>Harlei,</HI> Son-in-Law to the present Chancellor, lov'd Gaming as passionately as she, and us'd to game in her House, where he made such a Voyage, that a few such more would have ruin'd him. She, and Madam <HI>Theron,</HI> won twenty Thousand Crowns of him, at one bout; and upon such losses, it being natural to offer some Plea or o∣ther for not paying, he did not do as Mr. <HI>Ver∣thamont</HI> did; for instead of paying the Money without any words, in order to stifle the scan∣dal, he gave it out, that he was Cheated. The Chancellor displeas'd with his Conduct, told him, 'Twas a sorry Excuse, and that when the King had catch'd a Man cheating him, he ex∣pell'd him the Court; which was a Lesson for others, that it behov'd him to follow. In fine, he gave him twenty Thousand Crowns to be deliver'd to those that won that summ of him. The Marchioness of <HI>Rohan,</HI> had several such little Jobbs, which help'd her out while she wait∣ed for Count <HI>Olonne</HI>'s Death: At last he Died, as well as her Husband, who left her only one Daughter. Upon this, she resolv'd to breed up her Daughter as a great Heiress, and to enjoy her self. But, as the saying is, Man proposes, and God disposes. Her self was snatch'd away soon after 'em. She was seiz'd with a violent Pain in a very sensible Part; and to appease the unsufferable Pain, and procure her some Rest, she took a Dose of <HI>Opium</HI> that was somewhat stronger than ordinary, immediately after the taking of it, she slept effectualy, but so as never to awake; for next Day she was found Dead in her Bed. 'Twas her Daughter that the Duke of <HI>Chatillon</HI> Married: And tho' she was the Daughter of a Father and Mother that
<PB N="12" REF="165"/>
were not very well spoken of, and withal, not so agreeable as her Sister-in-Law, yet she found out the secret of living more happily with her Husband, than the Dutchess of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> did with hers: For that Duke continued still to visit Madam <HI>Bellefonds,</HI> which inrag'd his Mo∣ther-in-Law so much, that if she had <HI>had</HI> her Will, she had taken her Daughter from him: But, as there are some Rules in the way of Ju∣stice, that one is oblig'd to follow in spite of all that may happen; so it behov'd both she, and her Daughter to be patient.</P>
<P>At the same time, the King gave a Pension of six thousand Live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to Madam <HI>de Cav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is;</HI> and when he bestow'd the Gift, gave her to know, that he was angry with himself for being so late in gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying her; and that she should lose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing by staying so long, for that the Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t he then made her, was but a Pattern of what he design'd to do for the future, both for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Husband. Mr. <HI>de Cavoy</HI> was grand Marshal of the apartments of the King's House, a place that entitled his Predeces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors to the or∣der of the Holy Ghost. But at the last in∣stallment, he had not that Dignity Conferr'd upon him; tho' many others, that had not so much reason to expect it as he, were then invest∣ed with it. The reason was said to be this. He appear'd to be too much interess'd in some things, for which he employ'd the Marquis of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>'s I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terest, being in very good terms with that Minister. For the purpose; the Scene was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id between him and a Merchant, to whom he promis'd, upon a consideration of Ten Thousand Crow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to release a Vessel of his that had been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz'd as a true Prize. And in effect, he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r'd the Restitution from that Minister, upon whom it depended. But as every Man has E∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mies;
<PB N="13" REF="166"/>
so those that had an interest in the Confiscation of the Ship, took occasion to ac∣quaint the King, that Mr. <HI>Cavoy,</HI> in considera∣tion of a private Interest, had caus'd a seizure to be restor'd without a valuable Ransome. Up on this, His Majesty revers'd the Decree that the Counsel had given on the Merchant's behalf: So that his Ship and Cargo was confiscated a∣new, and sold for the King's Benefit. This done, Mr. <HI>de Cavois</HI> was obliged to return the ten Thousand Crowns he had already fingered: And forasmuch as he did not repay it, till he was pressed and urged to it, It came to the King's Ears, for there are always People about Court, that are never a sleep when they have an opportunity of injuring their Neighbour. Be∣sides, a chief reason why they would not for∣give <HI>Cavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> was, That there was a misunder∣standing between the Marquis <HI>de Louv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> and the Creatures of the one, hunted only for opportunities of ruin∣ing the Creatures of the other, presuming that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch a Sacrifice would be very agreeable to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tron. In fine, the Death of the Marquis <HI>de S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> had, in a manner, Buried Mr. <HI>de Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s,</HI> in his Master's Disgrace, when the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eviv'd him by this his bounteous present. He had bought a House at <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vettienne,</HI> a small Village about a Muske<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shot from <HI>Marli.</HI> At this place, his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, a Native of <HI>Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tany,</HI> kept a Dairy, and having made some Butter after the fashion of her own Country, made a Present of it to the King, as an acknowledgement of his late Bounty. His Majesty lik'd the Butter a∣bove all things in the World, insomuch, that he desired her to send him some, not only to <HI>Marli,</HI> but to <HI>Versailles,</HI> when he return'd thither.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="167"/>
In the mean time, the Marquis of <HI>Cascaye,</HI> Am∣bassador from <HI>Portugal,</HI> entertain'd the Publick with a very diverting Scene. He was a very Rich Man, and brought as much Silver Plate to <HI>Paris,</HI> as might have served for twenty Am∣bassador's Tables. He was a passionate lover of Gaming, especially at <HI>Lansquenet,</HI> which was always in vogue, notwithstanding the efforts of a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Lieutenant of the <HI>Police,</HI> to suppress it, who, for that end, went about to several Houses of the City where the Gamesters Assembled. Ma∣dam <HI>le Camus Destouches,</HI> having a House in the Arsenal, and being fearless of that Officer's Visits, kept two days in the week for that Game. The Ambassador went thither, and having lost all his Money, began to play upon tick. An Adventurer that play'd at the same place, and lost his Money as well as the Marquis, being out of Humour, happened to say, <HI>'Twas a strange thing to see Men loose their money every day, and yet play upon Credit.</HI> The Gentleman spoke it with reference to some others that distinguished themselves that way, as well as the Ambassador. But the Ambassador applying it to himself, testified his Displeasure by giving him two Blows upon the spot, with all his force: And to entertain him yet better, order∣ed his Gentleman of the Horse, who always followed him, to give him some Blows with the flat side of his Sword. The Gentleman of the Horse put his Master's Commands in Execution, before the other could put himself in a posture of Defence; so that he was treated at a very handsome rate. Madam <HI>de Frenoi</HI> being present said; <HI>She wonder'd that a Man, especially one of his Character, would give such usage before Ladies, there being several in the Company be sides her self.</HI> This she spoke in a finical way
<PB N="15" REF="168"/>
affecting the air of Quality, and that in such words as might make her pass for such. But the Dutchess <HI>de la Ferte,</HI> having a design upon her, either because <HI>de Frenoi</HI> was handsomer than she, or because she was one of the losers; reply'd, <HI>That it did not become a little Cit, like her, to censure the Actions of a Person of the Marquis of</HI> Cascay<HI>'s Quality.</HI> The Scene being thus changed, they were so intent upon the new Dispute about <HI>Decorum,</HI> that they forgot what had passed; only the poor Man that was banged, kept a heavy clutter, Swearing and blustring, that he would Die by it, or have sa∣tisfaction for the Affront he had received: But whatever was in it, 'tis now almost a Year since the thing happen'd, and I do not find that he has done any thing suitable to his words. As for Madam <HI>de Frenoi,</HI> she was as good a Ton∣gue-pad as the Dutchess, and managed her Point to the advantage. Some days after the Ambassador came again to the Royal Palace, to play at the House of a Lady of another sort of Quality than Madam <HI>Destouches.</HI> The Dutch∣ess of <HI>Ferte</HI> happening to be there, and retain∣ing a resentment of the disagreeable words that Madam <HI>du Frenoi</HI> had uttered upon the account of his Conduct, asked him, if he ordered his Gentleman of the Horse always to follow him; for he was with him then, and, indeed, at all times followed him as close as a shadow does the Body. The Ambassador was about to give her some answer or other; but she interrupted him by setting forth, that there was no body in the Company to beat, so that the Champion would loose his time in staying there: That it was a thing unheard of among Ladies of Qua∣lity, such being in that Company, to converse with a Man that at the last meeting, had treated
<PB N="16" REF="169"/>
their Sex without Respect or Honour; and, that if such things took in <HI>Portugal,</HI> it was not so in <HI>France,</HI> where the Ladies knew bet∣ter things. This last Article the Ambassador would not grant to her. He had taken too much pains to learn of the Court and City La∣dies how to play at Cards, to quit the Profes∣sion so easily. But, as to the first Article, He made Answer, <HI>That since she desired his Gen∣tleman of the Horse should be sent away, it should be done.</HI> The new Quarrel being thus put up, they went to Gaming: In the mean time, the poor Fellow that was Drubb'd, run up and down <HI>Versailles</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> in quest of reparation for the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tront: But his Interest be∣ing insignificant in either, He lost his Labour, and put up the Blows He had received.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Ceaquin</HI> continued still to slight his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady; and Her Relations, under∣standing that He went often to the <HI>Opera,</HI> and had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a she Creature retaining to it, ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> His Majesty an Order, Prohibiting all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Quality, or any others to stand upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: For 'twas there that several In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were first set on Foot, which were af∣terwards improved behind the Scenes, and at last finished elsewhere. This unsow'd a great many little Sparks that went thither only to belch out a thousand smutty and rank Stories among these Women, who did not so much as wrap up the foulest Bawdry in clean Linnen: For they were all so very Lewd, that they did not blush to speak themselves such things, the very hearing of which would, at other times, have covered them with Confusion and Dis∣order.</P>

The Chevalier <HI>de la Hilliere,</HI> Governor of <HI>Ro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Died about this time. He had formerly been a Lieutenant in the Life-Guard. He did not much distinguish himself in his Life-time; and I remem∣ber to have read some where or other, That as he walked one day before the King, the point of his Sword having pierc'd through the Scabbard, gave His Majesty a prick in the Leg; upon which the King told him, <HI>He believ'd his Sword never hurt any body before.</HI> I shall not confirm this piece of detraction, of which His Majesty is less capable than another; for whatever occasion Men of Quality may have given him to com∣plain, he never spoke to any of them in disoblig∣ing Terms. But 'tis certain, that tho' this Knight was not much talk'd of in his Life-time, yet it was otherwise after his Death. He made a <HI>Will</HI> that many wonder'd at; which was much of the same Nature with that made by the Farmer of the Revenues mentioned in the First Part of this Work: Nay, it was rather more valid; for instead of choosing soft smooth Words, to signify that he had cheated the King, he downright own∣ed himself guilty of <HI>Robbery.</HI> He set forth, in plain terms, that he had Robb'd the King of twen∣ty Thousand Livers, while he was Governor of the Place above-mention'd; and order'd his Heirs to make Restitution of the same, before they ap∣propriated to themselves one Farthing of his E∣state. A great many put in for his Government; for there were People enough about Court ready to take the alarm upon any vacancy, who wanted some Subsistence of the King, because they had spent most of what they had in his Service. But Mr. <HI>Bartillac,</HI> Lieurenant General of His Ma∣jesty's Forces, had the best luck. He had serv'd a long time without getting any thing; and the King having gratified all the old Officers, would
<PB N="18" REF="171"/>
not let him be the only One that could say, He was forgot▪</P>
<P>In the mean time, Marshal <HI>Boufflers</HI> represent∣ed to His Majesty, That he was dissatisfied with one of his Lieutenant Generals, not that he was a Coward, and unworthy of his Post, but because he was so Sawcy, that he had all the trouble in the World to make him receive his Orders. The King reply'd, that he ought to discard him, and that would quickly make him easy. This Mar∣shal, who is a younger Brother of the House of <HI>Pic∣cardy,</HI> serv'd first in the Guards in the quality of Aid-Major: After that, his Eldest Brother Marrying Madam <HI>Guenegaut,</HI> the Daughter of Mr. <HI>du Ples∣sis Guenegaut,</HI> Secretary of State, pay'd him down his Portion. Then he bought the Royal Regi∣ment of Dragoons, and began to distinguish him∣self at the head of it in the Battle of St. <HI>Fran∣cis.</HI> Upon this, Mr. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who study'd to serve all the World, spoke so much of him to the King, that His Majesty had a deep impression of his Character. After that; he serv'd, as the rest did, till <HI>Turenne,</HI> his good Friend, Died. Mar∣shal <HI>Crequi,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Turenne,</HI> in the qua∣lity of a General, could not endure <HI>Boufflers</HI> at first, and charg'd him with intermeddling Offici∣ously where he was not desir'd, and very often without knowing well what he said. He drew this check upon himself, by boasting of some in∣telligence he had receiv'd of the Enemy: For the Marshal being a proud Man, did not like such doings, alledging, That they insinuated an accusa∣tion against him, as if he had not taken all the ne∣cessary Measures for having as good intelligence as he. Whatever was in it, Mr. <HI>Boufflers,</HI> by his Pa∣tience, conquer'd the General's Aversion, and they became such good Friends, that General <HI>Crequi</HI> was the first that confirm'd to His Majesty the Character that <HI>Turenne</HI> had given him of <HI>Boufflers.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="172"/>
And that Marshal having, in the latter part of his Life, retriev'd the eclipse he met with, at <HI>Con∣sardick</HI> Bridge; his Confirmation did <HI>Boufflers</HI> no harm; for the King befriended Mr. <HI>Boufflers,</HI> and having made him a Lieutenant General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> rais'd him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣wards to a higher Post. He was already Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> General of the Dragoons; and the late Duke of <HI>Le∣sdiguieres,</HI> lent him Money to buy that Post, per∣haps, more to disoblige the Marquis of <HI>Louvois,</HI> than to oblige Mr. <HI>Boufflers;</HI> for that Minister de∣sign'd the Post for the Chevalier <HI>Tilladet,</HI> his Cousin <HI>German,</HI> tho' all the Army said, he was less worthy of it than the other. Considering his Interest at Court, and Mr. <HI>Boufflers</HI> his incapa∣city to purchase it, he thought he could not miss the procuring of it to <HI>Tilladet,</HI> especially since <HI>Tilladet</HI> had the most considerable Post next to <HI>Boufflers,</HI> in the Regiment. His design in procur∣ing it to <HI>Tilladet,</HI> was to transfer it afterwards to one of his own Sons; for which reason he was not pleas'd with the Duke of <HI>Lesdiguieres,</HI> for lending the Money: And Mr. <HI>Boufflers</HI> was, for sometime, doubtful, whether the Marquis was his Friend, or his Enemy. But at last, that Minister find∣ing that Mr. <HI>Boufflers</HI> had the King's Ear, and that His Majesty look'd upon him as another <HI>Turenne,</HI> not with reference to his capacity which was, far short of that General's; but by reason of his be∣ing dis-interess'd like him, and his inviolable re∣spect for his Person; That Minister, I say, upon these considerations drop'd the spite he had against him, and accordingly did not oppose His Majesty's Bounty to him. He was made Governor of <HI>Lux∣embourg,</HI> after the King took it; and Marshal <HI>Crequi</HI> Dying some time after, His Majesty be∣stow'd upon him the Government of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> which was vacant by the Marshal's Death. After that, the War broke out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he gave him the
<PB N="20" REF="173"/>
Command of an Army; tho' he was then but a Lievtenant General; and order'd <HI>Rubantel,</HI> a Liev∣tenant General, and Lieutenant Collonel of the Regiment of Guards, to receive Orders from him. This disoblig'd <HI>Rubantel</HI> the more, that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een Eldest Captain in the Regiment, when the other was but <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d-Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r;</HI> having succeeded to his Bro∣ther's Company, who was kill'd in the Siege of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nnes.</HI> He would have shewn his Resent∣ment before the Judges; but his Interest was not great there, because he had refus'd to marry Ma∣dam <HI>S. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anges,</HI> who was since married to one <HI>Verne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l,</HI> Judge of the Court of Requests: So that they were not troubled at this his Mor∣tifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation.</P>
<P>He serv'd under this New General with a great deal of discontent; but he quickly met with a great∣er Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont; for Mr. <HI>Boufflers</HI> his Interest at Court gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w so much, that he had not only a blew Rib∣band, but was made a Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> Gover∣nor of the <HI>French Flanders,</HI> and Collonel of the Regiment of Guards. This last piece of Honour conferr'd upon him; disoblig'd <HI>Rubantel</HI> more than any thing else; for being Lieutenant Collonel of that Regiment, he was oblig'd to obey his Orders every Day, whether in Camp, or at Court. Some time after, the King designing a review of that Regiment, <HI>Boufflers</HI> made his review first, in order to remedy all Deficiencies before the King saw them. During this review, Mr. <HI>Rubantel</HI> sate upon Thorns; and as soon as Mr. <HI>Boufflers</HI> gave orders, that the Regiment should file off before him, mounted his Coach, and came to <HI>Paris,</HI> to avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the necessity of saluting him with Pike in hand. The Marshal complain'd of this to the King: And this was the Person that <HI>Boufflers</HI> pointed to, when he told the King (as we intimat∣ed above) that he was dissatisfied with one of his Lieutenant Generals. His Majesty finding it his
<PB N="21" REF="174"/>
Interest to prevent such an occasion of scandal in his Army, in which the measures of Subordinati∣on must always be maintain'd, order'd <HI>Rubantel</HI> to be reprimanded by the <HI>Marquis de Barbesieux,</HI> the Son of the <HI>Marquis de Louvois,</HI> who had Died suddenly, and whose place of Secretary of State he had succeeded to. This did not make <HI>Rubantel</HI> the wiser; for upon several other occa∣sions, he display'd an impatience in being subject to the Marshal; upon which the King was so An∣gry, that he resolv'd to take his Commission from him. His Majesty discover'd part of his mind to the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> who told him, that tho' <HI>Rubantel</HI> was in the wrong, yet, if his Ma∣jesty would be pleas'd to consider the Case, he would find that his Crime, as great as it was, did not deserve so severe a Punishment; that he had been Captain of the Guards Forty Years; and tho' he was bound to give a blind Obedience to whatever Superiour his Majesty plac'd over him, yet considering 'twas natural for a Man not to love to see himself commanded by another that had been long his Inferior, 'twas very possible for him to depart from his Duty. These words soften'd the King's Humour; but his Majesty being oblig'd to put another in his place, by reason of the ill con∣sequences that might ensue upon the failure of an exact Discipline in his Regiments, commanded the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> to order <HI>Rubantel</HI> to resign his Post in Favour of Count <HI>Avejeant,</HI> an old Captain of the Guards, and <HI>Marshal de Camp.</HI> This Count was the Son-in-Law of the late Mr. <HI>Valot,</HI> the King's first Physician; and was at first look'd upon by his Wife's Family, as a person un∣worthy of their Alliance; for she had a great E∣state, and he had scarce any: But the King had a kindness for him, because he was bred up his Page, and chang'd his Religion betimes; and in the progress of time, he, whom they look'd upon
<PB N="22" REF="175"/>
as the most scandalous Member of their Family, such as it was, became, not only the Ornament, but the support of the same. The like happen'd before to the Family of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> which made almost as sorry a Figure as <HI>Vallot</HI>'s. The Eldest Daughter of the Intendant of the <HI>Finances,</HI> a Widdow of a Member of Parliament, being Court∣ted by Mr. <HI>Sanguin,</HI> the Father of the Marquis of <HI>Livri,</HI> first Steward to the King, inveigh'd so bitterly against him, that she was heard say, He was unworthy of being receiv'd into her Fa∣mily. But, after all, she was so wise and hap∣py as to Court him, when she saw him in Fa∣vour: And if she had not engag'd him in her Interest, she had been at a loss upon several oc∣casions.</P>
<P>To return from this Digression: The <HI>Marquis de Barbesieux,</HI> having deliver'd the King's Com∣mands, told <HI>Rubantel</HI> at the same time, <HI>That his Carriage to Marshal</HI> Boufflers <HI>had so displeas'd the King, that he would never have done any thing for him, if the Marshal had not interceded on his behalf; that upon his Intercession, his Majesty be∣stowed upon him the Government of</HI> Baratu-Fort, <HI>with a Pension of four Thousand Livers; and that he behov'd to return thanks to the Marshal upon that score. Rubantel,</HI> considering that a great many of his juniors had some of them Govern∣ments long before, and others more considerable Posts, was so incens'd upon the Compliment, that he immediately return'd the Marquis this An∣swer, <HI>That he would rather choose to receive no Fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours, than to purchase them at that rate; and that so long as he had the honour to serve his Majesty, he thought he had done his Duty, in such a manner, as to deserve some grants, without needing the recom∣mendation of any one.</HI> This said, he went away without staying for any reply; and the Marquis <HI>Barbesieux</HI> having given the King an account of
<PB N="23" REF="176"/>
his Answer; His Majesty said aloud, before all the Court, <HI>That he was not much surpriz'd with his procedure, because he had known him long before to be a Man of that Kidney.</HI> He spoke likewise some other words, which gave <HI>Rubantel</HI>'s Friends a jealousie, that he might come to be commit∣ted. Thereupon the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> being touch'd with Pitty towards this unfortunate Man, whose long Service seem'd to deserve a better Fate: This Duke, I say, presum'd to offer to His Majesty all that he thought was capable to ap∣pease his Wrath. His Majesty reply'd, <HI>That he would consider all his Remonstrances; but that he had suffer'd so many things from him already, that he wonder'd himself was so late in doing what he had then done; that this was not the first time he had given him occasion to be Angry with him, and that he had met with other instances of his inso∣lence, when he did not seem to take notice of it.</HI> These words displaying still a resentment, the consequences of which were to be fear'd: The Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> took the Liberty to make Answer. <HI>That, tho' His Majesty had bore something of ill humour in that Man, yet he would be pleas'd to consider, that he had stood the brunt of many a Musker-Shot in his Service; and for the space of forty Years, the Regiment of Guards was never imploy'd in any Siege, but he appear'd and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard∣ed himself as well as any of the Regiment; That himself had seen him Charge again five or six times, when a great many Men were Kill'd; That he had given equal proof of his Valour, in I do not know how many Battels; and had spent so much of his Blood, that the honourable marks he bore in his Body, deserv'd at His Maiesty's Hands a pardon for some escapes of his Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>This Discourse had the desired effect: The King's Anger relented; but things being then at another pass, than in the Reign of Cardinal <HI>Ma∣zarin,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="177"/>
in which Favours were obtain'd by com∣plaining, or pretending to be formidable, for by such means, two, or three Persons got Marshals Staffs, and others were preser'd to Posts of Ho∣nour: This time (I say) being of a different stamp from that, insomuch, that the greatest Complai∣sance and Submission, were necessary means for having Success; the King did not renew the of∣fer either of <HI>Baratu-</HI>Fort, or the Pension. On the contrary, he bestowed that Governor's place upon Mr. <HI>Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evilliers,</HI> who had been long forgot, and whatever merit he might have, was like to have continued so all his Life, if he had not luckily been the Marquis of <HI>Montchevreuil</HI>'s Sister's Son. With∣out this Circumstance, His Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty had never heard of him; for he had the misfortune to serve in the former War, either in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> or <HI>Messina:</HI> And 'tis a great misfortune for an Officer of any Ambition, to be so far out of his Master's sight. He continued a great while Lieutenant Collo∣nel of Horse. But, at last, his Uncle being load∣ed every day with Royal Favours, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apprehend∣ing, that it would be an unhandsome thing not to make his Nephew share in his good Fortune, in∣treated Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> to represent his Servi∣ces to the King. That Lady perform'd his re∣quest very willingly; and the King told her frank∣ly, <HI>That if she had not spoken to him, he might have continued a long time without knowing that Officer, that being the first time that ever he heard of his Name.</HI> Thereupon His Majesty made him a Brigadier, without staying till he had a Regiment for him. However the first vacancy was his; and that he was scarce possess'd of, when he was made a <HI>Marshal de Camp,</HI> and soon after, a Lieutenant General; so that no Man was ever observ'd to rise so fast. At last, His Majesty Crown'd all his Fa∣vours with a Present of the above mentioned Go∣vernment, and took his Younger Brother into his
<PB N="25" REF="178"/>
Houshould, where he is, at present, an Ensign of the Life-Guards.</P>
<P>Another Officer in the Army was yet more un∣fortunate than <HI>Rubantel;</HI> for after being imprison∣ed in the <HI>Bastile,</HI> and losing his Regiment which was worth better than ten thousand Crowns a Year, he had never obtain'd his liberty if the Peace had not been made: This was a Son of the Duke of <HI>Tirconnel</HI>'s, by a Lady that he had promis'd marriage to, tho he never perform'd his Promise. His Name was <HI>Talbot,</HI> which was like∣wise the Duke's Name, and is a Name very famous both in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> from whence that House deriv'd its Original. He was a Brigadeer in the Army in <HI>Italy,</HI> and had a Regiment there. He came from that Country to Court, about two or three Years ago, at the time when King <HI>James</HI> pretended to Sail for <HI>England,</HI> upon which King <HI>James</HI> bid <HI>Talbot</HI> follow him; but <HI>Talbot</HI> made Answer, <HI>That tho' he had an</HI> Irish <HI>Regiment, yet being in the Service and Pay of his most Christian Majesty, he could not dispose of his Person without His Majesty</HI>'s <HI>leave; and that if he would be so kind as to speak of it to the King, he would be glad to obey his Commands.</HI> I know not whether <HI>Talbot</HI> spoke these words with such an Air as sig∣nifyed his unwillingness to go; or whether that Prince took it ill, that one of his Subjects should say, <HI>He could not obey him without his most Christi∣an Majesty's leave.</HI> But, in fine, Kine <HI>James</HI> disco∣ver'd by his Countenance, that he had forgot, that <HI>Talbot</HI> was the Son of a Man that had done him great Service; and to this Day, is, by all that know him, esteem'd the most faithful and affecti∣onate to his Prince, of any that we have seen for a long time. <HI>Talbot</HI> perceiv'd this as well as the rest: But whether it was that he did not trouble himself about it, or that Wine which he lov'd too well, had sunk his Judgment; He told that
<PB N="26" REF="179"/>
very Day to the <HI>Marquis de Larré,</HI> at a Drinking∣match, what had pass'd between King <HI>James</HI> and him, adding withall, very imprudently, whether through the influence of Wine, or real Thought, <HI>That he could not imagine what that Prince mean'd to do in</HI> England; <HI>and that he was respected or be∣lov'd by very few; every body almost being perswad∣ed that he was a thousand times fitter for a Con∣vent, than for the Throne.</HI> Next Day, the <HI>Mar∣quis de Larré</HI> visited the <HI>Marquis de Barbesieux,</HI> with whom he was in Favour, and gave him an account of what pass'd between him and <HI>Talbot,</HI> thinking, perhaps, rather to do him Service, than to injure him. For the purpose, he might have in his view to inform that Minister of his inviol∣able Affection to the King's Service, upon the comparison with K. <HI>James</HI>'s. But the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux</HI> having told the Story to a Lady that he Courted, and she having told it to the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> This Princess sollicited the King to cause <HI>Talbot</HI> to be taken up. Accordingly he was taken up at <HI>Versailles,</HI> and carried to the <HI>Bastile,</HI> believing that a Prince of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Devotion, would confine his resentment to a few days Im∣prisonment. But as devout People are seldom guilty of granting Pardons, or at least, have no great Name for it; so he was quickly made to understand, that K. <HI>James</HI> had a mind to have him broke. The Dutchess of <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> being a Lady of Honour to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> us'd her endeavours to prevènt the Blow, that was about to reduce that poor Gentleman to the State he was in when he came from his Mother's Belly. For tho' he had serv'd a long time, and had great Incomes, yet he had been so careless a Husband, that he could scarce raise two thousand Crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon all he had. Marshal <HI>de Noailles,</HI> who was his Friend, and under whom he had serv'd in <HI>Ca∣talonia,</HI> sollicited the King to avert the misfortune:
<PB N="27" REF="180"/>
But His Majesty reply'd, <HI>That it did not lie at his door; and that if the King and Queen of</HI> England <HI>did not desire him to be broke, he was satisfied.</HI> But, at the same time, he justly blam'd him for drawing that Disgrace upon himself; and the Marshal could not excuse it otherwise than upon the score of Wine, which often sinks the Reason of the most sensible Men. Mr. <HI>de Vendôme</HI> inter∣ceeded likewise on his behalf: But 'twas all in vain: For K. <HI>James,</HI> and his Queen, made not only his Regiment, but a Pension, that he had, to be taken from him. And thus he had the morti∣fication of seeing himself unplum'd by one stroak of his Tongue of all the Fruit of his Services. And which is yet worse, tho', at present, he is at liberty, I do not know that he has yet obtain'd any thing, tho' I see him every day going from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Versailles,</HI> and from <HI>Versailles</HI> to St. <HI>Germains.</HI> He has been a long time, without obtaining leave of K. <HI>James,</HI> and his Queen, to come and beg their pardon; their Majesties thinking it proper to shew that their Resentment continues still.</P>
<P>Among all this matter of Affliction, especially to <HI>Talbot</HI> and <HI>Rubantel,</HI> as well as their Friends, there happened a new Scene at <HI>Paris,</HI> that may be entertaining to the Publick: The Wife of one that belonged to the Pay-Office, a very Coquette Lady in her way, had one day a mind to ride in her Coach. Her Coach-man having combin'd with some of her Servants to play her a trick, got upon his Coach-box, without dressing his Horses, or cleaning the Coach. The Lady ask'd him what he mean'd by serving a Person of her Quality in that fashion. Her Quality, after all, was not very great; but since Madam <HI>du Fresnoi,</HI> the Wife of a common Citizen's Son, when speaking of her self, took upon her to say, <HI>A Woman of my Qua∣lity;</HI> by the same reason, this good Woman might call herself a Lady of Quality; for both her own,
<PB N="28" REF="181"/>
and her Husband's Father, were something more than the others. However, the Coach-man gave her no Answer, knowing that nothing provokes a Woman more than not answering her, whether she be in the right, or the wrong. She redoubled her repri∣mands to make him speak; and finding that he was still mute, attack'd him with threats and hard words: At last the Coach-man, very unconcernedly, answered her, <HI>That she made a great deal of noise for a small matter; and if she would take his ad∣vice, she should give over bawling, and make no more words of it.</HI> The Lady inrag'd with such an insolent Answer, redoubled her threats and abusive Language: But the Coach-man having kept the best to the last, told her, <HI>That he wondered that such a one as she should be so ill to please, and that she was too well served for a W—</HI>At that word she was out of all Patience, and called up her Foot-men, who had sheer'd off on purpose to have the more Diversion by the Comedy. They ran up to her all in a heat to know her Pleasure. She ask'd them to act for her in being reveng'd upon that insolent Fellow. The Foot-men pretending to know nothing of the matter; she gave them to know, that he had the impudence to call her W—and that the least they could do was to break his Arms, or Legs: But she was mightily surpriz'd, when, instead of being provok'd, as she expected, they looked down. Then she ask'd them what they mean'd by it? and forc'd them to speak as if it had been against their Wills. Their Answer, which was much more provaking than any thing she had yet heard, was, <HI>That if she wanted only to have her Coach-man beaten, she might go see for other Executioners; that they would not beat or thrash any body without a just Cause; and that they did not take speaking of the Truth to be such.</HI> She reply'd, <HI>That it seemed they took her to be a W—as well as the Coach-man did.</HI> And they An∣swer'd,
<PB N="29" REF="182"/>
very freely, <HI>That they knew her to be such, and were ready to witness it when she pleas'd.</HI> This rais'd her Passion to that degree, that she called upon the rest of her Servants to give her the suc∣cour that her Foot-men had refused. The first that appear'd was Mistress Cook, who ask'd her what put her in such a Passion; the Lady had no sooner told her the matter, but she made answer, <HI>That the Coach-man and Foot-men were not much to blame; and that they charg'd her with nothing that was not true.</HI> Then came in the Chamber-maid, who, not being in the Conspiracy with the rest, said, <HI>That 'twas not worth her while to make so many words, and that she would go and call a Commissary to put them all in Prison:</HI> But that word cost her very dear; for as soon as they saw her making ready to go out, they fell upon her, and beat her one after another. The Lady fled to her Chamber for fear they should give her as much: And, at last, the Chamber-maid got clear, and fled likewise to her Chamber. Both of them bolted their doors, and continued there waiting for the Master of the House, in order to complain of the usage they had received. The Coach-man perceiving that his Mistress was mew'd up, took the Horses from the Coach, and curry'd them: And, in a word, did all that was to be done, in order to make it appear upon his Master's return, that his Mistress was in the wrong. But both he, and his accom∣plices, had us'd another precaution, that was yet better. They had complain'd four days a-go to the Commissary of the Ward, that she would not pay them their Wages; and having, at the same time, given a Summons in order to have her cast in Court, they only stay'd in the House till the Husband came; and before his Wife could speak with him, gave him to know, that they would stay no longer with her, because they could not get a Far∣thing out of her hands. The Husband would have
<PB N="30" REF="183"/>
kept them, but they did not care to stay. After they were all gone, he was surpriz'd with an ac∣count of the tricks they had plaid with his Wife. Had he been wise, he would have advis'd her not to speak of the matter to any body, and would have taken the same advice to himself: But as every Man is not as wise as his Affairs require, so he was the fool to go himself and complain of his Servants; and thus was the first that divulg∣ed what he ought to have conceal'd: But the Com∣plaint given in by the Servants four days before, made People believe, that whatever he said, was by way of Recrimination. Upon which, his Friends advis'd him to drop the thing, and make no more noise of it. They had much ado to perswade him; for his Wife threw in all the fire she could to disswade him: But at last, his own Reason con∣vinced him, that <HI>that</HI> was his only way, unless he had a mind to make himself to be pointed at as he walked along the Streets.</P>
<P>As this Lady was branded for a <HI>Coquette</HI> by her Servants; so I present you with a story of an∣other, that, indeed, had not that misfortune, but was no less such in her Husband's Opinion. Mr. <HI>Tourville,</HI> before he was made a Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> married the Daughter of a Farmer Ge∣neral; who was the Widdow of the Marquis of <HI>Poplinicre,</HI> the Nephew of the late Madam <HI>Col∣bert.</HI> 'Twas a lucky hit for the Marshal to mar∣ry that Lady, especially at the time when it hap∣pened; for he was only a younger Brother in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and that of a Family that was in no great Circumstances: But Fortune stood by him, when every body thought he was lost. We must know, that after the Marquis of <HI>Seignelay,</HI> his Pro∣tector, was Dead, he was writ to from Court, that then was the time, or never, to shew his mettle; for he had never given proof of it all the time that he was employ'd as a <HI>Marine.</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="184"/>
This Reproach serv'd for a Spur that twitch∣ed him to the Quick, insomuch, that when he re∣ceiv'd Orders to Fight the Enemies Fleet at any rate, he did his Duty; and tho' he was unfortu∣nate in the way of Success; yet he was there∣upon prefer'd to that degree, that if he had still been unmarried, he could, perhaps, have desired no more of that Woman. But, whether it was that he began to slight her, or that, he thought, he might keep Company with Misses, without giv∣ing her any dissatisfaction; He had a sweet Eye upon one of his Neighbours, that she was as jealous of, as of another. She told him her Sentiments of the thing; and not only took the pains to undeceive him, but made a noise that was very troublesome to the Lady, that she deem'd her for her Rival. I cannot be positive upon the truth of the matter; but 'tis said, that this jealous Lady acquainted the Womans Husband with the Marshal's intimacy with her. 'Tis likewise Re∣ported, that the Husband surprized them in a posture that did not allow him to doubt of the information he had received. Whatever was in it, the Woman was put into a Convent; and the Marshal, either out of the chagrin occasion'd by her confinement, or through the discontent his La∣dy had given him upon other occasions, sent her out of <HI>Paris</HI> to one of his own Territories. His Plea was, that she would not do something that he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desired of her; and the pretence was the more specious, that it related to his Interest. But the Lady bore her Banishment from Town the more impatiently, that she was eternally galled with jealousie, and return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> without giving him notice. She Lodged in his Apartment, de∣signing to lie so close, that he should know nothing of the matter, till her own Friends, and her first Husband's Relations should have acquainted the King with the injustice done her. The Marshal's
<PB N="32" REF="185"/>
Servants seeing her come into his House, gave notice of it to their Master, who, without asking her the reason why she returned without his order, complained of it to the King. At the same time, he desired His Majesty to grant him a Warrant to put her into some Convent, pretending, by that means, to enjoy all her Estate: But His Majesty being informed of several things, would not be so hasty, and desired, in the first place, to know the occasion of their Divorce. The Mareshal in∣deavour'd, by all means, to cover and perplex the Story, and turned it upon the score of Interest; but the King made Answer, <HI>That Commissioners ought to be appointed to inspect which of them was in the wrong.</HI> This was all that his Lady desir∣ed; and thus she continued at <HI>Paris</HI> in spight of him, and made it her business to thwart all his Intrigues.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his Misses Sister came to be married; and that being a favourable opportunity of reconciling her to her Husband, the poor re∣cluse's Friends invited her to be present at the marriage. He was a little restive upon the point: However, being uneasy in Living alone, and want∣ing only to be urged to it, he pretended, that in marrying her, he had not received the same ad∣vantages as they gave to his Sister-in-Law. If they pleas'd, they might have given him the same answer as the Marshal <HI>Feuillade</HI> gave one day to the Brother of Mr. <HI>Courchamp,</HI> Master of Requests, who is, at present, Master of the King's Houshold, and Collonel of a Regiment of Foot. He had a mind to be an Ensign in the Guards, and that Mar∣shal offering to sell him a Commission at double the worth, he represented to him, that it was not worth so much; upon which the Marshal re∣plied, That he owned it was true; but, withall, that he ought to know, that <HI>that</HI> sort of Posts were sold according to the merit of those that pre∣tended
<PB N="33" REF="186"/>
to buy 'em; That there was one price for a Man of Quality, and another for such as he, and in effect, That neither his Physiognomy, nor his Air, would bring any honour to the Re∣giment. I do not insist upon the Consideration of his Birth; for that Regiment has been fill'd, I do not know how long, with Men of the same Degree; and I think the Marshal had no reason to inflame the price of the Commission, because he was only a Tradesman's Son. But let that be as it will (as I said before) the Recluse's Rela∣tion might have alledg'd the same Reasons to her Husband: Nay, they had a better Title so to do; for 'tis natural to give with a Girl in Marriage, in proportion to the Circumstances of him that Marries her. In fine, he stood out boldly, not∣withstanding that he had a mind to take his Wife home again. He was not present at the Mar∣riage, which was accompanied with a sad Scene; for the Bride's Mother, that was well but four Days before, Died the same day, that the Nup∣tial Benediction was pronounced. The Bride∣groom, who did not marry any great Beauty, was not much troubled at that Circumstance, because he had no great prospect of Pleasure in her Com∣pany. His Bride's Face promising but little satis∣faction, he willingly abstain'd from the Duties of a Husband, upon the plea of the loss of her Mother. But he could not handsomely put it off longer than the second Night, at which time he was oblig'd to break the Ice: And this comforted the new married Lady, upon the loss of the first Night, especially considering, that she fear'd her Deformity would have eternis'd her Affliction.</P>
<P>Another Lady was Married at the same time, that would have taken it very ill, if her Husband had thus amus'd himself with crying and lamentation on the Wedding-Night. 'Twas Madam <HI>Girardin,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="187"/>
the Widow of Mr. <HI>Girardin,</HI> who was first a Lieu∣tenant of a Province, and after that, was sent Am∣bassador to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> He had play'd his Game to good purpose; for upon the Division of his Estate, his Widow had above a hundred thou∣sand Crowns for her share, besides a great quan∣tity of Moveables, that was worth half as much. She had likewise a good Marriage of it, upon other scores, which made her bear a good Figure, inso∣much, that many Persons about Court had her in their Eye: But she lik'd the Marquis of <HI>Canillac</HI> better than any other of her Suitors, tho' he had nothing but his Sword to trust to. This Lady had two Brethren, one of them President to the Parliament, and the other Master of Requests, and Intendant of a Province. Fearing they would oppose her Marriage, if she discovered her Design, she resolv'd to be Married without giving them any notice. For they were both Lawyers, and forasmuch as that sort of Men are very sharp Sighted where they have any Interest, she would not be oblig'd either to have recourse to the King to stifle their Opposition, or to secure herself at Law. Thus was the matter concluded without their knowledge; and it happened, that on the Wedding-Day, the Intendant having arriv'd at <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> but twenty four Hours before, sent her word by his Foot-man, That he would come and Dine with her. The Foot-man coming to the Gate, was surpriz'd to find a Porter and Foot-men, with Live∣ries different from his; and being introduc'd by one of these Foot-men into my Ladies Chamber, he found her a Bed with a Man: However, not knowing what the matter mean'd, and not daring to ask any of her Servants, he only deliver'd his Master's Compliment. The Lady made answer, That truly she had other things to mind, than the giving his Master a Dinner; and that she doubted if she could be stirring, when he should come to
<PB N="35" REF="188"/>
Dinner. With the same Breath, she bid him give her Brother to know, that she only put off the Com∣plment to another time; and that then she would acquaint him with the Reason, why she would not give him a meeting that day. The Air with which she spoke these words, gave the Foot-man to un∣derstand, that she lik'd the Trade she had lately taken up. When he return'd, and gave his Master an account of all he saw or heard, the Intendant went immediately to impart the good News to the President. The President having known by Experience, what small stress ought to be laid on a Woman's Prudence, took the matter at first to be Criminal. He thought his Sister had en∣tertain'd a Gallant, and told his Brother, that he would ruine h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and that they should think of expedients to prevent it. The Intendant having a better Opinion of the Women, than his Brother, reply'd, That he was too forward, and that they ought not to Condemn their Sister upon such slight grounds; and that he believ'd she was Mar∣ried, because his Foot-man said, her Servants had changed their Livery. The President, who upon the hopes of having a share in her Succession, had shewn his Displeasure upon the apprehension of her entertaining a Gallant; was yet more disgust∣ed when he heard of a Husband: And forasmuch as all his remaining Comfort consisted in disanul∣ling the Marriage, in case she had Married a Fortune-Hunter, He sent one of his Foot-men to her Gate, to know what Name she went by. But when his Foot-man return'd, and acquainted him, that her Name was <HI>Canillac,</HI> and that her Hus∣band was an Officer in the second Company of Musqueteers; he then was sensible, that he had nothing to hope for upon that score.</P>
<P>About the same time, Mr. <HI>Bignon de Blansi,</HI> Master of Requests, the Nephew of Mr <HI>Pontchar∣train,</HI> was likewise married to Madam <HI>He∣bert</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="189"/>
<HI>Debuc,</HI> the Niece of Madam <HI>Pompone,</HI> and the Daughter of Mr. <HI>Hebert Debuc,</HI> Master of Requests. Mr. <HI>Blansi</HI> was Brother to the Inten∣dant of <HI>Piccardy.</HI> His first Lady was Mademoi∣selle <HI>Brunet,</HI> who died in Child-bed when she was but twenty two Years of Age, and left him no Issue. Some days after his second marriage, Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> procur'd him a Commission for being a Master of Requests, that might be worth two thousand Livres a Year. He had another Com∣mission before that brought him no Profit. Tho' after all, those who have such sort of Places, continue still to desire them, because they are not only Posts of Honour, but make way for others that are more profitable. Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> who commonly has the disposal of that sort of things, design'd this Post for Mr. <HI>Harouis,</HI> Son-in-Law to Mr. <HI>Richebourg,</HI> Madam <HI>Pontchartrain</HI>'s Uncle, who, besides the Honour of being her Kinsman, was thereby qualified, not only for this, but for a more considerable Commission. Accordingly he order'd Mr. <HI>Depinet,</HI> one of his Deputies that looks after such things, to make ready an Act, and carry it to the Chancellor. But this Magi∣strate having a grudge against <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> in∣stead of filling up the blank with <HI>Mr. Harouis</HI> his Name, according to <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain</HI>'s de∣sire signfy'd to him by his Deputy, ask'd him how long a Controller General had offer'd to give Laws to a Chancellor, and at the same time, gave him to know, that he understood his own Business without being taught it, and fill'd up the Blank with the Name of <HI>Arnothon,</HI> Master of Requests. <HI>Depinot</HI> returning to <HI>Mr. Pontchar∣train,</HI> gave him an account of the Chancellor's Compliment. <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain</HI> was unwilling to make any noise, tho' perhaps he had Reason enough, only after that he did nothing relating to his Office, without speaking first to the King; so that it
<PB N="37" REF="190"/>
was not in the Chancellor's Power to thwart him.</P>
<P>Much about the same time, there happen'd an∣other marriage, which I would be loath to insert here, if it had not given occasion to one word that was taken notice of. Mr. <HI>de la Ferrier,</HI> the Son of that <HI>Berrier,</HI> whose memory is still odious to all the World, tho' he has been a long time Dead: This Man married his Daughter to the Son of <HI>Des Chiens,</HI> whose Birth and Places bore a near re∣semblance to his Father, and all that he did. For tho' he had the Impudence to say, that he was descended of a Noble Family, yet all the Country bears witness, that his Father, and his Ancestors, deriv'd their Extraction from the scum of the People. However, Mr. <HI>de la Ferrier</HI>'s Lady be∣ing Grand-Child to the late Mr. <HI>Novion,</HI> first President, his Alliance with that Family, of which his Lady descended by the Mother-side, was so monstrous, that all the World cried out, that the Blood of the <HI>Novions</HI> was disgrac'd, since, whereas it was formerly mingled with that of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> in the Person of the late Count <HI>de Tremes,</HI> Father to the present Duke <HI>de Gevres,</HI> it was now bestow'd upon <HI>Chiens (Dogs.)</HI> But the matter lay here; these <HI>Chiens</HI> were furnish'd with Golden Teeth; and the Father had got so consi∣derably by the Places he had in this War, that the <HI>Novions</HI> were nothing near so considerable as he. This Mr. <HI>de la Ferriere,</HI> was not reckon'd a Beast, either in Council, or in his own Domestick Af∣fairs, tho' there was a time, when he pass'd for a Bankrupt; and upon that false Report, 'twas said, That the King would take all his Places from him, for fear his Poverty should tempt him to be unjust in the discharge of his Offices. But if we may credit what happen'd soon after the mar∣riage of his Daughter, to whom he gave nothing; all this pretended Poverty was only a faint, to
<PB N="38" REF="191"/>
impose upon the Publick; for his Brothers, with whom he was at law for their Portions, present∣ed a Request to the Judges, setting forth, That their Father had left an Estate of two millions of money, which he was actually possess'd of; and that their Eldest Brother kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it up, without doing them Justice. This Petition made his Creditors very uneasy. They alledg'd, That since his own Brethren had thus inform'd against him, the Council before which they pleaded, and which he endeavour'd to move to Compassion, by his pretended Poverty, ought not to have any re∣gard to his Allegations, for depriving them of their Right. In former times, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> made use of much such another Argument to ruine Mr. <HI>Fouquet;</HI> for Abbot <HI>Fouquet</HI> his Brother revil'd him horridly; and whenever any-body offer'd to plead for him, the Cardinal made Answer, That they did not know Mr. <HI>Fouquet</HI> so well as his Brother; and that by consequence, his Testimony was preferable to theirs. And, in effect, the Ab∣bot, who was an odd sort of a Man, being at once the greatest <HI>Braggadochio,</HI> and the greatest Coward in the World: This Abbot, I say, had a great hand in ruining the Super-Intendant. He presented Memorials against him; and 'tis well known what weight they were of, when the question was put, Whether he should be Arrested or not. This Abbot was such a Vaunting Fel∣low, that he pretended he would take the Prince, and the Marshal of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quincourt,</HI> by the Beard, to make them repent of their taking up Arms a∣gainst the King. But on the same very day, that <HI>Barbesieres</HI> came from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders,</HI> on purpose to car∣ry off the Father of Mr. <HI>Girardin</HI> mention'd above, who was a famous <HI>Partisan,</HI> some-body came and told the Abbot, that the Prince had sent out a Party to take him up, having heard the Stories he had spoke of him; and thus put him in such
<PB N="39" REF="192"/>
a Fear, that he durst not venture to go out of <HI>Paris,</HI> without a strong Guard.</P>
<P>Soon after all these Marriages, a Sentence of Banishment was granted against Medemoiselle <HI>de Varennes,</HI> a Lady of Quality, in the Country of <HI>Maine,</HI> who was more known by the Affection that great Prelate had for her, than by the Reputation of her Ancestors. 'Twas said, that this Affecti∣on was the effect of Amorous Embraces; and that her Friend before his Death, advised her to marry some Person of Quality, that had no∣thing, upon Condition, that he should own her Children to be his. He had made her so rich by his Bounty, that he thought she was in a Condi∣tion to tempt every body. 'Tis true, there were a great many poor Wretches, that would have been glad of such an adventure. But 'twas not that sort of Men, that she had a mind to: Not∣withstanding the scandalous terms, she pretended still to have her choice, and receiv'd Visits from all the Court, in a House of hers, that resembled an inchanted Palace. To carry on the Wheedle the better, she entertain'd them very handsomly, and in <HI>Lent</HI> regal'd them with Meat, notwithstand∣ing the King's Orders to the contrary. For His Majesty, to put a stop to all manner of Libertinism, had order'd, that only those, who were sickly, or otherwise incommoded, should have liberty to eat Meat with the Church's Permission; and that they should not let any body share with them, under the pain of incurring his Displeasure. But, tho' Madam <HI>Varennes</HI> was far from that Condition, being in very good Health, yet she not only eat of it herself, but invited all her Visiters to eat with her. The King got notice of this, and sent her a Letter under the great Seal, to be gone. Her Friends promis'd her a Grant of some time be∣fore she went into Exile: But instead of mak∣ing preparations for her Departure, she promis'd a
<PB N="40" REF="193"/>
thousand Pistols to Count <HI>Gramont</HI> for procuring a Revocation of the Sentence. Count <HI>Gramont</HI> being a Person that subsists only by the King's Bounty, and at such Wind-falls does not use to be asleep: This Count, I say, did not pretend to deny the thing to the King, that being the wrong way to compass his Design; but represented to His Majesty, That the Lady being set all-alone at Ta∣ble, where she fed upon Mear, pursuant to a per∣mission she had from the Curate, some people came in and surpriz'd her, and, in spite of her Teeth, sat down with her; that this was no in∣fraction upon the design of His Majesty's Or∣der, and that all the World might be catched in the same Trap, as well as she, without they kept their Gates shut at Meal-times, as in a Convent. In fine, he pleaded her Cause with such dexterity, that the King granted his Request, upon a pro∣mise, that the Lady would be more cautious for the future. Then the Marquis of <HI>Vieuxburg</HI> be∣gan to declare himself a Sui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to the fair Lady, tho' he could not well do it without a breach of Faith to Mademoiselle <HI>de Bulli,</HI> a Lady of Qua∣lity, near <HI>Neuchatel</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> to whom he had given a Promise of Marriage. He was the Son of the Chancellor's Lady; and having lost his Eldest Brother at the Siege of <HI>Namur,</HI> car∣ried on by the Enemies, succeeded to his Estate, which was not inconsiderable. The good Name he had in that Province, together with this Suc∣cession, and a little Honour, if he had <HI>had</HI> any, ought to have deterr'd him from so scandalous an Alliance: But this Lady having inchanted him, he open'd his mind to her; and by the discovery of his Design, pleas'd her so well, that she offer'd to give him all she had, provided he Married her. In effect, the business was kept private for some time; and in the mean time, the Chancellor's La∣dy happening to die, both of them were sensible
<PB N="41" REF="194"/>
that it was a favourable accident for them, in re∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd she would never have suffered her Son to be guilty of that Folly, in her Life-time. The Chan∣cellor, who had been kept ignorant of his Lady's illness for some days, and hinder'd from going to her Chamber, under the pretence of some preju∣dice that might thereby accrue to either of their Healths: This Magistrate, I say, gave his Lady a magnificent Funeral. In the mean time, he went and spent some days with the President <HI>Fourci,</HI> and after that return'd to his own House, and recom∣menc'd the exercise of his Office, which has this privilege beyond all others, That those who are invested with it, never wear mourning, either for their Relations, or for the King himself. Mon∣sieur, and Mr. <HI>de Chartres,</HI> gave him a Visit to Solace him upon his Loss. The next day the Pope's Nuncio came to his House, and every body thought he had come upon the same Errand. But tho' the measures of Civility requir'd that Com∣pliment, especially since he came to the Chancel∣lor's own House; yet he made him another, that quickly discover'd the chief reason of his coming. However, it was not disagreeable; for after having assur'd him of the Pope's Respect for him, and his Family, He presented to him a Brief from His Holiness, permitting the second Son of Ma∣dam <HI>Harlai,</HI> his Daughter, to possess all sorts of Abbeys, even those mortgag'd to Regulars, tho' he was then but nine Years of Age. The reason that mov'd the Pope to this Dispensation, was set forth in the Brief. It imported, that his Holi∣ness was infinitely glad to hear that Mr. <HI>Harlai</HI> was gone from <HI>France,</HI> upon a design of making a ge∣neral Peace; and that His Holiness thought him∣self oblig'd to testify this his Joy, by granting that favour to his Son. But after all, the Holy Father had not taken up this desire of giving Peace to Christendom, till the King was expell'd <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="195"/>
by the <HI>Savoy-</HI>Treaty, under the pretence, that <HI>Ita∣ly</HI> would always be fetter'd, so long as His Ma∣jesty was possess'd of any thing on that side. Thus Popes, Kings, and great Folks, talk as they will; tho' at the same time they are glad to insinuate to others, that they design nothing but what will redound to the advantage of those who are subject to them.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Marsan,</HI> the Youngest Brother of all the Princes of the House of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who married the Marchioness of <HI>Siegnelay,</HI> after the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> broke off from her, got at that time a Pension of Twenty thousand Livers. This was matter of surprisal to every-body, not only by rea∣son of the small Service he had ever done to the State, but because he had always a sorry Interest at Court. For the purpose. When he married the Marchioness of <HI>Albret,</HI> Widow to the Mar∣quis of <HI>Albret, Marshal de Camp,</HI> who was kill'd when he went to see his Mistress; at that time, the King turn'd that Lady out of the Queen's Retinue; not that she had done any thing de∣serving that disgrace; but only, because she had married a Man that the King did not like. The reason of the King's dislike, was grounded on his having some intrigue with a Young Prince, that His Majesty took care of, and his being charg'd with cajoling and wheedling a Young Princess, that he was equally concern'd for. But after all, he found ways and means to attone for all that; and upon that score was oblig'd to his Lady, who has Friends of Interest and Credit. At present, he enjoys above fifty thousand Crowns a Year, tho' before his first marriage, he was not worth a Groat; and just now he has bought one of the finest Houses in <HI>Paris.</HI> He had it from President <HI>Tam∣bonneau;</HI> and that Magistrate bore some hard words from the first President, upon the account of some Difficulties relating to the execution of the
<PB N="43" REF="196"/>
Bargain. That House had formerly a large Gar∣den to it, part of which Mr. <HI>Tombonneau</HI> cut off, and joyn'd it to another House of his; and Count <HI>Marsan</HI> alledg'd, That tho' that part was cut off by a particular clause, Calculated for that pur∣pose; yet at that time, it ought to be undone, because it return'd naturally to the purchase to which it had always belong'd. They agreed to leave the matter to the Arbitration of the first Pre∣sident. But whether this Magistrate was partial, or thought it was justice to give it against <HI>Tom∣banneau,</HI> He deliver'd his mind in such harsh terms, as insinuated, that he had over-reach'd Count <HI>Marsan.</HI> 'Twas some time before Mr. <HI>Tam∣bonneau</HI> would agree to his Verdict; but at last the matter was accommodated; and at this day, Count <HI>Marsan</HI> lives in that fine House. Mr. <HI>Pont∣chartrain</HI> had a mind for the House; but being a Man of a different stamp from some Ministers, who do not grudge to give any price for what they like, he could not come up to Mr. <HI>Tomban∣neau</HI>'s price. To be plain, when a Man throws away his money at such a rate, 'tis a sign he comes easily by it; whereas good Husbandry speaks a fair purchase.</P>
<P>The Princess of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> whose Husband is of the same Family with Count <HI>Marsan,</HI> but not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear so Rich, lost at that time, a Law-Suit with Madam <HI>Nemours,</HI> which she thought she had been sure of. 'Twas laid before the Council, and related to the Register of <HI>Lions,</HI> which she justly alledg'd to have been the property of her Grand-Fa∣ther, by the Mother's-side. This her Grand-Father was the famous Farmer of the Revenue, call'd <HI>Garnier,</HI> who, tho' he was Born to very little, had got such a vast Estate, that he might have boasted of greater matters than <HI>Sebastian Zamer</HI> did in former times; for whereas this Man en∣titled himself, a Master of five hundred thousand
<PB N="44" REF="197"/>
Crowns, the other might have pretended to six∣teen millions. He was effectually possess'd of eight millions clear of the best money in the World, and the King owed him as much. But soon after Mr. <HI>Fouquet</HI> was catch'd, the Court of Justice came upon him, and there he was Taxed in proportion to what he had got, so that his whole Fortune was melted in a moment. By good luck he had married a whole Regiment of Daughters very handsomely; and having pay'd their Portions in ready money, Mr. <HI>Colbert,</HI> who rak'd into the very Branches of Families, could find no plea to suck out the Blood, that they en∣deavour'd to maintain their Honour with. The Princess of <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Mother, who was married to Count <HI>Brancas,</HI> Gentleman of Honour to the Queen's Mother, had thus escaped that Minister's scrutiny, because all her Portion was money paid down. However, her Daughter was of the same Humour with her Grand-Father, so that it was not long of her, if she was not Rich. She lost the above-mentioned Suit only by one Vote, which she thought ought to have lest oppos'd her. Hav∣ing always been very careful in making interest with the Ministers, she hop'd that Mr. <HI>Pontchar∣train,</HI> who was one of the Judges, would favour her; But equity prevailing with honest Men, be∣yond all other Considerations, he was one of those that cast her. Tho' after all, when he was ask'd wherein Madam <HI>Nemours</HI>'s Cause had the advantage of hers, He reply'd, That he could not well tell; and that if he had thought the rest would have been of his mind, he would have manag'd that Cause like the Oyster in <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Satyrs, in giving the two Shells to the two Prin∣cesses, and the fleshy part to the King, because the property contested by them, belong'd in effect only to His Majesty. The Princess of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who will never lose any thing for want of a vi∣gorous
<PB N="45" REF="198"/>
defence, does not yet give her Cause over for lost; and having sometimes been lucky in Law-Suits, she hopes to have the same good For∣tune in this. But since her Fortune has been out of her Hands these twelve or fifteen Years, 'tis not probable that 'twill ever return to her. She made a shift, by the interest of one of her Friends, to perswade <HI>Mademoiselle de Guise,</HI> to give her Husband the Dukedom of <HI>Guise,</HI> and <HI>Guise-house,</HI> which were worth at least three millions. The procuring of this favour had cost the Prince of <HI>Harcourt</HI> some Compliments and Addresses to his Benefactress: But his Humour being not so pliable as his Lady's, he re-assum'd his Character, when he thought the business was done. Madam <HI>Guise</HI> complain'd of this to the Friend that had acted the part of a Mediator; and he being not able to perswade the Prince to continue his Visits, she resum'd her Gift. This Thunder-struck his Lady, who upon this Affair had display'd her ut∣most prouess. However, she is to be commended for managing so wisely the Affairs of her Family, which her Husband neglects. He minds nothing but his Diversion, while she scrapes up money to pay a Pension, that she's oblig'd to give him upon the consideration of his having turn'd over all his Estate to her. But the Times we live in being so unhappy, that little can be made of a Land-E∣state, she would find it very hard to do what she does, if she did not find ways of getting of some∣thing from time to time. She neglects no oppor∣tunity, small or great, it never scapes her, provided she has any prospect of success.</P>
<P>About that time, the Court was very hot upon the execution of a project, that had been propos∣ed by several Persons a long time before; I mean that of taking <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where the Banks of several Nations were lodg'd, as well as part of the Riches of <HI>Perou.</HI> In the beginning of the
<PB N="46" REF="199"/>
War, a <HI>Rochel-</HI>Man, call'd <HI>Petit,</HI> was taken up, who had gone to <HI>Holland,</HI> and there abjur'd his Religion, upon the perswasion of his Wife; and after her Death had return'd to <HI>France.</HI> He was well vers'd in Sea-Affairs; and having been im∣ploy'd by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> orders were given to take him Dead or Alive. Mr. <HI>Vilette,</HI> a Lieutenant-General at Sea, was imploy'd to execute the Or∣ders; and, indeed, he once made up so close to him, that he thought to have given a good account of him: But <HI>Petit</HI> being on Board of a better Sai∣ler, than any of the Lieutenant-General's Ships, he luckily got off; tho some time after, he de∣liver'd himself into the Hands of the Governor of <HI>Vallenciennes,</HI> who gave notice of the same to the Court. In regard, he return'd with a re∣solution to re-assume his wonted Religion and O∣bedience, and had spoke so to some People, who had acquainted the Ministers with it; they could not handsomely indite him, but contented them∣selves with securing his Person in the <HI>Bastille;</HI> that being thought necessary, for that after such an escape as his, 'twas to be feared he might do the like again, if ever he fell into the Hands of such a Woman as his first Wife was. His Im∣prisonment was a great surprizal to him: How∣ever, having time enough in Prison to think of his Concerns, he bethought himself, that he would never be set at Liberty, unless he attoned for his Crime, by some great piece of Service. Having considered again and again of the mat∣ter, and being well acquainted with the Coast where <HI>Carthagena</HI> lies; he lit upon the same Thought as others had before him. He was of Opinion, That 'twas not impossible for the King to make himself Master of that place, and even of—which is yet Richer, and, as it were, the Magazine of all the Riches of <HI>Perou.</HI> Having hatch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d this Thought, his next business was to
<PB N="47" REF="200"/>
give it vent; for which end, he asked to speak with Mr. <HI>Besmaux,</HI> Governor of the <HI>Bastille.</HI> But whether the Governor thought the Man was troubled with maggoty Fancies, or whether he had no mind to be himself an instrument of losing his Prisoners, by whose maintenance he got a great deal, and for that reason called them his Pigeons; Whatever was in it, he would not al∣low him Paper to express his Thoughts upon, but only promised to speak of his Project to a Mini∣nister of State. Tho' after all, 'tis very likely he did not that; for 'tis plain, that, if he had, Mr. <HI>Pontchartain,</HI> who had the management of Marine. Affairs, was too good a Servant of the King's, to neglect such a proposal as that. The Prisoner re∣ceiving no Answer, notwithstanding the Gover∣nor's Promise to bring him one; cut off the Mar∣gins of a Book that he had, and having made some Ink of Soot or Charcoal, wrote down his Project, together with several other things, that then came into his Head. He had not well finish∣ed his Scheme, when Marshal <HI>Tourville</HI> came to the <HI>Bastille</HI> to try some Cannon of a new inven∣tion. The Cannon were fired into the Ditch, which the Prisoner observing through the Grates of the Chamber, threw out his Paquet well wrap∣ed up. It fell at the Marshal's Feet, who have∣ing time to read the Superscription, <HI>viz. To Mar∣shal</HI> Tourville, <HI>upon Affairs of great consequence relating to the Sea. This Pacquet to be delivered to Mr.</HI> Pontchartrain. Having read, I say, this Superscription, he refufed to deliver it to Mr. <HI>Besmaux,</HI> who ask'd it of him. The Governor indeavour'd to perswade him to it; by setting forth, That a Minister whose time was so preci∣ous, ought not to be disturb'd with idle Whims; that probably there was nothing in the Pacquet, but such Vapours as the damps of a Prison are apt to excite; and that for his part, he was teaz'd
<PB N="48" REF="201"/>
every day with such things, but that he never minded them. Mr. <HI>Tourville</HI> looking up to the Window where the Pacquet fell, ask'd him, who was in that Chamber? Mr. <HI>Besmaux</HI> made An∣swer, That 'twas a <HI>Rochel</HI> Renegado, without tel∣ling his Name: But the Marshal knowing that <HI>Petit</HI> was Prisoner in the Castle, and taking that to be his Apartment, told the Governor, that since the Pacquet came from so good a place, he was ob∣liged to give it to Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain.</HI> Accordingly he gave it to him; and that Minister having pe∣rus'd it, found some things in it better explain'd than in the other Memorials that had formerly been given in upon that Subject. Then he let the matter sleep for a while, in order to digest things more maturely; and at last spoke of it in private to some Sea-Officers, that he thought ca∣pable to resolve some Doubts he had upon that Head. Some of them represented it as impos∣sible; and others as a very dangerous enterprize; only Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> spoke of it as an easy thing, be∣cause he wanted to be imploy'd in the Expedition. One must be prepossess'd with an expectation of success in any Enterprize, in order to go through with it. Accordingly, in several Conferences be∣tween that Minister, and <HI>Pointis,</HI> the latter ap∣pear'd still more and more forward, and remov∣ed several Difficulties, that the other look'd up∣on as very considerable: So great an itch had <HI>Pointis</HI> to signalize himself in that Expedition. But <HI>Glory</HI> was not the only motive in his view; he had another that weigh'd as much with him, tho' it was not altogether so Honourable. He was in Love with President <HI>Ferrand's</HI> Daughter, and neither of them having any Estate, in the ardour of his Passion to enjoy her, he thought no Wall whatsoever would stand before him. Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> perceiving that he was the Man he wanted, and that he could never find another
<PB N="49" REF="202"/>
that would carry on the Enterprize with so much heat: Upon this consideration, I say, he gave him a Promise of being imploy'd upon that Design. <HI>Pointis</HI> recounted the Affair to his Mi∣stress, and among many other sweet words told her, That she should have the Triumph of that Place; that for his part, all his Ambition was, to lay at her Feet, all the Riches that the Expedition should afford; and that he accounted himself but too happy, if by that means he could procure her favour. While he was thus taken up in Court∣ship, Mr. <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> went effectually about the business. There being a necessity of an infinite sum of money, to answer the Charge that His M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty was at upon other accounts: He had a mind that this Expedition should cost the King nothing. With this view, by the King's permis∣sion, he erected a Company, which advanc'd the money for carrying on the Expedition, upon Con∣dition of receiving the Profits that should accrue by it; some put in a thousand Pistols, some more, some less; the Fleet was got ready, and Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> put to Sea, when no body knew where he was going. The <HI>English</HI> thought he had a de∣sign upon their Possessions in <HI>Carolina,</HI> and gave the necessary Orders to prevent it. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were apprehensive of a design upon them. How∣ever, Mr. <HI>Pontis</HI> fell in upon <HI>Carthagena,</HI> all on a sudden, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> least expected it, and Landed there some Soldiers that he had brought with him. At the same time, the Governor of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> being acquainted with the Design, brought some Buckaneers to assist at the Siege. <HI>Pointis</HI> stood much in need of them, and without them he had never compass'd his end. But they were so dissatisfied upon the small share they had of the Booty, that they first complain'd to him, and then threaten'd openly to send some body to Court, to demand justice of him. He laugh'd, both at
<PB N="50" REF="203"/>
their Complaints and Threats, fancying, that his success would procure him a hearing to their pre∣judice. There was an immense quantity of Riches in that City, both in Bars of Silver, Gold-dust, and pretious Stones: And he did not neglect his own Coffers, no more than some Captains of Ships, whose Avarice was more notorious than his own: For on Board of one of them, there was found Effects, to the value of eighty thousand Crowns; he having converted the money into Goods, which he was afterwards oblig'd to convert into money again. Others were likewise convicted of having endeavour'd to enrich themselves upon the Com∣pany's Charges, while it was only suspected. But since Malice and Calumny is very forward, e∣specially upon such things, for which every Man is believed to have a good Appetite; 'twould not be just to be positive in the Accusation. In that City, there was a Young Man, who was the Son of the Governor of <HI>Lima;</HI> and, by his Folly, had a mind to furnish those who vented Romances, with Truths instead of their ordinary Fables. He was seiz'd with a Passion of Love for the Prin∣cess of <HI>Conti,</HI> the King's Daughter, upon seeing her Picture, which fell accidentally into his Hands, by an Engagement with the <HI>Buccaneers:</HI> He found it in the Arms of one that was Kill'd, and presently took it into his own, as being a Trea∣sure that he esteem'd more than the Pearls and Diamonds he had found among the Spoil. Ne∣ver were such Follies committed, as that young Fool was guilty of, after the sight of that Pi∣cture; every day he kissed it a thousand times, and he never ingaged, without invoking it before hand, as the only Deity that could assist him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Fortune he had, he imputed it all to it, which enlarged his esteem of it more and more. But at last being over-power'd in an En∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gement with a King, in the Neighbourhood of
<PB N="51" REF="204"/>
his Father's Government; the King, as barbarous as he was, lov'd the Picture as passionately as he, As soon as he cast his Eyes upon it, he ask'd. What Picture it was, and would have snatch'd it from him: Upon that, he threw himself at the King's Feet, conjuring him to take his Life, be∣fore he robb'd him of his Picture. The Conqueror seeing him in so humble a Posture, took pity of him, and offer'd to let him keep his Picture, pro∣vided he gave him to know the Original. The Young Gentleman reply'd, That he could not sa∣tisfie him upon that point, because he did not know himself whose it was: And with the same Breath, acquainted him how it came into his Hands, and offer'd to get it Copy'd. The Prince was so much taken with the Beauty of the Pi∣cture, that he caus'd several Copies to be drawn from it: These he order'd to be hung up in the Temples of his false Gods, in order to adore the Original, which he thought could not be so pret∣ty, unless she were Divine. The Young Gentle∣man having thus sav'd his Picture, was afraid of losing it at <HI>Carthagena,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> took it; Fancying, that all the World were as great Fools as he, and the Prince that made an Idol of it. The first Compliment he made to Mr. <HI>Poin∣tis,</HI> was, That by the right of Conquest, he was Master of all that he had; but as for that Pi∣cture, he would part with it and his Life at the same time. Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> was so much dazzl'd with the prospect of the Riches that lay before him, that he had forgot every thing, and even Madam <HI>Ferrand;</HI> and thus having other things in view than the Picture, he gave him to know, that he might be easie, and what Pictures he had a mind for, were those of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and other Princes, engrav'd upon Gold; and as for the Pictures of Women, he would quit them for a trifle, 'provided they were only valuable
<PB N="52" REF="205"/>
for their Beauty, or good Painting. This Pro∣mise put the Young Gentleman in good Heart: And Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> having cloy'd himself with the Plunder of the Town, had the curiosity to look upon the Thing that occasioned the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Sighs: for he gave deep Sighs every minute, which made people believe, that he was a very p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. He shew'd Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> the Picture, upon his making Oath, that he would not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll in Love with it. As soon as Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> saw it, he knew it to be the Princess of <HI>Conti</HI>'s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he knew the Lady, and that his Love was fixed upon a very deserving Object. The Young Gentleman pressing him to tell who the Lady was, he could not deny his Request. Up∣on this Discovery, it had been very unhandsome in such a Lover as this, not to go to <HI>France.</HI> Ac∣cord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngly he intreated Mr. <HI>Pointis,</HI> to let him have a place in one of his Ships. Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> having promised him that Favour, did not make him stay long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he set Sail: but tho' the Sea-Air c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld the Gentleman's Passion for his Mistress, the Admiral round himself in a greater quandary than the Gentleman. An <HI>English</HI> Squadron, much stronger th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his own, having notice, that he was still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Carthagena,</HI> stood towards that place, in order to dispossess him of the Riches he had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. The Governor of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Government, and was not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll pleased with the Usage that he and the Buc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eers h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> met with, did nevertheless give him Advice of their Design, because it concern'd the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest. Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> made such good use of the Intelligence, that he weigh'd Anchor and avoided the <HI>English,</HI> and at last arriv'd at <HI>Brest,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter having s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap'd several Storms, and other troublesome Accidents.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="206"/>
Before his arrival at <HI>Brest,</HI> several Accidents hap∣pen'd both at Sea and Land. The most considerable Occurrence at Sea, was Mr. <HI>Nesmond</HI>'s falling in with three <HI>English</HI> Ships, homeward bound from <HI>India.</HI> They made a tolerable Defence, but be∣ing unequally match'd, <HI>i. e.</HI> three to six, they were taken. All the three were richly Laden; and Mr. <HI>Nesmond</HI> having put Mr. <HI>Montchevreuil</HI> with one <HI>Bene,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> man, both of 'em Sea-Lien tenants, on board of one of these Ships; these two plotted together to defraud the Owners of the Prize, while no-body minded 'em. Accordingly they secur'd all they could; and shar'd some Di∣amonds, and other valuable Goods, equally be∣tween 'em. But Mr. <HI>Montchevreuil</HI>'s Indiscretion, in spending at <HI>Brest</HI> much more than his Incomes could afford, quickly discovered the Intrigue: His Father allowed him nothing; and all he had was a Pension of one thousand Livers, and his E∣quipage. Upon this, Intendant <HI>Begnon</HI> smelling the matter, gave notice of it to the Court. His Interest at Court might have prevented his Ar∣rest, if Mr. <HI>Begnon</HI>'s Intelligence had not been put out of all doubt, by his imprudence, in set∣ting out his very Foot-men with the best Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins he had taken in that Ship. <HI>Bene,</HI> indeed, acted more prudently; and it was not long of him that the thing took Air: But Mr. <HI>Montchevreuil</HI>'s im∣prudence carried it so far, that they were both taken up. <HI>Bene,</HI> who had not so much Interest as the other, could not get off, notwithstanding the Wisdom of his Conduct. <HI>Begnon</HI> wrote him a thundring Note, concluding in these few words, <HI>You are happy in having Mr.</HI> Montchevreuil <HI>for a Partner in your Robbery; Assure your self, that if you were by your self, I would have ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d you to be Hang'd in forty eight Hours.</HI> At the Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es interceeded on his behalf, because he was a good Officer; but forasmuch as the one could
<PB N="54" REF="207"/>
not be indited without the other, they were both clear'd after five or six months Imprisonment. But after all, if all the Thieves had been Hang∣ed, <HI>Bene</HI> had got more Company than Mr. <HI>Mont∣chevreuil:</HI> For at the Sale of these Prizes, which amounted in Gross to 2500000 Livres, a great many things were transacted, that were not very fair. Those who had a mind to 'em, gave a large Present to the persons that were empower∣ed to adjudge 'em, to prevent their being sold by Retail, pursuant to the desire of those who were interess'd in the matter. But whatever the Present was, they lost nothing by it; for at <HI>Nants</HI> they sold the Goods by Retail, at three Millions profit.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> im∣ploy'd his utmost endeavours, to make good the Character the King had procur'd him, by giving him that rich Benefice. Tho' his Brother's For∣tune might have done something for him, yet he did not owe his Preferment to that, but only to his own Merit. While he was Bishop of <HI>Cha∣lons,</HI> a See that he had before his accession to that of <HI>Paris,</HI> he always acted up to the Office of a Holy Prelate. To continue the same course of Piety that he had always follow'd, he made Head a∣gainst Vice: And accordingly one of his first Edicts, after his accession to the last See, was levell'd against the Masquerades; an Abuse, that in earnest ought not to be suffer'd among Christians. What a strange preparation is the Commission of a thou∣sand lewd and foolish Actions, for the Repent∣ance that ought to be Preach'd up in <HI>Lent!</HI> The Emperor extirpated this disorder at <HI>Vienna,</HI> under the sole pretext of the War with the <HI>Turks.</HI> Nobody was there allow'd to disguise themselves; and even School-Boys were not allow'd to do it with impunity. However, the Archbishop not using the same pretence to sink that disorder at
<PB N="55" REF="208"/>
<HI>Paris,</HI> but that of the Love and Gratitude we owe to God, for shedding his Blood for us upon the Cross, had not the same success as the Empe∣ror had at <HI>Vienna.</HI> If he had had recourse to the King, for the putting his Edict in execution, per∣haps the fear of displeasing that Monarch would have gone farther, than the fear of God. But whether it was, that he did not speak of it to the King, or that the King had some Reasons of State for not minding him; there was as many Masquerades that Year, as if there had never been an Order against 'em. The Archbishop finding he could not compass his design, bent his Thoughts upon another Disorder, that wanted as much to be remedy'd; I mean the Debauchery of Women: that was got to such a height, that no Language can reach. There was always two Convents at <HI>Paris,</HI> for shutting up these Wretches; and two Societies have been since Erected, for the same purpose, by the Care and Charity of some Ver∣tuous Ladies. In these Societies, they are far from being used so severely, as at the <HI>Magdalon∣nettes,</HI> and <HI>Filles Repent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> where the Whips are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o far from freeing a So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l from Vice, that, on the contrary, they make 'em regret, that they cannot continue their past course of Life. We must not pretend to translate a Person all on a sudden, from Vice to Vertue, especially by Cor∣rection; for that ought to be effected by degrees, and rather by Perswasion, than by Force. This gentle method was used in these two Societies; one of which is call'd St. <HI>Isidore,</HI> and the other <HI>Bon Post<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur.</HI> The latter had this peculiar Custom, that they forc'd none to come among 'em. All the Actions of that House, were answerable to its Title. The Girls that repented of their Lewdness, or were afraid of falling into it, came thither of their own accord, and were entertain'd there as long as they pleas'd; and their <HI>Governantes</HI> ei∣ther
<PB N="56" REF="209"/>
procur'd 'em some Place in a Person of Qua∣lity's House, if they were fit for Service, or got 'em Husbands, if they lik'd that better. When they desired to be gone, they were suffered to go, tho' 'twas to be fear'd, they might return to their Vomit. This Society, and this Custom is still kept up; and all pious Persons, of what Condi∣tion soever, not only visit these lost Sheep, that are thus return'd to their Flock, but likewise Eat with 'em very often. This they take to be a more effectual method, as indeed it is, to reclaim them, than that of letting Dogs loose upon 'em. And 'tis for this reason that the House is entitl'd <HI>Bon Pasteur, The good Shepherd;</HI> for the <HI>Good Shep∣herd,</HI> who, properly speaking, is the Son of God, did not scruple to eat with <HI>Publicans.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Daughters of St. <HI>Isidore,</HI> they were not used so very gently, as those of the <HI>Bon Pasteur;</HI> but kept a sort of a Medium between these and the <HI>Magdalonnettes.</HI> The Archbishop, whose Province it is to take Cognisance of all that passes in that sort of Houses, knowing that these liv'd under a Director, whose Doctrine he suspected, would have taken them from him. But they stood by him with some warmth; and the more they shew'd their zeal to keep him, the more the Archbishop pressed to put another in his place. At last, they told him freely, That if he put in another, they would not receive him, and that they would ra∣ther disperse than comply with it. Now they had liberty to disperse, for they were not settled there, either by the King's Letter, or an Order from the Court of Justice. Accordingly, perceiv∣ing that the Archbishop was immoveable, and fully resolv'd to subject them to his Obedience, they actually dispers'd; for which the Archbishop was blam'd by a great many, especially by those who were not acquainted with the reason, that had oblig'd him to do as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="210"/>
At that time, Mr. <HI>Verthamont de Villemont</HI> dyed, who was the only Man that perhaps made the King depart from his wonted Moderation. He was Master of Requests; and making use of the Authority he had among the Gown-men, both by his Place, and by the numerousness of his Rela∣tions and Friends, did what he could to Ruine a Gentleman of the Name of <HI>Servon,</HI> that had been his Neighbour in the Country. <HI>Servon</HI> being Re∣lated to Mr. <HI>Perefixe,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> had recourse to him, who engag'd to protect him, af∣ter he found that Magistrate so proud of his Interest, that he openly contemn'd both his Friend and him. <HI>Verthamont</HI> finding that the Archbishop had declar'd against him, and that he had imbark'd in that Cause for the sake of some Interest of his own, form'd a design against his Life, and alledg'd, that he had a Love int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gue upon that side. On the other hand, the Archbishop form'd a design against his Life. Thus th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rais'd between 'em the greatest Suit that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en seen for a long time; and the Cause being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought before the Council, the King himself a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d at the Decision; which Mr. <HI>Villemont,</HI> who knew his Integrity and Justice, was not pleas'd with. The Archbishop being sensible that his Honour was very much touch'd by the Accusation prefer'd against him by that Magistrate; and that 'twas not enough for him to maintain, that it was an Imposture, as it was, but to prove it to be such; upon this view I say, he desir'd him to condescend to the Circum∣stances of the Fact, in order to his Conviction. Accordingly <HI>Verthamont</HI> advanc'd, That on such a Day, at such an Hour, in such a Year, and at such a Place, he had an interview with a certain Lady, whom it was well known he had formerly visited with some sort of Familiarity. Now, Mr. <HI>Perefixe</HI> was at that time at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> of which he was Bishop before his Accession to the See of
<PB N="58" REF="211"/>
<HI>Paris;</HI> and for fear <HI>Verthamont</HI> should retract and throw his mistake upon the weakness of his Me∣mory; he pretended at first to make but weak Defences, in order to make the other maintain his Forgery with more Impudence. This <HI>Verthamont</HI> did not fail to do; for fancying that the whole Court was on his side, the Answers being so fri∣volous, he insisted on the Charge, because the Archbishop had summon'd him to declare, whe∣ther he adher'd to his Accusation, or not. He likewise condescended to a great many particu∣lars of matter of Fact, which seem'd probable. The Archbishop finding him engag'd so far, that he could not afterwards retract, desir'd to be allow'd to prove himself <HI>Alibi.</HI> This was the best method he could take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o justifie his Innocence, and retort the Calumny upon his Adversary. The Court could not refuse to hear his Proof; so, he prov'd, not only by Witnesses, but likewise by an Order he made, as Bishop that day, which was Publish'd throughout his Diocess; he prov∣ed, I say, that he was above one hundred and fif∣ty Leagues off from the place of the alledg'd In∣terview. <HI>Verthamont</HI> was strangely surpris'd, when he saw himself thus Convicted. However, as all Litigious Men have some back Door or o∣ther, he alledg'd, That, indeed, he was out as to the Year; but as to the Fact it self, and the Day, he was certainly in the right: But after what was past, that Reason would not bear: So that he was not only order'd to make reparation of the Prelat's Honour; but he, and his Posterity, were declar'd uncapable for ever of enjoying any Magistracy. The Sentence contain'd likewise o¦ther Punishments against him, which 'twere too tedious to insert here. However, fancying the King would be so good as to dispense with part of 'em, he had the boldness to appear at the King's Levee some days after. The King was
<PB N="59" REF="212"/>
incens'd when he saw him, and commanded him, in har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h words, to depart his Chamber. <HI>Vertha∣mont</HI> obey'd, without staying for a second Order; and was even oblig'd to retire to the Country, for the King would not allow him so much as to continue at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Plenipotentiaries continued still at <HI>Reswick,</HI> and it being uncertain whether the Peace would be concluded or not, new Edicts were issued forth. One of 'em oblig'd the great Cities and Towns of the Provinces, to take Lanthorns, like those at <HI>Paris;</HI> and to buy themselves off by a Tax to be laid upon the twentieth Penny. By that Edict the King promis'd, in consideration of that Tax, to be at the charge of the Lights for ever. In fine, 'twas visible, that this was only a new in∣vention for raising of Money, which was much wanted at that time. Mr. <HI>Caumartin,</HI> Intendant to the Finances, was order'd to carry the Edict to the first President, in order to have it con∣vey'd to the Attorney-General, who read it with the coldest Humour of any Man in the World. Mr. <HI>Caumartin</HI> expected, that when he had read it, he would give him his Sentiments of the matter, which he meant to Communicate to the Minister of State. But the Magistrate continuing silent for some time, he turn'd the Edict over, and put it several times into the Hands of the Magistrate, who still return'd it: At last, being tired with shuffling it to and again, he broke silence, and said, It was a fine Edict, and that he and his Friends ought to be convinc'd that it was such. At least, said he, for my particular satisfaction, I expect∣ed you would have done me the honour to tell me, in whose Head all these Lanthorns were first projected. Upon this Expression Mr. <HI>Caumartin</HI> could not refrain from Laughing, and imparted the occasion of Laughter to his Friends. After all, the Case was laid before the Parliament,
<PB N="60" REF="213"/>
and no one had the same curiosity as this Magi∣strate had.</P>
<P>The Conferences at <HI>Reswick</HI> did not divert the King from sending puissant Armies into the Field. By vertue of the Peace of <HI>Savoy,</HI> he was Superior in force to his Enemies; and part of his Troops that had serv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> he had transported to <HI>Catalonia.</HI> In this Province he was still Master of the Cities of <HI>Roses</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> with some other Places of importance; and had a free ac∣cess to <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lona,</HI> which is the Metrapolitan of that Country, and, in a manner, the Barrier of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy. This City, which is Rich, Great, well Peopled, and the ordinary Residence of the Nobility of that Country, is situated on the Mediterranean, and has a very considerable port upon that side. The opposition that the House of <HI>Austria</HI> had hitherto made to the Peace, mov'd the King to Besiege it: He thought, that if he could take it, he could at least, bring the <HI>Spanish</HI> Branch to reasonable terms, considering, that after that, even <HI>Madrid</HI> itself was not secure. His Majesty wrote his Thoughts of this matter to Mr. <HI>Vendome,</HI> who commanded the Troops in that Country. This General sent him word, that the Troops he had there were not sufficient for so great an Enterprize; and that it could not be compassed with less than fifty Thousand Men. Now at that time he had s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wenty five Thousand. But His Majesty having ten Thousand more ready upon a Call, comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded him to make prepara∣tions for the Design, and promis'd to send 'em to him when he wanted 'em. After such positive Orders, Mr. <HI>Vendome</HI> had nothing else to do, but to concert all measures for satisfying the King. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> having already taken the Ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m at the loss of their other Places in that Province, and perceiving that the King meant to possess himself of that Place, sent their best Troops
<PB N="61" REF="214"/>
thither. The Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being the Empreses's Sister, desir'd the Emperor to send some Regiments under the pretence of preserving that Province. But that was not her main Design: She had a greater eye upon the interest of Arch-Duke <HI>Charles,</HI> her Nephew; for her Husband having no Issue, and being not very healthy, she had a mind to se∣cure to him the Crown that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. had be∣queath'd him by his Will. Pursuant to this de∣sign, she had brought some <HI>Germans</HI> into the Council, in order to stifle the Artifices, that <HI>France,</HI> and even some <HI>Spanish</HI> Grandees might set on foot, either for the interest of that Crown, or for their own; for there were some of 'em that laid claim to the Blood of the Ancient Kings of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stile,</HI> and others to that of the Kings of <HI>Arragon.</HI> These <HI>German</HI> Counsellors acted in concert with her; and the Emperor sent 'em Instructions, to the end that nothing might be concerted contrary to his Interest, or that of the Arch-Duke, his Son. In the mean time, His Imperial Majesty sent the Troops that were desired; and it being much his Interest not to lose <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he intreated the <HI>En∣glish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to send a Fleet into the <HI>Medi∣terranean.</HI> He was very sensible what was like∣ly to happen, because the King made new pre∣parations in <HI>Provence,</HI> and seem'd to have nothing so much in view as the Conquest of that Place. However, his Intreaty did not come so very sea∣sonably; whether it was, that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> had occasion to employ their Ships else∣where, or, which is very probable, that they thought the taking of that Place would so humble the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> that they would not oppose the Peace any longer; for they did not much trouble their Heads upon the matter.</P>
<P>While preparations for War were made, not only in that Country, but in all the other seats of War; a new War broke out in the Church,

which might have caus'd great disorders, if it had not been quickly stifled; indeed it might have been sooner stifled, if the Arch-bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> had not been very complaisant to a certain Gentleman that I shall call by his Name by and by, by which means it took deeper Root than it might have done. To understand this matter throughly, 'twill not be improper to carry our account of things a little higher. In the Popedom of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. a Priest call'd <HI>Molinos,</HI> started up at <HI>Rome,</HI> who taught very uncommon Doctrines, and did not want followers. Among many erroneous Doctrines, this was the greatest, That when the Soul came once to a certain point of Sanctity, it was not capable of sinning, and then it had no part or concern in the Actions of the Body. 'Tis a standing Maxim, that we ought not to censure a Man's in∣tentions, especially when his Morals are uncul∣pable as to outward appearance; and for that reason I shall be very cautious of saying, that this new Sectary, under the pretence of so great Purity, conceal'd a great many Disorders that his Enemies have falsly charg'd upon him. Perhaps he meant, that the Soul cannot controul some Infirmities that we are subject to from our Mo∣ther's Womb: And provided these are detested by her, she is not accountable for 'em before God. Were it so, nothing could be objected against his Doctrine, for such is the Doctrine of the Church; and what St. <HI>Paul</HI> teaches us, who was continually tempted notwithstanding his being one of the greatest Saints in Paradise. However, since a great many uncouth Consequences might be drawn from his way of explaining himself, both upon this Article, and many others, the whole Church rose up against him. <HI>Rome,</HI> in whose view the thing happen'd, Arrested him; and his Case being brought before the Inquisition, he was there Con∣demned
<PB N="63" REF="216"/>
by such Commissioners as were appointed. He submitted himself to their Censure, and some Years after died in Prison: Upon which 'twas ge∣nerally thought, that this new Heresie, known by the name of <HI>Quietism,</HI> was so far from passing the <HI>Alps,</HI> that it died outright with him. But the Case was quite otherwise: For not only <HI>Italy</HI> was stuffed with his Errours, but even <HI>France</HI> itself was tainted with them. One Madam <HI>Guy∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> the Widow of Mr. <HI>Montargis,</HI> who, after the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting of a great Estate upon the Canal of <HI>Bria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> left her with two Children: This Lady, I say, minded nothing less than the true Educa∣tion of her Children: Not that she wanted either Wit or Judgment; nay, on the contrary, she had a greater share of both than what is natural to Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, or what herself ought to have desired: For she meddled with what did not become her, and shoving her No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into Books, pretended to explain not only the Fathers but even the Scripture it self. In fine, having heard of <HI>Molinos</HI> and his Herefie, she could not be easie till she had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Copy of his Books, and canvass'd 'em all over. Malicious People will tell you, that she approv'd of 'em, to cover some Enormities that were charg∣ed upon her. In the mean time, she fell in with a <HI>Barnabite,</HI> a <HI>Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yard</HI> by Nation, who resided in a Convent, belonging to that order at <HI>Montargis.</HI> She made him her Confessour in ordinary and her Confident; and having pour'd her Venom into his Bosom, compil'd a great many Books, either with his help, or without it, so as to make the same Figure in <HI>France,</HI> that <HI>Molinos</HI> had done at <HI>Rome.</HI> Mean while, she ought to have been apprehensive of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate; for tho' the Inquisition has not the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooting in all Countries, yet she was not ignorant that the venting of a new Doctrine was a disallow∣able Action. She dispers'd her Books among the Convents, and several other places; and the Ab∣bot
<PB N="64" REF="217"/>
of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> the Gentleman whose Name I pro∣mised not to forget, finding them of a piece with his Sentiments, approv'd 'em secretly. This he durst not do publickly, by reason that he was made <HI>Sub-praeceptor</HI> to the Children of the Royal Family; and that the discovery of this his Appro∣bation, would not only cut off his arrival at a Bishoprick, but dispossess him of the Post he was then in. However, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Writings being publish'd, began to make a noise in the World; and in regard that the advances contain'd in 'em, incourag'd all the periods of a dissolute Life, or at least, made way for very odd consequences; upon this Consideration, I say, the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> as well as the Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who was then only Bishop of <HI>Chalons,</HI> undertook to make her sensible of her Error. They had Conferences upon this Head with the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> whom they deem'd to be tainted with the same Doctrine. He, on the other hand justify'd her Assertions; and maintain'd, that her Thoughts were Just and Or∣thodox, tho' the Meaning and Explication that they forc'd upon her, was Heretical. He likewise spoke up for her Morals, and the Conduct of her Life, which he pretended to be particularly ac∣quainted with, tho' both the one and the other were much suspected.</P>
<P>The warmth he shew'd in justifying her, con∣firm'd the two Prelates in the Thought, That the Doctrine he vindicated, was as much his own, as hers. They told him as much, and he on the other hand did not deny it; but had the submis∣sion to assure 'em, That he would willingly change his Mind, if he were convinced of the Error. To this purpose, an Assembly was held at <HI>Issi;</HI> but before they met, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> had given in to the Bishop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> a Copy of all her Writings, in order to be examin'd at his leisure. The Bi∣shop examin'd it with all possible Care; and like∣wise
<PB N="65" REF="218"/>
was at the pains of inspecting the Conduct of her Life for some time, by which means he discover'd that she inflamed the Evil, by pretend∣ing to Authorize her Doctrine by Miracles, and a Gift of Prophecy, bestow'd upon her by God. She recounted Stories to this effect, pretending to confirm 'em by credible Witnesses; and in a word, never did Woman, or Man, carry Fanati∣cism so far as she did. In fine, there was cause enough for putting her up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> if it had not been for those who supported her. All the Ab∣bot of <HI>Fenelon</HI>'s Friends were hers; the Duke of <HI>Beauvillers,</HI> Governor to the Princes of the Royal Family, was suspected to be an Abettor of her Errors, as well as the Duke of <HI>Chevreuse,</HI> and their whole Families. The thing that confirm'd the general suspicion of the Duke <HI>de Beauvillers</HI> beyond the rest, was the putting his eight Daugh∣ters into a Convent at <HI>Montargis.</HI> 'Twas con∣cluded from thence, that <HI>Montargis</HI> being the place where this Heresie was first hatched in <HI>France,</HI> that Convent being a Convent of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> was likewise tainted. The whole Family of <HI>Charost</HI> was suspected in like manner of falling in with this Heresie. But that which restrain'd scrupu∣lous and nice Consciences from Condemning it, at a time when they were very sensible of its perni∣cious Consequences, was, That neither the Court, nor <HI>France</HI> itself, could boast of Persons of such Christian Lives, and Regular Morals, as all the Favourers of the new Doctrine were of. Their Piety was not of so late a date, as the Heresie of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> that Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> Reviv'd: From their first appearance at Court, they were all eminent for Vertue; and 'twas in consideration of that, that the King chose to put the Children of <HI>France</HI> under the Government of the Duke of <HI>Beauvil∣lers.</HI> He had been thirty Years a Courtier; and during that space of time, had never counter acted
<PB N="66" REF="219"/>
the Measures of Vertue, which shin'd in all his Actions; and in a word, no Man could be in grea∣ter esteem at Court, than himself. So that, when the Publick saw him charg'd with the Abetting of this new Doctrine, they look'd upon the Charge as Invidious, as well as Zealous. They put this construction upon the matter, that the Post he was in, created him private Enemies, who wanted to succeed him, and stood at nothing to compass their End.</P>
<P>Whatever was in it, the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> who always shewed a disposition to obey what Deci∣sion should be made at <HI>Issi,</HI> joyned with Madam <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yon</HI> in singling out a third Person, who would cast the Ballance upon the side he declared for, if the two Bishops who were to meet should be of a contrary Sentiment. The Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> pre∣tends, in a Book he has lately published, That all this was carried on, without the King's know∣ing any thing of the matter. This I am willing to believe, because he said it. And I likewise be∣lieve, that the reason in his view, was, to pre∣vent the King's having an ill opinion of the Ab∣bot of <HI>Fenelon;</HI> His Majesty being an Enemy to all new Opinions, not only out of Piety, but out of Policy; since nothing is more apt to disturb the Repose of a State, than Innovations in Reli∣gious Matters. The third Person I mention'd but now, was Mr. <HI>Tronson,</HI> Doctor of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> Superior of the Seminary of S. <HI>Sulpitius,</HI> a Man of sound Principles, and one whose Life and Con∣versation were blameless. Before the Assemblies met, the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon</HI> had time to Compile a Vindication of Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Books; but not∣withstanding all his Precaution, they were Con∣demn'd with one general Voice. Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> had promised to submit to the Judgment of these three Doctors, as well as the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon.</HI> And both of 'em seeming to submit, these Judges
<PB N="67" REF="220"/>
thought the Matter was laid asleep, tho at the same time, the Fire was only smoother'd under the Ashes. The Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> had a mind to be a Bishop, before he kindled it again. And in effect, he was no sooner Install'd Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> but he return'd to his Vomit, notwith∣standing that he had invited the two Prelates that Contemn'd his Doctrine, to assist at the Ceremony of his Consecration. However, he went on with a great deal of Precaution, pretending that the Sentence pronounced against him, was only owing to a misunderstanding of the true Sense of the Books under Examination. He gave high Enco∣miums of the Vertue of that Lady, which at that time began to be more warmly attack'd than before, for 'twas alledg'd, She had only reviv'd <HI>Molinos</HI>'s Doctrine for a Cloak to the disorderly things she was charg'd with. Madam <HI>Guyon,</HI> for her part was so far from a true Submission to the Censure of those Judges, that she began again to Write a Vindication of her Doctrine. The Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who pretended all along to keep in with the two Prelates that had Con∣demn'd him, as if the Allegations he had made on the behalf of the Lady, and her Principles, were such as they would have joyn'd with, if they had been fully acquainted with her Person and Doctrines. This Prelate, I say, made a coun∣terfeit Censure of the liberty that the Lady took in setting Pen to Paper again. At last, the King was inform'd of the Matter, but so, that nothing was said against the Bishop of <HI>Cambray;</HI> either because they had a mind to try if they could gain him otherwise, or because they fear'd his Plot was so well contriv'd, that he would come off clear, notwithstanding all the Testimony they could bring against him. Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> was Im∣prison'd at <HI>Vincennes,</HI> by the King's Order. As the Mind of Man is always curious and fond
<PB N="68" REF="221"/>
of Novelties, so her Books were sought for e∣very where, insomuch that there was not half enough for those that wanted 'em. This Lady had a Daughter that was married to the <HI>Count de Vaux,</HI> the Eldest Son of the late Mr. <HI>Fouquet,</HI> Superintendant of the Finances. He was Brother to the Dutchess of <HI>Charost;</HI> and being troubled at the Imprisonment of his Mother-in-Law, as, indeed, he ought to have been, He left no Stone unturn'd to procure her release. The Abbot of <HI>Fenelon</HI> did the same thing under hand. 'Twas represented to the King, that she herself would condemn her own Advances, if she thought they imported what was alleg'd against her, and that she was so far from meaning any such thing, that she thought herself oblig'd to take up her Pen again to undeceive the World; but since His Majesty was displeas'd with her Writing, she would take care not to transgress his Orders for the future. In fine, her Resolution to submit to the Doctrine of the Church, was so dextrously represented to the King, that he condescended to set her at liberty, upon condition, that she should retire to a Con∣vent, just by <HI>Paris,</HI> where her Conduct might be more narrowly inspected: Thither she went, and behaved herself for some time so well, that 'twas really believ'd she was wean'd from her Errors. In the mean time, this thing having made a great noise, the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> resolv'd to publish a Book to undeceive those that might favour the New Doctrine. He communicated his Design not only to the Bishop of <HI>Chalons,</HI> who was then made Archbishop of <HI>Paris;</HI> but likewise to the Bi∣shop of <HI>Cambray.</HI> He gave the latter to know, that he hop'd he would affix his Approbation to the Book, which he desir'd both out of respect to him, and for enforcing and recommending it to the World. He represented farther, That there was a general Report, that he had favour'd that La∣dy;
<PB N="69" REF="222"/>
and that by this means he would shew to the World, that tho' he once thought well of her, yet he did not subscribe to her Errors. The Bi∣shoy of <HI>Meaux</HI> alledges, That he promised his Approbation, and that after this interview, they parted good Friends. This he avers openly in a Book of his that's but just Published. How∣ever, the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> went some days after, to visit the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and ac∣quainted him, that he had a mind to write upon that Subject himself, but would not put his Book to the Press, before he knew his Sentiments of it. The Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> endeavour'd to dissuade him from pursuing his Design, and re∣monstrated to him, That the least partiality to that Lady's Tenets, would infallibly ruine him. The other reply'd, That he might easily imagine he had no mind to Print any ill thing, since he offered to shew it first to him. But this Ans∣wer did not please the Archbishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> He continued his utmost endeavour to take him off from his Resolution; but at last finding he could not prevail, he desir'd, that at least, he should not Print his Book till the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> had Published his. The Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> promis'd not to do it; and the Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> thinking he would keep his word, ac∣quainted the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> with what he had said. In the mean time he expected a sight of the Manuscript; and, indeed, the Bishop of <HI>Cam∣bary</HI> sent it to him, but it was writ in such an ab∣stracted manner, that the first time he read it, he could understand little or nothing of it. In that Manuscript he set forth, That if the Doctrine of the Quietists consisted in the belief of such and such things, he was ready to Condemn it; but if it maintain'd such and such things, he was ready to vindicate it. Thus was his Book divided into several Chapters, some containing a description
<PB N="70" REF="223"/>
of the Quietism, That all Doctors ought to re∣ject; and others of the Quietism, That, as he alledg'd, all the World ought to approve of. The Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had not much time to peruse it, being much taken up in the exercise of his Episcopal Office, thought he might keep the Manuscript as long as he would, espe∣cially considering, that the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray</HI> had promis'd not to put it to the Press till the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Book was Published. But he would needs have it again, and the Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> gave it him, after he had shewn him two or three Chapters that he thought proper to be lick'd over again. But, after all, this Book was Published before the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s; and the Author having thus broke his word to the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> fell out both with him and the other Prelate. The Bishop of <HI>Chartres</HI> joyn'd with them in representing to the King the per∣nicious Consequences that would insue upon the toleration of that New Doctrine. His Majesty having spoke of it to the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI> that Prelate pretended to maintain, that he had said nothing in his Book, but what was con∣formable to the Tradition of the Church; and that he was willing to refer the matter to <HI>Rome,</HI> and submit to their decision. The King not be∣ing qualify'd to judge of these things himself, was oblig'd to strike Sail to such a plausible sub∣mission: But the other three Prelates being still at his Ear, remonstrated to him, That 'twas not pro∣per for the Royal Off-spring to be under the Con∣duct of a Man that was so notoriously suspected of Heresie. This gave His Majesty such an Alarm, that he ordered the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> to re∣tire to his Archbishoprick. In the mean time, the Cause was transferr'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> as being the only Tribunal capable to determine a Question of that Nature. Each of the Parties endeavour'd to
<PB N="71" REF="224"/>
make Friends in that place. Mr. <HI>Bossuet</HI> sent his Nephew thither, who, by the Interest he had be∣yond others, might be capable to put his Orders in Execution. The Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> sent likewise a Person that he confided in, tho' his greatest hopes depended upon Cardinal <HI>Bouillon,</HI> who was his particular Friend. He order'd him to prolong the Affair as much as possible, that he might have time to set things in a clear light, and to give His Holiness to understand, that the op∣position he met with proceeded more from a party concern, than from a Religious Zeal. In the mean while, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Principles were found in the Royal Abbey of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> at St. <HI>Cir,</HI> and a disco∣very was made, that some Nuns were so influ∣enc'd by 'em, that they were downright Quietists. Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> was mightily troubled at this, she being the Person to whom the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> owes the Erecting of that Religious House, in which they have the opportunity of being rid of their Daughters for a time, and sometimes for ever: And what troubled her yet more, a Nun that was her particular Favourite, was one of the poyson'd number. However, the King transplant∣ed 'em to other Convents, to prevent their infect∣ing of the rest. This Sect which had been ex∣tinct at <HI>Rome</HI> from the Condemnation of <HI>Molinos,</HI> began to revive there, when the Abettors under∣stood, that it still had footing beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> and even that an Archbishop had openly declar'd himself a Protector of it. Such was the confor∣mity of their Sentiments with his, that they cry'd up whatever he advanc'd; and tho' they did not know him, and indeed had scarce ever heard of him, yet the whole City was presently fill'd with several Writings, in which they not only applaud∣ed his Doctrine, but made an infinite number of <HI>Panegyricks</HI> upon his Person, as if they had been intimately acquainted with him. The Archbishop
<PB N="72" REF="225"/>
of <HI>Cambray</HI> being acquainted with all that pass'd at <HI>Rome</HI> by an Express he had sent thither, did not nevertheless confide so much in them, as to abstain from Writing himself: For he sent 'em several Papers by way of Letters, in which he explain'd the Objections made against his Book, in order to rectifie the consequences that might be drawn from thence. In the mean time, nothing was said to Madam <HI>Guyon,</HI> nor to the Archbishop's Friends that were about the Children of <HI>France.</HI> Among these was the Abbot of <HI>Beaumont</HI> his Ne∣phew, to whom he had procur'd the place of be∣ing Sub-praeceptor to the young Princes, and who had always acted up to the Duty of his Post. In regard 'tis natural for a Nephew to adhere to his Uncle, and that the obligation he had receiv'd from his Uncle, suggested a Presumption, that he would not easily depart from his Interest, the King was sollicited to disgrace him. 'Twas re∣presented to His Majesty, That the Young Prin∣ces were not safe under his Conduct, no more than under his Uncle's; and that tho' he had not publickly taken up with his Errors, yet 'twas to be fear'd he might suck in their Contagion. The King thought it an unjust thing, upon a simple suspicion, to turn a Man out of his Post, that could not be convicted of any Crime. He was resolv'd to see farther into the matter before he would condescend to any such thing. Thus was he continued in his place, and his Enemies were forc'd to wait for a more favourable opportunity to ruine him.</P>
<P>While the Bishops were thus making War one with another, two Ecclesiastick Orders were re∣concil'd, that had not always liv'd in a good un∣derstanding; I mean the Jesuits and the Priests of the Oratory, who upon several occasions have de∣monstrated to the World, that they are not al∣ways of the same Opinion. The Doctor of St.
<PB N="73" REF="226"/>
<HI>Martha,</HI> a Person of great Merit, distinguishing Piety, and profound Learning, was turn'd out from being General of the Priests of the Oratory, by the intrigues of the Jesuits, supported by the late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>de Chanvallon,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> To pry into what was done in that Society, the Je∣suits, as well as the Archbishop, had got a false Brother there, who gave 'em notice of every thing, so that no-body could imagine how the dis∣covery came; for he was so disguis'd, that he was taken for the greatest Zealot of all the Brethren. An Archbishoprick was promis'd him in recom∣pence for his Service, and the Good Fathers were as good as their word in due time, that is, when they found another of their Society, that pro∣mis'd to perform what he did. The conferring of a Bishoprick upon this Traitor, rais'd a sus∣picion in that Society; but since it might be at∣tributed to something else than the true Cause, that was not enough for a true Conviction. At that time the Traitor of St. <HI>Martha</HI> was not yet depos'd; he continuing his steady Course, quickly observ'd that there were Traitors among them, tho' he did not determine whether the Bishop or another. However, that Bishop being remov∣ed from thence, the simpler sort of People look∣ed upon that as a vindication of him, tho' the more sensible part of Mankind did not excuse him the more for that. They fancy'd what was true, that he had given his Place to another, who would be equally zealous upon the prospect of the like Recompence. They were in the right of it; for they did nothing but what the Arch∣bishop and the Jesuits knew: However they did not trouble themselves, being sensible that they did nothing but what was to be done. In the mean time, the Doctor of St. <HI>Martha</HI> had occa∣sion to have some business with the Archbishop; and one day when he had his Audience, that
<PB N="74" REF="227"/>
Prelate put him into his Closet, till he had finish'd a Conference with a person upon a bu∣siness of Consequence. As soon as the Doctor enter'd the Closet, he spy'd upon the Table, a∣mong other Papers, one that he knew to be the Hand of one of his Priests; and having the curiosity to know what it was, found it to be an account he gave the Archbishop of a thing that had been privately concerted among them. This Paper he put in his Pocket, thinking the Arch∣bishop would not perceive that 'twas he that took it, and carry'd it home, after finishing the Affair he came upon. Immediately upon his re∣turn he consulted with those of his Society, that he knew would be faithful in keeping the secret, whether or not he should shew this Paper to him that wrote it. Some were against the shewing of it, because that would give the Archbishop to know, that 'twas he that took it; but others thought this no inconveniency; nay, on the con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary, they thought they were oblig'd to shew that they knew both the Traitor and the Treache∣ry. The Father joyn'd with the last, and accor∣dingly took aside the writer of the Paper that was then in his Pocket, and check'd him for what he had done. The writer offer'd to deny the Fact, fancying that he spoke only by sus∣picion. Then the Father of St. <HI>Martha</HI> advis'd him in a Christian manner, not to add a Lye to his former Fault, and withal acquainted him, that he knew all the particulars, for which rea∣son 'twas in vain for him to offer to disguise any thing. The treacherous Brother was of the same Humour with those, who, when once they have advanc'd a thing, could rather see it cut in peices, than lop any thing of it: For in pursuance of their Temper, he insisted still upon the Negative. But the General not being able longer to bear his impudent Lying, produc'd the writing out of
<PB N="75" REF="228"/>
his Pocket, and prov'd the Charge against him by his own hand Writing. The Traitor was migh∣tily surpriz'd at the appearance of the Paper; having then nothing more to say, all his reserve was to cry out upon the Archbishop for ruining him entirely, by giving his Paper to the Gene∣ral. The Archbishop made Oath that it did not come that way; and well he might, since it was discover'd as above. However, the Archbishop smelling from thence, that the Father had snatch'd up that Paper when he was in the Closet, advis'd the false Brother not to be concern'd, for that he would procure the Royal Protection for him, in case his Society offer'd to affront him. In effect, the Society of which he was a Member design'd to expel him; but the Archbishop prohibited them in the King's Name, to think of it; so that he continued among these Priests, and does to this day. In the mean time the Archbishop could not for∣get the Trick that the Father of St. <HI>Martha</HI> had plaid him. That joyn'd with other things, gave the Archbishop an opportunity of representing him to the King as a Jansenist, and imploying the Royal Authority to depose him. Father <HI>de la Tour,</HI> the present General of that Order, was elected in his room, and deserv'd that Post upon several accounts, especially by reason of his sin∣gular Piety, and distinguishing Zeal. The Je∣suits oppos'd his Election under hand, alledging, That he was as much a Jansenist as the Father of St. <HI>Martha.</HI> Several things were offer'd to∣wards his justification; but that very thing that was design'd for his further Ruine, prevented his exclusion. He was Confessor to one Madam <HI>de Fond Pertuis,</HI> that was a zealous Devotee to Mr. <HI>Arnaud,</HI> insomuch that she went to <HI>Flanders</HI> several times during the last War. This new General having advice of this, prohibited her to return to <HI>Flanders</HI> again, unless she chose another
<PB N="76" REF="229"/>
Confessor. But she did not stand to go thither once more, in spite of his order to the contrary. However he did not offer to enquire further into her Conduct; but the thing being heard of at Court; the King saw plainly that he was not so much a Jansenist as he was represented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to be, in regard he censur'd that Lady's adhering to one that was reckon'd the head of that Sect. Thus was his exclusion prevented; and the Jesuits finding what a good Opinion the King had of him, invited him to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a solemn Festival in the Church of St. <HI>Louis.</HI> He return'd their Complement by de∣siring them to single out one of their Society to Preach before the Priests of the Oratory, upon the day of another solemn Festival. Thus was the Reconciliation brought about, that I spoke of but now. But, after all, I doubt if the Je∣suits were cordial in the matter; for this Gene∣ral had for some time indeavour'd to stifle their Practice. A great many Ladies of Quality that us'd to confess to Father <HI>Bourdaloux,</HI> or some of their Society, desir'd that he might be their Di∣rector. Among others the Dutchess of <HI>Aumont</HI> deserted them, and put in with him: And this be∣ing a Practice that seldom passes with impunity among Directors, would have eterniz'd the Quar∣rel between the two Companies, if the Jesuits, who have fully as much Policy as Learning, had not thought it proper to take no farther notice of it. At this day Father <HI>de la Tour</HI> Preaches in their Church; but as he is not equal to many of 'em, either in Gracefulness or Eloquence, so they did not stand to give him the precedency as to the Direction of Consciences, because he, for his part, was oblig'd to stoop to them in the way of Preaching. Madam <HI>Harlai,</HI> the Plenipotentiary's Lady, had become one of his Penitents, ever af∣ter she had the happiness to be convinc'd, that it was impossible to work her Salvation in this
<PB N="77" REF="230"/>
World, if she liv'd as most Women now a days do: But being as fond of Gaming as ever her Husband could be, particularly of <HI>Lansquenet,</HI> which is as bewitching as <HI>Bassette,</HI> insomuch, that when Women are once seiz'd with a Passion for it, they'll rather sell their Smock than abstain from it: This Lady, I say, being such a passionate Lover of that Game, that 'twas to be fear'd she might relapse into her old vomit, by frequenting publick Company every day; This Director gave her four of his other Penitents to have an eye upon her. These Spies reliev'd one another under the pre∣tence of keeping her Company; and she was the less sensible of the Design, because they were all four much of her Age and Condition. One, in∣deed was of a higher Birth than she, as being the Widow of a Son of the Blue-Ribbon, one of whose Ancestors had been a Marshal of <HI>France.</HI> For, notwithstanding that the Lawyers have a great value for their Character, especially when their Magistracy gives as great a distinction as the Family of <HI>Harlai</HI> is possessed of; yet 'tis certain, that there's a great deal of difference between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gown and the Sword, when the latter is attended with distinguishing Circumstances. This Lady had been the Marchioness of St. <HI>Valeri.</HI> As for her own Family she was a <HI>Bullion,</HI> that is to say, the Daughter of the Marquis of <HI>Mon Lovet;</HI> a Marquis indeed of a late standing, but of a golden Nobility; for he was the Son of Mr. <HI>de Bullion,</HI> Superintendant of the Finances, who left three Children, among which the descendants of the Eldest were only capable to keep his Riches; as for the other two, their Posterity has no resem∣blance of the Superintendant that was once in their Family; they are as poor as Devils, and the third of these Children commenc'd his mise∣ry in their Life: time, by making an unlucky Mar∣riage. He fell in Love with his Mother's Wo∣man,
<PB N="78" REF="231"/>
and Married her, upon whch his Mother disinherited him. After he had quench'd his Pas∣sion with Enjoyment, he quickly became sensible of his Fault; but 'twas then too late to think of a Remedy. However, being very much troubled for the loss of such a fine Succession, he left <HI>Lions,</HI> where he was wont to live, and came to <HI>Paris;</HI> having first instructed his Wife in what she was to do towards the backing of his De∣sign. The Orders he gave her, were, to go into the Country, and spread a Report in the City, that she was at the Point of Death: Now, it being customary in all places to inlarge Reports as they spread, the whole City of <HI>Lions</HI> was presently fill'd with the noise, not only of the Lady's sham Illness, but even of her Death. Her Husband, who had been hitherto frustrated in all his attempts towards the regaining of his Mother's Favour, knowing how cases stood at <HI>Lions,</HI> went into deep mourning, and so repair∣ed to St. <HI>Eustache,</HI> where his Mother commonly went. He cast himself, as 'twere, accidentally in her way; and she seeing him in such a Garb, had the curiosity to inform herself under hand, of the Reason of it; for she would not speak to him herself. Her followers being perswaded that his Wife was Dead, told her, what they heard of the matter; upon which she gave her Son's Relations and Friends to know, That forasmuch as the occasion of the difference be∣tween her and him was gone, she would not keep Anger longer. She invited him to come and see her; and the Deed by which he was disinherited being tore, he found ways and means to retain her Friendship, insomuch, that she not only par∣don'd his Marriage, but likewise his abusing of her Credulity, in making her believe that his Wife was Dead.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="232"/>
Madam <HI>Harlai</HI>'s three other Keepers were the Attorney General's Lady, Madam <HI>Harouis,</HI> and Madam <HI>Chateaurenard.</HI> This last was the hand∣somest of all the four, but had not been always so devout as they, for she was mightily taken up in the way of the World: But the disgrace of her Husband's Family, with some other melancho∣ly Circumstances that are not uncommon in the way of Life, oblig'd her to pursue a course that might screen her from all disquiet; so that she became so very pious, that her Piety was a pat∣tern for those who had grown old in the pursuit of it, before ever she thought of such a course of Life. Her Husband was the Son of the late Mr. <HI>Dacquin,</HI> the King's first Physician, who not being satisfied with the Estate he had, occasion'd his own Banishment from the Court, by impor∣tuning the King with unseasonable Requests: Nay, he was so bold, as to represent to His Ma∣jesty, that his Services were at least equal to any that could be done of what nature soever; and in effect, that since his Life was to him the most precious and dear thing in the World, 'twas an obvious consideration, that the person who pre∣serv'd it by his Prescriptions, was not be despis∣ed. Before he ventur'd upon such Discourses, that is, while he observ'd the measures of Respect, due to His Majesty; both he and his Family had a thousand liberal Gifts conferr'd upon 'em. His Majesty had made his Eldest Son Secretary of his own Closet, and an honorary Counsellor of the Parliament, a favour that is not promiscuously granted; and besides all this, he was Intendant of the Generality of <HI>Moulins.</HI> When this Honour was conferr'd upon him, he was scarce twenty five Years old. But immediately upon his Fa∣ther's beginning to talk so high, he was included in his Father's Disgrace, and recall'd. The Name of <HI>Chateaurenard</HI> which he bore, was the Title
<PB N="80" REF="233"/>
of an Estate he bought from Mr. <HI>Amat,</HI> the Son of a famous Farmer of the Revenues. This <HI>Amat,</HI> who scarce understood his Interest so well as his Father, discover'd upon his first imbarking in the World, that Gaming was his only de∣light; and upon that score, several Sharpers Courted him in hopes to have part of the Riches left him by his Father. Among others, an En∣sign of the Life-Guard had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pretty good success; for he won of him a large sum in ready Money, and another upon tick. But that sort of Com∣merce being the King's aversion, and the Ensign being better vers'd in shuffling the Cards, than in unsheathing his Sword for the King's Service; Up∣on these considerations, he was broke when His Majesty purg'd the Companies of their scandalous Members. The above-mentioned Estate belonged formerly to a very good Family of that Name. It had once a Castle upon it that serv'd to over-awe the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> when they were under the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who were the greatest Enemies that ever the Kings of <HI>France</HI> had; notwithstanding that they had the honour to spring from their Blood. The Heir of that Family having done something in opposition to the King's Interest; his Estate was forfeited and reunited to the Royal Demes∣nes. The Family of <HI>Chatillon Coligni,</HI> whose Pos∣sessions were adjacent to that Estate, bought it of the King as lying conveniently for them, and kept it a great many Years, till <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> Married <HI>Louise de Coligni,</HI> the Daughter of Admiral <HI>de Coligni,</HI> who bears so great a Fi∣gure in our History; by which means it pass'd into the House of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and there continued till the Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> the present King of <HI>England</HI>'s Mother, sold it as her Son's Guardian to Mr. <HI>Amat</HI> Farmer of the Revenues. At this day the Arms of the Princes of <HI>Orange</HI> are placed in the most eminent part of the City, if it be allowable to
<PB N="81" REF="234"/>
call a Place a City, that is only a Hole, and that one of the most wretched Holes in the Universe. But let it be as it will, the Inhabitants of that Hole or Town, call it which you will, thinking to ingratiate themselves at Court in the beginning of the last War, by setting forth their hatred of King <HI>William,</HI> intreated the Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> by a Letter, to allow 'em to take down these Arms. But such a Request deserving no Answer, that Minister gave 'em none; and thus were the Arms preserv'd from their mistaken Zeal; so that they stand to this day where they were plac'd an Age ago.</P>
<P>At that time the Bishop of <HI>Dax</HI> Died; and his Death robb'd the publick of his History of the King, which he was carrying on, upon the pre∣cedent of Mr. <HI>Perefixe</HI>'s History of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. He thought it became a Bishop to undertake that sort of performance. But after all, if he had employ'd his time in finishing the History of the Church begun by Mr. <HI>Godeau;</HI> that Province, as I take it, had been more suitable to his Chara∣cter. However, he search'd every corner for the finding of Memoirs to answer his Design. And not long before his Death, I saw him come to one of my Friends, that had belong'd to Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> to know of him, whether the late King of <HI>England</HI> was present at the Negotiation of Peace, carry'd on by that Minister, with <HI>Don Louis de Haro,</HI> in 1659. Upon his departure, my Friend acquainted me with the occasion of his Visit; which was to me a mighty surprisal, for that all the World knows, that <HI>that</HI> Prince would have been there, but that his Eminence would not allow of it. The Reason he went upon, was, That he fear'd the disobliging of <HI>Richard</HI> the Son of <HI>Crom∣wel,</HI> who had been declar'd Protector of <HI>England</HI> after his Father's Death. So that <HI>that</HI> Prince who had advanc'd within six Leagues of the place where
<PB N="82" REF="235"/>
the Conferences were held, was oblig'd to return. My Lord <HI>Bath,</HI> whom he had sent to know if his Presence would be acceptable, receiv'd this Ans∣wer, That 'twas not proper for him to appear there; and that the above-mentioned Minister would still take the same care of his Interest. But had the Prince been so simple as to trust him, and take no other measures, he had been in a fair way of never mounting his Throne. The Bishop I mention'd but now, had resign'd his Bishoprick a great while ago, perhaps in order to have the more leisure to pursue his History: 'Tis probable he thought to out-do <HI>Racine,</HI> or <HI>Boileau;</HI> but I question if he should have succeeded: If his Talent lay that way, I must say that it was a hidden one; for he was never found to be capable of doing much.</P>
<P>Had the Marquis of <HI>Rouville,</HI> who was eighty Years old, died as he did, he had not sustain'd so great a loss, because he had not any History upon the Stocks; but instead of Dying, the old Gen∣tleman acted the part of a very Lively Man, and one that had no mind to die so soon. He com∣menc'd a suit against his Relations, who mean'd to interdict him, under the pretence that he was very old; and having always been an ill Husband, there was no hopes of his growing better in his old days. Had the late Prince been still alive, and sate as his Judge, he had not only given it for his Adversaries, but order'd him to be Impri∣son'd; for he us'd to say, that if there had been two <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>es</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> he would not scruple to leave it for his Life-time. His meaning was, That he was the most troublesome Man in the World: which was also the Opinion of a good many People, who, in imitation of this Prince, did not satisfie themselves with Trifles. He chose ra∣ther the Condition of one of his own Men in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Corner, at <HI>Chantilly,</HI> than to be oblig'd
<PB N="83" REF="236"/>
to hear such an idle Fellow speak; nor did he stand to say, that he was far less uneasie with his Pullets, and the other Creatures that he kept in his Managry, and visited twice a day, than he would be with Men of his Character. Yet it was a strange manner of Occupation for a Prince, so famous for having gain'd so many Battels, and whose very first Essays in War had equal'd the Actions of those that grew old in the Trade. The Enter∣prize of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was still in hand, as well as the design to have the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> chosen King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and the Court was exceeding di∣ligent to bring both the Affairs to a happy Issue. The one was, indeed, more easier than the other, tho' both appeared very hard; at least, there was some reason to judge the latter more easie than the former, because all they had to do, was, to spare no money to make it succeed; they were only to gain the Votes of those who are always for the highest Bidder; for as that is the Harvest of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who reap nothing when they have a King upon the Throne; so it is long since they own'd their resemblance of the <HI>Swiss,</HI> in regard nothing is to be done with them without money. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had sent thither already two hundred thousand Crowns of his own, and the King for his part, who would have reap'd a great advantage, by obtaining that Crown for the Prince, sent fourtimes as much. Abbot <HI>Polignac,</HI> the King's Ambassador at that Court, distributed the money amongst those he had engag'd in his Party, and taking that Election to depend intirely upon Cardinal <HI>Radzionwski,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Gnesne,</HI> who by virtue of this last Dignity, was Prince and Regent of the Kingdom, during the va∣cancy of the Throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lavish'd his money upon him, while he thought it sufficient to feed others with fine Promises. But the Generals of the Ar∣my of the Crown, and the <HI>Lithua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI> Troops,
<PB N="84" REF="237"/>
who were equally sharp set with the Cardinal, did not find their Account in that sort of manage∣ment; neither were the <HI>Palatines</HI> satisfied, foras∣much as they thought their Swords deserv'd to be considered no less than the Cardinal's Mitre. Ab∣bot <HI>Polignac</HI> had disguis'd his Project for a long time, and made the Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> be∣lieve, that the King, his Master, had only put up the Prince of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nti</HI> by way of Provision, in case there were no other in whom he could confide. Be∣sides that, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was very-indiffer∣ent upon the matter; and if he consented to it, 'twas rather to please the King, than to gratifie his Inclination. So far he said well; and that Prince who was passionately fond of <HI>France,</HI> was afraid of nothing more, than to hear that he was elected King of <HI>Poland.</HI> But as for His Majesty, he was of another mind, for he desir'd nothing more earnestly than to see the Crown upon that Prince's Head, by reason of the advantage he ex∣pected from thence. The Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> being, like most people, easily perswaded to believe what she wish'd gave credit to the insinuations of Abbot <HI>Polignac.</HI> She took a great deal of pains to justifie to him her Conduct, in what she had done for several Years against the King's Interest; and gave him to know, that His Majesty had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d her to it by his ill usage; and that when∣ever His Majesty pleas'd to alter his measur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with reference to her, she would really shew, that she d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r'd nothing more than the restoring of the good understanding that had been betwixt the two Crowns in the beginning of the Reign of the King her late Husband. She continued to repre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt, That i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His Majesty would vouchsafe his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ction to Prince <HI>James</HI> her Son, whom she mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to prefer to the Throne, as soon as he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vd at that Dignity, he should do every thing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with His Majesty's pleasure; and
<PB N="85" REF="238"/>
that His Majesty ought not to fear that the Al∣liance he had concluded with a suspected Family, would oblige him to counteract his Interest; that he knew well, that Princes have but little regard for their Wive's Relations, at a time when either their Glory or Grandure are in view; and that her Son would continue in an inseparable U∣nion with his Crown, insomuch that he would put the Service of His Majesty upon the same ballance with his own.</P>
<P>These words were very acceptable to the Ab∣bot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> who knew, that a Reconciliation between two Parties is the more sincere, when both sides are eager in justifying their past Con∣duct. Nay, he pretended to have some sense of the justness of her Complaints against the King, in order to insinuate himself more effectually in∣to her Breast. In fine, he agreed with her to transfer all the Votes for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to her Son; and upon that consideration she pro∣mis'd to use her utmost efforts in taking off <HI>Sapi∣eha,</HI> great General of <HI>Lith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ania,</HI> from the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> the Interest of which he seem'd to espouse very warmly. <HI>Sapieha</HI> was extream powerful in that Dutchy, and was rather Master than General of it, possessing vast Territories, and great Char∣ges in it, which was the reason that every one trembled under him. The Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> had no other design in it, but to weaken the party of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> flattering himself with the Thoughts, that Prince <HI>James</HI> his Party would ne∣ver be able to make Head against his own; for he was very far from thinking to keep his word to the Queen, and all he said to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, was only to the end he might the more easily deceive her. Nevertheless she was so credulous, that to assure him the better of the Confidence she had in him, she sent him her Picture, which he seem'd to have desir'd very earnestly. He set it up in the most con∣spicuous
<PB N="86" REF="239"/>
place of his Chamber, to make her the better believe how much he esteem'd it. However, that Princess acted nothing but in concert with him. She endeavour'd to take off <HI>Sapieha</HI> from the House of <HI>Austria. Sapieha</HI> did not deceive her in the least. He told her freely, That he was so engag'd in the Interest of that Family, that there was but one thing that could oblige him to quit it, and that was, to have the Crown set upon his own Head, and that it was in her power to con∣tribute to it, if she pleas'd: That she should only joyn her Interest, with that he could make for him∣self; which if she pleas'd to consent to, he would in∣fallibly set her upon the Throne with him; for that he being a Widdower and she a Widdow, no∣thing could hinder them from Marrying. The Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> however earnest she was to Reign, did not at all relish that Proposal. She knew <HI>Sapieha</HI>'s Spirit, who tho' he would have kept his Promise to her, yet would hardly have allow'd her the very shadow of the Kingly Power, while he himself would manage the whole with∣out Controul. She had had already two Hus∣bands, over whom she had always a great ascen∣dant, and now she did not pretend to degenerate in the least from what she had always been, tho' she was passed the time of inspiring any new Flames.</P>
<P>The House of <HI>Austria,</HI> in imitation of that of <HI>France,</HI> caus'd the Ministers which they had at that Court, to act so secretly, that it was impossible, even for the most clear sighted, to pry into their Con∣duct. There was hardly any one who did not be∣lieve that their design was to advance Prince <HI>James</HI> to the Throne. The honour▪ he had in being Brother-in-Law to the Emperor and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> confirm'd them in their Thoughts. However, that House had quite a different in∣clination. They mistrusted the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="240"/>
whose Actions they were no strangers to, and knowing that she had sent Money into <HI>France,</HI> they look'd upon her as a Woman that had been always inclin'd that way. They knew that the <HI>French</HI> have always a secret inclination for their Country, which never dies but with their last Breath. Besides, they knew that Princess had a certain ascendant over her Son, that would assure her of the Reins of the Government, if ever they set the Crown upon his Head. However, all these Reasons were more than sufficient to oblige the Emperor and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to prefer their own Interests, to that of their Brother-in-Law, who was a Prince upon whom they could not rely very much; for he was far short of the quali∣ties of the King his Father. They cast their Eyes upon a Person very worthy of that Crown. The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> a young Prince, who had di∣stinguished himself to a great degree in the Wars the Emperor had against the Infidels, and whom he had set at the Head of his Army, seem'd to both of them to be the Man. His Imperial Ma∣jesty labour'd to remove a difficulty that oppos'd their design. The Duke was of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion, and ever in some measure considered as the head of all that Party, because it was one of his Ancestors that afforded a Retreat to <HI>Lu∣ther,</HI> and who, after having embrac'd his Doctrine, undertook also his protection against the Emperor, who pretended to have him punished, because he dar'd to Preach a New Religion. It is truly astoni∣shing, why his Imperial Majesty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> would not rather endeavour to chuse the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who was Son-in-Law to the one, and Nephew to the other, he being also a Catholick, which was a necessary Quality for the King of <HI>Po∣land:</HI> Besides, he was much Richer than the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and that is no mean quality to be considered in a design of that Nature: But
<PB N="88" REF="241"/>
whether that Elector was altogether indifferen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or whether the two Princes judged it necessary to continue him in the Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> they fix'd intirely upon the other Duke. The Emper∣or propos'd the matter to him, and told him, that it should only be long of his Religion, if the Affair did not succeed▪ The Duke found the thing of too great a Consequence to determine sud∣denly. However charming the proposition was; he consider'd the Condition they annexed to it was too weighty for him. He demanded some time to give his Answer; and the Emperor judg∣ed, that because he listned already, all would have a favourable Issue if he press'd him never so little. He began to infinuate to him, that both the first <HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> had always believ'd, that one might as well be sav'd in the Catholick Religion, as in Theirs; and that the Crown they propos'd to him, was certainly well worth all the trouble they asked of him; and at the same time made him converse with a num∣ber of Doctors, that pushed the Affair a great deal further, and alledg'd a great many Reasons to prove, that the Catholick Religion was the on∣ly true Religion, and that which had been always profess'd in the Church.</P>
<P>The Bright lustre of the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> made the Duke relish their admirable Reasons; and some Ministers who conferr'd before him with these Doctors (tho' neither the one nor the other knew to what purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all this was doing) a∣greed, that according to the Explication the Ca∣tholicks make now adays of their Faith, it was void of all manner of Venom; so that the Duke was more than half perswaded to go all the length they desir'd of him. The Catholick Do∣ctors hearing the Ministers speak after that man∣ner, That the Prince might harbour no further scruple in his mind, alledg'd, that nonehad ever
<PB N="89" REF="242"/>
explain'd their Faith after any other manner than what they do at present, excepting some sort of People that were glad to make others believe some different Thing; that one might only read the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> to know the truth of it; and that all those of their Religion had no other Doctrine, than such as was taught there. The Duke was glad that they prepared for him the way he desir'd; being inform'd by the Em∣peror, that his Intrigues in <HI>Poland</HI> were so strong∣ly laid, that his Enemies would find it hard to overturn them. There was nothing that diswad∣ed him so much from making a profession of that Religion, as the fear that his hopes would prove abortive. Accordingly, being a Man of precaution, he promis'd to the Emperor to per∣form all they desir'd of him, upon the proviso of the certainty of his Election: Now, this as∣surance that he demanded, was a very difficult Point, because it depended upon the Votes of a great many People that were capable of falsify∣ing their words. The very Bishop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> tho' he headed the Interest of the House of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> shew'd no great resolution in determining who he should Vote for, notwithstanding he had already taken of his Money. He design'd to make use of that Election as a means to make him∣self a Cardinal; and was sensible; that whatso∣ever side was prefer'd, he would meet with invinci∣ble Obstacsle to his pretensions. The Bishop of <HI>Passaw</HI> waited only to see the Emperor's Success, in order to make a Proposal for the succession to that Crown. He being Brother to the Empress, the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia</HI> was convinc'd that he would be too hard for him; and that upon that score the same thing would be said to him, that upon the like occasion was formerly said to the Coadjutor of <HI>Paris.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> had formerly promis'd to invest him with the Purple, upon the proviso of some things that were mutually concerted;
<PB N="90" REF="243"/>
but he forfeited this promise, the Cardinal desir'd the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to procure the nomination of another. The Bishop of <HI>Cuja∣via</HI> fearing, and that very justly, that the same thing might happen to him, would glad∣ly have gone over to the <HI>French</HI> side, if he had not been jealous of the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> whom he took to be of such a Temper, as not to give up the pretentions he equally made to the Cardinal's Cap. In this quandary he caus'd some to feel his Pulse, to try if he would quit his Preten∣tions; but the Abbot being as fond of the prefer∣ment as he, thought his request very indiscreet, and neglected the King's Interest in carrying on his own. In effect, had he resign'd his Pretentions to this Prelate, he had, by that means, joyn'd the Prelate's Interest to his own, and had certain∣ly procur'd the Election of the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> But he fancied, that by the Primat's Assistance, and by the help of some Money he still expect∣ed from <HI>France,</HI> he would compass his design without him.</P>
<P>The Bishop perceiving how confident he was of his good Success, since he despis'd his Of∣fers, which any other would have valued at a far higher rate than what he demanded of him, endeavour'd to cast in some difference betwixt Him and the Queen of <HI>Poland.</HI> He caus'd in∣form that Princess, that she would be extream∣ly impos'd upon, if she rely'd upon his Promises, and advis'd her to have some better security of him, than his word, unless she had a mind to leave room for a future Repentance. The Queen, who was naturally suspicious, resolved to make her advantage of this advice; and that she might have the more confidence in <HI>Polignac's</HI> Expres∣sions, she desir'd that he might procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for her the King's Letter, by which she might be as∣sur'd of what his Majesty was pleas'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quaint
<PB N="91" REF="244"/>
her by his Ambassador. The Abbot put her in hopes of it, designing to elude her, whenever she urg'd him too close to make good his Promise. In the mean time he wrote to <HI>France,</HI> that Af∣fairs went fairly for the Prince of <HI>Conti:</HI> But if they design'd to make the success not only proba∣ble, but infallible, they should not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to send him a considerable sum of Money. The Court of <HI>France</HI> was never in greater necessity than at that time; having resolv'd to attack <HI>Barcelona,</HI> they were equipping a strong Fleet in <HI>Provence,</HI> that put them to a vast Expence: Besides, they were considerably exhausted to procure a Peace from their Enemies, that at that time was so necessary to them; all their Provinces were ruin'd by the War; and tho' other States were hardly in better Circumstances, yet they were affraid, that the Subjects would scarce be any longer capable of bearing so heavy a Charge.</P>
<P>They had been a long time resolv'd (as is al∣ready mention'd) upon the design of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> in hopes that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who alone with the Emperor oppos'd the Peace, would change their Sentiments, when they saw themselves attack'd even in the very Bowels. For tho' that place, be upon the Frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> yet there be∣ing only two or three places of strength betwixt it and <HI>Madrid,</HI> it was not doubted, but that Conquest would Alarm them much more than the loss of four better places in <HI>Flanders.</HI> But af∣ter all, tho' these Reasons pleaded for carrying on the attack without any delay, it was never∣theless put off for some time upon important Considerations. The very Inhabitants of <HI>Marseil∣les</HI> oppos'd it's Bombardment, in regard they had a great many effects in it, which would have been lost, if it had been reduc'd to Ashes. They made a considerable Present to the Court, to procure a due regard to their Interest: But at last, all the
<PB N="92" REF="245"/>
Considerations that retarded the Seige, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being taken away, it was discours'd on more warmly than ever.</P>
<P>This Enterprize could not be carried on with∣out a great deal of Charge, as I intimated before; but the Court that is seldom sensible of the pub∣lick miseries, and had a Minister that found the Mistery, to raise as much Money as they pleas'd without overcharging the People, thought that this ought not to hinder them from bringing their E∣nemies to a Compliance. In effect, the Provinces were rather miserable, because they wanted Hands to labour the Ground, than that they were over∣charg'd by exorbitant Imposts: So that His Ma∣jesty, who was still full of Money, notwithstand∣ing all these immense Expences, thought fit to satisfie the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> in regard that he assur'd them, there was nothing else wanting to make all have a prosperous Success: So that he sent him not only the sum he desir'd, but four hundred thousand Livers over and above; that if he came to fail in his Negotiation, he should not blame an unseasonable Parcimony. The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> seeing him receive so large re∣mittances, and distribute them according to the Cardinal's Advice; found him very remote from her Interest, and began to be extream jealous of his Conduct. She had reason to suspect, that he only thought to amuse her; and as the esteem they had of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> in that King∣dom, was far superior to that they had for Prince <HI>James</HI> her Son, she began to press the Abbot up∣on the assurances of his Promise. He shifted it, by telling her sometimes, that the King being now ready to begin the Campaign, had no time to think of any thing else; at other times, that the King expected that if he brought over to the party of Prince <HI>James,</HI> the Voices he had gain'd for the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> she would be pleas'd to repay
<PB N="63" REF="246"/>
him the Money he had sent into that Country, for making the Party.</P>
<P>The Queen's Council could hardly blame so just an offer, but distrusting that it was only a pretence of the Ambassador's to delay Affairs, advis'd the Queen to yield to him in that Article; for if he meant to be ingenuous, the Prince her Son could never fail of the Crown. The Queen be∣lieved her Council; and she herself communicated it to the Abbot; but that Ambassador being now at a loss what to Answer, thought fit to propose to her something concerning his own particular Interest. He told her, that during the life of the King her Husband, he had the promise of the Court, that if he got the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to be chosen King, he should allow him to name whom he pleas∣ed for the Cardinal Dignity; that he expected she would be pleas'd to stipulate the same thing with her Son, that all his pains migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be fruitless; That there were some Prelats in her Son's Interest, who had the same pretentions, in case he were chosen King, and that he desir'd they might resign in his favour: That Her Majesty ought not to take it ill, that he should require this of her; for perhaps in his Lifetime he should not have so fa∣vourable an opportunity to arrive to that honour∣able Dignity.</P>
<P>As soon as the Queen's Council heard him talk af∣ter that manner, they were the more confirmed in their Sentiments of him: However, to cut off all opportunities to make use of that difficulty, they us'd their Interest with the Prelats that were of Prince <HI>James</HI> his Party, to resign what the Abbot desir'd; which they did in consideration of the pro∣mises the Queen had made to them; and that Princess acquainting the Ambassador with it, he pretended all went well; and that all that remain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e done now, was, to reimburse the sums he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advanced, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he had the Accounts readvly
<PB N="94" REF="247"/>
by him: Now He had not propos'd that as to be done presently; all he desir'd before, was, That when Prince <HI>James</HI> should be chosen, the Queen and He should be oblig'd to make that Restitution. So all that were in the Interest of the Queen, finding that he had only altered his Conduct, the better to amuse her, judged it expedient, that Her Majesty should not only break off all measures with him, but do it also very openly. Their Reason was, That as <HI>France</HI> had it's Enemies as well as Partisans, the secret Union which they suspected she entertained with him, hindred those who had openly declar∣ed themselves against <HI>France,</HI> to imbrace her In∣terest. The Queen believ'd them, and after once sounding the Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> touching his last Resolution, she made him sensible, That she was no more of an humour to be amus'd. She wrote a Letter also to the Marchioness of <HI>Bethu∣nes,</HI> to be deliver'd to his most Christian Majesty. In it she complains of the Abbot's disengenuity; and how uselesly he lavish'd the King's Money; for however powerful he believ'd his Interest, it was no ways capable to equal that of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> except they joyn'd it with hers. This Marchioness was Sister to the Queen, and both of them were Daughters to the Marquis of <HI>Ar∣quien,</HI> who was Captain of the Duke of <HI>Orlean</HI>'s hundred <HI>Swiss,</HI> and afterwards Cardinal, by the Nomination of the late King of <HI>Poland.</HI> The late Princess <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Gonsague,</HI> had carried that Queen with her into <HI>Poland,</HI> when she her∣self went thither in the same quality, being Married to <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> who then possess'd that Crown. She had taken her for one of her Maids of Ho∣nour; and the Prince <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> falling in Love with her, as well as <HI>Sobiesky,</HI> who was after∣wards her Husband, the Queen declar'd herself in favour of the first, because he was by far the greater Prince of the two. In the mean time <HI>Lu∣bomirsky</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="248"/>
dying a little after, and the Affairs of that Country proving unfavourable for <HI>Casimir, Ladislaus</HI> his Brother, who was chosen King after <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> and had moreover Married his Wid∣dow, Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> knowing that <HI>Sobiesky</HI> con∣tinued always his Affection for Princess <HI>Lubomir∣sky,</HI> promis'd to procure her for him in Marriage, if he would declare himself for the King her Hus∣band: Which he did, and as he had already gain'd a great Reputation in that Kingdom, his declaring himself was of vast advantage to <HI>Casimir.</HI> How∣ever, after a great many different Accidents that are foreign to my Subject, <HI>Casimir</HI> dying without Issue as well as King <HI>Ladislaus</HI> his Brother, and a <HI>French</HI> Prince making interest for the Crown, as well as the present Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> his Father; the Bishop of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> who was Ambassador for <HI>France</HI> in that Country, seeing it go cross to the Interest of the Person whom his Master pro∣pos'd, chang'd his Conduct very dexterously, and told the <HI>Dyet,</HI> That it was none of their busi∣ness to Court their Neighbours, for what they might easily find among themselves, provided they were satisfied with it; That <HI>John So∣biesky</HI> was a person very worthy of their Crown, who would govern them with all the pru∣dence and satisfaction that it was possible for any other Prince to do. <HI>Sobiesky</HI> had beat the <HI>Turks</HI> in many Rencounters; and even very lately had rescued the Republick from imminent Danger by a glorious Victory: So that his fresh Services pleading more in his favour than it was possible for the Ambassador of <HI>France</HI> to do, He was chosen King, notwithstanding a former Decree of the Republick, by which they excluded their own Subjects from the Crown.</P>
<P>By these means the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> of an or∣dinary <HI>French</HI> Girl, became Queen. However, tho' her Birth ought to have oblig'd her to all
<PB N="96" REF="249"/>
the Respect imaginable for the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> under whose Government she had drawn her first Breath, yet she very soon forgot it, because His most Christian Majesty would not comply with all her desires. The Marquis of <HI>Vitry,</HI> Ambassador of <HI>France,</HI> at that Court, in the King her Hus∣band's time, pass'd his time there very uneasily; and he miss'd been assassinated very narrowly, be∣cause she suspected him to be the cause of all the Displeasure she received from the Court of <HI>France.</HI> The King, who made use of the Prince her Husband, as a check over the Emperour and Empire, was oblig'd to conceal his Resentment of that Princess her Conduct. Matters were better adjusted by the moderation and prudence of His most Christian Majesty, and by the secret Re∣flections that Princess might have had of her in∣justice to a Prince worthy to govern the Universe. But as it is impossible always to dissemble ones Sentiments, she soon made the breach between Her and His Majesty wider than ever: For being by the Divine Goodness rais'd to so high a Dig∣nity, it vex'd her extreamly, that her Father had no mark of Distinction in his Court: She therefore intreated the King to create him Duke and Peet. The Marquis of <HI>Arquien,</HI> was a person abandon'd to his Pleasures, and became so far a slave to them, that tho' he was advanc'd to a great Age, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Wise, but plung'd into Debau∣cheries that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extreamly upon the honour of his Daughter and gain'd no Reputation to him∣self, either as Father-in-Law to a great King, or as a Man of Quality. He avowedly kept his Miss, whom he allowed to go by his Name; for she was known by no other, than by that of <HI>Louison D' Arquien;</HI> and that coming often to His Maiesty's Ear, he thought it not very convenient to grant the Queen the Dignity she demanded for her Fa∣ther</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="250"/>
That Repulse was resented with all the Malice Woman is capable of; she obliged the King, her Husband, to discontinue all secret Intelligence with His Majesty; and as the Emperor, at that time, was engaged in a Bloody War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> she incessantly importuned him, until he had concluded an Offensive and Defensive League with His <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty. The Almighty brought all that to pass for the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> had Besieged; and beyond all perad∣venture, had also been taken, had not His <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty come to Relieve it. However, so lively and impatient a Princess, could not but shew her resentment much more to the Abbot of <HI>Po∣lignac,</HI> because the present Affair was of far grea∣ter consequence, than any thing that had passed for∣merly; and the World saw, by the violence of her Resentment, that she would continue it all her Life. She sent to him to have her Picture again; and because he refused to restore it, thinking still to amuse her, she immediately sent the same Per∣son, that had formerly spoke to him, to let him know, That if he would not restore it in a friend∣ly manner, she would oblige him to do it by force. The Ambassador, who was sensible how she had treated the Marquis of <HI>Vitry,</HI> would not run the risque of a second refusal He returned her Pi∣cture; and seeing the Queen had broke off all measures with him, he observed none with her, but what her Sex and Dignity obliged him to. In the mean time, he distributed some small Money he had received, among the Commanders of the Army of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and of that of <HI>Lithuania.</HI> They thought it convenient to refuse it; but as all he gave them was not capable to satisfie their hungry Appetites, so they were not the more oblig'd by it, to comply with his Design.</P>
<P>An Officer of the Army of the Crown, who was the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI>'s Subject, having
<PB N="98" REF="251"/>
heard even those who received the Money, vent their Railleries, resolv'd to come and acquaint His Majesty of it at <HI>Versailles,</HI> believing the King would certainly reward him liberally; so quitting his Charge, and leaving that Country expresly, he passed through all <HI>Germany,</HI> and arriving in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> came to the Marshal <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffler</HI>'s Army, upon the Frontiers of the <HI>Spanish Flanders.</HI> The Officer of the main Guard having stopped him, was inform'd by him, who he was, whence he came, and in some measure, of the nature of his Business; and sent him to the Marshal, to acquaint him of what he was not willing to declare there. This Stranger did not know one Word of <HI>French;</HI> but as he spoke <HI>Latin</HI> to perfection, he made the General easily understand, That he came from <HI>Po∣land,</HI> and that he had Affairs of moment, relating to that Country; and this is all he would tell him, as if the Marshal had not been worthy of his Secret. The General seeing a Person of an ill mein, that pleaded nothing in his favour, but ra∣ther gave him an ill opinion of him, was like to cause him to be taken up; but considering he would do better to send him under a sure Guard to Court, he put him into the hands of an Officer, whom he order'd to take two or three Troopers for his <HI>Escorte.</HI></P>
<P>The Officer went along with him to <HI>Versailles,</HI> where this Man was reputed a Spy, as soon as he offer'd to speak: For after what the Abbot of <HI>Po∣lignac</HI> had Wrote to them, they were fully per∣swaded, that the Affairs of the Prince of <HI>Conty</HI> went as well as they could wish in that Country; they would not believe a tittle of what he alledg'd, it being quite contrary to <HI>Polignac</HI>'s Relation. He told the Secretary of State, to whom the Marshal had sent him, That they were highly mistaken, if they believ'd, that the <HI>Poles</HI> would ever chuse that Prince for their King. They ask'd him the
<PB N="99" REF="252"/>
reason; but he not being able to produce any o∣ther than that I mention'd but now, it was reck∣on'd so bad a one, that he was immediately sent to Prison. They were resolv'd to draw up an In∣dictment against him; but Mons. <HI>D'Argenson,</HI> who was employ'd to Try him, being a Man full of Justice and Equity, had no sooner examin'd him, but he found it plain, that all his Crime consisted in having thought to make his Fortune, by bring∣ing this News. He reported the same thing to the Court; and the Process against this pretended Criminal, consisting only of an Interrogatory or two, it was dropt, till they saw how the Election of <HI>Poland</HI> would go.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> thought it convenient, in the mean time, to make a faint show of the Catho∣lick Religion, without having the least inclination to it. He saw that it was absolutely necessary for obtaining the Crown of <HI>Poland:</HI> so having brought over to his Interest a Bishop of his own Family, that was of that Religion; this Prelate, at the Emperor's sollicitation, gave him a Certificate, That he had privately Abjured <HI>Lutheranism.</HI> This they shewed secretly to the <HI>Palatines</HI> that were in the <HI>Austrian</HI> Party, who seem'd to have no other view in Corresponding with it, than to advance Prince <HI>James</HI>'s Election: At least, the World be∣liev'd so, and <HI>France</HI> was of that opinion, so that they did not dream that ever that Elector had thought in the least of the Crown. The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> was impos'd upon, as well as others; the <HI>Palatines</HI> delay'd Affairs on purpose, that they might be more courted, and have the opportunity of filling their Purses. The Elector was obliged to borrow Money from all hands, to forward his Interest. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> lent him considerable Sums upon a Mortgage of the <HI>Baillages</HI> that lay convenient for him. He like∣wise rais'd immense Sums in his own Dominions,
<PB N="100" REF="253"/>
upon the pretence that being in the Emperor's Ser∣vice, he wanted the assistance of his own People, be∣cause it was not possible for the Emperor to pay the Subsidies they had agreed upon. Moreover, instead of making his Correspondence with the Duke of <HI>Erandenburg</HI> to appear, he feign'd he was at variance with him, upon the account of the Domains that both of them had upon the Confines of <HI>Poland;</HI> and accordingly, both of them march'd thither their Troops, as if they design'd imme∣diately to come to a Rupture. <HI>France</HI> that had too many Enemies to deal with, to be indifferent in desiring to get rid of at least some part of 'em, was catch'd as well in this Snare, as in the former. They were willing to believe, that this would not fail to make a powerful diversion in their favour; and as it was impossible for some part of the <HI>German</HI> Princes to be meer Spectators in the Dif∣ferences of these two Princes, so they expected a considerable ease upon each side.</P>
<P>The march of these Troops was very cunning∣ly contriv'd, and disprov'd with a witness, what had been publish'd a while ago, to the disadvan∣tage of the <HI>House of Austria.</HI> Some would have it, that for many Years together that Family had been always Trick'd by <HI>France;</HI> and that by ob∣serving only their ordinary Course, as if there had been none else more ready and sure to for∣ward their Designs, they had so degenerated from the Wisdom and Greatness of <HI>Charles</HI> V. that all <HI>Europe</HI> had forgot them; but as they manag'd this Intrigue, that was contriv'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> they were overjoy'd to know that <HI>France</HI> had lost its Preten∣sions to the <HI>Title.</HI></P>
<P>While these considerable Affairs were transact∣ing in <HI>Poland,</HI> some other Matters pass'd in <HI>France</HI> of less consequence for the State, but in which some particular Persons found themselves more interress'd. <HI>Paris,</HI> that had furnish'd the Scene for
<PB N="101" REF="254"/>
that Lady, who had met with so ill usage from her own Domesticks, afforded also the following, which is extraordinary enough to plead for some place in these Annals. It appear'd to me so uncommon, that I doubted for a long time, whether I should insert it. I was sensible, that among so many certain Things as I here present you with, I ought not to run the risque of Writing any that I have rea∣son to suspect: In fine, this Matter has been con∣firm'd to me by so many Hands, that if I be de∣ceiv'd, it must be, because they took pleasure to impose upon me. I receiv'd six different Letters from <HI>Paris,</HI> that contain'd the same thing; so that, after all the Precautions I us'd, I suppose, that however extraordinary the Matter appears, it may be credited, after the enquiry I have made in it. In effect, if we should doubt of all the surprizing Things <HI>Paris</HI> affords, we must ne∣cessarily doubt of all that happens there; for every Day produces such Accidents, as one would hardly believe without infallible Testi∣mony.</P>
<P>A Girl was forc'd to profess, by the uncon∣trolable Will of Parents, who by this means meant to take her off from the Inclinations she had for a Person, they would not have her Marry; notwithstanding she was shut up, she always con∣tinu'd a Respect for him, that troubled her ex∣treamly, in the exercises of her new Profession. Her Lover, for his part, could never forget her; but having seen her put on the Habit, he ought to have laid aside all hopes of ever enjoying her. Yet being always tormented with his Passion, which was so much the more violent, that while the Young Nun continu'd in the way of the World, she gave him all the demonstrations of her Esteem that he could reasonably desire; he robb'd his Father (a Rich Merchant) of Twenty thousand Livres in Gold, Cloath'd himself in a Girl's Habit, and went
<PB N="102" REF="255"/>
to the Convent where she was, after having hid himself for a whole Month in the City, pretend∣ing to be Sick. His first Compliment to the Con∣vent was, That he was resolv'd to become a Nun. He told 'em, he was come from the Country, and was the Daughter of Parents that had made a considerable Estate by Trafficking; and having shew'd his Trea∣sure to these Nuns, it secur'd him more in their esteem, than any Profession whatsoever.</P>
<P>So extream desirous were they to have it, that they easily dispenc'd with inquiring any farther after the place of her Nativity, or what Faults this disguis'd Girl might be liable to in her Youth. They were satisfy'd, for that she promised them the whole, provided they would Maintain her while she Liv'd. However, she told them, that they might not think she was ill natur'd, That if she meant to let them have the whole Sum, it was, because she had no Relations in <HI>France;</HI> That her Father and Mother, who had come thither, were origi∣nally <HI>English.</HI> And thus having told them a thousand pretty Stories, at length she concluded, That she was a poor Orphan, and would be very glad to lay out her Money to the best advantage; or at least, to secure herself from the Miseries of Neces∣sity.</P>
<P>This Relation of the pretended Orphan appear'd so ingenuous to the Hungry Nuns, that they re∣solv'd to receive her into their Cloyster, without troubling themselves with any farther inquiry into her Circumstances, than what their Eyes could afford them into the goodness of her Coin. How∣ever, there arose a little difficulty betwixt the Parties; for the Nuns desir'd to have the Money presently deliver'd up to them, or at least, when she assum'd the Habit; but she, for her part, pre∣tended only to do it when she Profess'd; tho' she meant never to do it; for she design'd her Mony for some other use than what the Nuns had ever
<PB N="103" REF="256"/>
thought of: And to that purpose told them, That she could not be satisfy'd, whether their Rules and manner of Life would suit with her Temper, and till she was fully assured of that, they ought to demand no other Conditions of her, but that of paying handsomly for her Board, which she would never scruple to do; that in the mean time, she would put out her Money to Interest, which would fall to them in course, whenever she had assum'd the Profession; but that she intended to secure herself before she was stripped of her Money. She de∣manded nothing but what was just; and besides, threaten'd to find out some other place, if they re∣fused any longer to accept of her Conditions. Being afraid to slip the opportunity, they agreed with her upon her own Terms. So, this preten∣ded young Gentlewoman, having put on the White Vail, in a few days, bestow'd so Li∣berally upon her Habit, as if Money had cost her nothing. All the Nuns were wonderfully edified by her generosity, only her Mistress, in the midst of all their Joy for so rich a Prize, continued still in her wonted indisposition, as if she had been altogether mortify'd. The resem∣blance she found between herself and her Spark, open'd her Wounds afresh, that were still too tender, not to be sensible of any thing that touched them.</P>
<P>The Scene being thus over, The Novice be∣gan soon to accost the Lady that oblig'd him to dissemble his Sex. But being unwilling to entertain her in the Torment she was in, she told her all of a sudden, what <HI>Love</HI> had forced her to do; she added moreover, That she was fully resolv'd to Starve herself, if she would shew her no Compassion; That she was cer∣tainly inform'd, she had assum'd the Profession against her Inclination; and if she had yet any sense of the passion she had for her, while with her Parents, she had no reason to doubt, but the
<PB N="104" REF="257"/>
recent Testimony she now gave her, would en∣gage her to enter into all the measures she would advise her; That she had fallen upon this Inven∣tion, not to rob her of her Honour, but to restore her to to the tranquility she had lost, and to re∣cover her own also; That she could enjoy no more after she had enter'd into the Convent; That she wanted not Money to carry them thorow, in exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctation of a better Fortune; and tho' the Sum was not of great importance, yet she kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w how to manage it to that advantage, as would se∣cure them from the Injuries of Necessity; That she was fully resolv'd to Marry her, if she pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; That it was certain her Vows were of no force, since she was compell'd to them, and so it depended in∣tirely upon herself, to be freed from her present Captivity, since it was not possible for her to be happy without her; That neither of them ought to regard the meanness of the Present she offer'd her now, in comparison of what both of them could have reasonably expected, if Love had not embroil'd them with their Parents; That she would endeavour to be at ease without them, and of∣tentimes there was more satisfaction in a middle ordinary F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtune, than in a sumptuous one; That great R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches are always attended with great Cares, and provided that a Husband and Wife, who love one another tenderly, be out of the reach of Necessity, they may be indifferent for other Super∣fluities.</P>
<P>The Nun found this way of reasoning very perti∣nent▪ it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing altogether conformable to her own Sense and Inclination. She agreed with her Lover in all things. They pass'd three Months in this In∣trigue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doing nothing but what became the strictest Honour, the there might have been some incroach∣ments upon Decercy. The Novice feign'd her∣self Sick alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging, (after they had asked her a great many times, What she ail'd) That her Sick∣ness
<PB N="105" REF="258"/>
proceeded only from the Austerity of the Convent, which she could never be able to go through. The Discreet Mothers were a little vexed to hear her speak after that rate, forseeing that the twenty thousand Livers they had rely'd upon, would slip out of their Fingers; but there being no remedy, they were fain to restore to her her tem∣poral Habit, and give her her Pass. She present∣ly took up her Money, and gave it to the Ban∣kers for Bills of Exchange upon <HI>Italy,</HI> where she was resolved to pass her time, as soon as she made sure of her <HI>Mistress.</HI> Having mutually adjusted all things; the Night be∣fore they put their Plot in Execution, the Nun uninter'd a Sister that had been just Buried, carried her to her Bed, and having set Fire to it, made her escape into the Garden of the Con∣vent, where her Spark had fastned a Ladder of Cords to a certain place of the Wall they had condescended upon. He waited for her at the other side with a Coach, and receiving her into it, while the whole Convent was in an uproar about the Fire, carried her to a Lodging he had intirely at his command.</P>
<P>The poor Nuns had much to do to quench the Fire that frighted them extreamly, for fear of having their whole Convent destroyed by it. However, having mastered it at length, tho' with a considerable loss, they all of them run immedi∣ately to the Chamber where the Fire first began, and being extreamly troubled that she did not appear, they doubted not in the least but she had perished in the Flames. They were soon con∣firm'd in the certainty of their belief, when they found the remnants of a dead Body in the ruins of that Chamber, thinking really the rest had been consumed by the Fire. Nothing was heard but Grief and Lamentation upon all hands; some re∣hearsing the praises of the dead Nun, whom they
<PB N="106" REF="259"/>
thought they could never lament sufficiently. O∣thers who were as much interess'd as compassio∣nate, griev'd more for the loss of the House, than of the Dead; and while they amused them∣selves with these or such like Reflections, not one of them dream'd of what had happen'd; but the most probable thing they said, was, That her Pa∣rents when acquainted with her unhappy Disaster, must needs Censure themselves, in regard they had forced her to assume the Profession against her Inclination.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the two Lovers escap'd into <HI>Italy,</HI> pursuant to their design: There they were Marry'd, having met with a Priest to their Mind; or one perhaps so tender of their Interest, as to ease a poor Girl of her Vows, without giving her the trouble of applying herself to any other Authority, than his own. The young Husband applied himself to Traffick, in which he was so fortunate, as in twenty Years time, to make a considerable Estate. In that time, Providence blessed him with a numerous Off spring; but at length he died in the five and fortieth Year of his Age. The Lady, who was much about the same Age, notwithstanding the tender Love and Prosperity of her Husband, being still frighted with a check of Conscience, resolv'd upon a Journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> to obtain the <HI>Holy-Father</HI>'s Absolution for what she had done. The <HI>Pope</HI> refused it abso∣lutely, without she promised faithfully to return to the Convent. She was extreamly unwilling to comply, in regard of the tender Affection she had for her Children. In fine, preferring the tran∣quility of her Conscience to every thing, she conquer'd all obstacles that would have hindred her, and promis'd His <HI>Holiness</HI> to obey his Com∣mand: She had a favourable Passage by Sea into <HI>France,</HI> together with her whole Family, which she carry'd along with her to <HI>Rome,</HI> to move
<PB N="107" REF="260"/>
His <HI>Holiness</HI> to a Compassion for them. When she arrived at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> she took the way to <HI>Paris,</HI> concealing from the World, both Her∣self, and her Affairs. She lodg'd some time <HI>In∣cognito</HI> in the Suburbs of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> to dispose of her Family, before she would withdraw into the Cloyster. And tho' she had put her Affairs in order, she would by no means go thither, before she was assured of a civil Usage. She was not ignorant of the terrible Penalty they were liable to, that leap'd over the Walls of the Con∣vent, as she had done. That she should not be exposed to it, she offered underhand, Twenty thousand Livres for her Pardon. This Summ charmed all the Nuns Eyes, which they looked upon as a Present sent them from Heaven. They were mightily surprized at her Resurrection, and acquainted her Friends with it, who doubted a long time, whether they ought to rejoice at it, or shew her some Mark of their displeasure, for wandring about the World, with a Person, upon whose account she had been forced to turn Nun. As it was never seen, that all the World was of the same Opinion, so some continued their Indigna∣tion against her, and would never see her; others did not mind the matter so much: But all of 'em agreed to have her stript of the Mony she brought from <HI>Italy,</HI> pretending it was not in her power to dispose of it to her Children. She secured it in a Person's Hands whom she had reason to con∣fide in, to have it divided amongst her Children, whenever they should either Marry, or establish themselves some other way in the World. How∣ever, they were not the only Persons who gaped after it; her deceased Husband's Friends began also to bestir themselves upon the news of what had passed. Both Parties commenced their Pro∣cess against the Children, pretending to have them declared Bastards. So much for this extraordi∣nary
<PB N="108" REF="261"/>
Scene, which, in effect, appeared in such a manner to me, that I should never have had the confidence to have mentioned it here, without hav∣ing taken all imaginable Precautions with refe∣rence to it. It is not very hard to conjecture what Decision Justice will make in it. However, it will hardly be soon determined. The Judges are seldom very prompt in deciding Causes, when the Parties are in Circumstances to dispense with Money. They believe it would derogate too much from their laudable Custom, to dispatch readily Affairs that afford Gleanings.</P>
<P>The Court being about that time at <HI>Marli,</HI> the Count of <HI>Chamilly</HI> was nam'd amongst others to go thither. In a discourse of the War, some young Gentlemen there took a share in the Conver∣sation: And the King ask'd the Count of <HI>Gram∣mont,</HI> softly, how he liked the young Gentle∣men's way of reasoning. <HI>Grammont,</HI> who has a pleasant freedom in all his Expressions, being glad to make use of this opportunity to serve the Count of <HI>Chamilly,</HI> who had been neglected for a considerable time, answer'd His Majesty, That he ought not to be surpriz'd at these young Men's way of reasoning; for if any were at the pains to ask them, if ever the <HI>Grave</HI> was Besieged, they would say nothing of what had pass'd there, nor who had defended the Place. The King perceiv'd his Design, which was to up∣braid His Majesty, that after so glorious an A∣ction, <HI>Chamilly</HI> had not been rewarded as others had, who had not his merit to plead for them. But it is no surprizing matter now a-days, to see Actions of Renown shot in their Carier. Courage and Conduct doth not intitle a Man to a plentiful <HI>Fortune,</HI> he must also be learn'd in the Art of <HI>Truckling</HI> to the <HI>Ministers.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> was extraordinary upon this account; and however highly he valued the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> which none
<PB N="109" REF="262"/>
could deny to him; yet to serve the King faith∣fully was no sufficient Character to recommend one, unless he were his Creature: Without that nothing would do; it was his constant Maxim, that it was impossible to be His <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>'s Friend, without being the <HI>Ministers.</HI> I shall neither justifie nor condemn him; there is a great deal to be said on both sides. His Ma∣jesty, who without dispute, is the most sincere and prudent Prince in the Universe, took this oc∣casion to do <HI>Chamilly</HI> all the justice that could be expected. So that those who were entirely Strangers to the Siege of the <HI>Grave,</HI> as the Count of <HI>Grammont</HI> pretended, might easily be inform'd of all that pass'd there.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being alarm'd at the Preparations the King was making in <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI> acquainted the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> afresh of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the end they might send their <HI>Fleet</HI> into the Mediterranean, to make Head against the King's. These two <HI>Powers,</HI> being full as weary of the War as <HI>His Most Christian Majesty,</HI> for that no advantage could accrue to them by continuing of it, amused them from time to time with fair Promises, without troubling themselves to per∣form them. They thought it convenient to allow <HI>France</HI> to act its utmost Efforts upon that side, that the House of <HI>Austria</HI> might become the more tractable, and oppose no more a <HI>Tranquility,</HI> of which all <HI>Europe</HI> stood in need. The <HI>Pope</HI> made use of his Interest in vain, to draw over that <HI>House</HI> to it, so great was their confidence, that <HI>France</HI> would at last be oppressed by so many Enemies as were United against it. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s falling off, gained nothing upon their obstinacy, tho' it eased <HI>France</HI> very sensibly. The <HI>Pope</HI> could never offer his Mediation to decide the Quarrel, most of the Parties interessed, being of another Religion. In fine, the <HI>Swedish</HI> King accom∣plished
<PB N="110" REF="263"/>
what His Holiness could never bring to pass. He made the <HI>Parties</HI> agree to accept of him, as <HI>Mediator</HI> of their <HI>Differences.</HI> The Ca∣stle of <HI>Ryswick</HI> was named for the <HI>Place</HI> of their Congress, tho' the Emperor opposed it upon se∣veral accounts. They endeavoured to accommo∣date Matters in an amicable way, which was ex∣ceeding hard to do, considering the Exorbitant De∣mands of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> These insisted always upon the Restitution of all they had lost since the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and had no re∣gard to the two later Treaties of <HI>Aix-la Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Nimiguen;</HI> alledging, They had only been obliged to make them, by a superior <HI>Force,</HI> to a∣void the utter Desolation of their <HI>States.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> for his part, demanded the Re∣stitution of his <HI>Domains,</HI> without any regard to the Conditions that were agreed upon by the Treaty of <HI>Nimiguen;</HI> which seemed so insupportable to his Father, that he chose rather never to enter into the Treaty, than accept of them upon these Terms. A great many other Princes came also to thwart it, who demanded Reparation of the King for a great many Places and Villages, that they alledg'd, he had divested them of; insomuch, that <HI>His most Christian Majesty</HI> might have been compared to the Bird in the Fable, from which all the other Birds (his Enemies) meant to pluck a Feather.</P>
<P>It had been very hard to redress all these Con∣fusions, if the common Misery had not obliged the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> to remove the Diffi∣culty; it had like to have proved a Gordian-Knot, where the Sword is more necessary than Art. But as these two <HI>Powers,</HI> to speak properly, were the very <HI>Life</HI> of the Alliance, that had no motion, but from this <HI>Spring;</HI> they asked the <HI>French</HI> Ple∣nipotentiaries at <HI>Ryswick,</HI> if they meant to stand to the Preliminaries that were stipulated with Monsieur <HI>Calliers;</HI> otherwise, it were to no pur∣pose
<PB N="111" REF="264"/>
to Meet; but if they intended faithfully to perform what was agreed upon, they would soon remove all other obstacles. These <HI>Preliminaries</HI> were of no less consequence, than the Restitu∣tion of two intire Provinces, and of one <HI>Place</HI> of equal importance to all the rest. These two <HI>Powers</HI> doubted, that <HI>Calliers</HI> had made these ad∣vances of his own Head, that he might with the greater facility, discover their Pretensions; but his Colleagues having assured them it was the King's sincere Intention, they went on with the Treaty, in such a manner, as the World might perceive, they meant to bring it to a happy Con∣clusion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Court of <HI>France</HI> increas'd in the number of Subjects, by the <HI>Conquests</HI> it made during the course of the War, tho it had to do with so many Enemies, as one would have thought were sufficient to bring it to Desolation. No∣thing but Coaches was to be seen at <HI>Versailles;</HI> some of them with the Ornaments peculiar to the Electors of the Empire; and that was become so fashionable, that even the <HI>French</HI> themselves had them set upon theirs. However, the better sort of Men despised it, seeing no apparent rea∣son, why they were so ready to imitate the Cu∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oms of the Empire; for if His Majesty had firmly pretended to it, he was so far from it now, that there was not the least appearance of his ar∣riving to it. However, there were some of these Gentlemen who had a just Title to carry them; particularly the Count of <HI>Egmont,</HI> who Married Madamoiselle <HI>De Conac,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Aix</HI>'s Niece, His Majesty conferr'd the Honours of the <HI>Louvre</HI> upon her: And these were justly due to her, because her Husband was Lineally Descended of the Dukes of <HI>Ghelderland,</HI> which created to her a great deal of envy amongst the other Ladies of Quality; insomuch, that the Mareschal <HI>d'Estree</HI>'s
<PB N="112" REF="265"/>
Lady could not dissemble her Resentment of it. One day at Dinner with Mons. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> she said, without regarding if any there would resent her discourse, She admir'd, that the Count of <HI>Egmont</HI> would condescend to Marry such a Girl as Madamoiselle <HI>Conac.</HI> The Chevalier <HI>d'Obtere,</HI> Governor of <HI>Couelloure,</HI> over-heard her, and be∣ing Uncle to the young Gentlewoman, could not avoid being concern'd at it. He told the Gentleman who sat next him, How unbecoming it was for <HI>Morin</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Daughter, to talk after that man∣ner, of a Person of his Niece's Quality: that he own'd the Honour the Alliance had done both to her and all her Friends: but great as it was, it fail'd of that the <HI>Morins</HI> had by the Blood of the <HI>Estrees;</HI> that the difference was not so great between the <HI>Egmonts</HI> and the <HI>Conacs,</HI> as betwixt the <HI>Etrees</HI> and the Burgesses of the City of <HI>Tours.</HI> All the Company expected, that the Chevalier would not fail to resent it after that manner; and knowing that the Lady was ignorant of the Chevalier's Interest in Madamoiselle, they continu'd the Conversation upon the same subject with her, that she might avoid a second oversight. Then she became sensible of her fault, and of the pri∣vate reproof they gave her; but whether she had done it, because she knew him not, or through im∣prudence, she never made him any acknowledge∣ment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Lent</HI> follow'd soon after, and a certain Monk, nam'd <HI>Seraphin,</HI> Guardian of the <HI>Capucins</HI> at <HI>Meudon,</HI> was chosen to Preach before the King that Season; he behav'd himself with such free∣dom, that it was generally believ'd he would be forbid the Pulpit; but His Majesty was so intent upon his Devotion, as some alledge, out of a principle of Christianity, in favour of the <HI>Peace,</HI> that he overlook'd a great many things, which at any other time he would have maintain'd with
<PB N="113" REF="266"/>
the point of his Sword: I say, His Majesty, who honours all Men of Probity, was so far from be∣ing offended at it, that he own'd, nothing pleas'd him more than his Sermons, and desir'd him to continue them after the same manner, nor did the King ever neglect any of them; but perceiving that the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> never came to them, he ask'd him the reason. The Duke re∣ply'd, That he had no Seat in the Church. His Majesty conferr'd the Bishop of <HI>Orlean</HI>'s, his first Almoner's Seat upon him, the Bishop being then at his Cathedral, two days journey from <HI>Paris,</HI> whence returning very soon, he de∣sir'd to have his Seat again; the Duke refus'd it, pretending he never had it but out of Decen∣cy; and now His Majesty conferring it upon him, he meant to shut him out of it. This difference made no less noise than Monsieur <HI>Boleau</HI>'s Lu∣trin. Both parties were back'd by their Friends in their pretensions, and if they durst to have fought for it, they were sufficiently animated against each other to have done it; but resting satisfied to shew, that they were both Men of Spirit, they turn'd their Indignation to sollicite His Majesty, that he would be pleas'd to decide the cause in favour of the respective Party.</P>
<P>The King gave it for the Duke, which vex'd the Prelate to that degree, that, out of spite, he return∣ed to his Diocess. He carried the Abbot of <HI>Coaslin</HI> along with him, as if, by that, he meant to engage him in his Resentment. This Abbot had the survivorship of the Prelate's Charge, as first Almoner, and the expectation of the first Bishoprick should fall: Besides, his Uncle had no reason to complain of the favours of the Court. After the Death of Monsieur <HI>Chanvallon,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> the King had awarded him his nomination for a Cardinal's Cap, which he had formerly gratified the Archbishop with.
<PB N="114" REF="267"/>
So that neither of them could be excus'd from im∣prudence, that shew'd so much Passion, for so small a cause.</P>
<P>About the same time, his Brother, the Duke of <HI>Coaslin</HI> had another kind of Vexation that seem'd to be better grounded than theirs: His Coach was Arrested for Debt, which the Advo∣cate, <HI>Master of Requests,</HI> and <HI>Register of the Points of Honour,</HI> before the Mareschals of <HI>France,</HI> al∣ledg'd was unduly done, because of his Dignity. Some years ago, he made a great deal of noise about it, in favour of the Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> who suffer'd the same Affront; but as he was far inferior in Wit and Reputation to Monsieur <HI>Pom∣ponne,</HI> his Brother-in-law, after he had been cru∣shed in the Defence he undertook in <HI>Ventadour</HI>'s Affair, he never dar'd to appear in defence of <HI>Coaslin.</HI> He was e'en ready to lay down his Charge before the Mareschals of <HI>France,</HI> which made him the more wary of engaging into new Troubles, for fear of ending as he had begun.</P>
<P>Tho' this was some Mortification for the Duke, to be oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Walk home a-foot, yet about the same time, a more pressing Vexation afflict∣ed the Dutchess or <HI>Svlly;</HI> for the Princess of <HI>Furstemberg</HI> caus'd to seize both her Bed and Furniture, for her Rent: tho' she had run only three Years in Arrear, there being thirteen Years Rent due at the Death of the Duke her Hus∣band, of which the Dutchess had clear'd ten, since she was a Widow: But there being a misunder∣standing between them, and the Princess alledging, that the Dutchess had spoke with more freedom than decency of her, when her Husband had been Wounded at Hunting, she laid hold of this op∣portunity, to make her repent of her imprudence. These two Affairs were represented to the King, to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w if his Majesty would exempt the Duke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or reduce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o their
<PB N="115" REF="268"/>
immovables. But His Majesty's Answer gave them small encouragement; he reply'd, That eve∣ry one was concern'd to pay their Debts; and tho he did not approve of some procceedings, yet it was sufficient that they were screen'd by Ju∣stice.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Lude</HI>'s interest had bet∣ter success for the Dutchess of <HI>Vernevil,</HI> her Mo∣ther. The King conferr'd a Pension of Twelve thousand Livres upon her, which she had almost refus'd, reputing it too mean for a Person of her Rank. For as she had the honour to be the Wi∣dow of the King's Uncle, she thought it her due to be treated as a Princess of the Blood, tho' the advantage he boasted of, came<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Left-hand. His Majesty seldom gave them less than Twenty thousand Livres, and she thought it was none of her business to accept of so little, considering what others receiv'd, who could not come in competiton with her. In effect, the Count of <HI>Brancas</HI> enjoy'd Fourteen thousand Livres for his Life; and after his Death, His Majesty continu'd it to the Princess of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> his eldest Daughter. A great many others had also larger Pensions than her's, which vex'd her to that degree, that she told her Daugh∣ter, She meant to resign it again freely to the King. The Dutchess of <HI>Lude,</HI> not thinking it convenient for her to resent after this manner the First-fruits of her favour, disswaded her from it; for it is His Majesty's Prerogative to give, and not to receive Laws.</P>
<P>About that time, the only Son of the Mar∣quis of <HI>Gordes,</HI> presented a Petition to the King, that vex'd the Marquis of <HI>Rhodes</HI> much more than his Gout, which afflicted him for many Years. The Marquis of <HI>Rhodes</HI> had married the other Sister: He was no such Gamester as his Father; but had a much lighter Head: For, had he been on∣ly a Gamester, the Bishop had pardon'd him, for
<PB N="116" REF="269"/>
in that he had been of his own Kidney; but the Prelate thinking him somewhat maddish, causes him to be shut up in a Convent. This poor Gentle∣man believ'd that the Bishop had impos'd upon His Majesty in the Affair, and thought he could easily perswade the King of the contrary, had he the honour to see him; but as Fools do not think they are so, or rather believe they are the wisest of Men, if you credit their Oath: The King did not think it convenient to trust him: He was afraid to be deceiv'd, as he had been late∣ly by a Num-scul, who had escap'd out of the <HI>Bastille,</HI> where his Friends had shut him up upon the same account. He was a Cadet of the House of <HI>Usez,</HI> but so little reform'd by his Imprisonment, that immediately upon his escape he committed the height of Folly in marrying very miserably. He chose a Woman that was neither Rich, Young, nor Handsome, and for an additional comfort, the Widow of a <HI>Common Fellow,</HI> that became a Gentleman only at his Death; for they did him the favour to cut his Throat in consideration of his Wife, who was more honestly descended; for had they treated him according to his merit, they were affraid she might lye under the imputation of the Wife of a Man that was Hang'd. But his Folly did not stop there, for he carried her a∣long with him to <HI>Versails</HI> and St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> where he had reviv'd the <HI>Angels</HI> that had died a long time before. But as People have sometimes more plea∣sure in Fools than in Wise Men, every one di∣sturb'd his Brain the more, in making him believe they delighted in his Folly.</P>
<P>Much about that time, there happen'd a quar∣rel betwixt two Persons of Quality at St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> who treated one another after the rate of true <HI>Billingsgate.</HI> Their Sex excus'd them from the use of the Sword, to decide it, but being equal∣ly provided with the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms of the Sex, they fair∣ly
<PB N="117" REF="270"/>
disputed for the Victory. The one was Prin∣cess of <HI>Montaban,</HI> and the other Madam of <HI>Gra∣ncei.</HI> At last, both having spent their Spirits in the Controversie, without the least respect to one anothers reputation, Madam of <HI>Grancie</HI> appeal'd to Monsieur—who was present, to decide their Difference. The Princess accepted freely of the motion, and having call'd him that minute, intreated him to judge the Affair impartially. He gave thim an attentive hearing, but after both of them had taken the pains to set forth their Cause, he made answer, That he discharged the Process. They ask'd him in a grumbling way, what he meant? But the answer he made them, shock'd them more than all that went before. He reply'd, That he had no other Sentence to give to such people as them, and all they offer'd was as light as Wind. They could never get him to give another Reason, which made them resolve upon a mutual Accommodation, without giving any body any further trouble upon the matter.</P>
<P>This gave great joy to the Judge, who finding them afterwards in a good understanding with one another, accosted them in this manner, <HI>I told you</HI> (said he) <HI>That the Sentence I pronounced, was the only one that could be given amongst such People as you: Women of your Quality quarrel and agree again with equal facility; and unless a Lover be in the case, there is no fear of an Acco∣modation.</HI> Had the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who loves Novelty, been chosen Judge of their Difference, he had possibly decided it rather in favour of the one than the other. Tho' he had formerly some inclinations for Madan <HI>Grancie,</HI> he thought now, that her Face wrinkled with Age, was not to be put in competition with the Charms of the Princess of <HI>Montauban.</HI> This Lady made him Laugh when he had no mind to it; she inherited
<PB N="118" REF="271"/>
from her Ancestors, a Genius for Comedy, for she was Daughter to the Count of <HI>Nogent,</HI> and Sister to the Chevalier of <HI>Nogent,</HI> who is still alive, and whose only Trade, since he left the War, was to make the Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> laugh. This Minister had him along with him in his own Colash, in all his Journies; nor was he the on∣ly person who lov'd to divert himself with Childish Expressions; for Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> at his leisure Hours, had also People to entertain him with ridiculous Stories. It's pity but Madam <HI>D'Anoy,</HI> and Madam <HI>de Moral,</HI> had thought at that time of diverting him with their Fairies; they had been often very acceptable. Thus you see great Men have their weak side as well as others; and there is nothing that convinces us more of the frailty of humane Nature.</P>
<P>The pleasure the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> found in the Princess of <HI>Montauban</HI>'s Conversation, made him resolve to carry her along with him to <HI>Marly.</HI> All are not free to go thither, and it must be by Stratagem that leave is obtain'd to go; for after the King is earnestly sollicited, he reckons it a par∣ticular Favour to grant it, as in effect it is, to go where the Prince goes, and to appear before him in a place where there is no confusion to be seen, tho' it prevails in other places where the Court comes. The Duke's expectation was frustrated, for His Majesty refus'd his Request. However, the Duke not being much discourag'd at the first Repulse, insisted in his demand, ho∣ping to obtain it at last by his importunity. At last seeing His Majesty inexorable, he intreated him at least to impart his Reason. No doubt tho' the King, who always goes upon good grounds, had a very plausible Reason, but suspecting it might prove disobliging to the Princess, he desir'd, in a smiling way, to be excus'd from a thing he had resolv'd not to tell. The Duke, who is always
<PB N="119" REF="272"/>
very pressing in what he undertakes, observing that the King had only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old him so in a smiling way, importun'd His Majesty more than ever to know his Reason. His Majesty to be freed from his importunity, at last made him answer, That because he was so very earnest, he would tell him freely; That he was always well pleas'd to see handsome Women, and the Princess of <HI>Mon∣tauban</HI> being none of the number, he would not accustom his Eyes to look upon her. In effect, she was very far from being Handsome. Her Face was mark'd with scars from her Infancy; she was Hunch'd Back'd, but found the secret to con∣ceal it in some measure, by the help of Steel Bodies; besides, being somewhat advanc'd in Years, she was the more insupportable. How∣ever, being still as Handsome in the Duke's Opini∣on, as a great many other Women whom His Majesty Honour'd with the same Favour, he still pleaded on her behalf. He ask'd His Ma∣jesty if she was not as Handsome as such and such Ladies whom he always carried along with him to the Castle of <HI>Marly.</HI> The King fell a Laughin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g when he saw his Brother take it so pa∣tiently, and left him to continue his Discourse which tended only to perswade him, that the La∣dies which he mentioned, had no better Title to such marks of distinction than she, for whom he was pleading; for he made him no other ans∣wer than what he told him at first.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Montauban</HI> resolving to go to <HI>Ver∣sailles</HI> at any rate; and seeing all the Duke's Endeavours prove Fruitless, thought of a more plausible pretext. She applied herself to the Princess of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who had the secret of ob∣taining a great many things, when others met with a refusal. Five hundred Crowns brought her Project to bear; and by these means she had the Honour to go to <HI>Marly,</HI> an Honour she had
<PB N="120" REF="273"/>
aspir'd to of a long time, and which was like to have cost her her <HI>Wits,</HI> if she had not obtain'd it. The King was well enough pleas'd with the grant he had made; he found her very pleasant and good Humour'd; and this Lady, who never knew what t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was to fast <HI>Fridays</HI> or <HI>Saturdays,</HI> found it no difficulty to comply with what others did there. In effect, finding herself in a place where the King never allow'd any one to eat Flesh, She out of Love to His Majesty, or out of Fear to displease him, did, what neither the Love nor Fear of God were ever capable to oblige her to do. But every person there knowing her ordi∣nary practice in that Affair, she thought it con∣venient to vindicate herself to those who were highly offended at the difference she made be∣twixt a mortal Man and God. But all she said had rather more Gallantry in it than real Apo∣logy. She could say nothing, but that the Food there, had a taste very different from the Food of the rest of Mankind; that the Beams of the Sun of <HI>France</HI> created another kind of warmth than the ordinary Sun, insomuch, that there was a certain happiness under his influence, that was not to be found any where else.</P>
<P>But this sort of Discourse produc'd a quite dif∣ferent effect from what she expected; for those who blam'd her before, condemn'd her much more now. They thought it had been much more proper for her (as no doubt it was) to have avoided all manner of Apology, than to make use of that she made: For as they maintain'd very well, it was an adding of impiety to the scandal, to attribute more power to a Man than to God; but she suffered them to go on, being sure to have the wanton Youths on her side; for 'tis at Court as at other places, they divert themselves often with ridiculous Trifles; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>est and most P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous are not always the
<PB N="121" REF="274"/>
most respected. This appear'd too evidently not long after in a difference she had with her Husband. He came to Court alone, while her entry was accompanied with a numerous Train of all sorts of people, shewing by that means the respect they had for her. Hence she took occasion to insult over him, as if his Solitude had given him an aversion to innocent Mirth. But he reply'd so smartly home, that she would gladly have di∣spensed with the severe Compliment she oblig'd him to return. They found what he said was somewhat extraordinary, especially of one des∣cended of a Family that never had the Reputa∣tion of being over Witty; for he was the Son of the Duke of <HI>Montbason,</HI> whom they had shut up in a Convent for his giddy Brain, at least, that was all the Reason they gave for divesting him of his Estate, tho' in good earnest they would be oblig'd to build more <HI>Bedlams</HI> than one, if they meant to shut up all that are many degrees greater Num sculls than he.</P>
<P>Debauchery was still in vogue amongst the Women, and consequently amongst the Men; ho' the King omitted nothing that could be done to oblige all People to a just observance of their Duty. The <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians, who had a dexterity of Acting every thing happily, took thence an occasion of introducing so many in∣decencies upon their Stages, that 'twas complain∣ed of to His Majesty. This displeas'd him the more, that they published an Advertisement of representing very soon a person of Quality. Therefore His Majesty expell'd them out of the Kingdom; and for a long time he was indifferent as to the Play; and if at any time he order'd them to act before him, it was rather to amuse the young People, or through policy, than for any pleasure he himself took in it. In effect, it is convenient to keep the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Action, and some
<PB N="122" REF="275"/>
people allow even of a lesser evil to obviate a greater. Tho' I hardly believe that the Gentle∣men of <HI>Port Royal</HI> would be of that Opinion, were they consulted in it; and amongst all the Casuists, we shall never find any reasonable pre∣tence, that can warrant us to commit any evil. However, His Majesty had no sooner form'd this Resolution, than he sent Monsieur <HI>D'Argenson</HI> to shut up their <HI>Theater.</HI> Accordingly he went im∣mediately before they could have the least in∣telligence of the Storm that threatned them, and call'd a great many Commissaries to attend him; not that he fear'd any Rebellion; but in regard the King commanded him to go about it with the greatest solemnity: For the Scandal they had given being publick, the King would have their Punishment to be the same. Besides, he com∣manded to seal up all their Seats. He knew they had kept their Manuscripts in them, and therefore would make sure of all they had given Advertisements of. They were extreamly sur∣prised at this manner of Usage, and the more, in that they had never dream'd of it. They went all in a Body to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to prostitute them∣selves at His Majesty's Feet; they represented to him, how they were call'd, before they came to <HI>France,</HI> which was matter of fact; for Car∣dinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who himself was the greatest Comedian in the Universe, and, perhaps, was afraid to forget a part he had Acted all his days, desir'd from time to time, to see some new Scenes to put him in mind of his Trade. Upon this score they alledg'd, That having left their Coun∣try upon that invitation, it was an injustice done to them at that time, to turn 'em out of the Na∣tion. But the King foreseeing what they aim'd at, prevented them, saying, he doubted not but it was to please Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> they under∣took that Journey; and if they pleas'd to own
<PB N="123" REF="276"/>
the truth, they had no reason to repent of their Trouble: They came into <HI>France</HI> a Foot, and were in a condition to go out of it in a Coach. This Reply gave them to understand, that His Majesty was Displeas'd; therefore they thought to make their Application to some good Patron, to appease him; but whether it was, that every one was more ready to abandon them, than pro∣tect them, because they had spared no body up∣on their <HI>Theater;</HI> or that the Courtiers were sen∣sible the King had no inclination to shew them any favour; not one person was found to plead for them: They were therefore oblig'd to look out for some other Trade for their future subsistence, and their <HI>Theater</HI> continues shut up till this day.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King's Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> laid Seige to <HI>Ath,</HI> a place His Majesty had given up to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Nimiguen.</HI> The Count <HI>de Rheux</HI> commanded within the Town with a good Garrison, amongst whom were a great many <HI>French</HI> Deserters, who looking up∣on themselves lost if they came to be known, desir'd to have the charge of the principal attacks. In all appearance they would choose rather to be cut to pieces than to surrender. But the Count of <HI>Rheux</HI> considering they might also deliver up the Post, in expectation of a Pardon, was so far from trusting or uniting them in one Body, as they desir'd, that he dispersed them amongst the different Regiments to avoid the pre∣sent Consequences he fear'd. There were three Marshals of <HI>France</HI> in that Army, namely, the Marshal of <HI>Vlileroy,</HI> the Marshal of <HI>Boufflers,</HI> and the Marshal of <HI>Catinat;</HI> but this last being beyond dispute, the greatest of the three, it was to him the King gave the Direction of the Siege. <HI>Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> made head against the Ene∣mies Army, which was jointly commanded by King <HI>William</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> But
<PB N="124" REF="277"/>
if these two Princes made any motion, it was not to run any risque; for they were sensible all their attempts would prove in vain. The Trea∣ty of <HI>Reswick</HI> was going on a pace, and knowing very well that the King would be oblig'd to give up that Place by the Peace, they did not think it convenient to Sacrifice one Man for its relief. If they had no mind to venture a Battle, they might easily lay Siege to <HI>Dinant,</HI> while Marshal <HI>de Catinat</HI> was busied at <HI>Ath.</HI> But then <HI>Brussels</HI> that was Bumbarded the Year before, was left expos'd for <HI>Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> to Besiege; so that they could not conveniently quit their Post. Besides, they knew that <HI>Ath</HI> was one of the places the Plenipotentaries of <HI>France</HI> offer'd to give up to the Allies. It had been therefore very needless for them to throw away the lives of Men upon that design, since they were sure of ha∣ving it without stroak of Sword.</P>
<P>These reasons oblig'd them to keep their Sta∣tions; or if they mov'd at any time, it was only to find a Camp where their Troops could be supplied more conveniently with all necessaries. By that means Marshal <HI>de Catinat</HI> found little difficulty in his Enterprize. The Count <HI>de Reux,</HI> for his part, was prepossess'd as well as King <HI>William</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> with a design of husbanding his Men, it being his Interest as well as the King's. Insomuch that there was hardly any shooting from the Town; nor was there ever a Siege where the Besieged made less noise. The <HI>French</HI> were extreamly astonish'd at it; and the Governor having surrendred, said in a merry mode, to the Hostages, who were sent to make the Capitulation, that it must be own∣ed the <HI>French</HI> are very bad Husbands, considering how poor they were said to be, for that they had lavished many thousand weight of Powder be∣fore that Place, and yet he was ready to hold,
<PB N="125" REF="278"/>
if they pleas'd, five hundred Pistoles to a Pen∣ny, that in less than four Months time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would enter the place, without being at the expence of one grain of Powder. These Hostages were not ignorant of his meaning, and could hardly avoid condemning their own Folly. They own'd they were very much to blame, to throw away so many Lives upon a place with∣out the least expectation of any Advantage. Not that they had lost any Person of Consequence, nor, indeed, so many Common Soldiers as was at first alledg'd; but what they spoke was with regard to the insignificancy of that Conquest; for as few as they were, it was still a greater loss than necessary, since their Blood ought to have been valued.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> for his part, Besieged <HI>Barcelona,</HI> both by Sea and Land; tho' he had acquainted His Majesty, that he was in no Cir∣cumstances to do it, yet being commanded by a supreme Order, he was oblig'd to undertake it a∣gainst his Inclination. It was never known that any place was invested; after such a manner; for he had not Troops enough to make the Cir∣cumvallation. So that the Besieged had always opportunity to keep a Communication with the <HI>Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> who took the Field in or∣der to relieve them. The Duke of <HI>Vendome;</HI> to supply his want of Men, took out of the King's Ships that were before the Town, all who were able to carry Arms. This added somewhat to his Force, but not sufficiently to compleat his Circumvallation: So that all the World believ'd he had engag'd in an Enterprize, which would cerrainly cost him his Honour. In effect, besides that the Besieged could depart and enter the Town at liberty, they were so numerous, that one would have thought it was rather an Army than a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rison. They had eleven Thousand Men
<PB N="126" REF="279"/>
in the place; and the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being in hopes of preserving it for her Nephew, recom∣mended it in particulor to the Prince of <HI>Armstadt,</HI> who, next to the Governor, had the principal Command. He promis'd Her Majesty confident∣ly to behave himself so, as she should have no rea∣son to be dissatisfied; and to make good his Promise, there pass'd very few days withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making some Sallies, which extreamly retarded the advancing of the Works. They disputed every Inch of Ground with 'em; and the World was ready to believe, That as the Arms of <HI>France</HI> had gain'd some Reputation at the taking of <HI>Ath,</HI> their Glory was like to be obscur'd by a far different Event before this place; and for an additional misfortune, the News from <HI>Poland</HI> gave them reason to suspect that the Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> had acted too precipitantly in declaring the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> King; for all the advices parti∣cular Persons receiv'd from that Country, were so unfavourable, that now they despair'd of suc∣cess.</P>
<P>However, their News from all hands made no mention of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the Em∣peror conceal'd his Design as to that Affair, so closely, that it was impossible to penetrate into it. It was generally believ'd, That Prince <HI>James</HI> was the only Rival the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had to fear; and this was the common Opinion in <HI>Po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and;</HI> for not one dream'd of the Duke of <HI>Sax∣ony</HI> but such as were in the Plot. Neverthe∣less Prince <HI>James</HI> was universally hated by great and small, in regard of the King his Father, who, ever since he had mounted the Throne, behaved himself towards his Subjects, rather as a particular interessed Person, than as a true Sovereign; for he had made open Sale of all the Favours with which the Kings his Predecessors had always us'd to gratifie their Subjects: So that tho' these People
<PB N="127" REF="280"/>
were for many Ages, accustom'd to choose no-King in a strange Family, when their own Roy∣al Family afforded one; yet they had forgotten that Custom so far in regard of him, that they would rather have seen the meanest of them∣selves upon the Throne, than have chosen any of his Issue. They were extreamly afraid that they, following his Example when advanced to the Royal Dignity, would squeeze their Subjects to the very Marrow, as he had always done.</P>
<P>This general Aversion rais'd the hopes of the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> tho' he saw that a great many of the Palatines would not declare for the Prince. This he attributed to their Avarice, and thought it was only out of a design of obliging him to give more Money. They were glad to find him of that Opinion; for while he con∣tinued ignorant of their Conduct, their Affair was like to have the better success. In fine, <HI>This,</HI> and the Affair of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> were the two things that were most in view at <HI>France,</HI> when the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> wrote to His Majesty, if he did not send him some Succours, he had reason to fear, that his Honour would certainly suf∣fer in the Enterprize in which he was engag∣ed. He gave the King a particular account of what had pass'd before the Place, that His Ma∣jesty might be the more sensible of his straits: So that the King having no more Reason to doubt of his Necessity, caus'd all the Troops he could draw out of <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> to march th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her. This fresh Re-inforcement wrought won∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, tho' even then, they nere not in a Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to draw the Line of Circumvallation. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lost no time to attack the Outworks which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> batter'd for a long time with a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> The Soldiers behav'd themselves with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bravery; and having made theselves Ma∣sters
<PB N="128" REF="281"/>
of the <HI>Covert Way,</HI> they afterwards attack'd the <HI>Bastion,</HI> which was taken and re-taken twice. A Colonel of the <HI>Irish,</HI> nam'd <HI>Dillon,</HI> who Commanded one of these attacks, had pass'd his time there very indifferently, if he had not been well belov'd by the Regiment. One of his Sol∣diers who had deserted into the Town, came within four paces of him, and having distin∣guished him from the others, <HI>Dillon,</HI> said he, <HI>Mind that it's in my power to Kill thee; but I won't; for thou never hast done me any harm: However, because thou hast by thee an Officer who is a common Hang-man of the Soldiers, I'll at least hinder him from doing any more mischief.</HI> This said, he Shot him through the Belly dead upon the Spot. This <HI>Bastion</HI> having been thus disput∣ed by both Parties, it fell, at last, into the hands of the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> who rais'd a Battery upon it; from which he thundred in such a man∣ner into the Town, that he judg'd, in all ap∣pearance, the Enemies would be oblig'd to sur∣render it in a short time. He acquainted the King with these News, and wrote to him, That he hoped in five or six days to send <HI>Chameraut</HI> to His Majesty, with an account of the Place's being surrendred. Every one was glad to hear this News, with which His Majesty was over∣joy'd. This Express was very acceptable; and while they were impatient for the arrival of the other, who was to compleat His Majesty's satis∣faction, they admir'd mightily that good Fortune, that made him Master of a Place where there was not only a numerous Garrison, but where it was also impossible for his own Army to shut up all the Passages. However, from day to day they waited <HI>Chameraut</HI>'s arrival; and expected him with the first Post. At last there arriv'd one, who they believ'd, came from that Country, because his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haise was extreamly Dirty. But no Dirt comes
<PB N="1229" REF="282"/>
thence; for it is always dry there, in regard, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seldom, or never Rains in that Country; but the Roads leading from thence being very deep, and it having Rain'd so much lately, there was a sudden Report in <HI>Paris,</HI> that an Express was arriv'd with the News of <HI>Barcelona</HI>'s being taken. However, it was a pleasant sort of Courier that came in that Chaise, namely a lusty <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> which they had catch'd in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and sent to the <HI>Dauphin;</HI> yet it was needless to tell the World so; none was like to believe it, being so prepossess'd with <HI>Chemeraut</HI>'s arrival. This oblig∣ed a Court Lord to Answer these Faithless Peo∣ple who spoke to him after that manner, That it was true the Courier was arriv'd; but had rencountred with a Misfortune upon the Road, so that none could learn the particulars of the Towns being taken, from him; That having met with Assassins, the Postillion brought him dead in the Chaise, and that no doubt they had car∣ried off his Packet; for having search'd him, they had found none about him. This Dis∣course gave occasion to another piece of News fully as true as the former: For the Report flying about very suddenly, all <HI>Paris</HI> believ'd the next day, that <HI>Chemeraut</HI> had been Kill'd. However, the Man was in excellent good health, and so far from having any desire to die, that he took all possible care of his Person. He was as Fat and Gross as four other Men, nor did he become so by feeding upon the Air, for he generally eat as much as other twelve Men.</P>
<P>After all, these News prov'd only false A∣larms. Before the Town was taken, the <HI>Viceroy</HI> was resolv'd to hazzard a Battle with the Duke, and, for that purpose, summon'd together all those whom they call <HI>Miquelets</HI> in that Country; and having joyn'd them with his regular Troops, he
<PB N="130" REF="283"/>
approach'd to the Duke of <HI>Vendome.</HI> It had been in vain for him to cut off their Provisi∣ons by Land, they being supply'd from the Sea. He had a more noble Design than to amuse himself so meanly, he meant to decide the Af∣fair all at once by a Battle; and to that pur∣pose having call'd a Council of War, he resolv∣ed, with his General Officers, to march the next day in the Evening, directly towards the Duke. He acquainted the Governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> with his Resolution, to the end, that at the same time, he might make a vigorous Sally upon the Enemies, and so attack them upon all sides. In less than half an hour after, the Duke knew all the measures they had concerted against him, and being thus put upon his Guard, he march'd to meet him the Night before he was to exe∣cute his Design. But the Viceroy had already divided his Army in two parts, in order to at∣tack him with the greater advantage. This was made known to the Duke, who fell upon him with extraordinary fury; notwithstanding the Laurels the Vice-Roy had promised to himself, he was still in Bed when they came to acquaint him, that his Guards lost ground; they made no re∣sistance at all, but betook them to their heels; and the Duke had certainly taken the Viceroy (as was expected) in Bed, if they had not awaked him of a sudden. The Noise he heard about his Tent, having surpriz'd his Attendants as well as himself, made them believe that all was lost: He excus'd his <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> from his Duty at that time; and fearing he had no time to Dress, he made the best of his way Nak∣ed as he was, thinking the greatest thing he could do, was to save himself. The part of his Army that was with him, followed his Example, ex∣cept a very few that put themselves upon the Defence. The Duke made a great many Priso∣ners;
<PB N="131" REF="284"/>
the Vice-Roy's small Trunk fell also into his hands, with twenty Tousand Pistols in <HI>Specie;</HI> and the Soldiers made a considerable Booty. All he wanted now to compleat his Victory, was, to know, that the other Detachment he had sent against him, had met with the same Fate, and in a very little time he had that satisfaction. He knew that Mons. <HI>D'Usson,</HI> whom he had en∣trusted with that Expedition, had behav'd him∣self gallantly; and return'd to joyn him with all the Glory he could desire.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was as much sur∣prised as the Prince <HI>D'Armstad,</HI> when he heard these Tydings. The Duke did not keep him long in the Dark, he sent to acquaint him with it, that he might not continue any longer to make a fruitless Defence. But having still eight Thousand Men in Garrison, he thought it Dis∣honourable to surrender to a Prince, who had not Soldiers enough to invest the Place intirely, and therefore kept out some few days longer, ra∣ther to fulfil the Duty of a brave Commander, (of which he had been always emulous) than out of any hops of hindring the Town from be∣ing taken.</P>
<P>In effect, in a very few days he caus'd a Parly to be beat, pretending to give up the Town on∣ly, and retire with his Men into the Castle, which (being situated upon a Hill) he could hold out for a considerable time. But he delay'd so long in surrendring, that the Duke refus'd to accept any other Composition, than to have the Castle given up as well as the Town. The Go∣vernor thought this condition very severe; but as those who are Conquer'd, are commonly ob∣lig'd to receive Laws from the Conqueror, so he was fain to accept of it. It was then that <HI>Chemeraut</HI> appear'd at Court of a different size from a <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> He brought these good Ty∣dings
<PB N="132" REF="285"/>
to the King, which pleas'd His Majesty extreamly, who began to fear some reverse of Fortune might have happen'd to the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> since he had sent his last Express. <HI>Che∣meraut</HI> had twenty Thousand Livers for his pains, and a Commission to act as Marshal <HI>de Camp.</HI> His Majesty being now freed from all his Fears, had more reason to be assur'd of the Peace; for besides that, the Conference at <HI>Ryswick</HI> went on apace, there were some other Conferences up∣on the same Subject, betwixt the Marshal of <HI>Boufflers</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI> After the loss of <HI>Ath,</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> who knows how to make his advantage of every thing, judging this Earl, in every degree, as dexterous as the Marshal, thought it convenient to employ him upon that Head; by this means he meant to remove more speedily, a great many difficulties that could not be so easily terminated in a longer time. At <HI>Ryswick,</HI> in regard of the Formalities, the Pleni∣potentaries were oblig'd to observe measures with one another. <HI>Portland</HI> sent a Trumpeter, as of his own accord, to the Marshal, to ask a pri∣vate interview with him, without making any mention of his Affair. The Marshal thought it convenient, with the Advice of the other two <HI>French</HI> Marshals, to consent to it; and having agreed, that they should meet by themselves, and their Guards should be of an equal number; The Earl propos'd to him to remove some Dif∣ferences there, that would require too long time at <HI>Ryswick.</HI> The Marshal being unwilling to un∣dertake any thing without express Order from His Majesty, sent an Express to know his Will. The great desire the King had to make Peace, made him approve of what the Earl propos'd, without considering, perhaps, what advantage he might have over the Marshal, in a superiour Ge∣nius; and the inconvenience of putting him upon
<PB N="133" REF="286"/>
a level with a Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> an Honour His Majesty ought not to look upon as indiffer∣ent. It's true, as the King of <HI>France</HI> had advanc∣ed <HI>Boufflers</HI> from a Cadet of <HI>Picardy,</HI> to the Dignity of a Duke, Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> Gover∣nor of the most considerable Province of his Kingdom; And, in fine, of a Knight of his <HI>Or∣der:</HI> So King <HI>William</HI> had rais'd the other from an ordinary Gentleman of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> to an Earl and Peer of <HI>England,</HI> and Knight of the Order of the <HI>Garter.</HI> But still there was this difference, that the one Commanded an Army, and the other never did: Besides, there was that also to be said, That <HI>His most Christian Ma∣jesty</HI> had never own'd King <HI>William,</HI> and so the <HI>French</HI> esteem'd only the Earl as the Favourite of a Prince, whom they had never recogniz'd as King.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> was glad that His most Chri∣stian Majesty over-look'd all those considerations; not that he wanted to obtain a recognisance from him, as well as from other Crown'd Heads; but because he knew well that the <HI>English</HI> were as passionately desirous of a Peace as the <HI>French.</HI> Their Commerce was then at a stand; and, which is very surprising, the most Christian King had been a gainer by what was reckon'd his probable Ruin. After he had lost I do not know how many Ships at <HI>la Hogue,</HI> and was ren∣der'd uncapable of appearing at Sea; He had found his Account in the way of Piracy, and had taken so many Prizes both from the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that both of 'em were quite cast down. 'Tis inconceivable what an infinite num∣ber these Prizes are said to amount to; and tho' I have heard an account of it from one of the greatest Traders in <HI>England,</HI> who ought to know that Affair as well as any body, yet I shall be cautious of repeating it, for fear I should be
<PB N="134" REF="287"/>
charg'd with Credulity. In effect, the thing is so surprizing, that it astonishes one: But, after all, if we consider that these two Nations sub∣sist only by their Commerce, and that the Sea was continually cover'd with their Vessels, so that the <HI>French</HI> had an opportunity of attacking 'em every minute with an advantage, especial∣ly when they were without Convoys; upon this consideration, I say, we may easily conceive how they came to sustain so great a loss. But let it be as it will, K. <HI>William</HI> being sensible of the necessity of a Peace, in order to be free from such Inconveniencies, order'd my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> to re∣move all the difficulties that might oppose it.</P>
<P>In the mean time K. <HI>James</HI> had but a sorry Game to play. Pursuant to the King's Promise of never making a Peace till he were restored, He had all along hop'd, that His Majesty would effect his Restoration sooner or later. And this his expectation was screw'd higher by the King's open Declaration to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that he would make his Promise good. Besides, that this un∣happy Prince was turn'd out of his Dominions, only, because he would not declare against the King. He had been frequently Sollicited to op∣pose the King's Interest before the Prince of <HI>O∣range</HI> came into his Place; and had he done that, no Potentate whatsoever would ever have consented to his being disquieted. Nay, to speak the Truth, 'twas a thing of too dangerous Con∣sequence for the Potentates themselves; but that Prince having discover'd his firm Resolution to stand by the secret Alliance he had made with the King, all other Princes combin'd against him, because he would not joyn with them in reducing a Power that seem'd to threaten their Repose. This, the most Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istian King was very sensible of, and did not fail to acknow∣ledge it. He did for him all that he could do,
<PB N="135" REF="288"/>
and offer'd both him and his Qeen a Retreat and Entertainment. Tho' he was engag'd in a War with the greatest part of <HI>Europe,</HI> yet he gave him fifty thousand <HI>Louis d'Ors</HI> a Year. 'Tis true, this was but a small allowance for the King of <HI>England,</HI> upon the comparison with what he had when he possess'd his Dominions; but 'twas a great deal for a Prince to give, that was at the same time oblig'd to maintain four or five hun∣dred thousand Men, to make head against the numerous Enemies that his Grandeur had rais∣ed against him; and upon that score, doubtless K. <HI>James</HI> was oblig'd to him. But after all, 'twas not long of the King that he did not make good his Promise. The unfortunate Prince had been always guilty of the same Fault, that his Brother committed when he occasion'd the loss of the Battle of <HI>Dunbar.</HI> He caress'd the <HI>Scots</HI> in such a manner, that he himself oppos'd his own Restauration. His chief Minister was a <HI>Scotch∣man,</HI> and there having always been a great jea∣lousie between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> the pre∣ference he gave to the latter at his Court, ali∣enated the Hearts of the former. This was the occasion, that a great many Enterprizes form'd on his behalf, never took; and forasmuch as that Prince had much more Devotion than Brains, as the <HI>French</HI> could not but lament his Fate, so they could not avoid saying, That tho' he had sunk himself by his bad Conduct, yet 'twas not reasonable they should suffer themselves to be suck'd in along with him. In fine, the King being much more oblig'd to his own King∣dom than to any other, could not avoid the gi∣ving him to know, That many things he did were directly opposite to his Interest. Nay, all his true Friends had told him the same thing upon several occasions, insomuch, that to satisfie the one and the other, he pretended to disgrace My Lord
<PB N="136" REF="289"/>
<HI>Melfort,</HI> Brother to the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Minister was hated, not only at his Ma∣ster's Court, but even by the <HI>French,</HI> who had attended <HI>K. James</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> These alledg'd, That if it had not been for him, Things had. gone otherwise in that Country than they did Nay, some of 'em did not stand to charge him openly with keeping a Correspondence with the Enemies; affirming, that if it had not been so, he had never made such opposition as he did, against all that Mr. <HI>Roses,</HI> the most Christian King's Lieutenant General, proffer'd to attempt in that Country. And, in earnest, if the digression were excusable, I could easily make it out, that <HI>that</HI> Minister wanted either Conduct or Fidelity. God forbid, that I should affirm with others, that he entertain'd a Corespondence with K. <HI>William.</HI> But to over-look all these things, and return to my Subject, all these Circumstances oblig'd His most Christian Majesty to joyn with K. <HI>William</HI> in removing the Obstacles that might retard the Peace. The first Conference between Marshal <HI>Bouf∣flers</HI> and my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> was seconded quickly by several others. They adjusted several things that the Plenipotentaries at <HI>Ryswick</HI> would not have agreed upon in a Years time. However, at one of their Interviews, where several Of∣ficers were present on both sides, My Lord <HI>Port∣land</HI> hearing a discharge of Cannon and Musquets in the <HI>French</HI> Army, ask'd the Marshal what the meaning of it was: The Marshal made answer, That 'twas occasion'd by the News the King had sent of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Election to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> This was matter of Fact; for Abbot <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ignac</HI> had dispatch'd a Courier to the Court to acquaint the King, that the Prince was proclaim'd King of <HI>Poland</HI> by the Cardinal Primate and some Palatines that sided with him. But this Intelligence included another part, name∣ly,
<PB N="137" REF="290"/>
That the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> was likewise pro∣claim'd King, by the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> and all the Partisans of the <HI>House of Austria.</HI> This ought, at least probably, to have prevented our making so much haste; and upon that score, my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> fell a Laughing; and told the Marshal, That, indeed, this spoke the <HI>French</HI> to be quicker than all other Nations; That they had formerly shewn the same disposition upon many Occasions; and that in this Affair, they still continu'd to have the start of their Allies; but in the mean time, the Allies having time enough to testifie their Joy, upon the advantages that accru'd to 'em, had re∣solv'd to stay till Night, or next Morning, before they gave a solemn proof of the Joy they were fill'd with, upon the News, That the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and not the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> had mounted that Throne.</P>
<P>The Marshal thought he Banter'd him, in proposing a Protestant for a Dignity, that could not be enjoy'd but by a Roman-Catholick. Had my Lord made mention of Prince <HI>James,</HI> it had made another sort of impression upon him. In fine, my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> having a mind that he should not flatter himself any longer, upon the imaginary Success of the <HI>French</HI> Party, gave him a naked account of the Matter. Upon this dis∣covery, the Army that was Celebrating the Glory of the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> with a full admiration of his Valou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, were then mightily surpriz'd. How∣ever, they were unwilling to believe it; for that Nation can never be perswaded of any thing that tends to their disadvantage; whether it be, That this is a common Humour among other Nations, or, That they in particular are presumptuous up∣on their own Merit. But what inflam'd their suspicion, the Court, who knew the bottom of Things, more than any body else, was very silent upon the Matter, after the Solemnity was over.
<PB N="138" REF="291"/>
Their design in the Solemnity, was only to per∣swade the People, That their Interest went well in <HI>Poland;</HI> and so to comfort 'em, in some mea∣sure, for the loss of the Money they had sent thither. The People were the more willing to shew their Congratulation, That all of 'em had not only a Respect, but a Love for the Prince of <HI>Conty;</HI> nay, they even ador'd him; so true it is, That a good Reputation is able to produce mar∣vellous Effects in the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>I cannot tell what the Prince's own Thoughts were, or whether he believ'd the Report, of the reality of his Election. He made no discovery of his Mind. Those who were accustom'd to weigh Things before they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dit 'em, took the li∣berty to speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mind. Some were of opinion, That supposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> case had been as favourable, as it was represented, yet they could not make it bear, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blows. They were likewise sensi∣ble, That the War they were oblig'd to undertake upon that account, would be very disadvantage∣ous to 'em. They knew very well, that the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was a powerful Prince, and that his Confederate Princes had their Troops conveniently Posted; that they could easily conduct 'em to <HI>Po∣land,</HI> without any danger; whereas, the Troops to be sent from <HI>France,</HI> would be oblig'd to im∣bark in some Sea-Port of the <HI>French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>landers,</HI> and land in the Neighbourhood of certain Potentates, whose Affection to the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> the King had some reason to doubt.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> perceiving he would be oblig'd to unsheath his Sword, if he meant to make good his Election, durst not display the Affliction he was under, upon the view of leaving a Mistress, that he lov'd as passionately as a Crown. His only aim, was to please the King, who press'd him to accept of that Crown, as well for his own Interest, as out of the Love he bore
<PB N="139" REF="292"/>
him. However, such a degree of indifference was very odd, in a Prince of his Courage, and a Nephew of the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> One would have thought, that he would have exerted his utmost efforts, to mount the Throne, since his Uncle, upon a design of that nature, had not only rais'd a Civil War in his Country, but put himself at the Head of the Capital Enemies of his King and Country. Some days pass'd without any noise, only the King saluted the Prince and Princess, as King and Queen of <HI>Poland.</HI> In like manner, all the Grandees pay'd 'em the Respect suitable to that Dignity; and in order to give a colour for his not departing to receive the Crown, 'twas gi∣ven out, That Ambassadors were expected from <HI>Poland,</HI> to fetch him. The more credulous sort of People satisfy'd themselves with this News; but the more sensible part of Mankind, were more distrustful than ever, of the validity of the Election. They own'd, indeed, That to wait the Arrival of Ambassadors, was a Thing of more Glory, than to depart before their Arrival; but, at the same time, they alledg'd, (and that very justly) That 'twas not expedient, when a Crown is not disputed, and that the Crown being pro∣mis'd to him, he was so far from being ty'd to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that he ought to set out with the utmost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and appear at the Head of his Party; le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, for want of his Presence, many should be corrupted, and drawn over to his E∣nemy</P>
<P><HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce</HI> had not forgot, That the occasion of the War they were then engag'd in, (which in a man∣ner threaten'd their very Throne) was their un∣seasonable Difference with the Pope; and upon that view, were sensible, That tho' His Holiness had not so much Interest in this Affair, as in the former; yet they ought not to neglect him. In order to secure his Favour, They represented,
<PB N="140" REF="293"/>
with the utmost application, their suspicion of the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Conversion. Indeed, that was a very nice Point; and all Men, tho' never so partial, were sensible, That his declaring for the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, had more of Ambition in it, than Devotion. However, the Pope being un∣willing that a Protestant Prince should Sit upon that Throne, was so much against the Elector, that one would have thought he could never be for him. Besides, the Cardinal-Primate sent a Courier, to assure him, That the Interest of the Catholick Religion was entirely ruin'd, if he suf∣fer'd the Elector to be prefer'd to the Prince of <HI>Conty.</HI> This Message, he was prompted to, as well by his Interest, as by his Zeal for the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Religion; for the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia</HI> had in∣croach'd upon the Privileges of the Archbishop of <HI>Gnesne,</HI> which justly claims the sole Right of Proclaiming the Elected King.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there happen'd a Quarrel between Husband and Wife, in one of the princi∣pal Families retaining to the Court. 'Twas neither occasion'd by Jealousie, nor the disproportion of Tempers, as such Differences commonly are; but by a very odd Adventure, when the one approv'd of a Thing, that the other did not. We must know, that a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> not a Member of the Senate, but one of the Nobles of the <HI>Terra∣firma,</HI> being Marry'd to a Lady that he lov'd very tenderly, had so much Complaisance, as to sa∣tisfie her Curiosity, by carrying her to see <HI>France.</HI> But tho' the Beauty of <HI>France</HI> draws so many Strangers to visit it, yet her design was only to have it said, that she resembled the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> in coming so far to see the Glory of <HI>Solo∣mon.</HI> She had heard a thousand great Things of the King and His Reign; and being fond of see∣ing with her Eyes, whether the Reports were true, or enlarg'd beyond the due extent, she came
<PB N="141" REF="294"/>
on purpose along with her Husband to <HI>Versailles;</HI> in order to make the discovery. Such an Adven∣ture as this, was only wanting to compleat the History of the King; and those who are employ'd in Writing it, will take care not to forget it. However, the Husband and his Wife appearing of a sudden at Court, Mr. <HI>Bontems,</HI> Governor of the Castle, had a mind to know who they were, pursuant to the King's Orders, injoyning him to take notice of all the unknown Faces that ap∣pear'd there. Accordingly, he caus'd to ask 'em, Who they were? and what brought 'em there? He was the more particular in his Questions, in that he heard their Equipage was a true <HI>Bohemian</HI> E∣quipage; and had serv'd to amuse not only Men of Sense, but even the very Children. When the Question was ask'd 'em, they were surpriz'd, for that such Conduct was inconsistent with the Li∣berty that Reigns in their Country. But being inform'd, that all unknown Faces were treated the same way, the Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> would needs go in Person, to acquaint Mr. <HI>Bontems</HI> with the occasion of their Voyage. Mr. <HI>Bontems</HI> was sur∣priz'd to hear of his Complaisance, and having spoke of it to the King, was order'd to bring 'em both to see him Dine. To recompence the charge they were at, they were plac'd in the most con∣venient Place, for having a full view of the King. I cannot tell what their Thoughts were, or whe∣ther they said what the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> said of <HI>Solomon;</HI> but all the Courtiers being acquainted with their Errand, none of 'em us'd 'em so, as one not long ago was by <HI>John Bart,</HI> one of the famousest Pyrates that the King had during the last War; if it be lawful to give that Title to a Man that obey'd the King's Orders. Pray God forbid, that in using that expression, I should mean to reflect upon the Methods us'd by that Prince, for disturbing the Repose of his Enemies.
<PB N="142" REF="295"/>
I am too sensible of the Respect we ought to have for Supream Powers, to indulge my self in that liberty. And I am likewise sensible, That he hav∣ing so many Enemies upon him, shew'd in that; as in all other things, the depth of his judg∣ment.</P>
<P>To return to my subject, <HI>John Bart</HI> having the curiosity (as well as these Foreigners) to see the King Dine, there came a Person dignify'd with a Blue Ribbon, that finding he had a good Place, took it from him, without being over-aw'd by his Mein, which speaks him more a simple Tar∣pallion, than a Commander of a Squadron. <HI>John Bart</HI> had heard, that some Compliment was due to a Blue Ribbon; however, he took him by the Coat, upon which the Badges of his Knighthood were fix'd, and told him, with a loud Voice, <HI>Mr. Blue Ribbon, pray give me my Place; you see the King when you will; but for me who does not see him but at the four Festivals of the Year, 'tis but rea∣sonable that I should not tamely suffer my self to be robb'd of an advantage that I enjoy so seldom.</HI> The King hearing that, fell a Laughing; and told the Gentleman with the blue Ribbon, That <HI>Bart</HI> was in the right; and that 'twas His Pleasure, that he should give <HI>Bart</HI> his Place, and rather stand behind him, than affront him in that manner. Upon that, <HI>John Bart</HI> being better known on Board, than at Court, the Blue-Ribbon Spark turn'd about to view him; and apprehending his Mein to be much different from his Reputation, whisper'd to a Duke that was just by him, That if the Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and his Lady, had receiv'd as little satisfaction from the sight of the King, as he had from that of <HI>John Bart,</HI> they would be sure to grudge their Money. But that could not be; for tho' the King is very much alter'd from what he was, yet he still preserves his good Mein; insomuch, that 'tis still visible, that he has been a very graceful Man.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="296"/>
In fine, they were far from meeting with what <HI>John Bart</HI> did; for every body knew they came too far, not to have the opportunity of seeing the King. But they had no sooner receiv'd satisfaction in that point, than they return'd to <HI>Italy.</HI> 'Tis said, they staid only three days at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that, rather to rest themselves, than to see the Curiosities of the Place. This Scene being Acted in the Face of the whole Court, and being the common subject of Discourse; the Person of Quality, I pointed to above, happening to Talk of it to his Lady, a Quarrel ensued, after this man∣ner: The Lady told her Husband, That if she were to wish for any thing in this World, it should be this, That she might have as Complaisant a Husband, as that <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady; he having un∣dertaken a Journey of almost 1000 Leagues, on purpose to please her; and by that means shewn the greatest instances of a pliant Temper, that any Man can ever shew. Her Husband reply'd, That his Conduct did not speak so much a flexi∣ble Temper, as Folly; and that, for his part, if he had a Wife, that would desire such a thing of him, he would look on her as the greatest and most extravagant Fool, not only in <HI>Paris,</HI> but e∣ven in <HI>Bedlam.</HI> Each of 'em maintain'd their Sentiments with great warmth; and the Lady told him, That it seem'd he was not in the hu∣mour to satisfie her, in case she desir'd to see the Emperor, or the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Gentleman made answer, That if ever that Maggot took her, he would not content himself with shutting her up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> but would stifle her with his own Hands, as a Mad-woman. Perhaps he only said so, to signifie the aversion he had for these two Princes, who were the King's Enemies: But the Lady putting a Literal meaning upon the reply, they came to high Words, and quarrel'd out∣right,</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="297"/>
This was the Product of the Complaisance that a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> shew'd to his Lady: But in the mean while, there happen'd an Accident at Court, that was yet more surprizing, and that one Day, will perplex the Historians, tho' they are not very fond of sounding the truth of it. There's a little Town in <HI>Provence,</HI> call'd <HI>Salon,</HI> that formerly gave Birth to <HI>Nostradamus,</HI> a Man very well known at this Day, by his Centuries; some of which have come to pass in so convincing a man∣ner, that what was formerly obscure, is now as clear as Sunshine. Among these Articles, I rec∣kon what relates to the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. King of <HI>England,</HI> and that of Mr. <HI>de Cinqumares,</HI> pro∣vided still, that these were not foisted after-hand into his Works. But let that be as it will, this Town which produc'd a sort of a Prophet in the preceding Age, has furnish'd us with one in this; or at least, such a Character is given of a cer∣tain Gentleman, that appear'd then at Court, of whom this is the History. About that time, the pretended Ghost of that famous Astrologer above∣mention'd, appear'd to a Man of this City. I know not whether it was by Night or by Day; but this I know, That the Apparition put the Man in a great fear; and above all things, ad∣vis'd him, not to mention to any body, what he spoke to him; nay, he did not except his Wife; and the Man made a sign with his Head, import∣ing, that he would obey him; for he was at that time Speechless, and fear had so much influence upon him, that he could not open his Mouth. Thereupon the Apparition advis'd him to go to the Intendant of <HI>Provence,</HI> and give him to know from him, That he should give him Letters, to introduce him to the King: It represented further, That it would not tell him presently what he was to say before the King, but that he would appear again to him, when he should come near
<PB N="145" REF="298"/>
to <HI>Versailles,</HI> and there teach him his Les∣son.</P>
<P>Upon that, the Apparition disappear'd, and left him for Dead, so much was the Man fright∣ned by his Wonders, as well as by his dismal As∣pect. After some time, the Man came to him∣self; but so, as that 'twas plain he had some∣thing extraordinary in his Head. His Wife ask'd him what it was; but the Prohibition, laid upon him by the Apparition, kept him from discover∣ing any thing for some time. At last, his Wife having us'd a thousand Wheedles, to make him reveal his Mind; he open'd his Mouth I know not how often, in order to recount the Adventure, and shut it as often again; by reason that the Apparition had back'd the Prohibition with such Threats, as scar'd him. He told his Wife, That he should dye, if ever he broke Silence upon the Matter; and the fear that this should come to pass, stiffed his Words, when he was most temp∣ted to speak.</P>
<P>His Wife's Curiosity was inflam'd by his re∣serv'dness; she press'd him more than ever to re∣veal the Secret. The Husband reply'd, That his Life depended upon it, and that he could not do it. But that Word screw'd up her Curiosity to the last degree. In fine, she would not let him be easie, till he made the discovery; and the poor Man being foolishly fond of her, had no sooner acquainted her with the Apparition, and the discourse that pass'd, than he fell down quite Dead upon the spot. Upon this, the Woman was as much astonish'd as he was, when the Ghost appear'd to him. But after second Thoughts, she constru'd the discourses he utter'd before his Death, to be only the effect of a Brain disturb'd by a Mortal Sickness, and told nothing of the Matter; or if she did, 'twas with such an Air,
<PB N="146" REF="299"/>
as if she had taken his Discovery, for the Ravings of a distemper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Brain.</P>
<P>This Accident made no great Noise in <HI>Salon,</HI> or the adjacent places; which certainly it would, if it had been fully known: Nay, the People there, did dot so much as mind it; for every one, as well as his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, believ'd that the Man's Brai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of order, when he talk'd of his Vision. But at the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me time, the Vision appear'd to another Inhabitent of the same City, and made him the same Compliment; and he was as foolish as the other; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r he spoke of it that same day to the Curate, and his indiscretion was follow'd by the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate; for he di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon the spot. The noise of his Death, and the manner of it, being spread abroad, the People recall'd to their me∣mory, what was said upon the Death of the o∣ther. This was the only subject of discourse all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver <HI>Salon,</HI> and for 20 Leagues round it; nay, every body took the liberty to Comment upon it. But in the mean time, the Vision appear'd to a Blacksmith, whose House was not far from those of the two Men, I spoke of but now. 'Tis possible, he was as much afraid, as the other two; but their example being recent, and of too great consequence, to suffer him to be guilty of the same fault; he was very attentive to the Words utter'd by the Ghost; and immediately upon its disappearance, went to the Intendant, pursuant to its orders. That Magistrate gave Au∣dience every day, to all that had any business with him; so that, the Smith had no occasion for any one to introduce him: But his Story be∣ing such as could not well be told publickly, he beg'd of him, that he would retire with him to his Closet, because he had an Affair of extream Consequence to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt. The Intendant, seeing that the Man made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a sorry appearance, could not conjecture, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this important Affair might
<PB N="147" REF="300"/>
be. But being oblig'd to hear every one, and to neglect nothing relating to his Post, he desir'd him to stay a little, till he had given Audience to the rest; after which, he would hear him at his leisure. Accordingly, after the general Au∣dience was over, he and the Smith retir'd to his Closet.</P>
<P>Then the Blacksmith acquainted him, That the Af∣fair he was about to open, would at first view seem to be a pure Whim; and that he knew he would be dismiss'd for a Fool; that to prevent such ap∣prehensions, he told him so much before-hand; and in fourteen Days time, he would send to see for him, being then sensible of his error, in treat∣ing him as a Man troubled with Maggots. In fine, he set forth the occasion of his coming thi∣ther, namely, That a Vision having appear'd a Month ago to two different Persons, (that certain∣ly he had heard of, upon the account of the fatal Consequences) had likewise appear'd to him, very lately; That it had order'd him to come to the Intendant, to desire he might be sent to the King; That it had promis'd to appear again to him, at <HI>Versailles,</HI> or near to it, in order to instruct him in what he was to say to His Majesty; That ac∣cordingly, he came to discharge his Commission faithfully; and upon that score, was not afraid of meeting with the same Fate, that befel the other two.</P>
<P>The Intendant had heard something of this odd Adventure; but had always taken it for a fabu∣lous Fiction; and, pursuant to that Thought, check'd the Man in a strange manner. He ask'd him, If that was his way to abuse an In∣tendant's Time, every minute of which he knew to be precious; and at the same time, gave him to know, that he deserv'd nothing but a Goal. The Man reply'd, That his Threats made no impression upon him, for that the Vision had
<PB N="148" REF="301"/>
sufficiently prepar'd him; That he would return home, since the Intendant order'd him so to do; and that he would only have the trouble of re∣turning, when the Intendant should send for him.</P>
<P>Tho' the Intendant us'd him at this rate, yet he had a deep impression of what he said. His talk∣ing so sensibly, and so unlike a distemper'd Head, was sufficient to suggest some Reflection to the Intendant; especially, if we joyn to this the for∣mer reports of that Apparition. In effect, the Marshal was no sooner gone, but the Intendant wrote to the Lieutenant General of <HI>Salon,</HI> pray∣ing him to acquaint him, Whether the reports of that Apparition were true, or false? But to pre∣vent the communication of retractible Things, he order'd him to draw up a formal Information, in case he found any credit due to the reports that were spread abroad. At the same time, he de∣sir'd a Character of the Man that had been with him; for he had taken down his Name at first, and wanted to know, whether he was always reckon'd a Man of Sense, such as he appear'd to be. He likewise order'd him, to enquire, whe∣ther there ever were any of his Family, either by the Father or Mother-side, that were Rattle brain'd. For if any such had been found out by chance, he had not fail'd to infer from thence, that he imi∣tated their example, and by consequence, that no stress was to be laid upon what he said.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant obey'd this Letter punctually. He drew up an Information, and sent it to the Intendant; by which he saw, that all the reports of the Apparition, and its consequences, were true; and that the Marshal was always reputed a Man of good Sense. The Lieutenant likewise g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve an account of his Family; which contain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thing that could hinder the Intendant to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Court with the Affair. Accordingly,
<PB N="149" REF="302"/>
he Wrote of it to the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> Se∣cretary of State; but he did it in such a way, as signified, that he only look'd upon the Man as a Mad-man. For, he did not only set forth his own incredulity upon the Matter, but the Mea∣sures he had taken to prevent his being impos'd upon; and sent him the Information he had caus'd to be taken at <HI>Salon.</HI> By this he mean'd, and justly indeed, to justifie, That if there was any imposi∣tion in the Matter, he was not the first Author of it. His plea was, That the Magistrate of <HI>Salon,</HI> being upon the place, ought to know the Matter of Fact best; upon which, he concluded, That if he was deceiv'd, the fault ought not to lie up∣on him. He thought himself oblig'd, in a par∣ticular manner, to season his Letter with a great many Circumstances, to clear himself from too much Credulity in that Minister's Opinion; for that the Marquis being very Young, must be less Credulous than other People. He knew, that at such an Age as he was of, such things are hardly credited; and that even the Apparition of <HI>Samuel</HI> would meet with no Faith from them, if it were not spoke of in the Books that cannot be call'd in question, without Sacrilege. But the Marquis was more Credulous than one would have thought. He Writ him an Answer, probably, after speaking of it to the King; importing, That he might send him the Man, but so, as not to give any ground for charging either the one or the other with any Weakness.</P>
<P>The Intendant receiving this Order, injoyn'd the Lieutenant-General of <HI>Salon</HI> to send him the Man, upon the pretence, of answering to the In∣formation he had made, pursuant to his Order. Accordingly, the Blacksmith waited upon him, and told him at first meeting, That he had said be∣fore, 'twould not be long before he sent for him again. The Intendant made answer, That he did
<PB N="150" REF="303"/>
not send for him upon the design he thought of, but to reprimand him for meaning to impose up∣on him. By this Representation, he thought to turn the Tables upon him, in order to satisfie the Marquis's caution. But the Man knowing that he was guilty of nothing that could merit a reprimand, the Conference ended in this, That the Intendant gave him to know, that if he were as much perswaded of the Fact as he would have him believe he would be so far from hindring him to go to <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sailles,</HI> that he would give him Introductory-Letters to the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> and to facilitate his Journey, would give him a place in the first Recruit-Convoy that was to go that way. The Man did not care which way he went, so he could but satisfie the desire of the Vision; and accordingly, agreed to what was pro∣pos'd. There was a Company of Recruits just ready to be gone, which an Officer of the Town of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> had rais'd, and which were to pass near <HI>Paris.</HI> The Intendant recommended the Blacksmith to him, and gave him some Mony to give him when he par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d from him. That Officer carry'd him to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erte</HI> under <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>narre,</HI> after having Wrote to the Intendant, in obedience to his Command, That he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing in the Man, but what bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e man: For the Intendant had desir'd him to observe him narrowly upon the Road, to the end, that if he discover'd any turn of Thought in him, he might acquaint the Mar∣quis o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Barbesieux</HI> with it.</P>
<P>The Blacksmith being thus arriv'd at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> took leave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Officer, and repair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to <HI>Ver∣sailles,</HI> where he did not knew what to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, be∣cause the Ghost had not yet appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to him. But the very Night that he arriv'd, while he was in great perplexity, he heard (as he says) one un∣draw his Curtain, while he was full awake. Up∣on that, the Ghost appear'd to him, bid him fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="151" REF="304"/>
nothing, and gave him to know, That both the Secretary of State, and the King, would give him a Well-come Reception, notwithstanding the dif∣ficulties he met with at first. Being thus instru∣cted in what he was to say, both to the Marquis, and the King; he was at the same time, strictly charg'd, never to divulge what was then told him, to any body, excepting His Majesty. The Ghost acquainted him, That the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> would endeavour, by all means, to pump the Se∣cret out of him; but that he was to conceal it from him, as well as from every body else; for if he fail'd in that piece of Obedience, he should infallibly meet with the same Fate as befel the two Men in his Town.</P>
<P>The Ghost disappear'd immediately; and the Blacksmith having no great inclination to Sleep longer, went in the morning to wait upon the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> and deliver'd him the In∣tendant's Letter. The Marquis immediately call'd him to his Closet, where they both continu'd for above an hour. The report of the Blacksmith's ensuing Arrival, had been spread all over the Court before he came. For upon his depar∣ture from <HI>Provence,</HI> Letters were sent to Town; and he was every where stil'd, <HI>The Prophet,</HI> for∣asmuch as no body doubted, but that he was go∣ing to Prophesie something to the King, and had undertook that Journey only for that end. In the mean time, every body was mightily desirous to know what the Matter was; and there being al∣ways some, that pretend to refine upon Things beyond their Neighbours, a Report was spread a∣broad, That he had been put upon at the same rate as <HI>James Clement</HI> in former Times, tho' not in order to commit such a detestable Action as he did, but to acquaint His Majesty under so fair a covert, a great many things, that could not other∣wise reach his Ears. I do not speak this, as if I
<PB N="152" REF="305"/>
believ'd it; for I know very well, that these are only pleasant Whims, familiar to those, who, for want of business, employ their whole time in Com∣menting upon whatever happens.</P>
<P>However, according to the Ghost's Prediction, the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux</HI> endeavour'd to work the Secret out of the Blacksmith: But the Smith reply'd, That all his efforts upon that score would be fruitless, in regard he had a Lesson prescrib'd to him, which he was oblig'd to observe, under the pain of being punish'd upon the spot; but to shew that his advances were not Chimerical, he might give His Majesty to know, That the last time he Hunted at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> he was sud∣denly surpriz'd with an Apparition, which put him into a great astonishment; That the same Ghost which appear'd to him, had at that time appear'd to His Majesty, and that his Horse had seen it, and started aside, as if he would have thrown him; That the Apparition did not con∣tinue above a moment, which occasion'd His Ma∣jesty's apprehension, of being mistaken, and his speaking of it to no body; and that all this hapned to His Majesty only, in order to procure him ac∣cess to the King, by shewing, That he knew what none else in his Dominions was acquainted with. Upon these reasons, he hop'd His Majesty would make no difficulty in giving him Audi∣ence.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux</HI> was much surpriz'd at the hearing of such a Circumstance as that, which would quickly discover, whether there was any thing Supernatural in this Man's Pre∣tensions, or whether he was an Impostor. And, in earnest, if the King confirm'd the Matter of Fact, undoubtedly he must have known something beyond a Natural Capacity. The Marquis ac∣quainted the King with his Arrival, and with the Story he told; and all he had said, being, as 'tis
<PB N="153" REF="306"/>
alledg'd, found true, the King granted him a pri∣vate Audience. What pass'd in this Interview, no-body can tell, because 'twas kept as a profound Secret. All we know, is, That the pretended Prophet having stay'd some days at Court, while few knew that he had the honour to speak with the King; His Majesty agreed, that he should come and take leave of him publickly, when he took Coach to go a Hunting. The Duke of <HI>Duas,</HI> Captain of the Life-Guard, no sooner saw him, but he told the King, That if he had not order'd him to admit such a Fellow to approach His Per∣son, he had been far from doing it, because he was certainly a Fool, or else His Majesty was much put upon. A great many others about Court were of his Mind; for people are not easi∣ly convinc'd of such things as these. But the King took his part, and gave the Captain to know, that he was out in his Judgment, and that he had more Sense than he thought for.</P>
<P>This Expression was evidence, that he had told the King some very odd Things; for otherwise, the King would never have given himself the trouble to make such Declaration of his Thoughts. It awak'd the Curiosity of all Mankind; and e∣very-body would have given any thing to know the result of his Conference with His Majesty, and <HI>Barbesieux.</HI> The Marquis's Friends pump'd him upon the matter; but he told 'em frankly, that 'twas in vain, in regard there was something in the matter that challeng'd his Secrecy. The vulgar People, who are naturally very credulous, fancy'd, that his Business with the King, was to Preach up the suppression of the Imposts, that Necessity had oblig'd him to lay upon 'em, in the time of so cruel a War. The Prophet having ta∣ken leave of the King, return'd to his own Coun∣try; and the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux</HI> having given him Mony at his arrival, and order'd him to converse
<PB N="154" REF="307"/>
with no body repeated his Bounty to him when he went. So that the Prophet spoke nothing of the matter to any-body while he was there; and in∣deed, he could not well do it, if he would, for he was always kept within view.</P>
<P>Such an extraordinary Adventure as this did not fail to make a great deal of noise all over <HI>Paris,</HI> and even the whole Kingdom; but notwithstanding that the appearance of Prodigies ought to make People reflect upon their Duty; yet I do not find that this made any Reformation of Manners. De∣bauchery continued still to Reign among Men and Women; and the exemplary Piety of the King, and part of the Court, had no effect upon the Libertine Spirits. His Majesty, who, ever since his application to Devotion, has made it his Business to extirpate Vice, not only out of those about his Person, but even those who live at a distance, held at that time a Council of Con∣science, at which the Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and some other Prelates, with Father <HI>de la Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se</HI> his Confessor, were call'd to assist. In that Assemb∣ly, several methods were propos'd for preventing the usual disorders among the Officers and Sol∣diers. The Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> being a very z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lous Man, cry'd up His Majesty's pious Intention; and gave the rest to understand, that they ought to joyn all their Force in bringing it to bear. For this purpose, 'twas propos'd, That a Missionary should be sent to each Regiment, in order to Preach to 'em, and Catechise 'em every day. But it being answer'd, That Missionaries would scarce be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to undertake the Office, by reason of their neces∣sary Residence with the Regiments; another mo∣tion was made and agreed to. I know not indeed whether it has yet produc'd the desired effect but what is not yet done, may be done here after; and that Time will discover. The mo¦tion was, That none should be imploy'd as Al¦moners
<PB N="155" REF="308"/>
of Regiments, but those who are Persons of pious and good Lives, and who have Men of Merit to vouch for 'em: And that at the conclu∣sion of every Campagne they should be oblig'd to repair to the Seminaries, and continue there all Winter. To speak the truth, I must say this is an effectual Scheme for having no Almoners but such as are quite different from what they now are. But I question if they'll find any that will submit to that sort of Life. Most people put in for those Places only to divert themselves; and as soon as they find what constraint is mean'd 'em, they'll rather desert than submit to it. Pro∣bably that is the reason that the Thing is not yet put in Execution, and perhaps never will.</P>
<P>While measures were concerting for the intro∣ducing of such excellent Discipline among the Troops; one of these Almoners being imprison'd by the King's Order, in one of the Hospitals for the Poor, made a strange End after a very odd Life. He was a Recollet by Trade; but being uneasy under the confinement of a Convent, he procur'd a Dismission under the pretence of serv∣ing in this Imployment, which by Intrigues, and the Interest of Friends, he had obtain'd. He had continued in that Office some time; and as those who are once in any measure Corrupted, do quick∣ly become more Corrupt in an Army; so he form'd a design to render himself so necessary at Court, by a false Accusation, that he might be in a capacity to throw off his Habit which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with as much uneasiness as formerly he did the confinement of the Cloyster. He had his eye upon one, Abbot <HI>Agnan,</HI> who, of a Fryer, had made himself a Chymist Physician. He had a strong mind to follow his Example, not in practising Physick which he did not understand, but in wearing the Habit of a secular Priest, in∣stead of that of a Religious one. His Plea was,
<PB N="156" REF="309"/>
That since they had allow'd that Abbot to dis∣pense with his Vows upon the pretence of some Cures, he might obtain the same favour by some signal Service. Upon that view he repair'd to the Marquis of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> Secretary of State, who manag'd the Affairs of Religion, and pri∣vately acquainted him, That an Officer of the Re∣giment to which he was Almoner, had a design upon the King's Life: He knew that <HI>that</HI> Officer was oblig'd to go off then, or next morning, to some forreign Country, as well as a great many others who would not change their Religion. Nay, he had counsel'd him so to do, and promis'd to come and see him, tho' he mean'd nothing less.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> who is, in many things, the least of all the four Secretaries of State, if it be Lawful to call any thing <HI>little</HI> that's a∣bout so great a Prince, sent Orders immediately to Arrest the Officer, and commanded the Recollet to continue at Court. In the mean time, the Of∣ficer was gone, which the Recollet knew very well: However the Marquis being inform'd of his Departure, told the Recollet he was come too late, and that the Bird was flown three days be∣fore. The Recollet made Answer, That <HI>that</HI> was none of his fault, and that he could not do the Business sooner; That after all, he be∣liev'd he was only gone to <HI>Languedoc,</HI> his Native Country, where he would be sure to keep close; and that in regard, he told him most of his haunts, he believ'd he could unkennel him, if the Mar∣quis would sent him to that Country. The Mar∣quis continued still to believe what he said, and accordingly he send him to <HI>Languedoc,</HI> where the Recollet arriv'd very speedily, with the Mo∣ny he had got for the Charge of the Journey. He had a permission upon his going out of <HI>Paris</HI> to put on a Gentleman's Habit. But, at last, having drill'd on the Affair as long as he could; the
<PB N="157" REF="310"/>
Minister of State not offering to incourage him any longer, he return'd to this City, where he was inform'd, that the Marquis design'd to take him up. The Marquis begun to see thro' his Knavety, and would not suffer himself to be impos'd upon any longer. The Recollet came to know this piece of News very luckily. It fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l out, by chance, that in the very Inn at which he alighted, there was one of the Cousins of the Person he had accus'd, to whom Mr. <HI>de Chateau∣neuf</HI> had communicated his Thoughts. Now, this Relation had told Mr. <HI>deChateauneuf,</HI> that his Cousin was, indeed, a true Protestant; but he could be Surety, that he was not capable of the Thought he was charg'd with. At the same time, he had wrote to his Cousin, to know the truth of the thing; upon which, the Officer re∣ceiving such information, wrote himself to Mr. <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI> setting forth, That he was ready to return to <HI>France,</HI> to clear himself of the Accusation, if the King would grant him a Pass∣port, and Assurance that he should not be troubled upon the score of his retiring to a foreign Counn∣try, contrary to his Prohibition.</P>
<P>This Letter was but just receiv'd, and the Re∣lation having been at <HI>Versailles</HI> that day, told all the People about the Inn, the whole Story as a piece of acceptable News: But the Recollet was wiser than to discover what hand he had in the matter. Upon that, he drop'd his Design of go∣ing to wait upon Mr. <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> and took up at another Inn under a different Name from what he had before: Nay, further, he bought such a Cross as the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> wear, and put a white Feather in his Hat, and went by the Title of Mr. <HI>le Chevalier.</HI> The People of the first Inn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seeing him next day, were surpriz'd, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had told them nothing of his going. But, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the Officer's Kinsman had never sus∣pected
<PB N="185" REF="311"/>
him, if the Recollet had not said at Ta∣ble, that he came from <HI>Languedoc;</HI> for some∣body telling him so much, happen'd, by way of Jest, to say, That, perhaps, he was the Man he had been speaking of, and for that reason had deserted the Inn. Upon this, the Kinsman re∣turn'd next day to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to know what sort of a Man the Recollet was. Mr. <HI>Chateauneuf</HI>'s Description agreeing exactly with what he had seen, he acquainted the Minister with what pass'd at Table, and with the suspicion that he ground∣ed thereupon. Immediately the Secretary gave such express Orders for searching all the Inns in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Recollet could scarce escape: For the excellent Orders we have in this City, with reference to all strangers, whether in Inns, or private Lodgings, are so admirably well cal∣culated, that 'tis no great difficulty to make a narrow Enquiry: All the Landlords being oblig∣ed to give an account who are their Lodgers, and when they arriv'd; the Commissary of the Ward where the pretended Knight lodg'd, was inform∣ed by the Inn-keeper, that he had got a new Guest. Thereupon the Commissary observing the time of his arrival, to jump with that of the suspected Person's, he inform'd himself of his Features, and so took him up; so that his pre∣tended Knight-hood was not sufficient to keep him <HI>Incognito.</HI> Presently he was convey'd either to the <HI>Bastile</HI> or <HI>Vincennes,</HI> where he endeavour∣ed to make his escape; but being prevented, and being at the same time guilty of a horrid piece of Sacrilege, he was indited according to his de∣merit. The Recollets interceeded for him, to prevent the mortification of its being said in the World, That one of their Society was either Hang'd or Burnt. The King graciously granted their request, and exchang'd the Sentence of Death for that of perpetual Imprisonment. So
<PB N="159" REF="312"/>
he was put into the Hospital I spoke of but now; but he was no sooner got in, than he made a new Conspiracy with the other Russians to make their escape; now, this could scarce be effected without Killing him that brought 'em their Vi∣ctuals. But that being not the first Crime they had all been guilty of, they mutually agreed, that they should not stand to do it. In effect, they committed the Murder, and having made their escape, fled to the <HI>Palais Royal</HI> where they had an acquaintance by whom they expected to be entertain'd. But their Acquaintance abhorring the Crime they had committed, and knowing they had broke the Prison to which they had been com∣mitted by the King's Orders, refus'd to receive 'em. Thus they were oblig'd to look out for another hiding Place: But the Goal-Keeper be∣ing already at their Heels, they were quickly re∣taken and Tried. The poor Recollet, by vertue of the Interest of his Order, was only Condemn∣ed to the Galleys; but God not contented with this Punishment which was infinitely short of his demerit, did so order it, that the Gang offering to revolt against their Keepers, about fifteen or twenty Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> these shot upon 'em, and Kill'd the wretched Recollet. Such was his End, and the King having notice of it, was the more forward in reforming the Almo∣ners of the Army; for that he knew 'twas in that capacity that he first began to signalize him∣self by Debauchery and Corruptness,</P>
<P>In the mean time, we receiv'd the News of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Death, which gave the Potentates that desir'd a Peace, some occasion to fear some obstacle, or delay. But tho' his Successor was very young; and 'twas to be fear∣ed, that a great many Turmoils might fall out in that Kingdom, during his Minority; yet his Father's Will was so well order'd, that it put
<PB N="160" REF="313"/>
all to rights. His Son was declar'd to be <HI>Ma∣jor,</HI> or of Age, before the usual Term in <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> in order to discourage those who mean'd to disturb the State. At the same time, the young King's Grandmother being declar'd his Guardian by her Son's Will, took upon her the Ad∣ministration of the Government. The late King had nominated some Counsellors to assist her; among the rest the Count of <HI>Bielke,</HI> a zealous favourer of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> who had been formerly Ambassador at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and was disoblig'd there. However, it being fear'd that he might endeavour to disturb our Game, perhaps as much out of private resent∣ment, as any intention to serve the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> Count; <HI>d'Avaux,</HI> the most Christian King's Ambassador in that Country, had orders to have a watchful Eye upon his Conduct. I know not whether it was the bad Offices done him by Count <HI>d'Avaux,</HI> or his being guilty of several unwarrantable Practices when he was Governor of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> that brought him quickly to be disgrac'd; but, in fine, he perceiving that he was like to sink under the Power of his Enemies, wrote to one of his Nephews in <HI>France,</HI> to in∣treat his Maiesty to forget what was past, and grant him the honour of his Protection. Im∣mediately, upon the receipt of the Letter, his Nephew spoke of it to the King: And the Count's hopes were not frustrated; for the King allow∣ed him to come to <HI>France,</HI> pursuant to his re∣quest; but the Letter, by which his Nephew gave him this Advice, being intercepted by some of his Enemies, he was taken up.</P>
<P>At that time, Mr. <HI>Lasun</HI> had only two Oc∣cupations, namely, Pleading and Gaming. But as he grew Old, Fortune, which only serves Youth, became as unfavourable to him as it had formerly been kind. 'Twas computed, that in
<PB N="161" REF="314"/>
the space of three or four Months he lost a∣bove sixty thousand Pistols. 'Tis certain he lost a great deal; but it being known that sixty thou∣sand Pistols, in the <HI>Gascogne</HI> way of speaking, does not amount to above five or six thousand, others concluded that his loss might terminate there. He was likewise cast in a Law-Suit a∣gainst Madam <HI>Fremont,</HI> and her Son; and was more cast down upon that, than upon his loss at Game; for he still hop'd to regain the lat∣ter, but the Judgment against him excluded all hopes of relief. Besides, he was troubled that he had made such a noise about it, both at Court, and in the City, without better success. All his Friends endeavoured to comfort him; and, to speak the truth, they were not much dissatis∣fied with the rub he met with, because they hop'd it would facilitate his Accommodation with Marshal <HI>de Lorges</HI> and his Lady. But stiffness is so natural to old People, that their hopes vanish'd in Smoak. He was a turbulent sort of a Man all his Life-time; insomuch, that he oftentimes thwarted the King: and he would not then disclaim that Quality, tho', indeed, 'twas none of the best. The Judgment pro∣nounced against him, related only to the Questi∣on, whether he was to plead before the Court of <HI>Aydes,</HI> or that of <HI>Requests.</HI> Now, being re∣mitted to the last, which was the thing he on∣ly wanted to avoid, he resolv'd to plead his Cause there, tho' he should meet with the same success that happen'd to him in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Tho', after all' I know not what reason he had to fear any such thing; for he shew'd, by his Car∣riage before them, that he fear'd K. <HI>William</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch less than them.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="315"/>
However, he was not the only Courtier that lov'd to be litigious. The P. of <HI>Epinois</HI> fol∣low'd his Example very close. He commenc'd a Suit before the Council against the Prince of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> for the succession to the Vicounty of <HI>Gand,</HI> to which they were equally related. The case had been already decided by the Par∣liament of <HI>Rouan,</HI> in favour of the Prince of <HI>Bournonville.</HI> But great Lords are more liable to the pursuit of ill Causes than others, be∣cause their Intendants and Agents want only to have 'em ingag'd to a disadvantage, that they may fish in troubled Waters. His true Friends gave him to know, That they fear'd he would he cast before the Council, as well as before the Par∣liament. Upon this, he redoubled his Sollici∣tations, hoping by his Intrigues and diligence to gain what he was apprehensive of losing in the Court of Justice. The two Princesses, his Wife and his Mother, took care likewise to make use of their Friends. His Wife endea∣voured to perswade 'em, that she desired nothing but Justice, hoping to blind 'em by their re∣spect for her Quality. But the Mother was less presumptuous, whether 'twas that she thought she was no longer to be consider'd as a Prin∣cess, having the Reputation of being married to a Lawyer, or that she was sensible of the weakness of her Son's Cause: Accordingly she confin'd her hopes to the Interest of her pre∣tended Husband. The P. of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> for his part, was not asleep, being sensible that he had to do with a strong party: But 'twould be a great folly in Judges to have more re∣gard to Interest than Justice; and all that the Prince <HI>D'Epinois,</HI> and his whole Family could do, could not prevent his being fin'd, and oblig'd to pay the Costs. Indeed the Debate lasted a∣bove
<PB N="163" REF="316"/>
five Hours, because some of the Judges had a mind to oblige 'em.</P>
<P>The Countess of <HI>Grignan</HI> being then at <HI>Paris,</HI> went to see the Dutchess of <HI>Or∣leans</HI> at St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> who had Dislocated her Arm, by a Fall from her Horse at Hunt∣ing: But she was so ill receiv'd, that she did not care to go again for a long time. That Princess came to that House, after her Arm had been set by a Country Sur∣geon, that perform'd his Office not amiss: But being still much Pain'd, she was so angry at the Countess's saying to her, That she came to Congratulate the dis∣pelling of her Illness, that she was very near kicking her out of her Presence. The Princess, who seldom disguises Na∣ture, check'd her so severely, that the Countess, upon her return to <HI>Paris,</HI> made it known to all her Friends, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> came to hear of it. His Royal Highness told his Lady, That she was in the wrong; but she was so un∣capable of listning to Reason in the case she was in, that there was a necessity of waiting till she was well, before she could be convinced of an Error, in having us'd that Lady at sueh a rate.</P>
<P>The Month of <HI>August</HI> came on soon af∣ter; and the Jesuits, in pursuance of their
<PB N="164" REF="317"/>
usual Custom, had a Tragedy Acted in their College of <HI>Louis le Grand;</HI> So 'tis now call'd; the Names of the The Col∣lege of <HI>Clermont,</HI> or of <HI>Jesus</HI> being quite sunk. The Passion that the good Fathers had for insinuating themselves in the King's Favour, made them prefer Flattery to Gratitude. They have forgot, that their Founders oblig'd them to put their Name upon the Gate, and have put up another in its place; which, indeed, is infinitely greater, and more illustrious than <HI>Clermont</HI>'s; but, at the same time, did not want Panegyrists enough besides them, to transmit it with Honour to Posterity: So that the World did not pardon such an Action; for they had no sooner taken down the Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> from above their great Gate, than two Latin Verses were Published which are well enough known in the World; but there being several that have not seen them, 'twill not be altogether improper to insert them here, and to preserve the Memory of them if it were capable to be lost: They are as followeth.<Q><L>Sustulit hinc Jesum, Posuit{que} insignia Regis,</L><L>Impia Genes; alium non habt illa Deum.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="318"/>
The meaning of these Verses, is, That this So∣ciety in which Impiety reigns, took down the Name of Jesus, and put up the King's Arms; and so ne∣ver recogniz'd any other God than the Kings of the Earth. I am very far from saying that this is a truth. Nay, I should rather affirm, that Piety reigns among 'em instead of Impiety: but considering that they have many Enemies, we must not be surpris'd if they have recourse to some Imposture or other, when the smallest Faults they can be guilty of, are charg'd upon 'em with Reproach. However, <HI>Mon∣sieur</HI> being invited to the abovemention'd Tragedy, he and the whole Court honour'd it with their Pre∣sence; upon which Father <HI>Jai,</HI> who has a great Genius for that sort of Representation, complimen∣ted him on the behalf of the Rector of that Col∣lege, setting forth, that if the Performance pleas'd him, all the Honour of it was due to him. The good Father made a long tedious Speech, screwing in several Panegyricks upon the late Duke of <HI>S. Ag∣nan,</HI> who was not only a great lover of Acting, but so good an Actor, that upon occasion he acted all the different Parts one after another. Having spoke all that he had to say, he took leave, and went to cause the Representation to be begun. But when every one was pricking up his Ears, that they might not lose one word of the Performance, this mighty Inventer fell out with his Fidlers, insomuch, that instead of Playing, they put up their Instru∣ments, and offer'd to go away. Father <HI>Jai</HI> being touch'd with the Affront they thus put upon him, preach'd to 'em, and catechiz'd 'em, in order to make 'em alter their Resolution. But after he had thus acted the part of a Preacher, a Trade that in the mean time he knew nothing of, he at last came to threaten 'em with his Arms, where his greater Excellency lay. He gave the Musicians to know, that the least they could expect, was, to have their Instruments broke over their Heads. But all this did

<PB N="162" REF="321"/>
not soften them: They still insisted on their Reso∣lution to be gone; so that the poor Father was forc'd to have recourse to <HI>Monsieur</HI> to make 'em comply. Accordingly <HI>Monsieur</HI> interpos'd his Au∣thority, and the Musicians did for him what they refus'd to do for the Father: Then the Tragedy was begun, but its end was much of a piece with the Prelude. For several People quarell'd, and were so warm, that they stood in need of <HI>Monsieur</HI>'s Authority to restrain 'em. However, the Matter was accommodated without <HI>Monsieur</HI>'s Intervention; and the King who loves to be inform'd of all that passes in <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>Versailles,</HI> no sooner had an ac∣count of the Adventures at this Tragedy, but he said a word of <HI>Monsieur</HI> that sounded well enough. He turn'd to some Lords that were laughing at this Adventure, and said, <HI>The Court had been long a Suf∣ferer by the less of the Duke of</HI> S. Agnan, <HI>but thank God</HI> Monsieur <HI>was about to repair their loss.</HI> In effect, this Duke was all his life-long a Judge among the Musicians of <HI>Paris;</HI> he was so far from thinking that Office to be beneath his Quality, that on the other hand he thought nothing more proper for him, pleading that the Players on the Violin not only con∣tributed to Gallantry, but were in a manner the necessary Instruments to carry it on; and thinking that himself exceeded all other Men in Gallantry, he upon that score laid claim to the Government of them, entitling himself to a preference to all others.</P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Orleans</HI> did not keep his Anger long; whether it was that he was sensible of his Error in being angry, or that he was not apt to continue a Resentment long. He return'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> whither he brought his Nephew. But his Nephew, who would not sacrifice his Hopes of a Bishoprick to the love he had for his Uncle, renew'd his Addresses to Father <HI>de la Chaise,</HI> and to the King. At that time several Bishopricks were Vacant, and among others,
<PB N="163" REF="322"/>
the Bishoprick of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which is none of the most inconsiderable Sees in the Kingdom; for besides that the Bishop of that place is at the same time Prince of the Empire, and has a right to put the Sword as well as the Mitre in his Arms, like the Ecclesiastick Electors, the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> and several other Princes; his Incomes amount to almost 80000 Livres a Year. The eldest Brother of the late Duke of <HI>Feuillade</HI> had succeeded to it, when the Duke of <HI>Verneuil,</HI> who had enjoy'd it from his Youth, married Duke <HI>Sulli</HI>'s Widow. The Abbot of <HI>Coaslin</HI> scarce made any Pretensions to it, in con∣sideration of what had pass'd: But the King, who commonly takes pleasure in granting unexpected Favours, bestow'd that Dignity upon him, to the great astonishment of all <HI>France,</HI> and even of his own Family. This entirely put an end to what chagrin the Bishop of <HI>Orleans</HI> retain'd upon the score of the Bank. However, his Majesty, who never does a Favour by halves, observing that neither this new Prelate, nor his Family, were in a Condition to raise the 20000 Crowns that he was oblig'd to send to <HI>Rome</HI> for his Bulls; his Majesty, I say, ta∣king this into Consideration, intreated the Pope by a Letter under his own Hand, to let this Prelate have his Bulls <HI>gratis.</HI> If the King had gratified him with this rich Benefice five or six Months later than he did, he might have sav'd himself the trouble of writing to <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Bishop of <HI>Orleans</HI> was made Cardinal before that time, and the Cardinal's Ne∣phews never pay for their Bulls, that being a Privi∣lege among many others that is tack'd to the Purple. The Pope did not deny his Majesty so small a Re∣quest; so that the new Bishop receiving his Bulls <HI>gratis,</HI> was suddenly capable to keep his Father's Coach from being seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d again. Since our Parents are the first Poor that we ought to relieve, and since his Father wanted his Assistance, 'twas his Duty to begin with him in the Dispensation of his Wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="323"/>
The <HI>Tuilleries</HI> are the place of Rendezvous for all the Persons of Quality of Fortune in <HI>Paris:</HI> And at present, 'tis a Custom among the Ladies, as well as the Gentlemen, to keep Footmen from 25 to 30 Years of Age; and commonly at the Gates and Doors there stands such a numerous quantity of Footmen, as upon occasion would make a Recruit of 4 or 5000 Men. Now, these Gentlemen Lac∣quies having the daily Opportunity of seeing the Freaks and Intrigues of their Mistrisses, and having no great reason to entertain a very good Opinion of 'em, one may know the History of each Lady by hearing their Conferences. At that time, one of these Comical Fellows said to his Fellow Servants, that if they would give him a Bottle of Wine, he would lift up the Coats of the first Lady that came out. They readily agreed to give that reward for such a nice piece of Diversion. In the mean time, Mademoiselle <HI>d' Armagnac,</HI> and the Marchioness <HI>de Villequier</HI> came out together; and the Footman, probably not knowing who they were, offer'd to perform upon them the Insolence he had promis'd. The Ladies surpriz'd with the unaccount∣able Brutality, cry'd out for help, and stopp'd the Footman themselves; several Persons of Quality alighting from their Coaches, assisted them to prevent the Fellow's making his Escape; upon this he was imprison'd▪ Some Judges were for putting him to Death, to scare those of his Kidney from such lewd∣ness; but others thought the Pillory and the Gallies a sufficient Punishment for what he had done. And thus he was only order'd to go and serve the King in the Gallies; though, to speak the truth, his Inso∣lence deserv'd another sort of usage. However, that wretched sort of Cattel entertain'd the Publick very often with Scenes of this nature, which were still worse when they wore Swords. Every day they were guilty of some Insolence or other, and there was a great deal of reason for forbidding 'em
<PB N="165" REF="324"/>
the use of Swords. The occasion of that Prohibi∣tion was the Father of Monsieur <HI>Tilladet,</HI> whom they kill'd, and so stopp'd the Course of his Fortune, which perhaps would have gone further than that of his Children, because he had married the Sister of the late Monsieur <HI>le Tellier.</HI> 'Tis true, he was not al∣ways in good terms with him. That Minister, whose Projects bore a Proportion to his Fortune, pretend∣ed to Marry his Sister better than to a little Gentle∣man of <HI>Gascony.</HI> But young Ladies often Marry without their Friends Consent, and she particularly dispos'd of her self without consulting him upon the matter. This was the occasion of their misun∣derstanding. But as time sinks all Differences, so his Brother-in-law and he were good Friends when that accident happen'd.</P>
<P>At that time the Dutchess of <HI>Feuillade</HI> dy'd; and her Death was not much regreated by her Husband, who, if we believe the common Report, liv'd so indifferently with her, that he never injoy'd her. But though he did not lament her loss, all that knew her did, for she was a very amiable Lady, and never gave any occasion to talk of her. Besides, she was very Young, being not above 20 Years of Age. But there are some invincible Antipathies; and 'tis plain, the Duke was not of a Temper suit∣able to her, since he did not respect what all the World pronounc'd lovely. It seems he likewise de∣spis'd her Alliance; though, to speak the truth, there were a great many of as good Families as his at least, who would willingly have married Ladies that had not so much to boast of as she. For if 'tis true, that a Family is render'd Illustrious by the past or present Possession of great Places; we shall scarce find one in the Kingdom, at least retaining to the Law, that could equal this. It produc'd six or seven Secretaries of State, and at present boasts of three. This Lady was the Daughter of the Mar∣quiss of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> who, indeed, is but a little
<PB N="166" REF="325"/>
Secretary of State, in comparison with the other three. But as there are no little Saints in Paradise, because God, who is infinitely Great, communicates somewhat of himself to those who have serv'd him faithfully, so there's no such thing, as a little Secre∣tary of State, under the greatest King in <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while, Marshal <HI>Boufflers</HI> and my Lord <HI>Port∣land</HI> having remov'd a great many Difficulties by their Conferences; the King in concert with the Emperor, propos'd to keep <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and to give up to his Imperial Majesty that Part of <HI>Brisack</HI> that lies beyond the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The City of <HI>Strasbourg</HI> did not belong to the Emperor, and by right it ought to have return'd to the Inhabitants, who were Pro∣prietors of it, before the King had it. This Inno∣vation did not please the Princes of the Empire, especially those situated on this side the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or just by the other. But great Princes do not much mind little ones, when their own Interest is in the case; and upon that foot the Consent of the King of <HI>England</HI> was enough to make it bear. 'Tis al∣ledg'd that that Prince consented to it, only upon the hopes that his satisfying the King of <HI>France</HI> in a thing that he desir'd so passionately, would move his most Christian Majesty to give him ano∣ther recompence that he on the other side, was as eager to obtain He did not like King <HI>James</HI>'s con∣tinuing at St. <HI>Germains,</HI> thinking that place to lie too near <HI>Versailles.</HI> And upon a parallel Case, <HI>Crom∣well</HI> who was not short of him in Politicks, us'd all his Interest in his time to oblige his Majesty to re∣move from his Court, not only the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> who after his Father's Misfortune had fled to <HI>Paris,</HI> but likewise the Queen his Mother. Accordingly he obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his end with reference to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and even the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> his Brother, who had likewise fled thither; but as to the Queen he could never gain his Point there, notwithstanding that he wheedled Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> with the Proposal of a
<PB N="167" REF="326"/>
Marriage between his own Son and one of the Cardinal's Nieces. For that Princess made a vigo∣rous Opposition against this Minister's Proposal of her removal from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and would never consent to it, notwithstanding the great Ad∣vantages accruing to her upon that Condition, particularly a large Pension from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Portland</HI> gave the Marshal some hint of his Master's Design, with a good Address. The Mar∣shal, who is not so much a Statesman as a good Ser∣vant to the King, had nevertheless Sense enough up∣on this Occasion to give him some hopes of succeed∣ing without going too far. However, People being always apt to flatter themselves, my Lord was per∣swaded, That the King could not refuse what King <HI>William</HI> desir'd, after the Condescention in the Af∣fair of <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> and nothing was thought of upon both sides, but the Execution of what these two Ministers should agree upon. The Princes of the Empire were still displeas'd; they could not forbear complaining that the Article relating to <HI>Strasbourg</HI> was contrary to the Preliminaries of the Peace; they knew very well that the first thing de∣manded of Monsieur <HI>Cailleres</HI> before the Commence∣ment of the Conferences with him, was the Resti∣tution of <HI>Lorrain, Strasbourg,</HI> and <HI>Luxembourg.</HI> The Emperor's Ministers answer'd to this, That the King's Conquest of <HI>Barcelona</HI> had chang'd the Face of Affairs, that he demanded an Equivalent, and that considering how things stood, 'twas well for them that he was contented with so little. They were glad they had this Pretence to cover the Ad∣vantage accruing to their Master by that new Pro∣posal. In fine, they saw very well, that after all <HI>Europe</HI> had drain'd it self in carrying on the War, the House of <HI>Austria</HI> were the only Gainers by it. But the Princes of the Empire, who did not ap∣prove of these Reasons, could not comply so easily with the Proposal. They sollicited the Emperor and
<PB N="168" REF="327"/>
the Mediators, to get that Clause alter'd that seem'd to be so disadvantageous to them. His Imperial Ma∣jesty did not mind them; for that in granting their Request, he should have acted contrary to his own Interest. The Mediators gave no other excuse, but that all <HI>Europe</HI> stood equally in need of a Peace, and that the Cession of all on this side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and stipulating a Restitution of all on the other side, was the best Expedient, both to put a speedy end to the present War, and to prevent a future Rup∣ture.</P>
<P>Neither their Answer, nor that of the Emperors, gave 'em any Satisfaction. They fansy'd the Medi∣ators were influenc'd by <HI>France;</HI> at least they per∣swaded themselves, that if the late King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had been still alive, he would never have tamely suffer'd things to pass so. Being thus prepossess'd with the apprehension of the great Prejudice accruing to them from the Peace, they did not comply very early. While the respective Parties were busi'd in managing their several Pretensions, the Affairs of <HI>Poland</HI> were brought to that Confusion, that 'twas thought they would never be adjusted without a Civil War. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cardinal Primate sent a Courier to <HI>France,</HI> to know what was the reason that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not come to take the Crown upon his Head. He represented, that his Interest suffer'd mightily by his apparent Indifferency in ly∣ing quiet at <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or the Court, at a time when <HI>Poland</HI> was in a Combustion out of Respect and Love to him. That the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was not wanting in reaping a mighty Advantage by it; that he de∣bauch d those of his Party, upon the Plea that 'twould be folly to adhere any longer to a <HI>Prince</HI> that deserted 'em in that manner; that his Presence in <HI>Poland</HI> was desir'd beyond Expression; and that on the other hand, the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was so hated, that upon the Prince's Arrival every body would side with him out of spite to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="328"/>
The Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> gave the Court to know as much by every Courier he sent. At last, the King having call'd a Council upon the matter, re∣solv'd that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> should go immediate∣ly to that Country. And in regard he could not expect a good Reception without carrying Money with him, his Majesty gave him Bills of Exchange for 2000000, besides 10000 <HI>Louis-d'ores,</HI> for petty Occasions. The Peace was then not made, and 'twas possible it might fail, by reason of the Interest of the Princes of the Empire, who still oppos'd it with great Warmth and Resolution. Upon this ac∣count 'twas question'd by many, how the Prince should get with safety into <HI>Poland.</HI> To go there <HI>in∣cognito</HI> was at once dishonourable and dangerous, and to do it by open force was impossible, the Ene∣mies Fleet being at Sea, which all the Power of <HI>France</HI> could not cope with. But notwithstanding the Strength of their Fleet, the Kng fitted out Squadrons every Day, which not only got off clear, but were continually annoying them by taking Prizes. And accordingly a Squadron was order'd to Transport the Prince: <HI>John Bart</HI> having taken upon him to Conduct the Prince, took care to make the Squadron ready by Orders from Court. 'Twas fitted out at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the Allies having notice of it, sent 14 Ships to that Road, to hinder any thing to go in, or come out. This Obstacle did not amuse <HI>John Bart,</HI> though another would have been much perplex'd with it. 'Tis not known how the Enemy had such an early Intelligence of the Design, for the King kept it so secret that no body in <HI>France</HI> knew of it, till within two Days before the time of his Departure. However, it seems, it came by Spies, of which they had a great many every where, especially at the Sea-Ports.</P>
<P>But that Trade was more hazardous than <HI>Bart</HI>'s Expedition, though at the same time it was attend∣ed by a great deal of Danger. For one of these Spie
<PB N="170" REF="329"/>
was taken up, not long before, in the same place where this Squadron was fitted out; and considering the risque he run, 'tis not imaginable how little he got by it. One <HI>Couture,</HI> a <HI>Paris-</HI>Councellor, a Man of little Practice, and a narrow Fortune, being in∣veigled by a Woman, that either had debauch'd him, or had been debauch'd by him, went a strow∣ling up and down the Country with her. There he try'd several Trades that did not agree very well with the Bar; but being bred to Harangue and De∣claim, he at last listed himself among a Company of strowling Actors, which after a great many turnings and windings brought him to the <HI>French Flanders;</HI> there he acted his Parts, and coming afterwards to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> met there with a Man that having known him at <HI>Paris,</HI> represented to him the scandalousness of his Imployment. The Counsellor-Actor made answer, <HI>That 'twas easy to talk of things, but when a Man had nothing, he was oblig'd to do what he could.</HI> Thereupon his Friend gave him to know, that if he would trust him, he would find him a better Trade, in which he might earn his Bread with less La∣bour. The Counsellor being not over-satisfied with the Trade he was then in, took him at his word; upon which his Friend said, <HI>They behov'd to drink together, before he could speak farther upon the Matter.</HI> Having carried him to a Tavern, he acquainted him over a Glass, That he had several Relations in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were great Traders, and were every day annoy'd with the Prizes made by the <HI>French</HI> Ships; that they would willingly give 2000 Livers a Year to any Man that would engage to give 'em timely notice what Ships are fitting out from <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI> and St. <HI>Maloes;</HI> that if he would find a Friend to reside in one of these places, while himself con∣tinued in the other, he would see that Sum paid him; and that there was no great Difficulty or La∣bour in the performance of what was desir'd. 'Tis possible, he likewise set forth to him, that in under∣taking
<PB N="171" REF="330"/>
that Office, he would do a charitable Acti∣on, by preserving so many honest Men from Ruin. However the Counsellor accepted the offer, and settled one <HI>Martin</HI> for his Sub-delegate at St. <HI>Maloes,</HI> allowing him 500 Livres a Year: Himself con∣tinued at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> waiting till he could find out another Deputy for the same price, that so he might go to <HI>Paris;</HI> and there injoy the remaining 1000 Livres of his Pension. Accordingly he found one in a little time. But his other Deputy, Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> being a Man of no great Head, and his Office requiring an Infinity of Sense and Precaution, he was soon suspected by the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Maloes.</HI> Tho' he colour'd his Residence in that place with a pre∣tence of some small Commerce and Trade, that he had taken up only for a feint; yet they observing his Diligence and Curiosity in going every Day to the Haven to see what was done there, immediately gave the Court notice of him. The Court sent Orders to have a watchful Eye upon him. At last, their Suspicion being still inflam'd by his Conduct, they stopp'd his Letters at the Post-house, which were address'd to <HI>Couture</HI> at one Madam <HI>Clerc</HI>'s in <HI>Paris.</HI> At the same time, Letters were sent to <HI>Cou∣ture</HI> from his other Correspondent at <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> Both these were open'd, and afterwards seal'd so artifici∣ally, that he could not discover it. They observ'd that both the Correspondents made mention of some Naval Preparations at these two places, and were very particular in their Accounts. After that, 'twas found that the use he made of their Intelligence, was to convey the same to <HI>Holland.</HI> This being sufficient Evidence, they were all three taken up: Poor <HI>S. Martin</HI> fearing to be broken on the Wheel, or at least hang'd, would not stay till he was exa∣min'd; but threw himself headlong over a Rock, upon which he was imprison'd. <HI>Couture</HI>'s Mother having married a Council-Barrister for her second Husband, had so much Interest at Court, as to get

her Son's Punishment converted into perpetual Im∣prisonment: By which means the <HI>Dunkirk-</HI>Deputy got off at the same rate. And so there was an end of the Story.</P>
<P>To return. 'Tis very probable the Enemy disco∣ver'd Monsieur <HI>Bart</HI>'s Design by some such means. However, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ships coming before <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> watch'd Night and Day, for fear the Man that had already trick'd 'em so often, should boast once more of playing them a new trick. The day before the Prince's Departure, the King was two Hours with him in private in the Castle of <HI>Marli;</HI> and there be∣ing no Witnesses of what past between 'em, we can only make Conjectures about it. What can we ima∣gine it to be? unless we say, That his Majesty, who is so well vers'd in the Art of Government, gave him Lessons how to behave upon his Arrival in the Kindgdom he was call'd to, in case the Sub∣jects should prove as affectionate as they were re∣presented to be, as well as in case they should prove otherwise, which the Prince was very apprehen∣sive of. For all their Intelligence from <HI>Poland,</HI> by any other Hands than the Cardinal Primate, and the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> gave a contrary Account of things to what these two Ministers did. All the Mer∣chants Letters from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and the other neigh∣bouring Places, spoke of nothing but of the great number of Creatures retaining to the Duke of <HI>Sax∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny.</HI> The Letters that came to the Marchioness of <HI>Bethunes,</HI> spoke to the same purpose; but when any body ask'd her what they contain'd, she spoke as dubiously as she could, leaving them to guess more than she had a mind to tell. Those who were quick∣sighted knew the cause of her Silence; but they made no use of it, knowing that one is never thank'd for telling disagreeable News.</P>
<P>All this did not hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the Prince to set out. He took with him no Persons of Note or Distinction, unless you put the <HI>Chevalier</HI>'s <HI>de Lausun</HI> and <HI>Sill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="332"/>
in that Rank; but the one being as poor as a Rat, let his Family be what it will, and the other being a Cadet as well as he, and one whose Family has nothing but a Chancellor for its greatest Orna∣ment, I thought I might dispense with the giving 'em that Title. The latter assum'd the Name of Count <HI>Silleri</HI> at his Departure, either because he hop'd the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> whose Domestick he was, would raise him to a great Fortune now he was call'd to a Throne; or because having declar'd his Marri∣age with the Daughter of an Auditor of the Ac∣counts, that brought him some Money, he had a mind to leave her a more honourable Title than that of a Chevalier's Lady. The Eve before the Prince's Departure, he receiv'd the Visits of all the Court, who came to take leave of him. At Night he supp'd with the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> his Father-in-Law, and his whole Family; after which, a great many Tears were shed, as if they should never see him again. Perhaps, they knew that he could not set that Crown upon his Head without coming to the Point of the Sword, and consequently that he had many Dangers to go through. And in earnest that consideration is more than sufficient to alarm those who are concern'd for a Person; so that if Tears be allowable upon any occasion, they are upon this. The Princess of <HI>Conti</HI> appear'd to be less mov'd than the rest; or at least, if she shed any Tears, they were not so bitter as they might have been. Though there was no body that was so nearly concern'd for the Prince as her self; yet she thought it her Duty to behave her self so, as to seem worthy of the great Fortune to which she aspir'd. Not that she did not love the Prince very tenderly; but be∣sides this her Ambition, and the Desire of being a Queen, that had so great a place in her Soul, she was not ill pleas d to see the Prince go from Court. She knew too well that he was amorous to a foolish degree; and fed her self with the hopes that the re∣moval
<PB N="174" REF="333"/>
of his Mistriss from his Eyes, would unhinge his Affection for her.</P>
<P>The Prince rid Post to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> his Equipage being sent before with all possible Expedition. The Coffer which contain'd the 10000 Pistols that the King gave him, happen'd to be broke underneath, and the Purse in which they were being turn'd upside down, a great many of 'em were dropp'd about two are three Leagues from <HI>Paris.</HI> By chance, 'twas upon a Market-day that they were lost; and the <HI>Gonnesse</HI> Bakers having found 'em, no sooner understood whose they were, than they deliver'd 'em up; for one of the Prince's Pages had come back to know if any body had found 'em. 'Tis alledg'd, that the Prince had purposely left 3 or 400 Pistols out of the Bag, and put them in that sorry Coffer, in order to leave with those that found 'em an eternal Memorial of his Departure from <HI>France.</HI> 'Tis true, he is likely enough to do such a thing, for he's as generous a Prince as any about the Court: And for that rea∣son, 'twas said of him, that if he shew'd himself to be of the House of <HI>Conde</HI> by his Bravery, he would not do it by his Generosity. He took nothing to himself; and 'twas such a Prince as he that the <HI>Poles</HI> wanted, in order, to sink the Memory of the Avarice of their late King, or rather to make 'em sensible how advantageous his earlier Arrival at the Throne had been to them; for he would never have sold a Palatinate, or any other Place; his Hu∣mour was too much a stranger to the sordid Mea∣sures of their late King, or at least, if ever he should take up with them, he must needs be very much alter'd. <HI>Bart</HI> had prepar d every thing for putting to Sea, and scarce allow'd the Prince a few hours Sleep, till he weigh'd Anchor with a fair Wind. He pass'd by his Enemies, without being perceiv'd; and steer'd on his Course without any Opposition; for they knew nothing of his passing till 'twas too late to pursue him.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="334"/>
All the Northern Princes were mightily concern'd about the Transactions in <HI>Poland,</HI> for all of 'em had Affairs to adjust with that Crown. However, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> did not act up to the Measures of the rest, who earnestly desir'd that the Duke of <HI>Sax∣ony</HI> should be preferr'd to this Prince; for he would never grant Audience to a Minister that the Duke sent to sollicit him to hinder the Prince to enter the <HI>Baltick.</HI> He put him off with trifling Amuse∣ments, till the Prince had past the <HI>Sundt,</HI> and then gave Audience to the Envoy; after which, he wait∣ed with Patience and Tranquillity, till God should decide an Affair of that consequence as he pleas'd. Some indeed alledge that he offer'd underhand some Ships to the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> and that the Prince only thank'd him for his good will, because he thought he had no occasion for 'em, and that the Success of his Expedition depended rather upon the Affection and good Will of the <HI>Poles,</HI> than upon any Succours he could receive from any other hand but the King, his Master. After all, the Prince arriv'd before <HI>Dantzick,</HI> being incourag'd to hope that the Inhabitants of that City would open their Gates to him. This City was to him, as 'twere, the Key of <HI>Poland;</HI> especially if he should be oblig'd to di∣spute his Title to that Crown upon the point of the Sword. 'Twas by that place only that he could expect Succours from <HI>France,</HI> since these could not come otherwise than by Sea. But instead of an∣swering his Expectation, the Citizens sent Deputies to intreat him not to come ashoar in their Territo∣ries; by reason that in the present State of Affairs, they could not declare either for him, or the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> without exposing themselves to great ha∣zards. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not construe their Words literally, but as he ought to have done. He presently perceiv'd that their Words insinuated all the Enmity to him that could be; and that they had only disguis'd their real Sentiments for fear of
<PB N="176" REF="335"/>
displeasing the King, whose Power they were too well acquainted with, to draw it upon their own Heads. At the same time, some <HI>French</HI> Merchants that were settled there, came on Board his Ship, to offer him their Service in what their Power could reach, and assur'd him that his Sentiments of the Matter were very just. Nay, they gave him to know that the City had enter'd into a strict Alliance with the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> by the Mediation of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> who had set it on foot as soon as he re∣ceiv'd Advice of his Election; That if they might freely disclose their Thoughts to him, they would not advise him to go ashoar any where, without a strong <HI>French</HI> Army to guard his Person: That they knew not what Reports might have been spread abroad to perswade his Highness to come so far, but they were afraid he would only have the trouble of returning without effecting any thing: That the <HI>Poles</HI> who were formerly Friends to the <HI>French,</HI> began to take up the same Passion against them that other Nations had: That the Glory of the King had struck them with fear as well as the others: That they were made to believe that the King aspir'd to an Universal Monarchy; and that the fear of becoming his Subjects, scar'd them from preferring a Prince of his Blood to their Throne.</P>
<P>Though these Merchants had not given this Ac∣count to the Prince, he had quickly found it out himself. Instead of that croud of new Subjects that the Cardinal Primate had made him to expect be∣fore his Departure from <HI>France,</HI> there came scarce any one to visit him on Board; most of those that came, were only mov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so to do by their Curiosi∣ty; so that excepting a very small number that of∣fer'd to pay him the usual Honours of Soveraignty, and treated him as King, there was no body that did any thing like it: But he would never suffer either these, or his own Retinue to do it, for fear
<PB N="177" REF="336"/>
his Reign should be short-liv'd. He gave them to know, that he was not so over-fond of a Crown, as to purchase it at the Expence of his Honour; that he only came thither in compliance with the Car∣dinal Primate's Request to Succour their Nation; which, as he alledg'd, the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> mean'd to oppress by a boundless Ambition; that the Car∣dinal had promis'd to draw together an Army out of hand to inable him to satisfy his desire; that when he should have done what he pretended to in serving them, he would not then declin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Title of their Defender; but as for that of King he would never accept of it, till things were upon another foot than what they were at that time; and indeed they could not be upon a worse foot than they were, with Reference to him. The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> after his being proclaim'd King by his own Party, had not only possess'd himself of the City and Castle of <HI>Cracow,</HI> but likewise of that of <HI>War∣saw,</HI> where the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> us'd to Reside. He had got himself Crown'd in one of these two places, partly by Force, and partly by good Will; while the Cardinal Primate protested equally against his Coronation and his Election.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> finding that the Duke was thus Master of the Heart of the Country, and that <HI>Dantzick</HI> was but too partial to him, us'd all his Efforts to gain the Governor of <HI>Mariembourg,</HI> a place that was not far distant from the place where he was. Could he have master'd that, and been succour'd by his Party, he would have made it a place of Arms. The Governor of that place made as if he listen'd to his Proposal, in order to make him speak <HI>French;</HI> but the Prince being not in a Humour to do it without seeing further into Affairs, gave him only conditional Promises; upon which the Governor, who had not yet made up Matters with the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> endeavour'd to do it, tho' without acquainting him that he did it, because he
<PB N="178" REF="337"/>
could have no Security from his Rival. The Ge∣nerals of the Army of the Crown, and that of <HI>Li∣thuania,</HI> came likewise to feel the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Pulse, and to try if they could finger his Bills of Exchange. They had hitherto pretended to enter∣tain a Correspondence with the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> upon the magnificent Promises he had made 'em. That Ambassador thought he might promise any thing, so as to secure this Crown, without obser∣ving that he had to do with People as cunning as himself, and even engag'd under-hand to the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> from whom they expected to draw more considerable Sums than from him. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had no mind to bid so high as the Ambassa∣dor, because lying is not the Character of a Prince, as it is of those Ministers, who commonly think the direct contrary of what they speak. Accordingly he reply'd, that he was oblig'd to them for the ten∣der of their Service, but if they pretended to be paid before-hand, he willingly dispens'd with it; that he was ready to bargain with them about what he should give 'em, provided they made his Election good; but if they mean'd only to take his Money, and afterwards to excuse themselves upon the Plea of the impossibility of making good their promises, he would chuse rather to keep his Money, than expose himself to future Repentance for giving it away to no purpose. These Generals, or rather their Deputies, hearing him speak in this fashion, perceiv'd quickly that he was too long-headed for them; and having drop'd all designs of pulling a Feather from him, did under-hand advise the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> to endeavour by all possible means to seize upon his Person. To bring this about, instead of declaring openly for the Duke, they made their Ad∣dress to the Cardinal Primate, as if they had been troubled to quit an Interest that they were joyn'd to by Inclination. The Cardinal suffer'd himself to be amus'd for some time by glittering Hopes, and
<PB N="179" REF="338"/>
even fed the Prince with them. He endeavour'd to persuade him that he would speedily send him an Army capable to reduce the Duke of <HI>Saxony;</HI> which should oblige the Prince to wait the Execution of his Promises, notwithstanding the Inconveniencies he strugled with upon the Sea.</P>
<P>This Affair was so long in dependance, that the Peace after dwindling for some Months, was con∣cluded before it came to be determin'd. The Princes of the Empire were forc'd to submit to the plea∣sure of stronger Powers. The <HI>French</HI> recognis'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as King of <HI>England;</HI> and that Prince coming then to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Plenipotenti∣aries of <HI>France</HI> began to pay him the Honour and Respect that was due to the Dignity they had ac∣knowledg'd to be his. However, it happen'd that Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> being accustom'd to call him by another Name than that of King, us'd his wonted Expression in a Conference where he was present; but being at the same time sensible of his fault, he made the best Reparation he could. Madam <HI>Harlai,</HI> the Chancellor's Daughter, having gone to meet her Husband in <HI>Holland;</HI> and having the Curiosity to see that Prince whom all the <HI>French</HI> have a parti∣cular Esteem for, notwithstanding the harm he has done 'em: This Lady, <HI>I say,</HI> imploy'd some body to desire Audience of him in some place or other. The New King would not give it her at his own Apartments, but sent her word to be at the Princess of <HI>Vaudemont</HI>'s at a certain hour. Madam <HI>Harlai</HI> had all the reason in the World to be satisfied with his Civility and Courtesy. As for Monsieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> he to act the part of a good Courtier, acquainted my Lord <HI>Albemarle,</HI> his <HI>British</HI> Majesty's new Favou∣rite, who began then to have as great an Ascendant in the King's Affection, as ever my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> had: He acquainted him, <HI>I say,</HI> That he desir'd his Master's Picture. My Lord <HI>Albemarle</HI> promis'd to give it him; but withal, intreated him to have pa∣tience
<PB N="180" REF="339"/>
for some time, because his Master was upon his Return to <HI>England,</HI> and he was afraid he could not spare the time to let it be drawn. Whether that Lord forgot his Promise, or whether the King of <HI>Britain</HI> was so taken up with Affairs of Conse∣quence, that my Lord could not have the opportu∣nity of making good his Promise; whatever was in it, four or five Months pass'd, and Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> had resolv'd not to think of it farther, when he re∣ceiv'd Information at <HI>Paris</HI> that my Lord's Trum∣peter staid in his Hall to speak with him. At first he could not conjecture what should bring him so far from home, for he was far from thinking that his Master should have call'd to mind his Request, after letting so much time slip without sending to him. But after all, he found that his Errand was to bring him the Picture. My Lord had caus'd a magnificent Frame to be made for it at <HI>Paris,</HI> be∣cause that sort of Work is better done there than in <HI>England.</HI> The Trumpeter took care to let him know so much, to shew what Pains his Master took to content him. Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> thought this an odd way of conveying a Picture; but Foreigners have their peculiar Customs as we have ours; and so he was e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en oblig'd to take the Complement to∣gether with the Charges. He gave the Trumpeter a handsome Present; and that being all that this Mes∣senger wanted, he return'd forthwith to his own Country.</P>
<P>Of all the King's Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Ryswick,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> as 'tis alledg'd, bore the least Fi∣gure as to Sense, but he bore the greatest on another score, I mean his Quality, and the first places of the Robe, which for a long time have been fill'd by his Ancestors. Upon this account he had had the whole, or at least the greatest part of the Honour of the Treaty, if the People had found any thing in it to their advantage: But 'twas so far from that, that all Persons regreted secretly, and even pub∣lickly
<PB N="181" REF="340"/>
all the Restitutions that the King oblig'd himself to in that Treaty, as much as if they had been to part with their own Estates. It must be own'd that this fancy was in some measure foolish; for, besides that his Majesty knew a great deal bet∣ter than they what was convenient for him, and his Kingdom; according to all the measures of good Sense, they ought to have desir'd nothing more than an end of the War, in order to prevent their being expos'd to the Evils they must of necessity undergo, as long as it should continue. But, as People do not always act conformably to Reason, so they made with Reluctancy the very Fire-works, that they were commanded to make, pursuant to the usual Custom upon all such Occasions. Inso∣much that the Commissaries of the Wards were oblig'd to back their Injunctions with the Penalty of a large Fine; and without that they would never have agreed to it. However, even that did not scare 'em from censuring all that had been conclu∣ded upon. To this purpose they handed about a pretty pleasant Story, which shew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d how little they were satisfied with Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> That Magi∣strate had a Son that was as Foppish as his Father was Grave; for in earnest, the Father resembled the two Courtiers of whom Monsieur <HI>de la Feuillade</HI> said, That when his Majesty had a mind to drink his Liquor cool, his Cup-bearers needed only to cool the Bottles by placing 'em between these two. This Son, <HI>I say,</HI> was so far from resembling his Father, that he had always acted up to the Chara∣cter I here give him. He was at <HI>Ryswick</HI> when the Affairs of that Negotiation were brought to a Con∣clusion; but neither the Solemnity of the place, nor his Father's Character could make him wiser than usually. However, Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> having sent him to the King with the News of the signing of the Treaty, he stay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so long by the way, that the News were known at Court thirty Hours before
<PB N="182" REF="341"/>
his Arrival. This slowness did not become a young Man, especially one of so much Fire, who us'd always to walk like Lightning. Upon which ac∣count the World was amus'd with it, but at last they began to say, That they ought not to think it strange, since for certain the Father was con∣founded with the Son; that it was the Son that had made the Treaty, as appear'd from his Impati∣ence in signing it, notwithstanding the prejudice it did to the King and the State; and that 'twas the Father who brought the News to Court, which was equally manifest from the tediousness he shew'd up∣on the Road, for fear of wounding his Gravity. The principal foundation of this Raillery was, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so mortify'd by the taking of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that they sought for a Peace at any rate; and that whatever Proposal the <HI>French</HI> Plenipoten∣tiaries should have made after an Action of that im∣portance, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have agreed to it, and consented that the King should retain <HI>Luxemburg</HI> as an equivalent for that place, if the Plenipotentia∣ries had been so wise, as to take the advantage of the Consternation they were in.</P>
<P>Though the People by this Conduct seem'd to controul the King's Actions, yet his Majesty was not ill pleas'd to find 'em of that mind. For as it was a Mark of their Folly, so it shew'd their con∣cern for his Majesty's Interest. Whatever was in it, they scarce had the sense to observe that neither Monsieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> nor any of his Collegues, had done any thing without the King's Orders. But we must not pretend that that sort of Cattle are ever govern'd by Reason; Capricio and Humour is the ordinary Standard and Rule of their Thoughts. In effect, those who but two Months before cry'd out for a Peace with all the Passion imaginable, had no sooner got it, but they wish'd the War had con∣tinued. Their Reason was this: Instead of lessening the Prices of things which had been very dear for
<PB N="183" REF="342"/>
some time, by reason of the preceeding bad Sea∣sons, they saw the Markets still rising; besides, that the Wrath of God was seen in the Barrenness of the Earth, we may attribute this Affliction to another Cause, occasion'd by the War. The King had been oblig'd to Re-coin the Money twice, that it might serve instead of an Edict. Indeed he had got con∣siderably by this Project, for he rais'd the <HI>Louis-d'ors</HI> to 14 <HI>Livres,</HI> and the <HI>Silver Crowns</HI> to 3 <HI>Livres</HI> 12 <HI>Sous,</HI> though the one was not commonly worth above 11 <HI>Livres,</HI> and the other three▪ Now the King for some Politick Considerations keeping up the Denomination of the Money, it came to pass, that what they us'd to have at easy Rates from Fo∣reign Countries prov'd very dear, by reason of the loss of the Exchange, which was a full sixth part.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not trouble his Head with these matters. He thought upon nothing, but either seeing the effect of the Cardinal Primate's Promises, or returning to see his Mistress. His Eminence had retir'd to the Castle of <HI>Cowits,</HI> where his Partisans assembled several times to no purpose. Many of 'em complained that Abbot <HI>Polignac</HI> had fed 'em with the hopes of things that were not like to be put in Execution. He had gone so far, as to pro∣mise that they should not want either the Money, or the Troops of <HI>France;</HI> for that being the only Affair that he minded, he wish'd that the King, in like manner, might have nothing else to mind. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> finding that they began to complain of that Minister, caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a Body of <HI>German</HI> Troops to enter the Country. This put those, who were most expos'd, into a Consternation; and some of 'em making some advances towards the making of their Peace with the Duke, the Prince no sooner receiv'd the News, but he resolv'd to return to <HI>France;</HI> but at the same time, to make the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> repent of their giving his Rival the Prefe∣rence,
<PB N="184" REF="343"/>
he order'd <HI>Bart</HI> to seize some of their Ships that lay just by him. They had anchor'd in the Road, with a design to sail up to the Port with their Car∣goes; but <HI>Bart</HI> obliging them to follow him, car∣ry'd 'em to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> where the Prince was forc'd to put in by stress of Weather. At the same time, the King stopp'd all the <HI>Dantzick</HI> Ships in his Har∣bors, which makes it probable, that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Orders to <HI>Bart,</HI> did not come so much from himself as from the King. The Prince who had been very uneasy in his Voyage, was more so when he came to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> notwithstanding that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> shew'd a particular Esteem for his Person. He set a part a great num∣ber of Houses for the Prince and his Retinue, and the Wind continuing contrary for some Days, that little time seem'd so long to that Prince, that I doubt if the six Years, that according to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Historians, one of their Kings spent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before he could find a favourable minute to return to <HI>London:</HI> I doubt, <HI>I say,</HI> Whether these six Years were longer to that King, than those few Days were to the Prince? The occasion of his uneasi∣ness was, that he was still in Love, and that all the Comfort he had, was to wait for the Post∣days, that he might hear from the Party he lov'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dantzickers</HI> made what Reprisals they could; they arrested the <HI>French</HI> Merchants at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and seiz'd their Effects. But after all, they knew very well that 'twas not proper for them to Quarrel with a King, that the greatest part of the Forces of <HI>Europe</HI> had in vain attempted to bring down; and upon that view they had recourse to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Mediation to procure the releasing of their Ships. The King made 'em stay some time before he grant∣ed their Request; but at last, believing that the Mortification he had given 'em, was sufficient to make 'em remember it, he accommodated the mat∣ter
<PB N="185" REF="344"/>
to their Satisfaction. Abbot <HI>Polignac</HI> was asto∣nish'd at the Prince's Return, and the Conduct of a great many, who after siding with his Party, be∣gan to Desert him. At the same time notice was given to him from the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> that he ought to retire with Expedition out of the Country, or if he did not, that he could not answer for the Security of his Person. The Abbot did not think it his Duty to wait for a second Message, but set out <HI>incognito</HI> without any Retinue, and order'd his Equipage to make towards the Sea, in order to Im∣barque there as well as himself; but they were robb'd before they could reach the Ships that stay'd for 'em. The Abbot did not know, whether the Court which had given him no Orders for his Re∣treat, would be pleas'd with it; and therefore he stay'd some time at <HI>Hamburg</HI> to know the Orders of the Court. He wrote to the Marquiss of <HI>Torcy,</HI> Se∣cretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but receiv'd no Answer; and having complain'd of this to his Friends in that Country, their Answer was not ve∣ry satisfactory. They told him, That the Court was very Angry with him, and that the Cardinal Prima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did not cease to do him disservices. In earnest, his Eminence wrote a great many things to <HI>France</HI> to his prejudice; he even insinuated that he had applied to his own use part of the Money sent him on the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s behalf. 'Tis believ'd that this Accusation was false, and that 'twas only the Cardinal's chagrin upon seeing himself aban∣don'd that made him speak in that fashion. 'Tis true, the Abbot was Poor, and that some time before he was reduc'd to such Straits that his Family would have wanted the Necessaries of Life, if he had not found Friends to assist him. The Cardinal who knew his Straits, and likewise knew that some time after he had paid his Debts', probably grounded his Charge upon that Circumstance. But let it be as it will; though a Man be never so Innocent; 'tis a
<PB N="186" REF="345"/>
great Misfortune to lie under an Accusation. The Court sent him Orders to retire to an Abby he had in <HI>Normandy;</HI> whether it was that they credited the Accusation, or, which is more likely, that they mean'd to make him answerable for the event.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> having thus unhing'd his Competitor, thought he wanted nothing to com∣pleat his good Fortune, but the Pope's Favour. As soon as he was proclaim'd King, he had sent an Envoy to sollicite his Holiness to favour his Interest. But as that Court moves but slowly, espe∣cially when there's any thing of Religion in the case; so his Holiness would not grant Audience to the Envoy, till he was fully assur'd that that Duke had abjur'd <HI>Lutheranism.</HI> A Certificate of the Abjuration was brought to him, but he suspected it mightily. It came only from the Hands of a Bishop of his Family, who might be suspected to be gain'd by that Prince, because their common Grandeur was concern'd upon that occasion. The Duke having never entertain'd any Correspondence with that Court, was not throughly vers'd in their Politicks, and was so far from seeing through the true Spring of his Holiness's Motions, that he ima∣gin'd the Pope to be in the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Inte∣rest. Accordingly, as soon as the Prince return'd to <HI>France,</HI> he sent a second Envoy to the Pope to re∣present to his Holiness, that he needed not to con∣tinue any longer in the Interest of a Prince, who by his Retreat had given sufficient evidence, that he had drop'd his Pretensions to the Crown. In the mean time, the Pope was far from being biass'd that way. Had he been oblig'd to side with one or t'other; he had not scrupl'd to fall in with the Duke. He was an <HI>Italian, i. e.</HI> no great Friend to <HI>French-men;</HI> besides, he was by Birth, a Subject of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which Quality did not allow him to depart from the Sentiments of the House of
<PB N="187" REF="346"/>
<HI>Austria.</HI> However, being Head of the Catholick Church, and upon that score oblig'd to observe Measures on all hands, he sent Orders to his Nuncio at <HI>Cologn</HI> to go for that Country. He or∣der'd him, under the pretence of promoting the Interest of Religion, to reconcile the Cardinal Pri∣mate and the Duke. The Cardinal shew'd all along a violent Resolution to raise a Civil War, rather than be without Satisfaction for the Affront offer'd him by the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> by Crowning the Duke. He alledg'd, and justly indeed, That the right of Coronation was lodg'd in the Church of <HI>Gnesne,</HI> of which he was Archbishop. The Pope had another Nuncio already upon the spot, who of his own head did not fail to anticipate the Orders given to this. For he knew very well that whatever he did for the Interest of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> would be approv'd by his Holiness; and accordingly had privately embarqu'd in the Duke's Party.</P>
<P>Some time being spent in all these Transactions, the Year came to an end, which was the time al∣loted by his Majesty for the Conclusion of the Mar∣riage of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> to the Princess of <HI>Savoy.</HI> Every day he lik'd the Proposal better and better; and the young Princess had such a winning way, that he lov'd her as tenderly, as if she had been his own Daughter. The Duke was but weak for one of his Age, insomuch, that though the Ce∣remony was to be perform'd out of hand, yet he was not to enjoy her till he pass'd 18 Years, and she 14. In former times, when the Marquiss of <HI>Louvois</HI> marry'd his eldest Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Rocheguyon,</HI> the Son of the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> the Consummation of the Marriage was not put so long off; but the Relations on both sides made a mutual Compact, that the new-married Couple should not see one another but once a Week, namely on <HI>Thursdays,</HI> and that they should live in Celibacy
<PB N="188" REF="347"/>
without any mutual Commerce for the rest of the Week. This made 'em always long for the arrival of the appointed Day of meeting, and inspir'd 'em with a mutual Eagerness: And if all marry'd Per∣sons were confin'd to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me measures, perhaps they would not be so soon weary of one another, as we commonly find 'em. However, the King having regulated the matter as above, Preparations were made for celebrating the Marriage, which were expensive to an unparallel'd degree. Nay, his Majesty intimated that he would take it well if every body would act up to his Abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity in honour∣ing the Festival. 'Twas not the literal performance of this desire, that would have satisfied his Majesty; if that had only been requir'd, the Nuptial Cere∣monies would have been a very mean thing, for the charge of the War, and of the Taxes, that still continued during its whole course, had so impove∣rish'd the Subjects, that they could scarce be poorer than they were. So that all the Courtiers, and even the Military Officers that happen'd to be then at Court, put another Construction upon the matter. They knew where the Kings meaning lay; and all of 'em being ready to do any thing to please his Majesty, straiten'd themselves to obtain that end. The charge they were at was altogether extraordi∣nary; nay, some of 'em bought Cloaths that were worth more Money than the intrinsick Value of their Estates. I do not speak by way of Amplifica∣cation, but deliver a naked Truth; witness a great many Land and Sea-Officers, who laid out 5 or 600 Crowns for one Suit of Cloaths, though at the same time a great part of 'em were not worth 10 Crowrs a Year of Patrimonial Estate. Herein lies the Folly of the <HI>French;</HI> and though I am a <HI>French∣man</HI> my self, and perhaps as great a Fool as others, yet I cannot abstain from censuring our common Folly.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="348"/>
After the Conclusion of the Peace, there was so great a Confluence of Foreigners at <HI>Paris,</HI> that in the <HI>Suburbs</HI> of S <HI>Germains</HI> only, there was about 15 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6000. This Multitude made the Lodgings so excessive dear in that place, that the Houses which were lett at 1200 <HI>Livres</HI> during the War, were rais'd now to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 Crowns. In a short time, the numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of these Foreigners increas'd to above one half; insomuch, that in a little time after, or about the beginning of the succeeding Year, they were computed to 36000 in that very <HI>Suburbs.</HI> And as they had been inform'd, that, during the War, <HI>France</HI> had not only been exhausted of Men, but also of Treasure, this being a Report spread abroad on purpose to amuse them, and make them believe that <HI>France</HI> would be very glad to Truckle to the Will of her Enemies; they were extreamly surpris'd to find (at their Arrival) every thing in a different Dispo∣sition to what they were made believe, while at home. They saw that great Town did not only abound in People, as much as ever, but that Luxury and Pleasu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were arriv'd to such a degree in it, that the meanest Citizen was more splendid than the Per∣sons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Quality in their Country. In effect, the grea∣ter the Mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies were in private Families, the more they endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to blind the World with sumptuous Appearances. However, these Measures serv'd on∣ly to augment 'em: besides, it must be own'd, that the most part of the Women us'd this Luxury at the expence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Honour. Few or none of them but had her Gallant; and none of these Gallants was esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, but in proportion to what he lavish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess. As the War had rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a vast number of People, who apply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves to business, by which they gam'd a great deal of Money; so ha∣ving c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me very easily by it, they as freely lavish'd it. A great many, who had formerly been glad to have got Shoes to their bare Feet, did now bestow Coaches on their Misses. Insomuch, that in 7 or 8
<PB N="190" REF="349"/>
Years time, the number of Coaches was increas'd to above 2000. Gold and Azure were to be seen in every Family, which extreamly surpris'd these Strangers, who, before their Arrival, had heard that all <HI>Paris</HI> could not afford either Silver-Spoon or Fork, and that the King had pillag'd them of all, to support the Expences of the War. It's cer∣tain, that the War had impoverish'd a great many, but such were to be seen rather in the Country, than in <HI>Paris.</HI> On the contrary, <HI>Paris</HI> had never been either so Rich, or so Magnificent, there being 160000000 Millions expended in it, only by the Par∣ties that were form'd there since the War, without rec∣koning what others might have gain'd by a thousand different ways. For while some got infinitely by the Partisans, in lending them Money upon extrava∣gant Interest; others applied themselves to the way of Victualling, or to some other thing, so that it might be justly alledg'd, as War had ruin'd some, it had rais'd others so prodigiously, that they were no more to be known for the same Persons: So different were they now, from what they had been formerly. There was such an infinite number of Sharpers, and such like Scoundrels, who had rais'd themselves from the very <HI>Scum</HI> of the People, to vast Riches, by sucking the Blood of the poor People. This was reckon'd so good a Trade, that even some Marquisses apply'd themselves to it. Thus you might have seen one embrace this Trade, without regarding what was said, either of his own Relations, or his Wifes, who was either Grand-daughter, or Sister, to a <HI>High President.</HI> As for himself, there was one of his Name, a <HI>Lieutenant General</HI> in the King's Army; but as there is a difference betwixt Relations, the <HI>Lieutenant General</HI> behav'd like a Man of Quality and Merit, while he acted like a wretched Miscre∣ant, or at least like one, who thought it no Crime to dishonour his <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI> If the Strangers abovemention'd were amaz'd to find every thing at
<PB N="191" REF="350"/>
<HI>Paris</HI> so different from the Relation they had of 'em at home, they were much more astonish'd to see the Solemnity of the Marriage of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and the Princess at <HI>Versailles.</HI> The Cere∣mony was perform'd with all the Splendor imagin∣able; they gave a great many <HI>Balls,</HI> where all the Persons of Quality, retaining to the Court, of both Sexes, were present. All the Ladies were cloath'd in Black Velvet, set out with precious Stones, that cast the brightest Lustre imaginable: The Men were also adorn'd with Diamonds. As on such Occasions the Pick-pockets of <HI>Paris</HI> are very intentive upon their Business; so they came in whole Swarms to keep Holy-day at <HI>Versailles,</HI> adorn'd as others were, and, abating for their Countenances, that are hardly well known in that place, one would have thought they were all Persons of the first Rank. The extraordi∣nary Crowd, as one may easily imagine, afforded them sufficient opportunity to make up, with consi∣derable advantage, the Expence of their Ornaments. A great many, after their return home, found at their leasure that the Diamonds they had carried to the Solemnity were gone. The Rogues had ta∣ken from some <HI>one,</HI> from others <HI>two,</HI> and so more or less; and they might repute themselves happy, who came off free. Even the Duchess of <HI>Burgundy</HI> did not escape the common Fate of those, who had suffer'd by these Pick-pockets. They ventur'd to cut away a part of her Gown, where she had a large Buckle of Diamonds. But, what is surprizing, the <HI>Chevalier</HI> of <HI>Sully</HI> had the same fate, and what he lost, was by the hand of a Person of the first Quality: He catch'd him in the fact, and took the liberty to tell it to one of his Friends. His <HI>Majesty</HI> over-heard it, and desir'd to be further inform'd of the matter, but was extreamly astonish'd, when they whisper'd to him the Name of this young Pick-pocket; he forbid to Challenge him upon it, being willing to save his Honour, for the Respect
<PB N="192" REF="351"/>
he had for his Relations; however his Charity serv'd to no purpose, for not only all the Court knew the Secret, but also all <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Marriage-day, the new married Couple were put to Bed; but the Curtains being undrawn, there were a great many Witnesses of their Actions, only in order to see if they lay close to one another. The King, to give them a sufficient opportunity, caus'd draw the Curtains, while the Duke of <HI>Beauvil∣liers,</HI> and the other Officers of the young Prince, stood just by to over-hear what might pass; but no∣thing having pass'd, they soon undrew the Curtains. That young Princess kept Assemblies the same day, and the following days. Her Court was very throng, and the Ladies strove who should shew her most Respect. There happen'd a difference betwixt the Princess of <HI>Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourt,</HI> and the young Duchess of <HI>Sully,</HI> Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Coaislin:</HI> She was Niece to the Duchess's <HI>Lude,</HI> Lady of Honour to the Princess. This Relation came by her Husband, who was the Duchess, or Brother's Son; she want∣ed her Assistance in regard of her Youth, not being in Condition to enter the Lists with a Princess, whose only business had been (since she was in the World) to ingratiate her self with all in Power, from the highest to the lowest Minister. But in∣stead of the Assistance she expected from her, the Aunt advis'd her to yield to her Adversary. All the Duchesses were highly incensed against the Duchess of <HI>Lude;</HI> finding she had tarnish'd their Honour by so scandalous an Advice. In effect, though such sort of Disputes had often fallen out, not only betwixt the Princesses and the Duchesses, but even betwixt their Husbands; yet, perhaps such another as this had never fallen out before. The Dukes and Duchesses had always maintain'd their Rank, as if St. <HI>Louis</HI> had begot them. The late Duke of <HI>Mon∣tauzier,</HI> and the late Duchess of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lles,</HI> stretch'd the Affair yet further; the one against Monsieur <HI>Le</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="352"/>
<HI>Grand,</HI> a Prince of the House of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the other against the Duchess of <HI>Bouillon.</HI> Though the Duchess of <HI>Noailles,</HI> was only the Daughter of a <HI>Farmer</HI> of the Revenues; yet she was sensible that in <HI>France, Nobility</HI> came not by the <HI>Wives,</HI> but by the <HI>Husbands;</HI> she shelter'd her self from any Indig∣nity by the Character of her Husband, whom she took to be beyond Reproach. However it ordina∣rily falls out in a Difference betwixt two Parties, that they upbraid one another, even to the five hundreth Generation. The Duchess of <HI>Bouillon</HI> produc'd Re∣cords, by which she made it appear, that <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Noailles</HI> had been formerly Master of the Houshold to one of her Husband's Ancestors. In fine, this Affair enrag'd the Parties to that degree, that they call'd one another all the <HI>Ill Names</HI> they could think on. His <HI>Majesty</HI> was at last oblig'd to impose Si∣lence by his Authority; he forbad them expresly to proceed farther, without deciding any thing in the matter, that caus'd their heats. I do not know, if the Duchess of <HI>Lude</HI> was afraid of these <HI>Ill Names</HI> in doing what she had done, or if she thought, be∣cause the King had given the Preference to the Dukes before the Princes of the House of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the last time he made a Promotion of Knights of the Order, that therefore it ought to be the same in re∣gard of the Women, but it pass'd after the manner I have told you.</P>
<P>Though the Peace had been made a pretty while, yet none hitherto reap'd the Fruits of it. The Commerce was as dead as in the time of War; whether it was attributed to the high value of the <HI>French</HI> Coin, that continued still at the same Rate, or that the King believ'd he could subsist without other Nations, while others must have recourse to him, there was yet no advance made to make it flourish. In the mean time, there came some Ships from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to take in Wine and Pa∣per at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> and <HI>Rouen.</HI> They bought along
<PB N="194" REF="353"/>
other Merchandize to be sold there. But the <HI>Tariff</HI> not being yet regulated between all the Parties, and the Treaty of <HI>Ryswick</HI> having only mention'd, that it should be put upon the same foot as it was in the Years 1665 and 1666, which was not yet done; this together with the loss of twenty in the hundred by the Money, oblig'd these Ships to return with∣out either selling or buying any thing in these Ports. About the same time, the <HI>States-General</HI> sent <HI>Deputies</HI> to the King, to demand the Execution of that Article. They apply'd themselves to the Mar∣quiss of <HI>Torcy,</HI> Secretary for Foreign Affairs, but Monsieur <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> having the Charge of that Commerce, they were remitted to him for the Ex∣ecution of their Demands. These <HI>Deputies</HI> were ex∣ceedingly well vers'd in Affairs of that nature, and the States having an intire Confidence in them, had given them a <HI>Full Power</HI> to Act as Commissaries in the Regulation of the <HI>Tariff.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Pontchar∣train</HI> heard them upon the Matter, but being Judi∣cious and Politick, he put them off with fair Words, until he had acquainted the King with the Affair. The Commerce of <HI>Holland</HI> was of far less advantage to <HI>France,</HI> than <HI>that</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> because they draw a great deal more Money from the one than from the other. In effect, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Import more Merchandize into <HI>France</HI> than they Export; whereas <HI>England</HI> on the contrary Exports more than they Import. So that the first carries out the Coin, and the other brings it <HI>in.</HI> This made them resolve to keep up the <HI>Tariff</HI> as high as possi∣ble, in regard of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Trade, its Imposts or Customs, while they design'd to lower it in re∣gard of the <HI>English;</HI> while they expected the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> should come to <HI>Paris</HI> to terminate that Affair, they resolv'd to send to <HI>London</HI> to regulate what re∣garded that Nation. <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> pitch'd upon Mon∣sieur <HI>Phelipe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux D'Herbeaut,</HI> his Relation, for that purpose; he was first Commissary of the Marine,
<PB N="195" REF="354"/>
under Monsieur <HI>de Maurepas,</HI> who had left him the whole Managment of it. He had the Character of <HI>Commissary-General</HI> for regulating the Commerce betwixt the two Nations; but though his Commis∣sion was presently dispatch'd, yet he stay'd a long time after. In the mean time, the Court nam'd other Commissaries to treat with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but as they had no design to terminate the Affair to their Satisfaction, so it continues to this day at the same pass.</P>
<P>While these matters were a transacting, the King nam'd <HI>Ambassadors</HI> to go to all the <HI>Foreign Courts;</HI> and instead of sending Gentlemen of the <HI>Law,</HI> as had been always practic'd in <HI>France,</HI> he employ'd Persons of Quality, or Officers of the Army. He thought, if they could joyn the Knowledge of the Cabinet to the Experience they had acquir'd in war∣like Affairs, they would be more accomplish'd for his Service upon all occasions. He chose the Mar∣quiss of <HI>Villars,</HI> Lieutenant-General of the Army, for the Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> and the Marquiss of <HI>Har∣court,</HI> also a Lieutenant-General, for his <HI>Ambassador</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> who during the War, had acquir'd a Repu∣tation equal to any; and could he perform the same thing in his Embassy, which he had done at the Head of a Flying Army, no more could be expect∣ed of him; but that being a hard Task, his Friends could hardly hope for it. He was going to a Court, where the very name of <HI>French</HI> is suspected, much more at a time, when he seem'd very earnest to create all the Obstacles imaginable to the Emperor's Designs of bringing the Succession of his Catholick Majesty to fall upon the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> his eldest Son, or that failing, upon the <HI>Arch-Duke,</HI> his second Son. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. his present Majesty's Father, had left it by <HI>Testament,</HI> to the last, tho' he was not Born at that time; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> shew∣ing no Inclination to execute it, his <HI>Imperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Majesty</HI> labour'd to engage them to favour the King of the
<PB N="196" REF="355"/>
<HI>Romans.</HI> He thought, that being his eldest Son, he not only deserv'd better that Dignity, which was much more solid than that of Emperor, though not altogether so splendid; but he expected also to secure the Fortune of his Son the better, if he could unite these two Qualities in one Person. The Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being his Sister-in-law, he did not doubt of her favouring his Design; and the Count of <HI>Harrach,</HI> his <HI>Ambassador</HI> at that Court, had a Commission to propose it to her. The <HI>Queen</HI> join'd Issue with the Ambassador in all his Sentiments; and his Imperial Majesty being hitherto so prosperous in his Designs, as to get the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Creatures into his Catholick <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Council, and she being very industrious to gain the other Members, they met often to consi∣der how to behave in the Scene they were to Act. The Count of <HI>Harrach</HI> insinuated to the Queen and them, that the best Method they could fall upon in this Juncture, was, to put the Government of the Frontiers into <HI>German-</HI>hands, or into the Hands of Persons well-affected to the Emperor. The Prince of <HI>Darmstadt,</HI> who signaliz'd himself in the Defence of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> was propos'd to be Vice-Roy of <HI>Cata∣lonia; Don Francisco de Velasco,</HI> having rendred himself unworthy of that Command, by suffering himself to be surpriz'd in his Camp. The Government of <HI>Milan</HI> seem'd too good to escape one of his <HI>Imperial Majesty</HI>'s Creatures, as did also the Vice-Royalty of <HI>Navarre;</HI> for the Count of <HI>Harrach</HI> suppos'd very reasonably that it was by attacking of one of these three places, if not all the three at once, that the King of <HI>France</HI> meant to make good his Preten∣sions to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Succession, immediately after the Death of that Monarch. The <HI>Queen,</HI> and those of the King's Council, who were in her Interest, found it difficult to manage that point; for though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were too wise to own their Sentiments openly, yet they had not the least Inclination to own either the Emperor's eldest or youngest Son,
<PB N="197" REF="356"/>
for their Soveraign. They were also of the same Opinion in regard of the <HI>Dauphin</HI> and his Sons; though some of the <HI>French</HI> Emissaries endeavour'd to insinuate to them secretly, that if they would chuse either the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> or the Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> they could form their tender Years according to their own Model, insomuch that it would be impossible for them to perceive they had ever been born <HI>French-men.</HI> And by these means they labour'd to extirpate the Antipathy, that was natural to the two Nations; but that being a hard Point to ma∣nage, they always rejected it with scorn. They could never conceive why they would deprive the Prince of <HI>Bavaria</HI> of that Succession, for it was naturally his <HI>Right,</HI> after the Renunciation his Most Christian <HI>Majesty</HI> had made of it, when he married the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> Others wish'd, since the King had no Heirs begot of his own Body, the Crown might fall to some <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> They be∣liev'd they should be more happy under such a Person, than under any <HI>Foreign Prince.</HI> For such a one being train'd up from his Cradle in their <HI>Cu∣stoms</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> they could bear more easily with him than with any other. For, generally, all Men inherit the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Country, where they are Born, and it is hard for them ever to change their natural Inclination.</P>
<P>Such was the Disposition of the Affairs of that Nation, when the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> made use of all her Interest to have the Prince of <HI>Darmstadt</HI> made Vice-Roy of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> Governor of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Navarre.</HI> For she not only look'd upon them as well-affected to the Emperor, but also very capable to defend against the <HI>French,</HI> the Places committed to their care. They had distinguish'd themselves upon a thousand occasions; and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was actually employ'd against the <HI>Turks,</HI> with whom the Emperor was in continual War. That Barba∣rous
<PB N="198" REF="357"/>
Nation ow'd its Preservation only to the Di∣version, was made upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> when his <HI>Impe∣rial Majesty</HI> was engag'd against <HI>France.</HI> But now the Peace being concluded betwixt these two Po∣tentates, the Emperor thought of no less than swal∣lowing up the <HI>Turks</HI> in a Campaign or two at most, and dislodging 'em of all their Possessions in <HI>Europe.</HI> But whether that Prince meant to take his ease after so tedious a War, or, what is more likely, that true Policy oblig'd him to desire a Peace, there were already some Proposals made, that had a favourable hearing from both Parties, and per∣haps without that Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> who about this time saw himself at the Head of the Emperor's Army, would hardly accept of the <HI>Office</HI> of Vice-Roy of <HI>Navarre.</HI> But now finding himself oblig'd to put up the Sword, he was glad, that by the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Influence, the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> had that <HI>Deference</HI> for him. However, her success in that was not so fa∣vourable as it was on the behalf of the Princes of <HI>Darmstadt</HI> and <HI>Vaud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mont.</HI> For the Services of the first at <HI>Barcelona</HI> pleading highly in his Favour, she carried it for him without any Opposition; but she met with more difficulty in regard of the Go∣vernment of <HI>Milan.</HI> Some would have it continued to the Marquiss of <HI>Leganez,</HI> who was there alrea∣dy, or conferr'd upon some <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> but that was far from the <HI>Queen</HI>'s mind; she meant rather to strip them of what they possess'd than provide them with new Governments. The Duke of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> one of the most considerable Gran∣dees of <HI>Spain,</HI> and most belov'd of the People, was Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples.</HI> He had pass'd some years in that Employ, and places of that nature are usually triennial in <HI>Spain;</HI> yet she would gladly have it conferr'd upon one of her Creatures, but her Friends thought it not convenient, and rather ad∣vis'd her to the contrary to continue it to him; and gave for their reason, that she ought to be very
<PB N="199" REF="358"/>
cautious in bringing him to <HI>Spain</HI> in the present Po∣sture of Affairs; which would not fail to awake the People's Affection for him, and consequent∣ly to make some Obstacles to the Emperor's De∣signs.</P>
<P>The Reasons which oblig'd the <HI>Emperor</HI> to strike up a Peace with the <HI>Port,</HI> were these. His Power became formidable, not only to the Princes of the Empire, but even to his other Allies. Besides, knowing his Pretensions to the Succession of <HI>Spain,</HI> they not only oppos'd it privately, but even avow∣edly. The Princes who granted him Succors against the <HI>Turks,</HI> spoke of withdrawing them. The New King of <HI>England,</HI> before he was own'd by <HI>France,</HI> offer'd his Mediation for agreeing the Parties. He had sent two <HI>Ambassadors</HI> to the <HI>Port</HI> on purpose, to propose it to the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> but they both died upon their way thither. This appearing very extraordinary, because the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Interest seem'd altogether opposite to his Conduct; and, besides the Death of these two Persons affording matter of Speculation upon a great many things, some be∣liev'd assuredly they had been poyson'd. This might have discourag'd his <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI> from sending any more Ambassadors into that Country; but considering that the <HI>Turks</HI> their rejecting of the Peace, was only grounded upon the Diversion was made in their favour, and that possibly they would lay aside their Obstinacy, when convinc'd of their Error, he assum'd his first Resolution, nor was he in the least deceiv'd; for the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> accepted of his offer now with as much warmth, as he had rejected it before with indifference. He accepted of <HI>his Mediation,</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI>'s, which was offer'd to him at the same time. And being satis∣fied that in the Peace they had made with <HI>France,</HI> they had easily surmounted all the Difficulties that commonly attend the Preliminaries of <HI>Treaties,</HI> they mean'd to follow the same Method in <HI>this.</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="359"/>
The Emperor understanding, that the <HI>Turks</HI> had accepted of the Mediation that was offer'd 'em, gave notice of it to the <HI>Potentates,</HI> who were in∣terested with him in the War; namely, the <HI>Repub∣licks</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> They were mutually ingag'd in an <HI>Offen∣sive</HI> and <HI>Defensive</HI> League; so he being resolv'd to do nothing without their Consent, desir'd them to give in their Pretensions in <HI>Writing,</HI> while the Parties should have condescended upon the place of assembling. For his own part, he put in his, which he did not expect would be granted, because the Jealousy the <HI>Mediators,</HI> as well as other Princes had of his Power, oblig'd him to make an end of these Dif∣ferences. He pretended that the <HI>Turks,</HI> by the <HI>Teeaty</HI> that was on foot, ought to be oblig'd to give him up <HI>Belgrade</HI> and <HI>Temeswaer,</HI> with all the <HI>Right</HI> of Soveraignty, that he possess'd in <HI>Transilvania.</HI> At the bottom, these People thought themselves very happy, that the Emperor would consent to a Peace upon so reasonable Terms; but how∣ever Barbarous they are, they are truly Politick, and no sooner perceiv'd that the Mediators, as well as they, were glad to oblige him to lay down his Arms, but they refus'd to consent to these Terms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Republicks</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Great Duke of <HI>Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vy,</HI> fearing that Prince would have made the Peace without them, sent Ministers to <HI>Vienna</HI> to pry into the Affairs there. The <HI>Czar</HI> sent thither his own <HI>General,</HI> while himself resolv'd to pass into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> to establish a more solid Commerce in these Countries than had hi∣therto been done. He look'd upon himself as one of the most powerful Princes of <HI>Christendom,</HI> in re∣gard of the vast extent of his Dominions; but being ignorant how to improve so great a <HI>Power</HI> to the best advantage, he was little more esteem'd than the Prince of <HI>Courland.</HI> He no sooner thought of
<PB N="201" REF="360"/>
his Resolution, then he put it in Execution. He took his Road through the Marquiss of <HI>Brandenburg</HI>'s Dominions, who receiv'd him with all the Respect due to his Person; from thence having pass'd into <HI>Holland,</HI> he continued there some time, applying himself diligently to the knowledge of their Com∣merce and Policy. In effect, seeing their <HI>State</HI> much more flourishing than could have been thought, in proportion to their Extent, he easily conceiv'd it was only owing to their Prudence and Conduct; and being thereby the more induc'd to imitate them, he entred into a new <HI>Treaty</HI> of Commerce with them, and bought some Ships of them. After∣wards he pass'd into <HI>England,</HI> and having acquain∣ted the King that he had Affairs to propose to him, his <HI>Majesty</HI> appointed Commissioners to hear them.</P>
<P>While the New King triumph'd after this manner, either upon the account of the advantageous Peace he gave to <HI>Europe,</HI> or the great Confidence his Al∣lies had in him, or the Consideration they had for him, insomuch that nothing could be enterpriz'd without his Approbation; the Pope's Nuncio, whom he had sent into <HI>Poland,</HI> after he had conferr'd with the <HI>Ordinary Nuncio</HI> at that Court, and been in∣form'd by him of the State of Affairs in that Coun∣try, signify'd to his <HI>Polish Majesty,</HI> that his <HI>Holi∣ness</HI> was not so averse to his Election, as he sup∣posed; that the main thing in question was, whether his Conversion had been sincere; and provided that Point was clear'd, the <HI>Holy Father</HI> would be fully satisfied. God alone was capable to know it: there being none besides, who can search hearts: However, in all outward appearance, this Prince would have the World convinc'd, he was a good Catholick. At least he perform'd all the Duties of a true Catholick, and omitted nothing to confirm the People in the belief of his Sincerity. The <HI>Nuncio</HI> being sensible of what considerable Advantage the
<PB N="202" REF="361"/>
<HI>Pope</HI>'s Consent would be to him, for gaining to him these Persons that continued still in his Enemy's Party, upon a suspicion that his Conversion was only feigned, and being apprehensive that as soon as he were peaceably establish'd on his Throne, he would return to his Vomit: <HI>I say,</HI> The <HI>Nuncio,</HI> who understood how necessary his <HI>Holiness</HI> was to him, like a cunning Politician, mean'd to make the best use of this opportunity; and therefore, before he would assure him altogether of the Apostolick Fa∣vour, he represented to him, that it was impossible for him to perswade all <HI>Europe</HI> of the Sincerity of his Conversion any other way, than by testifying, as a new Convert, the profound Respect he had for his <HI>Holiness;</HI> that since all who profess'd that Re∣ligion owed an intire Obedience in Holy Matters to the Apostolick See, he wish'd his Majesty would not only renounce certain Privileges that the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> pretended to as their Right, but also dismiss all the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Ministers that fol∣lowed him; without using that pretext for retain∣ing them, that he had a great many of that Reli∣gion along with him. He also proposed many other things of the like nature; a plain evidence, that the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> never neglects any Ad∣vantage they can catch. Upon these Conditions he offer'd to imploy all his Interest with the Car∣dinal Regent, to pacify the Commotions of the Kingdom, putting him in hopes that the Respect he had for the Person who sent him, would oblige the Cardinal to accept of the Terms he design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to pro∣pose to him.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> being sensible, how capable the Cardinal's Party was to annoy him; besides, that new Commotions were arising in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> which was all up in Arms to support two Parties that made War against one another, to wit, Prince <HI>Sapieha,</HI> General of the Troops of that Duchy, and the Sieur <HI>Oginski,</HI> Great Ensign of it, a Dignity
<PB N="203" REF="362"/>
of a distinguishing Importance in that Country; <HI>I say,</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> being afraid that this Quar∣rel, which seem'd to proceed from Jealousy, was only a pretence to reverse his Election, promis'd to the <HI>Nuncio</HI> all he desir'd. However, he desir'd to be excus'd from signing any thing touching the Pri∣vileges he would have him to renounce, until he were better inform'd in what they consisted, and had the Advice of the Republick, without whose Approbation he could not handsomely conclude any matter of that importance. The <HI>Nuncio</HI> could not well disapprove of this Objection that appear'd so reasonable. He went to <HI>Lowits</HI> to confer with the Cardinal Primate, whom he found so enrag'd against his <HI>Polish Majesty,</HI> for protecting so avowed∣ly the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> his mortal Enemy, that he almost despair'd of ever succeeding in an Affair he had promis'd so confidently to bring about. But as the <HI>Italians</HI> are cunning Politicians, qualify'd with a deal of Patience, he gain'd by degrees upon his Eminence's Passion. He gave him to know, that the Prince could not have acted other ways than he had done hitherto; for as much as that Bishop had been all along the Soul of his Par∣ty; that he agreed with him, in thinking, that he had reason to resent the Actions of that Prelate, who had incroach'd upon his Privileges; that after all, he ought to consider, that it was not in his Power to hinder what was done, nor so much as revenge it by force; that his Party, who fell off daily, was in no Capacity to enterprize any thing against his Enemy, who was supported by his <HI>Polish Majesty</HI> and his Troops; that <HI>France,</HI> by whose means he had hoped to triumph over him, never pretended to concern themselves any further in the Quarrel, having formerly declared so much to his <HI>Holiness</HI> by their <HI>Ambassador;</HI> so he would find him∣self certainly mistaken if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid any <HI>stress</HI> upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="363"/>
The <HI>Cardinal Primate</HI> was much surpriz'd to hear the Nuncio speak after that manner; not questioning, in the least, the truth of this Declaration, he sent immediately one of his Creatures to his <HI>Most Christian Majesty,</HI> to assure him that his Party was not yet re∣duc'd so very low, but they were in a condition to foil their Enemies, if his <HI>Majesty</HI> would give them a very small Assistance. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> who was no more in the humour to return to that Coun∣try, and indeed never was, when left to his choice, gave his <HI>Majesty</HI> so very bad an Impression of the sordid Avarice of the <HI>Poles,</HI> that he was little less than enrag'd at the Arrival of this new Envoy. He thought the <HI>Cardinal Primate</HI> ask'd him Succours, on∣ly to make his own Terms the better. So he sent back his Envoy with Letters, signifying what he had already declared to the <HI>Pope,</HI> namely, That he would concern himself no more in the matter. His Emi∣nence was too happy in making use of the Cardinal Nuncio to interceed for him with his <HI>Polish Majesty.</HI> There was a Treaty made between the Parties, by which the <HI>Cardinal Primate</HI> promis'd on his own be∣half, and in behalf of his Party, to own that Prince for their Soveraign. The King of <HI>Poland,</HI> for his part, promis'd to give him some Satisfaction upon the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia</HI>'s Account. By this <HI>Treaty</HI> there was also an Authentick Provision made for the Injury done to the <HI>Cardinal Primate</HI>'s Dignity, by the boldness of that <HI>Prelate</HI> in Proclaiming and Crowning the King after his Election. It was also agreed upon by this <HI>Treaty,</HI> That the Nation should never lay down their Arms, until they had oblig'd the <HI>Turks</HI> to restore <HI>Caminieck</HI> and <HI>Podolia.</HI> For it was alledg'd, That if the late King of <HI>Poland</HI> had been cordial in the War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> he might have recover'd it; but he who had sav'd <HI>Christendom</HI> by the seasonable Succours he brought to <HI>Vienna,</HI> which had he only delay'd three Days longer, all had been lost without Remedy, became so lazy in
<PB N="205" REF="364"/>
what concern'd the <HI>Republick,</HI> that one would have thought he had lost his Senses. However, by this <HI>Treaty</HI> they oblig'd the new King to carry on the <HI>Siege</HI> at his own Expences, and upon these Condi∣tions they condescended he should keep his Troops in the Country, though formerly they murmur'd extreamly for that these Troops had enter'd the Kingdom contrary to their Laws and Customs. And even from that Subject took occasion to exclaim highly against him, as if he had entred the Nation by force, and mean'd to secure it by Conquest, ra∣ther than by lawful means.</P>
<P>After the Conclusion of this Treaty, the Cardi∣nal Primate went from <HI>Lowits</HI> to pay his Homage to the King at <HI>Warsaw.</HI> His <HI>Majesty</HI> sent the prin∣cipal Gentlemen of his Court to meet him, and ho∣nour his <HI>Entry,</HI> which had much more the <HI>Air</HI> of a <HI>Triumph,</HI> than what was due to the merit of a <HI>Cri∣minal.</HI> He was accompanied into the Palace by a great many Persons of Quality, who were over∣joy'd to see this Reconciliation. The King and he had a private Interview for half an hour. It was generally believ'd, that the Troubles of the Kingdom were now at an end; and in effect, the Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> having lost all hopes of seeing her Son upon the <HI>Throne,</HI> which till that time she never despair'd of, ask'd his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Leave to pass some time at <HI>Rome.</HI> The King refus'd it before he advis'd with his Council, which was compos'd of the principal Senators of the <HI>Nation.</HI> However, they saw no in∣conveniency in granting it, and gave her to know that she should not be hindred to depart when she thought fit. Accordingly she put her self in a readi∣ness to be gone against the latter end of the Year. Every Person applauded that Princess's Conduct, for after all she had done to hinder the <HI>Election</HI> of his Majesty, as well as of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> she could hardly remain in the Kingdom with any satis∣faction, nor could she handsomely pass into <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="365"/>
where it was impossible for his Most Christian Maje∣sty to see her without Indignation; yet it was generally believ'd she would chuse <HI>France</HI> for her Retreat, it being natural for People to love the place of their Nativity. For it was openly report∣ed, That she was treating with the Duchess of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and her Son, the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> for the Duchy of <HI>Aubigny</HI> in <HI>Berry,</HI> which the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. bought for that Duchess upon cer∣tain Conditions, not very acceptable to her. But the King being sensible, that if he did not tie her up to such Terms, a Woman of her Temper might be reduc'd to end her Days in an Hospital, was therefore glad to do her this kindness against her Inclination. He had already a Mistris of the same Temper, namely, the Duchess of <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> who had lavish'd away all that the King had given her. However, he bestow'd large Sums upon the Duchess of <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> and such was his Liberality, that he had laid out above a Million of Money for <HI>China</HI> to her. But though there be nothing harder than the Substance 'tis made of, she found out a way to melt it all at <HI>Paris,</HI> without suffering any other inconvenience by it, than what ordinarily attends <HI>Misery.</HI></P>
<P>However, it was not altogether impossible to ac∣commodate the Difference betwixt the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his <HI>Most Christian Majesty,</HI> if her <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lish Majesty</HI> would condescend in some measure to imitate the Count of <HI>Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk</HI> mention'd before She might have own'd her self in the wrong, and sup∣plicated his <HI>Majesty</HI> for the Honour of his Prote∣ction; but she was too haughty to condescend to it, insomuch, that she was now wholly intent upon leaving speedily a place where her Circumstances had suffer'd so sensible an Alteration. For during her Husband's life-time, every one was glad to truckle to her, in regard of the Ascendant, they knew, she had over him. Now the Scene was
<PB N="207" REF="366"/>
chang'd, and so different from the former, that every one was ready to impute to her, what was blam'd in her Husband, as if she had been the only Person who prompted him.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> being thus own'd by the <HI>Pope,</HI> and wanting only now to be recogniz'd by his Most Christian Majesty, in order to enjoy peaceably the Dignity of a Crown that had been so much dispu∣ted, sent a Person of Quality to <HI>France,</HI> to excuse the Robbery committed upon the Abbot of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lignac</HI>'s Equipage, and to establish a good Correspondence with his <HI>Majesty;</HI> for, though in appearance he had no need of him, especially, being so strictly join'd in Alliance with the Emperor, and all the Princes his Neighbours; yet, considering that Kings have long Arms, especially the King who governs <HI>France</HI> at this time, he would omit nothing that was due to Policy. The King receiv'd his <HI>Envoy</HI> with all the marks of Respect he could wish for, and all Parties forgeting the occasion of their Differences, a good Intelligence and Union was establish'd be∣twixt the two Nations, though hardly to that degree it had been formerly. In the mean time, the King return'd to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> the Money he had expended in the pursute of that Crown, which in all probability pleas'd him much more, than if he had obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>it.</HI> Not that he is Covetous in any degree, but continuing still Amorous, the satisfa∣ction he enjoy'd in seeing his <HI>Mistriss,</HI> rendred him insensible of all other pleasures. Besides, he was soon comforted for the loss of that Dignity, by the liberal share he had with the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> in the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Favour, and the hopes he had of gaining his Process before the Court of Parliament, as he had done formerly.</P>
<P>However, there happen'd an Accident to the Duke, that was like to deprive him both of that Advantage and his Life. In his return from <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> a House which King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had given to the
<PB N="208" REF="367"/>
Lady <HI>Jane Gabriell,</HI> of whom he was descended: He was like to be drown'd in a Post-Chaise, for he was up to his Chin in a little River, which he was oblig'd to pass, and it being the middle of Winter, the Cold which he suffer'd, was capable to do him all the mischief that could be expected from so cruel an Accident. But as he is a Noble Prince, who delights to do good, and has no Enemies; and be∣sides, had acquir'd a great deal of Glory before <HI>Barcelona;</HI> so every one was overjoy'd to see their Fears end more happily than they expected. It on∣ly cost him a <HI>fright;</HI> however, this General, who by his Conquest, had gain'd the Reputation of the greatest <HI>Hero,</HI> being subject to a great many Infir∣mities, as well as the <HI>Ancient Hero</HI>'s, found himself so bad, that he was oblig'd to apply himself to Physicians. He had contracted a Disease that gave him more trouble, than the taking of four <HI>Barcelona</HI>'s. And his trouble was so much the greater, that his Malady was of an old standing, and created him every moment insufferable Pains; he enjoy'd no manner of rest, and it was to be fear'd; that if he neglected it any longer, it might be pass'd all cure. He resolv'd to put himself into the hands of a Chy∣mist Physician, nam'd <HI>Chambon.</HI> This Gentleman was nothing different from those of his Kidney, that is to say, neither better nor worse than a Quack, who boast as highly, as if they were many degrees above <HI>Aesculapius;</HI> but if he cured four Persons, he certainly kill'd a whole Dozen, and the Cures he had perform'd, were rather the Pro∣duct of <HI>Chance</HI> than of <HI>Skill.</HI> He was much at one with Dr. <HI>Carette,</HI> who had but one Remedy for all manner of Diseases, and yet would have Mankind believe that he was the ablest <HI>Physician</HI> in the Uni∣verse. Be it as it will, this new Physician set him∣self up in form, because he had cured some few Persons in the World, and amongst others, a cer∣tain Abbot of <HI>Chaulieu,</HI> who was a sort of Inten∣dant
<PB N="209" REF="368"/>
of the House of <HI>Vendome.</HI> This Abbot was very desirous that the Duke would make use of <HI>Chambon</HI> to cure him. However, the Duke withdrew in a short while, and had no great reason to brag of his Physician's Remedies. For <HI>Chambon</HI> did nothing, and at this time, the Duke finds himself in little bet∣ter Circumstances, than when he first made use of him. It may be rather said, That he is still worse, for the more inveterate these Diseases are, they are the more difficult to be cur'd. Yet some will have it, that his Grand-father found the means to be cur'd after Forty Years; but that was scarce done by the Skill of a Chymist, and its probable, that if his Grand-son had copied him, he had apply'd him∣self to some other Person, than his Intendant's Fa∣vourite.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had no reason to complain of his Daughter's Marriage; but knowing that the King had no mind to have it consummated, he in∣treated his <HI>Majesty</HI> to consummate it, to the end his Daughter's Condition might be more secure. He was afraid that the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> might come to die by some mischance, and so his Daughter be return'd upon his hand. But that was far from his Majesty's Inclination; on the contrary it was well known, if that had happen'd, he would have mar∣ried her to the Duke of <HI>Anjou;</HI> and in view of that only, he hindred all Commerce betwixt them, to the end, that a Dispensation might be the more easily obtain'd. I can't tell, whether the King made his Design known to him; but it is certain, that after the Marquiss of <HI>Ferrette</HI> had spoke to him by his Majesty's Command, the Duke was not only out of all hopes, but shew'd no Inclination to it. However, if he could not obtain that Demand, he succeeded (in a short time after) much better in another he made to his <HI>Majesty.</HI> He intreated him to Banish Madamoselle <HI>de Soissons</HI> (whose Conduct was offensive to him) out of his Kingdom. He also
<PB N="210" REF="369"/>
desir'd of him to cause shut up Madamoiselle <HI>de Ca∣rignan</HI> in a Convent. The last shew'd a great deal of Complaisance to a married Man, who lived after a very indifferent manner with his own Wife; whether it was that he had inherited that of his Fa∣ther, who had never been a good Husband, or that the Affection he had for this Princess, made him peevish at the sight of all others. It was much suspected, that the King himself was the principal Author of these Demands, to the end that these two Persons might no more be seen at Court, nor in <HI>Paris.</HI> Though they had the Honour to be so nearly related to the Duchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> yet their Behaviour was altogether unworthy of their great Quality; for besides their Conduct, that was not very regular, they were both in extream Necessity, and so far from being in Circumstances to support a Rank suitable to their Birth, that they had hardly wherewith to maintain sufficiently the Condition of very ordinary Persons; besides, the King was fain to supply them by his Royal Bounty, without which they had often wanted the very Necessaries of Life. The eldest was sent to <HI>Brussels</HI> to keep Company with her Mother, who resided there; the other was shut up amongst the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in the <HI>Suburbs</HI> of St. <HI>James,</HI> with express Order to the <HI>Superior</HI> of the Convent, that she should be permitted to speak to none, but certain Ladies, whose Names were transmitted to him in Writing. Madamoiselle <HI>de Carignan</HI> might have easily avoided this Indignity, if she had had a mind; she had been warn'd of it a long time before; and the King himself sent her word, that if she meant to please him, she would take a Maid of Honour of his Recommendation. At that time he offered her Apartments at <HI>Versailles,</HI> with sufficient Maintainance for that Lady of Honour; but she excus'd her self, under pretence, that she had one already, and that she could not handsomely accept of another, without exposing the first.
<PB N="211" REF="370"/>
However sincere she might have been in her Ex∣cuse, yet in a thing capable of a double entendre, People are more ready to take them in an ill Sense; every body believed that her Excuse pro∣ceeded only from the great desire she had to conti∣nue her Intrigue. But the King having put an end to it, after the manner above related, her Gal∣lant was to look for his Comfort where he could find it.</P>
<P>In all appearance he could not be so easily com∣forted, whether he thought that his Honour was concern'd, or that he was <HI>really</HI> afflicted, as he would have the World believe; he display'd his Wrath more than ever against his Wife, and though she was reputed a Lady of intire Virtue, yet (as it was generally believ'd) he us'd often to lay hands upon her. But till that time, she conceal'd very in∣dustriously what just Reason she had to exclaim against his Conduct; but after that, and several other Outrages, it was no more in her Power to dissemble her just Resentment of them. She com∣plain'd of them to all her Relations, that they might the more readily approve of her Intention to commence a <HI>Process of Separation of Bodies</HI> against him, for she had been of a long time <HI>separated</HI> in <HI>Goods,</HI> without which, she and her two Children had been reduc'd to the greatest <HI>Indigence.</HI> In effect, this Man's Conduct was so mean, that he went often, not only without one Penny of Money, but with∣out Cloaths and Hat. No body could disapprove of her design, which she put in Execution a few days after; and her Husband, who had retir'd from her some days before, told his Wife's Friends, that it was altogether needless for her to plead for a Sepa∣ration from him, since for a long time he desir'd no better, and would allow the <HI>Sentence</HI> to pass whenever she thought convenient. But there be∣ing many more People who delight in Debauche∣ry, than in vertuous <HI>Living;</HI> this Gentleman was
<PB N="212" REF="371"/>
nevertheless acceptable in certain Companies, even Princes countenanc'd him as they had usually done; and being one day at the Duke of <HI>Chartres</HI>'s Table, there was by chance some <HI>Sauce</HI> dropp'd by one of the Attendants upon his Cloaths; and however Plain and Coarse these Cloaths were, he was ex∣treamly vex'd at the Accident; no wonder, for he had got no other in his Wardrobe for a change. This he told the young Prince betwixt Jest and Vexation. The Prince seem'd not to re∣gard it, but talking with the Company, said, <HI>That ordinarily Misfortunes attended them who were least able to support them.</HI> He intreated two or three Per∣sons of Quality, who were there, to go keep him Company the next day: <HI>For in all appearance,</HI> said he, <HI>you'll find him in Bed while he sends his Cloaths to the Scourers, and at least that will be some Comfort to him.</HI> This poor Husband was actually oblig'd to do what the Duke said; but the next day the young Prince sent him four Suits made by his own Taylor, to the end, that if any such misfortune befel him ano∣ther time, it should never hinder him to appear as usually.</P>
<P>About that time the King caus'd to Arrest one of the Ushers of his Chamber, one of the most visio∣nary Companions in the Universe, whom, not∣withstanding his <HI>Majesty</HI> allow'd to Discourse with very often, in regard he durst not let his Folly ap∣pear before the King, which he had not the wit to conceal in other Company. He had of a long time thought to cause Hang all the Seamen, from the Marshal <HI>D'Estree</HI> and <HI>Tourville</HI> to the very meanest. He pretended they were all Rogues, upon certain Memoirs which a Commissary of the Marines (who was broke) had given him. He had impor∣tun'd his Majesty a thousand times upon it, and re∣presented to him, that if he would examine the Abuses which had crept into the several Employ∣ments of these Officers; he might find a fair op∣portunity
<PB N="213" REF="372"/>
of raising, justly, a Tax upon them to the tune of Sixty Millions. It was about the mid∣dle of the War when he spoke after this manner to the <HI>King;</HI> they had a deal of difficulty to raise Money, and therefore his <HI>Majesty</HI> thought the Ad∣vice was not to be despis'd, and supposing there might be somewhat in it, he sent him to Mon∣sieur <HI>Pontchartrain:</HI> But that highly displeas'd this Extravagant Gentleman, who probably had a mind to regulate this Affair himself with his Majesty, or perhaps design'd to involve that <HI>Minister</HI> in these pretended Malversations; for a Fool is capable of any Extravagancy. However, he was oblig'd to obey the <HI>King;</HI> there was hardly a Person to be found, who thought himself more able and fit for business than this Fool. But Monsieur <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> being as Prudent, as he was rash, knew presently how little ground this <HI>Numskul</HI> had for what he advanc'd. He acquainted the King with it. His <HI>Majesty</HI> was much of the same Opinion; yet this Man, who had the opportunity to speak to his Majesty, whenever he pleas'd, could not be per∣swaded of his Error, but still presented new Memorials to him, by which he intreated him to appoint some other Commissioners to hear him, who might have more leasure to examine the mat∣ter, than Monsieur <HI>Pontchartrain;</HI> offering upon pain of Death to make out what he advanc'd to be as clear as Day-light. This <HI>Confidence</HI> of his, together with some secret <HI>Springs</HI> he set at work, made the King resolve to give him a <HI>Hearing.</HI> He obtain'd also some <HI>Acts of Council,</HI> by which he pretended to give a light to some obscure Affairs. From that time forward, this rash <HI>Numskul</HI> never saw any of the Officers of the Marine enter into the King's Chamber, but he told to such as were by him, that these Gentlemen were to be tax'd in immense Sums; one in two Millions, some in more, some in less; and he though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t himself already one of the
<PB N="214" REF="373"/>
first <HI>Peers</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> because he had ask'd of his <HI>Majesty</HI> a share of what was to be recover'd of these Gentlemen by the Tax; and the <HI>King</HI> had granted it to him; but himself had promis'd a share of it to such as were capable to ingratiate him with his <HI>Majesty.</HI> This must needs have been very disa∣greeable to the Person concern'd. However, this little Gentleman forgot himself more and more daily, even to that degree of Impudence, as to vaunt, that notwithstanding all what Monsieur <HI>Pont∣chartrain</HI> was able to do, he did not doubt in the least to succeed in his Enterprize. In fine, That <HI>Minister</HI> being no longer able to bear with his Extra∣vagancies, made it his business to represent them to the King. He had slighted them long before, as well as the Person who was guilty of them. He thought him only unworthy to be regarded; but every one told him, That his Interest was concern'd more than he was aware of, in making his <HI>Majesty</HI> acquainted with the truth of the Affair, for he ha∣ving the whole Power of the Sea-Affairs, it seem'd as if he accus'd him under-hand, of conniving at these pretended Abuses, that he suffer'd in others. So he was at last prevail'd upon by these Reasons; and therefore made known to the King, that this Man was only an extravagant mad Fool, fitter to be sent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> than countenanc'd by so great a King; that his Impudence, or rather his Madness, appear'd too evidently, in daring to accuse two <HI>Mar∣shals</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> together with the whole Body of the Sea-Officers, without any regard to so many Per∣sons amongst them, equally considerable for their Services, and distinguished by their Quality; and very incapable of doing any thing against their Du∣ty; who came daily to him to demand Justice of that Fool for his Insolence, and intreated him ear∣nestly to represent it to his Majesty. He added that he hop'd, that his Majesty would cause to examine once for all, the Accusations of that unaccountable
<PB N="215" REF="374"/>
Fool, to the end he might be confounded, when it should be made manifest that the Accusation was ra∣ther visionary than real.</P>
<P>The King having heard this <HI>Minister</HI> very atten∣tively, promis'd to do all he demanded, without loosing any time. Accordingly he commanded the Commissioners whom he had ordain'd to exa∣mine that Affair, to search narrowly into it. The Commissioners apply'd themselves presently to it, and having discover'd that all what he advanc'd, was in effect nothing else but the Imagination of his empty Brain, they gave his <HI>Majesty</HI> a full account of it. The King immediately forbid that Man ever to trouble him any more with that Affair; but he not being wise enough to take the advantage of this Advice, would still insist as formerly, and had al∣most said, that all of them had conspir'd to save the guilty. The King told him a second time, that he commanded him absolutely never to speak to him of that Affair, though he was so good as to conceal what he had reason to believe of him. This Man thought at last his best way was to dis∣semble, and obey his <HI>Majesty</HI> in appearance. But while he seem'd to be silent, he left no Stone un∣turn'd to return to his former Trade. He brought over the Knight of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to his side, in order to engage the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> in the Affair; and tho' such eternal <HI>Protens</HI>'s as this Knight, are little to be credited, yet he made use of his Interest with that Prince to succeed in his design. The <HI>Duke</HI> spoke of it to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> who was exceedingly sur∣prized, that this little Gentleman dar'd to fall upon these Methods, after he had expresly forbid him. He told freely his Sentiments of it to the Duke, and forbid him ever to concern himself with such Affairs. From that time the King resolv'd to get rid of him, though it is always against his Inclina∣tion, when he falls upon such extream Measures with any, who had the Honour to be his Dome∣stick;
<PB N="216" REF="375"/>
for no Prince ever shew'd greater kindness to his Servants. However he suspended his Resolution until he saw that it was impossible to make him Prudent. This little Gentleman being severely check'd by the Knight of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> because he brought him into bad terms with the Duke of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI> was still so Impudent, as to put up a Petition in the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI>'s Name, without ever acquainting him with it beforehand. It's true, he had been twice at the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Lodgings after he had done it, without having the opportunity of meeting with him. He hop'd that the <HI>Duke,</HI> who was in very good Terms with his <HI>Majesty,</HI> would regard his Vi∣sions as real Truths, and espouse his Interest as his own. This Petition was presented to his <HI>Majesty</HI> before the <HI>Duke</HI> had time to return home, and the King made mention of it to the Duke. He made him also the same Compliment he had made for∣merly to his Brother, the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> to wit, that he would not take it kindly if he harken'd to that impertinent Fool, or ever spoke of his Affairs to him. The Duke extreamly surpriz'd at this Check, which he had by no means deserv'd, be∣cause the Petition had been given in without his knowledge, protested to the King that he was igno∣rant of what he meant, and was so far from excu∣sing his Fault, that he desir'd Justice for what he had done. The King promis'd to give him full Satisfa∣ction, and resolv'd now more than ever to get rid of such a dangerous and medling Fool. However, as if this <HI>Numskul</HI> had not already done enough towards his own Ruin, he wrote a Letter, in which he com∣plain'd, that the <HI>King</HI> himself oppos'd the Service he intended to do him: This Letter was intercepted and brought to his <HI>Majesty.</HI> He found it too Inso∣lent to confine his Punishment only to a Banish∣ment from his Presence. He caus'd him to be sent to the <HI>Bastile,</HI> where he was commanded in the King's Name to lay down his Charge. He shifted
<PB N="217" REF="376"/>
the matter for a while; but in the end, it being insinuated to him, that he must expect to continue Prisoner there for life, if he would not comply; he chus'd to do the last.</P>
<P>The Sea-Officers were not the only Persons who were accus'd unjustly. There came about that time a certain Abbot of Quality from a Foreign Country, of whom they took the liberty to say no better things. For they accus'd him of having desir'd to speak with King <HI>William,</HI> before the Peace was sign'd, and to perswade him, that he ought not to think of making a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> for that <HI>France</HI> could not fail to be absolutely destroy'd, if the War was con∣tinued two Years longer. His Family being one of the most considerable of all <HI>Britain,</HI> was extreamly afflicted when they heard him talk'd of after that manner, especially his eldest Brother, who was in the Service, and pretty well advanc'd. He durst not shew himself any more to the <HI>King,</HI> fearing his <HI>Majesty</HI> would make him answerable for the Crime alledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against his Brother. Nevertheless, his Ma∣jesty, after the Example of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> had long before explain'd himself upon that Head, saying in presence of all the Court, <HI>That every one should bear his own Crime, and that Relations were not to be answer∣able for the Iniquities of their Relations:</HI> And in effect, one of the <HI>Musqueteers</HI> having committed a horrid Murder in the Year 1676. His <HI>Majesty</HI> knew no sooner that his Brother, who was a Captain of Horse, was so extreamly afflicted at it, that he design'd to make his escape into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> than he ad∣vanc'd him in the Life-Guards. He could give no more evident Proof to all the World, that he ne∣ver meant to make one answerable for another's Crime. However, this <HI>Abbot</HI>'s Brother being a Man of singular Honour, though he was sensible of the <HI>King</HI>'s Justice, yet he could not avoid g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieving extreamly at it; and what added much to his Grief, was, that he distrusted his Brother altogether. He
<PB N="218" REF="377"/>
knew very well, that his little Band never hindred him from doing many things, which reflected migh∣tily upon that Habit. He had occasion'd a Divorce betwixt a Husband and a Wife. He carried on an amorous Intrigue with a President's Wife, which occasion'd great wrangling betwixt them; nor had the Husband stopt his Resentment there, if his Re∣lations and Friends had not convinc'd him, that a great many Chances attend our Lives, which it were better to conceal than declare. These things he partly believ'd, but it was not in his Power to hinder himself from Murmuring, which did the <HI>Abbot</HI> a great deal of injury, who both by his Quali∣ty and his Brother's Service, pretended to have alrea∣dy a good <HI>Abbey,</HI> but now saw himself a thousand Miles distant from it. The King, who desires that every one should mind his Duty, that is to say, that a Soldier be a Man of Courage, that a Judge be Just, and a Church-man Honest and Pious; no sooner knew that he made it his practice to De∣bauch other Men's Wives, instead of confirming them in Virtue, than he absolutely forbid Father <HI>de la Chaise,</HI> (who had put him down in his Pocket-Book, in order to have a good Benefice) ever to propose him any more as a Subject worthy of any Dignity.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Abbot,</HI> who had more <HI>Quality</HI> than <HI>Riches,</HI> was extreamly vext to see his hopes so frustrated by his own faults. However, knowing that there was Mercy for all Sins, he put himself into a <HI>Seminary,</HI> Whether he truly repented of what he had done, or would make the World believe he did so; by these means he meant to free his <HI>Majesty</HI> of the bad Impression he might have of his Conduct, and insinuate himself into his Favour. The King, who is a very Judicious Prince, and is seldom or never mistaken in his Opinion of Persons, did not allow himself to be impos'd upon by that Change, so very different from his former Life. For he Preach'd,
<PB N="119" REF="378"/>
Fasted, and Catechiz'd; and in a word, there was not one Church-man, not only in the <HI>Seminaries,</HI> but even within twenty Leagues round it, whose Conduct was more Exemplary than his. Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> was very desirous to oblige him, but could never comprehend whence arose the <HI>King</HI>'s Aver∣sion for him; being naturally good, and more in∣clin'd to judge well than ill of any Person, he took occasion to speak to his <HI>Majesty</HI> of him, and represented to him, that the Austerity of his Life, and his regular Conduct, did not only deserve an <HI>Abbey,</HI> but even a <HI>Bishoprick;</HI> that the greatest Sin∣ners become ordinarily the greatest Saints; and if <HI>God Almighty</HI> were like him, they must blot out of the Calendar a great many Saints; who after ha∣ving committed very great Crimes, had shew'd the Abbot the way he follow'd at present. The King was nothing mov'd at his Confessor's Discourse. On the contrary he answer'd him, that he might blot him out of the List of Bishops, as he had done a while ago out of the List of Abbots, for he never would honour him with that Dignity.</P>
<P>I do not know, if ever this Answer was made known to the Abbot, or if he was already weary of passing his Days in a <HI>Seminary,</HI> and waiting so long time for a Benefice, of which he saw no ap∣pearance; whatever was the matter, he chang'd his <HI>Residence</HI> very soon. It's true, it did not renew his Intrigue with the <HI>President</HI>'s Wife, or with any other. On the contrary, he avoided all for a long time, as if he meant to continue the Life that he made so great a shew of in the Eyes of all <HI>France.</HI> But whether he saw that they would eye him nar∣rowly, or that he intended to continue his Course, he pass'd into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he apply'd himself to Catechizing every day: He also began to assist dy∣ing Persons; and the Marquiss of <HI>Blanch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford,</HI> se∣cond Son to the Duke of <HI>Crequi,</HI> falling Sick about that time, it was he that exhorted him to prepare
<PB N="220" REF="379"/>
himself for the Passage that appears so terrible, espe∣cially to those of such a youthful Age as he was of. Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> took occasion upon this also, to speak to the <HI>King</HI> in favour of this <HI>Abbot.</HI> He told him, that the Abbot did not require his Presence to oblige him to good Actions, and so he could not be reproach'd (as a great many others might justly be) with Hypocrisy. But the King nothing mov'd by this new Attack, answer'd, <HI>That he could never perswade him but that the Abbot was no good Man; that time would discover very soon which of them was most deceived, but he did not believe it was himself.</HI> Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> reply'd, <HI>That he was afraid his Majesty of∣fended</HI> God Almighty, <HI>in judging so badly of his Neigh∣bour.</HI> But his Majesty return'd it smartly home, in saying, <HI>That he was afraid, that he offended him more, in desiring him to give a Bishoprick to a Man, whom he thought altogether unworthy of it.</HI> I know not whe∣ther this Answer came to the Abbot's Ears, but all of a sudden he left the great desire he had shown (while in <HI>Flanders</HI>) to Catechize Men; and without acquainting any Person with his design, went into <HI>Holland</HI> to caress the Women there; at least he was seen doing it soon after his arrival. However, his going often to the House of one of the Plenipoten∣tiaries, gave occasion to some People to say, <HI>That this</HI> Preacher <HI>was not only debauch'd, but also a very dangerous M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> In a word, he was suspected to have given not only Memoirs to that Ambassador, but also to have had a private Interview with King <HI>William,</HI> and reveal'd to him a great many Secrets. However, all that was false, nor had he any other design to go so often to that Ambassador's, than to pay his Respects to a Person who fill'd the Presi∣dent's Lady's Room in his Heart. She was also somewhat more deserving than the other, without doing her any injustice. However, as one Lye ge∣neral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y begets a great many amongst those who vent them; the next Day all <HI>Paris</HI> would have it,
<PB N="221" REF="380"/>
that the King had wrote to King <HI>William</HI> to entreat him, to send him the <HI>Abbot</HI> bound Hand and Foot; they made it also known to the pretended Crimi∣nal by a Letter unsign'd, and the Hand-writing was altogether unknown to him; but advised him, if it came seasonably to his Hand, he would make it his Business to save himself by flying to <HI>Turky,</HI> rather than suffer himself to be taken.</P>
<P>The poor Abbot was much astonished at this Ac∣cusation; if they had accus'd him of being Amorous, he had been oblig'd to own it, because it was true. Neither the <HI>Seminary</HI> where he had been, nor the Mortifications which <HI>Pere de la Chaise</HI> had advanc'd so much in his Favour to the <HI>King,</HI> were capable to wean him from that unhappy Passion to which (to his great Misfortune) he was very subject. In fine, knowing himself not only Innocent, but also unca∣pable of the crime laid to his Charge, he went to wait upon Monsieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> in order to ask him, if he had receiv'd the <HI>Order,</HI> of which they had given him Advice secretly; if so, he came to put himself into his Hands, so that it would not be necessary to Arrest him; and if it was sent to any other Person, he came however to deliver himself Prisoner to him, that they might not be at the trouble to search for him; he intreated him to acquaint the King with it, that his <HI>Majesty</HI> might be satisfied of his In∣nocence, until he could make it evident before any Commissioners his Majesty should be pleas'd to ap∣point. Monsieur <HI>Harlai</HI> had heard somewhat of the Matter before. This oblig'd him to examine his Conduct, and to set some Spies upon him, in order to watch whither he went at some certain hours; for he judg'd that it must needs be about that time that he was most busied about his Treason, if Fame was to be believ'd; but at last, these Spies reported to Monsieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> that he was altogether took up about his <HI>Mistriss,</HI> which justified him so
<PB N="222" REF="381"/>
much in his Opinion, that he gave him to know, he wish'd with all his heart, the Prison he was en∣gag'd in, might not prove more troublesome to him, than what he came to look for at his House; that it would not prove very hard for him to break his Chains, because he not only declar'd him free, but also Innocent of what was laid to his Charge, as far as consisted with his Power. However he believ'd, that his Heart was not so much upon the <HI>French,</HI> as it had formerly been; but as it's impo∣ssible to be always in Love, he was perswaded it might return to its former Inclination when he thought least of it; and by these means he might be at ease, for he would secure him, none would impute to him this as a great Crime. In effect, this was the Abbot's Crime: And though he was shelter'd in it from all he was threaten'd with; nevertheless he was not so happy as to continue always in the good Esteem of Father <HI>de la Chaise.</HI> He durst not speak any more in his Favour to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> considering he had set up a <HI>Holland</HI> Lady in the place of the President's: His <HI>Majesty</HI> ask'd also that good Father, if he was now con∣vinc'd, and if he intended still to demand a Bisho∣prick for that Abbot. The Jesuit was somewhat humbled at that Reproach, and all he could say for his Justification, was that he could not hin∣der himself from being impos'd upon, by the Tricks of an Hypocrite, no more than any body else.</P>
<P>But if his <HI>Majesty</HI> was proof against the Recom∣mendations of his Father Confessor, whose Opi∣nion in Matters of that Nature gains generally the <HI>King</HI>'s Consent, the Case was quite different with regard to another <HI>Abbot,</HI> whom this good Father protected also. I mean the <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Coadlet,</HI> whose sad Adventure has no Parallel in any Ancient or Modern History, nor perhaps ever will have in those to come. Not but that they afford us Examples
<PB N="223" REF="382"/>
enough of depos'd Bishops; but as that is seldom done but by the Authority of the Church, or upon the account of manifest Heresy, or for some other Capital Crime, If I be not mistaken, I may confi∣dently say, <HI>that the History I mean to insert here, ex∣ceeds what can be said of these Examples.</HI> But be it as it will, the Abbot of <HI>Coadlet,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Bri∣tany,</HI> though he had already a Dignity in the <HI>Chap∣ter</HI> of <HI>Vannes;</HI> yet he thought it not amiss to ask some other little Benefice, by which means he might subsist the more conveniently, and confin'd the utmost extent of his Ambition to the having four or five thousand <HI>Livres</HI> a Year. And to that end, by the means of very good Friends, apply'd himself to Father <HI>de la Chaise,</HI> upon whom he believ'd all these Matters depended. This good Father told him, <HI>That he did himself an injustice in restricting himself to so narrow Bounds, and that he ought to ask some better thing, for he could hope to obtain it.</HI> The Abbot was over-joy'd to hear him speak after that manner; and as generally a good Appetite increases by eating; so this Gentleman of a little Abbot, was now very desirous to become a fat Bishop. However, he durst not mention it suddenly to <HI>Pere de la Chaise,</HI> but the good Father gave him to know, that the Dig∣nity he enjoy'd already in the Cathedral, render'd him worthy of the other, especially when it was joyn'd to all the other Qualities requisite for a Bi∣shop; so he got himself to be listed in the Catalogue of the Candidates for the <HI>Episcopal Dignity.</HI> How∣ever, he continued at <HI>Paris</HI> until the King had fill'd up some vacant Bishopricks, which had Pretenders enough. For now the Scene is alter'd from what it was formerly, amongst those, upon whom they conferr'd that Dignity, who said ingenuously, <HI>Nolo Episcopari:</HI> I will not be a Bishop. For now-a-days, they think at least, if they do not say, <HI>Volo Episcopari,</HI> (<HI>i.</HI> e.) I will be a Bishop, and no doubt they think it from their very Heart, because it is
<PB N="224" REF="383"/>
impossible to give an account of all the Friends they employ, or of all the Springs they set at Work, in order to obtain the <HI>Mitre.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbot of <HI>Coadlet,</HI> who knew pretty well the Secret how to come by it, was not sufficiently sa∣tisfied to hear only Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> for him, tho' he was the best Friend he could employ, but he apply'd himself to others also, who were capable to do him as considerable Service as the former. For he thought as in legal Processes, abundance of the Law breaks not the Law; so in offers of this nature, he could never make use of too many on his behalf. However, as there are many, who Ruin themselves in making use of the Methods that others save themselves by; so he found that what he took to be of greatest advantage, prov'd most destructive, and that to such a degree, that it's impossible for him ever to retrieve it. Being in∣form'd, That in the Age we live in, Women are as serviceable as any thing else; he made his Ad∣dress with his utmost Application to Marshal <HI>Crequi</HI>'s Lady, who was his Country-woman. That Lady promis'd him her Favour, and was as good as her Word. But he having likewise heard that old Wo∣men have not so much Interest as young ones, quickly abandon'd her, and took up with her Daughter-in-law, whom he took to be more capa∣ble to serve him. He waited upon her punctually every day; and in the Holy-week, he happening to be at her House, had not the power to refuse to accept of a match at <HI>Ombre</HI> that she propos'd to him; some say it was <HI>Bassette;</HI> but either of 'em is equally criminal before God, unless it be that the one is a greater Instrument of Passion than the other. However, he consider'd that 'twas not a proper Imployment for one that pretended to a Bishoprick, especially at such an unseasonable time; and for that reason he carefully requested the Lady, and all her Company, that the Doors might be kept
<PB N="225" REF="384"/>
very close lest any body should see him ingag'd in an Exercise so inconsistent with his Profession. 'Tis such a common thing at <HI>Paris</HI> to see the Gentlemen with the little Band playing at all sorts of Game, that the very Foot-men, who over-heard his Dis∣course, look'd upon him as a Hypocrite; but they were strangers to his Pretensions, and consider'd very little of what consequence it was to him, to have it conceal'd from the <HI>King,</HI> nor how necessary it was for him to have it kept secret, least it might blow up his design.</P>
<P>However, that Week having pass'd before the King heard any thing of these Transactions, he fil∣led up the vacant <HI>Benefices,</HI> according to his usual Custom, upon <HI>Easter-day,</HI> for he never names any body but at that time, whether it be, because it's a Formality of a long standing, or that the King's Confessors have introduc'd it in order to have them∣selves courted the more during the Interval; but passing over that, as a thing I have no mind to search into, we must believe, that this <HI>Abbot</HI> was only known to the King upon the account of his Bro∣ther, who was <HI>Lieuterant</HI> of the <HI>Guards;</HI> however seeing him first in the List of the <HI>Candidates</HI> for <HI>Bi∣shopricks,</HI> he ask'd his <HI>Father Confessor</HI> who this Man was. The <HI>Good Father</HI> meaning to do him a kind∣ness, had no mind to say any thing to his disad∣vantage, but extoll'd him to the Heavens for the best of Men; insomuch, that his <HI>Majesty</HI> believing him one of the best Men, and of the most exem∣plary Life in his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> nam'd him for the <HI>Bi∣shoprick</HI> of <HI>Poictiers.</HI> This news was no sooner known at <HI>Paris,</HI> than every body was amaz'd, for his name was never heard of out of his own <HI>Pro∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce</HI> before, though by what happn'd to him in a short time after, it was in every one's Mouth. Every body, who heard he was to have that <HI>Bi∣shoprick,</HI> believ'd he must be a Person of extraordi∣nary
<PB N="226" REF="385"/>
Virtue, in regard the King had chosen him to so good a <HI>Benefice,</HI> to the prejudice of a great many considerable Persons who expected it. But those who had play'd with him at the Marchioness of <HI>Crequi</HI>'s, made no Secret to tell others, that he was not so wonderfully <HI>Godly,</HI> for he had employ'd one day in the <HI>Holy Week</HI> at <HI>Game.</HI> This News came the same Day to the King's Ears, which made his <HI>Majesty</HI> pass that Night in a mortal Anxiety, fearing that <HI>God Almighty</HI> would call him to an Account for having <HI>nam'd</HI> a Person to a Bi∣shoprick, that was capable of so black an A∣ction.</P>
<P>The next Morning, Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> coming to him to have the <HI>List</HI> of those, who were named to the Benefices, <HI>Signed,</HI> as soon as the King saw this Abbot's Name underneath, instead of signing, he blotted it out: The <HI>Good Father</HI> ask'd him what he did, not understanding what he meant. The <HI>King</HI> answer'd, That there was a Man in that List, who did not merit to be there; that he knew nothing of him, when he had given him a Bishoprick, nor he himself could not have known him, when he propos d him as a fit Person; but, that he had been since justly represented to him, and that the over-sight he had committed, had al∣most thrown him into Despair. This reflected in some measure upon the <HI>Good Father,</HI> who had told him Wonders of this Man, the more to oblige those who had recommended him; and perhaps he himself believ'd all was told him to the advantage of that Person. However, the Jesuit altogether amaz'd at these Expressions, made use of the Au∣thority he had over his <HI>Conscience,</HI> to oblige him to change his Resolution. Though it was easy for him to judge, by what the King had said, that of necessity some People had given him a strange Character of that poor Abbot; yet he said, That
<PB N="227" REF="386"/>
we must not believe upon light grounds, all that we hear of our Neighbour, that he had often re∣commended to him the reading of the little Book of the <HI>Imitation</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and there he might see a Chapter done purposely upon that Subject; that <HI>Lying</HI> abounded in a great measure amongst Men, as well as Jealousy; insomuch, that his Majesty's Bounty was sufficient to move all the Malice of Hell against him.</P>
<P>The King having hearken'd attentively to what he said, reply'd, <HI>That it was no Lye they told him, as he imagin'd; that it was a thing happen'd lately in the presence of a great many, that he also knew the Witnesses; insomuch, that he had not the least ground to doubt of it.</HI> The <HI>Good Father</HI> desir'd to know what the matter was; the King made no Secret of it, adding moreover, <HI>That if Fame was to be cre∣dited, that Abbot was no less a Lover of the</HI> Sex <HI>than of Game.</HI> And in effect, this was told the King with a great deal of assurance; but whether he lov'd them or no, for I know no body hates them; it was certain that he gave no Scandal to the World that way, as his Enemies alledg'd; so the King was soon perswaded that he was impos'd upon in that Affair. However, Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> seeing that the other was a weighty Accusation, and that the King kept close to it, he thought of throwing some scruple into his Mind. He told him then, That there was more of Infirmity than of Crime in what the Abbot had done; that it was certain, it was rather out of Complaisance than Inclination, or want of due Respect to these <HI>Holy-Days,</HI> that he had handled the Cards at that time; that very few People knew of this his fault, but now all <HI>France</HI> would begin to pry into it, and even suspect an infinity of things, as soon as his <HI>Majesty</HI> should deprive him of what he had once conferr'd upon him; that his <HI>Majesty</HI> ought
<PB N="228" REF="387"/>
to be very cautions in giving that Scandal to his People, that certainly he must be answerable for it before <HI>God:</HI> That a small Reproof given in secret to that <HI>Abbot,</HI> would prevail more with him, and oblige him to ask <HI>God</HI> pardon for what he had done, and by this means all would be buried in Oblivion; that after all, it ought not to be re∣garded as a heinous fault, but in respect to the time it was committed, for he was not the only Ecclesiastick who a had Passion for <HI>Game;</HI> since there were many <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots,</HI> who made it their principal Exercise; though after all, they were not depriv'd of their <HI>Bishoprick</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> upon that ac∣count. He own'd freely to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> it were more decent for them not to do it, and was of Opinion, that these things ought to be none of their Diversions. But in fine, the Spirit of Man∣kind is weak, and there being four and twenty Hours in the Day, it is impossible to employ them all in Exercises of Piety, and therefore they are allow'd to refresh themselves with innocent Recre∣ations.</P>
<P>The King had no great opinion of this Morali∣ty, he thought it too loose, especially with regard to those Men who were the Subject of the Dis∣course. For he put a vast difference betwixt them and a Courtier, or a Man of the Sword, whom he thought might be allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d such things; but to believe that Ecclesiasticks ought to have the same extent of freedom, was a thing, with all due Re∣spect to his <HI>Father Confessor,</HI> he could never be per∣swaded off. So it being impossible to convince his Majesty by this Objection, he was fain to have recourse to some other Argument. He insisted upon the Scandal he was like to give, but that gaining nothing upon him, he pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him to advise with Heaven before he would determine absolutely the matter. His <HI>Majesty</HI> consented willingly. For in
<PB N="229" REF="388"/>
that he demanded only what became a good Chri∣stian, and was conformable to the Inclination of this Prince. So the King kneeling that very mi∣nute upon a Cushion, Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> kneel'd by him, to make him say the Prayers which he de∣sir'd. Prayers being ended, the <HI>Good Father</HI> ask'd him what return the <HI>Lord</HI> made. His <HI>Majesty</HI> re∣ply'd, <HI>Nothing of what you wish'd for, and that he was as resolute as formerly to execute his design.</HI> He added, <HI>That he saw it very inconvenient not to do it; for if he should make that</HI> Abbot <HI>a</HI> Bishop, <HI>and if he should neglect his Duty in his Diocess, God Almighty would one day call him to an Account for it; that he had faults enough of his own to answer for, without taking upon him those of other People; and he believ'd him too Good, and too Pious, to advise him otherwise.</HI> The <HI>Good Father</HI> was not yet put off with that Answer. He ask'd of the <HI>King</HI> as the last Favour, to suspend his Resolution until he should return from <HI>Mass,</HI> whither he was just agoing. He conjur'd him to invoke earnestly the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> that he might en∣lighten him. The <HI>King</HI> condescended very wil∣lingly; but not having receiv'd the Inspiration which the <HI>Good Father</HI> pretended, he declar'd, <HI>That he had blotted that Abbot out of the</HI> List, <HI>be∣cause he did not believe him so proper for a Bishoprick as he at first imagin'd.</HI> The poor <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Coadles</HI> heard of these News with all the Surprisal and Grief imaginable. He retir'd into a <HI>Seminary,</HI> there to bury his Vexation However, the King calling to mind what Father <HI>de la Chaise</HI> had said to him, and being desirous that he should be suspected of nothing but the <HI>Truth,</HI> declar'd at the same time, before all the Court, <HI>That what that Abbot had done in the</HI> Holy Week, <HI>was the only cause of his Misfor∣tune; that whatever else was said of him was false, and that he was oblig'd to give that Testimony in his Favour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="389"/>
The <HI>King</HI> having show'd himself so full of the fear of <HI>God</HI> in an Affair of so great Consequence, shew'd himself equally full of Justice in another Affair that concern'd a Man of the same Coun∣try. Which was as follows: a Counsellor of the Parliament of <HI>Britany,</HI> call'd <HI>Montchamp,</HI> having cudgell'd the Nephew of <HI>Moreau,</HI> the famous <HI>Actress</HI> in the Opera; and who gave some ground to speak of her upon an account different from what she acted upon the <HI>Theatre;</HI> the young Man carried his Complaint to his <HI>Majesty.</HI> The Coun∣sellor expected that his Interest in the Parliament, in whose Assembly that Affair was done, would shelter him from all Accidents. He treated alrea∣dy that Man very slightingly and meanly. But the Lady of that Opera, whom Persons of the first Quality ador'd, having espous'd her Nephew's Quarrel, obtain'd a private Letter in his favour. This Letter enjoyn'd the Parliament expresly to do the Plantiff so good, and so ready Justice, that he should have no reason to complain of it. <HI>Montchamp</HI> understanding by these means, that he had to do with a more powerful Party than he thought of; had recourse to such Tricks as are usual among the People of his Trade. He made a diligent Inquiry into the Life, not of the Aunt, (for it had been no difficulty in the least to prove a great many things of her) but of the Nephew. For he thought that if he could d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over any un∣warrantable Action in it, as he hop'd he might, he could at least retard the Process, which his Adver∣sary had commenc'd against him. However, not trusting very much to these hopes, he was fain to fall upon other Measures to get rid of this unlucky hit; and therefore intreated the Marshal of <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>'s Lady, who was his Relation, to cause an Accom∣modation to be propos'd to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="390"/>
This <HI>Actress</HI> was no sooner apply'd to, than she stood aloof. The <HI>Marshal</HI>'s Lady threaten'd her with the discovery the <HI>Counsellor</HI> made in her Ne∣phew's Life, on purpose to fright her. But whe∣ther she was afraid of nothing from that Facti∣on, or that she thought she had Friends enough to protect her, she carried her Pretensions so high as to demand Ten thousand Crowns of the <HI>Marshal</HI>'s Lady for her Nephew's Interest and Damages. As soon as the Lady had acquainted her Relations that there was no hopes of an Ac∣commodation for him, he spoke very scornfully of such an exorbitant Demand; so applying him∣self altogether to a vigorous Defence, he would certainly have confounded the opposite Party, if the Parliament had condescended to it. He gave in a Petition against the <HI>Plaintiff,</HI> shewing that he had two Wives. He desir'd to have a Decret pass'd against him; but bringing no valid proof for his Accusation, the <HI>Parliament</HI> durst not declare in his Favour, for fear of a Reprimand from the Court. For the secret Letter which they had re∣ceiv'd, together with a Letter from the <HI>Attourney-General</HI> of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> gave them to know, that they must proceed justly, if they meant not to have their <HI>Sentence</HI> liable to a Revi∣sal. Above all, they were afraid of the <HI>Aunt</HI>'s Friends, suspecting very much, that if they gave them the least ground of Complaint, they should have them, more than her, for their Adversaries. In fine, <HI>Montchamp</HI> failing in his Expectation, and not being able to produce any Proof for what he alledg'd; though he had employ'd some consider∣able Persons in it, Sentence was pronounc'd upon the Affair. He was suspended for six Months, and having receiv'd a Reprimand behind the <HI>Bench,</HI> he was condemn'd to pay the costs. He had made an offer before of Four thousand Livres to
<PB N="232" REF="391"/>
his Adversary; but by the Calculation made of the Charges, they did not amount to so much, which was no small Mortification for our <HI>Actress M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au.</HI> For had it depended upon her, she had protested against the <HI>Sentence.</HI> But the Gentlemen of the <HI>Robe</HI> assur'd her she would fail in the attempt, so that she was fain to condescend against her In∣clination.</P>
<P>As <HI>Britany</HI> furnishes us thus with an instance of <HI>Violence</HI> committed upon the Person of one of her Publick <HI>Magistrates,</HI> so <HI>Paris</HI> produc'd somewhat like it in the Son of one of her's; but what is something more, it was executed upon a Person of <HI>Quality.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Novion,</HI> Son to the late Monsieur <HI>Novion,</HI> Master of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> and Brother to the present Monsieur <HI>Novion, President</HI> of the <HI>Soveraign Court,</HI> falling in Love with a cer∣tain <HI>Chanoinesse,</HI> whose Mother was of the same Family with Monsieur <HI>de Caumartin,</HI> he humour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her to that degree, that he promis'd, as is alledg'd, to revenge her Quarrel upon a Gentleman, of whom she complain'd heavily. She was extream∣ly vex'd that this Gentleman, who call'd himself the Knight of St. <HI>Geniers,</HI> should have pressed her somewhat too hard to pay him some Money, that he alledg'd he had lent her. He had been for∣merly her <HI>Lover;</HI> but whether she pretended, that when once a Man is in Love with a Woman, he ought to give and not lend, or that he had de∣manded his Money after a rude manner; she had told the Marquiss so often, that this Gentleman was troublesome to her; that he was charg'd with what I am now to recount. The <HI>Knight</HI> of St. <HI>Geniers</HI> passing one Day along a Street that was pretty near his former Mistriss's Lodgings, was at∣tack'd by five or six <HI>Bravado</HI>'s of <HI>Paris,</HI> who are always at a short distance from one another, when they design any thing. And their Valour consists
<PB N="233" REF="392"/>
only in that, which has some Relation to what Monsieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> was us'd to say, namely, <HI>That</HI> God Almighty <HI>was always of the strongest side.</HI> In effect, their Train obliges those, who would have no regard for them, upon the lay of Man for Man, to shew them some Respect. But whether it was upon that account, or that the <HI>Knight,</HI> being one of <HI>Maltha,</HI> own'd no Enemy but a <HI>Turk,</HI> he had no Inclination to meddle with this Man. But this pretended <HI>Hero,</HI> who had serv'd his Apprenticeship to Slaughtering, being the Son of a Butcher, see∣ing the Knight took no notice of some small In∣dignities he had given him, had a mind to know, whether or no he had forgot his first Trade, though some time ago he had exchang'd it for the <HI>Rapier.</HI> He meant therefore to slit his Nose, and perform'd it so dexterously, that all the Nose was left the poor <HI>Knight,</HI> hung by one small Ten∣don, and he had certainly cut it off quite, had he not been hinder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by some People who interpos'd, but he made his escape while the <HI>Knight</HI>'s Wound was a dressing. The whole Town was immedi∣ately alarm'd at the boldness of this Action. It was no great difficulty for the <HI>Knight</HI> to judge who had hatch'd this Mischief; and therefore as soon as the Chyrurgion had dress'd him, he went im∣mediately and made his Complaint to the <HI>Commis∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y.</HI> The <HI>Lieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enant Criminal</HI> gave out a Warrant against the Bravado, and some other certain Gen∣tlemen who accompanied him in the Exploit. But as to the <HI>Marquiss,</HI> the <HI>Chanoinesse</HI> and her Mother, whom the Knight had likewise accus'd, he had some more Consideration for them; for the Re∣spect he had for their Relations, oblig'd him to proceed very nicely against them. He thought it sufficient to Issue out a personal Summons against the three: The Mother and the Daughter made their Compearance, and were interrogated. But the
<PB N="234" REF="393"/>
<HI>Marquiss</HI> of <HI>Novion</HI> durst not show his Counte∣nance, in regard his <HI>Bully</HI> had been so foolish as to suffer himself to be apprehended. But he retir'd to a Friend's House, hoping that by his Reputation in the <HI>Robe,</HI> he might save the Guilty from a just Punishment. But his <HI>Majesty</HI> being in∣form'd of the whole Affair by one of the <HI>Knight</HI>'s Friends, commanded the Matter to be examin'd very strictly, so that the <HI>Marquiss</HI> was fain to leave <HI>Paris,</HI> and save himself by flying to <HI>Swisser∣land</HI></P>
<P>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happy for these Women, that they never had either seen or heard of this Bully; insomuch, that he not being able to accuse them, they were without any farther difficulty absolv'd from their personal Summons. However, the <HI>Bully</HI> was sen∣tenc'd by the <HI>Lieutenant-Criminal</HI> to be hang'd, nor could he avoid giving of that <HI>Sentence.</HI> However desirous he was to oblige the <HI>Marquiss</HI>'s Family. The <HI>Marquiss</HI>'s Friends advis'd the Criminal to fear nothing, for the Parliament, to whom he had appeal'd, would infallibly clear him. But the Knight suspecting the matter, prevented their threatnings, and petition'd the King, to give him other Judges, which he obtain'd. The <HI>Appeal,</HI> instead of being brought before the Parliament, according to the usual Custom, was brought be∣fore the Great Council. The Measures of the <HI>Marquiss</HI>'s Friends and Relations being by this means quite defeated, they advis'd him to keep himself close where he was, for seeing his Affairs had taken so fatal a turn, it was by no means safe for him to return into the Kingdom. But being Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Britany,</HI> and all the World believing him guilty, a great many People made Interest to have his Regiment. Mon∣sieur <HI>de Boveron,</HI> the Marquiss of <HI>Harcourt</HI> s Father, ask'd it for the Marquiss of <HI>Sesane,</HI> his eldest Son
<PB N="235" REF="394"/>
of a second Marriage. For he had married for his second Wife, the Marquis of <HI>Genles</HI>'s Widow, who was the late Marshal <HI>de Fabert</HI>'s youngest Daughter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marquis</HI>'s Relations were sensible of what importance it was for them to weather this Storm; for if once the <HI>King</HI> dispos'd of his Regiment, it would not only prove a mortal Stroke to his For∣tune, that was already pretty low, but the World would also look upon it as a sort of Conviction against him. They therefore supplicated his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> that he would be pleas'd to delay that Affair for some small time, promising to oblige their Kinsman to return quickly in order to clear him∣self of the Crime laid to his charge; and alledg∣ing he was reduc'd to mean Circumstances, upon which account it would be equally acceptable to take away his Life, as his Regiment. The King, in consideration of their Services, granted their Request. And the Marquis of <HI>Sesane</HI> was oblig'd to provide for himself somewhere else, if he meant to have a Regiment. However, this made no stop in the <HI>Appeal</HI> of the <HI>Condemn'd Criminal,</HI> for the <HI>Sentence</HI> being confirm'd; when he perceiv'd that all their fine Promises were not sufficient to save him from a Rope, he charg'd the Marquis of <HI>Novion</HI> with the Crime at his Death. This <HI>Sen∣tence</HI> satisfied in some measure the Knight's Re∣venge, who always saw the Marks of his Affront when he look'd into his Glass. For tho' his Nose was stitch'd up, yet the Seam appearing, was no small Mortification to him; so that he could never be at ease until he had the same Satisfaction of others, that he had already of the <HI>Bully.</HI> He pro∣secuted them very eagerly before the same Tribu∣nal. However, he could never have his Revenge of them, as he pretended; for though he prevail'd so far, as to have the Cause remov'd from before
<PB N="236" REF="395"/>
the Parliament, where the <HI>Marquis</HI> had a great many Friends and Relations, and generally all Judges stick close by one another; yet to this mi∣nute the Affair remains undecided. For they start∣ed so many difficulties, that it is impossible for one of a more considerable Interest than his, to re∣move them; besides, to plead in Criminal Matters, requires a more weighty Purse than his, and yet could easily exhaust it. In the mean time, another Adventure happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to President <HI>Novion</HI>▪s Nephew, and however extraordinary the first appear'd, yet it bears no proportion with this I am about to men∣tion now.</P>
<P>This President's Wife was a Gentleman's Daugh∣ter, whose Office it was to give out the Powder, by which he had got immense Sums of Money. She had a Sister by her first Marriage, who was the Widow of a certain Man, call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Ombreval,</HI> Advocate-General of the Court of <HI>Aides,</HI> by whom she had some Children, and amongst the rest, a Son of one or two and twenty Years old: He stu∣died the Law, that he might succeed his Father in his Profession. This young Gentleman coming from the <HI>Law-School,</HI> saw two Jesuits passing along, and at the same time a Cart loaded with Bundles of Rods, then he told his Companions, that these <HI>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ples</HI> of St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> had often whipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him in the College, and he had a good mind to be reveng'd of them now that he found his opportunity; he mean'd to bang them like <HI>Bridewel-Birds,</HI> and to that in∣tent each of them might take a Bundle of these Rods from the Cart, and oblige these good Fathe's to ask them Pardon for all the Cruelty they had made them suffer before. In all appearance he had only said this to divert himself But his Companions understanding him literally, the most foolish, and most bold of 'em, leap'd upon the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and in spite of the Carman, unty'd the Bundles, took up hand∣fulls
<PB N="237" REF="396"/>
of the Rods, and like so many Furies fell upon the poor Jesuits, who never dreamt of the like Adventure. There was no great matter of Ceremony in the Compliment they made them. They told them only, they had often oblig'd them to pull down their Breeches against their Incli∣nation, and now they meant to do the like to them; that common Justice requir'd they should pay them presently for all the Evil they had suf∣fer'd by them, and they would make them sensible, by which means they intended to perform it. This Folly appear'd so extravagant, that the two Jesuits could never understand what they meant. But these <HI>Furies</HI> made them to know very quickly by falling suddenly upon them; that its altogether as dangerous to fall into the Hands of <HI>Scholars,</HI> as into the Hands of the most barbarous <HI>Hangman</HI> upon Earth. Some pull'd off their Cloaks, others their Gowns, while another Party unty'd their Breeches, another pull'd up their Shirts, the young <HI>Ombreval</HI> serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for Executioner, together with another of the same Family, who had consign'd his Money in order to be a Councellor of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>All the People got to the Windows upon the noise these poor Jesuits made, to call to the Neigh∣bours for Assistance; and among others, a pretty young Girl, who was more zealous than the rest, to hinder them from receiving any greater Affront, cry'd aloud, that it deserv'd a severe Punishment, as in effect it did; but perceiving she was not heard, she went down Stairs to see if her <HI>Presence</HI> could have a greater Influence than her <HI>Words;</HI> but alas! her Charity cost her very dear. For these Scho∣lars, who were far from having so much good na∣ture as she, seeing her espouse so earnestly the part of these good Fathers, that she reproach'd them for their Injustice; seiz'd her also, pull'd up her
<PB N="238" REF="397"/>
Peticoats behind, and whipp'd her as they had done the Jesuits. After that, she pleaded no more for them, but as soon as she got out of their Hands, she run in and shut the Doors, and got up to her Chamber in great Confusion and Vexation at her Adventure. The Jesuits had reason to be no less vex'd. However, though the same fate hap∣pen'd to them all, they having been all three whipp'd in the open Streets; there was still this difference in the Sequel, that the Adventure prov'd more fatal to the Girl than to them. The Fraternity receiv'd them always with the same kindness into the Convent. They vow'd also to revenge it in a little time, or dye in the Attempt; whereas the Girl was abandon'd by her Lover, and swore he would not have her; they had agreed upon their Marriage, and the Articles had been already sign'd, but he fearing that if he proceeded further, he might be call'd all over the Town, <HI>The Husband of the whipp'd Girl,</HI> could not endure to hear it spoken of. They threaten'd to prosecute him, if he did not make good his Promise. He answer'd, <HI>He valu'd it not, and that he would defend himself the best way he could;</HI> and its probable his Reasons might have prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, for every one condemn'd the Indis∣cretion of the Girl, to meddle where she was so lit∣tle concern'd.</P>
<P>This Action was too publick, and too bold, not to spread in an instant over all <HI>Paris.</HI> Monsieur <HI>D' Argenson</HI> had soon advice of it, and it being his Duty to find out Criminals, he sent so many of his Spies abroad, that he soon discover'd young <HI>Ombreval</HI> to be one of them. He also knew, that this Gentleman began the Fray, and was one of the Executioners, through whose Hands those Je∣suits had pass'd. He likewise found out the other's Name, who had executed the same Office, and caus'd them both to be taken up. President <HI>Novion</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="398"/>
was extreamly offended at him, as if he ought to have that deference for him, as not to treat after that manner a Person that concern'd him so nearly. But this Vanity and Haughtiness were very familiar to that Family, though it was of a far later stand∣ing than Monsieur <HI>D' Argenson</HI>'s. Before St. <HI>Innocent</HI>'s <HI>Shrine</HI> was alter'd, which was but lately, we had an <HI>Epitaph</HI> extant, that shows sufficiently, they have neither so much <HI>Nobility</HI> nor <HI>Grandeur</HI> in their <HI>Race,</HI> as they would make the World believe. It is far different from what we see at this time in the <HI>Celestines,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Gevres,</HI> one of that Family would have us believe, that he is lineally descended from St. <HI>Louis.</HI> Though the Family be only come from a <HI>Merchand,</HI> one <HI>Fourner,</HI> who made his Son an <HI>Advocate,</HI> and that Son laid the Foundation of the vast <HI>Grandeur.</HI> However it be, President <HI>Novion</HI> minding that less than the Post he possess'd, thought himself far above Monsieur <HI>D' Ar∣genson,</HI> and wrote to him very disrespectfully upon what he had done. Monsieur <HI>D' Argenson</HI> regarding his Letter very little, went on in his ordinary Course, so that the <HI>President</HI> was fain to take his Nephew out of Prison, and his Companion came out after the same manner: Both of them had a good many Friends, and the Accusation they were charg'd with, being destitute of Proof sufficient to bring them to a Tryal, they were very happily clear'd of it. This was all the Jesuits had for their Satisfaction, and the poor whipp'd Girl for her's; besides the Mortification of having miss'd of a Hus∣band, together with the Grief and Indignity she re∣ceiv'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>New King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> sent a <HI>New Ambassador</HI> to Court, namely, the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> his old Favourite. For the Earl of <HI>Albe∣marle</HI> only succeeded to him, if I may say so; for though he was his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's Darling,
<PB N="240" REF="399"/>
yet <HI>Portland</HI> was in as good Terms with his Master as ever. Moreover he had this advantage over the other, that besides the Favour which was common to them both, he was confided in. This <HI>Earl</HI> renew'd that <HI>Grandeur</HI> at our Court, which was to be seen in the time of the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI> when he came to demand in Marriage for the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Master, Mary Henrietta</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> Si∣ster to <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of glorious Memory. I mean by this, that he came with such a stately and magnificent Equipage, that the like had not been seen, of a long time, with an Ambassador. He had a permission to bring over with him some <HI>French-men,</HI> who had gone into <HI>England</HI> after the Revocation of the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> and who never durst have ventur'd to return afterwards without a Pass-port. However, <HI>Degrez,</HI> whom the Court had employ'd to take up <HI>Ministers,</HI> and other Per∣sons of that Religion, look'd upon this as a fa∣vourable opportunity for him, and did not fail to make his advantage of it. It being his ordi∣nary Custom to render every Person suspected, in order to make the best of his Trade, he upon a certain Day took up one of the Ambassador's <HI>Ministers,</HI> while he thought of going to see one of his Friends, who was an <HI>Advocate.</HI> It was very happy for this <HI>Advocate,</HI> that he had been all along a Catholick, for that <HI>Quality,</HI> and his wise Conduct shelter'd him from the evil Designs of this <HI>Kidnapper,</HI> whose Gain it was to cast every one in Prison. He told him freely his Sentiments of such proceedings; for he had no Orders to do what he did then, but it was his ordinary pra∣ctice, that he might be thought the more <HI>Zealous,</HI> though all his <HI>Zeal</HI> consisted only in his Interest. The <HI>Minister</HI> ask'd him, what it was he accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him of; and why he made his Prisoner after that manner, he being the Ambassador of <HI>England</HI>▪s

Domestick, to whom only he was oblig'd to give an account of his Conduct. It was upon that score that the Advocate exclaim'd against <HI>Degrez,</HI> making him to know, that the Court would never approve of such Proceedings. <HI>Degrez</HI> found himself oblig'd to answer all those Demands, which the Advocate back'd with all the Arguments he could invent, telling him, That he engag'd himself, as well as the King, in an unwarrant∣able Action. The Wound that the War had gi∣ven to <HI>France</HI> was still bleeding, and <HI>Degrez</HI> know∣ing that all this Mischief was brought upon them by the Ambassador's <HI>Master,</HI> he thought he was oblig'd to give him some Reason for what he had done. He told him that the <HI>Minister</HI> had administred the Sacrament to one of his Religion, and had sent for him to that end to the Ambas∣sador's House, and that being forbid, it was very warrantable for him to take him up, as he did. And thus he was not afraid to declare himself Sacrilegious, the better to colour his Design. In effect 'tis true, that was prohibited; but 'tis as true that the Minister was never guilty of it, and therefore desired to see the Person who ac∣cus'd him. Now <HI>Degrez</HI> had brought a Fellow along with him to the Advocate's Door, who had indeavour'd to impose upon the Clergy-man. For this Rascal had pretended to be a Protestant, and apply'd himself to the Minister to procure him a Pass-port for <HI>England.</HI> The Minister was in effect impos'd upon. He believ'd him in good earnest to be some poor Man, whom the Zeal for his Religion oblig'd to quit his Country and Friends; but knowing that was not permitted, he endeavour'd to comfort him, without giving him any other relief. But the Rascally Fellow had no mind to tell his Master that answer, or if he had, <HI>Degrez</HI> pleaded ignorance. However,
<PB N="242" REF="401"/>
the Minister was so exceedingly vex'd at this Calumny, that if his Character had allow'd him to meddle with any of them, he had doubtless bang'd the Villain to some purpose. But that being impracticable, he desir'd <HI>Degrez</HI> to cause ar∣rest him, and told him if he refus'd it, he must be answerable for it to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> and that the <HI>King</HI> their <HI>Master</HI> was capable to do him∣self Justice, and he might come to hear of it in a short time. The Advocate added, That he might find it to his disadvantage. These Expressions put the little Gentleman into a fright; he went to Mon∣sieur <HI>D'Argenson,</HI> to know of him how to be∣have in the matter. His Officers had always an eye upon the Minister after that; but Monsieur <HI>D'Argenson</HI> found that the Advocate had advis'd him well, and commanded him to put his advice in Execution. In fine, he was forc'd to send his Man to Prison, and set the Minister at liberty, according to the Order that Monsieur <HI>D'Argenson</HI> had given him. It's certain, this false Witness de∣serv'd to be hang'd, or at least to be sent to the Gallies, to teach all those of the like Kidney pru∣dence upon their own expences. But as the wick'd find favour rather than honest Men, whose mis∣fortune brings them into any inconveniency, they delay'd to proceed against him, until my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> was gone, and then they set him at li∣berty.</P>
<P>All the Court show'd this <HI>Ambassador</HI> singular Marks of Honour. The <HI>Daup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and all the great Lords of the Court, invited him to Dinner, while he for his part kept a very splendid Table. The Count of <HI>Auvergne</HI> youngest Son to the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> gave him the use of his Lodgings while he stay'd at <HI>Paris;</HI> and himself went in the mean time to <HI>Holland</HI> to
<PB N="243" REF="402"/>
his Wife's Estate, who died there about that time. This <HI>Ambassador</HI> had at his Entry a hun∣dred Livery-men, and six Coaches, three with eight Horses, and three with six; and continued the same Grandeur all the time he stay'd at Court. He always made his Visits with all that Atten∣dance, to let the World see how little he resem∣bled a great many of that Quality, who discharge three parts of their Equipage the next day after their Entry; so that he spent almost a hundred thousand Crowns in the two Months that his Em∣bassy lasted.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> pass'd his time very indifferently all that while. He heard from all hands the Ho∣nour done to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> which was such as perhaps was never shown before to any <HI>Am∣bassador.</HI> This made some People believe that there were some Alliances on foot betwixt the two Kings, and the more, because my Lord <HI>Port∣land</HI> had three or four Private Audiences of his <HI>Majesty.</HI> However, while some <HI>French</HI> People suspected, that they thought of dividing <HI>Flanders</HI> between them two, after the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whose Health was very infirm, it came to be known that these private Audiences were upon a very different Subject. My Lord <HI>Portland</HI> insisted upon the removing of King <HI>James</HI> at a farther distance from the King's Presence, promi∣sing in his Master's Name to give him and the <HI>Queen</HI> a Pension sufficient to excuse his <HI>Majesty</HI> from the Expence he had been at upon that Prince, since he had made a Sanctuary of his Dominions. But the King would never give ear to it, which ex∣ceeded King <HI>James</HI>'s Expectation, who, in case the <HI>King</HI> had abandon'd him, was resolv'd to retire to <HI>Avignion,</HI> for he began already to inform him∣self,
<PB N="244" REF="403"/>
if he could live conveniently there. For as the King was oblig'd in Policy to make Peace with his Enemy, though he had promis'd ne∣ver to make it, until he had restor'd him to his Crown, he was afraid that the same Policy might also induce him to grant what was de∣manded.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Malady increasing every Moment, insomuch, that it was generally thought he had few days to live, did not only move all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to delay the Reform of their Troops after the Peace, but likewise retarded the Evacuation of some Places, which his Majesty was oblig'd to Surrender. However, the Marquis of <HI>Harcourt</HI> receiv'd Orders to go with all di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣gence to the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> with this <HI>Instruction,</HI> that if he saw no probability, as in effect there was none, to bring the Succession of his Catho∣lick Majesty to fall upon one of the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Sons; he should endeavour, at least, to hinder its coming to any of his Imperial Majesty's Chil∣dren. For it was to the Emperor and his Descen∣dants, that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. the present King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Father had left it by his Will. And the <HI>Emper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> becoming already very powerful by his Conquests in <HI>Hungary,</HI> he was thereby become so suspected to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> that he was resolv'd to have re∣course to his Arms, rather than suffer it to fall into his Hands. And, accordingly, to fright the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he caus'd to file off Sixty thousand Men to the Frontiers of <HI>Italy, Catalonia,</HI> and <HI>Na∣varre.</HI> He was sensible that would add some weight to his Ambassador's Discourses, and might also awaken the Ambition of some Grandee of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="404"/>
The Marquiss was no sooner arriv'd in <HI>Spain</HI> than he apply'd himself to business. He told those, who were capable to act in concert with him in an Affair of such importance, that <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> IV. had gone beyond his Power, when he pretended to dispose of his Crown at pleasure, against the Laws of Nature. That it belong'd lawfully to his Daughter's Children, and not to his Relations in the fourth Degree, who could pretend to no Right of themselves. That the <HI>Dau∣phine</HI> had three Sons, and the Duke of <HI>Burgun∣dy</HI>'s second Brother was still as pliable as wax, whom they could Mould into any Form they pleas'd, and if they would fix their Eye upon him, they might easily breed him to their own Cu∣stoms; that if this fail'd, the Prince of <HI>Bavaria</HI> being Grand son to a Daughter of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King, his Master, would rather approve of his Election, than of the Emperor's, or of any of his Children, unless they had a mind to follow the Example of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who to oblige <HI>Strangers</HI> to agree among themselves, had twice chosen a So∣vereign of their own Country. And this was all the King pretended to, considering he could not expect to bring the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> into his own Family. But the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> having a watchful Eye upon the Conduct of this Ambassa∣dor, who made it his business to renverse her Designs, pry'd narrowly into his Intrigues, and remov'd the King, her Husband, some distance from <HI>Madrid,</HI> under pretence that the Air was prejudicial to his Health. She carried him to <HI>To∣ledo,</HI> and pretending it was only upon the account of his Health; would allow no body to follow him thither. Nay, she left some Ministers that she confided in at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in order to receive whatever any of the Ambassadors had a mind to
<PB N="246" REF="405"/>
offer. The Marquis <HI>de Harcourt</HI> saw clearly with what view the Queen made this Journey, and that she intended to be so fully Mistriss of the King, her Husband's Inclinations, that she could obtain of him whatever she had a mind to. He fear'd she might prevail with him to confirm <HI>Philip</HI> IV's Will; and at the same time observ'd, that the Count <HI>de H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrach</HI> was no more to be seen at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> and in all probability was gone to <HI>Toledo;</HI> upon this, he went immediately thither also, under pretence of having receiv'd a Memorial (which he forg'd) from the King his <HI>Master,</HI> with positive Orders to communicate it to his Catholick <HI>Ma∣jesty.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> who did not in the least expect it, was extreamly surpriz'd to see him there; and caus'd the King, her Husband, to whom he presented his <HI>Memorial,</HI> to acquaint him, That he had left the Cardinal of <HI>Corduba</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI> on purpose, to whom he might have communicated his Memo∣rials, as well as to him; that his principal Inten∣tion for coming thither, was to recover his Health, and not to trouble himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Business; and therefore he might apply himself to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> in all Affairs of <HI>State.</HI> However, considering that the Memorial was not very long, and that in all appearance it tended to his own advantage, he thought he was oblig'd to answer it himself. One thing to be consider'd, is, that the King of <HI>Morocco</HI> had for a long time besieg'd the Fortress of <HI>Ceuta</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> which belong'd to his Catholick <HI>Ma∣jesty,</HI> but could never take it. Nor was the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in circumstances to raise the Siege, though he had attempted it several times. In all appea∣rance these <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> did not carry it on very vigorously; whether they were ignorant how to
<PB N="247" REF="406"/>
carry it on, or that they thought the <HI>Conquest</HI> the more Glorious after a Siege of so many Years. His most Christian <HI>Majesty,</HI> by this Memorial, of∣fer'd to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> if he pleas'd, to send Men of War and Gallies to succour that place. His Catholick Majesty had enough of his own for such an Enterprize, without being oblig'd to bor∣row of any other Prince. But he was so treache∣rously serv'd by him, whom he had entrusted with his Orders, that instead of executing them, he deserted to the Enemies. Nay, he did much worse, for not being satisfied to Renounce his Master only, he renounc'd also <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which was esteem'd so great an encouragement for these <HI>Infidels,</HI> that, after that, they thought they had gain'd all. Such an accident, in effect, con∣founded all the Governors his <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> had upon that Coast; and this was the Subject, or ra∣ther the Pretence of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador's Me∣morial. But whether his Catholick Majesty had no mind to accept of such suspected Succours, or that he thought he could do without them, he thank'd the <HI>Ambassador</HI> for the proffer, observing with him, at the same time, all the measures of Civility, that were proper for the occasion. However, he who had renounc'd his <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Faith,</HI> beginning to be sensible of his fault, and to repent of it, confess'd that he was a <HI>Christian,</HI> and abhorr'd his <HI>Apostacy.</HI> But the <HI>Infidels,</HI> who had made a great deal of noise of his change, expecting to oblige him to return to them by the force of <HI>Presents</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> indeavour'd to regain him; but seeing him continue in his Re∣pentance, and that there was no possibility of bringing him over again to them, they threaten'd to treat him as they usually do <HI>Apostates</HI> from their <HI>Religion,</HI> I mean, they threaten'd to Empale
<PB N="248" REF="407"/>
him after torturing. But he expected no less, and was fully resolv'd to undergo all, being extream glad to expiate by these Torments, the heinous Crime he had committed against his <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>King.</HI> So being no ways frighten'd by their Me∣naces, he submitted himself very freely to all the Torments they could invent. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, in the mid∣dle of these dismal Torments, he joyfully confess'd him whom he had denied: upon which they put him at last to Death, least by his Constancy some amongst them might be mov'd to acknow∣ledge, that he suffer'd for a good Cause, in regard he seem'd so insensible of Pain in his Tor∣ments.</P>
<P>After this Answer, the Marquis of <HI>Harcourt</HI> was obliged to return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and endea∣vour'd by all means possible to gain the People by a very agreeable Conduct; his Wife, the <HI>Mar∣chioness,</HI> came also from <HI>France</HI> to second him. For having an infinite deal of Wit, she thought to infinuate her self by degrees into the Queen's Affection, and gain her Confidence by the means of some Proposals she believ'd would prove mightily to her Advantage, with regard to her Person. It was highly presumptuous in her to entertain that thought. To be sure, her <HI>Majesty</HI> would be much upon her guard against her; for besides her being the Wife of a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>narch,</HI> who is a capital Enemy to <HI>France,</HI> there was not the least appearance she would hearken to any thing that came from that <HI>Nation.</HI> The Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwithstanding her being a <HI>German,</HI> began to conform her self to a Court, where Trick and Policy are in Vogue as much as in any in the Universe, and therefore se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn'd presently to be exceedingly charm'd with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> to the
<PB N="249" REF="408"/>
end she might the more easily know her Secrets. The <HI>Marchioness</HI> told it to her Husband, meaning to perswade him to rejoyce at it with her: But the Ambassador, though he had always been a Man more inclin'd to the Sword than the Court, was yet cunning, and advis'd her always to suspect so excessive Civility. He told her, it was not natural for the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> to be so early in a good Correspondence with the Am∣bassador of <HI>France</HI>'s Lady, that it look'd like a Trick among those who knew better than to judge of things by appearance. And therefore all he re∣commended to her, was to be prudent, that she ought to hear the <HI>Queen</HI> speak, rather than speak her self, and by these means she would cer∣tainly advance her Affairs much better than by endeavouring to be the Head of the Conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>While these <HI>Intrigues</HI> proceeded after this manner, the Princess of <HI>Conti,</HI> the King's Daughter, had some thoughts of marrying Mademoiselle <HI>de Me∣lan,</HI> eldest Daughter to the Princess of <HI>Epinoi,</HI> to the Marquiss of <HI>La Valiere,</HI> her Cousin-German; she had a great Respect for her, and went very often to <HI>Paris</HI> to see her; and as for the Marquis, he was in very good terms with the <HI>Dauphine.</HI> She had it in her view, at the same time, to get him made <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Peer,</HI> by obtaining from the <HI>King</HI> the <HI>Title</HI> of his <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Vaujour</HI> to her self, in expectation of his succeeding to the Propriety of it after her Death. This Land pertain'd for a long time to the House of <HI>Bueil,</HI> and while it continu'd in that Family, had only the Title of Marquisate, but was erected into a Dutchy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of Madam <HI>de la Valiere,</HI> who since made her self a <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ess.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Colb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt,</HI> who had
<PB N="250" REF="409"/>
the Secret to get her into his Interest, while she was a Favourite, bought this Land for her, by which means he ingratiated himself both in the King's Favour and her's. It cost him only a hundred thousand Crowns, though there was as much Wood upon it as would answer that Mo∣ney, which he sold in a short time after the Purchase. However, Mademoiselle <HI>de Melan</HI> flat∣ter'd her self already with being a Dutchess very soon, which was somewhat better than the ima∣ginary Principality her Family flatter'd themselves with, when the Princess of <HI>Conti</HI> came to know that his <HI>Majesty</HI> had no Inclination for that Marriage. This made her shift sides, and seeing the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> was in great Favour with the King, she cast her Eyes upon one of his Daughters. There was a whole Regiment of them; and though there had been three of them already married, yet there remain'd still such a number of them, that he was the Per∣son in all the Court, the best provided with Means to make Sons-in-law; besides, they strove who should have them. For his <HI>Majesty</HI> had lately conferr'd a Favour upon him, that evinced sufficiently the Esteem he had for him. Madam <HI>de M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> had a Nicce, who was the only Daughter of the Count of <HI>Aubig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> her Brother, Governor of <HI>Berry,</HI> and <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s Order. This young Creature, who was very lovely in her Person, was much more such by the Favour and Merit of her <HI>Aunt,</HI> who took particular care of her Education. For she thought that her Father, who lov'd his Game and Pleasures, and by these means had ruin'd his Affairs, so that he was oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to retire, in order, either to pick up what might pay his Debts, or to learn that he must die. I say, she
<PB N="251" REF="410"/>
thought that her Father was in no Capacity to do any thing for her, and therefore by her care she made her a very well-accomplish'd young Lady, and this Quality, with all the others, which she possess'd in an eminent de∣gree, made her the desirable Object of all the <HI>Great Men</HI> of the Court, who had any Sons to Marry; but there were particularly two, who had a great design upon her, namely, the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> who would have given her the Prince of <HI>Marsillac,</HI> his Grand-Son; the other, the Duke of <HI>Noailles,</HI> who had his eldest Son, the Count of <HI>Ayen,</HI> to Marry. Either of these seem'd very advantageous for her, though the first appear'd to be much more such than the last. For in effect, though the House of <HI>Noailles</HI> be very good and ancient, yet the Family of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> exceeds it; at least in the Opinion of a great many, for all who pretend to know any thing of the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> make a great difference between them; besides, though the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> was Captain of the Life-Guards, a very considerable Post, the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> had two others, which were fully as considerable, and both of them carry great <HI>Titles,</HI> which distinguish them from many others; though in effect, that of <HI>Great Marshal</HI> of the Lodgings is small enough for its Grandeur. On the other hand, there are a great many larger Estates in his Family, than the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> can pretend to. The Estate of <HI>Noailles</HI> that lies just by <HI>Turenne,</HI> is nothing in comparison of <HI>Wertheux,</HI> and of <HI>Ro∣cheg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yon,</HI> that must, of necessity, fall one day to the Prince of <HI>Marsillac,</HI> without reckoning a great many other Lands, which the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Rocheguyon,</HI> his
<PB N="252" REF="411"/>
Father, have; so that every one believ'd, that the Prince of <HI>Marsillac</HI> would carry the young Lady, when the King declar'd himself in fa∣vour of the Count of <HI>Ayen.</HI> The King himself gave her a Portion; and not thinking it suffi∣cient to give her eight hundred thousand Livers, he also conferr'd so many Favours upon her Husband, that a great many <HI>Princes,</HI> and even <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI> would have been very glad to receive 'em. He gave him the Survivance of the Government of <HI>Roussillon,</HI> which the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> had; that of the Government of <HI>Berry,</HI> which the Count of <HI>Aubignie</HI> had; a hundred thousand Livres in Jewels to the young Lady; and in fine, a great many other things, that show'd no less the Magnificence of the <HI>King,</HI> than the particular Friendship he had for their Relations. And this demonstrated how much they were in the Right, who courted the Alli∣ance of the Duke of <HI>Noailles.</HI> But the King, as an additional Super-abounding Favour, gave the young Count his Shirt when he was ready to go to Bed, while the Duchess of <HI>Burgundy</HI> perform'd the same Office to the young Lady. One would have thought that there remain'd no∣thing to be done after so many Favours▪ But his Majesty, who is an inexhaustible Fountain of Goodness, gave each of them a Pension of eight thousand Livres a Years, and to compleat the Work, said, <HI>That provided the Count were a good Man, he might assure himself, he should never want for any thing.</HI></P>
<P>It being no mean thing to become a Brother-in-law to such a Gentleman as this, Madam, the Princess of <HI>Conti,</HI> manag'd the Match betwixt her Cosin and his Sister; she secur'd to her his
<PB N="253" REF="412"/>
Dutchy by the Contract of Marriage, and the Affair being thus concluded, the <HI>Dauphine</HI> con∣ceiv'd so great a Friendship for the new marri∣ed Gentleman, that he could go no where with∣out him. He had him always by his side in his Coach, as if they had but one Coach betwixt them both, and lean'd his Head always to his, as if he had been his Mistriss, and in a sporting way call'd him <HI>Violet,</HI> a Name that formerly was not much coveted, being only proper for Foot∣men, or that sort of Cattel, but now became very fashionable amongst the Courtiers. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> is naturally of a sweet Temper, and an Enemy to all manner of Constraint. He is not capable of having any great Inclination for Women; and though he may have lov'd one or two of them, knowing that the fair Sex requires complaisance, he did not regard them so much upon the account of their easi∣ness as of their Virtue. <HI>Dumont,</HI> one of his Masters of the Horse, who was much in his Favour, brought them always to him by Private Stairs when he wanted them, and sent them immediately back when he had done. This <HI>Prince</HI> chus'd them ordinarily amongst the Actresses of the Opera or Comedy, upon which there happen'd to him a very pleasant Rencounter, that deserves some place in this Work. Having caus'd <HI>Dumont</HI> to speak to one of the Actresses of the Opera, he agreed with her that she should come to <HI>Meudon,</HI> to the end he might introduce her to the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Closet by the private Stairs; they condescended upon the Day and Hour. The <HI>Actress,</HI> though a Person void of Ceremony, thought it not very decent to go thither alone, and so brought one of her Sisters along with her. The <HI>Dau∣phine</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="413"/>
had some Person with him in his Closet when they arriv'd, which oblig'd <HI>Dumont</HI> to tell them to wait in a place where he posted them near the Closet; at the same time he made it known to the <HI>Dauphine</HI> by a sign, that his fair Lady was come, to the end he might discharge his Company. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> order'd him to go some where or other, and in the mean time the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Company judg∣ing they where somewhat inconvenient to him, took there leave. <HI>Dumont</HI> having left the private Door half open, the Actress's Sister hearing no noise in the Room, had the Curiosity to look into it. The <HI>Dauphine,</HI> who only waited for <HI>Dumont</HI>'s return to have her Sister introduc'd, having his Eyes fixt, by chance, that way, where the other was looking, no sooner saw a Wo∣man's Coiffe at the Door, but taking her to be the Person he had a mind to, he desir'd her to come in. She thought it good manners to obey, though it was none of her he meant. But whether his Eyes were somewhat Dim that Day, or that he was in such haste, that he had no time to consider her aright, he gave her the same usage he design'd for her Sister. After which, having no further Inclination for the Lady's Conversation, he sent her away imme∣diately. She told her Sister nothing of this Ad∣venture. The Actress still waited for <HI>Dumont,</HI> and long'd much for his coming. In fine, he return'd by the Private Stairs, and told her he was a going to speak to the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> in order to bring her in. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> told him, <HI>The he had had all the Conversation with her he intended, and de∣sir'd him to give her five hundred</HI> Louis d'ores, <HI>and send her home. Dumont,</HI> who had seen her very impatient to enter, knew nothing of what he
<PB N="255" REF="414"/>
meant by that, and intreated the <HI>Dauphine</HI> to ex∣plain himself. In fine, he came to know what pass'd, but not knowing with whom, he went and told the <HI>Actress,</HI> that if her Appetite was so very good, it was not the same with the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s. She was extreamly surpriz'd at his Complement; but understood by it, that her Sister had deceiv'd her, and was so extreamly vext at it, that she would never be reconcil'd with her, till she condescended to divide the five hundred <HI>Louis d'ores</HI> with her, which the <HI>Dauphine</HI> had sent to her.</P>
<P>The furious War which the <HI>King</HI> had main∣tain'd against so many Potentates, had encou∣rag'd some of the new Converts to profess their former Religion, notwithstanding the Pro∣hibition to the contrary. His <HI>Majesty</HI> caus'd to take up a great many of them in the Neighbour∣hood of <HI>Orange,</HI> as they were returning thence from Sermon. Some of them were treated very severely, while others got off for a Month or two's Imprisonment. The <HI>King</HI> set also Guards upon all the Avenues of that Town, to hinder them from returning thither any more. But not being intirely satisfied with this Precaution, he made very strict Edicts against all such, who should dare, in prejudice of the Prohibition, to venture to go thither again. But this was not the only disobedience that appear'd in a short space of time, for not one of them went to Mass. And his Majesty being inform'd of it from all Parts, and finding it a matter that ought to be remedied, if he meant to prevent some danger∣ous Accidents, deliberated with his Council, how he ought to proceed against these obstinate Peo∣ple. They were all at a loss how to advise him
<PB N="256" REF="415"/>
upon that occasion, insomuch, that the Affair re∣mained undecided, and the King wrote to the most part of the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Intendants,</HI> to have their Judgment in writing: These differ'd in their Sentiments from one another. Some advis'd him to make use only of Exhortations, in order to make them Obedient; others were for a severe usage. Those, who were of this last Sentiment, were so much the more warm in it, because they imagin'd (though unjustly) that the King of <HI>England</HI> had us'd these means with regard to the Catholicks of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who not willing to submit to the present Government, were fain to look for a Sanctuary in <HI>France,</HI> to shelter themselves from the Punishment that was due to their Rebellion. These People of all Ages and Conditions, coming over in whole Troops to <HI>France,</HI> never fail'd to spread abroad, that they had been oblig'd to quit their Country in order to avoid the Vio∣lence that was done to their <HI>Consciences.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> gave them five hundred Pistols in <HI>Charity,</HI> which was thought but a small mite for so great a <HI>King.</HI> However he appointed some Ladies of the Court to raise an Offering for them amongst the Persons of <HI>Quality.</HI> The Curats of <HI>Paris</HI> fol∣low'd that Example, and caus'd also an Offer∣ing to be made in their Parishes to supply their Necessity. But their being a great many <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> amongst these Refugees, the <HI>Arch∣bishop</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> would have them to say their Masses in <HI>Nô<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Dame,</HI> by way of Preference to all the <HI>French Priests,</HI> who us'd to Celebrate 'em there. He did them also particular Acts of Cha∣rity, for being extraordinary Pious, he omit∣ted nothing that was in his Power for their Re∣lief.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="416"/>
In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Jersey,</HI> Brother in Law to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> was Named by the King of <HI>England,</HI> to succeed this last in <HI>France:</HI> The King had no mind to speak to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> of any thing that passed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> least he might thence take occasion to speak to him of the Protestants in <HI>France.</HI> He made him a present of his Picture, richly set with Diamonds, according to the ordinary Practice of this Court, with a regard to all Embassadours.</P>
<P>But there was this difference made betwixt him and others; that the Diamonds upon the Present made to him, were Three times more rich than they upon any others: The King probably meant, that his present should bear some proportion to the expences he had been at; or perhaps knowing he was in good terms with his Master, he was glad to have his favour upon occasion. Some few Days before his departure, the King made a review of his Hou∣shold; and King <HI>James</HI> was there, as was also this <HI>Lord,</HI> who perhaps had forborn coming, if he had known that the other was to be there. The <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI> came thither also, and had particular Or∣ders from the King his Father, to joyn Conversa∣tion with that <HI>Lord</HI>'s Son, to whom he had caused to insinuate before, that he never pretended to make him answerable for what his Master had done a∣gainst him. This young Prince being only a Child, was hardly capable of such an Entertainment, but he had placed such Persons about him, as were able to inform him, and even continue the Discourse if necessary: I do not know what he meant by it: However my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> knowing the young Princes design, sent to tell his Son to avoid him, and himself shun'd all those of King <HI>James</HI>'s Court. The review being over, he left <HI>France</HI> in a few Days after, leaving a great esteem for him amongst all the Courtiers. However before he went, he was to see all the King's Houses in the Neighbourhood
<PB N="258" REF="417"/>
of <HI>Paris,</HI> and found them of a far different magnifi∣cence from his Majesty's Houses in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> He went to <HI>Chantilly</HI> in his roade, whither the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde</HI> went a purpose to entertain him; and thus here turned home, extreamly satisfied with the Honour done him every where, and gave an Account to his Master of all that passed in his Em∣bassie. This Prince was not ill pleas'd, at the News of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s sickness; for it being upon that account that <HI>France</HI> continued still Arm'd, he likewise kept up his Troops, so as that the <HI>English</HI> could not find fault with it: He knew his <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Safety,</HI> consisted in the Number of his Troops; and having Enemies both within and without his Kingdom, there was nothing more capable to gain him respect, than to have always a good Army at his Command.</P>
<P>This Prince having made it to appear upon all occasions, that he had an infinite deal of Sense, was not in the least mistaken upon this occasion: For finding it his interest upon two Accounts, to keep <HI>France</HI> continually in Arms; both as it was a means to exhaust his Forces; and as it wou'd prove always a good pretence for him to keep up his own Army: He advis'd to have it ratified at the <HI>Dyet of Ratisbon,</HI> that the Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> should always keep up a Hundred and Twenty Thousand Men in Arms, in the time of Peace; for he was sensible, the more they had, the more <HI>France</HI> wou'd be obliged to have on that side. And there being but a small distance betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> he wou'd by those means be always upon his Guard. It was also believed, that in Po∣licy he asked of the King, to remove <HI>King James and his Wife</HI> at a distance from him, though he doubted the King would never consent to it. But it would be such a pretence for him to show the <HI>Parliament,</HI> that having a considerable Enemy so nigh him; prudence would oblige him to keep
<PB N="259" REF="418"/>
himself always in a condition to resist him in case of necessity.</P>
<P>But whether he meant to enlarge upon that, or that in effect, <HI>King James</HI> who had attempted se∣veral times to remount his <HI>Throne,</HI> by fomenting insurrections in <HI>England,</HI> began to attempt the same again, or whatever else was in it, he caus'd a great many Persons to be taken up; and a∣mong others the Earl of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> as if he had meant to raise new troubles. The Earl had been Captain of the Guards to <HI>King James,</HI> and had passed once more before into that Country, in Order to do him Service. But he had no such design at this time; He had only went thither under the benefit of the Peace, though the New King had excluded him from it, as he had done a great many others, who had continued after a cer∣tain time in the Service of his Enemy. However this Earl being a Person of quality; his Imprison∣ment made no little noise, for instead of sending him to the Tower, they put him up in Newgate. This was by no means disagreeable to the <HI>King,</HI> for the more the <HI>Prisoner</HI> was a Man of <HI>quality;</HI> the greater Impression his return into the Coun∣try, made upon the minds of the People, for they knew he was guilty the last time he came into the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> because he had made his Escape out of the Tower. For at that time he proposed to a <HI>Lady</HI> of quality, who came to see him, to allow him to make his escape under her Petticoats. This Lady being as large as he was little, con∣descended very willingly at the Peril of whatever could happen: For besides the apprehension she was under, of being catch'd in the Commission of a flaming Crime, and being kept Prisoner her self, she allowed his approaches to a place, with which the <HI>Ladies</HI> hardly suffer such near commu∣nication, at least without some scruple; what∣ever was in it he played his Game so well, that
<PB N="260" REF="419"/>
he made his escape without being discovered, and from that time kept always about King <HI>James,</HI> till the time of his being retaken, that I mentioned but now.</P>
<P>It was a long time before the <HI>English</HI> could be sen∣sible of any pretence their King had, to keep any Troops on Foot, in the present posture of the Af∣fairs of <HI>Europe</HI> in General, or of their own in Parti∣cular. On the other Hard, it was given out a pretty while before that His Christian <HI>Majesty</HI> was to have a Camp near <HI>Campiegne,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was to Command. And though it was said publickly, it was designed only to let him see something in warlike affairs, and to accustom him by degrees to such great things as were due to his Birth, yet it bred some Jealousie, so that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> continued still quiet. But the Natural restless∣ness of that <HI>Nation,</HI> never allows them to be long at ease: In fine, they complained that being exhausted by the War, it was impossible for them to continue the same expences in the time of Peace. The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> thinking to satisfie them in some degree, made a reform of some Regiments, and of o∣thers, he sent some into <HI>Holland,</HI> and some into <HI>Ireland,</HI> believing that these being once out of their sight, they would be apt to forget them; but they still insisted upon their former complaints. And to speak the truth, they had good politick Rea∣sons to do what they did, not only with regard to themselves, but also with regard to all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Encampment which the King intended, was put off to <HI>September,</HI> to the end that the People in the Neighbourhood, might have opportunity to make their Harvest, and gather in all their Corn; so in this interval of time, there fell out some remarkable things at Court. One of the most considerable, which per∣haps has no parallel in this Age, was as follows.
<PB N="261" REF="420"/>
<HI>Monsieur de Pelletier,</HI> who had been <HI>Controler Ge∣neral</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> and whom the King had made an <HI>Officer</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> quitted a Hundred Thou∣sand Livers a Year, which he possessed by the King's liberality, to be freed from all manner of business, and have time to mind his Salvation. His <HI>Majesty</HI> had a mind to allow him some Pension, and was so much the more earnest to do it, be∣cause he cou'd never sufficiently admire such a resolution; but after all his remonstrances, he on∣ly prevailed so far, as to oblige him to accept of Twenty Thousand Livers a Year, to maintain a Table for his Family. His place in the <HI>Post-house,</HI> which was valued at Two and Thirty Thousand Livers a Year, was given to <HI>Monsieur Pomponne:</HI> Who, however Pious he was thought to be, thought such a Post not inconsistent with his Devotion. <HI>Monsieur Pelletier</HI> retir'd immediately to his <HI>Castle</HI> of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lle Neuf,</HI> within Three or Four Leagues of <HI>Paris;</HI> and discarded the most part of his Domesticks. His Brother who was <HI>Intendant</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> being angry that he had not Named him to his Ma∣jesty for <HI>Comptrouler General</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> when he quited it, was exceedingly vexed, because he had not acquainted him with his Intention, in order to fall upon measures, to make some advantage of his spoil.</P>
<P>Moreover he went the next Day to <HI>Versailles,</HI> and told the King (without waiting in the least for what his Majesty had a mind to say upon the Sub∣ject,) that though it was generally said in the World, that the <HI>Younger</HI> ought to follow the exam∣ple of the <HI>Elder;</HI> yet he would take care not to imitate his Brother; that in effect he was so far from believing, that his <HI>Majestie's</HI> Service cou'd in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ast hurt his Salvation, that on the contrary there was nothing more useful either for this World, or the World to come: So that his Majesty might, when he thought fit, load him with more business, with∣out
<PB N="262" REF="421"/>
giving him the least disturbance; that he would always continue in his ordinary road, without ever thinking of shuting himself up, either in a <HI>Cloyster, or a Country House.</HI></P>
<P>He was easily believed without swearing, for every Body was sensible, how little inclination he had to quit the World. Besides, the World knew that he was not a Man, who troubled himself very much with business; he never lov'd to overcharge himself, for of whatever Consequence the Affair was, his Buildings and Garden were first look'd af∣ter: Not but that he had a great deal of Sense, and in that even exceeded his Eldest Brother; but be∣ing of their Judgment who believe, that <HI>Charitie begins as home,</HI> he never car'd to bely a Maxim, which <HI>time</HI> and <HI>custom</HI> had so well established in the World.</P>
<P>While both the Court and King admired <HI>Mon∣sieur Pelletiers</HI> Conduct: There fell out an accident betwixt two Courtiers at <HI>Marli,</HI> that had proved of a more troublesom consequence, if it had not been moderated by the <HI>Bystanders</HI> The matter was this, <HI>the Count of Auvergne</HI> was playing at <HI>Omber,</HI> with some other Lords, and <HI>Monsieur de Lausun</HI> looki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g over them, began to utter a great many silly expressions which vex'd the <HI>Count,</HI> insomuch that he threw down his Cards. The Gam∣sters asked him what he meant; the <HI>Count</HI> an∣swered, that it was impossible to play while he heard Monsieur <HI>Lausun</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edious Discourse, and as for him he could not have the complaisance to relish it. <HI>Monsieur Lausun</HI> being always sensible of the honour he had in marrying <HI>Henry</HI> IV. his Grandchild, and upon that Account respecting very little such digrities, which had no better Foundation, than the <HI>Count</HI>'s, was something mov'd at these words, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de him a harsh answer. The Gentlemen who were present, asked them what they meant
<PB N="263" REF="422"/>
by quarrelling in that Place, and being Friends to both Parties, presently put a stop to the Quarrel.</P>
<P>About the same time, Two more Considerable Per∣sons happened to quarrel; I mean the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> and the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome,</HI> Grand <HI>Prior</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> They were also playing at <HI>Omher,</HI> and the Grand <HI>Prior</HI> having call'd <HI>Gano,</HI> at the third Lift, and gain∣ing <HI>Codille;</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> told the Person who had made him <HI>Gano,</HI> that he was too simple to believe him, he being a Man that took his Advantage, where he could find it; and that he had never seen him play, after any other manner. The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> took notice of that Word, and said it was very re∣proachful, under a dubious sense. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> took no notice of what he had answered, whe∣ther he meant to shew himself somewhat wiser than the other, or that he thought the Terms he made use of, obliged him to make that Answer. But after the <HI>Game</HI> was ended, the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome</HI> went to <HI>Paris,</HI> and returned the next day to <HI>Versailles,</HI> with a long Rapier by his Side. The <HI>Courtiers</HI> ask'd one another, whom he had a Design upon, in carrying that Rapier. No body dreamt of what had passed the Night before, betwixt him and the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> and the rather, because there were hardly Two Per∣sons, less capable of counteracting the King's Orders. However, the <HI>Grand Prior</HI> having posted himself, where the Prince was to pass along, no sooner saw him, than he drew upon him, telling him, he must needs remember, what he had said the Night before, and as these things were not to be suffered, by Peo∣ple of their Circumstances, so he had a mind to see him with Sword in hand. The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> meant by these Words, to put himself in Competition with him, which displeased the Prince exceedingly, insomuch, that he told him, he had forgot himself, to speak to him after that manner. The Duke of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> was coming along in the mean time, and the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> calling him, told him that he was equally con∣cerned
<PB N="264" REF="423"/>
with him in the Affair, the Chevalier having said, that there was no difference, betwixt him and the Princes of the <HI>Blood,</HI> so he desired to know his O∣pinion of it, and if he thought fit to suffer it. The Duke acquainted the Dauphin with it, and the Dau∣phin immediately informed the King. Upon which his Majesty gave Orders to <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain,</HI> to send the <HI>Grand Prior</HI> to the <HI>Bastille</HI> The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> de∣sired to be admitted to the King, to acquaint him, with his Reasons, but his Majesty had no mind to hear him; and ordered his <HI>Ʋshers</HI> to shut the Cham∣ber Door against him, insomuch that this Prince, was at last obliged to obey, and went of his own ac∣cord to Prison.</P>
<P>At that time, there was no Governour of the <HI>Ba∣stille;</HI> for <HI>Mr. de Besma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x,</HI> who had been Governour Forty Years at least, was dead Six or Seven Months; and his Majesty had not yet nam'd any for that Go∣vernment: Not but that there were Persons enough who sollicited for it, for the vast Riches which the late Governour had made by it, was a sufficient Motive for a great many. The Governour of <HI>Pigner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> be∣ing at that time without Employ, that Place being given up by the Peace, sollicited earnestly for it. He had also a great many Competitors; for even the Duke of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine</HI> had a mind to it: For that Castle, being joined to the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> he would have been ve∣ry glad to unite the <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge</HI> of it, to that of Great <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Artillery,</HI> as it was in the time of the Duke of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liy.</HI> The <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Sanveri, Ʋnder Go∣vernour</HI> of the <HI>young Princes</HI> and the late <HI>Governour</HI> s Son in Law, had also an Eye upon it, but upon Con∣dition that he should not be obliged to reside there, and might have a fixt <HI>Sallary,</HI> as other Governments had. But this was quite contrary to his <HI>Father in law</HI> his Practice, who always thought the Advantage he made by the Prisoners, more preferable a Thousand times, than what the King had given other Gover∣nours. But whether his Son in Law considered that
<PB N="265" REF="424"/>
these Profits were much sunk by the Peace, or that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to keep also the Post he was in, he insisted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the same thing. The King had a great In∣clination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, but was desirous to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reside ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: So the Gentleman dropt his Pretensions, as soon as he knew his Majesty's Inten∣tion. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Captain of the Guards, put also in fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> without doubt had carried it, had it de∣pended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Prisoners to chuse a Governour for themselves. He was in effect, of a more generous Family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Gentleman who possessed it last; nor did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> degenerate from the Virtue of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, he was Nephew to <HI>Mr. de Pontchar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in sufficient Circumstances to relieve th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect, was very charitable, ever since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into the <HI>Ministry.</HI> This Mi∣nister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that it was very proper for his Ne∣phew, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho was very sickly, and upon that account ready to lay down his Charge, not being capable to serve the Two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Campaigns, and therefore he sup∣ported his Pretentions. But <HI>Mr. Barbesieux,</HI> propo∣sed to the <HI>King, Mr. de Cinqmars,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Islands</HI> of St. <HI>Honorat</HI> and St. <HI>Marguerite,</HI> and his <HI>Majesty</HI> seeming to have some inclination for him, desired <HI>Barbesieux</HI> to write to him, that he might have that Government instead of his own, if he inclined to change.</P>
<P><HI>St. Mars</HI> was very old, and having passed his younger Days, in the Service of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> he had made a prodigious Fortune; for he was cho∣sen by the King, to guard Mr. <HI>Fonq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et</HI> and <HI>Mr. Lan∣sun;</HI> so that by these means, he was become extream∣ly rich, and besides he was far from being covetous, as <HI>Mr. Besmaux</HI> was: Upon that account, he return'd an∣swer to the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Barbesieux,</HI> that he had no In∣clination to change, if his Majesty pleased to conti∣nue him where he was. But this <HI>Minister</HI> being very desirous to have that Government in the Hands of a Person devoted to his Family, as Mr. <HI>St. Mars</HI> ought
<PB N="266" REF="425"/>
to be, because he was obliged to his Father for his Fortune, had no mind to be satisfied with this Answer, but wrote again to him upon the same Subject, setting forth that he neglected his own good Fortune; and besides, might have the Advantage to be near his Family, which he ought to regard as a singular Hap∣piness, having been absent from it for many Years. Mr. <HI>St. Mars</HI> was born in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Paris,</HI> moreover, he was married to Madam <HI>Frenoy</HI>'s Sister, which had contributed above all to his Establishment. This was therefore the way to attack him, upon his weak side. However it be, he took this Letter to be a kind of Command; and therefore made Answer, that he would obey it. As soon as <HI>Mr. Saumery</HI> knew this, he ask'd that Government of the King, which his Majesty granted to him; but in a few days after, he broke a Company that had been raised on purpose, for Mr. <HI>Cinqmars,</HI> when he guarded Mr. <HI>Fouquet;</HI> and which he had ever since along with him in the <HI>Islands</HI> of St. <HI>Honorat</HI> and St. <HI>Marguerite.</HI> The Cap∣tain had a Sallary of Two Thousand Crowns, besides his Profits; so that Mr. <HI>Saumery</HI> lost all on a sudden, the half of the Gratification he thought to receive. In the mean time the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome</HI> was come to the <HI>Bastille,</HI> whither very few Lords went to see him, for fear of displeasing his Majesty, who had so resented his Conduct. Some were also unwilling to go, fearing the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Displeasure, and in effect, the Prince checked Mr. <HI>d' Alegre,</HI> for having gone thither. Mr. <HI>d' Alegre</HI> answered, that he did not believe that his Highnes would have took it ill, but since he knew his mind, he would for the future avoid displeasing him. The Prince accepted of his Excuse, and the Marshals of <HI>Catinat</HI> and <HI>Tourville,</HI> having also gone thither, they thought to make the same Apology, but the Prince saying nothing to them, it passed over in silence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Vendome</HI> was at <HI>Anet,</HI> when his Bro∣ther was commanded to Prison, but as soon as he
<PB N="267" REF="426"/>
heard it, he took Post to be inform'd by him of the Af∣fair, and after he had learn'd it, he thought the best way to obtain his Freedom was, by the Interest of the same Person, who had got him confin'd: he there∣fore went immediately to wait upon the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to that purpose. And this being all the Satisfa∣ction the Prince demanded, he went himself to the <HI>King,</HI> to ask the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>'s Liberty. The King made him answer, that if he was satisfied, yet him∣self was not; so that Eight or Ten Days were gone, before his Majesty would pardon that Prince. At last, his Majesty was prevailed upon, by the Solici∣tations of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ven∣dome.</HI> The Duke himself carried the Order for his Liberty, and brought him along with him to a cer∣tain Place, where Four or Five Persons were drunk, in solemnizing their Joy for the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>'s Liberty.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Marquis</HI> and <HI>Marchionesse</HI> of <HI>Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hevreuil,</HI> sent also one of their Sons into that Prison, not because he intended to fight, like the <HI>Grand Prior,</HI> but rather upon the account of a Re∣port was spread abroad of his being married at <HI>Ro∣chelle,</HI> whither they had sent to apprehend him. They resolved to send him to the <HI>American</HI> Islands, in or∣der to make him forget his Amours. The King was preparing a Fleet to be sent into these Countries: and <HI>de Gennes</HI> Captain of a Man of War, a man very well known amongst the Sea Officers, was to com∣mand it. It was thought, the <HI>Court</HI> designed to seize an Island in those Parts, the Inhabitants of which had driven the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the greatest Part of it, insomuch that they were forced to retire to a small Corner of it. It was thither that the Father and Mo∣ther intended to send their Son, in order to do Pen∣nance for his too warm Amours, as if Love had been a Capital Crime. But this Fleet giving some Occa∣sion of Jealousie to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> his Ma∣jesty was fain to desist; though it was already pret∣ty well advanced. And that excused the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>valier
<PB N="268" REF="427"/>
of <HI>Moutcheuruil</HI> from the Voyage, who was made Lieu∣tenant of a Ship, and doubtless had quickly been made Captain, if his Prudence had been equal to his Cou∣rage. But he made a very insolent Answer to <HI>Mon∣sieur de Maurepas,</HI> when he ask'd him concerning some things he was accus'd of having taken out of one of the Ships, which the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Nesmond,</HI> had taken. So that his Relations did not judge it convenient to continue him any longer in the <HI>Sea Service,</HI> for ha∣ving once failed in his Respect to Mr. <HI>de Maurepas,</HI> there was no Probability, that he would ever pardon him.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> after the Marriage of the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Ayen,</HI> had not only reformed his Table and Reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue, that were both very magnificent, but under some special Pretext, retired to <HI>Liancourt,</HI> a Place belonging to one of his Sons, at Ten or Twelve Leagues distance from <HI>Paris.</HI> However having staid 6weeks there, he return'd to Court. The King suspected that he was somewhat out of humour at the Match. He had Experience enough to know, that his Favours conferred to the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udice of another, gave as much Jealousie, as a Mistriss's Favour to the Prejudice of a Rival, yet he took no notice of it to him, but he lo∣ved his Person, and received him as affectionately, as he had used to do. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Lerraine</HI> sent <HI>Monsieur de Couvonges</HI> to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to demand in his Name, <HI>Mademoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elle</HI> in Marriage. The King expected always, both before the Peace, and since it was made, that this Princess, should have no other Husband but the King of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Nor was there any Princess in <HI>Europe,</HI> had more Preten∣tions to that Happiness, than She. But the Empress had so very little Inclination for <HI>France,</HI> that tho' <HI>Madamoiselle</HI> had been the King's own Daughter, instead of being the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s, she would have preferred the meanest <HI>Princess</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> to her. But the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Mother, when she perceived the Design of the <HI>French,</HI> was
<PB N="269" REF="428"/>
extreamly vexed at it, in regard of her Son's Interest. For being a Princess of extraordinary wit, she knew that the situation of that young <HI>Prince's</HI> Estate would oblige him to prefer an Alli∣ance with <HI>France</HI> to any other, and therefore she thought of making <HI>Mademoiselle</HI> her Daughter in <HI>Law.</HI> However she was willing to have the Empe∣rour's consent to it, who insinuated often to her that he would gladly bestow the <HI>Archduchesse</HI> his eldest Daughter upon the <HI>Duke;</HI> but the Emperour was prevail'd upon by her Reasons; and the <HI>King</HI> accep∣ted of <HI>Monsieur de Couvonges's</HI> offer in the Name of his Master, having named <HI>Mr. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntchartrain</HI> and some other considerable Persons of his Council todraw up the Articles of Marriage; which both Parties soon agreed upon. However there arose a difficulty that retarded the Affair for some time, for the <HI>Duke of Orleans</HI> had no other male Children, than the <HI>Duke of Chartres,</HI> and that Duke had only Daugh∣ters: This they had not foreseen in the beginning, but the <HI>Court</HI> thought fit to find some expedient for it, before they wou'd proceed any further. The difficulty consisted mainly in this point; that if the <HI>Duke of Chartres</HI> came to die without Male Issue, then <HI>Mademoiselle</HI> might have right to divide the succession of the <HI>Dutchess</HI> her Mother, with her Brothers Daughters. Moreover, that succession was very considerable; for besides ready Mony, Plate and Jewels, and a vast quantity of Furniture, which she had already inherited by the Death of her Bro∣ther, the <HI>Elector Palatin,</HI> they had also adjudg'd to her Two Hundred Thousand Livers of Rent, until they had regulated the share she ought to have in the Succession of that <HI>Elector.</HI> But they would have <HI>Mademoiselle</HI> renounce her Succession, in case her Brother came to die without Male Issue; which <HI>Monsieur de Couvonges</HI> had no mind to do without ex∣press Orders. The <HI>Duke of Lorraine's Council</HI> found that Clause too severe. However this Prince being
<PB N="270" REF="429"/>
still very young, and of a very exemplary piety, in which he resembled his Mother very much, who died soon after the Marriage had been resolved upon; he thought that upon all Accounts it was his advan∣tage (as indeed it was) to have a <HI>Princess</HI> of <HI>France</HI> for a Wife, and therefore Sacrificed all other consi∣derations to that policy; and consented to renounce all he could pretend to by the Dutchesses Suc∣cession, in case the <HI>Duke of Chartres</HI> dyed without Heirs, upon condition of having Four Hundred Thousand Livers pay'd to him.</P>
<P>In this manner the marriage of the <HI>Duke</HI> with <HI>Ma∣demoiselle</HI> was agreed upon, and they delay'd only the final conclusion of it, till the end of the Camp, that was to be made in Honour of the <HI>Duke of Bur∣gundy.</HI> They brought thither a great many more Troops, than they had at first thought upon, which created some mistrust in the Neighbouring <HI>Potentates:</HI> They were sensible, that the King had filed off a great many Troops to the Frontiers of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor were they ignorant of what was commonly repor∣ted of his <HI>Catholick Majestie</HI>'s health, and therefore were affraid that this Camp and all these Troops were designed to make a sudden irruption into his Territories, if by chance he came to die, which in effect appeared very probable by all the accounts we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad of him. However the King had at last evacu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted all the places he was to give up by the <HI>Yreaty</HI> of <HI>Ryswick:</HI> And as it must needs take up a great deal of time to retake them; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and their <HI>Allies</HI> had always this comfort, that they could dispute every Inch of Ground, if they came to be attack'd. The <HI>King</HI> named <HI>Mareshal de Bou∣fflers,</HI> to command this Camp under the <HI>Duke of Burgund.</HI> And as the King was very sensible, that he was a Person very apt to ruin himself, in order to maintain the Dignity which the King confer'd upon him, as preferable to all others; his Majesty made him a present of Fifty Thousand Crowns, before he
<PB N="271" REF="430"/>
marched, though the Camp was to continue only Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks, so that this Sum appeared pretty rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onable for so short a time: But this <HI>Mareshal,</HI> who affected always to be expensive, and even in his first employments, would fain appear some∣what like <HI>Turenne,</HI> in regarding nothing but his Glory, and having no manner of value for Mony, made such a prodigious expence in that <HI>Camp,</HI> that twice so large a Sum hardly excused him. He had Five Tables Morning and Evening, all equally served; the most rare and nice things in the King∣dom were there in abundance, nor was there ever seen better or more delicate Chear. He had above a Hundred head Cooks, besides those who serv'd under them, and those who wrought in the Morn∣ing, took their Rest in the Afternoon; he had an infinite Number of Carriages in the Field, to bring his Provisions: He had two Carriages for Ice on∣ly, which was brought from <HI>Paris</HI> every Day, and had fresh Horses laid always half way for them, because it was impossible for the same Horses to bring it all the way, without bursting, and all his other Carriages he had in the Field, were served after the same manner; He had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourveyors not only at <HI>Paris,</HI> but also in all the great Towns with∣in Twenty, or Five and Twenty Leagues of the Camp, every Table had two Stewar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and the chief Overseer of his Officers, was a Person who had served formerly the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Paris;</HI> for he was perhaps the only Man in the Nation, who un∣derstood these Affairs best, being always obeyed at first Word, so that all was done with such an extra∣ordinary sumptuous splendour, that it is impossible to describe it right.</P>
<P>This Camp ruin'd the Officers intirely, who had suffered extreamly before, by the expences they were oblieged to be at, during the War. However, not one of them minded any thing, but how to
<PB N="272" REF="431"/>
please the King, neither more nor less, than if he had been a Deity; there was never any thing to be seen so splendid and magnificent, as all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Offi∣cers, from the highest to the lowest. All the Troops and Foot Souldiers were new Cloathed, and that cost some Regiments above Five and Twenty Thousand Crowns. But while they impoverished themselves, <HI>Paris</HI> was enrich'd by it, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Twenty Days before the Camp was form'd, there was nothing to be seen at the Merchants Doors, but large Bales, which were carried away every moment. It is altogether impossible to tell how much Provisions were carried from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to that Camp, and in all probability it had been sufficient to have starved the City, if the Merchants had not been very provident before Hand; and as Strangers are always curious, there was not hardly one of them who went not to see the Camp, oppor∣tunities of that Nature falling out but very sel∣dom; so that prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly speaking, it was only one continued <HI>Procession</HI> from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Compiegne,</HI> where it was impossible to find Lodging for Mony, and all <HI>Inn-keepers</HI> were expresly forbid to receive any body, whether they meant to save their Lodgings for the People of the Court, or that they had no mind to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Town with a number of unknown People, and by that means prevent all dangerous accidents. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Camp was to continue, being quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the King returned to <HI>Versailles</HI> with all the Court, having first bestowed considerable Largesses upon all the Troops. The great Magnifi∣cence that appeared here, undeceived the Stran∣gers of the Opinion, they had brought with them from their own Country; to wit, that <HI>France</HI> had been exhausted both of Men and Mony. They had already seen the contrary at the <HI>Duke of Burgun∣dy</HI>'s Marriage, by the great confluence of People they found at <HI>Paris.</HI> But what they had seen upon this occasion, having quite disabused them, they
<PB N="273" REF="432"/>
began to look upon the King as another <HI>Croesus,</HI> whose Riches were inexhaustible.</P>
<P>But, if this Prince was so Rich, as there was no reason to doubt of it, his People were in extream Poverty, insomuch, that they wanted a great many things to supply their Necessities. But as soon as the King had made the Peace, he thought of contributing to their ease. He made divers Edicts in favour of the Country People, whose Lands were altogether waste for want of means to cultivate 'em. He also provided, by an Act of Council, that there shou'd be no order to sell the Lands of those who carried Arms the pre∣ceeding Years. He allow'd them some time for the payment of their Debts: But all this being only Paper, 'twas impossible for any body to re∣lieve their Necessity without Money. And a great many People thought, that it had been of far greater advantage to the Kingdom, if His Majesty, instead of spending his Money so lavishly upon that Camp, had delt it amongst his People, in order to buy them Cattle: All the Country was quite out of Cattel, and by lending the People some Money, whereby they might furnish them∣selves with some, he had restor'd a great many to Life, who were ready to Perish upon the want they had suffer'd for a long time. Not but that the King had reliev'd his People in some manner, in taking off the Capitation. He had also sunk a great many other Taxes which were rais'd during the War. But the Subsidies were agumented by a third; besides, the Corn that had continued dear for a long time, became daily dearer, which oc∣casioned new Desolation in a great many Families. And the poor Gentry was most of all to be pitied, especially those who had Children; for after the Peace they knew not how to bestow them because by the reform which was made of the Troops, they sent home all the Lieutenants as useless Mem∣bers.
<PB N="274" REF="433"/>
Nor did they continue the Pay of a reform to any, but to Captains and Lieutenants, who had serv'd at least Ten Years; insomuch, that those, who serv'd under that Time, were in the most deplorable Condition imaginable.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Dangeau,</HI> great Master of the Order of St. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> made, at that time, an E∣stablishment, that evinc'd sufficiently how much Good he would have done, if it had been in his Power. He had establish'd <HI>Companies</HI> of <HI>Cadets,</HI> that had been very useful for poor Gentlemen, as well as for those they received amongst them: For tho' these <HI>Companies</HI> had been instituted, in all appearance, only in consideration of them, yet, of late, they have received all sorts of People, even such p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons as cou'd have no other Communica∣tion with them, but with regard to the Liveries they had carried formerly. In effect, you might have seen Foot-Boys amongst them, and many o∣thers, who were so far from being the Children of Fathers who liv'd Nobly, who only ought to be admitted there, that they were only of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>um of the People: But it was not with regard to that alone, that Affairs took another turn some while ago in the Kingdom. The World was asto∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the same <HI>Nobility,</HI> who were for∣merly reputed the support of the <HI>State,</HI> was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o so great Contempt under the Ministry of the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quis of <HI>Louvois,</HI> that very odious Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted up against them. They were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the greatest indignity imaginable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, forsooth, that one Man who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Nobility of <HI>Anjou</HI> (tho' he was rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> up his Liquor than to command them) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> himself to be surprized. And thus made them answerable for his Fault, insomuch, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there was nothing to be seen but Libels post∣ed up in every Corner against them, as if the Ig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of one Commander was sufficent to
<PB N="275" REF="434"/>
make as many Criminals as there were Gentle∣men; and ever since they were oblig'd to mix-themselves amongst the Burgesses to go upon the <HI>Arier Ban:</HI> And, besides serving upon their own Expences, according to the ordinary Custom, they had the additional mortification to serve amongst a <HI>Scum</HI> that was unworthy to have any room in their Company. However, the Marquis of <HI>Dan∣geau</HI> who had not always been very rich, and con∣sequently knew what satisfaction 'twas for a Man of Quality, who was not in circumstances to edu∣cate his Children according to their ranks, to have them otherwise provided for, resolv'd to establish a fond out of a certain share of the Revenues of the Grand-Mastership, for the Education of some Children of Quality. He propos'd the Thing to the King, and His Majesty left the disposal of it to his own choice; upon which, he took eight Children out of the principal Families of the King∣dom, <HI>viz.</HI> of the House of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> of the House of <HI>Crequi,</HI> of the House of <HI>Ailly,</HI> of <HI>Maille,</HI> &amp;c. He hir'd a House for them near <HI>Charonne,</HI> and gave them Masters of all sorts with Boys to serve them. The Abbot of <HI>Dangeau,</HI> his Brother, being willing to contribute to so excellent an Institution, took upon himself the charge of overseeing them. There was non more capable of the Employ, he being very learned; and it was long of himself that the King had not conferr'd a <HI>Bishoprick,</HI> and considerable Abbeys upon him; but His Majesty knowing he lov'd his pleasure too much, he thought it sufficient to secure him from Starv∣ing.</P>
<P>About that time the Duke of <HI>Chaulnes</HI> fell Sick, and languish'd some time before he Died. He possess'd a great many considerable Employments both within and without the Kingdom; and by these means, made himself both Friends and E∣nemies.
<PB N="276" REF="435"/>
A certain Gentleman who had always appear∣ed to be of the number of the last, thought it now his Duty to endeavour a reconciliation with him before he expir'd. I mean the Cardinal <HI>D'Estrees,</HI> who was at <HI>Rome</HI> while the Duke was <HI>Ambassador Extraordinary,</HI> at that Court, from the King. The Cardinal was reputed a Man of Parts, and, upon that account, was ambitious to have the pre∣ference over all, which was the cause of their dif∣ference. But the Respect shown to the Duke, at the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> gave him some Ombrage: So that their misunderstanding was no secret any any where; and no consideration oblig'd the Car∣dinal to observe any measures in it. However, whether he thought himself in the wrong, or that he had a mind to appear a good Christian, he came at that time to ask his Pardon. The Duke was extreamly surpriz'd when they told him the Cardinal was come to wait on him; it was no more seasonable for him to think upon any Re∣sentment, tho', perhaps, he had been very capable of it at another time; therefore he desir'd he might come in, and there they were reconcil'd to one another. In a few days after the Duke Died, and left the Chancellor his Testamentary Executor. The D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceas'd had Married the Widow of the Marquis of St. <HI>Maigrin,</HI> Lieutenant of the Light-Horse. They had been Married a long time with∣out having any Issue; so that in order to make his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urt the better to Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> when he Married his Eldest Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Che∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> his Cousin <HI>German,</HI> he instituted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shou'd be begotten of that Marriage, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Her. He only reserv'd for himself the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred thousand Livers, of which he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t twenty thousand Crowns to the Chan∣cell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and the rest to some of his Domesticks. At the time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Death he was Governor of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> He had formerly been Governor of <HI>Brit∣tany;</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="436"/>
But this last government was thought very proper for the Count of <HI>Thoulouse,</HI> the King's Na∣tural Son; therefore His Majesty got him to resign it in his favour; and the King gave him <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Guyenne</HI> in exchange.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Guyenne</HI> was not long va∣cant after his Death, which fell out very conve∣niently for the Duke of <HI>Chartres,</HI> to whom the King had promis'd it, when that Duke Married the Count of <HI>Thoulouse</HI>'s Sister. The King had given the survivance of it to the Duke of <HI>Chevre∣use;</HI> but that Duke had already a hundred Thou∣sand Livers in Rent; and, besides, the Duke of <HI>Chaulnes</HI> his Lands produc'd no less; so, that all of a sudden two hundred Thousand Livers a Year fell into the Family. So that he was already be∣come so Rich, that <HI>that</HI> Government wou'd prove rather superfluous than useful to him. But Quietist as he was, he lov'd Riches nothing the less. However, I believe, they did wrong him in Re∣puting him a Sect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian. At last he made so much Interest to have the Survivance of that Government, that it was easie to perceive <HI>Molinos</HI>'s suspected Disciples are not indifferent of Matters. Yet, be how it will, the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> was no∣thing like him: He suffer'd his Exile very peace∣ably; and, without making the least noise, bore the Imprisonment of his good Friend Madam <HI>Guy∣on.</HI> She was brought from the Convent about <HI>Easter</HI> time, in order to be sent to the <HI>Bastille,</HI> where she was left for four or five Months to ex∣amine her Conscience, and then she was interrogat∣ed, tho' 'tis impossible to know upon what; for that sort of things are always very secret: But, according to what one can judge, it was upon some things contain'd in a Book Publish'd by the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> against the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI> in which she was made mention of. That Book contain'd very extraodinary matters against
<PB N="278" REF="437"/>
her. It charg'd her with a great many Revela∣tions and Miracles; in a word, it endeavour'd, by rendring her ridiculous, to make the Blow fall up∣on the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> her good Friend. However, the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI> his principal Ad∣versary, could not obtain his being declar'd a <HI>He∣retick,</HI> pursuant to his Allegations. The Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose business 'tis to give Sentence upon that Head, was very reserv'd upon the Point; whether it was that they saw no occasion for such a Declaration, or that by drilling on the Affair, they thought to appear more mysterious. The Court espous'd the Bishop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Interest very much; and after having remov'd the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI>'s Presence, did likewise remove his Nephew, that Prince's Sub-preceptor, together with some other Persons who were suspected of adhering to his Sentiments. Two of his waiting Gentlemen were among the number of those who were disgraced, tho' the occasion of it might seem foreign enough to their Profession. In fine, to cut off all hopes of ever returning to be about his Person, others were put in their places, who, perhaps, are no better Men than they: For we must know, that those who were remov'd, were Persons of exemplary Piety; insomuch, that all the Kingdom over there were none to be found that liv'd a more Christian Life. However, their Enemies employ'd all their art to ruin them, whether it was that they really thought them tainted with that Doctrine, or that they only cover'd their private views with that Pretence: So it was; that new Faces started up all of a sudden about the Young Prince. This was not at all agreeable to the Prince, at least it seem∣ed so. The Bishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who wrote from time to time to the Pope, according as the divers Charges were laid against him, having, at that time, sent His Holiness a Letter which was mightily cried up; the young Prince declar'd open∣ly,
<PB N="279" REF="438"/>
that he would be glad to see it. But, besides that there were but very few Copies of it to be seen in the Kingdom, grievous Punishments being in∣flicted upon those who dispersed them, no-body durst offer to satisfie his Desire for fear of dis∣pleasing the King. From thence the A. B. of <HI>Cam∣bray</HI>'s Friends took occasion to censure his Enemies. They Publish'd that it was always allowable for any Man to make his Defences, and their of∣fering in this manner to hinder them, spoke their unjustice. The vulgar People, who commonly take upon them to decide every thing, tho' without form∣ing any Judgment of the Affair, presently applauded these Complaints, without considering that in Religi∣ous Matters, there are some things better conceal'd than known, that Heresies are sooner propagated by Reading than by Conversation; so that all Writings tho' never so little suspected, cannot be too cautiously prohibited. But notwithstanding all the prohibitions against the bringing in of these Letters, two Bags were brought, not only into the Kingdom, but even into the Gates of <HI>Paris.</HI> Mon∣sieur <HI>D'Argenson</HI> smelt the Matter, and under∣stood that they were brought into Town in Coa∣ches: And, in effect, two Hackney-Coaches were sent to take them up at the Houses where they were Lodg'd, without knowing what they were. But before they enter'd the Town, care was taken to examin them; and as soon as Monsieur <HI>D'Ar∣genson</HI> found what they were, he Burnt them one after another in his Closet. But, after all, such was the Curiosity of some, That, tho' every one detested Quietism, as it was represented by the Bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Enemies; yet, all that cou'd escape that Marshal's View, were sold at four <HI>Louis d'Ors</HI> the Piece.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>D'Estrees,</HI> Governor of the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> follow'd Monsieur <HI>D'Chaulnes</HI> very speedi∣ly, tho' there was a great deal of difference be∣tween their Ages; the one being but fifty Years
<PB N="280" REF="439"/>
Old, and the other Seventy. The D. of <HI>D' Estrees</HI> Died after being cut of the Stone; and the fault was not so much laid upon the Chirurgeon, as upon an Accident that he cou'd not fore-see. He had de∣lay'd the performing of the Operation till the great heat was over: But the heat returning un∣expectedly with much Thunder, his Wound, which had formerly been in a good Condition, gave over Suppurating, and so he tip'd off in a minute. He left the Affairs of his Family in great Disorder. His Son had Married, for his first Wife, the Daughter of Monsieur <HI>de Lionne,</HI> Secretary of State, by whom he had a Son, and some Daugh∣ters; and for his second, a Daughter of the Mar∣quis <HI>de Vaubrun,</HI> Lieutenant of the King's Armies. This last did not know where to recover her <HI>Dow∣ry,</HI> and, by consequence, had been at a loss where to secure her <HI>Joynture,</HI> if the Bishop of <HI>Laon</HI> her Husband's Brother, had not engag'd in the Con∣tract of Marriage, for two hundred thousand Li∣vers to the Children that he shou'd have by her. The King, to whom the Duke had recommended his Family before he was cut, gave his Govern∣ment to his Eldest Son; the other depended sole∣ly upon his Succession to his Mother, who cou'd not but be very Rich, tho she had lost something by her Husband: For her Mother was still alive as well as her Mother's Father, who was worth two Millions of Money. Now, he having only two Heiresses, namely, the Marchioness of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣levrier</HI> and her self; the half of it was one day to be he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. It is true, the Dutchess had a Brother, who pursuant to the preference of Males, was intitled to the better half of the Succession; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e being set apart for the Church, by reason of his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cripitness and being already possess'd of Benefices, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> reckon'd that he ought never to Marry. And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there was no great appear∣ance or it, tho' we every day meet with things more extraordinary than that. But the Thing that
<PB N="281" REF="440"/>
troubled her most was, That he lov'd Mony; so that tho he did not Marry, it was to be fear'd he might not grant her his share of his Grandfather's Estate. He had but lately given a signal instance of his Love for Money, by maintaining a Law-Suit for a small Living, that he had procur'd from him, whose natural right it was to grant it. The Dean of <HI>Nants</HI> possess'd it formerly; and he having resign'd it to one of his Friends, Abbot <HI>Vaubrun</HI> pretended, that his Resignation cou'd not be vali'd; for that he had not liv'd upon it a competent space of time, for being admitted in the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI> However, the contrary seem'd to appear, by the Will of the Deceased; but he af∣firm'd that to be a Fraud, and said, that the Cura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was Cheated. In the mean time he had a Permission to raise monitory Letters, in order to find a Discovery by those that had assisted to keep the Body a long time after his Death, that they might favour his Party. However, fearing lest those who were concern'd might be pretty nimble, he obtain'd a Decree in Justice, that the Body should be uninterr'd, pretending, that by viewing it, it were easie to discover the Cheat. The Judges granted him his Demand, and so the poor Body was pull'd out of the Coffin half Rotten: In fine, tho' it cast a very nauseous Smell, so that it was impossible to approach it by a hundred paces, yet he caus'd it to be view'd by the Physicians and Chirurgeons, in order to have their Opinion of it. He put 'em upon an odd sort of Business; but think∣ing they were very well accustom'd to these sort of Perfumes, he did not regard it so much. The Physicians and Chirurgeons turn'd over and over the Dead Body, and having given a doubtful ac∣count of it, it was inter'd again in a more stinking Condition than it had been when it was taken up. The Abbot <HI>Vaubrun,</HI> seeing, that by their Judg∣ment he was like to be Cast, and condemned to pay the Charges, obtain'd another Judgment that
<PB N="282" REF="441"/>
the same Body might be view'd by other more skilful Persons: And thus it was taken up a se∣cond time; and these skilful Gentlemen having been more favourable to him than the former, he, in the end, gain'd the Suit.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Abbot of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> coming to die, the Abbot <HI>Verthuel</HI> his Brother, ask'd two good Abbies which he had possessed; but His Majesty refus'd him. However, having al∣ways a great esteem for the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> Brother to the two Abbots, though he had ab∣sented from coming to Court for six Weeks af∣ter the Count of <HI>Ayen</HI>'s Marriage, he conde∣scended to give him a Reason for that refusal; because, as His Majesty alledg'd, He had not found the Abbot <HI>Vertheuel</HI>'s Conduct regular enough to oblige him to bestow upon him Goods of the Church, which, perhaps, he might employ to an other use than they were design'd for. His Ma∣jesty added, that to shew that he was very wil∣ling to oblige him, when it did not interfere with his Conscience, he restor'd the Abbies possessed by the Deceased, upon the Old Abbot <HI>de la Rochefou∣caut,</HI> his Uncle. The Old Abbot dream'd nothing of such a Wind-fall. He had retir'd into his own Country a long while before, without thinking of ever returning to Court: But Fortune pursuing him as far as his Retreat, his only care then was to return Thanks to His Majesty, and to send to <HI>Rome</HI> for his Bulls.</P>
<P>The Princess of <HI>Epinois,</HI> and the Dutchess of <HI>Richelieu</HI> died soon after, the one three days af∣ter the other. The former Died in less than an Hours Sickness, the latter had been long troubled with a tedious Distemper. The Princess <HI>d'Epinois</HI> was walking out of the Marquis of <HI>Barbesieux</HI> his House, when she was seiz'd of a sudden with a vi∣olent Pain: Presently she stop'd and took hold of a Window-shutter to keep her from falling: But in that minute she lost her Senses, and being car∣ried
<PB N="283" REF="442"/>
Home Died in the space of a Quarter of an Hour. She was one of the greatest players at <HI>Lansquenette,</HI> at <HI>Marli,</HI> and many imputed this Accident to her considerable losses, which had∣made so great an alteration in her Blood, that it had been a Miracle if some troublesome thing or other had not come upon her. Mr. <HI>Pelletier,</HI> In∣tendant of the Finances, to whom, 'tis said, she was Married in the way of Conscience, was mightily afflicted at her Death. However, that did not keep him from going to <HI>Versailles</HI> to Coun∣cil. The first time he appear'd every body con∣dol'd his Loss, because all the World knew how far he was concern'd; nay, the King himself knew it, and one time when the Princess had lost a great Summ at <HI>Marli,</HI> and pay'd it next day, to the great surprizal of a great many who thought she was not in a Condition to raise it so soon; His Majesty did not stand to ask Mr. <HI>Pelletier</HI> if 'twas not he that had lent it her: Upon that Mr. <HI>Pelle∣tier</HI> own'd that she had <HI>had</HI> recourse to him to save her Honour. I know not whether His Majesty did not carry his Curiosity further, and ask'd him if he was not Married to her; That being above my Knowledge, I shall know nothing of it for fear of incurring the imputation of a Lye. That Lady had two Sons and two Daughters by her Husband. The Daughters were still Unmarried. 'Twas the Eldest of 'em that the Princess of <HI>Conty,</HI> the King's Daughter would have married to the Marquis <HI>de Valliere.</HI> As for the Sons, the Younger Died a Natural Death, and the Elder had mar∣ried a Daughter of the Prince <HI>de la Isle Bonne,</HI> of the House of <HI>Lorain.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Richelieu</HI> left behind her a Son, and some Daughters. The Birth of that Son had extinguish'd all the hopes of the Marquis of <HI>Rich∣lieu,</HI> the Duke's Nephew, who was intitled to the Succession, in case of no Male Issue. He being a little upon the fret, and nothing being more capa∣ble
<PB N="284" REF="443"/>
to disturb one's Conduct than Poverty, his Wife and he did not agree very well; notwith∣standing he had run away with her, and she de∣serv'd a more honourable Usage. In fine, whe∣ther this misunderstanding increas'd every day, or that his Poverty oblig'd him to avoid the Charges that attend People of their Quality, they parted in the beginning of the Year 1698; and she went to <HI>England</HI> to her Mother; but it being impossible that so pretty a Creature as she, shou'd not have many Admirers; her Husband was quick∣ly sensible, that in striving to be rid of one evil, he had brought another upon himself, that was equal∣ly unsupportable. He was seiz'd with a deep jea∣lousie, and being, upon that score, restless both Night and Day, he set all Springs at Work to o∣blige his Lady to return out of that Country. She thinking she could not be better than with her Mother, would not listen to any Proposal he could make. A Wife seldom gives ear to the Voice of a Hus∣band at a distance, especially a Husband that gives her no relief in time of need: So he was oblig'd to fall upon other measures. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s Daughter was Married to the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> by way of Proxy. The King sent the Young Princess some Presents, upon which she left the Court immediately, and after staying but 24 hours as <HI>Paris,</HI> set out immediately to <HI>Bar,</HI> pursuant to the Duke the Bridegroom's or∣ders, who was to meet her there. The Castle of <HI>Bar</HI> was fitted up for her Reception. When the Duke went to his Estate, he found all his Houses out of order; for the King's Intendants, in that Country, had minded themselves more than any thing else, and had scarce taken care to make the necessary Reparations. The Duke did not go at first to <HI>Nancy,</HI> because the King's Troops were there demolishing the Fortifications: So he stop'd four or five Leagues on the other side of it; whither he, who Commanded the King's Troops, sent him
<PB N="285" REF="444"/>
a Captain, with some Soldiers for his Guard: But that Prince refus'd 'em, thinking it more con∣venient to imploy the Militia of his Country. Ac∣cordingly the Inhabitants of <HI>Nancy,</HI> and the other Towns, provided some Companies of Horse and Foot, till such time as his regular Troops should be in readiness, for which he had given out Com∣missions. In fine, the Duke came to his capital City, when the King's Troops march'd out. As soon as the Duke heard the News, that the young Princess was upon her Journey to <HI>Lorrain,</HI> he came to <HI>Bar,</HI> and, in the mean time, the Inhabitants of <HI>Nancy,</HI> made preparations for her Entry, in pro∣portion to their Ability. For, besides the oppres∣sion they had lain under for the fifty or sixty Years, that their Country was cover'd with forreign Troops, they began to feel the terrible effects of a Famine, which was general, not only over that Country, but all the adjacent States; so that their Neighbours were almost in the same Condition. In some places, indeed, the Season seem'd to pro∣mise Plenty; but when they came to thresh the Corn, it did not yield the half of what it us'd to do. Nay, <HI>France</HI> it self, which us'd to furnish others with Corn, was first sensible of the want of it; and such Disorders happen'd upon the marching of the Troops, that the Judges of the <HI>Police</HI> were oblig'd to defend the Bakers with the strong hand; for the Poor People were like to fall upon 'em and Rob 'em; so great was their Misery. In the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI> there was nothing to be seen but Troops of Beggars, which were yet more numerous in the Country. Mr. <HI>d' Argenson</HI> was so watchful in the City, that they durst not harass the People there, as they did else-where: Tho', after all, some of these hungry wretches pay'd a visit to the Bakers that were coming from <HI>Gonnesse,</HI> and one of 'em gave a Baker a Wound with his Knife, because he would not sell his Bread at what price he pleas'd.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="445"/>
As every body thinks of nothing but getting, so this Dearth put a great many Usurers upon raising the price of Bread yet higher. It being reported that the Farmers General were the People that laid up Magazines of Corn, in order to make up the Loss they had sustain'd upon the Taxes for that the Wine was quite lost that Year; the first Presi∣dent gave 'em to know, that if it was true, they not only run the risque of being pillag'd, but ruin'd to boot; for he was a Man that would not pardon such things; and the Interest of the State and Count∣ry was sufficient to draw such Threats from him in good earnest. Tho' this was a sufficient cause of Fear to those who were conscious of their own Guilt; yet some were so covetous, that they would venture all rather than miss such an opportunity of getting Money. There was one <HI>Miotte</HI> that had Farm'd the Estate of <HI>Meudon,</HI> from the D. of <HI>Or∣leans;</HI> and, upon that score, thought himself proof against any thing that might happen: This Man bought up Corn every where, and made vast Maga∣zines in the Castle of <HI>Montereau Fautyonne.</HI> Mr. <HI>D'Argenson</HI> and the chief President being inform'd of it, the former took him up, and the latter pas∣sed a Decree against him, insomuch, that if he had not found Friends to disswade the President from seizing upon his Person, he had gone near to have been Hang'd: But the Court it self inspected the matter, and it being try'd before the Council, he was clear'd for a Fine of 1000 Livers, and the con∣fiscation of some part of the Corn. Some other Usurers had much the same usage; for the Judges could not deal more severely with them, without making it known that <HI>Miotte</HI>'s Friends were the occasion of the Favour shewn him. However, Mr. <HI>d'Argenson</HI> concerted measures for preventing the like for the future; and sent Commissaries with Persons that he could confide in, all over the Coun∣try, for there was no doing of it without ranging the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="446"/>
The misery of the People fill'd both <HI>Paris</HI> and the Country with Robbers; and the Inhabitants were scarce safe in their Houses. They durst not stir abroad, nor travel either early or late, because the poor Wretches were so desperate as to be ca∣pable of any thing; but Mr. <HI>d'Argenson</HI> took the Alarm upon this, as well as all other disorders; while Mr. <HI>de la Reinie,</HI> his Predecessor, minded nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of the Fruit of his Labours. He had but a Son and a Daughter with a vast Estate; for being all a long very cunning he had laid up an infinity of money. He was somewhat dissatisfied with his Son, who had been at <HI>Rome</HI> a long while, and minded nothing but the Pictures and other Curiosities of the City, without regarding his Father's Example, who had rais'd himself to the highest Post of the Law, tho' he begun with the Lowest. So that Magistrate careing only for his Daughter, resolv'd to marry her as honour∣able as he could. There was enough that offer'd to be Suitors; but one <HI>Machaut,</HI> a Master of Requests, carried his Suit so far, that, after some Dispute, Articles were mutually sign'd. After that, the Lover came to pay his Respects to his Mistress, whom he had never seen. But she being not Handsome, he lik'd her so ill, that he told her Father, That the only way to make him miser∣able, was to oblige him to finish what he had begun. Her Father was a little nettled at the Compliment; however he indeavour∣ed to get off as honourably as he could. He did not ask him the cause of the Breach; but suspecting what it was, he agreed to what he desir'd, because he would not give his Daughter to a Man that did not Love her.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Loraine</HI> having stay'd some days at <HI>Bar</HI> with his Spouse, carry'd her to <HI>Nancy,</HI> where she met with some Magni∣ficence, notwithstanding the publick Calamity; but being bred up at the proudest Court in the World, she minded that far less than the Love of that People for their Sovereign. They shew∣ed it in all their Actions; and what animated 'em very much was, the exemplary Piety of that Young Prince, who, upon that score, might be call'd the Prodigy of the Age. He would see neither Play nor Opera, nor allow of 'em about his Court: He look'd upon those Diversions, not only as unworthy of a Christian, but contrary to the Duty of so Holy a Profession. He was the Son of a Father and Mother, that, in their time, were patterns of Vertue; and 'twas plain that he indeavour'd to make the best use of the Lessons they had given him. The Bi∣shop of <HI>Osnabrug,</HI> the Duke's Brother, arriv'd, at that time, at the Court of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> upon his return from his Bishoprick which he had obtain'd about five or six months before, by the recom∣mend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on of the Emperour his Uncle. He is a handsome Prince, and one that knows his Perfections very well. A Brother of the Elector of <HI>Hannover</HI>'s was formerly possess'd of that Bishoprick, which, pursuant to the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> ought to be fill'd by a Protestant and a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, by turns.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="447"/>
As soon as the D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had taken Possession of his Coun∣tries, he gave advice of it to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uant to the usual Custom. He likewise notified his Marriage in the same manner. And in the mean time indeavour'd by his good Conduct to repair the Disorders that the War had oc∣casion'd in so long a space of time.</P>
<P>In the mean time the P. of <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> gain'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Suit before the High Court of Parliament as well as before the Court of Requests. This solac'd him entirely upon the loss of the Crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oland;</HI> tho' there was a great deal of difference between the one and the other. The New K. of <HI>Poland</HI> did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Crown in Tranquillity. Some of his Subjects charging him with a great many things, were so bold as to send a fresh Message to <HI>Versail∣les,</HI> praying the King to assist 'em with Men and Money for the recovery of their Liberty, which, as they alledg'd, was over∣run by his Usurpation. They accus'd him of Sacrificing the Na∣tion to his private Interests; But His Majesty would not med∣dle in the matter.</P>
<P>The Emperor, as well as the D. of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rain,</HI> had form'd a de∣sign to procure repose to his People, as soon as possibly he could. This he could not effect without making Peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which at last he consented to, tho' they were sensible they were upon the brink of Ruin. He accepted the Mediation of the K. of <HI>England,</HI> and the States General; and the <HI>Turks</HI> having done the same, an Interview was agreed upon at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> in or∣der to adjust the Difference between the two Emperors. In the mean time, he gave notice of all to his Allies, to the end that they having joyntly carried on so successful a War, might mutu∣ally concur in procuring a Peace equally advantageous to the one as well as to the other.</P>
<P>At that time the K. of <HI>England</HI> went to <HI>Germany,</HI> in order to come nearer the place where the Conferences were held. He stop∣ed at the Court of <HI>Hannover,</HI> which occasion'd as much uneasi∣ness to <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>France</HI> occasion'd to the Allies by the Camp they had form'd. In the mean time Ambassadors repair'd from all quarter to <HI>Carlowitz.</HI> His <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty desir'd this Peace very passionately, in order to give some jealousie to <HI>France,</HI> and to see the Emperor's growing Power at a stand: For he wish'd rather that the Emperor should stand in need of his help, than he of the Emperor's. But the Year was over before that great Work was concluded; as well as before the K. of the <HI>Romans</HI> his Marriage with the Princess of <HI>Hannover</HI> was compleated. 'Tis true, that Marriage was concluded upon above two months before; but the young Princess being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in <HI>Italy</HI> along with her Mother, who was gone to see the Dutchess of <HI>Modena,</HI> her Eldest Daughter, it was put off till the beginning of the Year 1699. To conclude, 'tis not doubted, but these two things will quickly be adjusted; which Time will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew to all who have the happiness to live so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng.</P>
