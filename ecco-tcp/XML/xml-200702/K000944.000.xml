<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the AUTHOR of The FOUR FARTHING CANDLES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE, tho' unknown to mine, or me,</L>
<L>You with my ROSCIAD make so free,</L>
<L>And vent your pointless, senseless spite,</L>
<L>Before your Muse has learn'd to write:</L>
<L>I, in return, my gentle friend,</L>
<L>Will scan your work from end to end;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3"/>And shew the critic town at once,</L>
<L>(Whate'er I am) that you're a dunce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FIRST, to defend a hackney'd thought,</L>
<L>Which forty diff'rent Bards have taught,</L>
<L>Without or pity, or remorse,</L>
<L>You drag poor HORACE in by force,</L>
<L>Whose verse thy ears could never reach,</L>
<L>But thro' the stupid lines of CREECH;</L>
<L>And yet you bring one sentence pat in,</L>
<L>To shew you've got a little <HI>Latin,</HI></L>
<L>And tell us, with your usual wit,</L>
<L>(Poeta nascitur, non fit.)</L>
</LG>

<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page 7, of</HI> The Four Farthing Candles.</NOTE> THY mean abuse is next employ'd</L>
<L>On SHIRLEY, COLMAN, CHURCHILL, LLOYD.</L>
<L>Here take some good advice, dull friend,</L>
<L>Abuse not, till you can amend.</L>
<L>And why, because my Muse dar'd raise</L>
<L>Her feeble notes to CHURCHILL's praise,</L>
<L>Must thy prodigious wisdom find;</L>
<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 21, of the same.</NOTE> A refuge only was design'd?</L>
<L>Whilst you to S—T meanly sneak,</L>
<L>And pilf'ring M—'s favour seek:</L>
<L>'Tis true, I said that CHURCHILL's rhimes</L>
<L>Soar'd far beyond these leaden times;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>But that nor rose from partial views,</L>
<L>Nor terror of the two Reviews:</L>
<L>To me the bounteous hand of heav'n,</L>
<L>A fairer, happier lot has giv'n;</L>
<L>Should those two giants both unite</L>
<L>Their Critical, and Monthly spite;</L>
<L>Should all the nation with them join,</L>
<L>And, right or wrong, damn ev'ry line,</L>
<L>By lavish fortune frankly grac'd,</L>
<L>I scorn their rage, and spurn their taste;</L>
<L>Yet if a moment, to beguile,</L>
<L>Should SHIRLEY on my numbers smile;</L>
<L>Should tuneful LLOYD, with wit endow'd,</L>
<L>Superior to the common crowd;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>Or COLMAN haply condescend</L>
<L>One single sentence to commend;</L>
<L>Should HE, whose manly, nervous song,</L>
<L>With strength and sweetness rolls along;</L>
<L>Whose ev'ry verse with candour flows,</L>
<L>Whose ev'ry thought with spirit glows;</L>
<L>With pleasure find one faultless strain,</L>
<L>I might, indeed, be something vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THOU next hast found, with searching eyes,</L>
<L>(Lord! some folks, sure, are mighty wise!)</L>
<L>That times are alter'd since the days,</L>
<L>"When POPE attun'd his deathless Lays <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page 16, of</HI> The Four Farthing Candles.</NOTE>;"</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>That stupid, dull, unmeaning head,</L>
<L>No syllable of his e'er read;</L>
<L>For expletives their aid <HI>do</HI> join,</L>
<L>To lengthen out each feeble line:</L>
<L>Nay, what I think is still more odd,</L>
<L>You write fal-len, and pe-ri-od:</L>
<L>That man that wou'd our ears delight,</L>
<L>Must always fal'n, and period write.</L>
<L>In time, I shall expect to see,</L>
<L>You'll put for HENRY HE-NE-RY.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF, as thou say'st, my sickly song <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page 21, of</HI> The Four Farthing Candles.</NOTE></L>
<L>In lazy numbers crawl, along,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>Sure thou against it should'st not bawl,</L>
<L>Whose song no numbers has at all;</L>
<L>Thy muse, a foul, mishapen elf,</L>
<L>Is rude, and hideous, as thyself:</L>
<L>Thy mortal frame's to me unknown;</L>
<L>I'm speaking of thy mind alone;</L>
<L>Where keen reproaches all resort,</L>
<L>Where biting scandal holds her court;</L>
<L>From whence she throws her pois'nous dart</L>
<L>At ev'ry unprovoking heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page 22, of</HI> The Four Farthing Candles.</NOTE> WHEN common-sense again shall smile</L>
<L>On BRITAIN's long deserted isle,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>Thou dulness shalt no longer handle,</L>
<L>Thy fav'rite theme, a <HI>Farthing Candle</HI>;</L>
<L>Thy similies no longer bring,</L>
<L>Which stink, and vainly strive to sting:</L>
<L>But, leaving all poetic strains</L>
<L>To those whom Heav'n has blest with brains,</L>
<L>Thou shalt thy old employment chuse,</L>
<L>Of sweeping streets, or cleaning shoes.</L>
