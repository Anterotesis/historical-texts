<HEAD>GOTHAM. BOOK III.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CAN the fond Mother from herself depart,</L>
<L>Can she forget the darling of her heart,</L>
<L>The little darling whom she bore and bred,</L>
<L>Nurs'd on her knees, and at her bosom fed?</L>
<L>To whom, she seem'd her ev'ry thought to give,</L>
<L>And in whose life alone, she seem'd to live?</L>
<L>Yes, from herself, the mother may depart,</L>
<L>She may forget the darling of her heart,</L>
<L>The little darling, whom she bore and bred,</L>
<L>Nurs'd on her knees, and at her bosom fed,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>To whom she seem'd her ev'ry thought to give,</L>
<L>And in whose life alone, she seem'd to live;</L>
<L>But I cannot forget, whilst life remains,</L>
<L>And pours her current thro' these swelling veins,</L>
<L>Whilst Mem'ry offers up at Reason's shrine,</L>
<L>But I cannot forget, that GOTHAM's mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can the stern Mother, than the brutes more wild,</L>
<L>From her disnatur'd breast, tear her young child,</L>
<L>Flesh of her flesh, and of her bone the bone,</L>
<L>And dash the smiling babe against a stone?</L>
<L>Yes, the stern Mother, than the brutes more wild,</L>
<L>From her disnatur'd breast, may tear her child;</L>
<L>Flesh of her flesh, and of her bone the bone,</L>
<L>And dash the smiling babe against a stone;</L>
<L>But I, forbid it Heav'n, but I can ne'er</L>
<L>The love of GOTHAM, from this bosom tear,</L>
<L>Can ne'er so far true Royalty pervert</L>
<L>From its fair course, to do my people hurt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With how much ease, with how much confidence,</L>
<L>As if, superior to each grosser sense,</L>
<L>Reason had only, in full pow'r array'd,</L>
<L>To manifest her Will, and be obey'd,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Men make resolves, and pass into decrees</L>
<L>The motions of the Mind! with how much ease</L>
<L>In such resolves, doth passion make a flaw,</L>
<L>And bring to nothing, what was rais'd to law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In empire young, scarce warm on GOTHAM'S throne,</L>
<L>The dangers, and the sweets of pow'r, unknown,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, tho' I scarce know why, like some young child,</L>
<L>Whose little senses each new toy turns wild,</L>
<L>How do I hold sweet dalliance with my crown,</L>
<L>And wanton with dominion, how lay down,</L>
<L>Without the sanction of a precedent,</L>
<L>Rules of most large and absolute extent;</L>
<L>Rules, which from sense of public virtue spring,</L>
<L>And, all at once, commence a PATRIOT KING.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, for the day of tryal is at hand,</L>
<L>And the whole fortunes of a mighty land</L>
<L>Are stak'd on me, and all their Weal or Woe</L>
<L>Must from my Good, or Evil Conduct flow,</L>
<L>Will I, or can I, on a fair review,</L>
<L>As I assume that name, deserve it too?</L>
<L>Have I well weigh'd the great, the noble part</L>
<L>I'm now to play? Have I explor'd my Heart,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>That labyrinth of fraud, that deep, dark cell,</L>
<L>Where, unsuspected e'en by me, may dwell</L>
<L>Ten thousand follies? Have I found out there</L>
<L>What I am fit to do, and what to bear?</L>
<L>Have I trac'd ev'ry passion to its rise,</L>
<L>Nor spar'd one lurking seed of treach'rous vice?</L>
<L>Have I, familiar with my nature grown,</L>
<L>And am I fairly to myself made known?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A PATRIOT KING—Why 'tis a name which bears</L>
<L>The more immediate stamp of Heav'n, which wears</L>
<L>The nearest, best resemblance we can shew</L>
<L>Of God above, thro' all his works below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To still the voice of discord in the land,</L>
<L>To make weak faction's discontented band,</L>
<L>Detected, weak, and crumbling, to decay,</L>
<L>With hunger pinch'd, on their own vitals prey;</L>
<L>Like brethren, in the self-same int'rests warm'd,</L>
<L>Like diff'rent bodies, with one soul imform'd,</L>
<L>To make a nation, nobly rais'd above</L>
<L>All meaner thoughts, grow up in common love;</L>
<L>To give the laws due vigour, and to hold</L>
<L>That sacred ballance, temperate, yet bold,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>With such an equal hand, that those who fear</L>
<L>May yet approve, and own my justice clear;</L>
<L>To be a Common Father, to secure</L>
<L>The weak from violence, from pride the poor;</L>
<L>Vice, and her sons, to banish in disgrace,</L>
<L>To make Corruption dread to shew her face,</L>
<L>To bid afflicted Virtue take new state,</L>
<L>And be, at last, acquainted with the great;</L>
<L>Of all Religions to elect the best,</L>
<L>Nor let her priests be made a standing jest;</L>
<L>Rewards for Worth, with lib'ral hand to carve,</L>
<L>To love the Arts, nor let the Artists starve;</L>
<L>To make fair Plenty through the realm increase,</L>
<L>Give Fame in War, and happiness in Peace,</L>
<L>To see my people virtuous, great and free,</L>
<L>And know that all those blessings flow from me,</L>
<L>O 'tis a joy too exquisite, a thought</L>
<L>Which flatters Nature more than flatt'ry ought.</L>
<L>'Tis a great, glorious task, for Man too hard,</L>
<L>But not less great, less glorious the reward,</L>
<L>The best reward which here to Man is giv'n,</L>
<L>'Tis more than Earth, and little short of Heav'n;</L>
<L>A task (if such comparison may be)</L>
<L>The same in nature, diff'ring in degree,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Like that which God, on whom for aid I call,</L>
<L>Performs with ease, and yet performs to all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How much do they mistake, how little know</L>
<L>Of kings, of kingdoms, and the pains which flow</L>
<L>From royalty, who fancy that a crown</L>
<L>Because it glistens, must be lin'd with down.</L>
<L>With outside show, and vain appearance caught</L>
<L>They look no farther, and, by Folly taught,</L>
<L>Prize high the toys of thrones, but never find</L>
<L>One of the many cares which lurk behind.</L>
<L>The gem they worship, which a crown adorns,</L>
<L>Nor once suspect that crown is lin'd with thorns.</L>
<L>O might Reflection Folly's place supply,</L>
<L>Would we one moment use her piercing eye,</L>
<L>Then should we learn what woe from grandeur springs,</L>
<L>And learn to pity, not to envy kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The villager, born humbly and bred hard,</L>
<L>Content his wealth, and Poverty his guard,</L>
<L>In action simply just, in conscience clear,</L>
<L>By guilt untainted, undisturb'd by fear,</L>
<L>His means but scanty, and his wants but few,</L>
<L>Labour his business and his pleasure too,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Enjoys more comforts in a single hour,</L>
<L>Than ages give the Wretch condemn'd to Pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Call'd up by health, he rises with the day,</L>
<L>And goes to work, as if he went to play,</L>
<L>Whistling off toils, one half of which might make</L>
<L>The stoutest ATLAS of a palace quake;</L>
<L>'Gainst heat and cold, which make us cowards faint,</L>
<L>Harden'd by constant use, without complaint</L>
<L>He bears, what we should think it death to bear;</L>
<L>Short are his meals, and homely is his fare;</L>
<L>His thirst he slakes at some pure neighb'ring brook,</L>
<L>Nor asks for sauce where appetite stands cook.</L>
<L>When the dews fall and when the Sun retires</L>
<L>Behind the Mountains, when the village fires,</L>
<L>Which, waken'd all at once, speak supper nigh,</L>
<L>At distance catch, and fix his longing eye,</L>
<L>Homeward he hies, and with his manly brood</L>
<L>Of raw-bon'd cubs, enjoys that clean, coarse food,</L>
<L>Which, season'd with Good Humour, his fond Bride</L>
<L>'Gainst his return is happy to provide.</L>
<L>Then, free from care, and free from thought, he creeps</L>
<L>Into his straw, and till the morning sleeps.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>Not so the King—with anxious cares oppress'd,</L>
<L>His bosom labours, and admits not rest.</L>
<L>A glorious Wretch, he sweats beneath the Weight</L>
<L>Of Majesty, and gives up ease for state.</L>
<L>E'en when his smiles, which, by the fools of pride,</L>
<L>Are treasur'd and preserv'd from side to side</L>
<L>Fly round the court, e'en when, compell'd by form,</L>
<L>He seems most calm, his soul is in a storm!</L>
<L>CARE, like a spectre, seen by him alone,</L>
<L>With all her nest of vipers, round his throne</L>
<L>By day crawls full in view; when Night bids sleep,</L>
<L>Sweet nurse of Nature, o'er the senses creep,</L>
<L>When Misery herself, no more complains,</L>
<L>And slaves, if possible, forget their chains,</L>
<L>Tho' his sense weakens, tho' his eye grows dim,</L>
<L>That rest which comes to all, comes not to him.</L>
<L>E'en at that hour, CARE, tyrant CARE, forbids,</L>
<L>The dew of sleep to fall upon his lids;</L>
<L>From night to night she watches at his bed;</L>
<L>Now, as one mop'd, sits brooding o'er his head,</L>
<L>Anon she starts, and, borne on raven's wings,</L>
<L>Croaks forth aloud—Sleep was not made for kings.</L>

<L>Thrice hath the Moon her wonted course pursu'd,</L>
<L>Thrice hath she lost her form, and thrice renew'd.</L>
<L>Since (blessed be that season, for before</L>
<L>I was a mere, mere mortal, and no more,</L>

<L>Inform'd with life, to die and pass away)</L>
<L>Since I became a king, and GOTHAM'S throne,</L>

<L>Who, stern and hard of nature, wears a frown</L>
<L>'Gainst faults in other men, yet all the while,</L>
<L>Meets his own vices with a partial smile.</L>
<L>How can a king (yet on record we find</L>
<L>Such kings have been, such curses of mankind)</L>
<L>Enforce that law, 'gainst some poor subject elf,</L>
<L>Which Conscience tells him he hath broke himself?</L>
<L>Can he some petty rogue to Justice call</L>
<L>For robbing one, when he himself robs all?</L>
<L>Must not, unless extinguish'd, Conscience fly</L>
<L>Into his cheek, and blast his fading eye,</L>

<L>Against himself doth he not sentence give?</L>
<L>If one must die, t'other's not fit to live.</L>

<L>Tun'd their soft pipes; when from the neighb'ring bloom,</L>
<L>Sipping the dew, each Zephyr stole persume;</L>
<L>When all things with new vigour were inspir'd,</L>
<L>And seem'd to say they never could be tir'd;</L>
<L>How often have we stray'd, whilst sportive Rhime</L>
<L>Deceiv'd the way, and clipp'd the wings of Time,</L>
<L>O'er hill, o'er dale! how often laugh'd to see,</L>
<L>Yourselves made visible to none but me,</L>
<L>The clown, his Work suspended, gape and stare,</L>
<L>And seem to think that I convers'd with Air!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the Sun, beating on the parched soil,</L>
<L>Seem'd to proclaim an interval of toil,</L>
<L>When a faint languor crept thro' ev'ry breast,</L>
<L>And things most us'd to labour, wish'd for rest,</L>
<L>How often, underneath a rev'rend oak,</L>
<L>Where safe, and fearless of the impious stroke</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>Some sacred DRYAD liv'd, or in some grove,</L>
<L>Where with capricious fingers FANCY wove</L>
<L>Her fairy bow'r, whilst NATURE all the while</L>
<L>Look'd on, and view'd her mock'ries with a smile</L>
<L>How we held converse sweet! how often laid,</L>
<L>Fast by the Thames, in HAM'S inspiring shade,</L>
<L>Amongst those Poets, which make up your train,</L>
<L>And, after death, pour forth the sacred Strain,</L>
<L>Have I, at your command, in verse grown grey,</L>
<L>Put not impaired, heard DRYDEN tune that lay,</L>
<L>Which might have drawn an Angel from his sphere,</L>
<L>And kept him from his office list'ning here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When dreary NIGHT, with MORPHEUS in her train,</L>
<L>Led on by SILENCE to resume her reign,</L>
<L>With Darkness covering, as with a robe,</L>
<L>This scene of Levity, blank'd half the globe,</L>
<L>How oft', enchanted with your heav'nly strains,</L>
<L>Which stole me from myself, which in soft chains</L>
<L>Of Musick bound my soul, how oft' have I,</L>
<L>Sounds more than human floating thro' the Sky,</L>
<L>Attentive sat, whilst NIGHT, against her Will.</L>
<L>Transported with the harmony, stood still!</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>How oft' in raptures, which Man scarce could bear,</L>
<L>Have I, when gone, still thought the Muses there,</L>
<L>Still heard their Music, and, as mute as death,</L>
<L>Sat all attention, drew in ev'ry Breath,</L>
<L>Lest, breathing all too rudely, I should wound,</L>
<L>And marr that magic excellence of sound:</L>
<L>Then, Sense returning with return of Day,</L>
<L>Have chid the Night, which fled so fast away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such my Pursuits, and such my Joys of yore,</L>
<L>Such were my Mates, but now my Mates no more.</L>
<L>Plac'd out of Envy's walk, (for Envy sure</L>
<L>Would never haunt the cottage of the Poor,</L>
<L>Would never stoop to wound my homespun lays)</L>
<L>With some few Friends, and some small share of Praise,</L>
<L>Beneath Oppression, undisturb'd by Strife,</L>
<L>In Peace I trod the humble vale of Life.</L>
<L>Farewell these scenes of ease, this tranquil state;</L>
<L>Welcome the troubles which on Empire wait.</L>
<L>Light toys from this day forth I disavow,</L>
<L>They pleas'd me once, but cannot suit me now;</L>
<L>To common Men all common things are free,</L>
<L>What honours them might fix disgrace on me.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>Call'd to a throne, and o'er a mighty land</L>
<L>Ordain'd to rule, my head, my heart, my hand</L>
<L>Are all engross'd, each private view withstood,</L>
<L>And task'd to labour for the Public Good;</L>
<L>Be this my study, to this one great end</L>
<L>May ev'ry thought, may ev'ry action tend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me the page of History turn o'er,</L>
<L>Th' instructive page, and heedfully explore</L>
<L>What faithful pens of former times have wrote,</L>
<L>Of former kings; what they did worthy note,</L>
<L>What worthy blame, and from the sacred tomb</L>
<L>Where righteous Monarchs sleep, where laurels bloom</L>
<L>Unhurt by Time, let me a garland twine,</L>
<L>Which, robbing not their Fame, may add to mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor let me with a vain and idle eye</L>
<L>Glance o'er those scenes, and in a hurry fly</L>
<L>Quick as a Post which travels day and night,</L>
<L>Nor let me dwell there, lur'd by false delight,</L>
<L>And, into barren theory betray'd,</L>
<L>Forget that Monarchs are for action made.</L>
<L>When am'rous SPRING, repairing all his charms,</L>
<L>Calls Nature forth from hoary Winter's arms,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>Where, like a Virgin to some letcher sold,</L>
<L>Three wretched months, she lay benumb'd, and cold;</L>
<L>When the weak Flow'r, which, shrinking from the breath</L>
<L>Of the rude North, and, timorous of Death,</L>
<L>To its kind Mother Earth for shelter fled,</L>
<L>And on her bosom hid its tender head,</L>
<L>Peeps forth afresh, and, chear'd by milder skies,</L>
<L>Bids in full splendour all her beauties rise;</L>
<L>The Hive is up in arms—expert to teach,</L>
<L>Nor, proudly, to be taught unwilling, each</L>
<L>Seems from her fellow a new zeal to catch;</L>
<L>Strength in her limbs, and on her wings dispatch,</L>
<L>The BEE goes forth; from herb to herb she flies,</L>
<L>From Flow'r to Flow'r, and loads her lab'ring thighs</L>
<L>With treasur'd sweets, robbing those Flow'rs, which left,</L>
<L>Find not themselves made poorer by the theft,</L>
<L>Their scents as lively, and their looks as fair,</L>
<L>As if the pillager had not been there.</L>
<L>Ne'er doth she flit on Pleasure's silken Wing,</L>
<L>Ne'er doth she, loit'ring, let the bloom of Spring</L>
<L>Unrifled pass, and on the downy breast</L>
<L>Of some fair Flow'r indulge untimely rest.</L>
<L>Ne'er doth she, drinking deep of those rich dews</L>
<L>Which Chymist Night prepar'd, that faith abuse</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>Due to the hive, and, selfish in her toils,</L>
<L>To her own private use convert the spoils.</L>
<L>Love of the Stock first call'd her forth to roam,</L>
<L>And to the Stock she brings her booty Home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be this my Pattern—As becomes a King,</L>
<L>Let me fly all abroad on Reason's wing,</L>
<L>Let mine eye, like the Light'ning, thro' the Earth</L>
<L>Run to and fro, nor let one deed of Worth,</L>
<L>In any Place and Time, nor let one Man</L>
<L>Whose actions may enrich Dominion's plan,</L>
<L>Escape my Note; be all, from the first day</L>
<L>Of Nature to this hour, be all my prey.</L>
<L>From those, whom Time at the desire of Fame</L>
<L>Hath spar'd, let Virtue catch an equal flame;</L>
<L>From those, who not in mercy, but in rage,</L>
<L>Time hath repriev'd to damn from age to age,</L>
<L>Let me take warning, lesson'd to distill,</L>
<L>And, imitating Heav'n, draw Good from Ill.</L>
<L>Nor let these great researches in my breast</L>
<L>A monument of useless labour rest,</L>
<L>No—let them spread—th' effects let GOTHAM share,</L>
<L>And reap the harvest of their Monarch's care,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="27"/>Be other Times, and other Countries known,</L>
<L>Only to give fresh Blessings to my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me (and may that God to whom I fly,</L>
<L>On whom for needful succour I rely</L>
<L>In this great Hour, that glorious God of Truth,</L>
<L>Thro' whom I reign, in mercy to my youth,</L>
<L>Assist my weakness, and, direct me right,</L>
<L>From ev'ry speck which hangs upon the Sight,</L>
<L>Purge my mind's eye, nor let one cloud remain</L>
<L>To spread the shades of error o'er my Brain)</L>
<L>Let me, Impartial, with unweary'd thought,</L>
<L>Try Men and Things; let me, as Monarchs ought,</L>
<L>Examine well on what my Pow'r depends,</L>
<L>What are the gen'ral Principles, and Ends</L>
<L>Of Government, how Empire first began,</L>
<L>And wherefore Man was rais'd to reign o'er Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me consider, as from one great Source</L>
<L>We see a thousand rivers take their course,</L>
<L>Dispers'd, and into diff'rent channels led,</L>
<L>Yet by their Parent still supply'd and fed,</L>
<L>That Government, (tho' branch'd out far and wide,</L>
<L>In various Modes to various lands applied)</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>Howe'er it differs in its outward frame,</L>
<L>In the main Ground-work's ev'ry where the same;</L>
<L>The same her view, tho' different her plan,</L>
<L>Her grand and gen'ral view, the Good of Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me find out, by Reason's sacred beams,</L>
<L>What System in itself most perfect seems,</L>
<L>Most worthy Man, most likely to conduce</L>
<L>To all the purposes of gen'ral use;</L>
<L>Let me find too, where, by fair Reason try'd,</L>
<L>It fails, when to Particulars appli'd,</L>
<L>Why in that mode all Nations do not join,</L>
<L>And, chiefly, why it cannot suit with mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me the gradual Rise of empires trace</L>
<L>'Till they seem'd founded on Perfection's base,</L>
<L>Then (for when human things have made their way</L>
<L>To Excellence, they hasten to decay)</L>
<L>Let me, whilst Observation lends her clue,</L>
<L>Step by Step, to their quick Decline pursue,</L>
<L>Enabled by a chain of Facts to tell</L>
<L>Not only how they rose, but how they fell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
<L>Let me not only the distempers know</L>
<L>Which in all States from common causes grow,</L>
<L>But likewise those, which by the will of Fate,</L>
<L>On each peculiar mode of Empire wait,</L>
<L>Which in its very Constitution lurk,</L>
<L>Too sure at last, to do its destin'd work;</L>
<L>Let me, forewarn'd, each Sign, each System learn,</L>
<L>That I my people's danger may discern,</L>
<L>E'er 'tis too late wish'd Health to re-assure,</L>
<L>And, if it can be found, find out a cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me (tho' great, grave Brethren of the gown,</L>
<L>Preach all Faith up, and preach all Reason down,</L>
<L>Making those jar, whom Reason meant to join,</L>
<L>And vesting in themselves a right divine)</L>
<L>Let me, thro' Reason's glass, with searching eye,</L>
<L>Into the depth of that Religion pry,</L>
<L>Which Law hath sanction'd; let me find out there</L>
<L>What's Form, what's Essence; what, like vagrant Air,</L>
<L>We well may change; and what, without a crime,</L>
<L>Cannot be chang'd to the last Hour of Time.</L>
<L>Nor let me suffer that outrageous zeal,</L>
<L>Which, without knowledge, furious Bigots feel,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>Fair in pretence, tho' at the heart unfound,</L>
<L>These sep'rate points at random to confound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Times have been, when priests have dar'd to tread,</L>
<L>Proud and insulting, on their Monarch's head,</L>
<L>When, whilst they made Religion a pretence,</L>
<L>Out of the World they banish'd common sense,</L>
<L>When some soft King, too open to deceit,</L>
<L>Easy and unsuspecting, join'd the cheat,</L>
<L>Dup'd by mock Piety, and gave his name</L>
<L>To serve the vilest purposes of shame.</L>
<L>Fear not, my People, where no cause of fear</L>
<L>Can justly rise—Your King secures you here,</L>
<L>Your King, who scorns the haughty prelate's nod,</L>
<L>Nor deems the voice of priests, the voice of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me (tho' Lawyers may perhaps forbid</L>
<L>Their Monarch to behold what they wish hid,</L>
<L>And, for the purposes of knavish gain,</L>
<L>Would have their trade a mystery remain)</L>
<L>Let me, disdaining all such slavish awe,</L>
<L>Dive to the very bottom of the Law;</L>
<L>Let me (the weak, dead letter left behind)</L>
<L>Search out the Principles, the Spirit find,</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="31"/>Till, from the parts, made master of the whole,</L>
<L>I see the <HI>Constitution</HI>'s very Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me (tho' Statesmen will no doubt resist,</L>
<L>And to my eyes present a fearful lift</L>
<L>Of men, whose wills are opposite to mine,</L>
<L>Of men, great men, determin'd to resign)</L>
<L>Let me (with firmness, which becomes a King,</L>
<L>Conscious from what a source my actions spring,</L>
<L>Determin'd not by worlds to be withstood,</L>
<L>When my grand object is my Country's Good)</L>
<L>Unravel all low Ministerial scenes,</L>
<L>Destroy their jobs, lay bare their ways and means,</L>
<L>And track them step by step; let me well know</L>
<L>How Places, Pensions, and Preferments go,</L>
<L>Why Guilt's provided for, when Worth is not,</L>
<L>And why one Man of merit is forgot,</L>
<L>Let me in Peace, in War, Supreme preside,</L>
<L>And dare to know my way without a Guide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let me (tho' Dignity, by nature proud,</L>
<L>Retires from view, and <HI>swells</HI> behind a cloud,</L>
<L>As if the Sun shone with less pow'rful ray,</L>
<L>Less Grace, less Glory, shining ev'ry day;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="32"/>Tho' when she comes forth into public sight,</L>
<L>Unbending as a Ghost, she stalks upright,</L>
<L>With such an air as we have often seen,</L>
<L>And often laugh'd at in a tragic queen,</L>
<L>Nor, at her presence, tho' base Myriads crook</L>
<L>The supple knee, vouchsafes a single look.</L>
<L>Let me (all vain parade, all empty pride,</L>
<L>All terrors of Dominion laid aside,</L>
<L>All ornament, and needless helps of art,</L>
<L>All those big looks, which speak a little Heart)</L>
<L>Know (which few Kings alas! have ever known)</L>
<L>How Affability becomes a Throne,</L>
<L>Destroys all fear, bids Love with Rev'rence live,</L>
<L>And gives those Graces Pride can never give.</L>
<L>Let the stern Tyrant keep a distant state,</L>
<L>And, hating all Men, fear return of Hate,</L>
<L>Conscious of Guilt, retreat behind his throne,</L>
<L>Secure from all upbraidings but his own,</L>
<L>Let all my Subjects have access to Me,</L>
<L>Be my ears open as my heart is free;</L>
<L>In full, fair tide, let Information flow,</L>
<L>That evil is half cur'd, whose cause we know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
<L>And thou, where e'er thou art, thou wretched Thing,</L>
<L>Who art afraid to look up to a King,</L>
<L>Lay by thy fears—make but thy grievance plain,</L>
<L>And, if I not redress thee, may my Reign</L>
<L>Close up that very Moment—to prevent</L>
<L>The course of JUSTICE, from her fair intent,</L>
<L>In vain my nearest, dearest friend shall plead,</L>
<L>In vain my mother kneel—my soul may bleed,</L>
<L>But must not change—When JUSTICE draws the dart,</L>
<L>Tho' it is doom'd to, pierce a Fav'rite's Heart,</L>
<L>'Tis mine to give it force, to give it aim—</L>
<L>I know it Duty, and I feel it Fame.</L>
