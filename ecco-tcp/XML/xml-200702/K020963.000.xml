<HEAD>GOTHAM. BOOK II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW much mistaken are the men, who think</L>
<L>That all who will, without restraint, may drink,</L>
<L>May largely drink, e'en till their bowels burst,</L>
<L>Pleading no right but merely that of thirst,</L>
<L>At the pure waters of the living well,</L>
<L>Beside whose streams the MUSES love to dwell!</L>
<L>Verse is with them a knack, an idle toy,</L>
<L>A rattle gilded o'er, on which a boy</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>May play untaught, whilst, without art or force,</L>
<L>Make it but jingle, Musick comes of course.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Little do such men know the toil, the pains,</L>
<L>The daily, nightly racking of the brains,</L>
<L>To range the thoughts, the matter to digest,</L>
<L>To cull fit phrases, and reject the rest,</L>
<L>To know the times when HUMOUR, on the cheek</L>
<L>Of MIRTH may hold her sports, when WIT should speak,</L>
<L>And when be silent; when to use the pow'rs</L>
<L>Of Ornament, and how to place the flow'rs,</L>
<L>So that they neither give a tawdry glare,</L>
<L>Nor waste their sweetness in the desart air;</L>
<L>To form (which few can do, and scarcely one,</L>
<L>One Critick in an age can find, when done)</L>
<L>To form a plan, to strike a grand Outline,</L>
<L>To fill it up, and make the picture shine</L>
<L>A full, and perfect piece; to make coy rime</L>
<L>Renounce her follies, and with sense keep time,</L>
<L>To make proud sense against her nature bend,</L>
<L>And wear the chains of rime, yet call her friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some Fops there are, amongst the Scribbling tribe,</L>
<L>Who make it all their business to <HI>describe,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>No matter whether in, or out of place;</L>
<L>Studious of finery, and fond of lace,</L>
<L>Alike they trim, as Coxcomb Fancy brings,</L>
<L>The rags of beggars, and the robes of kings.</L>
<L>Let dull <HI>Propriety</HI> in State preside</L>
<L>O'er her dull children, Nature is their guide,</L>
<L>Wild Nature, who at random breaks the fence</L>
<L>Of those tame drudges <HI>Judgment, Taste,</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI></L>
<L>Nor would forgive herself the mighty crime</L>
<L>Of keeping terms with <HI>Person, Place,</HI> and <HI>Time.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let <HI>liquid</HI> Gold emblaze the Sun at noon,</L>
<L>With <HI>borrow'd</HI> beams let Silver <HI>pale</HI> the Moon,</L>
<L>Let surges <HI>hoarse</HI> lash the resounding shore,</L>
<L>Let Streams <HI>Maeander,</HI> and let Torrents <HI>roar,</HI></L>
<L>Let them breed up the <HI>melancholy</HI> breeze</L>
<L>To <HI>sigh with sighing, sob with sobbing trees,</HI></L>
<L>Let Vales <HI>embroid'ry</HI> wear, let Flow'rs be <HI>ting'd</HI></L>
<L>With various <HI>tints,</HI> let Clouds be <HI>lac'd</HI> or <HI>fring'd,</HI></L>
<L>They have their wish; like idle monarch Boys,</L>
<L>Neglecting things of weight, they sigh for toys;</L>
<L>Give them the crown, the sceptre, and the robe,</L>
<L>Who will may take the pow'r, and rule the globe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Others there are, who, in one solemn pace,</L>
<L>With as much zeal, as Quakers rail at lace,</L>
<L>Railing at needful Ornament, depend</L>
<L>On Sense to bring them to their journey's end.</L>
<L>They would not (Heav'n forbid) their course delay,</L>
<L>Nor for a moment step out of the way,</L>
<L>To make the barren road those graces wear,</L>
<L>Which Nature would, if pleas'd, have planted there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain Men! who blindly thwarting Nature's plan</L>
<L>Ne'er find a passage to the heart of man;</L>
<L>Who, bred 'mongst fogs in Academic land,</L>
<L>Scorn ev'ry thing they do not understand;</L>
<L>Who, destitute of Humour, Wit, and Taste,</L>
<L>Let all their little knowledge run to waste,</L>
<L>And frustrate each good purpose, whilst they wear</L>
<L>The robes of Learning with a sloven's air.</L>
<L>Tho' solid Reas'ning arms each sterling line,</L>
<L>Tho' Truth declares aloud, "This work is mine,"</L>
<L>Vice, whilst from page to page dull Morals creep,</L>
<L>Throws by the book, and Virtue falls asleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sense, <HI>mere, dull, formal</HI> Sense, in this gay town</L>
<L>Must have some vehicle to pass her down,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Nor can She for an hour ensure her reign,</L>
<L>Unless She brings fair Pleasure in her train.</L>
<L>Let Her, from day to day, from year to year,</L>
<L>In all her grave solemnities appear,</L>
<L>And, with the voice of trumpets, thro' the streets</L>
<L>Deal lectures out to ev'ry one She meets,</L>
<L>Half who pass by are deaf, and t'other half</L>
<L>Can hear indeed, but only hear to laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quit then, Ye graver Sons of letter'd Pride,</L>
<L>Taking for once Experience as a guide,</L>
<L>Quit this grand Errour, this dull <HI>College</HI> mode;</L>
<L>Be your pursuits the same, but change the road;</L>
<L>Write, or at least appear to write with ease,</L>
<L>And, if You mean to profit, learn to please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain for such mistakes they pardon claim,</L>
<L>Because they wield the pen in Virtue's name.</L>
<L>Thrice sacred is that Name, thrice bless'd the Man</L>
<L>Who thinks, speaks, writes, and lives on such a plan!</L>
<L>This, in himself, himself of course must bless,</L>
<L>But cannot with the world promote success.</L>
<L>He may be strong, but, with effect to speak,</L>
<L>Should recollect his readers may be weak;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Plain, rigid Truths, which Saints with comfort bear,</L>
<L>Will make the Sinner tremble, and despair.</L>
<L>True Virtue acts from Love, and the great end,</L>
<L>At which She nobly aims, is to amend;</L>
<L>How then do those mistake, who arm her laws</L>
<L>With rigour not their own, and hurt the cause</L>
<L>They mean to help, whilst with a zealot rage</L>
<L>They make that Goddess, whom they'd have engage</L>
<L>Our dearest Love, in hideous terrour rise!</L>
<L>Such may be honest, but they can't be wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In her own full, and perfect blaze of light,</L>
<L>Virtue breaks forth too strong for human sight:</L>
<L>The dazzled eye, that nice but weaker sense,</L>
<L>Shuts herself up in darkness for defence.</L>
<L>But, to make strong conviction deeper sink,</L>
<L>To make the callous feel, the thoughtless think,</L>
<L>Like God made Man, she lays her glory by,</L>
<L>And beams mild comfort on the ravish'd eye.</L>
<L>In earnest most, when most she seems in jest,</L>
<L>She worms into, and winds around the breast,</L>
<L>To conquer vice, of vice appears the friend,</L>
<L>And seems unlike herself to gain her end.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>The Sons of Sin, to while away the time</L>
<L>Which lingers on their hands, of each black crime</L>
<L>To hush the painful memory, and keep</L>
<L>The tyrant Conscience in delusive sleep,</L>
<L>Read on at random, nor suspect the dart</L>
<L>Until they find it rooted in their heart.</L>
<L>'Gainst Vice they give their vote, nor know at first</L>
<L>That, cursing that, themselves too they have curs'd,</L>
<L>They see not, till they fall into the snares,</L>
<L>Deluded into Virtue unawares.</L>
<L>Thus the shrewd doctor, in the spleen-struck mind</L>
<L>When pregnant horrour sits, and broods o'er wind,</L>
<L>Discarding drugs, and striving how to please,</L>
<L>Lures on insensibly, by slow degrees,</L>
<L>The patient to those manly sports, which bind</L>
<L>The slacken'd sinews, and relieve the mind;</L>
<L>The patient feels a change as wrought by stealth,</L>
<L>And wonders on demand to find it health.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some Few, whom Fate ordain'd to deal in rimes</L>
<L>In other lands, and <HI>here</HI> in other times,</L>
<L>Whom, waiting at their birth, the <HI>Midwife</HI> MUSE</L>
<L>Sprinkled all over with Castalian dews,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>To whom true GENIUS gave his magic pen,</L>
<L>Whom ART by just degrees led up to men,</L>
<L>Some Few, extremes well-shunn'd, have steer'd between</L>
<L>These dang'rous rocks, and held the golden mean.</L>
<L>SENSE in their works maintains her proper state,</L>
<L>But never sleeps, or labours with her weight;</L>
<L>GRACE makes the whole look elegant, and gay,</L>
<L>But never dares from SENSE to run astray.</L>
<L>So nice the Master's touch, so great his care,</L>
<L>The Colours boldly glow, not idly glare.</L>
<L>Mutually giving, and receiving aid,</L>
<L>They set each other off, like light and shade,</L>
<L>And, as by stealth, with so much softness blend,</L>
<L>'Tis hard to say, where they begin, or end.</L>
<L>Both give us charms, and neither gives offence;</L>
<L>SENSE perfects GRACE, and GRACE enlivens SENSE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Peace to the Men, who these high honours claim,</L>
<L>Health to their souls, and to their mem'ries fame:</L>
<L>Be it my task, and no mean task, to teach</L>
<L>A rev'rence for that worth I cannot reach;</L>
<L>Let me at distance, with a steady eye,</L>
<L>Observe, and mark their passage to the sky,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>From envy free, applaud such rising worth,</L>
<L>And praise their heav'n, tho' pinion'd down to earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had I the pow'r, I could not have the time,</L>
<L>Whilst spirits flow, and Life is in her prime,</L>
<L>Without a sin 'gainst Pleasure, to design</L>
<L>A plan, to methodize each thought, each line</L>
<L>Highly to finish, and make ev'ry grace,</L>
<L>In itself charming, take new charms from place.</L>
<L>Nothing of Books, and little known of men,</L>
<L>When the mad fit comes on, I seize the pen,</L>
<L>Rough as they run, the rapid thoughts set down,</L>
<L>Rough as they run, discharge them on the Town.</L>
<L>Hence rude, unfinish'd brats, before their time,</L>
<L>Are born into this idle world of rime,</L>
<L>And the poor <HI>slattern</HI> MUSE is brought to bed</L>
<L>With all her imperfections on her head.</L>
<L><HI>Some,</HI> as no life appears, no pulses play</L>
<L>Through the dull, dubious mass, no breath makes way,</L>
<L>Doubt, greatly doubt, till for a glass they call,</L>
<L>Whether the Child can be baptiz'd at all.</L>
<L>Others, on other grounds, objections frame,</L>
<L>And, granting that the child may have a name,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Doubt, as the Sex might well a midwife pose,</L>
<L>Whether they should baptize it, Verse or Prose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'en what my masters please; Bards, mild, meek men,</L>
<L>In love to Critics stumble now and then.</L>
<L>Something I do myself, and something too,</L>
<L>If they can do it, leave for them to do.</L>
<L>In the small compass of my careless page</L>
<L>Critics may find employment for an age;</L>
<L>Without my blunders they were all undone;</L>
<L>I twenty feed, where MASON can feed one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When SATIRE stoops, unmindful of her state,</L>
<L>To praise the man I love, curse him I hate;</L>
<L>When SENSE, in tides of passion borne along,</L>
<L>Sinking to prose, degrades the name of song;</L>
<L>The Censor smiles, and, whilst my credit bleeds,</L>
<L>With as high relish on the carrion feeds</L>
<L>As the <HI>proud</HI> EARL fed at a Turtle feast,</L>
<L>Who, turn'd by gluttony to worse than beast,</L>
<L>Eat, 'till his bowels gush'd upon the floor,</L>
<L>Yet still eat on, and dying call'd for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>loose</HI> DIGRESSION, like a colt unbroke,</L>
<L>Spurning <HI>Connection,</HI> and her formal yoke,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>Bounds thro' the forest, wanders far astray</L>
<L>From the known path, and loves to loose her way,</L>
<L>'Tis a full feast to all the mongril pack</L>
<L>To run the rambler down, and bring her back.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>gay</HI> DESCRIPTION, Fancy's fairy child,</L>
<L>Wild without art, and yet with pleasure wild,</L>
<L>Waking with Nature at the morning hour</L>
<L>To the lark's call, walks o'er the op'ning flow'r</L>
<L>Which largely drank all night of heav'n's fresh dew,</L>
<L>And, like a Mountain Nymph of Dian's crew,</L>
<L>So lightly walks, she not one mark imprints,</L>
<L>Nor brushes off the dews, nor soils the tints;</L>
<L>When thus DESCRIPTION sports, e'en at the time</L>
<L>That Drums should beat, and Cannons roar in rime,</L>
<L>Critics can live on such a fault as that</L>
<L>From one month to the other, and grow fat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye mighty <HI>Monthly</HI> Judges, in a dearth</L>
<L>Of letter'd blockheads, conscious of the worth</L>
<L>Of my materials, which against your will</L>
<L>Oft You've confess'd, and shall confess it still,</L>
<L>Materials rich, tho' rude, enflam'd with Thought,</L>

<L>Till thread on thread depending, part on part,</L>
<L>Colour with Colour mingling, Light with Shade,</L>
<L>To your dull taste a formal work is made,</L>

<L>Soon as the mighty Critic <HI>Fiat</HI>'s heard,</L>
<L>SCIENCE attends their call; their pow'r is own'd;</L>
<L>ORDER takes place, and GENIUS is dethron'd;</L>
<L>Letters dance into books, defiance hurl'd</L>

<L>Me higher business calls, a greater plan,</L>
<L>Worthy Man's whole employ, the good of Man,</L>
<L>The good of Man committed to my charge;</L>
<L>If idle Fancy rambles forth at large,</L>
