<HEAD>THE Grumbletonians; OR, THE DOGS without-Doors.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Wealthy Farmer in the West,</L>
<L>With Life's Enjoyments amply blest,</L>
<L>A Man esteem'd both far and near,</L>
<L>Who in his House kept special Beer;</L>
<L>Twelve Children eke around his Table,</L>
<L>All lusty, lively, brisk and able:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He carried wondrous well his Age,</L>
<L>His Wife was Housewifely and Sage;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
They throve, and pick'd up Wealth apace,</L>
<L>And none at Church of them took Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two Mastiff Dogs he kept, to guard</L>
<L>His House, his Poultry, and his Yard;</L>
<L>With Offal from the Meat he kill'd,</L>
<L>Their hungry Paunches well he fill'd:</L>
<L>All sleek they were, and in good Case,</L>
<L>And shew'd the Plenty of the Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But in the House they durst not enter,</L>
<L>My Dame her Crock'ry would not venture;</L>
<L>For she had Tea-Table, and China,</L>
<L>And held her Head as high as any:</L>
<L>Her House was kept too nice and neat</L>
<L>For Dogs to traipse with dirty Feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For many Years these Currs were quiet,</L>
<L>Nor grumbled at their Bounds or Diet,</L>
<L>Would bark at Beggar or at Stranger,</L>
<L>And make much Noise at little Danger;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
But, to the Comers too and fro,</L>
<L>No Marks of Surliness they'd shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Hound the Farmer had beside,</L>
<L>A Hound! His Hearts delight and Pride;</L>
<L>Peerless he was of all his Kind,</L>
<L>So fleet! he would out-strip the Wind,</L>
<L>The best that ever follow'd Game,</L>
<L>Frolick he was, and FLY his Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Carest and lov'd by ev'ry Soul,</L>
<L>He rang'd the House without Controul;</L>
<L>This made the angry Mastiffs jealous,</L>
<L>FLY should be rais'd above his Fellows:</L>
<L>Keep his Nose warm and lick the Plates,</L>
<L>While they stood shiv'ring at the Gates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They grudge each Bit that goes beside 'em,</L>
<L>And vow Revenge what e'er betide 'em;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
In short so wond'rous fell they grew,</L>
<L>At Friend and Foe they fiercely flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These ugly Currs kept such a Rout,</L>
<L>That no one durst stir in or out;</L>
<L>To quiet them their Master try'd,</L>
<L>But they his Threats and Him defy'd:</L>
<L>Their Fury would not be abated,</L>
<L>They bark'd the more, the more he rated;</L>
<L>And made such a confounded Din,</L>
<L>He thought 'twas best to let 'em in:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For why, their Noise disturb'd the Head</L>
<L>Of my good Dame, now sick a-bed;</L>
<L>So, rather than her Head should ake,</L>
<L>He let 'em in for Quiet's sake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lest their Rage on him should fall,</L>
<L>He wisely rais'd his Plowmen all,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
With Prong, and Fork, and Bill in Hand,</L>
<L>These furious Creatures to withstand;</L>
<L>But for this Caution was no need,</L>
<L>As by the Sequel you may read:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For soon as e'er the Door was ope,</L>
<L>They both into the Kitchen crope,</L>
<L>Wagging their Tails, all tame and mild,</L>
<L>As harmless Lamb, or sucking Child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These Currs who were so fierce before,</L>
<L>Now crouch and wriggle on the Floor;</L>
<L>Fawn at the very Servants Feet,</L>
<L>And tremble lest they should be beat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next they traverse the Kitchen round,</L>
<L>To see what Prog is to be found;</L>
<L>Where, having fed to Hearts desire,</L>
<L>They stretch'd themselves before the Fire,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Content and snug they lay till broad day Light,</L>
<L>The House was still, my Dame slept well that Night.</L>
