<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE and WRITINGS OF Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>THE lives of men of letters seldom abound with inci∣dents; and perhaps no life ever afforded fewer than that which I have undertaken to write. But I am far from mentioning this by way of previous apology, as is the trite custom of biographers. The respect which I owe to my deceased friend, to the public, (and let me add) to myself, prompts me to wave so impertinent a ceremonial. A reader of sense and taste never expects to find in the memoirs of a Phi∣losopher, or Poet, the same species of entertainment, or infor∣mation, which he would receive from those of a Statesman or General: He expects, however, to be either informed or enter∣tained:
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Nor would he be disappointed, did the writer take care to dwell principally on such topics as characterize the man, and distinguish that peculiar part which he acted in the varied Drama of Society. But this rule, self-evidently right as it may seem, is seldom observed. It was said, with almost as much truth as wit, of one of these writers, that, when he composed the life of Lord Verulam, he forgot that he was a Philosopher; and therefore, it was to be feared, should he finish that of the Duke of Marlborough, he would forget that he was a General. I shall avoid a like fault. I will promise my reader that he shall, in the following pages, seldom behold Mr. Gray in any other light than that of a Scholar and a Poet: And though I am more solicitous to shew that he was a virtuous, a friendly, and an amiable man, than either; yet this solicitude becomes unnecessary from the very papers which he has bequeathed me, and which I here arrange for the pur∣pose: Since in these the qualities of his head and heart so constantly appear together, and the fertility of his fancy so in∣timately unites with the sympathetic tenderness of his soul, that were it in my intention, I should find it impossible to disjoin them.</P>
<P>His parents were reputable citizens of London. His grand∣father a considerable merchant: But his father, Mr. Philip Gray, though he also followed business, was of an indolent and reserved temper; and therefore rather diminished than in∣creased his paternal fortune. He had many children, of whom Thomas, the subject of these memoirs, was the fifth born. All of them, except him, died in their infancy; and I have been told that he narrowly escaped suffocation, (owing to too
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
great a fullness of blood which destroyed the rest) and would certainly have been cut off as early, had not his mother, with a courage remarkable for one of her sex, and withal so very tender a parent, ventured to open a vein with her own hand, which instantly removed the paroxysm.</P>
<P>He was born in Cornhill, December the 26th, 1716; was educated at Eton school, under the care of Mr. Antrobus, his mother's brother, who was at that time one of the assistant masters. From thence he removed to St. Peter's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a pensioner in the year 1734. While at school, he contracted a friendship with Mr. Horace Walpole and Mr. Richard West: The former of these appears, at present, with too much distinction in the literary, as well as fashionable world, to make it neces∣sary I should enlarge upon his subject: But as the latter died before he could exert his uncommon abilities, it seems requi∣site to premise somewhat concerning him; especially as al∣most every anecdote which I have to produce, concerning the juvenile part of Mr. Gray's life, is included in his corre∣spondence with this gentleman. A correspondence which con∣tinued, with very little interruption, for the space of about eight years, from the time of their leaving school to the death of the accomplished youth in question.</P>
<P>His father was Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His grandfather, by the mother, the famous Bishop Burnet. He removed from Eton to Oxford, about the same time that Mr. Gray left that place for Cambridge. Each of them carried with him the repu∣tation of an excellent classic scholar; though I have been told
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
that, at the time, Mr. West's genius was reckoned the more bril∣liant of the two: A judgment which, I conceive, was not well founded; for though Mr. West's part of that correspondence, which I shall speedily give the reader,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am well aware that I am here going to do a thing which the cautious and courtly Dr. Sprat (were he now alive) would highly censure. He had, it seems, a large collection of his friend Mr. Cowley's letters, <Q REND="inline">"a way of writing in which he peculiarly excelled, as in these he always exprest the native tenderness and innocent gaiety of his heart; yet the Doctor was of opinion that nothing of this nature should be published, and that the letters that pass between particu∣lar friends (if they are written as they ought to be) can scarce ever be fit to see the light."</Q> What! not when they express the native tenderness and innocent gaiety of a heart like Mr. Cowley's? No, by no means, <Q REND="inline">"for in such letters the souls of men appear undrest, and in that negligent habit they may be fit to be seen by one or two in a chamber, but not to go abroad in the street."</Q> <BIBL><HI>See Life of Cowley, page</HI> 38, <HI>Hurd's Edition.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P>Such readers as believe it incumbent on every well-bred soul never to appear but in full dress, will think that Dr. Sprat has reason on his side; but I suspect that the generality will, notwithstanding, wish he had been less scrupulously deli∣cate, and lament that the letters in question are not now extant. Of one thing I am fully confident that, had this been the case, the judicious Dr. Hurd would have found his critical labour much lessened, when, in pure charity to this amiable writer, he lately employed himself in separating</P>
<P>His pleasing moral from his pointed wit.</P></NOTE> will undoubtedly shew that he possest very extraordinary talents, yet, on Mr. Gray's side, there seems superadded to these, such a manly precision of taste, and maturity of judgment, as would induce one to believe Mr. Walpole's phrase not very hyperbolical, who has often asserted to me that, <Q REND="inline">"Gray never was a Boy."</Q></P>
<P>In April, 1738, Mr. West left Christ Church for the In∣ner Temple, and Mr. Gray removed from Peter-House to
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Town the latter end of that year; intending also to apply him∣self to the study of the Law in the same society: For which purpose his father had already either hired or bought him a set of chambers. But on an invitation which Mr. Walpole gave him to be his companion in his travels, this intention was laid aside for the present, and never after put in execution.</P>
<P>According to the plan which I have formed for arranging these papers, a part of the letters which I have already mentioned will here find their proper place. They will give a much clearer idea both of Mr. Gray and his friend, at this early period, than any narrative of mine. They will include also several speci∣mens of their juvenile compositions, and, at the same time, mark the progress they had made in literature. They will ascertain, not only the scope and turn of their genius, but of their temper. In a word, Mr. Gray will become his own biographer, both in this and the rest of the sections into which I divide this work. By which means, and by the assistance of a few notes which I shall occasionally add, it may be hoped that nothing will be omitted which may tend to give a regular and clear delineation of his life and character.</P>
<P>But as this is the earliest part of their correspondence, and includes only the time which passed between Mr. Gray's ad∣mission into the university and his going abroad, it may be rea∣sonably expected that the manner rather than the matter of these letters must constitute their principal merit; they will therefore be chiefly acceptable to such ingenuous youths, who, being about the same age, have a relish for the same studies, and bosoms susceptible of the same warmth of friendship. To
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
these I address them; in the pleasing hope that they may prompt them to emulate their elegant simplicity, and, of course, to study with more care the classic models from which it was derived. If they do this, I shall not be much concerned if graver readers think them unimportant or even trifling.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. WEST to Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU use me very cruelly: You have sent me but one letter since I have been at Oxford, and that too agree∣able not to make me sensible how great my loss is in not having more. Next to seeing you is the pleasure of seeing your hand-writing; next to hearing you is the pleasure of hearing from you. Really and sincerely I wonder at you, that you thought it not worth while to answer my last letter. I hope this will have better success in behalf of your quondam school-fellow; in behalf of one who has walked hand in hand with you, like the two children in the wood,
<Q><L>Through many a flowery path and shelly grot,</L>

The very thought, you see, tips my pen with poetry, and brings Eton to my view. Consider me very seriously here in a strange country, inhabited by things that call themselves Doctors and
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. WEST.</HEAD>
<P>PERMIT me again to write to you, though I have so long neglected my duty, and forgive my brevity, when I tell you it is occasioned wholly by the hurry I am in to get to a place where I expect to meet with no other pleasure than the sight of you; for I am preparing for London in a few days at furthest. I do not wonder in the least at your frequent bla∣ming my indolence, it ought rather to be called ingratitude, and I am obliged to your goodness for softening so harsh an ap∣pellation. When we meet it will, however, be my greatest of pleasures to know what you do, what you read, and how you spend your time, &amp;c. &amp;c. and to tell you what I do not read, and how I do not, &amp;c. for almost all the employment of my hours may be best explained by negatives; take my word and experience upon it, doing nothing is a most amusing business;
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
and yet neither something nor nothing gives me any pleasure. When you have seen one of my days, you have seen a whole year of my life; they go round and round like the blind horse in the mill, only he has the satisfaction of fancying he makes a progress, and gets some ground; my eyes are open enough to see the same dull prospect, and to know that having made four∣and-twenty steps more, I shall be just where I was; I may, bet∣ter than most people, say my life is but a span, were I not afraid lest you should not believe that a person so short-lived could write even so long a letter as this; in short, I believe I must not send you the history of my own time, till I can send you that also of the reformation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carrying on the allusion to the other history written by Mr. West's grandfather.</NOTE> However, as the most undeserving people in the world must sure have the vanity to wish somebody had a regard for them, so I need not wonder at my own, in being pleased that you care about me. You need not doubt, therefore, of having a first row in the front box of my little heart, and I believe you are not in danger of being crouded there; it is asking you to an old play, indeed, but you will be candid enough to excuse the whole piece for the sake of a few tolerable lines.</P>
<P>For this little while past I have been playing with Statius; we yesterday had a game at quoits together; you will easily forgive me for having broke his head, as you have a little pique to him. I send you my translation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This consisted of about 110 lines, which were sent separately, and as I believe it was Mr. Gray's first attempt in english verse, it is a curiosity not to be entirely withheld from the reader; therefore, although it is not my intention to fill these memoirs with much either of his or his correspondent's productions in this way, yet as a few lines will show how much Mr. Gray had imbibed of Dryden's spirited manner, at this early period, I insert at the end of the letter a specimen of the whole.</NOTE>, which I did not engage
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
in because I liked that part of the Poem, nor do I now send it to you because I think it deserves it, but merely to show you how I mispend my days.</P>

<P>I Agree with you that you have broke Statius's head, but it is in like manner as Apollo broke Hyacinth's, you have foiled him infinitely at his own weapon; I must in∣sist on seeing the rest of your translation, and then I will exa∣mine it entire, and compare it with the latin, and be very wise and severe, and put on an inflexible face, such as becomes the character of a true son of Aristarchus, of hyper-critical me∣mory. In the mean while,

Your Hymenêal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Published in the Cambridge collection of verses on the Prince of Wales's marriage. I have not thought it necessary to insert these hexameters, as adulatory verses of this kind, however well written, deserve not to be transmitted to poste∣rity; and, indeed, are usually buried, as they ought to be, in the trash with which they are surrounded. Every person, who feels himself a poet, ought to be above prostituting his powers on such occasions, and extreme youth (as was the case with Mr. Gray) is the only thing that can apologize for having done it.</NOTE> I was told was the best in
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
the Cambridge Collection before I saw it, and, indeed, it is no great compliment to tell you I thought it so when I had seen it, but sincerely it pleased me best. Methinks the college bards have run into a strange taste on this occasion. Such soft unmeaning stuff about Venus and Cupid, and Peleus and The∣tis, and Zephyrs and Dryads, was never read. As for my poor little Eclogue it has been condemned and beheaded by our Westminster judges; an exordium of about sixteen lines abso∣lutely cut off, and its other limbs quartered in a most barba∣rous manner. I will send it you in my next as my true and lawful heir, in exclusion of the pretender, who has the impu∣dence to appear under my name.</P>
<P>As yet I have not looked into Sir Isaac. Public disputa∣tions I hate; mathematics I reverence; history, morality, and natural philosophy have the greatest charms in my eye; but who can forget poetry? they call it idleness, but it is surely the most enchanting thing in the world, <Q REND="inline">"ac dulce otium &amp; poene omni negotio pulchrius."</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>The following letter seems to require some little preface, not so much because it expresses Mr. Gray's juvenile sentiments con∣cerning the mode of our academical education, as that these sen∣timents
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
prevailed with him through life, and that he often de∣clared them, with so little reserve, as to create him many enemies. It is certain that at the time when he was admit∣ted, and for some years after, Jacobitism, and its concomitant hard drinking, prevailed still at Cambridge, much to the pre∣judice not only of good manners but of good letters; for, if this spirit was then on the decline, it was not extinguished till after the year 1745. But we see (as was natural enough in a young man) he laid the blame rather on the mode of education than the mode of the times; and to this error, the uncommon pro∣ficiency he had made at Eton in classical learning might contri∣bute, as he found himself in a situation where that species of merit held not the first rank. However this be, it was necessary not to omit this feature of his mind, when employed in draw∣ing a general likeness of it, and what colours could be found so forcible as his own to express its true light and shadow? I would further observe, that whatever truth there might be in his satire at the time it was written, it can by no means affect the present state of the university. There is usually a much greater fluctuation of taste and manners in an academical, than a national body; occasioned (to use a scholastic metaphor) by that very quick succession of its component parts, which often goes near to destroy its personal identity. Whatever therefore may be true of such a society at one time, may be, and generally is, ten years after absolutely false.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. WEST.</HEAD>
<P>YOU must know that I do not take degrees, and, after this term, shall have nothing more of college impertinencies to undergo, which I trust will be some pleasure to you, as it is a
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
great one to me. I have endured lectures daily and hourly since I came last, supported by the hopes of being shortly at full liber∣ty to give myself up to my friends and classical companions, who, poor souls! though I see them fallen into great contempt with most people here, yet I cannot help sticking to them, and out of a spirit of obstinacy (I think) love them the better for it; and indeed, what can I do else? Must I plunge into metaphysics? Alas, I cannot see in the dark; nature has not furnished me with the optics of a cat. Must I pore upon mathematics? Alas, I cannot see in too much light; I am no eagle. It is very pos∣sible that two and two make four, but I would not give four farthings to demonstrate this ever so clearly; and if these be the profits of life, give me the amusements of it. The peo∣ple I behold all around me, it seems, know all this and more, and yet I do not know one of them who inspires me with any ambition of being like him. Surely it was of this place, now Cambridge, but formerly known by the name of Babylon, that the prophet spoke when he said, <Q REND="inline">"the wild beasts of the desart shall dwell there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures, and owls shall build there, and satyrs shall dance there; their forts and towers shall be a den for ever, a joy of wild asses; there shall the great owl make her nest, and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow; it shall be a court of dragons; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest."</Q> You see here is a pretty collection of desolate animals, which is verified in this town to a tittle, and perhaps it may also allude to your habitation, for you know all types may be taken by abundance of handles; however, I defy your owls to match mine.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. WEST to Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>I Congratulate you on your being about to leave college,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I suspect that Mr. West mistook his correspondent; who, in saying he did not take degrees, meant only to let his friend know that he should soon be re∣leased from lectures and disputations. It is certain that Mr. Gray continued at college near two years after the time he wrote the preceding letter.</NOTE> and rejoice much you carry no degrees with you. For I would not have had You dignified, and I not, for the world, you would have insulted me so. My eyes, such as they are, like yours, are neither metaphysical nor mathematical; I have, nevertheless, a great
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
respect for your connoisseurs that way, but am always contented to be their humble admirer. Your collection of desolate ani∣mals pleased me much; but Oxford, I can assure you, has her owls that match yours, and the prophecy has certainly a squint that way. Well, you are leaving this dismal land of bondage, and which way are you turning your face? Your friends, indeed, may be happy in you, but what will you do with your classic companions? An inn of court is as horrid a place as a college, and a moot case is as dear to gentle dullness as a syllogism. But wherever you go, let me beg you not to throw poetry <Q REND="inline">"like a nauseous weed away:"</Q> Cherish its sweets in your bosom, they will serve you now and then to correct the disgusting sober fol∣lies of the common law, misce stultitiam consiliis brevem, dulce est desipere in loco; so said Horace to Virgil, those two sons of Anac in poetry, and so say I to you, in this degenerate land of pigmies,

Tibullus, you must know, is my favourite elegiac poet; for his language is more elegant and his thoughts more natural than Ovid's. Ovid excells him only in wit, of which no poet had more in my opinion. The reason I choose
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
so melancholy a kind of poesie, is because my low spirits and constant ill health (things in me not imaginary, as you surmise, but too real, alas! and, I fear, constitutional) <Q REND="inline">"have tuned my heart to elegies of woe;"</Q> and this likewise is the reason why I am the most irregular thing alive at college, for you may de∣pend upon it I value my health above what they call discipline. As for this poor unlicked thing of an elegy, pray criticise it unmercifully, for I send it with that intent. Indeed your late translation of Statius might have deterred me, but I know you are not more able to excell others, than you are apt to for∣give the want of excellence, especially when it is found in the productions of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. WEST to Mr GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been very ill, and am still hardly recovered. Do you remember Elegy 5th, Book the 3d, of Tibullus, Vos tenet, &amp;c. and do you remember a letter of Mr. Pope's, in sickness, to Mr. Steele? This melancholy elegy and this melancholy letter I turned into a more melancholy epistle of my own, du∣ring my sickness, in the way of imitation; and this I send to you and my friends at Cambridge not to divert them, for it can∣not, but merely to show them how sincere I was when sick: I hope my sending it to them now may convince them I am no less sincere, though perhaps more simple, when well.</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>AD AMICOS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Almost all Tibullus's elegy is imitated in this little piece, from whence his transition to Mr. Pope's letter is very artfully contrived, and bespeaks a degree of judgment much beyond Mr. West's years.</NOTE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Yes, happy youths, on Camus' sedgy side,</L>
<L>You feel each joy that friendship can divide;</L>
<L>Each realm of science and of art explore,</L>
<L>And with the antient blend the modern lore.</L>
<L>Studious alone to learn whate'er may tend</L>

Mean time at me (while all devoid of art</L>
<L>These lines give back the image of my heart)</L>
<L>At me the pow'r that comes or soon or late,</L>
<L>Or aims, or seems to aim, the dart of fate;</L>
<L>From you remote, methinks, alone I stand</L>
<L>Like some sad exile in a desert land;</L>
<L>Around no friends their lenient care to join</L>
<L>In mutual warmth, and mix their heart with mine.</L>
<L>Or real pains, or those which fancy raise,</L>
<L>For ever blot the sunshine of my days;</L>
<L>To sickness still, and still to grief a prey,</L>
<L>Health turns from me her rosy face away.</L>

<LG>
<L>Just heav'n! what sin, ere life begins to bloom,</L>
<L>Devotes my head untimely to the tomb;</L>
<L>Did e'er this hand against a brother's life</L>
<L>Drug the dire bowl or point the murd'rous knife?</L>
<L>Did e'er this tongue the slanderer's tale proclaim,</L>
<L>Or madly violate my Maker's name?</L>
<L>Did e'er this heart betray a friend or foe,</L>
<L>Or know a thought but all the world might know?</L>
<L>As yet just started from the lists of time,</L>
<L>My growing years have scarcely told their prime;</L>
<L>Useless, as yet, through life I've idly run,</L>

<P>AFTER a month's expectation of you, and a fortnight's despair, at Cambridge, I am come to town, and to better hopes of seeing you.

I ought to wish for the continuance of any thing that could be the occasion of so much pleasure to me. Low spirits are my true and faithful companions; they get up with me, go to bed with me, make journeys and returns as I do; nay, and pay visits, and will even affect to be jocose, and force a feeble laugh with me; but most commonly we sit alone together, and are the prettiest insipid company in the world. However, when you come, I believe they must undergo the fate of all humble companions, and be discarded. Would I could turn them to the same use that you have done, and make an Apollo of them. If they could write such verses with me, not hartshorn, nor spi∣rit of amber, nor all that furnishes the closet of an apothecary's widow, should persuade me to part with them: But, while I write to you, I hear the bad news of Lady Walpole's death on Saturday night last.

present writing; and though the gout forbids him galloping after them in the field, yet he continues still to regale his ears and nose with their comfortable noise and stink. He holds me mighty cheap, I perceive, for walking when I should ride, and reading when I should hunt. My comfort amidst all this is, that I have at the distance of half a mile, through a green lane, a forest (the vulgar call it a common) all my own, at least as good as so, for I spy no human thing in it but myself. It is a little chaos of mountains and precipices; mountains, it is true, that do not ascend much above the clouds, nor are the declivities quite so amazing as Dover cliff; but just such hills as people who love their necks as well as I do may venture to climb, and craggs that give the eye as much pleasure as if they were more dangerous: Both vale and hill are covered with most venerable beeches, and other very reverend vegetables, that, like most other antient people, are always dreaming out their old stories to the winds,<Q><L>And as they bow their hoary tops relate,</L>
<L>In murm'ring sounds, the dark decrees of fate;</L>

The timorous hare and sportive squirrel gambol around me like Adam in Paradise, before he had an Eve; but I think he did not use to read Virgil, as I commonly do there. In this situation I often converse with my Horace, aloud too, that is talk to you, but I do not remember that I ever heard you answer me. I beg pardon for taking all the conversation to myself, but it is entirely your own fault. We have old Mr. Southern at a Gentleman's

<P>I AM coming away all so fast, and leaving behind me, with∣out the least remorse, all the beauties of Sturbridge Fair. Its white bears may roar, its apes may wring their hands, and crocodiles cry their eyes out, all's one for that; I shall not once visit them, nor so much as take my leave. The uni∣versity has published a severe edict against schismatical con∣gregations, and created half a dozen new little procterlings to see its orders executed, being under mighty apprehensions lest <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orator Henley.</NOTE>Henley and his gilt tub should come to the Fair and seduce their young ones; but their pains are to small purpose, for lo, after all, he is not coming.</P>
<P>I am at this instant in the very agonies of leaving college, and would not wish the worst of my enemies a worse situation. If you knew the dust, the old boxes, the bedsteads, and tutors that are about my ears, you would look upon this letter as a great effort of my resolution and unconcernedness in the midst of evils. I fill up my paper with a loose sort of version of that scene in Pastor Fido that begins, Care selve beati.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Latin version is extremely elegiac, but as it is only a version I do not insert it. Mr. Gray did not begin to learn Italian till about a year and a half before he translated this scene; and I find amongst his papers an english transla∣tion of part of the 4th Canto of Tasso's Gerusalemma Liberata, done previously to this, which has great merit. In a letter to Mr. West, dated March, 1737, he says, <Q REND="inline">"I learn Italian like any dragon, and in two months am got through the 16th book of Tasso, whom I hold in great admiration: I want you to learn too, that I may know your opinion of him; nothing can be easier than that language to any one who knows Latin and French already, and there are few so copious and expressive."</Q> In the same letter he tells him, <Q REND="inline">"that his College has set him a versifying on a public occasion," (viz. those verses which are called Tripos) "on the theme of Luna est habitabilis."</Q> The poem, I believe, is to be found in the Musae Etonenses. I would further observe, on this occasion, that though Mr. Gray had lately read and translated Statius, yet when he attempted com∣position, his judgment immediately directed him to the best model of versification; accordingly his hexameters are, as far as modern ones can be, after the manner of Virgil: They move in the succession of his pauses and close with his elisions.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mr. Gray, on his return to Town, continued at his father's house in Cornhill till the March following, in which inter∣val Mr. Walpole being disinclined to enter so early into the bu∣siness of Parliament, prevailed on Sir Robert Walpole to permit him to go abroad, and on Mr. Gray (as was said before) to be the companion of his travels. Mr. West spent the greatest part of the winter with his mother and sister at Epsom, during which time a letter or two more passed between the two friends. But these I think it unnecessary to insert, as I have already given sufficient specimens of the blossoms of their Genius. The Reader of taste and candour will, I trust, consider them only as such; yet will be led to think that, as the one produced afterwards <Q REND="inline">"fruits worthy of paradise,"</Q> the other, had he lived longer, would also have produced them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>AS I allot this Section entirely to that part of Mr. Gray's life, which he spent in travelling through France and Italy, my province will be chiefly that of an Editor; and my only care to select, from a large collection of letters written to his parents and to his friend Mr. West, those parts which, I imagine, will be most likely either to inform or amuse the reader. The multiplicity of accounts, published, both before and after the time when these letters were written, of those very places which Mr. Gray describes, will necessarily take from them much of their novelty; yet the elegant ease of his epistolary style has a charm in it for all readers of true taste, that will make every apology of this sort needless. They will per∣ceive, that as these letters were written without even the most distant view of publication, they are essentially different in their manner of description from any other that have either preceded or followed them; add to this, that they are interspersed occa∣sionally with some exquisitely finished pieces of Latin poetry, which he composed on the spot for the entertainment of his friend. But not to anticipate any part of the reader's pleasure, I shall only further say, to forewarn him of a disappointment, that this correspondence is defective towards the end, and in∣cludes no description either of Venice or its territory; the last places which Mr. Gray visited. This defect was occasioned by an unfortunate disagreement between him and Mr. Walpole,
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
arising from the difference of their tempers. The former being, from his earliest years, curious, pensive, and philosophi∣cal; the latter gay, lively, and, consequently, inconsiderate: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In justice to the memory of so respectable a friend, Mr. Walpole enjoins me to charge him with the chief blame in their quarrel; confessing that more atten∣tion, complaisance, and deference to a warm friendship, and superior judgment and prudence, might have prevented a rupture that gave much uneasiness to them both, and a lasting concern to the survivor; though in the Year 1744 a reconci∣liation was effected between them, by a Lady who wished well to both parties.</NOTE> this therefore occasioned their separation at Reggio. Mr. Gray went before him to Venice; and staying there only till he could find means of returning to England, he made the best of his way home, repassing the Alps, and following almost the same route through France by which he had before gone to Italy.</P>

<P>AS we made but a very short journey to-day, and came to our inn early, I sit down to give you some account of our expedition. On the 29th (according to the style here) we left Dover at twelve at noon, and with a pretty brisk gale, which pleased every body mighty well, except myself who was extremely sick the whole time; we reached Calais by five: The weather changed, and it began to snow hard the minute we came into the harbour, where we took the boat, and soon landed. Calais is an exceeding old, but very pretty town, and
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
we hardly saw any thing there that was not so new and so different from England, that it surprized us agreeably. We went the next morning to the great Church, and were at high Mass (it being Easter Monday). We saw also the Convent of the Capuchins, and the Nuns of St. Dominic; with these last we held much conversation, especially with an English Nun, a Mrs. Davis, of whose work I sent you, by the return of the Pacquet, a letter-case to remember her by. In the after∣noon we took a Post-chaise (it still snowing very hard) for Boulogne, which was only eighteen miles further. This chaise is a strange sort of conveyance, of much greater use than beauty, resembling an ill-shaped chariot, only with the door opening before instead of the side; three horses draw it, one between the shafts, and the other two on each side, on one of which the postillion rides, and drives too:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was before the introduction of Post-chaises here, else it would not have appeared a circumstance worthy notice.</NOTE> This vehicle will, upon occasion, go fourscore miles a-day, but Mr. Walpole, being in no hurry, chooses to make easy jour∣neys of it, and they are easy ones indeed; for the motion is much like that of a sedan, we go about six miles an hour, and commonly change horses at the end of it: It is true they are no very graceful steeds, but they go well, and through roads which they say are bad for France, but to me they seem gravel walks and bowling-greens; in short it would be the finest tra∣velling in the world, were it not for the inns, which are mostly terrible places indeed. But to describe our progress somewhat more regularly, we came into Boulogne when it was almost dark, and went out pretty early on Tuesday morning; so that all I can say about it is, that it is a large, old, fortified town,
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
with more English in it than French. On Tuesday we were to go to Abbéville, seventeen leagues, or fifty-one short English miles; but by the way we dined at Montreuil, much to our hearts' content, on stinking mutton cutlets, addle eggs, and ditch water. Madame the hostess made her appearance in long lappets of bone lace and a sack of linsey-woolsey. We supped and lodged pretty well at Abbéville, and had time to see a little of it before we came out this morning. There are seventeen convents in it, out of which we saw the chapels of the Minims and the Carmelite Nuns. We are now come further thirty miles to Amiens, the chief city of the province of Picardy. We have seen the cathedral, which is just what that of Can∣terbury must have been before the reformation. It is about the same size, a huge Gothic building, beset on the outside with thousands of small statues, and within adorned with beau∣tiful painted windows, and a vast number of chapels dressed out in all their finery of altar-pieces, embroidery, gilding, and marble. Over the high altar is preserved, in a very large wrought shrine of massy gold, the reliques of St. Firmin, their patron saint. We went also to the chapels of the Jesuits and Ursuline Nuns, the latter of which is very richly adorned. To∣morrow we shall lie at Clermont, and next day reach Paris. The country we have passed through hitherto has been flat, open, but agreeably diversified with villages, fields well-culti∣vated, and little rivers. On every hillock is a wind-mill, a crucifix, or a Virgin Mary dressed in Flowers, and a sarcenet robe; one sees many people or carriages on the road; now and then indeed you meet a strolling friar, a country-man with his great muff, or a woman riding astride on a little ass, with short petticoats, and a great head-dress of blue wool. ***</P>

<P>ENFIN donc me voici à Paris. Mr. Walpole is gone out to supper at Lord Conway's, and here I remain alone, though invited too. Do not think I make a merit of writing to you preferably to a good supper; for these three days we have been here, have actually given me an aversion to eating in general. If hunger be the best sauce to meat, the French are certainly the worst cooks in the world; for what tables we have seen have been so delicately served, and so profusely, that, after rising from one of them, one imagines it impossible ever to eat again. And now, if I tell you all I have in my head, you will believe me mad, mais n'importe, courage, allons! for if I wait till my head grow clear and settle a little, you may stay long enough for a letter. Six days have we been coming hither, which other people do in two; they have not been disagree∣able ones; through a fine, open country, admirable roads, and in an easy conveyance; the inns not absolutely intolerable, and images quite unusual presenting themselves on all hands. At Amiens we saw the fine cathedral, and eat paté des perdrix; passed through the park of Chantilly by the Duke of Bourbon's palace, which we only beheld as we passed; broke down at Lusarch; stopt at St. Denis, saw all the beautiful monuments of the Kings of France, and the vast treasures of the abbey, rubies, and emeralds as big as small eggs, crucifixes, and vows, crowns and reliquaries, of inestimable value; but of all their curiosities the thing the most to our tastes, and which they in∣deed
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
do the justice to esteem the glory of their collection, was a vase of an entire onyx, measuring at least five inches over, three deep, and of great thickness. It is at least two thou∣sand years old, the beauty of the stone and sculpture upon it (representing the mysteries of Bacchus) beyond expression ad∣mirable; we have dreamed of it ever since. The jolly old Be∣nedictine, that showed us the treasures, had in his youth been ten years a soldier; he laughed at all the reliques, was very full of stories, and mighty obliging. On Saturday Evening we got to Paris, and were driving through the streets a long while be∣fore we knew where we were. The minute we came, voila Milors Holdernesse, Conway, and his brother; all stayed supper, and till two o'clock in the morning, for here nobody ever sleeps; it is not the way: Next day go to dine at my Lord Holder∣nesse's, there was the Abbé Prevôt, author of the Cleveland, and several other pieces much esteemed; the rest were English. At night we went to the Pandore; a spectácle literally, for it is nothing but a beautiful piece of machinery of three scenes. The first represents the chaos, and by degrees the separation of the elements. The second, the temple of Jupiter, and the giving of the box to Pandora. The third, the opening of the box, and all the mischiefs that ensued. An absurd design, but executed in the highest perfection, and that in one of the finest theatres in the world; it is the grande sale des machines in the Palais des Tuileries. Next day dined at Lord Waldegrave's; then to the opera. Imagine to yourself for the drama four acts entirely unconnected with each other, each founded on some little history, skilfully taken out of an ancient author, e. g. Ovid's Metamorphoses, &amp;c. and with great address converted into a French piece of gallantry. For instance, that which I
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
saw, called the Ballet de la Paix, had its first act built upon the story of Nereus. Homer having said he was the handsomest man of his time, the poet, imagining such a one could not want a mistress, has given him one. These two come in and sing sentiment in lamentable strains, neither air nor recitative; only, to one's great joy, they are every now and then interrupt∣ed by a dance, or (to one's great sorrow) by a chorus that bor∣ders the stage from one end to the other, and screams, past all power of simile to represent. The second act was Baucis and Philemon. Baucis is a beautiful young shepherdess, and Phile∣mon her swain. Jupiter falls in love with her, but nothing will prevail upon her; so it is all mighty well, and the chorus sing and dance the praises of Constancy. The two other acts were about Iphis and Ianthe, and the Judgment of Paris. Imagine, I say, all this transacted by cracked voices, trilling divisions upon two notes and a half, accompanied by an orchestra of humstrums, and a whole house more attentive than if Farinelli sung, and you will almost have formed a just notion of the thing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author's sentiments here seem to correspond entirely with those which J. J. Rousseau afterwards published in his famous Lettre sur la Musique Fran∣çoîse. In a french letter also, which Mr. Gray writ to his friend soon after this, he calls their music <Q REND="inline">"des miaulemens &amp; des heurlemens effroyables, melés avec un tintamarre du diable: voilà la musique Françoise en abregé."</Q></NOTE> Our astonishment at their absurdity you can never con∣ceive; we had enough to do to express it by screaming an hour louder than the whole dramatis personae. We have also seen twice the Comedie Françoise; first, the Mahomet Second, a tra∣gedy that has had a great run of late; and the thing itself does not want its beauties, but the actors are beyond measure de∣lightful. Mademoiselle Goussin (Mr. Voltaire's Zara) has with
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
a charming (though little) person the most pathetic tone of voice, the finest expression in her face, and most proper action imaginable. There is also a Dufrêne, who did the chief cha∣racter, a handsome man and a prodigious fine actor. The second we saw was the Philosophe marié, and here they performed as well in comedy; there is a Mademoiselle Quinault, somewhat in Mrs. Clive's way, and a Monsieur Grandval, in the nature of Wilks, who is the genteelest thing in the world. There are several more would be much admired in England, and many (whom we have not seen) much celebrated here. Great part of our time is spent in seeing churches and palaces full of fine pictures, &amp;c. the quarter of which is not yet exhausted. For my part, I could entertain myself this month merely with the common streets and the people in them. ***</P>

<P>AFTER the little particulars aforesaid I should have pro∣ceeded to a journal of our transactions for this week past, should have carried you post from hence to Versailles, hurried you through the gardens to Trianon, back again to Paris, so away to Chantilly. But the fatigue is perhaps more than you can bear, and moreover I think I have reason to sto∣mach your last piece of gravity. Supposing you were in your soberest mood, I am sorry you should think me capable of ever being so dissipé, so evaporé, as not to be in a condition of
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
relishing any thing you could say to me. And now, if you have a mind to make your peace with me, arouse ye from your megrims and your melancholies, and (for exercise is good for you) throw away your night-cap, call for your jack-boots, and set out with me, last Saturday evening, for Versailles—and so at eight o'clock, passing through a road speckled with vines, and villas, and hares, and partridges, we arrive at the great avenue, flanked on either hand with a double row of trees about half a mile long, and with the palace itself to terminate the view; facing which, on each side of you is placed a semi∣circle of very handsome buildings, which form the stables. These we will not enter into, because you know we are no jockies. Well! and is this the great front of Versailles? What a huge heap of littleness! it is composed, as it were, of three courts, all open to the eye at once, and gradually dimi∣nishing till you come to the royal apartments, which on this side present but half a dozen windows and a balcony. This last is all that can be called a front, for the rest is only great wings. The hue of all this mass is black, dirty red, and yel∣low; the first proceeding from stone changed by age; the second, from a mixture of brick; and the last, from a profu∣sion of tarnished gilding. You cannot see a more disagreeable tout-ensemble; and, to finish the matter, it is all stuck over in many places with small busts of a tawny hue between every window. We pass through this to go into the garden, and here the case is indeed altered; nothing can be vaster and more magnificent than the back front; before it a very spacious ter∣race spreads itself, adorned with two large basons; these are bordered and lined (as most of the others) with white marble, with handsome statues of bronze reclined on their edges. From
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
hence you descend a huge flight of steps into a semi-circle formed by woods, that are cut all round into niches, which are filled with beautiful copies of all the famous antique statues in white marble. Just in the midst is the bason of Latona; she and her children are standing on the top of a rock in the middle, on the sides of which are the peasants, some half, some totally changed into frogs, all which throw out water at her in great plenty. From this place runs on the great alley, which brings you into a complete round, where is the bason of Apollo, the biggest in the gardens. He is rising in his car out of the water, surrounded by nymphs and tritons, all in bronze, and finely executed, and these, as they play, raise a perfect storm about him; beyond this is the great canal, a prodigious long piece of water, that terminates the whole: All this you have at one coup d'oeil in entering the garden, which is truly great. I cannot say as much of the general taste of the place; every thing you behold savours too much of art; all is forced, all is constrained about you; statues and vases sowed every where without distinction; sugar-loaves and minced-pies of yew; scrawl-work of box, and little squirt∣ing jets-d'eau, besides a great sameness in the walks, cannot help striking one at first sight, not to mention the silliest of labyrinths, and all Aesop's fables in water; since these were de∣signed in usum Delphini only. Here then we walk by moon∣light, and hear the ladies and the nightingales sing. Next morning, being Whitsunday, make ready to go to the Installa∣tion of nine Knights du Saint Esprit, Cambis is one: high mass celebrated with music, great croud, much incense, King, Queen, Dauphin, Mesdames, Cardinals, and Court: Knights arrayed by his majesty; reverences before the altar, not bows, but
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
curtsies; stiff hams; much tittering among the ladies; trum∣pets, kettle-drums and fifes. My dear West, I am vastly de∣lighted with Trianon, all of us with Chantilly; if you would know why, you must have patience, for I can hold my pen no longer, except to tell you that I saw Britannicus last Night; all the characters, particularly Agrippina and Nero, done to per∣fection; to-morrow Phaedra and Hippolitus. We are making you a little bundle of petites pieces; there is nothing in them, but they are acting at present; there are too Crebillon's Let∣ters, and Amusemens sur le langage des Bêtes, said to be of one Bougeant, a Jesuit; they are both esteemed, and lately come out.

<P>WE have now been settled almost three weeks in this city, which is more considerable upon account of its size and antiquity, than from the number of its inhabitants, or any advantages of commerce. There is little in it worth a stranger's curiosity, besides the cathedral church, which is a vast Gothick building of a surprizing beauty and lightness, all co∣vered over with a profusion of little statues and other orna∣ments. It is here the Kings of France are crowned by the Archbishop of Rheims, who is the first Peer, and the Primate of the kingdom: The holy vessel made use of on that occa∣sion, which contains the oil, is kept in the church of St. Nica∣sius
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
hard by, and is believed to have been brought by an angel from heaven at the coronation of Clovis, the first christian king. The streets in general have but a melancholy aspect, the houses all old; the public walks run along the side of a great moat under the ramparts, where one hears a continual croaking of frogs; the country round about is one great plain covered with vines, which at this time of the year afford no very pleasing prospect, as being not above a foot high. What pleasures the place denies to the sight, it makes up to the palate; since you have nothing to drink but the best champaigne in the world, and all sort of provisions equally good. As to other pleasures, there is not that freedom of conversation among the people of fashion here, that one sees in other parts of France; for though they are not very numerous in this place, and consequent∣ly must live a good deal together, yet they never come to any great familiarity with one another. As my Lord Conway had spent a good part of his time among them, his brother, and we with him, were soon introduced into all their assemblies: As soon as you enter, the lady of the house presents each of you a card, and offers you a party at quadrille; you sit down, and play forty deals without intermission, excepting one quar∣ter of an hour, when every body rises to eat of what they call the gouter, which supplies the place of our tea, and is a service of wine, fruits, cream, sweetmeats, crawfish, and cheese. Peo∣ple take what they like, and sit down again to play; after that, they make little parties to go to the walks together, and then all the company retire to their separate habitations. Very seldom any suppers or dinners are given; and this is the manner they live among one another; not so much out of any aversion they have to pleasure, as out of a sort of formality they have con∣tracted
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
by not being much frequented by people who have lived at Paris. It is sure they do not hate gaiety any more than the rest of their country-people, and can enter into diversions, that are once proposed, with a good grace enough; for instance, the other evening we happened to be got together in a company of eighteen people, men and women of the best fashion here, at a garden in the town to walk; when one of the ladies bethought herself of asking, Why should not we sup here? Immediately the cloth was laid by the side of a fountain under the trees, and a very elegant supper served up; after which another said, Come, let us sing; and directly began herself: From singing we in∣sensibly fell to dancing, and singing in a round; when some∣body mentioned the violins, and immediately a company of them was ordered: Minuets were begun in the open air, and then came country-dances, which held till four o'Clock next morning; at which hour the gayest lady there proposed, that such as were weary should get into their coaches, and the rest of them should dance before them with the music in the van; and in this manner we paraded through all the principal streets of the city, and waked every body in it. Mr. Walpole had a mind to make a custom of the thing, and would have given a ball in the same manner next week, but the women did not come into it; so I believe it will drop, and they will return to their dull cards, and usual formalities. We are not to stay above a month longer here, and shall then go to Dijon, the chief city of Burgundy, a very splendid and a very gay town; at least such is the present design.</P>

<P>WE have made three short days journey of it from Rheims hither, where we arrived the night before last: The road we have passed through has been extremely agreeable; it runs through the most fertile part of Champaigne by the side of the river Marne, with a chain of hills on each hand at some distance, entirely covered with woods and vineyards, and every now and then the ruins of some old castle on their tops; we lay at St. Dizier the first night, and at Langres the second, and got hither the next evening time enough to have a full view of this city in entering it: It lies in a very extensive plain covered with vines and corn, and consequently is plentifully supplied with both. I need not tell you that it is the chief city of Bur∣gundy, nor that it is of great antiquity; considering which one should imagine it ought to be larger than one finds it. However, what it wants in extent, is made up in beauty and cleanliness, and in rich convents and churches, most of which we have seen. The palace of the States is a magnificent new building, where the Duke of Bourbon is lodged when he comes every three years to hold that Assembly, as governour of the Province. A quarter of a mile out of the town is a famous Abbey of Carthusians, which we are just returned from see∣ing. In their chapel are the tombs of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, that were so powerful, till at the death of Charles the Bold, the last of them, this part of his dominions was united by Lewis XI. to the crown of France. To-morrow we
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
are to pay a visit to the Abbot of the Cistercians, who lives a few leagues off, and who uses to receive all strangers with great civility; his Abbey is one of the richest in the king∣dom; he keeps open house always, and lives with great mag∣nificence. We have seen enough of this town already, to make us regret the time we spent at Rheims; it is full of people of condition, who seem to form a much more agreeable society than we found in Champaigne; but as we shall stay here but two or three days longer, it is not worth while to be introdu∣ced into their houses. On Monday or Tuesday we are to set out for Lyons, which is two days journey distant, and from thence you shall hear again from me.</P>

<P>SCavez vous bien, mon cher ami, que je vous hais, que je vous deteste? voila des termes un peu fortes; and that will save me, upon a just computation, a page of paper and six drops of ink; which, if I confined myself to reproaches of a more moderate nature, I should be obliged to employ in using you according to your deserts. What! to let any body reside three months at Rheims, and write but once to them?

Now because, I suppose, it will
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
give you pain to know we are in being, I take this opportu∣nity to tell you that we are at the ancient and celebrated Lugdunum, a city situated upon the confluence of the Rhône and Saône (Arar, I should say) two people, who though of tempers extremely unlike, think fit to join hands here, and make a little party to travel to the Mediterranean in company; the lady comes gliding along through the fruitful plains of Burgun∣dy, incredibili lenitate, ita ut oculis in utram partem fluit judi∣cari non possit; the gentleman runs all rough and roaring down from the mountains of Switzerland to meet her; and with all her soft airs she likes him never the worse; she goes through the middle of the city in state, and he passes incog. without the walls, but waits for her a little below. The houses here are so high, and the streets so narrow, as would be sufficient to render Lyons the dismallest place in the world, but the number of people, and the face of commerce diffused about it, are, at least, as sufficient to make it the liveliest: Between these two sufficiencies, you will be in doubt what to think of it; so we shall leave the city, and proceed to its environs, which are beautiful beyond expression; it is surrounded with mountains, and those mountains all bedroped and bespeckled with houses, gardens, and plantations of the rich Bourgeois, who have from thence a prospect of the city in the vale be∣low on one hand, on the other the rich plains of the Lyonnois, with the rivers winding among them, and the Alps, with the mountains of Dauphiné, to bound the view. All yesterday morning we were busied in climbing up Mount Fourviere, where the ancient city stood perched at such a height, that no∣thing but the hopes of gain could certainly ever persuade their neighbours to pay them a visit: Here are the ruins of the
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Emperor's palaces, that resided here, that is to say, Augustus and Severus; they consist in nothing but great masses of old wall, that have only their quality to make them respected. In a vineyard of the Minims are remains of a theatre; the Fathers, whom they belong to, hold them in no esteem at all, and would have showed us their sacristy and chapel instead of them: The Ursuline Nuns have in their garden some Roman baths, but we having the misfortune to be men, and heretics, they did not think proper to admit us. Hard by are eight arches of a most magnificent aqueduct, said to be erected by Antony, when his legions were quartered here: There are many other parts of it dispersed up and down the country, for it brought the water from a river many leagues off in La Forez. Here are remains too of Agrippa's seven great roads which met at Lyons; in some places they lie twelve feet deep in the ground: In short, a thou∣sand matters that you shall not know, till you give me a de∣scription of the Païs de Tombridge, and the effect its waters have upon you.</P>

<P>IF wishes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and sup with you to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix, while you are fluttering from city to city, and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford. It is out of the power of my heart to envy you your good for∣tune,

However, so long as I am not deprived of your correspondence, so long shall I always find some pleasure in being at home. And, setting all vain curiosity aside, when the fit is over, and my reason begins to come to herself, I have several other power∣ful motives which might easily cure me of my restless inclina∣tions: Amongst these, my Mother's ill state of health is not the least; which was the reason of our going to Tunbridge, so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence. Nor indeed is there much room for either; for all diversions there may be reduced to two articles, gaming and going to church. They were pleased to publish certain Tun∣brigiana this season; but such ana! I believe there were never so many vile little verses put together before. So much for Tunbridge: London affords me as little to say. What! so huge a town as London? Yes, consider only how I live in that town. I never go into the gay world or high world, and con∣sequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my imagina∣tion. The busy world I leave to the busy; and am resolved never to talk politics till I can act at the same time. To tell old stories, or prate of old books, seems a little musty; and toujours Chapon bouilli, won't do.

<P>IT is now almost five weeks since I left Dijon, one of the gayest and most agreeable little cities of France, for Lyons, its reverse in all these particulars. It is the second in the king∣dom in bigness and rank, the streets excessively narrow and nasty; the houses immensely high and large; (that, for in∣stance, where we are lodged, has twenty-five rooms on a floor, and that for five stories) it swarms with inhabitants like Paris itself, but chiefly a mercantile people, too much given up to commerce to think of their own, much less of a stranger's diversions. We have no acquaintance in the town, but such English as happen to be passing through here, in their way to Italy and the South, which at present happen to be near thirty in number. It is a fortnight since we set out from hence upon a little excursion to Geneva. We took the longest road, which lies through Savoy, on purpose to see a famous monastery, called the grand Chartreuse, and had no reason to think our time lost. After having travelled seven days very slow (for we
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
did not change horses, it being impossible for a chaise to go post in these roads) we arrived at a little village, among the moun∣tains of Savoy, called Echelles; from thence we proceeded on horses, who are used to the way, to the mountain of the Chartreuse: It is six miles to the top; the road runs winding up it, commonly not six feet broad; on one hand is the rock, with woods of pine-trees hanging over head; on the other, a mon∣strous precipice, almost perpendicular, at the bottom of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone that have fallen from on high, and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise like thunder, which is still made greater by the echo from the mountains on each side, con∣curs to form one of the most solemn, the most romantic, and the most astonishing scenes I ever beheld: Add to this the strange views made by the craggs and cliffs on the other hand; the cascades that in many places throw themselves from the very summit down into the vale, and the river below; and many other particulars impossible to describe; you will con∣clude we had no occasion to repent our pains. This place St. Bruno chose to retire to, and upon its very top founded the aforesaid Convent, which is the superior of the whole order. When we came there, the two fathers, who are commissioned to entertain strangers, (for the rest must neither speak one to another, nor to any one else) received us very kindly; and set be∣fore us a repast of dried fish, eggs, butter, and fruits, all ex∣cellent in their kind, and extremely neat. They pressed us to spend the night there, and to stay some days with them; but this we could not do, so they led us about their house, which is, you must think, like a little city; for there are 100 fathers, besides 300 servants, that make their clothes, grind their corn,
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
press their wine, and do every thing among themselves: The whole is quite orderly and simple; nothing of finery, but the wonderful decency, and the strange situation, more than sup∣ply the place of it. In the evening we descended by the same way, passing through many clouds that were then forming themselves on the mountain's side. Next day we continued our journey by Chamberry, which, though the chief city of the Dutchy, and residence of the king of Sardinia, when he comes into this part of his dominions, makes but a very mean and insignificant appearance; we lay at Aix, once famous for its hot baths, and the next night at Annecy; the day after, by noon, we got to Geneva. I have not time to say any thing about it, nor of our solitary journey back again. ***</P>

<P>IN my last I gave you the particulars of our little journey to Geneva; I have only to add, that we stayed about a week, in order to see Mr. Conway settled there: I do not wonder so many English choose it for their residence; the city is very small, neat, prettily built, and extremely populous; the Rhône runs through the middle of it, and it is surrounded with new fortifications, that give it a military compact air; which, joined to the happy, lively countenances of the inhabitants, and an exact discipline always as strictly observed as in time of war, makes the little republic appear a match for a much greater
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
power; though perhaps Geneva, and all that belongs to it, are not of equal extent with Windsor and its two parks. To one that has passed through Savoy, as we did, nothing can be more striking than the contrast, as soon as he approaches the town. Near the gates of Geneva runs the torrent Arve, which sepa∣rates it from the King of Sardinia's dominions; on the other side of it lies a country naturally, indeed, fine and fertile; but you meet with nothing in it but meager, ragged, bare-footed peasants, with their children, in extreme misery and nastiness; and even of these no great numbers: You no sooner have crossed the stream I have mentioned, but poverty is no more; not a beggar, hardly a discontented face to be seen; numerous, and well-dressed people swarming on the ramparts; drums beat∣ing; soldiers, well-cloathed and armed, exercising; and folks, with business in their looks, hurrying to and fro; all contribute to make any person, who is not blind, sensible what a difference there is between the two governments, that are the causes of one view and the other. The beautiful lake, at one end of which the town is situated; its extent; the several states that border upon it; and all its pleasures, are too well known for me to mention them. We sailed upon it as far as the domi∣nions of Geneva extend, that is, about two leagues and a half on each side; and landed at several of the little houses of plea∣sure, that the inhabitants have built all about it, who received us with much politeness. The same night we eat part of a trout, taken in the lake, that weighed thirty-seven pounds; as great a monster as it appeared to us, it was esteemed there no∣thing extraordinary, and they assured us, it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds; they are dressed here, and sent post to Paris upon some great occasions; nay, even to Madrid,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
as we were told. The road we returned through was not the same we came by: We crossed the Rhône at Seyssel, and passed for three days among the mountains of Bugey, without meet∣ing with any thing new: At last we came out into the plains of La Bresse, and so to Lyons again. Sir Robert has written to Mr. Walpole, to desire he would go to Italy; which he has resolved to do; so that all the scheme of spending the winter in the South of France is laid aside, and we are to pass it in a much finer country. You may imagine I am not sorry to have this opportunity of seeing the place in the world that best de∣serves it: Besides as the Pope (who is eighty-eight, and has been lately at the point of death) cannot probably last a great while, perhaps we may have the fortune to be present at the election of a new one, when Rome will be in all its glory. Friday next we certainly begin our journey; in two days we shall come to the foot of the Alps, and six more we shall be in passing them. Even here the winter is begun; what then must it be among those vast snowy mountains where it is hardly ever summer? We are, however, as well armed as possible against the cold, with muffs, hoods, and masks of bever, fur-boots, and bear skins. When we arrive at Turin, we shall rest after the fatigues of the journey. ***</P>

<P>I AM this night arrived here, and have just set down to rest me after eight days tiresome journey: For the three first we had the same road we before past through to go to Geneva; the fourth we turned out of it, and for that day and the next travelled rather among than upon the Alps; the way commonly running through a deep valley by the side of the river Arc, which works itself a passage, with great difficulty and a mighty noise, among vast quantities of rocks, that have rolled down from the mountain tops. The winter was so far advanced, as in great measure to spoil the beauty of the prospect; however, there was still somewhat fine remaining amidst the savageness and horrour of the place: The sixth we began to go up several of these mountains; and as we were passing one, met with an odd accident enough: Mr. Walpole had a little fat black spaniel, that he was very fond of, which he sometimes used to set down, and let it run by the chaise side. We were at that time in a very rough road, not two yards broad at most; on one side was a great wood of pines, and on the other a vast precipice; it was noon-day, and the sun shone bright, when all of a sudden, from the wood-side, (which was as steep upwards, as the other part was downwards) out rushed a great wolf, came close to the head of the horses, seized the dog by the throat, and rushed up the hill again with him in his mouth. This was done in less than a quarter of a minute; we all saw it, and yet the servants had not time to draw their pistols, or do any thing to
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
save the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This odd incident might have afforded Mr. Gray a subject for an ode, which would have been a good companion to that on the death of a favourite cat.</NOTE>. If he had not been there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the horses; chaise, and we, and all must inevitably have tumbled above fifty fathoms per∣pendicular down the precipice. The seventh we came to Lanebourg, the last town in Savoy; it lies at the foot of the famous mount Cenis, which is so situated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of it. Here the chaise was forced to be pulled to pieces, and the baggage and that to be carried by mules: We ourselves were wrapped up in our furs, and seated upon a sort of matted chair without legs, which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier, and so begun to ascend by the help of eight men. It was six miles to the top, where a plain opens itself about as many more in breadth, covered perpetually with very deep snow, and in the midst of that a great lake of unfathomable depth, from whence a river takes its rise, and tumbles over monstrous rocks quite down the other side of the mountain. The descent is six miles more, but infinitely more steep than the going up; and here the men perfectly fly down with you, stepping from stone to stone with incredible swiftness in places where none but they could go three paces without falling. The immensity of the preci∣pices, the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it, the huge craggs covered with ice and snow, and the clouds below you and about you, are objects it is impossible to conceive with∣out seeing them; and though we had heard many strange de∣scriptions of the scene, none of them at all came up to it. We were but five hours in performing the whole, from which you may judge of the rapidity of the men's motion. We are now
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
got into Piedmont, and stopped a little while at La Ferriere, a small village about three quarters of the way down, but still among the clouds, where we began to hear a new language spoken round about us; at last we got quite down, went through the Pás de Suse, a narrow road among the Alps, defended by two for∣tresses, and lay at Bossolens: Next evening thro' a fine avenue of nine miles in length, as straight as a line, we arrived at this city, which, as you know, is the capital of the Principality, and the residence of the King of Sardinia.<NOTE N="***" PLACE="foot">That part of the letter here omitted, contained only a description of the city; which, as Mr. Gray has given it to Mr. West in the following letter, and that in a more lively manner, I thought it unnecessary to insert.

<P>AFTER eight days journey through Greenland, we ar∣rived at Turin. You approach it by a handsome avenue of nine miles long, and quite strait. The entrance is guarded by certain vigilant dragons, called Douäniers, who mumbled us for some time. The city is not large, as being a place of strength, and consequently confined within its fortifications; it has many beauties and some faults; among the first are streets
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
all laid out by the line, regular uniform buildings, fine walks that surround the whole, and in general a good lively clean ap∣pearance: But the houses are of brick plaistered, which is apt to want repairing; the windows of oiled paper, which is apt to be torn; and every thing very slight, which is apt to tumble down. There is an excellent Opera, but it is only in the Car∣nival: Balls every night, but only in the Carnival: Masque∣rades too, but only in the Carnival. This Carnival lasts only from Christmas to Lent; one half of the remaining part of the year is past in remembering the last, the other in expecting the future Carnival. We cannot well subsist upon such slender diet, no more than upon an execrable Italian Comedy, and a Puppet-Show, called Rappresentazione d'un' anima dannata, which, I think, are all the present diversions of the place; ex∣cept the Marquise de Cavaillac's Conversazione, where one goes to see people play at Ombre and Taroc, a game with 72 cards all painted with suns, and moons, and devils and monks. Mr. Walpole has been at court; the family are at present at a country palace, called La Venerie. The palace here in town is the very quintessence of gilding and looking-glass; inlaid floors, carved pannels, and painting, wherever they could stick a brush. I own I have not, as yet, any where met with those grand and simple works of Art, that are to amaze one, and whose sight one is to be the better for: But those of Nature have astonished me beyond expression. In our little journey up to the Grande Chartreuse, I do not remember to have gone ten paces without an exclamation, that there was no restraining: Not a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry. There are certain scenes that would awe an atheist into belief, without the help of other argument. One need
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
not have a very fantastic imagination to see spirits there at noon∣day: You have Death perpetually before your eyes, only so far removed, as to compose the mind without frighting it. I am well persuaded St. Bruno was a man of no common genius, to choose such a situation for his retirement; and perhaps should have been a disciple of his, had I been born in his time. You may believe Abelard and Heloïse were not forgot upon this oc∣casion: If I do not mistake, I saw you too every now and then at a distance among the trees; il me semble, que j'ai vu ce chien de visage là quelque part. You seemed to call to me from the other side of the precipice, but the noise of the river below was so great, that I really could not distinguish what you said; it seemed to have a cadence like verse. In your next you will be so good to let me know what it was. The week we have since passed among the Alps, has not equalled the single day upon that mountain, because the winter was rather too far advanced, and the weather a little foggy. However, it did not want its beauties; the savage rudeness of the view is incon∣ceivable without seeing it: I reckoned, in one day, thirteen cascades, the least of which was, I dare say, one hundred feet in height. I had Livy in the chaise with me, and beheld his <Q REND="inline">"Nives coelo propè immistae, tecta informia imposita rupi∣bus, pecora jumentaque torrida frigore, homines intonsi &amp; inculti, animalia inanimaque omnia rigentia gelu; omnia con∣fragosa, praeruptaque."</Q> The creatures that inhabit them are, in all respects, below humanity; and most of them, especially women, have the tumidum guttur, which they call goscia. Mont Cenis, I confess, carries the permission mountains have of being frightful rather too far; and its horrours were ac∣companied with too much danger to give one time to reflect
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
upon their beauties. There is a family of the Alpine monsters I have mentioned, upon its very top, that in the middle of winter calmly lay in their stock of provisions and firing, and so are buried in their hut for a month or two under the snow. When we were down it, and got a little way into Piedmont, we began to find <Q REND="inline">"Apricos quosdam colles, rivosque prope syl∣vas, et jam humano cultu digniora loca."</Q> I read Silius Italicus too, for the first time; and wished for you, according to custom.

This is the first coup d'oeil, and is almost all I am yet able to give
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
you an account of, for we arrived late last night. To-day was, luckily, a great festival, and in the morning we resorted to the church of the Madonna delle Vigne, to put up our little ori∣sons; (I believe I forgot to tell you, that we have been some∣time converts to the holy Catholic church) we found our Lady richly dressed out, with a crown of diamonds on her own head, another upon the child's, and a constellation of wax lights burning before them: Shortly after came the Doge, in his robes of crimson damask, and a cap of the same, followed by the Senate in black. Upon his approach began a fine concert of music, and among the rest two eunuchs' voices, that were a perfect feast to ears that had heard nothing but French operas for a year. We listened to this, and breathed nothing but in∣cense for two hours. The Doge is a very tall, lean, stately, old figure, called Costantino Balbi; and the Senate seem to have been made upon the same model. They said their prayers, and heard an absurd white friar preach, with equal devotion. After this we went to the Annonciata, a church built by the family Lomellini, and belonging to it; which is, indeed, a most stately structure, the inside wholly marble of various kinds, ex∣cept where gold and painting take its place. From hence to the Palazzo Doria. I should make you sick of marble, if I told you how it was lavished here upon the porticoes, the balustrades, and terrases, the lowest of which extends quite to the sea. The inside is by no means answerable to the outward magnificence; the furniture seems to be as old as the founder of the family. There great imbossed silver tables tell you, in bas-relief, his victories at sea; how he entertained the Emperor Charles, and how he refused the sovereignty of the Commonwealth when it was offered him; the rest is old-fashioned velvet chairs, and
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
gothic tapestry. The rest of the day has been spent, much to our hearts' content, in cursing French music and architecture, and in singing the praises of Italy. We find this place so very fine, that we are in fear of finding nothing finer. We are fallen in love with the Mediterranean sea, and hold your lakes and your rivers in vast contempt. This is <Q REND="inline">" The happy country where huge lemons grow,"</Q> as Waller says; and I am sorry to think of leaving it in a week for Parma, although it be<Q>The happy country where huge cheeses grow.</Q></P>

<P>OUR journey hither has taken up much less time than I expected. We left Genoa (a charming place, and one that deserved a longer stay) the week before last; crossed the mountains, and lay that night at Tortona, the next at St. Giovan∣ni, and the morning after came to Piacenza. That city, (though the capital of a Dutchy) made so frippery an appearance, that instead of spending some days there, as had been intended, we only dined, and went on to Parma; stayed there all the fol∣lowing day, which was passed in visiting the famous works of Corregio in the Dome, and other churches. The fine gallery of pictures, that once belonged to the Dukes of Parma, is no more here; the King of Naples has carried it all thither, and the city had not merit enough to detain us any longer, so we proceeded
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
through Reggio to Modena; this, though the residence of its Duke, is an ill-built melancholy place, all of brick, as are most of the towns in this part of Lombardy: He himself lives in a private manner, with very little appearance of a court about him; he has one of the noblest collections of paintings in the world, which entertained us extremely well the rest of that day and a part of the next; and in the afternoon we came to Bologna: So now you may wish us joy of being in the domi∣nions of his Holiness. This is a populous city, and of great extent: All the streets have porticoes on both sides, such as sur∣round a part of Covent-Garden, a great relief in summer-time in such a climate; and from one of the principal gates to a church of the Virgin, [where is a wonder-working picture, at three miles distance] runs a corridore of the same sort, lately finished, and, indeed, a most extraordinary performance. The churches here are more remarkable for their paintings than architecture, being mostly old structures of brick; but the palaces are numerous, and fine enough to supply us with some∣what worth seeing from morning till night. The country of Lombardy, hitherto, is one of the most beautiful imaginable; the roads broad, and exactly straight, and on either hand vast plantations of trees, chiefly mulberries and olives, and not a tree without a vine twining about it and spreading among its branches. This scene, indeed, which must be the most lovely in the world during the proper season, is at present all deform∣ed by the winter, which here is rigorous enough for the time it lasts; but one still sees the skeleton of a charming place, and reaps the benefit of its product, for the fruits and provisions are admirable; in short you find every thing, that luxury can desire, in perfection. We have now been here a week, and
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
shall stay some little time longer. We are at the foot of the Apennine mountains; it will take up three days to cross them, and then we shall come to Florence, where we shall pass the Christ∣mas. Till then we must remain in a state of ignorance as to what is doing in England, for our letters are to meet us there: If I do not find four or five from you alone, I shall wonder.</P>

<P>WE spent twelve days at Bologna, chiefly (as most travellers do) in seeing sights; for as we knew no mortal there, and as it is no easy matter to get admission into any Italian house, without very particular recommendations, we could see no com∣pany but in public places; and there are none in that city but the churches. We saw, therefore, churches, palaces, and pictures from morning to night; and the 15th of this month set out for Florence, and began to cross the Apennine mountains; we tra∣velled among and upon them all that day, and, as it was but in∣different weather, were commonly in the middle of thick clouds, that utterly deprived us of a sight of their beauties: For this vast chain of hills has its beauties, and all the vallies are culti∣vated; even the mountains themselves are many of them so within a little of their very tops. They are not so horrid as the Alps, though pretty near as high; and the whole road is admirably well kept, and paved throughout, which is a length of fourscore miles, and more: We left the Pope's dominions,
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
and lay that night in those of the Grand Duke at Fiorenzuola, a paltry little town, at the foot of Mount Giogo, which is the highest of them all. Next morning we went up it; the post∣house is upon its very top, and usually involved in clouds, or half-buried in the snow. Indeed there was none of the last at the time we were there, but it was still a dismal habitation. The descent is most excessively steep, and the turnings very short and frequent; however, we performed it without any danger, and in coming down could dimly discover Florence, and the beautiful plain about it, through the mists; but enough to convince us, it must be one of the noblest prospects upon earth in summer. That afternoon we got thither; and Mr. Mann<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Sir Horace Mann, and Envoy Extraordinary at the same court.</NOTE>, the resident, had sent his servant to meet us at the gates, and conduct us to his house. He is the best and most obliging person in the world. The next night we were introduced at the Prince of Craon's assembly (he has the chief power here in the Grand Duke's absence). The Princess, and he, were extremely civil to the name of Walpole, so we were asked to stay supper, which is as much as to say, you may come and sup here whenever you please; for after the first invitation this is always understood. We have also been at the Countess Suarez's, a favourite of the late Duke, and one that gives the first movement to every thing gay that is going forward here. The news is every day expected from Vienna of the Great Dutchess's delivery; if it be a boy, here will be all sorts of balls, masquerades, operas, and illuminations; if not, we must wait for the Carnival, when all those things come of course. In the mean time it is impossible to want enter∣tainment;
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
the famous gallery, alone, is an amusement for months; we commonly pass two or three hours every morning in it, and one has perfect leisure to consider all its beauties. You know it contains many hundred antique statues, such as the whole world cannot match, besides the vast collection of paint∣ings, medals, and precious stones, such as no other prince was ever master of; in short, all that the rich and powerful house of Medicis has in so many years got togéther.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He catalogued and made occasional short remarks on the pictures, &amp;c. which he saw here, as well as at other places, many of which are in my possession, but it would have swelled this work too much if I had inserted them.</NOTE> And besides this city abounds with so many palaces and churches, that you can hardly place yourself any where without having some fine one in view, or at least some statue or fountain, magnificently adorned; these, undoubtedly, are far more nu∣merous than Genoa can pretend to; yet, in its general appear∣ance, I cannot think that Florence equals it in beauty. Mr. Walpole is just come from being presented to the Electress Palatine Dowager; she is a sister of the late Great Duke's; a stately old lady, that never goes out but to church, and then she has guards, and eight horses to her coach. She received him with much ceremony, standing under a huge black canopy, and, after a few minutes talking, she assured him of her good will, and dismissed him: She never sees any body but thus in form; and so she passes her life, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Persons of very high rank, and withal very good sense, will only feel the pathos of this exclamation.</NOTE>poor woman! ***</P>

The Conclave is still sitting there, and likely to continue so some time longer, as the two French Cardinals are but just arrived, and the German ones are still expected.

I have nothing new or particular to inform you of; and, if you see things at home go on much in their old course, you must not imagine them more various abroad. The diver∣sions of a Florentine Lent are composed of a sermon in the morning, full of hell and the devil; a dinner at noon, full of fish and meager diet; and, in the evening, what is called a Conversazione, a sort of assembly at the principal peo∣ple's houses, full of I cannot tell what: Besides this, there is twice a week a very grand concert. ***</P>

<P>THIS is the third day since we came to Rome, but the first hour I have had to write to you in. The journey from Florence cost us four days, one of which was spent at Sienna, an agreeable, clean, old city, of no great magnificence, or extent; but in a fine situation, and good air. What it has most considerable is its cathedral, a huge pile of marble, black and white laid alternately, and laboured with a gothic niceness
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
and delicacy in the old-fashioned way. Within too are some paintings and sculpture of considerable hands. The sight of this, and some collections that were showed us in private houses, were a sufficient employment for the little time we were to pass there; and the next morning we set forward on our journey through a country very oddly composed; for some miles you have a continual scene of little mountains cultivated from top to bottom with rows of olive-trees, or else elms, each of which has its vine twining about it, and mixing with the branches; and corn sown between all the ranks. This, diver∣sified with numerous small houses and convents, makes the most agreeable prospect in the world: But, all of a sudden, it alters to black barren hills, as far as the eye can reach, that seem never to have been capable of culture, and are as ugly as useless. Such is the country for some time before one comes to Mount Radicofani, a terrible black hill, on the top of which we were to lodge that night. It is very high, and difficult of ascent; and at the foot of it we were much embarrassed by the fall of one of the poor horses that drew us. This accident obliged another chaise, which was coming down, to stop also; and out of it peeped a figure in a red cloak, with a handkerchief tied round its head, which, by its voice and mien, seemed a fat old woman; but, upon its getting out, appeared to be Senesino, who was returning from Naples to Sienna, the place of his birth and residence. On the highest part of the mountain is an old fortress, and near it a house built by one of the Grand Dukes for a hunting-seat, but now converted into an inn: It is the shell of a large fabrick, but such an inside, such cham∣bers, and accommodations, that your cellar is a palace in com∣parison; and your cat sups and lies much better than we did;
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
for, it being a saint's eve, there were nothing but eggs. We devoured our meager fare; and, after stopping up the windows with the quilts, were obliged to lie upon the straw beds in our clothes. Such are the conveniences in a road, that is, as it were, the great thoroughfare of all the world. Just on the other side of this mountain, at Ponte-Centino, one enters the patrimony of the church; a most delicious country, but thinly inhabited. That night brought us to Viterbo, a city of a more lively appearance than any we had lately met with; the houses have glass windows, which is not very usual here, and most of the streets are terminated by a handsome fountain. Here we had the pleasure of breaking our fast on the leg of an old hare and some broiled crows. Next morning, in descending Mount Viterbo, we first discovered (though at near thirty miles distance) the cupola of St. Peter's, and a little after began to enter on an old Roman pavement, with now and then a ruined tower, or a sepulcher on each hand. We now had a clear view of the city, though not to the best advantage, as coming along a plain quite upon a level with it; however, it appeared very vast, and surrounded with magnificent villas and gardens. We soon after crossed the Tiber, a river that ancient Rome made more considerable than any merit of its own could have done: However, it is not contemptibly small, but a good hand∣some stream; very deep, yet somewhat of a muddy complex∣ion. The first entrance of Rome is prodigiously striking. It is by a noble gate, designed by Michel Angelo, and adorned with statues; this brings you into a large square, in the midst of which is a vast obelisk of granite, and in front you have at one view two churches of a handsome architecture, and so much alike that they are called the twins; with three streets, the mid∣dlemost
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
of which is one of the longest in Rome. As high as my expectation was raised, I confess, the magnificence of this city infinitely surpasses it. You cannot pass along a street but you have views of some palace, or church, or square, or foun∣tain, the most picturesque and noble one can imagine. We have not yet set about considering its beauties, ancient and modern, with attention; but have already taken a slight transient view of some of the most remarkable. St. Peter's I saw the day after we arrived, and was struck dumb with wonder. I there saw the Cardinal d'Auvergne, one of the French ones, who, upon coming off his journey, immediately repaired hither to offer up his vows at the high altar, and went directly into the Con∣clave; the doors of which we saw opened to him, and all the other immured Cardinals came thither to receive him. Upon his entrance they were closed again directly. It is sup∣posed they will not come to an agreement about a Pope till after Easter, though the confinement is very disagreeable. I have hardly philosophy enough to see the infinity of fine things, that are here daily in the power of any body that has money, without regretting the want of it; but custom has the power of making things easy to one. I have not yet seen his majesty of Great-Britain, &amp;c. though I have the two boys in the gar∣dens of the Villa Borgese, where they go a-shooting almost every day; it was at a distance, indeed, for we did not choose to meet them, as you may imagine. This letter (like all those the English send, or receive) will pass through the hands of that family, before it comes to those it was intended for. They do it more honour than it deserves; and all they will learn from thence will be, that I desire you to give my duty to my father, and wherever else it is due, and that I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>TO-DAY I am just come from paying my adoration at St. Peter's to three extraordinary reliques, which are exposed to public view only on these two days in the whole year, at which time all the confraternities in the city come in procession to see them. It was something extremely novel to see that vast church, and the most magnificent in the world, undoubtedly, illuminated (for it was night) by thousands of little crystal lamps, disposed in the figure of a huge cross at the high altar, and seeming to hang alone in the air. All the light proceeded from this, and had the most singular effect imaginable as one entered the great door. Soon after came one after ano∣ther, I believe, thirty processions, all dressed in linen frocks, and girt with a cord, their heads covered with a cowl all over, only two holes to see through left. Some of them were all black, others red, others white, others party-coloured; these were continually coming and going with their tapers and cruci∣fixes before them; and to each company, as they arrived and knelt before the great altar, were shown from a balcony at a great height, the three wonders, which are, you must know, the head of the spear that wounded Christ; St. Veronica's hand∣kerchief, with the miraculous impression of his face upon it; and a piece of the true cross, on the sight of which the people thump their breasts, and kiss the pavement with vast devotion. The tragical part of the ceremony is half a dozen wretched

creatures, who with their faces covered, but naked to the waist, are in a side-chapel disciplining themselves with scourges full of iron prickles; but really in earnest, as our eyes can testify, which saw their backs and arms so raw we should have taken it for a red sattin doublet torn, and shewing the skin through, had we not been convinced of the contrary by the blood which was plentifully sprinkled about them. It is late; I give you joy of Porto Bello, and many other things, which I hope are all true. ****</P>

<P>THIS day being in the palace of his Highness the Duke of Modena, he laid his most serene commands upon me to write to Mr. West, and said he thought it for his glory, that I should draw up an inventory of all his most serene possessions for the said West's perusal.—Imprimis, a house, being in circum∣ference a quarter of a mile, two feet and an inch; the said house containing the following particulars, to wit, a great room. Item, another great room; item, a bigger room; item, another room; item, a vast room; item, a sixth of the same; a se∣venth ditto; an eighth as before; a ninth as abovesaid; a tenth (see N<SUP>o</SUP>. 1); item, ten more such, besides twenty besides, which, not to be too particular, we shall pass over. The said rooms contain nine chairs, two tables, five stools, and a cricket. From whence we shall proceed to the garden, containing two millions
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
of superfine laurel hedges, a clump of cypress trees, and half the river Teverone, that pisses into two thousand several chamber∣pots. Finis.—Dame Nature desired me to put in a list of her little goods and chattels, and, as they were small, to be very minute about them. She has built here three or four little mountains, and laid them out in an irregular semi-circle; from certain others behind, at a greater distance, she has drawn a canal, into which she has put a little river of her's, called Anio; she has cut a huge cleft between the two innermost of her four hills, and there she has left it to its own disposal; which she has no sooner done, but, like a heedless chit, it tumbles headlong down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular, breaks itself all to shatters, and is converted into a shower of rain, where the sun forms many a bow, red, green, blue and yellow. To get out of our metaphors without any further trouble, it is the most noble sight in the world. The weight of that quantity of waters, and the force they fall with, have worn the rocks they throw themselves among into a thousand irregular craggs, and to a vast depth. In this channel it goes boiling along with a mighty noise till it comes to another steep, where you see it a second time come roaring down (but first you must walk two miles farther) a greater height than before, but not with that quantity of waters; for by this time it has divided itself, being crossed and opposed by the rocks, into four several streams, each of which, in emulation of the great one, will tumble down too; and it does tumble down, but not from an equally elevated place; so that you have at one view all these cascades intermix∣ed with groves of olive and little woods, the mountains rising behind them, and on the top of one (that which forms the extre∣mity of one of the half-circle's horns) is seated the town itself.
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
At the very extremity of that extremity, on the brink of the precipice, stands the Sybils' temple, the remains of a little rotunda, surrounded with its portico, above half of whose beau∣tiful Corinthian pillars are still standing and entire; all this on one hand. On the other, the open Campagna of Rome, here and there a little castle on a hillock, and the city itself on the very brink of the horizon, indistinctly seen (being 18 miles off) except the dome of St. Peter's; which, if you look out of your window, wherever you are, I suppose, you can see. I did not tell you that a little below the first fall, on the side of the rock, and hanging over that torrent, are little ruins which they show you for Horace's house, a curious situation to observe the
<Q><L>" Praeceps Anio, &amp; Tiburni lucus, &amp; uda</L>
<L>" Mobilibus pomaria rivis."</L></Q>
Maecenas did not care for such a noise, it seems, and built him a house (which they also carry one to see) so situated that it sees nothing at all of the matter, and for any thing he knew there might be no such river in the world. Horace had another house on the other side of the Teverone, opposite to Maecenas's; and they told us there was a bridge of communication, by which <Q REND="inline">"andava il detto Signor per trastullarsi coll istesso Orazio."</Q> In coming hither we crossed the Aquae Albulae, a vile little brook that stinks like a fury, and they say it has stunk so these thousand years. I forgot the Piscina of Quintilius Varus, where he used to keep certain little fishes. This is very entire, and there is a piece of the aqueduct that supplied it too; in the gar∣den below is old Rome, built in little, just as it was, they say. There are seven temples in it, and no houses at all: They say there were none.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89"/>
<HI>May</HI> 21.</P>
<P>We have had the pleasure of going twelve miles out of our way to Palestrina. It has rained all day as if heaven and us were coming together. See my honesty, I do not mention a syllable of the temple of Fortune, because I really did not see it; which, I think, is pretty well for an old traveller. So we returned along the Via Praenestina, saw the Lacus Gabinus and Regillus, where, you know, Castor and Pollux appeared upon a certain occasion. And many a good old tomb we left on each hand, and many an Aqueduct,</P>
<P>Dumb are whose fountains, and their channels dry.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, two whole modern ones, works of Popes, that run about thirty miles a-piece in length; one of them con∣veys still the famous Aqua Virgo to Rome, and adds vast beauty to the prospect. So we came to Rome again, where waited for us a splendidissimo regalo of letters; in one of which came You, with your huge characters and wide intervals, sta∣ring. I would have you to know, I expect you should take a handsome crow-quill when you write to me, and not leave room for a pin's point in four sides of a sheet royal. Do you but find matter, I will find spectacles.</P>
<P>I have more time than I thought, and I will employ it in telling you about a Ball that we were at the other evening. Figure to yourself a Roman villa; all its little apartments thrown open, and lighted up to the best advantage. At the upper end of the gallery, a fine concert, in which La Dia∣mantina, a famous virtuosa, played on the violin divinely, and sung angelically; Giovannino and Pasqualini (great names in musical story) also performed miraculously. On each side were
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
ranged all the secular grand monde of Rome, the Ambassa∣dors, Princesses, and all that. Among the rest Il Serenissimo Pretendente (as the Mantova gazette calls him) displayed his rueful length of person, with his two young ones, and all his ministry around him. <Q REND="inline">"Poi nacque un grazioso ballo,"</Q> where the world danced, and I sat in a corner regaling myself with iced fruits, and other pleasant rinfrescatives.</P>

<P>I am to day just returned from Alba, a good deal fatigued; for you know the Appian is somewhat tiresome.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However whimsical this humour may appear to some readers, I chose to in∣sert it, as it gives me an opportunity of remarking that Mr. Gray was extreamly skilled in the customs of the ancient Romans; and has catalogued, in his common place book, their various eatables, wines, perfumes, cloaths, medicines, &amp;c. with great precision, referring under every article to passages in the Poets and Histo∣rians where their names are mentioned.</NOTE> We dined at
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
Pompey's; he indeed was gone for a few days to his Tusculan, but, by the care of his Villicus, we made an admirable meal. We had the dugs of a pregnant sow, a peacock, a dish of thrushes, a noble scarus just fresh from the Tyrrhene, and some conchylia of the Lake with garum sauce: For my part I never eat better at Lucullus's table. We drank half a dozen cyathi a-piece of ancient Alban to Pholoë's health; and, after bathing, and playing an hour at ball, we mounted our essedum again, and proceeded up the mount to the temple. The priests there entertained us with an account of a wonderful shower of birds eggs, that had fallen two days before, which had no sooner touched the ground, but they were converted into gud∣geons; as also that the night past a dreadful voice had been heard out of the Adytum, which spoke Greek during a full half hour, but no body understood it. But quitting my Romanities, to your great joy and mine, let me tell you, in plain English, that we come from Albano. The present town lies within the inclosure of Pompey's Villa in ruins. The Appian way runs through it, by the side of which, a little far∣ther, is a large old tomb, with five pyramids upon it, which the learned suppose to be the burying-place of the family, be∣cause they do not know whose it can be else. But the vulgar assure you it is the sepulchre of the Curiatii, and by that name (such is their power) it goes. One drives to Castel Gondolfo, a house of the Pope's, situated on the top of one of the Colli∣nette, that forms a brim to the bason, commonly called the
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
Alban lake. It is seven miles round; and directly opposite-to you, on the other side, rises the Mons Albanus, much taller than the rest, along whose side are still discoverable (not to common eyes) certain little ruins of the old Alba longa. They had need be very little, as having been nothing but ruins ever since the days of Tullus Hostilius. On its top is a house of the Constable Collona's, where stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis. At the foot of the hill Gondolfo, are the famous outlets of the lake, built with hewn stone, a mile and a half under ground. Livy, you know, amply informs us of the foolish occasion of this expence, and gives me this opportunity of displaying all my erudition, that I may appear considerable in your eyes. This is the prospect from one window of the palace. From another you have the whole Campagna, the City, Antium, and the Tyrrene sea (twelve miles distant) so distinguishable, that you may see the vessels sailing upon it. All this is charming. Mr. Walpole says, our memory sees more than our eyes in this country. Which is extremely true; since, for realities, Windsor, or Richmond Hill, is infinitely prefer∣able to Albano or Frescati. I am now at home, and going to the window to tell you it is the most beautiful of Italian nights, which, in truth, are but just begun (so backward has the spring been here, and every where else, they say). There is a moon! there are stars for you! Do not you hear the foun∣tain? Do not you smell the orange flowers? That building yonder is the Convent of S. Isidore; and that eminence, with the cypress trees and pines upon it, the top of M. Quirinal. This is all true, and yet my prospect is not two hundred yards in length. We send you some Roman inscriptions to entertain

<P>OUR journey hither was through the most beautiful part of the finest country in the world; and every spot of it, on some account or other, famous for these three thousand years past<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray writ a minute description of every thing he saw in this tour from Rome to Naples; as also of the environs of Rome, Florence, &amp;c. But as these papers are apparently only memorandums for his own use, I do not think it neces∣sary to print them, although they abound with many uncommon remarks, and pertinent classical quotations. The reader will please to observe throughout this section, that it is not my intention to give him Mr. Gray's Travels, but only ex∣tracts from the Letters which he writ during his travels.</NOTE>. The season has hitherto been just as warm as one would wish it; no unwholesome airs, or violent heats, yet heard of: The people call it a backward year, and are in pain about their corn, wine, and oil; but we, who are neither corn, wine, nor oil,
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
find it very agreeable. Our road was through Velletri, Cister∣na, Terracina, Capua, and Aversa, and so to Naples. The minute one leaves his Holiness's dominions, the face of things begins to change from wide uncultivated plains to olive groves and well∣tilled fields of corn, intermixed with ranks of elms, every one of which has its vine twining about it, and hanging in festoons be∣tween the rows from one tree to another. The great old fig∣trees, the oranges in full bloom, and myrtles in every hedge, make one of the delightfullest scenes you can conceive; besides that, the roads are wide, well-kept, and full of passengers, a sight I have not beheld this long time. My wonder still increa∣sed upon entering the city, which I think, for number of people, outdoes both Paris and London. The streets are one continued market, and thronged with populace so much that a coach can hardly pass. The common sort are a jolly lively kind of ani∣mals, more industrious than Italians usually are; they work till evening; then they take their lute or guitar (for they all play) and walk about the city, or upon the sea-shore with it, to enjoy the fresco. One sees their little brown children jumping about stark-naked, and the bigger ones dancing with castanets, while others play on the cymbal to them. Your maps will show you the situation of Naples; it is on the most lovely bay in the world, and one of the calmest seas: It has many other beauties besides those of nature. We have spent two days in visiting the remarkable places in the country round it, such as the bay of Baiae, and its remains of antiquity; the lake Avernus, and the Solfatara, Charon's grotto, &amp;c. We have been in the Sybils' cave and many other strange holes under∣ground (I only name them, because you may consult Sandy's
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
travels); but the strangest hole I ever was in, has been to-day at a place called Portici, where his Sicilian Majesty has a coun∣try-seat. About a year ago, as they were digging, they disco∣vered some parts of ancient buildings above thirty feet deep in the ground: Curiosity led them on, and they have been dig∣ging ever since; the passage they have made, with all its turnings and windings, is now more than a mile long. As you walk, you see parts of an amphitheatre, many houses adorned with marble columns, and incrusted with the same; the front of a temple, several arched vaults of rooms painted in fresco. Some pieces of painting have been taken out from hence, finer than any thing of the kind before discovered, and with these the King has adorned his palace; also a number of statues, medals, and gems; and more are dug out every day. This is known to be a Roman town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It should seem by the omission of its name, that it was not then discovered to be Herculaneum.</NOTE>, that in the Emperor Titus's time was over∣whelmed by a furious eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which is hard by. The wood and beams remain so perfect that you may see the grain; but burnt to a coal, and dropping into dust upon the least touch. We were to-day at the foot of that mountain, which at present only smokes a little, where we saw the mate∣rials that fed the stream of fire, which about four years since ran down its side. We have but a few days longer to stay here; too little in conscience for such a place. ***</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Florence,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 16, 1740.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT my return to this city, the day before yesterday, I had the pleasure of finding yours dated June the 9th. The period of our voyages, at least towards the south, is come, as you wish. We have been at Naples, spent nine or ten days there, and returned to Rome, where finding no likelihood of a Pope yet these three months, and quite wearied with the formal assemblies, and little society of that great city, Mr. Walpole determined to return hither to spend the summer, where he imagines he shall pass his time more agreeably than in the te∣dious expectation of what, when it happens, will only be a great show. For my own part, I give up the thoughts of all that with but little regret; but the city itself I do not part with so easily, which alone has amusements for whole years. How∣ever, I have passed through all that most people do, both ancient and modern; what that is you may see, better than I can tell you, in a thousand books. The Conclave we left in greater uncertainty than ever; the more than ordinary liberty they en∣joy there, and the unusual coolness of the season, makes the confinement less disagreeable to them than common, and, con∣sequently, maintains them in their irresolution. There have been very high words, one or two (it is said) have come even to blows; two more are dead within this last month, Cenci and Portia; the latter died distracted; and we left another (Altieri) at the extremity: Yet nobody dreams of an election till the
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
latter end of September. All this gives great scandal to all good catholics, and every body talks very freely on the subject. The Pretender (whom you desire an account of) I have had frequent opportunities of seeing at church, at the corso, and other places; but more particularly, and that for a whole night, at a great ball given by Count Patrizii to the Prince and Prin∣cess Craon, (who were come to Rome at that time, that he might receive from the hands of the Emperor's minister there the order of the golden fleece) at which he and his two sons were present. They are good fine boys, especially the younger, who has the more spirit of the two, and both danced incessantly all night long. For him, he is a thin ill-made man, extremely tall and aukward, of a most unpromising countenance, a good deal resembling King James the Second, and has extremely the air and look of an idiot, particularly when he laughs or prays. The first he does not often, the latter continually. He lives private enough with his little court about him, consisting of Lord Dunbar, who manages every thing, and two or three of the Preston Scotch Lords, who would be very glad to make their peace at home.</P>
<P>We happened to be at Naples on Corpus Christi Day, the greatest feast in the year, so had an opportunity of seeing their Sicilian Majesties to advantage. The King walked in the grand procession, and the Queen (being big with child) sat in a bal∣cony. He followed the Host to the church of St. Clara, where high mass was celebrated to a glorious concert of music. They are as ugly a little pair as one can see: She a pale girl, marked with the small-pox; and he a brown boy with a thin face, a huge nose, and as ungain as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="100"/>
We are settled here with Mr. Mann in a charming apartment; the river Arno runs under our windows, which we can fish out of. The sky is so serene, and the air so temperate, that one continues in the open air all night long in a slight nightgown without any danger; and the marble bridge is the resort of every body, where they hear music, eat iced fruits, and sup by moon-light; though as yet (the season being extremely back∣ward every where) these amusements are not begun. You see we are now coming northward again, though in no great haste; the Venetian and Milanese territories, and either Germany or the South of France, (according to the turn the war may take) are all that remain for us, that we have not yet seen; as to Lo∣retto, and that part of Italy, we have given over all thoughts of it.</P>

<P>I Lived at the Temple till I was sick of it: I have just left it, and find myself as much a lawyer as I was when I was in it. It is certain, at least, I may study the law here as well as I could there. My being in chambers did not signify to me a pinch of snuff. They tell me my father was a lawyer, and, as you know, eminent in the profession; and such a circumstance must be of advantage to me. My uncle too makes some figure in Westminster hall; and there's another advantage: Then my
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
grandfather's name would get me many friends. Is it not strange that a young fellow, that might enter the world with so many advantages, will not know his own interest? &amp;c. &amp;c.—What shall I say in answer to all this? For money, I neither doat upon it nor despise it; it is a necessary stuff enough. For ambition, I do not want that neither; but it is not to sit upon a bench. In short, is it not a disagreeable thing to force one's inclination, especially when one's young? not to mention that one ought to have the strength of a Hercules to go through our common law; which, I am afraid, I have not. Well! but then, say they, if one profession does not suit you, you may choose another more to your inclination. Now I protest I do not yet know my own inclination, and I believe, if that was to be my direction, I should never fix at all: There is no going by a weathercock.—I could say much more upon this subject; but there is no talking tête-à-tête cross the Alps. O the folly of young men, that never know their own interest! they never grow wise till they are ruined! and then nobody pities them, nor helps them. Dear Gray! consider me in the condition of one that has lived these two years without any person that he can speak freely to. I know it is very seldom that people trouble themselves with the sentiments of those they converse with; so they can chat about trifles, they never care whether your heart aches or no. Are you one of these? I think not. But what right have I to ask you this question? Have we known one another enough, that I should expect or demand sincerity from you? Yes, Gray, I hope we have; and I have not quite such a mean opinion of myself, as to think I do not deserve it.—But, Signor, is it not time for me to ask some∣thing about your further intentions abroad? Where do you
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
propose going next? an in Apuliam? nam illò si adveneris, tan∣quam Ulysses, cognosces tuorum neminem. Vale. So Cicero prophesies in the end of one of his letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter (written apparently in much agitation of mind, which Mr. West endeavours to conceal by an unusual carelessness of manner) is chiefly in∣serted to introduce the answer to it; which appears to me to be replete with deli∣cate feeling, manly sense, and epistolary ease.

<P>YOU do yourself and me justice, in imagining that you me∣rit, and that I am capable of sincerity. I have not a thought, or even a weakness, I desire to conceal from you; and consequently on my side deserve to be treated with the same openness of heart. My vanity perhaps might make me more reserved towards you, if you were one of the heroic race, superior to all human failings; but as mutual wants are the ties of general society, so are mutual weaknesses of private friend∣ships, supposing them mixt with some proportion of good qua∣lities; for where one may not sometimes blame, one does not much care ever to praise. All this has the air of an in∣troduction designed to soften a very harsh reproof that is to fol∣low; but it is no such matter: I only meant to ask, Why did
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
you change your lodging? Was the air bad, or the situation melancholy? If so, you are quite in the right. Only, is it not putting yourself a little out of the way of a people, with whom it seems necessary to keep up some sort of intercourse and con∣versation, though but little for your pleasure or entertainment, (yet there are, I believe, such among them as might give you both) at least for your information in that study, which, when I left you, you thought of applying to? for that there is a cer∣tain study necessary to be followed, if we mean to be of any use in the world, I take for granted; disagreeable enough (as most necessities are) but, I am afraid, unavoidable. Into how many branches these studies are divided in England, every body knows; and between that which you and I had pitched upon, and the other two, it was impossible to balance long. Exam∣ples shew one that it is not absolutely necessary to be a block∣head to succeed in this profession. The labour is long, and the elements dry and unentertaining; nor was ever any body (espe∣cially those that afterwards made a figure in it) amused, or even not disgusted in the beginning; yet, upon a further ac∣quaintance, there is surely matter for curiosity and reflection. It is strange if, among all that huge mass of words, there be not somewhat intermixed for thought. Laws have been the result of long deliberation, and that not of dull men, but the contrary; and have so close a connexion with history, nay, with philosophy itself, that they must partake a little of what they are related to so nearly. Besides, tell me, Have you ever made the attempt? Was not you frighted merely with the dis∣tant prospect? Had the Gothic character and bulkiness of those volumes (a tenth part of which perhaps it will be no further necessary to consult, than as one does a dictionary) no ill effect
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
upon your eye? Are you sure, if Coke had been printed by El∣zevir, and bound in twenty neat pocket volumes, instead of one folio, you should never have taken him up for an hour, as you would a Tully, or drank your tea over him? I know how great an obstacle ill spirits are to resolution. Do you really think, if you rid ten miles every morning, in a week's time you should not entertain much stronger hopes of the Chancellorship, and think it a much more probable thing than you do at present? The advantages you mention are not nothing; our inclinations are more than we imagine in our own power; reason and re∣solution determine them, and support under many difficulties. To me there hardly appears to be any medium between a pub∣lic life and a private one; he who prefers the first, must put himself in a way of being serviceable to the rest of mankind, if he has a mind to be of any consequence among them: Nay, he must not refuse being in a certain degree even dependent upon some men who already are so. If he has the good fortune to light on such as will make no ill use of his humility, there is no shame in this: If not, his ambition ought to give place to a reasonable pride, and he should apply to the cultivation of his own mind those abilities which he has not been permitted to use for others' service. Such a private happiness (supposing a small competence of fortune) is almost always in one's power, and the proper enjoyment of age, as the other is the employ∣ment of youth. You are yet young, have some advantages and opportunities, and an undoubted capacity, which you have never yet put to the trial. Set apart a few hours, see how the first year will agree with you, at the end of it you are still the master; if you change your mind, you will only have got the knowledge of a little somewhat that can do no hurt, or give you
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
cause of repentance. If your inclination be not fixed upon any thing else, it is a symptom that you are not absolutely deter∣mined against this, and warns you not to mistake mere indo∣lence for inability. I am sensible there is nothing stronger against what I would persuade you to, than my own practice; which may make you imagine I think not as I speak. Alas! it is not so; but I do not act what I think, and I had rather be the object of your pity, than that you should be that of mine; and, be assured, the advantage I may receive from it, does not di∣minish my concern in hearing you want somebody to con∣verse with freely, whose advice might be of more weight, and always at hand. We have some time since come to the southern period of our voyages; we spent about nine days at Naples. It is the largest and most populous city, as its environs are the most deliciously fertile country, of all Italy. We sailed in the bay of Baiae, sweated in the Solfatara, and died in the grotto del Cane, as all strangers do; saw the Corpus Christi procession, and the King and the Queen, and the city under∣ground, (which is a wonder I reserve to tell you of another time) and so returned to Rome for another fortnight; left it (left Rome!) and came hither for the summer. You have seen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will find this in Dodsley's Miscellany and also amongst Mr. Walpole's Fugitive Pieces.</NOTE>an Epistle to Mr. Ashton, that seems to me full of spirit and thought, and a good deal of poetic fire.

<P>IT is some time since I have had the pleasure of writing to you, having been upon a little excursion cross the moun∣tains to Bologna. We set out from hence at sunset, passed the Apennines by moon-light, travelling incessantly till we came to Bologna at four in the afternoon next day. There we spent a week agreeably enough, and returned as we came. The day before yesterday arrived the news of a Pope; and I have the mortification of being within four days journey of Rome, and not seeing his coronation, the heats being violent, and the in∣fectious air now at its height. We had an instance, the other day, that it is not only fancy. Two country fellows, strong men, and used to the country about Rome, having occasion to come from thence hither, and travelling on foot, as common with them, one died suddenly on the road; the other got hither, but extremely weak, and in a manner stupid; he was carried to the hospital, but died in two days. So, between fear and laziness, we remain here, and must be satisfied with the accounts other people give us of the matter. The new Pope is called Benedict XIV. being created Cardinal by Bene∣dict XIII. the last Pope but one. His name is Lambertini, a noble Bolognese, and Archbishop of that city. When I was first there, I remember to have seen him two or three times; he is a short, fat man, about sixty-five years of age, of a hearty, merry countenance, and likely to live some years. He bears a good character for generosity, affability, and other virtues; and,
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
they say, wants neither knowledge nor capacity. The worst side of him is, that he has a nephew or two; besides a certain young favourite, called Melara, who is said to have had, for some time, the arbitrary disposal of his purse and family. He is reported to have made a little speech to the Cardinals in the Conclave, while they were undetermined about an election, as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Most eminent Lords, here are three Bolognese of dif∣ferent characters, but all equally proper for the Popedom. If it be your pleasures, to pitch upon a Saint, there is Cardinal Gotti; if upon a Politician, there is Aldrovandi; if upon a Booby, here am I."</Q> The Italian is much more expressive, and, indeed, not to be translated; wherefore, if you meet with any body that understands it, you may shew them what he said in the language he spoke it. <Q REND="inline">"Emin<SUP>ssimi</SUP>. Sigr<SUP>i</SUP>. Ci siamo tré, diversi si, mà tutti idonei al Papato. Se vi piace un Santo, c' è l'Gotti; se volete una testa scaltra, e Politica, c' è l'Al∣drovandé; se un Coglione, eccomi!"</Q> Cardinal Coscia is restored to his liberty, and, it is said, will be to all his benefices. Corsini (the late Pope's nephew) as he has had no hand in this election, it is hoped, will be called to account for all his villa∣nous practices. The Pretender, they say, has resigned all his pretensions to his eldest boy, and will accept of the Grand Chancellorship, which is thirty thousand crowns a-year; the pension he has at present is only twenty thousand. I do not affirm the truth of this last article; because, if he does, it is necessary he should take the ecclesiastical habit, and it will sound mighty odd to be called his Majesty the Chancellor.—So ends my Gazette.</P>

It has the advantage of all fragments, to need neither introduction nor conclusion: Besides, if you do not like it, it is but imagining that which went before, and came after, to be infinitely better. Look in Sandy's Travels for the history of Monte Barbaro, and Monte Nuovo.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To save the reader trouble, I here insert the passage referred to.—<Q REND="inline">"West of Cicero's Villa stands the eminent Gaurus, a stony and desolate mountain, in which there are diverse obscure caverns, choaked almost with earth, where many have consumed much fruitless industry in searching for treasure. The famous Lu∣crine Lake extended formerly from Avernus to the aforesaid Gaurus: But is now no other than a little sedgy plash, choaked up by the horrible and astonishing erup∣tion of the new mountain; whereof, as oft as I think, I am easy to credit whatsoever is wonderful. For who here knows not, or who elsewhere will believe, that a mountain should arise, (partly out of a lake and partly out of the sea) in one day and a night, unto such a height as to contend in altitude with the high moun∣tains adjoining? In the year of our Lord 1538, on the 29th of September, when for certain days foregoing the country hereabout was so vexed with perpe∣tual earthquakes, as no one house was left so entire as not to expect an immediate ruin; after that the sea had retired two hundred paces from the shore, (leaving abundance of fish, and springs of fresh water rising in the bottom) this moun∣tain visibly ascended, about the second hour of the night, with an hideous roar∣ing, horribly vomiting stones and such store of cinders as overwhelmed all the building thereabout, and the salubrious baths of Tripergula, for so many ages ce∣lebrated; consumed the vines to ashes, killing birds and beasts: the fearful in∣habitants of Puzzol flying through the dark with their wives and children; naked, defiled, crying out, and detesting their calamities. Manifold mischiefs have they suffered by the barbarous, yet none like this which Nature inflicted.—This new mountain, when newly raised, had a number of issues; at some of them smoking and sometimes flaming; at others disgorging rivulets of hot waters; keep∣ing within a terrible rumbling; and many miserably perished that ventured to de∣scend into the hollowness above. But that hollow on the top is at present an orchard, and the mountain throughout is bereft of his terrors." <BIBL><HI>Sandy's Travels, book</HI> 4, <HI>page</HI> 275, 277, <HI>and</HI> 278.</BIBL></Q> </NOTE></P>

<P>There was a certain little ode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Alcaic Ode inserted in Letter XXI.</NOTE> set out from Rome, in a letter of recommendation to you, but possibly fell into the enemies' hands, for I never heard of its arrival. It is a little imperti∣nent to inquire after its welfare; but you, that are a father, will excuse a parent's foolish fondness. Last post I received a very diminutive letter: It made excuses for its unentertaining∣ness, very little to the purpose; since it assured me, very strongly, of your esteem, which is to me the thing; all the rest appear but as the petits agrémens, the garnishing of the dish. P. Bougeant, in his Langage des Bêtes, fancies that your birds, who continually repeat the same note, say only in plain terms, <Q REND="inline">"Je vous aime, ma chere; ma chere, je vous aime;"</Q> and that those of greater genius indeed, with various trills, run divisions upon the subject; but that the <HI>fond,</HI> from whence it all proceeds, is <Q REND="inline">"toujours je vous aime."</Q> Now you may, as you find yourself dull or in humour, either take me for a
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
chaffinch or nightingale; sing your plain song, or show your skill in music, but in the bottom let there be, toujours, tou∣jours de l'Amitié.</P>
<P>As to what you call my serious letter; be assured, that your future state is to me entirely indifferent. Do not be angry, but hear me; I mean with respect to myself. For whether you be at the top of Fame, or entirely unknown to mankind; at the Council-table, or at Dick's coffee-house; sick and sim∣ple, or well and wife; whatever alteration mere accident works in you, (supposing it utterly impossible for it to make any change in your sincerity and honesty, since these are condi∣tions sine quâ non) I do not see any likelihood of my not being yours ever.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Florence,</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 9, 1740.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE beginning of next spring is the time determined for our return at furthest; possibly it may be before that time. How the interim will be employed, or what route we shall take, is not so certain. If we remain friends with France, upon leaving this country we shall cross over to Venice, and so return through the cities north of the Po to Genoa; from thence take a felucca to Marseilles, and come back through Paris. If the contrary fall out, which seems not unlikely, we must make the Milanese, and those parts of Italy, in our way to Ve∣nice;
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
from thence pass through the Tirol into Germany, and come home by the Low-Countries. As for Florence, it has been gayer than ordinary for this last month, being one round of balls and entertainments, occasioned by the arrival of a great Milanese Lady; for the only thing the Italians shine in, is their reception of strangers. At such times every thing is magnifi∣cence: The more remarkable, as in their ordinary course of life they are parsimonious, even to a degree of nastiness. I saw in one of the vastest palaces in Rome (that of Prince Pam∣filio) the apartment which he himself inhabited, a bed that most servants in England would disdain to lie in, and furni∣ture much like that of a soph at Cambridge, for conveni∣ence and neatness. This man is worth 30,000 l. sterling a year. As for eating, there are not two Cardinals in Rome that allow more than six paoli, which is three shillings a day, for the ex∣pence of their table; and you may imagine they are still less ex∣travagant here than there. But when they receive a visit from any friend, their houses and persons are set out to the greatest advantage, and appear in all their splendour; it is, indeed, from a motive of vanity, and with the hopes of having it repaid them with interest, whenever they have occasion to return the visit. I call visits going from one city of Italy to another; for it is not so among acquaintance of the same place on common occasions. The new Pope has retrenched the charges of his own table to a sequin (10 s.) a meal. The applause which all he says and does meets with, is enough to encourage him really to deserve fame. They say he is an able and honest man; he is reckoned a wit too. The other day, when the Senator of Rome came to wait upon him, at the first compliments he made him the Pope pulled off his cap: His Master of the Ceremonies, who stood by his side,
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
touched him softly, as to warn him that such a condescension was too great in him, and out of all manner of rule: Upon which he turned to him and said, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! I cry you mercy, good Master, it is true, I am but a Novice of a Pope; I have not yet so much as learned ill manners."</Q> ***</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Florence,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between the date of this and the foregoing letter the reader will perceive an interval of full three months: as Mr. Gray saw no new places during this period, his letters were chiefly of news and common occurrences, and are therefore omitted.</NOTE> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 12, 1741.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE still continue constant at Florence, at present one of the dullest cities in Italy. Though it is the middle of the Carnival there are no public diversions; nor is masquerading permitted as yet. The Emperor's obsequies are to be celebra∣ted publickly the 16th of this month; and after that, it is ima∣gined every thing will go on in its usual course. In the mean time, to employ the minds of the populace, the Government has thought fit to bring into the city in a solemn manner, and at a great expence, a famous statue of the Virgin called the Madonna dell'Impruneta, from the place of her residence, which is upon a mountain seven miles off. It never has been practised but at times of public calamity; and was done at present to avert the ill effects of a late great inundation, which it was feared might cause some epidemical distemper. It was introduced a
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
fortnight ago in procession, attended by the Council of Regen∣cy, the Senate, the Nobility, and all the Religious Orders, on foot and bare-headed, and so carried to the great church, where it was frequented by an infinite concourse of people from all the country round. Among the rest I paid my devotions almost every day, and saw numbers of people possessed with the devil, who were brought to be exorcised. It was indeed in the even∣ing, and the church-doors were always shut before the ceremo∣nies were finished, so that I could not be eye-witness of the event; but that they were all cured is certain, for one never heard any more of them the next morning. I am to-night just returned from seeing our Lady make her exit with the same so∣lemnities she entered. The show had a finer effect than before; for it was dark; and every body (even those of the mob that could afford it) bore a white-wax flambeau. I believe there were at least five thousand of them, and the march was near three hours in passing before the window. The subject of all this devotion is supposed to be a large Tile with a rude figure in bas-relief upon it. I say supposed, because since the time it was found (for it was found in the earth in ploughing) only two people have seen it; the one was, by good-luck, a saint; the other was struck blind for his presumption. Ever since she has been covered with seven veils; nevertheless, those who approach her tabernacle cast their eyes down, for fear they should spy her through all her veils. Such is the history, as I had it from the Lady of the house where I stood to see her pass; with many other circumstances; all which she firmly believes, and ten thousand beside.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="116"/>
We shall go to Venice in about six weeks, or sooner. A number of German troops are upon their march into this State, in case the King of Naples thinks proper to attack it. It is cer∣tain he has asked the Pope's leave for his troops to pass through his country. The Tuscans in general are much discontented, and foolish enough to wish for a Spanish government, or any rather than this. ****</P>

<P>I Know not what degree of satisfaction it will give you to be told that we shall set out from hence the 24th of this month, and not stop above a fortnight at any place in our way. This I feel, that you are the principal pleasure I have to hope for in my own country. Try at least to make me imagine myself not indifferent to you; for I must own I have the vanity of desiring to be esteemed by somebody, and would choose that somebody should be one whom I esteem as much as I do you. As I am recommending myself to your love, methinks I ought to send you my picture (for I am no more what I was, some circum∣stances excepted, which I hope I need not particularize to you); you must add then, to your former idea, two years of age, a reasonable quantity of dullness, a great deal of silence, and something that rather resembles, than is, thinking; a con∣fused notion of many strange and fine things that have swum before my eyes for some time, a want of love for general socie∣ty,
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
indeed an inability to it. On the good side you may add a sensibility for what others feel, and indulgence for their faults or weaknesses, a love of truth, and detestation of every thing else. Then you are to deduct a little impertinence, a little laughter, a great deal of pride, and some spirits. These are all the alte∣rations I know of, you perhaps may find more. Think not that I have been obliged for this reformation of manners to reason or reflection, but to a severer school-mistress, Expe∣rience. One has little merit in learning her lessons, for one cannot well help it; but they are more useful than others, and imprint themselves in the very heart. I find I have been ha∣ranguing in the style of the Son of Sirach, so shall finish here, and tell you that our route is settled as follows: First to Bo∣logna for a few days, to hear the Viscontina sing; next to Reggio, where is a Fair. Now, you must know, a Fair here is not a place where one eats gingerbread or rides upon hobby∣horses; here are no musical clocks, nor tall Leicestershire wo∣men; one has nothing but masquing, gaming, and singing. If you love operas, there will be the most splendid in Italy, four tip-top voices, a new theatre, the Duke and Dutchess in all their pomps and vanities. Does not this sound magnificent? Yet is the city of Reggio but one step above Old Brentford. Well; next to Venice by the 11th of May, there to see the old Doge wed the Adriatic Whore. Then to Verona, so to Milan, so to Marseilles, so to Lyons, so to Paris, so to West, &amp;c. in saecula saeculorum. Amen.</P>
<P>Eleven months, at different times, have I passed at Florence; and yet (God help me) know not either people or language.

<HEAD>SECTION THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Gray returned from abroad, he found his Father's constitution almost entirely worn out by the very severe attacks of the gout, to which he had been for many years subject; and indeed the next return of that distemper was fatal to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He came to Town about the 1st of September, 1741. His Father died the 6th of November following, at the age of sixty-five.</NOTE> This happened about two months after his son reached London.</P>
<P>It has been before observed, that Mr. Philip Gray was of a reserved and indolent temper; he was also morose, unsocial, and obstinate; defects which, if not inherent in his disposition, might probably arise from his bodily complaints. His indo∣lence had led him to neglect the business of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His business was that which at the time was called a Money-Scrivener; and it may not be amiss to mention, for the singularity of the thing, that Mil∣ton's father was of the same profession: But he also had <Q REND="inline">"Music in his soul,"</Q> and was esteemed a considerable master in that science. Some of his compositions are extant in Old Wilby's Set of Airs, and in Ravenscroft's Psalms. The great Poet alludes finely both to the musical genius and the trade of his father in those beau∣tiful hexameters, <Q REND="inline">"Ad Patrem,"</Q> which are inserted amongst his Latin Poems.</NOTE>his profession; his obstinacy, to build a country-house at Wanstead, without acquainting either his wife or son with the design (to which he knew they would be very averse) till it was executed. This building, which he undertook late in life, was attended with very considerable expence; which might almost be called
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
so much money thrown away: since, after his death, the house was obliged to be sold for two thousand pounds less than its ori∣ginal cost. Mr. Gray, therefore, at this time found his patri∣mony so small, that it would by no means enable him to prose∣cute the study of the law, without his becoming burthensome to his Mother and Aunt. These two sisters had for many years carried on <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They kept a kind of India warehouse on Cornhill under the joint names of Gray and Antrobus.</NOTE>a trade separate from that of Mrs. Gray's husband; by which having acquired what would support them decently for the rest of their lives, they left off busi∣ness soon after his death, and retired to Stoke, near Windsor, to the house of their other Sister, Mrs. Rogers, lately become the widow of a clergyman of that name. Both of them wished Mr. Gray to follow the profession for which he had been originally intended, and would undoubtedly have contri∣buted all in their power to enable him to do it with ease and conveniency. He on his part, though he had taken his reso∣lution of declining it, was too delicate to hurt two persons for whom he had so tender an affection, by peremptorily declaring his real intentions; and therefore changed, or pretended to change, the line of that study; and, accordingly, the latter end of the subsequent year went to Cambridge to take his Ba∣chelor's Degree in Civil Law.</P>
<P>But the narrowness of his circumstances was not the only thing that distressed him at this period. He had, as we have seen, lost the friendship of Mr. Walpole abroad. He had also lost much time in his travels; a loss which appli∣cation could not easily retrieve, when so severe and laborious a
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
study as that of the Common Law was to be the object of it; and he well knew that, whatever improvement he might have made in this interval, either in taste or science, such improvement would stand him in little stead with regard to his present situa∣tion and exigencies. This was not all: His other friend, Mr. West, he found, on his return, oppressed by sickness and a load of family misfortunes; which, were I fully acquainted with them, it would not be my inclination here to dwell upon. These the sympathizing heart of Mr. Gray made his own. He did all in his power (for he was now with him in Lon∣don) to soothe the sorrows of his friend, and to try to alleviate them by every office of the purest and most perfect affection: But his cares were vain. The distresses of Mr. West's mind had already too far affected a body, from the first, weak and delicate. His health declined daily, and, therefore, he left Town in March 1742, and, for the benefit of the air, went to David Mitchell's, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at Popes, near Hatfield, Hertford∣shire; at whose house he died the 1st of June following.</P>

<P>I Trust to the country, and that easy indolence you say you enjoy there, to restore you your health and spirits; and doubt not but, when the sun grows warm enough to tempt you from your fire-side, you will (like all other things) be the better for his influence. He is my old friend, and an excellent nurse, I assure you. Had it not been for him, life had often been to me intolerable. Pray do not imagine that Tacitus, of all au∣thors in the world, can be tedious. An annalist, you know, is by no means master of his subject; and I think one may venture to say, that if those Pannonian affairs are tedious in his hands, in another's they would have been insupportable. However, fear not, they will soon be over, and he will make ample amends. A man, who could join the <HI>brilliant</HI> of wit and concise sententious∣ness
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
peculiar to that age, with the truth and gravity of better times, and the deep reflection and good sense of the best mo∣derns, cannot choose but have something to strike you. Yet what I admire in him above all this, is his detestation of tyran∣ny, and the high spirit of liberty that every now and then breaks out, as it were, whether he would or no. I remember a sentence in his Agricola that (concise as it is) I always admi∣red for saying much in a little compass. He speaks of Domi∣tian, who upon seeing the last will of that General, where he had made him Coheir with his Wife and Daughter, <Q REND="inline">"Satis constabat laetatum eum, velut honore, judicioque: tam caeca &amp; corrupta mens assiduis adulationibus erat, ut nesciret a bono patre non scribi haeredem, nisi malum principem."</Q></P>
<P>As to the Dunciad it is greatly admired: The Genii of Ope∣ras and Schools, with their attendants, the pleas of the Virtu∣osos and Florists, and the yawn of dullness in the end, are as fine as any thing he has written. The Metaphysicians' part is to me the worst; and here and there a few ill-expressed lines, and some hardly intelligible.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of sending you a long speech of Agrippina; much too long, but I could be glad you would retrench it. Aceronia, you may remember, had been giving quiet counsels. I fancy, if it ever be finished, it will be in the nature of Nat. Lee's Bedlam Tragedy, which had twenty-five acts and some odd scenes.</P>

<P><PB N="124" REF="127"/>
The speech herewith sent to Mr. West was the concluding one of the first scene of a tragedy, which I believe was begun the preceding winter. The Britannicus of M. Racine, I know was one of Mr. Gray's most favourite plays; and the admi∣rable manner in which I have heard him say that he saw it represented at Paris, seems to have led him to choose the death of Agrippina for this his first and only effort in the drama. The execution of it also, as far as it goes, is so very much in Racine's taste, that I suspect, if that great poet had been born an Englishman, he would have written precisely in the same style and manner. However, as there is at present in this nation a general prejudice against declamatory plays, I agree with a learned friend, who perused the manuscript, that this fragment will be little relished by the many; yet the admirable strokes of nature and character with which it abounds, and the majesty of its diction, prevent me from withholding from the few, who I expect will relish it, so great a curiosity (to call it nothing more) as part of a tragedy written by Mr. Gray. These persons well know, that till style and sentiment be a little more regarded, mere action and passion will never secure reputation to the Author, whatever they may do to the Actor. It is the business of the one <Q REND="inline">"to strut and fret his hour upon the stage;"</Q> and if he frets and struts enough, he is sure to find his reward in the plaudit of an upper gallery; but the other ought to have some regard to the cooler judgment of the closet: For I will be bold to say, that if Shakespear him∣self had not written a multitude of passages which please there as much as they do on the stage, his reputation would not stand so universally high as it does at present. Many of these pas∣sages, to the shame of our theatrical taste, are omitted con∣stantly
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
in the representation: But I say not this from convic∣tion that the mode of writing, which Mr. Gray pursued, is the best for dramatic purposes. I think myself, what I have as∣serted elsewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letters prefixt to Elfrida, particularly Letter II.</NOTE>, that a medium between the French and English taste would be preferable to either; and yet this me∣dium, if hit with the greatest nicety, would fail of success on our theatre, and that for a very obvious reason. Actors (I speak of the troop collectively) must all learn to speak as well as act, in order to do justice to such a drama.</P>
<P>But let me hasten to give the reader what little insight I can into Mr. Gray's plan, as I find, and select it from two detached papers. The Title and Dramatis Personae are as follow:

<P><PB N="126" REF="129"/>
The argument drawn out by him, in these two papers, under the idea of a plot and under-plot, I shall here unite; as it will tend to show that the action itself was possest of sufficient unity.</P>
<P>The drama opens with the indignation of Agrippina, at re∣ceiving her son's orders from Anicetus to remove from Baiae, and to have her guard taken from her. At this time Otho ha∣ving conveyed Poppaea from the house of her husband Rufus Crispinus, brings her to Baiae, where he means to conceal her among the croud; or, if his fraud is discovered, to have re∣course to the Emperor's authority; but, knowing the lawless temper of Nero, he determines not to have recourse to that expedient, but on the utmost necessity. In the meantime he commits her to the care of Anicetus, whom he takes to be his friend, and in whose age he thinks he may safely confide. Nero is not yet come to Baiae; but Seneca, whom he sends before him, informs Agrippina of the accusation concerning Rubellius Plan∣cus, and desires her to clear herself, which she does briefly; but demands to see her son, who, on his arrival, acquits her of all suspicion, and restores her to her honours In the meanwhile Anicetus, to whose care Poppaea had been entrusted by Otho, contrives the following plot to ruin Agrippina: He betrays his trust to Otho, and brings Nero, as it were by chance, to the sight of the beautiful Poppaea; the Emperor is immediately struck with her charms, and she, by a feigned resistance, in∣creases his passion; tho', in reality, she is from the first dazzled with the prospect of empire, and forgets Otho: She therefore joins with Anicetus in his design of ruining Agrippina, soon perceiving that it will be for her interest. Otho hearing that
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
the Emperor had seen Poppaea, is much enraged; but not knowing that this interview was obtained thro' the treachery of Anicetus, is readily persuaded by him to see Agrippina in secret, and acquaint her with his fears that her son Nero would marry Poppaea. Agrippina, to support her own power, and to wean the Emperor from the love of Poppaea, gives Otho encouragement, and promises to support him. Ani∣cetus secretly introduces Nero to hear their discourse; who resolves immediately on his mother's death, and, by Anicetus's means, to destroy her by drowning. A solemn feast, in honour of their reconciliation, is to be made; after which she being to go by sea to Bauli, the ship is so contrived as to sink or crush her; she escapes by accident, and returns to Baiae. In this interval, Otho has an interview with Poppaea; and being duped a second time by Anicetus and her, determines to fly with her into Greece, by means of a vessel which is to be furnished by Anicetus; but he, pretending to remove Poppaea on board in the night, conveys her to Nero's apartment: She there encourages and determines Nero to banish Otho, and finish the horrid deed he had attempted on his mother. Ani∣cetus undertakes to execute his resolves; and, under pretence of a plot upon the Emperor's life, is sent with a guard to murder Agrippina, who is still at Baiae in imminent fear, and irresolute how to conduct herself. The account of her death, and the Emperor's horrour and fruitless remorse, finishes the drama.</P>
<P>I refer the reader to the 13th and 14th books of the annals of Tacitus for the facts on which this story is founded: By turning to that author, he will easily see how far the poet thought it necessary to deviate from the truth of history. I
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
shall only further observe, that as such a fable could not possibly admit of any good character, it is terror only and not pity that could be excited by this tragedy, had it been completed. Yet it was surely capable of exciting this passion in a supreme degree; if, what the critics tell us be true, that crimes, which illustrious persons commit, affect us from the very circumstance of their rank, because we unite with that our fears for the public weal.</P>

<P>I Own in general I think Agrippina's speech too long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has obviated this objection, not by retrenching, but by putting part of it into the mouth of Aceronia, and by breaking it in a few other places. Originally it was one continued speech from the line <Q REND="inline">"Thus ever grave and undisturbed Reflection"</Q> to the end of the scene; which was undoubtedly too long for the lungs of any Actress.</NOTE>; but how to retrench it, I know not: But I have something else to say, and that is in relation to the style, which appears to me too antiquated. Racine was of another opinion; he no where gives you the phrases of Ronsard: His language is the language of the times, and that of the purest sort; so that his French is reckoned a standard. I will not decide what style is fit for our English stage; but I should rather choose one that bordered up∣on Cato, than upon Shakespear. One may imitate (if one can) Shakespear's manner, his surprizing strokes of true nature, his expressive force in painting characters, and all his other beauties; preserving at the same time our own language. Were Shake∣spear alive now, he would write a different style from what he did. These are my sentiments upon these matters: Perhaps I am wrong, for I am neither a Tarpa, nor am I quite an Aristar∣chus. You see I write freely both of you and Shakespear; but it is as good as writing not freely, where you know it is accept∣able.</P>
<P>I have been tormented within this week with a most violent cough; for when once it sets up its note, it will go on, cough
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
after cough, shaking and tearing me for half an hour together; and then it leaves me in a great sweat, as much fatigued as if I had been labouring at the plough. All this description of my cough in prose, is only to introduce another description of it in verse, perhaps not worth your perusal; but it is very short, and besides has this remarkable in it, that it was the production of four o'clock in the morning, while I lay in my bed tossing and coughing, and all unable to sleep.—<Q><L>Ante omnes morbos importunissima tussis,</L>

<P>Do not mistake me, I do not condemn Tacitus: I was then inclined to find him tedious: The German sedition sufficiently made up for it; and the speech of Germanicus, by which he reclaims his soldiers, is quite masterly.

<P>YOU are the first who ever made a Muse of a Cough; to me it seems a much more easy task to versify in one's sleep, (that indeed you were of old famous for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I suppose at Eaton School.</NOTE>) than for want of it. Not the wakeful nightingale (when she had a cough) ever sung so sweetly. I give you thanks for your warble, and wish you could sing yourself to rest. These wicked remains of your illness will sure give way to warm weather and gentle ex∣ercise; which I hope you will not omit as the season advances. Whatever low spirits and indolence, the effect of them, may advise to the contrary, I pray you add five steps to your walk daily for my sake; by the help of which, in a month's time, I propose to set you on horseback.</P>
<P>I talked of the Dunciad as concluding you had seen it; if you have not, do you choose I should get and send it to you? I have myself, upon your recommendation, been reading Joseph Andrews. The incidents are ill laid and without invention; but the characters have a great deal of nature, which always pleases even in her lowest shapes. Parson Adams is perfectly well; so is Mrs. Slipslop, and the story of Wilson; and throughout he shews himself well read in Stage-Coaches, Coun∣try Squires, Inns, and Inns of Court. His reflections upon high people and low people, and misses and masters, are very good. However the exaltedness of some minds (or rather as I
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
shrewdly suspect their insipidity and want of feeling or observa∣tion) may make them insensible to these light things, (I mean such as characterize and paint nature) yet surely they are as weighty and much more useful than your grave discourses upon the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He seems here to glance at Hutchinson, the disciple of Shaftsbury: Of whom he had little better opinion, than of his master.</NOTE>, the passions, and what not.

<P>You are very good in giving yourself the trouble to read and find fault with my long harangues. Your freedom (as you call it) has so little need of apologies, that I should scarce excuse your treating me any otherwise; which, whatever compliment it might be to my vanity, would be making a very ill one to my understanding. As to matter of stile, I have this to say: The language of the age <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more just than this observation; and nothing more likely to preserve our poetry from falling into insipidity, than pursuing the rules here laid down for supporting the diction of it: Particularly with respect to the Drama.</NOTE> is never the language of poetry; except among the French, whose verse, where the thought or image does not support it, differs in nothing from prose. Our poetry,
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
on the contrary, has a language peculiar to itself; to which al∣most every one, that has written, has added something by en∣riching it with foreign idioms and derivatives: Nay sometimes words of their own composition or invention. Shakespear and Milton have been great creators this way; and no one more li∣centious than Pope or Dryden, who perpetually borrow ex∣pressions from the former. Let me give you some instances from Dryden, whom every body reckons a great master of our poetical tongue.—Full of <HI>museful mopeings</HI>—unlike the <HI>trim</HI> of love—a pleasant <HI>beverage</HI>—a <HI>roundelay</HI> of love—stood silent in his <HI>mood</HI>—with knots and <HI>knares</HI> deformed—his <HI>ireful mood</HI>—in proud <HI>array</HI>—his <HI>boon</HI> was granted—and <HI>disarray</HI> and shame∣ful rout—<HI>wayward</HI> but wise—<HI>furbished</HI> for the field—the <HI>foiled dodderd</HI> oaks—<HI>disherited</HI>—<HI>smouldring</HI> flames—<HI>retchless</HI> of laws—<HI>crones</HI> old and ugly—the <HI>beldam</HI> at his side—the <HI>grandam-hag</HI>—<HI>villanize</HI> his father's fame.—But they are infinite: And our language not being a settled thing (like the French) has an un∣doubted right to words of an hundred years old, provided an∣tiquity have not rendered them unintelligible. In truth, Shake∣spear's language is one of his principal beauties; and he has no less advantage over your Addisons and Rows in this, than in those other great excellencies you mention. Every word in him is a picture. Pray put me the following lines into the tongue of our modern Dramatics:<Q><L>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</L>
<L>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass:</L>
<L>I, that am rudely stampt, and want love's majesty</L>

<L>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</L>
<L>Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time</L>
<L>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up—</L></Q> And what follows. To me they appear untranslatable; and if this be the case, our language is greatly degenerated. How∣ever, the affectation of imitating Shakespear may doubtless be carried too far; and is no sort of excuse for sentiments ill-suit∣ed, or speeches ill-timed, which I believe is a little the case with me. I guess the most faulty expressions may be these—<HI>silken</HI> son of <HI>dalliance</HI>—<HI>drowsier</HI> pretensions—wrinkled <HI>beldams</HI>—<HI>arched</HI> the hearer's brow and <HI>riveted</HI> his eyes in <HI>fearful extasie.</HI> These are easily altered or omitted; and indeed if the thoughts be wrong or superfluous, there is nothing easier than to leave out the whole. The first ten or twelve lines are, I believe, the best<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The lines which he means here are from—<HI>thus ever grave and undisturb'd re∣flection</HI>—to <HI>Rubellius lives.</HI> For the part of the scene, which he sent in his for∣mer letter, began there.</NOTE>; and as for the rest, I was betrayed into a good deal of it by Tacitus; only what he has said in five words, I imagine I have said in fifty lines: Such is the misfortune of imitating the inimitable. Now, if you are of my opinion, una litura may do the business, better than a dozen; and you need not fear un∣ravelling my web. I am a sort of spider; and have little else to do but spin it over again, or creep to some other place and spin there.

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. WEST to Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>TO begin with the conclusion of your letter, which is Greek, I desire that you will quarrel no more with your manner of passing your time. In my opinion it is irreproach∣able, especially as it produces such excellent fruit; and if I, like a saucy bird, must be pecking at it, you ought to consider that it is because I like it. No una litura I beg you, no unravel∣ling of your web, dear Sir! only pursue it a little further, and then one shall be able to judge of it a little better. You know the crisis of a play is in the first act; its damnation or salvation wholly rests there. But till that first act is over, every body suspends his vote; so how do you think I can form, as yet, any just idea of the speeches in regard to their length or shortness? The connection and symmetry of such little parts with one another must naturally escape me, as not having the plan of the whole in my head; neither can I decide about the thoughts whether they are wrong or superfluous; they may have some future tendency which I perceive not. The style only was free to me, and there I find we are pretty much of the same senti∣ment: For you say the affectation of imitating Shakespear may doubtless be carried too far; I say as much and no more. For old words we know are old gold, provided they are well chosen. Whatever Ennius was, I do not consider Shakespear as a dunghill in the least: On the contrary, he is a mine of antient ore, where all our great modern poets have found their
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
advantage. I do not know how it is; but his old expressions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakespear's energy does not arise so much from these old expressions, (most of which were not old in his time) but from his artificial management of them. This artifice in the great Poet is developed with much exactness by Dr. Hurd in his excellent note on this passage in Horace's Ep. ad Pisones.
<Q><L>Dixeris egregiè, notum si callida verbum</L>
<L>Reddiderit junctura novum.</L></Q><BIBL><HI>See Hurd's Horace, vol.</HI> 1<HI>st, Ed.</HI> 4<HI>th, p.</HI> 49.</BIBL></NOTE> have more energy in them than ours, and are even more adapted to poetry; certainly, where they are judiciously and sparingly in∣serted, they add a certain grace to the composition; in the same manner as Poussin gave a beauty to his pictures by his know∣ledge in the antient proportions: But should he, or any other painter, carry the imitation too far, and neglect that best of models Nature, I am afraid it would prove a very flat perfor∣mance. To finish this long criticism: I have this further no∣tion about old words revived, (is not this a pretty way of finishing?) I think them of excellent use in tales; they add a certain drollery to the comic, and a romantic gravity to the se∣rious, which are both charming in their kind; and this way of charming Dryden understood very well. One need only read Milton to acknowledge the dignity they give the Epic. But now comes my opinion that they ought to be used in Tragedy more sparingly, than in most kinds of poetry. Tragedy is designed for public representation, and what is designed for that should be certainly most intelligible. I believe half the audi∣ence that come to Shakespear's plays do not understand the half of what they hear.—But finissons enfin.—Yet one word more.—You think the ten or twelve first lines the best, now I

<P>I Should not have failed to answer your Letter immediately, but I went out of town for a little while, which hindered me. Its length (besides the pleasure naturally accompanying a long letter from you) affords me a new one, when I think it is a symptom of the recovery of your health, and flatter myself that your bodily strength returns in proportion. Pray do not forget to mention the progress you make continually. As to Agrippina, I begin to be of your opinion; and find myself (as women are of their children) less enamoured of my productions the older they grow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He never after awakened her; and I believe this was occasioned by the stric∣tures which his friend had made on his dramatic style; which (though he did not think them well founded, as they certainly were not) had an effect which Mr. West, we may believe, did not intend them to have. I remember some years after I was also the innocent cause of his delaying to finish his fine ode on the progress of Poetry. I told him, on reading the part he shewed me, that <Q REND="inline">"though I admired it greatly, and thought that it breathed the very spirit of Pindar, yet I suspected it would by no means hit the public taste."</Q> Finding afterwards that he did not proceed in finishing it, I often expostulated with him on the subject; but he always replied <Q REND="inline">"No, you have thrown cold water upon it."</Q> I mention this little anecdote, to shew how much the opinion of a friend, even when it did not convince his judgment, affected his inclination.</NOTE> She is laid up to sleep till next sum∣mer; so bid her good night.

tongue, which is too diffuse, and daily grows more and more enervate. One shall never be more sensible of this, than in turning an Author like Tacitus. I have been trying it in some parts of Thucydides, (who has a little resemblance of him in his conciseness) and endeavoured to do it closely, but found it produced mere nonsense. If you have any inclination to see what figure Tacitus makes in Italian, I have a Tuscan translation of Davanzati, much esteemed in Italy; and will send you the same speech you sent me; that is, if you care for it.

<P>WITHOUT any preface I come to your verses, which I read over and over with excessive pleasure, and which are at least as good as Propertius. I am only sorry you follow the blunders of Broukhusius, all whose insertions are nonsense. I have some objections to your antiquated words, and am also an enemy to Alexandrines; at least I do not like them in Elegy. But, after all, I admire your translation so extremely, that I cannot help repeating I long to shew you some little errors you are fallen into by following Broukhusius<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I have omitted here a paragraph or two, in which different lines of the Elegy were quoted, because I had previously omitted the translation of it.</NOTE>. *** Were I with

you now, and Propertius with your verses lay upon the table between us, I could discuss this point in a moment; but there is nothing so tiresome as spinning out a criticism in a letter; doubts arise, and explanations follow, till there swells out at least a volume of undigested observations: and all because you are not with him whom you want to convince. Read only the Letters between Pope and Cromwell in proof of this; they dis∣pute without end. Are you aware now that I have an interest all this while in banishing Criticism from our correspondence? Indeed I have; for I am going to write down a little Ode (if it deserves the name) for your perusal, which I am afraid will hardly stand that test.

<P>I Rejoice to see you putting up your prayers to the May: She cannot choose but come at such a call. It is as light and genteel as herself. You bid me find fault; I am afraid I can∣not;
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
however I will try. The first stanza (if what you say to me in it did not make me think it the best) I should call the worst of the five (except the fourth line). The two next are very picturesque, Miltonic, and musical; her bed is so soft and so snug that I long to lie with her. But those two lines, <Q REND="inline">"Great Nature"</Q> are my favourites. The exclamation of the flowers is a little step too far. The last stanza is full as good as the second and third; the last line bold, but I think not too bold. Now, as to myself and my translation, pray do not call names. I never saw Broukhusius in my life. It is Scaliger who attempted to range Propertius in order; who was, and still is, in sad condition<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">Here some criticism on the Elegy is omitted for a former reason.</NOTE>***.

<P>MINE, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the most part; which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls Joy or Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state, and ça ne laisse que de s'amuser. The only fault of it is insipidity; which is apt now and then to give a sort of Ennui, which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing. But there is another sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has somewhat in it like Tertullian's rule of faith, Credo quia im∣possibile est; for it believes, nay, is sure of every thing that is unlikely, so it be but frightful; and, on the other hand, ex∣cludes and shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes, and every thing that is pleasurable; from this the Lord deliver us! for none but he and sunshiny weather can do it. In hopes of en∣joying this kind of weather, I am going into the country for a few weeks, but shall be never the nearer any society; so, if you have any charity, you will continue to write. My life is like Harry the fourth's supper of Hens. <Q REND="inline">"Poulets a la broche, Pou∣lets en Ragôut, Poulets en Hâchis, Poulets en Fricasées."</Q> Read∣ing here, Reading there; nothing but books with different sauces.

<P>Here follows also the beginning of an Heroic Epistle; but you must give me leave to tell my own story first, because His∣torians differ. Massinissa was the son of Gala King of the Mas∣syli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a most signal overthrow to Syphax, King of the Masae∣sylians, then an ally of the Romans. Soon after Asdrubal, son of Gisgo the Carthaginian General, gave the beautiful Sopho∣nisba,
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not consummated on account of Massinissa's be∣ing obliged to hasten into Spain, there to command his father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their af∣fairs at this time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their interest, if they could bring over Syphax to themselves. This in time they actually effected; and, to strengthen their new alliance, commanded Asdrubal to give his daughter to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Massinissa arose from the great change of affairs, which had happened among the Massylians during his absence; for his father and uncle were dead, and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the throne.) Sophonisba was accord∣ingly married to Syphax; and Massinissa, enraged at the af∣front, became a friend to the Romans. They drove the Car∣thaginians before them out of Spain, and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him prisoner; upon which Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to Laelius and Massinissa. The rest of the affair, the marriage, and the sending of poi∣son, every body knows. This is partly taken from Livy, and partly from Appian.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Immediately after writing the preceding Letter, Mr. Gray went upon a visit to his relations at Stoke; where he writ that beautiful little Ode which stands first in his collection of Poems.
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
He sent it as soon as written to his beloved friend; but he was dead<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This singular anecdote is founded on a marginal note in his common-place book, where that Ode is transcribed, and the following memorandum annexed: <Q REND="inline">"Written at Stoke the beginning of June 1742, and sent to Mr. West, not knowing he was then dead."</Q></NOTE> before it reached Hertfordshire. He died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was buried at Hatfield (the House called Popes being in that parish.) On a grave-stone in the chancel is the following plain inscription: <Q REND="inline">"Here lieth the body of Richard West, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> only son to the Right Honourable Richard West, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who died the 1st of June, 1742, in the 26th year of his age."</Q></NOTE> only twenty days after he had written the letter to Mr. Gray, which con∣cluded with <Q REND="inline">"Vale, &amp; vive paulisper cum vivis."</Q> So little was the amiable youth then aware of the short time that he himself would be numbered amongst the living. But this is almost constantly the case with such persons as die of that most remediless, yet most flattering of all distempers, a Con∣sumption. Shall Humanity be thankful or sorry that it is so? Thankful, surely. For as this malady generally attacks the Young and the Innocent, it seems the merciful intention of Heaven that, to these, death should come unperceived, and as it were by stealth; divested of one of his sharpest stings, the lingering expectation of their dissolution. As to Mr. Gray, we may assure ourselves that he felt much more than his dying friend, when the letter, which inclosed the Ode, was returned unopened. There seems to be a kind of presentiment in that pathetic piece, which Readers of taste will feel when they learn this anecdote; and which will make them read it with redou∣bled pleasure. It will also throw a melancholy grace (to bor∣row one of his own expressions) on the Ode on a distant pro∣spect of Eton, and on that to Adversity; both of them written
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
the August following: for as both these Poems abound with Pathos, those who have feeling hearts will feel this excellence the more strongly, when they know the cause from whence it arose; and the unfeeling will, perhaps, learn to respect what they cannot taste, when they are prevented from imputing to a splenetic melancholy, what in fact sprung from the most benevolent of all sensations. I am inclined to believe that the Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time also: Though I am aware that, as it stands at pre∣sent, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally, I shall shew in my notes on the poem. But the first impulse of his sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender Sonnet in English, on the Petrarchian model; and also to a sublime Apostrophe in Hexameters, written in the Genuine strain of Classical majesty, with which he intended to begin one of his books, <Q REND="inline">"De Principiis Cogitandi."</Q> This I shall shortly give the Reader: But the sonnet, being completed, I reserve for publication amongst the rest of his Poems.</P>
<P>It may seem somewhat extraordinary, that Mr. Gray never attempted any thing in English verse, (except the beginning of Agrippina, and a few translations) before the first Ode lately mentioned. Shall we attribute this to his having been educated at Eton, or to what other cause? Certain it is, that when I first knew him, he seemed to set a greater value on his Latin poetry, than on that which he had composed in his native language; and had almost the same foible then, which I have since known him laugh at in Petrarch, when we read that most entertaining of all books, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Memories pour la vie de François Pe∣trarque tirés de ses oeuvres,"</Q> &amp;c. I am apt to think that the
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
little popularity which M. de Polignac's Anti-Lucretius ac∣quired, after it had been so long and so eagerly expected by the learned, induced Mr. Gray to lay aside his didactic Plan. How∣ever this may be, he writ no Latin verse after this period; ex∣cept perhaps some part of the 1 st book of the Poem just men∣tioned. This therefore seems the proper place to introduce that fragment; which being the most considerable in itself of all his Latin Compositions, and perhaps the most laboured of any of his Poems, it were to be wished that I could give the reader more insight into his design, than the few scattered pa∣pers, which he has left, enable me to do. It is clear, how∣ever, from the Exordium itself, that he meant to make the same use of Mr. Locke's Essay on the human Understanding, which Lucretius did of the Dogmas of Epicurus. And the first six lines plainly intimate, that his general design was to be com∣prized in four books.</P>
<P>The 1st. On the origin of our Ideas.
<Q><L>Unde Animus scire incipiat—</L></Q></P>
<P>The 2d. On the distribution of these Ideas in the Memory.<Q><L>—quibus inchoet orsa</L>
<L>Principiis seriem rerum, tenuemque catenam</L>
<L>Mnemosyne—</L></Q></P>
<P>The 3d. On the Province of Reason and its gradual improve∣ment.<Q><L>—Ratio unde, rudi sub pectore, tardum</L>
<L>Augeat imperium—</L></Q></P>
<P>The 4th. On the Cause and Effects of the Passions.<Q><L>—&amp; primum mortalibus aegris</L>
<L>Ira, Dolor, Metus, &amp; Curae nascantur inanes.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162"/>
But he has not drawn out any of the Arguments of these Books, except a part of the first; and that only so far as he ex∣ecuted of it. This it will be proper here to insert; and also, for the ease of the reader, to repeat the several parts at the bottom of the subsequent pages.</P>
<P>General plan of the Poem.—First, Invocation to Mr. Locke. Address to Favonius, shewing the use and importance of the design.—Beginning.—Connection of the soul and body; Nerves, the instruments of sensation.—Touch, the first and most exten∣sive sense, described.—Begins before the birth; Pain, our first idea when born.—Seeing, the second sense.—Digressive enco∣mium of Light. The gradual opening and improvement of this sense, and that of Hearing, their connection with the higher fa∣culties of the Mind; Sense of Beauty and Order and Harmony annexed to them. From the latter, our delight in Eloquence, Poetry, and Music derived.—Office of the Taste and Smell.—Internal sense of Reflection, whereby the mind views its own powers and operations, compared to a young Wood-nymph admiring herself in some fountain.—Admission of Ideas, some by a single sense, some by two, others by every way of Sensa∣tion and Reflection. Instance in a Person born blind, he has no ideas of Light and Colours; but he has those of Figure, Mo∣tion, Extension, and Space, (objects both of the sight and touch.) Third sort, those which make their entrance into the mind by every channel alike; as Pleasure, and Pain, Power, Existence, Unity, and Succession. Properties of Bodies, whereby they make themselves known to us. Primary quali∣ties: Magnitude, Solidity, Mobility, Texture, and Figure. ***</P>

This gives to his Versification its last and most exquisite grace, and leaves the ear fully satisfied. Mr. Gray could not fail to observe, and of course to aim at this happy effect of Elisions in a concluding Line: of which the present Poem, in particular, affords indubitable and abundant proofs.</NOTE></L>

<HEAD>SECTION THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE three foregoing Sections have carried the Reader through the juvenile part of Mr. Gray's life, and nearly, alas, to half of its duration. Those which remain, though less diversified by incidents, will, notwithstanding, I flatter myself, be equally instructive and amusing, as several of his most inti∣mate friends have very kindly furnished me with their collec∣tions of his letters; which, added to those I have myself preser∣ved, will enable me to select from them many excellent speci∣mens of his more mature judgment, correct taste, and extensive learning, blended at the same time with many amiable instances of his sensibility: they will also specify the few remaining anecdotes, which occurred in a life so retired and sedentary as his: for the Reader must be here informed that, from the winter of the year 1742 to the day of his death, his principal residence was at Cambridge. He indeed, during the lives of his mother and aunts, spent his summer vacations at Stoke; and, after they died, in making little tours on visits to his friends in different parts of the country: But he was seldom ab∣sent from college any considerable time, except between the years 1759 and 1762; when, on the opening of the British Musaeum, he took lodgings in Southampton Row, in order to
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
have recourse to the Harleian and other Manuscripts there de∣posited, from which he made several curious extracts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These, amounting in all to a tolerably-sized folio, are at present in Mr. Wal∣pole's hands. He has already printed the speech of Sir Thomas Wyat from them in the second number of his Miscellaneous Antiquities. The Public must impute it to their own want of curiosity if more of them do not appear in print.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may seem strange that a person who had conceived so early a dislike to Cambridge, and who (as we shall see presently) now returned to it with this prejudice rather augmented, should, when he was free to choose, make that very place his principal abode for near thirty years: But this I think may be easily accounted for from his love of books, (ever his ruling passion) and the straitness of his circumstances which prevented the gratification of it. For to a man, who could not conveniently purchase even a small library, what situation so eligible as that which affords free access to a number of large ones? This reason also accounts for another singular fact. We have seen that, during his residence at Stoke, in the spring and summer of this same year 1742, he writ a considerable part of his more finished poems. Hence one would be naturally led to conclude that, on his return to Cambridge, when the ceremony of taking his degree was over, the quiet of the place would have prompted him to continue the cultivation of his poetical ta∣lents, and that immediately, as the Muse seems in this year to have peculiarly inspired him; but this was not the case. Reading, he has often told me, was much more agreeable to him than writing: He therefore now laid aside composition almost entirely, and applied himself with intense assiduity to the study of the best Greek authors; insomuch that, in the
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
space of about six years, there were hardly any writers of note in that language which he had not only read but digested; remark∣ing, by the mode of common-place, their contents, their dif∣ficult and corrupt passages, and all this with the accuracy of a critic added to the diligence of a student.</P>
<P>Before I insert the next series of letters, I must take the li∣berty to mention, that it was not till about the year 1747 that I had the happiness of being introduced to the acquaintance of Mr. Gray. Some very juvenile imitations of Milton's juvenile poems, which I had written a year or two before, and of which the Monody on Mr. Pope's death was the principal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The other two were in imitation of <Q REND="inline">"l'Allegro &amp; il Penseroso,"</Q> and intitled <Q REND="inline">"Il Bellicoso &amp; il Pacifico."</Q> The latter of these I was persuaded to revise and publish in the Cambridge Collection of Verses on the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748. The former has since got into a Miscellany, printed by G. Pearch, from the indiscretion, I suppose, of some acquaintance who had a copy of it.</NOTE>, he then, at the request of one of my friends, was so obliging as to revise. The same year, on account of a dispute which had happened between the master and fellows of Pembroke Hall, I had the honour of being nominated by the Fellows to fill one of the vacant Fellowships<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tho' nominated in 1747, I was not elected Fellow till February, 1749. The Master having refused his assent, claiming a negative, the affair was there∣fore not compromised till after an ineffectual litigation of two years.</NOTE>. I was at this time scholar of St. John's College, and Batchelor of Arts, personally un∣known to the gentlemen who favoured me so highly; therefore that they gave me this mark of distinction and preference was greatly owing to Mr. Gray, who was well acquainted with several of that society, and to Dr. Heberden, whose known
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
partiality to every, even the smallest degree of merit, led him warmly to second his recommendation. The Reader, I hope, will excuse this short piece of egotism, as it is written to express my gratitude, as well to the living as the dead, to declare the sense I shall ever retain of the honour which the Fellows of Pembroke Hall then did me, and to particularize the time of an incident which brought me into the neighbour∣hood of Mr. Gray's College; and served to give that cement to our future intimacy, which is usually rendered stronger by proximity of place.</P>
<P>The Letters, which I select for this Section, are from the date of the year 1742 to that of 1768, when Mr. Gray was made Professor of Modern History. This, as it is a consider∣able interval of time, will perhaps require me the more fre∣quently to resume my narrative; especially as I cannot now produce one continued chain of correspondence.</P>

thing has not happened above twice within this last age to mor∣tal man, and no one here can conceive what it may portend. You have heard, I suppose, how I have been employed a part of the time; how, by my own indefatigable application for these ten years past, and by the care and vigilance of that worthy magistrate the Man in Blue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A Servant of the Vice-Chancellor's for the time being, usually known by the name of Blue Coat, whose business it is to attend Acts for Degrees, &amp;c.</NOTE>, (who, I assure you, has not spa∣red his labour, nor could have done more for his own Son) I am got half way to the top of Jurisprudence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> Batchelor of Civil Law.</NOTE>, and bid as fair as an∣other body to open a case of impotency with all decency and circumspection. You see my ambition. I do not doubt but some thirty years hence I shall convince the world and you that I am a very pretty young fellow; and may come to shine in a profession, perhaps the noblest of all except man-midwifery. As for you, if your distemper and you can but agree about go∣ing to London, I may reasonably expect in a much shorter time to see you in your three-cornered villa, doing the honours of a well-furnished table with as much dignity, as rich a mien, and as capacious a belly, as Dr. Mead. Methinks I see Dr. **, at the lower end of it, lost in admiration of your goodly person and parts, cramming down his Envy (for it will rise) with the wing of a Pheasant, and drowning it in neat Burgundy. But not to tempt your Asthma too much with such a prospect, I should think you might be almost as happy and as great as this even in the country. But you know best, and I should be sorry to say any thing that might stop you in the career of Glory; far be it from me to hamper the wheels of your gilded chariot. Go on, Sir Thomas; and when you die, (for even Physicians must die)
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
may the faculty in Warwick-lane erect your statue in the very niche of Sir John Cutler's.</P>
<P>I was going to tell you how sorry I am for your illness, but I hope it is too late now: I can only say that I really was very sorry. May you live a hundred Christmasses, and eat as many collars of brawn stuck with rosemary. Adieu, &amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Though I have said that Mr. Gray, on his return to Cam∣bridge, laid aside Poetry almost entirely, yet I find amongst his papers a small fragment in verse, which bears internal evidence that it was written about this very time. The foregoing Letter, in which he employs so much of his usual vein of ridicule on the University, seems to be no improper introduction to it: I shall therefore insert it here without making any apology, as I have given one, on a similar occasion, in the first section.</P>
<P>It seems to have been intended as a Hymn or Address to Ig∣norance; and I presume, had he proceeded with it, would have contained much good Satire upon false Science and scholastic Pedantry. What he writ of it is purely introductory; yet many of the lines are so strong, and the general cast of the versifica∣tion so musical, that I believe it will give the generality of Readers a higher opinion of his poetical Talents, than many of his Lyrical Productions have done. I speak of the Generality; because it is a certain fact, that their taste is founded upon the ten-syllable couplets of Dryden and Pope, and upon these only.</P>

<P>YOU write so feelingly to Mr. Brown, and represent your abandoned condition in terms so touching, that what gra∣titude could not effect in several months, compassion has brought about in a few days; and broke that strong attach∣ment, or rather allegiance, which I and all here owe to our sovereign Lady and Mistress, the President of Presidents and Head of Heads, (if I may be permitted to pronounce her name, that ineffable Octogrammaton) the power of Laziness. You must know she had been pleased to appoint me (in preference to so many old servants of her's who had spent their whole lives in qualifying themselves for the office) Grand Picker of Straws and Push-pin Player to her Supinity (for that is her title). The first is much in the nature of Lord President of the Council; and the other, like the Groom-Porter, only with∣out
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
the profit; but as they are both things of very great ho∣nour in this country, I considered with myself the load of Envy attending such great charges; and besides (between you and me) I found myself unable to support the fatigue of keep∣ing up the appearance that persons of such dignity must do, so I thought proper to decline it, and excused myself as well as I could. However, as you see such an affair must take up a good deal of time, and it has always been the Policy of this court to proceed slowly, like the Imperial and that of Spain, in the dispatch of Business, you will on this account the easier forgive me, if I have not answered your Letter be∣fore.</P>
<P>You desire to know, it seems, what Character the Poem of your young friend bears here<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pleasures of the Imagination: from the posthumous publication of Dr. Akin∣side's Poems, it should seem that the Author had very much the same Opinion afterwards of his own Work, which Mr. Gray here expresses: since he undertook a reform of it which must have given him, had he concluded it, as much trouble as if he had written it entirely new.</NOTE>. I wonder that you ask the opinion of a Nation, where those, who pretend to judge, do not judge at all; and the rest (the wiser part) wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them; that is, Dick's and the Rainbow Coffee-houses. Your readier way would be to ask the Ladies that keep the Bars in those two theatres of Criticism. However, to shew you that I am a judge, as well as my Countrymen, I will tell you, though I have rather turned it over than read it, (but no matter; no more have they) that it seems to me above the middling; and now and then, for a little while, rises even to the best, par∣ticularly in description. It is often obscure, and even unin∣telligible;
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
and too much infected with the Hutchinson jargon. In short, its great fault is, that it was published at least nine years too early. And so methinks in a few words, <Q REND="inline">"à là mode du Temple,"</Q> I have very pertly dispatched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself.</P>
<P>You are much in the right to have a taste for Socrates; he was a divine man. I must tell you, by way of news of the place, that the other day a certain new Professor made an Apology for him an hour long in the schools; and all the world brought in Socrates guilty, except the people of his own College.</P>
<P>The Muse is gone, and left me in far worse company; if she returns, you will hear of her. As to her child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He here means his Poem <Q REND="inline">"De Principiis Cogitandi."</Q> See the last Section.</NOTE> (since you are so good as to enquire after it) it is but a puling chit yet, not a bit grown to speak of; I believe, poor thing, it has got the worms that will carry it off at last. Mr. Trollope and I are in a course of Tar-Water; he for his present, and I for my future distempers. If you think it will kill me, send away a man and horse directly; for I drink like a Fish.</P>

<P>I Would make you an excuse, (as indeed I ought) if they were a sort of thing I ever gave any credit to myself in these cases; but I know they are never true. Nothing so silly as In∣dolence when it hopes to disguise itself: every one knows it by its saunter, as they do his Majesty (God bless him) at a Mas∣querade, by the firmness of his tread and the elevation of his chin. However, somewhat I had to say that has a little sha∣dow of reason in it. I have been in Town (I suppose you know) flaunting about at all kind of public places with two friends lately returned from abroad. The world itself has some attractions in it to a solitary of six years standing; and agree∣able well-meaning people of sense (thank Heaven there are so few of them) are my peculiar Magnet. It is no wonder then if I felt some reluctance at parting with them so soon; or if my spirits, when I returned back to my cell, should sink for a time, not indeed to storm and tempest, but a good deal below change∣able. Besides, Seneca says (and my pitch of philosophy does not pretend to be much above Seneca) <Q REND="inline">"Nunquam mores, quos extuli, refero. Aliquid ex eo quod composui, turbatur: ali∣quid ex his, quae fugavi, redit."</Q> And it will happen to such
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
as us, mere imps of Science. Well it may, when Wisdom herself is forced often<Q><L>in sweet retired Solitude</L>
<L>To plume her feathers, and let grow her wings,</L>
<L>That in the various bustle of Resort</L>
<L>Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impair'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is a foolish thing that without Money one cannot either live as one pleases, or where and with whom one pleases. Swift somewhere says, that Money is Liberty; and I fear Mo∣ney is Friendship too and Society, and almost every external blessing. It is a great, though an ill-natured, Comfort, to see most of those who have it in plenty, without Pleasure, without Liberty, and without Friends.</P>
<P>I am not altogether of your opinion as to your historical con∣solation in time of trouble: A calm Melancholy it may produce, a stiller sort of despair (and that only in some circumstances, and on some constitutions); but I doubt no real comfort or content can ever arise in the human mind, but from Hope.</P>
<P>I take it very ill you should have been in the twentieth year of the War<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Thucydides, L. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>, and yet say nothing of the retreat before Syracuse: Is it, or is it not, the finest thing you ever read in your life? And how does Xenophon or Plutarch agree with you? For my part I read Aristotle, his Poetics, Politics, and Morals; though I do not well know which is which. In the first place, he is the hardest author by far I ever meddled with. Then he has a dry conciseness, that makes one imagine one is perusing a table of contents rather than a book: it tastes for all the world
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
like chop'd hay, or rather like chop'd logic; for he has a violent affection to that art, being in some sort his own invention; so that he often loses himself in little trifling distinctions and verbal niceties; and, what is worse, leaves you to extricate him as well as you can. Thirdly, he has suffered vastly from the transcribblers, as all authors of great brevity necessarily must. Fourthly and lastly, he has abundance of fine uncommon things, which make him well worth the pains he gives one. You see what you are to expect from him.</P>

<P>I Had been absent from this place a few days, and at my return found Cibber's book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Entitled <Q REND="inline">"Observations on Cicero's Character,"</Q> or some such thing; for I have not the book by me, and it has been long since forgot.</NOTE> upon my table: I return you my thanks for it, and have already run over a considerable part; for who could resist Mrs. Letitia Pilkington's recom∣mendation? (By the way, is there any such gentlewoman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Lady made herself more known some time after the date of this letter.</NOTE>? or has somebody put on the style of a scribbling woman's panegyric to deceive and laugh at Colley?) He seems to me full as pert and as dull as usual. There are whole pages of common∣place stuff, that for stupidity might have been wrote by Dr. Waterland, or any other grave divine, did not the flirting saucy phrase give them at a distance an air of youth and gaiety: It is
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
very true, he is often in the right with regard to Tully's weak∣nesses; but was there any one that did not see them? Those, I imagine, that would find a man after God's own heart, are no more likely to trust the Doctor's recommendation than the Player's; and as to Reason and Truth, would they know their own faces, do you think, if they looked in the glass, and saw themselves so bedizened in tattered fringe and tarnished lace, in French jewels, and dirty furbelows, the frippery of a stroller's wardrobe?</P>
<P>Literature, to take it in its most comprehensive sense, and include every thing that requires invention or judgment, or barely application and industry, seems indeed drawing apace to its dissolution, and remarkably since the beginning of the war. I remember to have read Mr. Spence's pretty book; though (as he then had not been at Rome for the last time) it must have increased greatly since that in bulk. If you ask me what I read, I protest I do not recollect one syllable; but only in general, that they were the best bred sort of men in the world, just the kind of <HI>frinds</HI> one would wish to meet in a fine sum∣mer's evening, if one wished to meet any at all. The heads and tails of the dialogues, published separate in 16mo, would make the sweetest reading in <HI>natiur</HI> for young gentlemen of family and fortune, that are learning to dance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ridicule on the Platonic way of dialogue (as it was aimed to be, tho' nothing less resembles it) is, in my opinion, admirable. Lord Shaftsbury was the first who brought it into vogue, and Mr. Spence (if we except a few Scotch writers) the last who practised it. As it has now been laid aside some years, we may hope, for the sake of true taste, that this frippery mode of composition will never come into fashion again; especially since Dr. Hurd has pointed out, by example as well as precept, wherein the true beauty of Dialogue-writing consists.</NOTE>. I rejoice to
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
hear there is such a crowd of dramatical performances coming upon the stage. Agrippina can stay very well, she thanks you, and be damned at leisure: I hope in God you have not men∣tioned, or shewed to any body that scene (for trusting in its badness, I forgot to caution you concerning it); but I heard the other day, that I was writing a Play, and was told the name of it, which nobody here could know, I am sure. The employment you propose to me much better suits my incli∣nation; but I much fear our joint-stock would hardly com∣pose a small volume; what I have is less considerable than you would imagine, and of that little we should not be willing to publish all. *** <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">What is here omitted was a short catalogue of Mr. West's Poetry then in Mr. Gray's hands; the reader has seen as much of it in the three foregoing sections as I am persuaded his friend would have published, had he prosecuted the task which Mr. Walpole recommended to him, that of printing his own and Mr. West's Poems in the same volume; and which we also perceive from this letter, he was not averse from doing. This therefore seems to vindicate the Editor's plan in arranging these papers; as he is enabled by it not only to shew what Mr. West would have been, but what Mr. Gray was, I mean not as a Poet, for that the world knew before, but as an universal Scholar, and (what is still of more consequence) as an excellent moral Man.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is all I can any where find. You, I imagine, may have a good deal more. I should not care how unwise the or∣dinary run of Readers might think my affection for him, pro∣vided those few, that ever loved any body, or judged of any thing rightly, might, from such little remains, be moved to consider what he would have been; and to wish that heaven had granted him a longer life and a mind more at ease.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Cambridge,</HI> <DATE>1747.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have abundance of thanks to return you for the entertain∣ment Mr. Spence's book has given me, which I have al∣most run over already; and I much fear (see what it is to make a figure) the breadth of the margin, and the neatness of the prints, which are better done than one could expect, have pre∣vailed upon me to like it far better than I did in manuscript; for I think it is not the very genteel deportment of Polymetis, nor the lively wit of Mysagetes, that have at all corrupted me.</P>
<P>There is one fundamental fault, from whence most of the little faults throughout the whole arise. He professes to ne∣glect the Greek writers, who could have given him more in∣struction on the very heads he professes to treat, than all the others put together; who does not know, that upon the Latin, the Sabine, and Hetruscan mythology (which probably might themselves, at a remoter period of time, owe their origin to Greece too) the Romans ingrafted almost the whole religion of Greece to make what is called their own? It would be hard
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
to find any one circumstance that is properly of their invention. In the ruder days of the republic, the picturesque part of their religion (which is the province he has chose, and would be thought to confine himself to) was probably borrowed entirely from the Tuscans, who, as a wealthy and trading people, may be well supposed, and indeed are known, to have had the arts flourishing in a considerable degree among them. What could inform him here, but Dio. Halicarnassus (who expressly treats of those times with great curiosity and industry) and the remains of the first Roman writers? The former he has neglected as a Greek; and the latter, he says, were but little acquainted with the arts, and consequently are but of small authority. In the better ages, when every temple and public building in Rome was peopled with imported deities and heroes, and when all the artists of reputation they made use of were Greeks, what wonder, if their eyes grew familiarised to Grecian forms and habits (especially in a matter of this kind, where so much de∣pends upon the imagination); and if those figures introduced with them a belief of such fables, as first gave them being, and dressed them out in their various attributes, it was natu∣ral then, and (I should think) necessary, to go to the source itself, the Greek accounts of their own religion; but, to say the truth, I suspect he was little conversant in those books and that language; for he rarely quotes any but Lucian, an author that falls in every body's way, and who lived at the very ex∣tremity of that period he has set to his enquiries, later than any of the poets he has meddled with, and for that reason ought to have been regarded as but an indifferent authority; especially being a Syrian too. His book (as he says himself) is, I think, rather a beginning than a perfect work; but a beginning at the
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
wrong end: For if any body should finish it by enquiring into the Greek mythology, as he proposes, it will be necessary to read it backward.</P>
<P>There are several little neglects, that one might have told him of, which I noted in reading it hastily; as page 311, a dis∣course about orange-trees, occasioned by Virgil's <Q REND="inline">"inter ode∣ratum lauri nemus,"</Q> where he fancies the Roman Laurus to be our Laurel; tho' undoubtedly the bay-tree, which is <HI>odora∣tum,</HI> and (I believe) still called Lauro, or Alloro, at Rome; and that the <Q REND="inline">"Malum Medicum"</Q> in the Georgick is the orange; tho' Theophrastus, whence Virgil borrowed it, or even Pliny whom he himself quotes, might convince him it is the cedrato which he has often tasted at Florence. Page 144 is an account of Domenichino's Cardinal Virtues, and a fling at the Jesuits, neither of which belong to them: The painting is in a church of the Barnabiti, dedicated to St. Carlo Borromeo, whose motto is HUMILITAS. Page 151, in a note, he says, the old Romans did not regard Fortune as a Deity; tho' Servius Tullius (whom she was said to be in love with; nay, there was ac∣tually an affair between them) founded her temple in Foro Boario. By the way, her worship was Greek, and this king was educated in the family of Tarquinius Priscus, whose father was a Corinthian; so it is easy to conceive how early the reli∣gion of Rome might be mixed with that of Greece, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dr. Middleton has sent me to-day a book on the Roman Senate, the substance of a dispute between Lord Hervey and him, tho' it never interrupted <HI>their</HI> friendship, he says, and I dare say not.</P>

<P>AS one ought to be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of condolence, it would be a sensible satisfaction to me (before I testify my sorrow, and the sincere part I take in your misfortune) to know for certain, who it is I lament. I knew Zara and Selima, (Selima, was it? or Fati∣ma) or rather I knew them both together; for I cannot justly say which was which. Then as to your handsome Cat, the name you distinguish her by, I am no less at a loss, as well knowing one's handsome cat is always the cat one likes best; or, if one be alive and the other dead, it is usually the latter that is the handsomest. Besides, if the point were never so clear, I hope you do not think me so ill-bred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my interest in the surviver: Oh no! I would rather seem to mistake, and imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this sad accident. Till this affair is a little better determined, you will excuse me if I do not be∣gin to cry:

Aegyptian history, and particularly the account of the gold mines? My own readings have been cruelly interrupted: What I have been highly pleased with, is the new Comedy from Paris by Gresset, called le Mechant; if you have it not, buy his works altogether in two little volumes, they are collected by the Dutch booksellers, and consequently contain some trash; but then there are the Ver-vert, the Epistle to P. Bougeant, the Chartreuse, that to his sister, an Ode on his country, and another on Mediocrity, and the Sidnei, another Comedy, all which have great beauties: There is also a Poem lately published by Thompson, called the Castle of Indolence, with some good stanzas in it. Mr. Mason is my acquaintance; I liked that Ode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ode to a Water Nymph, published about this time in Dodsley's Miscellany.

<P>I Am glad you have had any pleasure in Gresset; he seems to me a truly elegant and charming writer; the Mechant is the best Comedy I ever read; his Edward I could scarce get through; it is puerile; though there are good lines, such as this for example:
<Q><L>" Le jour d'un nouveau regne est le jour des ingrats."</L></Q>
But good lines will make any thing rather than a good play: However you are to consider this is a collection made up by the Dutch booksellers; many things unfinished, or written in his youth, or designed not for the world, but to make his friends laugh, as the Lutrin vivant, &amp;c. There are two noble lines; which, as they are in the middle of an Ode to the King, may perhaps have escaped you.
<Q><L>" Le cri d'un peuple heureux est la seule eloquence,</L>
<L>" Qui sçait parler des Rois."</L></Q>
Which is very true, and should have been a hint to himself not to write Odes to the King at all.</P>
<P>As I have nothing more to say at present, I fill my paper with the beginning of an Essay; what name to give it I know not; but the subject is the Alliance of Education and Govern∣ment: I mean to shew that they must both concur to produce great and useful men. I desire your judgment upon it before I proceed any further.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="195"/>
The first fifty-seven verses of an Ethical Essay accompanied this letter, which I shall here insert, with about fifty lines more, all of them finished in his highest manner. Had this noble de∣sign been compleated, I may, with great boldness, assert that it would have been one of the most capital Poems of the kind that ever appeared either in our own, or any language. I am not able to inform the reader how many Essays he meant to write upon the subject; nor do I believe that he had ever so far settled his plan as to determine that point: But since his theme was as extensive as human nature, (an observation he himself makes in a subsequent letter on the <Q REND="inline">"Esprit des Loix"</Q>) it is plain the whole work would have been considerable in point of size. He was busily employed in it at the time when M. de Montesquieu's book was first published: On reading it, he said the Baron had forestalled some of his best thoughts; and yet the reader will find, from the small fragment he has left, that the two writers differ a little in one very material point, viz. the influence of soil and climate on national manners.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>L'Esprit des Loix, Liv. 14. chap. 2, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE> Some time after he had thoughts of resuming his plan, and of dedicating it, by an introductory Ode, to M. de Montesquieu; but that great man's death, which happened in 1755, made him drop his design finally.</P>
<P>On carefully reviewing the scattered papers in prose, which he writ, as hints for his own use in the prosecution of this work, I think it best to form part of them into a kind of com∣mentary at the bottom of the pages; they will serve greatly to elucidate (as far as they go) the method of his reasoning.</P>
<Q><PB N="193" REF="196"/><LG>
<HEAD>ESSAY I. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>COMMENTARY.</P>
<P>The Author's subject being (as we have seen) THE NECESSARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN A GOOD FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD MODE OF EDU∣CATION, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND, the Poem opens with two similes; an uncommon kind of exordium: but which I suppose the Poet intentionally chose, to intimate the analogical method he meant to pursue in his subsequent reasonings. 1st, He asserts thàt men without education are like sickly plants in a cold or barren soil, (line 1 to 5, and 8 to 12;) and, 2dly, he compares them, when unblest with a just and well regulated government, to plants that will not blossom or bear fruit in an unkindly and inclement air (l. 5 to 9, and l. 13 to 22). Having thus laid down the two propositions he means to prove, he begins by examining into the characteristics which (taking a general view of mankind) all men have in common one with another (l. 22 to 39); they covet pleasure and avoid pain (l. 31); they feel gratitude for benefits (l. 34); they desire to avenge wrongs, which they effect either by force or cunning (l. 35); they are linked to each other by their common feelings, and participate in sorrow and in joy (l. 36, 37). If then all the human species agree in so many moral particulars, whence arises the diversity of national characters? This question the Poet puts at line 38, and dilates upon to l. 64. Why, says he, have some na∣tions shewn a propensity to commerce and industry; others to war and rapine; others to ease and pleasure? (l. 42 to 46) Why have the Northern people over∣spread, in all ages, and prevailed over the Southern? (l. 46 to 58) Why has Asia been, time out of mind, the seat of despotism, and Europe that of freedom? (l. 59 to 64.) Are we from these instances to imagine men necessarily enslaved to the inconveniences of the climate where they were born? (l. 64 to 72) Or are we not rather to suppose there is a natural strength in the human mind, that is able to vanquish and break through them? (l. 72 to 84) It is confest, how∣ever, that men receive an early tincture from the situation they are placed in, and the climate which produces them (l. 84 to 88). Thus the inhabitants of the mountains, inured to labour and patience, are naturally trained to war (l. 88 to 96); while those of the plain are more open to any attack, and softened by ease and plenty (l. 96 to 99). Again, the Aegyptians, from the nature of their situation, might be the inventors of home-navigation, from a necessity of keeping up an intercourse between their towns during the inundation of the Nile (l. 99 to ****). Those persons would naturally have the first turn to commerce, who inhabited a barren coast like the Tyrians, and were persecuted by some neighbouring tyrant; or were drove to take refuge on some shoals, like the Venetian and Hollander; their discovery of some rich island, in the infancy of the world, described. The Tartar hardened to war by his rigorous climate and pastoral life, and by his disputes for water and herbage in a country without land-marks, as also by skirmishes between his rival clans, was consequently fitted to conquer his rich Southern neighbours, whom ease and luxury had enervated: Yet this is no proof that liberty and valour may not exist in Southern climes, since the Syrians and Carthaginians gave noble instances of both; and the Ara∣bians carried their conquests as far as the Tartars. Rome also (for many cen∣turies) repulsed those very nations, which, when she grew weak, at length demolished <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Reader will perceive that the Commentary goes further than the Text. The reason for which is, that the Editor found it so on the paper from which he formed that comment; and as the thoughts seemed to be those which Mr. Gray would have next graced with the harmony of his numbers, he held it best to give them in continuation. There are other maxims on different papers, all apparently relating to the same subject, which are too excellent to be lost; these therefore (as the place in which he meant to employ them cannot be ascertained) I shall subjoin to this note, under the title of detached Sentiments.</P>
<Q><P>"Man is a creature not capable of cultivating his mind but in society, and in that only where he is not a slave to the necessities of life.</P>
<P>Want is the mother of the inferior arts, but ease that of the finer; as elo∣quence, policy, morality, poetry, sculpture, painting, architecture, which are the improvements of the former.</P>
<P>The climate inclines some nations to contemplation and pleasure; others to hardship, action, and war; but not so as to incapacitate the former for courage and discipline, or the latter for civility, politeness, and works of genius.</P>
<P>It is the proper work of education and government united to redress the faults that arise from the soil and air.</P>
<P>The principal drift of education should be to make men <HI>think</HI> in the Northern climates, and <HI>act</HI> in the Southern.</P>
<P>The different steps and degrees of education may be compared to the artificer's operations upon marble; it is one thing to dig it out of the quarry, and another to square it; to give it gloss and lustre, call forth every beautiful spot and vein, shape it into a column, or animate it into a statue.</P>
<P>To a native of free and happy governments his country is alway dear:
<Q><L>" He loves his old hereditary trees."</L>
<BIBL>COWLEY.</BIBL></Q>
While the subject of a tyrant has no country; he is therefore selfish and base∣minded; he has no family, no posterity, no desire of fame; or, if he has, of one that turns not on its proper object.</P>
<P>Any nation that wants public spirit, neglects education, ridicules the desire of fame, and even of virtue and reason, must be ill governed.</P>
<P>Commerce changes intirely the fate and genius of nations, by communicating arts and opinions, circulating money, and introducing the materials of luxury; she first opens and polishes the mind, then corrupts and enervates both that and the body.</P>
<P>Those invasions of effeminate Southern nations by the warlike Northern people, seem (in spite of all the terror, mischief, and ignorance which they brought with them) to be necessary evils; in order to revive the spirit of mankind, softened and broken by the arts of commerce, to restore them to their native liberty and equality, and to give them again the power of supporting danger and hardship; so a comet, with all the horrors that attend it as it passes through our system, brings a supply of warmth and light to the sun, and of moisture to the air.</P>
<P>The doctrine of Epicurus is ever ruinous to society: It had its rise when Greece was declining, and perhaps hastened its dissolution, as also that of Rome; it is now propagated in France and in England, and seems likely to produce the same effect in both.</P>
<P>One principal characteristic of vice in the present age is the contempt of fame.</P>
<P>Many are the uses of good fame to a generous mind: it extends our existence and example into future ages; continues and propagates virtue, which otherwise would be as short-lived as our frame; and prevents the prevalence of vice in a generation more corrupt even than our own. It is impossible to conquer that na∣tural desire we have of being remembered; even criminal ambition and avarice, the most selfish of all passions, would wish to leave a name behind them."</P></Q>
<P>I find also among these papers a single couplet much too beautiful to be lost, though the place where he meant to introduce it cannot be ascertained; it must, however, have made a part of some description of the effect which the reforma∣tion had on our national manners:
<Q><L>When Love could teach a monarch to be wise,</L>
<L>And Gospel-light first dawn'd from BULLEN's Eyes.</L></Q>
Thus, with all the attention that a connoisseur in painting employs in collecting every slight outline as well as finished drawing which led to the completion of some capital picture, I have endeavoured to preserve every fragment of this great poetical design. It surely deserved this care, as it was one of the noblest which Mr. Gray ever attempted; and also, as far as he carried it into execution, the most exquisitely finished. That he carried it no further is, and must ever be, a most sensible loss to the republic of letters.</P></NOTE> her extensive Empire. ****</P></NOTE></HEAD>

Many successive incursions, attended with every kind of desolation, are enume∣rated by historians; particularly those, in A. D. 252, during the reign of Gallus and Volusianus, and in 261, under that of Gallienus. Under the Greek emperors also, to mention only the years 1053 and 1191, it appears that the Scythians still continued their accustomed ravages. In later times, the like spirit of sudden and destructive invasion has constantly prevailed; and these same Scythians, under their modern name of Tartars, have at different periods, over-run Asia, and even some parts of Europe: it is sufficient, on this point, to recall to the reader's memory the names of Gingis-Chan, Octaï, and Tamerlane.</NOTE>Has Scythia breath'd the living cloud of war;</L>

The reader will readily recollect the expedition of the Teutones, who joined the Cimbri, when they invaded the Roman territories to the united amount, it is said, of 300,000 fighting men; the many inroads of the Germans into Gaul, under the conduct of Ariovistus; and the numerous irruptions, in∣to the Roman empire, of the Suevi, the Goths, the Vandals, and lastly of the Lombards; most of which nations came originally from the coasts here mentioned.

The Nor∣mans, who came originally from Norway and Scandinavia, having, after a cen∣tury of ravages, settled themselves in Neustria (since called Normandy) in 1912, were invited into the southern parts of Italy, in the year 1018, by Gaimar prince of Salerno.

<P>YOU ask for some account of books. The principal I can tell you of is a work of the President Montesquieu, the labour of twenty years; it is called L'Esprit des Loix, 2 vol. 4to, printed at Geneva. He lays down the principles on which are founded the three sorts of government, Despotism, the limited Monarchy, and the Republican; and shews how
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>
from these are deduced the laws and customs by which they are guided and maintained; the education proper to each form; the influence of climate, situation, religion, &amp;c. on the minds of particular nations and on their policy. The subject, you see, is as extensive as mankind; the thoughts perfectly new, generally admirable as they are just, sometimes a little too re∣fined. In short, there are faults, but such as an ordinary man could never have committed. The style very lively and concise (consequently sometimes obscure); it is the gravity of Tacitus,
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
whom he admires, tempered with the gaiety and fire of a Frenchman. The time of night will not suffer me to go on; but I will write again in a week.</P>

<P>I Perceive that second parts are as bad to write as they can be to read; for this, which you ought to have had a week after the first, has been a full month in coming forth. The spirit of laziness (the spirit of the place) begins to possess even me, who have so long declaimed against it; yet has it not so prevailed, but that I feel that discontent with myself, that ennui, that ever accompanies it in its beginnings. Time will settle my conscience; time will reconcile me to this languid com∣panion: We shall smoke, we shall tipple, we shall doze toge∣ther: We shall have our little jokes like other people, and our old stories: Brandy will finish what Port began; and a month after the time you will see in some corner of a London Even∣ing-Post, <Q REND="inline">"Yesterday died the Reverend Mr. John Gray, Se∣nior Fellow of Clare-Hall, a facetious companion, and well respected by all that knew him. His death is supposed to have been occasioned by a fit of an apoplexy, being found fallen out of bed with his head in the chamber-pot."</Q></P>
<P>In the meanwhile, to go on with my account of new books. Montesquieu's work, which I mentioned before, is now pub∣lishing anew in 2 vols. octavo. Have you seen old Crebillion's Catalina, a Tragedy, which has had a prodigious run at Paris? Historical truth is too much perverted in it, which is ridiculous in a story so generally known; but if you can get over this, the
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
sentiments and versification are fine, and most of the characters (particularly the principal one) painted with great spirit.</P>
<P>Mr. Birch, the indefatigable, has just put out a thick octavo of original papers of Queen Elizabeth's time; there are many curious things in it, particularly letters from Sir Robert Cecil (Salisbury) about his negotiations with Henry IV. of France, the Earl of Monmouth's odd account of Queen Elizabeth's death, several peculiarities of James I. and Prince Henry, &amp;c. and above all, an excellent account of the state of France, with characters of the king, his court, and ministry, by Sir George Carew, ambassador there. This, I think, is all new worth mentioning, that I have seen or heard of; except a Natural History of Peru, in Spanish, printed at London, by Don <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> something, a man of learning, sent thither by that court on purpose.</P>
<P>You ask after my chronology. It was begun, as I told you, almost two years ago, when I was in the midst of Diogenes Laertius and his Philosophers, as a prooemium to their works. My intention in forming this table was not so much for public events, though these too have a column assigned them, but rather in a literary way to compare the time of all great men, their writings, and their transactions. I have brought it from the 30th Olympiad, where it begins, to the 113th; that is, 332 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This laborious work was formed much in the manner of the President He∣nault's <Q REND="inline">"Historie de France."</Q> Every page consisted of nine columns; one for the Olympiad, the next for the Archons, the third for the public affairs of Greece, the three next for the Philosophers, and the three last for Poets, Historians, and Orators. I do not find it carried further than the date above-mentioned.</NOTE>. My only modern assistants were Marsham, Dod∣well, and Bentley.</P>

Thus much I may venture to tell you, because it is probable nobody else has done it, that our friend **'s zeal and eloquence surpassed all power of description. Vesuvio in an eruption was not more violent than his utterance, nor (since I am at my mountains) Pelion, with all its pine∣trees in a storm of wind, more impetuous than his action; and yet the Senate-House still stands, and (I thank God) we are all safe and well at your service. I was ready to sink for him, and scarce dared to look about me, when I was sure it was all over; but soon found I might have spared my confusion; all people joined to applaud him. Every thing was quite right; and I dare swear, not three people here but think him a model of oratory; for all the Duke's little court came with a resolution to be pleased; and when the tone was once given, the univer∣sity, who ever wait for the judgment of their betters, struck into it with an admirable harmony: for the rest of the perfor∣mances,

they were just what they usually are. Every one, while it lasted, was very gay and very busy in the morning, and very owlish and very tipsy at night: I make no exceptions from the Chancellor to Blue-coat. Mason's Ode was the only entertainment that had any tolerable elegance; and, for my own part, I think it (with some little abatements) uncommonly well on such an occasion. Pray let me know your sentiments; for doubtless you have seen it. The author of it grows apace into my good graces, as I know him more; he is very ingenious, with great good nature and simplicity; a little vain, but in so harmless and so comical a way, that it does not offend one at all; a little ambitious, but withal so ignorant in the world and its ways, that this does not hurt him in one's opinion; so sincere and so undisguised, that no mind, with a spark of gene∣rosity, would ever think of hurting him, he lies so open to injury; but so indolent, that if he cannot overcome this habit, all his good qualities will signify nothing at all. After all, I like him so well, I could wish you knew him.</P>

She might have languished many years before our eyes in a conti∣nual increase of pain, and totally helpless; she might have long wished to end her misery without being able to attain it; or perhaps even lost all sense, and yet continued to breathe; a sad spectacle to such as must have felt more for her than she could have done for herself. However you may deplore your own loss, yet think that she is at last easy and happy; and has now more occasion to pity us than we her. I hope, and beg, you will support yourself with that resignation we owe to him, who gave us our being for our good, and who deprives us of it for the same reason.

<P>My studies cannot furnish a recommendation of many new books to you.

However I cannot help commending the ge∣neral view which he gives of the face of the earth, followed by a particular one of all the known nations, their peculiar figure and manners, which is the best epitome of geography I ever met with, and written with sense and elegance; in short, these books are well worth turning over. The Memoirs of the Abbé de Mongon, in 5 vols. are highly commended, but I have not seen them. He was engaged in several embassies to Germany, England, &amp;c. during the course of the late war.

About this time Mr. Gray had put his last hand to his cele∣brated Elegy in the Country Church-yard, and had communi∣cated it to his friend Mr. Walpole, whose good taste was too much charmed with it to suffer him to withhold the sight of it from his acquaintance; accordingly it was shewn about for some time in manuscript, (as Mr. Gray intimates in the subse∣quent letter to Dr. Wharton) and received with all the applause it so justly merited. Amongst the rest of the fashionable world, for to these only it was at present communicated, Lady Cobham, who now lived at the mansion-house at Stoke-Pogis, had read and admired it. She wished to be acquainted with the author; accordingly her relation Miss Speed and Lady Schaub, then at her house, undertook to bring this about by making him the first visit. He happened to be from home, when the Ladies arrived at his Aunt's solitary mansion; and, when he returned, was surprized to find, written on one of his papers in the parlour where he usually read, the following note: <Q REND="inline">"Lady Schaub's compliments to Mr. Gray; she is sorry not to have found him at home, to tell him that Lady Brown is very well."</Q> This necessarily obliged him to return the visit, and soon after induced him to compose a ludicrous ac∣count of this little adventure for the amusement of the Ladies in question. He wrote it in ballad measure, and entitled it a Long Story: when it was handed about in manuscript, nothing could be more various than the opinions concerning it; by some it was thought a master-piece of original humour, by others a wild and fantastic farrago; and when it was published, the sentiments of good judges were equally divided about it. How it came to be printed I shall mention hereafter; and also
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
inform the reader why Mr. Gray rejected it in the collection which he himself made of his Poems: In the meanwhile, as I think it ought to have a place in these Memoirs, for reasons too obvious to insist upon, I shall beg leave to preface it with my own idea of the author's peculiar vein of humour; which, with my notes on the piece itself, may perhaps account in some sort for the variety of opinions which people of acknowledged taste have formed concerning it.</P>
<P>Mr. Gray had not (in my opinion) either in his conversation or writing much of what is called <HI>pure</HI> humour; it was always so much blended either with wit, fancy, or his own peculiar character, that it became equivocal, and hence not adapted to please generally: It had more of the manner of Congreve than Addison; and we know where one person relishes my Lady Wishfort, there are thousands that admire Sir Roger de Cover∣ley: It will not however from hence follow, that Lady Wish∣fort is ill drawn; for my own part I think it one of the most entertaining characters that ever was written. I know, how∣ever, that it is commonly thought extravagant and unnatural; and I believe it is true, that no woman ever existed who had so much folly and affectation, and at the same so much wit and fancy; yet every one sees that were this fancy and wit taken away, her character would become insipid, in proportion as it became more natural; so that, in this and other instances, <HI>if Congreve's fools were fools indeed,</HI> they would, by being <HI>true</HI> characters, cease to be <HI>entertaining</HI> ones. It may be further ob∣served on the subject of humour, that it may and ought to be divided into several species: there is one sort, that of Terence's, which simply pleases without forcing a smile; another, like
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
Mr. Addison's, which not only pleases, but makes us smile into the bargain. Shakespear's, Swift's, Congreve's, and Prior's usually go further, and make us laugh: I infer not from hence that this latter sort is the best: I only assert, that however it may be mixt with other ingredients, it ought also to be called Humour. The critic, however, who judges by rule, and who will not be pleased unless legitimately, will be apt to condemn this species of mixt humour; and the common reader will not always have either wit or imagination enough to comprehend or taste it. But I have said Mr. Gray not only mixed wit and fancy with his humour, but also his own particular character; and being naturally delicate, and at times even fastidious, his humour generally took the same cast; and would therefore be only relished by such of his friends, who, conscious of his su∣perior excellencies, thought this defect not only pardonable but entertaining, which a character of this sort (being humorous in itself) always is, when it is not carried to any offensive ex∣treme. Yet as this observation relates only to his conversation and familiar letters, (for to these only it can be applied) I have no occasion to insist on it further; and shall only add, that whatever the generality of readers may think of Mr. Gray's talent in this way, there will always be some, and those far from the lowest class, to whom it will appear excellent: for humour may be true, when it ceases to be pure or unmixt, if the ingredients which go to its composition be true also. False wit and a wild fancy would debase the best humour in the world, as they frequently do in Rabelais and Sterne (without taking more exceptionable matters into consideration); but when ge∣nuine, they serve to heighten and embellish it.</P>

The description of the spell, I know, has appeared to many persons absolutely unintelligible; yet if the reader adverts to that peculiar idea which runs through the whole, I imagine the obscurity complained of will be removed. An incident, we see, so slight as the simple matter of fact, required something like machinery to enliven it: Accordingly the author chose, with pro∣priety enough, to employ for that purpose those notions of witchcraft, ghosts, and enchantment, which prevailed at the time when the mansion-house was built. He describes himself as a daemon of the lowest class, <HI>a wicked imp who lamed the deer,</HI> &amp;c. against whose malevolent power Lady Cobham (the Gloriana of the piece) employs two superior enchantresses. Congruity of imagery, there∣fore, required the card they left upon the table to be converted into a spell. Now all the old writers, on these subjects, are very minute in describing the materials of such talismans. Hence, therefore, his grotesque idea of a compo∣sition of transparent bird-lime, edged with invisible chains in order to catch and draw him to the tribunal. Without going further for examples of this kind of imagery than the Poet's own works, let me instance two passages of the serious kind, similar to this ludicrous one. In his Ode, entitled the Bard,
<Q><L>" Above, below, the rose of snow, &amp;c."</L></Q>
And, again, in the Fatal Sisters,
<Q><L>" See the griesly texture grow."</L></Q>
It must, however, be allowed, that no person can fully relish this burlesque, who is not much conversant with the old romance-writers, and with the Poets who formed themselves on their model.</NOTE> But left a spell upon the table.</L>

<P>OF my house I cannot say much<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The house he was rebuilding in Cornhill. See Letter VII. of this Section.</NOTE>, I wish I could; but for my heart it is no less yours than it has long been; and the last thing in the world that will throw it into tumults is a fine Lady. The verses, you so kindly try to keep in counte∣nance, were written merely to divert Lady Cobham and her family, and succeeded accordingly; but being shewed about in town are not liked there at all. Mrs. *, a very fashionable per∣sonage, told Mr. Walpole that she had seen a thing by a friend of his which she did not know what to make of, for it aimed at every thing, and meant nothing; to which he replied, that he had always taken her for a woman of sense, and was very sorry to be undeceived. On the other hand, the stanzas<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Elegy in a Country Church-Yard.</NOTE> which I now inclose to you have had the misfortune, by Mr. Walpole's fault, to be made still more public, for which they certainly were never meant; but it is too late to complain. They have been so ap∣plauded, it is quite a shame to repeat it: I mean not to be modest; but it is a shame for those who have said such super∣lative things about them, that I cannot repeat them. I should have been glad that you and two or three more people had liked them, which would have satisfied my ambition on this head amply. I have been this month in town, not at Newcastle∣House; but diverting myself among my gay acquaintance, and return to my cell with so much the more pleasure. I dare not speak of my future excursion to Durham for fear of a disa∣pointment, but at present it is my full intention.</P>

<P>AS you have brought me into a little sort of distress, you must assist me, I believe, to get out of it as well as I can. Yesterday I had the misfortune of receiving a letter from certain gentlemen (as their bookseller expresses it), who have taken the Magazine of Magazines into their hands: They tell me that an <HI>ingenious</HI> Poem, called Reflections in a Country Church-Yard, has been communicated to them, which they are printing forthwith; that they are informed that the <HI>excellent</HI> author of it is I by name, and that they beg not only his <HI>in∣dulgence,</HI> but the <HI>honour</HI> of his correspondence, &amp;c. As I am not at all disposed to be either so indulgent, or so correspondent, as they desire, I have but one bad way left to escape the honour they would inflict upon me; and therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley print it immediately (which may be done in less than a week's time) from your copy, but without my name, in what form is most convenient for him, but on his best paper and character; he must correct the press himself, and print it without any interval between the stanzas, because the sense is in some places continued beyond them; and the title must be,—Elegy, written in a Country Church-Yard. If he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by ac∣cident, I should like it better. If you behold the Magazine of Magazines in the light that I do, you will not refuse to give yourself this trouble on my account, which you have taken of your own accord before now. If Dodsley do not do this imme∣diately, he may as well let it alone.</P>

<P>HAVE you read Madame de Maintenon's letters? They are undoubtedly genuine; they begin very early in her life, before she married Scarron, and continue after the king's death to within a little while of her own: they bear all the marks of a noble spirit (in her adversity particularly) of virtue and unaffected devotion; insomuch, that I am almost persuaded she was actually married to Lewis the XIV. and never his Mistress: and this not out of any policy or ambition, but conscience: for she was what we should call a bigot, yet with great good sense: In short, she was too good for a court. Mis∣fortunes in the beginning of her life had formed her mind (naturally lively and impatient) to reflection and a habit of piety. She was always miserable while she had the care of Madame de Montespan's children; timid and very cautious of making use of that unlimited power she rose to afterwards, for fear of trespassing on the king's friendship for her; and after his death not at all afraid of meeting her own.</P>
<P>I do not know what to say to you with regard to Racine; it sounds to me as if any body should fall upon Shakespear, who indeed lies infinitely more open to criticism of all kinds; but I should not care to be the person that undertook it. If you do not like Athaliah or Britannicus, there is no more to be said, I have done.</P>

Bishop Hall's satires, called Virgidemiae, are lately republish∣ed. They are full of spirit and poetry; as much of the first as Dr. Donne, and far more of the latter: they were written at the university when he was about twenty-three years old, and in Queen Elizabeth's time.</P>
<P>You do not say whether you have read the Crito<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of Plato.</NOTE>. I only recommend the dramatic part of the Phaedo to you, not the argumentative. The subject of the Erastae is good; it treats of that peculiar character and turn of mind which belongs to a true philosopher, but it is shorter than one would wish.

<P>I Am at present at Stoke, to which place I came at half an hour's warning upon the news I received of my mother's illness, and did not expect to have found her alive; but when I arrived she was much better, and continues so. I shall therefore be very glad to make you a visit at Strawberry-Hill, whenever you give me notice of a convenient time. I am surprized at the print<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A proof print of the Cul de Lampe which Mr. Bentley designed for the Elegy in a country church-yard, and which represents a village-funeral; this oc∣casioned the pleasant mistake of his two aunts. The remainder of the letter re∣lates entirely to the projected publication of Mr. Bentley's designs, which were printed after by Dodsley this same year. The latter part of it, where he so ve∣hemently declares against having his head prefixt to that work, will appear highly characteristical to those readers, who were personally acquainted with Mr. Gray. The print, which was taken from an original picture, painted by Echart, in Mr. Walpole's possession, was actually more than half engraved; but afterwards on this account suppressed.</NOTE>, which far surpasses my idea of London
<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
graving: The drawing itself was so finished, that I suppose it did not require all the art I had imagined to copy it tolerably. My aunts seeing me open your letter, took it to be a burying∣ticket, and asked whether any body had left me a ring; and so they still conceive it to be, even with all their spectacles on. Heaven forbid they should suspect it to belong to any verses of mine, they would burn me for a poet. On my own part I am satisfied, if this design of yours succeed so well as you intend it; and yet I know it will be accompanied with something not at all agreeable to me.—While I write this, I receive your second letter.—Sure, you are not out of your wits! This I know, if you suffer my head to be printed, you will infallibly put me out of mine. I conjure you immediately to put a stop to any such design. Who is at the expence of engraving it, I know not; but if it be Dodsley, I will make up the loss to him. The thing as it was, I know, will make me ridiculous enough; but to appear in proper person, at the head of my works, con∣sisting of half a dozen ballads in thirty pages, would be worse than the pillory. I do assure you, if I had received such a book, with such a frontispiece, without any warning, I be∣lieve it would have given me a palsy: Therefore I rejoice to have received this notice, and shall not be easy till you tell me all thoughts of it are laid aside. I am extremely in earnest, and cannot bear even the idea.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="229"/>
I had written to Dodsley if I had not received yours, to tell him how little I liked the title which he meant to prefix; but your letter has put all that out of my head. If you think it necessary to print these explanations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the above-mentioned Designs, where the explanations here alluded to are inserted.</NOTE> for the use of people that have no eyes, I should be glad they were a little altered. I am, to my shame, in your debt for a long letter; but I cannot think of any thing else till you have set me at ease on this matter.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>While Mr. Bentley was employed in making the Designs mentioned in the preceding letter, Mr. Gray, who greatly ad∣mired not only the elegance of his fancy, but also the neatness as well as facility of his execution, began a complimentary poem to him, which I shall now insert. Many readers will perhaps think the panegyric carried too far; as I own I did when he first shewed it me. Yet it is but justice to declare, that the original drawings, now in Mr. Walpole's possession, which I have since seen, are so infinitely superior to the published en∣gravings of them, that a person, who has only seen the latter, can by no means judge of the excellencies of the former: Besides, there is so much of grotesque fancy in the Designs themselves, that it can be no great matter of wonder (even if the engravers had done justice to them) that they failed to please universally. What I have said in defence of the Long Story might easily be applied to these productions of the sister art: But not to detain the reader from the perusal of a frag∣ment, many stanzas of which are equal in poetical merit to
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
the best in his most finished poems, I shall here only add that it was for the sake of the Design which Mr. Bentley made for the Long Story, that Mr. Gray permitted it to be printed; yet not without clearly forseeing that he risked somewhat by the publication of it, as he intimates in the preceding letter: and indeed the event shewed his judgment to be true in this parti∣cular, as it proved the least popular of all his productions.</P>

<P>A Little while before I received your melancholy letter, I had been informed by Mr. Charles Avison of one of the sad events you mention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of my Father, and of Dr. Marmaduke Pricket, a young Physi∣cian of my own age, with whom I was brought up from infancy, who died of the same infectious fever.</NOTE>. I know what it is to lose persons that one's eyes and heart have long been used to; and I never desire to part with the remembrance of that loss, nor would wish you should. It is something that you had a little time to acquaint yourself with the idea before-hand; and that your Father suffered but little pain, the only thing that makes death terrible. Af∣ter I have said this, I cannot help expressing my surprize at the disposition he has made of his affairs. I must (if you will suf∣fer me to say so) call it great weakness; and yet perhaps your
<PB N="230" REF="233"/>
affliction for him is heightened by that very weakness; for I know it is possible to feel an additional sorrow for the faults of those we have loved, even where that fault has been greatly injurious to ourselves.—Let me desire you not to expose your∣self to any further danger in the midst of that scene of sickness and death; but withdraw as soon as possible to some place at a little distance in the country; for I do not, in the least, like the situation you are in. I do not attempt to console you on the situation your fortune is left in; if it were far worse, the good opinion I have of you tells me, you will never the sooner do any thing mean or unworthy of yourself; and consequently I cannot pity you on this account, but I sincerely do on the new loss you have had of a good and friendly man, whose memory I honour. I have seen the scene you describe, and know how dreadful it is: I know too I am the better for it. We are all idle and thoughtless things, and have no sense, no use in the world any longer than that sad impression lasts; the deeper it is engraved the better.</P>

<P>I Am glad you enter into the spirit of Strawberry Castle; it has a purity and propriety of Gothicism in it (with very few exceptions) that I have not seen elsewhere. My Lord Radnor's vagaries I see did not keep you from doing justice to his situation, which far surpasses every thing near it; and I do
<PB N="231" REF="234"/>
not know a more laughing scene than that about Twickenham and Richmond. Dr. Akenside, I perceive, is no conjurer in architecture; especially when he talks of the ruins of Persepolis, which are no more Gothic than they are Chinese. The Egyp∣tian style (see Dr. Pococke, not his discourses, but his prints) was apparently the mother of the Greek; and there is such a similitude between the Egyptian and those Persian ruins, as gave Diodorus room to affirm, that the old buildings of Persia were certainly performed by Egyptian artists: As to the other part of your friend's opinion, that the Gothic manner is the Saracen or Moorish, he has a great authority to support him, that of Sir Christopher Wren; and yet I cannot help thinking it undoubtedly wrong. The palaces in Spain I never saw but in description, which gives us little or no idea of things; but the Doge's palace at Venice I have seen, which is in the Ara∣besque manner: And the houses of Barbary you may see in Dr. Shaw's book, not to mention abundance of other Eastern build∣ings in Turkey, Persia, &amp;c. that we have views of; and they seem plainly to be corruptions of the Greek architecture, broke into little parts indeed, and covered with little ornaments, but in a taste very distinguishable from that which we call Gothic. There is one thing that runs through the Moorish buildings that an imitator would certainly have been first struck with, and would have tried to copy; and that is the cupolas which cover every thing, baths, apartments, and even kitchens; yet who ever saw a Gothic cupola? It is a thing plainly of Greek original. I do not see any thing but the slender spires that serve for steeples, which may perhaps be borrowed from the Saracen minarets on their mosques.</P>

<P>I Do not pretend to humble any one's pride; I love my own too well to attempt it. As to mortifying their vanity, it is too easy and too mean a task for me to delight in. You are very good in shewing so much sensibility on my account; but be assured my taste for praise is not like that of children for fruit; if there were nothing but medlars and black-berries in the world, I could be very well content to go without any at all. I dare say that Mason, though some years younger than I, was as little elevated with the approbation of Lord * and Lord *, as I am mortified by their silence.</P>
<P>With regard to publishing, I am not so much against the thing itself, as of publishing this Ode alone<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His Ode on the progress of Poetry.</NOTE>. I have two or three ideas more in my head; what is to come of them? Must they too come out in the shape of little sixpenny flams, drop∣ping one after another till Mr. Dodsley thinks fit to collect them with Mr. This's Song, and Mr. Tother's Epigram, into a pretty volume? I am sure Mason must be sensible of this, and
<PB N="233" REF="236"/>
therefore cannot mean what he says; neither am I quite of your opinion with regard to strophe and antistrophe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He often made the same remark to me in conversation, which led me to form the last Ode of Caractacus in shorter stanzas: But we must not imagine that he thought the regular Pindaric method without its use; though, as he justly says, when formed in long stanzas, it does not fully succeed in point of effect on the ear: For there was nothing which he more disliked than that chain of irre∣gular stanzas which Cowley introduced, and falsely called Pindaric; and which from the extreme facility of execution produced a number of miserable imitators. Had the regular return of Strophe, Antistrophe, and Epode no other merit than that of extreme difficulty, it ought, on this very account, to be valued; because we well know that <Q REND="inline">"Easy writing is no easy reading."</Q> It is also to be remarked, that Mr. Congreve, who (though without any lyrical powers) first introduced the regular Pindaric form into the English language, made use of the short stanzas which Mr. Gray here recommends.
<BIBL>See his Ode to the Queen: Works, vol. III. p. 438, Ed. Birm.</BIBL></NOTE>; setting aside the difficulty of execution, methinks it has little or no effect on the ear, which scarce perceives the regular return of metres at so great a distance from one another: to make it succeed, I am persuaded the stanzas must not consist of above nine lines each at the most. Pindar has several such Odes.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Gray intimates, in the foregoing letter, that he had two or three more lyrical ideas in his head: One of these was the BARD, the exordium of which was at this time finished; I say finished, because his conceptions, as well as his manner of dis∣posing them, were so singularly exact, that he had seldom oc∣casion to make many, except verbal emendations, after he had first committed his lines to paper. It was never his method to sketch his general design in careless verse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have many of his critical letters by me on my own compositions: Letters which, though they would not much amuse the public in general, contain excel∣lent lessons for young poets, from one of these I extract the following passage, which seems to explain this matter more fully: <Q REND="inline">"Extreme conciseness of expres∣sion, yet pure, perspicuous, and musical, is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry: This I have always aimed at, and never could attain. The necessity of rhyming is one great obstacle to it: Another, and perhaps a stronger, is that way you have chosen, of casting down your first thoughts carelessly and at large, and then clipping them here and there at leisure. This method, after all possible pains, will leave behind it a laxity, a diffuseness. The frame of a thought (otherwise well-invented, well-turned, and well-placed) is often weak∣ened by it. Do I talk nonsense? Or do you understand me? I am persuaded what I say is true in my head, whatever it may be in prose; for I do not pre∣tend to write prose."</Q> Nothing can be more just than this remark: Yet, as I say above, it is a mode of writing which is only calculated for smaller composi∣tions: But Mr. Gray, though he applied it here to an Ode, was apt to think it a general rule. Now if an epic or dramatic poet was to resolve to finish every part of his work as highly as we have seen Mr. Gray laboured his first scene of Agrippina, I am apt to think he would tire of it as soon as he did; for in the course of so multifarious a work, he would find himself obliged to expunge some of the best written parts, in order to preserve the unity of the whole. I know only one way to prevent this, and that was the method which Racine followed; who (as his son tells us, in that amusing life, though much zested with bigotry, which he has given us of his father) when he began a drama, disposed every part of it accurately in prose; and when he had connected all the scenes together, used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Ma Tragedie est faite."</Q> (See La vie de Jean Racine, p. 117. See also his son's other works, tom. 2d, for a specimen in a first act of the Iphigenia in Tauris.) M. Racine, it seems, was an easy versifier in a language in which, they say, it is more difficult than in ours to versify. It certainly is so with regard to dramatic compositions. I am on this account persuaded, that if the great Poet had written in English, he would have drawn out his first sketches, not in prose, but in careless blank verse; yet this I give as mere matter of opinion.</NOTE>, he always finished
<PB N="234" REF="237"/>
as he proceeded; this, tho' it made his execution slow, made his compositions more perfect. I think, however, that this method was only calculated to produce such short works as generally employed his poetical pen; and that from pur∣suing it, he grew tired of his larger designs before he had completed them. The fact seems to justify my opinion. But

my principal reason for mentioning this at present, is to explain the cause why I have not been scrupulous in publishing so many of his fragments in the course of these memoirs. It would have been unpardonable in me to have taken this liberty with a deceased friend, had I not found his lines, as far as they went, nearly as high finished as they would have been, when com∣pleted: if I am mistaken in this, I hope the reader will rather impute it to a defect in my own Judgment, than a want of respect to Mr. Gray's Memory.</P>
<P>This consideration, however, emboldens me to print the following fragment of an Ode in this place, which was unque∣stionably another of the ideas, alluded to in the preceding letter: Since I find in his memorandum-book, of the preceding year 1754, a sketch of his design as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Contrast between the winter past and coming spring.—Joy owing to that vicis∣situde.—Many who never feel that delight.—Sloth.—Envy. Ambition. How much happier the rustic who feels it, tho' he knows not how."</Q> I print this careless note, in order that the reader may conceive the intended arrangement of the whole; who, I doubt not, will, on perusing the following beautiful stanzas, lament with me that he left it incomplete; nor will it console him for the loss, if I tell him that I have had the boldness to attempt to finish it myself, making use of some other lines and broken stanzas which he had written: But as my aim in undertaking this difficult task was merely to eluci∣date the Poet's general meaning, I do not think that my addi∣tions are worthy to be inserted in this place; they will find a more fit situation if thrown amongst those notes which I shall put at the end of his Poems.</P>

<P>A third of these ideas I find in his common-place book, on the same page with his argument for the BARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall insert this, with some remarks upon it, in my additional notes to his Poems.</NOTE>. I do not
<PB N="238" REF="241"/>
believe that he ever even began to compose the Ode itself; but the thought is as follows:</P>
<Q>"All that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty, compared to birds that, when confined to a cage, do but regret the loss of their freedom in melan∣choly strains, and lose the luscious wildness and happy luxu∣riance of their notes, which used to make the woods re∣sound."</Q>
<P>Those who are conversant in the arrangement of a lyrical composition, will easily perceive, from this short argument, that the Ode would have opened with the simile; which, when adorned with those <HI>thoughts that breathe and words that burn,</HI> that Mr. Gray's muse could so richly supply, would have been at once a fine exordium, and at the same time a natural intro∣duction to the truth he meant to impress. This, however, could hardly have been done without some little aid borrowed from satire: For however true his proposition may be, that <Q REND="inline">"all that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty;"</Q> or, as I should put it, <Q REND="inline">"that their best patronage signifies nothing if it abridges them of that liberty;"</Q> yet the fact is, that neither of the parties are convinced of this truth till they have tried the experiment, and find some reason or other (no matter whether good or bad) to think they had better never have tried it. Mons. d'Alembert, who has written an excellent essay on this subject, which Mr. Gray greatly ad∣mired, and which perhaps gave him the first idea of this intended Ode, puts one of the more common of these reasons in so lively a manner, that it may not be amiss here to insert it.</P>

<P>I Thank you for your intelligence about Herculaneum, which was the first news I received of it. I have since turned over Monsignor Baiardi's book<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I believe the Book here ridiculed was published by the Authority of the King of Naples. But afterwards, on finding how ill qualified the Author was to execute the task, the business of describing the Antiquities found at Hercula∣neum was put into other hands; who have certainly, as far as they have gone, performed it much better.</NOTE>, where I have learned how many grains of modern wheat the Roman Congius, in the Ca∣pitol, holds, and how many thousandth parts of an inch the Greek foot consisted of more (or less, for I forget which) than our own. He proves also by many affecting examples, that an Antiquary may be mistaken: That, for any thing any body knows, this place under ground might be some other place, and not Herculaneum; but nevertheless, that he can shew for certain, that it was this place and no other place; that it is hard to say which of the several Hercules's was the founder; therefore (in the third volume) he promises to give us the me∣moirs of them all; and after that, if we do not know what to think of the matter, he will tell us. There is a great deal of wit too, and satire and verses, in the book, which is intended chiefly for the information of the French King, who will be greatly edified without doubt.</P>

<P>THOUGH I had no reasonable excuse for myself before I received your last Letter, yet since that time I have had a pretty good one; having been taken up in quarrelling with Peter-house<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The reason of Mr. Gray's changing his College, which is here only glanced at, was in few words this: Two or three young Men of Fortune, who lived in the same stair-case, had for some time intentionally disturbed him with their riots, and carried their ill behaviour so far as frequently to awaken him at midnight. After having borne with their insults longer than might reasonably have been ex∣pected even from a man of less warmth of temper, Mr. Gray complained to the Governing part of the Society; and not thinking that his remonstrance was suf∣ficiently attended to, quitted the College. The slight manner in which he men∣tions this affair, when writing to one of his most intimate friends, certainly does honour to the placability of his disposition.</NOTE>, and in removing myself from thence to Pembroke.

This may be looked upon as a sort of aera in a life so barren of events as mine; yet I shall treat it in Voltaire's manner, and only tell you that I left my Lodgings because the rooms were noisy, and the people of the house uncivil. This is all I would chuse to have said about it; but if you in private should be curious enough to enter into a particular detail of facts and minute circumstances, the Bearer, who was witness to them, will probably satisfy you. All I shall say more is, that I am for the present extremely well lodged here, and as quiet as in the Grand Chartreuse; and that every body (even Dr. Long himself) are as civil as they could be to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foundress of the College.</NOTE>Mary of Valens in person.</P>
<P>With regard to any advice I can give you about your being Physician to the Hospital, I frankly own it ought to give way to a much better judge, especially so disinterested a one as Dr. Heberden.

cannot agree with you in thinking Him or his Master two of the best men in the world. The King was indeed one of the best-natured men that ever lived; but it is owing only to chance that his intended marriage with Madame d'Estreés, or with the Marquise de Verneuil, did not involve him and the king∣dom in the most inextricable confusion; and his design upon the Princess of Condé (in his old age) was worse still. As to the Minister, his base application to Concini, after the murder of Henry, has quite ruined him in my esteem, and destroyed all the merit of that honest surly pride for which I honoured him before; yet I own that, as Kings and Ministers go, they were both extraordinary men. Pray look at the end of Birch's State Papers of Sir J. Edmonds, for the character of the French Court at that time; it is written by Sir George Carew.</P>
<P>You should have received Mason's Present<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four Odes which I had just published separately.</NOTE> last Saturday.

<P>THOUGH I allow abundance for your kindness and partiality to me, I am yet much pleased with the good opinion you seem to have of the Bard: I have not, however, done a word more than the little you have seen, having been in a very listless, unpleasant, and <HI>inutile</HI> state of mind for this long time, for which I shall beg you to prescribe me somewhat strengthening and agglutinant, lest it turn to a confirmed Pthisis.</P>
<P>I recommend two little French books to you, one called Memoirs de M. de la Porte; it has all the air of simplicity and truth, and contains some few very extraordinary facts re∣lating to Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarine. The other is in two small volumes, <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs de Madame Staal."</Q> The facts are no great matter, but the manner and vivacity make them interesting.

<P>I Feel a contrition for my long silence; and yet perhaps it is the last thing you trouble your head about. Nevertheless I will be as sorry as if you took it ill. I am sorry too to see you so punctilious as to stand upon answers, and never to come near me till I have regularly left my name at your door, like a Mercer's Wife, that imitates people who go a visiting. I would forgive you this, if you could possibly suspect I were doing any thing that I liked better; for then your formality might look like being piqued at my negligence, which has somewhat in it like kindness: But you know I am at Stoke, hearing, seeing, doing absolutely nothing.

I have had no more muscular inflations, and am only troubled with this depression of mind. You will not expect therefore I should give you any account of my <HI>Verve,</HI> which is at best (you know) of so delicate a constitution, and has such weak nerves, as not to stir out of its chamber above three days in a year. But I shall enquire after yours, and why it is off again? It has certainly worse nerves than mine, if your Reviewers have frighted it. Sure I (not to mention a score of your other Critics) am something a better Judge than all the Man-Midwives and Presbyterian Parsons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Reviewers, at the time, were supposed to be of these professions.</NOTE> that ever were born. Pray give me leave to ask you, do you find yourself tickled with the commendations of such people? (for you have your share of these too) I dare say not; your Vanity has certainly a better taste. And can then the censure of such critics move you? I own it is an impertinence in these gentry to talk of one at all either in good or in bad; but this we must all swallow: I mean not only we that write, but all the <HI>we's</HI> that ever did any thing to be talked of.</P>

<P>I Do not know why you should thank me for what you had a right and title to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A present of his two Pindaric Odes just then published.</NOTE>; but attribute it to the excess of your politeness; and the more so, because almost no one else has made me the same compliment.

Mr. Garrick's complimentary verses to me you have seen; I am told they were printed in the Chronicle of last Sa∣turday.

<P>I Have (as I desired Mr. Stonhewer to tell you) read over Ca∣ractacus twice, not with pleasure only, but with emotion. You may say what you will; but the contrivance, the manners, the interests, the passions, and the expression, go beyond the dra∣matic part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the manuscript now before him, Mr. Gray had only the first Ode, the others were not then written; and although the dramatic part was brought to a conclusion, yet it was afterwards in many places altered. He was mistaken with regard to the opinion the world would have about it. That world, which usually loves to be led in such matters, rather than form an opinion for itself, was taught a different sentiment; and one of its leaders went so far as to declare, that he never knew a second work fall so much below a first from the same hand. To oppose Mr. Gray's judgment to his, I must own gives me some satisfaction; and to enjoy it I am willing to risk that imputation of vanity, which may probably fall to my share for having published this Letter. I must add, however, that some of my friends advised it for the sake of the more <HI>general</HI> criticisms which they thought too valuable to be suppressed.</NOTE> of your Elfrida, many many leagues. I even say (though you will think me a bad judge of this) that the <HI>World</HI> will like it better. I am struck with the Chorus, who are not
<PB N="252" REF="255"/>
there merely to sing and dance, but bear throughout a principal part in the action; and have (beside the <HI>Costume,</HI> which is ex∣cellent) as much a character of their own, as any other person. I am charmed with their priestly pride and obstinacy, when, after all is lost, they resolve to confront the Roman General, and spit in his face. But now I am going to tell you what touches me most from the beginning. The first opening is greatly improved: the curiosity of Didius is now a very natu∣ral reason for dwelling on each particular of the scene before him; nor is the description at all too long. I am glad to find the two young men are Cartismandua's sons. They interest me far more. I love people of condition. They were men before that no body knew: one could not make them a bow if one had met them at a public place.</P>
<P>I always admired that interruption of the Druids to Evelina, <HI>Peace, virgin, peace,</HI> &amp;c. and chiefly the <HI>abstract idea personi∣fied</HI> (to use the words of a Critic) at the end of it. That of Caractacus, <HI>Would save my Queen,</HI> &amp;c. and still more that, <HI>I know it, reverend Fathers; 'tis Heav'n's high will,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>I've done, begin the rites!</HI> This latter is exemplary for the ex∣pression (always the great point with me); I do not mean by expression the mere choice of words, but the whole dress, fa∣shion, and arrangement of a thought. Here, in particular, it is the brokenness, the ungrammatical position, the total sub∣version of the period that charms me. All that ushers in the incantation from <HI>Try we yet, what holiness can do,</HI> I am delight∣ed with in quite another way; for this is pure poetry, as it ought to be, forming the proper transition, and leading on the mind to that still purer poetry that follows it.</P>

In the beginning of the succeeding act I admire the Chorus again, <HI>Is it not now the hour, the holy hour,</HI> &amp;c. and their evasion of a lie, <HI>Say'st thou, proud Boy,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>sleep with the unsun'd silver,</HI> which is an example of a dramatic simile. The sudden appearance of Caractacus, the pretended respect and admiration of Vellinus, and the probability of his story, the distrust of the Druids, and their reasoning with Caractacus, and particularly that, <HI>'Tis meet thou should'st, thou art a King,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Mark me, Prince, the time will come, when Destiny,</HI> &amp;c. are well, and happily imagined. A-propos of the last striking passage I have mentioned, I am going to make a digression.</P>
<P>When we treat a subject, where the manners are almost lost in antiquity, our stock of ideas must needs be small; and nothing betrays our poverty more, than the returning to, and harping frequently on, one image. It was therefore I thought you should omit some lines before, though good in themselves, about the <HI>scythed car,</HI> that the passage now before us might appear with greater lustre when it came; and in this I see you have complied with me. But there are other ideas here and there still, that occur too often, particularly about <HI>the Oaks,</HI> some of which I would discard to make way for the rest.</P>
<P>But the subjects I speak of to compensate (and more than compensate) that unavoidable poverty, have one great advan∣tage when they fall into good hands. They leave an unbound∣ed liberty to pure imagination and fiction, (our favourite pro∣vinces) where no Critic can molest, or Antiquary gainsay us; and yet (to please me) these fictions must have some affinity, some seeming <HI>connexion,</HI> with that little we really know of the
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>
character and customs of the people. For example, I never heard in my days that Midnight and the Moon were Sisters; that they carried rods of ebony and gold, or met to whisper on the top of a mountain: but now I could lay my life it is all true; and do not doubt it will be found so in some Pantheon of the Druids, that is to be discovered in the Library at Herculaneum. The <HI>Car of Destiny and Death</HI> is a very noble invention of the same class, and, as far as that goes, is so fine, that it makes me more delicate, than perhaps I should be, about the close of it. <HI>Andraste sailing on the wings of Fame,</HI> that snatches the wreaths from oblivion to hang them on her loftiest Amaranth, though a clear and beautiful piece of <HI>unknown</HI> Mythology, has too <HI>Greek</HI> an air to give me perfect satisfaction.</P>
<P>Now I proceed. The preparation to the Chorus, though so much akin to that in the former act, is excellent. The re∣marks of Evelina and her suspicions of the Brothers, mixed with a secret inclination to the younger of them, (though, I think, her part throughout wants retouching) yet please me much, and the contrivance of the following scene much more. <HI>Ma∣sters of Wisdom, no,</HI> &amp;c. I always admired; as I do the rock∣ing stone, and the distress of Elidurus. Evelina's examination of his is a well-invented scene, and will be, with a little pains, a very touching one: but the introduction of Arviragus is superlative. I am not sure whether those few lines of his short narrative, <HI>My strength repair'd, it boots not, that I tell,</HI> &amp;c. do not please me as much as any thing in the whole Drama. The sullen bravery of Elidurus, the menaces of the Chorus, that <HI>Think not, Religion,</HI> &amp;c. the Trumpet of the Druids, that <HI>I'll follow him, tho' in my chains, &amp;c. Hast thou a Brother, no,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="258"/>
&amp;c. the placability of the Chorus, when they see the motives of Elidurus's obstinacy, give me great contentment: so do the reflections of the Druid on the necessity of lustration, and the reasons for Vellinus's easy escape; but I would not have him <HI>seize on a spear,</HI> nor <HI>issue hasty thro' the cavern's mouth.</HI> Why should he not steal away, unasked and unmissed, till the hurry of passions in those, that should have guarded him, was a little abated? But I chiefly admire the two speeches of Eli∣durus; <HI>Ah, Vellinus, is this then,</HI> &amp;c. and, <HI>Ye do gaze on me, Fathers,</HI> &amp;c. the manner in which the Chorus reply to him is very fine; but the image at the end wants a little mending. The next scene is highly moving! it is so very good, that I must have it made yet better.</P>
<P>Now for the last act. I do not know what you would have; but to me the design and contrivance of it is at least equal to any part of the whole. The short-lived triumph of the Bri∣tons, the address of Caractacus to the Roman Victims, Eveli∣na's discovery of the ambush, the mistake of the Roman fires for the rising sun, the death of Arviragus, the interview be∣tween Didius and Caractacus, his mourning over his dead Son, his parting speech, (in which you have made all the use of Ta∣citus that your plan would admit) every thing, in short, but that little dispute between Didius and him; <HI>'Tis well; and therefore to encrease that reverence,</HI> &amp;c. down to, <HI>Give me a mo∣ment</HI> (which must be omitted, or put in the mouth of the Druids) I approve in the highest degree. If I should find any fault with the last act, it could only be with trifles and little expressions. If you make any alterations, I fear it will never improve it; I mean as to the plan. I send you back the two
<PB N="256" REF="259"/>
last sheets, because you bid me. I reserve my nibblings and minutiae for another day.</P>

<P>A Life spent out of the world has its hours of despondence, its inconveniencies, its sufferings, as numerous and as real, though not quite of the same sort, as a life spent in the midst of it. The power we have, when we will exert it over our own minds, joined to a little strength and consolation, nay, a little pride we catch from those that seem to love us, is our only support in either of these conditions. I am sensible I can∣not return you more of this assistance than I have received from you; and can only tell you, that one who has far more reason than you, I hope, ever will have to look on life with some∣thing worse than indifference, is yet no enemy to it; but can look backward on many bitter moments, partly with satisfac∣tion, and partly with patience; and forward too, on a scene not very promising, with some hope, and some expectations of a better day. The cause, however, which occasioned your re∣flection, (though I can judge but very imperfectly of it) does not seem, at present, to be weighty enough to make you take any such resolution as you meditate. Use it in its season, as a relief from what is tiresome to you, but not as if it was in consequence of any thing you take ill; on the contrary, if such a thing had happened at the time of your transmigration, I would defer it merely to avoid that appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="260"/>
As to myself, I cannot boast, at present, either of my spirits, my situation, my employments, or fertility. The days and the nights pass, and I am never the nearer to any thing, but that one to which we are all tending; yet I love people that leave some traces of their journey behind them, and have strength enough to advise you to do so while you can. I expect to see Caractacus compleated, and therefore I send you the books you wanted. I do not know whether they will furnish you with any new matter; but they are well enough written, and easily read. I told you before that (in a time of dearth) I would borrow from the Edda, without entering too minutely on par∣ticulars: but, if I did so, I would make each image so clear, that it might be fully understood by itself; for in this obscure mythology we must not hint at things, as we do with the Greek fables, that every body is supposed to know at school. How∣ever, on second thoughts, I think it would be still better to graft any wild picturesque fable, absolutely of one's own inven∣tion, on the Druid-stock; I mean on those half dozen of old fan∣cies that are known to be a part of their system. This will give you more freedom and latitude, and will leave no hold for the Critics to fasten on.</P>
<P>I send you back the Elegy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegy in the Garden of a Friend.</NOTE> as you desired me to do. My advices are always at your service to take or to refuse, therefore you should not call them severe. You know I do not love, much less pique myself on Criticism; and think even a bad verse as good a thing or better than the best observation that ever was made upon it. I like greatly the spirit and sentiment of it (much of which you perhaps owe to your present train of
<PB N="258" REF="261"/>
thinking); the disposition of the whole too is natural and ele∣giac; as to the expression, I would venture to say (did not you forbid me) that it is sometimes too easy. The last line I pro∣test against (this, you will say, is worse than blotting out rhymes); the descriptive part is excellent.</P>
<P>Pray, when did I pretend to finish, or even insert passages into other people's works, as if it were equally easy to pick holes and to mend them? All I can say is, that your Elegy must not end with the worst line in it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was endeavoured to be improved accordingly; how it stood when this criticism upon it was written, I cannot now recollect.</NOTE>. It is flat; it is prose; where∣as that, above all, ought to sparkle, or at least to shine. If the sentiment must stand, twirl it a little into an apothegm; stick a flower in it; gild it with a costly expression; let it strike the fancy, the ear, or the heart, and I am satisfied.</P>
<P>The other particular expressions which I object to, I mark on the manuscript. Now, I desire you would neither think me severe, nor at all regard what I say further, than as it co∣incides with your own judgment; for the child deserves your partiality; it is a healthy well-made boy with an ingenuous countenance, and promises to live long. I would only wash its face, dress it a little, make it walk upright and strong, and keep it from learning <HI>paw</HI> words.</P>
<P>I hope you couched my refusal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of being Poet Laureat on the death of Cibber, which place the late Duke of Devonshire (then Lord Chamberlain) desired his brother to offer to Mr. Gray; and his Lordship had commissioned me (then in town) to write to him concerning it.</NOTE> to Lord John Cavendish in as respectful terms as possible, and with all due acknowledg∣ments

to the Duke. If you hear who it is to be given to, pray let me know; for I interest myself a little in the history of it, and rather wish somebody may accept it that will retrieve the credit of the thing, if it be retrievable, or ever had any credit. Rowe was, I think, the last man of character that had it; Eusden was a person of great hopes in his youth, though at last he turned out a drunken parson; Dryden was as disgraceful to the office, from his character, as the poorest scribbler could have been from his verses.</P>

<P>WOULD you know what I am doing?

The drift of my present studies is to know, wherever I am, what lies with∣in reach that may be worth seeing, whether it be building, ruin, park, garden, prospect, picture, or monument; to whom it does or has belonged, and what has been the characte∣ristic and taste of different ages.

<P>IT is indeed for want of spirits, as you suspect, that my stu∣dies lie among the Cathedrals, and the Tombs, and the Ruins. To think, though to little purpose, has been the chief amusement of my days; and when I would not, or cannot think, I dream. At present I feel myself able to write a Cata∣logue, or to read the Peerage book, or Miller's Gardening Dic∣tionary, and am thankful that there are such employments and such authors in the world. Some people, who hold me cheap for this, are doing perhaps what is not half so well worth
<PB N="261" REF="264"/>
while. As to posterity, I may ask (with somebody whom I have forgot) what has it ever done to oblige me?</P>
<P>To make a transition from myself to as poor a subject, the Tragedy of Agis; I cry to think that it should be by the Au∣thor of Douglas: Why, it is all modern Greek; the story is an antique statue painted white and red, frized, and dressed in a negligée made by a Yorkshire mantua-maker. Then here is the Miscellany (Mr. Dodsley has sent me the whole set gilt and lettered, I thank him). Why, the two last volumes are worse than the four first; particularly Dr. Akenside is in a deplorable way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been told that this Writer, unquestionably a man of great learning and genius, entertained, some years before his death, a notion that <HI>Poetry was only true eloquence in metre;</HI> and, according to this idea, wrote his Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England, and afterwards made considerable alterations in that collection of Odes which he had published in the earlier part of his life. We have seen in the second letter of this section, that Mr. Gray thought highly of his descriptive talents at that time. We are not therefore to impute what he here says to any prejudice in the Critic, but to that change of taste in the Poet, which (if the above anecdote be true) would unavoidably flatten his descriptions, and divest them of all picturesque imagery: nay, would sometimes convert his verse into mere prose; or, what is worse, hard inflated prose.</NOTE>. What signifies Learning and the Antients, (Mason will say triumphantly) why should people read Greek to lose their imagination, their ear, and their mother tongue? But then there is Mr. Shenstone, who trusts to nature and simple sentiment, why does he do no better? he goes hopping along his own gravel-walks, and never deviates from the beaten paths for fear of being lost.</P>
<P>I have read Dr. Swift, and am disappointed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His history of the four last years of Queen Anne.</NOTE>. There is no∣thing of the negotiations that I have not seen better in M. de

<P>I Am as sorry as you seem to be, that our acquaintance harped so much on the subject of materialism, when I saw him with you in town, because it was plain to which side of the long-debated question he inclined. That we are indeed mechanical and dependent beings, I need no other proof than my own feelings; and from the same feelings I learn, with equal conviction, that we are not <HI>merely</HI> such: that there is a power within that struggles against the force and biass of that mechanism, commands its motion, and, by frequent practice, reduces it to that ready obedience which we call <HI>Habit;</HI> and all this in conformity to a preconceived opinion (no matter whether right or wrong) to that least material of all agents, a Thought. I have known many in his case who, while they thought they were conquering an old prejudice, did not perceive they were under the influence of one far more dangerous; one that fur∣nishes us with a ready apology for all our worst actions, and opens to us a full licence for doing whatever we please; and yet these very people were not at all the more indulgent to other men (as they naturally should have been), their indignation to
<PB N="263" REF="266"/>
such as offended them, their desire of revenge on any body that hurt them was nothing mitigated: In short, the truth is, they wished to be persuaded of that opinion for the sake of its con∣venience, but were not so in their heart; and they would have been glad (as they ought in common prudence) that nobody else should think the same, for fear of the mischief that might ensue to themselves. His French Author I never saw, but have read fifty in the same strain, and shall read no more. I can be wretched enough without them. They put me in mind of the Greek Sophist that got immortal honour by discoursing so feelingly on the miseries of our condition, that fifty of his audience went home and hanged themselves; yet he lived him∣self (I suppose) many years after in very good plight.</P>
<P>You say you cannot conceive how Lord Shaftesbury came to be a Philosopher in vogue; I will tell you: First, he was a Lord; 2dly, he was as vain as any of his readers; 3dly, men are very prone to believe what they do not understand; 4thly, they will believe any thing at all, provided they are under no obli∣gation to believe it; 5thly, they love to take a new road, even when that road leads no where; 6thly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and seemed always to mean more than he said. Would you have any more reasons? An interval of above forty years has pretty well destroyed the charm. A dead Lord ranks but with Commoners: Vanity is no longer interested in the matter, for the new road is become an old one. The mode of free∣thinking is like that of Ruffs and Farthingales, and has given place to the mode of not thinking at all; once it was reckoned graceful, half to discover and half conceal the mind, but now we have been long accustomed to see it quite naked: primness
<PB N="264" REF="267"/>
and affectation of style, like the good breeding of Queen Ann's Court, has turned to hoydening and rude familiarity.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>It will, I think, be no improper supplement to the foregoing letter to insert a paper of Mr. Gray's, which contains some very pertinent strictures on the writings of a later Lord, who was pleased to attack the moral attributes of the Deity; or, what amounted to the same thing, endeavoured to prove, <Q REND="inline">"that we have no adequate ideas of his goodness and justice, as we have of his natural ones, his wisdom and power."</Q> This position the excellent author of the View of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy, calls the MAIN PILLAR of his system; and adds, in another place, that the FATE OF ALL RELIGION is included in this question. On this important point, therefore, that able Writer has dwelt largely, and confuted his Lordship effectually. Some sort of readers, however, who probably would slight that confutation, may regard the arguments of a Layman, and even a Poet, more than those which are drawn up by the pen of a Divine and a Bishop: It is for the use of these that the paper is published; who, if they learn nothing else from it, will find that Mr. Gray was not of their party, nor so great a wit as to dis∣believe the existence of a Deity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In one of his pocket-books I find a slight sketch in verse of his own cha∣racter, which may, on account of one line in it, come into a note here with suf∣cient propriety. It was written in 1761.</P>
<Q><L>Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune;</L>
<L>He had not the method of making a fortune:</L>

<L>NO VERY GREAT WIT, HE BELIEV'D IN A GOD.</L>
<L>A Post or a Pension he did not desire,</L>
<L>But left Church and State to Charles Townshend and Squire.</L></Q>
<P>This last line needs no comment for readers of the present time, and it surely is not worth while to write one on this occasion for posterity.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<Q><PB N="265" REF="268"/><P>"I will allow Lord Bolingbroke, that the moral, as well as physical, attributes of God must be known to us only à poste∣riori, and that this is the only real knowledge we can have either of the one or the other; I will allow too that perhaps it may be an idle distinction which we make between them: His moral attributes being as much in his nature and essence as those we call his physical; but the occasion of our making some distinction is plainly this: His eternity, infinity, omniscience, and almighty power, are not what connect him, if I may so speak, with us his creatures. We adore him, not because he always did in every place, and always will, exist; but because he gave and still preserves to us our own existence by an exer∣tion of his goodness. We adore him, not because he knows and can do all things, but because he made us capable of know∣ing and of doing what may conduct us to happiness: It is therefore his benevolence which we adore, not his greatness or power; and if we are made only to bear our part in a system, without any regard to our own particular happiness, we can no longer worship him as our all-bounteous parent: There is no meaning in the term. The idea of his malevolence (an im∣piety I tremble to write) must succeed. We have nothing left but our fears, and those too vain; for whither can they lead but to despair and the sad desire of annihilation. <Q REND="inline">"If then justice and goodness be not the same in God as in our ideas, we mean nothing when we say that God is necessarily just and good; and for the same reason it may as well be said that we know not what we mean when, according to Dr. Clarke, (Evid. 26th) we affirm that he is necessarily a wise and intelligent Being."</Q> What then can Lord Bolingbroke mean, when he says every thing shews the wisdom of God;
<PB N="266" REF="269"/>
and yet adds, every thing does not shew in like manner the goodness of God conformably to our ideas of this attribute in either? By wisdom he must only mean, that God knows and employs the fittest means to a certain end, no matter what that end may be: This indeed is a proof of knowledge and intelli∣gence; but these alone do not constitute wisdom; the word implies the application of these fittest means to the best and kindest end: Or, who will call it true wisdom? even amongst ourselves, it is not held as such. All the attributes then that he seems to think apparent in the constitution of things, are his unity, infinity, eternity and intelligence; from no one of which, I boldly affirm, can result any duty of gratitude or adoration incumbent on mankind, more than if He and all things round him were produced, as some have dared to think, by the neces∣sary working of eternal matter in an infinite vacuum. For what does it avail to add intelligence to those other physical attributes, unless that intelligence be directed, not only to the good of the whole, but also to the good of every individual of which that whole is composed.</P>
<P>It is therefore no impiety, but the direct contrary, to say that human justice and the other virtues, which are indeed only various applications of human benevolence, bear some re∣semblance to the moral attributes of the supreme Being: It is only by means of that resemblance, we conceive them in him, or their effects in his works: It is by the same means only, that we comprehend those physical attributes which his Lordship allows to be demonstrable: How can we form any notion of his unity, but from that unity of which we ourselves are con∣scious? How of his existence, but from our own consciousness
<PB N="267" REF="270"/>
of existing? How of his power, but of that power which we experience in ourselves? yet neither Lord Bolingbroke nor any other man, that thought on these subjects, ever believed that these our ideas were real and full representations of these attri∣butes in the Divinity. They say he knows; they do not mean that he compares ideas which he acquired from sensation, and draws conclusions from them. They say he acts; they do not mean by impulse, nor as the soul acts on an organized body. They say he is omnipotent and eternal; yet on what are their ideas founded, but on our own narrow conceptions of space and duration, prolonged beyond the bounds of space and time? Either therefore there is a resemblance and analogy (however imperfect and distant) between the attributes of the Divinity and our conceptions of them, or we cannot have any concep∣tions of them at all: He allows we ought to reason from earth, that we do know, to heaven which we do not know; how can we do so but by that affinity which appears between one and the other?</P>
<P>In vain then does my Lord attempt to ridicule the warm but melancholy imagination of Mr. Wollaston in that fine soliloquy: <Q REND="inline">"Must I then bid my last farewel to these walks when I close these lids, and yonder blue regions and all this scene darken upon me and go out? Must I then only serve to furnish dust to be mingled with the ashes of these herds and plants, or with this dirt under my feet? Have I been set so far above them in life, only to be levelled with them in death?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Religion of Nature delineated, sect. 9, p. 209, quarto.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> No thinking head, no heart, that has the least sensibility, but must
<PB N="268" REF="271"/>
have made the same reflection; or at least must feel, not the beauty alone, but the truth of it when he hears it from the mouth of another. Now what reply will Lord Bolingbroke make to these questions which are put to him, not only by Wol∣laston, but by all mankind? He will tell you, that we, that is, the animals, vegetables, stones, and <HI>other clods of earth,</HI> are all connected in one immense design, that we are all Dramatis Per∣sonae, in different characters, and that we were not made for ourselves, but for the action: that it is foolish, presumptuous, impious, and profane to murmur against the Almighty Author of this drama, when we feel ourselves unavoidably unhappy. On the contrary, we ought to rest our head on the soft pillow of resignation, on the immovable rock of tranquillity secure; that if our pains and afflictions grow violent indeed, an immediate end will be put to our miserable being, and we shall be mingled with the dirt under our feet, a thing common to all the animal kind; and of which, he who complains, does not seem to have been set by his reason so far above them in life, as to deserve not to be mingled with them in death. Such is the consolation his philosophy gives us, and such the hope on which his tran∣quillity was founded."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader, who would chuse to see the argument, as Lord Bolingbroke puts it, will find it in the 4th volume of his Philosophical Works, sect. 40, 41. His ridicule on Wollaston is in the 50th section of the same volume.</NOTE></P></Q>

<P>I Am equally sensible of your affliction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Occasioned by the death of his eldest (and at the time his only) son.</NOTE>, and of your kindness, that made you think of me at such a moment; would to God I could lessen the one, or requite the other with that con∣solation which I have often received from you when I most wanted it! but your grief is too just, and the cause of it too fresh, to admit of any such endeavour: What, indeed, is all human consolation? Can it efface every little amiable word or action of an object we loved, from our memory? Can it con∣vince us, that all the hopes we had entertained, the plans of future satisfaction we had formed, were ill-grounded and vain, only because we have lost them? The only comfort (I am afraid) that belongs to our condition, is to reflect (when time has given us leisure for reflection) that others have suffered worse; or that we ourselves might have suffered the same misfortune at times and in circumstances that would probably have aggravated our sorrow. You might have seen this poor child arrive at an age to fulfil all your hopes, to attach you more strongly to him by long habit, by esteem, as well as natural affection, and that towards the decline of your life, when we most stand in need of support, and when he might chance to have been your <HI>only</HI> support; and then by some unforeseen and deplorable accident, or some painful lingering distemper, you might have lost him. Such has been the fate of many an unhappy father! I know
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>
there is a sort of tenderness which infancy and innocence alone produce; but I think you must own the other to be a stronger and a more overwhelming sorrow. Let me then beseech you to try, by every method of avocation and amusement, whether you cannot, by degrees, get the better of that dejection of spirits, which inclines you to see every thing in the worst light possible, and throws a sort of voluntary gloom, not only over your present, but future days; as if even your situation now were not preferable to that of thousands round you; and as if your prospect hereafter might not open as much of happiness to you as to any person you know: the condition of our life per∣petually instructs us to be rather slow to hope, as well as to de∣spair; and (I know you will forgive me, if I tell you) you are often a little too hasty in both, perhaps from constitution; it is sure we have great power over our own minds, when we chuse to exert it; and though it be difficult to resist the me∣chanic impulse and bias of our own temper, it is yet possible, and still more so, to delay those resolutions it inclines us to take, which we almost always have cause to repent.</P>
<P>You tell me nothing of Mrs. Wharton's or your own state of health: I will not talk to you more upon this subject till I hear you are both well; for that is the grand point, and with∣out it we may as well not think at all. You flatter me in thinking that any thing I can do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His friend had requested him to write an Epitaph on the child.</NOTE>, could at all alleviate the just concern your loss has given you; but I cannot flatter my∣self so far, and know how little qualified I am at present to give any satisfaction to myself on this head, and in this way, much less to you. I by no means pretend to inspiration; but
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>
yet I affirm, that the faculty, in question, is by no means vo∣luntary; it is the result (I suppose) of a certain disposition of mind, which does not depend of one's self, and which I have not felt this long time. You that are a witness how seldom this spirit has moved me in my life, may easily give credit to what I say.</P>

I almost envy your last month, being in a very insipid situation myself; and desire you would not fail to send me some furniture for my Gothic apartment, which is very cold at present. It will be the easier task, as you have nothing to do but transcribe your little red books, if they are not rubbed out; for I conclude you have not trusted every thing to memory, which is ten times worse than a lead-pencil: Half a word fixed upon or near the spot, is worth a cart-load of recollection. When we trust to the picture that objects draw of themselves on our mind, we deceive ourselves; without accurate and particular observation, it is but ill-drawn at first, the outlines are soon blurred, the colours every day grow fainter; and at last, when we would produce it to any body, we are forced to supply its defects with a few strokes of our own imagination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had this letter nothing else to recommond it, the advice here given to the curious traveller of making all his memoranda <HI>on the spot,</HI> and the reasons for it, are so well expressed, and withal so important, that they certainly deserve our notice.</NOTE>.

Pray, tell me, (but with permission, and without any breach of hospitality) is it so much warmer on the other side of the Swale (as some people of honour say) than it is here? Has the singing of birds, the bleating of sheep, the lowing of herds, deafened you at Rainton? Did the vast old oaks and thick groves in Northumberland keep off the sun too much from you? I am too civil to extend my enquiries beyond Berwick. Every thing, doubtless, must im∣prove upon you as you advanced northward. You must tell me, though, about Melross, Rosslin Chapel, and Arbroath. In short, your Port-feuille must be so full, that I only desire a loose chapter or two, and will wait for the rest till it comes out.</P>

<P>I Should have told you that Caradoc came safe to hand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A second manuscript of Caractacus with the Odes inserted.</NOTE>; but my critical faculties have been so taken up in dividing <HI>no∣thing</HI> with an old woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Rogers, died about this time, and left Mr. Gray and Mrs. Olliffe, an∣other of his aunts, her joint executors.</NOTE>, that they are not yet composed enough for a better and more tranquil employment: shortly, however, I will make them obey me.

I say that Mador must be entirely a Briton; and that his pre-eminence among his companions must be shewn by superior wildness, more barbaric fancy, and a more striking and deeper harmony both of words and numbers: if British antiquity be too narrow, this is the place for invention; and if it be pure invention, so much the clearer must the expression be, and so much the stronger and richer the imagery.

<P>I this day past through the jaws of a great leviathan into the den of Dr. Templeman, superintendant of the reading-room, who congratulated himself on the sight of so much good com∣pany. We were, first, a man that writes for Lord Royston; 2dly, a man that writes for Dr. Burton, of York; 3dly, a man that writes for the Emperor of Germany, or Dr. Pocock, for he speaks the worst English I ever heard; 4thly, Dr. Stukely, who writes for himself, the very worst person he could write for; and, lastly, I, who only read to know if there be any thing worth writing, and that not without some difficulty. I find that they printed 1000 copies of the Harleian Catalogue, and have sold only fourscore; that they have 900l. a year income, and spend 1300, and are building apartments for the under∣keepers; so I expect in winter to see the collection advertised and set to auction.</P>

<P>I Am not sorry to hear you are exceeding busy, except as it has deprived me of the pleasure I should have in hearing often from you; and as it has been occasioned by a little vexa∣tion and disappointment. To find one's self business, I am per∣suaded, is the great art of life; I am never so angry, as when I hear my acquaintance wishing they had been bred to some poking profession, or employed in some office of drudgery, as if it were pleasanter to be at the command of other people than at one's own; and as if they could not go unless they were wound up: yet I know and feel what they mean by this com∣plaint; it proves that some spirit, something of genius (more than common) is required to teach a man how to employ him∣self: I say a man; for women, commonly speaking, never feel this distemper, they have always something to do; time hangs not on their hands (unless they be fine Ladies); a variety of small inventions and occupations fill up the void, and their eyes are never open in vain.</P>
<P>As to myself, I have again found rest for the sole of my gouty foot in your old dining-room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The house in Southampton-Row, where Mr. Gray lodged, had been te∣nanted by Dr. Wharton; who, on account of his ill health, left London the year before, and was removed to his paternal estate at Old Park, near Durham.</NOTE>, and hope that you will find at least an equal satisfaction at Old Park; if your bog prove as comfortable as my oven, I shall see no occasion to pity you, and only wish you may brew no worse than I bake.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="280"/>
You totally mistake my talents, when you impute to me any magical skill in planting roses: I know I am no conjurer in these things; when they are done I can find fault, and that is all. Now this is the very reverse of genius, and I feel my own littleness. Reasonable people know themselves better than is commonly imagined; and therefore (though I never saw any instance of it) I believe Mason when he tells me that he un∣derstands these things. The prophetic eye of taste (as Mr. Pitt called it) sees all the beauties, that a place is susceptible of, long before they are born; and when it plants a seedling, already sits under the shadow of it, and enjoys the effect it will have from every point of view that lies in prospect. You must there∣fore invoke Caractacus, and he will send his spirits from the top of Snowdon to Cross-fell or Warden-law.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your antique news. Froissard is a favourite book of mine (though I have not attentively read him, but only dipped here and there); and it is strange to me that people, who would give thousands for a dozen portraits (originals of that time) to furnish a gallery, should never cast an eye on so many moving pictures of the life, actions, manners, and thoughts of their ancestors, done on the spot, and in strong, though simple colours. In the succeeding century Froissard, I find, was read with great satisfaction by every body that could read; and on the same footing with King Arthur, Sir Tristram, and Archbishop Turpin: not because they thought him a fabu∣lous writer, but because they took them all for true and au∣thentic historians; to so little purpose was it in that age for a man to be at the pains of writing truth. Pray, are you come to the four Irish Kings that went to school to King Richard

<P>The town are reading the King of Prussia's Poetry <HI>(Le Phi∣losophe sans Souci),</HI> and I have done like the town; they do not seem so sick of it as I am: It is all the scum of Voltaire and Lord Bolingbroke, the Crambe-recocta of our worst Free∣thinkers, tossed up in German-French rhyme. Tristram Shan∣dy is still a greater object of admiration, the man as well as the book; one is invited to dinner, where he dines, a fortnight be∣fore: As to the volumes yet published, there is much good fun in them, and humour sometimes hit and sometimes missed. Have you read his sermons, with his own comic figure, from a painting by Reynolds, at the head of them? They are in the style I think most proper for the pulpit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author was of opinion, that it was the business of the Preacher rather to persuade by the power of eloquence to the practice of known duties, than to reason with the art of logic on points of controverted doctrine: Hence, there∣fore, he thought that sometimes imagination might not be out of its place in a sermon. But let him speak for himself in an extract from one of his letters to me in the following year: <Q REND="inline">"Your quotation from Jeremy Taylor is a fine one, I have long thought of reading him; for I am persuaded that chopping logic in the pulpit, as our divines have done ever since the revolution, is not the thing; but that imagination and warmth of expression, are in their place there, as much as on the stage; moderated, however, and chastised a little by the purity and severity of religion."</Q></NOTE>, and shew a strong imagination and a sensible heart; but you see him often totter∣ing on the verge of laughter, and ready to throw his periwig in the face of the audience.</P>

<P>THOUGH you have had but a melancholy employment, it is worthy of envy, and (I hope) will have all the suc∣cess it deserves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Stonhewer was now at Houghton-le-Spring, in the Bishoprick of Dur∣ham, attending on his sick father, rector of that parish.</NOTE>. It was the best and most natural method of cure, and such as could not have been administered by any but your gentle hand. I thank you for communicating to me what must give you so much satisfaction.</P>
<P>I too was reading M. D'Alembert<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Two subsequent volumes of his <Q REND="inline">"Melanges de Literature &amp; Philosophie."</Q></NOTE>, and (like you) am totally disappointed in his Elements. I could only taste a little of the first course: it was dry as a stick, hard as a stone, and cold as a cucumber. But then the Letter to Rousseau is like himself; and the Discourses on Elocution, and on the Liberty of Music, are divine. He has added to his translations from Tacitus; and (what is remarkable) though that Author's manner more nearly resembles the best French Writers of the present age, than any thing, he totally fails in the attempt. Is it his fault, or that of the language?</P>
<P>I have received another Scotch packet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Of the fragments of Erse Poetry, many of which Mr. Gray saw in manu∣script before they were published. In a letter to Dr. Wharton, written in the following month, he thus expresses himself on the same subject: <Q REND="inline">"If you have seen Mr. Stonhewer, he has probably told you of my old Scotch (or rather Irish Poetry), I am gone mad about them; they are said to be translations (literal and in prose) from the Erse tongue, done by one Macpherson, a young clergy∣man in the Highlands: He means to publish a collection he has of these speci∣mens of antiquity, if it be antiquity; but what perplexes me is, I cannot come at any certainty on that head. I was so struck with their beauty, that I writ into Scotland to make a thousand enquiries; the letters I have in return, are ill wrote, ill reasoned, unsatisfactory, calculated (one would imagine) to deceive, and yet not cunning enough to do it cleverly. In short, the whole external evidence would make one believe these fragments counterfeit; but the internal is so strong on the other side, that I am resolved to believe them ge∣nuine, spite of the Devil and the Kirk: it is impossible to conceive that they were written by the same man that writes me these letters; on the other hand, it is almost as hard to suppose (if they are original) that he should be able to trans∣late them so admirably. In short, this man is the very daemon of poetry, or he has lighted on a treasure hid for ages. The Welch Poets are also coming to light; I have seen a discourse in manuscript about them, by one Mr. Evans, a clergyman, with specimens of their writing, this is in Latin; and though it does not approach the other, there are fine scraps among it."</Q></NOTE> with a third speci∣men, inferior in kind, (because it is merely description) but yet
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>
full of nature and noble wild imagination. Five Bards pass the night at the Castle of a Chief (himself a principal Bard); each goes out in his turn to observe the face of things, and returns with an extempore picture of the changes he has seen (it is an October night, the harvest-month of the Highlands). This is the whole plan; yet there is a contrivance, and a preparation of ideas, that you would not expect. The oddest thing is, that every one of them sees Ghosts (more or less). The idea, that struck and surprised me most, is the following. One of them (describing a storm of wind and rain) says<Q><L>Ghosts ride on the tempest to-night:</L>
<L>Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind;</L>
<L><HI>Their songs are of other worlds!</HI></L></Q> <PB N="281" REF="284"/>
Did you never observe <HI>(while rocking winds are piping loud)</HI> that pause, as the gust is recollecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a shrill and plaintive note, like the swell of an Aeolian harp? I do assure you there is nothing in the world so like the voice of a spirit. Thomson had an ear sometimes: he was not deaf to this; and has described it gloriously, but given it an∣other different turn, and of more horrour. I cannot repeat the lines: it is in his Winter. There is another very fine picture in one of them. It describes the breaking of the clouds after the storm, before it is settled into a calm, and when the moon is seen by short intervals.<Q><L>The waves are tumbling on the lake,</L>
<L>And lash the rocky sides.</L>
<L>The boat is brim-full in the cove,</L>
<L>The oars on the rocking tide.</L>
<L>Sad sits a maid beneath a cliff,</L>
<L>And eyes the rolling stream:</L>
<L>Her Lover promised to come,</L>
<L>She saw his boat (when it was evening) on the lake;</L>
<L><HI>Are these his groans in the gale?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is this his broken boat on the shore?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of this descriptive piece has been since published in a note to a Poem, entitled CROMA, (see Ossian's Poems, vol. 1st, p. 350, 8vo.) It is some∣what remarkable that the manuscript in the translator's own hand, which I have in my possession, varies considerably from the printed copy. Some images are omitted, and others added. I will mention one which is not in the manuscript, <HI>the spirit of the mountain shrieks.</HI> In the tragedy of Douglas, published at least three years before, I always admired this fine line, <HI>the angry spirit of the water skriek'd.</HI> Quere, Did Mr. Home take this sublime image from Ossian, or has the translator of Ossian since borrowed it from Mr. Home?</NOTE></L></Q></P>

Company and cards at home, parties by land and water abroad, and (what they call) <HI>doing something,</HI> that is, racketing about from morning to night, are occupations, I find, that wear out my spirits; especially in a situation where one might sit still, and be alone with pleasure; for the place was a hill<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Near Henley.</NOTE> like Clifden, opening to a very extensive and diversified landscape, with the Thames, which is navigable, running at its foot.</P>

What have you done to him? for I never heard his name before; he makes very to∣lerable fun with me where I understand him (which is not every where); but seems more angry with you. Lest people should not understand the humour of the thing (which indeed to do they must have our Lyricisms at their finger ends) letters come out in Lloyd's Evening-Post to tell them who and what it was that he meant, and says it is like to produce a great combustion in the Literary World.

It is for the sake of shewing how Mr. Gray felt on such occasions, that I publish this letter.</NOTE>. The Monthly Review, I see, just now has much stuff about us on this occasion.

The Erse Fragments have been published five weeks ago in Scotland, though I had them not (by a mistake) till the other day. As you tell me new things do not reach you soon at Aston, I inclose what I can; the rest shall follow, when you tell me whether you have not got the pamphlet already. I send the two to Mr. Wood which I had before, because he has not <HI>the affectation of not admiring</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was rather a want of credulity than admiration that Mr. Gray should have laid to my charge. I suspected that, whether the Fragments were genuine or not, they were by no means literally translated. I suspect so still; and a former note gives a sufficient cause for that suspicion. See page 281.</NOTE>. I have another from Mr. Macpherson, which he has not printed; it is mere descrip∣tion, but excellent too in its kind. If you are good and will learn to admire, I will transcribe and send it.</P>
<P>As to their authenticity, I have made many enquiries, and have lately procured a letter from Mr. David Hume, (the hi∣storian) which is more satisfactory than any thing I have yet met with on that subject. He says,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certain it is that these poems are in every body's mouth in the Highlands, have been handed down from Father to Son, and are of an age beyond all memory and tradition. Adam Smith, the celebrated Professor in Glasgow, told me, that the Piper of the Argyleshire Militia repeated to him all those which Mr. Macpherson had translated, and many more of equal beauty. Major Mackay (Lord Rae's brother) told me that he remembers them perfectly well; as likewise did the Laird of Macfarline, (the greatest Antiquarian we have in
<PB N="286" REF="289"/>
this country) and who insists strongly on the historical truth, as well as the poetical beauty of these productions. I could add the Laird and Lady Macleod, with many more, that live in different parts of the Highlands, very remote from each other, and could only be acquainted with what had become (in a manner) national works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this external evidence and much more has since been collected and pub∣lished by Dr. Blair (see his Appendix to his Critical Dissertation on the works of Ossian); and yet notwithstanding a later Irish writer has been hardy enough to assert, that the Poems in question abound with the strangest anachronisms: for instance, that Cucullin lived in the first, and Fingal in the third century; two princes who are said to have made war with the Danes, a nation never heard of in Europe till tee ninth; which war could not possibly have happened till 500 years after the death of the supposed Poet who sings it. (See O'Halloran's Intro∣duction to the Study of the History and Antiquities of Ireland, quarto, 1772.) To whatever side of the question truth may lean, it is of little moment to me; my doubts arising (as I have said in the former note) from internal evidence only, and a want of proof of the fidelity of the translation.</NOTE>. There is a country Surgeon in Lochaber, who has by heart the entire Epic Poem men∣tioned by Mr. Macpherson in his preface; and, as he is old, is perhaps the only person living that knows it all, and has never committed it to writing, we are in the more haste to recover a monument, which will certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the Republic of Letters: we have therefore set about a subscription of a guinea or two guineas a piece, in order to enable Mr. Macpherson to undertake a mission into the Highlands to recover this poem, and other fragments of antiquity."</Q> He adds too, that the names of Fingal, Ossian, Oscar, &amp;c. are still given in the Highlands to large Mastiffs, as we give to ours the names of Caesar, Pompey, Hector, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The Nouvelle Heloise cruelly disappointed me, but it has its partisans, amongst which are Mason and Mr. Hurd; for me, I admire nothing but Fingal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter to another friend, informing him that he had sent Fingal down to him, he says, <Q REND="inline">"For my part I will stick to my credulity, and if I am cheated, think it is worse for him (the translator) than for me.

You are to observe, as you tend your plantations and take your walks, how the spring advances in the north, and whether Old Park most resembles Upsal or Stratton. The latter has on one side a bar∣ren black heath, on the other a light sandy loam, all the coun∣try about it is a dead flat; you see it is necessary you should know the situation (I do not mean any reflection upon any body's place); and this is the description Mr. Stillingfleet gives of his friend Mr. Marsham's seat, to which he retires in the summer and botanizes. I have lately made an acquaintance with this Philosopher, who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support some near relations who depend upon him; he is always employed, consequently (according to my old maxim) always happy, always chearful, and seems to me a very worthy honest man: his present scheme is to send some persons properly qualified to reside a year or two in Attica, to make themselves acquainted with the climate, productions, and natural history of the country, that we may understand Aristotle, Theophra∣stus, &amp;c. who have been Heathen Greek to us for so many ages; and this he has got proposed to Lord Bute, no unlikely person to put it into execution, as he is himself a botanist.</P>

<P>I Cannot pity you; <HI>au contraire,</HI> I wish I had been at Aston, when I was foolish enough to go through the six volumes of the <HI>Nouvelle Héloise.</HI> All I can say for myself is, that I was confined for three weeks at home by a severe cold, and had no∣thing better to do: There is no one event in it that might not happen any day of the week (separately taken) in any private family; yet these events are so put together, that the series of them is more absurd and more improbable than Amadis de Gaul. The dramatis personae (as the author says) are all of them good characters; I am sorry to hear it: for had they been all hanged at the end of the third volume, nobody (I believe) would have cared. In short, I went on and on, in hopes of finding some wonderful <HI>denouement</HI> that would set all right, and bring something like nature and interest out of absurdity and insipi∣dity: no such thing, it grows worse and worse; and (if it be Rousseau's, which is not doubted) is the strongest instance I ever saw, that a very extraordinary man may entirely mistake his own talents. By the motto and preface, it appears to be his own story, or something similar to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it be considered that Mr. Gray always preferred expression and sentiment to the arrangement of a story, it may seem somewhat extraordinary that the many striking beauties of these kinds, with which this singular work abounds, were not excepted from so general a censure; for my own part (to use a phrase of his own) <Q REND="inline">"they strike me blind"</Q> to all the defects which he has here enumerated.</NOTE></P>

The Opera-House is crouded this year like any ordinary Theatre. Elisi is finer than any thing that has been here in your memory: yet, as I suspect, has been finer than he is: he appears to be near forty, a little pot-bellied and thick-shouldered, otherwise no bad figure; his action proper, and not ungraceful. We have heard nothing, since I remember Operas, but eternal passages, divisions, and flights of execution: of these he has absolutely none; whether merely from judgment, or a little from age, I will not affirm; his point is expression, and to that all the graces and ornaments he inserts (which are few and short) are evidently directed: He goes higher (they say) than Farinelli; but then this celestial note you do not hear above once in a whole Opera; and he falls from this altitude at once to the mellowest, softest, strongest tones (about the middle of his compass) that can be heard. The Mattei, I assure you, is much improved by his example, and by her great success this winter; but then the Burlettas, and the Paganina, I have not been so pleased with any thing these many years: She too is fat, and above forty, yet handsome withal, and has a face that speaks the language of all nations: She has not the invention, the fire, and the variety of action that the Spiletta had; yet she is light, agile, ever in motion, and above all graceful; but then her voice, her ear, her taste in singing: Good God—as Mr. Richardson the painter says. Pray, ask Lord *; for I think I have seen him there once or twice, as much pleased as I was.</P>

<P>I wrote to Lord **** on his recovery; and he answers me very chearfully, as if his illness had been but slight, and the pleurisy were no more than a hole in one's stocking. He got it (he says) not by scampering, racketing, and riding post, as I had supposed; but by going with Ladies to Vauxhall. He is the picture (and pray so tell him, if you see him) of an old Alderman that I knew, who, after liv∣ing forty years on the fat of the land, (not milk and honey, but arrack punch and venison) and losing his great toe with a mortification, said to the last, that he owed it to two grapes, which he eat one day after dinner.

<P>DOctissime Domine, anne tibi arrident <HI>complimenta?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Taylor Howe, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Ongar in Essex, an honorary Fellow of Pembroke-Hall, was now on his travels in Italy, where he had made an acquain∣tance with the celebrated Count Algarotti, and had recommended to him Mr. Gray's Poems and my Dramas. After the perusal he received a Letter from the Count, written in that style of superlative panegyric peculiar to Italians. A copy of this letter Mr. Howe had just now sent to our common friend Mr. Brown, then President of the College; and also another of the Count's, addressed to Sig<SUP>r</SUP>. Para∣disi, a Tuscan Poet; in which, after explaining the arguments of my two Dra∣matic Poems, he advises him to translate them; but principally Caractacus.—This anecdote not only explains the above paragraph, but the subsequent Letter.</NOTE> If so, I hope your vanity is tickled with the <HI>verghe d'oro</HI> of Count Algarotti, and the intended translation of Sig<SUP>r</SUP>. Ago∣stino Paradisi: for my part, I am ravished (for I too have my share). Are you upon the road to see all these wonders, and snuff up the incense of Pisa; or has Mr. Brown abated your ardour by sending you the originals? I am waiting with impa∣tience for your coming.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your Drawing and very <HI>learned</HI> dis∣sertation annexed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This relates to the ruin of a small Gothic chapel near the north-west end of the cathedral at York, not noticed by Drake in his Eboracum. When Mr. Gray made me a visit at that place the summer before, he was much struck with the beautiful proportion of the windows in it, which induced me to get Mr. Paul Sandby to make a drawing of it; and also to endeavour, in a Letter to Mr. Gray, to explain to what foundation it belonged. As his answer contains some excellent general remarks on Gothic building, I thought proper to publish it, tho' the particular matter which occasioned them was not of any great consequence.</NOTE>. You have made out your point with a
<PB N="295" REF="298"/>
great degree of probability, (for tho' the <HI>nimis adhoesit</HI> might startle one, yet the sale of the tithes and chapel to Webster seems to set all right again) and I do believe the building in question was the chapel of St. Sepulchre. But then, that the ruin now standing was the individual chapel as erected by Archbishop Roger, I can by no means think: I found myself merely on the style and taste of architecture. The vaults under the choir are still in being, and were undoubtedly built by this very Arch∣bishop: they are truly Saxon; only that the arches are pointed, though very obtusely. It is the south transept (not the north) that is the oldest part of the minster now above ground: it is said to have been begun by Geffrey Plantagenet, who died about thirty years after Roger, and left it unfinished. His successor, Walter Grey, compleated it; so we do not exactly know to which of these two prelates we are to ascribe any certain part of it. Grey lived a long time, and was Archbishop from 1216 to 1255 (39 Henry III.); and in this reign it was, that the beauty of the Gothic architecture began to appear. The chap∣ter-house is in all probability his work, and (I should suppose) built in his latter days; whereas what he did of the south tran∣sept might be performed soon after his accession. It is in the second order of this building, that the round arches appear in∣cluding a row of pointed ones, (which you mention, and which I also observed) similar to those in St. Sepulchre's chapel, tho' far inferior in the proportions and neatness of workmanship. The same thing is repeated in the north transept; but this is only an imitation of the other, done for the sake of regularity; for this part of the building is no older than Archbishop Ro∣maine, who came to the see in 1285, and died 1295.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299"/>
All the buildings of Henry the Second's time (under whom Roger lived and died, 1185) are of a clumsy and heavy pro∣portion, with a few rude and aukward ornaments; and this style continues to the beginning of Henry the Third's reign, though with a little improvement, as in the nave of Fountain's abbey, &amp;c. then all at once come in the tall picked arches, the light clustered columns, the capitals of curling foliage, the fretted tabernacles and vaultings, and a profusion of statues, &amp;c. that constitute the good Gothic style; together with decreasing and flying buttresses, and pinnacles, on the outside. Nor must you conclude any thing from Roger's own tomb, which has (I remember) a wide surbased arch with scalloped ornaments, &amp;c. for this can be no older than the nave itself, which was built by Archbishop Melton after the year 1315, one hundred and thirty years after Roger's death.</P>
<P>I have compared Helvetius and Elfrida, as you desired me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the plagiarism, to which Mr. Gray here alludes, is but little known, and, I think, for its singularity, is somewhat curious, I shall beg the reader's patience while I dilate upon it; tho' I am aware it will stretch this note to an unconscion∣able length. M. Helvetius, in the third chapter of his third Essay de l'Esprit, which treats of the Extent of Memory, means to prove that this faculty, in the extreme, is not necessary to constitute a great Genius. For this purpose he examines whe∣ther the greatness of the very different talents of Locke and of Milton ought to be considered as the effect of their possessing this talent in an extraordinary degree. He then proceeds as follows: <Q REND="inline">"As the last example of the small extent of memory ne∣cessary to a fine imagination, I shall give in a note <HI>the translation of a piece of English poetry;</HI> which, with the preceding, will, I believe, prove to those who would decompose the works of illustrious men, that a great genius does not necessarily suppose a great memory."</Q> I now set down that note with references to Elfrida underneath it, and I chuse to give it in the English translation printed in 1759, that the parallel passages may be the more obvious at first sight. <Q REND="inline">"A young Virgin, awaked and guided by Love, goes before the appearance of Aurora to a valley, where she waits for the coming of her Lover, who, at the rising of the sun, is to offer a sacrifice to the Gods. Her soul, in the soft situation in which she is placed by the hopes of approaching happiness, indulges, while waiting for him, the pleasure of contemplating the beauties of Nature, and the rising of that luminary that was to bring the object of her tenderness."</Q> She expresses herself thus:
<Q>"<HI>Already the Sun gilds the tops of those antique Oaks, and the waves of those falling torrents that roar among the rocks shine with his beams; already I perceive the summit of those shaggy mountains whence arise the vaults which, half-concealed in the air, offer a formidable retreat to the Solitary who there retires</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>How nobly does this venerable wood,</L>

Ye flowers that inclose in your bosoms the odours that cool night condenses there, open your buds, and exhale in the air your balmy vapours. I know not whether the delightful intoxica∣tion that possesses my soul, does not embellish whatever I behold; but the rivulet, that in pleasing meanders winds along this valley, enchants me with his murmurs. <HI>Zephyrus caresses me with his breath; the fragrant plants, pressed under my feet, waft to my senses their perfume. Oh! if Felicity sometimes con∣descends to visit the abode of mortals, to these places, doubtless, she retires</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>The soft air</L>

<L>If e'er Content deign'd visit mortal clime,</L>
<L>This was her place of dearest residence.</L></Q></NOTE>. But with what secret trouble am I agitated? Already Impatience mingles its poi∣son with the sweetness of my expectation. This valley has already lost all its beauties. Is Joy then so fleeting? <HI>It is as easy to snatch it from us, as for the light down of these plants to be blown away by the breath of the Zephyrs</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>For Safety now sits wav'ring on your love,</L>
<L>Like the light do n upon the thistle's beard,</L>

What duty more sacred than that of calming the inquietudes of Love! But what do I say? <HI>Fly jealous suspicions, injurious to his fidelity</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Avaunt! ye vain delusive fears.</L></Q></NOTE>, and formed to extinguish my tenderness. <HI>If Jealousy grows by the side of Love, it will stifle it, if not pulled up by the roots; it is the Ivy which, by a verdant chain, em∣braces, but dries up the trunk which serves for its support</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>See, Elfrida;</L>
<L>Ah see! how round yon branching Elm the <HI>Ivy</HI></L>
<L>Clasps its <HI>green chain,</HI> and poisons what supports it.</L>
<L>Not less injurious to the shoots of Love</L>
<L>Is sickly Jealousy.</L></Q></NOTE>. I know my Lover too well to doubt of his tenderness. He, like me, has, far from the pomp of courts, sought the tranquil asylum of the fields. Touched by the simplicity of my heart, and by my beauty, my sensual rivals call him in vain to their arms. Shall he be seduced by the advances of coquetry, <HI>which, on the cheek of the young maid, tarnishes the snow of innocence and the carnation of modesty, and daubs it with the whiteness of art and the paint of effrontery</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—To guard</L>
<L>Your beauties from the blast of courtly gales.</L>
<L>The crimson blush of virgin Modesty,</L>
<L>The delicate soft tints of Innocence,</L>
<L>There all fly off, and leave no boast behind</L>
<L>But well-rang'd, faded features.</L></Q></NOTE>? What do I say? his contempt for her is perhaps only a snare for me. Can I be ignorant of the partiality of men, and the arts they employ to seduce us? Nourished in a con∣tempt for our Sex, it is not Us, it is their pleasures that they love. Cruel as they are, they have placed in the rank of the virtues the barbarous fury of revenge, and the mad love of their country; but never have they reckoned fidelity among the virtues. Without remorse they abuse innocence, and often their vanity contemplates our griefs with delight. But no; fly far from me, ye odious thoughts, my Lover will come! A thousand times have I experienced it: <HI>As soon as I perceive him my agitated mind is calm, and I often forget the too just cause I have for complaint; for near him I can only know happiness</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—My truant heart</L>
<L>Forgets each lesson that Resentment taught,</L>
<L>And in thy sight knows only to be happy.</L></Q>
In the French it is more literal, <Q REND="inline">"Pres de lui je ne scâis qu'etre heureuse."</Q></NOTE>. Yet if he is treacherous to me; if, in the very moment when my love excuses him, he consummates the crime of infidelity in another bosom, may all nature take up arms in revenge! may he perish! What do I say? <HI>Ye Elements, be deaf to my cries! Thou Earth, open not thy profound abyss! let the Monster walk the time pre∣scribed him on thy splendid surface, let him still commit new crimes, and still cause the tears of the too credulous maids to flow; and if heaven avenges them and pu∣nishes him, may it at least be at the prayer of some other unfortunate woman</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Till then, ye Elements, rest; and thou, firm Earth,</L>
<L>Ope not thy yawning jaws; but let this Monster</L>
<L>Stalk his due time on thine affrighted surface:</L>
<L>Yes, let him still go on, still execute</L>
<L>His savage purposes, and daily make</L>
<L>More widows weep, as I do.</L></Q>
Here ends this odd instance of plagiarism. When M. Helvetius was in Eng∣land, a year or two after I had made the discovery of it, I took my measures (as Mr. Gray advised me) to learn how he came by it; and accordingly requested two Noblemen, to whom he was introduced, to ask him some questions concern∣ing it; but I could gain no satisfactory answer. I do not, however, by any means, suppose that the person who cooked up the disjointed parts of my Drama into this strange Fricasee, was M. Helvetius himself; I rather imagine (as I did from the first) that he was imposed upon by some young English traveller, who contrived this expedient in order to pass with him for a Poet. The great Philo∣sopher, it is true, has in this note been proved to be <HI>the receiver of Stolen Goods;</HI> but out of respect to his numerous fashionable disciples, both abroad and at home, whose credit might suffer with that of their Master, I acquit him of what would only be held criminal at the Old Bailey, that he received these goods <HI>knowing them to be stolen.</HI></NOTE>."</Q></NOTE>, and find thirteen parallel passages; five of which, at least, are

so direct and close as to leave no shadow of a doubt, and there∣fore confirm all the rest. It is a phaenomenon that you will be in the right to inform yourself about, and which I long to understand.
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>
Another phaenomenon is, that I read it without finding it out: all I remember is, that I thought it not at all <HI>English,</HI> and did not much like it; and the reason is plain, for

<P><PB N="301" REF="304"/>
I was not born so far from the sun, as to be ignorant of Count Algarotti's name and reputation; nor am I so far advanced in years, or in philosophy, as not to feel the warmth of his ap∣probation. The Odes in question, as their motto shews, were meant to be <HI>vocal to the intelligent alone.</HI> How few they were in my own country, Mr. Howe can testify; and yet my ambi∣tion was terminated by that small circle. I have good reason to be proud, if my voice has reached the ear and apprehension of a stranger, distinguished as one of the best judges in Europe.</P>
<P>I am equally pleased with the just applause he bestows on Mr. Mason; and particularly on his Caractacus, which is the work of a Man: whereas Elfrida is only that of a Boy, a pro∣mising boy indeed, and of no common genius: yet this is the popular performance, and the other little known in compa∣rison.</P>
<P>Neither Count Algarotti nor Mr. Howe (I believe) have heard of Ossian, the Son of Fingal. If Mr. Howe were not upon the wing, and on his way homewards, I would send it to him in Italy. He would there see that Imagination dwelt many hundred years ago, in all her pomp, on the cold and barren mountains of Scotland. The truth (I believe) is, that, without any respect of climates, she reigns in all nascent socie∣ties of men, where the necessities of life force every one to think and act much for himself.</P>

<P>YOU may well wonder at my long taciturnity. I wonder too, and know not what cause to assign; for it is certain I think of you daily. I believe it is owing to the nothingness of my history; for except six weeks that I passed in Town towards the end of the spring, and a little jaunt to Epsom and Box-hill, I have been here time out of mind, in a place where no events grow, tho' we preserve those of former days, by way of <HI>Hortus siccus</HI> in our libraries.</P>
<P>I doubt you have not yet read Rousseau's Emile. Every body that has children should read it more than once: for tho' it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity, tho' his general scheme of education be an impracticable chimera, yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths bet∣ter expressed than ever they were before, that may be of ser∣vice to the wisest men. Particularly I think he has observed children with more attention, and knows their meaning and the working of their little passions better than any other writer. As to his religious discussions, which have alarmed the world, and engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his book, I set them all at nought, and wish they had been omit∣ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That I may put together the rest of Mr. Gray's sentiments concerning this singular writer, I insert here an extract from a Letter of later date, written to my∣self. <Q REND="inline">"I have not read the Philosophic Dictionary. I can now stay with great patience for any thing that comes from Voltaire. They tell me it is frippery, and blasphemy, and wit. I could have forgiven myself if I had not read Rous∣seau's Lettres de la Montagne. Always excepting the Contract social, it is the dullest performance he ever published. It is a weak attempt to separate the miracles from the morality of the gospel. The latter (he would have you think) he believes was sent from God; and the former he very explicitly takes for an imposture: this is in order to prove the cruelty and injustice of the State of Geneva in burning his Emile. The latter part of his book is to shew the abuses that have crept into the constitution of his country, which point (if you are concerned about it) he makes out very well; and his intention in this is plainly to raise a tumult in the city, and to be revenged on the <HI>Petit Conseil,</HI> who condemned his writings to the flames."</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March,</HI> 1765.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY instructions, of which you are so desirous, are two∣fold: the first part relates to what is past, and that will be rather diffuse: the second, to what is to come; and that we shall treat more succinctly, and with all due brevity.</P>
<P>First, when you come to Paris you will not fail to visit the cloister of the Chartreuse, where Le Sueur (in the history of St. Bruno) has almost equalled Raphael. Then your Gothic inclinations will naturally lead you to the Sainte Chapelle built by St. Louis: in the treasury is preserved one of the noblest gems of the Augustan age. When you take a trip into the country, there is a fine old chapel at Vincennes with
<PB N="305" REF="308"/>
admirable painted windows; and at Fontainbleau, the remains of Francis the First's magnificence might give you some plea∣sure. In your way to Lyons you will take notice of the view over the Saone, from about Tournus and Macon. Fail not to walk a few miles along the banks of the Rhone, down the river. I would certainly make a little journey to the Grande Chartreuse, up the mountains: at your return out of Italy this will have little effect. At Turin you will visit the Capuchins' convent just without the city, and the Superga at no great distance, for the sake of the views. At Genoa observe the Terreno of the Palace Brignoli, as a model of an apartment elegantly disposed in a hot climate. At Parma you will adore the great Madonna and St. Jerom, once at St. Antonio Abbate, but now (I am told) in the Ducal Palace. In the Madonna della Steccata observe the Moses breaking the tables, a chiaro∣scuro figure of the Parmeggiano at too great a height, and ill lighted, but immense. At the Capuchins, the great Pietá of Annib. Caracci; in the Villa Ducale, the room painted by Carlo Cignani; and the last works of Agostino Caracci at Mo∣dena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When our Author was himself in Italy, he studied with much attention the different manners of the old masters. I find a paper written at the time in which he has set down several subjects proper for painting, which he had never seen executed, and has affixed the names of different masters to each piece, to shew which of their pencils he thought would have been most proper to treat it. As I doubt not but this paper will be an acceptable present to the Reynolds's and West's of the age, I shall here insert it.</P>
<Q><P>"An Altar-Piece.—Guido.</P>
<P>The top, a Heaven; in the middle, at a distance, the Padre-Eterno indi∣stinctly seen, and lost, as it were, in glory. On either hand, Angels of all de∣grees in attitudes of adoration and wonder. A little lower, and next the eye, supported on the wings of Seraphs, Christ (the principal figure) with an air of calm and serene majesty, his hand extended, as commanding the elements to their several places: near him an Angel of superior rank bearing the golden com∣passes (that Milton describes); beneath the Chaos, like a dark and turbulent ocean, only illumined by the Spirit, who is brooding over it.</P>
<P>A small Picture.—Correggio.</P>
<P>Eve newly created, admiring her own shadow in the lake.</P>
<P><HI>The famous Venus of this master, now in the possession of Sir William Hamilton, proves how judiciously Mr. Gray fixed upon his pencil for the execution of this charming subject.</HI> M.</P>
<P>Another.—Domenichino.</P>
<P>Medea in a pensive posture, with revenge and maternal affection striving in her visage; her two children at play, sporting with one another before her. On one side a bust of Jason, to which they bear some resemblance.</P>
<P>A Statue.—Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>Agave in the moment she returns to her senses; the head of her Son, fallen on the ground from her hand.</P>
<P><HI>Vide Ovid. Met.</HI> lib. iii. l. 701, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
M.</P><P>A Picture.—Salvator Rosa.</P>
<P>Aeneas and the Sybil sacrificing to Pluto by torch-light in the wood, the assist∣ants in a fright. The Day beginning to break, so as dimly to show the mouth of the cavern.</P>
<P>Sigismonda with the heart of Guiscardo before her. I have seen a small print on this subject, where the expression is admirable, said to be graved from a pic∣ture of Correggio.</P>
<P><HI>Afterwards when he had seen the original in the possession of the late Sir Luke Schaub, he always expressed the highest admiration of it; tho' we see, by his here giving it to Salvator Rosa, he thought the subject too horrid to be treated by Coreggio; and indeed I believe it is agreed that the capital picture in question is not of his hand.</HI> M.</P>
<P>Another.—Albano, or the Parmeggiano.</P>
<P>Iphigenia asleep by the fountain-side, her maids about her; Cymon gazing and laughing.</P>
<P><HI>This subject has been often treated; once indeed very curiously by Sir Peter Lely, in the way of portrait, when his sacred Majesty Charles the Second represented Cymon, and the Dutchess of Cleveland and Mrs. Eleanor Gwin (in as indecent attitudes as his royal taste could prescribe) were Iphigenia and her attendants.</HI> M.</P>
<P>Another.—Domenichino, or the Caracci.</P>
<P>Electra with the urn, in which she imagined were her Brother's ashes, lament∣ing over them; Orestes smothering his concern.</P>
<P>Another.—Correggio.</P>
<P>Ithuriel and Zephon entering the bower of Adam and Eve; they sleeping. The light to proceed from the Angels.</P>
<P>Another.—Nicolas Poussin.</P>
<P>Alcestis dying; her children weeping, and hanging upon her robe; the youngest of them, a little boy, crying too, but appearing rather to do so, be∣cause the others are afflicted, than from any sense of the reason of their sorrow: her right arm should be round this, her left extended towards the rest, as recom∣mending them to her Lord's care; he sainting, and supported by the attendants.</P>
<P>Salvator Rosa.</P>
<P>Hannibal passing the Alps; the mountaineers rolling down rocks upon his army; elephants tumbling down the precipices.</P>
<P>Another.—Domenichino.</P>
<P>Arria giving Claudius's order to Paetus, and stabbing herself at the same time.</P>

<P>A Little journey I have been making to Arbroath, has been the cause that I did not answer your very obliging setter so soon as I ought to have done. A man of merit, that ho∣nours me with his esteem, and has the frankness to tell me so, doubtless can need no excuses: his apology is made, and we are already acquainted, however distant from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="312"/>
I fear I cannot (as I would wish) do myself the pleasure of waiting on you at Aberdeen, being under an engagement to go to-morrow to Taymouth, and, if the weather will allow it, to the Blair of Athol: this will take up four or five days, and at my return the approach of winter will scarce permit me to think of any farther expeditions northwards. My stay here will, however, be a fortnight or three weeks longer; and if in that time any business or invitation should call you this way, Lord Strathmore gives me commission to say, he shall be ex∣tremely glad to see you at Glames; and doubt not it will be a particular satisfaction to me to receive and thank you in person for the favourable sentiments you have entertained of me, and the civilities with which you have honoured me.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Dr. WHARTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Glames-Castle,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 14, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Deferred writing to you till I had seen a little more of this country than you yourself had seen; and now being just re∣turned from an excursion, which I and Major Lyon have been making, into the Highlands, I sit down to give you an account of it. But first I must return to my journey hither, on which I shall be very short; partly because you know the way as far as Edinburgh, and partly that there was not a great deal worth re∣marking. The first night we passed at Tweedmouth (77 miles); the next at Edinburgh (53 miles); where Lord Strathmore left the Major and me, to go to Lenox-Love, (Lord Blantyre's)
<PB N="310" REF="313"/>
where his Aunt lives: so that afternoon and all next day I had leisure to visit the Castle, Holyrood-House, Heriot's Hospital, Arthur's seat, &amp;c. and am not sorry to have seen that most pic∣turesque (at a distance), and nastiest (when near) of all capital cities. I supped with Dr. Robertson and other literati, and the next morning Lord Strathmore came for us. We crossed at the Queen's Ferry in a four-oared yawl without a sail, and were tossed about rather more than I should wish to hazard again; lay at Perth, a large Scotch town with much wood about it, on the banks of the Tay, a very noble river. Next morning ferried over it, and came by dinner-time to Glames; being (from Edin∣burgh) 67 miles, which makes in all (from Hetton) 197 miles. The castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is said to be the very Castle in which Duncan was murdered by Mac∣beth.</NOTE> stands in Strathmore (i. e. the Great Valley) which winds about from Stonehaven on the east coast of Kincardine∣shire, obliquely, as far as Stirling, near 100 miles in length, and from seven to ten miles in breadth, cultivated every where to the foot of the hills, on either hand, with oats or bere, a species of barley, except where the soil is mere peat-earth, (black as a coal) or barren sand covered only with broom and heath, or a short grass fit for sheep. Here and there appear, just above ground, the huts of the inhabitants, which they call Towns, built of, and covered with, turf; and among them, at great distances, the gentlemen's houses, with inclosures and a few trees round them.</P>
<P>Amidst these the Castle of Glames distinguishes itself, the middle part of it rising proudly out of what seems a great and thick wood of tall trees, with a cluster of hanging towers on the
<PB N="311" REF="314"/>
top. You descend to it gradually from the south, through a double and triple avenue of Scotch firs 60 or 70 feet high, under three gateways. This approach is a full mile long; and when you have passed the second gate, the firs change to limes, and an∣other oblique avenue goes off on either hand towards the offices. These, as well as all the inclosures that surround the house, are bordered with three or four ranks of sycamores, ashes, and white poplars of the noblest height, and from 70 to 100 years old. Other alleys there are, that go off at right angles with the long one; small groves, and walled gardens, of Earl Patrick's plant∣ing, full of broad-leaved elms, oaks, birch, black cherry-trees, laburnums, &amp;c. all of great stature and size, which have not till this week begun to shew the least sense of morning frosts. The third gate delivers you into a court with a broad pavement, and grass-plats adorned with statues of the four Stuart Kings, bordered with old silver firs and yew-trees, alternately, and opening with an iron palisade on either side to two square old∣fashioned parterres surrounded by stone fruit-walls. The house, from the height of it, the greatness of its mass, the many towers atop, and the spread of its wings, has really a very sin∣gular and striking appearance, like nothing I ever saw. You will comprehend something of its shape from the plan of the second floor, which I inclose. The wings are about 50 feet high; the body (which is the old castle, with walls 10 feet thick) is near 100. From the leads I see to the south of me (just at the end of the avenue) the little town of Glames, the houses built of stone, and slated, with a neat kirk and small square tower (a rarity in this region). Just beyond it rises a beautiful round hill, and another ridge of a longer form adja∣cent to it, both covered with woods of tall fir. Beyond them,
<PB N="312" REF="315"/>
peep over the black hills of Sid-law, over which winds the road to Dundee. To the north, within about seven miles of me, begin to rise the Grampians, hill above hill, on whose tops three weeks ago I could plainly see some traces of the snow that fell in May last. To the east, winds a way to the Strath, such as I have before described it, among the hills, which sink lower and lower as they approach the sea. To the west, the same valley (not plain, but broken, unequal ground) runs on for above 20 miles in view: there I see the crags above Dunkeld; there Beni-Gloe and Beni-More rise above the clouds; and there is that She-khallian, that spires into a cone above them all, and lies at least 45 miles (in a direct line) from this place.</P>
<P>Lord Strathmore, who is the greatest farmer in this neigh∣bourhood, is from break of day to dark night among his hus∣bandmen and labourers: he has near 2000 acres of land in his own hands, and is at present employed in building a low wall of four miles long, and in widening the bed of the little river Deane, which runs to south and south-east of the house, from about twenty to fifty feet wide, both to prevent inundations, and to drain the lake of Forfar. This work will be two years more in compleating, and must be three miles in length. All the Highlanders that can be got are employed in it; many of them know no English, and I hear them singing Erse songs all day long. The price of labour is eight pence a day; but to such as will join together, and engage to perform a certain por∣tion in a limited time, two shillings.</P>
<P>I must say that all his labours seem to prosper; and my Lord has casually found in digging such quantities of shell∣marl,
<PB N="313" REF="316"/>
as not only fertilize his own grounds, but are disposed of at a good price to all his neighbours. In his nurseries are thousands of oaks, beech, larches, horse-chesnuts, spruce-firs, &amp;c. thick as they can stand, and whose only fault is, that they are grown tall and vigorous before he has determined where to plant them out; the most advantageous spot we have for beauty lies west of the house, where (when the stone-walls of the meadows are taken away) the grounds, naturally unequal, will have a very park-like appearance: they are already full of trees, which need only thinning here and there to break the regularity of their trout-stream which joins the river Deane hard by. Pursuing the course of this brook upwards, you come to a narrow sequestered valley sheltered from all winds, thro' which it runs murmuring among great stones; on one hand the ground gently rises into a hill, on the other are the rocky banks of the rivulet almost perpendicular, yet covered with sycamore, ash, and fir, that (though it seems to have no place or soil to grow in) yet has risen to a good height, and forms a thick shade: you may continue along this gill, and passing by one end of the village and its church for half a mile, it leads to an opening between the two hills covered with fir-woods, that I mentioned above, through which the stream makes its way, and forms a cascade of ten or twelve feet over broken rocks. A very little art is necessary to make all this a beautiful scene. The weather, till the last week, has been in general very fine and warm; we have had no fires till now, and often have sat with the windows open an hour after sun-set: now and then a shower has come, and sometimes sudden gusts of wind descend from the moun∣tains, that finish as suddenly as they arose; but to-day it blows a hurricane. Upon the whole, I have been exceeding lucky in
<PB N="314" REF="317"/>
my weather, and particularly in my Highland expedition of five days.</P>
<P>We set out then the 11th of September, and continuing along the Strath to the west, passed through <HI>Megill,</HI> (where is the tomb of <HI>Queen Wanders, that was riven to dethe by staned horses for nae gade that she did;</HI> so the women there told me, I assure you) thro' Cowper of Angus: over the river Ila; then over a wide and dismal heath, fit for an assembly of witches, till we came to a string of four small lakes in a valley, whose deep blue waters and green margin, with a gentleman's house or two seated on them in little groves, contrasted with the black desert in which they were inchased. The ground now grew unequal; the hills, more rocky, seemed to close in upon us, till the road came to the brow of a steep descent, and (the sun then setting) between two woods of oak we saw far below us the river Tay come sweeping along at the bottom of a precipice, at least 150 feet deep, clear as glass, full to the brim, and very rapid in its course; it seemed to issue out of woods thick and tall, that rose on either hand, and were over-hung by broken rocky crags of vast height; above them, to the west, the tops of higher mountains appeared, on which the evening clouds re∣posed. Down by the side of the river, under the thickest shades, is seated the town of Dunkeld; in the midst of it stands a ruined cathedral, the towers and shell of the building still en∣tire: a little beyond it, a large house of the Duke of Athol, with its offices and gardens, extends a mile beyond the town; and as his grounds were interrupted by the streets and roads, he has flung arches of communication across them, that add to the scenery of the place, which of itself is built of good white
<PB N="315" REF="318"/>
stone, and handsomely slated; so that no one would take it for a Scotch town till they come into it. Here we passed the night; if I told you how, you would bless yourself.</P>
<P>Next day we set forward to Taymouth, 27 miles farther west; the road winding through beautiful woods, with the Tay almost always in full view to the right, being here from 3 to 400 feet over. The Strath-Tay, from a mile to three miles or more wide, covered with corn, and spotted with groups of people, then in the midst of their harvest; on either hand a vast chain of rocky mountains that changed their face and opened something new every hundred yards, as the way turned, or the clouds passed: in short, altogether it was one of the most pleasing days I have passed these many years, and at every step I wished for you. At the close of day we came to <HI>Balloch</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant, in his tour in Scotland, explains this word <Q REND="inline">"the Mouth of the Loch."</Q></NOTE>, so the place was called; but now <HI>Taymouth,</HI> improperly enough; for here it is that the river issues out of Loch-Tay, a glorious lake 15 miles long and one mile and a half broad, surrounded with prodigious mountains; there on its north-eastern brink, impending over it, is the vast hill of Lawers; to the east is that enormous creature, <HI>She-khallian</HI> (i. e. the maiden's pap) spiring above the clouds: directly west, beyond the end of the lake, <HI>Beni-More,</HI> the great mountain rises to a most awful height, and looks down on the tomb of Fingal. Lord Breadalbane's <HI>policy</HI> (so they call here all such ground as is laid out for pleasure) takes in about 2000 acres, of which his house, offices, and a deer-park, about three miles round, occupy the plain or bottom, which is little above a mile in
<PB N="316" REF="319"/>
breadth; through it winds the Tay, which, by means of a bridge, I found here to be 156 feet over: his plantations and woods rise with the ground, on either side the vale, to the very summit of the enormous crags that over-hang it: along them, on the mountain's side, runs a terrass a mile and a half long, that overlooks the course of the river. From several seats and temples perched on particular rocky eminences, you command the lake for many miles in length, which turns like some huge river, and loses itself among the mountains that surround it; at its eastern extremity, where the river issues out of it, on a peninsula my Lord has built a neat little town and church with a high square tower; and just before it lies a small round island in the lake, covered with trees, amongst which are the ruins of some little religious house.</P>
<P>Trees, by the way, grow here to great size and beauty. I saw four old chesnuts in the road, as you enter the park, of vast bulk and height; one beach tree I measured that was 16 feet 7 inches in the girth, and, I guess, near 80 feet in height. The gardener presented us with peaches, nectarines, and plums from the stone-walls of the kitchen-garden (for there are no brick nor hot walls); the peaches were good, the rest well tasted, but scarce ripe; we had also golden pippins from an espalier, not ripe, and a melon very well flavoured and fit to cut: of the house I have little to say; it is a very good nobleman's house, handsomely furnished and well kept, very comfortable to inhabit, but not worth going far to see. Of the Earl's taste I have not much more to say; it is one of those noble situations that Man cannot spoil: it is however certain, that he has built an inn and a town just where his principal walks should
<PB N="317" REF="320"/>
have been, and in the most wonderful spot of ground that per∣haps belongs to him. In this inn however we lay; and next day returning down the river four miles, we passed it over a fine bridge, built at the expence of the government, and continued our way to <HI>Logie-Rait,</HI> just below which, in a most charming scene, the <HI>Tummel,</HI> which is here the larger river of the two, falls into the Tay. We ferried over the Tummel in order to get into Marshal Wade's road, which leads from Dunkeld to Inverness, and continued our way along it toward the north: the road is excellent, but dangerous enough in conscience; the river often running directly under us at the bottom of a preci∣pice 200 feet deep, sometimes masked indeed by wood that finds means to grow where I could not stand, but very often quite naked and without any defence; in such places we walked for miles together, partly for fear, and partly to admire the beauty of the country, which the beauty of the weather set off to the greatest advantage: as evening came on, we approached the pass of Gillikrankie, where, in the year 1745, the Hessians, with their prince at their head, stopped short, and refused to march a foot farther.</P>
<P><HI>Vestibulum ante ipsum, primisque in faucibus Orci</HI> stands the solitary mansion of Mr. Robertson, of Fascley; close by it rises a hill covered with oak, with grotesque masses of rock staring from among their trunks, like the sullen countenances of Fin∣gal and all his family, frowning on the little mortals of modern days: from between this hill and the adjacent mountains, pent in a narrow channel, comes roaring out the river Tummel, and falls headlong down involved in white foam which rises into a mist all round it: but my paper is deficient, and I must say
<PB N="318" REF="321"/>
nothing of the pass itself, the black river Garry, the Blair of Athol, Mount Beni-Gloe, my return by another road to Dun∣keld, the Hermitage, the <HI>Stra-Bram,</HI> and the Rumbling Brig: in short, since I saw the Alps, I have seen nothing sublime till now. In about a week I shall set forward, by the Stirling road, on my return all alone. Pray for me till I see you, for I dread Edinburgh and the itch, and expect to find very little in my way worth the perils I am to endure.</P>

I embrace, with so deep and just a sense of their goodness, the substance of that honour they do me, that I hope it may plead my par∣don with them if I do not accept the form. I have been, Sir, for several years a member of the University of Cambridge, and formerly (when I had some thoughts of the profession) took a Bachelor of Laws' degree there; since that time, tho' long qualified by my standing, I have always neglected to finish my course, and claim my Doctor's degree: Judge, therefore, whether it will not look like a slight, and some sort of contempt,

<P>It is a pleasure to me to find that you are not offended with the liberties I took when you were at Glames; you took me too literally, if you thought I meant in the least to discourage you in your pursuit of poetry: all I intended to say was, that if either vanity (that is, a general and undistinguishing desire of applause), or interest, or ambition has any place in the breast of a poet, he stands a great chance in these our days of being severely disappointed; and yet, after all these passions are sup∣pressed, there may remain in the mind of one, <Q REND="inline">"ingenti percul∣sus amore"</Q>, (and such I take you to be) incitements of a bet∣ter sort, strong enough to make him write verse all his life, both for his own pleasure and that of all posterity.</P>
<P>I am sorry for the trouble you have had to gratify my curio∣sity and love of superstition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray, when in Scotland, had been very inquisitive after the popular superstitions of the country; his correspondent sent him two books on this sub∣ject, foolish ones indeed, as might be expected, but the best that could be had; a History of Second-sight, and a History of Witches.</NOTE>; yet I heartily thank you. On Monday, Sir, I set forward on my way to England; where if I can be of any little use to you, or should ever have the good fortune to see you, it will be a particular satisfaction to me.

<P>I Am amazed at myself when I think I have never wrote to you; to be sure it is the sin of witchcraft, or something worse. Had I been married, like Mason, some excuse might be made for it; who (for the first time since that great event) has just thought fit to tell me that he never passed so happy a winter as the last, and this in spite of his anxieties, which he says might even make a part of his happiness; for his wife is by no means in health, she has a constant cough: yet he is assured her lungs are not affected, and that it is nothing of the consumptive kind. As to, me I have been neither happy nor miserable; but in a gentle stupefaction of mind, and very tolerable health of body hitherto. If they last, I shall not much complain. The accounts one has lately had from all parts, make me suppose you buried in the snow like the old Queen of Denmark. As

soon as you are dug out, I should rejoice to hear your voice from the battlements of Old Park.</P>
<P>Every thing is politics. There are no literary productions worth your notice, at least of our country. The French have finished their great Encyclopedia in 17 volumes; but there are many flimsy articles very hastily treated, and great incorrectness of the press. There are now 13 volumes of Buffon's Natural History; and he is not come to the monkies yet, who are a nu∣merous people. The Life of Petrarch has entertained me; it is not well written, but very curious, and laid together from his own letters, and the original writings of the fourteenth cen∣tury: so that he takes in much of the history of those obscure times, and the characters of many remarkable persons. There are two volumes quarto; and another, unpublished yet, will compleat it.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole writes me now and then a long and lively letter from Paris; to which place he went last year with the gout upon him, sometimes in his limbs, often in his stomach and head. He has got somehow well, (not by means of the climate, one would think) goes to all public places, sees all the best company, and is very much in fashion. He says he sunk like Queen Eleanor at Charing-Cross, and has risen again at Paris. He returns in April. I saw the Lady you enquire after, when I was last in London, and a prodigious fine one she is. She had a strong suspicion of rouge on her cheeks, a cage of foreign birds and a piping bullfinch at her elbow; two little dogs on a cushion in her lap, and a cockatoo on her shoulder: they were all exceeding glad to see me, and I them.</P>

<P>WHatever my pen may do, I am sure my thoughts expa∣tiate no where oftener, or with more pleasure, than to Old Park. I hope you have made my peace with the angry little Lady. It is certain, whether her name were in my letter or not, she was as present to my memory as the rest of the whole family; and I desire you would present her with two kisses in my name, and one a-piece to all the others; for I shall take the liberty to kiss them all, (great and small) as you are to be my proxy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some readers will think this paragraph very trifling; yet many, I hope, will take it, as I give it, for a pleasing example of the amiableness of his domestic character.</NOTE></P>
<P>In spite of the rain, which I think continued, with very short intervals, till the beginning of this month, and quite effaced the summer from the year, I made a shift to pass May and June not disagreeably in Kent. I was surprized at the beauty of the road to Canterbury, which (I know not why) had not struck me before. The whole country is a rich and well-cultivated garden; orchards, cherry-grounds, hop-gardens, intermixed with corn and frequent villages; gentle risings covered with wood, and every where the Thames and Medway breaking in upon the landscape with all their navigation. It was indeed owing to the bad weather that the whole scene was dressed in that tender emerald green, which one usually sees only for a fortnight in the opening of the spring; and this continued till I
<PB N="323" REF="326"/>
left the country. My residence was eight miles east of Canter∣bury, in a little quiet valley on the skirts of Barham-Down.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Denton, where his friend the Rev. William Robinson, brother to Matthew Robinson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late member for Canterbury, then resided.</NOTE> In these parts the whole soil is chalk, and whenever it holds up, in half an hour it is dry enough to walk out. I took the opportunity of three or four days fine weather to go into the Isle of Thanet; saw Margate, (which is Bartholomew fair by the sea side) Ramsgate, and other places there; and so came by Sandwich, Deal, Dover, Folkstone, and Hithe, back again. The coast is not like Hartlepool; there are no rocks, but only chalky cliffs of no great height till you come to Dover; there indeed they are noble and picturesque, and the opposite coasts of France begin to bound your view, which was left before to range unlimited by any thing but the horizon; yet it is by no means a <HI>shipless</HI> sea, but every where peopled with white sails, and vessels of all sizes in motion: and take notice, (except in the Isle, which is all corn-fields, and has very little inclosure) there are in all places hedge-rows, and tall trees even within a few yards of the beach. Particularly, Hithe stands on an emi∣nence covered with wood. I shall confess we had fires at night (ay, and at day too) several times in June; but do not go and take advantage in the north at this, for it was the most unto∣ward year that ever I remember.</P>
<P>Have you read the New Bath Guide? It is the only thing in fashion, and is a new and original kind of humour.

<P>I Received from Mr. Williamson that very obliging mark you were pleased to give me of your remembrance: Had I not entertained some flight hopes of revisiting Scotland this summer, and consequently of seeing you at Aberdeen, I had sooner ac∣knowledged, by letter, the favour you have done me. Those hopes are now at an end; but I do not therefore despair of see∣ing again a country that has given me so much pleasure; nor of telling you, in person, how much I esteem you and (as you choose to call them) your amusements: the specimen of them, which you were so good to send me, I think excellent; the sentiments are such as a melancholy imagination naturally sug∣gests in solitude and silence, and that (though light and business may suspend or banish them at times) return with but so much the greater force upon a feeling heart: the diction is elegant and unconstrained; not loaded with epithets and figures, nor flagging into prose; the versification is easy and harmonious. My only objection is * * * * *<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A paragraph is here omited, as it contained merely a few particular criticisms; a liberty of the same kind I have before taken in some of the preceding letters. The Poem in question contained many touching reflections on morality: it is to be hoped Dr. Beattie will one day give it to the public.</NOTE></P>
<P>You see, Sir, I take the liberty you indulged me in, when I first saw you; and therefore I make no excuses for it, but de∣sire you would take your revenge on me in kind.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="329"/>
I have read over (but too hastily) Mr. Ferguson's book. There are uncommon strains of eloquence in it; and I was sur∣prized to find not one single idiom of his country (I think) in the whole work. He has not the fault you mention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To explain this, I must take the liberty to transcribe a paragraph from Mr. Beattie's letter dated March 30, to which the above is an answer: <Q REND="inline">"A Profes∣sor at Edinburgh has published an Essay on the History of Civil Society, but I have not seen it. It is a fault common to almost all our Scotch authors, that they are too metaphysical: I wish they would learn to speak more to the heart, and less to the understanding; but alas! this is a talent which heaven only can bestow: Whereas the philosophic spirit (as we call it) is merely artificial and level to the capacity of every man, who has much patience, a little learning, and no taste."</Q> He has since dilated on this just sentiment in his admirable Essay on the Immutability of Truth.</NOTE>: his ap∣plication to the heart is frequent, and often successful. His love of Montesquieu and Tacitus has led him into a manner of writing too short-winded and sententious; which those great men, had they lived in better times and under a better govern∣ment, would have avoided.</P>
<P>I know no pretence that I have to the honour Lord Gray is pleased to do me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Gray had said that our Author was related to his family.</NOTE>: but if his Lordship chuses to own me, it certainly is not my business to deny it. I say not this merely on account of his quality, but because he is a very worthy and accomplished person. I am truly sorry for the great loss he has had since I left Scotland. If you should chance to see him, I will beg you to present my respectful humble service to his Lordship.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="330"/>
I gave Mr. Williamson all the information I was able in the short time he staid with me. He seemed to answer well the character you gave me of him: but what I chiefly envied in him, was his ability of walking all the way from Aberdeen to Cambridge, and back again; which if I possessed, you would soon see your obliged, &amp;c.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the pleasure of receiving your last letter, which did not reach me till I had left the North, and was come to London, I have been confined to my room with a fit of the gout: now I am recovered and in quiet at Cambridge, I take up my pen to thank you for your very friendly offers, which have so much the air of frankness and real good-meaning, that were my body as tractable and easy of conveyance as my mind, you would see me to-morrow in the chamber you have so hospitably laid out for me at Aberdeen. But, alas! I am a summer-bird, and can only sit drooping till the sun returns: even then too my wings may chance to be clipped, and little in plight for so distant an excursion.</P>
<P>The proposal you make me, about printing at Glasgow what little I have ever written, does me honour. I leave my re∣putation in that part of the kingdom to your care; and only desire you would not let your partiality to me and mine mis∣lead

you. If you persist in your design, Mr. Foulis certainly ought to be acquainted with what I am now going to tell you. When I was in London the last spring, Dodsley, the bookseller, asked my leave to reprint, in a smaller form, all I ever pub∣lished; to which I consented: and added, that I would send him a few explanatory notes; and if he would omit entirely the <HI>Long Story,</HI> (which was never meant for the public, and only suffered to appear in that pompous edition because of Mr. Bentley's designs, which were not intelligible without it) I promised to send him something else to print instead of it, lest the bulk of so small a volume should be reduced to nothing at all. Now it is very certain that I had rather see them print∣ed at Glasgow (especially as you will condescend to revise the press) than at London; but I know not how to retract my pro∣mise to Dodsley. By the way, you perhaps may imagine that I have some kind of interest in this publication; but the truth is, I have none whatever. The expence is his, and so is the profit, if there be any. I therefore told him the other day, in general terms, that I heard there would be an edition put out in Scotland by a friend of mine, whom I could not refuse; and that, if so, I would send thither a copy of the same notes and additions that I had promised to send to him. This did not seem at all to cool his courage; Mr. Foulis must therefore judge for himself, whether he thinks it worth while to print what is going to be printed also at London. If he does, I will send him (in a packet to you) the same things I shall send to Dods∣ley. They are imitations of two pieces of old Norwegian poe∣try, in which there was a wild spirit that struck me: but for my paraphrases I cannot say much; you will judge. The rest are nothing but a few parallel passages, and small notes just to
<PB N="329" REF="332"/>
explain what people said at the time was wrapped in total darkness. You will please to tell me, as soon as you can con∣veniently, what Mr. Foulis says on this head; that (if he drops the design) I may save myself and you the trouble of this packet. I ask your pardon for talking so long about it; a little more, and my letter would be as big as all my works.</P>
<P>I have read, with much pleasure, an Ode of yours (in which you have done me the honour to adopt a measure that I have used) on Lord Hay's birth-day. Though I do not love pane∣gyric, I cannot but applaud this, for there is nothing mean in it. The diction is easy and noble, the texture of the thoughts lyric, and the versification harmonious. The few expressions I object to are * * * *<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Another paragraph of particular criticism is here omitted.</NOTE>.

<P>I Am almost sorry to have raised any degree of impatience in you, because I can by no means satisfy it. The sole reason I have to publish these few additions now, is to make up (in both) for the omission of that <HI>Long Story;</HI> and as to the notes, I do it out of spite, because the public did not understand the

The parallel passages I insert out of justice to those writers from whom I happened to take the hint of any line, as far as I can recollect.</P>
<P>I rejoice to be in the hands of Mr. Foulis, who has the laud∣able ambition of surpassing his predecessors, the <HI>Etiennes</HI> and the <HI>Elzevirs,</HI> as well in literature, as in the proper art of his profession: He surprises me in mentioning a Lady, after whom I have been enquiring these fourteen years in vain. When the two Odes were first published, I sent them to her; but as I was forced to direct them very much at random, pro∣bably they never came to her hands. When the present edi∣tion comes out, I beg of Mr. Foulis to offer her a copy, in my name, with my respects and grateful remembrances; he will send another to you, Sir, and a third to Lord Gray, if he will do me the honour of accepting it. These are all the presents I pretend to make (for I would have it considered only as a new edition of an old book); after this if he pleases to send me one or two, I shall think myself obliged to him. I cannot advise him to print a great number; especially as Dodsley has it in his power to print as many as he pleases, though I desire him not to do so.</P>

<P>IT is some time since I received from Mr. Foulis two copies of my poems, one by the hands of Mr. T. Pitt, the other by Mr. Merrill, a bookseller of this town: it is indeed a most beautiful edition, and must certainly do credit both to him and to me: but I fear it will be of no other advantage to him, as Dodsley has contrived to glut the town already with two edi∣tions beforehand, one of 1500, and the other of 750, both indeed far inferior to that of Glasgow, but sold at half the price. I must repeat my thanks, Sir, for the trouble you have been pleased to give yourself on my account; and thro' you I must desire leave to convey my acknowledgments to Mr. Foulis, for the pains and expence he has been at in this publication.</P>

<P>THE Reader will have gathered, from the preceding series of letters, that the greatest part of Mr. Gray's life was spent in that kind of learned leisure, which has only self-improvement and self-gratification for its object: He will probably be surprized that, with so very strait an in∣come, he should never have read with a view of making his researches lucrative to himself, or useful to the public. The truth was, Mr. Gray had ever expunged the word <HI>lucrative</HI> from his own vocabulary. He may be said to have been one of those very few personages in the annals of literature, especially in the poetical class, who are devoid of self-interest, and at the same time attentive to economy; and also, among mankind in gene∣ral, one of those very few economists who possess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain of avarice. Were it my purpose in this place to expatiate on his moral excellencies, I should here add, that when his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in private charity as would have done credit to an ampler purse: But it is rather my less-pleasing pro∣vince at present to acknowledge one of his foibles; and that was a certain degree of pride, which led him, of all other things, to despise the idea of being thought an author professed. I have been told indeed, that early in life he had an intention of pub∣lishing an edition of Strabo; and I find amongst his papers a
<PB N="336" REF="339"/>
great number of geographical disquisitions, particularly with respect to that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India; concerning the antient and modern names and divisions of which extensive countries, his notes are very copious. The indefati∣gable pains which he also took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical, as well as explanatory observations, which he has left upon almost every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate that Philosopher than Mr. Gray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncommon labour, was the <Q REND="inline">'Anthologia.'</Q> Amongst the books, which his friendship bequeathed to me, is Henry Stevens's edition of that collection of Greek Epigrams, interleaved; in which he has transcribed several additional ones that he selected in his extensive reading, has inserted a great number of critical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious Index, in which every Epigram is arranged under the name of its respective author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It should seem that Mr. Gray's pains were, on this occasion, very ill em∣ployed; for the late Lord Chesterfield, writing to his son, says, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you are got out of the worst company in the world, the Greek Epigrams. Martial has wit, and is worth looking into sometimes; but I recommend the Greek Epi∣grams to your supreme contempt."</Q> See Lord Chesterfield's Letters, Lett. 73. However, if what Mr. Gray says be true, p. 233, supra, that <Q REND="inline">"a dead Lord ranks only with Commoners,"</Q> there may come a time when Lord Chesterfield's dictum, in matters of taste, may not be held more infallible than that of his own and other dead Lords, in points of religion and morality: Nay, when his own plan of gentle manly education may be thought less capable of furnishing his country with useful members of society, than the plain old-fashioned one which he wrote to explode. If this day does not quickly come, one may, with∣out pretending to a gift of prophecy, pronounce that England will neither be, nor deserve to be, any thing better than a Province of France.</NOTE>. This manuscript, though written in that exact manner, as if intended for the press, I do not know that
<PB N="337" REF="340"/>
it was ever Mr. Gray's design to make public. The only work, which he meditated upon with this direct view from the beginning, was a History of English Poetry. He has men∣tioned this himself in an advertisement prefixed to those three fine imitations of Norse and Welch Poetry, which he gave the world in the last edition of his Poems. But the slight manner, in which he there speaks of that design, may admit here of some additional explanation. Several years ago I was indebted to the friendship of the present learned Bishop of Gloucester for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A transcript of this paper is to be found printed in the Life of Mr. Pope, written by Mr. Ruffhead.</NOTE>a curious manuscript paper of Mr. Pope's, which contains the first sketch of a plan for a work of this kind, and which I have still in my possession. Mr. Gray was greatly struck with the method which Mr. Pope had traced out in this little sketch; and on my proposal of engaging with him in compiling such a history, he examined the plan more accurately, enlarged it con∣siderably, and formed an idea for an introduction to it. In this was to be ascertained the origin of Rhyme; and specimens gi∣ven, not only of the Provençal Poetry, (to which alone Mr. Pope seemed to have adverted) but of the Scaldic, British, and Saxon; as, from all these different sources united, English Poetry had its original: though it could hardly be called by that name till the time of Chaucer, with whose school (i. e. the Poets who wrote in his manner) the history itself was intended to com∣mence. The materials which I collected for this purpose are too inconsiderable to be mentioned: but Mr. Gray, besides ver∣sifying those Odes that he published, made many elaborate dis∣quisitions into the origin of Rhyme, and that variety of Metre, to be found in the writings of our antient Poets. He also

transcribed many parts of the voluminous Lidgate, from Manu∣scripts which he found in the University Library and those of private Colleges; remarking, as he went along, the several beau∣ties and defects of this immediate scholar of Chaucer. He how∣ever soon found that a work of this kind, pursued on so very extensive a plan, would become almost endless: and hearing at the same time that Mr. Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity∣College, Oxford, (of whose abilities, from his observations on Spenser, we had each of us conceived the highest opinion) was engaged in a work of the same kind, we by mutual consent relinquished our undertaking; and soon after, on that Gentle∣man's desiring a sight of the plan, Mr. Gray readily sent him a copy of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman has just now politely acknowledged the favour in his pre∣face to his first volume on this subject. A work which, as he proceeds in it thro' more enlightened periods, will undoubtedly give the world as high an idea of his critical taste, as the present specimen does of his indefatigable researches into antiquity.</NOTE></P>
<P>At a time when I am enumerating the more considerable of Mr. Gray's antiquarian pursuits, I must not omit to mention his great knowledge of Gothic Architecture. He had seen, and accurately studied in his youth, while abroad, the Roman proportions on the spot, both in antient ruins and in the works of Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to consider those stupendous structures of more modern date, that adorn our own country; which, if they have not the same grace, have undoubtedly equal dignity. He endeavoured to trace this mode of building, from the time it commenced, through its various changes, till it arrived at its perfection in the reign of Henry the Eighth, and ended in that of Elizabeth. For this purpose he
<PB N="339" REF="342"/>
did not so much depend upon written accounts, as that internal evidence which the buildings themselves give of their respective antiquity; since they constantly furnish to the well-informed eye, arms, ornaments, and other undubitable marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he ap∣plied himself to the study of Heraldry as a preparatory science, and has left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove him a complete master of it. By these means he arrived at so very extraordinary a pitch of sagacity, as to be enabled to pronounce, at first sight, on the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected. He invented also several terms of art, the better to explain his meaning on this subject. I frequently pressed him to digest these in a regular order; and offered, under his direction, to adapt a set of drawings to them, which might describe every ornament peculiarly in use in every different aera. But though he did not disapprove this hint, he neglected it; and has left no papers that would lead to its prosecution. I therefore mention it in this place, only to induce certain of his friends, to whom I know he communicated more of his thoughts upon this sub∣ject than to me, to pursue the design, if they think it would be attended with utility to the public.</P>
<P>There is an Eloge on M. l'Abbé Le Beuf, published in the <Q REND="inline">"Histoiredel'Acad. des Inscriptions &amp; Belles Lettres, vol. 29th,"</Q> by which it appears that Gentleman had precisely the same idea with Mr. Gray on this subject; and, by pursuing it, had arri∣ved at the same degree of skill. <Q REND="inline">"Les Voyages &amp; les Lectures de M. l'Abbé Le Beuf l'avoient tellement familiarisé avec les monumens, qu'il apercevoit les differences les plus deli∣cates
<PB N="340" REF="343"/>
de l'ancienne Architecture: Il demêloit du premier coup-d'oeil, les caracteres de chaque siecle; à l'inspection d'un bâtiment il pouvoit dire, quelquefois à vingt années prés, dans qu'el temps il avoit été construit: les ceintres, les chapiteaux, les moulures portoient à ces yeux la date de leur bâtisse: beaucoup des grands edifices ont été l'ouvrage de plusieurs siecles; plus encore ont été repáres en des siecles differens; il décomposoit un meme bâtiment avec une facilite singulière, il fixoit l'age des diverses parties, &amp; ses decisions etoient tou∣jours fondées sur les preuves indubitables; on en trouve une foule d'exemples dans son Histoire du Diocese de Paris."</Q> His Panegyrist also informs us, that he was solicited by his friend, M. Joly de Fleury, to reduce into a body of science the discoveries which he had made, that his ill health prevented him; but that the work is now in the hands of a person very capable of perfecting his idea. Yet I question whether a work of this kind, from a French writer, will be of any great im∣portance, since I am informed by a very competent judge, that the resemblance between Gothic Architecture in England and in France is surprisingly slight, except in the cathedral at Amiens, and a few other churches, supposed to be built by the English while in possession of French provinces. The public has much more to hope from Mr. T. Warton's late promise to it, as he, of all other living writers, is best qualified to give complete satisfaction to the curious on this subject: in the meanwhile, it may not be amiss to inform the reader, that Mr. Bentham's Remarks on Saxon Churches, which make a part of an elaborate Introduction to his History of Ely Cathedral, lately published, will convey to him many sentiments of Mr. Gray; as, amongst other Antiquaries, he contributed his assistance to that Gentle∣man;
<PB N="341" REF="344"/>
who, in his preface, has accordingly mentioned the obli∣gation.</P>
<P>But the favourite study of Mr. Gray, for the last ten years of his life, was Natural History, which he then rather resumed than began; as, by the instructions of his uncle Antrobus, he was a considerable botanist at fifteen. He followed it closely, and often said that he thought it a singular felicity to have en∣gaged in it; as, besides the constant amusement it gave him in his chamber, it led him more frequently out into the fields; and, by making his life less sedentary, improved the general course of his health and spirits.</P>
<P>Habituated, as he had long been, to apply only to first-rate Authors, as to the fountain-head of that knowledge, which he was at the time solicitous to acquire, it is obvious that, when he resolved to make himself master of Natural History, he would immediately become the disciple of the great Lin∣naeus. His first business was to understand accurately his <Q REND="inline">"termini artis,"</Q> which he called justly the learning a new ori∣ginal language. He then went regularly through the vegetable, animal, and fossile kingdoms. The marginal notes which he has left, not only on Linnaeus, but the many other authors which he read on these subjects, are very numerous: but the most considerable are on Hudson's Flora Anglica, and the tenth edition of the Systema Naturae; which latter he interleaved, and filled almost entirely. While employed on Zoology, he also read Aristotle's treatise on that subject with great care, and explained many difficult passages of that obscure Antient, from the lights he had acquired from modern Naturalists.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="345"/>
Having now given a general account of that variety of lite∣rary pursuits, which, in their turns, principally engaged his attention, and which were either not mentioned, or only glanced at in the preceding letters, let me be permitted to say a word or two of his amusements. The chief, and almost the only one of these, (if we except the frequent experiments he made on Flow∣ers, in order to mark the mode and progress of their vegetation) was Music. His taste in this art was equal to his skill in any more important science. It was founded on the best models, those great masters in Italy, who flourished about the same time with his favourite Pergolesi. Of His and of Leo's, Bononcini's, Vinci's, and Hasse's works, he made a valuable collection while abroad, chiefly of such of their vocal compositions as he had himself heard and admired; observing in his choice of these, the same judicious rule which he followed in making his collection of Prints; which was not so much to get together complete sets of the works of any master, as to select those (the best in their kind) which would recall to his memory the capital Pictures, Statues, and Buildings which he had seen and studied. By this means, as he acquired in Painting great facility and accuracy in the knowledge of hands, so in Music he gained supreme skill in the more refined powers of expression; especially when we con∣sider that art as an adjunct to poetry: for vocal music, and that only, (excepting perhaps the lessons of the younger Scarlatti) was what he chiefly regarded. His instrument was the Harpsi∣cord; on which, though he had little execution, yet, when he sung to it, he so modulated the small powers of his voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was much admired for his singing in his youth; yet he was so shy in exercising this talent, that Mr. Walpole tells me he never could but once prevail on him to give a proof of it; and then it was with so much pain to himself, that it gave him no manner of pleasure.</NOTE>, as
<PB N="343" REF="346"/>
to be able to convey to the intelligent hearer no common de∣gree of satisfaction. This, however, he could seldom be pre∣vailed upon to do, even by his most intimate acquaintance.</P>
<P>To conclude this slight sketch of his literary Character, I believe I may with great truth assert, that excepting pure Ma∣thematics, and the studies dependent on that science, there was hardly any part of human Learning, in which he had not acquired a competent skill: in most of them a confummate mastery.</P>
<P>I proceed now, as I did in the former sections, to select, for the reader's perusal, the last series of his Letters. They are few in number; yet contain all the incidents that occurred in that very short space of time, during which Providence was pleased further to continue him a blessing to his friends, and an ornament to his country.</P>
<LETTER N="1">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. NICHOLLS.</HEAD>
<P>I Was absent from College, and did not receive your melan∣choly letter till my return hither yesterday; so you must not attribute this delay to me but to accident: to sympathize with you in such a loss<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of his uncle Governor Floyer.</NOTE> is an easy task for me, but to comfort you not so easy; can I wish to see you unaffected with the sad scene now before your eyes, or with the loss of a person that,
<PB N="344" REF="347"/>
through a great part of your life, has proved himself so kind a friend to you? He who best knows our nature (for he made us what we are) by such afflictions recalls us from our wander∣ing thoughts and idle merriment; from the insolence of youth and prosperity, to serious reflection, to our duty, and to him∣self; nor need we hasten to get rid of these impressions; time (by appointment of the same Power) will cure the smart, and in some hearts soon blot out all the traces of sorrow: but such as preserve them longest (for it is partly left in our own power) do perhaps best acquiesce in the will of the chastiser.</P>
<P>For the consequences of this sudden loss, I see them well, and I think, in a like situation, could fortify my mind, so as to support them with chearfulness and good hopes, though not naturally inclined to see things in their best aspect. When you have time to turn yourself round, you must think seriously of your profession; you know I would have wished to see you wear the livery of it long ago: But I will not dwell on this subject at present. To be obliged to those we love and esteem is a pleasure; but to serve and oblige them is a still greater; and this, with independance, (no vulgar blessing) are what a pro∣fession at your age may reasonably promise; without it they are hardly attainable. Remember I speak from experience.</P>
<P>In the mean time while your present situation lasts, which I hope will not be long, continue your kindness and confidence in me, by trusting me with the whole of it; and surely you hazard nothing by so doing: That situation does not appear so new to me as it does to you. You well know the tenour of my conversation (urged at times perhaps a little farther than
<PB N="345" REF="348"/>
you liked) has been intended to prepare you for this event, and to familiarize your mind with this spectre, which you call by its worst name: but remember that <Q REND="inline">"Honesta res est laeta paupertas."</Q> I see it with respect, and so will every one, whose poverty is not seated in their mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An excellent thought finely expressed.</NOTE>. There is but one real evil in it (take my word who know it well) and that is, that you have less the power of assisting others, who have not the same resources to support them. You have youth: you have many kind well-intentioned people belonging to you; many acquaint∣ance of your own, or families that will wish to serve you. Consider how many have had the same, or greater cause for dejection, with none of these resources before their eyes. Adieu. I sincerely wish your happiness.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P.S. I have just heard that a friend of mine is struck with a paralytick disorder, in which state it is likely he may live incapable of assisting himself, in the hands of servants or rela∣tions that only gape after his spoils, perhaps for years to come: think how many things may befal a man far worse than poverty or death.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Letter was written a year or two before the time when this series of letters should commence; but as it was not communicated to me before the last section was printed off, and has a connection with that which follows it, I chose to begin this section with it; the date not appearing to be very material, and the pathetic and friendly turn of it strongly pleading for its insertion.</NOTE></P>

<P>AND so you have a garden of your own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Nicholls, by having pursued the advice of his correspondent, we find was now possessed of that competency which he wished him. Happy, not only in having so sage an adviser, but in his own good sense which prompted him to follow such advice. The gaiety, whim, and humour of this letter contrast prettily with the gravity and serious reflection of the former.</NOTE>, and you plant and transplant, and are dirty and amused! Are not you ashamed of yourself? Why, I have no such thing, you monster, nor ever shall be either dirty or amused as long as I live. My gardens are in the windows like those of a lodger up three pair of stairs in Petticoat-Lane, or Camomile-Street, and they go to bed regularly under the same roof that I do. Dear, how charming it must be to walk out in one's own <HI>garding,</HI> and sit on a bench in the open air, with a fountain and leaden statue, and a rolling stone, and an arbour: have a care of sore throats though, and the <HI>agoe.</HI></P>
<P>However, be it known to you, though I have no garden, I have sold my estate and got a thousand guineas<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Consisting of houses on the west side of Hand-Alley, London: Mrs. Olliffe was the Aunt here mentioned, who had a share in this estate, and for whom he procured this annuity. She died in 1771, a few months before her Nephew.</NOTE>, and four∣score pounds a year for my old Aunt, and a twenty pound prize

in the lottery, and Lord knows what arrears in the treasury, and am a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses, and one that hath two gowns, and every thing hand∣some about him, and in a few days shall have new window curtains: Are you avized of that? Ay, and a new mattrass to lie upon.</P>
<P>My Ode has been rehearsed again and again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ode for Music on the Duke of Grafton's Installation. See Poems, p. 37. His reason for writing it is given in the next letter.</NOTE>,
and the scholars have got scraps by heart: I expect to see it torn piece-meal in the North-Briton before it is born. If you will come you shall see it, and sing in it amidst a chorus from Salisbury and Glou∣cester music meeting, great names there, and all well versed in Judas Maccabaeus. I wish it were once over; for then I im∣mediately go for a few days to London, and so with Mr. Brown to Aston, though I fear it will rain the whole summer, and Skiddaw will be invisible and inaccessible to mortals.</P>
<P>I have got De la Landes' Voyage through Italy, in eight volumes; he is a member of the academy of sciences, and pretty good to read. I have read too an octavo volume of Shenstone's Letters: Poor man! he was always wishing for mo∣ney, for fame, and other distinctions; and his whole philosophy consisted in living against his will in retirement, and in a place which his taste had adorned; but which he only enjoyed when people of note came to see and commend it: his correspondence is about nothing else but this place and his own writings, with two or three neighbouring Clergymen who wrote verses too.</P>

<P>THE late ceremony of the Duke of Grafton's installation has hindered me from acknowledging sooner the satis∣faction your friendly compliment gave me: I thought myself bound in gratitude to his Grace, unasked, to take upon me the task of writing those verses which are usually set to music on
<PB N="349" REF="352"/>
this occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a short note which he wrote to Mr. Stonhewer, June 12, when, at his request, he sent him the Ode in manuscript for his Grace's perusal, he expresses this motive more fully. <Q REND="inline">"I did not intend the Duke should have heard me till he could not help it. You are desired to make the best excuses you can to his Grace for the liberty I have taken of praising him to his face; but as some∣body was necessarily to do this, I did not see why Gratitude should sit silent and leave it to Expectation to sing, who certainly would have sung, and that <HI>à gorge deployée</HI> upon such an occasion."</Q></NOTE>. I do not think them worth sending you, because they are by nature doomed to live but a single day; or, if their existence is prolonged beyond that date, it is only by means of news-paper parodies, and witless criticisms. This sort of abuse I had reason to expect, but did not think it worth while to avoid.</P>
<P>Mr. Foulis is magnificent in his gratitude<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the Glasgow Edition of Mr. Gray's Poems was sold off (which it was in a short time) Mr. Foulis finding himself a considerable gainer, mentioned to Mr. Beattie, that he wished to make Mr. Gray a present either of his Homer in 4 vols. folio, or the Greek Historians, printed likewise at his press, in 29 vols. duodecimo.</NOTE>: I cannot figure to myself how it can be worth his while to offer me such a present. You can judge better of it than I; and if he does not hurt himself by it, I would accept his Homer with many thanks. I have not got or even seen it.</P>
<P>I could wish to subscribe to his new edition of Milton, and desire to be set down for two copies of the large paper; but you must inform me where and when I may pay the money.</P>

I have nothing to requite it with but plain and friendly truth, and that you shall have, joined to a zeal for your fame, and a plea∣sure in your success.</P>
<P>I am now setting forward on a journey towards the North of England; but it will not reach so far as I could wish. I must return hither before Michaelmas, and shall barely have time to visit a few places, and a few friends.</P>

<P>I Hope you got safe and well home after that troublesome night<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wharton, who had intended to accompany Mr. Gray to Keswick, was seized at Brough with a violent fit of his asthma, which obliged him to return home. This was the reason that Mr. Gray undertook to write the following journal of his tour for his friend's amusement. He sent it under different covers. I give it here in continuation. It may not be amiss, however, to hint to the reader, that if he expects to find elaborate and nicely-turned periods in this nar∣ration, he will be greatly disappointed. When Mr. Gray described places, he aimed only to be exact, clear, and intelligible; to convey peculiar, not gene∣ral ideas, and to paint by the eye, not the fancy. There have been many ac∣counts of the Westmoreland and Cumberland lakes, both before and since this was written, and all of them better calculated to please readers, who are fond of what they call <HI>fine writing:</HI> Yet those who can content themselves with an ele∣gant simplicity of narrative, will, I flatter myself, find this to their taste; they will perceive it was written with a view, rather to inform than surprize; and, if they make it their companion when they take the same tour, it will inhance their opinion of its intrinsic excellence; in this way I tried it myself before I resolved to print it.</NOTE>. I long to hear you say so. For me I have con∣tinued well, been so favoured by the weather, that my walks have never once been hindered till yesterday (that is a fortnight
<PB N="351" REF="354"/>
and three or four days, and a journey of more than 300 miles.) I am now at Aston for two days. To-morrow I go to Cam∣bridge. Mason is not here, but Mr. Alderson receives me. According to my promise I send you the first sheet of my journal, to be continued without end.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 30. A mile and a half from Brough, where we parted, on a hill lay a great army <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a great fair for cattle kept on the hill near Brough on this day and the preceding.</NOTE> encamped: To the left opened a fine valley with green meadows and hedge-rows, a gentleman's house peeping forth from a grove of old trees. On a nearer approach appeared myriads of cattle and horses in the road it∣self, and in all the fields round me, a brisk stream hurrying cross the way, thousands of clean healthy people in their best party-coloured apparel: Farmers and their families, Esquires and their daughters hastening up from the dales and down the fells from every quarter, glittering in the sun, and pressing forward to join the throng. While the dark hills, on whose tops the mists were yet hanging, served as a contrast to this gay and moving scene, which continued for near two miles
<PB N="352" REF="355"/>
more along the road, and the croud (coming towards it) reach∣ed on as far as Appleby. On the ascent of the hill above Appleby the thick hanging wood, and the long reaches of the Eden, clear, rapid, and full as ever, winding below, with views of the castle and town, gave much employment to the mirror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray carried usually with him on these tours a Plano-convex Mirror of about four inches diameter on a black foil, and bound up like a pocket-book. A glass of this sort is perhaps the best and most convenient substitute for a Camera Obscura, of any thing that has hitherto been invented, and may be had of any optician.</NOTE>; but now the sun was wanting, and the sky overcast. Oats and barley cut every where, but not carried in. Passed Kirbythore, Sir William Dalston's house at Acorn-Bank, Whinfield Park, Harthorn Oaks, Countess-Pillar, Brougham-Castle, Mr. Brown's large new house; crossed the Eden and the Eimot (pronounce Eeman) with its green vale, and dined at three o'clock with Mrs. Buchanan at Penrith, on trout and partridge. In the afternoon walked up Beacon-hill, a mile to the top, and could see Ulswater through an opening in the bosom of that cluster of broken mountains, which the Doctor well remembers, Whin∣field and Lowther Parks, &amp;c. and the craggy tops of an hun∣dred nameless hills: These lie to west and south. To the north, a great extent of black and dreary plains. To the east, Cross-fell, just visible through mists and vapours hovering round it.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 1. A grey autumnal day, the air perfectly calm and mild, went to see Ulswater, five miles distant; soon left the Keswick-road, and turned to the left through shady lanes along the vale of Eeman, which runs rapidly on near the way, rip∣ling
<PB N="353" REF="356"/>
over the stones; to the right is Delmaine, a large fabrick of pale red stone, with nine windows in front and seven on the side, built by Mr. Hassle, behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods, and a long rocky eminence rising over them: a clear and brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the Eeman, whose course is in sight and at a small distance. Farther on appears Hatton St. John, a castle-like old mansion of Mr. Huddleston. Approached Dunmallert, a fine-pointed hill covered with wood, planted by old Mr. Hassle before-mentioned, who lives always at home, and delights in planting. Walked over a spungy mea∣dow or two, and began to mount the hill through a broad straight green alley among the trees, and with some toil gained the summit. From hence saw the lake opening directly at my feet, majestic in its calmness, clear and smooth as a blue mir∣ror, with winding shores and low points of land covered with green inclosures, white farm-houses looking out among the trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almost every where bordered with cultivated lands, gently sloping upwards from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, till they reach the feet of the mountains, which rise very rude and awful with their broken tops on either hand. Directly in front, at better than three miles distance, Place-Fell, one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the lake, and forces it to alter its course, forming first a large bay to the left, and then bending to the right. I descended Dunmallert again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, and came to Barton-bridge over the Eeman; then walking through a path in the wood round the bottom of the hill, came forth where the Eeman issues out of the lake, and continued my way along its western shore close to the water, and generally on a
<PB N="354" REF="357"/>
level with it. Saw a cormorant flying over it and fishing. The figure of the lake nothing resembles that laid down in our maps: It is nine miles long; and at widest under a mile in breadth. After extending itself three miles and a half in a line to south∣west, it turns at the foot of Place-Fell almost due west, and is here not twice the breadth of the Thames at London. It is soon again interrupted by the root of Helvellyn, a lofty and very rugged mountain, and spreading again turns off to south∣east, and is lost among the deep recesses of the hills. To this second turning I pursued my way about four miles along its bor∣ders beyond a village scattered among trees, and called Water∣Mallock, in a pleasant grave day, perfectly calm and warm, but without a gleam of sunshine; then the sky seeming to thick∣en, and the valley to grow more desolate, and evening drawing on, I returned by the way I came to Penrith.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 2. I set out at ten for Keswick, by the road we went in 1767; saw Greystock town and castle to the right, which lie about three miles from Ulswater over the fells; passed through Penradoch and Threlcot at the foot of Saddleback, whose sur∣rowed sides were gilt by the noon-day sun, whilst its brow appeared of a sad purple from the shadow of the clouds as they sailed slowly by it. The broad and green valley of Gardies and Lowside, with a swift stream glittering among the cottages and meadows lay to the left, and the much finer but narrower valley of St. John's opening into it: Hill-top, the large though low mansion of the Gaskarths, now a farm-house, seated on an emi∣nence among woods, under a steep fell, was what appeared the most conspicuous, and beside it a great rock, like some ancient tower nodding to its fall. Passed by the side of Skiddaw and
<PB N="355" REF="358"/>
its cub called Latter-rig; and saw from an eminence, at two miles distance, the vale of Elysium in all its verdure; the sun then playing on the bosom of the lake, and lighting up all the mountains with its lustre. Dined by two o'Clock at the Queen's Head, and then straggled out alone to the Parsonage, where I saw the sun set in all its glory.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 3. A heavenly day; rose at seven and walked out under the conduct of my landlord to Borrowdale; the grass was co∣vered with a hoar-frost, which soon melted and exhaled in a thin bluish smoke; crossed the meadows, obliquely catching a diversity of views among the hills over the lake and islands, and changing prospect at every ten paces. Left Cockshut (which we formerly mounted) and Castle-hill, a loftier and more rugged hill behind me, and drew near the foot of Walla∣crag, whose bare and rocky brow cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet (as I guess, though the people called it much more) awfully overlooks the way. Our path here tends to the left, and the ground gently rising and covered with a glade of scattering trees and bushes on the very margin of the water, opens both ways the most delicious view that my eyes ever be∣held; opposite are the thick woods of Lord Egremont and Newland-valley, with green and smiling fields embosomed in the dark cliffs; to the left the jaws of Borrowdale, with that turbulent chaos of mountain behind mountain, rolled in con∣fusion; beneath you and stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the lake reflecting rocks, woods, fields, and in∣verted tops of hills, just ruffled by the breeze, enough to shew it is alive, with the white buildings of Keswick, Crosthwaite church, and Skiddaw for a back ground at a distance. Behind
<PB N="356" REF="359"/>
you the magnificent heights of Walla-crag: here the glass play∣ed its part divinely, the place is called Carf-close-reeds; and I chose to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, and easily find the particular station that I mean. This scene continues to Barrow-gate; and a little farther, passing a brook called Barrow-beck, we entered Bor∣rowdale: the crags named Lawdoor-banks begin now to im∣pend terribly over your way, and more terribly when you hear that three years since an immense mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow, and barred all access to the dale (for this is the only road) till they could work their way through it. Luckily no one was passing at the time of this fall; but down the side of the mountain, and far into the lake, lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes and in all di∣rections: something farther we turned aside into a coppice, ascending a little in front of Lawdoor water-fall; the height appeared to be about 200 feet, the quantity of water not great, though (these three days excepted) it had rained daily in the hills for near two months before: but then the stream was nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, and foaming with fury. On one side a towering crag that spired up to equal, if not overtop the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade and darkness): on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill shagged with wood, and illuminated by the sun, which glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract. The force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground, hurries away to join the lake. We descended again and passed the stream over a rude bridge. Soon after we came under Gowdar-crag, a hill more formidable to the eye, and to the apprehension, than that of Lawdoor; the rocks at top deep-cloven perpendicularly, by
<PB N="357" REF="360"/>
the rains, hanging loose and nodding forwards, seem just start∣ing from their base in shivers. The whole way down, and the road on both sides is strewed with piles of the fragments strange∣ly thrown across each other, and of a dreadful bulk; the place reminds me of those passes in the Alps, where the guides tell you to move on with speed, and say nothing, lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above, and bring down a mass that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their counsel here and hastened on in silence.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda, e passa!</HI></L></Q>
<P>The hills here are cloathed all up their steep sides with Oak, Ash, Birch, Holly, &amp;c. some of it has been cut forty years ago, some within these eight years; yet all is sprung again, green, flourishing, and tall, for its age, in a place where no soil appears but the staring rock, and where a man could scarce stand upright: here we met a civil young farmer overseeing his reapers (for it is now oat-harvest) who conducted us to a neat white house in the village of Grange, which is built on a rising ground in the midst of a valley; round it the mountains form an awful amphitheatre, and through it obliquely runs the Derwent clear as glass, and shewing under its bridge every trout that passes. Beside the village rises a round eminence of rock covered intirely with old trees, and over that more proudly towers Castle-crag, invested also with wood on its sides, and bearing on its naked top some traces of a fort said to be Ro∣man. By the side of this hill, which almost blocks up the way, the valley turns to the left, and contracts its dimensions till there is hardly any road but the rocky bed of the river. The wood of the mountains increases, and their summits grow
<PB N="358" REF="361"/>
loftier to the eye, and of more fantastic forms; among them ap∣pear Eagle's-cliff, Dove's-nest, Whitedale-pike, &amp;c. celebrated names in the annals of Keswick. The dale opens about four miles higher till you come to Sea-whaite (where lies the way mounting the hills to the right that leads to the Wadd-mines); all farther access is here barred to prying mortals, only there is a little path winding over the fells, and for some weeks in the year passable to the dalesmen; but the mountains know well that these innocent people will not reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom, <Q REND="inline">"the reign of Chaos and Old Night:"</Q> only I learned that this dreadful road, dividing again, leads one branch to Ravenglas, and the other to Hawkshead.</P>
<P>For me I went no farther than the farmer's (better than four miles from Keswick) at Grange; his mother and he brought us butter that Siserah would have jumped at, though not in a lordly dish, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, and ale; and we had carried a cold tongue thither with us. Our farmer was himself the man, that last year plundered the eagle's eyrie; all the dale are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridges, grouse, &amp;c. He was let down from the cliff in ropes to the shelf of the rock on which the nest was built, the people above shout∣ing and hollowing to fright the old birds, which flew scream∣ing round, but did not dare to attack him. He brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) and an addle egg. The nest was roundish, and more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together. Seldom a year passes but they take the brood or eggs, and sometimes they shoot one, sometimes the other, parent; but the survivor has always found a mate (pro∣bably
<PB N="359" REF="362"/>
in Ireland) and they breed near the old place. By his description I learn, that this species is the <HI>Erne</HI> the Vulture <HI>Albicilla</HI> of Linnaeus, in his last edition, (but in yours <HI>Falco Al∣bicilla</HI>) so consult him and Pennant about it.</P>
<P>We returned leisurely home the way we came; but saw a new landscape; the features indeed were the same in part, but many new ones were disclosed by the mid-day sun, and the tints were intirely changed; take notice this was the best, or perhaps the only day for going up Skiddaw, but I thought it better em∣ployed; it was perfectly serene, and hot as midsummer.</P>
<P>In the evening I walked alone down to the lake by the side of Crow-park after sunset, and saw the solemn colouring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill∣tops, the deep serene of the waters, and the long shadows of the mountains thrown across them, till they nearly touched the hithermost shore. At a distance were heard the murmurs of many water-falls, not audible in the day-time; I wished for the moon, but she was <HI>dark to me and silent,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 4. I walked to Crow-park, now a rough pasture, once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain on the ground, but nothing has sprung from them. If one single tree had remained, this would have been an unparallel'd spot; and Smith judged right, when he took his print of the lake from hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on the very margin of the water, and commanding it from end to end, looking full into the gorge of Borrowdale. I prefer it even to
<PB N="360" REF="363"/>
Cockshut-hill which lies beside it, and to which I walked in the afternoon; it is covered with young trees both sown and planted, oak, spruce, Scotch-fir, &amp;c. all which thrive wonder∣fully. There is an easy ascent to the top, and the view far pre∣ferable to that on Castle-hill (which you remember) because this is lower and nearer to the lake: for I find all points, that are much elevated, spoil the beauty of the valley, and make its parts, which are not large, look poor and diminutive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Picturesque Point</HI> is always thus low in all prospects: A truth, which though the Landscape Painter knows, he cannot always observe; since the Patron who employs him to take a view of his piace, usually carries him to some elevation for that purpose, in order, I suppose, that he may have more of him for his money. Yet when I say this, I would not be thought to mean that a drawing should be made from the lowest point possible; as for instance, in this very view, from the lake itself, for then a foreground would be wanting. On this account, when I failed on Derwentwater, I did not receive so much pleasure from the superb am∣phitheatre of mountains around me, as when, like Mr. Gray, I traversed its margin; and I therefore think he did not lose much by not taking boat.</NOTE>. While I was here a little shower fell, red clouds came marching up the hills from the east, and part of a bright rainbow seemed to rise along the side of Castle-hill.</P>
<P>From hence I got to the Parsonage a little before sunset, and saw in my glass a picture, that if I could transmit to you, and fix it in all the softness of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. This is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty; the rest are in a sublimer style.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 5. I walked through the meadows and corn-fields to the Derwent, and crossing it went up How-hill; it looks along Bassinthwait-water, and sees at the same time the course of the river, and a part of the upper-lake, with a full view of Skid∣daw:
<PB N="361" REF="364"/>
then I took my way through Portingskall village to the Park, a hill so called, covered entirely with wood; it is all a mass of crumbling slate. Passed round its foot between the trees and the edge of the water, and came to a peninsula that juts out into the lake, and looks along it both ways; in front rises Walla-crag and Castle-hill, the town, the road to Penrith, Skiddaw, and Saddleback. Returning, met a brisk and cold north-eastern blast that ruffled all the surface of the lake, and made it rise in little waves that broke at the foot of the wood. After dinner walked up the Penrith road two miles, or more, and turning into a corn-field to the right, called Castle-rig, saw a Druid-circle of large stones, 108 feet in diameter, the biggest not eight feet high, but most of them still erect; they are fifty in number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this piece of antiquity more fully described, with a plate annexed, by Mr. Pennant in his Second Tour to Scotland in 1772, p. 38.</NOTE>. The valley of St. John's appeared in fight, and the summits of Catchidecam (called by Camden, Casticand) and Helvellyn, said to be as high as Skiddaw, and to rise from a much higher base.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 6. Went in a chaise eight miles along the east-side of Bassingthwaite water to Ousebridge (pronounced Ews-bridge); the road in some part made and very good, the rest slippery and dangerous cart-road, or narrow rugged lanes, but no precipices; it runs directly along the foot of Skiddaw: opposite to Widhope∣brows, cloathed to the top with wood, a very beautiful view opens down to the lake, which is narrower and longer than that of Keswick, less broken into bays, and without islands<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is somewhat extraordinary that Mr. Gray omitted to mention the islands on Derwentwater; one of which, I think they call it Vicars' Island, makes a principal object in the scene. See Smith's View of Derwentwater.</NOTE>. At
<PB N="362" REF="365"/>
the foot of it, a few paces from the brink, gently sloping upward, stands Armathwate in a thick grove of Scotch firs, commanding a noble view directly up the lake: at a small di∣stance behind the house is a large extent of wood, and still behind this a ridge of cultivated hills, on which, according to the Keswick proverb, <HI>the sun always shines.</HI> The inhabitants here, on the contrary, call the vale of Derwentwater, <HI>the Devil's chamber-pot,</HI> and pronounce the name of <HI>Skiddaw-fell,</HI> which terminates here, with a sort of terror and aversion. Armathwate house is a modern fabrick, not large, and built of dark-red stone, belonging to Mr. Spedding, whose grandfather was stew∣ard to old Sir James Lowther, and bought this estate of the Himers. The sky was overcast and the wind cool; so, after dining at a publick-house, which stands here near the bridge, (that crosses the Derwent just where it issues from the lake) and sauntering a little by the water-side, I came home again. The turnpike is finished from Cockermouth hither, five miles, and is carrying on to Penrith: several little showers to-day. A man came in, who said there was snow on Cross-fell this morning.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 7. I walked in the morning to Crow-park, and in the evening up Penrith road. The clouds came rolling up the mountains all round very dark, yet the moon shone at intervals. It was too damp to go towards the lake. To-morrow I mean to bid farewel to Keswick.</P>
<P>Botany might be studied here to great advantage at another season, because of the great variety of soils and elevations, all lying within a small compass. I observed nothing but several
<PB N="363" REF="366"/>
curious lichens, and plenty of gale or Dutch myrtle perfuming the borders of the lake. This year the Wadd-mine had been opened, which is done once in five years; it is taken out in lumps sometimes as big as a man's fist, and will undergo no preparation by fire, not being fusible; when it is pure, soft, black, and close-grained, it is worth sometimes thirty shillings a pound. There are no charr ever taken in these lakes, but plenty in Butter-mere-water, which lies a little way north of Borrowdale, about Martinmas, which are potted here. They sow chiefly oats and bigg here, which are now cutting and still on the ground; the rains have done much hurt: yet observe, the soil is so thin and light, that no day has passed in which I could not walk out with ease, and you know I am no lover of dirt. Fell mutton is now in season for about six weeks; it grows fat on the mountains, and nearly resembles venison. Ex∣cellent pike and perch, here called Bass; trout is out of season; partridge in great plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 8. I left Keswick and took the Ambleside road in a gloomy morning; and about two miles from the town mounted an eminence called Castle-rigg, and the sun breaking out, dis∣covered the most enchanting view I have yet seen of the whole valley behind me, the two lakes, the river, the mountains all in their glory; so that I had almost a mind to have gone back again. The road in some few parts is not compleated, yet good country road, through sound but narrow and stony lanes, very safe in broad day-light. This is the case about Causeway∣foot, and among Naddle-fells to Lancwaite. The vale you go in has little breadth; the mountains are vast and rocky, the fields little and poor, and the inhabitants are now making hay,
<PB N="364" REF="367"/>
and see not the sun by two hours in a day so long as at Kes∣wick. Came to the foot of Helvellyn, along which runs an excellent road, looking down from a little height on Lee's-water, (called also Thirl-meer, or Wiborn-water) and soon descending on its margin. The lake looks black from its depth, and from the gloom of the vast crags that scowl over it, though really clear as glass; it is narrow, and about three miles long, resembling a river in its course; little shining torrents hurry down the rocks to join it, but not a bush to overshadow them, or cover their march; all is rock and loose stones up to the very brow, which lies so near your way, that not above half the height of Helvellyn can be seen.</P>
<P>Next I passed by the little chapel of Wiborn, out of which the Sunday congregation were then issuing; soon after a beck near Dunmeil-raise, when I entered Westmoreland a second time; and now began to see Holm-crag, distinguished from its rugged neighbours, not so much by its height as by the strange broken outlines of its top, like some gigantick building demolished, and the stones that composed it flung cross each other in wild confusion. Just beyond it opens one of the sweet∣est landscapes that art ever attempted to imitate. The bosom of the mountains spreading here into a broad bason discovers in the midst Grasmere-water; its margin is hollowed into small bays, with bold eminences; some of rock, some of soft turf, that half-conceal, and vary the figure of the little lake they command: from the shore, a low promontory pushes itself far into the water, and on it stands a white village with the parish church rising in the midst of it: hanging inclosures, corn-fields, and meadows green as an emerald, with their trees and hedges, and
<PB N="365" REF="368"/>
cattle, fill up the whole space from the edge of the water: and just opposite to you is a large farm-house at the bottom of a steep smooth lawn, embosomed in old woods, which climb half-way up the mountain's side, and discover above them a broken line of crags that crown the scene. Not a single red tile, no flaring gentleman's house, or garden-walls, break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise; but all is peace, rusticity, and happy poverty in its neatest most becoming attire.</P>
<P>The road winds here over Grasmere-hill, whose rocks soon conceal the water from your sight; yet it is continued along behind them, and, contracting itself to a river, communicates with Ridale-water, another small lake, but of inferior size and beauty; it seems shallow too, for large patches of reeds appear pretty far within it. Into this vale the road descends. On the opposite banks large and ancient woods mount up the hills; and just to the left of our way stands Ridale-hall, the family-seat of Sir Michael Fleming, a large old-fashioned fabrick, sur∣rounded with wood. Sir Michael is now on his travels, and all this timber, far and wide, belongs to him. Near the house rises a huge crag, called Ridale-head, which is said to command a full view of Wynander-mere, and I doubt it not; for within a mile that great lake is visible, even from the road: as to going up the crag, one might as well go up Skiddaw.</P>
<P>I now reached Ambleside, eighteen miles from Keswick, meaning to lie there; but, on looking into the best bed-cham∣ber, dark and damp as a cellar, grew delicate, gave up Wy∣nander-mere in despair, and resolved I would go on to Kendal
<PB N="366" REF="369"/>
directly, fourteen miles farther<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By not staying a little at Ambleside, Mr. Gray lost the sight of two most magnificent cascades; the one not above half a mile behind the inn, the other down Ridale-crag, where Sir Michael Fleming is now making a path-way to the top of it. These, when I saw them, were in full torrent, whereas Lawdoor water-fall, which I visited in the evening of the very same day, was almost with∣out a stream. Hence I conclude that this distinguished feature in the vale of Keswick, is, like most northern rivers, only in high beauty during bad weather. But his greatest loss was in not seeing a small water-fall visible only through the window of a ruined summer-house in Sir Michael's orchard. Here Nature has performed every thing in little that she usually executes on her largest scale; and on that account, like the miniature painter, seems to have finished every part of it in a studied manner; not a little fragment of rock thrown into the bason, not a single stem of brushwood that starts from its craggy sides but has its picturesque meaning; and the little central stream dashing down a cleft of the darkest∣coloured stone, produces an effect of light and shadow beautiful beyond descrip∣tion. This little theatrical scene might be painted as large as the original, on a canvass not bigger than those which are usually dropped in the Opera-house.</NOTE>. The road in general fine turnpike, but some parts (about three miles in all) not made, yet without danger.</P>
<P>For this determination I was unexpectedly well rewarded: for the afternoon was fine, and the road, for the space of full five miles, ran along the side of Wynander-mere, with delicious views across it, and almost from one end to the other. It is ten miles in length, and at most a mile over, resembling the course of some vast and magnificent river; but no flat marshy grounds, no osier∣beds, or patches of scrubby plantations on its banks: at the head two vallies open among the mountains; one, that by which we came down, the other Langsledale, in which Wry-nose and Hard∣knot, two great mountains, rise above the rest: from thence the fells visibly sink, and soften along its sides; sometimes they run
<PB N="367" REF="370"/>
into it (but with a gentle declivity) in their own dark and na∣tural complexion: oftener they are green and cultivated, with farms interspersed, and round eminences, on the border covered with trees: towards the south it seemed to break into larger bays, with several islands and a wider extent of cultivation. The way rises continually, till at a place called Orrest-head it turns south-east, losing sight of the water.</P>
<P>Passed by Ing's-Chapel and Staveley; but I can say no far∣ther, for the dusk of evening coming on, I entered Kendal almost in the dark, and could distinguish only a shadow of the castle on a hill, and tenter-grounds spread far and wide round the town, which I mistook for houses. My inn promised sadly, having two wooden galleries, like Scotland, in front of it: it was indeed an old ill-contrived house, but kept by civil sensible people; so I stayed two nights with them, and fared and slept very comfortably.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 9. The air mild as summer, all corn off the ground, and the sky-larks singing aloud (by the way, I saw not one at Kes∣wick, perhaps, because the place abounds in birds of prey). I went up the castle-hill; the town consists chiefly of three nearly parallel streets, almost a mile long; except these, all the other houses seem as if they had been dancing a country-dance, and were out: there they stand back to back, corner to corner, some up hill, some down, without intent or meaning. Along by their side runs a fine brisk stream, over which are three stone∣bridges; the buildings (a few comfortable houses excepted) are mean, of stone, and covered with a bad rough cast. Near the end of the town stands a handsome house of Col. Wilson's, and
<PB N="368" REF="371"/>
adjoining to it the church, a very large gothick fabrick, with a square tower; it has no particular ornaments but double isles, and at the east-end four chapels or choirs; one of the Parrs, another of the Stricklands; the third is the proper choir of the church, and the fourth of the Bellinghams, a family now ex∣tinct. There is an altar-tomb of one of them dated 1577, with a flat brass, arms and quarterings; and in the window their arms alone, arg. a hunting-horn, sab. strung gules. In the Stricklands' chapel several modern monuments, and another old altar-tomb, not belonging to the family: on the side of it a fess dancetty between ten billets deincourt. In the Parr's chapel is a third altar-tomb in the corner, no figure or inscription, but on the side, cut in stone, an escutcheon of Roos of Kendal, (three water-budgets) quartering Parr (two bars in a bordure engrail∣ed); 2dly, an escutcheon, vaire, a fess for marmion; 3dly, an escutcheon, three chevronels braced, and a chief (which I take for Fitzhugh): at the foot is an escutcheon, surrounded with the garter, bearing Roos and Parr quarterly, quartering the other two before-mentioned. I have no books to look in, therefore cannot say whether this is the Lord Parr of Kendal, Queen Catharine's father, or her brother the Marquis of Northamp∣ton: perhaps it is a cenotaph for the latter who was buried at Warwick in 1571. The remains of the castle are seated on a fine hill on the side of the river opposite the town; almost the whole inclosure of the walls remains, with four towers, two square and two round, but their upper part and embattlements are demolished: it is of rough stone and cement, without any ornament or arms, round, inclosing a court of like form, and surrounded by a moat; nor ever could it have been larger than it is, for there are no traces of outworks. There is a good view
<PB N="369" REF="372"/>
of the town and river, with a fertile open valley through which it winds.</P>
<P>After dinner I went along the Milthrop turnpike, four miles, to see the falls, or force, of the river Kent; came to Sizergh, (pronounced Siser) and turned down a lane to the left. This seat of the Stricklands, an old Catholick family, is an ancient hall-house, with a very large tower embattled; the rest of the buildings added to it are of later date, but all is white, and seen to advantage on a back ground of old trees; there is a small park also well wooded. Opposite to this, turning to the left, I soon came to the river; it works its way in a narrow and deep rocky channel overhung with trees. The calmness and bright∣ness of the evening, the roar of the waters, and the thumping of huge hammers at an iron-forge not far distant, made it a singular walk; but as to the falls (for there are two) they are not four feet high. I went on, down to the forge, and saw the demons at work by the light of their own fires: the iron is brought in pigs to Milthrop by sea from Scotland, &amp;c. and is here beat into bars and plates. Two miles further, at Levens, is the seat of Lord Suffolk, where he sometimes passes the sum∣mer: it was a favourite place of his late Countess; but this I did not see.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 10. I proceeded by Burton to Lancaster, twenty-two miles; very good country, well inclosed and wooded, with some common interspersed. Passed at the foot of Farlton-knot, a high fell four miles north of Lancaster; on a rising ground called Boulton (pronounced Bouton) we had a full view of Cartmell∣sands, with here and there a passenger riding over them (it
<PB N="370" REF="373"/>
being low water); the points of Furness shooting far into the sea, and lofty mountains, partly covered with clouds, extending north of them. Lancaster also appeared very conspicuous and fine; for its most distinguished features, the castle and church, mounted on a green eminence, were all that could be seen. Woe is me! when I got thither, it was the second day of their fair; the inn, in the principal street, was a great old gloomy house full of people; but I found tolerable quarters, and even slept two nights in peace.</P>
<P>In a fine afternoon I ascended the castle-hill; it takes up the higher top of the eminence on which it stands, and is irregu∣larly round, encompassed with a deep moat: in front, towards the town, is a magnificent gothic gateway, lofty and huge; the overhanging battlements are supported by a triple range of corbels, the intervals pierced through, and shewing the day from above. On its top rise light watch-towers of small height. It opens below with a grand pointed arch; over this is a wrought tabernacle, doubtless once containing its founder's figure; on one side a shield of France semy-quartered with England; on the other the same, with a label, ermine, for John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. This opens to a court within, which I did not much care to enter, being the county-gaol, and full of pri∣soners, both criminals and debtors. From this gateway the walls continue and join it to a vast square tower of great height, the lower part at least of remote antiquity; for it has small round-headed lights with plain short pillars on each side of them: there is a third tower, also square and of less dimensions. This is all the castle. Near it, and but little lower, stands the church, a large and plain gothic fabrick; the high square tower
<PB N="371" REF="374"/>
at the west-end has been rebuilt of late years, but nearly in the same style: there are no ornaments of arms, &amp;c. any where to be seen; within, it is lightsome and spacious, but not one mo∣nument of antiquity, or piece of painted glass is left. From the church-yard there is an extensive sea-view, (for now the tide had almost covered the sands, and filled the river) and besides the greatest part of Furness, I could distinguish Peel-castle on the isle of Fowdrey, which lies off its southern extremity. The town is built on the slope, and at the foot of the castle-hill, more than twice the bigness of Aukland, with many neat build∣ings of white stone, but a little disorderly in their position, and <Q REND="inline">"ad libitum"</Q>, like Kendal: many also extend below on the keys by the river-side, where a number of ships were moored, some of them three-masted vessels decked out with their colours in honour of the fair. Here is a good bridge of four arches over the Lune, that runs, when the tide is out, in two streams divided by a bed of gravel, which is not covered but in spring∣tides; below the town it widens to near the breadth of the Thames at London, and meets the sea at five or six miles dis∣tance to south-west.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 11. I crossed the river and walked over a peninsula, three miles, to the village of Pooton, which stands on the beach. An old fisherman mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of passing those sands) told me, in his dialect, a moving story; how a brother of the trade, a Cockler, as he styled him, driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown) in it, and his wife on horseback following, set out one day to pass the seven-mile sands, as they had frequently been used to do; (for nobody in the village knew them better than the old man
<PB N="372" REF="375"/>
did) when they were about half-way over, a thick fog rose, and as they advanced they found the water much deeper than they expected: the old man was puzzled; he stopped, and said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with; they staid a while for him; but in vain; they called aloud, but no reply: at last the young women pressed their mother to think where they were, and go on; she would not leave the place; she wandered about forlorn and amazed; she would not quit her horse and get into the cart with them: they determi∣ned, after much time wasted, to turn back, and give themselves up to the guidance of their horses. The old woman was soon washed off, and perished; the poor girls clung close to their cart, and the horse, sometimes wading and sometimes swim∣ming, brought them back to land alive, but senseless with terror and distress, and unable for many days to give any ac∣count of themselves. The bodies of their parents were found next ebb; that of the father a very few paces distant from the spot where he had left them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I wandered about the town, and by the key, till it grew dark.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 12. I set out for Settle by a fine turnpike-road, twenty∣nine miles, through a rich and beautiful inclosed country, di∣versified with frequent villages and churches, very unequal ground; and on the left the river Lune winding in a deep val∣ley, its hanging banks cloathed with fine woods, thro' which you catch long reaches of the water, as the road winds about at a considerable height above it. In the most picturesque part of the way, I passed the park belonging to the Hon. Mr. Clif∣ford,
<PB N="373" REF="376"/>
a Catholick. The grounds between him and the river are indeed charming<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This scene opens just three miles from Lancaster, on what is called the Queen's Road. To see the view in perfection, you must go into a field on the left. Here Ingleborough, behind a variety of lesser mountains, makes the back∣ground of the prospect: on each hand of the middle distance, rise two sloping hills; the left cloathed with thick woods, the right with variegated rock and herbage: between them, in the richest of vallies, the Lune serpentizes for many a mile, and comes forth ample and clear, through a well-wooded and richly pa∣stured fore-ground. Every feature, which constitutes a perfect landscape of the extensive sort, is here not only boldly marked, but also in its best position.</NOTE>; the house is ordinary, and the park nothing but a rocky fell scattered over with ancient hawthorns. Next I came to Hornby, a little town on the river Wanning, over which a handsome bridge is now building; the castle, in a lordly situation, attracted me, so I walked up the hill to it: first presents itself a large white ordinary sashed Gentleman's house, and behind it rises the ancient Keep, built by Edward Stanley, Lord Monteagle. He died about 1529, in King Henry the Eighth's time. It is now only a shell, the rafters are laid within it as for flooring. I went up a winding stone-stair-case in one corner to the leads, and at the angle is a single hexagon watch-tower, rising some feet higher, fitted up in the taste of a modern summer-house, with sash-windows in gilt frames, a stucco cupola, and on the top a vast gilt eagle, built by Mr. Charteris, the present possessor. He is the second son of the Earl of Wemys, brother to the Lord Elcho, and grandson to Col. Charteris, whose name he bears.</P>
<P>From the leads of the tower there is a fine view of the coun∣try round, and much wood near the castle. Ingleborough, which I had seen before distinctly at Lancaster to north-east,
<PB N="374" REF="377"/>
was now completely wrapped in clouds, all but its summit; which might have been easily mistaken for a long black cloud too, fraught with an approaching storm. Now our road be∣gun gradually to mount towards the Apennine, the trees grow∣ing less and thinner of leaves, till we came to Ingleton, eigh∣teen miles; it is a pretty village, situated very high, and yet in a valley at the foot of that huge monster of nature, Ingleborough: two torrents cross it, with great stones rolled along their beds instead of water; and over them are flung two handsome arches. The nipping air, tho' the afternoon was growing very bright, now taught us we were in Craven, the road was all up and down, though no where very steep; to the left were mountain∣tops, to the right a wide valley, all inclosed ground, and beyond it high hills again. In approaching Settle, the crags on the left drew nearer to our way, till we descended Brunton-brow into a chearful valley (though thin of trees) to Giggleswick, a village with a small piece of water by its side, covered over with coots; near it a church, which belongs also to Settle; and half a mile farther, having passed the Ribble over a bridge, I arrived there; it is a small market-town standing directly under a rocky fell; there are not in it above a dozen good∣looking houses, the rest are old and low, with little wooden porticos in front. My inn pleased me much, (though small) for the neatness and civility of the good woman that kept it; so I lay there two nights, and went,</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 13. To visit Gordale-scar, which lay six miles from Settle; but that way was directly over a fell, and as the wea∣ther was not to be depended on, I went round in a chaise, the only way one could get near it in a carriage, which made it full
<PB N="375" REF="378"/>
thirteen miles, half of it such a road! but I got safe over it, so there's an end, and came to Malham, (pronounced Maum) a village in the bosom of the mountains, seated in a wild and dreary valley. From thence I was to walk a mile over very rough ground, a torrent rattling along on the left hand; on the cliffs above hung a few goats; one of them danced and scratched an ear with its hind foot in a place where I would not have stood stock-still
<Q><L>For all beneath the moon.</L></Q>
As I advanced, the crags seemed to close in, but discovered a narrow entrance turning to the left between them: I followed my guide a few paces, and the hills opened again into no large space; and then all farther way is barred by a stream that, at the height of about fifty feet, gushes from a hole in the rock, and spreading in large sheets over its broken front, dashes from steep to steep, and then rattles away in a torrent down the valley: the rock on the left rises perpendicular, with stub∣bed yew-trees and shrubs staring from its side, to the height of at least 300 feet; but these are not the thing: it is the rock to the right, under which you stand to see the fall, that forms the principal horror of the place. From its very base it begins to slope forwards over you in one block or solid mass without any crevice in its surface, and overshadows half the area below with its dreadful canopy; when I stood at (I believe) four yards distance from its foot, the drops, which perpetually distil from its brow, fell on my head; and in one part of its top, more exposed to the weather, there are loose stones that hang in air, and threaten visibly some idle spectator with instant destruction; it is safer to shelter yourself close to its bottom, and trust to the mercy of that enormous mass which nothing but an earthquake
<PB N="376" REF="379"/>
can stir. The gloomy uncomfortable day well suited the savage aspect of the place, and made it still more formidable: I stayed there, not without shuddering, a quarter of an hour, and thought my trouble richly paid; for the impression will last for life. At the alehouse where I dined in Malham, Vivares, the landscape-painter, had lodged for a week or more; Smith and Bellers had also been there, and two prints of Gordale have been engraved by them.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 14. Leaving my comfortable inn, to which I had re∣turned from Gordale, I set out for Skipton, sixteen miles. From several parts of the road, and in many places about Settle, I saw at once the three famous hills of this country, Ingleborough, Penigent, and Pendle; the first is esteemed the highest, and their features not to be described, but by the pencil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Without the pencil nothing indeed is to be described with precision; and even then that pencil ought to be in the very hand of the writer, ready to supply with outlines every thing that his pen cannot express by words. As far as language can describe, Mr. Gray has, I think, pushed its powers: For rejecting, as I before hinted, every general unmeaning and hyperbolical phrase, he has selected (both in this journal, and on other similar occasions) the plainest, simplest, and most direct terms: yet notwithstanding his judicious care, in the use of these, I must own I feel them defective. They present me, it is true, with a picture of the same species, but not with the identical picture: my imagination receives clear and distinct, but not true and exact images. It may be asked then, why am I entertained by well-written descriptions? I answer, because they amuse rather than inform me; and because, after I have seen the places described, they serve to recal to my memory the original scene, almost as well as the truest drawing or picture. In the meanwhile, my mind is flattered by thinking it has acquired some conception of the place, and rests contented in an innocent error, which nothing but ocular proof can detect, and which, when detected, does not diminish the pleasure I had before received, but augments it by super∣adding the charms of comparison and verification; and herein I would place the real and only merit of verbal prose description. To speak of poetical, would lead me beyond the limits as well as the purpose of this note. I cannot, however, help adding, that I have seen one piece of verbal description which compleatly satisfies me, because it is throughout assisted by masterly delineation. It is com∣posed by the Rev. Mr. Gilpin, of Cheam in Surry; and contains, amongst other places, an account of the very scenes which, in this tour, our author visited. This Gentleman, possessing the conjoined talent of a writer and a designer, has em∣ployed them in this manuscript to every purpose of picturesque beauty, in the description of which a correct eye, a practised pencil, and an eloquent pen could assist him. He has, consequently, produced a work <HI>unique</HI> in its kind at once. But I have said it is in manuscript, and, I am afraid, likely to continue so; for would his modesty permit him to print it, the great expence of plates would make its publication almost impracticable.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="380"/>
Craven, after all, is an unpleasing country when seen from a height; its valleys are chiefly wide, and either marshy or in∣closed pasture, with a few trees. Numbers of black cattle are fatted here, both of the Scotch breed, and a larger sort of oxen with great horns. There is little cultivated ground, except a few oats.</P>
<P>Skipton, to which I went through Long-Preston and Gar∣grave, is a pretty large market-town, in a valley, with one very broad street gently sloping downwards from the castle, which stands at the head of it. This is one of our good Countess's buildings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anne Countess of Pembroke and Montgomery.</NOTE>, but on old foundations; it is not very large, but of a handsome antique appearance, with round towers, a grand gateway, bridge, and moat, surrounded by many old trees. It is in good repair, and kept up as a habitation of the Earl of Thanet, though he rarely comes thither: what
<PB N="378" REF="381"/>
with the sleet, and a foolish dispute about chaises, that delayed me, I did not see the inside of it, but went on, fifteen miles, to Otley; first up Shode-bank, the steepest hill I ever saw a road carried over in England, for it mounts in a strait line (without any other repose for the horses than by placing stones every now and then behind the wheels) for a full mile; then the road goes on a level along the brow of this high hill over Rumbald-moor, till it gently descends into Wharldale, so they call the vale of the Wharf, and a beautiful vale it is, well-wooded, well-culti∣vated, well-inhabited, but with high crags at a distance, that border the green country on either hand; thro' the midst of it, deep, clear, full to the brink, and of no inconsiderable breadth, runs in long windings the river. How it comes to pass that it should be so fine and copious a stream here, and at Tadcaster (so much lower) should have nothing but a wide stony channel without water, I cannot tell you. I passed through Long∣Addingham, Ilkeley (pronounced Eecly) distinguished by a lofty brow of loose rocks to the right; Burley, a neat and pretty village among trees; on the opposite side of the river lay Mid∣dleton-Lodge, belonging to a catholic gentleman of that name; Weston, a venerable stone fabric, with large offices, of Mr. Vavasour, the meadows in front gently descending to the water, and behind a great and shady wood; Farnley (Mr. Fawkes's) a place like the last, but larger, and rising higher on the side of the hill. Otley is a large airy town, with clean but low rus∣tic buildings, and a bridge over the Wharf; I went into its spacious Gothic church, which has been new-roofed, with a flat stucco-ceiling; in a corner of it is the monument of Tho∣mas Lord Fairfax, and Helen Aske, his Lady, descended from the Cliffords and Latimers, as her epitaph says; the figures, not

ill-cut (particularly his in armour, but bare-headed) lie on the tomb. I take them to be the parents of the famous Sir Tho∣mas Fairfax.</P>

<P>I Have utterly forgot where my Journal left off, but I think it was after the account of Gordale near Settle; if so, there was little more worth your notice: the principal things were Wharldale, in the way from Skipton to Otley, and Kirstall abbey, three miles from Leeds ****<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here a paragraph, describing Wharldale in the foregoing Journal, was re∣peated.</NOTE>. Kirstall is a noble ruin in the Semi-saxon style of building, as old as King Stephen, towards the end of his reign, 1152. The whole church is still standing, the roof excepted, seated in a delicious quiet valley, on the banks of the river Aire, and preserved with religious reve∣rence by the Duke of Montagu. Adjoining to the church, be∣tween that and the river, are variety of chapels and remnants of the abbey, shattered by the encroachments of the ivy, and sur∣rounded by many a sturdy tree, whose twisted roots break thro' the fret of the vaulting, and hang streaming from the roofs. The gloom of these antient cells, the shade and verdure of the landscape, the glittering and murmur of the stream, the lofty towers and long perspectives of the church, in the midst of a clear bright day, detained me for many hours; and were the
<PB N="380" REF="383"/>
truest objects for my glass I have yet met with any where. As I lay at that smoky, ugly, busy town of Leeds, I dropped all further thoughts of my Journal; and after passing two days at Mason's (tho' he was absent) pursued my way by Nottingham, Leicester, Harborough, Kettering, Thrapston, and Huntingdon to Cambridge, where I arrived on the 22d of October, having met with no rain to signify till this last day of my journey. There's luck for you!</P>
<P>I do think of seeing Wales this summer, having never found my spirits lower than at present, and feeling that motion and change of the scene is absolutely necessary to me; I will make Aston in my way to Chester, and shall rejoice to meet you there the last week in May. Mason writes me word that he wishes it; and though his old house is down, and his new one not up, proposes to receive us like Princes in grain.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. NICHOLLS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written the 19th of November, 1764; but as it delineates another abbey, in a different manner, it seems to make no improper companion to that which precedes it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>I Received your letter at Southampton; and as I would wish to treat every body, according to their own rule and mea∣sure of good breeding, have, against my inclination, waited till now before I answered it, purely out of fear and respect, and an ingenuous diffidence of my own abilities. If you will
<PB N="381" REF="384"/>
not take this as an excuse, accept it at least as a well-turned period, which is always my principal concern.</P>
<P>So I proceed to tell you that my health is much improved by the sea, not that I drank it, or bathed in it, as the common people do: no! I only walked by it and looked upon it. The climate is remarkably mild, even in October and November; no snow has been seen to lie there for these thirty years past; the myrtles grow in the ground against the houses, and Guernsey lilies bloom in every window: the town, clean and well built, surrounded by its old stone walls, with their towers and gate∣ways, stands at the point of a peninsula, and opens full south to an arm of the sea, which, having formed two beautiful bays on each hand of it, stretches away in direct view, till it joins the British Channel; it is skirted on either side with gently-rising grounds, cloathed with thick wood, and directly cross its mouth rise the high lands of the Isle of Wight at distance, but distinct∣ly seen. In the bosom of the woods (concealed from prophane eyes) lie hid the ruins of Nettely abbey; there may be richer and greater houses of religion, but the Abbot is content with his situation. See there, at the top of that hanging meadow, under the shade of those old trees that bend into a half circle about it, he is walking slowly (good man!) and bidding his beads for the souls of his benefactors, interred in that venerable pile that lies beneath him. Beyond it (the meadow still descending) nods a thicket of oaks that mask the building, and have exclu∣ded a view too garish and luxuriant for a holy eye; only on either hand they leave an opening to the blue glittering sea. Did you not observe how, as that white sail shot by and was lost, he turned and crossed himself to drive the tempter from
<PB N="382" REF="385"/>
him that had thrown that distraction in his way? I should tell you that the ferryman who rowed me, a lusty young fellow, told me that he would not for all the world pass a night at the abbey (there were such things seen near it) though there was a power of money hid there. From thence I went to Salisbury, Wilton, and Stonhenge: But of these things I say no more, they will be published at the University press.</P>

<P>P.S. I must not close my letter without giving you one principal event of my history; which was, that (in the course of my late tour) I set out one morning before five o'clock, the moon shining through a dark and misty autumnal air, and got to the sea-coast time enough to be at the Sun's Levee. I saw the clouds and dark vapours open gradually to right and left, rolling over one another in great smoky wreathes, and the tide (as it flowed gently in upon the sands) first whitening, then slightly tinged with gold and blue; and all at once a little line of insuf∣ferable brightness that (before I can write these five words) was grown to half an orb, and now to a whole one, too glorious to be distinctly seen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This puts me in mind of a similar description written by Dr. Jeremy Taylor, which I shall here beg leave to present to the reader, who will find by it that the old Divine had occasionally as much power of description as even our modern Poet. <Q REND="inline">"As when the sun approaches towards the gates of the morning, he first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits of darkness; gives light to the cock, and calls up the lark to mattins; and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns ***; and still (while a man tells the story) the sun gets up higher till he shews a fair face and a full light." <BIBL>J.

<P>I Rejoice to hear that you are restored to better state of health, to your books, and to your muse once again. That forced dissipation and exercise we are obliged to fly to as a remedy, when this frail machine goes wrong, is often almost as bad as the distemper we would cure; yet I too have been constrained of late to pursue a like regimen, on account of certain pains in the head, (a sensation unknown to me before) and of great de∣jection of spirits. This, Sir, is the only excuse I have to make you for my long silence, and not (as perhaps you may have figured to yourself) any secret reluctance I had to tell you my mind concerning the specimen you so kindly sent me of your new Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written in answer to one that inclosed only a part of the first book of the Minstrel in manuscript, and I believe a sketch of Mr. Beattie's plan for the whole.</NOTE>: On the contrary, if I had seen any thing of im∣portance to disapprove, I should have hastened to inform you, and never doubted of being forgiven. The truth is, I greatly like all I have seen, and wish to see more. The design is simple, and pregnant with poetical ideas of various kinds, yet seems somehow imperfect at the end. Why may not young Edwin, when necessity has driven him to take up the harp, and assume the profession of a Minstrel, do some great and singular service to his country? (what service I must leave to your invention) such as no General, no Statesman, no Moralist could do with∣out
<PB N="384" REF="387"/>
the aid of music, inspiration, and poetry. This will not appear an improbability in those early times, and in a character then held sacred, and respected by all nations: Besides, it will be a full answer to all the Hermit has said, when he dissuaded him from cultivating these pleasing arts; it will shew their use, and make the best panegyrick of our favourite and celes∣tial science. And lastly, (what weighs most with me) it will throw more of action, pathos, and interest into your design, which already abounds in reflection and sentiment. As to de∣scription, I have always thought that it made the most graceful ornament of poetry, but never ought to make the subject. Your ideas are new, and borrowed from a mountainous coun∣try, the only one that can furnish truly picturesque scenery. Some trifles in the language or versification you will permit me to remark.<NOTE N="***" PLACE="foot">A few paragraphs of particular criticism are here omitted.</NOTE></P>
<P>I will not enter at present into the merits of your <HI>Essay on Truth,</HI> because I have not yet given it all the attention it deserves, tho' I have read it thro' with pleasure; besides, I am partial; for I have always thought David Hume a pernicious writer, and be∣lieve he has done as much mischief here as he has in his own country. A turbid and shallow stream often appears to our apprehensions very deep. A professed sceptic can be guided by nothing but his present passions (if he has any) and interests; and to be masters of his philosophy we need not his books or advice, for every child is capable of the same thing, without any study at all. Is not that <HI>naivetè</HI> and good humour, which his ad∣mirers celebrate in him, owing to this, that he has continued
<PB N="385" REF="388"/>
all his days an infant, but one that unhappily has been taught to read and write? That childish nation, the French, have given him vogue and fashion, and we, as usual, have learned from them to admire him at second hand.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On a similar subject Mr. Gray expresses himself thus in a letter to Mr. Wal∣pole, dated March 17, 1771: <Q REND="inline">"He must have a very good stomach that can di∣gest the <HI>Crambe recocta</HI> of Voltaire. Atheism is a vile dish, tho' all the cooks of France combine to make new sauces to it. As to the Soul, perhaps, they may have none on the Continent; but I do think we have such things in Eng∣land. Shakespear, for example, I believe had several to his own share. As to the Jews (tho' they do not eat pork) I like them because they are better Chri∣stians than Voltaire."</Q> This was written only three months before his death; and I insert it to shew how constant and uniform he was in his contempt of infidel writers. Dr. Beattie received only one letter more from his correspondent, dated March 8, 1771. It related to the first book of the Minstrel, now sent to him in print, and contained criticisms on particular passages, and commendations of par∣ticular stanzas. Those criticisms the author attended to in a future edition, be∣cause his good taste found that they deserved his attention; the passages there∣fore being altered, the strictures die of course. As to the notes of commendation, the Poem itself abounds with so many striking beauties, that they need not even the hand of Mr. Gray to point them out to a reader of any feeling: all therefore that I shall print of that letter, is the concluding paragraph relating to his Essay on the Immutability of Truth. <Q REND="inline">"I am happy to hear of your success in another way, because I think you are serving the cause of human nature, and the true interests of mankind; your book is read here too, and with just applause."</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>It is seldom that an author of a reputation so established (as Mr. How truly remarked, when he sent this extract to Mr. Gray) so easily, readily, and explicitly gives up his own opinion to that of another, or even to conviction itself; nor perhaps would Count Algarotti have done so, had he not been tho∣roughly apprized to whose correction he submitted.</P>

<P>I Was willing to go through the eight volumes of Count Al∣garotti's works, which you lately presented to the library of this College, before I returned you an answer: this must be my excuse to you for my silence. First I condole with you, that so neat an edition should swarm in almost every page with errors of the press, not only in notes and citations from Greek, English, and French authors, but in the Italian text itself, greatly to the disreputation of the Leghorn publishers. This is the only rea∣son, I think, that could make an edition in England necessary; but, I doubt, you would not find the matter much mended here; our presses, as they improve in beauty, declining daily in accuracy; besides, you would find the expence very considerable, and the sale in no proportion to it, as, in reality, it is but few people in England that read currently and with pleasure the Italian tongue, and the fine old editions of their capital writers are sold at London for a lower price than they bear in Italy. An English translation I can by no means advise; the justness of thought and good sense might remain, but the graces of elocu∣tion (which make a great part of Algarotti's merit) would be entirely lost, and that merely from the very different genius and complexion of the two languages.</P>
<P>Doubtless there can be no impropriety in your making the same present to the University that you have done to your own
<PB N="390" REF="393"/>
College. You need not at all to fear for the reputation of your friend, he has merit enough to recommend him in any country. A tincture of various sorts of knowledge, an acquaintance with all the beautiful arts, an easy command, a precision, warmth, and richness of expression, and a judgment that is rarely mista∣ken on any subject to which he applies it. I had read the <HI>Con∣gresso di Citéra</HI> before, and was excessively pleased with it, in spite of prejudice; for I am naturally no friend to allegory, nor to poetical prose. <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Giudicio d'Amore</HI>"</Q> is an addition rather inferior to it. What gives me the least pleasure of any of his writings is the <HI>Newtonianism;</HI> it is so direct an imitation of Fontenelle, a writer not easy to imitate, and least of all in the Italian tongue, whose character and graces are of a higher style, and never adapt themselves easily to the elegant <HI>badinage</HI> and <HI>legereté</HI> of conversation that sit so well on the French. The essays and letters (many of them entirely new to me) <HI>on the Arts,</HI> are curious and entertaining: Those on other subjects, (even where the thoughts are not new, but borrowed from his various reading and conversation) often better put, and better expressed than in the originals. I rejoice when I see Machiavel defended or illustrated, who to me appears one of the wisest men that any nation in any age has produced. Most of the other discourses, military or political, are well worth reading, though that on Kouli-Khan was a mere jeu d'esprit, a sort of historical exercise. The letters from Russia I had read before with pleasure, particularly the narrative of Munick and Lascy's campaigns. The detached thoughts are often new and just; but there should have been a revisal of them, as they are frequently to be found in his letters repeated in the very same words.

<P>IT is long since that I heard you were gone in haste into York∣shire on account of your mother's illness, and the same letter informed me that she was recovered, otherwise I had then wrote to you only to beg you would take care of her, and to inform you that I had discovered a thing very little known, which is, that in one's whole life one never can have any more than a single mother. You may think this is obvious, and (what you call) a trite observation. You are a green gosling! I was at the same age (very near) as wise as you, and yet I never discovered this (with full evidence and conviction I mean) till it was too late. It is thirteen years ago, and seems but as yesterday, and every day I live it sinks deeper into my heart<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He seldom mentioned his Mother without a sigh. After his death, her gowns and wearing apparel were found in a trunk in his apartments just as she had left them; it seemed as if he could never take the resolution to open it, in order to distribute them to his female relations, to whom, by his will, he be∣queathed them.</NOTE>. Many a corollary could I draw from this axiom for your use, (not for my own) but I will leave you the merit of doing it for yourself. Pray tell me how your health is: I conclude it perfect, as I hear

you offered yourself as a guide to Mr. Palgrave into the Sierra∣Morena of Yorkshire. For me, I passed the end of May and all June in Kent, not disagreeably. In the west part of it, from every eminence, the eye catches some long reach of the Thames or Medway, with all their shipping: in the east the sea breaks in upon you, and mixes its white transient sails and glittering blue expanse with the deeper and brighter greens of the woods and corn. This sentence is so fine I am quite ashamed; but no matter! You must translate it into prose. Palgrave, if he heard it, would cover his face with his pudding sleeve. I do not tell you of the great and small beasts, and creeping things innume∣rable, that I met with, because you do not suspect that this world is inhabited by any thing but men, and women, and clergy, and such two-legged cattle. Now I am here again very discon∣solate, and all alone, for Mr. Brown is gone, and the cares of this world are coming thick upon me: you, I hope, are better off, riding and walking in the woods of Studley, &amp;c. &amp;c. I must not wish for you here; besides I am going to Town at Michaelmas, by no means for amusement.</P>

<P>MY last summer's tour was through Worcestershire, Glou∣cestershire, Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and Shrop∣shire, five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom. The very principal light and capital feature of my journey was the river Wye, which I descended in a boat for near forty miles from Ross to Chepstow. Its banks are a succession of nameless beauties; one out of many you may see not ill described by Mr. Whately, in his Observations on Gardening, under the name of the New-Weir: he has also touched upon two others, Tinterne Abbey and Persfield, both of them famous scenes, and both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mentioned, lies on the same river, in a vale that is the delight of my eyes, and the very seat of pleasure. The vale of Aber∣gavenny,
<PB N="395" REF="398"/>
Ragland, and Chepstow castles; Ludlow, Malvern∣hills, Hampton-Court, near Lemster; the Leasows, Hagley, the three cities and their cathedrals; and lastly Oxford (where I passed two days on my return with great satisfaction) were the rest of my acquisitions, and no bad harvest in my opinion; but I made no journal myself, else you should have had it: I have indeed a short one written by the companion of my travels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Nicholls.</NOTE>, that serves to recal and fix the fleeting images of these things.</P>
<P>I have had a cough upon me these three months, which is incurable. The approaching summer I have sometimes had thoughts of spending on the Continent; but I have now drop∣ped that intention, and believe my expeditions will terminate in Old Park: but I make no promise, and can answer for nothing; my own employment so sticks in my stomach, and troubles my conscience: and yet travel I must, or cease to exist. Till this year I hardly knew what (mechanical) low spirits were, but now I even tremble at an east wind.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This is the last Letter which I have selected for this Section; and I insert it chiefly for the occasion which it affords me of commenting on the latter part of it, where he speaks of his own employment as Professor of Modern History; an office which he had now held nearly three years, and had not begun to execute the duties of it. His health, which was all the time gradually on the decline, and his spirits only supported by the frequent summer excursions, during this period, might, to the candid reader, be a sufficient apology for this omission, or rather procrastination: but there is more to be said in his excuse; and
<PB N="396" REF="399"/>
I should ill execute the office I have undertaken of arranging these papers, with a view of doing honour to his memory, if I did not endeavour to remove every exception that might, with a show of reason, be taken to his conduct in this instance.</P>
<P>His business, as Professor, consisted of two parts; one, the teaching of modern Languages; the other, the reading of lectures on Modern History. The patent which created the office, au∣thorized him to execute the former of these by deputies; the latter, the same patent prescribed to him, to commence by reading a public lecture in the schools, and to continue to do so once at least in every term. As this patent did not ascertain the language in which the lecture was to be read, he was at li∣berty to do it either in Latin or English; he chose the former, and I think rather injudiciously; because, tho' no man, in the earlier part of his life, was more ready in Latin composition, he had now lost the habit, and might therefore well have excused him∣self, by the nature of his subject, from any superadded diffi∣culty of language. However, immediately on his appointment, he sketched out an admirable plan for his inauguration speech; in which, after enumerating the preparatory and auxiliary stu∣dies requisite, such as Antient History, Georgraphy, Chrono∣logy, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amongst these auxiliaries, he has set down <HI>Memoria Tecnica;</HI> an art in which he had much exercised himself when young. I find many memorial verses among his scattered papers: and I suspect he found good account in the practice; for few men were more ready and accurate in their dates of events than our Author.</NOTE> he descended to the authentic sources of the science, such as Public Treaties—State Records—Private Correspondence of Ambassadors, &amp;c. He also wrote the Exordium of this The∣sis;
<PB N="397" REF="400"/>
not indeed in a manner correct enough to be here given by way of Fragment: but so spirited, in point of sentiment, as leaves it much to be lamented, that he did not proceed to its com∣pletion. At the same time he drew up, and laid before the Duke of Grafton, just then chosen Chancellor of the University, three different schemes for regulating the method of choosing pupils privately to be instructed by him: one of these was so much approved as to be sent to Oxford, in order to be observed by the new Professor then appointed in that place: and the same plan, or something very similar to it, regulates the private lec∣tures which Mr. Gray's successor now reads at Cambridge; but the public ones, I believe, are still omitted in both Universities: and yet I conceive, that on these (had Mr. Gray been appointed earlier in life to the office) he would have chosen chiefly to ex∣ert his uncommon abilities. Indeed, if we consider the nature of the study itself, Modern History, so far as it is a detail of facts, (and so far only, a boy just come from school can be sup∣posed to be taught it) may be as compleatly learned from private reading as from the mouth of any lecturer whatever. What can his lecture consist of, if it aims to teach what it ought, but a chain of well-authenticated events, judiciously selected from the numerous writers on the subject? What can it then be more than an abridgment added to the innumerable ones with which our libraries are already crouded? I know of no difficult propositions which this study contains, to the proof of which the pupil must be led step after step by the slow hand of demonstration; or that require to be elucidated by the conviction of a mechanical experiment. On this subject carefully to read, is compleatly to understand; it is the exercise of memory, not of reason. But a public Lecturer, reading to an audience well
<PB N="398" REF="401"/>
instructed in these facts, has a wider and nobler field. It is his province to trace every important event to its political spring; to develope the cause, and thence deduce the consequence. In the course of such disquisitions, the rational faculties of his auditors are employed in weighing the force of his arguments, and their judgments finally convinced by the decisive strength of them. What would be an idle display of either logic or rhetoric, where youths are only to be initiated into the know∣ledge of facts, becomes before this circle of mature hearers, a necessary exertion of erudition and genius. From such lectures, afterwards collected into a volume, not only the University but the nation itself, nay all other nations might reap their advan∣tage; and receive from this, the benefit they have received from other similar institutions: For though Mr. Gray, in one of the plans lately mentioned, observes, that <Q REND="inline">"Lectures read in public are generally things of more ostentation than use; yet" (he adds) "if indeed they should gradually swell into a book, and the Author should find reason to hope they might deserve the attention of the publick, it is possible they might become of general service; of this we have already some instances, as Judge Blackstone's Lectures on the Common Law, and the Bishop of Oxford's on Hebrew Poetry."</Q></P>
<P>But these reflections lead me beyond my purpose, which was only to remove from my deceased friend any imputation which, on this account, might rest on his memory. Certain it is, that notwithstanding his ill health, he constantly intended to read lectures; and I remember the last time he visited me at Aston, in the summer of the year 1770, he expressed much chagrin on this subject, and even declared it to be his stedfast resolution
<PB N="399" REF="402"/>
to resign his Professorship, if he found himself unable to do real service in it. What I said to dissuade him from this, tho' I urged, as may be supposed, every argument I could think of, had, I found, so little weight with him, that I am almost per∣suaded he would very soon have put this intention into execu∣tion. But death prevented the trial; the particulars of which it is now my melancholy office to relate.</P>
<P>The Gout, which he always believed hereditary in his con∣stitution, (for both his parents died of that distemper) had for several years attacked him in a weakly and unfixed manner; and the great temperance which he observed, particularly in regard to his drinking, served, perhaps, to prevent any severe paroxism, but by no means eradicated the constitutional malady. In the latter end of May, 1771, just about the time he wrote the last letter, he removed to London, where he became feverish, and his dejection of spirits increased: the weather being then very sultry, our common friend, Dr. Gisborne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Physician to his Majesty's Houshold.</NOTE>, advised him, for an opener and freer air, to remove from his lodgings in Jermyn∣street to Kensington, where he frequently attended him, and where Mr. Gray so far got the better of his disorder, as to be able to return to Cambridge; meaning from thence to set out very soon for Old Park, in hopes that travelling, from which he usually received so much benefit, would compleat his cure: but on the 24th of July, while at dinner in the College Hall, he felt a sudden nausea, which obliged him to rise from table and retire to his chamber. This continued to increase, and nothing staying on his stomach, he sent for his friend Dr. Glynn, who finding it to be the gout in that part, thought his case dangerous,
<PB N="400" REF="403"/>
and called in Dr. Plumptree, the Physical Professor: they pre∣scribed to him the usual cordials given in that distemper, but without any good effect; for on the 29th he was seized with a strong convulsion fit, which, on the 30th, returned with in∣creased violence, and on the next evening he expired. He was sensible at times almost to the last, and from the first aware of his extreme danger; but expressed no visible concern at the thoughts of his approaching dissolution.</P>
<P>This account I draw up from the letters which Dr. Brown, then on the spot, wrote to me during his short illness; and as I felt strongly at the time what Tacitus has so well expressed on a similar occasion, I may, with propriety, use his words: <Q REND="inline">"Mihi, praeter acerbitatem amici erepti, auget maestitiam, quod adsidere valetudini, fovere deficientem, satiari vultu, complexu, non contigit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vita Agricolae, cap. xlv.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> I was then on the eastern side of Yorkshire, at a distance from the direct post, and therefore did not receive the melancholy intelligence soon enough to be able to reach Cambridge before his corpse had been carried to the place he had, by will, appointed for its interment. To see the last rites duly performed, therefore, fell to the lot of Dr. Brown; I had only to join him, on his return from the funeral, in executing the other trusts which his friendship had authorized us jointly to perform.</P>
<P>The method in which I have arranged the foregoing pages, has, I trust, one degree of merit, that it makes the reader so well acquainted with the man himself, as to render it totally unnecessary to conclude the whole with his character. If I am mistaken in this point, I have been a compiler to little
<PB N="401" REF="404"/>
purpose; and I chose to be this rather than a biographer, that I might do the more justice to the virtues and genius of my friend. I might have written his life in the common form, perhaps with more reputation to myself; but, surely, not with equal information to the reader; for whose sake I have never related a single circumstance of Mr. Gray's life in my own words, when I could employ <HI>his</HI> for the purpose. Fortunately I had more materials for this use, than commonly fall to the lot of an Editor; and I certainly have not been sparing in the use of them: whether I have been too lavish, must be left to the decision of the public.</P>
<P>With respect to the Latin Poems, which I have printed in the three first Sections of these Memoirs, I must beg leave to add one word here, though a little out of place. A learned and ingenious person, to whom I communicated them, after they were printed off, was of opinion, that they contain some few expressions not warranted by any good authority; and that there are one or two false quantities to be found in them. I once had an intention to cancel the pages, and correct the passages objected to, according to my friend's criticisms; but, on second thoughts, I deemed it best to let them stand exactly as I found them in the manuscripts. The accurate classical reader will perhaps be best pleased with finding out the faulty passages himself; and his candour will easily make the proper allowances for any little mistakes in verses, which he will con∣sider never had the author's last hand.</P>
<P>I might here lay down my pen, yet if any reader should still want his character, I will give him one which was published very
<PB N="402" REF="405"/>
soon after Mr. Gray's decease<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appeared in the London Magazine a month or two after his decease, and was prefaced with an Eulogy on his poetical merit, which I did not think neces∣sary to reprint in a work where that merit so very fully speaks for itself.</NOTE>. It appears to be well written; and, as it comes from an anonymous pen, I chuse the rather to insert it, as it will, on that account, be less suspected of parti∣ality.</P>
<Q><P>"Perhaps he was the most learned man in Europe. He was equally acquainted with the elegant and profound parts of science, and that not superficially but thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both natural<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have given, in the beginning of this Section, an account of the great pains which Mr. Gray bestowed on Natural History. I have since been favoured with a Letter from a Gentleman, well skilled in that science, who after carefully perusing his interleaved Systema Naturae of Linnaeus, gives me this character of it: <Q REND="inline">"In the class of animals (the Mammalia) he has concentrated (if I may use the expression) what the old writers and the diffuse Buffon have said upon the subject; he was universally adapted the concise language of Linnaeus, and has given it an elegance which the Swede had no idea of; but there is little of his own in this class, and it served him only as a common-place; but it is such a common-place that few men but Mr. Gray could form. In the birds and fishes he has most accurately described all that he had an opportunity of examining: but the volume of insects is the most perfect; on the English insects there is certainly nothing so perfect. In regard to the plants, there is little else than the English names and their native soils extracted from the Species Plantarum of Linnaeus. I suppose no man was so complete a master of his system; he has se∣lected the distinguishing marks of each animal, &amp;c. with the greatest judgment, and, what no man else probably could have done, he has made the German La∣tin of Linnaeus purely classical."</Q></NOTE> and civil; had read all the original historians of England, France, and Italy; and was a great antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics, morals, politics made a principal part of his plan of study; voyages
<PB N="403" REF="406"/>
and travels of all sorts were his favourite amusement: and he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and gar∣dening<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">He has disclaimed any skill in this art in the xxxvith Letter of the fourth Section, and usually held it in less estimation than I think it deserves, declaring himself to be only charmed with the bolder features of unadorned nature.</NOTE>. With such a fund of knowledge, his conversation must have been equally instructing and entertaining; but he was also a good man, a well-bred man, a man of virtue and humanity. There is no character without some speck, some imperfection; and I think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather effeminacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is rightly put; it was rather an affectation in delicacy and effeminacy than the things themselves; and he chose to put on this appearance chiefly be∣fore persons whom he did not wish to please.</NOTE>, and a visible fa∣stidiousness, or contempt and disdain of his inferiors in science. He also had in some degree that weakness which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr. Congreve<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have often thought that Mr. Congreve might very well be vindicated on this head. It seldom happens that the vanity of authorship continues to the end of a man's days, it usually soon leaves him where it found him; and if he has not something better to build his self-approbation upon than that of being a popular writer, he generally finds himself ill at ease, if respected only on that account. Mr. Congreve was much advanced in years when the young French Poet paid him this visit; and, though a man of the world, he might now feel that indifference to literary fame which Mr. Gray, who always led a more retired and philosophic life, certainly felt much earlier. Both of them therefore might reasonably, at times, express some disgust, if their quiet was intruded upon by persons who thought they flattered them by such intrusion.</NOTE>: though he seemed to value others, chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It was not on account of their knowledge that he valued mankind. He contemned indeed all pretenders to literature, but he did not select his friends from the literary class, merely because they were literate. To be his friend it was always either necessary that a man should have something better than an im∣proved understanding, or at least that Mr. Gray should believe he had.</NOTE>; yet he could not bear to be considered him∣self
<PB N="404" REF="407"/>
merely as a man of letters; and though without birth; or fortune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent Gentleman, who read for his amusement. Perhaps it may be said, What signifies so much knowledge, when it produced so little? Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial, but a few poems? But let it be con∣sidered, that Mr. Gray was to others, at least innocently em∣ployed; to himself, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably; he was every day making some new acquisition in science; his mind was enlarged, his heart softened, his virtue strengthened; the world and mankind were shewn to him without a mask; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and unworthy of the attention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knowledge, and the practice of virtue, in that state wherein God hath placed us."</P></Q>

<L>LO! where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,</L>
<L>Fair VENUS' train appear,</L>
<L>Disclose the long-expecting flowers,</L>
<L>And wake the purple year!</L>
<L>The Attic warbler pours her throat,</L>
<L>Responsive to the cuckow's note,</L>
<L>The untaught harmony of spring:</L>
<L>While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,</L>
<L>Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky</L>
<L>Their gather'd fragrance fling.</L>
</LG>

<L>Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch</L>

<L>Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech</L>
<L>O'er-canopies the glade,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="422"/>
Beside some water's rushy brink</L>
<L>With me the Muse shall sit, and think</L>
<L>(At ease reclin'd in rustic state)</L>
<L>How vain the ardour of the Crowd,</L>
<L>How low, how little are the Proud,</L>
<L>How indigent the Great!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still is the toiling hand of Care:</L>
<L>The panting herds repose:</L>
<L>Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air</L>
<L>The busy murmur glows!</L>
<L>The insect youth are on the wing,</L>
<L>Eager to taste the honied spring,</L>
<L>And float amid the liquid noon:</L>
<L>Some lightly o'er the current skim,</L>
<L>Some shew their gayly-gilded trim</L>
<L>Quick-glancing to the sun.</L>
</LG>

<L>To Contemplation's sober eye</L>

Alike the Busy and the Gay</L>
<L>But flutter thro' life's little day,</L>
<L>In fortune's varying colours drest:</L>
<L>Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,</L>
<L>Or chill'd by age, their airy dance</L>
<L>They leave, in dust to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I hear in accents low</L>
<L>The sportive kind reply:</L>
<L>Poor moralist! and what art thou?</L>
<L>A solitary fly!</L>
<L>Thy joys no glittering female meets,</L>
<L>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,</L>

<L>The hapless Nymph with wonder saw:</L>
<L>A whisker first and then a claw,</L>

<L>What female heart can gold despise?</L>
<L>What Cat's averse to fish?</L>

<L>Presumptuous Maid! with looks intent</L>

<P>The design of Mr. Gray in writing this and the three following imitative Odes is given in the Memoirs of his Life. For the better understanding the first of these, the reader is to be informed that in the Eleventh Century <HI>Sigurd,</HI> Earl of the Orkney-Islands, went with a fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops into Ireland, to the assistance of <HI>Sictryg with the silken beard,</HI> who was then ma∣king war on his father-in-law <HI>Brian,</HI> King of Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut to pieces, and <HI>Sictryg</HI> was in danger of a total defeat; but the enemy had a greater loss by the Death of <HI>Brian,</HI> their King, who fell in the action. On Christmas-day, (the day of the battle,) a Native of <HI>Caithness</HI> in Scotland saw at a distance a number of persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill, and seeming to enter into it. Curiosity led him to follow them, till looking through an opening in the rocks he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling women: they were all employed about a loom; and as they wove, they sung the following dreadful Song; which, when they had finished, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) galloped Six to the North and as many to the South. These were the <HI>Valkyriur,</HI> female Divinities, Servants of <HI>Odin</HI> (or <HI>Woden</HI>) in the Gothic mythology. Their name signifies <HI>Chusers of the slain.</HI> They were mounted on swift horses, with drawn swords in their hands; and in the throng of battle selected such as were destined to slaughter, and conducted them to <HI>Valkalla,</HI> the hall of <HI>Odin,</HI> or paradise of the Brave; where they attended the banquet, and served the departed Heroes with horns of mead and ale.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>The original manuscript title, which Mr. Gray gave to this Ode, was NOON∣TIDE; probably he then meant to write two more, descriptive of Morning and Evening. His unfinished Ode (vide p. 236 of the Memoirs) opens with a fine description of the former: and his Elegy with as beautiful a picture of the latter, which perhaps he might, at that time, have meditated upon for the exordium of an Ode; but this is only conjecture. It may, however, be remarked, that these three capital descriptions abound with ideas which affect the ear more than the eye; and therefore go beyond the powers of picturesque imitation.</P>

<P>1. This was the first English production of Mr. Gray which appeared in print. It was published in folio by Dodsley in 1747; about the same time, at Mr. Walpole's request, Mr. Gray sat for his picture to Echart, in which, on a paper which he held in his hand, Mr. Walpole wrote the title of this Ode, and to intimate his own high and just opinion of it, as a first pro∣duction, added this line of Lucan by way of motto.<Q><L>Nec licuit populis parvum te, Nile, videre.</L> <BIBL><HI>Phars. lib.</HI> x. <HI>l.</HI> 296.</BIBL></Q></P>

<P>The elision here is ungraceful and hurts this otherwise beautiful line: One of the same kind in the second line of the first Ode makes the same blemish; but I think they are the only two to be found in this correct writer; and I mention them here that succeeding Poets may not look upon them as authorities. The judicious reader will not suppose that I would condemn all elisions of the genitive case, by this stricture on those which are termi∣nated by rough consonants.

<P>Had Mr. Gray compleated the fine lyrical fragment, which I have inserted in the fourth section of the Memoirs, I should have introduced it into the text of his Poems, as the fifth and last of his monostrophic Odes. In order to fulfil the promise which I made to my reader, (see p. 235) I shall now reprint the piece with my own additions to it. I have already made my apology for the attempt; and therefore shall only add, that although (as is usually done on such occasions) I print my supplemental lines in the italic character, yet I am well aware that their inferiority would but too easily distinguish them without any typographical assistance.</P>

<P>DEI moltissimi obblighi, che io ho alla tanta fua gentilezza, non è certo il minore quello dello avermi ella novella∣mente introdotto in uno dè più riposti Laureti del Parnaso In∣glese, avendomi fatto parte di alcune Liriche poesie del Signor Gray. Io non saprei quale Oda non dirò del celebre Rousseau, ma del Guidi, del Lazzarini, ed anche del Chiabrera, che scrissèr o in una lingua più poetica che la Francese non è, paragonar si potesse all'Oda sopra l'Armonia, o a quella contro ad Odoardo Primo del loro novello Pindaro, ed Alceo.</P>
<P>La Poesia dei popoli settentrionali pare a me, che, general∣mènte parlando, consista più di pensieri, che d'immagini, si com∣piaccia delle riflessioni equalmente che dei sentimenti, non sia cosi particolareggiata, e pittoresca come è la nostra. Virgilio a cagione d'esempio rapprèsentando Didone quando esce alla cac∣cia fa una tal dèscrizione del suo vestimento, che tutti i ritrattisti, leggendo quel passo, la vestirebbono a un modo:<Q><PB N="83" REF="500"/>

<P>Non cosi il Miltono quando descrive la nuda bellezza di Eva;<Q><L><HI>Grace was in all her steps, heav'n in her eye,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In ev'ry gesture, dignity and love.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Con quella parole generali, e astratte idee di grazia, cielo, amore, e maestà non pare a lei che ognuno si formi in mente una Eva a posta sua? Talchè dietro a quei versi <HI>Rubens</HI> l'avrèbbe dipinta come una grossa Bàlia Fiamminga, <HI>Rassaello</HI> come la Venere dâ Medici, quale appunto, il Miltono l'avrèbbe dovuta descrivere. <Q><L><HI>Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And factions strive, who shall applaud him most.</HI></L></Q>Dice un loro famoso poeta se ben mi ricordo.

The Count might have found, in another part of the Paradise Lost, a description of this very Eve more particularized and picturesque; and two allegorical figures of Sin and Death, full as strongly featured as the Envy of Lazzarini. Spenser would, in almost every page of his Fairy Queen, have produced him pictures as boldly ima∣gined and peculiarly marked, as are to be met with in the writings of any more Southern Poet.</NOTE>. In fatti, se fu dato alla Grecia di produrre un Omero che è il principe dè poeti, fu dato all' Inghilterra il produrre un Neutono padre e sovrano della filosofica famiglia. Comunque sia di ciò l'una di queste Poesie chiamare si potrebbe logica, grafica l'altra. In questo secondo genere io porrei la poesia del Signor Gray, il quale benché nato verso il Polo, uguaglia i più caldi poeti, che sorsero più vicini al sole. Il <HI>verbum ardens</HI> di Cicerone, <HI>words that burn,</HI> che egli nella prima Oda adatta à Dryden, bene si può appropriare, per la vivacità della espressione, a lui medé∣simo: E cosi ancora quei, <HI>thoughts that breathe;</HI> del che egli è cortese all'istesso poeta.<Q><L><HI>From Helicon's harmonious springs</HI></L>

poetica la ragione ch'egli fabbrica della cecità del Miltono, il quale; oltrepassati i fiammanti confine dello spazio e del tempo, ebbe ardire di fissare lo sguardo colà dove gli angioli stessi pa∣ventano di rimirare; e gli occhi suoi affuocati in quel pelago di lucé si chiusero tosto in una notte sempiterna. Con qual bravura non ha egli imitato la grandiosa immagine di Pindaro nella prima delle Pitiche, quando dipinge il Re degli Augelli, l'Aquila ministra del fulmine di Giove vinta anch'essa dalla forza dell'armonia?

Troppo lungo io sarei se esprimer le volessi il piacere di che mi è stata cagione la varietà grandissima d'immagini ch'egli ha saputo fare entrare nel vaticinio che contro alla razza di Odoardo fulmina il Poeta Wallese.

<P>1. This highly-finished Ode, which Mr. Gray entitled the Progress of Poetry, describes its power and influence as well as progress, which his explanatory notes at the bottom of the page point out, and this with all the accuracy of metaphysical precision, disguised under the appearance of Pindaric digression. On the first line of it he gave, in his edition, the following note.—<Q REND="inline">"Pindar styles his own poetry, with its musical accompanyments, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: Aeolian song, Aeolian strings, the breath of the Aeolian flute."</Q> It will seem strange to the learned reader, that he thought such explanation necessary, and he will be apt to look on it as the mere parade of Greek quotation; but his reason for it was, that the Critical Reviewers had mistaken his meaning, (see note, p. 250 of the Me∣moirs) and supposed the Ode addressed to the Harp of Aeolus; which they said <Q REND="inline">"was altogether uncertain and irregular, and therefore must be very ill adapted to the <HI>Dance.</HI>"</Q> See Epode i. l. 1. This ridiculous blunder, which he did not think proper openly to advert on, led him to produce his Greek quotations, that they might chew on them at their leisure; but he would hardly have done this, had not the reception his Ode met with made him abate, not only of respect to his critics, but to his readers in general.

Milton is not more the pride than Shakespear the love of their country: It is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of Shakespear, as to extol in a strain more elevated and so∣norous the boundless soarings of Milton's epic imagination."</Q> The critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descrip∣tions; yet it is further to be observed, to the honor of our Poet's judgment, that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital perfections of Shakespear's genius; and when he describes his power of exciting terror (a species of the sublime) he ceases to be diffuse, and becomes, as he ought to be, concise and energetical.</P>

<P>This has been condemned as a false thought, and more worthy of an Italian Poet than of Mr. Gray. Count Algarotti, we have found in his letter to Mr. How, praises it highly; but as he was an Italian Critic, his judgment, in this point, will not, perhaps by many, be thought to overbalance the ob∣jection. The truth is, that this fiction of the cause of Milton's blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility, any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shakespear; and therefore would be equally admissable, had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known: on this account the judgment revolts against it.

so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect, in relation to matter of fact, all that the impartial critic can do, is to point out the reason, and to apologize for the Poet, who was necessitated by his subject to consider Milton only in his poetical capacity.</P>

<P>16. The Critic, above quoted, concludes his remarks on this Ode, which he had written after his observations on the Bard, in a manner which ac∣counts, in my opinion, for the superior pleasure that it has given to him, and also to the generality of readers. <Q REND="inline">"I quit, says he, this Ode with the strongest conviction of its abundant merit; though I took it up, (for this last attentive perusal) persuaded that it was not a little inferior to the other. They are not the treasures of imagination only that have so copi∣ously enriched it: It speaks, but surely less feelingly than the Bard, (still my favourite) to the heart. Can we in truth be equally interested, for the fabulous exploded Gods of other nations (celebrated in the first half

of this Ode) as by the story of our own Edwards and Henrys, or allusions to it? Can a description, the most perfect language ever attained to, of tyranny expelling the muses from Parnassus, seize the mind equally with the horrors of Berkley Castle, with the apostrophe to the tower?
<Q><L>And spare the meek Usurper's holy head!</L></Q>I do not mean, however, wholly to decry fabulous subjects or allusions, nor more than to suggest the preference due to historical ones, where happily the Poet's fertile imagination supplies him with a plentiful choice of both kinds, and he finds himself capable of treating both, according to their respective natures, with equal advantage."</Q></P>

<P>1. I promised the reader, in the 237th page of the Memoirs, to give him, in this place, the original argument of this capital Ode, as its author had set it down on one of the pages of his common-place book. It is as follows: <Q REND="inline">"The army of Edward I. as they march through a deep valley, are sud∣denly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the summit of an inaccessible rock, who, with a voice more than human, reproaches the King with all the misery and desolation which he had brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race, and with prophetic spirit declares, that all his cruelty shall never extinguish the noble ardour of poetic genius in this island; and that men shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valour in immortal strains, to expose vice and infamous pleasure, and boldly censure tyranny and oppression. His song ended, he precipitates himself from the mountain, and is swallowed up by the river that rolls at its foot."</Q> Fine as the conclusion of this Ode is at present, I think it would have been still finer, if he could have executed it according to this plan; but unhappily for his purpose, instances of English Poets were wanting. Spenser had that enchanting flow of verse which was peculiarly calculated <HI>to celebrate Virtue and Valour;</HI> but he chose to celebrate them, not literally, but in allegory. Shakespear, who had talents for every thing, was undoubtedly capable <HI>of exposing Vice and infamous Pleasure;</HI> and the drama was a proper vehicle for his satire: but we do not ever find that he professedly made this his object; nay, we know that, in one inimitable character, he has so contrived as to make vices of the worst kind, such as cowardice, drunkenness, dishonesty, and lewdness, not only laughable, but almost amiable; for with all these sins on his head, who can help liking

Falstaffe? Milton, of all our great Poets, was the only one <HI>who boldly censured Tyranny and Oppression:</HI> but he chose to deliver this censure, not in poetry, but in prose. Dryden was a mere court parasite to the most in∣famous of all courts. Pope, with all his laudable detestation of corruption and bribery, was a Tory; and Addison, though a Whig and a fine wri∣ter, was unluckily not enough of a Poet for his purpose. On these con∣siderations Mr. Gray was necessitated to change his plan towards the conclusion: Hence we perceive, that in the last epode he praises Spenser only <HI>for his allegory,</HI> Shakespear <HI>for his powers of moving the passions,</HI> and Milton <HI>for his epic excellence.</HI> I remember the Ode lay unfinished by him for a year or two on this very account; and I hardly believe that it would ever have had his last hand but for the circumstance of his hearing Parry play on the Welch Harp at a concert at Cambridge, (see Letter xxv. sect. iv.) which he often declared inspired him with the conclusion.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>2. Mr. Smith, the Musical Composer and worthy pupil of Mr. Handel, had once an idea of setting this Ode, and of having it performed by way of serenata or oratorio. A common friend of his and Mr. Gray's interested himself much in this design, and drew out a clear analysis of the Ode, that Mr. Smith might more perfectly understand the Poet's meaning. He con∣versed also with Mr. Gray on the subject, who gave him an idea for the overture, and marked also some passages in the Ode in order to ascertain which should be recitative, which air, what kind of air, and how accom∣panied. The design was, however, not executed; and therefore I shall only (in order to give the reader a taste of Mr. Gray's musical feelings) in∣sert in this place what his sentiments were concerning the overture. <Q REND="inline">"It should be so contrived as to be a proper introduction to the Ode; it might consist of two movements, the first descriptive of the horror and confusion of battle, the last a march grave and majestic, but expressing the exulta∣tion and insolent security of conquest. This movement should be com∣posed entirely of wind instruments, except the kettle-drum heard at inter∣vals. The <HI>da capo</HI> of it must be suddenly broke in upon, and put to silence by the clang of the harp in a tumultuous rapid movement, joined with the voice, all at once, and not ushered in by any symphony. The harmony may be strengthened by any other stringed instrument; but the harp should every where prevail, and form the continued running accom∣panyment, submitting itself to nothing but the voice."</Q></P>

<P>Mr. Gray never saw the large Cartoon, done by the same divine hand, in the possession of the Duke of Montagu, at his seat at Boughton in Northamp∣tonshire, else I am persuaded he would have mentioned it in this note. The two finished pictures abroad (which I believe are closet-pieces) can hardly have so much spirit in them as this wonderful drawing; it gave me the sublimest idea I ever received from painting. Moses breaking the tables of the law, by Parmegiano, was a figure which Mr. Gray used to say came still nearer to his meaning than the picture of Raphael.</P>

In the rest of this stanza the wildness of thought, expression, and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker, and of the bloody spectres his assistants. It is not indeed peculiar to it alone, but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition, that the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances, in which the Poet's office of rather exciting and directing, than satisfying the reader's imagination, is perfectly observed. Such abrupt hints, resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin, suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch, by one image of horror, but that instantaneously a second and a third are presented to it, and the affection is still uniformly supported. <BIBL>Anon.

<P>It is always entertaining, and sometimes useful, to be informed how a writer frequently improves on his original thoughts; on this account I have occa∣sionally set down the few variations which Mr. Gray made in his lyrical compositions. The six lines before us convey, perhaps, the most beautiful piece of imagery in the whole Ode, and were a wonderful improvement on those which he first wrote; which, though they would appear fine in an inferior Poet, are infinitely below those which supplanted them. I find them in one of his corrected manuscripts as follow.</P>

<P>This Stanza (as an ingenious friend remarks) has exceeding merit. It breathes in a lesser compass, what the Ode breathes at large, the high spirit of lyric Enthusiasm. The Transitions are sudden, and impetuous; the Language full of fire and force; and the Imagery carried, without impropriety, to the most daring height. The manner of Richard's death by Famine exhibits such beauties of Personification, as only the richest and most vivid Imagi∣nation could supply. From thence we are hurried, with the wildest rapidity, into the midst of Battle; and the epithet <HI>kindred</HI> places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrours of civil War. Immediately, by a transition most striking and unexpected, the Poet falls into a tender and pathetic Ad∣dress; which, from the sentiments and also from the numbers, has all the melancholy flow, and breathes all the plaintive softness, of Elegy. Again the Scene changes; again the Bard rises into an allegorical description of Carnage, to which the metre is admirably adapted: and the concluding Sentence of personal punishment on Edward is denounced with a Solemnity, that chills and terrifies.</P>

<P>15. I cannot quit this and the preceding Ode, without saying a word or two of my own concerning the obscurity which has been imputed to them, and the preference which, in consequence, has been given to his Elegy. It seems as if the persons, who hold this opinion, suppose that every species of Poetry ought to be equally clear and intelligible: than which position no∣thing can be more repugnant to the several specific natures of composition, and to the practice of antient art. Not to take Pindar and his Odes for an example, (though what I am here defending were written professedly in imi∣tation of him) I would ask, Are all the writings of Horace, his Epistles, Satires, and Odes equally perspicuous? Amongst his Odes, separately con∣sidered, are there not remarkable differences of this very kind? Is the spirit and meaning of that which begins, <Q REND="inline">"Descende coelo, &amp; dic, age, tibiâ", <BIBL>Ode 4. lib. 3.</BIBL></Q> so readily comprehended as <Q REND="inline">"Persicos odi, puer, apparatus," <BIBL>Ode 38. l. 1.</BIBL></Q> And is the latter a finer piece of lyrical composition on that account? Is <Q REND="inline">"Integer vitae, sceleris{que} purus," <BIBL>Ode 22. l. 1.</BIBL></Q> superior to <Q REND="inline">"Pindarum quisquis studet aemulari," <BIBL>Ode 2. l. 4.</BIBL></Q> because it may be un∣derstood at the first reading, and the latter not without much study and reflec∣tion? Now between these Odes, thus compared, there is surely equal diffe∣rence in point of perspicuity, as between the Progress of Poesy, and the Prospect of Eton; the Ode on the Spring, and the Bard: But, say these objectors, <Q REND="inline">"The end of Poetry is universally to please. Obscurity, by ta∣king off from our pleasure, destroys that end."</Q> I will grant that, if the obscurity be great, constant, and unsurmountable, this is certainly true; but if it be only found in particular passages, proceeding from the nature of the subject and the very genius of the composition, it does not rob us of our pleasure, but superadds a new one which arises from conquering a difficulty;
<PB N="97" REF="516"/>
and the pleasure which accrues from a difficult passage when well understood, provided the passage itself be a fine one, is always more permanent than that which we discover at the first glance. The lyric Muse, like other fine Ladies, requires to be courted, and retains her admirers the longer for not having yielded too readily to their solicitations. This argument ending as it does in a sort of simile will, I am persuaded, not only have its force with the intelligent readers (the ΣΥΝΕΤΟΙ), but also with the men of fashion; as to critics of a lower class, it may be sufficient to transcribe, for their improve∣ment, an unfinished remark, or rather maxim, which I found amongst our Author's papers; and which he probably wrote on occasion of the common preference given to his Elegy. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Gout de Comparaison</HI> (as Bruyere styles it) is the only taste of ordinary minds. They do not know the specific excellency either of an author or a composition: for instance, they do not know that Tibullus spoke the language of Nature and Love; that Horace saw the vanities and follies of mankind with the most penetrating eye, and touched them to the quick; that Virgil ennobled even the most com∣mon images by the graces of a glowing, melodious, and well-adapted expression; but they do know that Virgil was a better poet than Horace; and that Horace's Epistles do not run so well as the Elegies of Tibullus."</Q></P>

<HEAD>ODE VII.</HEAD>
<P>This Ode, to which, on the title, I have given the epithet of IRREGULAR, is the only one of the kind which Mr. Gray ever wrote; and its being written occasionally, and for music, is a sufficient apology for the defect. Exclu∣sive of this, (for a defect it certainly is) it appears to me, in point of lyrical arrangement and expression, to be equal to most of his other Odes. It is remarkable that, amongst the many irregular Odes which have been written in our own language, Dryden's and Pope's, on St. Cecilia's Day, are the only ones that may properly be said to have lived. The reason is (as I have hinted in a note, p. 233 of the Memoirs) that this mode of composition is so extremely easy, that it gives the writer an opening to every kind of poetical licentiousness: whereas the regularly repeated stanza, and still more the regular succession of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, put so strong a curb on the wayward imagination, that when she has once paced in it,
<PB N="98" REF="517"/>
she seldom chooses to submit to it a second time. 'Tis therefore greatly to be wished, in order to stifle in their birth a quantity of compositions, which are at the same time wild and jejune, that regular Odes, and these only, should be deemed legitimate amongst us.</P>
<P>The Cambridge edition (published at the expence of the University) is here followed; but I have added at the bottom of the page a number of explana∣tory notes, which this Ode seemed to want, still more than that which pre∣ceded it, especially when given not to the University only, but the Public in general, who may be reasonably supposed to know little of the particular founders of different Colleges and their history here alluded to. For the sake of uniformity in the page, I have divided the Ode into stanzas, and discarded the musical divisions of Recitative, Air, and Chorus; but shall here insert them in their order, according as the different stanzas were set by Dr. Randal, Professor of Music.</P>

<P>Odin, we find both from this Ode and the Edda, was solicitous about the fate of his son Balder, who had dreamed he was soon to die. The Edda men∣tions the manner of his death when killed by Odin's other son Hoder; and also that Hoder was himself slain afterwards by Vali the son of Odin and Rinda, consonant with this prophecy.</P>

<L>Prophetess, &amp;c.</L><BIBL><HI>L.</HI> 51.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Women were looked upon by the Gothic nations as having a peculiar insight into futurity; and some there were that made profession of magic arts and divination. These travelled round the country, and were received in every house with great respect and honour. Such a woman bore the name of Volva Seidkona or Spakona. The dress of Thorbiorga, one of these pro∣phetesses, is described at large in Eirick's Rauda Sogu, (apud Bartholin. lib. i. cap. iv. p. 688.) She had on a blue vest spangled all over with stones, a necklace of glass beads, and a cap made of the skin of a black lamb lined with white cat-skin. She leaned on a staff adorned with brass, with a round head set with stones; and was girt with a Hunlandish belt, at which hung her pouch full of magical instruments. Her buskins were of rough calf-skin, bound on with thongs studded with knobs of brass, and her gloves of white cat-skin, the fur turned inwards, &amp;c. G.</P>
<P>They were also called <HI>Fiolkyngi,</HI> or <HI>Fiol-kunnug;</HI> i. e. Multi-scia: and <HI>Visinda∣kona;</HI> i. e. Oraculorum Mulier, <HI>Nornir;</HI> i. e. Parcae. G.</P>

<P>These were probably the Nornir or Parcae, just now mentioned: their names were Urda, Verdandi, and Skulda; they were the dispensers of good desti∣nies. As their names signify Time past, present, and future, it is probable they were always invisible to mortals: therefore when Odin asks this que∣stion on seeing them, he betrays himself to be a God; which elucidates the next speech of the Prophetess.</P>

<P>In the Latin <Q REND="inline">"Mater trium Gigantum."</Q> He means, therefore, probably Anger∣bode, who, from her name, seems to be <Q REND="inline">"no Prophetess of good,"</Q> and who bore to Loke, as the Edda says, three children; the Wolf Fenris, the great Serpent of Midgard, and Hela, all of them called Giants in that wild but curious system of mythology; with which, if the reader wishes to be ac∣quainted, he had better consult the translation of M. Mallet's Introduction to the History of Denmark, than the original itself, as some mistakes of con∣sequence are corrected by the translator.

<HEAD>ODE X.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Gray entitles this Ode, in his own edition, a FRAGMENT; but from the prose version of Mr. Evans, which I shall here insert, it will appear that nothing is omitted, except a single hyperbole at the end, which I print in italics.</P>
<P>Panegyric upon Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North-Wales, by Gwalchmai, the son of Melir, in the year 1157.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Evan's Specimen of Welch Poetry, p. 25, and for the original Welch, p. 127.</NOTE></P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>1. I will extol the generous Hero, descended from the race of Roderic, the bulwark of his country; a prince eminent for his good qualities, the glory of Britain, Owen the brave and expert in arms, a Prince that neither hoard∣eth nor coveteth riches.</P>

<P>2. Three fleets arrived, vessels of the main; three powerful fleets of the first rate, furiously to attack him on the sudden: one from Jwerddon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ireland.</NOTE>, the other full of well-armed Lochlynians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Danes and Normans.</NOTE>, making a grand appearance on the floods, the third from the transmarine Normans, which was attended with an im∣mense, though successless toil.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>3. The Dragon of Mona's Sons was so brave in action, that there was a great tumult on their furious attack; and before the Prince himself there was vast confusion, havoc, conflict, honourable death, bloody battle, horrible con∣sternation, and upon Tal Malvre a thousand banners; there was an out∣rageous carnage, and the rage of spears and hasty signs of violent indigna∣tion. Blood raised the tide of the Menäi, and the crimson of human gore stained the brine. There were glittering cuirasses, and the agony of gashing wounds, and the mangled warriors prostrate before the chief, distinguished by his crimson lance. Lloegria was put into confusion; the contest and confusion was great; <HI>and the glory of our Prince's wide-wasting sword shall be celebrated in an hundred languages to give him his merited praise.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ODE XI.</HEAD>
<P>From the extract of the Gododin, which Mr. Evans has given us in his <Q REND="inline">"Dissertatio de Bardis"</Q> in the forementioned book, I shall here transcribe those particular passages which Mr. Gray selected for imitation in this Ode.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">

<L>Et egomet ipse (scilicet Bardus Aneurinus) sanguine rubens:</L>
<L>Aliter ad hoc Carmen compingendum non superstes fuissem.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whoever compares Mr. Gray's poetical versions of these four lyrical pieces, with the literal translations which I have here inserted, will, I am persuaded, be convinced that nothing of the kind was ever executed with more fire, and at the same time, more judgment. He keeps up through them all the wild romantic spirit of his originals; elevates them by some well-chosen epithet or image where they flag, yet in such a manner as is perfectly con∣gruous with the general idea of the poems; and if he either varies or omits any of the original thoughts, they are only of that kind which, according to our modern sentiments, would appear vulgar or ludicrous: two instances of this kind occur in the latter part of this last Ode. How well has he turned the idea of the fourth line: <Q REND="inline">"Ex iis qui nimio potu madidi?"</Q> and the conclusion, <Q REND="inline">"Aliter ad hoc Carmen compingendum, &amp;c."</Q> The former of which is ridiculous; the latter insipid.</P>

<P>4. I find amongst Mr. Gray's papers, a few more lines taken from other parts of the Gododin, which I shall here add with their respective Latin versions.

<P>1. If what Boileau says be true in his <Q REND="inline">"Art Poetique,"</Q> that <Q>Un Sonnet sans defauts vaut seul un long Poeme—</Q>the merit of this little Poem is decided.

<HEAD>ELEGY, written in a Country Church-yard.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>1. The most popular of all our Author's publications; it ran through eleven editions in a very short space of time; was finely translated into Latin by Messrs. Ansty and Roberts; and in the same year another, though I think inferior, version of it was published by Mr. Lloyd. The reader has been informed, in the Memoirs, of the time and manner of its first publication. He originally gave it only the simple title of <Q REND="inline">"Stanzas written in a Country Church-yard."</Q> I persuaded him first to call it an ELEGY, because the sub∣ject authorized him so to do; and the alternate measure, in which it was written, seemed peculiarly fit for that species of composition. I imagined too that so capital a Poem, written in this measure, would as it were ap∣propriate it in future to writings of this sort; and the number of imitations which have since been made of it (even to satiety) seem to prove that my notion was well founded. In the first manuscript copy of this exquisite Poem, I find the conclusion different from that which he afterwards compo∣sed; and tho' his after-thought was unquestionably the best, yet there is a pathetic melancholy in the four rejected stanzas, which highly claims pre∣servation. I shall therefore give them as a variation in their proper place.</P>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thou, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead,</L>

<P>Thus it stood in the first and some following editions, and I think rather better; for the authority of Petrarch does not destroy the appearance of quaintness in the other: the thought however is rather obscurely expressed in both readings. He means to say, in plain prose, that we wish to be remembered by our friends after our death, in the same manner as when alive we wished to be remembered by them in our absence: this would be expressed clearer, if the metaphorical term <HI>fires</HI> was rejected, and the line ran thus:

<P>I rather wonder that he rejected this stanza, as it not only has the same sort of Doric delicacy, which charms us peculiarly in this part of the Poem, but also compleats the account of his whole day: whereas, this Evening seene being omitted, we have only his Morning walk, and his Noon-tide repose.</P>
