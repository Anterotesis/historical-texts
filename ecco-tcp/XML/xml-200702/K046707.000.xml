<HEAD>To Her ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCESS of <HI>WALES,</HI> With the Tragedy of <HI>CATO. Nov.</HI> 1714.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Muse that oft, with sacred Raptures fired,</L>
<L>Has gen'rous Thoughts of Liberty inspired,</L>
<L>And, boldly rising for <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Laws,</L>
<L>Engaged great <HI>Cato</HI> in her Country's Cause,</L>
<L>On You submissive waits, with Hopes assured,</L>
<L>By whom the mighty Blessing stands secured,</L>
<L>And all the Glories, that our Age adorn,</L>
<L>Are promis'd to a People yet unborn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer shall the widow'd Land bemoan</L>
<L>A broken Lineage, and a doubtful Throne;</L>
<L>But boast her Royal Progeny's Increase,</L>
<L>And count the Pledges of her future Peace.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
O Born to strengthen and to grace our Isle!</L>
<L>While You, fair PRINCESS, in your Off-spring smile</L>
<L>Supplying Charms to the succeeding Age,</L>
<L>Each Heav'nly Daughter's Triumphs we presage;</L>
<L>Already see th' Illustrious Youths complain,</L>
<L>And pity Monarchs doom'd to sigh in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou too, the Darling of our fond Desires,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Albion,</HI> opening wide her Arms, requires,</L>
<L>With manly Valour and attractive Air</L>
<L>Shalt quell the Fierce, and captivate the Fair,</L>
<L>O <HI>England</HI>'s younger Hope! in whom conspire</L>
<L>The Mother's Sweetness, and the Father's Fire!</L>
<L>For Thee perhaps, ev'n Now, of Kingly Race</L>
<L>Some dawning Beauty bloom's in ev'ry Grace,</L>
<L>Some CAROLINA, to Heav'n's Dictates true,</L>
<L>Who, while the Scepter'd Rivals vainly sue,</L>
<L>Thy inborn Worth with conscious Eyes shall see,</L>
<L>And slight th' Imperial Diadem for Thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd with the Prospect of successive Reigns,</L>
<L>The tuneful Tribe no more in daring Strains</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Shall vindicate, with pious Fears opprest,</L>
<L>Endanger'd Rights, and Liberty Distrest:</L>
<L>To milder Sounds each Muse shall tune the Lyre,</L>
<L>And Gratitude, and Faith to Kings inspire,</L>
<L>And Filial Love; bid impious Discord cease,</L>
<L>And sooth the madding Factions into Peace;</L>
<L>Or rise Ambitious in more lofty Lays,</L>
<L>And teach the Nation their new Monarch's Praise,</L>
<L>Describe his awful Look, and Godlike Mind,</L>
<L>And <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Pow'r with <HI>Cato</HI>'s Vertue join'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean-while, Bright PRINCESS, who, with graceful Ease</L>
<L>And native Majesty, are form'd to please,</L>
<L>Behold those Arts with a propitious Eye,</L>
<L>That suppliant to their great Protectress fly!</L>
<L>Then shall they Triumph, and the <HI>British</HI> Stage</L>
<L>Improve her Manners, and refine her Rage,</L>
<L>More noble Characters expose to view,</L>
<L>And draw her finisht Heroines from You.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor You the kind Indulgence will refuse,</L>
<L>Skill'd in the Labours of the deathless Muse:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
The deathless Muse with undiminisht Rays</L>
<L>Through distant Times the lovely Dame conveys.</L>
<L>To GLORIANA <HI>Waller</HI>'s Harp was strung;</L>
<L>The Queen still shines, because the Poet sung.</L>
<L>Ev'n all those Graces, in your Frame combin'd,</L>
<L>The common Fate of Mortal Charms may find;</L>
<L>(Content Our short-liv'd Praises to engage,</L>
<L>The Joy and Wonder of a Single Age,)</L>
<L>Unless some Poet in a lasting Song</L>
<L>To late Posterity their Fame prolong,</L>
<L>Instruct our Sons the radiant Form to prize,</L>
<L>And see Your Beauty with their Fathers' Eyes.</L>

<HEAD>TO Sir <HI>GODFREY KNELLER,</HI> ON HIS PICTURE of the KING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>KNELLER,</HI> with silence and surprize</L>
<L>We see <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Monarch rise,</L>
<L>A Godlike Form, by Thee display'd</L>
<L>In all the force of Light and Shade;</L>
<L>And, Aw'd by thy delusive Hand,</L>
<L>As in the Presence-chamber stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Magick of thy Art calls forth</L>
<L>His Secret Soul and Hidden Worth,</L>
<L>His Probity and Mildness shows,</L>
<L>His Care of Friends, and Scorn of Foes:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
In ev'ry Stroke, in ev'ry Line,</L>
<L>Does some exalted Vertue shine,</L>
<L>And <HI>Albion</HI>'s Happiness we trace</L>
<L>Through all the Features of his Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O may I live to hail the Day,</L>
<L>When the glad Nation shall survey</L>
<L>Their Sov'reign, through his wide Command,</L>
<L>Passing in Progress o'er the Land!</L>
<L>Each Heart shall bend, and ev'ry Voice</L>
<L>In loud applauding Shouts rejoice,</L>
<L>Whilst All his Gracious Aspect praise,</L>
<L>And Crowds grow Loyal as they Gaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Image on the Medal place'd,</L>
<L>With its Bright Round of Titles grace'd,</L>
<L>And Stamp'd on <HI>British</HI> Coins shall Live;</L>
<L>To Richest Ores the Value give,</L>
<L>Or, wrought within the Curious Mould,</L>
<L>Shape and adorn the Running Gold.</L>
<L>To bear this Form, the Genial Sun</L>
<L>Has daily, since his Course begun,</L>
<L>Rejoice'd the Metal to Refine,</L>
<L>And Ripen'd the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mine.</L>

<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<L>Thou, <HI>Kneller,</HI> long with noble Pride</L>
<L>(The Foremost of thy Art) ha'st vied</L>
<L>With Nature in a gen'rous Strife,</L>
<L>And touch'd the Canvas into Life.</L>
<L>Thy Pencil has, by Monarchs sought,</L>
<L>From Reign to Reign in Ermine wrought,</L>
<L>And, in their Robes of State array'd,</L>
<L>The Kings of half an Age display'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>Here swarthy <HI>Charles</HI> appears, and there</L>
<L>His Brother with Dejected Air;</L>
<L>Triumphant <HI>Nassau</HI> here we find,</L>

<L>There <HI>Anna,</HI> Great as when she sent</L>
<L>Her Armies through the Continent,</L>
<L>E'er yet her Hero was disgrac't:</L>
<L>O may fam'd BRUNSWICK be the Last,</L>
<L>(Though Heav'n shou'd with my Wish agree,</L>
<L>And long preserve thy Art in Thee)</L>
<L>The Last, the Happiest <HI>British</HI> King,</L>
<L>Whom Thou shalt paint, or I shall sing!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wise <HI>Phidias,</HI> thus his Skill to prove,</L>
<L>Through many a God advanc'd to <HI>Jove,</HI></L>

And taught the polish'd Rocks to shine</L>
<L>With Airs and Lineaments divine;</L>
<L>Till <HI>Greece,</HI> amaz'd, and half-afraid,</L>
<L>Th' Assembled Deities survey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>Pan,</HI> who wont to chase the Fair,</L>
<L>And lov'd the spreading Oak, was there;</L>
<L>Old <HI>Saturn</HI> too with up-cast Eyes</L>
<L>Beheld his Abdicated Skies;</L>
<L>And mighty <HI>Mars,</HI> for War renown'd,</L>
<L>In Adamantine Armour frown'd;</L>
<L>By Him the childless Goddess rose,</L>
<L><HI>Minerva,</HI> studious to compose</L>
<L>Her twisted Threads; the Webb she strung,</L>
<L>And o'er a Loom of Marble hung:</L>
<L><HI>Thetis</HI> the troubled Ocean's Queen,</L>
<L>Match'd with a Mortal, next was seen</L>
<L>(Reclining on a Fun'ral Urn)</L>
<L>Her short-liv'd Darling Son to Mourn.</L>
<L>The Last was He, whose Thunder slew</L>
<L>The <HI>Titan</HI>-race, a Rebel Crew,</L>
<L>That from a Hundred Hills, allie'd</L>
<L>In impious Leagues, their King defie'd.</L>

<L>This Wonder of the Sculptor's Hand</L>
<L>Produc'd, his Art was at a stand:</L>
<L>For who wou'd hope New Fame to raise,</L>

<L>That, his high Genius to approve,</L>
<L>Had drawn a <HI>GEORGE,</HI> or carv'd a <HI>Jove!</HI></L>
