<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not without apply∣ing the proper Medicine <HI>I</HI> grant ye.—Well, had I such a Confessor as Father <HI>Bernardo—</HI>I say no more—but I sancy nothing wou'd trouble my Conscience long.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<L>What do you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inis.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Meaning depends upon yours, Ma∣dam; pray what do you mean by painting Farther <HI>Bernardo</HI>'s Picture in every Room in the House, at your Beds-head, your Toilet, at the Bottom of your Crucifix, at every Cor∣ner of your Handkerchief, nay upon your ve∣ry Fan too, as if the Good Father, like the Traveller in the Fable, cou'd heat and cool at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any harm in wearing a good Man's Picture? Is he not one of the Pillars of our Church? Eminent for de claiming against Herisy and Schism, and fain wou'd reconcile the World to <HI>Rome</HI> s pure Religion? Oh they are blest that he Converts, happy the Pair, who e'er they be, that are in Wedlock joyn'd by him. Wou'd I had been one of those.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inis.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Good Father has this healing Art, Why are you uneasy? A little of his comfortable Consolation wou'd revive the Co∣lour in those Cheeks, and give great Satis∣faction to your Mind, or I have lost my Judg∣ment, and I don't use to be out in my Guess, where Love's the Riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since thou hast hit my Distem∣per so exactly, Girl, I'll confess ingeniously to thee, I do love Father <HI>Bernardo</HI> to Distra∣ction, but how to discover my Passion, or what Reception it may meet with when dis∣cover'd, is that which wracks me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Inis.</SPEAKER>
<P>A kind one I warrant you, Madam: For tho' Priests are forbid to marry, as a mortal Sin, Fornication was never reckon'd
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
more than Venial; and for Discovery, whilst there's Pen, Ink, and Paper in the World, a Woman can never be at a loss to tell her Mind. Write to him Madam, write to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who shall carry it?</P>
