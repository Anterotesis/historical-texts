<HEAD>ADVICE
TO THE
PEOPLE
OF
<HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE PUBLICK PEACE
is justly the concern of every
true lover of his Country, the
Warmth and Fire that ap∣pears
on every side in its turn, and
Prompts us to fall in upon one another,
with Resentment for Miscarriages, ra∣ther
than Caution against them, may be
justly suspected to proceed more from
private and narrow Views, than from
that generous and broad hearted princi∣ple
of Love to a Country which every
Man would be distinguish'd by, but
which so few Understand.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
No Man can be said to pursue the
true interest of his Country, but he that
makes it the utmost End of all his Mea∣sures
to restore and establish the PUB∣LICK
PEACE; This alone makes a
Nation Great, Rich, Powerful, and Hap∣py.
Without Peace the World is a rag∣ing
<HI>Bedlam,</HI> where every (<HI>Lunatick</HI>) In∣habitant
is separated from the rest to pre∣vent
them Devouring and Destroying one
another; A great Forrest where the Inha∣bitants
are all Beasts of Prey, watching
to tear one another to Pieces, the stron∣ger
Hunting after the Weaker, the
Greater falling upon the Less.</P>
<P>Peace is the End of Society, the Rea∣son
of Government, the Consequence of
Laws, and the Felicity of Life.</P>
<P>By PEACE here I am to be under∣stood
to be speaking of the Civil Peace;
Peace at home, (<HI>viz.</HI>) with our Rulers,
and with our selves; and I make the
Distinction here, because I shall industri∣ously
avoid entring into that Part which
has occasioned so much the Breach of our
Peace <HI>at home</HI> for some time past, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Peace</HI> as it relates to War, Alliances, Trea∣ties,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with our Neighbours abroad.</P>
<P>We have been miserably divided a∣mong
our selves for some time. The Feud
which began in the Court has spread it
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
self thro' the whole Nation, and has so
Universally prevail'd, that it has been
next to impossible for any Man, private
or publick, but much less the latter, to
live and call himself a NEUTER:
The Breach at Court in the displacing
the Ministry, tho' it was not the first of
the Fire, yet it was the first of the
Flame. The HOUSE, (<HI>Nation</HI>) was
on Fire before, in the secret Discontents
and Uneasinesses that possess'd the
Parties one against another, and which
shew'd it self upon every Occasion; but
it was not broken out till the displacing
the Ministry, and dissolving the Parlia∣ment
in 1710. Then it was a perfect
Flame, which burnt out to the terror of
all good Men who wish'd well to their
Country; burning up all our National
Peace, embarking the whole Kingdom in
the Disorder, and threatning to leave us a
prey to the first Enemy that had Hands
to lay hold on us.</P>
<P>The Parties who bandied the Nation
against it self, and by whose Rage our
Ruin was so near, may without making
use of the invidious Names given to one
another, be thus distinguished. (1.) <HI>The
People displaced,</HI> who to make themselves
popular, decry'd the Persons and Mea∣sures
of those who had displac'd them,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
suggesting the Ruin of the Constitution,
Invasion of Liberty, and overthrow of
the Protestant Succession, in favour of
the Pretender. (2.) The People in Place,
who to confirm themselves, vindicated
their displacing the other, by suggest∣ing
Male-Administration, selfish De∣signs,
and corrupt Practices to the De∣triment
of the Nation, ruining the People
by the length of the War, and deny∣ing
them necessary Peace, on pretence of
obtaining it at last with more Advan∣tages
by the Continuance of the War.</P>
<P>I hope it will not be expected I should
enter here into the Merits of the re∣spective
Pretensions, and so make this
Tract which is designed for the closing
these Breaches, be a Declaration of the
carrying them farther on, taking on me
a Power of judging and censuring either
one side or other; this is no part of a Re∣conciler,
which is my Province at this
time; I shall therefore only draw two Ob∣servations
from the brief Account given
above of our late Divisions, which I leave
to the Reflection of those who have
been concerned.</P>
<P>1. That the <HI>Old Party</HI> would never
have stood out so long, had they believed
the <HI>New,</HI> would have been able to have
maintained themselves so firmly against
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the Vigorous and Powerful Attacks they
were to meet with.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>New Party</HI> would not have
done many things which they were ob∣liged
to do, nor have made use of many
of those Hands which at last they were
obliged to make use of, if the <HI>Old</HI> had
not stood out so obstinately, and so long.</P>
<P>By these two unhappy Incidents, the
Party War among us was both Spun out
to a greater Length, and blown up to a
greater Flame than either side at first fore∣saw,
or as I believe intended; till it
came to that highth that it began to be
the Opinion of serious and judicious Men
on both Sides, that it could never be
made up, that the Parties could never
part without Blows, and that it must in
a short time involve us in Confusion and
Blood.</P>
<P>But the Issue as well in what is seen,
as in what was but just appearing, has
shewn us that things were not quite so bad
as we feared; and that there were yet a
Body of Men, even in the new Ministry,
<HI>and at the Head of it too,</HI> who tho' they made
use of Instruments for their Convenience,
yet saw with other Eyes than those In∣struments
saw with, and pursued other
Ends than they pursued.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted but there was a
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Party of Men who were secretly inclin'd
to propagate the Interest of the Preten∣der
tho' they put on a different Face in
all their Transactions; these foolishly,
and very weakly, flattering themselves
that they should find an Opportunity to
turn up their own Card Trump, joined
themselves with the Party who were up∣permost,
and as they thought for that
Reason strongest.</P>
<P>Two things were to be observed of
these Mens Conduct all the while they
were playing this Game (<HI>viz.</HI>) that (1.)
They were willing to precipitate the
publick Affairs into all the warm and
extravagant Hights they could lest the
displac'd Party, finding room to hope well
of moderate Measures, should think of
reconciling themselves to the Ministry,
and coming in. (2.) They secretly in∣flam'd
the said displac'd Party against the
Ministry, and propagated every secret step
that might alarm them, that as they might
be more averse to a Reconciliation on
one Hand, so the Ministry might be pro∣vok'd
on the other, not to hearken any
more to Accommodations.</P>
<P>Thus the secret Party had acted till
they thought their Game so sure, and
their Interest so strong, that they could
overmatch any Man who they had the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
least Reason to suspect would oppose
them, and aiming at no less than the
Prime Ministry, they resolved either to
bring it into their own Hands, or if not,
then to bring it into their own Manage∣ment.</P>
<P>The
End which these men aim'd at, as
before they sound Impracticable as things
stood; the Person who possess'd the Power
of Prime Minister, having views quite dif∣ferent
from theirs, and which they were
indeed penetrating enough to see would
at last overthrow them.</P>
<P>Their next step then was to make him
uneasy, and to render him suspected; re∣proaching
him with being a Presbyterian
in his Heart, inclin'd to the Whigs, and ha∣ving
taken secret Measures to betray
them all to a new Scheme of Moderati∣on;
to erect a third Party between the Ex∣treams
of the other two, and so to lay
them wholly aside.</P>
<P>This part they carry'd on with more
Success than they at first expected; for
the Prime Minister, tho' he form'd no
middle Party as they alleag'd, yet
seeing evidently that they drove on at
a rate that would certainly plunge
the Queen, not only into Breaches with
her Neighbours, but with her own Sub∣jects;
Also that they had views fatal to
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the publick Peace, and founded also up∣on
impracticable Schemes which must
necessarily ruin themselves; I say, seeing
this was the Case, after in vain endea∣vouring
to keep them within the bounds
of Reason, and Duty to their Country
and themselves; and after having long
born the scandal of their Measures, and
been reproach'd in Publick, as if he had
been the Actor of what he so often, and so
constantly opposed, he gradually declin∣ed
them, yielded to the Importunities of
the Times, left them to try their own
Wisdom, and at last drew entirely out
of the Management.</P>
<P>It was not three Days that these Men
stood by themselves, but they appeared
to be unequal to the weight they had ta∣ken
upon them, and that they were no
more capable to guide the State without
that able Head they had parted from,
than he was able by his Wisdom and
Authority to Guide them, and keep them
within those moderate Measures of Go∣vernment
which alone could preserve
them. The weakness discovered it self
so far that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their new Model
immediately fell asunder, and every one
setting up for themselves, they began to
fall into that Confusion that was foretold
them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
This step of the Prime Minister was
infinitely to his Advantage, in that it re∣stored
him to the Opinion of some ho∣nest
Men who had been prepossess'd
against him for those Steps which it was
now apparent were the Produce of a se∣cret
Faction who topt upon the Mini∣stry;
and who as it now evidently ap∣peared
were in an Interest that no ho∣nest
Man could longer join with. It was
also advantageous to the Publick, that
this secret History might come to light,
and that the Mischiefs these hot Men
were likely to bring upon us, might be
prevented.</P>
<P>In this Posture Affairs stood when
Heaven took the Work into its own
Hand, and the Queen who was not a lit∣tle
touch'd with the Folly and Heat of
these Men, had taken her first step con∣trary
to their Measures, and given the
Treasury from them, was struck with
Death to the unspeakable Grief of all her
faithful Subjects, who albeit our Divisi∣ons
had lessened the common Charity of
the People one towards another, had yet
a profound Veneration, and an unfeign'd
Duty and Affection to her Person, ha∣ving
been brought to it by the most
engaging, inoffensive, tender and af∣fectionate
Treatment of all her Subjects,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
without Distinction, the most exemplary
Life, steady Piety, and Beneficent mer∣ciful
Reign of any Soveraign that ever sat
upon the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>When the Queen was Dead, the im∣mediate
thing that presented was the
LAW. By this the Successor to the
Crown, and the Duty of the Ministers of
State were so experesly laid down, the Per∣sons
who were to assume the Regency ap∣pointed,
and the severe Penalty to be
inflicted on the least Neglect so set forth;
that no secret Designs of any Men, or
Party of Men could possibly prevent the
Protestant Succession taking Place.</P>
<P>This it must be confessed has confirm'd
the Opinion of those who before these
Things happened, professed themselves
satisfy'd in the Security of the Parliamen∣tary
Provision for the Succession, and
were therefore not so apprehensive of the
Danger of the Pretender as others were,
who yet were sincerely in the Interest
of the Protestant Succession; I am no
more making this Tract a Defence of one
Party, than an Accusation of the other:
It has not been equally the Opinion of all
those who were really out of the Mea∣sures
of the Ministry, that they were Fa∣vourers
of the Pretender; and much
might be said to prove they must have
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
been Masters of very indifferent Politicks,
if they had any such Thoughts. It is
now out of the Question; the Event
proves it otherwise; and those Jacobites
who entertained Hopes of such a Thing,
discover that they little weigh'd the Na∣ture
of the Settlement it self, which was
such, that the greatest Friend to the House
of <HI>Hanover</HI> scarce knew what to Devise
for their farther Security, except the
placing some of the Family here, which
they found was not practicable on seve∣ral
Accounts.</P>
<P>Having premised these things only to
make Room for what Follows, I begin
upon this reconciling Foundation. The
Protestant Succession, and the Doubts
and Fears concerning it, or concerning
who was for or against it, being then at
an End by the Successor's being volunta∣rily
and freely put into actual Possession,
(for the King tho' not yet present in his
proper Person, is yet in an actual and
legal Possession of the Crown.) This I
say being done, and being done even by
those very Persons whom we have so often
charged with being for the Preten∣der,
what then remains but that we cease
that foolish strife, forget the Wrongs
done to one another, and bury the Re∣sentment
of past Follies in the Joy of the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
present Establishment, joining together
upon a disintressed Principle, to cultivate
our own Advantages.</P>
<P>This is our only present Security; if we
may be perswaded to this, we may pre∣serve
the Possession of the Crown to the
Protestant Race of <HI>Hanover,</HI> against all
the World; if not, if we will divide
into Factions and Parties, and be still tear∣ing
one another to Pieces, the most Con∣temptible
of all Pretenders may give us
trouble, the constant Fears of it uneasi∣ness,
and the least Attempt from abroad
overcome and confound us.</P>
<P>It is hard to say what is now left for us
to Quarrel at: <HI>Mark such as sow Divisions.</HI>
If any Man now would open Wounds,
and revive Party Dissentions, what can
it be for, but to carry on a narrow Prin∣ciple,
a private Interest, and make a
Gain of the Ruin of his Country?</P>
<P>The Succession is secured, and in that
our whole Demands are secured: In a
Protestant King, a Rightful, Lawful, Par∣liamentary
<HI>Hanover</HI> King all we can
wish for is contained; the Protestant
Religion secured; the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> Reciprocally
established; the Toleration of Dissenters
is contained in a temper of Moderation;
the Laws are protected; Liberty and Pro∣perty
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
engag'd for; Parliamentary Autho∣rity
recogniz'd; every thing that was in
Danger is made safe, that was in doubt
ascertain'd, that was disputed, settled,
and nothing remains for us but for every
Man to <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do their
own Business.</HI></P>
<P>If any hot Man shall object that this
is an Exhortation Politically made to
skreen Criminals from Justice, and that
the late Management should be enquir'd
into and examined; I say, such a Man
shows what manner of Spirit he is of.
But let him be the Man to accuse, let
him name the Crime and the Criminal,
and let him be sure to answer for a false
Accusation, and begin if he thinks it is
necessary; but then let Offenders of all
Parties have equal Justice, and if they
can think of beginning the new Reign
in this Manner, let them go to Work
when they please.</P>
<P>But is this a time for that Work, or
rather since Faults on every Side are to
be found, is it now our Business to re∣concile
our selves to one another, and
forget for one another the Causes of our
former Feuds, that we may not fall into
the like again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
What a Stage of Parties, of Strife, of
Rage and Fury, shall we make the Reign
of the King to be, if we go this way to
Work? How shall we deprive His Ma∣jesty
of the Blessing and Comfort of his
Subjects, and our selves of the Blessing
and Happiness of his Protection and Fa∣vour?
And make our selves miserable
under that very Influence which we
thought to make us Happy.</P>
<P>Can we expect the King desires to be
King, of but part of his People? do we
think he comes in loaden with Resent∣ment,
and that he will permit one half
of his People to fall upon the other, upon
the single Question of, who is, or is not
best affected to him, and most in his In∣terest?
That he should set up an Inqui∣sition
upon the Conduct of Parties before
he was King, and a Retrospect upon the
general Behaviour of the People when he
had nothing to do with them? Will he
begin to punish what his benign Prede∣cessor
would not, and shed that Blood
which she would have saved? OR on
the contrary, will his Majesty rather be
pleased that all Animosities and Prejudi∣ces
should be bury'd in a general Chari∣ty,
and all Party Offences laid asleep in
an act of Oblivion, that his Subjects may
be easy, that none may tremble at his
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Coming, but that he may have the
Hearts and Hands of every Subject with
him, and may be the King of all his
Peoples Wishes.</P>
<P>This leads me to the first Important Que∣stion
mentioned in my Title, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>What
we are to expect from</HI> his Present Majesty.
Let me enquire of it Negatively.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have not Reason to expect in
his Present Majesty a raw Youth, unex∣perienced
in the art of Government, that
knows not how or when to relax, or re∣strain
the Humours of Parties, or to lead
the People he is to Govern; that must give
up himself to be impos'd upon by his Coun∣sellors,
and knows not how, or where to
bestow his Favours, or shew his Dislike: I
am not complimenting his Majesty when I
tell you the King was not born Yester∣day,
nor is his Knowledge in the publick
Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> to learn: He will indeed
be a Stranger in some of the Customs
and Usages of our Court, and Country,
to which he will soon accommodate him∣self;
but he is not a Stranger in the Of∣fice
of a King; he has been a Soveraign
Prince many Years, and cannot be at a
Loss to know either his Office, or Duty;
and as he will know how to avoid failing
in his part, so he will not be Ignorant
when we fail in Ours.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
2. Tho' his Majesty is a Prince of
known Benignity, and goodness of Dis∣position,
and Infinitely beloved by his
own Subjects, for his Lenity and Mode∣ration,
even where his Power is absolute,
and where the Obedience of his People rises
up to a Degree that we would call Slave∣ry;
yet I say we are not to expect his Ma∣jesty
will suffer, as has been too much the
Case in our two last Reigns, himself to
be trampled on, his Goodness and For∣bearance
play'd upon and abused, his
wisest Measures of Government ridi∣cu'd,
his Councils slighted and con∣demned;
I believe his Majesty will give
us no Reason to do thus, and we ought
not to expect he will Patiently bear
it.</P>
<P N="3">3. We ought not to expect that upon
every Malecontent Party that may think
themselves not kindly enough treated, or
that may be turned out of Place and Of∣fice,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as must often be the Case; we
may be permitted to Libel and Insult
him? It is certainly the Neglect of this
part, even to a Fault, that has brought
our Pamphlets up to such a Degree of
Buffoonry, and such unsufferable Inso∣lence,
that no time in the Memory of
Man, or of History, can shew the like;
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
and which the even Criminal Mercy of
her Majesty's Reign, in every Ministry,
gave too much Encouragement to.</P>
<P>It is a strange Case, and owing to no∣thing
but the looseness of the Rein, with
which our Princes have always go∣vern'd;
that no sooner has the Soveraign
here dismiss'd a Minister of State or a set
of Ministers of State, but those Ministers
turn Malecontents against that Admini∣stration
they are dismiss'd from, lay wait
for the Ministers that succeed, Watch for
their halting, throw Dirt at them on all
Occasions, load their best Actions with
Scandal and Calumny, aggravate every
mistake to a Degree of Crime, blacken
their Measures with the Reproach of
both Folly and Knavery, and charge
them with Treasonable Designs against
the Liberties of their Country; in a
Word, strive to render them odious and
burthemsome to the People, that a popu∣lar
cry being raised against them, the
Soveraign may first be last be obliged to
part with them; nor is this all, for altho'
this Resentment be immediately levelled
at the Ministers of State, yet it always
Points at the Soveraign, nay, and
touches him too, slily insinuating either
his Incapacity to Govern, or his Indolence
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
in Management, his being engross'd in a
Favourite, led blindly by the Nose, de∣luded,
besieged, imposed upon, and the
like, all which tend to lessen the Sove∣raign
in the Eyes of the Subject, and bring
Government it self into Contempt.</P>
<P>Many ways this has been our Case, in
the two former Reigns especially, and
innumerable Mischiefs attend the Go∣vernment
of this Nation from this one
beginning, and as all these have had the
greater Influence from the too great Le∣nity
and Forbearance of the Soveraign,
giving way to the erecting Parties and
Factions in the Houshold and Court, so
it is hoped we may say that we ought
not to expect his present Majesty should
subject himself, and his Administration,
to the same Uneasiness.</P>
<P>I have seen something of the English
Courts in former Reigns, and have ob∣served
that when Ministers of State have
been dismissed, it has not been as it is
now. If the Prince for Reasons of State
thought fit to dismiss his Servants, or to
change Hands in the Administration of
his Affairs, the great Man dismiss'd, or
the set of Men dismist, submitted; they
took it for a Misfortune to lose their
Princes Favour, and by a Modest and
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Dutiful Behaviour always stood ready,
and express'd their willingness to deserve
the return of it: Far was it from such in
those Days to demand Reasons why they
were dismiss'd, or to raise Parties a∣gainst
those that came in; to undermine
them in their Stations, and bring the
Soveraign to the Necessity of taking them
in again.</P>
<P>Neither did the new Servants ta∣ken
in, fortify themselves against those
who were turned out, by endeavouring to
misrepresent their former Conduct to the
Soveraign, or to lessen them in the Eyes
of the People, and thereby to block up
the Way against their returning into
Business. But on the contrary, they were
always ready to do Business together in
whatsoever Station of the Government
the Soveraign might be pleased to employ
them.</P>
<P>Nor was ever the changing Hands in
the Administration till now, accounted
the changing a Party. Ministers of
State fell and rise single, and alone, and
it was not found needful at the Change
of a Secretary, or of a Treasurer, to
change Councils and Measures, turn out
all the Inferior Officers in the Houshold
and Revenue, and even to all Officers,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Civil and Military in the Kingdom,
changing Lieutenancies, removing Ju∣stices
of the Peace, and even in the very
Church, observing the Party Interests of
the Ministers of State, in placing Chap∣lains,
making or translating Bishops, and
the like.</P>
<P>This I must confess Appears to me to
be a Foundation in the Government, of
something that should not be named,
and which in time if not redress'd, will
certainly bring all our Kings under Tute∣lage,
and be fatal even to Monarchy it
self: How this shall be redress'd, I am
not to dictate. All that I say to it here, is,
that I hope we will not expect such Pro∣ceedings
under the Reign of his Present
Majesty, who as we believe of him, that
he Understands the Nature of Govern∣ment
too well to confine himself to the
narrow Measures of a Party, so much less
can we reasonably believe he will suffer
himself to be <HI>governed by</HI> a PARTY;
which indeed would be fatal to himself,
and to us all.</P>
<P>4. No more are we to expect from his
Present Majesty, that he will come into e∣very
Party Resentment, and gratify that
hellish Passion of Revenge which some
People wish for, and which they think they
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
owe to their late Mortifications: This
would be to make his Majesty a Party
Man against the Interest of his King∣dom,
and against the Peace and Felicity
of his own Reign. His Majesty will
not appear Ignorant what to dislike, and
what to approve, what to resent, and
what to pass over. No doubt but many
People have taken Liberties in the prece∣dent
Reign, which they would not
have taken had his Majesty been upon
the Throne, it was ever so in every
Reign: If the Resentment of the Succes∣sor
were to be push'd at these Things, as
the Resentment of Parties would push
them, many People might be made unea∣sy,
who for the future may perhaps be∣come
Loyal and Faithful; and many
People may be undone, whose Ruin shall
not add one Grain to the Safety or Hap∣piness
of his Majesty's Reign. I am
perswaded every Jacobite that behaves
quietly and inoffensively under his Maje∣sty,
may yet hope for the same Security
and Protection which he enjoy'd under
King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Question but many a Ja∣cobite
will by such a merciful Admini∣stration
be in time reduced to his Duty,
who by the Violence of Resentment
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
would be continued in Enmity, and per∣haps
be made desperate. Here let it be
observed that by Jacobite I am to be
understood a quiet passive Jack, not an
intreaguing, ploting, busy turbulent Jaco∣bite;
let such receive the due desert of
their Folly, and whoever breaks the
Peace of his Majesty's Reign, let him
neither claim or receive any Mercy.</P>
<P>His Majesty is a King, and not a private
Man, and when he is supposed to Practise
the great Vertue of Moderation it is sup∣posed
he will Practise it as a King; that
is to say, that it shall be extensive, <HI>God∣like</HI>
to every Penitent, giving room to
Men to forget the Rancour of their
Spirits, and forbearing to take Advan∣tages
of the Folly and Blindness of his
Subjects. If we pretend to expect Punish∣ment,
and the Extremity of the Law upon
every weak Man who has been drawn in
to offend against the Protestant Successi∣on,
you will make the King's Reign,
which we hope to see Mild and Merciful,
turn'd into a general Judicature, and all
his Enemies that would not, that he
should Reign over them, slain before
him: A sight which I dare say his Majesty's
generous Heart would abhor, and which
might make him terrible, but would
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
never make him dear to the British Na∣tion.</P>
<P>If
the Jacobites, who shall behave
Quietly and Dutifully to the King, have
thus nothing to expect that is terrible,
much less will any other of his Majesty's
Subjects whose Crimes are not such as
call for Justice from the Nation as a ci∣vil
Society. But all his Majesty's Sub∣jects
are as it were put upon their Be∣haviour,
and have room given to testify
their Loyalty and Fidelity, whether sus∣pected
or no by their future Conduct.</P>
<P>And this Brings me to the other part
of my Subject, (<HI>viz.</HI>) how we ought to
behave to the <HI>King upon his Coming among
us.</HI></P>
<P>A general Answer might suffice for this
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>like good Subjects,</HI> Faithfully, Loy∣ally
with Obedience and Affection; and
like good Christians living under him
quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godli∣ness
and Honesty: But this is not speak∣ing
extensively to the present Case, nor
giving sufficient Directions to the People
how to regulate their Conduct so as may
discharge their Duty as Subjects, and en∣gage
the Soveraign, whom God and the
Laws have set over them, to Rule them
not as a King only with Authority and
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Justice, but as a Father of his Country,
and of his People, with Tenderness and
Affection.</P>
<P>I pay no Compliment to his Majesty
when I presume to say he comes over eve∣ry
way qualified both by natural Disposi∣tion,
and premeditated Resolution to treat
us with all that Clemency, Lenity, Ten∣derness
and Moderation that we can
desire: It is our immediate Duty, as Sub∣jects,
to apply our selves to merit that
Benign Carriage, to engage him to us,
and to give him no cause to think his
Affection to all his Subjects ill placed.</P>
<P>And that this Exhortation may be ef∣fectual
in general to us all, I take the Li∣berty
to begin with the Jacobites: These,
I divide into Originals, and New Con∣verts
I have that Charity for these last,
as to believe they have been drawn into
Jacobitism, rather from their being per∣swaded
to believe its Success was certain,
and infallible, and that they should so
recommend themselves to the next turn,
than from any particular Conviction of
the Invalidity of Parliamentary Settle∣ment,
or of the superior Right of the
Pretender. Their slip is pardonable no
doubt on two Conditions. 1. That they
have committed no overt Act which
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
amounting to Treason, renders it abso∣lutely
necessary to reduce them not to
Obedience, but to Example: and 2.)
That they immediately resolve to return
to their first Principles, and testify their
sincere Repentance by a Constant sted∣dy
Loyalty to the present King, till by
the length of time they may be natura∣lized
in their Obedience, and it may be
as just to forget their Offence as it would
be now to punish it.</P>
<P>Certainly no Man that entertains the
least Zeal for his Country can now wish,
had he no other Motive to see all these
Calamities brought upon it which an at∣tempt
for the Pretender must now In∣volve
it in: If the Jacobite Cause was
desperate before, as to thinking Men was
apparent, it must be nothing but Lunacy
and Euthusiasm to entertain any Expe∣ctation
of its Success now. From whence
it seems just to conclude now, that he
who Joyns in an Attempt for the Preten∣der
at this time cannot be thought to do
it so much with an Eye to the Success, as
to the immediate Plunder of a War, that
he may Fish in the troubled Water, and
catch up some trifle out of the Ruins of
his Country. This is one of the worst
sort of Incendiaries, who sets a House on
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Fire purely and on purpose to rob the
disordered Inhabitants when they are in
a Hurry and Consternation.</P>
<P>Now I can not think any of these new
Converts or second-hand Jacobites, for
such they are, can yet be so far advanced
as to seek the Confusion of their Country
upon so vile a Consideration as that of
sharing the Ruins I have therefore no∣thing
to say to such, but to let them see
their Case is desperate and irretrievable, and
they will soon see what is the next step
they have to take.</P>
<P>As to original Jacobites Nonjurant, Pro∣fest,
and openly so, who were so from the
beginning of Jacobitism it self, I can only
say to such, <HI>be it with you according as you
behave,</HI> I have here no room for farther
Discourse with you.</P>
<P>That the Case of Jacobitism is now
desparate, we need but little Argument
to perswade them to, if Possession be 11
Points of the Law, 'tis yet more so of
the Throne; and I need go no farther to
Convince you of it than this. It was not
long ago when a great Man in the <HI>French</HI>
Armies laid it down as a Fundamental in
this very Case, that King <HI>James</HI> could
never be restored in <HI>England</HI> by the
Sword, but that it must be done by
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
dividing the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> and ma∣king
way for them to bring him in
themselves. This was publish'd after∣wards
in a Paper called the <HI>Doway Letter.</HI></P>
<P>I am willing to take it for granted either
way, as the Jacobites please: If the Inte∣rest
of Jacobitism be restored by Ma∣nagement
at home, they need no more
than to consult their own Reason; and
see if they can tell themselves where their
prospect lies: They had the Folly and
Simplicity to flatter themselves that they
were in a Way for it lately, imagining
tho' against all common Sence, that the
Ministry were in their Interest. Their
Zeal for the Pretender made them blind,
and though there were a Thousand De∣monstrations,
that they were only dup'd
and made Tools of, to serve the present
occasion of the Ministry without the least
thought of doing any thing for them as
they called it, yet so willing were they to
believe what they so weakly, though
earnestly, hoped for, that they shut, out all
just Suspitions from their Understandings
and acted with the Ministry as if the
Ministry had acted with them.</P>
<P>But when the thing came to the Test,
when Heaven took the Work into his
own Hands, by removing her late Ma∣esty,
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
then it appeared how they were
mistaken, that they had been only made
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ools of, to serve a turn with, and that
for the Interest of the Pretender, was
no part of the Project.</P>
<P>If then there was no real Design in their
Favour before, no Body will be so weak
to suppose they are in a better State
now, and therefore I may be allowed to
say the Case of Jacobitism is now grown
desparate as to the Art and Management
of Parties at home; and as to its being
propogated by Force from abroad, that
I believe the Jacobites themselves have
despair'd of long ago</P>
<P>This being the Case, and Jacobitism
being effectually suppress'd, what have
we to do with any other Divisions? What
Bone of Contention is left among us?</P>
<P>We have nothing to do then, but to
Unite in a general Behaviour of Duty
and Affection, and laying aside the Me∣mory
of former Breache,s let the King
have their Services and Assistance of the
whole Nation, give him leave to be King
of ALL his People, give him room to
make use of ALL their help, to possess
all their Hearts, and have the Strength
of all their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
There are two principal Articles which
have been the Causes, or at least have
been given as the Reasons, of all our
Parties, and of all the Divisions that have
ever happened in this Nation; and
which as they would be effectually taken
away by this Unity and Agreement of
the Nation in their Behaviour to his pre∣sent
Majesty: So if any Contention or
Strife happened among us after it, the
World would plainly see it was a wick∣ed
Design to undermine the Govern∣ment,
and disturb the publick Peace, and
with any just Foundation, these two
Articles are; 1. The Danger of the
Pretender. 2. The Danger of the Church:
both these I say would be taken away in
a Firm and resolved Loyalty, and Affe∣ction
to the King, his powerful Hand
strengthened by the Affections of his
People to him, and they made invincible
by their Union, with one another, would
secure us against the first, and his Zeal
for the Preservation of their Right, in all
its Parts would prevent the Apprehensi∣ons
of the last.</P>
<P>In his Majesty's Zeal for the publick
Good, and watchful concern for its Safe∣ty,
all Danger from Enemies abroad, or
from Parties at home will be taken away,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
all State Jealousies bury'd, and all Party
Animosities bury'd. The Danger of the
Pretender will be lost, the very Remem∣brance
of it will dye, a brave and a mag∣naimous
Prince at the Head of an uni∣ted
Nation can leave us no room for Ap∣prehensions,
nor the Friends of the Pre∣tender
any room for Hope: Popery, and
Jacobitism must no more shew their
Faces, or have the least Pretences for their
Cause; let them make what Efforts they
can, they will be Laught at by the World:
Not the Power of the <HI>French,</HI> or of the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchies, whether united or
not United, can give us any Uneasiness
in that part; we shall be always ready,
and always able to Encounter them.</P>
<P>No more can that other Amusement,
<HI>the Danger of the Church,</HI> have any Foun∣dation
among us, unless it be founded in
Parties and Divisions; which Parties and
Divisions will bring in all the Mischiefs of
the former Reign, and make his Maje∣sty's
Days as unhappy and uncomforta∣ble
as those of his Predecessors.</P>
<P>But this general Union of Affections
would remove all Jealousies, prevent that
State Plague of governing by Parties, it
would dissolve Tests and occasional Bills
upon the Arms of the Government, to
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Embrace all its Subjects with an equal
Affection; and open the Heart of the
governed to such a Faithful and Affectio∣nate
Behaviour, that every sort of Men
being true Lovers of the establish'd Go∣vernment,
could not be capable of any
Designs to its Prejudice.</P>
<P>This is the Moderation I am recom∣mending,
and this alone. I am not plead∣ing
to cover any Man whom Justice ought
to punish, let the Law have its Course
upon all; let none mistake me. But if
we would make the Nation and the King
Happy, enable his Majesty to Rule
Happily and Gloriously, we must resolve
to bury this Party temper, this Spirit of
Animosity and Envy that is among us; to
be one easy People under the Reign of
one Glorious King.</P>
<P>I can most plainly perceive that there
are a set of People who begin to move
among us already with the same Spirit
which has ruined us, as to our Peace, once
or twice before, who not knowing <HI>what
Spirit they are of,</HI> begin already to be <HI>Cal∣ling
for Fire from Heaven;</HI> and will think
they are highly injur'd, and resent it e∣ven
against a new Administration, if their
Party Resentments are out aveng'd on
those who they single out for Objects of
Justice, as they call it; and if the King
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
does not immediately fall upon all those
that they shall take upon them to call
Enemies of the Succession whether it
were really so, or no.</P>
<P>In their several Pamphlets which they
continue to publish upon that Head, they
are already whetting the Edge of the po∣pular
Temper, and suggesting that those
People who contrary to former Re∣proaches,
appear to be heartily in the In∣terest
of the Present King only feign to
be so.</P>
<P>As to the general Consent of all Peo∣ple,
as well in the Ministry as out of it,
to proclaim the Protestant Successor, they
say it was not in the Power of any to
withstand it; that the Acts of Parliament
had made such effectual Provision to settle
an immediate Administration, and that
in such Hands as were certain to put that
Settlement in Execution; and had added
such severe Penalties for the least delay,
or neglect of Duty in that Case, that no
Man could stir in Favour of a contrary
Interest; and therefore they found them∣selves
under a Necessity of falling in with
the Protestant Succession, least they should
be fallen upon by the whole Administra∣tion
who found themselves vested with
all the Military and Civil Authority, the
Executive Power suffering no Interval of
its Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
How much this Justifies those People
who could not say with the general Opi∣nion
that the Danger of the Succession
was so great before, as was suggested,
tho' it might be very material to the clear∣ing
up the Honesty of the Persons, yet
as I know it is a String which those I am
now speaking of do not care to have
touch'd, I therefore purposely omit.</P>
<P>But I must take leave to say, that ma∣ny
who did not go along with the late
Gentlemen in all their Warmth against
the Ministry, were yet as Sincere Friends to
the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, as they, and Em∣brac'd
as heartily the Interest of his Present
Majesty as they; and it will never pre∣vail
with his Majesty to condemn
all those as his Enemies, that did not
see the same Reason to Quarrel with the
Administration of his Predecessor as other
Men did.</P>
<P>While I am saying this, and to avoid
the Reproach which these Men are alrea∣dy
raising, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that this is to prevent
Punishment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I give up at once every
Man to them who the Law without Par∣tiality,
without Party-Justice, without
straining Facts by Innuendoes will fairly
and clearly condemn. Let them proceed
and take what Measures Legally can be
taken.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
But the Moderation I insist upon is,
that no Man be condemn'd by Clamour
censur'd first by Party, and then sentenc'd
by Tumult; that Prejudices be laid aside,
and the general FEUD of Parties laid
asleep, that seeing the main End is at∣tained,
the debate about who was for, or
against, unless they acted Criminally
against it, may dye, that Men may no
more be made Offenders for a Word, and
be judg'd by Negatives, that they were
NOT so, and so, and did NOT do so,
and so.</P>
<P>If any Men are Criminal, bring them
forth, we are not speaking, I say, of suf∣fering
Criminals to Escape, but of not
making Innocent Men Criminal, whether
they will or no, and keeping a Breach
open in our Charity, because Men will
not be of our Opinion in Matters of State;
if these Men think they can hurt those
Men by Law, who they Condemn by
the Tongue, let it be done; if nothing
else will satisfy them, let them try their
Hands with Impeachments and Persecu∣tions
for Male Administration, and let
them go back what length they please.</P>
<P>This I say again is far from the Design
of this Discourse, I ask no Forbearance,
no Indempnity for Men who are abnoxi∣ous
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
to Punishment from the Law, they
that would take such an Advantage of a
perswasive to Peace and Moderation shall
be defeated in it by this Challenge. We
know that too much Mercy was never
the Sin of that Party of Men we speak
of. Let them do what they think they
can do by Justice, if they think they have
so great an Advantage in their Hands.</P>
<P>But where the Law is not concern'd,
where no Breaches of Constitution, no
Oppressions, no Guilt is concerned, there
let them tell us a Reason why Moderati∣on,
Charity, and a Christian Friendly
Reconciliation of Parties, and an Oblivion
of that wicked Spirit of Rancour and
Malice, may not take Place among us.
WHY having the main Article of our
Protestant Succession secured, our Reli∣gion,
Liberties, and Properties established,
and all under the Protection of God, and
a Protestant King, we may not join toge∣ther
to make that Protestant King Great
and Glorious, his Days Happy, and his
Reign Comfortable; none of which can
be, if we will not with a full Consent of
all Parties Unite in his Interest, and in
our own. If we will not be at Peace with
one another, what Peace can be expected
for the King? How shall his Majesty be
the Common Father of a Nation, tearing
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
one another to Pieces, and endeavouring to
Supplant one another in Interest, expose one
another in Character, and accuse one another
of Crimes never committed.</P>
<P>If we will not do this, if we will not drop
the Party Quarrel, forget the Animosities and
Heats we have foolishly run into, we shall
all fall into Parties and Distractions again as
much as ever, which a true Lover of his Coun∣try
would tremble to think on. I cannot for∣get
that I have often heard Men, whose tone
yet I have observed to be a little alter'd since,
I say I have often heard Men talk thus to one
another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I care not what they do so the Protestant
Succession be but secur'd: I have nothing to
do with <HI>who is in,</HI> or <HI>who is out,</HI> what Mi∣nistry
the Queen Employs, or what she
turns out, let but our Liberties and Reli∣gion
be safe, and let them but keep out the
Pretender, and we have no more to say."</Q></P>
<P>I cannot but throw these Discourses in the
Way of some People at this time, thus; <HI>SIR,
We</HI> hope all you desired is now obtained, all
your demands answered. The Protestant Suc∣cession
has taken Place, the Protestant Succes∣sor
is in full Possession, the whole Kingdom
seems to join with one Heart, and one Voice,
to Congratulate him, and to join together in
their Allegiance to him, what is the matter
with you that you are Not satisfi'd now? What
more would you have? Would you have us all
Quarrel again about who is <HI>Sincere,</HI> and who
Feigns? Whoever Feigns dare not own his Dis∣content,
and perhaps in time will give it over.
Shall we Quarrel, because we do not think
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
every Body as earnest as we are our selves!
This would be to fall out for the sake of fal∣ling
out. This would be really, and in good
Earnest to <HI>sow Divisions;</HI> and depend upon it, if
you <HI>sow Iniquity, you will reap Vanity;</HI> if you sow
Divisions, Divisions will grow, you will have
a large Crop of Strife and Contention, Vexa∣tion
and Perplexity, and we shall still be a mi∣serable
divided Nation, we shlal have no Com∣fort
of the Protestant Succession, and the Pro∣testant
Successor will have little Comfort in us.</P>
<P>The Sum of this Discourse, and the true
Design of the Author of it, is to recommend
to the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to consider their pre∣sent
Circumstances, to reassume that Temper,
Moderation and Spirit of Union among them∣selves,
which has always been a Token to them
of approaching Deliverance. This is now the
only Course left them, and in the pursuit of
this, they can not fail of a generous Assistance
from all Men that wish well to the Publick.</P>
<P>I know the hot Men of every side will op∣pose
this, and some will make this use of it;
that as there is now a Breach made, their Bu∣siness
is to make the Assault; as the <HI>Turks</HI> at
the Siege of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> when, by Accident or
Treachery, or what other means is not known,
they found the Walls and Works of the City
all blown up on a suddain, they immediately
advanced to the Storm.</P>
<P>Let those who are of that Opinion in the
present Case consider, that they make the Ex∣periment
at the hazard of their Country, and
that as a Miscarriage will endanger not the
Publick only, but themselves also, so let them
remember that whoever Pushes his private
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
Design at the Hazard of the publick Peace,
shews that he Values his Country less than his
single Interest.</P>
<P>But what is it these Men call breaking in?
Breaking in upon Moderation, and upon Peace,
is making War upon your selves. The Support
and Preservation of our Country's Interest
Depends upon a Steady, Wise, and Calm Ad∣ministration,
not straightned by the narrow
Measures of Parties; for Government is above
Parties, and ought to be preserv'd in its just
Superiority to all private Designs; the only
Limits of Government are the Laws, and the
only end of Government is the publick Good.</P>
<P>The time is now come for us, all to act
with a new Spirit, the War is over, <HI>let the
Spears be turned into pruning Hooks,</HI> let the
Rage abate, for the Contest is at an End, let
us <HI>Study to be Quiet, and do our own Business;</HI> if
any Man would sow Division, let us <HI>Mark that
Man,</HI> and have no Communication with him.</P>
<P>As to those who have offended, <HI>who</HI> as above
<HI>I freely give up,</HI> if the Law can take hold of
any, <HI>it is open,</HI> any one may have Recourse
to it. I doubt not his Majesty comes in
with a temper of Clemency, and as <HI>SAƲL,</HI>
when he was proclaimed King of <HI>Israel,</HI> when
the Party-men would have had him resent∣ed
the Conduct of those who would not have
had him <HI>to have reigned over him;</HI> if even any
offending Jacobite is found, that Text and Ex∣ample
recommends them, <HI>if Penite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to his
Majesty's Royal Mercy. 1. Sam. 11. 13. <HI>And</HI>
SAUL <HI>said, there should not a Man be put to
Death this Day, for to Day the</HI> LORD <HI>hath
wrought Salvation in</HI> Israel.</P>
