<HEAD>TO HER GRACE the DUTCHESS OF <HI>ORMOND.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Privilege of Poetry (or it may be the Vanity of the Pretenders to it) has given 'em a kind of Right to pretend, at the same time, to the Favour of those, whom
<PB REF="4"/>
their high Birth and excellent Qua∣lities have plac'd in a very distin∣guishing manner above the rest of the World. If this be not a receiv'd Maxim, yet I am sure I am to wish it were, that I may have at least some kind of Excuse for laying this Tragedy at Your Grace's Feet. I have too much reason to fear that it may prove but an indifferent En∣tertainment to Your Grace, since if I have any way succeeded in it, it has been in describing those violent Passions which have been always Strangers to so happy a Temper, and so noble and so exalted a Virtue as Your Grace is Mistress of. Yet for all this, I cannot but confess the Va∣nity which I have, to hope that there may be something so moving in the Misfortunes and Distress of the Play, as may be not altogether unworthy of Your Grace's Pity. This is one of the main Designs of Tragedy, and to
<PB REF="5"/>
excite this generous Pity in the great∣est Minds, may pass for some kind of Success in this way of Writing. I am sensible of the Presumption I am guilty of by this Hope, and how much it is that I pretend to in Your Grace's Approbation; if it be my good For∣tune to meet with any little Share of it, I shall always look upon it as much more to me than the general Applause of the Theatre, or even the Praise of a good Critick. Your Grace's Name is the best Protection this Play can hope for, since the World, ill-natur'd as it is, agrees in an universal Respect and Deference for Your Grace's Person and Cha∣racter. In so censorious an Age as this is, where Malice furnishes out all the Publick Conversations, where every Body pulls and is pull'd to pieces of course, and where there is hardly such a thing as being merry, but at another's Expence; yet by a
<PB REF="6"/>
publick and uncommon Justice to the Dutchess of <HI>Ormond,</HI> Her Name has never been mention'd, but as it ought, tho' She has Beauty enough to pro∣voke Detraction from the Fairest of Her own Sex, and Virtue e∣nough to make the Loose and Disso∣lute of the other (a very formidable Party) Her Enemies. Instead of this they agree to say nothing of Her but what She deserves, That Her Spirit is worthy of Her Birth; Her Sweet∣ness, of the Love and Respect of all the World; Her Piety, of Her Reli∣gion; Her Service, of Her Royal Mi∣stress; and Her Beauty and Truth, of Her Lord; that in short every part of Her Character is Just, and that She is the best Reward for one of the great∣est Hero's this Age has produc'd. This, Madam, is what You must allow Peo∣ple every where to say; those whom You shall leave behind You in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> will have something further to
<PB REF="7"/>
add, the Loss we shall suffer by your Grace's Journey to <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Queen's Pleasure, and the Impatient Wishes of that Nation are about to deprive us of Two of our Publick Ornaments. But there is no arguing against Reasons so prevalent as these. Those who shall lament your Grace's Absence will yet acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice of Her Majesty's Choice: Among all whose Royal Favours none cou'd be so agreeable, upon a thousand Ac∣counts, to that People, as the Duke of <HI>Ormond.</HI> With what Joy, what Ac∣clamations shall they meet a Govern∣or, who beside their former Obligati∣ons to His Family, has so lately ven∣tur'd His Life and Fortune for their Preservation; What Duty, what Sub∣mission shall they not pay to that Au∣thority which the Queen has delegated to a Person so dear to 'em? And with what Honour, what Respect shall they receive Your Grace, when they look
<PB REF="8"/>
upon You as the Noblest and Best Pat∣tern Her Majesty cou'd send 'em, of her own Royal Goodness, and Perso∣nal Virtues? They shall behold Your Grace with the same Pleasure the <HI>En∣glish</HI> shall take when ever it shall be their good Fortune to see You return again to Your Native Country. In <HI>Eng∣land</HI> Your Grace is become a Publick Concern, and as Your going away will be attended with a general Sorrow, so Your Return shall give as general a Joy; and to none of those many, more than to,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>LONG has the Fate of Kings and Empires been</L>
<L>The common Business of the Tragick Scene,</L>
<L>As if Misfortune made the Throne her Seat,</L>
<L>And none cou d be unhappy but the Great.</L>
<L>Dearly 'tis true each buys the Crown he wears,</L>
<L>And many are the mighty Monarch's Cares:</L>
<L>By foreign Foes and home-bred Factions prest,</L>
<L>Few are the Joys he knows and short his Hours of Rest.</L>
<L>Stories like these with Wonder we may hear,</L>
<L>But far remote and in a higher Sphere,</L>
<L>We ne'er can pity what we ne'er can share.</L>
<L>Like distant Battles of the <HI>Pole</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI></L>
<L>Which frugal Citizens o'er Coffee read,</L>
<L>Careless for who shall fail or who succeed.</L>
<L>Therefore an humbler Theme our Author chose,</L>
<L>A melancholy Tale of private Woes:</L>
<L>No Princes here lost Royalty bemoan,</L>
<L>But you shall meet with Sorrows like your own;</L>
<L>Here see imperious Love his Vassals treat,</L>
<L>As hardly as Ambition does the Great;</L>
<L>See how succeeding Passions rage by turns,</L>
<L>How fierce the Youth with Joy and Rapture burns,</L>
<L>And how to Death for Beauty lost, he mourns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let no nice Taste the Poet's Art arraign,</L>
<L>If some frail vicious Characters he feign:</L>
<L>Who Writes shou'd still let Nature be his Care,</L>
<L>Mix Shades with Lights and not paint all things fair,</L>
<L>But shew you Men and Women as they are.</L>
<L>With Deference to the Fair he bad me say,</L>
<L>Few to Perfection ever found the Way;</L>
<L>Many in many Parts are known t' excel,</L>
<L>But 'twere too hard for One to act all well;</L>
<L>Whom justly Life should through each Scene commend,</L>
<L>The Maid, the Wife the Mistress, and the Friend:</L>
<L>This Age, 'tis true has one great Instance seen,</L>
<L>And Heav'n in Justice made that One a Queen.</L>

<L>One kind Remembrance in <HI>Calista</HI>'s Breast,</L>

<L><PB N="5" REF="15"/>
With Rapture on her Lips, I found her Cold,</L>
<L>As a dead Lover's Statue on his Tomb;</L>
<L>A rising storm of Passion shook her Breast,</L>
<L>Her Eyes a piteous show'r of Tears let fall,</L>
<L>And then she sigh'd as if her Heart were breaking.</L>
<L>With all the tend'rest Eloquence of Love</L>
<L>I beg'd to be a Sharer in her Grief;</L>
<L>But she, with Looks averse, and Eyes that froze me,</L>

<L>Unknowing in the Subtleties of Women;</L>

<L>Fierceness and Pride, the Guardians of her Honour,</L>
<L>Were charm'd to Rest, and Love alone was waking.</L>
<L>Within her rising Bosom all was calm,</L>
<L>As peaceful Seas that know no Storms, and only</L>
<L>Are gently lifted up and down by Tides.</L>
<L>I snatch'd the glorious, golden Opportunity,</L>
<L>And with prevailing, youthful Ardour prest her,</L>
<L>Till with short Sighs, and murmuring Reluctance,</L>
<L>The yielding Fair One gave me perfect Happiness.</L>

<L>With all the Subtleties, and pow'rful Arts</L>
<L>Of wilful Woman lab'ring for her purpose,</L>
<L>Again she told the same dull nauseous Tale.</L>
<L>Unmov'd, I beg'd her spare th'ungrateful Subject,</L>

That I would still retain her in my Heart,</L>

<L>But when the Storm found way, 'twas wild and loud,</L>
<L>Mad as the Priestess of the <HI>Delphick</HI> God,</L>
<L>Enthusiastick Passion swell'd her Breast,</L>
<L>Enlarg'd her Voice, and ruffled all her Form;</L>
<L>Proud, and disdainful of the Love I proffer'd,</L>
<L>She call'd me Villain! Monster! Base! Betrayer!</L>
<L>At last, in very bitterness of Soul,</L>
<L>With deadly Imprecations on her self,</L>

<L>Alas! my Daughter?</L>
<L>Thou hast rashly ventur'd in a stormy Sea,</L>
<L>Where Life, Fame, Virtue, all were wreck'd and lost;</L>
<L>But sure thou hast born thy part in all the Anguish,</L>
<L>And smarted with the Pain, then rest in Peace,</L>
<L>Let Silence and Oblivion hide thy Name,</L>
<L>And save thee from the Malice of Posterity;</L>
<L>And may'st thou find with Heav'n the same Forgiveness,</L>
<L>As with thy Father here.—Die, and be happy.</L>

<L>Celestial Sounds! Peace dawns upon my Soul,</L>

<L>Think not too hardly of me when I'm gone,</L>
<L>But pity me.—Had I but early known</L>
<L>Thy wond'rous Worth, thou excellent young Man,</L>
<L>We had been happier both:—Now 'tis too late,</L>

<L>Cold! dead and cold! and yet thou art not chang'd,</L>

<L>But at that Beauty must of force relented,</L>

<L>Oh! turn thee from the fatal Object; <HI>Altamont,</HI></L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, who play'd <HI>Lavinia.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>YOU see the tripping Dame could find no Favour,</L>
<L>Dearly she paid for Breach of good Behaviour,</L>
<L>Nor could her loving Husband's Fondness save her.</L>
<L><HI>Italian</HI> Ladies lead but scurvy Lives,</L>
<L>There's dreadful dealing with Eloping Wives;</L>
<L>Thus 'tis, because these Husbands are obey'd</L>
<L>By force of Laws, which for themselves they made,</L>
<L>With Tales of old Prescriptions they confiae,</L>
<L>The Right of Marriage-rule to their Male Line,</L>
<L>And Hust, and Domineer by Right Divine,</L>
<L>Had we the Pow'r we'd make the Tyrants know,</L>
<L>What 'tis to fail in Duties which they owe;</L>
<L>We'd teach the saunt'ring Squire, who loves to roam,</L>
<L>Forgetful of his own dear Spouse and Home;</L>
<L>Who Snores at Night supinely by her side,</L>
<L>'Twas not for this the Nuptial Knot was ty'd.</L>
<L>The plodding Petty-fogger, and the Cit,</L>
<L>Have learn'd at least this Modern way of Wit:</L>
<L>Each ill-bred, senseless Rogue, tho' ne'er so dull,</L>
<L>Has th' Impudence to think his Wife a Fool;</L>
<L>He spends the Night, where merry Wags resort,</L>
<L>With joking Clubs, and Eighteen-penny Port,</L>
<L>While she poor Soul's contented to regale,</L>
<L>By a sad Sea-cole Fire, with Wigs and Ale.</L>
<L><PB REF="86"/>
Well may the Cuckold-making Tribe find Grace,</L>
<L>And fill an absent Husband's empty place:</L>
<L>If you would e'er bring Constancy in Fashion,</L>
<L>You Men must first begin the Reformation.</L>
<L>Then shall the Golden Age of Love return,</L>
<L>No Turtle for her wand'ring Mate shall mourn,</L>
<L>No Foreign Charms shall cause Domestick Strife,</L>
<L>But ev'ry marry'd Man shall toast his Wife;</L>
<L><HI>Phillis</HI> shall not be to the Country sent,</L>
<L>For Carnivals in Town to keep a tedious <HI>Lent:</HI></L>
<L>Lampoons shall cease, and envious Scandal die,</L>
<L>And all shall live in Peace like my good Man and I.</L>
