<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Apprehending, Examination, and Imprison∣ment
of Jack, for Suspicion of Poisoning.</HEAD>
<P>THE attentive Reader cannot have
forgot, that in my last Part, the Sto∣ry
of <HI>Yan Ptschirnsooker</HI>'s Powder
was interrupted by a Message from <HI>Frog.</HI> I
have a natural Compassion for Curiosity, be∣ing
much troubled with the Distemper my
self; therefore to gratify that uneasy itching
Sensation in my Reader, I have procur'd the
following Account of that Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Yan Ptschirnsooker</HI> came off (as Rogues
usually do upon such Occasions) by Peach∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
his Partner, and being extremely forward
to bring him to the Gallows; <HI>Jack</HI> was ac∣cus'd▪
as the Contriver of all the Roguery.
And indeed it happen'd unfortunately for
the poor Fellow, that he was known to bear
a most inveterate Spight against the old Gen∣tlewoman,
and consequently, that never any
ill Accident happen'd to her, but he was su∣spected
to be at the bottom of it. If she
prick'd her Finger, <HI>Jack,</HI> to be sure, laid the
Pin in the way: If some Noise in the Street
disturb'd her Rest, who could it be but <HI>Jack</HI>
in some of his nocturnal Rambles? If a Ser∣vant
run away, <HI>Jack</HI> had debauch'd him:
every idle Tittle-tattle that went about, <HI>Jack</HI>
was always suspected for the Author of it:
However, all was nothing to this last Affair
of the temperating, moderating Powder. The
Hue and Cry went after <HI>Jack,</HI> to Apprehend
him, dead or alive, wherever he could be
found. The Constables look'd out for him
in all his usual Haunts; but, to no purpose.
Where d'ye think did they find him at last?
Ev'n smoaking his Pipe very quietly, at his
Brother <HI>Martin</HI>'s; from whence he was car∣ry'd,
with a vast Mob at his Heels, before
the Worshipful Mr. Justice <HI>Overdo.</HI> Several
of his Neighbours made Oath, That of late,
the Prisoner had been observ'd to lead a ve∣ry
dissolute Life, renouncing ev'n his usual
Hypocrisy, and Pretences to Sobriety: That
he frequented Taverns and Eating-Houses,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
and had been often guilty of Drunkenness
and Gluttony at My Lord-Mayor's Table:
That he had been seen in the Company of
Lewd Women: That he had transferr'd his
usual religious Care of the engross'd Copy of
his Father's Will, to Bank Bills, Orders for
Tallies, and Debentures:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tale of the Tub.</NOTE> These he now af∣firm'd,
with more literal Truth, to
be <HI>Meat, Drink, and Cloth, the Philo∣sophers
Stone, and the Ʋniversal Medi∣cine:</HI>
That he was so far from shewing his
customary Reverence to the <HI>Will,</HI> that he
kept company with those that call'd his Fa∣ther
a cheating Rogue, and his <HI>Will</HI> a For∣gery.
That he not only sat quietly and
heard his Father rail'd at, but often chim'd
in with the Discourse, and hugg'd the Au∣thors
as his Bosom Friends:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Tale of the Tub.</NOTE> <HI>That
instead of asking for Blows, at the
Corners of the Streets,</HI> he now be∣stow'd
them as plentifully as he begg'd them
before: In short, That he was grown a meer
Rake; and, had nothing left in him of old
<HI>Jack,</HI> except his Spight to <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Mo∣ther.</P>
<P>Another Witness made Oath, That <HI>Jack</HI>
had been overheard bragging of a Trick he
had found out to manage the <HI>old formal Jade,</HI>
as he us'd to call her. <Q>Damn this numb'd-Skull
of mine (quoth he) that I could not
light on it sooner. As long as I go in this
ragged tatter'd Coat, I am so well known,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
that I am hunted away from the old Wo∣man's
Door by every barking Curr about
the House, they bid me Defiance; there's
no doing Mischief as an open Enemy, I
must find some way or another of getting
within Doors, and then I shall have better
Opportunities of playing my Pranks, be∣sides
the Benefit of good keeping.</Q></P>
<P>Two Witnesses Swore, that several Years
ago, there came to their Mistriss's Door, a
young Fellow in a tatter'd Coat, that went
by the Name of <HI>Timothy Trim,</HI> whom they
did in their Conscience believe to be the
very Prisoner, resembling him in Shape, Sta∣ture,
and the Features of his Countenance;
that the said <HI>Timothy Trim</HI> being taken in∣to
the Family, clap'd their Mistriss's Livery
over his own tatter'd Coat; that the said
<HI>Timothy</HI> was extremely officious about their
Mistriss's Person, endeavouring by Flattery
and Tale-bearing, to set her against the rest
of the Servants; no Body was so ready to
fetch any thing that was wanted, or reach
what was drop'd; that he us'd to shove and
elbow his Fellow-Servants to get near his
Mistress, especially when Mony was a pay∣ing
or receiving, then he was never out of
the way; that he was extremely diligent
about every Bodies Business but his own;
that the said <HI>Timothy,</HI> while he was in the
Family, us'd to be playing Roguish Tricks;
when his Mistress's back was turn'd he would
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
loll out his Tongue, make Mouths, and laugh
at her, walking behind her like a <HI>Harlequin,</HI>
ridiculing her Motions and Gestures; if his
Mistress look'd about, he put on a grave,
demure Countenance, as he had been in a
fit of Devotion; that he us'd often to trip
up Stairs so smoothly that you could not
hear him tread, and put all things out of
Order; that he would pinch the Children
and Servants, when he met them in the dark,
so hard, that he left the Print of his Fore-fingers
and his Thumb in black and blue,
and then slink into a corner, as if no Body had
done it: Out of the same malicious Design,
he us'd to lay Chairs and Joint-stools in their
way, that they might break their Noses by
falling over them. The more young and un∣experienc'd,
he us'd to teach to talk Saucily,
and call Names: During his stay in the Fa∣mily
there was much Plate missing; that be∣ing
catch'd with a couple of Silver Spoons in
his Pocket, with their Handles wrench'd off,
he said, he was only going to carry them to
the Goldsmiths to be mended; that the said
<HI>Timothy</HI> was hated by all the honest Servants,
for his ill-condition'd, splenetick Tricks, but
especially for his slanderous Tongue; tradu∣cing
them to their Mistress, as Drunkards,
Thieves and Whore-masters; that the said <HI>Ti∣mothy,</HI>
by lying Stories, us'd to set all the Family
together by the Ears, taking delight to make
them Fight and Quarrel; particularly one Day
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
sitting at Table, he spoke Words to this Ef∣fect:
<Q>I am of Opinion <HI>(quoth he)</HI> That little
short Fellows, such as we are, have better
Hearts. and could beat the tall Fellows; I
wish it came to a fair Trial, I believe, these
long Fellows, as sightly as they are, should
find their Jackets well thwack'd.</Q> A parcel
of tall Fellows, who thought themselves af∣fronted
by this Discourse, took up the Qua∣rel,
and to't they went, the tall Men and
the low Men, which continues still a Faction
in the Family, to the great Disorder of our
Mistress's Affairs: That the said <HI>Timothy</HI> car∣ried
this Frolick so far, that he propos'd to
his Mistress, that she should entertain no Ser∣vant
that was above four Foot seven Inches
high, and for that Purpose had prepar'd a
Gage, by which they were to be measur'd:
That the good old Gentlewoman was not so
simple as to go into his Projects, she began
to smell a Rat. <Q>This <HI>Trim</HI> (quoth she)
is an odd sort of a Fellow, methinks he
makes a strange Figure with that ragged,
tatter'd Coar, appearing under his Livery,
can't he go spruce and clean, like the rest
of the Servants? The Fellow has a Roguish
Leer with him, which I don't like by any
means: besides, he has such a twang in his
Discourse, and an ungraceful way of speak∣ing
through the Nose, that one can hardly
understand him; I wish the Fellow be not
Tainted with some bad Disease.</Q> The Wit∣nesses
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
farther made Oath, That the said <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI>
lay out a Nights, and went abroad of∣ten
at unseasonable Hours; that it was credi∣bly
reported, he did Business in another Fa∣mily;
that he pretended to have a squeamish
Stomach, and could not eat at Table with
the rest of the Servants, tho' this was but
a pretence to provide some nice Bit for him∣self;
that he refus'd to Dine upon Salt-fish,
only to have an opportunity to eat a Calve's
Head (his Favourite Dish) in private; that
for all his tender Stomach, when he was got
by himself, he would devour Capons, Tur∣keys
and Sirloins of Beef, like a Cormorant.</P>
<P>Two other Witnesses gave the following
Evidence, That in his officious Attendance
upon his Mistress, he had try'd to slip in
a Powder into her Drink, and that once
he was catch'd endeavouring to stifle
her with a Pillow as she was a sleep; that
he and <HI>Ptschirnsooker</HI> were often in close
Conference, and that they us'd to drink to∣gether
at the <HI>Rose,</HI> where it seems he was
well enough known by the true Name of
<HI>Jack.</HI></P>
<P>The Prisoner had little to say in his De∣fence;
he endeavour'd to prove himself <HI>Alibi;</HI>
so that the Trial turn'd upon this single Que∣stion,
whether the said <HI>Timothy Trim</HI> and
<HI>Jack,</HI> were the same Person? which was
prov'd by such plain Tokens, and particu∣larly
by a Mole under the left Pap, that
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
there was no withstanding the Evidence;
therefore the Worshipful Mr. Justice com∣mitted
him, in order to his Tryal.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Jack's Friends came to visit him in Prison,
and what Advice they gave him.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JACK</HI> hitherto had pass'd in the World
for a poor, simple, well-meaning, half-witted,
crack'd-brain'd Fellow, People were
strangely surpriz'd to find him in such a
Roguery; that he should disguise himself
under a false Name, hire himself out for a
Servant to an old Gentlewoman, only for an
opportunity to Poison her. They said, That
it was more Generous to profess open En∣mity,
than, under a profound Dissimulation,
to be guilty of such a scandalous Breach of
Trust, and of the sacred Rights of Hospita∣lity.
In short, the Action was universally
Condemn'd by his best Friends; they told
him in plain terms, That this was come as a
Judgment upon him, for his loose Life, his
Gluttony, Drunkenness and Avarice, laying
aside his Father's <HI>Will</HI> in an old mouldy Trunk,
and turning Stock-jobber, News-monger,
and Busie-body, meddling with other Peoples
Affairs, shaking off his old serious Friends,
and keeping Company with Buffoons and
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Pick-pockets, his Father's sworn Enemies;
That he had best throw himself upon the
Mercy of the Court, Repent, and change his
Manners. To say truth, <HI>Jack</HI> heard these
Discourses with some Compunction; how∣ever
he resolv'd to try what his new Acquain∣tance
would do for him: They sent <HI>Habakkuk
Slyboots,</HI> who deliver'd him the following
Message, as the peremptory Commands of
his trusty Companions.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Habakkuk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Jack,</HI> I am sorry for thy
Misfortune; Matters have not been carried
on with due Secrecy; however, we must
make the best of a bad Bargain: Thou art in
the utmost Jeopardy, that's certain; Hang,
Draw and Quarter, are the gentlest things
they talk of. However, thy faithful Friends,
ever watchful for thy Security, bid me tell
thee, That they have one infallible Expedient
left to save thy Life: Thou must know, we
have got into some Understanding with the
Enemy, by the means of <HI>Don Diego Dismallo;</HI>
he assures us there is no Mercy for thee, and
that there is only one way left to Escape;
it is indeed somewhat out of the common
Road, however, be assur'd, it is the result of
most mature Deliberation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee tell me quickly, for my
Heart is sunk down into the very bottom of
my Belly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the unanimous Opinion of your
Friends, that you make as if you hang'd your
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
self; that they will give it out that you are
quite dead, and convey your Body out of
Prison in a Beir; and that <HI>John Bull,</HI> being
busied with his Law-Suit, will not enquire
further into the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>How d'ye mean, make as if I had
hang'd my self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you must really hang your
self up in a true genuine Rope, that there may
appear no Trick in it, and leave the rest to
your Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly this is a matter of some Con∣cern;
and my Friends, I hope, won't take
it ill, if I enquire a little into the means by
which they intend to deliver me: A Rope,
and a Noose, are no jesting Matters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so mistrustful? hast▪ thou ever
found us false to thee? I tell thee, there is one
ready to cut thee down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I presume to ask who it is that
is entrusted with that important Office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no end of thy How's and
thy Why's? that's a Secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Secret, perhaps, that I may be
safely trusted with, for I am not like to tell
it again. I tell you plainly, it is no strange
thing for a Man, before he hangs himself up,
to enquire who is to cut him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou suspicious Creature! if thou
must needs know it, I tell thee it is Sir <HI>Roger;</HI>
he has been in Tears ever since thy Misfor∣tune.
<HI>Don Diego</HI> and we have laid it so, that
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
he is to be in the next Room, and before
the Rope is well about thy Neck, rest satis∣fied,
he will break in, and cut thee down:
Fear not, old Boy; we'll do't, I'll warrant
thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I must hang my self up, upon
hopes that Sir <HI>Roger</HI> will cut me down, and
all this upon the Credit of <HI>Don Diego:</HI> A fine
Stratagem indeed to save my Life, that de∣pends
upon Hanging, <HI>Don Diego,</HI> and Sir
<HI>Roger!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee there is a Mystery in all
this, my Friend, a piece of profound Policy;
if thou knew what good this will do to the
Common Cause, thy Heart would leap for
Joy: I'm sure thou would not delay the Ex∣periment
one moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is to the Tune of <HI>All for the bet∣ter.</HI>
What's your Cause to me, when I am
hang'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Refractory Mortal! If thou wilt not
trust thy Friends, take what follows; know
assuredly, before next full Moon, that thou
wilt be hung up in Chains, or thy Quarters
perching upon the most conspicuous Places
of the Kingdom. Nay, I don't believe they
will be contented with Hanging, they talk
of Empaling, or breaking on the Wheel; and
thou chusest that, before a gentle suspending
of thy self, for one Minute. Hanging is not
so painful a thing as thou imagines. I have
spoke with several that have undergone it,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
they all agree it is no manner of uneasiness;
be sure thou take good notice of the Symp∣toms,
the Relation will be curious; it is but
a kick or two with thy Heels, and a wry
Mouth or so: Sir <HI>Roger</HI> will be with thee in
the twinkling of an Eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if Sir <HI>Roger</HI> should not
come? will my Friends be there to Succour
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubt it not; I will provide every
thing against to Morrow Morning, do thou
keep thy own Secret, say nothing: I tell
thee, it is absolutely necessary for the Com∣mon
Good, that thou shouldst go through this
Operation.</P>
</SP>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Jack hang'd himself up by the Perswasion
of his Friends, who broke their Word, and
left his Neck in the Noose.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JACK</HI> was a profess'd Enemy to <HI>Implicit
Faith,</HI> and yet I dare say, it was never
more strongly exerted, nor more basely abused,
than upon this occasion. He was now, with
his old Friends, in the state of a poor disband∣ed
Officer after a Peace; or rather a wounded
Soldier after a Battle; like an old Favourite
of a cunning Minister after the Jobb is over;
or a decay'd Beauty to a cloy'd Lover in
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
quest of new Game; or like an hundred such
things that one sees every Day. There were
new Intrigues, new Views, new Projects on
foot; <HI>Jack</HI>'s Life was the Purchase of <HI>Diego</HI>'s
Friendship, much good may it do them.
The Interest of <HI>Hocus</HI> and Sir <HI>Williams Crawly,</HI>
which was now more at Heart, made this
Operation upon poor <HI>Jack</HI> absolutely neces∣sary.
You may easily guess that his Rest that
Night was but small, and much disturb'd;
however the remaining part of his Time he
did not employ (as his Custom was former∣ly)
in Prayer, Meditation, or singing a double
Verse of a Psalm, but amused himself with
disposing of his Bank-Stock; many a Doubt,
many a Qualm, overspread his clouded Imagi∣nation.
<Q>Must I then (quoth he) hang up
my own personal, natural, individual Self,
with these two Hands! <HI>Durus Sermo!</HI>
What if I should be cut down, as my
Friends tell me? There is something Infa∣mous
in the very Attempt; the World
will conclude I had a guilty Conscience.
Is it possible that good Man, Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> can
have so much pity upon an unfortunate
Scoundrel, that has persecuted him so many
Years? No, it cannot be: I don't love Fa∣vours
that pass through <HI>Don Diego</HI>'s Hands.
On the other side, my Blood chills about
my Heart, at the thought of these Rogues,
with their bloody Hands grabbling in my
Guts, and pulling out my very Entrails:
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Hang it, for once I'll trust my Friends.</Q>
So <HI>Jack</HI> resolv'd, but he had done more wise∣ly,
to have put himself upon the Tryal of his
Country, made his Defence in Form; many
things happen between the Cup and the Lip,
Witnesses might have been brib'd, Juries ma∣nag'd,
or Prosecution stop'd. But so it was,
<HI>Jack</HI> for this time had a sufficient Stock of
Implicit Faith, which led him to his Ruin, as
the Sequel of the Story shews: And now the
fatal Day was come, in which he was to try
this hanging Experiment. His Friends did
not fail him at the appointed Hour, to see
it put in practice. <HI>Habakkuk</HI> brought him a
smooth, strong, tough Rope, made of many
a ply of wholesome <HI>Scandinavian</HI> Hemp,
compactly twisted together, with a Noose
that slip'd as glib as a Bird-catcher's Gin.
<HI>Jack</HI> shrunk and grew pale at first sight of it,
he handled it, measur'd it, stretch'd it, fix'd
it against the Iron-bar of the Window to
try its strength, but no Familiarity could re∣concile
him to it. He found fault with the
length, the thickness, and the twist, nay,
the very colour did not please him. <Q>Will
nothing less th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Hanging serve (quoth
<HI>Jack</HI>)? Won't my Enemies take Bail for my
good Behaviour? Will they accept of a Fine,
or be satisfied with the Pillory and Impri∣sonment,
a good round Whipping, or Burn∣ing
in the Cheek?</Q></P>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Habakkuk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but your Blood will
appease their Rage; make haste, else we
shall be discover'd: There's nothing like sur∣prising
the Rogues. How they will be
disappointed, when they hear that thou hast
hast prevented their Revenge, and hang'd
thine own self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but what if I should
do it in Effigies? Is there never an old Pope,
or Pretender, to hang up in my stead? we are
not so unlike, but it may pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>That can never be put upon Sir
<HI>Roger.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure he is in the next Room?
Have you provided a very sharp Knife, in
case of the worst?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dost take me for a common Lyar?
Be satisfy'd, no Damage can happen to your
Person, your Friends will take care of
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mayn't I quilt my Rope, it galls my
Neck strangely? besides, I don't like this
running Knot, it holds too tight, I may be
stifled all of a sudden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast so many If's and And's;
prithee dispatch; it might have been over be∣fore
this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, now I think on't, I would fain
settle some <HI>Affairs,</HI> for fear of the worst:
Have a little Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no having Patience, thou
art such a faintling, silly Creature.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>O thou most detestable, abominable,
<HI>Passive Obedience!</HI> did I ever imagine I should
become thy Votary, in so pregnant an Instance;
how will my Brother <HI>Martin</HI> laugh at this
Story, to see himself out done in his own
Calling? He has taken the Doctrine, and
left me the Practice. No sooner had he ut∣ter'd
these Words, but like a Man of true
Courage, he ty'd the fatal Cord to the Beam,
fitted the Noose, and mounted upon the bot∣tom
of a Tub, the inside of which he had
often Grac'd in his prosperous Days. This
Footstool <HI>Habakkuk</HI> kick'd away, and left poor
<HI>Jack</HI> swinging, like the Pendulum of <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Clock. The fatal Noose perform'd its Office,
and with most strict Ligature, squeez'd the
Blood into his Face, 'till it assum'd a purple
dye: While the poor Man, heav'd from the
very bottom of his Belly for Breath, <HI>Haba∣kuk</HI>
walk'd with great Deliberation into both
the upper and lower Room, to acquaint his
Friends, who receiv'd the News with great
Temper, and with Geers and Scoffs instead
of Pity, <HI>Jack</HI> has Hang'd himself (quoth they!)
let us go and see how the poor Rogue swings.
Then they call'd Sir <HI>Roger.</HI> Sir <HI>Roger</HI> (quoth
<HI>Habakkuk) Jack</HI> has hang'd himself, make haste
and cut him down. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> turn'd first
one Ear and then t'other, not understanding
what he said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you <HI>Jack</HI> has hang'd himself up.</P>

<P>I thought this had not been hanging Day.</P>

<P>But the poor Fellow has hang'd him∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Roger.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then let him hang. I don't won∣der
at it, the Fellow has been mad these
twenty Years. With this he slunk away.</P>

<P>Then <HI>Jack</HI>'s Friends began to hunch and
push one another, <HI>Why don't you go and cut
the poor Fellow down? Why don't you? and
why don't you? Not I</HI> (quoth one,) <HI>not I</HI>
(quoth another,) <HI>not I</HI> (quoth a third,) <HI>he
may hang 'till Doomsday before I relieve him.</HI>
Nay it is credibly reported, that they were
so far from succouring their poor Friend, in
this his dismal Circumstance, that <HI>Ptschirn∣sooker,</HI>
and several of his Companions, went
in and pull'd him by the Legs, and thump'd
him on the Breast. Then they began to rail at
him for the very thing which they had both
advis'd and justify'd before, <HI>viz.</HI> his getting in∣to
the old Gentlewoman's Family, and putting
on her Livery. The Keeper, who perform'd
the last Office, coming up, found <HI>Jack</HI> swing∣ing,
with no Life in him; he took down the
Body gently and laid it on a Bulk, and
brought out the Rope to the Company. <HI>This,
Gentlemen, is the Rope that hang'd</HI> Jack;
<HI>What must be done with it?</HI> Upon which
they order'd it to be laid among the Curi∣osities
of <HI>Gresham</HI> College, and it is call'd
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<HI>Jack</HI>'s Rope to this very Day. However
<HI>Jack</HI> after all, had some small Tokens of
Life in him, but lies at this time past hopes
of a total Recovery, with his Head hang∣ing
on one Shoulder, without Speech or Mo∣tion.
The Coroners Inquest supposing him
Dead, brought him in <HI>Non Compos.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Conference between Don Diego Dismallo,
and John Bull.</HEAD>
<P>DUring the time of the foregoing Trans∣action,
<HI>Don Diego</HI> was entertaining
<HI>John Bull.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, this Day's Proceed∣ing
will convince you of the Sincerity of your
old Friend <HI>Diego,</HI> and the Treachery of Sir
<HI>Roger.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been endeavouring,
for several Years, to have Justice done upon
that Rogue <HI>Jack;</HI> but what through the Re∣missness
of Constables, Justices and pack'd
Juries, he has always found the Means to
escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider then, who is your best
Friend, he that would have brought him to
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
condign Punishment, or he that has sav'd him.
By my Perswasion, <HI>Jack</HI> had hang'd himself,
if Sir <HI>Roger</HI> had not cut him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you that Sir <HI>Roger</HI> has
done so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to receive me coldly;
methinks my Services deserve a better Re∣turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you value your self upon
Hanging this poor Scoundrel, I tell you, when
I have any more Hanging-work, I'll send
for thee; I have some better Employment for
Sir <HI>Roger:</HI> In the mean time, I desire the poor
Fellow may be look'd after. When he first
came out of the North-Country into my Fa∣mily,
under the pretended Name of <HI>Timothy
Trim,</HI> the Fellow seem'd to mind his Loom
and his Spinning-wheel, till some body turn'd
his Head; then he grew so pragmatical, that
he took upon him the Government of my
whole Family: I could never order any thing,
within or without doors, but he must be
always giving his Counsel, sorsooth: Never∣theless,
tell him, I will forgive what is
past; and if he would mind his Business for
the future, and not meddle out of his own
Sphere, he will find that <HI>John Bull</HI> is not of
a cruel Disposition,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet all your skilful Physicians
say, that nothing can recover your Mother,
but a piece of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Liver boil'd in her Soup.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those are Quacks: My Mother
abhors such Canibal's Food; she is in perfect
He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lth at present: I would have given ma∣ny
a good Pound to have had her so well
some time ago. There are, indeed, two or
three troublesome old Nurses, that because
they believe I am tender-hearted, will never
let me have a quiet Nights Rest, with knock∣ing
me up: Oh, Sir, your Mother is taken
extremely ill! she is fall'n into a fainting Fit!
she has a great Emptiness, and wants Suste∣nance!
This is only to recommend them∣selves,
for their great Care. <HI>John Bull,</HI> as
simple as he is, understands a little of a
Pulse.</P>
