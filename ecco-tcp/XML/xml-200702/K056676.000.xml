<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T will be necessary to enter a little into the History of our Trade with
<HI>France,</HI> for the last 40 or 45 Years: And because some Period of Time is
proper in all such Cases to take a Rise from, it shall be placed at the
Year 1660. If any think that Time is not sufficiently remote, they shall
be fairly followed, let them go back as far as they please: In the mean
while, I must take Notice to the <HI>Reader,</HI> that the Particulars are too copious and exten∣sive,
and especially their Numbers so pressing; that no Time or Room can be spar'd
for <HI>Preambles,</HI> and <HI>Introductions.</HI></P>
<P>About the Year 1660, the general Book of Rates was made in <HI>England,</HI> according
to an Act of Parliament, whereby a Subsidy of Tonnage was laid on <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Bran∣dies,</HI>
and a Subsidy of Poundage after the Rate of 5 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> upon all Goods and Mer∣chandizes
Imported.</P>
<P>In Imitation of this, in the Year 1664, the <HI>French</HI> made a General <HI>Tariff</HI> or Book
of Rates, wherein they followed us in Rating all Goods and Merchandizes at a Tax
of about 5<HI>l. per Cent. ad Valorem,</HI> except that, for the Encouragement of their own
People to improve in Trade and Manufactures, all the Manufactures of <HI>Silk, Gold, Silver,
Hair, Thread,</HI> and <HI>Wool,</HI> were Rated at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> according to their Value. This <HI>Tariff</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
was es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed by all the Nations in these parts of Europe, to be very easy, and not
the least Interruption to their Trade with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Reader</HI> may see at once what was paid upon our <HI>English Manufactures</HI> by
that <HI>Tariff,</HI> and what has been laid on in <HI>France</HI> since that time, the foregoing Table
is plac'd at the begining of this Paper; and also, as what there will be Occasion often
to mention, and refer to: Out of which the <HI>Whale-bone, Fins,</HI> and <HI>Oyl,</HI> might have
been omitted; because we have no Share of that Trade: But as it may be useful for
the Information of some People, the whole is above Incerted.</P>
<P>All our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> Exported from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> are reduced to the
old Duties payable by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664. Except <HI>Broad-Cloth</HI> and <HI>Serges,</HI> which are
to pay, (as by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1699) (that also being capable of being moderated by Com∣missioners)
thus:</P>
<P><HI>Broad-Cloth,</HI> which from the Year 1667, paid 80 <HI>Livres,</HI> will now pay only 55 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>Mill'd <HI>Serges,</HI> which paid 15 <HI>Livres,</HI> now 11 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>All other wollen Goods pay after the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, (as aforesaid,) when their
<HI>Wines</HI> paid Duty here but 7 <HI>l. 10 s. per Ton,</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> but 1 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI></P>
<P>This part being thus stated, let us turn the Tables, and view the other side of the Trade,
(viz.) Our Import from <HI>France,</HI> where the Particulars will be very surprizing; and this
following Conclusion is most natural there from, (viz.) That if we Traded with <HI>France</HI>
to our Advantage before, much more must we do so now; for the State of the Trade
between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> stands thus.</P>
<P>An Account of the several Duties which were payable upon <HI>French</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>England</HI>
from <HI>France</HI> at the Year 1664, and of the Duties payable upon the same Goods after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he

<P>Every True <HI>Britain,</HI> whose Concern is for his Countries Interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must look upon
this Table of Duties with great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The setting this Account against the former, clears up <HI>the Treaty of Commerce</HI> so ef∣fectually,
that farther Enlargements must seem unnecessary: Nevertheless, since, Mat∣ters
of Fact concur, it shall next be shewed what Regard Her Majesty has had to the
other Trading-Interest of Her Subjects: How the Ports of <HI>France</HI> are opened to Them
upon equal Terms with the <HI>French</HI> Subjects themselves, and that even in some things
prejudicial so themselves, as in the Levant Trade in particular.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hudsons Bay</HI> Company Pray, that the <HI>French</HI> may surrender all the Forts and Set∣tlements
in <HI>Hudsons Bay</HI> and <HI>Straight,</HI> and be obliged to renounce all Right and Pre∣tensions
thereto for the Future.</P>
<P>Granted.</P>

The <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Levant Company</HI> Pray, that They may have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erty of Trade
in <HI>France</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> themselves, and not to pay higher Duties than by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of
1664.</P>
<P>Granted.</P>
<P>And that They be allowed to carry Goods to all Parts of <HI>France</HI> from the <HI>Levant</HI> di∣rectly,
or the Goods of the <HI>Levant</HI> (viz.) <HI>Raw Silks,</HI> &amp;c. from <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Granted,</HI> as in 1664.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-India Company</HI> Pray, that the Prohibitions and high Duties laid in <HI>France</HI>

<P>The <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants Pray, That the <HI>Tobacco</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations be Impor∣ted

to the <HI>Farmers.</HI></P>

the Commissioners.</P>
<P><HI>Lyme Regis</HI> Prays, The Prohibition of Woollen Manufactures, and the high Duties laid
in <HI>France,</HI> may be taken off, and the said Goods be Imported into <HI>France,</HI> as formerly,</P>

<P>The Merchants of <HI>Bristol</HI> Pray, The same as above from <HI>Lyme;</HI> as also that Tonage
of Ships be abolished on both Sides.</P>
<P>Granted,</P>
<P>And that all our Merchants be permitted to Buy and Sell <HI>Tobacco</HI> in <HI>France</HI> under
moderate Customs, without being subjected to the Farmers.</P>
<P>Referred to the Commissioners.</P>
<P>That nothing might be wanting to secure to <HI>Great Britain</HI> a compleat Freedom of their
Trade to <HI>France;</HI> all the Advantages of the Treaties <HI>France</HI> has made with other Na∣tions,
are contained in this Treaty, and all the Privileges stipulated for them, are by
her Majesty's Care for her Subjects Profit made our own, as by the <HI>Eighth</HI> and other
<HI>Article<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> whereby it is stipulated, that her Majesty's Subjects shall be Treated in <HI>France</HI>
in the same manner as the Nations they most favoured, and even as the <HI>French</HI> King's
own Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Ninth Article <HI>adds,</HI> And all Prohibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations, Decrees made
in <HI>France</HI> since the said <HI>Tariff,</HI> of 1664 contrary thereunto, in Respect of the Goods and Mer∣chandizes
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> shall be repealed.</P>
<P>As to this it is objected; that it is not said <HI>Goods and Merchandizes of the Subjects of</HI>
Great Britain, but <HI>Goods and Merchandizes of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>which implyes</HI> (say they) <HI>the
Manufactures of</HI> Great Britain <HI>only.</HI> But the Absurdity here is so gross, that it is strange
the Wisdom of the <HI>Turkey Company</HI> should fall into it: For (1.) if it had been meant of
the Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> only, it would have been said, <HI>The</HI> GROWTH <HI>and</HI>
PRODUCE, <HI>not the Goods and Merchandizes.</HI> By Growth and Produce, indeed the
Manufactures had been understood; but by the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> must be understood, the Goods and Merchandizes, which the Subjects
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> TRADE IN. But (2.) it is out of Question, That if the taking
off the Prohibitions, &amp;c. of the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was meant
only of the Manufactures, then was the whole <HI>Levant Trade</HI> prohibited still; which
the Gentlemen do not pretend to.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the Construction the Company would have put on▪ the Words
of the 9th. <HI>Article,</HI> (viz.) Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Britain,</HI> would be the Ruin of that
very Trade which they Petition to support, and would Prohibit all their <HI>Levant</HI> Goods
in <HI>France.</HI> Such People, like Children, must be dealt with by the Nature of things, and
must have given them not always what they DO ask, but what they WOULD ask.</P>

Some Considerations might be offered here, upon the <HI>Turkey</HI> Companies desiring the
Liberty to carry their <HI>Raw Silk</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France;</HI> and yet at the same time Pe∣tition
that the Silk Manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctures here should receive Encouragement, as if carrying
the Silk abroad (which is a means to keep up the Price of Silk) should at the same time
be a means to encourage the Weavers and Manufacturers of <HI>Silk</HI> in this Kingdom. This
Mystery is referr'd to them to unfold. Also the Consistency of their desiring to supply
<HI>France</HI> with <HI>Raw Silk,</HI> at the same time that they desire the Silk Manufactures of <HI>France</HI>
should not be encouraged.</P>
<P>In general, all the <HI>Memorials, Petitions,</HI> and <HI>Representations</HI> given in, as well from
publick Bodies of Men, as from private Merchants, do allow, that if the <HI>Priviledges,
Advantages, Abatements</HI> of <HI>Duties,</HI> &amp;c. which they request, or represent as needful▪ may
be obtained, there will be a great and beneficial Trade driven from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France.</HI></P>

It would be reasonable here to desire those People who insist so much upon this Re∣serve
of <HI>Cloths</HI> and <HI>Serges</HI> out of the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, to consider what the exception
amounts to, and how far it may hurt the Trade, that they may Judge whether the
Damage is equal to the Complaint: To this purpose the Difference in the <HI>Serges</HI> is set
down again here; (viz.) That the <HI>Serges</HI> which paid 10 Livres in 1664, and were af∣terwards
brought to 15, and then to 24, and after that prohibited, may now be freely Im∣ported
into <HI>France</HI> paying only 11 Livres, that is to say, one Livre advance upon a
piece of 15 Ells; and the Difference upon <HI>Cloths</HI> is, that the Piece which paid 40
Livres before, in 1664, must pay now 55, being 15 Livres upon about 31 Yards <HI>English</HI>
Measure.</P>
<P>To make this Estimate more plain, it is to be noted, that the <HI>Ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> mention'd in all
these Cases is to be understood the <HI>French Ell</HI> containing 5 Quarters of the <HI>English</HI> Yard,
and so the Account of the Exception of <HI>Cloths,</HI> and <HI>Cloth Serges,</HI> may be read thus.</P>
<P><HI>Cloths per piece</HI> containing 25 <HI>Ells,</HI> that is, 31 <HI>English Yards</HI> and a <HI>Quarter,</HI> to pay 15
<HI>Livres</HI> more than by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664.</P>
<P><HI>Cloth Serges per piece</HI> containing 15 <HI>Ells,</HI> that is 18 <HI>Yards</HI> and 3 <HI>Quarters,</HI> to pay 1
<HI>Livre</HI> more than by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664.</P>
<P>Considering Men, when they come to weigh this, will be apt to wonder what it is
the Trading part of this Nation have been so much allarm'd at in the Treaty with
<HI>France,</HI> and will hardly be brought to believe that the Complaints which have been
made of ruining our <HI>Manufactures</HI> and encouraging the <HI>French,</HI> should all be raised from
these small Differences.</P>
<P>Would these People turn the <HI>Tables,</HI> and make the Case of <HI>France</HI> here the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r own, what
loud Complaints would they make in <HI>England,</HI> if any <HI>Manufactures</HI> which our own Peo∣ple
were endeavouring to make at home, should have been admitted by the Treaty
from <HI>France,</HI> with alike small Advance on the <HI>French</HI> Goods more than they paid in
1664. Whereas every body is sensible that the <HI>French</HI> are to pay here upon all their
Goods 2, 3, 4 or 500<HI>l. per Cent</HI> higher Duties than they paid in 1664, and in some Goods
much more. Had these advanced Duties been taken off, how would they alledge that
Foreigners were encouraged; that the Bread was taken out of the Mouths of our own Peo∣ple;
that the Importing <HI>Manufactures</HI> from abroad, which we could make at Home, was
taking away the Employment from our own Poor to give to the <HI>French:</HI> Yet this is
the Case here. The <HI>French</HI> have given all the Encouragment they could to their Peo∣ple
to fall upon the making the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> it is supposed
none can blame them for that; some steps they have taken in it which promised them
Success, while the Duties of 80 <HI>Livres</HI> and 120 <HI>Livres</HI> were laid on <HI>English Cloths;</HI> and
yet even then, great Quantities of <HI>English Cloth</HI> were carried into <HI>France,</HI> which obli∣ged
the King of <HI>France</HI> at last, to make a Prohibition of <HI>English Woollon Manufactures</HI>
in general, (viz) in the Year 1701.</P>
<P>But after all these <HI>Advances</HI> in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King being obli∣ged
by the Necessity of his Affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs to make a Peace, has yielded to such a Peace as
opens the Door into <HI>France</HI> for the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at the same
Rate of <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> as they paid 49 Years ago, long before his own People m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de
any considerable Attempt that way; having excepted or reserved but two species of
<HI>Manufactures,</HI> and upon them has only advanced about 2 or 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>There is ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly a <HI>Manufacture</HI> Erected by us in <HI>Britain</HI> in the memory of Man,
but that if the high <HI>Duties</HI> laid upon Forreign Goods of the same kind were taken
off, or within 2 or 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of what they were before, would be ruin'd, and the Un∣dertakers
thereof must lay them down: If the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Paper, Linnen Cloth,
Canvas,</HI> or <HI>Sail Cloth,</HI> and many other things were heard to this, it is believed they would
all acknowledge the Truth of it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
But the <HI>French</HI> King is obliged by this <HI>Treaty,</HI> what Discouragement soever it may
be to his own Subjects and their <HI>Manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to take off all his Prohibitions and
high Duties, and give all the <HI>English Manufactures</HI> a free Entrance into his Country, upon
the same easy Duties they paid in the Year 1664, except two sorts only, (viz.) <HI>Cloth,</HI>
and <HI>Cloth Serges.</HI></P>
<P>That this may admit of no <HI>Dispute,</HI> the Affirmative leads to the particular sorts of
our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> which by this <HI>Treaty</HI> may be carryed into <HI>France</HI> by the Rule
of the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Spanish Cloths, Serges, <HI>not</HI> Cloth-Serges, Double Bays, Single Bays, Says, Perpetuana's, Spanish
Draggets, <HI>all sorts of</HI> Norwich Stuff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Linsey-Woolseys, Kiderminster Stuffs, Shalloons, Chenys, Peny∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>es,

of</HI> Wool, <HI>and wrought in</HI> Great Britain, <HI>all are reduced by this</HI> Tariff <HI>to the Duties paya∣ble
in</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>What has been said of the Liberty of Commerce obtained by the Treaty with <HI>France,</HI>
the Reduction of the Duties in <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, and the Reserve or Limi∣tation
of two Species of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> only, (viz) of <HI>Broad Cloths</HI> and <HI>Serges,</HI> to a small
Advance of Duty; has been more than sufficient to explain those things to any Mens
Understandings, which are not politically dull: Unless these People expected that her
Majesty should have made a Condition with the <HI>French</HI> King, that his Subjects should
make no <HI>Woollen Cloth,</HI> or that when they had made it, they should not export it to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> for fear of prejudicing our <HI>Levant</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>If the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turkey</HI> hold their <HI>Cloths</HI> up to equal Price with the <HI>English,</HI>
no Buyer will take them, except when a sufficient Quantity of <HI>English Cloth</HI> cannot be
had to supply the Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>French Cloths</HI> being inferiour to the <HI>English</HI> in Quality, are for that Reason, and
no other, Sold in <HI>Turkey</HI> at a lower Price.</P>
<P>It is evident that the <HI>French</HI> want the Materials, (viz) the <HI>Wool,</HI> especially in those
parts of <HI>France</HI> where their <HI>Cloths</HI> for the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade are made; and whither the
<HI>English</HI> or <HI>Irish Wool</HI> which they get by Stealth, cannot be carried without very great
Expence; and that the <HI>Wool</HI> they make use of instead thereof, and to mix with the <HI>Spa∣nish
Wool,</HI> is of an inferiour Quality to the <HI>English Wool,</HI> they themselves will not deny.
But if these were not so, and they were to make <HI>Cloth</HI> wholly of <HI>Spanish Wool,</HI> or of
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Spanish Wool</HI> mixt, yet the general Way of Workmanship of the <HI>French</HI> Na∣tion,
is known to be slighter and looser in all their <HI>Manufactures,</HI> than the <HI>Manufa∣ctures</HI>
of the like kind made here, and that our Workmen perform almost all kinds of
Work-firmer and more sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>antial, not only than the <HI>French,</HI> but also than any other
People. So that our <HI>Cloths,</HI> and even all our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> will Sell for a better
Price, than <HI>Manufactures</HI> of the same Denomination from other Countries.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Silk Manufactures,</HI> they have such a sufficient Provision, made for them,
and such Encouragement given them already by the high Duties on Foreign wrought
<HI>Silks,</HI> as well of <HI>France</HI> as of any other Country, that as they stood in no need of Pro∣hibitions
during the War, so they stand in need of no farther Assistance during the
Peace.</P>
<P>For this Reason, as they have nothing to ask but that those Duties should remain;
so the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> has taken none of them away; and if the <HI>Silk Manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
cannot subsist with that Difference upon them which those Duties have laid, neither
would they subsist with a Total Prohibition.</P>
<P>It is observable, that during the said high Duties, particularly upon <HI>Alamodes,</HI> and
<HI>Lustrings,</HI> none of them have been Imported here, that is, legally Imported; as for
Clandestine Importation, or Running of Goods, that can be no Argument, because nei∣ther
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
can the Quantity be great, or is it possible entirely to prevent those things either
in this Country or in any other. The Difference between the Manufactures of <HI>Silk</HI>
at home, and those imported, stands thus:</P>
<P>Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> of all kinds, pay for every 20 pound Weight, <HI>L. 12. 3. 7. Netts Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lustrings,</HI> pay for every 20 pound Weight, <HI>L. 31. 17. 3. Nett Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Now if the Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> pay above 12 <HI>Shillings per Pound</HI> Weight, Duty up∣on
Importation, all Discounts taken off; the Disadvantage which they must lie under,
must exceedingly lessen that Importation, and seems sufficient not only to encourage,
but to quicken the Industry of our own <HI>Weavers.</HI></P>
<P>But since the Encouragement of the <HI>Silk</HI> Trade, and Employment of the <HI>Weavers</HI>
is spoken of as a thing of such extraordinary Weight, it may be very necessary to state
the Case of <HI>Manufacturing</HI> in general, that our Opinion of things may be rightly bal∣lanc'd.</P>
<P>It
is an undoubted Rule of Trade, that the Employment of our own Poor, and Con∣sumption
of our own Growth, is the first Principal of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and should be the last
End of all our National Improvement.</P>
<P>As <HI>Great Britain</HI> is stated in Matters of Trade, this Concern for the General Inte∣rest
of that Trade, centers upon our <HI>Woollen Manufacture:</HI> There is a just Concern
due to every Branch of Trade, but to that most, which most contributes to, and is
most essential, in the two great Ends of Trade above-mentioned; (viz) <HI>Employment of
the People, and Consumption of the Produce.</HI> This the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> is so far supe∣rior
in, to all other Branches of our <HI>Commerce,</HI> as admits of no Comparison; and
therefore the principal Concern of the Nation is, and ought to be the <HI>Woollen Manufacture.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, Prudence may so guide, as that this Concern for the <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI>
tho' it be with a Preference to all our other Goods, yet may not be in Opposition to
them; there being a manifest Difference between, shewing a peculiar Regard to one, and
injuring the other; as a Man having many Children, may shew a peculiar Affection
to his eldest, without injuring the rest: But then, on the other hand, neither must
any of the other Branches of Trade claim or expect such a Regard or Concern to be
shewn to them, as should be injurious to the <HI>Woollen Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Silk</HI> Trade is useful and advantageous, but <HI>Silk</HI> is a modern <HI>Manufacture,</HI> and
is useful and advantageous, as it is a Return for, and encourages the Exportation of
the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> and no otherwise: The <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> is the Eldest
Child of the Nation's <HI>Commerce:</HI> The <HI>Silk</HI> Trade is a Foster-Child taken into the
Family, made useful and meriting to be encouraged, but always with a Subserviency
to the Good of the Heir.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants drive any considerable Trade to <HI>France</HI> with raw <HI>Silk,</HI> whe∣ther
from <HI>England</HI> by Re-Exportations, or from the <HI>Levant</HI> directly; the <HI>Silk</HI> they car∣ry,
it is allowed, must be the Product of <HI>English Manufactures;</HI> so that by that Method,
not only our own <HI>Silks,</HI> but, even the <HI>French Silks</HI> also, as to the Materials they are
made of, are the Product and Return of the <HI>English Woollen Manufactures.</HI> The next
Difference is the Workmanship, which lies thus, that one is perform'd by the <HI>French,</HI>
whom we ought to have no Regard to in Trade; the other is perform'd by our own
People, whom we ought to support.</P>
<P>But granting this; if on the other hand, a Bale of wrought <HI>Silks</HI> should be brought
from <HI>France,</HI> bought there with a Bale or Bales of <HI>Spanish Cloth,</HI> or other <HI>Woollen
Goods,</HI> it is easy to prove that it is more our Interest to bring over that Bale of wrought
<HI>Silk;</HI> and that the said wrought <HI>Silks</HI> are more our own <HI>Manufacture,</HI> than if they
had been wrought in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> because the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> which were first
sent to <HI>Turky</HI> to purchase the raw <HI>Silk,</HI> which this Bale of <HI>Silks</HI> was wrought from,
and the <HI>Spanish Cloths</HI> or other <HI>Woollen Goods</HI> sent to <HI>France</HI> to purchase the said <HI>Silks,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
when wrought, not only consumed the Growth of <HI>England,</HI> but employed above Six∣teen
times the Number of People in their making, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> more than the Bale of wrought
<HI>Silks</HI> would have done, if they had been made in <HI>Spittle-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, this implies no Danger at all to the <HI>English Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Silk,</HI>
because tho' the Humours and Fancies of some expensive People may run them upon buy∣ing
Foreign wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> yet while the high Duties here remain as they are to do by
the <HI>Treaty,</HI> the Difference of Price will be always such as will lessen the Demand of
Foreign <HI>Silks,</HI> restrain the Humour aforesaid to a few People, and preserve the Bulk
of the <HI>Manufacture</HI> in our hands.</P>
<P>It is objected by some, That the Difference is not sufficient; that notwithstanding
12 <HI>l. 3 s. 7 d.</HI> to be paid upon the Importation for every 20 Pound Weight of wrought
<HI>Silks,</HI> yet that the <HI>French</HI> will bring in their <HI>Silks.</HI> But this amounts to no more than
this (viz) That they will bring in some few: Which is what as above, may be to
our Advantage. But they will not pretend, that the Difference of the said Duty shall
not lessen that Importation, and reduce it to a small Quantity, and that the Gross of
the Trade shall remain in our own hands.</P>
<P>The Substance of the Petitions of the <HI>Silk Weavers,</HI> and of others who pretend to ap∣pear
in their Behalf, is in short this, That the Importation of <HI>French</HI> wrought <HI>Silks</HI>
may be prevented: The Pretence to make their Petitioning national, is the Danger,
they say appears, that <HI>French</HI> wrought <HI>Silks</HI> will now, by Virtue of <HI>the Treaty of Com∣merce,</HI>
be imported in great Quantities into <HI>Britain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> being able to un∣der-work
us, will also Under-sell us, and the Weavers thereby be ruin'd.</P>
<P>What Foundation there is to support these Things, will appear, upon making a few
Enquiries into matters of Fact; and some just Calculation of the Proportions of one to
the other.</P>
<P>The Affairs of the high Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies upon wrought <HI>Silks</HI> Imported, is given in Answer to
the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and seems to make their Apprehensions appear very irrational: Above
31<HI>s. per Pound</HI> Duty on the Importation must be paid upon <HI>Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lustrings,</HI> and
above 12<HI>s. per Pound</HI> upon all other wrought <HI>Silks;</HI> except <HI>Italian Silks</HI> Imported in <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Ships, which pay Duty 10 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI></P>
<P>The Force of Reason prevailed in the first, and the <HI>Weavers</HI> have given it up,
owning at the Bar of the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> that the Difference is sufficient in the <HI>A∣lamodes</HI>
and <HI>Lustrings,</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> can do them no harm there; but it seems they
think 12 <HI>s.</HI> or 10 <HI>s 6 d. per pound</HI> too little upon the other wrought <HI>Silks:</HI> But they ei∣ther
did not know, or omitted to take notice, that the Raw <HI>Silk</HI> which those <HI>French</HI>
Goods are made of, pays Sixteen <HI>Livres per pound</HI> Duty at the first Importation into
<HI>France;</HI> that the wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> when shipp'd again to be brought hither, pay 5<HI>l. per
Cent.</HI> Custom <HI>ad Valorem</HI> upon their Exportation, both by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664; and that
the other Charges, such as Transportation by Land-Carriage to the Ports they are shipp'd
at, Commission for <HI>Buying, Fraight, Risque</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> &amp;c. cannot be so little as 5 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> more. So that here is about 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more upon the Value of the Goods to
be added to the Difference of <HI>12s.</HI> or <HI>10s. 6 d. per pound;</HI> all which put together,
makes such a Weight upon the Foreign wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> and gives such an Advantage
to the <HI>English Weavers,</HI> that it is wonderful to think they should complain.</P>
<P>To add to the Conviction of these Things, it shall be a little examin'd, what effect
this Difference has already had upon the <HI>Silk</HI> Trade; from whence may be Estimated
some thing of what may be expected for the time to come.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weavers</HI> said Themselves, at the Committee of the House of Commons, that they
make to the Value of Three hundred thousand Pounds every Year, in <HI>Black Silks</HI> only;
whether it be Truth or not, is not easy to be examined: But in this Case, if they al∣low
it, we are not to question it, for if it be an Error, it is against themselves; their
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Quantity of other <HI>Silks</HI> they spake of as prodigiously great. It cannot be amiss to
observe then, what Quantity of Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> have been imported here from
all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> under our high <HI>Duties,</HI> and see what Proportion they bear to the
Quantity which these People say they make at Home, whether these Foreign wrought
<HI>Silks</HI> have been <HI>French</HI> or no, is not the Case; The <HI>Duties</HI> are near the same; and as they
are Imported from Countries to which <HI>France</HI> had an open Trade, it is not improbable
many <HI>French Silks</HI> have been among them, and if more has not come in, the Difference
made by the <HI>Duties</HI> have been the apparent and only Reason, and the same Reason
must hold good still, as long as the same <HI>Duties</HI> remain.</P>

<P>All that can be alledged against this is, to beg the <HI>Question</HI> and say, <HI>That There will
be more Imported now;</HI> but before that can be allowed, they should shew a good Reason
why more was not Imported in these Years above-stated, being the Quantity from <HI>I∣taly</HI>
was always much greater, before the raising the <HI>Duties</HI> here; and that Reason
which is good for preventing the Importation from <HI>Italy,</HI> will be good for preventing it
from any other Country.</P>
<P>What has been said against the Reason of this, is so little to the Purpose, and with
such little Force, that it is worth no Notice, the Facts are so clearly made out, that
they amount even to Demonstration: The high Duties have effectually check'd the im∣portation
of wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> and will do so still. If the <HI>French</HI> had their <HI>raw Silks</HI> chea∣per
than we have it, how comes it to pass, that so much weight has been put upon
the <HI>Levant</HI> Company's obtaining a Liberty of Exporting <HI>Raw Silk</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France?</HI>
which is obtain'd for them by the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and which the Company are now fully sa∣tisfied,
is settled to their advantages. If the <HI>French</HI> had <HI>raw Silks</HI> cheaper than the <HI>English,</HI>
it would be absur'd to spake of our sending <HI>raw Silks</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France.</HI> Goods
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
are shipped from Port to Port, to mend their Market, not to lessen their Value; if our
Merchants did not advance the Price, they would never send their Goods abroad.</P>
<P>Not only the <HI>French</HI> have not their raw <HI>Silk</HI> Cheaper than <HI>England;</HI> but on the con∣trary,
<HI>England</HI> has their <HI>raw Silks</HI> cheaper than all the World; those Countries excep∣ted,
who have it of their own; and this will appear, by the great Quantity of <HI>raw
Silk</HI> Exported from <HI>England</HI> to other Countries; as also of <HI>Mohair Yarn,</HI> which is equal∣ly
concern'd in the <HI>Argument;</HI> and the following <HI>Abstract</HI> of One Year may give a
specimen.</P>

<P>It would be an unaccountable Trade, if it should be true, that other Nations had
<HI>Raw Silk</HI> cheaper than we have it, when at the same time they should buy such Quan∣tities
of it every Year from us.</P>
<P>If any Nation in the World can have <HI>Raw Silk</HI> cheaper than <HI>England, Italy</HI> may be
thought to be the Place, because they have great Quantities (<HI>Sicily</HI> included) of <HI>Silks</HI>
of their own Growth. It will be hard to assign a Reason why <HI>Italy,</HI> who have
<HI>Silk</HI> of their own, and with whom our Trade has been always open, should by our
high Duties be obstructed from sending their wrought <HI>Silks</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who
buy great Quantities of <HI>Silk</HI> from us, should not.</P>
<P>As the like Arts have been made use of to possess the People with an Opinion, that
the Interest of <HI>Britain</HI> has been neglected with respect to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, which
were before employ'd in that of the <HI>French;</HI> so it will easily be made appear, it has been
done with the like Weakness, and 'tis hop'd it shall be with the like Success.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That the Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Treaty</HI> formerly made with <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI>
and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subsisting, are inconsistent with one another; That the Effect of the

<P>It is needful to go back and look into the former State of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, before
the late <HI>Treaty,</HI> and enquire into the Nature and Reason of the Alterations, Additions
and Encreases, which have been Accidents to that Trade, and which have brought it
from what it was, to what it now is; in which, if the Causes assign'd for it's Encrease
are mistaken, the Notions we entertain of such and such things endangering its Decrease,
will appear equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly groundless.</P>
<P>Two general and Vulgar Errors, or Mistakes, are entertained among us relating to
the first part of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade; (viz) what it was before the <HI>Treaty</HI> with <HI>Portugal;</HI>
and two more relating to what it now is, or will be by reason of the <HI>Peace.</HI> The Mi∣stakes
about what it was, are (1) That the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had prohibited all our <HI>Woolllen Ma∣nufactures.</HI>
(2) That the Encrease of our Trade or Export to <HI>Portugal,</HI> was occasioned
by, and depended upon the Encrease of our Demand for Their Wines. Our Mistakes
about what the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade is now, or is like to be, are, (1) That upon our reducing
the Duties of <HI>French Wine</HI> by the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>France</HI> to an Equality with the
<HI>Portuguese Wines,</HI> the <HI>Wine</HI> Trade from <HI>Portugal</HI> will be ruined, and we shall import no more.
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
(2) That upon this, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> will immediately prohibit our <HI>Woollen Manufactures;</HI>
and so that great Trade which it is alledged, tho' falsly too, Exports two Millions Year∣ly
in the <HI>Growth</HI> and <HI>Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will be lost.</P>
<P>If every one of these may be clearly proved to be Mistakes, and that neither the
things suggested, or the Consequences drawn from them, can be supported by Truth
or Reason, then all our Uneasiness about this <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade; will appear causeless and
ill grounded. To do this, there needs no more than to state Matters of Fact; and
give such Proofs of every thing as the Case will admit.</P>
<P>1. That all our <HI>Woolen Manufactures</HI> were Prohibited before the War, is a Mistake;
and truly this is a Mistake of such a Nature, so obvious, and so easy to be confuted,
that it is wonderful it should be expected by any body to do their Arguments any
Service. It is well known upon the Exchange, and no <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants of any
long standing, can be ignorant that the Prohibition was ONLY of our <HI>Medley Cloths,</HI>
which were forbidden not only to be imported there, but to be worn; the Reasons
whereof also were assigned, (viz.) Not that they set about the making them there,
as some alledged, but because they found their People forward to run into the <HI>French</HI>
way of Clothing and Dressing themselves, which the Court for many Reasons thought
fit to prevent. But no Man who has any competent Knowledge of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade,
will pretend that the <HI>Bays, Says, Perpets, Serges, Stuffs, Stockings, Cotions, Plains, Kerseys,</HI>
&amp;c. which were always the Gross of the <HI>English</HI> Exportations to <HI>Portugal,</HI> were ever
under any Prohibition there, or any other of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> the <HI>Woollen
Cloths</HI> as above only excepted.</P>
<P>That what is said here may, as <HI>it is Resolved all things in this Paper shall,</HI> carry it's
Evidence along with it, the Words of the late Treaty with <HI>Portugal</HI> may be produced
for Proof: In the Second Articles after the Proportion between the Customs of <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
Wines and the Custom of <HI>French</HI> Wines is settled, follow these Words; <HI>Butt if this
Abatements of Customs as is presumed to be made, shall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo∣lished,
shall be just and lawful for his Sacred Royal Majesty of</HI> Portugal, <HI>again to forbid the</HI>
WOOLLEN CLOTHS.</P>
<P>From he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce may be noted also, that <HI>this part</HI> of the Agreement was not so abso∣lutely
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laid down, as an Essential of the Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Portugal,</HI> without which the Peace of the two Nations could not subsist, but Provision
was expresly made in the very Article, that if it should be ABOLISHED, yet the
Peace should r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>main entire; only the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> would then be at Liberty if he
thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> make himself Amend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon <HI>England,</HI> by prohibiting the <HI>English</HI> WOOL∣LEN
CLOTHS.</P>
<P>The next vulgar Error, or Mistake, which we are led into about the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade,
is, that the Encrease of our Exports of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to
<HI>Portugal,</HI> is occasion'd by, and depends upon the Encrease of our Demand for their
Wines: This, however absurd, and in its Nature contrary to the Truth of Fact, is the
thing on which the Argument is made to turn; from which they would infer, that
as our Demand for <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine decreased, so will their Demand for our <HI>Manufa∣ctures</HI>
decline: And in short, that if by the coming in of <HI>French</HI> Wines, the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Wine shall be wholly left off, as they vainly suggest, so will also the Demand for our
<HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> cease, and that Trade be lost.</P>
<P>The People who argue thus, confute themselves in their own Calculations: For
First to magnify the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, they tell us that we export thither Annually the
Value of Two Millions <HI>Sterling,</HI> most of it in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
against this, give them leave to make their own Estimates of the <HI>Wine</HI> we Im∣port
from thence, and take the largest Year and the highest Price they can reasonably
suppose, the Quantity will not amount to above 8 or 9000 <HI>Ton,</HI> which Account there
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
will in the pursuit of this Article, appear Reason to make great Abatement of too; but
were it so, and account the Wines prime Cost one with another, at 15 <HI>l. per Ton,</HI>
or, <HI>to please them,</HI> at 20 <HI>l. per Ton,</HI> which is much above the true Cost in in <HI>Portugal,</HI> they
will not amount to 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> which by their own Account, is less than one Tenth
part of the Demand for our <HI>Manufactures.</HI> This will very ill make it out that their
Demand for our <HI>Manufactures</HI> is occasion'd by, and depends upon our Demand for
their Wines; by which they must make it appear, that the Nine parts of the Trade de∣pend
upon the Tenth, and the greater is occasioned by the less, which is an Absur∣dity
in the very Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>But the matter of Fact is evident, and known to all that have any tolerable Know∣ledge
of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, (viz) That the Encrease of the Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI> has
been occasion'd by the Discovery within these few Years of the Gold Mines of St.
<HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> by which an immense Treasure is gain'd yearly to the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Nation, as well as to their King; that by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s means the People in <HI>Brazil</HI> are so in∣creas'd
in Wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and the Trade to <HI>Brazil</HI> are so increased as a Consequence, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leets which about twelve Years ago, were usually Twenty-three to Twenty-Eight
Sail of Ships from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Brazil,</HI> are now Seventy, Eighty, to a hundred Sail, and
the Exports of <HI>English</HI> Goods to <HI>Portugal</HI> are increased in Proportion.</P>
<P>This is the true and the only Reason of the Encrease of their Demand for <HI>English
Manufactures;</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s has no more Dependance upon, or is occasion'd by our De∣mand
for their <HI>Wines,</HI> than it depends upon any thing that has no Relation at all to it.</P>
<P>It is very strange to find the Opposers of any Argument lay the whole Stress and
Weight of what they have to say upon any thing which they are not very sure they
can support the Truth of. But it is perfectly surprizing to see Men value themselves
and their Cause upon Accounts and Calculations which are fraudulent and errone∣ous,
known by Themselves to be so, and which they might be sure, in an Age like
this, when Men take nothing upon Trust, would by inquiring Heads be soon detect∣ed
and exposed.</P>
<P>Nothing of this kind can be more wonderful, than what we see practised just now
by some People, in handing about a Paper call'd, <HI>A SCHEME of the Trade between</HI>
England <HI>and</HI> France, in order to make the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> look
with an Aspect to please them, and to answer all the <HI>Romantick</HI> things they have
said of it; which Paper or SCHEME, was Printed in 1674, and said to be Sign'd by
several eminent Merchants of the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Something might be said to the Design of that Paper, when it was first published,
and to the Persons who Sign'd it (viz.) <HI>That it was Calculated for a Design then on
foot, to expose the Publick Management, and divide the People against the Court.</HI></P>
<P>It may be proper than for the detecting the Fraud of this <HI>Scheme,</HI> to enter into an Exa∣mination
of some of the Particulars wherein it differs from the true Account of that
Year; which shall be done by giving a brief <HI>Abstract</HI> of the said <HI>Scheme,</HI> and likewise
of the true Account from the <HI>Custom House,</HI> as it is now laid before the Honourable
House of Commons by the Commissioners.</P>
<P>By both which it will appear, that the Design of this Paper, call'd A <HI>SCHEME,</HI>
was then, and the making it publick is now, to lessen in the publick Opinion the Va∣lue
of our Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtations to <HI>France,</HI> and to encrease or heighten the Value of our Im∣portations
from <HI>France;</HI> a Design in it self dishonest, but much more so from the man∣ner
of doing it, as will appear by what follows.</P>
<P>Our Exportat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons to <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668-9, are made by the
Scheme to amount to l. 171, 021. 06. 08, and all the species of Goods are restrated
to these few, (viz.) <HI>Woollen Cloths, Dozens, Kerseys, Rashes, Pennystones, Cott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, Flannels,
Hose, Bays, Stuffs, Serges,</HI> and <HI>Perpets,</HI> with some <HI>Petties,</HI> which are Crowded toge∣ther
at the Value of 20000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Two <HI>Observations</HI> shall contain what is sufficient to say to this part of it, and nothing
can be desired to expose it more.</P>
<P>1: That here is not half of the species of Goods named which are every Year Expor∣ted
to <HI>France,</HI> and which, as appears by the <HI>Custom-house</HI> Books were actually Exported
to <HI>France</HI> that Year.</P>
<P>2. That of the species of Goods which they have named, they have not set down
the true quantities which were really Exported to <HI>France</HI> that very Year.</P>
<P>These are such Tokens of a design'd <HI>Collusion</HI> and <HI>Prevarication,</HI> that nothing of that
kind can be more corrupt.</P>
<P>But to descend to a few <HI>Particulars</HI> of this <HI>Fraud,</HI> that the People may see in how
gross a manner they are Imposed upon.</P>
<P>1. Take a few of the Articles mention'd by the <HI>SCHEME</HI> of Goods Exported to
<HI>France,</HI> 1668-9, as aforesaid, and when Compared with the real Entries of that Year in
the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Books, from the Port of <HI>London,</HI> according to the Account given in by
the Commissioners, and now lying before the House of Commons.</P>
<P>And any one, upon Casting up the following <HI>Particulars,</HI> will see to what a Mag∣nitude
this Part will amount.</P>

<P>Besides prodigious Quantities of other Goods Exported to <HI>France</HI> that Year; as may
be seen by the said account from the <HI>Custom-House,</HI> now lying before the House of
Commons.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
The remaining <HI>Particulars</HI> are so many, as makes it plain, that the Value of our Ex∣portations
to <HI>France</HI> for that Year exceeded the Value of our Importations from
<HI>France</HI> very considerably, as by the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Books will appear.</P>
<P>The Errors in the Account of the Importations, are no less unfairly Stated than
these, and the Fraud is extended to a much greater Value; Nay, even the manner of
Stating it, discovers a design of Imposing upon the Publick. For First the Export is
confine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Port of <HI>London,</HI> only with an allowance of one Third more for the out
Ports, whereas the Import is said to be for the whole Kingdom, let them take it which
way they Please.</P>
<P>If their Imports are for the Ports of <HI>London</HI> only, then they have committed a
Fraud in the Quantities to the Value of above 721,796 Pounds, as will be prov'd by the
<HI>Custom-House</HI> Books.</P>
<P>If their Imports take in the whole Kingdom, then they have committed two Frauds
instead of one (1.) In the Quantities: And (2.) In offering to state the Debtor side of
the Account upon the Port of <HI>London,</HI> with a Guess at one Third more of the Out-Ports,
AGAINST all that they say was Imported in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>If they had design'd a fair and just Account, They ought to have stated the Ex∣ports
and Imports exactly for the Port of <HI>London,</HI> and have made the Addition of one
Third for the out Ports equal to both sides; and have stated both sides upon the Im∣ports
and Exports of the whole Kingdom; For if the Exports exceed the Imports for
the Port of <HI>London</HI> only, as appears by the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Books: It would have been
much more so for the Out-Ports, because many of our Out-Ports, which lye in or near
those Countries where the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> are made, <HI>Fish</HI> cured, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Export
much greater Quantities to <HI>France,</HI> than they could consume the Value of in <HI>French</HI>
Goods, as <HI>Exeter, Colchester, Yarmouth,</HI> and many other Ports.</P>
<P>But the Prevarications are yet more gross, and the Value greater; As one part makes the
Exportations to <HI>France</HI> seem less; so the other as dexterously makes the Importa∣tions
from <HI>France</HI> seem more: Nor will their making a Guess or Wholsale Al∣lowance
of one Third for the Out-Ports on one side answer for it, unless they had
either made the same allowance serve on both sides, or extended the Account to the
same period of Time on both sides without it; but acting fairly did not seem to suit
the Design.</P>
<P>Those who would support the Paper call'd <HI>A Scheme,</HI> produce a Paper, said to be
Signed by the Farmers of the Customs, containing an Account of the Importations
of <HI>Wines, Brandies,</HI> and <HI>Linnen</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1667, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669,
which they make to be very large, and from whence they would argue, that one half
thereof must be the Rule of the Year 1669. Had this been a meer Guess, or had it
been at any other time, the Calculation might have been less suspected. But there lies
so just an Exception against the Year 1667, and it was so well known to them, that
it cannot be any thing but a meer Design.</P>
<P>It is well known, the Plague had in the Year 1665 put an universal stop to all
Trade, except such as Necessity forc'd the People to, for meer Provisions. The next
Year the Fire of <HI>London</HI> happen'd; and as the Fire began near the water side, and a∣mong
the Warehouses and Cellars of the Merchants, the Quantities of <HI>Wines</HI> as well
as of other Goods which were spoil'd or destroy'd, were very great. Add to this
a War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> by which the Trade with both was stop'd, and which
War was not ended till the Treaty at <HI>Breda</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1667.</P>
<P>These Things might well suppose <HI>England</HI> to be so Exhausted of <HI>French</HI> Goods, as that
the Importation of the next Year, (viz) 1667, must be prodigious great; and no ratio∣nal
Judgment can be made of the Trade to or from <HI>France</HI> by the Accounts of that
Year. This is farther demonstrated by the Article of the <HI>Brandies</HI> which the Account
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
of the Farmers aforesaid makes for the said Two Years to be but 3775 <HI>Ton.</HI> But by an
Account of the same Farmers for the last Five Quarters of the said two Years, (viz.)
from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669, the whole Quantity of Brandy Imported,
amounts to no more than 680 <HI>Ton;</HI> and yet the <HI>SCHEME</HI> affirms, there was 4000
<HI>Ton</HI> of <HI>Brandy</HI> Imported from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669. And this is of∣fer'd
as one undeniable Evidence of the Fraud of that <HI>SCHEME.</HI></P>
<P>There may be a parallel Case found out to illustrate this, and that is of the Expor∣tation
of <HI>Lead</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France</HI> in the Year 1662, which amounts to, as by the
<HI>Custom-House</HI> Books, a most prodigious and unusual Quantity (viz.) From <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
1662, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1663, there was Exported from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> 21,757 Fod∣der
of <HI>Lead,</HI> which at 12 <HI>l. per Fodder,</HI> as the <HI>Scheme</HI> allows the Price to be, amounts
to 261,084 <HI>l.</HI> It would be acknowledged very unfair, that this should be given in as
an Article of our usual Export of Lead to <HI>France;</HI> for, as an extraordinary Year is no
just Rule to take a Medium of Calculation from, so no more is the Year 1667, to be
taken as a proper time to Calculate our Importation of <HI>Wine</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> the prece∣ding
Accidents of a Plague, the Fire, and the War, joining together to make the De∣mand
for Wines that Year extraordinary great.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is a Fate upon us, that the Inconveniencies and Ill-Consequences of re∣jecting
a Trade so evidently Beneficial to <HI>England,</HI> must be discovered by our Experi∣ence,
and must be felt before they will be known; in which Case this Paper will
have Occasion not only to mention those Inconveniencies before hand, but to remind
you of them when they happen.</P>
<P>This Paper shall also, in its Course, be adapted to the several Trading Counties and
Towns of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to make appear, that now the War is ended, all the Goods
and Commodities of <HI>France</HI> may be Imported into this Kingdom, especially such as are
to be Re-exported, as <HI>Brandies, Linens, Silks, Paper, Laces,</HI> &amp;c. Since upon such Re-exportation
all the additional Duties are drawn back; when at the same time not
one Yard of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which are all prohibited in
<HI>France,</HI> nor of our <HI>Fish</HI> and other material Commodities, can be Imported into <HI>France,</HI>
the Articles not being made effectual.</P>
<P>The Instances of this, shall be hereafter especially applyed to the particular Trading
places of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who will thereby be able to judge whether this is not the
true State of their Case, and whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Flemings</HI> will now have the Im∣portation
of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> as they have had for above 20 Years last
past, and reserve to themselves the <HI>Dressing, Dying</HI> and <HI>Finishing</HI> of those Goods;
whereby the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will become Slaves to Foreigners, who
will either set their own Price upon our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> or set up Fabricks of their
own in Imitation of them, all which might have been avoided, by having an open
and direct Trade with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This Paper shall not suggest so much Unhappiness to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> whose general
Good it is design'd to promote, as to propose that the Articles of <HI>Commerce</HI> shall not
in time to come be farther consider'd. The Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> who are the true
Judges of their Countries Good, cannot be supposed to omit any thing that shall be
apparently for the publick Advantage; and therefore when it shall appear to them
which we will not question, that these Articles are proper to be Re-consider'd, they
will no doubt, act therein, as Reason and Justice requires.</P>
<P>In the mean time, seeing we are to carry on our Trade without the Advantages
which were expected from the <HI>Treaty,</HI> let us enquire upon what Terms we are to
carry it on, and how we shall Trade with <HI>France</HI> for the time coming.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664 is now no more to be mentioned in this Affair: The low Du∣ties
which our Goods would have paid in <HI>France,</HI> are out of the Question. The Edict
of 1701 must now be the Rule of our Trade in <HI>France:</HI> And that this may be un∣derstood
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
without any Difficulty, and be as little subject to Mistakes as possible, the E∣dict
it self may be its own Exposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or; of which the following is a faithful Abstract.</P>
<P>An Arrest of the King's-Council of State, containing a Rule for the Importation of Goods and

This is a strict View of the present State of the <HI>English Commerce</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and
these are but part of the Burthens and Incumbrances of our Trade there, which her
Majesty, by the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>France,</HI> and in her just Concern for the good
of her Kingdoms, had procured to have her Subjects delivered from; But the Arti∣cles
being not made Effectual, they are now to continue, so that our Trade is to re∣main
in general prohibited there, till some Act shall be passed here, to render Effe∣ctual
the Provisions made for a Freedom of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and till Two Months after, all
which time the Profits of an advantageous Trade are lost to this Nation.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that while all these high Duties and Prohibitions remain
upon our Trade into <HI>France,</HI> most of the <HI>French</HI> Goods are still at Liberty to be Im∣ported
here, paying the high Duties; the Case of which will be, that for all of those
which may be Re-exported whither to our Plantations, the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> or o∣ther
Parts, those high Duties will be all drawn back, and the <HI>French</HI> Goods be so far
prejudicial to our <HI>Manufactures</HI> without our having any Share of the Advantage from
the Trade to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, the <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Brandies</HI> which may be used at Sea, or in Foreign
Parts, will draw back all the high Duties; and for the other part (viz) the Home
Consumption, they will be brought in as <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Portugal Wines</HI> and <HI>Brandies</HI> or else
smuggled upon the Coast: The <HI>Silks, Linnen, Paper,</HI> &amp;c. will come in as <HI>Dutch</HI> and
<HI>Flemmish;</HI> by which means the <HI>French</HI> will have the Benefit of the Peace as to their
Part of the Trade, and <HI>Britain</HI> will be entirely shut out, or be subservient to Foreigners,
who shall carry it on for their own Benefit, as they have done for 20 Years last past.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> There have been divers Representations made to the King of <HI>France</HI> himself, by
his own Subjects, as well <HI>Merchants</HI> and <HI>Manufacturers</HI> as others, all against the <HI>Treaty
of Commerce</HI> with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and especially against the Eighth and Ninth Articles,
the same which our People are offended with; Complaining, and with great Ear∣nestness
too, against admitting the <HI>English Woollen Manufactures</HI> into <HI>France</HI> upon the low
Duties of 1664, as what will be ruinous to the <HI>Manufactures</HI> set up with so great Suc∣cess
in <HI>France;</HI> For that the <HI>English</HI> will now bring in all their <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI>
upon them, in such great Quantities, that those made in <HI>Languedoc</HI> in <HI>Porton,</HI> in <HI>Pi∣cardy,</HI>
and other Places will be Ruined; That the <HI>English</HI> make those Goods so much
better than they can be made in <HI>France,</HI> and they will be so Cheap, the high Duties
which his Majesty had laid on, not so much to enrich his Treasury, as to encou∣rage
the Industry of his own Subjects, being taken off, even as far back as the <HI>Ta∣riff</HI>
of 1664, that the <HI>French</HI> Goods will find no Sale; but that the <HI>English</HI> Goods will
in proportion to their Goodness, be sold much cheaper than any can be made in
<HI>France.</HI> Farther, these Representations go on in very pressing, tho' humble Terms,
it being spoken to their King, to Complain, that an open Trade with <HI>England</HI> will al∣ways
be to the great Damage and Loss of the <HI>French;</HI> for, say they, the <HI>French</HI> Na∣tion
has very few Goods to send to the <HI>English,</HI> but whereof other Nations have the
like kinds, and do also Import the same into <HI>England;</HI> But the <HI>English</HI> have divers
Goods to send to <HI>France,</HI> of which no other Nation can send the like; That is to say,
<HI>Lead, Tin, Leather, Allum, Coal, Pilchards, Salmon,</HI> and several other kinds; whereas
the <HI>Wines</HI> of <HI>France</HI> are supplied to the <HI>English</HI> by <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Brandy</HI> by <HI>Spain,</HI> the
<HI>Wrought Silks</HI> by <HI>Genoa</HI> and the <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Milan,</HI> the <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Perfumes</HI> by <HI>Italy,</HI> and
the <HI>Linen</HI> and <HI>Paper</HI> by <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>For these Reasons they repres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, that the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as
it is now fixed, would be Dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctive, and an entire Ruin to the Trade of the <HI>French</HI>
Nation; concluding, that <HI>France</HI> can never recover it's Wealth and Greatness, if such
a <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> should be permitted to take place, and unless some way be found
out to continue the high Duties, and thereby to keep out the <HI>English Manufactures</HI> from
being permitted to come into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<HI>These</HI> Representations <HI>seem to rally the</HI> English, <HI>for what they call a Stupidity incre∣dible,
that they prohibit Trading with</HI> France, <HI>at the begining of the first War,</HI> By
which (<HI>say they</HI>) the Manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> have arrived to a great Height, which it was
impossible should have been, if the <HI>English Woollen Manufactures</HI> had continu'd to have been
sent into <HI>France; and insinuate, that</HI> it should have been the Most Christian King, not the
late King <HI>William,</HI> who should have caused a <HI>Prohibition</HI> of Trade to have been publish'd; for
that the <HI>English</HI> Trade was the only Destructive thing to the Industry of the <HI>French</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>These <HI>Arguments</HI> are so pungent, and carry with them so much Weight, that it makes
a most pointed <HI>Satyre</HI> upon the <HI>French</HI> King, that he should not comply with their
Desires; but it must be acknowledged, that if their Reasons are just on the <HI>French</HI> side,
it will be hard to find that our Complaints of this Trade can be reasonable on the o∣ther
side; for it is hardly Rational to suggest, that the Trade between these Two Na∣tions
can be to the Disadvantage and Loss on both sides</P>
<P>Many Delusions have been spread about to amuse and deceive the People in this
Matter of the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>France;</HI> some of which have been Detected and
duly Exposed, and many who have been Deceived by them begin to recover their
Judgments, and to find that the <HI>Treaty</HI> which they have been prevail'd upon to Reject
and Contemn, is really a Foundation of the most advantageous Commerce that <HI>Britain</HI>
can be engaged in; That the <HI>French</HI> must Trade with us under the most disadvan∣tageous
Conditions imaginable; That our Export will be easy to us, their Imports here
hard and Loaden with Burthens to them; and we begin to see these People now
repent the Opposition they have all along made to their Countries Good, and would
undo what others have done if it was in their Power to do so.</P>
<P>But there are still Mistakes behind, which must be removed, and Objections which
however they may be ill-grounded, yet require some Notice of them; as especially
this (viz) That there are but three Ports in <HI>France</HI> at which our <HI>Manufactures</HI> are ad∣mitted
to be Imported, (viz.) St. <HI>Vallery</HI> on the <HI>Soame, Roan,</HI> and <HI>Bourdaux.</HI> It is won∣derful
to reflect how much this prevails in the Minds of the People, considering it is
evident that the limiting the Ports for Entry, concern only the two Species, (viz.)
the <HI>Cloths</HI> and <HI>Cloth-Serges,</HI> which is plain by the Specifications of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and not
all the rest of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures.</HI> But as to all our other <HI>Woollen Manufactures,
Bays, Says, Serges, Perpets, Stuffs, Druggets, Dozens, Kersies, Stockings,</HI> &amp;c. All our Re-exported
Goods, such as <HI>Cottons, Indicoes, Sugars, East-India</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> Goods, and all
other, they are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eely allow'd by the <HI>Treaty</HI> to be Imported into all the Ports of <HI>France;</HI>
and before this <HI>Treaty,</HI> the said two species of <HI>Manufactures</HI> were confined to but Two
Ports, (viz.) <HI>Calais,</HI> and St. <HI>Vallery</HI> on the same.</P>
<P>It has been said, that the Reason why the <HI>French</HI> Confined our said <HI>Woollen Manufa∣ctures</HI>
to certain Ports for their Importations was, that the Land Carriage and Local
Duties of the said Goods should rise so h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh upon them, that the Price should thereby be
made too great for the Buyer, and give the advantage to their own <HI>Manufactures.</HI> Let
such People but look Back upon their Own <HI>Arguments,</HI> they are not only false in them∣selves,
but inconsistent with one another; for if this were true, then it must be true
also, that their own <HI>Manufactures</HI> stood in need of those Helps; that their own <HI>Manu∣factures</HI>
were so Inferiour to the <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish</HI> that if the utmost Discouragements were not put
upon the <HI>English</HI> Goods, the <HI>French Manufactures</HI> would not be told, that the <HI>English Ma∣nufactures</HI>
so excelled the <HI>French,</HI> in the real intrinsick Value, that if these were ad∣mitted,
tho' upon the hardest Terms to be Imported into <HI>France,</HI> yet they would gain
Ground there; and to be brief, would Sell before the <HI>French,</HI> albeit the Difference
made by the Burthen of Duties there, was at that time above 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and these
things they will not allow, having on many Occasions published that the <HI>French Ma∣nufactures</HI>
are as good as Ours, and if permitted to come into <HI>England,</HI> would ruin our
own.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
But on the other hand, this suggestion cannot in general be True; for had it been
so that the limiting the Importation of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> to a few cer∣tain
Ports, was contriv'd to Load the said Goods with the farther Burthens of Land-carriage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Why then should the Ports they were limited to, be chosen out upon
the greatest Navigable Rivers in <HI>France,</HI> nearest to the Place where the Centre of their
Trade lay, and where the chief Consumption of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> was to be expect∣ed.
For Example; <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> The City of <HI>Roven</HI> lies on the River <HI>Sein,</HI>
and is to <HI>Paris</HI> as <HI>Gravesend</HI> is to <HI>London:</HI> From thence the Navigation of the <HI>Sein</HI>
conveys every thing by Water upon Five great Rivers, (viz) by the <HI>Oyse</HI> and the
<HI>Aisne</HI> into the Isle of <HI>France</HI> and the lower <HI>Champain</HI> to the City of <HI>Rhiemes,</HI> the <HI>Rhe∣telois</HI>
and the Edge of the Dutchy of <HI>Bar;</HI> by the River <HI>Maza</HI> through the whole Pro∣vince
of <HI>Champain,</HI> by the <HI>Yonne</HI> into <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Nivernois,</HI> and by the River <HI>Loyng</HI>
and the <HI>Canal de Briare</HI> into the great River <HI>Loyre</HI> to the Cities of <HI>Orleans, Nevers, Blais
Tours, Angers,</HI> &amp;c. even down to the <HI>Occean,</HI> and through the very Heart of <HI>France:</HI>
Again the City of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> is the Centre of the <HI>English Commerce</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and where
the greatest Number of our Ships resort for the <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandies</HI> which are brought
from thence, Therefore appointing <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> as one of the Ports for the Import of
our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> was rather making the Trade easy than difficult to the <HI>English,</HI> and
so far from a design of making our Goods dear, and encreasing the Charges upon them,
that it was rather giving Ease to it by opening that only Port to which the <HI>English</HI> could
bring them upon the easiest Terms of <HI>Fraight,</HI> and where the greatest Demand for
those Goods was to be found; where the principal Consumption of them might be
excepted, and where the greatest Convenience of <HI>Ireland</HI> Navigation was to be had,
in order to convey the said <HI>Manufactures</HI> to all Parts of the Kingdom of <HI>France:</HI> For
the City of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> stands on the <HI>Garonne,</HI> from whence they have a Navigation by
other Rivers; (viz.) the <HI>Dordonne</HI> quite through <HI>Perigott</HI> and <HI>Limosin</HI> into <HI>Auvergne;</HI>
by the River <HI>Lot</HI> through <HI>Quercy</HI> and <HI>Rovergne</HI> even to the <HI>Sevennes,</HI> and by the Royal
Canal from the City of <HI>Thoulouse</HI> on the <HI>Garonne</HI> quite through the Province of <HI>Lan∣guedoc</HI>
to <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and into the mediterranean Sea; supplying the whole Provinces of
<HI>Gascoign, Guienne,</HI> and <HI>Languedock</HI> with <HI>British Manufactures</HI> by Water Carriage.</P>
<P>This rather seems to intimate to us, that the <HI>French</HI> King finding it convenient on
other Accounts to limit the Importation of these Goods to certain Ports, yet appoin∣ted
those Ports so, as that his Subjects might have the Goods brought with the great∣est
Ease and the least Charge that could be to those Markets, where the greatest Con∣sumption
of them was, and where the Principal Traders in those Goods were settled;
who from thence supplyed the whole Kingdom by the Convenience of Water-Carriage:
As to the Reason of naming particular Ports and Places for the Importation of these
Goods, it is known to those who are acquainted with the Affairs of <HI>France, That it
was occasioned by the differing Circumstances of the Contracts with the Farmers,</HI> and was a
thing practised in other Cases in <HI>France</HI> as well as in this of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI>
as particularly the <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Spices</HI> which are limited in almost the same manner.</P>
<P>Also this limiting the Importation of Goods to certain Ports, is not a new Practice
or peculiar to <HI>France</HI> only; the like is done in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the <HI>Alamodes</HI> and
<HI>Lustrings,</HI> are confined to the Port of <HI>London;</HI> and the Importation of <HI>Wooll</HI> from <HI>Ireland</HI>
is limited to Three or Four Ports only, but however is so ordered, not that the <HI>Irish
Wooll</HI> should by Reason of Land-Carriage be made dearer to our <HI>Manufactures</HI> than the
<HI>English,</HI> in order to discourage the Importation of it; But for other particular Reasons,
drawn from the Circumstances of the thing it self; and therefore the Towns to which
the Importations of <HI>Irish Wooll</HI> is limited are such, as are not only nearest and most con∣venient
by their Situation for the coming from <HI>Ireland,</HI> but nearest and most conveni∣ent
to those parts of <HI>England</HI> where the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> live, who make use of <HI>Irish Wooll,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
and are the principal Buyers and Consumers thereof; as <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead</HI> for the <HI>Serge-Ma∣kers</HI>

at <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verpool</HI> for the <HI>Clothiers</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire:</HI> And the like.</P>
<P>Had not the Convenience of the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> been consulted in this Limitation,
but on the contrary, had it been contrived or appointed on purpose to add the Burthen
and Expence of Land-Carriage to the Price of the <HI>Wooll, Bristoll</HI> might have been na∣med,
<HI>Milford-Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or any Port in <HI>Wales,</HI> which tho' lying as wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the <HI>Naviga∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>Irish</HI> Vessels, would yet have greatly encreased the Price of the <HI>Wooll</HI> to the
<HI>Manufacturers,</HI> by the Charges of carrying it on Horseback after it was landed; in like
manner had the King of <HI>France</HI> limited the Importation of the <HI>English▪ Manufactures</HI>
with Design, as it is alledged, to Enhance the Price by Land-Carriage, he would have
chosen such Ports for their Importation as were most remote from those Parts, where the
principal Consumptions of them was known to be, and most remote from the Conveniences
of Water-Carriage: This was very easy for him to have done, had he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed the Cities
of <HI>Rochell</HI> and St. <HI>Mall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for Example, instead of <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> the Case had been
qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e altered, there being no River Navigable near them; and then it would have
been difficult to have assigned any other Reason for such Limitation, than that of
Discouraging and Burthening the Trade: But as it is now, there is no room for any
Supposition of that kind.</P>
<P>Further it might be demanded why the <HI>French</HI> King should not rather lay still high∣er
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties on the said <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> than study to raise their Price by the Diffi∣culties
of their Importation; the former being the readiest Method of Discour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging
their Market, and which would at the same time have brought in some Gain to the
Crown, which is an Article they are far from being forgetful of in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Much has been said in Discoursing on this Subject, about the Ballance of the <HI>French</HI>
Trade being against <HI>England:</HI> That the Ballance formerly against <HI>England</HI> has been Dispu∣ted,
and that with good Reason; the contrary in many Particulars evidently appearing;
But that the Ballance will be against <HI>England</HI> NOW, is too evident; for it is impossible
to be otherwise: the Nature of the Trade will not permit it to be otherwise; The <HI>French</HI>
will bring in great Quantities of their Goods here, of which some will always be
consumed at home, what Price soever they cost; and all that we want for Re-Expor∣tation,
whether to our own Colonies or other Parts will go abroad, drawing back
the high Duties, which, as it is alledged, are to hinder our Trading in them. So that
still all our Foreign <HI>Commerce,</HI> so far as these Kind of <HI>Goods</HI> are Demanded, will be <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Against this, it is demanded, how must Payment be made? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all our Trade to <HI>France</HI>
is in some Respect prohibited, as has been shewn by the Edict of 1701, published
MERCATOR (No. 13.) and what is not prohibited is loaded with such high Duties,
as are almost equal to a Prohibition: We have been told that we pay for all the Goods
we buy in <HI>France</HI> with ready Money, whether we did or no BEFORE may be debated
another time, but it is evident that we shall buy NOW; the Articles not being made
Effectual, must be paid for with Money, or not paid for at all; for the <HI>French</HI> will take
nothing of us. So that they having formerly shut the Door of <HI>Commerce</HI> against <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
we have bolted it now on the wrong side, and will not suffer them to open it
again, altho' they are willing to do it.</P>
<P>If the Ballance of Trade by this means runs against <HI>Britain,</HI> which before always ran
against <HI>France,</HI> we cannot blame them, but must blame our selves, who have been wil∣ling
to have it so, and have so blamed our Party-Interest with our Trading-Interest,
as to ruin the one, in order to carry on the other.</P>
<P>The Objection upon which all this Matter seem'd to turn, has been, that the <HI>French</HI>
have NOW all kinds of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of their own making, and have no
need of our Trade; this is carryed such a Length by some, that they insist, that the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
<HI>French</HI> make all the sorts of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> as good as the <HI>English,</HI> and much
cheaper than they can be made here; that they are able not only to supply themselves
but other Countries, nay all Countries says one Author; and <HI>Britain</HI> too, says another
Author: But it would be ask'd of these warm People, <HI>Why then do they so strictly and
carefully Exclude, Prohibit, or Load with Duties, all the</HI> English Woollen Manufactures? If
their own are better and cheaper than the <HI>English,</HI> their Quality would be a Prohibition
as effectual as an Edict or <HI>Arrest du Conseil,</HI> and much more, and other Prohibitions
would be needless.</P>
<P>But whatever we are pleased to say, the <HI>French</HI> know better, and as they have good
Reason to be most sensible of the Defects of their own <HI>Manufactures,</HI> so they are very
careful to keep the <HI>English</HI> Goods out, that the Goodness of one against the Meanness
of the other, may not be discovered by the Trade it self: Nothing can be a more un∣deniable
Proof of the Mistake of those People who talk so warmly of the Goodness and
Cheapness of the <HI>French Manufactures,</HI> than the <HI>French</HI> King laying such repeated Bur∣thens
upon the <HI>English</HI> Goods; and after this was done, and several times encreased,
yet, when the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> there found, that notwithstanding their high Duties and
Burthens, the <HI>English</HI> Goods would be bought by their People, whatever they cost, be∣ing
recommended so effectually by their own Worth and Goodness, that all the <HI>French</HI>
could do in the meer way of Trade would be of no Signification to it, They Petitioned
the <HI>French</HI> King to grant a Total Prohibition of <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> which he did:
And this was all done during a Time of Peace; so that the War is not the Reason of
this Case, but the meer Nature of the Trade, and it is easy to be discovered that it
had been to small Purpose to go about making <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> if the
<HI>English Woollen Manufactures</HI> were not effectually Prohibited.</P>
<P>Her Majesty, on the other hand, has so effectually secur'd to her Subjects all the
Advantages of the <HI>French</HI> Trade, that she has not only obtain'd the Revocation of all
that the King of <HI>France</HI> had been doing for 50 Years, for the Encouragement of his
Subjects in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> by which she gives her own People a full Oppor∣tunity
to extend their Trade into all parts of <HI>France</HI> with Advantage, but on the con∣trary,
has continued upon the <HI>French</HI> Importations hither, all those Inequalities and
extraordinary Duties which were needful to exclude them from any prejudicial Ex∣cesses
in <HI>England</HI> to the Disadvantage of her own People: By both which the Ballance
of that Trade is effectually secured to be on the <HI>English</HI> side, and we are in a fair way
to recover all the Injury done to our <HI>Commerce</HI> by the last impungent Prohibitions.</P>
<P>Would these People turn the Tables and make this Case their own, what may we
suppose they would say if the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had, in Her Majesty's <HI>Treaty of
Commerce,</HI> Consented to take off the high Duties laid on the Importation of those <HI>French
Manufactures,</HI> which our People have been Encouraged by those high Duties to make
here, and given Permission by this <HI>New Treaty</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> to Import the said Goods
upon the low Duties, which the same Goods paid here before the Year, 1664. <HI>For
Example,</HI> Should the Duties on <HI>French Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lustrings</HI> have been reduced to
6 <HI>s. per l.</HI> which they paid before the War, instead of 31 s. 10 d. which they are to
pay now; should the Duties on <HI>French Brandy,</HI> which by this <HI>Treaty</HI> is to remain at a∣bove
51 l. <HI>per</HI> Ton, have been reduced to 30 s. as it was before the <HI>Revolution;</HI> May we
not suppose the Distiller of <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Mollasses,</HI> the Weavers of <HI>Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lustrings,</HI>
and the Dealers under them all, would have made <HI>Representations</HI> and <HI>Complaints</HI> of their
Trade being ruin'd and given up to the <HI>French,</HI> their Families Impoverish'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> like
as we find the <HI>French</HI> Merchants and <HI>Manufactures</HI> in <HI>France</HI> have done on their side to
their King, and for which we must acknowledge they have very good Reason.</P>
<P>It is scarcely worth while to mention here, much less to give an Answer to a Re∣port
very Confidently spread about, and which some people are weak enough to take
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
upon Trust, viz. <HI>That by the</HI> Treaty of Commerce, <HI>leave was to be given to Export
our Wooll unwrought into</HI> France: But as it is certain, that such a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port is industriously
spread about, where it is thought there is Ignorance enough to suffer so great a De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion,
it is reasonable to observe from it, what <HI>Endeavours</HI> are us'd by some among
us, to Impose upon the people of this Nation in the grossest manner, for the carrying
on other Designs, equally Destructive to the publick safety.</P>
<P>But to return to what was mention'd, viz. of the real abatement of Duties, which
is obtain'd by this <HI>Treaty;</HI> it may be a profitable Explanation of the present <HI>Treaty of
Commerce,</HI> and may prevent the prejudices which some Entertain against this <HI>Treaty,</HI>
should a brief Account be given them of the Difference between the present State of
our Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and what it has been at several times; when it has neverthe∣less
been carried on by us to Advantage; and what it was to have been by the <HI>Trea∣ty,</HI>
or would have been, had the <HI>Articles</HI> been made Effectual: And as this shall be
done in brief Tables, referring to the several Heads of our Exportation, as they now
lye before us; so they may afterwards be brought down one by one, to the particular
Trading Towns and Counties of <HI>Britain,</HI> where those Branches of our <HI>Manufactures</HI>
are carried on:</P>
<P>To begin with our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> all which now stand Prohibited, and must
do so till the said <HI>Articles</HI> are made Effectual, the following Table will shew what Du∣ties
are taken off by this Treaty, and upon what low Duties they would have been
admitted into <HI>France</HI> by this Treaty, had it been made Effectual, as well as what Pro∣hibitions
and high Duties the Trade now labours under.</P>
<P>The following is an Account of several <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
now Prohibited in <HI>France,</HI> the Time when the high Duties were laid upon them
before the said Prohibition; with what they were to pay by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of, 1664, which
was to take place, if the <HI>Eighth</HI> and <HI>Ninth Articles</HI> of the <HI>Treaty</HI> had been made Effe∣ctual.</P>

<P>They must be no <HI>Manufacturers</HI> themselves, nor much concern'd for those who are,
or for the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> in general, who can read this Table with∣out
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
being sensible of the Disadvantage our Trade lyes under in the present situation
of our Commerce with <HI>France:</HI> When they shall Read the Word <HI>Prohibited</HI> continually
before every <HI>Article</HI> of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> and shall remember, that for Twelve
Years past, none of all those Goods have been admitted into <HI>France</HI> but by way of
<HI>Holland;</HI> whereas very great Quantities of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> were Yearly Expor∣ted
thither before, besides other Goods of the Growth and Production of our own
Country, or of our Plantations, which is the same thing, and ought so to be esteem∣med.</P>
<P><HI>When
the QUEEN,</HI> who always had the Good of Her Subjects, and the Prosperity of
their Commerce at Her Heart, <HI>found it was in Her Power to open such a Door of Trade
to Her People,</HI> on Terms so much to the Loss and Disadvantage of <HI>France,</HI> and so evident∣ly
to the Advantage of Her own Kingdoms; <HI>it could not but be with great Satisfaction,
that Her Majesty gave in Charge to Her Ministers and Plenipotentiaties,</HI> to Conclude
a Treaty, which took off all the Burthens and Prohibitions, which the Mistakes of former
Years had brought upon the Trade, and by which Her Enemies were obliged to make deep
Wounds in their own Trade, to comply with those Demands.</P>
<P>But, it must be very disobliging to the QUEEN, as well as very surprizing to her
Faithful Subjects, to see in what manner <HI>some People</HI> receive, and how disingeniously
they Construe <HI>all Her Majesty's Endeavours to shew Her affectionate Concern for the Welfare
of Her Subjects, and the Prosperity of Their Commerce;</HI> as if that very Care, which Her
Majesty has so Eminently express'd, <HI>for Their Good,</HI> was a Contrivance of Her and
their Enemies, to betray us to the <HI>French,</HI> and to give up the <HI>British Interest in Trade,</HI> to
the most dangerous Rivals they have in the World.</P>
<P>Certainly Mankind cannot be so far carried away with the stream of their Passions,
as to deny this general Maxim; <HI>That nothing ought to be believed in such publick Debates
as these, but what is proved.</HI> This <HI>Paper</HI> has from its beginning, taken this for a Rule,
<HI>and therefore brings Authentick Proofs with it, of every Thing it says, yet these Men say it is
all Lies;</HI> on the contrary, <HI>they bring no</HI> Proof <HI>at all of what they say, and yet they expect
to be believed.</HI></P>
<P>To shorten the <HI>Dispute,</HI> the <HI>MERCATOR</HI> shall as modestly as the <HI>Case</HI> will allow
make a fair Challenge to all <HI>Opposers;</HI> which if they do not Answer, they can but ill
Justify any of their future <HI>Objections</HI> against the Truth of what is alledg'd in this Pa∣per.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Challenge</HI> is▪ <HI>That whereas they charge this Paper with Lying,</HI> they ought to de∣scend
to Particulars; and stating it truly, <HI>let the World know what ONE THING it
is the MERCATOR has Affirm'd, Asserted, made Publick as Truth, which is not so:</HI>
If this cannot be done, <HI>the charge of Lying will turn back upon them, with great Disad∣vantage
to themselves.</HI></P>
<P>One Condition only must be desir'd of them, (viz.) <HI>That they will not expect any thing
should be taken upon Trust on one side more than on the other;</HI> and therefore that they will
be careful, as the MERCATOR has always done, to quote their Authorities for all they
shall say; the Validity of which, when Confronted with those of this Paper, may be
easily examined, and the <HI>Readers</HI> may judge whether are in the Right; if they do not
think fit to do this, as the MERCATOR will not think it worth while to take any
Notice of them, so neither can they expect it of any one else.</P>
<P>That their <HI>Scheme</HI> of which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted, is it self one general Complication of
Fraud; and false Representations has been made appear, even to both Houses of Par∣liament;
The MERCATOR in that, as in every other Case of like Nature, says no∣thing
from himself, but spakes the Language of the <HI>Custom House</HI> Books, gives exact
Copies of the Commissioners Reports, sign'd under their Hands, and proves every thing
in particular by Authentick Papers; if these are false, the MERCATOR would be
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
very willing to see the Proof of it; if any mistake has happened, whether wilful or
by the negligence of Clerks, the Books are remaining, and may be referr'd to: Why
do not these People tell us where these Mistakes lye? why do they not prove that the
MERCATORS has made false Draughts of those Accounts and Reports? omitted any
thing or added any thing to make his Arguments appear the Better; as on the other
Hand has been proved to be their practice, even in a most scandalous manner, in their
late SCHEME, under the hands of the Commissioners of the <HI>Customs,</HI> and by them
Laid before both Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P>All the use this Paper shall make of this unfair Usage, is only to proceed with
the same Caution in all that it shall make publick, still taking care to offer nothing
but what is sufficiently confirm'd by such Authorities, as shall always stand the Test
of the strictest Examination; taking no notice of any thing which shall be said in
Opposition to it, unless it comes likewise supported by such Proofs as may give a due
Weight, and make it reasonable to be Inquired into.</P>
<P><HI>But to return to the Subject of Trade, from which as few Digressions as possible, shall be
made in this</HI> Paper.</P>
<P>The last MERCATOR gave a true Prospect of the State of one Branch of our Trade in
<HI>France</HI> as it now stands, and as it might now have stood, had the <HI>Treaty</HI> taken place, that
is to say, <HI>the Branch of Trade which concerns our</HI> Woollen Manufactures <HI>in particular.</HI>
The <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may there see what Circumstances they are now in
as to <HI>Trade,</HI> and what their unnatural Joy is built upon which they have so publickly
shewn at the Delay of the Advantages which they might by this time have rafted of
in their Trade.</P>
<P>Next to the said Exportation of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> the <HI>Fishing Trade</HI> is our im∣mediate
Concern, and that more especially since our <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Scotland:</HI> The <HI>Northern</HI>
Parts of <HI>Britain</HI> have a peculiar Interest in the <HI>Fishery,</HI> and the securing a Market in
<HI>France</HI> for the great Quantities of <HI>Fish</HI> that are or may be Cured in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the
<HI>North,</HI> and <HI>West</HI> parts of <HI>England,</HI> is of so great Consequence to this Nation, that it can∣not
be omitted in a <HI>Treaty of Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> had not forgotten this part, or to encourage their own Subjects to launch
into the <HI>Fishery</HI> as well as into the other Branches of our <HI>Trade:</HI> The high Duties in
<HI>France</HI> laid upon <HI>Fish</HI> from <HI>Great Britain, were an effectual Support to the</HI> French <HI>Projects
of</HI> Fishing, <HI>and a Bar to the</HI> Fishing of Great Britain: For <HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Union</HI> being
brought into the same Prohibitions, and being esteemed as the same Nation, came
thereby also under <HI>the same Inconveniencies of Trade,</HI> and <HI>lost the Advantage of their Trade
to</HI> France, which before was very considerable, especially in <HI>Fish; Scotland</HI> having al∣ways
before the <HI>Union,</HI> Exported to <HI>France</HI> yearly, a very great Quantity of <HI>Herring, Salmon</HI> and white <HI>Fish.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be grateful to all those Parts of <HI>Britain</HI> which are sensible of the <HI>Benefit</HI>
of the <HI>Fishery,</HI> and who depend <HI>upon the Exportation of the</HI> Fish <HI>when taken,</HI> to understand
<HI>That the Importation of our</HI> Fish <HI>into</HI> France <HI>is now, by this</HI> Treaty, <HI>left open upon very easy
Terms,</HI> and particularly, <HI>upon the same Terms with the</HI> Dutch; which could never be ob∣tained
before.</P>
<P>The just Care and Concern which Her Majesty has shewn for the Interest of Her
own Subjects, and the Extent of their Commerce, has been seen in removing that
Inequality, and providing that our Fishery shall now be upon the same Foot with
that of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and have the same Encouragement of an open Trade to <HI>France;</HI> a
thing which however the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Taught us to reject here, they always took care
to secure for themselves, and found no little advantage in it.</P>
<P>The Merchants and Gentlemen of the <HI>North</HI>-part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and of the <HI>West</HI> also,
have frequently express'd to the Government their great Concern for the obtaining
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
this Liberty of Commerce; and the great Advantages which it would be to them, if
obtain'd; as may be seen by the <HI>Representation</HI> of the Royal Buroughs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for∣merly
sent up to the Lords Commissioners of Trade; and of others also: And unless
we could suppose them to Act in Contradiction to themselves, it must be a particular
Satisfaction to them all, to see what provision Her Majesty has made for the said <HI>Fi∣shing-Trade</HI>
by this <HI>Treaty;</HI> and it must be impossible, without an Infatuation, which it
would be rude to suggest, that the Merchants and Trading People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the
<HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of the Coasts about <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mouth</HI> and <HI>Loest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff,</HI> or the Counties of <HI>Corn∣wall</HI>
and <HI>Devon,</HI> can be drawn into say, <HI>they are pleas'd that the Articles of this Treaty re∣main
Ineffectual.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus often mention'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>Fishing-Trade,</HI> it is proper also to take
notice how, by the present Treaty, Her Majesty made it Her especial Care, in behalf
of Her <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects as well as <HI>English,</HI> to have all those new Burthens which were
laid upon the <HI>British Fishing Trade</HI> only, and which gave that Trade away from us to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> taken away in <HI>France;</HI> and as it is very surprizing, that the Power of any
Party-Influence, should make us in <HI>England</HI> insensible of such advantages. So the next
Paper shall let you see what those Advantages are, and that they are not equally dis∣regarded
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as they are here.</P>
