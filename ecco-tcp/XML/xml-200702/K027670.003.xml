<P>THIS letter, my dear Lydia, will distress thy good heart, for from the beginning thou wilt perceive no enter∣taining strokes of humour in it—I
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
cannot be chearful when a thousand melancholy ideas surround me—I have met with a loss of near fifty pounds, which I was taken in for in an extraordinary manner—but what is that loss in comparison of one I may experience?—Friendship is the balm and cordial of life, and without it, 'tis a heavy load not worth sustain∣ing.—I am unhappy—thy mother and thyself at a distance from me, and what can compensate for such a destitution?—For God's sake persuade her to come and fix in England, for life is too short to waste in separation—and whilst she lives in one country, and I in another, many people will suppose it proceeds from choice—
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
besides I want thee near me, thou child and darling of my heart!—I am in a melancholy mood, and my Lydia's eyes will smart with weeping when I tell her the cause that now affects me.—I am apprehensive the dear friend I mentioned in my last letter is going into a decline—I was with her two days ago, and I never beheld a being so alter'd—she has a tender frame, and looks like a drooping lily, for the roses are fled from her cheeks—I can never see or talk to this incompara∣ble woman without bursting into tears—I have a thousand obligations to her, and I owe her more than her whole sex, if not all the world put
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
together.—She has a delicacy in her way of thinking that few pos∣sess—our conversations are of the most interesting nature, and she talks to me of quitting this world with more composure than others think of living in it.—I have wrote an epitaph, of which I send thee a copy.—'Tis expressive of her mo∣dest worth—but may heav'n re∣store her! and may she live to write mine.</P>

<P>I Am sincerely affected, my dear Mr. and Mrs. J.—by your friendly enquiry, and the interest you are so good to take in my health. God knows I am not able to give a good account of myself, having passed a bad night in much feverish agitation.—My physician ordered me to bed, and to keep therein 'till some favourable change—I fell ill the moment I got
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
to my lodgings—he says it is owing to my taking James's Powder, and venturing out on so cold a day as Sun∣day—but he is mistaken, for I am certain whatever bears that name must have efficacy with me—I was bled yesterday, and again to day, and have been almost dead, but this friendly enquiry from Gerrard-street has pour∣ed balm into what blood I have left—I hope still (and next to the sense of what I owe my friends) it shall be the last pleasurable sensation I will part with—if I continue mending, it will yet be some time before I shall have strength enough to get out in a car∣riage—my first visit will be a visit of true gratitude—I leave my kind

<HEAD>LETTER LXXX. To the Earl of —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Old Bond-street, <DATE>May 1, 1767,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was yesterday taking leave of all the town, with an intention of leav∣ing it this day, but I am detained by the kindness of lord and lady S—, who have made a party to dine and sup on my account—I am impatient to set out for my solitude, for there the mind gains strength, and learns to lean upon herself—In the world it seeks or accepts of a few treacherous
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
supports—the feigned compassion of one—the flattery of a second—the ci∣vilities of a third—the friendship of a fourth—they all deceive, and bring the mind back to where mine is re∣treating, to retirement, reflection, and books. My departure is fixed for to-morrow morning, but I could not think of quitting a place where I have received such numberless and unmerited civilities from your lord∣ship, without returning my most grate∣ful thanks, as well as my hearty ac∣knowledgments for your friendly en∣quiry from Bath. Illness, my lord, has occasioned my silence—Death knocked at my door, but I would not admit him—the call was both unex∣pected
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
and unpleasant—and I am se∣riously worn down to a shadow—and still very weak, but weak as I am, I have as whimsical a story to tell you as ever befel one of my family—Shan∣dy's nose, his name, his sash window are fools to it—it will serve at least to amuse you—The injury I did myself last month in catching cold upon James's Powder—fell, you must know, upon the worst part it could—the most painful, and most dangerous of any in the human body. It was on this crisis I called in an able surgeon and with him an able physician (both my friends) to inspect my disaster∣—'tis a venereal case, cried my two scientific friends—'tis impossible, how∣ever,
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
to be that, replied I—for I have had no commerce whatever with the sex, not even with my wife, added I, these fifteen years.—You are, however, my good friend, said the surgeon, or there is no such case in the world—what the devil, said I, without know∣ing woman?—We will not reason about it, said the physician, but you must undergo a course of mercury—I will lose my life first, said I—and trust to nature, to time, or at the worst to death—so I put an end, with some in∣dignation, to the conference—and de∣termined to bear all the torments I underwent, and ten times more, ra∣ther than submit to be treated like a <HI>sinner,</HI> in a point where I had acted
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
like a <HI>saint.</HI>—Now as the father of mischief would have it, who has no pleasure like that of dishonouring the righteous, it so fell out that from the moment I dismissed my doctors, my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expressed, or supported. Every hour became more intolerable.—I was got to bed, cried out, and raved the whole night, and was got up so near dead that my friends in∣sisted upon my sending again for my physician and surgeon. I told them upon the word of a man of honour they were both mistaken, as to my case—but though they had reasoned wrong, they might act right; but that sharp as my sufferings were, I
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
felt them not so sharp as the imputa∣tion which a venereal treatment of my case laid me under—They an∣swered that these taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years, but they would not reason with me in a point wherein I was so delicate, but would do all the office for which they were called in, namely to put an end to my torment, which otherwise would put an end to me—and so have I been compelled to surrender myself—and thus, my dear lord, has your poor friend with all his sensibilities been suffering the chastisement of the gross∣est sensualist.—Was it not as ridicu∣lous an embarrassment as ever Yo∣rick's spirit was involved in?—No∣thing
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
but the purest conscience of innocence could have tempted me to write this story to my wife, which by the bye would make no bad anecdote in Tristram Shandy's Life—I have mentioned it in my journal to Mrs. — In some repects there is no dif∣ference between my wife and herself—when they fare alike, neither can reasonably complain.—I have just received letters from France, with some hints that Mrs. Sterne and my Lydia are coming to England, to pay me a visit—if your time is not better employed, Yorick flat∣ters himself he shall receive a let∣ter from your lordship, <HI>en attend∣ant.</HI><PB N="17" REF="18"/>I am with the greatest regard,</P>

<P>I Was going, my dear D—n, to bed before I received your kind en∣quiry, and now my chaise stands at my door to take and convey this poor body to its legal settlement.—I am ill, very ill—I languish most affectingly—I am sick both soul and body—it is a cordial to me to hear it is different with you—no man interests himself more in your happiness, and I am glad you are in so fair a road to it—enjoy it
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
long, my D. whilst I—no matter what—but my feelings are too nice for the world I live in—things will mend.—I dined yesterday with lord and lady S— we talked much of you, and your goings on, for every one knows why Sunbury Hill is so pleasant a situa∣tion.—You rogue! you have lock'd up my boots—and I go bootless home—and fear I shall go bootless all my life—Adieu, gentlest and best of souls—adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIV. From Ignatius Sancho, to Mr. Sterne.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be an insult on your hu∣manity (or perhaps look like it,) to apologize for the liberty I am taking.—I am one of those people whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes.—The first part of my life was rather unlucky, as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the best and
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
only security for obedience.—A little reading and writing I got by unwea∣ried application.—The latter part of my life has been, thro' God's blessing, truly fortunate—having spent it in the service of one of the best and greatest families in the kingdom—my chief pleasure has been books—Philan∣thropy I adore—How very much, good Sir, am I (amongst millions) in∣debted to you for the character of your amiable Uncle Toby!—I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog∣days, to shake hands with the honest Corporal.—Your sermons have touch'd me to the heart, and I hope have amended it, which brings me to the point—In your tenth discourse, page
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
seventy-eight, in the second volume—is this very affecting passage—<Q REND="inline">"Con∣sider how great a part of our species in all ages down to this—have been trod under the feet of cruel and capri∣cious tyrants, who would neither hear their cries, nor pity their distresses.—Consider slavery—what it is—how bitter a draught—and how many mil∣lions are made to drink of it."</Q>—Of all my favourite authors not one has drawn a tear in favour of my misera∣ble black brethren—excepting your∣self, and the humane author of Sir Geo. Ellison.—I think you will for∣give me; I am sure you will applaud me for beseeching you to give one
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
half hour's attention to slavery, as it is at this day practised in our West In∣dies.—That subject handled in your striking manner would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only of one—gracious God! what a feast to a benevolent heart! and sure I am, you are an epicurean in acts of cha∣rity.—You who are universally read, and as universally admired—you could not fail.—Dear Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thousands of my brother Moors. Grief (you pa∣thetically observe) is eloquent: figure to yourself their attitudes; hear their supplicating addresses!—alas! you cannot refuse,—Humanity must com∣ply—in

<OPENER><DATELINE>Coxwould, <DATE>July 27, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is a strange coinci∣dence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a ten∣der tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation, in be∣half of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me—but why <HI>her bre∣thren?</HI> or yours, Sancho! any more
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
than mine? It is by the finest tints, and most insensible gradations, that nature descends from the fairest face about St. James's, to the sootiest com∣plexion in Africa:—at which tint of these is it, that the ties of blood are to cease? and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale, ere mercy is to vanish with them? But 'tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes, and then endeavour to make 'em so.—For my own part, I never look <HI>west∣ward,</HI> (when I am in a pensive mood at least) but I think of the burthens which our brothers and sisters are <HI>there</HI> carrying, and could I ease their
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
shoulders from one ounce of them, I declare I would set out this hour upon a pilgrimage to Mecca for their sakes—which by the bye, Sancho, exceeds your walk of ten miles in about the same proportion, that a visit of hu∣manity should one of mere form.—However, if you meant my Uncle Toby more he is your debtor.—If I can weave the tale I have wrote into the work I am about—'tis at the ser∣vice of the afflicted—and a much greater matter; for in serious truth, it casts a sad shade upon the world, that so great a part of it are, and have been so long bound in chains of dark∣ness, and in chains of misery; and I cannot but both respect and felicitate
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
you, that by so much laudable dili∣gence you have broke the one—and that by falling into the hands of so good and merciful a family, Provi∣dence has rescued you from the other.</P>

<P>I Was very sorry, my good Sancho, that I was not at home to return my compliments by you for the great courtesy of the Duke of M—g—'s family to me, in honouring my list of subscribers with their names—for which I bear them all thanks.—But you have something to add, Sancho, to what I owe your good will also on this account, and that is to send me the subscription money, which I find
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
a necessity of duning my best friends for before I leave town—to avoid the perplexities of both keeping pe∣cuniary accounts (for which I have very slender talents) and collecting them (for which I have neither strength of body or mind) and so, good Sancho dun the Duke of M. the Duchess of M. and Lord M. for their subscriptions, and lay the sin, and money with it too, at my door—I wish so good a family every blessing they merit, along with my humblest compliments.

<P>I Must acknowledge the courtesy of my good friend Sancho's letter, were I ten times busier than I am, and must thank him too for the many ex∣pressions of his good will, and good opinion—'Tis all affectation to say a man is not gratified with being praised—we only want it to be sincere—and then it will be taken, Sancho, as kindly as yours. I left town very poorly—and with an idea I was tak∣ing
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
leave of it for ever—but good air, a quiet retreat, and quiet reflections along with it, with an ass to milk, and another to ride out upon (if I chuse it) all together do wonders.—I shall live this year at least, I hope, be it but to give the world, before I quit it, as good impressions of me, as you have, Sancho. I would only covenant for just so much health and spirits, as are sufficient to carry my pen thro' the task I have set it this summer.—But I am a resign'd being, Sancho, and take health and sickness as I do light and darkness, or the vicissitudes of seasons—that is, just as it pleases God to send them—and accommodate my∣self to their periodical returns, as well
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
as I can—only taking care, whatever befalls me in this silly world—not to lose my temper at it.—This I believe, friend Sancho, to be the truest philo∣sophy—for this we must be indebted to ourselves, but not to our fortunes.—Farewel—I hope you will not for∣get your custom of giving me a call at my lodgings next winter—in the mean time I am very cordially,</P>

La Bramine assured me they used their endeavours with her to break off her friendship with me, for reasons I will not write, but tell you.—I said enough of them before she left England, and tho' she yielded to me in every other point, yet in this she obstinately persisted.—Strange infatuation!—but I think I have effected my purpose by a fal∣sity, which Yorick's friendship to the Bramine can only justify.—I wrote her word that the most amiable of women reiterated my request, that she would not write to them.

that time I should have published my sentimental work, and should be in town to receive you—yet I will shew you more real politesses than any you have met with in France, as mine will come warm from the heart.—I am sorry you are not here at the races, but <HI>les fêtes champêtres</HI> of the Marquis de Sade have made you amends.—I know B— very well, and he is what in France would be called admirable—that would be but so so here—You are right—he studies nature more than any, or rather most of the French comedians—If the Em∣press of Russia pays him and his wife a pension of twenty thousand livres a year, I think he is very well off.—

The folly of staying 'till after twelve for supper—that you two excommu∣nicated beings might have meat!—<Q REND="inline">"his conscience would not let it be served before."</Q>—Surely the Marquis thought you both, being English, could not be satisfied without it.—I would have given not my gown and cassock (for I have but one) but my topaz ring to have seen the <HI>petits maitres et maitresses</HI> go to mass, after having spent the night in dancing.—As to my pleasures they are few in compass.—My poor cat sits purring beside me—your lively French dog shall have his place on the other side of my fire—but if he is as devilish as when I last saw him, I must tutor

<P>No—not one farthing would I give for such a coat in wet weather, or dry—If the sun shines you are sure of being melted, because it closes so tight about one—if it rains it is no more a defence than a cobweb—a very sieve, o' my conscience! that lets through every drop, and like many other things that are put on only for a cover, mortifies you with dis∣appointment and makes you curse the impostor, when it is too late to avail one's self of the discovery. Had I been wise I should have examined the claim the coat had to the title of
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
<Q REND="inline">"defender of the body"</Q>—before I had trusted my body in it—I should have held it up to the light like other sus∣picious matters I have seen, how much it was likely to admit of that which I wanted to keep out—whether it was no more than such a frail, flimsy con∣texture of flesh and blood, as I am fated to carry about with me through every tract of this dirty world, could have comfortably and safely dispensed within so short a journey—taking into my account the chance of spreading trees—thick hedges o'erhanging the road—with twenty other coverts that a man may thrust his head under—if he is not violently pushed on by that d—d stimulus—you know where
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
—that will not let a man sit still in one place for half a minute together—but like a young nettlesome tit is eternally on the fret, and is for push∣ing on still farther—or if the poor scared devil is not hunted tantivy by a hue and cry with gives and a halter dangling before his eyes—now in other cases he has not a minute to throw away in standing still, but like king Lear must brave <Q REND="inline">"the peltings of a pitiless storm"</Q> and give heaven leave to <Q REND="inline">"rumble its belly full—spit fire—or spout rain"</Q>—as spitefully as it pleaseth, without finding the in∣clination or the resolution to slacken his pace lest something should be lost that might have been gained, or more

gotten than he well knows how to get rid of—Now had I acted with as much prudence as some other good folks—I could name many of them who have been made b—ps within my remembrance for having been hooded and muffled up in a larger quantity of this dark drab of mental manufacture than ever fell to my share—and absolutely for nothing else—as will be seen when they are undressed another day—Had I had but as much as might have been taken out of their cloth without lessening much of the size, or injuring in the least the shape, or contracting aught of the doublings and foldings, or con∣tinuing to a less circumference, the
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
superb sweep of any one cloak that any one b—p ever wrapt himself up in—I should never have given this coat a place upon my shoulders. I should have seen by the light at one glance, how little it would keep out of rain, by how little it would keep in of darkness—This a coat for a rainy day? do pray madam hold it up to that window—did you ever see such an <HI>illustrious</HI> coat since the day you could distinguish between a coat and a pair of breeches?—My lady did not understand derivatives, and so she could not see quite through my splen∣did pun. Pope Sixtus would have blinded her with the same <Q REND="inline">"darkness of excessive light."</Q> What a flood of

it breaks in thro' this rent? what an irradiation beams through that? what twinklings—what sparklings as you wave it before your eyes in the broad face of the sun? Make a fan out of it for the ladies to look at their gal∣lants with at church—It has not served me for one purpose—it will serve them for two—This is coarse stuff—of worse manufacture than the cloth—put it to its proper use, for I love when things sort and join well—make a philtre <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This allusion is improper.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Shewing two Things; first, what a Ra∣belaic Fellow LONGINUS RABELAI∣CUS is, and secondly, how cava∣lierly he begins his Book.</HEAD>

thing, if any man of genius and ca∣pacity amongst us for such a work, was fully bent within himself, to sit down immediately and compose a thorough—stitch'd system of the KE∣RUKOPAEDIA, fairly setting forth, to the best of his wit and memory, and collecting for that purpose all that is needful to be known, and understood of that art?—Of what art cried PANURGE? Good God! answered LONGINUS (making an exclamation, but taking care at the same time to moderate his voice) why, of the art of making all kinds of your theological, hebdodomical, rostrummical, hum∣drummical what d'ye call 'ems—I will be shot, quoth EPISTEMON, if
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
all this story of thine of a roasted horse, is simply no more than S— Sausages? quoth PANURGE. Thou hast fallen twelve feet and about five inches below the mark, answer'd EPISTEMON, for I hold them to be <HI>Sermons</HI>—which said word, (as I take the matter) being but a word of low degree, for a book of high rhetoric—LONGINUS RABELAICUS was fore∣minded to usher and lead into his dissertation, with as much pomp and parade as he could afford; and for my own part, either I know no more of Latin than my horse, or the KE∣RUKOPAEDIA is nothing but the art of making 'em—And why not, quoth GYMNAST, of preaching them
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
when we have done?—Believe me, dear souls, this is half in half—and if some skilful body would but put us in a way to do this to some <HI>tune</HI>—Thou wouldst not have them <HI>chanted</HI> surely, quoth TRIBOULET, laughing?—No, nor <HI>canted</HI> neither, quoth GYMNAST, crying!—but what I mean, my friends, says LONGINUS RABELAICUS (who is certainly one of the greatest criticks in the western world, and as Rabelaic a fellow as ever existed) what I mean, says he, interrupting them both and resuming his discourse, is this, that if all the scatter'd rules of the KERUKOPAEDIA could be but once carefully collected into one code, as thick as PA∣NURGE's

<HEAD>CHAP. II. In which the Reader will begin to form a Judgement, of what an Historical, Dramatical, Anecdotical, Allegori∣cal, and Comical Kind of a Work he has got hold of.</HEAD>
<P>HOMENAS who had to preach next Sunday (before God knows whom) knowing nothing at all of the matter—was all this while at it as hard as he could drive in the very next room:—for having fouled two clean sheets of his own, and being
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
quite stuck fast in the entrance upon his third general <HI>division,</HI> and finding himself unable to get either for∣wards or backwards with any grace—<Q REND="inline">"Curse it," says he, (thereby ex∣communicating every mother's son who should think differently) "why may not a man lawfully call in for help in this, as well as any other human emergency?"</Q>—So without any more argumentation, except starting up and nimming down from the top shelf but one, the second volume of CLARK—tho' without any felonious intention in so doing, he had begun to clap me in (making a joint first) five whole pages, nine round para∣graphs, and a dozen and a half of
<PB N="172" REF="172"/>
good thoughts all of a row; and be∣cause there was a confounded high gallery—was transcribing it away like a little devil.—Now—quoth HOMENAS to himself <Q REND="inline">"tho' I hold all this to be fair and square, yet, if I am found out, there will be the deuce and all to pay."</Q>—<HI>Why are the bells ringing backwards, you lad? what</HI> is <HI>all that crowd about, honest man?</HI> HOMENAS <HI>was got upon Doctor</HI> CLARK's <HI>back, sir—and what of that, my lad? Why an please you, he has broke his neck, and fractured his skull, and befouled himself into the bargain, by a fall from the pulpit two stories high.</HI> Alas! poor HOMENAS! HO∣MENAS has done his business!—HO∣MENAS
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
will never preach more while breath is in his body.—No, faith, I shall never again be able to tickle it off as I have done. I may sit up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings, and write as solid as a FATHER of the church—or, I may sit down whole summer days evaporating my spirits into the finest thoughts, and write as florid as a MOTHER of it.—In a word, I may compose myself off my legs, and preach till I burst—and when I have done, it will be worse than if not done at all.—<HI>Pray Mr. Such-a-one, who held forth last Sunday? Doctor</HI> CLARK, <HI>I trow; says one. Pray what Doctor</HI> CLARK <HI>says a se∣cond?</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
<HI>Why</HI> HOMENAS's <HI>Doctor</HI> CLARK, <HI>quoth a third.</HI> O rare HOMENAS! cries a fourth; your <HI>servant</HI> Mr. HO∣MENAS, quoth a <HI>fifth.</HI>—'Twill be all over with me, by Heav'n—I may as well put the book from whence I took it.—Here HOMENAS burst into a flood of tears, which falling down helter skelter, ding dong without any kind of intermission for six minutes and almost twenty five seconds, had a marvellous effect upon his discourse; for the aforesaid tears, do you mind, did so temper the wind that was rising upon the aforesaid discourse, but falling for the most part perpendicu∣larly, and hitting the spirits at right angles, which were mounting hori∣zontally
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
all over the surface of his harangue, they not only play'd the devil and all with the sublimity—but moreover the said tears, by their ni∣trous quality, did so refrigerate, pre∣cipitate, and hurry down to the bot∣tom of his soul, all the unsavory par∣ticles which lay fermenting (as you saw) in the middle of his conception, that he went on in the coolest and chastest stile (for a <HI>soliloquy</HI> I think) that ever mortal man uttered.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This is really and truly a very hard case, continued HOMENAS to himself"</Q>—PANURGE, by the bye, and all the company in the next room hearing all along every syllable he
<PB N="176" REF="176"/>
spoke; for you must know, that not∣withstanding PANURGE had open'd his mouth as wide as he could for his blood, in order to give a round answer to LONGINUS RABELAICUS's interrogation, which concluded the last chapter—yet HOMENAS's rhe∣toric had pour'd in so like a torrent, slap-dash thro' the wainscot amongst them, and happening at that <HI>uncritical</HI> crisis, when PANURGE had just put his ugly face into the above-said posture of defence—that he stopt short—he did indeed, and tho' his head was full of matter, and he had screw'd up every nerve and muscle belonging to it, till all cryed <HI>crack</HI> again, in order to give a due
<PB N="177" REF="177"/>
projectile force to what he was go∣ing to let fly, full in LONGINUS RA∣BELAICUS's teeth who sat over against him.—Yet for all that, he had the continence to contain himself, for he stopt short, I say, without uttering one word except, Z....ds—many rea∣sons may be assign'd for this, but the most true, the most strong, the most hydrostatical, and the most philosophical reason, why PANURGE did not go on, was—that the fore∣mention'd <HI>torrent</HI> did so <HI>drown</HI> his voice, that he had none left to go on with.—God help him, poor fellow! so he stopt short, (as I have told you before) and all the time HOMENAS was speaking he said not another
<PB N="178" REF="178"/>
word, good or bad, but stood gap∣ing, and staring, like what you please—so that the break, mark'd thus—which HOMENAS's grief had made in the middle of his discourse, which he could no more help than he could fly—produced no other change in the room where LONGINUS RABELAI∣CUS, EPISTEMON, GYMNAST, TRI∣BOULET, and nine or ten more honest blades had got Kerukopaedizing to∣gether, but that it gave time to GYMNAST to give PANURGE a good squashing chuck under his double chin; which PANURGE taking in good part, and just as it was meant by GYMNAST, he forthwith shut his mouth—and gently sitting down upon
<PB N="179" REF="179"/>
a stool though somewhat excentrically and out of neighbours row, but listen∣ing, as all the rest did, with might and main, they plainly and distinctly heard every syllable of what you will find recorded in the very next chapter.</P>
