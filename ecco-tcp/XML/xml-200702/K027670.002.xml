<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. To Lady D.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>July 9, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Will not send your ladyship the trifles you bid me purchase without a line. I am very well pleased with Paris—indeed I meet with so many civilities amongst the people here that I must sing their praises—the French have a great deal of urbanity in their composition, and to stay a lit∣tle
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
time amongst them will be agreea∣ble.—I splutter French so as to be understood—but I have had a droll adventure here in which my Latin was of some service to me—I had hired a chaise and a horse to go about seven miles into the country, but, <HI>Shandean like,</HI> did not take notice that the horse was almost dead when I took him—Before I got half way the poor ani∣mal dropp'd down dead—so I was forced to appear before the Police, and began to tell my story in French, which was, that the poor beast had to do with a worse beast than himself, namely <HI>his master,</HI> who had driven him all the day before (Jehu like) and that he had neither had corn, or hay,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
therefore I was not to pay for the horse—but I might as well have whistled, as have spoke French, and I believe my Latin was equal to my uncle Toby's Lilabulero—being not understood because of it's purity, but by dint of words I forced my judge to do me justice—no common thing by the way in France.—My wife and daughter are arrived—the latter does nothing but look out of the window, and complain of the tor∣ment of being frizled.—I wish she may ever remain a child of nature—I hate children of art.</P>
<P>I hope this will find your ladyship well—and that you will be kind e∣nough

to direct to me at Toulouse, which place I shall set out for very soon. I am, with truth and sincerity,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY wife and daughter arrived here safe and sound on Thursday, and are in high raptures with the speed and pleasantness of their journey, and particularly of all they see and meet with here. But in their journey from York to Paris, nothing has given them a more sensible and lasting plea∣sure, than the marks of kindness they received from you and Mrs. E.—The friendship, good will and politeness
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
of my two friends I never doubted to me, or mine, and I return you both all a grateful man is capable of, which is merely my thanks. I have taken however the liberty of sending an Indian taffety, which Mrs. E. must do me the honour to wear for my wife's sake, who would have got it made up, but that Mr. Stanhope, the Consul of Algiers, who sets off to∣morrow morning for London, has been so kind (I mean his lady) as to take charge of it; and we had but just time to procure it: and had we miss'd that opportunity, as we should have been obliged to have left it be∣hind us at Paris, we knew not when or how to get it to our friend.—I
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
wish it had been better worth a para∣graph. If there is any thing we can buy or procure for you here, (intelli∣gence included) you have a right to command me—for I am yours, with my wife and girl's kind love to you and Mrs. E.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear H.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the time you have got to the end of this long letter you will per∣ceive that I have not been able to an∣swer your last 'till now—I have had the intention of doing it almost as of∣ten as my prayers in my head—'tis thus we use our best friends—what an infamous story is that you have told me!—After some little remarks on it the rest of my letter will go on like silk. ****— is a good na∣tured
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
old easy fool and has been de∣ceived by the most artful of her sex, and she must have abundance of im∣pudence and charlatanery to have carried on such a farce. I pity the old man for being taken in for so much money—a man of sense I should have laughed at—My wife saw her when in town, and she had not the appearance of poverty, but when she wants to melt **** heart she puts her gold watch and diamond rings in her drawer.—But he might have been aware of her. I could not have been mistaken in her character—and 'tis odd she should talk of her wealth to one, and tell another the reverse—so good night to her.—About a week
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
or ten days before my wife arrived at Paris I had the same accident I had at Cambridge, of breaking a vessel in my lungs. It happen'd in the night, and I bled the bed full, and finding in the morning I was likely to bleed to death, I sent immediately for a surgeon to bleed me at both arms—this saved me, and with lying speech∣less three days I recovered upon my back in bed; the breach healed, and in a week after I got out—This with my weakness and hurrying about made me think it high time to haste to Toulouse.—We have had four months of such heats that the oldest Frenchman never remembers the like—'twas as hot as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<HI>oven,</HI> and never has relaxed one hour—in the height of this 'twas our des∣tiny (or rather destruction) to set out by way of Lyons, Montpellier, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to shorten, I trow, our sufferings—Good God!—but tis over—and here I am in my own house, quite settled by M....'s aid, and good-natured offices, for which I owe him more than I can express or know how to pay at present—'Tis in the prettiest situation in Tou∣louse, with near two acres of garden—the house too good by half for us—well furnished, for which I pay thirty pounds a year.—I have got a good cook—my wife a decent <HI>femme de chambre,</HI> and a good looking <HI>laquais</HI>—The Abbé has planned our expences,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
and set us in such a train, we cannot easily go wrong—tho' by the bye the D— is seldom found sleeping un∣der a hedge. Mr. Trotter dined with me the day before I left Paris—I took care to see all executed according to your directions—but Trotter, I dare say, by this has wrote to you—I made him happy beyond expression with your crazy tales, and more so with its frontispiece.—I am in spirits, writing a crazy chapter—with my face turned towards thy turret—'Tis now I wish all warmer climates, coun∣tries, and every thing else at — that separates me from our paternal seat—<HI>ce sera là où reposera ma cendre—et ce sera là où mon cousin viendra repondre</HI>

The humour is over for France, and Frenchmen, but that is not enough for your affec∣tionate cousin, L. S.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Toulouse, <DATE>August 14, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear F.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER many turnings (<HI>alias</HI> digressions) to say nothing of down∣right overthrows, stops, and delays, we have arrived in three weeks at Toulouse, and are now settled in our houses with servants, &amp;c. about us, and look as composed as if we had been here seven years.—In our journey we suffered so much from the heats, it gives me pain to remember
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
it—I never saw a cloud from Paris to Nismes half as broad as a twenty∣four sols piece.—Good God! we were toasted, roasted, grill'd, stew'd and carbonaded on one side or other all the way—and being all done enough <HI>(assez cuits)</HI> in the day, we were eat up at night by bugs, and other unswept out vermin, the legal inhabitants (if length of possession gives right) of every inn we lay at.—Can you conceive a worse ac∣cident than that in such a journey, in the hottest day and hour of it, four miles from either tree or shrub which could cast a shade of the size of one of Eve's fig leaves—that we should break a hind wheel into
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
ten thousand pieces, and be obliged in consequence to sit five hours on a gravelly road, without one drop of water or possibility of getting any—To mend the matter, my two po∣stillions were two dough-hearted fools, and fell a crying—Nothing was to be done! By heaven, quoth I, pulling off my coat and waistcoat, something shall be done, for I'll thrash you both within an inch of your lives—and then make you take each of you a horse, and ride like two devils to the next post for a cart to carry my bag∣gage, and a wheel to carry ourselves—Our luggage weighed ten quintals—'twas the fair of Baucaire—all the world was going, or returning—we
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
were ask'd by every soul who pass'd by us, if we were going to the fair of Baucaire—No wonder, quoth I, we have goods enough! <HI>vous avez raison mes amis</HI>—</P>
<P>Well! here we are after all, my dear friend—and most deliciously placed at the extremity of the town, in an excellent house well furnish'd, and elegant beyond any thing I look'd for—'Tis built in the form of a hotel, with a pretty court towards the town—and behind, the best gar∣dens in Toulouse, laid out in serpen∣tine walks, and so large that the company in our quarter usually come to walk there in the evenings, for
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
which they have my consent—<Q REND="inline">"the more the merrier."</Q>—The house consists of a good <HI>salle à manger</HI> above stairs joining to the very great <HI>salle à com∣pagnie</HI> as large as the Baron D'Hol∣bach's; three handsome bed-cham∣bers with dressing rooms to them—below stairs two very good rooms for myself, one to study in, the other to see company.—I have moreover cellars round the court, and all other offices—Of the same landlord I have bargained to have the use of a country-house which he has two miles out of town, so that myself and all my family have nothing more to do than to take our hats and remove from the one to the other—My
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
landlord is moreover to keep the gardens in order—and what do you think I am to pay for all this? nei∣ther more or less than thirty pounds a year—all things are cheap in propor∣tion—so we shall live for very very little.—I dined yesterday with Mr. H— he is most pleasantly situated, and they are all well.—As for the books you have received for D—, the bookseller was a fool not to send the bill along with them—I will write to him about it.—I wish you was with me for two months; it would cure you of all evils ghostly and bodily—but this, like many other wishes both for you and myself, must have its completion elsewhere—Adieu my

<SALUTE>My dear H.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your letter yesterday—so it has been travelling from Crazy Castle to Toulouse full eighteen days—If I had nothing to stop me I would engage to set out this morn∣ing, and knock at Crazy Castle gates in three days less time—by which time I should find you and the colonel, Panty, &amp;c. all alone—the season I most wish and like to be with you
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
—I rejoice from my heart, down to my reins, that you have snatch'd so many happy and sunshiny days out of the hands of the blue devils—If we live to meet and join our forces as heretofore we will give these gentry a drubbing—and turn them for ever out of their usurped citadel—some legions of them have been put to flight already by your operations this last campaign—and I hope to have a hand in dispersing the remainder the first time my dear cousin sets up his banners again under the square tower—But what art thou meditating with axes and hammers?—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart,</HI>"</Q> and thou lovest the sweet
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
visions of architraves, friezes and pediments with their tympanums, and thou hast found out a pretence, <HI>à raison de cinq cent livres ster∣ling</HI> to be laid out in four years, &amp;c. &amp;c. (so as not to be felt, which is al∣ways added by the D— as a bait) to justify thyself unto thyself—It may be very wise to do this—but 'tis wiser to keep one's money in one's pocket, whilst there are wars without and rumours of wars within.—St. — advises his disciples to sell both coat and waistcoat—and go rather without shirt or sword, than leave no money in their scrip, to go to Jerusalem with—Now those <HI>quatre ans consecutifs,</HI> my dear Anthony, are the most precious
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
morsels of thy <HI>life to come</HI> (in this world) and thou wilt do well to en∣joy that morsel without cares, calcu∣lations, and curses, and damns, and debts—for as sure as stone is stone, and mortar is mortar, &amp;c. 'twill be one of the many works of thy repen∣tance—But after all, if the Fates have decreed it, as you and I have some time supposed it on account of your generosity, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that you are never to be a monied man,</HI>"</Q> the decree will be fulfilled whether you adorn your castle and line it with cedar, and paint it within side and without side with vermilion, or not—<HI>et cela etant</HI> (having a bottle of Frontiniac and glass at my right hand) I drink, dear
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Anthony, to thy health and happi∣ness, and to the final accomplish∣ments of all thy lunary and sublunary projects.—For six weeks together, after I wrote my last letter to you, my pro∣jects were many stories higher, for I was all that time, as I thought, jour∣neying on to the other world—I fell ill of an epidemic vile fever which killed hundreds about me—The physicians here are the errantest char∣latans in Europe, or the most igno∣rant of all pretending fools—I with∣drew what was left of me out of their hands, and recommended my affairs entirely to Dame Nature—She (dear goddess) has saved me in fifty different pinching bouts, and I begin to have
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
a kind of enthusiasm now in her fa∣vour, and in my own, That one or two more escapes will make me be∣lieve I shall leave you all at last by translation, and not by fair death. I am now stout and foolish again as a happy man can wish to be—and am busy playing the fool with my uncle Toby, who I have got soused over head and ears in love.—I have many hints and projects for other works; all will go on I trust as I wish in this matter.—When I have reaped the benefit of this winter at Toulouse—I cannot see I have any thing more to do with it, therefore after having gone with my wife and girl to Bagnieres, I shall return from
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
whence I came—Now my wife wants to stay another year to save money, and this opposition of wishes, tho' it will not be as sour as lemon, yet 'twill not be as sweet as sugar candy.—I wish T— would lead Sir Charles to Toulouse; 'tis as good as any town in the South of France—for my own part, 'tis not to my taste—but I believe, the ground work of my <HI>ennui</HI> is more to the eternal plati∣tude of the French characters—little variety, no originality in it at all—than to any other cause—for they are very civil—but civility itself, in that uniform, wearies and bodders one to death—If I do not mind, I shall grow most stupid and sententious—
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Miss Shandy is hard at it with mu∣sick, dancing, and French speak∣ing, in the last of which she does <HI>à marveille,</HI> and speaks it with an ex∣cellent accent, considering she prac∣tices within sight of the Pyrenean Mountains.—If the snows will suffer me, I propose to spend two or three months at Barege, or Bagnieres, but my dear wife is against all schemes of additional expences—which wicked propensity (tho' not of despotick power) yet I cannot suffer—tho' by the bye laudable enough—But she may talk—I will do my own way, and she will acquiesce without a word of debate on the subject.—Who can say so much in praise of his wife? Few
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
I trow.—M— is out of town vin∣taging—so write to me, <HI>Monsieur Sterne gentilhomme Anglois</HI>—'twill find me.—We are as much out of the road of all intelligence here as at the Cape of Good Hope—so write a long nonsensical letter like this, now and then to me—in which say nothing but what may be shewn, (tho' I love every paragraph and spirited stroke of your pen, others might not) for you must know a letter no sooner arrives from England, but curiosity is upon her knees to know the contents.—Adieu dear H. believe me,</P>

<P>I Took the liberty three weeks ago to desire you would be so kind as to send me fourscore pounds, having re∣ceived a letter the same post from my Agent, that he would order the mo∣ney to be paid to your correspondent in London in a fortnight.—It is some disappointment to me that you have taken no notice of my letter, especi∣ally as I told you we waited for the mo∣ney

before we set out for Bagnieres,—and so little distrust had I that such a civility would be refused me, that we have actually had all our things pack'd up these eight days, in hourly expectation of receiving a letter.—Perhaps my good friend has waited till he heard the money was paid in London—but you might have trusted to my honour—that all the cash in your iron box (and all the bankers in Europe put together) could not have tempted me to say the thing <HI>that is not.</HI>—I hope before this you will have received an account of the money being paid in London—But it would have been taken kindly, if you had wrote me word you would

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THREE posts before I had the favour of yours (which is come to hand this moment) I had wrote to set Mrs. S. right in her mistake—That you had any money of mine in your hands—being very sensible that the hundred pounds I had sent you, thro' Becket's hands, was but about what would balance with you—The rea∣son of her error was owing to my writ∣ing her word, I would send you a
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
bill in a post or two for fifty pounds—which, my finances falling short just then, I deferr'd—so that I had paid nothing to any one—but was however come to York this day, and I have sent you a draught for a hun∣dred pounds—in honest truth a fort∣night ago I had not the cash—but I am as honest as the king (as Sancho Pança says) <HI>only not so rich.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore if Mrs. S. should want thirty louis more, let her have them—and I will balance all (which will not be much) with honour at Christmas, when I shall be in London, having now just finish'd my two volumes of Tristram.—I have some thoughts of
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
going to Italy this year—at least I shall not defer it above another.—I have been with Lord Granby, and with Lord Shelburne, but am now sat down till December in my sweet retirement—I wish you was sat down as happily, and as free of all worldly cares.—In a few years, my dear F. I hope to see you a real country gentleman, tho' not altoge∣ther exiled from your friends in Lon∣don—there I shall spend every winter of my life, in the same lap of con∣tentment, where I enjoy myself now—and wherever I go—we must bring three parts in four of the treat along with us—In short we must be happy within—and then few things
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
without us make much difference—This is my Shandean philosophy.—You will read a comic account of my journey from Calais thro' Paris to the Garonne, in these volumes—my friends tell me they are done with spirit—it must speak for itself—Give my kind respects to Mr. Selwin and my friend Panchaud—When you see Baron d'Holbach, present him my respects, and believe me, dear F.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear G.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Threatened you with a letter in one I wrote a few weeks ago to Foley, but (to my shame be it spoken) I lead such a life of dissipation I have never had a moment to myself which has not been broke in upon, by one engagement or impertinence or another—and as plots thicken to∣wards the latter end of a piece, I find, unless I take pen and ink just now, I shall not be able to do it,

You are teized and tormented too much by your cor∣respondents, to return to us, and with accounts how much your friends, and how much your Theatre wants you—so that I will not magnify ei∣ther our loss or yours—but hope cor∣dially to see you soon.—Since I wrote last I have frequently stept into your house—that is, as frequently as I could take the whole party, where I dined, along with me—This was but justice to you, as I walk'd in as a wit—but with regard to myself, I balanced the account thus—I am sometimes in my friend —'s house, but he is always in Tristram Shandy's—where my
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
friends say he will continue (and I hope the prophecy true for my own immortality) even when he himself is no more.</P>
<P>I have had a lucrative winter's campaign here—Shandy sells well—I am taxing the publick with two more volumes of sermons, which will more than double the gains of Shan∣dy—It goes into the world with a prancing list of <HI>de toute la noblesse</HI>—which will bring me in three hundred pounds, exclusive of the sale of the copy—so that with all the contempt of money which <HI>ma façon de penser</HI> has ever impress'd on me, I shall be rich in spite of myself: but I scorn you

must know, in the high <HI>ton</HI> I take at present, to pocket all this trash—I set out to lay a portion of it in the service of the world, in a tour round Italy, where I shall spring game, or the duce is in the dice.—In the begin∣ning of September I quit England, that I may avail myself of the time of vintage, when all nature is joyous, and so saunter philosophically for a year or so, on the other side the Alps.—I hope your pilgrimages have brought Mrs. G. and yourself back <HI>à la fleur de jeunesse</HI>—May you both long feel the sweets of it, and your friends with you.—Do, dear friend, make my kindest wishes and compli∣ments acceptable to the best and wisest

<P>I Scalp you!—my dear G—! my dear friend!—foul befal the man who hurts a hair of your head!—and so full was I of that very sentiment, that my letter had not been put into the post-office ten minutes, before my heart smote me; and I sent to recall it—but failed—You are sadly to blame, Shandy! for this, quoth I, leaning with my head on my hand, as I re∣criminated upon my false delicacy in

<P>THE first time I have dipped my pen into the ink-horn for this week past is to write to you, and to thank you most sincerely for your kind epistle—Will this be a sufficient apology for my letting it be ten days upon my table without answering it—I trust it will—I am sure my own feelings tell me so, because I felt it impossible to do any thing that is un∣gracious towards you.—It is not every
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
hour, or day, or week of a man's life that is a fit season for the duties of friendship—sentiment is not always at hand—pride and folly, and what is called business, oftentimes keep it at a distance—and without sentiment, what is friendship?—a name, a shadow!—But, to prevent a misapplication of this, (though why should I fear it from so kind and gentle a spirit as your's)—you must know, that by care∣lessness of my curate, or his wife, or his maid, or some one within his gates, the parsonage-house at Sutton was burnt to the ground, with the fur∣niture that belonged to me, and a pretty good collection of books; the loss three hundred and fifty pounds—
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
The poor man with his wife took the wings of the next morning, and fled away—this has given me real vexa∣tion, for so much was my pity and esteem for him, that as soon as I heard of this disaster, I sent to desire he would come and take up his abode with me till another habitation was ready to receive him—but he was gone—and, as I am told, through fear of my persecution.—Heavens! how little did he know of me to suppose I was among the number of those wretches that heap misfortune upon misfortune—and when the load is almost insup∣portable, still to add to the weight! God, who reads my heart, knows it to be true—that I wish rather to share,
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
than to encrease the burthen of the miserable—to dry up, instead of add∣ing a single drop to the stream of sor∣row.—As for the dirty trash of this world, I regard it not—the loss of it does not cost me a sigh, for after all, I may say with the Spanish Captain, that I am as good a gentleman as the king, only not quite so rich.</P>
<P>But to the point: Shall I expect you here this summer?—I much wish that you may make it convenient to gratify me in a visit for a few weeks—I will give you a roast fowl for your dinner, and a clean table-cloth every day—and tell you a story by way of desert—in the heat of the day we will

sit in the shade—and in the evening the fairest of all the milk-maids who pass by my gate, shall weave a gar∣land for you.—If I should not be so fortunate, contrive to meet me the be∣ginning of October—I shall stay a fort∣night after, and then seek a kindlier climate.—This plaguy cough of mine seems to gain ground, and will bring me to my grave in spight of me—but while I have strength to run away from it I will—I have been wrestling with it for these twenty years past—and what with laughter and good spirits, have prevented its giving me a fall—but my antagonist presses closer than ever upon me—and I have no∣thing left on my side but another
