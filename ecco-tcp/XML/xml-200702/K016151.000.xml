<HEAD>TO THE Most Noble PRINCE, JAMES, Duke HAMILTON, Duke of BRANDON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I reflect on your Dig∣nity, as First Peer of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> the oldest Monar∣chy of <HI>Europe,</HI> I address you with Dread: And consider my own Ambition of throwing my self, and my first Essay, in Tragedy, under the Protection of your Illustrious
<PB REF="3"/>
Name, as a Presumption, which no A∣pology can excuse, unless I seek it, in your Goodness.</P>
<P>But 'tis both natural and necessary, for Poets, to court the Favour of the Great: And the Honour, which your Grace's Indulgence vouchsafes me, on this Occasion, distinguishes you no less among the Patrons of the <HI>Mu∣ses,</HI> than your high Birth, among the Noble; for, the smaller my Merit may be judged by the World, the more glo∣rious that Humanity, which excites your Grace, to encourage it, till 'tis encreas'd by your Influence. Many a Slip might have grown to a tall Cedar, if it had been pal'd round, and wa∣ter'd, instead of being trampled upon. The most invisible Spark may be gra∣dualy blown to an illuminating Blaze, and give Delight to its Nourisher.</P>
<P>How bless'd should I conceive my self, might I ever become worthy this
<PB REF="4"/>
Regard of a Patron, the very Dawn, of whose Life, is breaking out upon the World, with a stronger Lustre, from his Merit, than it receiv'd, from his State.</P>
<P>I snatch'd this Opportunity, to ac∣knowledge, my Devotion to your Grace's Name and Family, and to stand out the first publick Predictor, that your innate Princely Qualities will ren∣der you of more Consequence to your Country, than the splendid Advanta∣ges of your Title, and great Power.</P>
<P>So glorious a Conjunction, of hap∣py Circumstances, must be the Blessing of your Grace's own Life, the Honour and good Fortune of your Friends and Dependants, and the universal Admi∣ration of the Country, that lays Claim to you: A Country, which, I am sure, you will adorn, by your Coun∣cils, and your Actions, after a Man∣ner, which has never yet been reach'd,
<PB REF="5"/>
even by the Brave and Illustrious, long, Line, of your Predecessors.</P>
<P>May the kindest Care of Heaven preserve your important Life from all Dangers, and ill Accidents, to be the Ornament of your own Age, and the great Example, and Emulation, of Posterity!</P>
<P>I am, with the profoundest Duty and Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are few Men of Learn∣ing, (except some of my own Country, misled by a Zeal both in∣discreet and unwarrantable) who do not readily acknowledge <HI>POE∣TRY,</HI> to be the Daughter of Reli∣gion, and originally design'd, to tune Men's Minds to Devotion. This is evident from the many noble Poems, in the <HI>Old Testament;</HI> to say Nothing of other Writings. But the primitive Simplicity, becoming gradually lost, as the Art was apply'd to Ends, unworthy its Institution, the Reformers were obliged to take Advantage of Mens Passions, by giving it a new Turn, which, under the Tempta∣tion of Delight, disguis'd the Doctrine they recom∣mended. <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> in particular, was the Per∣fection of the <HI>Muse's</HI> Power. Till <HI>that</HI> became known, there was wanting a kind of Poetry, which, imitating the Actions of Mankind, might work a readier, and more sensible Effect, by a Cor∣vection of the Passions. The Prevalence of Vice, 'tis true, and Men's natural Propensity to resist good Instruction, allow'd not a Success to <HI>TRAGI∣DY,</HI> so universal, as it merited. But since no bet∣ter Help, than <HI>this,</HI> can be devis'd, the Friends, of Vertue and Genius, must use the means it affords them.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
In Countries, where <HI>CHRISTIANITY</HI> is receiv'd and established, some may, possibly, imagine, there is, now, no longer Need of the Assistance of <HI>TRAGE∣DY:</HI> But Experience convinces us, That many frequent the <HI>STAGE,</HI> who would hardly be pre∣vailed upon, to receive Counsel from the <HI>PULPIT.</HI> The <HI>CLERGY,</HI> therefore, should consider, as Aux∣iliaries and Fellow-Labourers, those <HI>POETS,</HI> who preach Vertue, from the <HI>Press,</HI> or the <HI>Theatre.</HI> And since we seek not a Share of <HI>their</HI> Revenues, for the Pains we take, in their Service, they ought, at least, in Civility, to allow us their Countenance and Acknowledgement! Is there a Kirkman, among my Adversaries, whose Zeal is so militant, as to fight without Wages? Why, then, am I condemn'd, who, more generously, go to War, in a Way, they could not take themselves, were they hindred from fighting against Vice from the Pulpit! Who is so rude, as to blame an honest <HI>Volunteer,</HI> in a good Cause? Or, if one deserves, to be a <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> Why is he grudged Preferment, beyond the List and Rate, of an <HI>Half-Pay-Officer.?</HI></P>
<P>But some, who are moderate, because more wise, than <HI>those</HI> I have had to do with, con∣fess the <HI>STAGE capable</HI> of being made <HI>useful,</HI> yet condemn it, on Account of the <HI>Abuses</HI> it in∣dulges.—Would they destroy the <HI>Being</HI> of an Art, because its Use is corrupted? They argue, like those Zealous indeed, but <HI>weak</HI> Reformers, who were for demolishing Churches, that they might be sure to leave no Images. According
<PB REF="8"/>
to these Mens Way of Reasoning, every Thing, that is not perfect, is dangerous and abomina∣ble; for there is nothing so excellent, where Abu∣ses may not enter. <HI>Preaching,</HI> thêy know well, is often <HI>abused,</HI> will they allow me, therefore, to cry out, That all <HI>Preaching</HI> is <HI>unlawful?</HI></P>
<P>I writ the following short <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> to give my Countrymen, of the Kirk, an Example, that sound and useful Instruction may be drawn from the <HI>Theatre,</HI> and that, only, the Abuse is blameable. I might, indeed, have referred my over-rigid Adversaries to other Pieces of <HI>Dramatic POETRY,</HI> already extant: But some Peculiarities, in my Case, (which the World is likely to know more of, very soon,) obliged me, to give a Specimen, my self, of a Play, wherein nothing, justly, can be condemned, by the Rules of Religion and Vertue. I am, therefore, not afraid, to be try'd by good Christians; and, I hope, to pass uncensured by good Criticks also, notwithstanding the uncom∣mon Manner, in which, I have attempted it.</P>
<P>Five Acts, I know, are Customary: But they can, by no means, be proved necessary. On the Contrary, if any determinate Number were to be appointed, as a Standard, <HI>Three Acts</HI> seem bet∣ter than <HI>Five,</HI> by the Critick's own Rule. A <HI>Be∣ginning,</HI> a <HI>Middle,</HI> and an <HI>End,</HI> say these Gen∣tlemen, are the Stages of the Drama. A first Act, then, would open, and prepare, the Matter in∣tended. A Second would perfect, and heighten it to its Summit; and the Third, in a just, and na∣tural Descent, serves to clear up the Embarras∣ments,
<PB REF="9"/>
and bring on the Catastrophe. Thus, may <HI>Three</HI> Acts he defended by <HI>Reason,</HI> better than <HI>Five</HI> from <HI>Custom:</HI> But I intend not, hereby to promote the Introduction of a new Manner.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tragedy</HI> was writ so short, for want of Time to enlarge it, by Addition of other Charac∣ters, and Episodical Incidents; yet, because I would not be subject to the Reproaches of mista∣ken Petulance, I thought it necessary to observe, that if a <HI>dramatic</HI> Story is compleat, in its <HI>Prepa∣ration, Progress,</HI> and <HI>Conclusion,</HI> it is of no great Importance, what Number of Acts it con∣sists of.</P>
<P>But one general Error, if I mistake not, among Writers of <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> is a Failure in their very <HI>Principle.</HI> They teach not a <HI>Moral,</HI> but de∣scribe some Piece of <HI>History.—</HI>The Business of the <HI>STAGE,</HI> if I apprehend it rightly, is, first, to intend some general and useful <HI>Instruction,</HI> how Men may avoid certain Mischiefs in Life, by cor∣recting those Passions, which must naturally pro∣duce them; and then, to find, or invent, some <HI>Story,</HI> which may serve as an <HI>Example,</HI> for strengthening that <HI>Precept,</HI> and shew a Man made miserable by Effect of those Passions, which the Writer would teach his Audience to resist, or keep Guard against. Every Thing, in a <HI>Trage∣dy,</HI> which has not a direct, and visible, Tendency to the Moral it is writ for, is superfluous, and monstrous; and, however pompously embellished, serves for nothing, but to weaken the Instruction,
<PB REF="10"/>
and distract the Attention, and Apprehension, of an Audience.</P>
<P>I took the Hint (and only the Hint, as the Reader may see) of that Story, which I have fitted to the Moral of the following little Piece, from <HI>SHAKESPEAR'S Yorkshire Tragedy,</HI> which was put into my Hands, on purpose, by my good Friend, Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> to whom I take this Occasion of expressing my Gratitude, in the most publick manner I can; all Endeavours, beside Acknow∣ledgments, being vain, to match the Instances of his Friendship, and that uncommon Humanity, and Frankness of Spirit, so peculiar to himself, in his manner of bestowing Favours: But 'tis needless, to tell the World, how much I am oblig'd to him, and what just Sense I have of his gene∣rous Regard to me. They, who know him well, and what a Waste of his important Time he has made for my Interest, will be beforehand with my Acknowledgements, and enumerate the Advanta∣ges, which I could not miss from his Friendship.—I owe much, in the Scheme, in the Sentiments, and Language, of this Piece, to the Direction of that accomplished Gentleman, who, has either no E∣nemies, or they are such, because Strangers to his good Qualities; for, 'tis only necessary to <HI>know</HI> him, to be, by Choice, or Obligation, made invio∣lably his own.—I embrace this Opportunity of thanking him for his excellent Prologue, which so well prepared the Audience for the Representa∣tion. Nor can I help thanking him even for the Epilogue, tho' not less pleasant on my self, than
<PB REF="11"/>
on my Adversaries among the <HI>Scots</HI> Clergy; for who would not be contented under a Stroke, or two, of his Satyr, whose <HI>Praise,</HI> (as <HI>Juba</HI> says of <HI>Cato)</HI> I would rather have, than Worlds for my Admirers.</P>
<P>Before I end this Preface, I must not forget to thank the Generosity of my Friends, of all Qua∣lities, who, so nobly, grac'd the Action of my first Endeavour, in <HI>TRAGEDY.</HI> I should have very little Merit, not to improve on such Encou∣ragement.—Before so select, and illustrious an Audience, the admirable Mrs. <HI>Seymour,</HI> and the Gentlemen, who so well performed the Parts, must have felt a Satisfaction, equal to that Ap∣plause, which their Action deserved, and met with.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. Written by AARON HILL <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Spoken by Mr. RYAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WArm'd, by a Kindred Sense of <HI>England</HI>'s Woes,</L>
<L>A <HI>Caledonian</HI> Muse, with Pity, glows;</L>
<L>From ruin'd Hopes, a saving Moral takes,</L>
<L>And paints th' Unhappy, for the Happy's Sakes.</L>
<L><HI>Scotland</HI>'s new Taste our meaning Scene supplies,</L>
<L>And a first Flight, on Tragick Pinions, tries.</L>
<L>Brave, and long fam'd in Arms, her warlike Race</L>
<L>Have trod▪ the Fields of Death, with dauntless Grace!</L>
<L>Fierce, and untir'd, in Blood, have, nobly, dar'd,</L>
<L>And every Toil, and every Danger, shar'd.</L>
<L>Now, fir'd by rifing Arts, she grasps the Boys,</L>
<L>And her old Cant, like falling Stocks, decays.</L>
<L>Her long-lost Muse new-lights her ancient Flame!</L>
<L>And our Scene blazes, with recover'd Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We teach, to Night,—ah! would 'twere not too late,</L>
<L>How, rash, believing Avarice galls a State;</L>
<L>What private Sorrows, from wild Hazards, flow,</L>
<L>And how false Hope produces certain Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This,—the most natural Business of the Stage,</L>
<L>Will all your generous Hearts, tis bop'd, engage:</L>
<L>None can their Pity, for those Woes, conceal,</L>
<L>Which most, who hear, perhaps, too deeply, feel.</L>
<L>The Rants of ruin'd Kings, of mighty Name,</L>
<L>For pompous Misery, small Compassion claim.</L>
<L>Empires o'rturn'd, and Heroes, held in Chains,</L>
<L>Alarm the Mind, but give the Heart no Pains.</L>
<L>To Ills, remote from our Domestic Fears,</L>
<L>We lend our Wonder, but with-hold our Tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so, when, from such Passions, as our own,</L>
<L>Some Favourite Folly's, dreadful Fate is shown;</L>
<L>There the Soul bleeds, for what it feels within;</L>
<L>And conscious Pity shakes, at suffering Sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! give Attention, to the moving Scene,</L>
<L>And shun what yet may be, by what has been.</L>

<HEAD>THE EPILOGUE. Written by AARON HILL <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Spoke by Mrs. SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>You've seen the <HI>Play:—</HI>and <HI>I'll unfold</HI> the <HI>Poet,</HI></L>
<L>To whom,—(stray'd Sheep, of a <HI>Pure</HI> Flock!) we owe it.</L>
<L>He's a <HI>Chance-Blessing—</HI>somewhat <HI>strangely</HI> flung us!</L>
<L>Dropt—from the <HI>Clouds</HI> of <HI>Innocence,—</HI>among us!</L>
<L>Slipt, thro' the Kirk's loose Pale, <HI>We</HI> gave him Quarter—</L>
<L>Poor Soul!—He' had like to've been the <HI>Muse's Martyr.</HI></L>
<L>When <HI>Stage-Plays!—</HI>and <HI>Abominations!—</HI>took him,</L>
<L>Grace, and the Shepherds of the <HI>Saints</HI> forsook him.</L>
<L>'Twas <HI>given,</HI> thenceforth, to <HI>Satan's</HI> Power, to win him:</L>
<L>—The <HI>Root</HI> of the <HI>Sound Matter—</HI>was not in him!</L>
<L>Yet, tho' <HI>rebuk'd,</HI> full sore,—he's no <HI>huge Sinner:</HI></L>
<L>You'll scarce see <HI>One</HI> of his <HI>pure Brethren—</HI>thinner.</L>
<L><HI>Most sanctify'd</HI> of <HI>Face!</HI> Troth—I'm afraid,</L>
<L>If his <HI>Looks</HI> lie not—the poor Man's a <HI>Maid!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Bard, not <HI>carnal-minded,—</HI>say the Curious,</L>
<L>How come th' unfleshly Folks, to be so <HI>furious?</HI></L>
<L>Judge <HI>you</HI> the Quarrel, right.—we'll, briefly, show it.—</L>
<L><HI>—Good plays</HI> give good Instruction—said the <HI>Poet.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vanity!</HI> cry'd the <HI>Brethren.—</HI>Gross Defilement!</L>
<L>And, so, the War broke out, past Reconcilement.</L>
