<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable Sir <HI>ROBERT WALPOLE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THO' Strength of Genius, by Experience taught,</L>
<L>Gives Thee to found the Depths of human Thought,</L>
<L>To trace the various Workings of the Mind,</L>
<L>And rule the secret Springs, that rule Mankind;</L>
<L>(Rare Gifts!) yet, WALPOLE, wilt thou condescend</L>
<L>To listen, if thy unexperienc'd Friend</L>
<L>Can ought of Use impart, tho' void of Skill,</L>
<L>And win Attention by sincere good Will;</L>
<L>For Friendship, sometimes, Want of Parts supplies,</L>
<L>The Heart may furnish what the Head denies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>As when the rapid <HI>Rhone,</HI> o'er swelling Tides,</L>
<L>To grace old <HI>Ocean</HI>'s Court, in Triumph rides;</L>
<L>Tho' rich his Source, he drains a thousand Springs,</L>
<L>Nor scorns the Tribute each small Riv'let brings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble Ray,</L>
<L>Each Dawn of Meaning, in thy brighter Day;</L>
<L>Shalt like; or where thou can'st not like, excuse,</L>
<L>Since no mean Interest shall prophane the Muse:</L>
<L>No Malice wrapp'd in Truth's Disguise, offend,</L>
<L>Nor Flattery taint the Freedom of the Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first a generous Mind surveys the Great,</L>
<L>And views the Crowds that on their Fortune wait;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Show (tho' little understood)</L>
<L>He only seeks the Power, to do the Good;</L>
<L>Thinks, 'till he tries, 'tis Godlike to dispose,</L>
<L>And Gratitude still springs, where Bounty flows;</L>
<L>That every Grant sincere Affection wins,</L>
<L>And where our Wants have End, our Love begins:</L>
<L>But those who long the Paths of State have trod,</L>
<L>Learn from the Clamours of the murmuring Crowd;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Which cramm'd, yet craving still, their Gates besiege,</L>
<L>'Tis easier far to give, than to oblige.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This of Thy Conduct seems the nicest Part,</L>
<L>The chief Perfection of the Statesman's Art,</L>
<L>To give to fair Assent a fairer Face,</L>
<L>And soften a Refusal into Grace.</L>
<L>But few there are that can be truly kind,</L>
<L>Or know to fix their Favours on the Mind:</L>
<L>Hence some, whene'er they would oblige, offend;</L>
<L>And while they make the Fortune, lose the Friend:</L>
<L>Still give unthank'd, still squander, not bestow;</L>
<L>For great Men want not, what to give, but how.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Race of Men that follow Courts, 'tis true,</L>
<L>Think all they get, and more than all their Due:</L>
<L>Still ask, but ne'er consult their own Deserts;</L>
<L>And measure by their Interest, not their Parts.</L>
<L>From this Mistake, so many Men we see,</L>
<L>But ill become the Thing they wish'd to be;</L>
<L>Hence Discontent, and fresh Demands arise,</L>
<L>More Power, more Favour in the Great Man's Eyes:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
All feel a Want, tho' none the Cause suspects,</L>
<L>And hate their Patron, for their own Defects;</L>
<L>Such none can please, but who reforms their Hearts,</L>
<L>And, when he gives them Places, gives them Parts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As these o'erprize their Worth, so sure the Great</L>
<L>May sell their Favour at too dear a Rate;</L>
<L>When Merit pines, while Clamour is preferr'd,</L>
<L>And long Attachment waits among the Herd;</L>
<L>When no Distinction, where Distinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the many, the Superior few;</L>
<L>When strong Cabal constrains them to be just,</L>
<L>And makes them give at last—because they must</L>
<L>What Hopes that Men of real Worth should prize,</L>
<L>What neither Friendship gives, nor Merit buys!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Man who justly o'er the Whole presides,</L>
<L>His well weigh'd Choice, with wise Affections, guides;</L>
<L>Knows when to stop with Grace, and when advance,</L>
<L>Nor gives from Importunity, or Chance;</L>
<L>But thinks how little Gratitude is ow'd,</L>
<L>When Favours are extorted, not bestow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>When safe on Shore ourselves, we see the Crowd</L>
<L>Surround the Great, importunate and loud;</L>
<L>Thro' such a Tumult, 'tis no easy Task</L>
<L>To drive the Man of real Worth to ask:</L>
<L>Surrounded thus, and giddy with the Show,</L>
<L>'Tis hard for great Men, rightly to bestow;</L>
<L>From hence so few are skill'd, in either Case,</L>
<L>To ask with Dignity, or give with Grace.</L>
<L>Sometimes the Great, seduc'd by Love of Parts,</L>
<L>Consult our Genius, but neglect our Hearts;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the glitt'ring Sparks, that Genius flings,</L>
<L>They lift us cow'ring on their Eagles Wings,</L>
<L>Mark out the Flights, by which themselves begun,</L>
<L>And teach our dazzled Eyes to bear the Sun;</L>
<L>Till we forget the Hand that made us great,</L>
<L>And grow to envy, not to emulate.</L>
<L>To emulate, a general Warmth implies,</L>
<L>To reach the Virtues, that make great Men rise;</L>
<L>But Envy wears a mean malignant Face,</L>
<L>And aims not at their Virtues, but their Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such to oblige, how vain is the Pretence?</L>
<L>When every Favour is a fresh Offence,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
By which superior Power is still imply'd,</L>
<L>And, while it helps their Fortune, hurts their Pride.</L>
<L>Slight is the Hate, Neglect or Hardships breed;</L>
<L>But those, who hate from Envy, hate indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since so perplex'd the Choice; whom shall we trust,</L>
<L>Methinks I hear thee cry, the Brave and Just.</L>
<L>The Man by no mean Fears, or Hopes controul'd,</L>
<L>Who serves thee from Affection, not for Gold.</L>
<L>Who love the Honest, and esteem the Brave,</L>
<L>Despise the Coxcomb, but detest the Knave,</L>
<L>No Shew of Parts the truly wise seduce,</L>
<L>To think that Knaves can be of real Use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Man, who contradicts the publick Voice,</L>
<L>And strives to dignify a worthless Choice,</L>
<L>Attempts a Task, that on that Choice reflects,</L>
<L>And lends us Light to point out new Defects.</L>
<L>One worthless Man, that gains what he pretends,</L>
<L>Disgusts a thousand unpretending Friends:</L>
<L>And since no Art can make a Counter pass,</L>
<L>Or add the Weight of Gold to mimick Brass;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
When Princes to bad Oar their Image join,</L>
<L>They more debase the Stamp, than raise the Coin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be thine the Care, true Merit to reward,</L>
<L>And gain the Good,—nor will that Task be hard;</L>
<L>Souls form'd alike, so quick, by Nature blend;</L>
<L>An honest Man is more than half thy Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Him no mean Views, or Haste to rise, shall sway,</L>
<L>Thy Choice to sully, or thy Trust betray:</L>
<L>Ambition here shall at due Distance stand;</L>
<L>Nor is Wit dangerous in an honest Hand:</L>
<L>Besides, if Failings at the Bottom lie,</L>
<L>We view those Failings with a Lover's Eye.</L>
<L>Tho' small his Genius, let him do his best;</L>
<L>Our Wishes and Relief supply the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let others barter servile Faith for Gold,</L>
<L>His Friendship is not to be bought, or sold:</L>
<L>Fierce Opposition he, unmov'd, shall face;</L>
<L>Modest in Favour, daring in Disgrace;</L>
<L>To share thy adverse Fate, alone pretend;</L>
<L>In Power, a Servant; out of Power, a Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Here pour thy Favours in an ample Flood,</L>
<L>Indulge thy boundless Thirst of doing Good:</L>
<L>Nor think that Good to him alone confin'd;</L>
<L>Such to oblige, is to oblige Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If thus thy mighty Master's Steps thou trace,</L>
<L>The Brave to cherish, and the Good to grace;</L>
<L>Long shalt thou stand from Rage and Faction free,</L>
<L>And teach us long to love the King, thro' Thee.</L>
<L>Or, fall a Victim dangerous to the Foe,</L>
<L>And make him tremble, when he strikes the Blow;</L>
<L>While Honour, Gratitude, Affection join</L>
<L>To deck thy Close, and brighten thy Decline;</L>
<L>(Illustrious Doom!) the Great when thus displac'd,</L>
<L>With Friendship guarded, and with Virtue grac'd,</L>
<L>In awful Ruin like <HI>Rome</HI>'s Senate fall,</L>
<L>The Prey, and Worship of the wondering <HI>Gaul.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No doubt, to Genius some Reward is due,</L>
<L>(Excluding that were satyrizing You;)</L>
<L>But yet, believe thy undesigning Friend,</L>
<L>When Truth and Genius for thy Choice contend,</L>
<L>Tho' both have Weight, when in the Balance cast,</L>
<L>Let Probity be first, and Parts the last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>On these Foundations if thou durst be great,</L>
<L>And check the Growth of Folly, and Deceit;</L>
<L>When Party Rage shall droop thro' Length of Days,</L>
<L>And Calumny be ripened into Praise;</L>
<L>Then future Times shall to thy Worth allow,</L>
<L>That Fame which Envy would call Flattery now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far my Zeal, tho' for the Task unfit,</L>
<L>Has pointed out the Rocks where others split;</L>
<L>By that inspir'd, tho' Stranger to the Nine,</L>
<L>And negligent of any Fame—but Thine,</L>
<L>I take the friendly, but superfluous Part;</L>
<L>You act from Nature, what I teach from Art.</L>
