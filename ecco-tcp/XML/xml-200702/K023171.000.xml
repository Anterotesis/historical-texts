<L><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OT twice a twelvemonth you appear in Print,</L>
<L>And when it comes, the Court see nothing in't.</L>
<L>You grow <HI>correct</HI> that once with Rapture
writ,</L>
<L>And are, besides, too <HI>Moral</HI> for a Wit.</L>
<L N="5">Decay of Parts, alas! we all must feel—</L>
<L>Why now, this moment, don't I see you steal?</L>

'Tis all from <HI>Horace:</HI> did not <HI>Horace</HI> say</L>
<L>"Lord <HI>Fanny</HI> spun a thousand lines a day?</L>
<L>And long before you, in much better metre,</L>
<L>"Laugh at those Fools who put their trust in <HI>Peter?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>Horace,</HI> Sir, was delicate, was nice;</L>
<L><HI>Bubo</HI> observes, he lash'd no sort of <HI>Vice:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Horace</HI> would say, <HI>Sir</HI> Billy <HI>serv'd the Crown,</HI></L>
<L>Blunt <HI>could do Bus'ness,</HI> H—ggins <HI>knew the Town,</HI></L>
<L N="15">Sir <HI>George</HI> of <HI>some slight Gallantries</HI> suspect,</L>
<L>In rev'rend <HI>S—n</HI> note a <HI>small Neglect,</HI></L>
<L>And own, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> did a <HI>waggish thing,</HI></L>
<L>Who cropt our Ears, and sent them to the King.</L>
<L>His sly, polite, insinuating stile</L>
<L>Could please at Court, and made AUGUSTUS smile:</L>
<L>An artful Manager, that crept between</L>
<L>His Friends and Shame, and was a kind of <HI>Screen.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><L>Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico</L>

But 'faith your very Friends will soon be sore;</L>
<L><HI>Patriots</HI> there are, who wish you'd jest no more—</L>

<L>The Great man never offer'd you a Groat.</L>
<L>Go see Sir ROBERT—</L>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>See Sir ROBERT!—hum—</L>
<L>And never laugh—for all my life to come?</L>
<L>Seen him I have, but in his happier hour</L>
<L N="30">Of Social Pleasure, ill-exchang'd for Pow'r.</L>
<L>Would he oblige me? let me only find,</L>
<L>He thinks one Poet of no venal kind.</L>
<L>Come, come, at all I laugh He laughs, no doubt,</L>
<L>The only diff'rence is, I dare laugh out.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Why yes: with <HI>Scripture</HI> still you may be free;</L>
<L>A Horse-laugh, if you please, at <HI>Honesty;</HI></L>
<L>A Joke on JEKYL, or some odd <HI>Old Whig,</HI></L>
<L>Who never chang'd his Principle, or Wig:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
A Patriot is a Fool in ev'ry age,</L>
<L N="40">Whom all Lord Chamberlains allow the Stage:</L>
<L>These nothing hurts; they keep their Fashion still,</L>
<L>And wear their strange old Virtue as they will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any ask you, "Who's the Man, so near</L>
<L>"His Prince, that writes in Verse, and has his Ear?</L>
<L N="45">Why answer LYTTELTON, and I'll engage</L>
<L>The worthy Youth shall ne'er be in a rage:</L>
<L>But were his Verses vile, his Whisper base,</L>
<L>You'd quickly find him in Lord <HI>Fanny</HI>'s case.</L>
<L><HI>Aegysthus, Verres,</HI> hurt not honest FLEURY,</L>
<L N="50">But well may put some Statesmen in a fury.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Laugh then at any, but at Fools or Foes;</L>
<L>These you but anger, and you mend not those:</L>
<L>Laugh at your Friends, and if your Friends are sore,</L>
<L>So much the better, you may laugh the more.</L>
<L N="55">To Vice and Folly to confine the jest,</L>
<L>Sets half the World, God knows, against the rest;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Did not the Sneer of more impartial men</L>
<L>At Sense and Virtue, balance all agen.</L>
<L>Judicious Wits spread wide the Ridicule,</L>
<L N="60">And charitably comfort Knave and Fool.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Dear Sir, forgive the Prejudice of Youth:</L>
<L>Adieu Distinction, Satire, Warmth, and Truth!</L>
<L>Come harmless <HI>Characters</HI> that no one hit,</L>
<L>Come <HI>Henley</HI>'s Oratory, <HI>Osborn</HI>'s Wit!</L>
<L N="65">The Honey dropping from <HI>Ty—l</HI>'s tongue,</L>
<L>The Flow'rs of <HI>Bub—ton,</HI> the Flow of <HI>Y—ng!</HI></L>
<L>The gracious Dew of Pulpit Eloquence;</L>
<L>And all the well-whipt Cream of Courtly Sense,</L>
<L>That first was <HI>H—vy</HI>'s, <HI>F—</HI>'s next, and then</L>
<L N="70">The S—te's, and then <HI>H—vy</HI>'s once agen.</L>
<L>O come, that easy <HI>Ciceronian</HI> stile,</L>
<L>So <HI>Latin,</HI> yet so <HI>English</HI> all the while,</L>
<L>As, tho' the Pride of <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Bland,</HI></L>
<L>All Boys may read, and Girls may understand!</L>
<L N="75"><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Then might I sing without the least Offence,</L>
<L>And all I sung should be the <HI>Nation</HI>'s <HI>Sense.</HI></L>
<L>So—Satire is no more—I feel it die—</L>
<L>No <HI>Gazeteer</HI> more innocent than I!</L>
<L>And let, a God's-name, ev'ry Fool and Knave</L>
<L N="80">Be grac'd thro' Life, and flatter'd in his Grave.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Why so? if Satire know its Time and Place,</L>
<L>You still may lash the Greatest—in Disgrace:</L>
<L>For Merit will by turns forsake them all;</L>
<L>Would you know when? exactly when they fall.</L>
<L N="85">But let all Satire in all Changes spare</L>
<L>Immortal <HI>S—k,</HI> and grave <HI>De—re!</HI></L>
<L>Silent and soft, as Saints remove to Heav'n,</L>
<L>All Tyes dissolv'd, and ev'ry Sin forgiv'n,</L>
<L>These, may some gentle, ministerial Wing</L>
<L N="90">Receive, and place for ever near a King!</L>
<L>There, where no Passion, Pride, or Shame transport,</L>
<L>Lull'd with the sweet <HI>Nepenthe</HI> of a Court;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
There, where no Father's, Brother's, Friend's Disgrace</L>
<L>Once break their Rest, or stir them from their Place;</L>
<L N="95">But past the Sense of human Miseries,</L>
<L>All Tears are wip'd for ever from all Eyes;</L>
<L>No Cheek is known to blush, no Heart to throb,</L>
<L>Save when they lose a Question, or a Job.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Good Heav'n forbid, that I shou'd blast their Glory,</L>
<L N="100">Who know how like Whig-Ministers to Tory,</L>
<L>And when three Sov'reigns dy'd, could scarce be vext,</L>
<L>Consid'ring what a Gracious Prince was next.</L>
<L>Have I in silent wonder seen such things</L>
<L>As Pride in Slaves, and Avarice in Kings,</L>
<L N="105">And at a Peer, or Peeress shall I fret,</L>
<L>Who starves a Mother, or forswears a Debt?</L>
<L><HI>Virtue,</HI> I grant you, is an empty boast;</L>
<L>But shall the Dignity of <HI>Vice</HI> be lost?</L>
<L>Ye Gods! shall <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Son, without rebuke</L>
<L>Swear like a Lord? or <HI>Rich</HI> out-whore a Duke?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
A Fav'rite's <HI>Porter</HI> with his Master vie,</L>
<L>Be brib'd as often, and as often lie?</L>
<L>Is it for <HI>W—rd</HI> or <HI>Peter</HI> (paltry Things!)</L>
<L>To pay their Debts or keep their Faith like Kings?</L>
<L>If<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of a Book intitled, The Oracles of Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</NOTE> <HI>Blount</HI> destroy'd himself, he play'd the man,</L>
<L>And so may'st Thou, Illustrious <HI>Passeran!</HI></L>
<L>But shall a <HI>Printer,</HI> weary of his life,</L>
<L>Learn from their Books to hang himself and Wife?</L>
<L>This, this, my friend, I cannot, will not bear;</L>
<L N="120">Vice thus abus'd, demands a Nation's care;</L>
<L>This calls the Church to deprecate our Sin,</L>
<L>And hurls the Thunder of the Laws on <HI>Gin.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let humble <HI>Foster,</HI> if he will, excell</L>
<L>Ten Metropolitans in preaching well;</L>
<L N="125">A simple Quaker, or a Quaker's Wife,</L>
<L>Out-do <HI>L—d—ffe,</HI> in Doctrine—yea, in Life;</L>
<L>Let low-born ALLEN, with an aukward Shame,</L>
<L>Do good by stealth, and blush to find it Fame.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<HI>Virtue</HI> may chuse the high or low Degree,</L>
<L N="130">'Tis just alike to Virtue, and to me;</L>
<L>Dwell in a Monk, or light upon a King,</L>
<L>She's still the same, belov'd, contented thing.</L>
<L><HI>Vice</HI> is undone, if she forgets her Birth,</L>
<L>And stoops from Angels to the Dregs of Earth:</L>
<L N="135">But 'tis the <HI>Fall</HI> degrades her to a Whore;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Greatness</HI> own her, and she's mean no more:</L>
<L>Her Birth, her Beauty, Crowds and Courts confess,</L>
<L>Chaste Matrons praise her, and grave Bishops bless:</L>
<L>In golden Chains the willing World she draws,</L>
<L N="140">And hers the Gospel is, and hers the Laws:</L>
<L>Mounts the Tribunal, lifts her scarlet head,</L>
<L>And sees pale Virtue carted in her stead!</L>
<L>Lo! at the Wheels of her Triumphal Car,</L>
<L>Old <HI>England</HI>'s Genius rough with many a Scar,</L>
<L N="145">Dragg'd in the Dust! his Arms hang idly round,</L>
<L>His Flag inverted trails along the ground!</L>
<L>Our Youth, all liv'ry'd o'er with foreign Gold,</L>
<L>Before her dance; behind her crawl the Old!</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
See thronging Millions to the Pagod run,</L>
<L N="150">And offer Country, Parent, Wife, or Son!</L>
<L>Hear her black Trumpet thro' the Land proclaim,</L>
<L>That "Not to be corrupted is the Shame."</L>
<L>In Soldier, Churchman, Patriot, Man in Pow'r,</L>
<L>'Tis Av'rice all, Ambition is no more!</L>
<L N="155">See, all our Nobles begging to be Slaves!</L>
<L>See, all our Fools aspiring to be Knaves!</L>
<L>The Wit of Cheats, the Courage of a Whore,</L>
<L>Are what ten thousand envy and adore.</L>
<L>All, all look up, with reverential Awe,</L>
<L>On Crimes that scape, or triumph o'er the Law:</L>
<L>While Truth, Worth, Wisdom, daily we decry—</L>
<L>"Nothing is Sacred now but Villany."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet may this Verse (if such a Verse remain)</L>
<L>Show there was one who held it in disdain.</L>
