<HEAD>An Enquiry into the Disposal of the Equivalent.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the Subject of Debate for sometime, now whether we should have an Equivalent in <HI>Scotland</HI> for such Pay∣ments as are to be made on a Coalition of the Nations? — but whether what was Proposed, was Equal, was really an Equivalent or no? And the World has been long hurried with these Enquities.</P>
<P>But now here arises a new Cloud, and tho' 'tis not only no bigger than a Mans Hand, but is never like to be bigger; yet as it is drest up, it threatens mighty things: and this is, what you shall do with the Equivalent when you have it.</P>
<P>'Tis a little hard, People that cry up your National Sagaci∣ty, in their Arguments against an Equivalent in general, should question your Sagacity in knowing what to do with the Mo∣ney when you have it.</P>
<P>To Answer therefore the Doubts of some, and prevent the Objections of others, I shall enter a little briefly on an En∣quiry into the manner of disposing the Equivalent you are to have; or, in short, Enquire how you shall employ the Money when it comes.</P>
<P>And in general, as to this Head, I think the nature of the Payment it self, and the very words of the Treaty direct Us to the use to which this Money is to be employ'd, viz. <HI>An Equi∣valent.</HI></P>
<P>The Property here will have no alteration in its Denomina∣tion, it remains an Equivalent to its last Circulation in∣to the Chaos of the current Cash of <HI>Britain;</HI> you receive it as an
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Equivalent, and you pay it as an Equivalent, 'tis an Equivalent pay'd you for Money, which by your Customs and Excises will of course be appropriated to the uses of another Nation after the Union, which Nation therefore advances you the Sum <HI>in specie,</HI> that you may not be out of Purse on their Account.</P>
<P>When you have it, you dispose of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an Equivalent to the <HI>African-Company</HI> for the demise and dissolution of their Society, there being Companies in <HI>England</HI> already embark'd in those Trades, and double Com∣panies having prov'd incompatible, as in the two <HI>East-India-Companies,</HI> who if they had remain'd ununited to this time, had been both ruin'd: And the Members of this Company ha∣ving by the Union full leave to come in to the said <HI>English</HI> Company, as freely, and on the same Conditions as <HI>Englishmen</HI> may, It is agreed the <HI>Scots</HI> Company shall cease, and for a Satisfaction, the first part of the Equivalent is appropriated to be an Equivalent for the said Company, by paying the Subscri∣bers their Principal and Interest, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompany expiring, sets them down just where it took them up, and I think they ought to esteem it a very happy Landing, and what without the Assistance of <HI>England</HI> they could not have obtain'd by Trade in 20 Years.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Head for the disposing this Money, is as an E∣quivalent for the Coin, which by the Treaty is to be reduced to the Standard of the <HI>English</HI> Money.</P>
<P>I shall say very little to a Gentlemans Paper, who is for having this Equivalent made good before that to the <HI>African Company,</HI> as a thing of vast Moment to the Nation.</P>
<P>If I understand the Dispute, <HI>one previous Question well dis∣cuss'd,</HI> will effectually Answer all his Objections; and that is, Whether there is not enough in the Equivalent, that <HI>Englond</HI> is to Pay, to Discharge both, and if that be true, the mighty Dispute drops of course, and it is not one Farthing matter which of these two go first.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
I cannot but think the Gentleman that wrote that Sheet, went on a Calcul of the Coin as false, as he has done of the Equivalent it self, where he mistakes Ninety Thousand Pound atone Clap, and no wonder he is in such concern, since he has lost such a Sum out of the whole, just at his first setting out, for he says, 'tis 309885 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> and the several Times, where∣as if I think right, 'tis just 398085 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>sh.</HI></P>
<P>I shall therefore attempt here two things, 1. Examine what the <HI>species</HI> of Coin are that are to be reduced. And 2ly To make a probable conjecture at the Deficiency.</P>
<P>For the <HI>species, I</HI> shall observe the words of the Treaty say, not the current Money in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the <HI>current Coin of</HI> Scotland, and this distinction will immediatly lead me to this Negative.</P>
<P>That you are not to imagine, as some have very grosly done, that the Forreign Coins, which the Error of Custom, the Dis∣aster of Trade, and the Searcity of Bullion, have made cur∣rent here at an extravagant rate, should be brought into your Mint and be recoin'd; and the Owner of such Money be allow'd the difference from the Rate of their present Valuation to the Price of that new Standard—, let no Men flatter themselves with such a Notion, if this were true, it would not only expose <HI>Scotland</HI> to innumerable Incoveniencies, but might in∣deed soon eat up the whole Equivalent; since as there must be a certain stated time given for bringing in the Money into the Mint, all the Rix Dollars in <HI>Europe</HI> might be brought into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the difference between their real and imaginary Va∣lue, be paid in <HI>specie</HI> by the Publick, and the Owner receive the new Money for the Remainder, which difference would make it very well worth while, to bring the Dollars from Abroad, and carry back the <HI>British</HI> Crowns in their Room, or may lay out the Money in any part of <HI>Britain</HI> in Manufactures, Corn or Lead, and carry them cheaper to Market than any Na∣tive of <HI>Britain</HI> can do it, his Money costing him less than theirs does.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
This was exactly the Case in <HI>England,</HI> when Guineas rose from 21 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> each to 30. The Merchants in <HI>Holland</HI> &amp; <HI>Ham∣burgh</HI> immediatly fall to buying of Gold, and send it to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> by all possible Conveyance, so much as by the very Post, and such was the hurry, that had it held much longer, all the Gold in <HI>Europe</HI> would have flow'd into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, that the <HI>English</HI> Merchants were struck out of their own Trade. A <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant could buy Bayes at <HI>Colchester,</HI> or Sarges at <HI>Exeter,</HI> and send them to <HI>Spain,</HI> and sell 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than the <HI>English</HI> Merchants that liv'd at the same Town: The Case was plain, the Gold which in <HI>Holland</HI> stood them in 4 <HI>l.</HI> to 4 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and tho' at last it rise up to 5 <HI>l. per</HI> Ounce, yet in <HI>England</HI> went for a∣bove 6 Pound, and so their Money cost them 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> less than the <HI>English</HI> Merchant could buy for.</P>
<P>From this Example I think 'tis evident, that the Forreign Coin has no concern in this Reduction.</P>
<P>If it had been answered, that this then will be an immediate Loss to the Nation, and to private Persons also: I Answer,</P>
<P>To the Nation it can be no Loss, because, when ever such Pieces came into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the imaginary Value was an Addi∣tion to its real Value; and so raised its Currency to the Credit of the general Stock: And when ever it goes away again, the Difference is only an imaginary Diminution, and stands to the Debit of the publick Stock in the same manner; and the gene∣ral Value of <HI>Scotland</HI> receives no real Alteration.</P>
<P>Money is a real intrinsick Species appointed by Custom, as the Medium of Trade to bring Commerce in all its particular States to a Ballance—So much as its real Value amounts to, so much real Wealth is in that Nation, and this real Value is every where the same; But its <HI>Received Value</HI> differs in the several Nations, according to the particular Circumstances of those Nations, as to Coin, Standards, Plenty or Scarcity of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
These Differences are again reconcil'd among Merchants, and all is brought to PAR in their Negotiating, by adding or diminishing, as the imaginary Differences in Value require between Nation and Nation, or Port and Port, and this is called Exchange, a thing full of Nicety, and which I take to be the best Accomplishment of a compleat Merchant.</P>
<P>'Tis true the Rates of Exchange differ, rise and fall, accor∣ding to the Quantities of Money that lye to Draw or to Re∣mitt: But this is a thing that depends so much on the Artifice of the Merchant or Exchanger, that it has little regard to the real Differences of the Species; and therefore it is not to my purpose.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Negative relates to the Coin of <HI>England,</HI> which is now current here, such as Guineas of Gold and Silver Pieces, of the Crown, Half Crown, Shilling and Sixpence; These I presume shall find no Alteration here, and being the same to which the Coin of <HI>Brittain</HI> is to be reduced, there can be no melting them down, for that would be to do nothing at all, but melt the Half Crown into Half a Crown, and a Shilling into a Shilling, and so on.</P>
<P>As to the Loss upon this Money, it is impossible to have it Rectified by any Law, or any just Equivalent given for it; Since, should any time be given for that, it would make a wild Trade to fetch a Million or two of it from <HI>England,</HI> carry it into the Mint, demand 1 <HI>d. per</HI> Shilling, and immediately carry back the very same Species again.</P>
<P>I confess I should have thought these Negatives of no Use, had I not seen abundance of People weak enough to ima∣gine they should receive Satisfaction here from the Publick for all the Deficiency of the imaginary Value of Forreign Money.</P>
<P>I could spend some time to shew Examples, but I think it needless; <HI>England</HI> made three Essays about Money, and these are Examples enough; in two of them they made no Equiva∣lent for Loss, and in the third they did, and they exactly hit the Case.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HI>First,</HI> They reform'd the Guineas, and gave no Equivalent for the Loss; they sunk them from 30 to 22 <HI>shil.</HI> each at one Blow, and some rich Engrossers of those pleasant Manufactories lost great Sums of Money by it.—The Reason was plain, it was a Distemper in Trade, and wanted a Cure, every Man had a Share in the Benefit at first, and every Body ought to bear their Share of the Burden, and take their Chance for their Particulars.</P>
<P>Another time, the Parliament finding Trade opprest by a Flux of <HI>French</HI> Pistoles, reduc'd them to 17 <HI>shil.</HI> each, and for this there was no Equivalent offered, for the Evil was of the same Original.</P>
<P>And here by the way I must Note, That it was not a Mis∣chief to <HI>England</HI> to have a Flux of Gold, either Guineas or Pistoles; Nor can it be to <HI>Scotland,</HI> if SHE had ten Millions of Dollars among her current Money; But the Evil is, these several Coins going There or HERE at an Advance in Price, by which Your Neighbours always have this Advantage, That They draw Your Goods a∣way at the Price of all that imaginary Value.</P>
<P>At last the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> fell to work with their own Coin, Reduc'd it all to the Standard, and Recoin'd it; And then they allow'd an Equivalent to the Proprietor—Because now they did not Reduce advanc'd Value, but took in the very Species; At which time Clipping, Counterfeiting, and such like Abuses had made it really Deficient in the Spe∣cies: This the Government was obliged to, and so in <HI>Scotland</HI> it will be of Course.</P>
<P>Now, the Gentleman that Quarrels at this, argues, this is a mighty Concern, and is angry 'tis put off to the last, or Ex∣crescence, as he calls it of the Equivalent, since 'twill <HI>Ʋn∣doubtedly be an Ʋnknown and Insupportable Loss and Hazard to the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Now, not to spend time to be merry upon the blunder of the Loss, being insupportable first, and then unknown; I would be glad this insupportable Burden might be examined, and I'll go the nearest way to it that I can.</P>
<P>It is plain none but the Coin is to be reduced, and when all the present Coin is call'd in, I believe no Man will say it is likely it should amount to 100000 <HI>lib. Sterling</HI> in Silver.</P>
<P>Of this a great part is in the new Coin, 5 <HI>d.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>d.</HI> 40 <HI>d.</HI> Pieces, and of these there can be no Loss, if the Gentle∣men who have carried so great a Quantity Abroad lately in <HI>specie</HI> should be pleased to carry away a few more, there would be so few left as would effectually take off the Loss on that Head.</P>
<P>As to the old 14 <HI>sh.</HI> Pieces, and 7 <HI>d.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> Half Penny, the Quantity is very small, and all the rest is Copper-Money, the deficiency of which cannot be much. And upon the whole, if this Gentleman will please to procure a Tack or Farm upon this Casuality, I shall at any time bring him People, that giving unquestionable Security to the Go∣vernment, shall undertake all the Loss and Deficiency, and make it good to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Coinage excepted, on the whole Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> for 30000 <HI>lib. Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>If this be so then, the mighty weight of insupportable Loss is at an end.</P>
<P>I know it is enquir'd here, Whether on reducing the Coin to the Standard, the Prices of Goods, Labour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall not fall in all places, and so <HI>Scotland</HI> suffer a Loss here, which may be indeed insupportable, and tho' I know a long Answer is expected to this, mine will be very short.</P>
<P>I Answer, This is no Loss at all, for this only Reason.</P>
<P>There is a sinking the imaginary Value indeed, but no sink∣ing the real Value.</P>
<P>The <HI>Species</HI> is not debased, nor your Standard allayed, and therefore tho' your Goods, Manufactories and Labour seem to sink, they really do not sink.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10" MS="y"/>
'Tis true you shall buy as much for 12 <HI>d.</HI> then as you do for 13 <HI>d.</HI> now, but that you buy for 12 <HI>d.</HI> now, shall sell for as much Abroad as that you bought for 13 <HI>d.</HI> before, and you shall remit Home at the same Price too.</P>
<P>The Poor Man shall Labour as much now for 12 <HI>d.</HI> as he did before for 13 <HI>d.</HI> but then his 12 <HI>d.</HI> shall now buy as much Provision for his Family as his 13 <HI>d.</HI> would do be∣fore.</P>
<P>The Landlord shall receive but 12 <HI>d.</HI> for his Farm, that be∣fore pay'd him 13, but he shall buy as many Horses or Houses, Lands or Goods for his 12 <HI>d.</HI> as he could before for his 13 <HI>d.</HI> so that every way the Intrinsick remains the same, and the Na∣tion has no Loss.</P>
<P>In Forreign Exchanges it is the same, your Value is all over the World the same, from <HI>England</HI> you shall draw without Gain, but then you remit without Loss, and which way soever you turn as to Ballance of Exchange, 'tis the same thing, because the intrinsick Value of the <HI>species</HI> remains the same.</P>
<P>All the imaginary Inconveniencies about the Coin, with re∣spect to the time of Coinage, may as effectually be Answered as this: And the Practice in <HI>England</HI> is a Precedent to go by, if the Currency of the Mint be supported by a small Sum of new Money before Hand, there can be no inconvenience of time or stop of <HI>species,</HI> &amp; therefore the sad Complaint the Author of that Sheet makes of Forreign Bills being Protested, or Landlords ruin∣ing the poor Tennent for want of <HI>species</HI> of current Money, is at an end.</P>
<P>Indeed if the old Money was to be call'd in before the new Money was to be given out, there might be some stop, and for want of Money Trade might suffer some Inconvenience, Bills be Protested, and the like.</P>
<P>But 'tis but keeping the old Money current till the gross of the new Money be delivered out, it will circulate insensibly, and not the least sensible hesitation be felt.</P>
