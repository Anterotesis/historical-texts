So far I hope you'll allow me to be an Author. I shall give you, gentle Reader, (if you are so) Three of my Reasons why I publish these following Pages; which, I must confess, are not so well polish'd as I cou'd wish, but Truth is amiable tho' in Rags. The first and chiefest, to get Money; for tho' I have a considera∣ble Income, yet I can never bring both points together at the Year's End; but how∣ever, don't blame my Oeconomy, since I owe you nothing, and if I am beholden to any Body, it is to Honest <HI>Chetwood,</HI> my Bookseller; (I beg his Pardon if I miscall him, tho' I don't believe it will anger him in the least, for all Men love to be term'd so, whether they deserve it or no) being he will run the greatest Risque if my Book does not sell. Second, to save my Lungs, and a great deal of Trouble in repeating to

my Friends these following Adventures, for now they may at a small Expence get 'em by Heart, if they will endeavour to stretch their Memories. Third and lastly, to appear in Print, which was, I assure you, a great Motive with me as well as with a great many others of the same Rank, that make Work for many Prin∣ters, tho' as little to the Purpose as my self. I cou'd give a Catalogue of some of 'em, but that wou'd be making my Preface exceed the Bulk of my Book. Tho' I cou'd put the Booksellers in a Way to save Money in their Pockets, and that is to persuade a great many Authors to print their Lucubra∣tions at their own Charge, and that might make some of the poorest to desist; but for the richer Sort of Authors, there's no Help, it's like the Itch, and they must write to be scratch'd tho' the Blood comes. The follow∣ing Sheets, however extraordinary they ap∣pear, I assure you upon the Word of a Man are Truth, and I hope they will entertain you; but if they don't, and you should chance to slight 'em, you will not anger</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF <HI>Capt.</HI> RICHARD FALCONER. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS born at a Town call'd <HI>Bruton,</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> of Parents tolerably well to pass in the World; my Mother dy'd when I was very young: My Father, <HI>Richard Falconer,</HI> had been a great Traveller in his Days, and his frequently
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
repeating his Adventures abroad, made me have a great Desire to follow his Steps: I often begg'd he would let me go to Sea with some Captain of his Acquaintance; but he would often say, <HI>Dick,</HI> stay where you are, you know not the Hazard and Dan∣gers attend a maritime Life: You shall have a good Trade in your Belly, and that will keep you from a Desire of rambling; there∣fore tell me what Calling you like best, that I may immediately put you out in Order to your living hereafter: You know, conti∣nu'd he, that my Fortune is but small, and I living to the extent of it, it will not be possible for me to leave you wherewithal to support you without some Employment. Therefore, (reply'd I) as you have a Daugh∣ter, you may leave your Substance to her, she must be provided for; as for our Sex, we can best take Care for our selves, and if you please but to fit me out to Sea, even in what Station you think convenient, it shall be all I will desire. Son, (says my Father) think no more of going to Sea, for I'll not have it so; I know it is only a Desire of Youth, prone to change: If I should give you leave, I am assur'd one Week's Voyage would make you wish to be at home again. I us'd all the Arguments my young Sense prompted me with, but all to no purpose, my Father was not to be mov'd, and thus
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
I liv'd two Years longer with him in Expectation of his Mind altering. At last an Accident happen'd that farther'd my Desires, and tho' it was the Ruin of our Family, I must confess, I was not much concern'd.</P>
<P>My Father was Supervisor of a Tax laid upon the burning of Pipes, and he having gather'd a Sum of Money, amounting to 3800 <HI>l.</HI> in order to pay in to the Govern∣ment for the King's Use, was by an under Excise-man, robb'd of the whole Sum, who made his Escape. My Father us'd all possible Means to apprehend him without Noise, but all his Endeavours were fruit∣less: so finding his Affairs in a desperate Condition, resolv'd to retire to some Part of the World, where he might be safe from the griping Hands of the Law. One Morning just before his voluntary Exile, he call'd me to him: <HI>Dick</HI> (says he) you have been often desirous of going to Sea, and I have always us'd Arguments to dis∣suade you from it; but now since what has happen'd, it being impossible for me to continue upon the Place of my Birth, the Patrimony of my Ancestors, I must e'en recommend that way of Life to you which I should never have chose, but that the Exigency of my Affairs will not permit me to provide any other Way for
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
you. Here (continu'd he) take this 100 <HI>l▪</HI> which I can ill spare out of my little For∣tune, but since it is all I can do for you, take it, and may Heaven prosper thy Un∣dertakings; may the Blessing of a Father always live with you, whose Prayers shall ever be sent to our Almighty Creator for thy Welfare. Here (added he) is a Let∣ter of Recommendation for you to Cap∣tain <HI>Pultney,</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> whose Friend∣ship I am sure will be of service to you. With that, he embrac'd me with Tears in his Eyes, gave me his Blessing, kiss'd me and took his leave for ever, for never have my Eyes beheld him since.</P>
<P>This Parting, I think, was the greatest Grief my Thoughts had ever known 'till then; (for nothing could be fonder, or shew more paternal Affection, than my dear Father at his last Farewel) but the Joy of my being at Liberty to follow my own Desires, soon drowned my Sorrow for parting with so good a Parent.</P>
<P>I had now nothing to do but to pro∣vide my little Equipage in order to go to <HI>Bristol</HI> to my Father's Friend; I pack'd up my Things in a Portmantua, and gave them to an old Servant of my Father's, who would see me as far as <HI>Bristol,</HI> for his sake. We set out in the Morning, and reach'd it by Noon: I enquir'd for
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> and by good Fortune found him at his Dwelling House, in <HI>Rat∣cliff</HI> Street, he having remov'd himself from another Street, which caus'd some Difficulty in the finding. I acquainted him who I was, and gave him my Father's Letter. He read it, and receiv'd me very kindly: It was to this Effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> Pultney,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Hope you'll forgive this Trouble of your Friend. I have sent my Son to you, in order to get him some Post by Sea, I know it is in your Power to do it: some∣thing has happen'd that hinders my pro∣viding for him as I ought. I would have waited on you in Person, but a Gap has happen'd in my Affairs that I shall never close again. <HI>Dick</HI> will tell you all. Let me conjure you by our old Friendship to take all the Care you can of him; and whenever he comes to <HI>England,</HI> let him come to you, for as yet I know not where to lead my wretched Life; so that I shall confide in you, and let you know by a Let∣ter, or Messenger, as soon as possible, where I shall settle;</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> (says the Captain) I am heartily sorry for your Father's Misfortunes, which he tells me in his Letter you will inform me of. After I had given him the whole Story, he told me he would provide for me as soon as possible, and till then I should be as welcome to him as his own Son: In the mean time, says he, I would have you verse your self in the Mathematicks, which may be of use to you: I'll take Care to provide you a Master, and Instruments; which accordingly he did; and as I had a great Desire to be a∣broad, and had some small Knowledge of it which I learn'd at School, apart from my other Studies, I soon attain'd to the Theory of it.</P>
<P>After I had run through the Course of Mathematicks, and the Captain was in∣form'd I was capable, he got me to be Mate (or rather Assistant) on board the <HI>Albion</HI> Frigate, Captain <HI>Wase</HI> Commander; and on the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1699, we set sail, (bound for <HI>Jamaica)</HI> with a fair Wind. As soon as we lost sight of Land, I began to be extremely Sea-sick, and bore the Jests of the Sailors but indifferently; who cry'd, There's an excellent Master's-Mate, he'll hit <HI>Jamaica</HI> to a Hair, if the Island were no bigger than the Bung-hole of a Cask. I must confess, I believe my self
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
to be the only Person who ever set out on his first Voyage, as Master's-Mate, with∣out having seen a River that was naviga∣ble. But in a Day or two I was perfect∣ly well, and was never troubled with any Sickness afterwards.</P>
<P>We had nothing material happen'd to us 'till we enter'd the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> where we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm; the Billows ran Mountains high, and our Vessel seem'd to be the Sport of the Waves: A Ship that overtook us the Day before, and accompany'd us, tho' it were not at Half a Furlong distance, was sometimes lost, by reason of the Heighth of the Waves. The Storm continu'd with this Violence three Days, and at last abated something of its Fierceness, but still blew very hard. The other Vessel by firing a Gun, and mak∣ing a Signal, made it appear she was in distress, but the Sea ran so high it was im∣possible to give them any Assistance, yet we bore down to them (being to wind∣ward) as nigh as we could without Danger to our selves; we enquir'd into the Mat∣ter, and found she had sprung a Leak; they had all Hands to pump by turns, but yet the Water gain'd on them. They begg'd of us to hoist out our Boat (their own being stav'd) to give them Succour upon occasion: Accordingly we put out our
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Long-Boat, with two of our Men in it, but the Rope that held her to the Ship broke by the Violence of the Waves, and drove away with the two unfortunate Men in her, and what became of them we could never learn; but undoubtedly they perish'd by the Sea, or Hunger, we being 70 Leagues from any Shore. The Ship, after prodigious Labour of the Sailors, and in less than ten Minutes, sunk to the Bot∣tom; out of Fifty seven Men, but Four were sav'd, and they, by good Fortune, laid hold on Ropes we threw out for that Purpose; but it had not been possible to save any, if we had not bore down to Leeward when we saw them in the last Extremity. And here we ought to ad∣mire at Providence; For this very Vessel was a Pyrate, one Captain <HI>Jones,</HI> Com∣mander, who in an open large Boat set out from <HI>Dover,</HI> and near <HI>Ostend</HI> stole upon a <HI>French</HI> Vessel in the Night, mur∣der'd the Captain and some others, and set all the Sailors a-shore that would not embrace their Designs, and had resolv'd to attack us as soon as the Storm was over. The Four Men that were sav'd, were three <HI>English</HI> Men, and one <HI>French</HI> Man, who said they were forc'd, with several others, by the above mention'd Captain <HI>Jones,</HI> to take to that Course of Life; but whe∣ther
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
true or false, I can't tell; indeed they behav'd themselves very well with us all the Voyage, and were enter'd into our Books as Four of the Ship's Crew, in∣stead of Two we left on Shore, who were not to be found when we set sail, and the two poor Wretches that were lost in the Boat. The Storm still continu'd, but the Wind fair, so we ran it away with a riv'd Fore∣sail all Night, and the next Morning we had a violent Storm of Rain, and some Thunder, but about Noon the Sky clear'd up, the Rain ceas'd, and the Tempest was laid; the Wind however continuing fair, with a midling Gale.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 28th. we discover'd the <HI>Cana∣ries</HI> and the Pike of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and pass'd this Island, or rather Rock, of a prodigi∣ous Heighth. At Night the Wind rose again, and continu'd to blow very hard for two Days. As I was walking on the Deck one Morning, my Chops were sa∣luted with a Fish which drop'd down; I took it up, panting at the Gills for Life; it prov'd to be a flying Fish, pursu'd (as I suppose) by some Dolphin, or Albecore; the Manner of these Fishes avoiding their Enemies, is jumping out of the Water, and flying 'till their Wings are dry, then fall down again into the Sea. The Dol∣phin that chases them is one of the finest
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
colour'd Fish that swims. I have observ'd our Painters draw them bending like a Bow; but I think it is as strait a Fish as any in the Sea. We caught one of them with a Fizgig, an Instrument made of se∣veral Rows of iron Spikes, bearded like Hooks, and a Staff four or five Foot long to it; to this they tye a Cord of a great length, and dart it with all their Strength; the wounded Fish immediately flownces downward many Fathoms, and up again, which the Darter observes, giving him Rope and Play 'till his Weakness makes him more tame; then they draw him up the Ship's-side, and cut him in Pieces. The first we caught in this Manner was about six Foot long, which we dress'd, and part of it serv'd the whole Ship's Com∣pany for Dinner; as soon as it was caught it lost that beautiful Colour it had in the Water; as for my own Part, notwithstand∣ing their praising it, I had rather eat a Herring or a Mackrel than this rare Fish. I don't know whether these Fish can hear, or love Musick, but this I am sure of, we had an excellent Trumpet on board, which diverted us in good Weather, and I have observ'd, that at the Sound of it the Number of these Dolphins seem'd to en∣crease, and swim within two Foot of our Vessel; but that may be pure Accident;
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
yet I fancy there's something in't, that oc∣casion'd the Fable of <HI>Amphion</HI> and the Dol∣phin. Sharks are taken as we take com∣mon Fish, only the Hook is about two Foot long, and an iron Chain above that about four Foot long, and a long Rope to that; they generally bait the Hook with a Piece of Beef of three or four Pounds, which the voracious Fish swallows imme∣diately, Hook and all; then they give him play a while, and when he is pretty well spent, they draw him in with a Tackle: There's always one stands ready with an Axe to make a Divorce between his Tail and his Body, otherwise he would give such large Thumps with it that might do the Ship Damage: I my self was thrown down but with a Touch of it. This that we took, had in his Paunch the Collar∣bone of a Man, and a Boatswain's silver Whistle, with a red Ribbon in it, entire, not so much as bruis'd, which was given to me as a Present, to make me amends for the Fall I receiv'd; it may be seen at my Bookseller's, if any one has the Cu∣riosity to ask for it; as to the Collar-bone, not any one would accept of it, so I re∣turn'd it to the watry Element again.</P>
<P>We past the <HI>Tropick,</HI> attended by the <HI>Tropick</HI>-Birds, a Fowl something bigger than a Pidgeon; but one would think, as
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
it flies, it had an unlighted Candle fix'd in its Tail. I cannot let go the Cere∣mony of passing this <HI>Tropick:</HI> When you are in the Latitude, the old Sailors ask the rest of the Ship's Crew, Whether they were ever that way before? If not, they must either pay a Bottle and Pound, (as they call it) or be duck'd: They that don't pay, are fix'd to a Rope at the Main-Yard-Arm, and duck'd three Times in the Sea; at which the rest of the Crew Huz∣za! and fire a Volley of Small-shot.</P>
<P>When Admiral <HI>Benbow</HI> went with his Squadron of Men of War, the whole Fleet duck'd, but the Admiral gave 'em Notice, by first firing a Gun, which was immediately follow'd with a Volley of Muskets, and Huzzaing, by every Ship in the Fleet. A Day or two before our Account is out, we send a Man to the Topmast-head, in order to discover Land, where he stays an Hour, and looks about him: He that discovers it first, is rewarded with a Bottle and Pound; that is, a Bottle of Rum, and a Pound of Sugar, which is demanded as soon as the Anchor is cast in a Place where such Commodities are to be had. Now the Bottles and Pounds that accrue from the People that are not willing to be duck'd, in passing the <HI>Tropick,</HI> are re∣serv'd
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
by the old Sailors for a merry Bout, when safe in Harbour; which must not be touch'd by the fresh Men, as they call 'em.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 3d, our Man at the Topmast-head, instead of crying, Land, (as we expected) call'd out, A Sail! a Sail! which in a quarter of an Hour we dis∣cover'd plainly upon Deck. We did not know what to think of it, we knew we were near Land, and consequently in fear of those Pyrates, or Buccaniers, that infest those Coasts: Our Captain call'd all Hands aloft; and told us, Gentlemen, 'Tis One to One, but this Vessel we see may be a Pyrate, if so, how must we behave our selves? If you are resolv'd to stand it, I'll stand it to the last; if not, we'll surrender with∣out firing a Gun, which may induce 'em to be civil to us. The Sailors cry'd, Let's fight 'em, let's fight 'em. With that, we put our Chests in the Hold, and brought up our Hammocks, to place 'em in the Netting on the Quarter-Deck; we clear'd our Guns, which were Twelve, and muster'd our Men, which amounted to Thirty-eight, Passengers and all, who were as willing to fight as any of us, they having something on Board that was valuable; and some of 'em, perhaps,
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
all their Fortune. We kept our Way, and the Ship bore up to us, with all the Sail she could make. Night coming upon us, our Man at the Topmast-head discover'd Land, and another Ship to the Windward of us. With that, we call'd another Council, and persisted in our first Opinion of fighting; but yet to use all Means possible of making to Shore, (which was <HI>Barbadoes:)</HI> But for all our Endeavours, the first Ship got up with us, and about Twelve a Clock at Night hail'd us, and commanded us to hoist out our Boat, and come on Board him, with our Captain. We answer'd, We had never a Boat, (as indeed we had not) but we told him, if he would stay till Morning, something might be done. At last he threatned to sink us, if we wou'd not send our Captain aboard im∣mediately; and thereupon fir'd a Gun, which struck our Vessel on her Quarter. With that, we fir'd our Broad-side upon him, accompany'd with some small Arms; which they little expecting, (I believe) did some Damage, and put 'em in Con∣fusion. Whereupon we tack'd about, and with our other six Guns rak'd her fore and aft; but was immediately seconded with a Broad-side from them, which kill'd us two Men, and wounded a third.
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
Upon which, with loud Huzza's and Firing, they immediately boarded us on our Starboard-Quarter, and pour'd into us at least fourscore Men: We resisted 'em with all the Force we had, but all to no purpose; they drove us into the Fore-castle, where, by good Chance, we made shift to barricade our selves; but they threaten'd to turn our own Guns upon us, if we did not surrender imme∣diately: But our Captain being resolute, order'd us to fire upon 'em with our small Arms. Now we had under the Greatings, close to our Steerage, a large Cistern, lin'd with Tin, where we had unwittingly plac'd several Cartriges of Pow∣der, but happily for us, whether it was our Firing, or in the Bustle some Match dropt in, I know not, but the Powder took fire, blew up the Greatings, with some part of the Quarter-Deck, and thir∣ty of the Enemy, at least, into the Air. Upon that, we sally'd out, and drove the rest, with our Cutlashes, into their own Vessel again, with the loss of several. But this signify'd little, for with the Fall and Breach of our Quarter-Deck, the Pow∣der-Room was entirely stopp'd up; nor cou'd we, without great Difficulty, clear it from the Lumber, so that we had not any Powder, but what was in the Mens
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
Cartriges, for their Muskets: However, we fir'd briskly with 'em; yet neverthe∣less they prepar'd to Board us again, with all the Menaces imaginable. This Fight continu'd at least four Hours, and the Dawn began to break upon us, which discover'd to us the other Ship we saw over Night, and we distinguish'd <HI>English</HI> Colours; with that we gave a great Shout, and fir'd our small Arms again. The E∣nemy no sooner saw the Ship with <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Colours, but they cut off their Grap∣pling-Irons, and did their Endeavour to make off, but their Rigging was so shat∣ter'd, that their Sails cou'd not be hoisted. In the mean Time the other Ship came up to us, and, without hailing, pour'd a Broad-side into the Pyrate, and there fol∣low'd a desperate Fight between them. As for our Ship, it was of little Use, so we steer'd off, and clear'd our Gun-Room, and in half an Hour (the Fight continu∣ing all that while) we had charg'd our Great Guns, and return'd to the Fight; but upon the Instant we saw the Pyrate sinking, the <HI>English</HI> Ship had tore a Hole between Wind and Water, that she sunk in a Moment, and but eight Men sav'd, who told us their Captain was a Pyrate, from <HI>Guadalupe;</HI> that when they were sinking, they had not above twenty Men
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
left, out of an Hundred and sixty; and most of them wounded. The Ship that gave us this seasonable Rescue was the <HI>Guernsey</HI> Frigate, whose Station was <HI>Bar∣badoes.</HI> We lay by for an Hour or two, to repair our Rigging, &amp;c. and hail'd her, desiring 'em to send a Boat on Board for our Captain, because we were without one; which accordingly they did. Captain <HI>Wase</HI> and I went immediately on Board, to pay our Respects to their Commander, who receiv'd us with all imaginable Ci∣vility. We had, on Board our Ship, se∣ven Sailors, and two Passengers, killd; the one, <HI>Joseph Ridge</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the other, <HI>Daniel Thompson</HI> of <HI>Mevis,</HI> Merchant; and four wounded. The <HI>Guernsey</HI> had sixteen Men kill'd, and three wounded; among which was the Lieute∣nant, who died the same Day of a Wound he received in his Thigh, with a Musket Ball chew'd, which made the Wound mortal. The Captain invited us to dine with him, which we did; where we were treated with a new Dish, (at least to me) a <HI>Pollo,</HI> that is, Fowls boil'd with Rice and salt Pork; which was very pa∣latable. We took our Leaves of the Captain, and went on Board of our own Vessel, and at five a Clock in the Even∣ing,
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<HI>(July</HI> the 4th,) after saluting the Town, cast Anchor in <HI>Carlisle</HI> Bay.</P>
<P><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> for its bigness, is the richest and best peopled Island in all <HI>America;</HI> it is seated in thirteen Degrees, twenty Minutes; in length, twenty four measur'd Miles, and in the broadest Part about six∣teen: It resembles a Leg of Mutton, with the Knuckle off. The <HI>North</HI> and <HI>East</HI> Sides are fortify'd by Nature, from any Harm from Ships of War, by reason there is no Anchoring Place. On the <HI>South-East</HI> and <HI>Westerly</HI> Part, are four excellent, commodious, well-fortify'd Harbours: The chief is that where we now ride, which will contain a Thousand Sail of Ships, free from the Danger of any Winds. At the bottom of this Harbour, stands the Capitol of the Island, call'd St. <HI>Mi∣chael</HI>'s; with a Fort at each End, and a Platform in the middle; which makes it of Strength sufficient to oppose▪a Royal Navy: 'Tis a neat large Town, with two Churches, one with a handsome Organ: For Largeness, I think this Town may compare with our City of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> but better inhabited. As for the other three, which are, 1. <HI>Charles</HI> Town. 2. St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Town.</HI> 3. <HI>Little Bristol</HI> in <HI>Spright</HI>'s Bay, I can give no manner of Account of: But for my Reader's Satisfaction, if he

will consult <HI>Ligon</HI>'s History of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he may come to the best Knowledge of the whole Island. They are govern'd by the same Laws as we in <HI>England.</HI> A Native of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> told me, the whole Island contain'd at least 120000 Inhabi∣tants, Slaves included.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 20th. (after our Captain had left his Passengers, and part of his Car∣go) we set sail for <HI>Jamaica:</HI> Here you must note, that from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> you always have the Wind in your Stern. We pass'd <HI>Martinico, Do∣minica, Guadalupe,</HI> and <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and the first of <HI>August</HI> anchor'd at <HI>Mevis,</HI> where we had immediately the Friends of Mr. <HI>Daniel Thompson,</HI> Merchant, on Board us, to unlade the Goods; for they had heard of his Death, by a Vessel from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> a Week before.</P>
<P><HI>Mevis,</HI> or <HI>Nevis,</HI> lies in seven Degrees, nineteen Minutes; it is six Leagues in Circumference: There is but one Har∣bour in the whole Island, which some call <HI>Mevis</HI> Harbour, or <HI>Bath Bay,</HI> where lies the Town, under the former Denomina∣tion. It is pretty well secured with a Fort and Platform of Great Guns. I was inform'd by one of the Inhabitants, that there is a Mineral Water, very good to bathe in, which cures the same Distem∣pers
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
with our <HI>Bath</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> settled here, <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1628. and have increas'd from One hun∣dred and forty, to Five thousand and up∣wards. They send abroad as much Su∣gar, Ginger, Cotton, and Tobacco, as any Island of its Bigness in the <HI>Caribbees.</HI> They are very regular in their Government here, they neither allow of Drunkenness, nor Whoring, (I mean in common, as in <HI>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c.) Here I was first saluted with a little Fly, call'd a <HI>Mus∣keto,</HI> and tho' it is small, yet it has a devilish sharp Sting with it. They get into our Stockings, and are so very trou∣blesome to new Comers, that there's hardly any bearing of 'em. If you scratch the Places stung by 'em till the Blood comes, it may prove dangerous; I my self kept a sore Leg three Months upon that account. I was also inform'd there was a Flea they call <HI>Chigos,</HI> which breed in Dust, or Ashes; and of all the Insects in the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> this is the most dangerous: They get into the Nails of the Toes im∣perceptibly, and from thence run over all the Body; tho' they chiefly fix themselves in the bottom of the Feet: Which occa∣sions an itching, follow'd with Holes in the Skin. They make Blisters as big as Peas in the Flesh, where their young ones
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
breeding, cause Ulcers and rotten Flesh, which there is no Remedy for, but to eat away the Parts affected, with <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> and Burnt-Alum. While we lay here, there was a Sword Fish ran himself ashore, (which was suppos'd to be done in eager∣ly chasing some other Fish:) It had no Scales, but a dusky Skin, and a white Bel∣ly, rough like a Smith's File, a flat Head, two Fins on each side, two on the Back, and one instead of a Tail. It is a Fish of prodigious Swiftness: The Sword (which is fix'd in the Head) is six, seven, and some∣times eight Foot long: Near his Eyes are two Nostrils, out of which he throws the Water a great heighth into the Air. This Fish often encounters with the Whale, and proves too hard for him; for with his Sword he rips up the Whale. I bought one of these Swords of a poor Inhabitant, for four Bottles of <HI>English</HI> Beer, (which is a great Rarity with them) that he got in a Piece of a Wreck, but thrust in so far, that the End, in getting out, was broke three Inches.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Mevis,</HI> lies St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> (or, as we generally call it, St. <HI>Kit's)</HI> in seventeen Degrees, and twenty five Mi∣nutes, <HI>Northward</HI> of the Equinoctial. It is twenty five Leagues in Circumference, the Soil light and sandy, and produces
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
Fruit common with us in <HI>England.</HI> In the middle of this Island rises a high Mountain, from which runs Streams of fresh Water, that sometimes swell so high with sudden Rains, that they drown all the Country near 'em. This Island is in∣habited by both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> who even in the Time of War live very friend∣ly together. There was formerly disco∣ver'd a Silver Mine here, which the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> claim an equal Title to; but neither make any Use of it, by reason of the want of Miners. The <HI>English</HI> Li∣berties are better peopled than the <HI>French,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> have more Conveniencies, and better fortify'd Places than the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> An <HI>English</HI> Fryar belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Jesuits, (who gave me this De∣scription) told me, that the <HI>French</HI> had built a Town, call'd, <HI>Basse Terre</HI> (in a Harbour of the same Name, and chief in the Island) full as big as <HI>Gravesend,</HI> with very handsome Houses, for the Merchants, and Trades People, which are many; where there is also an Hospital to maintain their indigent sick, together with a handsome Free-school, with large Endowments, for the Children of the Island. But what they mostly brag of, is their Castle, which is built about a Furlong from the Sea, at the Foot of a high Mountain, shadow'd
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
with great Trees: In the Way thither, stand the Houses of the Governour, and other Officers, for more Security; seated in a Walk of Orange and Lemon Trees, from the Brow of the Sea up to the Castle; which is three Story high, built with Freestone and Brick: The Halls and Chambers are very lightsome and high, and the Walls are adorn'd with Cedar: On the Top is a flat Terrace, which yields a delightful Prospect all over the Country. The Winds which blow from the Hills, so tempers the Heat, that it makes it more pleasant than any other Island of the <HI>Ca∣ribbees.</HI> As to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, they are not much inferior to the <HI>French;</HI> they have six Churches, and two Chapels, for Divine Service. This Island was plant∣ed jointly by <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in 1625. Captain <HI>Thomas Warner,</HI> for the <HI>English,</HI> and one <HI>Desnambuc,</HI> for the <HI>French.</HI> The Natives made a vigorous Resistance, but to little Purpose. With this Success, they return'd back to their several Countries, and went again and settled there; but the <HI>English</HI> having more Supplies from <HI>London,</HI> daily encreas'd; when on the contrary, the Merchants at <HI>Paris</HI> grew weary, seeing no Return for all the Char∣ges they had been at. But whilst this Business seem'd to go on with Success, an
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
Accident happen'd, which ruin'd all at once. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> set out a Fleet the same Year, of thirty one Galloons, three Galleases, and four Pinnaces, with four thousand Men, under the Command and Direction of <HI>Frederick de Toledo,</HI> from <HI>Cadiz, Antonio Nunnez Barrico,</HI> and <HI>Francisco de Almeida,</HI> Commanders of twenty Galleys, from <HI>Portugal;</HI> these join∣ed with the abovementioned, with a Re∣solution to drive the <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> entirely out of the <HI>American</HI> Islands. Coming before <HI>Mevis,</HI> they took nine <HI>English</HI> Vessels: After that they sail'd to St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> where Captain <HI>Des∣nambuc</HI> (altho' not prepar'd for Defence, because their Fortifications were not fi∣nish'd) drew all his Forces near the Shore, to hinder their Landing: But Captain <HI>Ros∣sey,</HI> who commanded another Port, suf∣fer'd 'em to land without the least Re∣sistance. Whereupon young <HI>Desnambuc,</HI> Lieutenant of a Company under <HI>Rossey,</HI> sally'd out, and fell valiantly on the first Company of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> killing many of 'em, and put 'em to the Rout; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being seconded by another Batta∣lion, he was slain, after having made a stout Resistance, and forsaken by all his Men. <HI>Rossey,</HI> upon this, abandons his Intrench∣ments, and flies to the Hills, and high
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
Grounds: Whereupon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be∣came Masters of the Forts, but durst not follow <HI>Rossey,</HI> for fear of an Ambuscade; which Fear prov'd true: For <HI>Desnambuc</HI> un∣dermining the Fort, retir'd on Board some Vessel, prepar'd for that Purpose, and made off. In the mean time, the Powder taking Fire, blew up the Fort, and six hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> into the Air. The <HI>English</HI> relying upon the League between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> made no Resistance, but sent Agents to <HI>Toledo,</HI> &amp;c. to put him in mind of the League between their Masters: To which he reply'd, That St. <HI>Christophers</HI> being part of the <HI>Western</HI> World, was given by the Pope to his Master <HI>Philip.</HI> Nevertheless he gave 'em six of the nine Vessels they took at <HI>Mevis,</HI> to imbark themselves, on Condition they wou'd sail immediately for <HI>England;</HI> which they a∣greed to: But the six Vessels not holding all, the rest were left on the Island, for an∣other Opportunity. No sooner was <HI>To∣ledo</HI> out of sight, but the remaining part of the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants took fresh Cou∣rage, and rebuilt several Forts, and made every thing ready for Defence, if Occasion shou'd be. In the mean Time <HI>Desnam∣buc</HI> suffer'd a great deal of Hardship, thro' ill Weather, and want of Provision; ha∣ving been at several Islands, intending to
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
settle, with his little Company, but not liking any of 'em, and hearing that the E∣nemy were gone to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> were busy tilling their Grounds, he return'd to his former Station, where they suffer'd many Hardships; till some Vessels from the <HI>Netherlands</HI> arriv'd, and fur∣nish'd 'em with Provisions, Ammunition, and Cloaths, upon Credit: But in a few Years they paid all, and grew rich, from their plentiful Stock of Tobacco, Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, till they brought it to the rich and flourishing State it now re∣mains in.</P>
<P>Having ended our Affairs, we set Sail for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the 21st of <HI>August,</HI> 1699; and on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> anchor'd safe in <HI>Port Royal</HI> Harbour, in the great and flourishing Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> without any Accident. This was our last Station: Here we were to unlade the remaining part of our Goods, and take in its Return, Rum, Sugar, and Spice.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> is the only Mart of all <HI>America</HI> for the <HI>English,</HI> which drive a large Trade here; but Wic∣kedness is in its full Perfection: I remem∣ber Captain <HI>Wase</HI> ask'd one of our Men, that had spent some Money ashore, what was his Opinion of the Honesty of the Women of <HI>Port Royal?</HI> Why truly, says
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
<HI>Tarr</HI> very bluntly, if there's one honest Woman shou'd happen to tumble down, I believe there's never another to take her up. Provision is prodigious dear here; two or three of us went on shore to Dinner, one Day, at <HI>Port Royal,</HI> where we had only a roasted Turkey, wretchedly lean, and nothing nigh so well tasted as our <HI>English</HI> Turkeys, and our Eating came to Thirty Shillings; but then, to make amends, Money is plenty enough. We had a Sai∣lor on Board, that had been a Taylor by Trade; this Fellow got Leave of the Cap∣tain to go on shore for a Month, where he clear'd, by working Journey-Work, twelve Pound for that Month: But then he had the Ship's Provision carry'd on shore to him two or three times a Week; had he been to have paid for his Diet, he had sav'd but a small Matter. I was mightily surpriz'd to see a Market for Turtle, in the same Manner as our Butchers. This is a Meat, or rather Fish, of an odd Nature, but of an excellent Taste; the Lean looks like the Flesh of Pork, but something of a deeper red; the Fat is a sort of a light green, but very luscious; this is the com∣mon Diet of the Slaves, or meaner sort of People; but if Strangers eat too much of it, it's apt to give 'em the Bloody-Flux. This is a very reigning Distemper here,
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
and carries off abundance of new Comers. The Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> lies—Leagues <HI>North</HI> from the <HI>Southern</HI> Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in the Sea call'd <HI>Mare del Nor;</HI> and <HI>South</HI> from the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> about twelve Leagues; and twenty <HI>West</HI> from <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> in eighteen Degrees <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude; and beareth from <HI>Rio de Hach, North-West,</HI> a hundred and fifty Leagues; from <HI>Santa Martha, N. N. W.</HI> a hun∣dred and thirty-five; from <HI>Carthagena, N.</HI> a hundred and fourteen; from <HI>Portobello, N. E.</HI> and by <HI>N.</HI> a hundred and ninety; from the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien, N.</HI> and by <HI>E.</HI> a hundred and seventy; and from the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> a hundred and fifty. Its Form is almost oval; being in Length, from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> about fifty four Leagues; from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> in the broadest part, twenty three Leagues, going narrower toward each End, like a Rowling-Pin, (a good Comparison.) In Circumference, one hundred and fifty Leagues. The Air of this Island is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable, than any of the other Islands, by reason of the cool Breezes which constantly blow from the <HI>East,</HI> with frequent Showers of Rain, and Dews that fall in the Night. These Dews are very pernicious to careless drunken People, that lie expos'd all Night to 'em. This
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
is also the only Isle of the <HI>Barloventi,</HI> which is not subject to violent Storms, and Hurricanes, as the other Islands are. And the Diseases that are predominant here, are only bred by Intemperance; as Surfeits, Bloody-flux, Fevers, and Agues; or occasion'd by ill Diet, or Slothfulness. This Island is well water'd with Springs and Rivulets of fresh Water, (with many handsome Rivers stor'd with several sorts of Fish;) and is all over (especially in the <HI>Western</HI> Parts) full of high Mountains and Hills: It is also well wooded; for the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Parts chiefly abound with large and tall Woods. Neither is there wanting Savanna's, or Plains. The Com∣modities of this Island are very many; and first, for Vegetables; the Sugars are so good, that they now out sell those of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> 5 <HI>s. per Cent.</HI> Tobacco is so excellent, that it is bought up faster than the Planters can cure it: The Indigo is al∣so here very good: The Cotton is much the best of all the neighbouring Islands: Tortoise-shell is very plenty here. Here are also great Variety of Dyewood, as <HI>Fust-wick, Red-wood,</HI> a kind of <HI>Log-wood, Cedar, Mohogeny, Lignum-vitae, Ebony, Granadille,</HI> and many others. Nay, there's many Mines, both of Silver, Copper, and Gold; but that the Inhabitants think it
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
wou'd be dangerous to break 'em up, for fear of drawing the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Buccaniers upon 'em. There are several Fishermen who have found pieces of Am∣bergrease upon the Surface of the Water, near the Shore. Ginger grows better here than in any other Part of <HI>America;</HI> and Cod-Pepper very plentifully: And also, a certain Kind of Spice call'd, <HI>Piemete,</HI> in Form of <HI>East-India</HI> Pepper, of a very aro∣matical and curious Taste, partaking, as it were, of several Species together: It grows wild among the Mountains, and is highly valu'd among the Inhabitants. Of Medi∣cinal Plants I have seen several, as <HI>Guaia∣cum, China-root, Cassia, Fistula Veuillard, Achiotes, Tamarines, Contrayerva, Ciperas, Adiantum-nigrum, Aloes, Cucumis Agris∣tis, Sumach, Acacia, Misselto,</HI> with many other Drugs and Balsams. The ingenious Sir <HI>Hans Sloan</HI> has wrote an elaborate Book of the Plants of this Island. <HI>Co∣chineal</HI> is produc'd by a Plant that grows in this Country, but not brought to Per∣fection, without much Care and Industry. This Island is also very well stock'd with Cat∣tle, as Horses, Cows, and Asses; there have been many Mules, but the Inhabitants made so little Use of 'em, that now there are but few. Sheep are large and tall, and their Meat indifferently good, but their
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
Fleece worth nothing. <HI>Goats</HI> (or <HI>Cabi∣rates)</HI> are without Number, being a Beast peculiar to the Country. Hogs, both wild and tame, in abundance. I have been hunting the wild Hog in <HI>Porta Morant</HI> Bay, and it gives good Diversion, though sometimes dangerous: You go with some Ten or a Dozen in Company, arm'd with a Musket and a Cutlash; as soon as ever (with your Dogs) you have found 'em out, you all take Aim, and fire as quick as you can; but if you don't kill 'em immediate∣ly with your Shot, they set upon you open-mouth'd, so that you must either hew 'em down with your Cutlashes, or club your Muskets. Generally as soon as you have 'em, you flay 'em, as you do Mut∣ton, and <HI>barbicue</HI> 'em, even in the very Place where you kill 'em; that is, you dig a square Hole in the Earth, then clap four Stakes at each Corner, and on 'em put your Meat, so make a Fire under it, and when one side is done enough, you turn the other. For tame Fowls, they have of all the Kinds that we have in <HI>England;</HI> besides <HI>Guinea</HI> Hens, <HI>Parrots, Parachites, Machaws,</HI> and <HI>Boobies,</HI> (which are <HI>Boobies</HI> indeed, for they will sit upon a Tree, or Post, till you come and take 'em.) They have three Crops a Year, in this Island, and the Trees are always green. They
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
have three sorts of Bread, one of <HI>English</HI> Corn, another of <HI>Guinea</HI> Wheat, and the third of a Root they call Casavi, which is rank Poison, till press'd and bak'd in an Oven; 'tis very white, but tasteless, and the Bread made of it, the Size of our thin Oat-Cakes. But of all the Fruit this Island produces, the Pine-Apple is the best, which grows very low, with Leaves something like the <HI>Indicus Ficus</HI> that I have seen in Gardens here in <HI>England;</HI> the Taste is so excellent, that I know not what to com∣pare it to, it having the Relish of all fine∣flavour'd Fruits. There's a Fruit that grows upon a low Bush, call'd the Prickle-Pear, the inside of which is red, and on the top is a little thorny Thing like a Star, which if you do not take away, before you eat it, may prove pernicious. If you eat but two of this Fruit, it will make your Urine as red as Blood. <HI>Plantins</HI> are a very good Fruit, which is, when bak'd in the Ashes, us'd by the Slaves instead of Bread: 'Tis a Fruit with a Skin on it, like our Beans, which is taken off, and then the Fruit ap∣pears, about the size of a <HI>Bolognia</HI> Sausage. <HI>Bannanas</HI> is another Fruit something of the same Kind, but shorter, and more luscious: Both these Fruits are ripe all the Year, for when some are fit to gather, others are green, and some in Bud. The Oranges
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
and Lemons, are neither of 'em good, in my Opinion: but their Limes are wonder∣ful, they grow upon a Tree full of Thorns, where you must be sure to prick your Fingers, if you'll gather 'em. These, with Spring-Water and Sugar, was the chief of my Liquor, while we staid there. The Potatoes are very fine here, exceeding, in my Opinion, even those of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Then there's another Root call'd Jams, some∣thing like a <HI>Jerusalem</HI>-Artichoak, but larger and stringy. The Onions of <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> are much milder, and better tasted than our <HI>English</HI> Onions, and very whol∣some: They us'd to make a great Addi∣tion to our Crogick Brewis; that is, Bisket soak'd in fair Water, for some Time, then the Water thrown away, and the Bisket strew'd over with Salt, Oil, and Lime-Juice, together with Onions; and so eaten as a dainty Dish. There is a sensitive Plant in this Island; the Stalk, surrounded with Leaves full of dark red Spots, bears a sweet-smelling violet-colour'd Flower; the Leaves, as soon as touch'd, close up toge∣ther, and die; and accordingly as they are held in the Hand a shorter or a longer Time, this Alteration continues. Ginger grows plentiful here; the Male Plant (for there's Sexes) hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female: The Stalks, which are
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
without Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards, and spreads along the Earth, still taking Root anew. When the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is com∣monly ripe, but it has not that Poinancy whilst green, as when dry'd. The Cotton of this Place (of which the Cloaths and Hammocks are made, are vended in most Parts of the <HI>Westeru</HI> World) grows on a Tree about the Heighth of a Peach-Tree, with a strait Stem, or Body, out of which shoot Boughs of an equal Length, and at equal Distance: Between the Leaves, which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and from 'em, oval Cods, which, when ripe, inclose the Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper. Of hurtful Creatures, there is the Crocodile, or <HI>Alligator,</HI> which infest many Rivers and Ponds; this is a Creature of a monstrous Size; I have seen one twenty six Foot long; it moves swiftly and strongly forward, but turns slow; they are impe∣netrable every where but in the Eye, or Belly; they have four Feet, or Fins, with which they go, or swim; their usual Course of getting their Food is to lie on their Backs as dead, then with a sudden Onset they spring upon their Prey, whether Man or Beast: But 'tis easily avoided by a Man, by reason of an Aromatick Smell that comes from the Body, which may be smelt
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
five Hundred Yards; but if a Man has got a Cold, and can't smell, if he has Eyes they are easily avoided; for if they run right forward, it is but slipping on one side, for they are as long in turning as a Coach. The Oil that's made from these Creatures, is good for several Distempers. They lay their Eggs (about the size of a Turkey's) and cover 'em with Sand, which heated by the Beams of the Sun, hatches the young ones, who naturally creep into the Water. One of these Creatures swam after us fifty Yards in <HI>Porto Morant</HI> Bay, and rais'd his Head upon the Edge of our Long-Boat, which was deeply laden with Casks of Water; our Carpenter, who had been fel∣ling of Timber to Wood the Ship, struck him a very great Blow on the Nose with his Hatchet, that I am sure hurt him, for he gave a sort of Shriek, which no Body ever heard before, and swam to shore; where I observ'd him to run his Head into the Mud, as if it pain'd him, which makes me think that their Heads are not invulne∣rable, as is reported. The <HI>Guana</HI> is ano∣ther Creature amphibious as the <HI>Alligator,</HI> but nothing nigh so large: There's an Island near <HI>Jamaica,</HI> call'd <HI>Guana</HI> Island, inhabited by nothing else; our Seamen eat of these latter, but much Good may it do 'em, for the Flesh looks like a piece of a 
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
<HI>Black-a-more</HI>'s Arm; but how it tastes I can't tell, neither do I ever design to try. The <HI>Cocoa</HI> Nut is a Fruit that is both Meat, Drink, and Cloathing to the Natives, (I mean the Blacks) the Rind serves for wea∣ving of Cloaths, nay, and rigging their Canoes, before they knew the <HI>Europeans;</HI> and when you have taken off the Bark, you must be beholding to a Saw to cut off the Monkey's Face, which is the top, with three Marks that makes it something resemble that Animal; then the Inside con∣tains, first a liquid Substance, like Whey, but very sweet; after you have taken out this Liquor, round the Nut is a Substance a quarter of an Inch thick, which you cut out, and that's the Meat, which is very delicious and grateful to the Taste, but not wholsome, if eat of too much: There's another Thing that's very remarkable, and that is the <HI>Phisick-Nut,</HI> much of the Taste of our Pig-nuts, but one or two of 'em will do your Business, upwards or down∣wards, as well as Dr. <HI>Annodyne-Necklace</HI>'s Sugar-Plumbs. As I was going one Day to dine with Captain <HI>Kendal,</HI> (a Gentle∣man Inhabitant within a Mile of the Bay in <HI>Porto Morant)</HI> attended by a Black, a Servant of his, I saw in the Hedge a fair Apple growing on a Bush, which I readi∣ly gather'd, and was conveying to my
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
Mouth, but prevented by the Black's giving me a Blow on the Hand, which struck it from me; I immediately, with my Sword in the Scabbard, fell to belabour the poor Fellow for his Insolence, for I having been familiar with him, and talk'd to him along the Road, thought he made our old <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Proverb true, <HI>If you give an Inch they'll take an Ell;</HI> but it seems the Fellow sav'd my Life by it, for this Fruit, which was call'd a <HI>Mangineel Apple,</HI> was rank Poy∣son, but what I had never seen or heard of before; I was so concern'd for the Blows I had given the poor Fellow, that I gave him a Dollar to make him amends. I remember I was afterwards washing my self at a River, in the same Bay, and it raining very hard, I went under a Tree, to save my Cloaths from being wet, and in placing them together in a Cavity of the Shore, the Drops of Rain fell on a <HI>Man∣gineel</HI> Tree, and so on my Back, but in less than half an Hour my Flesh burn'd very hot, and white Blisters appear'd upon my Skin, insomuch that I was in a high Fever; but a Native of the Place being with me, ran for salt Water, and wash'd me all over, and afterwards got some Oil and dip'd my Shirt in it, and put it on my Back, which gave me Ease immediately; but the Spots remain'd upon my Skin several Years after∣wards.
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
I don't doubt but my Readers will laugh at me for thus running from one Thing to another, but I relate 'em just as my Memory prompts me. This Island was first discover'd by <HI>Columbus, Anno Dom.</HI> 1499. After he had conquer'd the Natives, and built a City, call'd <HI>Sevilla,</HI> (afterwards <HI>St. Jago de la Vega)</HI> consisting of about seventeen Hundred Houses, two Churches, two Chapels, and an Abbey, he made his Son <HI>Diego Columbus</HI> Governor of the whole Island, for his Master <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The first Attempt made upon this Island by the <HI>English,</HI> was <HI>A. D.</HI> 1592, under the Command of Mr. <HI>Antony Shir∣ley,</HI> but after vanquishing the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they deserted it, as not thinking it worth their keeping, and return'd home. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> again possessing it, remain'd un∣molested, till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1654, when <HI>O∣liver Cromwel,</HI> then Lord Protector, rigg'd out a Fleet of Ships to make a Descent on <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> under the Command of Colonel <HI>Venables;</HI> but being disappointed of their Hopes, and meeting with ill Suc∣cess, steer'd away for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and on the 10th of <HI>May</HI> (after a stout Resistance) made themselves Masters of it. The Island is suppos'd to contain two hundred and fifty thousand Inhabitants, Slaves included. The chief Towns are, 1st, <HI>St. Jago,</HI> about

six Miles up the Country. 2<HI>dly, Passage-Town,</HI> six Miles from that. 3<HI>dly,</HI> (And in∣deed the largest, before the Earthquake de∣stroy'd it) <HI>Port Royal,</HI> it contained a thou∣sand Houses, many of them eminent Build∣ings; but as it is now built on a small Neck of Land, which forms the Harbour, I take it to be about the bigness of <HI>Dept∣ford.</HI> At both Ends of the Town is a large Fort, known by the Name of the square and round Fort: the square Fort, or Castle, contains a hundred Pieces of Ordnance, and the other about thirty, besides several Canon on the Platform, which reaches from one Fort to the other; so that, with∣out Treachery, they need not fear an At∣tack either by Land or Sea. About a Mile farther, is another small Fort, call'd <HI>Land∣ward</HI> Fort, which secures the Town from any Attempt by Land: Off the Mouth of the Harbour, towards the Sea, lie several small Islands, upon the most <HI>Western</HI> of which (lying within half a League of the Town, and by which all the Vessels must pass) they have erected a Fort which con∣tains eight Guns. The chief Harbour, af∣ter <HI>Port Royal,</HI> is <HI>Port St. Antony,</HI> on the <HI>North;</HI> a very safe, commodious, land∣lock'd Harbour, only the coming in is some∣thing difficult, the Channel being narrow'd by a little Island that lies off the Mouth of
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
the Port. 2<HI>d, Portomorant,</HI> a very capa∣cious Harbour, where Ships do convenient∣ly Wood and Water, and ride safe from all Winds. 3<HI>d,</HI> On the <HI>South</HI> is <HI>Port Gag∣way,</HI> which is much the largest of all that has been mention'd, it being five Leagues over, in some Places; it is land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs <HI>S. W.</HI> from the main of the Island: The Road is so deep that a Ship of a thousand Tun may lay her Side to the Shore of the Point, and lade or unlade at Pleasure, with Planks a∣float.</P>
<P>Now finding our Affairs wou'd detain us half a Year longer, I got Leave of the Captain to go in a Sloop, with some of my Acquaintance, to get Logwood, and on <HI>September</HI> the 25th we set sail for the Bay of <HI>Campeche,</HI> with a fair Wind. The old Manner of getting this Wood is as fol∣lows; a Company of desperate Fellows get together in a Sloop, well arm'd, and Land by stealth, but in Case of any Resistance, the whole Crew attends on the Cutters, ready arm'd to defend 'em; (indeed there's a Colony of <HI>English</HI> that sells this Log∣wood, but many chuse the other Way; all this was strange to me, for I knew nothing of the matter, till we were out to Sea. There was one Fellow there that told me, that about ten Years before he went with a
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
Vessel, and they took the same Method as usual, in getting it, and landed all their Men but six, that they left on Board to look after the Vessel; in the mean time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Intelligence of their Descent, sent a hundred Men, in several Canoes, to seize their Vessel; which ac∣cordingly they did, without any Resistance from the six Men on Board: After they had clap'd these Men under Hatches, they search'd and ransack'd the Vessel, sending every thing on shore that was of any Va∣lue; then they prepar'd to trepan the Crew, as they came on board, which happen'd the very next Night, when some of the Men coming on board with a Load of Log∣wood, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> caus'd the six Men to stand upon Deck, and on Pain of Death, not to discover the Truth of the Matter, which happen'd as they desir'd, for the Men coming on Board carelesly without their Arms, were all seiz'd immediately, and clapp'd in Irons. The rest that were on shore wondering at the stay of the Boat, sent a Canoe with six Men, to know the Reason of their Delay, which were like∣wise taken in the same Trap with the for∣mer. The Man that told me this Story, was one of these last six, who found means secretly in the middle of the Night to slip into the Water, and swam ashore, tho' a
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
League off, where he happily inform'd the rest of the Crew (which were forty three) of the Misfortune that had happen'd to their Companions: Whereupon they con∣sulted what they had best do; where it was unanimously agreed, to seize upon three large Canoes, that lay at the bottom of the Bay, that belong'd to some <HI>French</HI> Hunters that were on shore; which was done accordingly: On Board they imme∣diately got, well arm'd, and steer'd away for their Sloop: But as they design'd to trick them the same way as the others had done their Companions, they con∣sulted what to do if they should be disco∣ver'd before they could get on Board, which was probable enough. At length it was agreed to carry on the Plot in order to de∣ceive them, and as soon as ever they could get over the Ship's side to assault the Ene∣my with all the Vigour imaginable, ap∣pointing two or three to release their Com∣panions, and put Arms into their Hands, to be assistant in recovering their Liberties. Every thing happen'd as was suggested, for when they came within half a Fur∣long of the Vessel, they were hail'd by some of their own Men, as it is usual in such Cases; which was answer'd by them in the Canoes, with swearing and cursing at 'em, for not coming ashore with their Long∣boat,
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
as order'd, but to force 'em to bring their Wood aboard in Canoes. They ask'd from on Board, how many were come with 'em? All (answer'd they in the Boat) but three, that we left ashore to look af∣ter our Arms, and a small Remainder of Log-wood, which you must go and fetch immediately with the Long-boat, (which they pretended cou'd not go to 'em before, by reason she had a Hole broke in her Bow, against a piece of Rock, that gave 'em a great deal of Trouble in getting her to the Vessel.) Our People smil'd to them∣selves to hear they had got their Lesson so ready. In asking and answering these Questions, they had reach'd the Vessel, and getting nimbly up the Side, they drew from under their Watch-Coats, their Pistols and Cutlashes, and first fir'd upon the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> who were running to seize 'em, half unarm'd, as not suspecting any Resistance: Those whose Office it was to release the Prisoners under Hatches, did it immediate∣ly, by killing the two Centuries that watch'd over 'em; and then coming up with this fresh Recruit soon overcame the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and made 'em call for Quarter: Which was not granted till they had thrown down their Arms. When they had surrender'd, they chain'd 'em all under Hatches; and so the Conquerors became Prisoners, and the
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
Prisoners Conquerors. After the Action was over, they look'd after the Dead, which was found to be nine <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and one <HI>Englishman,</HI> who was suppos'd to be kill'd by our own Men, in the first Fire.</P>
<P>Upon this good Success, they having no∣tice that there lay a rich Ship in the Har∣bour before the Town of <HI>Campeche,</HI> they resolv'd to try their good Fortune farther, which they contriv'd as follows: they hoisted <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours, and sail'd away immedi∣ately for the Port of <HI>Campeche,</HI> where they arriv'd by next Morning, saluted the Castle and Town with seven Guns, as Friends, and were paid back the Complement. The Shore was fill'd with Numbers of People, to see the <HI>Englishmen</HI> brought ashore Pri∣soners; but they were mistaken. The Ship which they had a Design upon lay about a League from the Town, as having ar∣riv'd but two Days before, but was to put farther in that very Evening, before the Sea Breeze fail'd; our Men boarded her on the Starboard-side, which lay from the Town, and took her, without firing a Gun; cut her Cables, and made out to Sea, before the Town knew what was the matter: But as soon as ever they smelt the Trick, a <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War of thirty Guns (being all that was in the Harbour) slip'd her Cables, and crouded all the Sail
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
she cou'd, to come up with us; we finding she gain'd upon us, call'd a Council, and at last resolv'd to bring up most of our <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners bound, and expose 'em to the whole Fire of the Enemy. Which succeeded accordingly, for the Ship coming close up to us, (without any firing on ei∣ther side) commanded us to strike. Upon that we order'd the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain to lay before 'em their Condition; which profited little at first, but after many In∣treaties from them, and Threatnings from us, the others were prevail'd upon to sheer off, and make towards the Town, while we made the best of our Way. But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> making up to the Town again, was met by several armed Boats, with the Governor himself in one of them, who gave a strict Command not to regard any Thing, but use all possible Means to re∣take the Ship, and the Pyrates (as they term'd us.) When we perceiv'd the Boats making up to the Ship, and observ'd her tack about to give us Chase, we guess'd at the Matter, and finding she gain'd upon us, we put our selves into a Posture of De∣fence, and propos'd to engage her in the Prize we took last, which carry'd twenty Guns: We muster'd our Men, and found we had seventy one; but then we had two hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners, who, we
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
fear'd, if by any Accident they shou'd get loose, might prove our Ruin; whereupon a Consult was immediately held to put most of them to Death. Upon which the Captain of the first Prize stood up, and said, (in pretty good <HI>English)</HI> Gentle∣men, you have taken us fairly, and done no more than we our selves did to you; now seeing that Ship which pursues us, and gains upon us every Moment, is coming in order to fight you, we shall run a more certain Danger by it, by being your Priso∣ners, if you expose us to the Fire of their Canon, as you did before; and if they do really fire, I may as well take them for an Enemy, as you, since we are sure to receive the most Damage. But to make the Matter short, being the Time is so, I propose to you, that if the Vessel fires at you, we may reasonably conclude, they have no manner of Regard for us, so we shall not have any for them, and, if you'll give us that Liberty, we will freely fight under your Command, and endeavour, as far as in us lies, to defend your Vessel, as much as if it was our own. This Speech of the Captain's was approv'd of by the rest of the Prisoners; so that at last we a∣greed to set sixty of them at Liberty, and the rest fast bound under Hatches, where we put two Centuries, with two Patareroes
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
fix'd, charg'd with small Shot, with Orders, that if there seem'd to be any thing like Disturbance, to fire in upon 'em. The sixty we chose out to be assistant to us, were order'd to the Great Guns, so that we still had the Command over 'em, be∣cause they had no Arms. After we had settled every thing, we lay by, (seeing it impossible to escape without fighting) in order for their coming up to us, which they did in a short time, and coming within Hail, they order'd us to strike immediately, and make no Resistance, or else they wou'd have no Regard to their Friends on Board us, but sink or take us, and put every Man of us to Death. Upon which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain that was our Prisoner, made Answer. That if they offer'd to fire a Gun, every <HI>Spaniard</HI> on Board us resolv'd to fight against 'em as Enemies. Which was answer'd, They must obey the Gover∣nor's Orders, who had just left 'em, and was return'd on shore. Upon this they fir'd a Broadside upon us, but we re∣turn'd it immediately with our small Arms, and great Guns, which were well ply'd by our <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners. The Fight conti∣nu'd half an Hour with all the Fierceness imaginable; at last the <HI>Spaniard</HI> prepar'd to board us with his Boats at the same Time, but were receiv'd so briskly, and so da∣mag'd
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
by our Hand-Granado's, that they were oblig'd to make to the Ship with great Loss. The Hand-Granado's stood us in great stead, for we dispatch'd three or four of our Men into the Main-Top, who from thence discharg'd several Granado's, that by their own Report kill'd and wound∣ed above thirty Men. They attempted to board us once again, and came on briskly with firing and loud Shouts, to terrify us; but we return'd 'em their Shouts and firing with Interest, for with a lucky Shot we drove away their Main-Mast, which put 'em into strange Confusion: This Accident (if we would have laid hold on't) might have given us an Opportunity of out-sailing 'em; but that was not once thought of, for Desire of Revenge made us fight like Furies. The next Broad-side we gave 'em, struck away their Rudder, which render'd 'em incapable of steering their Vessel, or tacking about: Upon which we perceiving what had happen'd, tack'd about, and with a Broad-side that rack'd her fore and aft, kill'd 'em, by their own Confession, six∣teen Men, for it split two of their Guns, whose Splinters did most of the Execution. Now what we call to <HI>rake fore and aft,</HI> is to lay the Side of our Ship against the Enemy's Head or Stern, and fire into 'em, so that every Shot goes from one End of
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
the Ship to the other, instead of going a∣cross, so that of Consequence one Shot that way will do more Damage than ten directly side to side. The Heat of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> now began to abate, but yet he hector'd as much as ever; at last a lucky Shot enter'd her Powder-Room, and blew up her main Deck, with several <HI>Spaniards,</HI> into the Air; upon which was heard such Groans and Yelling, from wounded and dying Men, that were enough to frighten Men less inur'd to such Encounters: With this Success we prepar'd, in the Confusion, to board them in our turn, but was pre∣vented, by seeing their Vessel sinking; whereupon they struck down their Colours, and ask'd for Quarter, and Help; which we immediately gave 'em, by putting out our Boats, which together with their own, sav'd all the Men they had left, which were ninety five, out of four hundred and odd.</P>
<P>This Success flush'd us mightily with Hopes of succeeding in any Enterprize. We lost out of our <HI>Spaniards</HI> twenty six, and of <HI>English</HI> nine kill'd, and two wounded, who dy'd the next Day. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were of signal Service to us, and fought bravely, even to Desparation; well know∣ing, if they shou'd be taken (after fighting
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
on our side) they must all inevitably suffer Death: Which prov'd happy for us; for it had been impossible for us to have escap'd 'em, even if all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on Board us had stood neuter.</P>
<P>After we had clear'd our Vessel of the Blood and dead Men, and refresh'd our selves, we call'd up our <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners, that they might refresh themselves likewise, and return'd the others (who had fought so bravely in our Defence) our hearty Thanks; and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain express'd himself so handsomly, that our Master freely offer'd him our Sloop, victual'd and ready fitted up, to do what he thought fit with. Upon this kind Offer the Captain smil'd, and told him he would not take it without buying: And as for Money, I have none, (pursued he) but if you'll listen to a Stra∣tagem of mine, I'll engage to furnish you with Money for your Vessel, and some∣thing over and above. With that he pro∣pos'd to take six of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that had fought for us, and in our Long-Boat to go on shore to the Governor, and demand a Ransom for the Prisoners we had taken; which was agreed to: accordingly they went ashore, and told the Governor, if he did not immediately send fifty Dollars a Man, for two hundred and twenty, they wou'd be eve∣ry
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
Soul ty'd Back to Back, and thrown in∣to the Sea. Upon which there was a Ga∣thering made through the Town, and the Money rais'd immediately, and in twelve Hours the Captain return'd with 11000 Dollars, gave our Captain 5000, distributed 3000 among the Sailors, and kept the rest for himself. The next Day we set the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were sav'd from the Man of War on shore, and as many more that were willing, out of the other Ship, and of our own Sloop; so that Captain <HI>Fer∣nando,</HI> our friendly <HI>Spaniard,</HI> took his leave of us, with eighty of his Countrymen with Intention for the <HI>South</HI> Sea; and we steer'd our Course, in our rich Prize, for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we shar'd it: Every common Sailor had to his Share 800<HI>l.</HI> Moreover the Cap∣tain order'd me in particular, 200<HI>l.</HI> more, for the Service I did in swimming ashore unperceiv'd, to give 'em Notice.</P>
<P>After ending his Story, I ask'd him how he had improv'd his Money from that Time? Psha! (says he) that, and five times as much, is gone since then. And this is no won∣der, for Sailors are such Fools, that what they get with the utmost Danger, they spend as the meanest Trifles. We sail'd before the Wind six Days together, towards the Bay, but on the seventh, the Clouds
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
darken'd, and the Welkin seem'd all on fire, by Times, with Lightning, and the Thunder roar'd louder than ever I heard it in my Life; in short, a dreadful Hurri∣cane approach'd, which was suspected by a deceitful Calm, and Showers of Rain. Which the inimitable <HI>Shakespear</HI> very just∣ly describes.</P>
<Q><L>We often see against some Storm,</L>
<L>A Silence in the Heav'ns, the Rack stand still;</L>
<L>The bold Winds speechless, and the Orb below</L>
<L>As hush as Death.</L></Q>
<P>The Sailors had furl'd their Sails, and lowr'd their Topmasts, (waiting for it un∣der a double riv'd Fore-sail:) Which at last came with most extreme Violence.</P>
<Q><L>Either Tropick now</L>
<L>Gan Thunder: at both Ends of Heav'n the Clouds</L>
<L>From many a horrid Rift abortive pour'd</L>
<L>Fierce Rain, with Lightning mix'd, Wa∣ter with Fire,</L>

In vain the Master issues out Commands,</L>
<L>In vain the trembling Sailors ply their Hands,</L>
<L>The giddy Ship, between the Winds and Tides,</L>

<L>The Face of Things a frightful Image bears,</L>

<BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The Storm lasted with all its Violence three Hours, and at last insensibly abated, till it was stark calm, and not one Breath of Wind was stirring, nor any sign of one, but a little Froth on the Surface.</P>
<Q><L>The Tempest is o'erblown, the Skies are clear,</L>
<L>And the Sea charm'd into a Calm so still,</L>
<L>That not a Wrinkle ruffles her smooth Face.</L>
<BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q>
<P>After the Storm was over, we loos'd our Sails, in Expectation of the Wind, which in half an Hour stole out again, as frighten'd at the violent Storm, or (if you'll grant me to make a Simile) like a poor Debtor
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
that steals out of his lurking-place, when the blustering Bailiffs are gone out of sight. About six in the Evening, we saw a Water-Spout: This is an Aerial Engine, or Lim∣beck, that draws up the salt Water of the Sea, and distils it into fresh Showers of Rain: This Cloud comes down in Form of a Pipe of Lead of a vast Thickness, and by the Force of the Sun sucks up a great Quantity of Water. I stood an Hour to observe it; after it had continu'd about half an Hour in the Water, it drew up in∣sensibly, by Degrees, till it was lost in the Clouds; but in the closing of the same, it shut out some of the Water, which fell into the Sea again, with a Noise like that of Thunder, and occasion'd a Smoke in the Water, that lasted for a considerable Time. The Sailors told me, that these Water-Spouts sometimes did great Damage to Ships that by Calms were too near 'em when they fell. One Fellow told me, that he saw a Bark of sixty Tun suck'd out of the Water by one of 'em, which caus'd the breaking of the Spout, and sunk the Vessel with the Fall of the Waters. In the <HI>Streights,</HI> when Ships approach these airy Engines, they fire off a Gun, and that breaks 'em before they come too near. The Person told me, that at the Fall of Water, the Sea was curl'd as
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
much as if you had thrown a large Stone into a standing Pond of Water. We have sometimes at a Distance seen fourteen or fifteen at a Time at Work, but I never saw one so large as this.</P>
<P>In the Evening we caught a small Shark, with two sucking Fishes that stuck close to her till laid on the Deck, and then drop'd down of their own Accord. This is al∣low'd the <HI>Remora</HI> of the Ancients: It is about the Bigness of a Mackrel, with a flat Head, and is of a gristly Substance. These stick to the sides of Vessels very fre∣quently, and sometimes swim upon the Surface of the Water, and are even caught with a naked Hook. I have sometimes seen these Fishes sticking to a Log of Wood, in the Water. When we hog'd our Ship, (a Hog is an Instrument of six Foot square, something like a Harrow, and Stumps of old Brooms fix'd close in the middle part) this is put to the bottom of the Ship, with a Rope before and another aft, fix'd to the Capstorn, which cleans the Vessel from all sorts of Filth. I have seen many of 'em in the Hog together, with Barnicles and Oysters, and several other Shell-fish.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> the 6th, we anchor'd at <HI>Trist Island,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and sent
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
our Men ashore at <HI>Logwood Creek,</HI> to seek for the Logwood-Cutters, who immediate∣ly came on Board. The Bargain was soon struck, and in Exchange for our Rum and Sugar, and a little Money, we got in our Lading in eight Days, and set sail for <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> the 15th Day of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Now in getting up to <HI>Jamaica</HI> again, generally takes us up two Months, because we are oblig'd to ply it all the way to Windward. One Day it being stark calm, I went into the Water to wash my self, though I was dissuaded by all the Sailors, by reason of that Coast being infested with Sharks, which sometimes meet with Peo∣ple, and bite off a Limb: But being there had not been any seen that Day, I wou'd venture, but ty'd a Rope about me, for fear of any Accident that might happen, or the Wind striking up of a sudden. But I had not been long in the Water, before they cry'd from the Gunnel, A Shark! a Shark! but I thinking they had only ban∣ter'd, as sometimes they do, when any one is in the Water, did not mind 'em, till at last they pull'd me by main Force, up the side of the Ship; when looking into the Water, I saw a swinging large Shark, with his white Belly turn'd up in order to bite at me. Upon which I thank'd God and
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
good Friends that had prevented him, by swiftly pulling me up; though the Rope had rubb'd off the Skin, and some part of my Flesh, with the Force. Now a Shark cannot get his Prey, without first turning himself upon his Back, because their upper Jaw is much larger than their under: Which often prevents Accidents.</P>
<P>I one Day went down into the Hold, to bottle off a small Parcel of Wine that I had there, for fear 'twou'd sowre, which made me in a filthy Pickle: Coming upon Deck again, I wanted to clean my self, but did not care to go into the Water, as be∣fore, so went into the Boat astern, that we hoisted overboard in the Morning, to look after a Wreck that we discover'd up∣on the Water: Being in the Boat, I began to wash my self, and when I had dress'd my self again, I pull'd a Book out of my Pocket, and sate reading in the Boat; when, before I was aware, a Storm began to rise, so that I cou'd not get up the Ship-side, as usual, but call'd for the Ladder of Ropes, that hangs over the Ship's Quarter, in order to get up that way; but whether it was not fasten'd above, or whether it broke through Rottenness, as being seldom us'd, I can't tell, but down I fell into the Sea; and though the Ship (as they told me after∣wards)
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
tack'd about to take me up, if it was possible; yet I lost sight of 'em, thro' the Duskiness of the Evening, and the Storm together. Now I had the most dis∣mal Fears that cou'd ever possess any one in my Condition: I was forc'd to drive with the Wind, which sate (by good For∣tune) with the Current, and having kept my self above Water, as near as I could guess in this Fright, four Hours, I felt my Feet every now and then touch Ground; and at last, by a great Wave▪ was thrown and left upon the Sand; yet it being dark, I knew not what to do; but I got up and walk'd, as well as my tir'd Limbs wou'd let me; and every now and then was over∣taken by the Waves, but not high enough to wash me away.</P>
<P>When I had got far enough, as I thought, to be out of Danger, I cou'd not discover any thing of Land, and I immediately con∣jectur'd that it was but some Bank of Sand, that the Sea wou'd overflow at high Tide: Whereupon I sate down to rest my weary Limbs, and fit my self for Death, for that was all I cou'd expect, in my own Opinion. Then all my Sins came flying in my Face, which I repented of with all the Sincerity imaginable: I offer'd up my fervent Prayers to our Almighty Creator, not for my Safe∣ty
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
(because I did not expect any such Thing) but for all my past Offences; and I may really say, I expected my Dissolution with a Calmness that made me think I had made my Peace with Heaven. At last I fell asleep, (tho' I try'd all I could against it, by rising up and walking, till I was oblig'd to lie down again.) In the Morning when I a∣wak'd, I was amaz'd to find my self among four or five very low sandy Islands, but all separated half a Mile or more (as I guess'd) by the Sea. With that I began to be a lit∣tle chearful, and walk'd about to see if I could find any thing that was eatable, but to my great Grief I found nothing but a few Eggs, that I was oblig'd to eat raw; this laid my Condition before my Eyes in a most horrid Manner, and the Fear of starv∣ing seem'd to me to be worse than that of drowning; and oft did I wish that the Sea had swallow'd me, rather than thrown me on this desolate Island; for I cou'd per∣ceive by the Evenness of 'em, that they were not inhabited either by Man, or Beast, or any Thing else, but Rats, and several sorts of Fowl.</P>
<P>Upon this Island there was some few Bushes of a Wood they call'd <HI>Burton</HI> Wood, which us'd to be my Shelter at Night; but to compleat my Misery, there was not to be
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
found one drop of fresh Water on the Island; so that I was forc'd to drink my own Urine for two or three Days together; which made my Skin come off like the Peal of a boil'd Codlin. At last my Misery so encreas'd, that I was often in the Mind to put an end to my wretched Life, but desisted, on the Opinion that I had of some Alligator, or other voracious Creature, coming to do it for me. Strange Circumstances indeed! to wish to be devour'd alive, as a Mitigation of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>I had liv'd a Week here upon Eggs only, when, by good Fortune, upon a Bush I dis∣cover'd a Booby sitting; I ran immediately, as fast as I cou'd, and with a Stick knock'd him down: I never consider'd whether it was proper to eat or no, but I suck'd the Blood, and eat the Flesh, with such a Plea∣sure as none can express, but them that have felt the Pain of Hunger to the same Degree as my self. After I had devour'd this Banquet, I walk'd about, and discover'd many more of these Birds, which I slew.</P>
<P>Now my Stomach being pretty well appeas'd, I began to consider whether I could not, with two Sticks, make a Fire, as I had seen Blacks in <HI>Jamaica:</HI> I try'd with all the Wood I could get, and at last happily did it. This done, I gather'd some
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
Sticks, and made a Fire, pick'd several of my Boobies, and broil'd 'em, as well as I cou'd; and now I resolv'd to come to an Allowance. This Bird is a Water Fowl, a∣bout the bigness of a large Crow; of grey Colour; it has a long strong Bill, and Feet like a Duck, and its Flesh seem'd to me to taste something like a Duck's, but stronger, and a little Fishy: And it is such a Booby, that it will not get out of your Way with∣out beating.</P>
<P>At Night I and the rest of my Fellow-Inhabitants, had a great Storm of Rain and Thunder, with the redest Lightning I had ever seen, which well wash'd us all, I be∣lieve; as for my self, my Cloaths (which were only a pair of thin Shoes and Thread Stockings, and a Cotton Wastcoat and Breeches) were soundly wet; but I had this Happiness, to find in the Morning several Cavities of Rain-Water, which put in my Head a Thought of making a deep Well, or hollow Place, that I might have Water continually by me; which I brought to Per∣fection in this Manner: I took a Piece of Wood I found on the Island, and pitch'd upon a Place under a Burton-Tree, where with my Hands and the Stick together, I dug a Hole, or Well, big enough to con∣tain a Hogshead of Water, then put in
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
Stones and pa v'd it, and got in and stamp'd 'em down ha rd all round, and with my Stick beat th e sides close, so that I made it capable of holding Water for a long Time.</P>
<P>But now the Difficulty was, how to get the Water there, which at last I con∣triv'd very well, for with my Shirt (which was pretty fine) I effected it, by soaking it in Water for some Time, and then afterwards it wou'd bear it very well; so with this Holland-Bucket I cou'd carry two Gallons of Water at a Time, which wou'd not leak out above a Pint, in two hundred Yards; so in two Days Time I had fill'd my Well.</P>
<P>Now I began to think of Life again for a while, for I had ready broil'd forty of these Boobies, designing to allow my self half a one a Day. I also made my self a Cu pboard of Earth, by mixing Water with it, which was four Foot in Length, three in Heighth, and two in Breadth, though it lasted but four Days, the Sun drying it so fast, that it crack'd, and afterwards fell in pieces. What most amaz'd me, and pleas'd me together, was, that my Boobies continu'd sweet without the least Taint. I had a small <HI>Ovid</HI> printed
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
by <HI>Elziver,</HI> which I had by good Fortune put in my Breeches Pocket, when I was going up the Ladder of Ropes, and by be∣ing press'd close in my Pocket, was not quite spoil'd, but only the Cover off, and stain'd a little with the Wet. This was a great Mitigation of my Misfortunes, for I could entertain my self in this Book, un∣der a Burton-Bush, till I fell asleep. I re∣main'd always in good Health, only a lit∣tle troubled with the Head-Ach, for want of a Hat, which I lost in the Water, in falling down from the Ladder of Ropes. But I remedy'd this as well a I could, by ga∣thering a Parcel of Chicken-Weed (which grows there in Plenty) and strewing it over the Burton-Bushes, under which I sate. Nay, at last, finding my Time might be longer there than I expected, I tore off one of the Sleeves of my Shirt, and lin'd a wooden Cap, that I had made of green sprigs, and twisted with the green Bark that I peel'd off, so that if I had been seen in this Figure, I shou'd have appear'd like a Mad∣man with the Basket of a Cudgel upon his Head.</P>
<P>One Day coming from washing my self, (which I us'd often to do to cool me) I heard a flouncing in the Water, and turn∣ing my Head, to see from whence the Noise
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
came, I saw the oddest Fish, I believe▪ that ever was known. It had (as I sup∣pose) chas'd some other Fish very eagerly, and run it self too far on the Sand, and the Tide being almost at the lowest, it had left it there. It was (as near as I cou'd guess) about fifteen Foot long; it had a Head like a Horse, and out of the Mouth came two Horns curl'd like a Ram's Horn, only twice as large; it had but one Eye, and that was at the Extremity of the Nose; it seem'd, as it flounc'd, to be something of a changeable Ash-colour, with a Tail that taper'd to the End in a sharp Point: it look'd so terrible to me, that I was afraid to approach it; as it labour'd it seem'd to groan; it lay in this Hole of Water half an Hour, with its Body in, and its Tail out; and as soon as the Tide came up to it, it shak'd its Tail to and fro, as a Dog does when he seems pleas'd, all the while it felt the Water; it struggled but now and then, and at last, when the Water was pretty high, it turn'd its Head, and made a Noise something like the Clucking of a Hen with Chickens, but louder; and when it had Water enough to swim away, it lay moving up and down a quarter of an Hour, being as I suppose hurt with its struggling. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance advis'd me to leave this Description out; for, says
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
he, No Body will believe it. I reply'd, I did not care for that, as I was satisfied in my self it was true.</P>
<P>I had been here now a Month, by my Reckoning, and in that Time my Skin look'd as if it had been rubb'd over with Walnut-shells. I had a Mind several Times to have swam to one of the other Islands; but as they look'd only like Heaps of Sand, I thought I had got the best Birth, so con∣tented my self with my own Station. Boobies I could get enough, (who build on the Ground) and another Bird that lays the Eggs which I us'd to eat, but I never ven∣tur'd to taste of 'em, though as their Eggs were good, we may suppose their Flesh was so too: But however, I was so well satis∣fied with my Boobies, that I did not care to try Experiments.</P>
<P>This Island which I was upon, seem'd to me to be about two Miles in Circum∣ference, and was almost round, and on the <HI>West</HI> side there's a good Anchoring-place, for the Water is very deep, within two Fa∣thom of the Shore. God forgive me, but I often wish'd to have had Companions in my Misfortune, and hop'd every Day either to have seen some Vessel come that way, or a Wreck, where, perhaps, I might
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
have found some Necessaries which I want∣ed: But I wou'd often check my self in these Cogitations, as not becoming a Christi∣an; yet they wou'd as often awake in my Mind, in spight of all my Devotion and other good Thoughts; it being natural to desire Company. I us'd to fancy, that if I shou'd be forc'd to stay there long, I shou'd forget my Speech; so I us'd to talk aloud, ask my self Questions, and answer 'em; but if any Body had been by to have heard me, they wou'd certainly have thought me bewitch'd, I us'd to ask my self such odd Questions. All this while I cou'd not in∣form my self where I was, or how near any inhabited Place.</P>
<P>One Morning (which I took to be the 8th of <HI>November)</HI> a violent Storm arose, which continu'd till Noon, when in the mean time I observ'd a Bark labouring with the Waves for several Hours, and at last, with the Violence of the Tempest, was perfectly thrown out of the Water upon the shore, within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where I observ'd 'em. I ran to see if there was any Body I could be as∣sisting to, where I found four Men (being all that was in the Vessel) busy about saving what they could out of her: When I came up with 'em, and hail'd 'em in <HI>English,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
they seem'd mightily surpriz'd; they ask'd me how I came there, and how long I had been there? When I told 'em my Story, they were all mightily concern'd for them∣selves, as well as for me, for they found there was no Possibility of getting their Bark off the Sands, being the Wind had forc'd her so far: With that we began to bemoan one another's Misfortunes; but I must confess to you, without lying, I was never more rejoic'd in my whole Life; for they had on Board plenty of every thing for a Twelvemonth, and not any thing spoil'd. Their Lading (which was Logwood) they had thrown over board to lighten their Ship; which was the Occasion of the Wind forcing her so far: Had they kept in their Lading, they wou'd have bulg'd in the Sands half a quarter a Mile from the Place where they did, and the Sea flying over 'em, wou'd not only have spoil'd their Pro∣visions, but perhaps been the Death of 'em all. By these Men I understood where we were, <HI>viz.</HI> upon one of the Isles of <HI>Alcranes,</HI> which are five Islands, or rather large Banks of Sand; (for there is not a Tree, nor Bush, upon any but that where we were) they lie in the Latitude of twen∣ty two Degrees <HI>North,</HI> twenty five Leagues from <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and about sixty from <HI>Cam∣peachy</HI> Town. We work'd as fast as we
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
cou'd, and got out every Thing that wou'd be useful to us, before Night. We had six Barrels of salt Beef, three of Pork, two of Pease, and two of Flower, and eleven Barrels of Bisket; a small Copper, and an Iron Pot; several wearing Cloaths, and a spare Hat, which I wanted mightily: We had besides, several Cags of Rum, and one of Brandy, and a Chest of Sugar, with many other Things of Use: some Gun∣powder, and one Fowling-piece. We took off the Sails from the Yards, and with some pieces of Timber erected a Tent big enough to hold twenty Men, under which we put their Beds, that we got from the Bark. 'Tis true we had no Shelter from the Weather, for the Trees were so low that they were of no Use to us. I now thought my self in a Palace, and was as merry, as if I had been at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or even at home in my own Country: I cou'd joak now and then, and tell a mer∣ry Tale. In short, when we had been there some Time, we began to be very easy, and to wait contentedly, till Provi∣dence shou'd fetch us out of this Island. The Bark lay upon the Sands, fifty Yards from the Water when at the highest, so that I us'd to lie in her Cabin, by reason there was no more Beds ashore, than was for my four Companions, <HI>viz. Thomas</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
<HI>Randal,</HI> of <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> (whose Bed was largest, which he did me the Favour to spare a part of now and then, when the Wind was high, and I did not care to lie on Board) <HI>Richard White,</HI> of <HI>Port Royal, William Musgrave,</HI> of <HI>Kingston</HI> in <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Middleton,</HI> of—These Men, with eight others, set out of <HI>Port Royal</HI> about a Month after us, bound for the same Place: But those others lying ashore, and wandring too far up in the Country, were met, as 'tis suppos'd, by some <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who set up∣on 'em: Yet by all Appearance they fought desperately, for when Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> and Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> went to seek for 'em, they found all the eight dead, with fifteen <HI>Indians,</HI> and two <HI>Spaniards;</HI> all the <HI>Englishmen</HI> had several Cuts in their Heads, Arms, Breasts, &amp;c. that made it very plainly ap∣pear, they had sold their Lives dearly. They were too far up in the Country, to bring down their Dead; so they were oblig'd to dig a Hole in the Earth, and put 'em in, as they lay in their Cloaths. As for the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they strip'd 'em, and left 'em above Ground, as they found 'em, and made all the haste they could to imbark, for fear of any other unlucky Ac∣cident that might happen. They set sail
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
as soon as ever they came on board, and made the best of their way for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> till they were overtaken by the Storm that shipwreck'd 'em on <HI>Make Shift Island</HI> (as I had nam'd it.) When I told them of the strange Fish I had seen, there was not any of 'em, but Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> that had seen it, and he told me, when he was a Priso∣ner in <HI>Mexico,</HI> he had seen one there, and they call'd it the <HI>Ram Fish;</HI> but he told me I was mistaken concerning the Eyes, for they were on the top of the Head, but ve∣ry small, not bigger than a Musket-ball; and that which I took for an Eye, was a Hole that they sometimes spouted Water through. This that he saw at <HI>Mexico,</HI> was carried about for a Shew in a Cart, but it was but eight Foot and a half in Length, and was by Order of the Viceroy sent two Leagues into the Bay, to be bury'd, for it stunk so intolerably, they were afraid it wou'd breed a Plague.</P>
<P>Now we had all Manner of Fishing-Tackle with us, but we wanted a Boat to go a little way from Shore to catch Fish, therefore we set our Wits to work, in or∣der to make some manner of Engine, and at last we pitch'd upon this odd Project: We took six Casks, and tarr'd 'em all over,
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
then stop'd up the Bungs with Cork, and nail'd 'em close down with a piece of tarr'd Canvas, these six Casks we ty'd to∣gether with some of the Cords of the Ves∣sel, and upon them we plac'd the Skuttles of the Deck, and fix'd them, and made it so strong, that two Men might easily sit upon 'em, but for fear a Storm shou'd hap∣pen, we ty'd to one end of her a Coil or two of small Rope, of five hundred Fa∣thom long, which we fix'd to a Stake on the Shore: Then two of 'em went out, (as for my part, I was no Fisherman) in or∣der to see what Success they shou'd have, but return'd with only one <HI>Nurse,</HI> a Fish so called, about two Foot long, something like a Shark, only its Skin is very rough, and, when dry, will do the same Office as a Seal-skin. The same boil'd in Lemon∣juice, is the only Remedy in the World for the Scurvy, by applying some of the Skin to the Calfs of your Legs, and rubbing your Body with some of the Liquor, once or twice. We sent out our Fishermen the next Day again, and they return'd with two old <HI>Wives,</HI> and a young <HI>Shark,</HI> about two Foot long; which we dress'd for Dinner, and they prov'd excellent Eating. In the Morning following, we kill'd a young <HI>Seal,</HI> with our Fowling-Piece; but first she was
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
so kind to give me a Blow on the Fore∣head, that cut the Skin, and bled very much; which was done with her Fins, for as they run towards the Water, they throw backwards the Gravel, as Horses do when they gallop hard; this we salted, and it eat very well, after lying two or three Days in the Brine.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF Capt. <HI>Richard Falconer.</HI> BOOK II.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E past our Time in this <HI>Makeshift Island</HI> as well as we could; we invent∣ed several Games to di∣vert our selves: One Day, when we had been merry, Sorrow (as after Gaiety often
<PB N="2" REF="80"/>
happens) stole insensibly on us all. I, as being the youngest, began to reflect on my sad Condition, in spending my Youth on a Barren Land, without Hopes of be∣ing ever redeem'd. Whereupon, Mr. <HI>Ran∣dal,</HI> being the Eldest, rose up and made the following Speech, as nigh as I can remember.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> and my Fellow-Sufferers; but 'tis to you (pointing at me) that I chiefly address my Speech, being you seem to despair of a Redemption from this Place, (as you call it) more than any other of the same Condition. Is not the Providence of a Power Su∣preme shewn in every Accident in the Life of Man; even you your self, how much better is your Condition now, than you cou'd have imagin'd it wou'd have been a Month ago? There is a Virtue in man∣ly Suffering, and to repine, seems to doubt of the All-seeing Power, which regulates our Actions. If you seem con∣scious of your deserving (as a Punish∣ment for any Crime you have committed) what has happen'd, why do you not with a contrite Heart, lift up your Voice
<PB N="3" REF="81"/>
to Heaven, and sincerely ask Forgiveness of all your past Offences, and that Way free your self of those gross Errors that are crept into your weak Faith. Think you that the Divine Providence that cast <HI>Jonas</HI> from the Bowels of the Whale, has not that Retentive Power still left, to aid and fetch us from this Place?</P>
<P>I must confess, tho' touch'd with what he said, I could not forbear smiling at the Word <HI>Retentive,</HI> which brought to my Mind an Image very diverting in an Acci∣dent that happen'd once to me in <HI>England,</HI> since my Sea Adventures, and perhaps one Time or other I may communicate to my Friends, which I'm sure will divert 'em; for my living on Shore for these six Years last past, has been as extraordinary as my Adventures at Sea.</P>
<P>Here (pursu'd he) we have every Thing that can be requir'd to satisfy Nature; we have Beds to lie on, and a Cover∣ing from the Weather; we have Provisi∣ons for a Twelvemonth, and if we shou'd continue here a longer Time, we need not fear starving, the very Island produ∣cing wherewithal to support Nature, as
<PB N="4" REF="82"/>
Eggs and Fowls; and tho' there is no River or Rivulet of fresh Water, yet it rains so frequently, we need not fear even that, being we have Vessels enough to save it in: You have the least Reason to spurn at Providence of any one here, that had only a Hole in the Earth to save your Water, which had not lasted two Days longer, before we (very happily for you) were thrown on Shore. Is there not a Providence in being thrown on Land, when you expected Drown∣ing before the Morning dawn'd, which happen'd otherwise? Is there not a Pro∣vidence in getting Food, when you expe∣cted to starve? Is there not a Providence in getting Fire by rubbing two Sticks, which you know you could not effect since, tho' we have all endeavour'd at it? Was it not a Providence, that your Boo∣bies remain'd sweet, even till the Day that we came here? And was it not a Providence that we were thrown here, which brought you all Sorts of Provisi∣ons, (I mean all that is necessary) with Flint, and Steel, and other Utensils? And can you then doubt of a farther Provi∣dence,
<PB N="5" REF="83"/>
that have had all these? Besides, even Company is some Allay to Sorrow, you were alone before, and had only your self to talk too. Our Bark is strong and firm, and by Degrees, I don't doubt but with Time and much Labour, to get her into the Water again. I have been a Board her this Morning when you were all asleep, and examin'd her carefully In∣side and Out, and fancy our Liberty may soon be effected; I only wonder we have never thought before of clearing the Sand from our Vessel, which once done, I be∣lieve we may Launch her out into deep Water; we have all our Tackling, Sails and Masts entire, without Damage; I don't despair of the Mercy of God in working our Deliverance, whose Ways are past the Knowledge of us poor insig∣nificant Mortals. I my self have more than once been in the same, or worse Condition.</P>
<P>In a Voyage I made twelve Years a∣go, I suffer'd Shipwreck, and not one Person sav'd but my self: I set out from the City of <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> on Board a Bark bound for the <HI>Baltick,</HI> we past the
<PB N="6" REF="84"/>
<HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Elsenor</HI> and <HI>Helsinburgh,</HI> with∣out meeting any thing material; when one Evening it began to Thunder, Light∣en and Rain prodigiously; the Storm was so violent, that we expected every Mo∣ment when we should be drove on Shore on the Coast of <HI>Sweedland,</HI> or <HI>Nor∣way,</HI> and be dash'd to Pieces. The Storm continu'd so long, that all our Masts came by the Board, our Vessel sprung a Leak, and the Water gain'd upon us e∣very Moment; at last it overpower'd us so much, that we left Pumping, as believ∣ing it impossible to save ourselves, and re∣commended our Souls to the Mercy of the Lord. At last our Ship sunk down∣right, and most of our Men with it; but I and two more had the good Fortune to lay hold of the Main-Mast, (that had been cut above Deck, being it was sprung below, and thrown Over-board to pre∣vent any Danger) which was tangled in some of the Cordage; but the Ship sink∣ing downright, with the Rope that was turn'd to the Main-Mast, gave it such a Tug, that pull'd it under Water; but afterwards loosing or slipping off by good
<PB N="7" REF="85"/>
Fortune, it rose with two of us again, but the third was never seen after. The other that sav'd himself upon the Mast, was the Master, a Man about Sixty Years old, who held pretty well for a∣bout an Hour, but at last thro' Weakness and Age (recommending his Soul to God) fell off; but yet call'd for Help, and I being willing to give, laid hold of him, which I had no sooner done, but he grasp'd at me, and laying fast hold of the Skirt of my Wastcoat, (having never a Coat on) pull'd me off the Mast; but with his Weight and some Strugling I made to save my self, my Skirt rip'd off, and the Master sunk to the Bottom, and I by good Fortune laid hold of the Rig∣ing that hung to the Mast; so once more got on stride it, but with little Hopes of Life: yet doing my Endeavour to save my self, but with a Resignation to the Will of Heaven. At last, after being toss∣ed about for two or three Hours more, the End of the Mast rush'd with such Vi∣olence against a Rock, (as I suppos'd) that with the Shock I was thrown off; but laid hold of some of the Cordage a∣gain,
<PB N="8" REF="86"/>
and held fast till it fix'd it self in some of the craggy Cliffs of the Rock.</P>
<P>By this Time the Tempest was very much abated, and the Waves not dashing so often, nor so fierce, I found that the Mast hung on the craggy Clifts of the Rock, which I climb'd up as fast as I could, least another Wave should dash me against it, and beat my Brains out. After I had got as high as I could, and out of Danger of the Waves, I kneel'd down and return'd Thanks to the Almighty for my wonderful Deliverance; which was won∣derful indeed! For tho' the Mast beat so often against the Rock, yet I escap'd with∣out being so much as bruis'd. When I had poured out the Fullness of my Soul to the All-seeing Power, that had protected me from such an imminent Danger, I com∣pos'd my self to sleep, but with a Calm∣ness wonderful, (even to my self) won∣derful in every Circumstance, that the Almighty Providence should chuse me out of thirty poor Souls that perish'd in the stormy Deep, for a Monument of his Mercy. I slept, but yet my Dreams were troubled; I thought in my Sleep, I
<PB N="9" REF="87"/>
was cast on Shore upon a Barren Rock, where there was not a Creature but my self, no Food, nor any Thing to sustain Nature; which prov'd too true. I was awak'd by something that lick'd my Face, which in my Fright I laid hold on, but soon let it go again upon finding it hairy, which startled me very much; and tho' it was still dark, I could not go to sleep again for the Concern I was in, for fear of some devouring Creature should come and seize me. I listened, and observed the Storm was laid, and the Dawn approaching, I began to com∣pose my Mind, and to put my Trust in him, that had hitherto preserved me.</P>
<P>When it came to be light enough to perceive any Object, I rose up and be∣gan to view the Place; when, to my great Surprize, I found it to be only a large Rock, about half a Mile in Cir∣cumference as near as I could guess; but the North Part so inaccessible, there was no getting to the Top of it: Looking about me, I saw coming fawn∣ing towards me, a large Bitch, which
<PB N="10" REF="88"/>
was the Creature had awak'd me by licking my Face. I must confess I was surprized and pleas'd, and made much of my new Companion. I hop'd from it I should find some humane Creatures; but searching about and not meeting with any, I was more grieved than before; yet still I resign'd my self to the Will of him that sees all Things, and knew it was in his Power to fetch me out of Darkness and the Shadow of Death. In walking up and down in a little Cavity of the Rock, I met with seven young suck∣ing Puppies, that I found belong'd to the Bitch my Companion, for she gave them suck, which I stay'd a little while to observe. Then a Thought came into my Head, that this might be some re∣sort for Fishermen, and I should very shortly see some that would take me from this desolate Place.</P>
<P>I began to search about for something to sustain Nature, but could find no∣thing but some <HI>Perriwinkles,</HI> and other little Shell-fish, which I ventured to feed upon, for now I began to be very hun∣gry. I wonder'd mightily at my poor
<PB N="11" REF="89"/>
Bitch, how she got Food to support her self, and her seven young Ones. I ob∣served she used to leave me two or three times a Day, but return'd in a quarter of an Hour. One Day I had the Curiosity to watch her, but she went so fast, that I could not come up to her; but still I follow'd, and at last came to the Point of a Rock where she went down, and look∣ing below, saw her feeding upon a dead <HI>Seal;</HI> but how it came there I could not suppose, neither could I go down the Rock to see farther, it being so dange∣rous a Place: When she had eat her fill, she came up again, and went to give her young Ones suck. I was mightily put to it for Water, tho' there was good Quantities in several Cavities of the Rock, but so hard to come at, that sometimes I ventured breaking my Neck to get it; besides, I could not expect that would always last, for the Sun was pretty warm, tho' not intolerable. I had in my Pocket a Knife and Fork and a Case of Lancets, but they were rusted by be∣ing wet, and of no use to me, for I could get nothing to exercise 'em on;
<PB N="12" REF="90"/>
indeed my Fork serv'd me to twist out my Perriwinkles.</P>
<P>I had been here now fifteen Days, and nothing to feed on but these sort of Shell∣fish; yet still my Strength and Health continued to a Miracle: I slep'd well, tho' my Bed was something hard: It was compos'd of part of the Rigging that came on Shore with the Mast, which I had untwisted, and pull'd into <HI>Oakham,</HI> and laid it under an hollow Part of the Rock, where no Rain or Wind could hurt me, unless it blew hard South, which when it did, would force a little into my Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>Looking out one Day I saw a Boat coming towards my Rocky Island, the sight rais'd my Spirits wonderfully, but observing her narrowly, I found she was only driving, by the Wind and Tide, without any one in her: However I got down my Rock, and waited for her coming on Shore, which she did within twenty Yards of me; I immediately got in her to rumage her, and, suprizing Provi∣dence! found twenty dry'd Fish, a Salt-Box fill'd with Bisket, and about half a
<PB N="13" REF="91"/>
Pint of Brandy in a Bottle. After gi∣ving God Thanks with great Sincerity of Soul, I fell to, and eat heartily. There were two Oars in the Boat, a Boat-Hook, a small Fisher-Net, and a Tinder-Box, with a Grapling Iron and Rope for a Cable: Upon this I began to be exceed∣ing easy, and thought my self to be in a happy Condition: I brought my Fish on Shore, and stow'd it in my Bed-Chamber, and over it, (for fear of my Bitch,) put several Pieces of Ropes. I had a Tinder Box, and could strike a Light, but had no Candle to burn nor any Provision to dress.</P>
<P>After I had settled every Thing as I would have it, I resolv'd to take my Boat and go round the Rock, to see if I could discover any Thing on the other side of the inaccessible Part. Whereupon I took two of my dry'd Fish, and Half a Dozen Biskets, and put my self on Board; but my poor Bitch came to the Shore Side, and took on so migh∣tily, that I went and took her in. I row'd half round, (as near as I could guess) the first Day; but what made me
<PB N="14" REF="92"/>
so long was, that in some Places, I was oblig'd to row half a League from Shore, to avoid some Shallows which lay out towards the North East side. I ventured to lie in my Boat all Night, and the next Morning went onward in my Voyage, and at last came to that Part of the Rock that I could not get over when I was a Shore. Here I found upon the Ground a Nest of Eggs, about the Bigness of a Duck Egg, yet I could not discover what Fowl own'd them; but I took 'em all a∣way, and ventured to suck one of them, which I found as pleasant as a new laid Hen Egg. Here the Bitch grew very un∣easy, and by her whining and fruitless Endeavours to pass the Rock, (which was Perpendicular) let me understand she wanted to be with her Puppies. Finding nothing here for my Benefit, but my Eggs, I got on Board, and endea∣voured to go round, which I did, till I came to the Place where the Seal lay that my Bitch found, but it stunk abo∣minably; yet she fell to, and after ha∣ving eat, ran up the Rock, and so (as I suppose,) to her Puppies. I went on

Board again; but there arose such a Fog of a suddain, that I could hardly see the Length of the Boat, so rather chose to go back again than venture farther out of my Knowledge, which I did in a little time, the Sea being higher over the Sand, and arrived at my own Habitation.</P>
<P>I pull'd up my Boat as high as I could, and went on Shore, and coming to visit my young Companions found the weak∣est dead for want of the Dam, which I immediately took, cut open and flay'd off the Skin, when after being dry'd, I made me a Cap of, by cutting it in form, and sewing it together with some fine Rope Yarn that I twisted on pupose, and my Fork I us'd instead of a Needle. The Fat serv'd me to make Candles in this Manner, by pulling to Pieces some Rope Yarn and twisting it hard; then I struck a Light, and with an Egg-Shell heated my Fat, and drew the Rope Yarn thro' it, so I provided my self with a new sort of Candle. But then I had but a small Piece of Match, and when that should be gone, I should be at a strange loss how to light my Candle.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="94"/>
Finding my Provision decrease, I came to an Allowance of a Quarter of a Fish a Day, and Half a Bisket, and not to touch that if I could get any Shell-fish, which began to be scarce too, for some Days I could not find above Ten or Twelve, and when I came first there, I us'd to take 'em up by Handfuls. Upon this I began to reflect, that Winter was approaching, and consequently very cold Weather; and then perhaps I should not get any Food; I resolved within my self to venture in my Boat, and sail which way the Wind should direct me, but then I was put to it for a Sail, (for we had cut off the Yards and Sails of the Main Mast, before we threw it over Board) but at last I thought of a White Dimit∣ty Wastcoat that I wore, which was lin'd with Linnen, this I unript and sew'd together again, so pieced the Li∣ning to the Outsides, and made me a tolerable Sail. But in the mean time the Wind blew so high, that I durst not venture out; and continued so long, that my Provision was diminish'd to two Fish, which almost put me to my Wits End.
<PB N="17" REF="95"/>
Shell-Fish were not to be had. So at last I resolv'd to kill one of my Bitch's Whelps; which I did, made a Fire with some Boards I found at the Bottom of my Boat, and roasted it; 'twas palatable and eat wonderfully well, they being not two Months old.</P>
<P>I don't question but you'll all laugh at me, when I shall tell you that it went very much against me to kill this harm∣less Creature; but my Necessity had no Law; besides, I had observ'd but two Days before, that the Seal, which was the Dam's Food, was gnaw'd to the Bones. In short, after some Strugglings with my self, I kill'd five of the six, and salted two of 'em; for after eating my Biskets out of the Salt-Box, I found a Handful or two of Salt at the Bottom, which I made use of in that Manner. The Intrails I boil'd, and gave to the Dam and other Puppy, who eat of it heartily, making no Scruple tho' their own Flesh and Blood. The sixth and last Puppy I resolv'd not to kill at all if I could help it, it being so like the Dam, and wou'd always be with me if it
<PB N="18" REF="96"/>
could, when the others would only play about the Hole where they lay.</P>
<P>In short, I began to find the Weather cold, and so resolv'd to set sail in my Boat, with my two Companions, my Bitch and Puppy; and on the 1st of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> after being on the Rock from <HI>May</HI> the 30th, I set sail with the Wind about N. E. a middling Gale, and steering with my other Oar; for you must know my Boat-Hook was my Mast, and a piece of slit Wood that I sav'd from the Fire was my Yard; so that I cou'd make shift to ply it to Windward upon Occasion, but was resolv'd to sail before the Wind till I discover'd Land; but my Boat being pretty large, and my Sail but small, I could not make my Way as I might have done with a Sail fitted to the Boat, so that I could not discover Land that Night, but sail'd on till about Midnight; then I was so fatigu'd, that in Spite of my self, I was oblig'd to lie along in the Boat, and fell asleep, and slept till I was awaken'd by a Fisherman in a Boat, whom I understood not; but found by his Dialect to be a <HI>Dane.</HI> I gave him
<PB N="19" REF="97"/>
to understand my Condition, by speaking and Signs together, which he seem'd to be sorry for by beating his Breast, and shaking his Head.</P>
<P>He carry'd me a-Shore to a Village, where they made very much of me, and gave me Cloaths; but I would not stir without my Dogs. My Boat was sold, and the Money gave me, for my own Use. After I had stay'd at the Village three Days, I was carry'd to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> the Factor for several <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who made a Gather∣ing for me which amounted to twenty seven Pounds in <HI>English</HI> Money. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> sent a Person to me, who understood <HI>English</HI> very well, and took down the Particulars of my Voy∣age in the <HI>Danish</HI> Language, that I saw afterwards printed there; but no one could ever fix upon the Rock that I liv∣ed on. One said it was such a One, ano∣ther such a One; and some conjectur'd it to be a Part of the Main Land of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> which I should have found if I had ventured further when hinder'd by the Fog.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="98"/>
But I forgot to tell you, that by Printing this Account, a Man came to de∣mand his Boat, that he said he had lost by the Carelessness of a Boy, to whom he had given it in Charge; who neglecting to fasten it on Shore, it drove out to Sea, and came where I had the good Fortune to meet with it, or rather guided by the Eye of Providence, to be the Means or Instrument of saving my Life; which, but for that, I must have inevitably lost. The Fisherman that own'd the Boat, had a New One given him in the Room on't, and to the Value of five Pounds for the Things it contain'd.</P>
<P>The Gentleman that was order'd to take the Notes mention'd above, brought me a Hundred <HI>English</HI> Guineas, collect∣ed from Merchants and Gentlemen of the City. The King likewise order'd me a Hundred more from his Privy Purse; so that in <HI>November</HI> the 18th, I went on Board an <HI>English</HI> Ship, call'd the <HI>Happy,</HI> Captain <HI>John Gibson</HI> Commander. We immediately set sail for <HI>London,</HI> and ar∣riv'd at <HI>Debtford, December</HI> the 25th, being <HI>Christmass-Day,</HI> 1688; but finding
<PB N="21" REF="99"/>
Things out of Order in <HI>England,</HI> I thought it was no Place to settle in. So <HI>January</HI> the 1st I took Horse for <HI>Bristol,</HI> and from thence embark'd for <HI>Cork,</HI> where I had some small Effects, and happily arriv'd there, <HI>January</HI> the 14th; where I was welcom'd from Death, by all my Friends.</P>
<P>But I forgot one Thing which happen∣ed to me at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> Dining with the Gentleman that spoke <HI>English</HI> very well, and several other <HI>Danes,</HI> I hap∣pened to drink to him in <HI>English,</HI> with, <HI>Sir, My humble Service to you,</HI> and ask'd him if he would <HI>Pledge me:</HI> Upon which, he told me, I must never mention Pledg∣ing among <HI>Danes;</HI> for, added he, 'tis the greatest Affront you can put upon 'em. How so, Sir, says I? Why, says he, I know 'tis your Custom in <HI>England,</HI> but if you all knew the Meaning of it, you would surely abolish it. Whereupon, I press'd him to tell me the Foundation of that Custom, according to his Notion. Why says he, when the <HI>Danes</HI> invaded <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and got the Better of the Natives, they us'd often to eat and drink toge∣ther;
<PB N="22" REF="100"/>
but still allowing the <HI>Danes</HI> to be their Masters: And very often, upon some Pique or Interest, they us'd even to stab 'em when they were lifting the Cup to their Mouths. Upon the <HI>English</HI> being frequently murder'd in this Man∣ner, they contriv'd at last when they were at Meals, or drinking with the <HI>Danes,</HI> to say to their next Neighbour, <HI>Here's to you;</HI> upon which, the other cry'd, <HI>I'll pledge you:</HI> Which was as much as to say, he would be his Surety, or Pledge, while the other drank; and accordingly the other would guard him while he drank. When done, the other would drink; and then he that drank before, was to stand his Pledge likewise. Nay, it came to be such a Custom at last, that when one <HI>Englishman</HI> came into the Com∣pany of several <HI>Danes,</HI> he wou'd say in taking up his Cup, to his next Neigh∣bour, Will you Pledge me, with an Em∣phasis; upon the others answ'ring he would, he might drink without Fear.</P>
<P>After staying the Winter at <HI>Cork,</HI> I de∣sign'd to embark with Captain <HI>Clarke,</HI> on Board the Ship <HI>Gilliflower,</HI> and according∣ly
<PB N="23" REF="101"/>
we set out from <HI>Cork, April</HI> the 23d, 1689. for <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and so for <HI>Virginia;</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>Boston June</HI> the 3d, having a quick Passage. After having done our Business there, we set sail for <HI>Virginia.</HI> We doubled <HI>Cape-Cod</HI> without any Danger; but one Night a Storm rose, that flung us on Shore upon the Main, within six Leagues of <HI>Cape-Charles,</HI> where our Men were all sav'd, but in a poor Condition. Our Ship ly∣ing upon the Sands a Furlong from Shore, fourteen out of twenty of our Men that could swim, went into the Long-Boat, and went on Board the Ship, to get some Necessaries; as soon as they had got what they wanted, they came towards the Shore again; but the Boat being deeply Laden, could not come nigh e∣nough to Shore to unload, so that they resolv'd to go farther to seek for deeper Water, and bid us follow along the Shore, which we did; but they doubling a Point of Land, we lost Sight of 'em: However we follow'd on still, when going over a little Swamp, we perceiv'd several <HI>Indi∣dians</HI> in a Wood on our Right-Hand.
<PB N="24" REF="102"/>
Whereupon we began to be in a despe∣rate Fright, but still we march'd on; when coming to the Skirt of the Wood, they let fly their Arrows at us, which kill'd one of our Companions, and wounded two more, one in the Arm, and the o∣ther in the Side of the Neck; as for my part, I still remain'd unhurt, but had an Arrow sticking in the Sleeve of my Watch-coat. After the <HI>Indians</HI> had fir'd, they ran to us with incredible Swiftness, whereupon (having no Weapons) we kneel'd down to 'em, and implor'd their Mercy. One among 'em spoke <HI>English</HI> pretty well, who said, You <HI>Englishmen,</HI> White-Men, we will kill you to be re∣veng'd of your Brothers at <HI>I amestown,</HI> who kill us many <HI>Indians;</HI> we will take you to our <HI>Werowance,</HI> (i. e. <HI>King,)</HI> and he will order us to burn you, where we will drink your Blood, and feed up∣on your Flesh. They hurry'd us along that Night at least twenty Miles up in the Country, and next Morning brought us to their Village, where was their <HI>We∣rowance,</HI> sick in his Cabin; but hearing of our coming, he rose up, and with se∣veral
<PB N="25" REF="103"/>
of his Officers (who are call'd <HI>Cock∣orooses)</HI> came towards us. After he had examin'd the <HI>Indians</HI> (as we suppose) how we were taken, he order'd a great Fire to be made, and had us all ty'd to one Stake fix'd in the Earth; but we were no sooner ty'd, and the Signal given for firing the Wood about us, but we were unty'd and brought back to the Tent, to stay, as we were inform'd, till the next Day, till more <HI>Indians</HI> could come to be Spectators of our Tragedy. They had strip'd us Naked, and in my Breeches-Pocket had found my Box of Instruments, which they examin'd very narrowly, and ask'd which of us it belong'd to? When they were inform'd it was mine, I was im∣mediately sent for before the <HI>Werowance,</HI> who ask'd me by his Interpreter, the Name and Use of every Instrument, which I inform'd him: When he came to my Lancets, and being inform'd they were to Bleed, he ask'd in a great Passi∣on, if I was the Murderer of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were taken by the <HI>English?</HI> But when I let him know it was to let Blood in many Distempers, for Ease for the Bo∣dy,
<PB N="26" REF="104"/>
and that we were Strangers to those <HI>English</HI> that kill'd their <HI>Indians,</HI> he abated of his Anger, and ask'd me if I could show how I let Blood, which I told him I could, if any one wanted it, and was not well. Whereupon the <HI>We∣rowance</HI> said he was not very well; but he would have me try upon one of my Companions, before he would let me Bleed him. I told his Interpreter that he should tell him I would feel his Pulse, that I might know whether 'twas proper to let him Blood or no; Feel his Pulse! what's that? says the Interpreter, and thought I meant something else; where∣upon I took him by the Hand, and show∣ed him what I meant. When the Inter∣preter had satisfy'd him with what I said, he beckon'd me to him, and held out his Hand, which I felt, and found he was in a high Fever; I told the Inter∣preter that he must be let Blood, for his Indisposition was a Fever, and explain'd his Distemper, which he finding to agree with his Condition, seem'd to be mighti∣ly pleas'd; but he would have me Bleed some one of my Companions before him;
<PB N="27" REF="105"/>
I pitch'd upon one that it would not injure, and Bled him upon the Ground till he had Bled enough, and then ty'd up his Arm. The <HI>Werowance</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> were amaz'd to see him Bleed such a Quantity, and ask'd me if he must Bleed as much? I told 'em, yes, or rather more; but that I wou'd have something to save the Blood, be∣cause I could make a better Judgment of the Cause of his Distemper. Where∣upon they brought me a <HI>Callibash,</HI> which I suppos'd might hold a Quart; and upon this, I ty'd up his Arm, and let him Bleed till I had taken about Sixteen Ounces from him, so ty'd up his Arm again. When I had done, he wanted to go into his Hammock to sleep; but I told him he must not go to rest till Night, which he comply'd with. The next Day he was much bet∣ter, and sent for me again, from the Place where they had kept us waking all Night, by Singing and Dancing round us; and if any of us offer'd to sleep, they would jogg us and hinder us. When I came to him I unbound his Arm,
<PB N="28" REF="106"/>
and he looking at the Orifice, and find∣ing it clos'd, was more amaz'd than be∣fore; then he made his Interpreter ask me concerning his Blood, which was cor∣rupted; and when I told him if I had not Bled him, he would soon have dy'd, he got up, and made me sit down upon a Mat which lay in his Cabbin, and told me by his Interpreter, if I would stay with him, he would save both me and my Companions; if we would Fight a∣gainst the <HI>Whites,</HI> and Marry <HI>Indian</HI> Wo∣men, that should be allotted us. I told him I would ask my Companions, who rejoyc'd at the Proposals; (and tho' all marry'd before) yet they made no Scru∣ple of having another Wife. As for my self, (tho' not marry'd,) I did not much care for such a tawny Rib, therefore told the <HI>Werowance,</HI> none of our Profession ever marry'd; he being well satisfy'd with this Answer, spar'd all our Lives. For my part I had a House allotted me to my self, that is a Place about the Height of one Story with us, and cover'd with the Barks of Trees; the Fire-Place is in the Middle of the House, and all the Chim∣ney
<PB N="29" REF="107"/>
is the Door. The Country is gene∣rally pretty even, and agrees very well with an <HI>English</HI> Constitution. I need not describe the Climate, being I sup∣pose you all know the Nature of it as well as I. All the <HI>Indians</HI> that ever I saw, were well Limb'd, and near Six Foot high.</P>
<P>The Marriages were made the next Day without much Ceremony, they were only join'd by their Priests, without any Question on either Side, and so carry'd Home to their several Tents. All the while I was here, they were making Preparations to go against the <HI>English.</HI> One Day I was sent for, and ordered to feel the Pulse of the King; after I had done, he asked me if I could tell any thing of the Affairs of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> by feeling the Pulse; but I told him, that was impossible, without I was with 'em in Person: Whereupon, the King asked me if I would go to the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and come to him again, and give him a true Account of 'em, but says he, you must leave your <HI>Sagamore,</HI> (mean∣ing my Box of Instruments) behind you. I told him I would make it my Business
<PB N="30" REF="108"/>
to inform my self in every Particular, but that I did not know the Way; he told me I should have a <HI>Canoe</HI> and Four <HI>In∣dians</HI> that should carry me within a League of the <HI>English.</HI> I must confess I went with Joy and Sorrow; with Joy to leave such a cursed Place, where Death threatened me every Day; with Sor∣row to go without my Companions: We went into our Canoe, which lay about six Miles from the Place where the King liv'd, but took no Provisions with us; because my <HI>Indians</HI> were to provide for me by catching of Fish, in which they are very dexterous. We went down the River that the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Kuskarra</HI> Ri∣ver, till we came to <HI>Chesapeack-Bay;</HI> then we row'd in our Canoe past <HI>Russels</HI> Is∣lands, and made toward <HI>Cape,</HI> or <HI>Poynt-Comfort;</HI> but coming about a League or thereabouts near the Island, a Boat came down the River, and upon what Account I can't tell; but they fir'd a Musquet, which being heard by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they immediately jump'd Over-board, and swam back again to Shore. I was not much concerned I must own, for there
<PB N="31" REF="109"/>
was no Danger of their being drowned; for most <HI>Indians</HI> swim like Fishes. I took the Paddles and made the best of my Way to <HI>Poynt-Comfort,</HI> which I pass'd, and enter'd <HI>Powhattan</HI> River, (being directed by my <HI>Indians</HI> so to do,) and directed my Way to <HI>Lamestown,</HI> where I arriv'd very late, and was mightily rejoyc'd to find my Companions all well in Health, and ready to embark the next Day for <HI>Boston,</HI> in a Vessel bound for that Place. After refreshing my self, and selling my Canoe, I with the rest of the Company set sail the next Day, and after various Adventures am arriv'd where you see me.</P>
<P>Now think with your self, Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> whether we need doubt the Providence of God in helping us from this Island? There's nothing here like the Hardships I have undergone, and yet have been hap∣pily freed from; and therefore you need not despair. Despair is the Frenzy of the Mind, and ought to be avoided, by having a true Notion of the Pow∣er we serve. Upon this I happen'd to smile, but was mightily check'd by Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> who asked me with a clouded
<PB N="32" REF="110"/>
Countenance, what I smil'd at? I reply∣ed his Story might have had the same Effect upon some old Women, (if it were in Print) that the Sufferings of our Savi∣our had upon a Person in Years. What mean you by that, said Mr. <HI>Randal?</HI> Why, Ill tell you, but I would not have you angry at it, for I really believe every thing you have said to me. But a Re∣verend Divine once at <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lin∣colnshire,</HI> was preaching a Sermon upon Christ's Passion, where he expatiated on the many Sufferings, and what our Sa∣viour underwent to redeem us Mortals from the Curse that was laid upon us: An old Woman (one of the Auditors) took the Parson by the Sleeve as he went out of the Church, and said to him, Indeed, Sir, you have made a very feeling Ser∣mon, which has mov'd me very much, and more especially to ask you a Que∣stion, or two. Say on, good Woman, says the Parson. Pray then, Sir, (says she) how long is it ago since this Matter hap∣pen'd? Almost Seventeen Hundred Years ago. And how far off? (added the old Gentlewoman.) A great Way off, some
<PB N="33" REF="111"/>
Three or Four Thousand Miles from hence. Alack aday! cry'd the Woman, I'm glad on't; Why so, says the Parson? Because (added she) 'tis so long ago, and so far off, I hope in God it is not true. As to your own Belief, (Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> said he,) I leave it to your self; but I don't like jest∣ing with Sacred Things: The old Wo∣man's Ignorance was Compassion; your Knowledge seems to be profane. I have known a great many airy young Fellows that have talk'd idly on such Things, to make People have an Opinion of their Wit; but yet, I believe, even in the ve∣ry Time of their Utterance, their Con∣science told 'em, the very doing what was not pleasing to God or Man. I real∣ly took Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s Way of expressing himself very kindly, and as I ought; for there appear'd so much Sincerity and Can∣dour in all that he said, that it would move any one that had a Sense of Hea∣ven or Humane Nature. Therefore I beg'd his Pardon, and was heartily sorry if I had said ought that might any ways of∣fend him; which he freely forgave. Af∣ter we had spent the Night in Reflecti∣on
<PB N="34" REF="112"/>
of what had past; the next Morn∣ing, we (after imploring the Assistance of the Almighty) went to Work to clear the Sand from our Vessel: which we con∣tinued working on, for 16 Days toge∣ther, resting only on <HI>Sunday,</HI> which at last we effected. We had thrown up the Sand on each side, down from our Vessel quite to the Surface of the Water, when it was lowest. Now the next Thing we had to do, was to get Poles to put under our Vessel to Launch her out, which we got from the <HI>Burton</HI> Wood, but with much difficulty, being we were forced to cut a great many before we could get them that were fit for our Purpose. After we had done this, we returned God Thanks for our Success hitherto, and on the Day fol∣ing, resolved (God willing) to thrust off our Vessel into the Water, but was pre∣vented by Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s being taken Ill of a Fever, occasioned (as we suppose) by his great Fatigue in working to free our Ship from the Sand, wherein he spared no Pains, for to encourage us as much by his Actions as his Words, even be∣yond
<PB N="35" REF="113"/>
his Strength. The Concern we were all in upon this, occasioned our delay in not getting our Vessel out, be∣sides one Hand out of Five, was a weak∣ning our Strength. Mr <HI>Randal</HI> never thought of his Instruments, till now, which he wanted to let himself Blood, but not feeling them about his Cloaths, we suppos'd they might have been over∣look'd in the Vessel, so I ran immediate∣ly to see if I could find them; and getting up the Side, my very Weight pull'd her down to the Sand; which had certainly bruis'd me to Death, if I had not by the Appointment of divine Providence sunk into the Hollow that we had made by throwing the Sand from the Ship. I crept out in a great Fright, and ran to my Companions, who with much ado got her upright, and afterwards we fixed some spare Oars on each side, to keep her up from falling again. For the Pie∣ces of Wood that we had placed under her were greas'd to facilitate her sliping into the Water, and we had dig'd the the Sand so entirely from her, that she rested only on 'em, which occasioned
<PB N="36" REF="114"/>
her leaning to one side with my Weight only, which had not happened, I believe, if I had endeavour'd to have got on Board on the other side, which was highest, but chusing the lowest for my more easy Entrance, was the Cause of the Accident, that happened to me. When we were enter'd into the Vessel, and found our Endeavours to find the Box of Instru∣ments fruitless, we were all mightily con∣cerned, for we verily believed that bleed∣ing would have cured him; nay even he himself said, that if he could be let Blood, he was certain his Fever would a∣bate, and he should be easier; yet to see with what a perfect Resignation he sub∣mitted to the Will of Heaven, it would have inspired one with a true Knowledge of the Being good Men enjoy after a Dissolution from this painful Life. He was still worse and worse; but yet so Patient in his Sufferings, that perfectly amaz'd us all. He continued in this Manner a whole Week, without tasting any Thing but Water-gruel ill made, for what little Oatmeal we had, was sower. When we saw by the Course of Nature,
<PB N="37" REF="115"/>
it was impossible he should last long, we all were very much griev'd; as for my own Part, I could not forbear shed∣ding Tears, for I had taken such an Af∣fection to him, that almost equall'd a Child's Love to a Parent. He seeing me weep, call'd me with a faint Voice towards him; and when I was near him, he made me sit down by him. After several kind Expressions, which made my Tears flow more plentifully, he said to me, Mr. <HI>Fal∣coner,</HI> if you grieve for me, dry your Tears, I desire nothing but your Prayers. I am going to pay a Debt incumbent on me by Nature, and a Debt that must be paid, which was contracted at my Birth, and Death will not admit of any Evasion; all Mortals owe the same Acknowledg∣ment, but some squander away that Sub∣stance which should be freely paid when call'd for. How happy are they that provide against such a Creditor, that may come at any Hour of Day or Night, and lawfully demand his due? Here is no Shuffling as in worldly Matters, no putting off the important Visiter; there∣fore as we are sure he will call upon us,
<PB N="38" REF="116"/>
'tis good to be always provided against the Time. How happy are honest Minds, when they have provided to satisfy their worldly Creditors; they then live in a Contentment of Mind, peculiar to an honest Heart: But what must be said for the last Debt, upon which depends the Welfare of the Soul, our doing well or ill hereafter, is it not of the utmost Importance? Therefore as I am endea∣vouring to pay that Debt, whose utmost Limit will soon expire, help me by your Prayers to finish what I hope I have well begun, and as Friend's Advice, prepare to make up your Accounts to Heaven, for you know not how soon they may be call'd for; besides you will have one less to eat of the Provision is left. After this, being tir'd with speaking so much toge∣ther, he turn'd to rest himself, but his Fever was so violent, he could take no ease in Body, tho' tranquil in Mind. So finding we could not expect his Life, we pray'd for a speedy and a painless Release from it. After this we gave him some Water (which he often beg'd for in vain) to cool his Mouth. When he had
<PB N="39" REF="117"/>
drank it, he said he found himself a lit∣tle easier, and the Pain and Burning something abated, which we took as a lightning before Death, or as the Spirits collected together to make their last fruitless Efforts.</P>
<P>When he found himself just upon the Point of expiring, he made this short Prayer, which was so imprinted in my Memory, that I shall never forget it: O Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth, whose all-seeing Eye looks into the in∣most Corner of the Heart! pardon my Offences, which I heartily repent of, and rely upon the infinite Grace of thy wont∣ed Mercy to absolve me of all my past Crimes, through the Merits of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Then lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven expi∣red, with the Happiness of continuing in his right Senses in such a Fever, which is almost always attended with a Fren∣zy.</P>
<P>After our Sorrow for his Death was something abated, we consulted how to bury him. Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mus∣grave</HI> were for sewing him in his Ham∣mock
<PB N="40" REF="118"/>
and throwing him into the Sea; But Mr. <HI>White</HI> and my self were for burying him on the Land, which they a∣greed to; so we dig'd the Hole which I designed for my Well, Seven Foot long and Seven deep, and return'd him to Earth from whence he came. Upon the Bark of the Tree that shaded his Grave, I wrote this Epitaph.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes">Under this Tree lies the Body of <HI>Thomas Randal,</HI> Gent. born in the Ci∣ty of <HI>Cork, Anno Domini</HI> 1641. who was thrown ashore with <HI>Richard White, William Musgrave,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Middle∣ton,</HI> both of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to the Consola∣tion of <HI>Richard Falconer</HI> of <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> who was unfortunately cast on Shore before them on the 18th of of <HI>September</HI> 1699. yet received from their Conversation a Mitigation of his own Misfortune. Whose Chance it is ever to read these Lines, pay a Tear to the Memory of <HI>Thomas Randal,</HI> and endeavour to make as good an End as he did, who died a Natural Death on <HI>Friday December</HI> the 21st 1699, in his perfect Mind, and a true Notion of the
<PB N="41" REF="119"/>
Power of God to pardon all his Faults, whose Failings were corrected by a sin∣cere Penitence, dying every Day he lived.</Q>
<P>This took me up a whole Tree. Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> made no Will; yet I claimed his Dog, being the Whelp of the Bitch he found upon the Rock which he was thrown upon in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the Bitch being Dead some Years before. We were forced to tie him up after we had buried Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> for with his Feet he would scrape Holes in the Grave two Foot deep, and howl prodigiously.</P>
<P>After this we prepared once more to Launch our Vessel; but first we put on Board what Provision we had left, and all the Things that we took from thence. Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s Death gave me (with the others Permission) a Title to a Bed, which I wanted before. So that I took up the Cabin which was alloted me, and laid on Board every Night: And now we bent our Thoughts intirely on our Vessel, and on <HI>Monday</HI> the 31st of <HI>December</HI> launch'd her out into the Sea, and de∣sign'd to set Sail the next Day. After we had fix'd her fast with two Anchors,
<PB N="42" REF="120"/>
and a Halser on Shore, we went on Board to Dine and make ourselves Merry, which we did very heartily, and to add to our Mirth, we made a large Can of Punch, which we never attempted to do before, being we had but one Bottle of Lime Juice in all, and was what (indeed) we design'd for this Occasion; in short the Punch ran down so merrily, that we were all in a drunken Condition; but when it was all gone, we resolved to go to rest: But all I could do, could not persuade 'em to lie on Board that Night in their Cabins, (yet without a Bed;) but they would venture, tho' they were obliged to swim a hundred Yards before they could wade to Shore, but however they got safe, which I knew by their hollowing and rejoicing.</P>
<P>Having brought my Bed on Board, I went to rest very contentedly, which I did till next Morning: But oh! Horror! when I had drest my self, and going on Deck, to call my Companions to come on Board to Dine, which was intended over Night, and afterwards to go on Shore, and bring our Sails and Yards on
<PB N="43" REF="121"/>
Board, and make to Sea as fast as we could, I could not see any Land, which so overcame me on the Suddain, that I sunk down on the Deck, without Sense or Motion: How long I continu'd so, I can't tell, but I awak'd full of the Sense of my lamentable Condition, and ten thou∣sand Times (spight of my Resolution to forbear) curs'd my unhappy Stars, that had brought me to that deplorable State. O Wretch that I am! what will my unhappy Fate do with me, is any one's Condition equal to mine? (I would cry) But 'tis a just Punishment, in not rendering to God the Tribute due for his Mercies, that we had hitherto known. Instead of coming on Board to be Frolick∣some and Merry, we should have given Thanks to him, that gave us the Blessing of thinking we were no longer subject to such Hardships, that we might probably have undergone, if we had been detain'd longer on that Island. If poor Mr. <HI>Ran∣dal</HI> had remain'd among us, this Misfor∣tune had not happened. He by his wise and prudent Care and Conduct, would have prevented this unlucky Accident. What
<PB N="44" REF="122"/>
must my poor Companions think that are left in a more miserable Condition than my self, if it be possible. I have no Com∣pass, neither am I of my self capable of ruling the Vessel in a Calm, much less if there should a Storm happen, which are too frequent in this Climate.</P>
<P>After I had vented my Grief in a Tor∣rent of Words and Tears, I began to think how the Vessel should have gone to Sea without my Knowledge; and by Remem∣brance of the Matter the Night before, found by our Eagerness and fatal Care∣lessness, we had forgot to fasten our Ca∣bles to the Geers, and pulling up the Halser that we had fasten'd to one of the <HI>Burton</HI> Trees on Shore, perceiv'd that the Force of the Vessel had pull'd the Tree out of the Earth. Then I too late found that a Hurricane had rose when I was sound asleep, and stupify'd by too much Liquor, and carry'd off the Vessel. This Reflection wounded me deeper than be∣fore, which I follow'd with Curses on that Liquor that steals away our Senses, and makes worse than Beasts of Humane Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="123"/>
Now I began to call upon him that hears us in the Time of Trouble, even when the Wind blows loudest, whose Nod can shake the Frame of Earth from off its Basis; and with a Heart sincere, and vicious Thoughts corrected, I sent my Soul in Penitential Words and Tears before his Throne of Mercy, imploring a speedy Ending of my Life or Troubles; when I began to be something better con∣tented in my Mind, and thought of su∣staining Nature almost spent, with the Fatigue and Grieving: One great Com∣fort I had of my Side, which my poor (former) wretched Companions wanted, that was Provision in Plenty, and fresh Water; so that when I began to consider coolly, I found I had not that Cause to complain which they had, who were left on a Barren Island, without any other Provision than that very same Diet which I was forc'd to take up with, when first thrown on Shore; that is, the Boobies, whose Numbers were mightily diminish'd, before we design'd to leave the Island.</P>
<P>What made me most uneasy, was to think what my Companions could judge
<PB N="46" REF="124"/>
of me, whether they should take it for Design or Chance; but then I still'd that Thought, by knowing they must needs see that the Tree was forc'd away with Violence beyond the Strength of Man. Besides, I had another small Comfort, that was the Company of my Dog, which lay on Board with me, which I us'd to talk to as if he were a rational Creature; and the poor Creature wou'd stand and stare me in the Face, as if he were sensible of what I said to him. It was a very hand∣some Creature, of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kind; but very good-natured, and would often go to the Cabbin where I lay, which was that of his old Master's, and whine migh∣tily.</P>
<P>I remain'd toss'd upon the Sea for a Fortnight without discovering Land; for the Weather continu'd very calm, but yet so hazy that I could not perceive the Sun for several Days. One Day search∣ing for some Linnen that I had drop'd under the Sacking of my Bed, (for I did not lie in a Hammock) I found an old Glove with 75 Pieces of Eight in't, which I took and sew'd in the Waste-Band
<PB N="47" REF="125"/>
of my Breeches, for fear I should want it some time or other. I made no Scruple of taking it, for I was well assu∣red it did belong to poor Mr. <HI>Randal.</HI> Beside I had heard the other People say, that they were sure he had Money some∣where; and after his Death we search'd for it, but could not find any.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 20th I discover'd a Sail to Leeward of me, but she bore away so fast, that there was not any Hope of Succour from her, and I had not any Thing to distinguish me; and I suppos'd tho' I could see them, yet they could not see me by Reason of my want of Sail, which would have made me the more conspicuous. The next Day I discover∣ed Land, about six Leagues to the S. W. of me, which I observ'd my Vessel did not come nigh, but coasted along Shore; but I was well assured it was the Pro∣vince of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and was the Place we came from; now all my Fear was that I should fall into their Hands, who would make me do the Work of a Slave; but even that I thought was better than to live in con∣tinual
<PB N="48" REF="126"/>
Fear of Storms and Tempests, or Shipwreck.</P>
<P>I coasted along in this Manner for two or three Days, and at last discover'd Land right a-head, which I was very glad of; but yet mix'd with some Fear, in not knowing what Treatment I should have. I began now to think of some E∣vasion, and not to tell 'em the Truth, of belonging to the Logwood Vessel, but resolv'd to tell 'em that we were taken by a <HI>French</HI> Privateer, and after being rumag'd, were turn'd off as useless.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 30th, I made the Bay and Town of <HI>Francisco di Campeche,</HI> as it prov'd afterwards, and was almost upon it before I was met by any Thing of a Ship, or a Boat; but at last two Canoes came on Board with one <HI>Spaniard</HI> and six <HI>Indians,</HI> who were much surpriz'd when they understood my Condition by speak∣ing broken <HI>French,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> understood. They immediately carry'd me on Shore, and from thence to the Governor, who was at Dinner; they would have had me staid till he had din'd; but he hearing of me, commanded
<PB N="49" REF="127"/>
me to come in, where he was at Dinner with several Gentlemen, and two La∣dies; and tho' 'tis very rare any one sees the Women, yet they did not offer to Veil themselves. I was ordered to sit down by my self at a little Table placed for that Purpose, where I had sent me of what composed their Dinner, which was some fresh Fish, and Fowls, and ex∣cellent Wine of several Sorts.</P>
<P>The Chief Town of the Province of <HI>Ju∣catan,</HI> lies twelve Leagues from the Sea on either Side, which is a Bishop's See, and the Resident of the Governor of this Province. <HI>Valladolid</HI> is the second City; and <HI>Campeche</HI> the third; yet tho' but the third reckon'd, it far exceeds the rest, for Riches and Magnificence. It is a well situated neat built Town, and by Com∣putation contains near Two Thousand Houses. It is well fortified both by Art and Nature: By the former in a strong, well built, neat Castle, that contains a Hundred Brass Cannon, and several Mor∣tars; and the latter by a Ridge of Hills, that runs all along the Side of the City. There is in the Castle a very neat Piaz∣za,
<PB N="50" REF="128"/>
consisting of about Thirty high Arches. This Town has the chiefest Trade; for from this Place, the other Ci∣ties and Towns are furnished with all Necessaries that come from the <HI>Havana</HI> and other Places in <HI>America;</HI> and like∣wise from <HI>Old Spain.</HI> Yet for all their Power, Riches and Strength, Capt <HI>Par∣ker,</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> with one Ship, and a small Bark, and whose whole Crew contain'd but a Hundred and Forty Men, Landed in the Middle of the Day, and in Spite of all their Forces, which were Two Hundred Horse, and Five Hundred Foot, took the Place, with the Gover∣nor and several other Persons of Quality; together with a rich Ship laden with In∣gots and several other valuable Ladings, before they knew of the City's being ta∣ken. This Province of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> contains in Compass Nine Hundred Miles, and is situated between Eighteen and Twenty Degrees, Northern Latitude. The Air is very hot, and not altogether so Wholesome as some other Parts of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> are. The Distempers that reign here, are mostly Fluxes and Feavers, which
<PB N="51" REF="129"/>
carry off Abundance of New Comers. This Province was first discover'd by <HI>Fer∣dinando Cortez,</HI> among his Conquests of <HI>New Spain;</HI> and tho' not altogether so Fruitful, yet by the Industry of the In∣habitants, 'tis as Rich as any of the o∣ther Provinces of <HI>New Spain;</HI> for they are most either Merchants or Tradesmen: And 'tis the Vulgar Opinion, that these People are more hard and barbarous than any other Part of the <HI>Spanish West-Indies;</HI> yet, for my own part, I receiv'd more Ci∣vility by 'em, than if I had been among my own Friends in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Tradition here among the Inhabitants, that they us'd a Ceremony much like our Baptism, and which had in their Language, the Term of Regene∣ration, or Second Birth; which they thought to be the Seed or Groundwork of all good and just Things; and after being initiated, they were certain it was not in the Power of the Evil Spirit to hurt 'em in Body or Goods: Neither were they permitted to Marry, without first taking that Order upon 'em, which they us'd to distinguish by an <HI>Ostriche</HI>'s
<PB N="52" REF="130"/>
Feather, larger and longer than any other they us▪d to wear for Ornaments upon their Heads.</P>
<P>They have another Tradition, that this Province of <HI>Jucatan</HI> was first Inha∣bited, and Cultivated by a White-Bearded People, that came from the East; after being toss'd many Moons upon the Sea, and suffering many Hardships for Want of Food and Fresh Water, and other Ne∣cessaries; yet reliev'd from Want and their Enemies, through the Power of the Deity they Worship'd, who even com∣manded the Sun to Shine, or not Shine; who made it Rain or dry Weather; who could heal Sickness, or send Distempers; in short, a God that kept all the other petty Deities in Awe.</P>
<P>This Story, if true, seems to confirm an old Tradition of our <HI>Welsh</HI> Chroni∣cles, that tell us of one <HI>Madoc ap Owen,</HI> Son to <HI>Guineth,</HI> a Prince of that Coun∣try, who was drove by some Disgust, from his own Country, with several Com∣panions, who after various Adventures at Sea, were driven on an unknown Land to the West, many Hundred Leagues,
<PB N="53" REF="131"/>
where they had Communication in a friendly Manner, with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and made a Settlement. Whereupon <HI>Madoc ap Owen</HI> return'd for <HI>Britain</HI> again, and got to the Number of Two Thousand Men and Women, besides Children, which mix'd with the Natives, and left among 'em several of their Opinions and Man∣ners; which they retain'd till the last, when <HI>Cortez</HI> subdu'd 'em; but now, by the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Natives are almost extinguished.</P>
<P>After they had feasted me for two or three Days, they sent me about with several Officers appointed by the Gover∣nour, to make a Gathering, which we did with Success; for in Three Days we had got Seven Hundred and odd Pieces of Eight: And Two Merchants there, were at the Charge of fitting up my Bark, in Or∣der to send it for my poor Companions. When it was finish'd, they gave me seve∣ral Necessaries for my self and Compani∣ons, to hearten us up; as some Bottles of fine Wines; Two Bottles of Citron-Water, for a Cordial; Chocolate, and several other useful Things: But the Dif∣ficulty
<PB N="54" REF="132"/>
was to get Seamen to go with me: At last they remembered they had Five <HI>Englishmen</HI> that were Prisoners there, and taken in the Bay of <HI>Campeche,</HI> upon Suspicion of Piracy, but nothing could be prov'd against 'em; which they Freed without any Ransom: This did not look like Barbarity or Ill-Nature; for I receiv'd as much Humanity among 'em, as could be expected from any of the most Civiliz'd Nations: But they have a greater Kindness for the <HI>English,</HI> than they have for their Neighbours the <HI>French,</HI> being the <HI>English</HI> are more open and ge∣nerous, (they say) and don't use Strata∣gems to deceive 'em, as the <HI>French</HI> do frequently; tho' they only pay 'em in their own Coin, for there is no Nation under the Sun more fruitful than the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> in Plottings and Ambuscades, (as they call 'em) to deceive their Enemies; which yet they think lawful.</P>
<P>On <HI>February</HI> the 15th, 1700. we set sail from <HI>Campeche</HI> Bay, after paying my Acknowledgment to the generous Go∣vernour, &amp;c. but having nothing to present him with worth Acceptance, but my <HI>Ovid,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="133"/>
I gave him that, which he took very kindly, and said he would prize it mightily, not only in having never a one, but in Re∣membrance of me and my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>We ply'd it to Windward very briskly, and in Fifteen Days discover'd the Isles of the <HI>Alcranes;</HI> but we durst not go in within the Shoals, because we were all ignorant of the Channel. So we cast Anchor, and hoisted out our Boat, with Two Men and my self, and made to Shore, where we found my Three Companions, but in a miserable Condition, and Mr. <HI>Mus∣grave</HI> so faint and weak, that they ex∣pected he could not live long.</P>
<P>When they awak'd the next Day, af∣ter I was drove off in the Dark, they were all in Despair, to find the Vessel gone, which they perceiv'd was occasion'd by a Hurricane, that they were assur'd was violent, because it had blown down their Tent, tho' without awaking 'em. But when they began to consider they had no Food, nor but very little fresh Water, which was left in a Barrel with∣out a Head in the Tent, their Despair increas'd; but as no Passion can last long
<PB N="56" REF="134"/>
that's violent, it wore off with their Care for Sustenance, which they diligently search'd for; but not finding any Quan∣tity of Eggs, or Boobies, the dreadful Fear of Starving came into their Minds, with all its horrid Attendance. Now they imagin'd that all that happen'd to 'em, was, as I had thought, a Judgment of Divine Providence for the vile Sin of Drunkenness, when they should have ra∣ther implor'd Heav'n's Assistance, in fur∣thering 'em in their Delivery from the Place where they were.</P>
<P>They had been now Five Days with∣out Eating or Drinking, not for Want of Stomachs, but Food, which they endea∣vour'd to get, but all to no Purpose; for the Boobies were retir'd, either out of Fear, or Custom, to some other Place▪ Neither could they find one Egg more, and Weakness came so fast upon 'em, with Hunger and Drought, that they were hardly able to crawl, so they thought of nothing but dying; when at last they remember'd the Body of good Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> that had been buried a Week, which they dug up, without be∣ing
<PB N="57" REF="135"/>
putrify'd; and that poor Wretch that help'd to support our Misfortunes when alive with his sage Advice, now was a Means of preserving their Lives, tho dead. They had by good Fortune left 'em a Tinder-Box in the Tent, (we hav∣ing two) with which they struck a Light, and made a Fire, then cut off several pie∣ces of Flesh of the Brawn of his Arms and Thighs, broil'd 'em on the Coals, tho' with a great deal of Reluctance; which was the Means of keeping Life and Soul together, till we came to relieve 'em from that deplorable Condition. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> we brought to a little Life and Strength, by giving him some Citron-Water in small Quantities. When I saw the Carcass of my poor good Monitor lie for Food for Humane Creatures, my Horror at the Sight overcame my Reason, and I believe I said Things shocking enough; however when I had calmly considered their Condition, I was ve∣ry sorry for what I had said, and beg'd their Pardon. After we had refreshed our selves, we once more laid him in the Earth, having sew'd his poor Bones in one of the Hammocks.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="136"/>
I must confess, I never think of that good Man, but Tears come into my Eyes, and Melancholy clouds all my Thoughts: For he was one whose Cha∣racter came up to all we cou'd desire in frail Men. Honest, without Interest; Friendly, without Design; Religious, at∣tended with Reason, and not swadled up so tite as to make it deform'd: Pleasant in Conversation, Courteous to All, Ha∣ting nothing but Vice: Gentle in Re∣proving; Bold in All Dangers, in being arm'd with an Innocence that inspir'd him with Success; in short, he was a Mira∣cle of a Man, when we consider his Life had been always at Sea, among a Crew prone to all manner of Vices, and where it was not possible to find a Pattern to follow of any Goodness.</P>
<P>He was a single Man, or rather indeed, a Batchelor; for he had often told me, he cou'd not bear to Marry a Woman, to put her into Frights and Fears when the Wind blew hard, as every good Wife must certainly be concern'd for the Danger of her Husband. Besides, as it was his Fortune to lead a Seafaring Life, he cou'd
<PB N="59" REF="137"/>
not think of Marrying, to be absent from his other self so long; (as he term'd it) not but if he had had a sufficient Com∣petency, he said, he believ'd he shou'd have enter'd into the Marriage State in the latter Part of Life, that he might have settl'd his Mind; and free from the Hazard and Turmoils of the Sea, slip'd into his Shrowd with Content, among his Friends and Acquaintance at Home.</P>
<P>He was an excellent Sailor, and knew most Parts of the World perfectly well; understood <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish,</HI> and seem'd to have a pretty good Know∣ledge in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. His Jour∣nals were mostly taken in Short-Hand. But he had one small Manuscript, con∣taining about Twenty Leaves, <HI>Spanish</HI> on one Side, and <HI>English</HI> on the other, all in his own Hand; which I suppose he had Translated for his Diversion, or to pass away his Leisure Hours. It was a Treatise of Herbs and Flowers, with other Rarities, to be found in the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> Which being but short, I shall give my Readers at the latter End of this Piece. On the Flat of his Book, he had
<PB N="60" REF="138"/>
writ in a large Hand these Words. <HI>This Manuscript in</HI> Spanish, <HI>I have Transcrib'd from the Original of the Reverend Father</HI> Pedero di Riberia, <HI>of the Order of</HI> Jesus, <HI>when I was Pilot in</HI> Mexico. <HI>The Trans∣lation I have made at my Leisure Hours; and the Cures by the Simples, &amp;c. menti∣on'd in the said Book, I have been an Eye-Witness to many of, and some were pra∣ctis'd on my self.</HI> But more of this here∣after.</P>
<P>We now were got on Board once again, in order to sail as soon as the Wind would rise, it being stark Calm, and continu'd so two Days; but at last it blew a little, and we weigh'd Anchor, and stood out to Sea; but made but lit∣tle Way. I now was Master, or Cap∣tain of a Ship, and began to take upon me; we were in all Nine Men, all <HI>Eng∣lish;</HI> that is, My self first, <HI>Richard White, W. Musgrave,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Middleton,</HI> my old Companions: <HI>John Stone, W. Kea∣ter, Francis Hood, W. Warren,</HI> and <HI>Jo∣seph Meadows,</HI> (All of <HI>England)</HI> the Five Men given me by Don <HI>Antonio;</HI> who, as I said before, were taken on Suspicion
<PB N="61" REF="139"/>
of Pyracy. Whereupon a Thought came into my Head, that had escap'd me be∣fore: I consider'd if these were really Pyrates, being Five to Four, they might be too powerful for us, and perhaps murder us. <HI>Franc Hood</HI> we had made our Cook, to dress our Provision, which he understood a little. One Day we All Din'd together upon Deck, under our Awning, it being very calm Weather; an <HI>Awning</HI> is only a Sail fix'd at the Quarter-Deck, and carry'd over the <HI>Booms</HI> (that is, spare Masts that lie along from Quar∣ter to Forecastle) to the Forecastle, to keep the Sun from our Heads: in Men of War, and great Ships, they have one made of several Kinds of handsome Stuff, for the Officers on the Quarter-Deck; besides another on the Main Deck, for the Common Sailors. One Day, as I said before, being at Dinner, for we All eat together; I ask'd the five Men, what was the Reason they were taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Pyrates? Upon this they seem'd nonplus'd, but <HI>Warren</HI> soon re∣cover'd himself, as well as the rest, and spake for the others, in this Manner: We
<PB N="62" REF="140"/>
embark'd on Board the Ship <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> in the <HI>Thames,</HI> bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we made a prosperous Voyage; but after taking in our Lading in our Way Home, we were overtaken by a Storm, in which our Ship was lost, and all the Men perish'd, but my self and Four Companions; who were sav'd in the Long-Boat: But the Reason we were taken for Pyrates was, that making to Shore to save our selves, we saw a Bark riding at Anchor, without the Port of <HI>Campeche,</HI> which we made to, in order to enquire wherea∣bouts we were, and to beg some Provisi∣ons, our own being gone, and entring the Vessel, found but two People in't; the third, jumping into the Water, swam on Shore, and brought three Boats fill'd with <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers, which enter'd the Vessel before we could make off. Make off! said I, what did you design to run away with the Vessel? No; answer'd <HI>Warren,</HI> with some Confusion, but we did design to weigh Anchor, and go far∣ther in Shore, that we might land in the Morning, it being late at Night; but we were prevented by their coming on
<PB N="63" REF="141"/>
Board us, where we were found, being arm'd, which we had taken Care of, when we went into our Boat, to defend our∣selves, if we were obliged to land among the <HI>Savages:</HI> And indeed they had their Arms restor'd 'em, when they were freed and sent on Board with me.</P>
<P>I must confess, I did not like the Fel∣low's being nonplus'd now and then, in not knowing what to say; but upon Consideration, thought it might be for Want of Words to express himself better, which is the Occasion very often of Peo∣ple of common Understanding Stammer∣ing, and Humming, and Hawing, to put their Words in better Order; so for that Time I took no more Notice, not weigh∣ing it in my Mind. But in the Evening Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> came to me, with a Face of Concern, and told me he did not like these Fellows Tale. Why so? says I. Because I observe they herd together, answer'd he, and are always whispering and speaking low to one another. Oh! says I, there cannot be any Danger in 'em; for if they had any Inclination to run away with our Vessel, they might
<PB N="64" REF="142"/>
have done it when they were five to one, before we took you in. I know not, re∣ply'd <HI>Middleton,</HI> I have a Heart forebodes something. Pshaw, old Womens Fears; (said I) for, as I said before, they wou'd have don't when they had more Power; before I landed on <HI>Despair Island,</HI> (as I call'd it) if they had any such Intentions. There is a Providence that rules o'er all our Actions, (answer'd <HI>Middleton)</HI> that we can no more see into, than the Book of Fate; but if a foreboding Heart may speak, I am sure something we shall suf∣fer from these Fellows, that will be of Danger to us. If so, reply'd I, there's no resisting the Will of Providence; for what will come, will come, and there's no Fending against it: But, added he, this seems something like Fore▪know∣ledge; and to resist against that, seems like struggling against the Will of Heav'n; that warns us by these Forebodings to prevent these Accidents of Life. I be∣lieve God, pursu'd he, has fix'd a Period to our Breath; but Accidents that hap∣pen in this Pilgrimage of Life, may be avoided by a timely Notice: As we are
<PB N="65" REF="143"/>
all Partakers of free Will, and from that, form our own Happiness, or Misery, it cannot be said but that the Actions of Life may be regulated by that free Will. Our Maker never form'd a Villain! nei∣ther does their external Parts differ from a virtuous Man's; if they did, they were to be easily avoided: But as an old Poet says, <HI>There's no Art to find the Mind's Construction in the Face.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Discourse, I began to stag∣ger in my Opinion of their Honesty, and therefore we resolv'd to stand upon our Guard. We took no Notice of our Con∣ference then to our two other Compani∣ons, but resolv'd to stay till Night, we having a better Opportunity, being we lay together in the Cabbin Aft; (which is as much as to say, in the Stern, or be∣hind) when we were to go to Supper, we call'd one another to come, but five of the Sailors excus'd themselves, by saying they had Din'd so lately, that they had no Stomach as yet; whereup∣on we had an Opportunity sooner to converse together than we design'd. For being at Supper, we open'd the Matter
<PB N="66" REF="144"/>
to our other two Companions, and they agreed immediately that we were in some Danger; so we resolv'd in the middle Watch of the Night, to seize 'em in their Sleep. We were to have the first Watch, which we set at Eight of the Clock; then they were to Watch till Twelve; and then in their third Watch, between One and Two, we had conclu∣ded to seize upon 'em as they slept; that is, Four of 'em, for One of them watch'd with us, which was <HI>Franck Hood,</HI> the Cook; whom we agreed to seize and bind fast, towards the latter End of the Watch, and to threaten him with Death if he offer'd to make the least Noise.</P>
<P>As soon as ever our first Watch was set, we sent Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> to prepare our Arms; in about a Half an Hour, or thereabouts <HI>Warren,</HI> call'd to <HI>Hood</HI> upon Deck, (they lying below) to get him a little Water, for he was bloody dry, he said: Whereupon the other went down immediately with some Water in a Can to him. As soon as he was gone down, I had the Curiosity to draw as near the Scuttle as I could to hear the Discourse.
<PB N="67" REF="145"/>
Now, you must know, <HI>Hood,</HI> our Cook, had been employ'd that Day about search∣ing our Provisions, our Beef Casks, and Pork, to see what Quantity we had, that we might know how long it would last; so that the others had not an Opportu∣nity to disclose the Design to him. As soon as he was got down, I cou'd hear <HI>Will Warren</HI> say to him G—d D—n ye, <HI>Franck,</HI> we had like to have been smoak'd to Day; and tho' we had con∣triv'd the Story that I told 'em, yet I was a little surpriz'd at their asking me, because then I did not expect it; but we design to be even with 'em in a very lit∣tle Time: For, hark ye, says he, and spake so low that I cou'd not hear him; upon which, the other said there's no Difficulty in the Matter; but we need not be in such Haste, for you know, as we ply it to Windward, a Day or two can break no Squares, and we can soon (after the Effecting our Design) bear down to Leeward to our Comrades that we left on Shore; for I fancy, added he, that they have some small Suspicion of you now, (which in Time will sleep)
<PB N="68" REF="146"/>
and may be on their Guard; therefore 'tis better to wait a Day or two: No, G—d Z—ds, we'll do it too Night, when they are asleep, reply'd <HI>Warren;</HI> whereupon there were many Arguments, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> (as I fancy'd) but they spoke so low, that I cou'd only hear a G—d D—n ye, now and then, and something of that Kind.</P>
<P>A little while after, <HI>Hood</HI> came up a∣gain, and after walking up and down, and fixing his Eyes often upon me, who in the mean Time was provided with a Couple of Pistols under my Watch-Coat, and indeed were their own, that we hung up ready charg'd in our Cabbin; which was one Reason of their Design to seize on us in our Sleep, being they had no Arms till they cou'd seize on 'em where they hung; or else, they were such des∣perate Fellows, they wou'd have don't in the open Day. <HI>Hood,</HI> as I said before, seem'd to fix his Eyes frequently upon me, for till now I never watch'd in the Night; at last, said he very softly, if you please, Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> I have a Word or two to say to you, that much con∣cerns
<PB N="69" REF="147"/>
you All. What is it? says I. Why, answer'd He, I wou'd have the rest of your Companions, Ear Witnesses too; with that I call'd 'em together; but, says he, let's retire as far from the Scuttle as we can, that we may not be heard by a∣ny below Deck; so we went into the Cabbin, and open'd the Scuttle above, that Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> who steer'd, might hear what was said. When we were sat down upon the Floor, Mr. <HI>Hood</HI> began as follows. My four Companions below have a wicked Design upon you; that is, to seize you, and put you into the Boat, and run away with your Vessel: But I thinking it an inhuman Action, not only to any one, but to you in particu∣lar, that have been the Means of their Freedom; therefore, I hope, appointed by Providence, I come to let you know it, that we may think of some Means to prevent it. Upon this, (finding his Sin∣cerity,) I told him that we were provi∣ded against it already; and with the Con∣sent of my Companions, told him our Design of seizing 'em in the third Watch; but, says he, they intend to put their
<PB N="70" REF="148"/>
Project in Practice, their next Watch; therefore I think 'twill be more proper for us to Counter-plot 'em, and seize 'em this; but as they have no Arms, says I, and we have, we need not fear 'em.</P>
<P>We had several Debates about this, which took up too much Time to our Sorrow. For <HI>Warren</HI> mistrusting <HI>Hood,</HI> it seems, got up and listen'd, and when he found that we retir'd all of us to the Cabbin, he got upon Deck, and steal∣ing softly, came so close, that he over∣heard every thing we said, which as soon as he understood, he went immediately to his Companions, who waited impatient∣ly, (as they told us afterwards) and let 'em know all our Discourse; whereupon, without pausing, they resolv'd to seize us immediately, in the Midst of our Con∣sultation; which was no sooner resolv'd upon, but done: For we were immediately surpriz'd with their seizing us, which they did with that Quickness, and so unper∣ceivably, that we were all confounded and amaz'd; they had whip'd off two Pistols in our Consternation, which they clap'd to our Breasts. In this Confu∣sion,
<PB N="71" REF="149"/>
I had forgot mine that were at my Girdle, (or else we might have been hard enough for 'em;) neither did I re∣member 'em till they found 'em about me. They had shut the Cabbin Door on the Inside, till they had bound us, and ne∣ver minded Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> knocking and making a Noise, till they had secur'd us. Which done, they open'd the Door, and seiz'd him, who came to know what the Matter was, for we had no Candle in the Cabbin, and he hearing a Noise amongst us, thought we were seizing <HI>Hood,</HI> and call'd to us to forbear, (as he said af∣terwards) and make Haste, for he was going to tack about, tho' we did not hear him; on which he clap'd the Helm a Lee, and came down to fetch us out, to haul off the Sheets, &amp;c. and was seiz'd, and bound with us; for they left us immediately, being the Sails flutter'd in the Wind, by Reason she was veering round, when the Helm was a Lee.</P>
<P>After they had fix'd the Vessel, and it was broad Day, they came and unbound our Legs, and gave us Leave to walk upon Deck; whereupon I began to ex∣postulate
<PB N="72" REF="150"/>
with 'em, particularly Mr. <HI>War∣ren,</HI> being he seem'd to have a sort of Command over the others. Pray, says I to him, for what Reason have you seiz'd upon us, and bound us in this Man∣ner? Have we done you any Injury? Why, says he, Self-preservation; I found you were a going to do the like by us, therefore you are but serv'd in your Kind. And what do you design to do with us, now you have your Desire? Do with you! why, by and by we design to put you in the Boat, and turn you a-drift; but for that Son of a B—h, <HI>Hood,</HI> we'll murder him without Mercy; a Dog, to betray us! How, betray you! reply'd I? Yes! for I overheard All; then related the Manner of it as mention'd above. But as you have not so much injur'd us, we'll put you immediately in the Boat, with a Week's Provisions, and a small Sail, and you shall seek your Fortune, as I suppose you wou'd have done by us. No, answer'd I, we only design'd to con∣fine you till we came to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and there to have given you your Liberty to go where you had thought fit. Ay, ay,
<PB N="73" REF="151"/>
says <HI>Warren,</HI> shaking his Head, this is easily said, nor are we bound to believe you. Why, 'tis plain, said I, that our consulting to seize you, was but to pre∣vent what has happen'd. We are not to enquire into the Matter, answer'd <HI>War∣ren,</HI> and now we have you in our Pow∣er, we'll do as we think fit. Why then▪ says I, put us ashore at any Land that belongs to the <HI>English,</HI> and we shall think you have not done us any Injury. No, says he, we must go to meet our Captain and Fifty Men upon the Main Land of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> where our Vessel was stranded not to be gotten off. Our first Design when we were taken in our Boat, was to get us a Vessel to go a <HI>Buccaneer∣ing,</HI> which we had done at <HI>Campeche,</HI> if it had not been for the <HI>Indian</HI> that swam a Shore unknown to us, and brought Succours too soon; which we cou'd not avoid, the Sea Breeze blowing very strong all Night; so we seeing our Dan∣ger, were forc'd to form the Lie we told the Governour, which had some Appear∣ance of Truth, for we did not use any Vi∣olence to the two old <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being by
<PB N="74" REF="152"/>
good Words we thought to make 'em assisting to work our Bark back again to our Men. Now, pursu'd he, if you will all resolve to go a <HI>Buccaneering</HI> with us, we'll venture to carry you to our Cap∣tain and Men; if not, we'll do as we have propos'd. We looking one upon another, as if it were to know each o∣ther's Resolutions; he cry'd, nay, if you pause, you shan't have that Grace, if you desire it: Therefore prepare every Thing, pursu'd he, to one of his Companions, that they may be going, they won't be long before they come to their Journey's End.</P>
<P>When they had got every Thing ready, that is to say, a Barrel of Bisket, ano∣ther of Water, about half a Dozen Pie∣ces of Beef, and as much Pork, a small Kettle, and a Tinder-Box; we were bet∣ter provided than we expected, by much. Besides, they granted us Four Cutlasses, and a Fowling-Piece, with about Four Pound of Powder, and a sufficient Quan∣tity of Shot; together with all poor Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s Journals, after their perusing 'em, and finding 'em of no Use to them:
<PB N="75" REF="153"/>
When this was done, he order'd 'em to tie <HI>Hood</HI> to the Mast of the Vessel, and was charging a Pistol to shoot him thro▪ the Head, not considering it was charg'd before, for it was one of them I had at my Girdle, and which they took from me; but in his Eagerness and Heat of Passion did not mind it. We all intreated for the poor Fellow, and he himself fell upon his Knees, and beg'd with all the Eloquence he had, to spare him, and let him go with us; but <HI>Warren</HI> swore bitterly, nothing should save him. Says I, Mr. <HI>Warren,</HI> if you believe there is a Power that form'd this Globe, and sees every Action of Mankind, think what a Crime you commit by wounding of him, by murdering his Image: But if you're an Atheist, and believe in no Power Su∣pernatural, yet consider what a Conquest you will have gain'd over your self by overcoming this headstrong Passion. It may be your own Case another Time; and Murder you know is punish'd with Death. What the Devil have we got here, a preaching Puppy? Why, dost think that I mind thy ridiculous Cant!
<PB N="76" REF="154"/>
prithee mind thy own Business, and get thee gone, or perhaps I may begin with you, and send you to the Devil before your Time. With that, he cock'd his Pistol, and levell'd it at <HI>Hood;</HI> but firing, it split into several Pieces, and one struck <HI>Warren</HI> into the Skull so deep, that he was breathing his last upon Deck; one of the Bullets graz'd upon the Side of my Temple, and did but just break the Skin; as for <HI>Hood,</HI> he was not hurt; but with the Fright and Noise of the Pi∣stol, (as we suppos'd) labour'd with such an Agony of Spirit, that he broke the Cords that ty'd him by the Arms, tho' as thick as a Middle Finger, and fell down; but rose immediately, and not finding himself hurt, ran to us, and un∣bound our Arms, not perceiv'd by the other two, who were busy about unfortunate <HI>Warren;</HI> and tho' they were call'd to by him that steer'd, (who ran immediately to prevent it) yet they did not mind it, they were so concern'd about <HI>Warren.</HI> And before he that steer'd came, <HI>Hood</HI> had unbound me, and stop'd the Fellow <HI>(Meadows)</HI> by giving him a Blow with his
<PB N="77" REF="155"/>
Fist that knock'd him down. In the mean Time, I had unbound <HI>White, Mus∣grave</HI> and <HI>Middleton;</HI> and we went and seiz'd upon the other two <HI>Pyrates,</HI> for now we call'd 'em nothing else. After we had bound 'em in our Turn, we went to see what Assistance cou'd be given to <HI>Warren,</HI> where we found that a Piece of the Barrel of the Pistol had sunk into his Skull, and that he was just expiring; but yet, he sat upon his Breech with great Resolution; says he, I see you have overpower'd us, and I likewise see the Hand of Heav'n is in it. I now with Horror find (added he) that what you intimated to me about Heav'n, to be true; I see it more in this one Accident, than in all the Preachings of the Fathers. I was bred a <HI>Roman,</HI> had good Honest Parents, <HI>Romans,</HI> whose Steps, if I had follow'd, wou'd have made my Consci∣ence easy to me at this Time; but I for∣sook all Religion in general, and now too late, I find, that to dally with Heav'n is fooling ones self; but yet, in this one Moment of my Life, that's left, I hear∣tily repent of all my past Crimes, and
<PB N="78" REF="156"/>
rely upon the Saviour of the World, that dy'd for our Sins, to pardon mine. With that, he cross'd himself, and expir'd.</P>
<P>I must confess, I was very sorry for the unhappy Accident of his Death; but yet, glad that we were at Liberty; and was something easy that the poor Soul repented before his Expiration; not doubting but the piercing Eye of Provi∣dence, saw that if he had surviv'd, he would have liv'd a good Christian. And sure the Almighty's infinite Stock of Bounty, has enough Mercy to save the repenting Soul, tho' late before his Re∣pentance comes.</P>
<P>After we had secur'd our <HI>Tartars,</HI> we threw Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> Over-board, and bore up to the Wind; for after our first tack∣ing about in the Morning, when the Bu∣stle happen'd, they bore away with Tack at Cat-head, as being for their Purpose. The three Men that were left, desir'd us to let 'em have the Boat, and go seek their Companions; which we refus'd, as not having Hands enough to carry our Vessel to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> But we promis'd 'em, if they wou'd freely work in the Voyage,
<PB N="79" REF="157"/>
they shou'd have their intire Liberty to go where they thought fit, without any Complaints against them. Upon this, we began to be a little sociable as before, and they all declar'd, that what they did was by the Instigation of <HI>Warren.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day we discover'd a Ship to Windward of us, that bore down upon us with crowded Sails. We fill'd all the Sails we had, and endeavour'd to get a∣way from her as fast as we cou'd, but all to no Purpose; we saw they gain'd upon us every Moment, and therefore seeing it was not possible for us to escape, we back'd our Sails and laid by for 'em, that they might be more civil if they were Enemies. As soon as ever they came up with us, they hail'd us, and order'd us to come on Board, which we durst not deny; when Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> and I, with <HI>Hood</HI> and <HI>White</HI> for Rowers, went on Board 'em. We found by <HI>Hood</HI>'s knowing 'em, that they were his Cap∣tain and Comrades. Now, as <HI>Hood</HI> said, we did not know how we shou'd behave our selves, or what we shou'd say about <HI>Warren;</HI> but we only told the Captain
<PB N="80" REF="158"/>
how we met with his Men, and that they were redeem'd upon my Account. He never ask'd particularly for <HI>Warren,</HI> but how they All did; but when they sent on Board to search our Vessel, they soon came to the Truth on't; for the o∣ther three told 'em the Story, tho' not with aggravating Circumstances: Upon which, poor <HI>Hood</HI> was ty'd to their Main∣mast, lash'd with a Cat of Nine-Tails most abominably; and after that pic∣kled in Brine, which was more Pain than the Whipping; but it kept his Back from festering, which it might otherwise have done; because they flea the Skin off at every Stroke, and to prevent it, they wash it with Brine; which is call'd <HI>Whipping</HI> and <HI>Pickeling.</HI> After this they wou'd not keep him among 'em; but sent for the other three Men from our Vessel, and order'd us all on Board, with another of their Men that was ill of a dangerous Fever, which they fear'd might prove in∣fectious. They did not take any Thing from us, as we expected at first, only gave us this sick Man to look after, which we were very well contented with.
<PB N="81" REF="159"/>
So we parted with 'em very well satisfy'd, but much better when we were out of Sight, fearing they had forgot them∣selves, and wou'd send for us back, and take our Provision from us, or one Mis∣chief or another; for Pyrates do not often use to be so courteous.</P>
<P>Our sick Man mended apace, for we took great Care of him, and by keeping him low, only with Water-Gruel, his Fever left him; when I began to keep up his Spirits with my Cordials that I had by me, and in a Week's Time he was pretty hoddy, (as we call it at Sea). Now we began to converse with him, and he seem'd to be a sensible good∣humour'd Fellow.</P>
<P>Among other Discourse, we ask'd him how Captain <HI>M—ll</HI> and his Crew got a Ship? Says he, I can only tell the Story as I heard it; (for I was sick on Shore) which is as follows:</P>
<P>Sixteen of our Men got a <HI>Paragua</HI> from the <HI>Indians,</HI> who hate the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> tho' under their Subjection, and love the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> very well; these set out to seize upon the first Ship
<PB N="82" REF="160"/>
that they thought they cou'd compass; when after being five Days Cruising a∣long Shore, they spy'd a large Ship wea∣thering <HI>Cape Catoch;</HI> but believing it to be too strong for 'em, they resolv'd to work by Stratagem, thus: Twelve Men laid down in the Boat, as if very faint and weak, and made a Signal to the Ship, as if in Distress, who very charitably brought too; now they had no Arms with 'em, for when they resolv'd to use this Stratagem, they left 'em a-Shore, as making the Pretence more feasible; so that when they arriv'd at the Ship, they all went feebly up, as if not able to stand; nay, some were oblig'd to be led, forsooth, to colour the Matter the bet∣ter. They then told 'em that their Ship was cast away upon <HI>Logerhead</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> a∣bout three Leagues from <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> and saving themselves in their Boats, they got safe into the <HI>Cape;</HI> but that wan∣dering up in the Country, they were met by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who us'd 'em bar∣barously, killing Eleven of their Num∣ber; and wou'd have serv'd the rest so, if they had not made their Es∣cape
<PB N="83" REF="161"/>
in that <HI>Paragua;</HI> that they were so harrass'd for want of Food, having been without eating two Days, that they fear'd some of their Companions wou'd never recover.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> swallow'd the Bait, and their Captain being a very good Man, resolv'd to relieve 'em, and ask'd 'em what they wou'd have him to do for 'em? They beg'd him to land 'em on the first <HI>English</HI> Colony, or Island in their Way. He answer'd, he was bound for St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> but that he wou'd put in at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> tho' something out of his Way; yet, says he, I don't care for going to any of the noted Ports, because there is a War talk'd of between <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and tho' it was not pro∣claim'd they might meet with some Trou∣ble. They were mightily oblig'd to him, they said, but they did not know how to return the Obligation, but by praying for him and his.</P>
<P>They sail'd very lovingly with 'em for three or four Days, till at last For∣tune gave them an Opportunity to put their Enterprize in Execution. They
<PB N="84" REF="162"/>
had Notice that the Ship leak'd migh∣tily, and that the Water came into the Bread-Room; upon which, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went down to remove the Bread to get at the Leak, and did not leave more than five Men and the Captain above, whom they instantly seiz'd, and clap'd down the Hatches upon the rest. When they had se∣cur'd them, they arm'd themselves with Pistols and Launces, which were plac'd in the Steerage of the Ship, and so ca∣pitulated with 'em; but first, they steer'd their Course back again, that they might not lose any Time. As they came up, one by one, they bound them, till they were all so, but the Captain and the Pi∣lot: The Captain they confin'd to his Cabbin, with a Centry to guard him; but they let the Pilot go loose, that he might steer the Ship. O inhuman! cry'd I! thus the Snake in the friendly Bosom warm'd, turns and stings his kind Pro∣tector: Thus was their generous <HI>Host</HI> (if I may call him so) betray'd by his too much good Nature.</P>
<P>After they had brought the Ship safe to us, we embark'd, and put the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="163"/>
on Shore without a Morsel to help themselves; nay, if the <HI>Indians</HI> cou'd conveniently meet with 'em, they wou'd not leave one alive. I must con∣fess, pursu'd the Man, that the barbarous Story shock'd my very Nature, and made me hate their Society; and I re∣ally believe the Abhorrence of this curs'd Action brought my Distemper upon me.</P>
<P>How much are some Beasts Acknow∣ledgments of Kindness more than Man? A poor Cur, fed but with a Crust a Day, will follow still the bounteous Hand that gives it. Ingratitude is the Fountain of all other Crimes, for from thence flow all the rest. But all the Knowledge some Men are endow'd with, is but to find the best Way to deceive. How happy it would be, if such Creatures cou'd shake off their Humanity, and become Beasts in Form as well as Mind; then we shou'd have a Mark to shun 'em by. Our Creator has form'd all Kind of Beasts in Shapes that tell us what they are: But Men differ in their Natures more than Beasts, or are indeed under their Hu∣man Form, the very Natures of the Brute
<PB N="86" REF="164"/>
Creation. How many Villains, under a smooth Face and Tongue, betray their Bro∣thers? The Father cheats the Son, the Son the Father, Mothers squander the Dowry of their Daughters, and then prostitute 'em to gain 'em Bread; which is not Gain but Punishment: But Ingratitude, like Murder, meets with its Punishment on Earth, as well as in the other World; and an ungrateful Man shou'd have a Mark that all Human Society may shun him. I think the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> us'd to punish Ingratitude with Death, as a Crime equal to Sacriledge or Parricide.</P>
<P>After having taken all their Men on Board, (and leaving Directions on a Bark of a Tree, for the five Men that were gone upon the same Design ano∣ther Way;) we set sail, and had not been out two Days before we met with you. Pray, says I, how came you among 'em, if you lik'd not their Design? Why, Sir, answer'd he by Accident; Em∣barking from <HI>Bermudas,</HI> bound for St. <HI>Catherines,</HI> or the Isle of <HI>Providence,</HI> we were met by this Pyrate in a Ship of
<PB N="87" REF="165"/>
twenty Guns, and a hundred and twenty Men, who took us, and rumaging us, threaten'd to turn us a-drift without Pro∣vision, if we wou'd not embrace his De∣signs, which was Pyracy. We, rather than undergo what he threaten'd us with∣al, consented with our Tongues; but our Inclinations were far from it. And from our first being with him, we were plot∣ing to make our Escape the next Oppor∣tunity. But the other four (being but five in all in our Vessel) were unfortunate∣ly kill'd in that Engagement, where they lost their Ship. What Ship was it they fought with? Why, Sir, a Man of War of twenty six Guns, sent out on Purpose to take her; for the Captain had com∣mitted such Disorders where-ever he came, that he oblig'd the Governour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to send out the Ship call'd the <HI>Experiment,</HI> to cruise till she met with him; which she did about five Weeks a∣go. Our Captain, as soon as he saw her, guess'd at her Design, and resolv'd to fight her to the last; well knowing if he could take or sink her, he might be pretty secure to range where he pleas'd,
<PB N="88" REF="166"/>
there being never another Ship of War nearer than <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> who never came so far West. After he had made a Speech to his Men to encourage them to fight it out, and told 'em their Advantage, they consented to hoist the Bloody Flag, and neither to give or take Quarter. As soon as ever the Man of War saw our Bloody Flag out, they hoisted theirs, and there ensu'd a dreadful Fight. We began about two a-Clock, and fought till dark Night, without perceiving any Advantage on either Side; and then by Consent lay by till Morning without fighting; which we did so nigh, it being calm, that we cou'd talk to one another; but we did it only in threatning Lan∣guage. As soon as the Morning dawn'd, we went to it agen, with more Fury than before, for our People fought like despe∣rate Madmen, well knowing if they shou'd be taken, they must all die. The other Ship fought with a Bravery un∣common; but I believe the Advantage was on our Side, tho' we had kill'd on Board us thirty six Men.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="167"/>
We fought on till Noon, when we dis∣cover'd a Ship about three Leagues to Windward of us, which bore down upon us with all the Sail they cou'd. We soon conjectur'd, they cou'd be no Friends to us, so without much Consultation, we resolv'd to run it before the Wind, with all the Sail we cou'd make; as for the <HI>Experiment</HI> we fought with, we had put it out of their Power to follow us, being we had shot their Main-Mast by the Board, so that if the other overtook us we shou'd have but one to deal with. We by good Fortune had all our Masts firm, and we out-sail'd the other Vessel; but as soon as she came up with the <HI>Ex∣periment,</HI> (who never offer'd to follow us) she laid by, as we suppose to assist her, and we observ'd thro' our Telescopes that she had <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours out.</P>
<P>We soon lost Sight of 'em, and then we design'd to change our Course, but were prevented by the Men discovering two Foot Water in the Hold; who cou'd not find out the Leak, tho' they search'd with all the Dilligence they cou'd. So we were oblig'd to Pump, but all that
<PB N="90" REF="168"/>
we cou'd do, the Water still gain'd up∣on us, we resolv'd to bear away to <HI>Jucatan,</HI> a Province belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and seek out some conve∣nient Place unfrequented by them, where we might find out our Leak, and stop it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding our Labour in Pump∣ing, the Water gain'd upon us; so we put out our Long-Boat, and our Pinnace, in order to put in our Provision; which by Morning we effected, and very hap∣pily for us; for it was agreed upon all Hands, the Ship cou'd not swim above Eight Hours; and tho' we discover'd Land, and were not above six Leagues off Shore, yet we were afraid we cou'd not reach it, being the Ship was so hea∣vy with Water. So all that cou'd not swim were order'd into the two Boats, with their Arms; which held in 'em thir∣ty seven Men with Officers. They that were left on Board, had Orders to Pump as long as they cou'd, and run direct∣ly into Shore to the Leeward of <HI>Cape Catoch;</HI> but within half a League off the Place the Ship sunk, and the Men be∣took
<PB N="91" REF="169"/>
themselves to swiming, which we met with our Pinnace, and took up.</P>
<P>I cannot omit one barbarous Action of the Captain's. There was five Men wounded, who beg'd to be taken into the Boat, but the Captain refus'd 'em; and this was his Reason, as he gave to us in the Boat. Says he, those five that are wounded, will take up too much Room, being they can't sit as we do, but must lie along; and another Thing is, they will take more Time in looking after, than we can well spare. Besides, as I believe they won't recover, they will be the sooner out of their Pain; and if they shou'd recover, added he, they wou'd help us to devour our Provision, which we must take particular Care of, for we know not when we shall get more. I must confess, this Usage struck me to the Heart almost, especially as to one of 'em, who seem'd to have a Sense of his Condition, and repented of all his past Crimes.</P>
<P>After we were on Shore, we found that we had kill'd on Board us forty three Men, be∣sides the five that our Captain barbarous∣ly
<PB N="92" REF="170"/>
murder'd, by leaving 'em in the Ship when she sunk. Two of their Bodies were drove on Shore the next Day, but were order'd by the Captain to have Stones ty'd to their Feet, and carry'd off Shore and sunk. As soon as we had made us two Tents with Sails that were put in the Boat for that Purpose, they be∣gan to consult in what Manner they shou'd get a Ship; when one <HI>Warren</HI> pro∣pos'd to take the Boat, and four Men beside himself, with Arms, and a Week's Provision, for he wou'd not have any more, and go to the Bay of <HI>Campeache,</HI> or <HI>Campeche</HI> Town, where he did not fear getting a Vessel for their Purpose; being he said he had done so upon the like Occasion before. Whereupon the Boat and four Men were order'd for him; but he staying longer than the appoint∣ed Time, they thought some Mischance had happen'd to him, so took off their Thoughts of having any Vessel from him. One Day they spy'd a large <HI>Pa∣ragua</HI> coming towards Shore with Nine <HI>Indians,</HI> and two <HI>Spaniards</HI> in't, and finding it come so near, that they
<PB N="93" REF="171"/>
must of Course see 'em, they immediately resolv'd either to take or kill 'em all, for fear they shou'd discover 'em to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> before they had got a Vessel to go off again.</P>
<P>Tho' I must confess there was some Reason, yet I thought it barbarous to see how they murder'd the two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and nine <HI>Indians.</HI> They put out their Pinnace and ten Men well arm'd, to go and take this <HI>Paragua;</HI> as soon as ever they were discover'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they jump'd Over-board, and made towards Shore; but were shot by our Men, or knock'd on the Head with the Butt-End of their Musquets. The two <HI>Spaniards</HI> had a new Kind of Death; they ty'd 'em, Breast to Breast, and their Hands behind 'em, and threw 'em Over-board; where they struggl'd for some Time, and at last were drown'd. I thought this was a Cruelty exceeding all the Tyrants in the World, and if I had had a Boat, and our People never a one, I wou'd have run any Hazard to have sav'd 'em. Their <HI>Paragua</HI> was laden with Flower, and dry'd Fish, with several Sides of dry'd
<PB N="94" REF="172"/>
Pork, or Bacon; which was too good for the People that had it. As for my own Part, but little of it came to my Share, for I was taken ill the second Day after we came there, and so weak and feeble, that I did not expect to overcome it; and if it had not been for a Black, that was Trumpeter to the Captain, I shou'd have perish'd for want of Sustenance; but the poor Fellow frequently wou'd bring me something or other to nourish me; and it is to him, under God, that I owe my Life. He wou'd often tell me that he did not love that sort of Life, and wish'd he cou'd get rid of his Master; but, says he, if he did but know I had as much as a Thought that Way, he wou'd be the Death of me. I believe this was the only poor Fellow that pray'd in the whole Crew. He was christen'd at <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> (and had very good Notions of Religion) where he was giv∣en to his present Master, who had made several Voyages into the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> for a <HI>Plymouth</HI> Merchant; but at last find∣ing Matters on Shore go but indifferent∣ly, and having kill'd a <HI>French</HI> Officer
<PB N="95" REF="173"/>
there, seiz'd upon the Ship he us'd to Command, and with a Crew of despe∣rate Fellows made off to Sea, and steer'd his old Course for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and there commenc'd Pyrate; but had met with no other Success, than what has been related to you.</P>
<P>Says I, this Fellow's too wicked to have Success in any Thing, especially when Success must be an Addition to his Crimes: If it were possible to know his Fate, we shou'd find that he wou'd have some desperate End: For Men when a∣bandon'd by Providence Divine, tho' perhaps they may meet with some Success at first, at last find an End that's fitted for such Wretches, who de∣ny a Superior Being; and even Athe∣ists, notwithstanding their Human Form, are no better than Brutes; nay, I take an <HI>Atheist</HI> or <HI>Deist,</HI> to have far less Right to Salvation, than those <HI>Indians</HI> that pray to the Devil; for they do it thro' Ignorance, and Worship him with a more sincere Devotion, because they know 'tis in his Power to do 'em Harm. With what a fervent Zeal wou'd they
<PB N="96" REF="174"/>
serve the true God, if they knew (as all who profess Christianity do) that it is in his Power to bestow Blessings, even after this Life. With what Devotion they Worship the Sun, who they take to be the Superior Deity, because it makes the Earth green, and is the second Cause of all the Good they enjoy? Then, with how much more Reverence ought we to give Praise to that Power that lends Light and general Heat to that Planet? If an Atheist wou'd consider the Works of Nature justly, he would find it an Impossibility to be so any longer; and to fancy this World was form'd by Chance or Accident, is to allow Beasts the Privileges of Nature and Reason, to as great a Degree as we that pretend to Humanity.</P>
<P><HI>John Rouse</HI> was the Name of this Sail∣or we took on Board, born at <HI>Bermudas.</HI> He offer'd us some Proposals if we wou'd go along with him thither; but I de∣clin'd it, as wanting to be with my old Ship's Crew, and thought of seeing my own Country again, as I believe all Travellers have, who bring nothing
<PB N="97" REF="175"/>
Home but Misfortunes, or the Vices of the Places they have travel'd thro'. From this Man, said <HI>Rouse,</HI> I had the following short Description of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> or the <HI>Summer Islands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bermudas,</HI> (the Place of my Birth) or the <HI>Summer Islands,</HI> is suppos'd by some, to take its Name of <HI>Bermudas</HI> from cer∣tain Black Hogs that came out of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship that was cast away on those Shores. And by others from one <HI>John Bermudas,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the first Discover∣er of the Islands. The Name <HI>Summer Islands,</HI> is deriv'd from <HI>George Summers,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man, who suffer'd Shipwreck there. They are situated in thirty two Degrees, and twenty five Minutes of Northern Latitude; Sixteen Hundred Leagues from <HI>England;</HI> Twelve Hun∣dred from <HI>Madera;</HI> Four Hundred from <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> and about Three Hundred from <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI> The <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> had it first, and after them the <HI>French;</HI> but the Supplies that were sent 'em from <HI>France</HI> miscarrying by Ship∣wreck, they were oblig'd to abandon the Islands. After this, one <HI>Wing field,</HI> a
<PB N="98" REF="176"/>
Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> sent in two Ships, Captain <HI>Gosnel</HI> and <HI>Smith,</HI> with People to settle there; but there was not much done till 1612. when a Company was Establish'd at <HI>London</HI> by Letters Patents, given by King <HI>James</HI> the first, who im∣mediately sent Captain <HI>Moor</HI> with sixty five Men, where he was two Years in fortifying the Islands against the At∣tempts of any Invasion from either <HI>French, Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Indians.</HI> In the mean Time a sort of Rats so increas'd, that they de∣vour'd every Thing that was Green in the whole Island, and had like to have starv'd the Inhabitants, if Providence had not timely sent a Disease among 'em that consum'd 'em All. In about three Years after the first Plantation by Cap∣tain <HI>Moor,</HI> there was sent 'em another Supply of Men and Provision, by Cap∣tain <HI>Bartlet,</HI> who return'd with a Hun∣dred Weight of Ambergreese. The next Year, there arriv'd five hundred Men and Women, with Tradesmen of all Sorts. In 1616. one <HI>Tuckard</HI> succeeded in the Government, and was very serviceable to the Plantation, in bringing and plant∣ing
<PB N="99" REF="177"/>
several Trees, and Tobacco. He al∣so divided the Country into Acres, and parcell'd it out to the Tenants. It en∣creas'd daily in Culture and Inhabitants. The Form of the Islands as they lie, re∣sembles something of a Lobster with its Claws off. The Chief of the I∣slands is call'd <HI>George Island,</HI> and is di∣vided into Eight Parts, besides the Ge∣neral Land. 1. <HI>Hamilton Tribe;</HI> 2. <HI>Smith</HI>'s <HI>Tribe;</HI> 3. <HI>Devonshire Tribe;</HI> 4. <HI>Pembroke Tribe;</HI> 5. <HI>Paget</HI>'s <HI>Tribe;</HI> 6. <HI>Warwick Tribe;</HI> 7. <HI>Southampton Tribe;</HI> 8. <HI>Sandy</HI>'s <HI>Tribe.</HI> The Islands are all surrounded by Rocks, that at High-Water are dan∣gerous to Strangers. The Chief Har∣bours are <HI>Southampton, Harrinton,</HI> and the <HI>Great Sound.</HI> Upon St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Island,</HI> they have built several large and strong Forts, whose Chief are <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Dover</HI> Forts. The Soil in some Places is Sandy or Claye; and in other Places Ash-colour'd, White, and Black; about two Foot deep under the Ash, is found great Slates, which the Inhabitants make use of several Ways; and under that Black is found a Stony Substance▪
<PB N="100" REF="178"/>
something like a Spunge, or Pummice-Stone. The Wells, and Pits, Ebb and Flow with the Sea, yet produce excel∣lent fresh Water. The Sky is generally serene; but when 'tis o'er-cast they have dreadful Thunder and Lightning. The Air is much the same as with you in <HI>England.</HI> They have two Harvests in the Year: They Sow in <HI>March,</HI> and Reap in <HI>June;</HI> then they Sow in <HI>August,</HI> and Gather in <HI>January:</HI> And from that Month till <HI>May,</HI> the Whales frequently swim by them. They often find great Quanti∣ties of Ambergreece, and sometimes Pearl Oysters. No venomous Creature▪ will live in any of the said Islands. The yel∣low large Spiders have not the least Ve∣nom in 'em. There's Plenty of all Sorts of Cattle, both Wild and Tame, especially Hogs, who have mightily encreas'd since their first Landing; but they are not al∣together so fat as we could wish, feed∣ing only on Berries that fall from the Palmeto-Trees, which are very sweet. There's Plenty of Mulberies, both White and Red, which produce prodigious Numbers of Silk-Worms; who spin Silk

of the Colour of the Berry. The Trees are here of different Kinds; the Cedar is reckon'd the Largest in the Universe. The Leaves are downy, and prickly at the End: The Berries that it produceth are of a pale Red which inclose four White Kernels; the Outermost Skin is sweet; the Innermost that contains the Kernel, is sharp; and the Pulp is tartish. The Tree is always flourishing, being at the same Time full of Blossoms, green, and ripe Fruit. The Berries when ripe begin to gape, and fall off in Rainy Weather; leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which loses not its Rind till that Time two Years after. The Berry requires one Year before it comes to its full Ripe∣ness, which happens about <HI>December.</HI> The Boughs shoot upwards, and in a little Time are so heavy, that they weigh down the Body of the Tree. There are many Plants, as the Prickle Pear, Poyson Weed, Red Weed, Purging Bean, Red Pepper, and the Costive Tree, and the Sea Feather, which grows on the Brink of the Sea. There is another Plant call'd <HI>Nuchtly,</HI> which grows in
<PB N="102" REF="180"/>
the Niches of the Rocks, wash'd by the Waves of the Sea, and produces a Fruit like a Pear, which they call the <HI>Speckl'd Pear,</HI> from its Spots. For Fowls, we have all Sorts that <HI>England</HI> produces, besides a great Number of Cranes, larg∣er than any I have seen elsewhere; with a sort of Fowl that lives in Holes in the Rocks, like Rabbets. As for Tortoises, they are as good there as any where▪ They catch them in this Manner; they watch for 'em at Night, when they come on Shore to dig Holes to bury their Eggs in; while they are doing of it, they turn 'em on their Backs, and not being able to get upon their Legs again, they are easily taken. Some will have a Hundred Eggs in 'em about as big as a common Tennis-Ball, and very round; but a thin Skin, and the Yolk lies on the Side of the Skin, or Shell, and may be seen on the Out-side: These hidden in the Sand, are nourish'd by the Sun, and never minded by the Tortoise that lays 'em; and as soon as ever they have broke the Shell, they all run into the Sea. Some say they are full six Years a
<PB N="103" REF="181"/>
Hatching. They are excellent Meat, (for I can't call 'em Fish) and very nourishing, and we use the Oyl instead of Butter, which will keep longer, and is reckon'd much wholesomer for many Uses. Be∣sides, it is good to bathe, the Place that is stung by a little Insect, call'd <HI>Musket∣to.</HI> The Largest of these Islands, is <HI>Long Island;</HI> the next, St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Island;</HI> af∣ter that, <HI>Somerset,</HI> and St. <HI>David</HI>'s; next, <HI>Hibernia,</HI> or <HI>Ireland Island;</HI> then <HI>Long∣berd, Cooper</HI>'s, and <HI>Smith</HI>'s <HI>Island; Non∣such Gates;</HI> and the <HI>Brothers Island;</HI> with many others as well inhabited, and provided with every Thing for the Life of Man; which is elegantly describ'd by your <HI>English</HI> Poet, Mr. <HI>Edmund Waller.</HI></P>

<L>Nature these Cates with such a lavish Hand</L>

<L>Tastes of their Bounty, and does Cloth return,</L>

Chappels. In the Year 1616, five Sea∣men set sail from thence in an open Ves∣sel of about Three Tun, and after hav∣ing suffer'd several Storms and Tempests, were safely landed at <HI>Kingsale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made se∣veral Attempts upon those Islands; but always were drove away with considera∣ble Loss.</P>
<P>About a Month before I embark'd for this unfortunate Voyage, we took a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate, who was so insolent as to come into <HI>Harrinton</HI>'s <HI>Sound,</HI> even at Noon-Day, and cut the Cables of a Merchant-man, richly laden, bound for <HI>England;</HI> but by good Fortune run up∣on the Flats in the Mouth of the <HI>Sound,</HI> in going out again: So we had Time to Man some Boats with some of the Soldi∣ers of the Garrison, and send to their Relief, where there happen'd a desperate Fight for some Time; but more Forces going to the Assistance of the others, they took 'em after an obstinate Resist∣ance, killing twenty seven of their Men, and losing eleven of our own. The Captain made his Escape in his Boat,
<PB N="107" REF="185"/>
in the latter End of the Engagement, when he perceiv'd his Danger; but was o∣blig'd to go on Shore on <HI>Ireland Island</HI> for some Provision, where he, and four Men that were with him, were secur'd, and sent to <HI>Tucker</HI>'s <HI>Town;</HI> where they were to be try'd the Day I came a∣way.</P>
<P>Two Nights after we had parted with the Pyrate, we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm, that lasted two Days without abating; and out poor Bark, which was none of the best, was tumbl'd and toss'd like a Tennis-Ball, yet we receiv'd no Damage, but that she wou'd not answer the Helm; so that we were oblig'd to let her go before the Tempest, and trust to the Mercy of Heav'n for Relief. This Storm and the Danger we had escap'd from the Pyrate, put me in Mind of these four Lines of the foremention'd Poet, the celebrated <HI>Waller.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Bold were the Men, which on the Ocean first</L>
<L>Spread their new Sails, when Shipwreck was the Worst.</L>
<L>More Danger now from Man alone we find,</L>
<L>Than from the Rocks, the Billows or the Wind.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="108" REF="186"/>
We, in the Middle of the Storm dis∣cover'd Land right a Head, which put us all into our Pannicks; we endeavour'd to bring our Vessel to bear up to the Wind, but all to no Purpose; for she still drove nearer the Shore, where we disco∣ver'd several Tokens of a Shipwreck, as Pieces of broken Masts, and Barrels swiming on the Water, and a little far∣ther Mens Hats; then we began to think we shou'd certainly run the same Fate, when as soon as thought our Bark was drove on Shore, in a smooth sandy Bay, but where we had Opportunity to quit her, which was happy for us; for the Sea wash'd over her with such Violence, we had not any Hopes of her escaping the Storm, but thought of Course we shou'd be torn to Pieces.</P>
<P>When we were a-Shore, we all con∣cluded it cou'd be no other Part but the South of <HI>Cuba Island,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We were then in a terrible Fright, lest we were near any Part that belong'd to the <HI>Indians;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Mus∣grave</HI> assur'd me, that there were some Parts of the South▪Side of <HI>Cuba,</HI> that <HI>In∣dians</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="187"/>
dwelt in, in Spite of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and Massacre'd them where-ever they met 'em, or any other Whites. We lay all Night in terrible Fear, and tho' we found the Storm abated, or rather a Calm succeeded, yet we durst not stir till the Moon rose, and then we all walk'd towards our Vessel, which we found all on one Side; but by good For∣tune most of our Provisions was dry, which mightily rejoyc'd us; but all the Vessel's Riging and Masts were shatter'd and torn to Pieces, and some Part of her Quarter wrung off, that she cou'd not be of any Use to us if we cou'd have got her upright. But we took out all our Pro∣vision, and our Arms, with two Barrels of Gun-Powder that was dry, the rest being damag'd with Water and Sand that had got in. We had Arms enough, as having them that belong'd to the three Sailors that were taken in the Pyrate, which we suppos'd they had forgot; so we were six Men well arm'd, with each a Musquet, a Case of Pistols, and a Bay∣onet; beside two Cutlasses, if Need were.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="188"/>
By that Time we had taken every Thing out, Day approach'd, and then we design'd altogether, well arm'd, to go and view the Country. <HI>John Rouse</HI> was very well recover'd of his Fever, but a little weak, yet his Heart was as good as the Best of us. So we resolv'd if we were set upon by <HI>Indians,</HI> to defend our selves to the last Drop of Blood, chu∣sing rather to die by their Hands in Fight, than to be tortur'd after the Man∣ner as they inflict upon all the <HI>Whites</HI> they get into their Hands. But still we had some Hopes that we were too far to∣wards the Northward for 'em.</P>
<P>When we had plac'd our Provision and other Necessaries safe behind a Tuft of Trees that grew close by the Water Side, we fix'd our Arms, and ventur'd to walk up in the Country, which we did almost every Way that Day, four or five Miles; but cou'd not discover any Living Crea∣ture, nor any Sign of Inhabitants, only in one Place the Grass seem'd to be late∣ly troden, but whether by Man or Beast we cou'd not discover; so being pretty well tir'd, we went back again to our
<PB N="111" REF="189"/>
Station, where we eat heartily, and at Night we laid our selves upon the Grass, and fell asleep, for we durst not lie upon the Sails we had got for that Purpose, being they were not dry, tho' spread all Day long.</P>
<P>I was awaken'd the next Morning by a Company of <HI>Lizards</HI> creeping over me, which is an Animal frightful enough to look at, but very Harmless, and great Lovers of Mankind; they say, that these Creatures, if a Person lies asleep, and any voracious Beast, or the <HI>Al∣ligator,</HI> which comes on Shore often, is approaching the Place where you lie, will crawl to you as fast as they can, and with their forked Tongues tickle you till you awake, that you may avoid by their timely Notice the coming Danger. I got up, being rowz'd by these Ani∣mals, and look'd about me, but saw no∣thing but an odd Kind of a Snake about two Foot long, having a Head some∣thing like a Weesel, and Eyes fiery like a Cat's; as soon as it spy'd me it ran a∣way, and my Dog after it, but he did not kill it; but I believe put it in a ter∣rible
<PB N="112" REF="190"/>
Fright, for it made a Noise some∣thing like a Weesel, but louder, which awaken'd my Companions. When I told Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> what I had seen, he said it was a small Serpent, but not very hurt∣ful, call'd the <HI>Guabiniquinaze Serpent,</HI> from eating a little Creature of that Name, something resembling a small Mole; and the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> eat of 'em, and reckon 'em dainty Food.</P>
<P>We now resolv'd for another Walk, to discover what Inhabitants were our Neighbours, whether <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Spani∣ards;</HI> if <HI>Indians,</HI> we design'd to patch up our Boat, which had several Holes in't, and make off as fast as we cou'd, and Row Northward, till we came to some Place inhabited by <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But if we found the Latter, to beg Protecti∣on, and some Means to get to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> whereupon we ventur'd out with these Resolutions. We met with several fine large Cedar Trees, and one particularly so large, that Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> and I cou'd but just fathom it with our Hands joyn'd.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="191"/>
We had not gone far before my Dog be∣gan to bark, when turning my Head on one Side, I beheld a Black approaching towards us, and being startled at the Sight, I cock'd my Piece, and resolv'd to fire at him; but he call'd to me in <HI>English,</HI> and told me he did not come to do any Harm, but was a poor distress'd <HI>Englishman,</HI> that wanted Food, and was almost starv'd, having eat nothing but Wild Fruit for four Days. Upon that I let him come near, where he was soon known by Mr <HI>Rouse</HI> to be <HI>Willam Ply∣mouth,</HI> the Black that was Trumpeter to the Captain that commanded the Pyrate Ship. Upon his knowing him, we sat down and gave him some Provision, which we had brought with us, because we design'd to be out all Day.</P>
<P>After he had refresh'd himself a little, we ask'd him how he came into this I∣sland? Why, answer'd he, we were Crui∣sing about <HI>Cuba,</HI> in Hopes of some <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Prize, when a Storm arose and drove us upon a Rock, where our Ship was beat to Pieces, and not above Eighteen Men sav'd beside the Captain. And did
<PB N="114" REF="192"/>
that wicked Wretch escape the Ship∣wreck? Yes, answer'd <HI>Plymouth,</HI> but to undergo a more violent Death. For, says he, as soon as ever we landed, we wander'd up in the Country to see for some Food, without any Weapons but a few Cutlasses, having lost our first Arms; but however we all got something or other to defend our selves on Shore, as long Clubs, which we got from the Trees we found in our Walks; our Captain resolv'd if he met with any <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> Huts, that he wou'd murder all that he found in 'em, for fear they shou'd make their Escape, and bring more up∣on us. Thus he encourag'd his Men to follow him with their Clubs; says he, we will walk till we find fome beaten Path, and there lie hid till Night, when we may go on to some Houses, and come upon 'em undiscover'd; by which Means we may get Provision and other Arms: For the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Cuba</HI> use Fire-Arms as well as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and are full as dexte∣rous in using 'em as any <HI>Europeans,</HI> &amp;c. After travelling about ten Miles to the N. W. we discover'd a Path, upon which a Halt was commanded, and to retire in
<PB N="115" REF="193"/>
to the Woods again till Night; which we did, and din'd upon what Fruits we cou'd get upon the Trees.</P>
<P>About two Hours before Night a Dog smell'd us out, and running away from us, bark'd most furiously; upon that we were afraid of being discover'd, which Fear prov'd true; for in Half an Hour, or thereabouts, after the Dog left us, we were saluted with several Ar∣rows and Musquet-Shot, that kill'd us three Men, and wounded me in the Foot, but it prov'd the Means of saving my Life: For as soon as our Men perceiv'd what had happen'd, they ran as hard as they cou'd to meet the Danger, as knowing they cou'd do no Good till they came to Handy-Blows; I, in endeavouring to follow 'em, found my Hurt, which pre∣vented my keeping up with the rest; but I cou'd hear and see 'em at it: There was about Two Hundred <HI>Indians</HI> set up∣on our Men, and in about Half an Hour kill'd 'em every One. I saw the Cap∣tain lay about him desperately, but at last fell, being run thro' the Throat with a Wooden Stake. As soon as ever they had
<PB N="116" REF="194"/>
conquer'd 'em. or rather murder'd 'em, they fell to striping of 'em as fast as they cou'd, and carry'd 'em off, together with their own Dead, which were many, for the <HI>English</HI> sold their Lives very dearly.</P>
<P>After they were all gone, which I sound by their Screeming and Noise at a Distance, I ventur'd to steal out from be∣hind a Row of Bushes, where I had plac'd my self to see what had happen'd; I went to the Place of Battle, where I found two of our Men that they had left, with all their Arms, and some of their own; so I took up one of their best Musquets, and a Cutlass, and made far∣ther into the Wood, for fear of being caught; which I had certainly been, if I had staid a Quarter of an Hour longer, for I soon heard 'em come Hooping, Scream∣ing and Hollowing back, to fetch the o∣ther two Bodies, and their Arms, as I conjectur'd.</P>
<P>I walk'd as far as my hurt Foot wou'd let me that Night, and out of Danger of the <HI>Indians</HI> as I thought, and then lay'd me down to sleep as well as I cou'd, be∣ing
<PB N="117" REF="195"/>
very hungry, and sadly tir'd, and slept pretty well till Morning, when I proceeded forward in my painful Jour∣ney, and directed my Course N. E. think∣ing that was the best Way to avoid the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and probably to meet with some <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> whom I knew inhabited towards the North; the <HI>Havanna</HI> the Capital City of the whole Island being seated there. I wander'd for four Days, eating nothing but Fruit in the Woods; but laying my self down about an Hour ago, to rest my self a little, I thought I heard the Tongues of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> which to my great Joy prov'd true. I left my Mus∣quet behind the Bushes, for fear of a∣larming you; but now after returning God and you Thanks for this time∣ly Nourishment, I'll go and fetch it, which he did; and we might easily know it to be an <HI>Indian</HI> Piece, for they had rudely carv'd it all over with several Figures of Birds and Beasts.</P>
<P>Now, said I to my Companions, you see the Reward of Wickedness. He was not suf∣fer'd by Providence to go on long in his Crimes, tho' some are that are inur'd to Ills;
<PB N="118" REF="196"/>
yet they are overtaken at last, when their Crimes are full blown; for tho' Justice has Leaden Feet, yet they always find he has Iron Hands: And we too often see that he who kills his Adversary in a Du∣el, tho' he escape the Law, one time or other meets the same Fate himself.</P>
<P>After poor <HI>Plymouth</HI> had refresh'd him∣self, we set forward, and walk'd along till we came to a Road that seem'd to be a Main Road of the Island, by the Large∣ness. Here we consulted what we shou'd do, whether we shou'd go on, or return for more Provision; but we re∣solv'd to go a little Distance from the Road, for fear we shou'd meet with more of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and run the same Fate with the other <HI>Englishmen.</HI> But <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> told us, we were a great way from that Place where his Countrymen were kill'd; (for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> tho' born in <HI>Gui∣nea,</HI> wou'd always call himself an <HI>English∣man,</HI> as being brought over very young,) so we resolv'd one and all to venture.</P>
<P>We sent up our Prayers to the Almigh∣ty for our Safety, and went on with a Faith that we shou'd come off with Success;
<PB N="119" REF="197"/>
but we had not gone far when we heard the Reports of several Musquets, and shouting in a barbarous Manner, behind us. Looking that Way, we saw a <HI>Mu∣latto</HI> riding as fast as ever his Mule cou'd carry him; when he came up to us, he stop'd, and cry'd in <HI>Spanish,</HI> Make haste, run, for the <HI>Indians</HI> are coming upon you, they have kill'd several <HI>Spaniards</HI> already, and they are fighting with them. Mr. <HI>Mus∣grave,</HI> who understood <HI>Spanish</HI> very well, interpreted what he said to us; he ask'd him how far they were off? He answer'd just by, and hearing another Shout, put Spurs to his Mule, and left us in an In∣stant. We found by the Shouting and the Firing, that they wou'd be immedi∣ately upon us, so we retir'd out of the Road to let 'em pass, and laid down up∣on our Bellies that they might not dis∣cover us. Immediately came by about twenty <HI>Spaniards</HI> on Horseback, pursu'd by near a hundred <HI>Indians:</HI> Just as they came by us one <HI>Spaniard</HI> drop'd, and crept in∣to a Bush on the other Side of the Road; and presently the <HI>Indians</HI> follow'd, shout∣ing in a horrid Manner, and overtook
<PB N="120" REF="198"/>
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again, who being very swift on Foot, out-run an ordinary Horse; and they had thrown away their Fire-Arms, to make them the lighter to run, as we suppos'd. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew they wou'd soon overtake 'em, so only run to charge their Pistols, and stand till they came up; then discharge 'em, to put 'em in Confusion; and run again, to prolong the time, in Hopes of some Aid. All this we un∣derstood by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that crept into the Bush undiscover'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> by Reason of the Horses Feet, and the Dust to∣gether, he being the Foremost in Flight. He told us moreover that about three Leagues farther, there was a Fort belonging to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to stop the <HI>Indians,</HI> they using to make Inroads before that Fort was built, even to the Gates of the Ci∣ty <HI>Havanna.</HI> Upon this we consulted and resolv'd to follow, upon the Edge of the Road, to see how we cou'd be as∣sisting; we soon came even with 'em, for they were in a narrow Place, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> kept 'em at Bay pretty well; by good Fortune there was a high Hedge made by Trees all along as we went,
<PB N="121" REF="199"/>
which hinder'd us from being discover'd. Here we resolv'd to fire upon 'em all to∣gether, and then run further up, and if possible get out into the Road and face 'em. Accordingly we agreed to fire four, and three, and the first four to charge again immediately. Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> Mr. <HI>White</HI> and my self agreed to fire first; then <HI>Hood, Rouse</HI> and <HI>Ply∣mouth;</HI> which as soon as we had taken good Aim we did, and firing at their Backs, kill'd four downright, and wound∣ed several, for I had order'd 'em to put two Bullets into each Piece. As soon as ever we had fir'd our Musquets, we let fly one Pistol each, and then the o∣ther three fir'd their Guns. As soon as <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> had fir'd, he ran and charg'd our four Guns, (he having never a Pistol) and then we let fly our other Pistols. With these Discharges we had kill'd at least fifteen <HI>Indians,</HI> and put the rest in∣to such Frights that they began to run; (for with the Dust and Bustle they made, they cou'd hardly distinguish from whence the Fire came) neither did they stop till they met with the poor wounded <HI>Spani∣ard,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="200"/>
who had crept out, hearing the Discharge of our Pieces, (as we suppos'd) they fell upon the poor Fellow with Shouts and Outcries, and tore him to pieces, never minding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pur∣suing 'em; who cry'd <HI>Miracalo! Miraca∣lo!</HI> a Miracle! a Miracle! By this Time we got within twenty Yards of the End of the Hedge, where we Seven fir'd our Musquets, and left 'em to <HI>Plymouth</HI> to charge; then we ran in upon 'em with our Pistols, and discharg'd 'em close upon 'em. With this last Fire we drop'd 'em twelve Men, and they scream'd out, and ran away as fast as they cou'd. We did not think fit to follow 'em, for it was not to any Purpose, being they were soon out of Sight. We charg'd our Guns and Pi∣stols again, and the twelve <HI>Spaniards</HI> did the like, they having Nine in the last Conflict kill'd, and two desperately wounded. They gave us Thanks for our Rescue, and said we were surely sent from Heav'n to their Relief; they let us know they were Tax-gatherers for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and were oblig'd to go in Numbers, and well arm'd, for fear of
<PB N="123" REF="201"/>
these desperate <HI>Indians;</HI> who, about nine Years ago, set upon 'em and kill'd Eigh∣teen of 'em, and but two escap'd; but never met with any Molestation from that Time till now; so that this Time (thinking the Danger over) we lessen'd our Number from Fifty to Thirty, which I suppose the <HI>Indians</HI> having Notice of, was the Occasion of their setting upon us. They said it was to no Pur∣pose for to go back, for the rest of their Companions that were kill'd, which being a Mile of, they had taken with 'em.</P>
<P>We had not gone above half a League onward, but we heard dreadful Shout∣ings as before, and looking behind us, it being a strait Road, we cou'd perceive a Cloud of Dust, and the <HI>Indians</HI> running full Speed towards us. Upon which, we put down our two wounded Men that were on Horseback, and mounted upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> spare Horses. Now we being nineteen Horsemen, resolv'd to stand it: We divided into Ranks, four in a Rank, which made five Ranks; only there was but three in the last Rank. So we resolv'd to keep directly one behind the other, and when the first File had
<PB N="124" REF="202"/>
fir'd to fall in the Rear, and charge a∣gain. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wou'd make up the three first Ranks, as they said they cou'd not in Honour expose us to the first On∣set, being we ventur'd our Lives in com∣ing to their Assistance. We had no Time to dispute for now they were just upon us, and to our Surprize had several Fire Arms among 'em. As soon as they got within a Hundred Paces of us they fir'd, but not above two of their Pieces went off, the rest were clog'd with Dust in running, that very happily for us hin∣der'd their Discharging. The Shot miss'd us by Providence, and we wou'd not give 'em Time to charge again, but we mov'd forward and fir'd in upon 'em, and did great Execution; when it came to our Turn to fire, we in the Heat forgot our Orders, but after we had discharg'd our Guns and Pistols, we fell in with 'em with our Cutlasses, and being rais'd a∣bove 'em by being on Horseback, did great Execution; and that with the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> charging and firing again, put 'em to the Rout; but now we follow'd 'em being on Horseback, and dispers'd 'em
<PB N="125" REF="203"/>
so that it was impossible for 'em to rally any more that Night. However we took four of 'em Prisoners, and tying their Hands behind 'em, fasten'd 'em to two of our foremost Horses, the rest following after, that they might not get Loose.</P>
<P>We were met in the Road by twenty <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, with each a Foot-Soldier behind 'em, who were upon the full Gal∣lop to our Assistance, being alarm'd by the <HI>Mulatto</HI> that rode by; but I believe some were glad they came too late. The Officer and the rest saluted us very courteously, when they heard how lucki∣ly we came to their Assistance; but fell a whipping the poor naked <HI>Indians</HI> so barbarously, that tho' they deserv'd it, I cou'd not bear to see it done in cold Blood, and tho' the Blood follow'd every Lash, yet they never cry'd out. This is the chief Cause of the Hatred of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when ever the <HI>Spaniards</HI> get any of 'em in their Power, they put 'em to all man∣ner of Torture; but if, on the contrary, they would use 'em civilly, and dis∣charge 'em now and then, I am sure they might live in perfect Friendship with 'em:
<PB N="126" REF="204"/>
For the <HI>Indians</HI> are good-natur'd, loving and affable, till they are incens'd, and then they are implacable.</P>
<P>We arriv'd at the Fort about Evening, and were very well entertain'd. The Officer did not doubt but to procure us a Ship▪ to transport us to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> tho' they had Orders from <HI>Havanna</HI> to secure all <HI>English</HI> Vessels, there being a War talk'd of between the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The next Day the Officer mightily brag'd of being an old <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that is, born in <HI>Spain,</HI> and of an ancient Family; and Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> made us very merry upon the Road, in interpreting the Don's Speeches. We found all along from the Fort, a great many Gentlemens Houses pleasantly situ∣ated, and the Country all along yield∣ing delightful Prospects.</P>
<P>We were well entertain'd at a Gentle∣man's House at Dinner, with Provisions dress'd after the <HI>English</HI> Way, and all manner of Sweetmeats and cool Wines. The Gentleman had a Vault or Cellar thirty Foot deep under Ground. He spoke pretty good <HI>English,</HI> and had been
<PB N="127" REF="205"/>
a Factor several Years in <HI>London,</HI> and knew our Customs and Manners very well, and prefer'd our Way of dressing Victuals before their own. He had an <HI>English</HI> Cook from a <HI>Tavern</HI> behind the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> that he brought with him into <HI>Spain,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cuba,</HI> where he had a vast Estate left him. His Cook's Name was <HI>Hodges,</HI> a good understanding Fellow, and made very much of us, and wou'd fain have had us to stay with his Master longer. But as soon as we had din'd, we were oblig'd to get on Horseback, and away for the <HI>Havanna,</HI> which we reach'd about six a-Clock in the Evening. We had Rooms alloted us, and several <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Men came to see us, that liv'd there.</P>
<P><HI>Havanna</HI> is the Capital City of the whole Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and has as great a Trade as any Place belonging to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> It has one of the finest Harbours in the Universe, not for its Greatness, but its Security, yet able to contain five hundred Ships of the greatest Burthen. The Mouth of
<PB N="128" REF="206"/>
the Harbour is commanded by a Plat∣form, and a square Fort, fasten'd toge∣ther by a strong Boom, or Iron Chain, that no Ship can enter. The most shal∣low Part of the whole Harbour, is eight Fathom Water, and all its Banks is pav'd round with flat Stone, so that a Vessel of a Thousand Tun may lay her Side to it and unlade. Just between the two Forts there stands a round Water Tower, where they discover to the Town how many Vessels are coming towards the Harbour by putting out a Flag for eve∣ry Ship. This Place is the best fortify'd and garrison'd in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> to secure the Plate Fleet, and all other Ships that meet here, to set Sail altogether for <HI>Spain.</HI> This City is very large, near as big as <HI>Bristol</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the Hou∣ses are handsomely built, but after the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fashion. There are Two hand∣some Churches, fine, and well built, with Spires, and an Organ in each, be∣sides several Chappels; and a Foundati∣en laid for a third Church while we were there. This City almost as soon as it was built, was sack'd by a <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="207"/>
Pyrate in the Year 1536, who was dri∣ven thither by a Tempest, and landing his Men well arm'd, took the City in Spite of all their Resistance, and burnt many of the Houses, they being most part Wood; and had consum'd 'em all, had not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> redeem'd the rest by paying 'em a Thousand Ducats. Upon the receiving of the Money, they made out to Sea, and the same Evening came into the <HI>Havanna</HI> three Ships from <HI>Spain,</HI> who hearing of what had chanc'd, prepar'd to follow 'em, taking several Soldiers on Board 'em; the Admiral, who sail'd best, got the first Sight of the <HI>Frenchman;</HI> but being fearful to attack him before the other Ships came up, lay by. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> seeing that, boldly set upon the first Ship, and took her without fighting; the second, seeing that, tack'd about, and ran a-Shore, which was taken by the Ship's Boat; the third also run the same Fate. Flush'd with this Success, they return'd to the <HI>Havan∣na</HI> the second time, and exacted a Thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> more, or else they threaten'd to level the City with the Ground, which
<PB N="130" REF="208"/>
was paid 'em immediately. Then they took their last Leave, with this rich Booty, and sail'd for <HI>Rochel</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where they shar'd their Prizes. After this they built their Houses with Stone, as they are now, which nevertheless the <HI>English</HI> took about twelve Years af∣ter.</P>
<P>There are many fair Harbours besides the <HI>Havanna,</HI> in <HI>Cuba,</HI> as that of St. <HI>Jago</HI> City and Harbour, which is a handsome Place, seated on the South of the Island, and is also a Bishop's See under the Archbishoprick of St. <HI>Domin∣go.</HI> Three Leagues from St. <HI>Jago</HI> lies those famous Copper Mountains, call'd by the <HI>Spaniards, Sierra de Cobre.</HI> There's another Town and Harbour situated on the Eastern Part of <HI>Cuba,</HI> call'd <HI>Baracoa,</HI> where they gather the best Ebony of all the <HI>Indies.</HI> There's many other good ones, as St. <HI>Salvador, Trinedad, Puerto del Principe,</HI> which has a Fountain near it, that some times of the Year produces Liquid Pitch.</P>
<P><HI>Cuba</HI> was formerly divided into Eight Provinces and Governments, and better
<PB N="131" REF="209"/>
Peopl'd than any other Island in <HI>America,</HI> before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> invaded 'em; but now there are but few <HI>Indians,</HI> which inhabit several Parts of the Island unmo∣lested by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but the Natives can never forget their Barbarity, which they have by Tradition from Father to Son. Nay, I have been inform'd that they keep a solemn Festival once a Year, which was the Time that the Massacre of the <HI>Indians</HI> happen'd; and if they can get any <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they sacrifice 'em to satisfy <HI>the Manes</HI> of their dead Ance∣stors.</P>
<P><HI>Hugh Linscoten,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Voyager, relates that a <HI>Cassick,</HI> or one of the Lords of a Province, caught a <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> at their first Landing, and threw him into a River, to see if he wou'd drown, which he did, and that satisfy'd him they were not Immortal. Whereupon he encourag'd his Men, and repuls'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> several times with great Loss; but at last run the same Fate with the rest of the Natives. 'Tis reported that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first and last had massa∣creed Sixty Thousand <HI>Indians</HI> in the I∣sland of <HI>Cuba.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="210"/>
<HI>La Casas,</HI> a Bishop in <HI>New Spain,</HI> that wrote the History of the <HI>Indies,</HI> tells us this Story of another <HI>Cassick,</HI> that was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Cu∣ba,</HI> and condemn'd to be burnt alive with green Wood, that his Torture might be the longer and more exquisite. While he was ty'd to the Stake, before the Fire was lighted, a Fryar that was pre∣sent preach'd to him the Truth of the Christian Religion, and that all who dy'd in that Faith, and trusted in God that form'd the Earth, and all the Creatures therein, shou'd immediately after their Purgation, ascend into Hea∣ven, the Residence of our Creator, there to converse with Angels, and such as dy'd in that Faith; but on the contrary, if they persisted in Ignorance, and dy'd in a contrary Opinion, they should de∣scend into Hell, and live in an Eternity of Torments. Upon this, the <HI>Cassick</HI> ask'd him if there were any <HI>Spaniards</HI> in Heav'n? And being answer'd there were many; Then says the <HI>Cassick,</HI> let me go to Hell, for I wou'd rather converse with those you call <HI>Devils,</HI> than you
<PB N="133" REF="211"/>
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in Heaven; for I am sure you are far the Worst of Devils, and take Delight in nothing but tormenting us. Tho' the Fryar's Preaching was certainly true, yet Men of any Reason must con∣clude, that no Religion can be propa∣gated by Cruelty and the Sword, which was always the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Method with the <HI>Indians,</HI> where-ever they came; and all their Excuse was, that if they had not us'd them in that Manner, they cou'd never have made their Conquests, being they were forc'd to lessen 'em, for fear their Numbers might overpower 'em; so that in short, as <HI>Dryden</HI> says in his Conquest of <HI>Mexico</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards, You threaten Peace, but you invite a War.</HI></P>
<P>I met here with a Priest, that I am sure harbour'd nothing of Cruelty in his Breast, for he came to see us every Day, and in such a friendly Manner, that charm'd us all. He was always sending us one good Thing or other, and wou'd take us to divert us Abroad. He understood <HI>Latin</HI> very well, and some <HI>English.</HI> On the <HI>Sunday</HI> he preach'd an excellent Ser∣mon in <HI>Spanish,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> in∣form'd
<PB N="134" REF="212"/>
us, whose Chief Heads ran upon us; and to excite Charity in his Audi∣tors, to let us have what was necessary in carrying us to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> The next Day he brought us to the Value of Fifty Pound in <HI>Spanish</HI> Dollars, which were collected at the Church Doors for us. There was a small Vessel of about Forty Tun upon the Stocks, that was bought of the Owners for us, and a Collection made in the Town for Mo∣ney to pay for it. We told 'em of the Provision we had left on Shore, which by our Computation cou'd not be above twenty Leagues off; but they told us it would be difficult to find it. One Day a <HI>Spaniard</HI> met us walking with Father <HI>An∣tonio</HI> in one of the Cloysters of the Con∣vent, and reprimanded him for favour∣ing <HI>Hereticks</HI> (as he call'd us) so much. He thought none of us understood <HI>Spa∣nish,</HI> so was more free in his Conversation. Says Father <HI>Antonio,</HI> we ought to use Charity even to Brute Beasts, and much more to our Fellow Creatures, who wear with us our Creator's Image; I wou'd not be thought to make a
<PB N="135" REF="213"/>
Schism in our Religion, which I am sure is the holiest and most pure; but yet I cannot consent in my Thoughts, that All who are out of the Pale of our Church must suffer Damna∣tion; it wou'd be horrid to think it, and would take away from the Lustre of our Opinion, which shines so brightly. If they are in any Errors concerning their Belief, God, in whose Breast it lies, can open their Eyes when he thinks fit that they may see those Er∣rors. Then added the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> with the same Reason you may say the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> and Natives may still remain in Ignorance, till Heaven shall think sit to open their Eyes, as you say; and if so, the <HI>Missionary</HI> Fathers may spare their Trouble. No, reply'd the Father, We are there appointed by Pro∣vidence to bring 'em out of the Cloud that dims their Sight. But of People that own Christ, and serve the same God with us, who differ but in a few outward Forms of Worship, it is very hard to believe that those instructed in that Worship, must inevitably sink into
<PB N="136" REF="214"/>
Damnation. I can't tell what the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>'s Thoughts were upon this Dis∣course, but I am sure he was more cha∣ritable than before, for he pull'd out of his Purse a <HI>Moidore,</HI> and gave Father <HI>Antonio</HI> for our Use, which it seems he had refus'd to do, when he went about collecting for us. After he was gone, he told us his Discourse, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> and what he cou'd not make out in <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> clear'd to us from the other's telling him in <HI>Spanish</HI> what he meant.</P>

We had all sorts of Provision sent on Board for half a Year, or more, so that we only stay'd for the Wind to rise, it being quite calm.</P>
<P>While we stay'd there, the four unfor∣tunate <HI>Indians</HI> were to be executed in the midst of the <HI>Parade.</HI> They were first to be drag'd by four Horses, naked, along the great Street to the <HI>Parade,</HI> and then to be chain'd to a Post, fix'd for that Purpose, and burnt to Death: I must confess, when I saw with what barbarous Cruelty they design'd to use 'em, I repented my being an Instru∣ment in the taking of 'em. This Execu∣tion was order'd to be between seven and eight in the Evening, being then it was coolest: All the <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves that serv'd <HI>Spanish</HI> Masters in the Town, were order∣ed to go and be Spectators of the Trage∣dy, that they might see what they must expect, if they ever offer'd to Rebel in the like manner. When the Time came, the whole Street was crowded with a vast Number of People of all Conditions. But such a Sight I never desire to see again, each <HI>Indian</HI> was ty'd by the Feet to the Harnass of the Horse, and so drag'd from

the Prison to the Place of Execution up∣on the bare Stones naked, their Arms tied upon their Breasts, and fasten'd upon their Backs, that they might not lift 'em up to save themselves as they were dragg'd along the Stones; but by that time the poor Creatures came to the <HI>Pa∣rade,</HI> their Skin of their Legs, Thighs, and Back, were almost strip'd off, yet with∣out the least Complaint; As soon as they were ty'd fast to the Stake, they took from a Pot of Liquid Pitch, boiling hot, a Stick with something fasten'd to the End on't, and rub'd over their naked Bodies. One of them then, I observ'd, began to faint, but was rated by another of his Fellow Sufferers in their own Language, which none understood but <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Fellow seem'd to bear it much better. Before the Fire was put to the Pile, a Fryer step'd up to them, and in <HI>Spanish</HI> spoke to the <HI>Indian</HI> that was ready to faint before, who had been Servant in the Town, but run away from his Master, and under∣stood <HI>Spanish.</HI> The Fryer desir'd 'em, if they would be happy in the other World, to acknowledge themselves Christians, and
<PB N="4" REF="218"/>
go out of the World in that Faith. Up∣on this the <HI>Indian</HI> answer'd, <Q REND="margQuotes">When I li∣ved among you (said he) and was taught to worship your God, you told me he was an upright God, and a just God to them that serv'd him Faithfully, but an avenging Power to those that once Of∣fended him: If so, how comes it to pass that he has not punish'd you for all your Crimes. You have taught me, that Whoring and Adultery were Sins not to be Par∣don'd, and yet you commit those Sins, as if you were in no fear of any Pu∣nishment. Murder is one of your Com∣mandments not to be forgiven, when at the same Time you'll hire a Bravo to kill a Stranger that looks but wantonly on your Wives. In short, I know not any one thing that I have heard preach'd to us poor <HI>Indians,</HI> that you practise your selves. Therefore if your <HI>Spanish</HI> God be as you describ'd him to us, the Curse must fall upon you if we can't believe in him, being we are deter'd by the Cruelties you inflict upon us in ser∣ving him as you would have us, when we find your Actions and Words differ
<PB N="5" REF="219"/>
more than our Complexions. You preach up Holiness, and Righteousness, but you Practise Debauchery and Lewdness.</Q></P>
<P>He said more, which was to excite the <HI>Indians</HI> to Rebel, but they put a stop to it, by putting Fire to the Wood, which being compos'd of several Combustible Matters, soon consum'd the poor Wretches.</P>
<P>When all was over, Father <HI>Antonio</HI> took us home to his Lodgings, to give us a small Collation for the last time, being the next Day, we did All design to lie on Board, in Expectation of the Winds rising. We told him by Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> That we thought it a great Weakness in them to preach in that manner, to <HI>Indians</HI> in their Condition, and it would be apt to make others despise their Religion; says Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> it is like courting a Woman to Love by Stripes; (pardon the Comparison) Why, says Father <HI>Antonio,</HI> I must confess it is not what any of our Fathers like, but it is what we are order'd to do, and therefore must not be deny'd. Besides at first, it was a piece of barbarous Policy in the first Conquerors of the <HI>Indies,</HI> they would order the Missionaries to preach to
<PB N="6" REF="220"/>
all <HI>Indian</HI> Criminals, but out of hearing of any Spectators; so as soon as they were executed, they would declare to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they died Christians, and were happy. Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> ask'd him, What made them use 'em so inhumanely, was it not enough that they suffer'd Death, but must be tortur'd in that bar∣barous Manner? He replied, It was done to terrifie the other <HI>Indians</HI> from any Vio∣lence. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> answer'd, That was certainly wrong, for as they are an implacable sort of People, and have hand∣ed down to them from Father to Son, the first Massacre, tho' almost Two hun∣dred Years ago, they must needs remem∣ber, these Cruelties of so fresh a Date, which revives in their Memories the for∣mer, if they had any Mind to forget 'em: He could not say much to it, he said, but evaded the Discourse, by bidding us be merry, that is innocently and disoffen∣sively so, for he did not allow of Dis∣orders in any one; so we refresh'd our selves, and took our Leaves of the good Father, who Bless'd, and Embrac'd us, and said he would pray to Heaven for
<PB N="7" REF="221"/>
our prosperous Voyage: So on the next Day, we paid our hearty Acknowledg∣ments to all our Benefactors, and went on Board; where we had not been a Quarter of an Hour, before an extraordinary Mes∣sage came from the Governor for <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> our Black, who went with them without any Hesitation, and return'd with a Present from the Governor, of several Bottles of Rack, <HI>Spanish</HI> Wines, Fowls, Rice, and Brandy, with twenty Pieces of <HI>Spanish</HI> Gold, as the Messenger told us, in Recompense for the Loss of one of our Companions; for the Governor had sent for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to know if he would serve him in Quality of his Trumpeter, and he would settle a Pension upon him for Life. <HI>Plymouth</HI> thought fit to accept of it, as ha∣ving no Master, nor knowing when he should have one: But he got leave to come on Board to bid us farewel which he did in a very Affectionate manner. I bid him have a care to please the <HI>Gover∣nor,</HI> and then he need not fear doing well; so we parted with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with our hearty Thanks recommended to Fa∣ther <HI>Antonio</HI> for all his Favours. <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="222"/>
had a Trumpet given him by the Governor, as soon as he came on shore, which he brought with him, and sounded all the Way in the Boat, as he went back again to oblige us; for really he sounded extraordinary well, and had learnt on se∣veral other Instruments, having a tolera∣ble Understanding in Musick. We were sorry to part with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as being a faithful honest Fellow, yet glad he had got so good a Master. The Wind rising, we weigh'd Anchor, and left the Port with three Huzza's and a Volley of Small Arms, (we having no Cannon) and in two Days lost Sight of the Island <HI>Cuba.</HI></P>
<P>This famous Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> which was first call'd <HI>Joanna</HI> by <HI>Columbus</HI> the first Discoverer, afterwards <HI>Fernandina,</HI> then <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> as being the First and Last Island the <HI>Spaniards</HI> touch'd at: But afterwards was call'd <HI>Cuba,</HI> and still re∣tains that Name. This is reckon'd one of the Four Islands of the <HI>Barlovento.</HI> The others are <HI>Hispaniolo, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Porto-Rico.</HI> The North Side of <HI>Cuba</HI> is fortifi∣ed with a vast Number of small Islands, call'd the <HI>Lucaies,</HI> which some Geogra∣phers
<PB N="9" REF="223"/>
have taken for a Part of the main Land. The chief is <HI>Bahama,</HI> which forms the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> the Passage that all Ships go through, when they come out of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cuba</HI> has on the North, <HI>Jucatan,</HI> a Pro∣vince on the main Land, distant about 50 Leagues, and on the South <HI>Jamaica,</HI> about 40 Leagues: In length 220, and in the broadest Part about 56. The Soil in most Parts, that are inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is Fruitful, and much more Healthy than <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> The Tobacco is reckon'd the best in the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI> I have seen very large Vines there, which bear excellent Grapes, but not fit to make Wine; many have tried, but it turns sour in a few Days. And for Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, it comes up to, if not exceeds any of the other Islands. The Bird <HI>Flamingo</HI> is a Fowl something bigger than our ordinary Geese, but Legs and Neck twice as long, and all over red, and generally go in a Body at a Distance, they look like a Company of Soldiers march∣ing. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a Proverb here, That the Time will come that <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="224"/>
Men will walk as freely in their Streets, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do now; if it were so, it would be of a prodigious Advan∣tage to the <HI>English,</HI> being the <HI>Havana</HI> is a Strait that Commands all the Ships that come out of the <HI>Indies</HI> for <HI>Europe,</HI> and I really think from what I have seen, that it would be in the Power of Ten thousand Men, with a Fleet proportionable, to o∣vercome the whole Island in a little Time. Besides it is observ'd, that there are more Prizes brought into the <HI>Havana,</HI> than any four Havens in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>While we were at the <HI>Havana,</HI> a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> carried two strange Beasts about the Streets for a Show, that he brought from <HI>Brazil,</HI> the one was call'd <HI>Ai,</HI> with a Head something resembling that of a Man's, and cover'd with rough short gray Hair: Each Foot has three Claws close together, about a Finger long, very sharp Teeth, with a smooth high black Nose, very small sleepy Eyes, and no Ears, with a Tail small above, and broad at the Bottom, with Hair all over the Body of an Ash colour. This Beast is about the Size of a large Fox, but so lazy a Crea∣ture, that when it gets up a Tree, it ne∣ver
<PB N="11" REF="225"/>
comes down▪till it has devour'd every Leaf, and when it has done, it will sit there twenty Days together without eat∣ing, and almost starv'd before it will take the pains to go down to feed. It can't travel or creep in a whole Day not above a Quar∣ter of a Mile. This that was shown to us, never would stir till rouz'd with a stick, and it would be asleep again in an Instant.</P>
<P>The other Creature was something like a <HI>Baboon,</HI> but considerably larger, with a Face and long Beard, like an old Man's, and hairy like a Goat, all over the Body; his Ears bald, his Eyes black, large and Sparkling. He that show'd it to us, call'd it a <HI>Cayon,</HI> its Tail is about four or five Foot long, which they twist round a Tree, and so fling themselves to the next. They are very Fierce and Subtile, and when Wounded, will set upon their Adversary without any Fear; and if forc'd to climb the Trees, they carry their Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travel∣lers as they pass by; and when wounded, they set up a shriek, that immediately brings all of their Kind, within Hearing, to their Succour, who stop the Wound
<PB N="12" REF="226"/>
with Leaves and Moss, which will soon be heal'd. This that we saw was brought up very young by the Person that had him, and would play many comical Tricks; As he was shown to us, he urin'd in his Paw and threw it in our Faces, before we were aware, and while I was a wiping mine, he gave me such a Salute with his Tail, that made me stand farther off, which seem'd to please him mightily, for he look'd at me and chatter'd, as much as to say, I have given it you. The <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> told us, they us'd to play at a cer∣tain Game with the Natives for Money, and would often win, and then go spend what they had got, upon a Liquor that made them Drunk, and as soon as they found themselves so, they would retire very decently, and take a Nap, by which they were very often caught.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph de Acosta,</HI> that wrote the Histo∣ry of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> in <HI>Spanish,</HI> tells a Story of one of these Sort of Creatures, going to a Tavern, with a Pot, and Mo∣ney to pay for his Wine▪ yet would not part with his Money, till they had fill'd his Pot with the Wine; but in the mean time beat
<PB N="13" REF="227"/>
four or five Boys, that did their Endea∣vour to take it from him, and carried it safe to them that sent him.</P>
<P><HI>Peter Martyr</HI> relates another Story of one of them, that seeing a <HI>Spaniard</HI> go∣ing to fire a Gun at him, snatch'd up a little Child that was there, and held it before him as a Buckler, and would not let it go before the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was retir'd; then he laid the Child gently down, and ran away, after having first Urin'd upon it.</P>
<P>The Fellow that show'd them, sold 'em to the Governor of <HI>Havana</HI> for Two hun∣dred Dollars, and would have gone with us to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or any where; but we durst not take him without an Order from the Governor, who does not suffer any one to go out of the Island without a Pass from him, which costs a Dollar, and brings into his Purse a great deal of Mo∣ney in the Year, having no other Reve∣nue from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> only so much a Year for a Table, and a Pallace ready furnish'd with every thing that is necessary, besides Servants. Every Ship that comes in pays two Dollars, and at
<PB N="14" REF="228"/>
going out four more, so that the Govern∣ment of this Island exceeds in its Profit any other Government (except the Vice Roy of <HI>Mexico)</HI> in the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather continued favourable, so that we arriv'd at <HI>Jamaica</HI> without meet∣ing any thing remarkable in our Passage: As soon as we had cast Anchor, I order'd the Boat to be made ready to carry me on Board my own Ship, which I saw Ride there. But when I got up the Ship-side, I found my Cloaths selling at the Mast, at, <HI>Who bids more?</HI> which is the Method, as soon as a Person is dead, or kill'd; the first Harbour they Anchor in, the Cloaths of the Deceas'd are brought upon Deck, and Sold by Auction, the Money to be paid when they come to <HI>England,</HI> for it generally happens that Sailors have not any till they come Home again.</P>
<P>They were at the last Article when I came up the Ship-side; which was a pair of black worsted Stockings that cost I be∣lieve about four Shillings, which went at twelve and Six-pence, tho' they had been worn. As soon as I was seen by 'em,
<PB N="15" REF="229"/>
some cry'd out a Ghost! a Ghost! and o∣thers ran away to secure the Cloaths they had bought, suspecting that now I wou'd have 'em again. When they were sa∣tisfy'd of my being alive, and were told my Story, they were all rejoic'd at my good Fortune, but none would be pre∣vail'd upon to let me have my Cloaths a∣gain. So I took up the Slop-Book and cast up what they were sold for, and found, that what cost me about twenty Pound, were sold for four times the Mo∣ney: When I was satisfied in that, I cal∣led every Person, one by one, that had bought any of my Cloaths, and struck a Bar∣gain with them for ready Money, and bought them for about ten Pound; but the ready Money pleas'd them mightily.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wase</HI> being sick ashore, I went to pay him a Visit, where he was mighty glad to see me, as believing I had perish'd; he told me that the Vessel hung Lights out for several Hours, that I might know where to swim, and laid by as long as the Wind would permit, as the Crew acquainted him when they came into Harbour. The Captain told me, That he did not think
<PB N="16" REF="230"/>
he should live long, therefore was mighty glad I was come to take Charge of the Ship, which had sail'd before, if he had been in a Condition to bear the Sea. From thence I went on Board my new Bark, and settled my Affairs there with my Companions, who were mighty sorry to think of parting with me, <HI>Hood</HI> and <HI>Rouse</HI> desir'd they might be receiv'd on Board as Sailors, and go for <HI>England</HI> with us; for <HI>Hood</HI> was an <HI>Englishman,</HI> I mean born in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Rouse</HI> had Friends there. Besides it was as easie to go from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> as from <HI>Jamaica.</HI> So I spoke to the Captain, who was very well pleas'd to receive them, being he had lost five Men by the Distemper of the Country. The poor Captain died in a Week after my coming, and left me Exe∣cutor for his Wife, who liv'd at <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we had Buried him, I went on Board with my two Men, and did de∣sign to Sail in three Days at farthest, which I would have done before, but that I was hinder'd by wanting a Chapman for our Bark, being we had Shares to dispose of; when I came on Board, the Master told
<PB N="17" REF="231"/>
me, he had no Occasion for the two Men to add to their Charge; says I, that's as I shall think fit, for the Power is in my Hands now; And who put that Power into your Hands? (says the Master) He that had the Power so to do (says I) the Captain, whereupon I shew'd him in Writing. He told me it did not signi∣fy any thing, and that he would find no one of the Sailors would obey a Boy, un∣capable to steer a Vessel. Says I, I don't desire to have any Command over you, but only to represent the Captain that's de∣ceas'd: We have no want of any Repre∣sentatives (replies the Master) and you shall go in your own Station, or not at all. It would be a pretty thing, added he, for my Mate to become my Captain, and as I was design'd by the Captain to have the Command of the Vessel before you came, so I intend to keep it. But says I, this Paper sign'd by his own Hand, is but of two Days Date, and you can't show any thing for the Command, as you pretend to: Therefore (says I) I'll make my Complaint to the Governor, and he shall Right me. Ay, ay, do so!
<PB N="18" REF="232"/>
(says he) I'll stand to any thing he shall Command. Whereupon <HI>Rouse, Hood,</HI> and my self went into the Boat again, and row'd immediately on Shore; but the Go∣vernor was six Miles up in the Country, and it being pretty late, we design'd to wait for his coming home, which we were told would be in the Morning early. So I went on board the Bark, and laid all Night, the Ship lying beyond the Keys two Leagues from the Harbour, in order to sail. The next Morning getting up, with an Intent to wait upon the Governor, and looking towards the Place where the Ship lay over Night, found she was gone, and casting my Eyes towards Sea, saw a Ship 4 or 5 Leagues distant from us, which we suppos'd to be ours. I immediately went on Shore, and found the Governor just come to Town, and made my Complaint. He told me there was no Remedy, but to send immediately to <HI>Blewfields Bay,</HI> where he sup∣posed they would stop to get Wood, which was usual with our Ships that were bound for <HI>England:</HI> Whereupon there was a Mes∣senger order'd for <HI>Blewfields,</HI> which I ac∣companied, to give Instructions to the
<PB N="19" REF="233"/>
Officer that commanded at the Fort, to seize the Master of the Ship, and order him before the Governor at <HI>Port-Royal:</HI> So we got on Horseback, and reach'd it in three Days, it being almost a hundred Miles. When we came there, we found several Ships in the Harbour, but none that we wanted: So we waited a Week, but all to no Purpose, for she past the Bay, as mistrusting our Design; upon this we were oblig'd to return with a heavy Heart, and tell the Governor of our ill Success. Who pitied me, and told me he would see me ship'd in the first Vessel bound for <HI>England:</HI> So I went on board my own Bark, where they were all glad to see me, tho' sorry I was so disappoint∣ed. Now I was very glad that I had not dispos'd of my Bark, for I thought now it might be of use to me. We consulted together, to know what was best to do; at last I made a Bargain with them, if they would venture with me in our Bark to <HI>England,</HI> I wou'd give them not only my Share of her, but as much Money as came to the other two Shares, if they would be willing to part with them: Upon this
<PB N="20" REF="234"/>
we agreed, and with what Money I had, I began to lade my Vessel with Things to Traffick with. I bought a good Quantity of Indigo, some Cotton, Sugar, and Rum. In short, I laid out the best Part of my Money; and on <HI>June</HI> the 1st, 1700, set Sail, and steered our Course for <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>Before I leave <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I think it will not be amiss to give some Account of the dreadful Earthquake that happen'd there in 1692. I am sure it is a true Account of it, being it was wrote by the Rector of <HI>Port-Royal</HI>'s own Hand, who was upon the Place when the Accident happen'd. You shall have it in his own Words.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM on board the <HI>Granado</HI> Mer∣chant in <HI>Port-Royal</HI> Harbour, I doubt not but you will hear both from <HI>Garret</HI>'s and <HI>Bris</HI>'s Coffee-House, of the great Calamity that hath befallen this Island by a terrible Earthquake on the 7<HI>th,</HI> Instant. Which have thrown down almost all the Houses, Churches, Sugar Works, Mills and Bridges, thro' the whole Country; it tore the Rocks and Mountains, and destroy'd some whole Plantations, and threw them into the Sea; but <HI>Port-Royal</HI> had much the greater Share in this terrible Judgment of God. I will therefore be more particular in gi∣ving
<PB N="22" REF="236"/>
you an account of its Proceeding, that you may know what my Danger was, and how unexpected my Preservati∣on. On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 7<HI>th,</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> I had been at Church reading Prayers, (which I did every Day) since I was <HI>Rector of</HI> PORT-ROYAL, to keep up some <HI>show</HI> of Religion amongst a most Ungodly, and debauch'd People. When Prayers being ended, I went to a Place hard by the Church, (where Merchants use to meet) where the President of the Council was, who acts in Chief till we have a new Governor; came into my Company, and engag'd me to take a Glass of Worm∣wood-Wine with him, as a whet before Dinner. He being my very good Friend, I stay'd with him; upon which, he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco, which he was pretty long taking, and not being will∣ing to leave him before it was out; I was detain'd from going to one Captain <HI>Rudder</HI>'s where I was to Dine; whose House upon the first Concussion sunk into the Earth, then into the Sea, with his Wife and Family, and some others that came to Dinner with him. But to
<PB N="23" REF="237"/>
return to the <HI>President</HI> and his Pipe of Tobacco, before it was out, I found the Ground rolling and moving▪ underneath my Feet; upon which I said to him, Lord, Sir! What's this? He reply'd very composedly, being a very grave Man; it is an Earthquake, be not afraid it will be soon over; but it did encrease every Minute, and we heard the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Tower</HI> fall; upon which we ran to save our selves. I quickly lost him and made towards <HI>Morgan</HI>'s-<HI>Fort,</HI> which be∣ing a wide open Place, I thought to be there more secure from the falling Houses; but as I made towards it, I saw the Earth open and swallow up a Multitude of People, and the Sea mount∣ing in upon us over the Fortifications. I then laid aside all hopes of escaping, and resolv'd to make towards my own Lodging, and there to meet Death in as good a Posture as I could, but I was forc'd to cross and run thro' two or three narrow Streets, the <HI>Houses</HI> and <HI>Walls</HI> fell on each side me, some <HI>Bricks</HI> came rolling over my <HI>Shoes</HI> but none hurt me: When I came to my Lodging
<PB N="24" REF="238"/>
I found all things in the same Order I left them in, not a Picture (of which there were several fair ones in my Chamber) being out of it's Place. I went to the <HI>Balcony</HI> to view the Street in which our House stood, I saw never a House down, nor the Ground so much as crack'd. The People seeing me there cry'd out to me to come and Pray with 'em. When I was come into the Street every one lead hold on my Cloaths and Embrac'd me, that with their fear and kindness I was almost stiffled. I per∣suaded 'em at last to kneel down, and make a large Ring, which they did: I Pray'd with them near an Hour, when I was almost spent with the Exercise, they brought me a Chair; the Earth working all the while with new Moti∣ons, and trembling like the rolling of the Sea; insomuch, that sometimes whilst I was at Prayer, I cou'd hardly keep my self upon my Knees by that time I had been half an Hour longer, setting before 'em their many and hei∣nous Sins. Some Merchants came to me, who desir'd me to go Aboard some
<PB N="25" REF="239"/>
Ship in the Harbour and refresh my self; they told me they had gotten me a Boat to carry me off. Coming to the Sea which had entirely swallow'd up the <HI>Wharfe,</HI> with all those goodly Houses on it; most of 'em as fine as those in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and two entire Houses beyond it. I upon the tops of some Houses that lay level with the Water, got first into a <HI>Canoe,</HI> and then in a long Boat which put me Aboard a Ship, call'd, the <HI>Siam</HI> Merchant, where I found the President safe, who was overjoy'd to see me: I continu'd there that Night, but could not Sleep for the returns of the Earthquake al∣most every Hour, which made all the Guns in the Ship to jar and rattle. The next Day I went from Ship to Ship to visit those that were taken up in Boats bruised, and Dying, and to Pray with 'em, also to do the last Office to them, in saying the Form of Prayer that is us'd at the Burial of the Dead, which hath been my sorrowful Employment ever since I came Aboard this Ship, with design to come for <HI>England;</HI> we
<PB N="26" REF="240"/>
having nothing but shaking of the Earth, Thunder, Lightning, and foul Wea∣ther ever since. And the People being so desperately Wicked, it makes me a∣fraid to stay in the Place; for that very time this terrible Earthquake was, as soon as it was Night, a Crew of leud Rogues which they call Privateers, fell to breaking open Warehouses, with in∣tent to rob and rifle their Neighbours, whilst the Earth trembled under them, and some of the Houses fell on 'em in the Act, and those that remain still in the Place, are as Impudent and Drunk∣en as ever. I have been twice ashore to Pray with the Bruis'd and Dying Persons, and to Christen their Children, where I met too many Drunk and Swear∣ing. I did not spare 'em, nor the Ma∣gistrates who have suffer'd Wickedness to grow to so great a Height. I have I bless God to the best of my Skill and Power, discharg'd my Duty in that Place, which you will hear from most Persons that come from hence: I have Preach'd so seasonable to them, and so plain, in the last Sermon I Preach'd in
<PB N="27" REF="241"/>
the Church, by setting before them what would be the Issue of their Impenitence, that they have since confess'd it look'd more like a Prophesy than a Sermon. I had, I confess an Impulse to do it, and many times I have preach'd in the Pulpit, Things that I never meditated at home, and could not methought do otherwise. The Day (when all this befell us) was clear, affording not any Suspicion of the least Evil, but in the Space of three Minutes, about half an Hour after Eleven in the Morning, <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> the fairest Town of all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, the best Em∣pire and Mart of this Part of the World, exceeding in its Riches, plentiful of all good Things, was taken and shatter'd to Pieces, sunk in, and cover'd for the greatest part by the Sea, and will in a short Time be wholly eaten up by it; for some of those Buildings that yet stand and are left, we every Day hear fall, and the Sea daily incroaches upon the Town. We guess, by falling of the Houses, and opening of the Earth, and Inundation of the Waters, that there are killed Fifteen Hundred Per∣sons,
<PB N="28" REF="242"/>
and many of good Note, of whom are my good Friend Attorney-General <HI>Musgrave,</HI> Martial <HI>Reeves, William Turner, Thomas Turner</HI>'s Bro∣ther, is lost: I have lost the best Living, that ever I had or shall have. I came, as I told you, aboard this Ship, in or∣der to come home; but the People are so Importunate with me to stay, I know not what to say to them, I must undergo great Hardships if I stay here, the Country being broken all to pieces, I must now live in a Hut, and eat Yams and Potatoes for Bread, which I could never endure; drink Rum Punch and Water, which were never pleasing to me. I have wrote as effectually as I could to my Lord Bishop of <HI>London</HI> to send a younger Person, who may better endure the Fatigue of it, than I can: Now it would look very unnatural in me to leave the People in their Di∣stress, and therefore whatever I suffer, I would not have such a Blame lie at my Door.

a Year longer. They are going to build a new Town near the Rock in <HI>Li∣guinea,</HI> the Garden of the Island. The <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Petigauies</HI> did attack the Island on the North Side, but were all defeated and destroyed, it being near the time of the Earthquake.</P>

<P>EVER since that fatal Day (the most terrible that ever I saw) I have li∣ved on board a Ship for the shaking of the Earth, returns every now and then: Yesterday we had a very great one, but it seems less terrible aboard than on shore. Yet I have ventur'd to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> three times (since its Desolation) among the shatter'd Houses to bury the Dead, and Christen their Children. <HI>Sunday</HI> last I preach'd amongst them in a Tent; The Houses that remain being so shatter'd, that I durst not preach in them. The People are over-joy'd when they see me amongst them; and wept
<PB N="30" REF="244"/>
very bitterly when I preach'd to them: I hope by this terrible Judgement, God will make them Reform themselves, for there was not a more ungodly People upon the Face of the Earth. It is a sad Sight to see such a fair Harbour cover'd with the dead Bodies of the People of all Conditions; for our great and fa∣mous Burial Place, the Pallisadoes, was destroyed by the Earthquake, and the Sea wash'd the Carcasses of those that were there Buried, out of their Graves. Their Tombs being dash'd to pieces by the Earthquake, of which there were Hundreds in that Place. Many rich Men are utterly ruined, whilst many by watching Opportunities, searching the sunk Houses, even almost whilst the Earthquake lasted (while Terror and Amazement, had seized on all the considerable Persons) have gotten great Riches. We have had an Account from several Places of the Island, of Mischiefs done there by the Earthquake: From St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s we hear, that above a Thousand Acres of Wood-Land, are wash'd into the Sea,
<PB N="31" REF="245"/>
carried away whole Plantations in di∣vers Places, but none suffered like <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> where Streets were swallow'd up by the opening of the Earth. The Houses and Inhabitants went down to∣gether. Some of them were driven up a∣gain by the Sea, which arose in the Breach∣es of the Houses wonderfully escaped. O∣thers were swallowed up to the Neck, the Earth shut upon them and squeez'd them to Death. And in that manner several are left buried with their Heads above Ground, only some Heads the Dogs have eaten. They are covered with Dust and Earth by the People, which yet remain on the Place to avoid the Stench. Thus I have told you a long and sad Story, and God knows what worse may happen yet. The People tell me they hear great Bellowing and Noises in the Mountains, which makes some very Apprehensive of an Irruption of Fire; if so, I fear it will be more destructive than the Earthquake. I know not how to stay, and yet I cannot tell how, at such a Juncture, to quit my Sta∣tion.</P>

I believe this was the most terrible Earthquake that has ever happen'd since the Creation of the World, and did more Damage. They tell a Story of a wicked Fellow, that in the Time of the Earth∣quake ravished a Merchant's Daughter, and after murder'd her, that he might not be discover'd; but a Black that hap∣pened to be in another Room, and hear∣ing what had happen'd, ran away to the Ship where her Father was to give him Notice, that he might come and appre∣hend him. But when he came and found his Daughter murder'd and the Villain gone, he was almost Distracted, and the House tumbling with the Earthquake, he perish'd in the Ruins bemoaning his Daugh∣ter. The execrable Wretch was soon overtaken with Divine Vengeance; for go∣ing to make his Escape, a large Stone from one of the falling Houses, dropt on his Back and broke it, where he was ta∣ken up in such Misery, that he prayed for some one to knock him on the Head to put him out of his Torture. The Pain was so violent, that it took away his Senses, and in the height of his Ra∣ving,
<PB N="33" REF="247"/>
discover'd himself to be the Author of the horrid Fact mention'd; but he died without Repentance, cursing every Bo∣dy.</P>
<P>Another Story that was told me, was, That a Gentlewoman had come out of the Country to lye-in there, being she would be better accommodated, and was brought to Bed but two Days before. The Husband was gone out; and at the first shock of the House all her Ser∣vants left her, with the Infant with her, which with the Violence of the shock, was overturn'd in the Cradle: With this Ac∣cident, the Gentlewoman in a Fright rose out of her Bed, tho' in a weak Con∣dition, and took up her Child, and feeling the House totter, ran down Stairs in her Shift, with her Infant in her Arms, where she was met by her Husband, who took her in his Arms to carry her away, just as the House fell upon them all, where they were drawn out, but the Child was dead, and the Mother died in half an Hour, the Husband mightily bruised, with much Pain linger'd out to the next
<PB N="34" REF="248"/>
Day, and then expir'd, and were all three buried together in one Grave.</P>
<P>One <HI>Abraham Matthews,</HI> an Inhabi∣tant of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> that was alive when I was there, told me of a remarkable Providence that happen'd to him, as he was packing up several Things to carry on Board some Vessel that was in the Har∣bour, for the more Security. He had no sooner come out of the House where he lodg'd, but it fell down and smother'd several People within. Just as he got to the Water-side, the Boat was going off, and as he put one Foot into the Boat, the Boat-Man push'd him out again, and told him he must stay till he came back, being the Boat was full. The Boat in turning the Point by the Fort was over∣whelm'd by a Point of the Shore, which fell upon it, and all that were in't pe∣rish'd. This was the second Deliverance. When he saw what had happen'd, he re∣tir'd to the Church, which was open, to return God Thanks; and beg his farther Protection, or if Death happen'd, he could not choose a better Place to die in. While he was at Prayers, he saw one of the
<PB N="35" REF="249"/>
<HI>Buccaniers,</HI> or Thieves, stealing away his Bundle, which he immediately fol∣lowed, seiz'd, and took it from him: As soon as he was out of the Church, that fell to the Ground. When he had got the Bundle, he kneel'd upon the Earth to tie it faster, the adjacent House sunk down also and smother'd the Fellow, with several others that were in't. Going a little farther he met some of his Acquaintance, who were getting a <HI>Canoe</HI> ready to convey themselves on Board a Ship in the Harbour, where he safely arriv'd, and gave God Thanks for his many and happy Deliverances.</P>
<P>We put in at <HI>Blewfields-Bay,</HI> for the Con∣veniency of Wood and Water, and when we were provided, steer'd our Course on∣ward for <HI>England.</HI> But as we came within ten Leagues of the <HI>Havana,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War of Forty Guns came up with us, who commanded us to strike our Sails, which we did immediately, and coming on Board us, were surpriz'd to find us all <HI>English</HI>-Men, not expecting other than <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the building of our Vessel. Whereupon they made us all Prisoners, and sent fif∣teen
<PB N="36" REF="250"/>
Men on Board us to carry the Ves∣sel into the <HI>Havana.</HI> Telling 'em how we came by the Vessel did not signify any thing, for they said we were Pyrates, and had seiz'd it. And our Pass which we had from the Go∣vernor of the <HI>Havana,</HI> not being to be found, made Things appear but with an indifferent Face; we were afraid we should find many Difficulties in getting our Liberty, especially if they went to their Station, which was St. <HI>Jago.</HI> But it happen'd better than we expected, for she made direct∣ly to the Port of the <HI>Havana,</HI> where we knew every thing would be plac'd in a true Light again. When we were anchor'd, and the People could come on Board us, we were soon known, and the Captain going to the Governor, was soon inform'd of the Matter; so we were releas'd immediately, and had a Visit made us from Father <HI>Antonio,</HI> and honest <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who were mightily rejoic'd to see us.</P>
<P>We were detain'd two Days, before we could get away: And then we set Sail with a brisk Gale, first saluting the Town with our 4 Guns, and 4 Patter∣aroes, which I had forgot to mention our buying at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="251"/>
In two Days after our first Sailing we made Cape <HI>Florida,</HI> and entred the Gulph that bears the same Name, and pass'd it without Danger. But here a sudden Calm overtook us, as frequently happens when your past the Gulph; and the Cur∣rent set strong to Westward, occasion'd, as we suppos'd, by the opening of the Land, upon that Coast. The Calm lasting for four Days and we were insensibly car∣ried within half a League of the Shore, but a little Breeze rising from Land, helped us farther out again: But still our Danger more encreas'd, for we soon perceiv'd three large <HI>Canoes</HI> making towards us, full of <HI>Indians,</HI> arm'd. We had not much time to consult what to do, for they gain'd upon us every Moment. Now Death, or something worse than Death, glar'd us in the Face, and most of us thought this the last Day we had to live. Come Friends (said I) if we must die, let's die bravely like <HI>Englishmen.</HI> To die is just as common as to live, only Life is choice, but Death we still pursue, and every step we take shortens our Journey. If then we follow Death, why should we
<PB N="38" REF="252"/>
fear it? Or if we shou'd fear, what wou'd that avail, since fearing cannot put back the Fated Hour. Then let us like those that wou'd dispose of somewhat, do it to the best Advantage. We charg'd our 4 Guns with double and round, and our Patter∣aroes with Musket-Balls: The rest of our Arms we got in readiness, and resolv'd to Die fighting, and not suffer our selves to be taken, to be miserably Butcher'd, as all the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI> do, when they get any Whites in their Power. We resolv'd to fire our six Muskets upon 'em, as soon as they came within reach; so we took our aim, two to each <HI>Canoe,</HI> and fir'd upon 'em, which did 'em some Dam∣age, for they stop'd upon it: Which made us make the best of our way, but they soon pursu'd us with loud and rude Shouts. By this time, we had charg'd our Muskets again, and fir'd as before at the same distance; but whatever damage we did 'em, they came on as fast as they cou'd, but not before we had charg'd our Pieces the third Time, which we fir'd as before, but did more Execution, as being nearer to us; and now we charg'd 'em
<PB N="39" REF="253"/>
the 4<HI>th,</HI> Time, and laid them along up∣on the Deck for a farther Occasion; for they being so nigh that our great Guns wou'd reach 'em with our double and round, which we fir'd one at a time; the first we fir'd at was the largest <HI>Canoe,</HI> which put them in such confusion, that they fell foul of one another, and being in a hud∣dle together, we fir'd the other three, that made a mighty Havock among 'em. We now thought of a Victory, instead of being made Slaves, and bore up to them that we might make our <HI>Patteraroes</HI> of use to us, which we fir'd upon 'em with Pa∣tridge (or Musket) Shot, that answer'd our end; for now they began to turn tail, which we seeing, fir'd our Muskets the 4<HI>th,</HI> time, which kill'd them two <HI>In∣dians:</HI> And charging our great Guns with single Balls, of 3 pound Weight, (or 3 Pounders as they call them at Sea) and firing at their Boats (or <HI>Canoes)</HI> we sunk one of them, but the Men swam to the other <HI>Canoes,</HI> and taking hold of the sides, with their weight turn'd it over. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> and the rest of our Men, ad∣vis'd to make up to them, and in this
<PB N="40" REF="254"/>
Confusion kill them all. But I was satis∣fy'd with the disappointment they had met with, and as it was not in their Power to hurt us farther, resolv'd to make the best of our way. But looking towards the shore, saw Eight more of their <HI>Canoes</HI> making up to us; this put us upon making all the Sail we cou'd, and the Sea breeze being now pretty strong, we made good way. We thought the <HI>Canoes</HI> wou'd stay when they came up with the other three, but they made after us a long with the those <HI>Indians,</HI> that they had taken up. We had charg'd our great Guns with great Shot, and fir'd at them, but mist them; we charg'd them the 2<HI>d,</HI> time, and one Shot by good Fortune took the first <HI>Canoe</HI> and over-set her, which put them into more Confusion than before; but still five of them pursu'd us, which were met with by some of our Musket-Balls, that gave two of them their <HI>Quietus est:</HI> And firing our great Guns once more, sunk one of their <HI>Canoes,</HI> but the Men soon got into the o∣ther and follow'd us still. Seeing this, we resolv'd to make one strong Effort, and make the best of our way. So we
<PB N="41" REF="255"/>
back'd our main Sail and lay'd by for 'em, and brought our four Guns to one side, and our 4 Patteraroes to bear accordingly; we charg'd our Muskets once more, and laid them in readiness, with two half Pikes, and our Cutlasses; and now we resolv'd not to fire till every Gun might do Execution; we staid till they came with∣in two Ships length of us, and then we fir'd upon them as fast as ever we cou'd, which prov'd effectual; for we kill'd 'em at least Twenty. Upon which, they set up dreadful uncommon Noises, and row'd back as fast as ever they cou'd; we gave them our farewel Musket-Shots, and made the best of our way. By a mode∣rate Computation we kill'd them at least 50 <HI>Indians,</HI> without their once firing at us; neither could we conceive how they intended to Assault us, or whether they had any fire Arms, for we saw none. Af∣ter we had brought our Vessel to rights again, we Assembled our selves to Pray∣ers, and return'd our sincere Thanks to the Defender of the Weak, and giver of all good Things, for our happy Deliver∣ance. We saw the <HI>Canoes</HI> padling to∣wards
<PB N="42" REF="256"/>
Shore, and were met by several o∣thers, with a design as we supposs'd to assist them; but we were now too far for them, and there was nothing more to be fear'd, and so we Sail'd on with a pro∣sperous Gale, and met with nothing worth note. Till <HI>Thursday July</HI> the 15<HI>th,</HI> we discover'd Land, which amaz'd us all, for we did not think of falling in with any Shore till we saw <HI>England:</HI> We went to consult our Charts, and saw we were near <HI>Newfound-land,</HI> and finding that, we steer'd directly into St. <HI>John</HI>'s Harbour, which is the Capital of the Island, I mean of that Part which belongs to the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> The Harbour is large, fair, strong, and Commodious, commanded by several good Forts, and a strong Boom that shuts it up: The Town consists of about 800 Houses, built after the manner of the Houses in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newfound-land,</HI> or <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> was discover'd by <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> for King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. of <HI>England.</HI> This Island is seated in 52 of Northern Latitude; and divided from the Continent by an Arm of the Sea, about 20 Leagues over; it is
<PB N="43" REF="257"/>
larger than <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Climate is much the same as in <HI>England,</HI> very wholesome; has several commodious Harbours. The <HI>English</HI> possess one Part, and the <HI>French</HI> the other; but the <HI>English</HI> are more Po∣pulous. This Island is of great Benefit to the <HI>English,</HI> as well as other Nations, from the vast quantities of Fish that are caught upon the Banks of <HI>Newfound-land.</HI> This is a very large Bank of Sand, which extends a hundred and twenty Leagues to the West, near the Continent, and a∣bout 20 Leagues broad in the middle, and Sharpens to each end. It is reckon'd the most extraordinary thing found in the Sea of that kind, for Ships may Anchor tho' twenty or thirty Leagues from Land. The Fruits are the same with us in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the Soil so very rich, that it will bare Pease, Beans, &amp;c. without Til∣age, which are as good as any in <HI>England.</HI> The Beasts the same, only the Bear which is found there. In short, <HI>Newfound-land</HI> resembles <HI>England</HI> in every thing so much, that if a Man cou'd be carry'd from thence in his Sleep, he wou'd only think he was stray'd somewhere out of his Knowledge.
<PB N="44" REF="258"/>
There is only this to be said, that there is not so many Inhabitants, so there is more Plenty of every thing for human Life: Their chief Trade is Fish, but they send great Quantities of Musk, Sa∣bles, and other Furrs. There is not one <HI>Indian</HI> to be found upon the whole Island, but what are brought from other Coun∣tries, and us'd as Servants; tho' it is re∣ported about 20 Years ago towards the <HI>North-West</HI> Parts, the <HI>French</HI> met with some <HI>Indians,</HI> that us'd to help them to Cure their Fish, and make their Oyl. They describe them a civil sort of Peo∣ple, but no Knowledge of a superior Dei∣ty, and when attempted to be taught, they wou'd Answer. We are well contented with our own God, neither do we de∣sire any other; Why shou'd we offer to change? We think our Fore-fathers wiser than we are, and they Worship'd the same with us: Therefore, as we think of go∣ing to the same Place where they are, we must Worship the same Power. You have your God, and we have Ours; e∣very Nation must have a God according to their own Language. Shou'd we Pray
<PB N="45" REF="259"/>
to your God in our <HI>Indian</HI> Language, how should we be understood; or should you Pray to Ours, what wou'd it avail you, being he wou'd not know what you said to him. Now we have not one God only, but many; as one for Fishing, one for Fowling, and another for Husbandry: And when we are about any of these par∣ticular Buisinesses, we Pray to that God, for it wou'd be too much for one to mind them all. Wou'd it not seem ridiculous for one of us if we wanted Success in Hunting, to Pray to him that takes care of Fishing; or you that wear Cloaths, Wou'd you go to a Fisherman to bid him Cloath you. You tell us there is a vast Number of Worshipers of your God, in all Countries, than what need you any more: We will serve you as well, and as faithfully as if we had but one God, and Pray to our God's to give you Success in whatever you undertake. If you Fish, we'll Pray to that God; if you go to fell Timber, we'll Pray to that, and so on, to whatever you employ your selves in. When you are out of their Dominions, you must Pray for your selves to your
<PB N="46" REF="260"/>
own God. In short, there is neither fair means or foul, will ever bring these poor Creatures to the Knowledge of the true God: If you are angry with them, they will comply with you, and say, Well, Well, we will do as you wou'd have us, but never think of it afterwards: If you Reason calmly with them, than the An∣swer you as above.</P>
<P>After being here two Days we set Sail, and made our Course for <HI>England, July</HI> 25<HI>th,</HI> 1700. We met with no extraordi∣nary Accident in our Passage, till we dis∣cover'd the Land's End, <HI>August</HI> the 21<HI>st,</HI> How rejoyc'd I was to see my Native Country, let them judge that have been in the same Condition as I have been; and I may with truth say, that the Transports felt in first seeing the white Cliffs of the Island that gave me Birth, exceeded the Joy I receiv'd when I was deliver'd from the most imminent Danger. Here we con∣sulted, whether it were better for us to go to <HI>London,</HI> or to <HI>Bristol,</HI> but every one allow'd <HI>London</HI> to be the best Mart for our Goods; so we made for the <HI>Thames</HI> and the Weather being fair, and a brisk
<PB N="47" REF="261"/>
Gale; we Anchor'd over-against <HI>Shade∣well</HI> Dock. Now all that we had to do was to get Chapmen for our Goods; I applied my self to a Merchant upon <HI>Change,</HI> who soon struck a Bargain, and with the Consent of my Companions, sold the Lading, bottom and all, for Nine hundred and twenty Pound; reck∣oning the Lading Seven hundred Pound, which was my own, and two hundred and twenty for the Vessel, and every thing besides. They were all contented with their Dividend, but still resolv'd to go with me to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to see after my Affairs there: So we set out on foot, intending to walk it, and be a little Mer∣ry upon the Road, for we expected more Diversion by walking it leasurely, than going in any other manner. I had turn'd all my Money into Bank Bills, which amounted to 800 <HI>l.</HI> with my Mo∣ney that I had for my Goods, and sew'd them in the Wasteband of my Breeches, not that there cou'd be any Danger, be∣ing so many in Company. We took the <HI>Sa∣lisbury</HI> Road, tho' something out of our way, being I resolv'd to carry my Friend to <HI>Bruton,</HI> the Place of my Birth. Come∣ing
<PB N="48" REF="262"/>
thro' <HI>Basing-stoke,</HI> a Sailor met us begging Charity for God's sake: I gave him Six-pence, which he return'd me ma∣ny thanks for; I ask'd him how it came to pass, that a lusty Sailor as he was did not go to Sea, (especially now War be∣ing talk'd of between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French)</HI> He answer'd he was going to <HI>London</HI> for that intent, but was oblig'd to be beholding to good Men's Charity to assist him in his Journey. Why, pur∣su'd I, have you no Friends, your Cloaths are good, you don't seem to have beg'd long. No answer'd he, this is my first Day, I made an end of the little Mo∣ney I had last Night. Have you been long from Sea, (says I) but a Week: I had the Misfortune to be cast away in sight of Harbour; from whence came you? (ask'd I) says he we came from <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and were bound for <HI>Bristol;</HI> but a violent Storm over took us within six Leagues from the Mouth of the River <HI>Severn,</HI> and drove our Ship upon some Rocks in the Mouth of the Bay, and all the Men perish'd but my self. From <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> (says I) Pray what Ship? The
<PB N="49" REF="263"/>
<HI>Albion</HI> Frigate reply'd he, Who was your Captain? added I. The Captain dy'd at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but the Master supply'd his Place, one <HI>Jacob Bingley.</HI> Did you ever hear of one <HI>Falconer?</HI> Yes, he was the Mate suppos'd to be lost in a Voyage he made to the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> but coming safe into Harbour afterwards, the Captain before his Death gave him the Command of our Ship; but the Master not approving of such a young Man to have the Power over him, set Sail without him: This I learn'd on Board afterwards, for I and another Sailor were hir'd for the Voyage that Afternoon, before the Morn∣ing we set Sail. We had but an indiffe∣rent Passage the whole Voyage, which was made up with nothing but Storms, and Calms, that caus'd a great deal of uneasiness and our Provision receiv'd Damage by the Salt-water, which drove us to the last Extremity; and when we were rais'd in our Hopes of setting our Feet upon our native Country, we were devour'd by the tempestuous Waves: I my self was taken up for Dead upon the Shore by a Fisherman. Have you any Friends (says
<PB N="50" REF="264"/>
I) at <HI>London?</HI> None, (reply'd he) every Place to me is Home, a Sailor is never out of his way; if so, return with us to <HI>Bristol</HI> where we are bound, and I'll promise you if I can't get you a Ship, I'll give you where withal to carry you to <HI>London</HI> without begging. We easily agreed upon the Matter, and honest Tarr went on with us. I ask'd him why he did not endeavour to get a Ship at <HI>Bristol,</HI> he answer'd, he wou'd rather chuse to go in a Man of War, than a Merchant Man, since War was approaching, and he heard there was a Fleet fitting out for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and if so, (says he) there may be some hopes of getting some∣thing there, either of <HI>Jack Spaniard,</HI> or <HI>Jack Frenchman.</HI> We came to <HI>Bruton,</HI> and took Lodgings in the <HI>Magpye-Inn,</HI> where I visited all my Acquaintance; and from thence we went in the same manner to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where the first thing was to en∣quire after my poor Father; But I was in∣form'd by Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> that he thought he was certainly Dead: Tho' he had seen him but once since I had been Abroad, and that was in the <HI>January</HI> before; when he
<PB N="51" REF="265"/>
came privately to him, and told him he was settled in a small Village near <HI>Here∣ford,</HI> and went by the name of <HI>Hawkins.</HI> What convinces me he is Dead, is that about two Months ago, he sent me a Letter which I'll show you: He went up Stairs and fetch'd it, which contain'd these Words.</P>

<P>WHEN I had settled my self in my little Tenement, I be∣gan to think of turning Farmer, that I might have some Imployment to pass away the tedious Hours of my volun∣tary Banishment; but going the other Day to view a hollow Place, where we had our <HI>Marl</HI> to <HI>Marl</HI> our Ground; the Earth on a sudden fell upon me, and I was scarce taken out alive, my Back broke, and bruis'd all over in a pitious Manner.

<P>Grief so overcame me for a time, that I was not able to speak; to be rob'd of a Father, and a Father I lov'd so dearly, was a cutting Stroke; and I was con∣strain'd to make use of all my young Phi∣losophy to support it. My Father had left the Writing of his Estate with Cap∣tain <HI>Pultney:</HI> He having only Mortgag'd it before for five hundred Pound, to a Friend to prevent its being seiz'd on by
<PB N="53" REF="267"/>
the Crown, which was redeem'd by the Captain by my Father's Appointment, when he came to see him last. I paid him his five hundred Pound, and wou'd have given him Interest for it, but he wou'd not accept of it, but advis'd me to part with it, without I design'd to settle in <HI>England,</HI> which I thought was the best way, whether I staid in <HI>England</HI> or not. The Captain undertook the Matter, and sold it for four Thousand Pound. But whilst he was busie about it, I got Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> who was always my bosom Friend to go to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and if it 'twere possible to find where my dear Father was bury'd, and to see how Matters stood there. Accordingly we hir'd a couple of Horses, and set out; when we arriv'd at <HI>Hereford,</HI> we found it not a little diffi∣cult, but at last thro' the means of one Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> Organist of the Cathedral Church, we had sight of the Place, which was about half a Mile from the City: Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> came by the knowledge of it by the means of an honest Clergyman, that my Father had con∣tracted a Friendship with, before that un∣happy Accident befell him that depriv'd him
<PB N="54" REF="268"/>
of his Life. He brought us to his House, where the Gentleman was laid up with a fit of the Gout; as soon as we were private, I let him know who I was, upon which, he tenderly Embrac'd me, and was mightily joy'd to see the Son of his late Friend. Says he, I shou'd have been at <HI>Bristol</HI> e're now, but that the Gout prevented me: Your Father was a Man I had but a short Acquaintance with, yet that little time discover'd him to be a Man of Integri∣ty, Honesty and Honour. When He was upon his death Bed, he told me his real Name, and Circumstances, and what Misfortunes had brought him to this Part; he told me also, that he had a Son at Sea, and beg'd of me to dispose of his little Fortune he had here, and see it put into the Hands of Captain <HI>Pultney</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> which I had done, but was pre∣vented as I said before, by this sudden Fit of the Gout. I have taken care of all your Father's Effects, and the little Farm I have bought my self, it being for my turn. Upon that, he sent his Maid for a little Box which he unlock'd, and told me out two hundred Guineas; this
<PB N="55" REF="269"/>
is what your Father left in ready Money behind him: His Farm, &amp;c. I rate at two hundred and fifty pound more, there are the Writings, and there is the Money. By the Writings I saw it cost my Father, but two hundred Pound; as for his Ap∣parel and other little necessaries, I gave them by his Order to a Maid Servant, and a Man that he hir'd; and for his Goods, there is but few, nor have we made an Estimate of them; but if you'll have them Prais'd, I will give something more than what they are valu'd at, being I wou'd willingly have them along with the House. Says I, neither shall they be parted, and if you please to except of them, be they what the will you shall be heartily welcome: He refus'd them ob∣stinately, but I prevail'd with him to take them with much ado; he also gave me a Ring which I priz'd mightily, because it had been my Father's from his Infancy, given him by my Grandfather. When he had settl'd every thing, I went to see the Place where my Father's Bones were laid, which fill'd me with such awful Sor∣row, that I cou'd not refrain from Weep∣ing
<PB N="56" REF="270"/>
in spight of my Resolution to the contrary. I wou'd have Erected a Tomb, or Monument for him, but it was his last Request that he might be Bury'd as ob∣scurely, as he did design to live there.</P>
<P>After parting with my Father's Grave with a load of Sorrow, we took leave of my Friend the Parson, and Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> and rode for <HI>Bristol</HI> again; but were over∣taken about six Miles from <HI>Hereford</HI> by three Gentlemen of the Pad, that had got some notice of the Booty they shou'd gain if they cou'd Rob us, for I was so In∣advertent as to put all my Money into my Bags which I wore before me at my Sad∣dle; they past us first, but looking wish∣fully upon us, gave us some suspicion of what they were. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> advis'd me to ride back again, and stay still we had more Company; but I told him they wou'd soon overtake us, and seeing us fearful wou'd make them more Resolute, so I rather chose to face them, for we ob∣serv'd they were returning to meet us. We resolv'd to be before hand with them, and we drew out our Pistols ready, and if they offer'd to come too near us to begin
<PB N="57" REF="271"/>
with them. As soon as they came with∣in 20 Yards of us, I call'd to them, and ask'd them what they wanted; if it was our Money, they shou'd first take our Lives; they answer'd, they had no such Intention; Than what is your Reason of passing us first, and then meeting us again? They answer'd, one of their Compani∣ons in lighting to ease himself below the Hill had drop'd his Watch, and they were returning to find it if they cou'd. Why then pass by in the Name of God, (says I) and accordingly they did; but we were cautious of letting them come too near us; as soon as they were past us, we set Spurs to our Horses, and got over the Heath before we look'd behind us; but riding leasurely thro' the Village, we saw them coming after a full Gallop. Now we repented we had not stay'd in the Village; but we resolv'd as before to encounter them if they Assaulted us: The soon overtook us, and coming even with us, told us their Companion had found his Watch, which he pull'd out and show'd us. They said they cou'd not blame us in taking them for Highway-Men;
<PB N="58" REF="272"/>
but they assur'd us, they were Tra∣vellers as we were, and were going to <HI>Worcester.</HI> We did not make any Words with them, but rode along with them, indeed, because we cou'd not help it: They rode with us for about a Mile, and then the Road going narrow, one of them pretending to go foremost seiz'd hold of my Bridle, with the Surprize, my Horse being a very good one, rose up an end; and he discharging his Pistol, the Ball graz'd upon my Cloak-Bag, and did not do any farther Damage. Upon this I fir'd one of my Pistols but miss'd him, but I threw it at him with all my force, which hit him on the Head so full, that he stagger'd a little and fell from his Horse: The other discharg'd a Pocket-Pistol at me, and Wounded me slightly in the left Shoulder; but going to discharge another, I set Spurs to my Horse, and had the good Fortune to snatch it from him, but in the bustle between us it went off, and shot the other Highway-Man's Horse in the Head; which so en∣rag'd him, that he ran away with him in spight of all he cou'd to stop him. Mr.
<PB N="59" REF="273"/>
<HI>Musgrave</HI> who engag'd with him, follow'd him, but considering he had left me with two, return'd again, and in very good time; for the other Fellow that I had knock'd down with my Pistol, had got up again, and had just caught his Horse that was grazing under the Hedge. His o∣ther Companion that I had taken the Pi∣stol from, had▪ drawn a broad cutting Sword, and was laying at me; I by good Fortune had before me a great Coat for fear of Rain, and the ball of his Pistol had broke the Strap, so that I wrap'd it round my left Arm, and receiv'd his Blow, which did me no damage, and in the mean time thrust my Sword into his Side up to the Hilt, which nevertheless did not kill him. But he call'd to his Companion; come <HI>Harry</HI> let's make off, for by G—d I believe I'm kill'd: Accord∣ingly they fled as fast as ever they cou'd back again, the way we came, with my Sword in his Breast; for when he receiv'd the Wound, he turn'd so short with his Horse, that wrung the Hilt out of my Hand. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> was for follow∣ing them, but I found some pain in my
<PB N="60" REF="274"/>
Shoulder, and it began to grow stiff, be∣ing cold, and chose to go on; but in our riding and talking of the late Accident, we lost our Road, and had taken that which had led to <HI>Gloster;</HI> and riding on, we met the third High-way-man, whose Horse had run away with him, who was coming back, as we suppos'd, to see how Things went: As soon as ever he saw us, he turn'd his Horse, and rid away as hard as ever he cou'd, and we rid as fast after him, it being, as we thought, our Road; we follow'd him through se∣veral Villages, and we call'd to the Peo∣ple to stop him, but to no purpose; at last his Horse stumbled, which gave us time to come pretty near him; when he found he cou'd not escape us, he turn'd about, and discharg'd a Pistol at us; I had one Pistol that I had not fir'd yet, which I drew from the Housing, and let fly at him, and wounded him in the Neck; he fled as fast as he cou'd, and our Horses begin∣ning to tire, he got out of our sight; we ask'd several People we met, whether they had seen any such Person, and they told us he was gon into <HI>Gloster</HI> Town e're
<PB N="61" REF="275"/>
then; we follow'd, and got into <HI>Gloster</HI> immediately, and were told such a Man was seen to ride through the Town, so we pursu'd him no farther, our Horses being very much tir'd; but they sent a Hue-and-Cry after him, but to no pur∣pose, for they return'd no wiser than they went out. We stay'd at <HI>Gloster</HI> two Days to have my Wound dress'd, and then rode to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where all our Friends waited impatiently for us, being we had exceeded our Time three Days, after having settled my Money in the Hands of People, that the Captain appointed to Improve it for me. I resolv'd to make a Trip to <HI>Ireland</HI> to see my Sister that was marry'd very well to a Merchant there: But hearing of the Grand Fleet making Preparation for some Expedition, put us all agog, and my na∣tural Genius for Travel, made me once more resolve to be Gadding. I open'd my Mind to Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> who advis'd me to the contrary; but I told him I was so much concern'd for my Father's Death, (as indeed I was) that I shou'd sooner wear it off at Sea, than on Shore, being here every Object that I saw put me in
<PB N="62" REF="276"/>
mind of Him. He was very well satisfy'd with my Reasons at last; but, says He, I wou'd not have you go in any Post, but as a Voluntier, that you may not be con∣fin'd to stay longer than you shou'd desire. I thought this the best way, therefore re∣solv'd for <HI>London</HI> with all my Companions, and get us a Ship. I had Letters of Recom∣mendations to Secretary <HI>Burchet,</HI> and se∣veral Gentlemen that had the Management of the <HI>Navy.</HI> We arriv'd at <HI>London February</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> 1701, Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> and I enter'd on Board the <HI>Breda,</HI> Captain <HI>Fog</HI> Com∣mander, because we were inform'd Admi∣ral <HI>Benbow</HI> wou'd hoist his Flag in that Ship. Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> having formerly had some Acquaintance with the Admiral, waited on him, and had a Warrant for a Quarter-Master given him. The rest of our Companions enter'd before the Mast, that is, Common Sailors in the same Ship. <HI>Hood</HI> was soon made Cook's Mate, and the rest of 'em got some little Office, that rais'd 'em something above the Common Sailors, tho' they enter'd as such, and all by the means of Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> who acquainted the Admiral with their Fortunes. When
<PB N="63" REF="277"/>
we had sent all our Things on Board, and not knowing when they wou'd Sail, Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> and I got leave to go to <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> by Land, where we arriv'd on <HI>Sa∣turday March</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> and stay'd there till the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet arriv'd. A Squa∣dron was order'd out to Cruise, of which our Ship was one, but an unlucky Acci∣dent hinder'd my going with her, (but Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> was forc'd to go against his Inclinations, and leave me behind him;) which was as follows. One Evening coming from seeing a Play at the Bull's Head, a Gentleman coming out with a Lady, the Croud by chance jostled me a∣gainst the Lady, which this Gentleman Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> (Nephew to <HI>Johnny Gibson,</HI> Gover∣nor of the Place) took as an Affront put up∣on him, being he had the Care of the Lady; but I begg'd her Pardon, and told her it was an Accident I cou'd not help; but he being in a strange Passion, call'd me seve∣ral genteel Names, as Rogue, Rascal, and such like, and struck me over the Head with his Cane, tho' I did not much mind his Words; I did not care to take his Blows without a Return, which I did with
<PB N="64" REF="278"/>
Interest, and we were soon parted. But an Hour after, being at the aforesaid <HI>Bull-Head</HI> at Supper, the Drawer came up and told us, There was a Gentleman below desir'd to speak one Word to Mr. <HI>Falconer;</HI> there was one Mr. <HI>Langley,</HI> Lieutenant to the <HI>Windsor</HI> Man of War, that I had made an acquaintance with at the Play, that promis'd to come and sup with us, and I took the Message to come from him, but was surpriz'd to find it, the Gentleman that I had the Bustle with. He wanted to drink a Glass of Wine withme He said, and led me into a Room; when we were there, he told me he came for Satisfaction of the Affront I put upon him about an Hour ago; therefore draw, added he, or I'll run you through. I endeavour'd to pacify him with good Words, yet all to no pur∣pose; he made so many Thrusts at me, that I was in danger of my Life; but at last I disarm'd him, but not without a little Wound in my Arm: As soon as I gave him his Sword again, he push'd at me with all the Malice imaginable; and hearing the People from all Parts of the House, coming to see what was the Mat∣ter,
<PB N="65" REF="279"/>
he clap'd his Back against the Door to keep 'em out, which They on the o∣ther side broke open, and giving him a push, his Breast ran against the point of my Sword, which appear'd at his Back, and he fell down without any sign of Life. The People coming in, I was im∣mediately secur'd, and carry'd to Prison, till they knew whether he wou'd live, or die. I was mightily concern'd, not from any Danger was to be fear'd, but that it wou'd be a hindrance to my Voyage. The Gentleman continu'd in a violent Fever a great while, and his Life was de∣spair'd of; but at last, after a tedious Ill∣ness recover'd, but continu'd weak. One Day he came to visit me in a Chair, where I was confin'd, and told me He was very sorry for what had happen'd, and that to day I shou'd be at liberty; and accordingly came an Order in the After∣noon for my Freedom, without paying any Fees. But to my great Grief the Fleet was sail'd, and <HI>Benbow</HI>'s Squadron design'd for the <HI>Indies.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> beg'd me to be patient, and he wou'd pro∣cure me a Passage in a Store-Ship that
<PB N="66" REF="280"/>
wou'd sail in a Week at farthest for <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and he was as good as his Word; for the next Day he carry'd me to Cap∣tain <HI>Young,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Tyger</HI> Store-Ship, and enter'd me immediately. Then my Heart began to be at Rest, and I gave him Thanks; and for the time we stay'd there, Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> and I were very inti∣mate; and he express'd himself so gen∣teelly about our former Encounter, that he gain'd my Esteem.</P>
<P>Passion indeed, is certainly a Madness; and therefore what is done in that Heat ought to be forgot, if the Person them∣selves repent of it. But how humane it wou'd be, if in the midst of that Fire of Passion which blazes out, they cou'd sprinkle the cool Water of Reason, and quench it? For nothing more deforms the Mind or Body than Passion, and 'tis then we lose our humane Form, and are meta∣morphos'd into Beasts. How many great and good Men have done such things in Passion, that they have repented of all their Lives after. Therefore Passion may be well term'd a Pilfering Devil, that steals away our Senses, and prompts us
<PB N="67" REF="281"/>
to do Actions unbecoming the Form we bear.</P>
<P>We set Sail from <HI>Spithead May</HI> the 18<HI>th,</HI> 1701, and our Captain gave us hopes of overtaking the Fleet, by reason he said, one Ship cou'd make better way than a whole Fleet, being they were oblig'd to wait for one another. We met with no∣thing extraordinary but a Storm, that drove us almost upon the Island <HI>Madera▪</HI> which being so nigh, our Captain resolv'd to Anchor at, and accordingly we did in the Bay of the City of <HI>Funzal,</HI> the Capitol of the Place, Captain <HI>Young</HI> and I went on Shore to view the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Funzal,</HI> the Capitol of this Island, is a large handsome City, with one Cathedral and four other Churches, all neatly Built; two Cloisters, one for the Men, and the other for the Women. The City contains 1600 Houses. There is also computed to be upon this Island 100000 Inhabi∣tants. I bought a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Book here that gives a better Account of the first Discovery of this Island than any I have seen extant, which Mr. <HI>Musgrave</HI> transla∣ted for me in <HI>English.</HI> I have seen it in
<PB N="68" REF="282"/>
<HI>French</HI> since, but not truly translated, be∣ing there was something left out concern∣ing King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, that con∣quer'd <HI>France.</HI> And as the Honour be∣longs to the <HI>English</HI> as the first Inhabi∣tants, I shall here give it you faithfully translated. It being but short, I hope it will not be found tedious. For in all my Voyages I avoid prolixity, as being offen∣sive to all Readers, and the Places I de∣scribe are generally such as are not fre∣quented by the <HI>English,</HI> it being my for∣tune to be carry'd there.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Discovery of the Island of MADERA:</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written Originally in<HI> Portugueze </HI>by<HI> Don Francisco de Alcafarado, </HI>and Translated into<HI> English </HI>by<HI> W. Musgrave, </HI>Native of<HI> Jamaica.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>WHEN <HI>England</HI> was settled in a lasting Peace, after the Tur∣moils and Hazard of a dange∣gerous War. King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, who conquer'd <HI>France,</HI> and fix'd his Royal Standard in the City of <HI>Paris:</HI> He who had felt the Inconveniences of War, knew how to encourage the Pleasures of Peace, and <HI>London</HI> the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom, became the Seat of Mirth and
<PB N="70" REF="284"/>
Jollity. All thoughts of War were ba∣nish'd; the Ensigns now were furl'd, and Swords were wore for Ornament, not Use. Among the rest that embellish'd the Court, was one <HI>Lionel Machin,</HI> the youngest Bro∣ther of a noble Family, and consequently not over-rich; yet a Gentleman (which often happens in younger Brothers) that was reckon'd the only Ornament of the Root from whence he sprung. This Gentleman fell desperately in Love with a Lady, beautiful to Perfection, and the only Boast of her Time. But there was a vast Disparity in their Fortunes; for she was the only Daughter to a Noble∣man, whose Riches exceeded most of his Rank, and consequently courted by those that cou'd make her a Joynture equal to the Fortune her Father wou'd give her. But nevertheless the Force of Love is such, that it never minds Interest nor Du∣ty; and the young Lady, whose Name was <HI>Arabella,</HI> was so much taken with the winning Behaviour of <HI>Lionel,</HI> that she plac'd her entire Affection upon him, who was indeed, bating his slender Means, the most deserving of her. But the Parents
<PB N="71" REF="285"/>
of <HI>Arabella</HI> hearing of the Amity that was between 'em, complain'd to King <HI>Edward,</HI> and beg'd that he wou'd interpose his Royal Authority. The King us'd many Perswasions to <HI>Lionel</HI> to withdraw his Af∣fections, but it was like bidding the Sun stand still, or the Wind, or Rain, to cease; for their Affections were so strongly uni∣ted, that nothing cou'd ever part 'em. The Father having provided a fit Match for his Daughter, intreated the King to secure <HI>Lionel</HI> till the Marriage was solem∣niz'd, who granted his Request, and clapt <HI>Lionel</HI> in Prison under pretence of some treasonable Practices. When immediately the Marriage-Rites were perform'd, and <HI>Arabella</HI> was constrain'd to give her Hand where it was not in her Power to give her Heart; and Parents are to blame to force their Children to marry against their Inclinations, being from thence springs such Disorders in Families that is not in their Power to compose. As soon as the Ceremony was over, the Husband carry'd his Lady to a Palace, seated upon the River <HI>Severn,</HI> near <HI>Bristol:</HI> When done, <HI>Lionel</HI> was releas'd out of Prison,
<PB N="72" REF="286"/>
but with a heavy Heart, for the Loss of his dear <HI>Arabella.</HI> But still his Love en∣creas'd from the Difficulties he found to obtain his Desire, and knowing it impos∣sible to live without her, thought of a Stratagem that gave him hopes of con∣quering all Difficulties. He summon'd a∣bout Thirty young Gentlemen, all Re∣solute, Bold, and fit for any Undertaking▪ When he had got 'em all together, he made this short Oration to 'em:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Most here are my Relations, or what's a nearer Tye, my Bosom-friends: You all know the Indignity I have suf∣fer'd, by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s forc'd Marriage; therefore I require you all to assist me in whatever I shall undertake (with∣out tainting your Honour) to be Re∣veng'd for the Affront put upon me. To this Request they all agreed to serve him with their Lives and Fortunes.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon it was resolv'd to part and take several ways to <HI>Bristol:</HI> When they all arriv'd at their Place of Rendezvous, they consulted together, and resolv'd to
<PB N="73" REF="287"/>
seize any Ship in the River, that they found was fit for their turn. <HI>Lionel</HI> thought nothing difficult when Love was to be the Reward; but now he wanted some means to let <HI>Arabella</HI> know their Design: But at last it was agreed, that one of their Company shou'd enter into the Service of the Husband, which fell out as they cou'd wish, and a proper Person was hir'd to be Groom, where he had the care of a fine spotted Horse, that us'd to carry the La∣dy abroad, to visit her Neighbours: The Wind proving fair, notice was given that the Project was to be put in Execution; the pretended Groom, to favour the Busi∣ness, had omitted giving <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Horse any Water. When <HI>Arabella</HI> had notice of the Hour, she ordered her spotted Horse to be Sadled, under pretence of taking the Air, attended with her Groom, and two more of her Domesticks. When they came near the Cape of Land, where <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Companions waited for Her; the Horse by beating of the Waves against the Shore heard and smelt the Water, and made down to it to Drink, where <HI>Lionel</HI> imme∣diately lay'd hold of the Lady, (who
<PB N="74" REF="288"/>
seem'd to be mightily frighten'd) and put her in their Boat and made off. Now the Day that they had seiz'd the Lady, was also pitch'd on to seize the Ship they had a design upon; which was easily done, being their Crew were most of them a Shore. They cut her Cables, and made off to Sea withal the Sail they cou'd bear, and soon got out of sight, and directed their Course for <HI>France,</HI> but a Storm met them and drove them quite contrary. <HI>Li∣onel</HI>'s Friends now began to Repent of their Undertaking, and <HI>Lionel</HI> was mighti∣ly concern'd for the Danger of Her, he Lov'd more dear than Life; who tho' mightily disorder'd with the Sea, yet seem'd contented in having the Object of her Desire with Her. Thirty Days they were the sport of the Waves, every Day expecting Death; but one Morning they discover'd Land, high, craggy, and very Woody, which fill'd them with Joy, more especially <HI>Lionel,</HI> for now he hop'd a resting Place, for his dear <HI>Arabella.</HI> None in the Ship could guess what Land it cou'd be, for they knew it was not Inhabited, being Birds of all sorts
<PB N="75" REF="289"/>
were so tame, that they would suffer themselves to be taken with the Hand. The Place they chose for their Habi∣tations was a fine Grove of Laurel-Trees that were very delightful, as was also every part of the Country they had rambled over. Finding they were to stay there a great while, they got out of their Ship several Necessaries, and liv'd very pleasant for about 13 Days, designing to commit themselves in a Day or two to the mercy of the Waves, for tho' the Island was delight∣ful to live in, yet it seem'd tiresome to those that wanted many things they enjoy'd in their own Country.</P>
<P>The Night before they design'd to Embark, a violent Storm rose, and drove the Ship from the Island with about 16 Men that were preparing all things for Sailing the next Day. These were tost by the Winds and Sea for many Days, but at last, to their great Joy, discover'd Land, where they ran their Ship on Shore, being she was so leaky she could hardly Swim. But their Joy for being sav'd from the watry Element,
<PB N="76" REF="290"/>
soon chang'd to Sorrow, when they found themselves taken by the <HI>Moors;</HI> they be∣ing Landed on the Coast of <HI>Africk.</HI> Their new Masters (after hard usage) arriv'd at the City of <HI>Morocco,</HI> with their Purchase, where they sold them in the Market like <HI>Cows,</HI> or <HI>Oxen;</HI> but all declaring they were Men of Rank, they were Imprison'd, in hopes of large Ransoms.</P>
<P>When <HI>Lionel</HI> and <HI>Arabella,</HI> and the rest that were left on Shore, discover'd the next Morning their fatal Disaster; Grief siez'd them with such a force, that some of them lost their Senses, running Fran∣tick up and down the Woods, and raving, kill'd themselves. Poor <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Grief sunk inward, and prey'd upon her Life with such Violence, that Death appear'd to her Rescue: She never upbraided <HI>Li∣nel</HI> with her Misfortunes, but clos'd her Eyes with a true Repentance of her fail∣ings.</P>
<P><HI>Lionel</HI> was like a distracted Man, lay'd himself down at her Feet, and cou'd not be remov'd till Death gave him his Re∣lease. His Companions bury'd them to∣gether in one Grave, and at the Foot E∣rected
<PB N="77" REF="291"/>
a Cross, to shew those that were Interr'd there, dy'd under the Banner of Christ: Upon the Bark of the Tree, they cut in Letters the whole Story of their Misfortunes. The rest that remain'd up∣on the Island, propos'd to themselves of venturing into their Boat (which by good Fortune was left on Shore) and steer'd their Course to the nighest main Land, where they happily arriv'd without Danger, but ran the same Fate with their other Companions that were thrown on the same Coast in the Ship, that they all thought was cast away. All the comfort they receiv'd in their Misfortunes, was, that they were committed to the same Prison, that their Companions were in. They were over Joy'd to find those alive that were thought dead, but mourn'd to think of meeting in such a melancholly Place. In the same Prison was one <HI>Juan de Morales,</HI> a noted Pilot, and an excellent Navigator; this Man was mightily pleas'd with the Tales of these <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men, and so often beg'd them to repeat their Adventures, that he had every Mark of the Island exact, and perfectly
<PB N="78" REF="292"/>
saw it in immagination. In the Year 1416 <HI>Don Sancho,</HI> Son to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> dy'd in <HI>Castile,</HI> and left con∣siderable Sums of Money to redeem <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Prisoners that were Captive in <HI>Barba∣ry;</HI> among the rest was <HI>Juan de Morales,</HI> and at the same time the <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men got their Ransom, and safely arriv'd in their own Country, with a Pardon for their Offence from the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the Husband of <HI>Arabella. Morales</HI> and all his Ship's Crew, were taken by the <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI> who met with 'em cruising in those Seas, but all excepting <HI>Morales</HI> had their Liberty given them, who was detain'd for his Knowledge in the Mathematicks, and Promises were made him of great Recompence, if he wou'd serve King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> in his Discoveries.</P>
<P>As soon as they were arriv'd at <HI>Lisbon, Morales</HI> was presented to the King, by <HI>Don Henry</HI> the <HI>Infant,</HI> who was a great encourager to new Discoveries, where he open'd the whole Story of <HI>Lionel</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bella:</HI> Which was so generally receiv'd, that a Fleet was order'd immediately for this new Voyage, and <HI>June</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> 1420
<PB N="79" REF="293"/>
set out to Sea well Arm'd. They design'd first for <HI>Porto Sancto,</HI> as being nigh the Island as <HI>Morales</HI> conjectur'd the <HI>English</HI> abandon'd.</P>
<P>When they arriv'd there, the Inhabi∣tants advis'd them not to go any farther in their Discoveries towards the N. E. being there was a black Cloud which wou'd terminate their Navigation, because there was not any one that ever attempt∣ed it, but lost their Lives for their Pre∣sumption, and were never heard of more. Notwithstanding <HI>Gonsalvo</HI> the Admiral, and <HI>Morales</HI> the Pilot, were well assur'd that very Cloud was the Island they want∣ed to find, they were the more convinc'd in it, by reason the Cloud continu'd of the same colour thro' every Change of the Moon. But the rest of the Ship's Crew were of the contrary Opinion, and Mu∣tiniz'd against <HI>Morales,</HI> telling him that he being a <HI>Castilian,</HI> (an consequently their Enemy) did it to Disgrace them; and that it was a Presumptious thing to pretend to search into the Secrets of Providence.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their grumblings, they set Sail from <HI>Porto Sancto,</HI> and made for∣ward
<PB N="80" REF="294"/>
for their Discovery; but the near∣er they approach'd this Cloud, the more frightful it grew, which caus'd a terrible fear in all the Sailors, intreating <HI>Gonsa∣les</HI> to return, and not to be the Death of so many innocent People. But still they held their Course for all their Clamours; yet <HI>Gonsales</HI> to encourage the Sailors, as∣sur'd 'em it must be firm Land, and to dissipate their Fears, made 'em this fol∣lowing Oration.</P>

<P>They proceeded chearfully, animated by this Oration, and in a little time enter'd the Cloud, or settled Fog; but the Tide driving the Vessel too far North, they put out their Boats to Tow their Ship in the midst of the Cloud; but the far∣ther they Row'd, the Cloud seem'd to de∣crease, and presently after they discover'd Land to their great Joy, being it was what but few of them expected: The first Cape they discover'd, was call'd by <HI>Gonsales,</HI> Cape St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which they doubled and saw a fine and fertile Coun∣try full of fair and lofty Trees, that made the prospect Delightful. Sailing on, they discover'd a large Bay, which <HI>Morales</HI> judg'd to be the Place where the <HI>English</HI> were thrown; but it being late, <HI>Gonsales</HI> order'd to let fall the Anchors, not caring to Land till they had the whole Day be∣fore them. The next Morning they Land∣ed, and found it to be the same Place where <HI>Lionel Machin,</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> were Bury'd.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="296"/>
When they had given account to the Admiral of the State of Things, He Land∣ed and took Possession of the Island for his Master, <HI>John</HI> the First, King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> They erected an Altar upon the Tomb of the two Lovers; said Mass, and return'd God thanks for their happy Success.</P>
<P><HI>Gonsales</HI> term'd the Island <HI>Madera</HI> from the quantity of its Wood, (which in the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Language signifies Woody) that was found all over the Island, but no humane Inhabitants.</P>
<P>After they had search'd well on Shore, Boats were order'd to Row round the Island, being it was dangerous for their Ship, by reason of many Rocks and Shal∣lows that lay in the Water. So steering West, they discover'd four fine small Ri∣vers running into the Sea, the Water be∣ing extreamly clear. <HI>Gonsales</HI> order'd some to be bottled to present to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> his Master at his Return.</P>
<P>Going farther, several Soldiers were Landed in a Valley, which was water'd by a fine River, and a noble Grove of Trees that made a perfect Harbour, where <HI>Gonsales</HI> erected a large Cross.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="297"/>
Sailing on, they came to a Point of Land that ran a great way into the Sea, which was inhabited by such a Number of great, different Birds, that the Men were afraid of being devour'd by 'em. This Place was nam'd <HI>Punta des Gralhos,</HI> from the large Number of Birds.</P>
<P>Going forward, they discover'd a Val∣ley cover'd with fine large Cedar-Trees; next to that they found another large one, where was a great Lake or Pond, from whence they cou'd perceive the Bay they set out from. With searching the Coun∣try, they discover'd a large Plain, which overlook'd the rest of the Island, free from Trees, but cover'd over with a beautiful Fennal, call'd by the Portugueze <HI>Funchall.</HI> Upon this Plain they built a City, and call'd it <HI>Funchall,</HI> from the quantity of Fennel that was found there, which was formerly a Bishop's See, but is still the chief Place for Temporal Affairs.</P>
<P>From this Plain runs three Rivers into the Sea, which form an Island, and Land∣lock the Haven, secure from Storms and Tempests.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="298"/>
<HI>Gonsales</HI> still sent out more Men for Discoveries in the Island, where they found a white Rock, call'd by the Por∣tugueze <HI>Praya Formosa,</HI> or the Fair Rock; below which was a fierce Torrent of Wa∣ter, so clear, that oblig'd 'em all to ob∣serve it. Two resolute Soldiers pull'd off their Cloaths, and attempted to swim a∣cross the Stream, but were hurry'd away with the Current in such an impetuous manner, that they had perish'd if they had not been timely succour'd by their Companions by Ropes, which they threw in, and pull'd 'em up against the Violence of the Stream. This Torrent they nam'd <HI>Soccorides,</HI></P>
<P>The most remarkable Thing they found in their Voyage, was a great Number of Sea-Wolves, which rush'd out of a Cave into the Water when they approach'd 'em. <HI>Gonsales</HI> gather'd all Sorts of Plants, Roots, Flowers and Minerals, together with all Sorts of Birds, and a large Par∣cel of the Earth, and imbark'd for <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> where he safely arriv'd <HI>August</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> The same Year 1420, where he was re∣ceiv'd with all the favour imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="299"/>
In <HI>May</HI> 1421, <HI>Gonsales</HI> was made Go∣vernor of the whole Island, with an addi∣tional Title of <HI>Count,</HI> and in the same Month set Sail with his Wife and two Daughters, and many more, for the Inha∣biting the same, where he happily arriv'd, and laid the Foundation for the present Capitol of <HI>Funchal,</HI> or <HI>Funzal,</HI> but to Honour <HI>Lionel Machin,</HI> who was there interr'd, he call'd the Place <HI>Porto Machino,</HI> and over the Grave he erected a noble Church. Some Writers relate that <HI>Gon∣sales</HI> set the Woods on fire, that continued burning for seven Years, which made Wood scarce in that Island; but there is such Plenty of all Sorts, that I look upon that Story but as a Fable.

<P><HI>Madera</HI> is situated in thirty Degrees and thirty-one Minutes. In Circumference and about forty Leagues, twelve in Length, about two Broad. The Air so temperate, that neither Heat nor Cold is troublesome, and the Soil so fertile, that it yields more Corn for the Bigness of the Place than

any other Island, as large again. The Grass shoots up so high, that they are oblig'd to burn it, and in the Ashes they plant Sugar-Canes, which in six Months time produce Sugar. The Inhabitants are more civiliz'd than any of the <HI>Canary</HI>-Islands.</P>

<P>After we had made an End of our Affairs, we set Sail from thence, and directed our Course for <HI>Teneriff,</HI> one of the <HI>Canary</HI>-Islands, or the <HI>Insulae Fortu∣natae</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> where we safely arriv'd▪ This Island lies in twenty-seven De∣grees, and thirty Minutes; about four∣teen Leagues in length. <HI>Sancta Cruze,</HI> the Place where we Anchor'd, is the chief Harbour. It is an Island very well inhabited, containing three Cities, or large Towns, besides a great Number of Villa∣ges. But what it's fam'd most for is the <HI>Pike,</HI> or high Mountain, that rears its Head above the Clouds, and seems to scale even Heaven it self. I have seen many People that have told me they have been at the Top of this Mountain: But none give so good a Description of it (and even the whole Island) as the Right Reverend Dr. <HI>Sprat</HI> in his <HI>History of the Royal Society;</HI> which is as follows.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><PB N="87" REF="301"/><P>Having furnish'd our selves with a Guide, Servants, and Horses, to carry our Wine and Provision; we set forth from <HI>Oratava,</HI> a Port-Town in the Island of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> situated on the North∣side, two Miles distant from the Main Sea, and travell'd from twelve at Night till eight in the Morning, by which time we got to the Top of the first Mountain, towards the <HI>Pico de Ter∣raira:</HI> There, under a very large, and conspicuous Pine-Tree, we took our Breakfast, Din'd, and refresh'd our selves till Two in the Afternoon: Then we pass'd through many sandy Ways, over many lofty Mountains, but naked and bare, and not cover'd with any Pine-Trees, as our first Night's Passage was. This expos'd us to excessive Heat, till we arriv'd at the Foot of the <HI>Pico,</HI> where we found many huge Stones, which seem'd to have fall'n from some upper Part: About six in the Evening we began to ascend the <HI>Pico,</HI> but we were scarce advanc'd a Mile, and the Way being no more passable for Horses, we left them with our Servants. In the
<PB N="88" REF="302"/>
Ascent of one Mile, some of our Com∣pany grew very faint and sick, disor∣der'd by Fluxes, Vomitings, and Aguish Distempers, our Horse's Hairs standing upright like Bristles, and calling for some of our Wine, carry'd on small Barrels on a Horse; we found it so wonderfully cold, that we cou'd not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it, notwith∣standing the Air was very calm and mo∣derate. But when the Sun was set, it began to blow with such Violence, and grew so cold, that taking up our Lodg∣ing amongst the hollow Rocks, we were necessitated to keep great Fires in the Mouths of 'em all Night. About Four in the Morning we began to mount a∣gain; and being come another Mile up, one of our Company fail'd, and was not able to proceed any farther. Here be∣gan the black Rocks. The rest of us pursu'd our Journey till we came to the Sugar-Loaf, where we began to travel again in a White Sand, being fitted with Shooes, whose single Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather to encounter this difficult Passage. Ha∣ving
<PB N="89" REF="303"/>
ascended as far as the black Rocks, which lay all flat like a plain Floor. We climb'd within a Mile of the very Top of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and at last we gain'd the Sum∣mit, where we found no such Smoak as appear'd a little below, but a continual Perspiration of a hot and sulphurous Va∣por, that made our Faces extreamly sore. All this way we found no considerable Alteration of the Air, and very little Wind, but on the Top it was so impe∣tuous, that we had much ado to stand against it, whilst we drank the King's Health, and fired each of us a Piece. Here also we took our Dinner, but found that our Strong-Waters had lost their Virtue, and were almost insipid, while our Wine was more spirituous and brisk than before. The Top on which we stood being not above a Yard broad, is the brink of a Pit, call'd the <HI>Caldera,</HI> which we judg'd to be a Musket-Shot over, and near fourscore Yards deep, in form of a <HI>Cone,</HI> hollow within like a <HI>Kettle,</HI> and cover'd with small loose Stones, mix'd with Sulphure and Sand, from among which issu'd divers Spiracles
<PB N="90" REF="304"/>
of Smoak and Heat; which being stirr'd with any thing, puffs and makes a Noise, and so offensive, that we were almost suffocated with the sudden Emanation of Vapours, upon the removing one of these Stones, which were so hot as not easily to be handled. We descend∣ed not above four or five Yards into the <HI>Caldera,</HI> because of the slipperiness under foot, and the difficulty; but some have adventured to the Bottom. Other Matters observable, we discover'd none, besides a clear sort of Sulphur which lay like Salt upon the Stones. From this renown'd <HI>Pico</HI> we cou'd see the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> 14 Leagues distant; <HI>Palma,</HI> 18; and <HI>Gomera,</HI> 7; which interval of Sea seem'd not much wider than the <HI>Thames</HI> about <HI>London.</HI> We discern'd also the <HI>Herro,</HI> being distant about 20 Leagues, and so to the utmost Limits of the Sea, much farther. As soon as the Sun appear'd, the shadow of the <HI>Pico</HI> seem'd to cover, not only the whole Island, and the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> but the Sea, to the very Horizon, where the top of the
<PB N="91" REF="305"/>
<HI>Sugar-Loaf</HI> or <HI>Pico,</HI> visibly appear'd to turn up, and cast its shade into the Air itself, at which we were much surpriz'd; but the Sun was not far Ascended, when the Clouds began to rise so fast, as that they intercepted our Prospect both of the Sea, and the whole Island, except the tops only of the subjacent Mountains, which seem'd to pierce them thro'. Whether these Clouds do ever surmount the <HI>Pico,</HI> we can't say, but to such as are far below, they seem sometimes to hang above it, or rather wrap themselves about it, as constantly when the West Winds blow; this they call the <HI>Cap,</HI> and is the infallible Prognostick of insuing Storms. One of our Company who made this Journey agen two Years after arriving at the top of the <HI>Pico</HI> before Day, and creeping under a great Stone to shroud himself from the cold Air, after a little space found himself all wet, and perceiv'd it to come from a perpetual trickling of Water from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found issuing from the tops of most of the other
<PB N="92" REF="306"/>
Mountains, gushing out in great Spouts almost as far as the huge <HI>Pine-tree,</HI> which we mention'd before. Having stay'd a while at the top, we all de∣scended the sandy Way, till we came to the foot of the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> which being steep, even almost to a perpendi∣cular, we soon pass'd; and here we met with a Cave about 10 Yards deep, and 15 broad, being in shape like an Oven, or <HI>Cupola,</HI> having a hole at the top, near 8 Yards over. This we de∣scended by a Rope that our Servants held fast at the top, while with the other end (being fastned about our middles) we swung our selves, till be∣ing over a Bank of <HI>Snow,</HI> we slid down lighting upon it; we were forc'd to swing thus in our descent, because in the midst of the bottom of this Cave, opposite to the overture at the top, is a round Pit of Water, like a Well, the Surface whereof is about a Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at top, and about six Fathom deep. We suppos'd this Water not a Spring, but dissolved <HI>Snow</HI> blown in, or Water trickling
<PB N="93" REF="307"/>
thro' the Rocks. About the sides of the Grot, for some height there is Ice and Icicles hanging down to the <HI>Snow.</HI> But being quickly weary of this excessive cold Place, and drawn up again, we continu'd our Descent from the Moun∣tains, by the same Passage we went up the Day before, and so about five in the Evening arriv'd at <HI>Orotava,</HI> from whence we set forth; our Faces so red and sore, that to coll 'em, we were forc'd to wash and bath them in whites of Eggs. The whole height of the <HI>Pi∣co</HI> in Perpendicular is vulgarly esteem'd to be two Miles and a half; no Trees, Herbs, nor Shrubs did we find in all the Passage, but <HI>Pines;</HI> and among the whiter Sands, a kind of <HI>Broom</HI> be∣ing a bushy Plant; and on that side where we lay all Night, a kind of <HI>Coa∣lon,</HI> which had stems eight Foot high, and the Trunk near a Foot thick, eve∣ry stem growing in four Squares, and emerging from the Ground like tuffs of Rushes; upon the edges of these Stems grow very small red Buttons, or Ber∣ries, which being squeez'd, produce a
<PB N="94" REF="308"/>
poisonous Milk; which falling upon any part of a Horse, or other Beast, fetches off all the Hair from the Skin immediately; of the withered Sticks of this Vegetable we made our Fire all Night. This Plant is also universally spread over the Island, and is perhaps a kind of <HI>Euphorbium.</HI></P><P>Of the Island <HI>Teneriff</HI> it self, this Account was given by a Judicious and Ingenious Man who liv'd twenty Years in it, as a Physician and Merchant, his Opinion is, that the whole Island being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimstone, did in former Times take Fire, and blow up all, or near all, at the same time; and that many Moun∣tains of huge Stone, calcin'd and burnt, which appears all over this Island, e∣specially in the South-West part of it, were cast up, and rais'd out of the Bowels of the Earth, at the time of that General Conflagration; and that the greatest Quantity of this Sulphur, lying about the Centre of the Island, rais'd up the <HI>Pico</HI> to that heighth at which it is now seen; and he says▪
<PB N="95" REF="309"/>
that any one upon the Place, that shall carefully Note the Situation, and Manner of those calcin'd Rocks, how they lie, will easily be of that Mind; for they lie (says he) three, or four Miles almost round the bottom of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and in such Order one above ano∣ther, almost to the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> as it is call'd, as if the whole Ground swel∣ling and rising up together, by the Ascention of the Brimstone, the Tor∣rents, and Rivers of it, did with a sudden Eruption, rowl, and tumble them down from the rest of the Rocks, especially (as is said before) to the South-West, for on that side from the very top of the <HI>Pico,</HI> almost to the Sea Coast, lie huge heaps of these burnt Rocks one under another; and there still remain the very Tracts of the Brimstone Rivers, as they run over this Quarter of the Island, which has so wasted the Ground beyond recovery that nothing can be made to grow there but <HI>Broom:</HI> But on the North-side of the <HI>Pico,</HI> few or none of these Stones appear'd; and hence he concludes, that
<PB N="96" REF="310"/>
the <HI>Vulcanio</HI> discharg'd it self chiefly on the South-West side. He adds far∣ther, that at the same time Mines of several Mettles were blown up, some of those calcin'd Rocks resembling Iron-Oar, some Silver, and others Copper; particularly on the South-West Parts, call'd <HI>Azuleios</HI> being very high Mountains, where never any <HI>Englishman</HI> but himself (that ever he heard of) was. There are vast quantities of a loose blewish Earth, mixt with blew Stones, which have a yellow rust upon 'em, like that of Cop∣per, or Vitriol; as also many small Springs of Vitriol Water, where he supposes a Copper Mine, and he was told by a Bell-founder of <HI>Oratavia,</HI> that he got out of two Horse Loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made two large Rings: And a <HI>Portugueze</HI> who had been in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> told him, that his Opinion was, there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver there, as the best in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Thereabouts also are Nitrous Waters, and Stones cover'd over with a deep
<PB N="97" REF="311"/>
Saffron-colour'd rust, tasting of Iron; and farther, he mentions one of his Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth or Oar, brought from the top of this side of the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirm'd by the last Instance of the <HI>Palm</HI>-Island, 18 League from the <HI>Teneriff,</HI> where, about 12 Years since a <HI>Vulcanio</HI> was fix'd, the violence thereof made an Earthquake in this Island, so great, that he and others ran out of their Houses, fearing they wou'd have fallen upon their Heads; they heard the noise of the Torrent of flaming Brimstone, like Thunder, and saw the Fires as plain by Night, for six Weeks together, as a burning Torch, and so much Sand and Ashes brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds fell upon his Hat, as would fill the Sand∣box of his Inkhorn.</P><P>In some places of this Island grows a crooked Shrub call'd <HI>Legnan,</HI> which they bring for <HI>England</HI> as a sweet Wood. There are likewise. <HI>Apricocks, Peach-trees,</HI> and others, which bear
<PB N="98" REF="312"/>
twice a Year; also <HI>Pear-trees,</HI> as preg∣nant; <HI>Almonds</HI> with a tender Shell; <HI>Palms, Plantains, Oranges</HI> and <HI>Lemons,</HI> especially the <HI>Paeguadaes,</HI> which have small ones within them, from whence they are so denominated. Also they have <HI>Sugar-Canes,</HI> and a little <HI>Cotton, Col∣loquintida,</HI> &amp;c. The Roses blow at <HI>Christmass;</HI> there are good <HI>Carnations,</HI> and very large, but no <HI>Tulips</HI> will grow or thrive there; <HI>Samphire</HI> cloaths the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clo∣ver the Ground. Another Grass grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, so luscious and rank, that it will kill a Horse that eats of it, but no o∣ther Beast. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to spring from one Root, but grows not very high; the Corn of this is transparent, like the purest yel∣low Amber, and one Bushel has brought forth a hundred in a seasonable Year.</P><P>The Canary Birds which they bring to us in <HI>England,</HI> bred in the <HI>Baran∣co</HI>'s or <HI>Gills,</HI> which the Water has fret∣ted away in the Mountains, being Pla∣ces very cold.

<PB N="99" REF="313"/>
<HI>Partridges</HI> larger than ours, and exceed∣ing Beautiful, great Wood <HI>Pidgeons, Turtles</HI> at Spring, <HI>Crows,</HI> and some∣times the <HI>Falcons</HI> come flying over from the Coast of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P><P>Bees are carried into the Mountains, where they prosper exceedingly, and there they have wild Goats which climb to the very top of the <HI>Pico</HI> sometimes; also Hogs, and multitude of Coneys.</P><P>Of Fish, they have the <HI>Cherna,</HI> a very large and excellent Fish, better tasted than any we have in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Mera, Dolphins, Lobsters</HI> without great Claws, <HI>Mussles, Periwincles,</HI> and the <HI>Clacas,</HI> which is absolutely the very best Shell-Fish in the World; they grow in the Rocks five or six under one great Shell, thro' the top Holes whereof they peep out with their Nibs, from whence (the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone) the draw them, there is also another sort of Fish like an <HI>Eel,</HI> which hath six or seven Tails of a span long, united to one Head and Body, which is also as short; be∣sides, there they have <HI>Turtles</HI> and <HI>Ca∣brido's,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="314"/>
which are better than our Trouts. The Island is full of Springs of fresh Water, tasting like Milk; which in <HI>Lalagima,</HI> where the Water is not so clear and Lympid, they cleanse by percolating it through a kind of spungy Stone, cut in form of a bason. The Vines which afford those excellent Wines grow all about the Island within a Mile of the Sea; such as are planted farther up are not much esteem'd, nor will they thrive in any of the other Islands. Concerning the <HI>Guanchio's</HI> or antient Inhabitants, he gave this full account the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> about 12 Years since, he took his Journey from <HI>Guimar,</HI> a Town for the most part In∣habited, by such as derive themselves from the antient <HI>Guanchio</HI>'s in the Com∣pany of some of them, to view their Caves, and the Corps buried in them: (a Favour they seldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their An∣cestors in great Veneration, and like∣wise being extremely against any mo∣lestation of the Dead) but he had done several Elemosinary Cures among them,
<PB N="101" REF="315"/>
for they are very poor (yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best <HI>Spaniard)</HI> which endear'd him to them exceedingly; otherwise it is Death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The Corps are sew'd up in Goats Skins, with Thongs of the same, with very great Curiosity, particularly in the incomparable exact∣ness and evenness of the Seams; and the Skins are made very close and fit to the Corps, which are for the most part entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their Heads, Ears, Nose, Teeth, Lips and Beard, all perfect, only discolour'd, and a little shrivled; likewise the Pu∣denda of both Sexes. He saw about three or 4 Hundred in several Caves, some of them standing, others lying upon Beds of Wood, so hardened by an Art they had (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Curay,</HI> to cure a piece of Wood) that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. These Bodies are very light, as if made of Straw, and in some broken Bodies be observ'd the Nerves and Tendons, and al∣so the spring of the Veins and Arteries
<PB N="102" REF="316"/>
very distinctly. By the relation of the most antient of this Island, they had a parti∣cular Tribe that had this Art only a∣mong themselves, and kept as a Thing Sacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar; these mixt not themselves with the rest of the Inhabitants, nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were also their Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Conquer'd the Place, most of them were destroy'd, and the Art perished with them, only they held some Traditions yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this Business; they took Butter (some say they mix'd Bears-grease with it) which they kept for that purpose in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, first a kind of wild Lavender, which grows there in great Quantities upon the Rocks; secondly, an Herb call'd <HI>Lara,</HI> of a very gummy and glu∣tinous Consistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of <HI>Cyclamen</HI> or Sow∣bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully, upon this Island;
<PB N="103" REF="317"/>
these, with others bruis'd and boyl'd up with Butter, rendred it a perfect Balsam; this prepar'd, they first un∣bowel the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save Charges, took out the Brains behind) after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readiness a <HI>Lixi∣vium</HI> made of the Bark of Pine-trees, wherewith they wash'd the Body, dry∣ing it in the Sun in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating very often; afterwards they began their Unction, both without and within, drying it as before; this they continued till the Balsam had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscle, in all parts appeared through the contracted Skin, and the Body become exceeding light, then they sew'd them up in Goats-skins, as was before mention'd. The antients say, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Personages, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves, and which they will never discover. Lastly he says, that Bodies are found in the Caves of the Grand <HI>Canaries</HI> in
<PB N="104" REF="318"/>
Sacks, quite consumed, and not as these in <HI>Teneriff.</HI> Antiently when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, harden'd as be∣fore memtion'd. They have earthen Pots so hard that they cannot be broken: Of these some are found in the Caves, and old <HI>Bavances,</HI> and us'd by the poorer People that find them to boyl Meat in. Their Food is Barley parch'd and then ground with little stone Mills, and mingled with Milk and Honey, which they always carry with them in Goats-skins at their Backs: To this Day they drink no Wine, nor care for Flesh, they are very ingenious, lean tall, active, and full of Courage, for they leap from Rock to Rock, from a prodigious Height, till they come to the bottom, sometimes making ten Fa∣thoms deep at one leap, in this manner: First they tertiate their Lances, which are about the bigness of a half Pike, and aim with the point at any piece of a Rock, upon which they intend to light, sometimes not half a Foot broad, in leaping off they clap their Feet close

to the Launce, and so carry their Bo∣dies in the Air, the point of their Launce comes first to the Place, which breaks the force of their Fall; then they slide gently down by the Staff, and pitch with their Feet on the very place they first design'd, and so from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom; but their Novices sometimes break their Necks in the learning. He told also (and the same was very seri∣ously confirm'd by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and ano∣ther <HI>Canary</HI> Merchant there in the Company) that they whistle so loud, as to be heard five Miles off, and that to be in the same Room with them when they whistle, were enough to en∣danger the breaking the Tympanum of the Ear; and added, that he (being in Company of one that whistled his loudest) could not hear perfectly in 15 Days after; he affirms also, that they throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet; and now use Stones in all their Fights as they did antiently.</P></Q>

This Account was given to that Ingeni∣ous and Reverend Divine Dr. <HI>Sprat,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> by some <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who had the Curiosity to ascend the <HI>Pico,</HI> one of the highest Mountains in the World; neither cou'd I find him out in any thing but in the heighth he allows it to be but two Miles and a half; but all the Inhabi∣tants agree to make it a full League high.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Young</HI> and I attempted to a∣scend it; but there was such a thick Fog, that we were perswaded to the contrary; we went up about a Quarter of a Mile, but were so wet with the Fog, that we had not a dry Thread about us.</P>
<P>When we had satisfy'd our Curiosities as far as we cou'd, we set Sail from <HI>Teneriff</HI> and made our Course for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> We met a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship from <HI>Batavia</HI> that was drove by ill Weather several Degrees out of her due Course; we spar'd 'em what Necessaries we cou'd, being they were in great Want, and took our Leaves of 'em. The same Evening a Storm overtook us, and drove us out of our Course, but in the Night it turn'd stark Calm. The next Morning we dis∣cover'd
<PB N="107" REF="321"/>
a Galley with <HI>Turkish</HI> Colours out, Rowing up to us with all their Strength; we were all surpriz'd and amaz'd, and cou'd hardly give credit to our Eyes, being no one on Board us ever heard of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Galley so far from their own Coast; but it seems we were nigher <HI>Africk</HI> than we suppos'd, as it prov'd afterwards. Our Captain told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the last; for if we were taken, we might be Slaves all our Lives long. I advis'd our Captain to put out our Boat, and tow our Ship from 'em: For, says I, if a Wind does not rise in the mean time, that we may escape 'em, yet we shall gain more time to put our selves in Readiness to receive 'em when they come up with us. This Advice was approv'd on, and the Boat was got out immediately with six Men to Row, and I oblig'd my self to go along with her to steer her right, that they might Row with all their Strength. We Tow'd so tightly for an Hour, that we made pretty good way with our Ship; but for all our Endeavours, we found that in about ano∣ther Hour they wou'd get up with us; but we design'd to Row till they were
<PB N="108" REF="322"/>
within a Quarter of a Mile of us, and then go into the Ship again. In the mean time our Men on Board had pre∣par'd every thing, and were in good Or∣der to receive 'em. We had sixteen Guns, and forty Men, and Ammunition enough. We were preparing to come on Board, when we found they were almost up with us, but our Captain advis'd me not, and or∣der'd us to have Arms in the Boat, with some Hand-Granado's; and as soon as we shou'd see 'em Engag'd, to go to the con∣trary Side of the Enemy, and fire upon 'em, and by that means we shou'd amuse 'em, that they wou'd not venture to Board us. Immediately it was agreed, and two more Men together, with our Arms, were put into us. The Galley came up with us in an Instant, and hail'd us in <HI>English,</HI> and bid us strike our Colours immediately, or it shou'd be worse for us, but were an∣swer'd by us with our Cannon, instead of our Voices, and we went to it. Now to obey my Orders, I loos'd my Tow-Rope, Row'd to get on the other Side of the Galley, but was mightily surpriz'd to find their Boat out, and about the Number of
<PB N="109" REF="323"/>
twenty <HI>Turks</HI> getting into her, our Men in the Boat advis'd immediately to return, but I told 'em 'twas too late, for it wou'd be worse for us if we did: Nay, our Captain call'd to us to come on Board, but I thought they wou'd do us more In∣jury in getting up the Ship's side, than if we stood 'em boldly, which we resolv'd to do: There was nine of us, and we had Arms enough; so before they cou'd fire at us, we discharg'd our Muskets at 'em, and laid our selves under the Gunnel of our Boat to charge again: When we were prepar'd, I order'd 'em not to stir till the <HI>Turks</HI> had fired; and as soon as they had done so, to set Fire to the Fuze of their Hand-<HI>Grando's,</HI> and throw 'em upon 'em, as soon as we heard the <HI>Turks</HI> fire, which did us no Damage, we set Fire to our Hand-<HI>Granado's,</HI> as agreed upon, and threw 'em in upon 'em; but they suspect∣ing something, it seems, order'd but half their Number to fire at first, and the other half fired upon us so unluckily, when we rose to discharge our <HI>Granado's,</HI> that they kill'd three of my Men out-right, wounded another dangerously, and my self in the
<PB N="110" REF="324"/>
left Arm. It is true, our <HI>Granado's</HI> kill'd 'em four, and wounded several; but still their Number doubled ours, and now they prepar'd to Board us. My four Companions and my self fired upon 'em with our Pieces, but cou'd not prevent 'em Boarding us; yet we clubb'd our Muskets on both Sides, and fell to work; but a <HI>Turk</HI> coming behind me while I was en∣gaging with another, and struck the Cock of his Pistol into my Skull, and I drop'd down for Dead; but when I came to my self, which was not in several Hours, as I was told, I found my self on Board the Galley,</P>
<P>They had order'd a <HI>Surgeon</HI> to dress my Wounds, which were three; one in my left Arm, that in my Skull, and ano∣ther upon the Side of my Throat, which I did not feel in the receiving. I was or∣der'd to be taken particular care of; for being I was not in a Sailor's Habit, they thought I was something above the rest, and therefore hop'd to get a considerable Sum for my Ransom. The Surgeon that dress'd me was an <HI>English</HI> Renegado, whose Name was <HI>Matthews.</HI> The Captain was
<PB N="111" REF="325"/>
an <HI>Englishman</HI> too, born at <HI>Deptford,</HI> but the vilest Wretch sure that ever breath'd. There were several other <HI>English</HI> Renega∣do's on Board, most of 'em profligate Wretches. I understood from my Sur∣geon, that the two Vessels parted after a desparate Engagement, and the <HI>Turks</HI> had above fifty Men kill'd and wounded. Three of my Companions were Prisoners likewise; the fourth being kill'd in the last Conflict, and the other expir'd in the Boat with his Wounds. When I began to mend, I walk'd upon Deck, and look'd about me a little; the other three (being well) had renounc'd their Saviour Jesus Christ; he who dy'd for their Sins, and took upon him the State of Man, that he might redeem us miserable Sinners from the Curse of the Serpent. What must be their Punishment, who for a little Ease in this World, forego their Portion of Eternal Life? If the Tortures of Hell have their Degrees, the last and greatest must be their Lot. The Captain of the Galley order'd me one Day to be brought before him on the Deck, where he told me, If I did not in a Twelvemonth procure him to
<PB N="112" REF="326"/>
the Value of Eight hundred Pound for my Ransom; I shou'd be chain'd to the Oar, and be a Slave all my Life; (it seems one of the Three that was taken with me, had fold him of my Abilities, and that I was possess'd of a plentiful Fortune.) I answer'd, I would send to <HI>England,</HI> and do my Endeavour to get that Sum; but I told him it was more than I was worth, and there was no hopes of so much Money for my Ransom, unless my Friends wou'd out of Charity contribute towards it. I added, I believ'd I cou'd raise a Hundred and fifty, or Two hundred Pounds: But he stuck to his Text, and told me, He wou'd bate me nothing of that; and when the Time was expir'd that he had fix'd, if the Money did not come, I shou'd never have my Li∣berty. I told him, I wou'd do my Endea∣vour to procure it for him when we came into Port, and had liberty to write to my Friends in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain did design to Cruize a Month longer, that he might take some Prize to make him amends for his last Disappointment. He never importun'd me to forsake my Religion; being, if I
<PB N="113" REF="327"/>
had been as vile as the others, he wou'd not have had any hopes of my Money to re∣deem me. We coasted off the Shore of <HI>Africk</HI> a Fortnight or three Weeks, but met with no Prize; which enrag'd the Captain very much. One Day the <HI>Sur∣geon</HI> dressing the Wound in my Head, slipt into my Hand a Letter, which he bid me Read cautiously, and give him an Answer the next Day. I had not an Op∣portunity for several Hours to Read the Contents; at last I counterfeited a sudden Weakness, and retir'd to my Cabin, which was in the Place we call the <HI>Forecastle.</HI> When I laid my self down, and found no one was near me, I open'd my Letter, and Read the Contents to this Effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>We whose Names are subscrib'd to this, have resolv'd upon a Stratagem for our Li∣berty, there is seven of us, <HI>English,</HI> besides your self; and the Galley-Slaves are <HI>20</HI> in Number who have notice of the Project. One of the <HI>English</HI> that has the Keys of the Galley-Slaves Chains is also one of our Number. Our Project must be put speedily in execu∣tion, being they'll go into Harbour in Ten
<PB N="114" REF="328"/>
Days, and then it will be impossible to ef∣fect it. We will procure Arms, and give you farther Notice of the Hour. We must not seem to converse together, neither must you take it ill if you find we give you ill Language now and then, it being only to insinuate our selves into the good Esteem of the <HI>Turks.</HI> When we have redeem'd the Slaves, we shall be Twenty-eight in Num∣ber, which will be a sufficient Strength to Cope with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they being but Forty-one in all. We will convey Arms into your Cabin by the means of Mr. <HI>Matthews,</HI> and we doubt not but we shall effect our Liberty under God.</P>

<P><PB N="115" REF="329"/>
After I had read it, I pray'd to God to Aid us in our Design. The next Day Mr. <HI>Mat∣thews</HI> came to dress me as before; I gave him to understand that I had read, and consider'd the Letter, and told him my Opinion was to execute it as fast as ever we cou'd, for fear of any Accident that might happen: For, says I, it is not impossible but we may meet with one of their own Galleys, and then we shall find it to be a fruitless Underta∣king. Says he, we must wait a conveni∣ent time; for if we shou'd fail, we must expect the worst of Torments. He went from me upon this, being some of the <HI>Turks</HI> came to look upon my Wound. The Captain ask'd him how my Hurts far'd? Ah! Dam him, says he, the Chri∣stian Dog will do well enough I warrant him: So much the better, answer'd the Captain, for I am inform'd he is worth a great deal of Money, and I shall set his Ransom at a higher Rate than what I first determin'd. All this Discourse I heard, being upon Deck, talking with my three Companions that were taken with me, who treated me with ill Language, and call'd me Christian Fool, that wou'd not turn
<PB N="116" REF="330"/>
<HI>Mahometan,</HI> when I might have all the Liberty I desir'd. One of them carry'd the Jest so far, that he gave me two or three good Strokes with his Hand; but the Captain seeing 'em, said to 'em, laugh∣ing, Let the Fool alone, 'tis not worth your while to foul your Fingers about him. I said so much to 'em concerning <HI>Maho∣met</HI> their False Prophet, that if the <HI>Turks</HI> had understood me, I might have run the Danger of being murder'd. But generally the <HI>Rengado's,</HI> (that is, those that for∣sake their Christian Faith, and turn <HI>Turks)</HI> have so little of any Religion in 'em, that they laugh at those that have any at all. At Night Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> told me in <HI>French</HI> very low, that the next Morning early was design'd for their Enterprize, being it was some Fast-day with them, that they usually at Four a Clock in the Morning rise, and wash themselves all over, and pray to their Prophet for some time; and this being to be done below, they thought then wou'd be the right time. Accord∣ingly all that Night they spent secretly in preparing every thing. He that com∣manded the Slaves (which was <HI>Jenkins)</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="331"/>
found fought with 'em for something, and chastiz'd 'em as usual, but took the Op∣portunity to unlock 'em all, and order'd 'em to lie still as if their Chains were fast, till they had Command to do otherwise. Every thing succeeded to our Wishes, for the <HI>Turks</HI> got up to their Devotion sooner than we expected, even before it was Light; and hudling down together, we clap'd down the Hatches, and secur'd the best part of 'em. The Captain, with two <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and one <HI>Frenchman,</HI> were seiz'd in the Cabin, and bound Hands and Feet; and this without any Noise. About Eight others that had not got up as early as the rest, our Galley-Slaves seiz'd; and before we cou'd prevent 'em, had kill'd 'em all, and beg'd they might serve the Captain and the whole Crew in the same kind.</P>
<P>The Bustle the Slaves made in killing the Eight <HI>Turks,</HI> rouz'd the others below from their Prayers; and when they found they were shut down, they made a Noise; and knocking to be let out, which we did; but first we loaded a great Gun with Musket-shot, and turn'd the Muzzle to∣wards
<PB N="118" REF="332"/>
the Scuttle. Then as they came up, we Bound 'em; but being but few <HI>English,</HI> we cou'd not hinder the Slaves from kil∣ling several of these too. At last we bound 'em all, being Twenty-five, there being kill'd by the Slaves sixteen; and after∣wards, by the Consent and Agreement of all, we chain'd twenty of 'em to the Oar in the room of those we had releas'd; but they began to be very stubborn at first, but we put the Slaves to 'em, and they soon made 'em work, by giving 'em the same Usage as they generally us'd to re∣ceive from 'em.</P>
<P>When we had secur'd 'em, we return'd God thanks for our happy Success, and then consulted which way we shou'd steer. We <HI>English</HI> agreed to go for <HI>England,</HI> but the Slaves we redeem'd, being mostly <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> and <HI>Portugueze,</HI> were for going to <HI>Spain;</HI> in short, there was no agreeing, for they being the greater Number, they pretended to have the Command over us, never considering 'twas to us they chiefly ow'd their Liberty. I must confess I was very much dissatisfy'd at their Ingratitude, but cou'd not find any means to help our
<PB N="119" REF="333"/>
selves. Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> spoke to 'em in <HI>Spanish,</HI> and laid before 'em the Benefit it wou'd be for 'em to go for <HI>England;</HI> but it was like Preaching to so many Beasts, for they regarded him not, but re∣solv'd to follow their first Design of di∣recting their Course for <HI>Spain.</HI> When we found there was no Remedy, we de∣sir'd 'em to touch at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and set us ashore there; which they con∣sented with much intreaty. If we had been of an equal Number, we wou'd have endeavour'd to have forc'd 'em with us for <HI>England,</HI> that they might have repent∣ed their Ingratitude.</P>
<P>They wou'd not let any of us have the Command of the Vessel, but one <HI>Ve∣lasques</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> was chosen Captain, who immediately turn'd out Mr. <HI>Mat∣thews,</HI> that we had given the Captain's Cabin to, and took Possession of it him∣self. This set us all a murmuring, and we consulted to contrive some way to be even with 'em; but they were so watch∣ful, and always upon their Guard, that it was to no purpose to plot any thing. They us'd to put Centinels upon us every
<PB N="120" REF="334"/>
time we went to Rest. One Night we was awaken'd out of our Sleep by Orders from our new Captain <HI>Velasques;</HI> when we were upon Deck, he told us there was a Ship discover'd to the Windward of us. Now my Reason of sending for you, says the Captain, is, We design to Attack her, and make Prize of her, let her be of what Nation she will, except∣ing <HI>Spanish.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> had told us in <HI>English</HI> what he said, my In∣dignation rose that I cou'd hardly forbear rushing upon him, and tear his Throat out: But at last my Reason conquer'd my Passion, and I became calm. I bid Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> let him know he cou'd not ex∣pect us to fight, if they were <HI>English,</HI> our Countrymen: But he swore we shou'd fight, or be kill'd, if they were our own Fathers. I bid Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> tell him, As for my own part, I wou'd not fight a stroke, let it be what Nation it wou'd; and for his threatning to kill us, I did not know but it wou'd be better to die, than to Sociate with such an ungrateful Crew as they were. The Ship now, in∣stead of keeping her Course, as she did at
<PB N="121" REF="335"/>
first, made all the Sail she cou'd, and bore down upon us, which they did not mind in our Disputing. The Captain then be∣gan to change his Tone, and thought it the wisest way to steer away before the Wind, and endeavour to get from 'em. Whereupon he crowded away, and be∣labour'd the poor <HI>Turks</HI> with his Bastina∣do to Row with all their Strength, that I pity'd 'em. Looking towards the Ship that pursu'd us, we cou'd perceive <HI>English</HI> Colours out, which rejoyc'd us <HI>English</HI> mightily. We now consulted how we shou'd stop the Galley; for with Sailing and Rowing we went faster than they. At last I resolv'd to take a Pistol, and shoot him through the Head, let the Con∣sequence be what it wou'd. So I laid hold of one of the Pistols unperceiv'd (they having prepar'd their Arms for their En∣gagement,) goes up to <HI>Velasques,</HI> and took him by the Throat with my Left-hand; and holding the Pistol to his Breast with my Right, I threatn'd to shoot him Dead if he or his Men offer'd to stir. Several of his Companions were running to his Assistance, but were stop'd by Mr. <HI>Mat∣thews,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="336"/>
telling 'em, if they offer'd to stir, their Captain was a Dead Man. This Bustle caus'd the <HI>Turks</HI> to lye upon their Oars, and in the mean tims Mr. <HI>Sloan</HI> brought the Gally to the Wind, and lay'd by, and the Ship got up with us in an Instant, and without hailing us, pour'd in a Broad-side upon us, which kill'd us two of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and five of our <HI>Spaniards,</HI> among which was that ungrateful Monster <HI>Valasques,</HI> and the wind of one of the Shot threw me down upon Deck without any farther hurt; we had no Colours up at all but the <HI>Vane</HI> upon the Top-mast Head, which shew'd us to be a <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessel; I sent up <HI>George Kirk</HI> to take down that, which prevented their Firing again; upon this they haled us: But after we told 'em we were <HI>En∣glish,</HI> they sent immediately two Boats well arm'd on Board us, and when we had satisfied 'em how it was with us, we seiz'd upon our vile <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> and bound 'em, we saw it was an <HI>English</HI> Man of War, and upon enquiry found it was the <HI>Ruby,</HI> Captain <HI>Walton</HI> Commander, bound after the Fleet for
<PB N="123" REF="337"/>
the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> They had met with Capt. <HI>Young</HI> and his Crew steering their Course for <HI>England,</HI> being they were so disabled with the Engagement they had with the Gally of the <HI>Turks</HI> that we were in, they durst not hold on their Way for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> So the Stores were most of 'em put on Board the <HI>Ruby,</HI> and the rest were to follow as soon as they cou'd Ship 'em in another Vessel. Now there were two Men that were Passengers in Captain <HI>Young</HI>'s Ship, put on Board the <HI>Ruby</HI> to pursue their Voyage, and they seeing the Galley knew her to be the same that engag'd with Captain <HI>Young</HI> in the <HI>Tyger,</HI> and that was the reason they fir'd upon us without hailing, as is usual in those Cases.</P>
<P>I was very glad of an Opportunity to pursue my Voyage, I made my Address to Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> who very friendly re∣ceived me; while we were consulting what we shou'd do about our Prisoners, the Galley seem'd to lye deeper in the Water, and going to examine her, found a Shot had pierc'd her between Wind and Water, but it was impossible to come to it to stop
<PB N="124" REF="338"/>
it; so we took what we cou'd out of her, and going to unlock the Galley-Slaves Chains, the Key was not to be found, and the Galley was sinking every Minute, and before we cou'd break the Chains she sunk down right with the whole 20 poor unfortunate <HI>Turks,</HI> and all the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> (who being ty'd) cou'd not help themselves, neither had we time to give 'em any Assistance. I must confess I was very much concerned to see so many poor unfortunate Creatures meet with Death, when it was in our Power ten Minutes before to have sav'd 'em. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> was realy griev'd at it, and show'd a Temper full of Humanity. We had just brought on Board the Captain, and two more <HI>Englishmen,</HI> with the <HI>Frenchman, Renegado's.</HI> The Captain was so sullen that he wou'd not eat or drink, but in∣tended (as we suppos'd) to starve himself to Death. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> us'd all gen∣tle means possible to bring him into Tem∣per, but to no purpose, for he wou'd not so much as give any answer to what he ask'd him, and in about a Week or eight Days after we took him on Board, he
<PB N="125" REF="339"/>
was found dead in his Hammock; one of the <HI>Englishmen</HI> told us he had poison'd himself, for he always said if he was ever taken by the <HI>English</HI> he wou'd make away with himself, to prevent the punishment he shou'd undergo. The other four <HI>English∣men</HI> that were Instrumental in our Delive∣rance, were all <HI>Mahometans</HI> in appear∣ance, as I said before, that is, they for∣sook their Christianity in outward show, but were realy Christians in their Hearts, as was likewise my three Companions that were taken in the Boat with me, but as they told me they only did it to have some Opportunity of getting their Liberty, and the Words that were us'd, tho' it was in a Speech they did not understand, per∣fectly shock'd 'em in their utterance, and they all hop'd their Peace was made with God for their Crimes, with a sincere Penitence from the moment they had com∣mitted it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> the <HI>Surgeon, George Jenkins, William Ashton,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Smallwood,</HI> were taken in a Ship call'd the <HI>Two Brothers</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> bound for <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> after an obstinate Fight, where
<PB N="126" REF="340"/>
all were kill'd, excepting the abovementi∣on'd four, who were taken and sold for Slaves, and continu'd so for some Years; but seizing on a Boat with the four <HI>French∣men</HI> that did design to venture for their Liberty with 'em, they put to Sea, and rather chose to trust in the Waves, and an open Boat, than stay there to be Slaves for ever. But <HI>Hamet</HI> the Renegado, whose Christian Name was <HI>Lewis Gordon,</HI> having notice of their flight, follow'd 'em with a swift Galley, and got sight of 'em; Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> (who relates the Story in this manner) and his Companions seeing it im∣possible to make their Escape, thought of a Stratagem for four of 'em to get the Good-will of the Renegado <HI>Hamet;</HI> which was this: Seeing no likelihood of getting clear off, the four <HI>English</HI> propos'd to the <HI>French</HI> to cast Lots, and that shou'd de∣cide which four shou'd be bound, and the other four shou'd immediately Row back, as if they had no design of running away, and make out their Story as well as they cou'd; accordingly we drew, and the Lots fell upon the four <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> Im∣mediately we Bound 'em, and Row'd back, and were soon met by the Galley, where
<PB N="127" REF="341"/>
we made our Tale good, by telling the <HI>Turks,</HI> that going a Fishing with the four <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> they wou'd have compell'd us by force to have Row'd with 'em in their Boat for <HI>Spain;</HI> but we being not willing, fell to grappling with 'em, and overcame 'em by main force, ty'd 'em, and were bringing 'em back. The <HI>Frenchmen</HI> kept true to their Promise, and never contra∣dicted us in our Story. <HI>Hamet</HI> upon this became very civil to us, and put us in Trust: He made me immediately Surgeon to the Galley, Mr. <HI>Jenkins</HI> Master of the Slaves, and our two other Companions had some little Office that pleas'd 'em. We went several Voyages with him, and took many Vessels, but never met with any <HI>English</HI> Ship before the <HI>Tyger</HI> that we had the desperate Engagement with. The four <HI>Frenchmen</HI> were made Slaves to Row in another Galley, which was taken about two Months ago by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War, and by that means got their Liberty.</P>
<P>The other two <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and <HI>French∣man,</HI> that were taken in the Cabin, con∣fess'd that they had been guilty of many Crimes, but more especially in denying
<PB N="128" REF="342"/>
their Saviour; but they now felt in their Hearts and Minds, and Earning to Re∣pentance, and beg'd that Captain <HI>Walton</HI> wou'd forgive 'em, and not take their Re∣cantation for a Falshood, being they were in some danger; but a true Light of the Divine Brightness. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> freely forgave 'em, and having a Chaplain in the Ship, we re-christen'd 'em; and the Fellows seem'd ever afterwards to have a true Sense of their happy Condition. Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> and my self, were God∣fathers for 'em all. Therefore it behov'd us to see, that they were now instructed in their Faith; tho' these were of sufficient Years to know their Duty without Sure∣ties for 'em. We have many People that undergo that Office, but never consider what their Duty is; and, in short, make it nothing but an outward Ceremony, when if they thought of it, as they ought to do, they wou'd find it of the utmost Concern; for the true Office of Sureties, or Godfathers, &amp;c. are to train up the young Plant, till it is capable of bearing Fruit it self of Good Works. But many now-a-days do as the Turtles do by their
<PB N="129" REF="343"/>
Eggs, lay 'em, cover 'em with Sand, and never more regard 'em.</P>
<P>We came into our old Course again, and pursu'd it with success: When we were got into the Latitude of the Tro∣pick, we duck'd our Men as before; but there was a great Mutiny of the Sailors: The Captain had three Dogs on Board, and they wou'd have 'em duck'd as well as themselves, unless he wou'd pay the usual Rate; which being promis'd 'em, they were compos'd again, and the Sailors and Dogs were reconcil'd without going together by the Ears.</P>
<P>We overtook an <HI>English</HI> Vessel that had suffer'd much by an Engagement with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Pyrate; she had lost all her Masts, but had rais'd a Jury Main-Mast, yet cou'd make but little way, by Reason of her Leaks. Our Captain sent a Boat on Board, and gave 'em all the Assistance he cou'd; but finding it was but two Days since the Engagement, we had some hopes of coming up with her, being we learnt from the other Ship she was mightily disabled as well as themselves. So we crowded all the Sails we cou'd; and tho' it was in the Night, we made the best of our way.
<PB N="130" REF="344"/>
The Vessel we left, saluted us with five Guns to take their Leave, which we an∣swer'd with three; and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards heard several Guns fir'd now and then, as if some Vessel was in distress, and in an Hour more discover'd a Light, which we made directly towards, and coming up with it, found it to be the <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessel that had engag'd with the other <HI>English</HI> Ship two Days before; the Light that they made was only a large Lanthorn fix'd on their main Top-Mast Head, that we might the sooner perceive 'em. We immediately hail'd 'em, and commanded 'em to surrender: They readily obey'd, and beg'd our Assistance, which they had great need of; for the Water gaining upon 'em every Moment in an Hours time, the Ship sunk, but we had preserv'd all the Men, being in num∣ber 23, having lost in the Engagement with the <HI>English</HI> Ship 27, and receiv'd several Shot between Wind and Water, which they did not perceive till they disco∣ver'd two Foot Water in the Hold, and found no hopes of being sav'd from the merci∣less Enemy the Sea, if we had not fortu∣nately
<PB N="131" REF="345"/>
for them came timely to their As∣sistance. But to allay their Joy for their Deliverance from Death, they were made Prisoners, and being Pyrates (as we sup∣pos'd,) for there was no War declar'd be∣tween the two Nations; therefore they might very probably think they were to be punish'd with Death when they came on shore.</P>
<P>The Ship sunk so fast, that we cou'd save nothing but the Men, which took us up about four Hours, and then we pursu'd our Course, and about four in the Evening made the Island <HI>Barbados,</HI> where we set our <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners on shore. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> gave the Governor an Account of what had happen'd, and left it to his dis∣cretion to do with 'em as he thought fit.</P>
<P>On <HI>June</HI> the Twenty-third we set Sail for <HI>Dominio,</HI> where we arriv'd without any Accident. Here I went on shore along with several of our Men to get Wood and Water for our Ship. The Natives seem'd very civil, and came on Board us in their <HI>Canoes.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> are most of 'em tall, lusty Men, well featur'd and well limb'd,
<PB N="132" REF="346"/>
but poor Brains, for an ordinary Glass of Rum will make 'em drunk: They mightily like this Liquor, and will call for it as soon as ever they come on Board you: They wear no Cloaths, but a little Skirt about their Waste; but most of 'em have Pieces of Brass in the form of a Three∣quarter Moon in their Nose and Ears. I gave one of these <HI>Indians</HI> a pair of Breeches, and he made an Essay to put 'em on in this manner. He first put his two Arms into the Thighs of the Breeches, and desir'd one of his Companions to but∣ton the Wasteband about his Neck; but when we show'd him the right way, and he had put 'em on, he walk'd as if he had formerly worn Irons, and was so un∣easy with 'em that he pull'd 'em off, and made Signs to have some Linnen in exchange: In Return I gave him a long Cravat, and ty'd it properly about his Neck: But to see how the Fellow strutted, one wou'd have taken him for one of the Captains of the Train'd-Bands, ready to march.</P>
<P>I rambled with these <HI>Indians</HI> several Miles up in the Country, and saw their
<PB N="133" REF="347"/>
Hutts, that were dig'd about three Foot deep in the Earth, and then rais'd about six Foot high above the Surface, and co∣ver'd with Barks of Trees, and sometimes divided into Apartments by a couple of long Poles, and Fathers, Sons and Daugh∣ters, lie promiscuously together.</P>
<P>The Day before we sail'd, (after we had provided our selves with Wood and Water) I went up to the <HI>Indian</HI> Hutts to exchange a trifle or two for one of their Bows and Arrows; and returning towards the Ship, by my self, lost my way; and tho' I directed my Course (as I thought right) I came to that part of the Shore where was no Ship to be found; but en∣deavouring to go more West along the <HI>Strand,</HI> my Way was intercepted by seve∣ral high pointed Rocks, which I made se∣veral fruitless Essays to pass. I then en∣deavour'd to make a Compass within Land to get by the Rocks; which I did, but cou'd not find the Bay where the Ship rod. I was now in a deep perplexity, and tho' very much tyr'd, yet resolv'd to look for the Track that wou'd
<PB N="134" REF="348"/>
carry me back to some of the Huts, where I might get an <HI>Indian</HI> to direct me; but there were so many various ones, that I knew not which to chuse. At last I pitch'd upon one that brought me to several of 'em, but not those from whence I came. I search'd 'em, but cou'd find no <HI>Indians</HI> in 'em. I from thence walk'd a little far∣ther, but was surpriz'd with a Sight that shock'd me with Horror. Near the Skirt of a thick Wood I found one of our Men kill'd, with an Arrow in his Throat; and by the Posture he lay in, I found it was done when he was easing Nature. The Object so overcame me, that I thought not my own unhappy Condition, till I was awak'd from my Stupidity by a Noise and Gabbling I heard in the Wood on my Right. This put me into a terrible Fright, which made me run as far from the Noise as I cou'd; for I made no doubt, that if they caught me, I shou'd run the same Fate with the poor, unfortunate Fellow, who perhaps might lose his Life by his seeking me. When I had got a conside∣rable Distance, I enter'd the Wood, and
<PB N="135" REF="349"/>
ventur'd to look out, where I cou'd per∣ceive (tho' it was almost dark) what they were doing.</P>
<P>They cut off the poor Fellow's Head, and tore out his Bowels in a most inhu∣mane Manner. Let any one judge what my Condition must be; I'm sure my Thoughts were so confus'd, that I might justly say I never thought at all. I ob∣serv'd, when they had done, they carry'd him between Eight of 'em upon four Staves, and went towards their Tents. When they were gone, and I had leasure for Reflection, every Thought was a Dag∣ger to me; but yet when my Senses were compos'd, I put my Trust in God that he wou'd deliver me from this Danger, as well as several other imminent ones, which through his Mercy I had overcome.</P>
<P>I crept farther into the Wood to rest my Limbs, but my Thoughts kept me waking all Night. When Day approach'd I went still farther into the Wood, not only to avoid those Barbarous <HI>Indians,</HI> but to see if, when on the other side, I cou'd find some Path that wou'd. lead me to the Bay where our Ship rode; but
<PB N="136" REF="350"/>
before I cou'd get out of it I heard a <HI>Can∣non</HI> discharg'd, that both rejoyc'd and griev'd me; it joy'd me to know that the Ship cou'd not be far off, and griev'd me to think that it was certainly the Signal for the Boat to come on Board, and per∣haps they might be that Moment under Sail. I ran with all the haste I cou'd▪ but with a Mind mix'd with Hope and Fear. I got out of the Wood at last, and directed my Course to that Part as I thought the Noise of the Gun came from, but cou'd find no Path; yet at last I got to the Top of a Rock from whence I cou'd behold the Sea, and the great Grief to see our Ship under Sail not half a League from the Shore. I immediately pull'd off my Shirt, and hung it to a Stick I had broke to support me in my Walk∣ing; but my Signal did not do me any good, for they saw nothing of it. My Despair began to be predominant o're my Reason, and I had often resolv'd to throw my self down from the Rock to end my Misery; but still my Conscience wou'd give me a secret Check; and at last I re∣solv'd with my self to submit to whatever
<PB N="137" REF="351"/>
shou'd befall me, with a thorough Resigna∣tion to the Will of Heav'n. As soon as the Ship was out of sight, I went down from the Rock (not having power to stir before) and endeavour'd to find some Food, but was prevented by a hideous Noise I heard, which drove me to shelter in the Wood again; but the farther I went, the plainer I heard the Noise, so that I knew not what to do; for at last it increas'd on every side: So that coming to a thick parcel of Shrubs, I laid my self down, and couch'd so close, that it was impossible for 'em to see me, unless they came into the very middle of it. I had thrown my Bow and Arrows away, as being of no use to me; but I had my Sword, which, however, I did not design to use. The Noise came so nigh me, that I cou'd hear the Tread of their Feet, and the Boughs rustle about me; but at last they went insensibly away, so that I heard no more of 'em for some time.</P>
<P>When I found all was still, I began to get up and look about me, where I saw 'em in the Plain engag'd with several o∣ther <HI>Indians,</HI> whom I thought I knew,
<PB N="138" REF="352"/>
tho' at a good Distance. I saw several of 'em fall upon the Ground. At last those <HI>Indians</HI> that went hollowing through the Wood seem'd to me to have the worst of it, and were drove by the other Party quite back again; but did not pursue 'em any farther, only let fly their Arrows at 'em; and one of 'em came among the Shrubs where I lay, which startled me, for I was afraid they wou'd come to look for their Arrows, and so find me. After the hurly∣burly was over, I resolv'd to go out of the Wood, and follow those <HI>Indians</HI> that were Vanquishers, with this hope, That they might be of a milder Nature, and not so barbarous as the others who run through the Wood, who to my thinking had more stern Looks than those <HI>Indians</HI> I had seen upon that part of the Island where we us'd to Land to get Wood and Water. So as I said, I got up, and di∣rected my Course out of the Wood after the <HI>Indians,</HI> but soon discover'd two <HI>In∣dian</HI> Men, and four Women coming to∣wards me, (which I suppose had hid them∣selves during the late Conflict:) It was to no purpose for me to fly, for they had got
<PB N="139" REF="353"/>
sight of me; or if I had, they wou'd have soon sent one of their winged Messengers after me; so I chose boldly to meet 'em. When we were come within forty Paces one of another, one of the <HI>Indians</HI> was going to shoot at me, but was with-held by one of the Women: As soon as ever I came close to 'em, they look'd upon me with strange Gestures, and distorted Coun∣tenances; I put my Hand to my Head and Breast, which is the Token of Sub∣mission with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and they let me know by Signs that I must go with them, which I did not deny; for if I had, I knew I shou'd be forc'd; so I went willingly enough. When we had got through the Wood, one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Men wou'd have my Coat and Wastecoat of, which I durst not refuse: The Coat he put upon his Companion, and the Wastecoat on himself, and strutted strangely. I gave my Handkerchief and Neckcloth to the Wo∣man that hinder'd the <HI>Indian</HI> from shoot∣ing at me, who receiv'd it with a great deal of Joy, and seem'd mightily pleas'd with me. When we arriv'd at their Hutts, there came out at least a Hundred
<PB N="140" REF="354"/>
Frightful-looking <HI>Indians,</HI> who came a∣bout me, and had a great deal of Talk with those that brought me with 'em; but the two <HI>Indians</HI> were forc'd to part with their Cloaths they had taken from me, to two of the oldest <HI>Indians,</HI> who im∣mediately put 'em on, and seem'd mighty proud of themselves. They gave me some Rice, and another sort of Victuals boyl'd; but what it was compos'd of, I cou'd ne∣ver learn, neither did I eat any of the same all the while I was among 'em. When Night came, I was sent into a Hutt by my self, and the Door shut upon me, I had a piece of Mat to lie on, but no∣thing to cover me. Now I had leasure to reflect upon my Misfortunes, which I cou'd not do before, by reason of the Fears I was in. I thought my Condition was now worse than ever it was, for I re∣ally believ'd they design'd to make a Sa∣crifice of me, for I thought to my self they were Cannibals, or Men-Eaters. I pass'd the Night with a thousand Anxie∣ties and Inquietudes; but nevertheless my Senses were so tyr'd, that I slept whether I wou'd or no; and in the Morning was
<PB N="141" REF="355"/>
awak'd by four of the Eldest <HI>Indians</HI> that came to visit me, who made Signs to me to follow 'em, which I did without any hesitation; when I was out in the midst of the plain Place before the Doors of their Hutts, they brought before me seve∣ral of their Women, and gave me to know by Signs that I shou'd take her to be my Mate, or Bedfellow, or suffer Death. I must confess I was mightily shock'd, but not giving my self much time to weigh, or think of the Matter, I pitch'd upon her that I had given my Neckcloth and Hand∣kerchief too, and immediately all the rest were dismiss'd; and my Bride and I (for it was even so) were conducted to a Hutt, where there was several old <HI>Indians</HI> wait∣ing for me to compleat the Ceremony. When my Bride and I came before 'em, we were order'd to sit down, then both our Feet were wash'd with Water: After that they brought us a piece of their <HI>Indian</HI> Cake, or Bread, on which I was order'd to break off a piece, and give to my Bride. She then came and laid her Head on my Breast; and then, kneeling, put my Right Foot upon her Neck; when that was done,
<PB N="142" REF="356"/>
she rose and went out, but immediately re∣turn'd, and brought me some Flesh broil'd on the Coals, with which she tore into Morsels, and put in my Mouth, and stood before me all the while I eat. I must confess I was so hungry, that I had a very good Appetite to my Victuals, being I had not eat any Flesh for four Days: But I had no great Stomach to my Bride, although a young well-featur'd Woman, yet her Complexion did not like me. When I had done Eating, my Bride and I were put into a Hutt, and shut close without any Light; but the old Proverb, <HI>Joan's as good as my Lady in the Dark,</HI> had like to have prov'd no Proverb to me. In the Morning we were wak'd with a rude Noise round our Tent, which startled me at first; but I found afterwards it was a sort of an <HI>Epithalamium.</HI> When they had made their frightful Noise for sometime, they enter'd promiscuously Men and Wo∣men. The Men came and took hold of me, and the Women of my new Spouse, led us out with Shouts, unpleasing Noises, and antick Gestures: They continu'd it till we came to a River, and then we
<PB N="143" REF="357"/>
parted; the Men with me, and the Women with my Wife. They put me into the River, and wash'd me all over, and I sup∣pose the Women did as much by my Tawny Rib. After they had given notice by their Shouts, that they had made an End of scowring me, they put on my Shirt and Drawers again, and led me to the Bank where my Spouse waited for me with her She-attendance, and we return'd with the same Noise as we came out. When we came to the Hutts, the old <HI>In∣dians</HI> met us; the Old Men took me, and the Old Women my Wife, and gave us an Entertainment seperably, which lasted two Hours, according to my Computation; when they had made an End, they fetch'd us out of our different Tents, and seated us on a Bank, and then danc'd, and play'd such mad, rude, monkey Gambols, that put me in mind of the mad Feasts of the <HI>Bachii</HI> in <HI>Virgil,</HI> for they wou'd tear their Faces with their Nails, and scratch one another so violently, that one wou'd have thought they had been so many <HI>Bethle∣mites,</HI> and yet all in Mirth; for they wou'd laugh such Horse-laughs when ever
<PB N="144" REF="358"/>
any one of 'em was hurt, that quite stun'd me. When this sport was over, the young <HI>Indians</HI> of both Sexes took my Bride and I into one of their Hutts, and gave us an Entertainment of Fish broil'd upon the Coals, and a pleasant Liquor in a <HI>Cala∣bash,</HI> that was exceeding strong, which soon got into most of their Noddles; and as fast as they grew a little Tipsie, they reel'd out one by one, and laid themselves before the Door of the Hutt, and went to sleep. My good Wife, among the rest, got her Dose too; but was so monstrously loving withall, that I cou'd not tell well what to do with her. When Night came, we retir'd to our Rest as before, and were wak'd next Morning by another kind of Noise that was made, with rude knocking at our Door, or rather Basket, for it was nothing else, and five or six of the old <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> came in with Hatchets, and other Instru∣ments, to enable us to get Food for our selves, as I understood. My Wife took me out by the Arm, and carry'd me into the Wood with our Bows and Arrows, and by her Signs gave me to understand that she wou'd bring me where I shou'd kill
<PB N="145" REF="359"/>
some Creature. At last we came to the Foot of a Hill, where we ascended with some difficulty; but when we had gain'd the Summit, we discover'd vast Numbers, or Herds of Goats. My Spouse shot, and kill'd one the first time; but I was such a Bungler at it, that I cou'd never do any execution. But my Spouse was very dex∣terous, as all the <HI>Indians</HI> are in the Island of <HI>Dominico.</HI> My Wife seem'd to have a great Love for me, and wou'd always make much of me, her Way. When we had skin'd our Goat, we took out our Implements, and made a Fire to broil some of it. When it was ready, I gave my Creator thanks for providing for us poor insignificant Mortals; and looking towards Heav'n, the Residence of him that form'd us all. My Wife fix'd her Eyes upon me, and then look'd upwards too, with a kind of Concern. After we had done, I return'd thanks again in the same manner as before, and my Wife did the same; that is, she star'd upwards a∣gain as if she had a mind to see some∣thing as she thought I look'd at: And when she found she cou'd not see any thing,
<PB N="146" REF="360"/>
she came to me, and put her Arm ten∣derly about my Neck, and with a sort of a begging Tone, seem'd to ask me by Signs and Words, which I cou'd not understand, what I meant by looking upwards. I re∣ally griev'd to know that I cou'd not make her understand, for I cou'd not learn any of their Speech, but here and there a common Word; neither did I ever perceive they had any manner of Worship to any thing; otherwise if I wou'd have made her comprehend what I meant, I might have found it no hard Matter to have converted her from their abominable Heathenism; for she was of a mighty mild Nature, very Loving and Courteous, and nothing like the rest of the Savage Crew, who were prone to all manner of Wickedness. Her Voice too, differ'd from theirs, for most of the <HI>Indians</HI> pro∣nounc'd their Words in their Throat, as indeed you cou'd not well speak 'em with∣out a Gutteral Sound; yet she, whatever was the meaning on't, spoke her Words a different Way from the rest, and had a pleasing Manner. I really began to love her, and only wish'd she had been my
<PB N="147" REF="361"/>
Wife in the usual Forms: She cou'd pro∣nounce any Word in English that I wou'd say to her, but I cou'd never get her to repeat whole Sentences; and all she did was like a Parrot. After we had done our hunting-work, I was for going over the Hill to view the Country, and walk'd up and down a good way; but I observ'd my Wife was very uneasy, but especially when I got to the Brow of the Hill. On the other side (which was about half a League over) I made an Essay to go down; she laid hold of my Arms, and pull'd me back with all her force, and with many supplicating Actions seem'd to beg of me not to go; and when she found I was offering at it again, she screem'd out so dismally, that it frighted me from making any more attempts. I endeavour'd to know what she meant, but cou'd gather nothing from her Words and Actions that cou'd let me into any thing: But she wou'd often handle her Bow and Arrows, and with menacing Actions let me know there was some Danger. As we went homeward this odd Accident ran very much in my Head, and I was mighty
<PB N="148" REF="362"/>
desirous to find out the meaning of it; and every time I went to hunt there with my Wife, I wanted sadly to get down the Hill on the other side. This Hill was of a vast Length, and extended from East to South-West, almost a-cross the Island. I did not know how to contrive it, but af∣ter hunting, I made believe I was very much tyr'd, and laid my self down in order to sleep; and my Wife with her usual good humour, accompany'd me, and in a very little time I found she was in a sound Sleep. I immediately rose, and stole away softly upon my intended Journey. I got away from my Wife without her awaking, and came to the Brow of the Hill, which I survey'd, and found no difficulty in the descending. When I had got to the Pot∣tom of the Hill, I was mightily pleas'd with the Evenness of the Ground, and the Prospect round me, which I cou'd compare to nothing but the Vale of <HI>Esham</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> bating the Houses and Towns in't. I had walk'd up and down the Vale for near an Hour, and was preparing to go back the same way I came. When looking back to take my last Survey, I
<PB N="149" REF="363"/>
saw a Smoak at a Distance, and it ran in my Mind it was the very place that our Men us'd to go to, from on Board, to truck with the Inhabitants. The Thought took up some of my Time; and I believe, if it had not been for a tender Regard for my Wife, I had certainly directed my Course for that Smoak I saw there. But I must confess I cou'd not think of leaving her behind me, but Curiosity put it into my Head to go a little nearer that Smoak I had discover'd: But just as I was mo∣ving that way, I heard a dreadful Scream∣ing behind me; and turning about, I saw my Wife upon the Brow of the Hill, ma∣king the most pitiful Lamentation imagi∣nable. The tender Regard I now began to have for my Wife, made me make all the haste I cou'd to her Relief, as thinking some Mischance might have befell her. When I came to the Bottom of the Hill, I saw several of the <HI>Indians</HI> of our Neigh∣bourhood waiting for me above, and some were coming down. As soon as I had got to the Top of the Hill, I was imme∣diately seiz'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> above, and drag'd along as if I had been the greatest
<PB N="150" REF="364"/>
Criminal imaginable, and my poor Wife hanging upon my Arm all drown'd in Tears. I cou'd not imagin what was the Matter, and what cou'd be the Reason of their using me in that manner. I found it must be something extraordinary by the Grief of my Wife, whose Sorrow increas'd the farther I went towards our Hutts; but e're we cou'd get there, it rain'd and thun∣der'd so violently, that we were well wash'd before we came to our Journey's End, when we were within ken of our Hutts; the whole Tribe came near us, some skipping and dancing, as mightily rejoyc'd; others with the Face of Con∣cern, and hanging their Heads in sign of Sorrow, and mightily lamented over my Wife. After the old <HI>Indians</HI> had consult∣ed some time, they ty'd me to a wither'd Tree that stood at the Mouth of the Hutts; then I began to understand what they meant, for I cou'd perceive they were bringing Boughs of green Wood, in order to burn me. This Sight made my Courage fail me, and it was impossible to express my Despair and Horror. I found now that the last Day of my Life was
<PB N="115" REF="365"/>
come, (for it was impossible to foresee any thing to the contrary.) My last Recourse was to the Maker and Giver of all good Things, for I had try'd all other Means in vain; as also had my poor Wife, whose Rage and Despair overcame her; and she was carry'd away by the Women in the utmost Agony. After my Wife was gone, they set fire to the Wood which enclos'd me; which being green and wet with the late Rain, was a great while in Burning; all the while it was kindling, some of the <HI>Indians</HI> jump'd round me, and danc'd af∣ter their barbarous manner, while others stood ready with their Bows and Arrows to shoot at me (as I suppos'd) if the Fire shou'd burn the Bands that ty'd me, and I shou'd offer to run away. The Wood being green (as I said before) was very stubborn in kindling, which made the Ap∣prehension more dreadful: I made several Essays to break the Bands that held me, but all my Efforts were but in vain; and I observ'd every Time I made my fruit∣less Endeavours, the barbarous Crew shouted and laugh'd for joy. The Fire encreasing, I pray'd to Almighty God to
<PB N="152" REF="366"/>
give me Strength to bear the horrid Pain I was going to suffer; and, if it was possi∣ble, to go out of the World with the Pa∣tience and Fortitude of a good Christian, who was only going to change this trou∣blesome Life for a better. I compar'd my self to a wounded Person, that must bear probing of his Hurts, in order to cure 'em. I now had given my self up entirely to my Thoughts of the other World; and this seem'd to me like aban∣doning a barren Island, in order to go to one where was plenty of every thing. But before the Fire reach'd me, there fell such a prodigious Showre of Rain, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning, that ex∣tinguish'd the Fire. The Storm lasted for several Hours with the utmost Violence, and I remain'd still ty'd to the Tree. When the Storm was over, they began to renew their Fire, and brought the Wood nearer than before, it being at first half a Yard from my Body all round; but now they pil'd it close to me, that the Fire might the sooner be my Executioner, which I wish'd for, as knowing it wou'd put me to a speedier Death. But before
<PB N="153" REF="367"/>
they had well plac'd the Wood, they heard Shouts and Noises in the adjacent Woods; upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> imme∣diately ran away from me, and took to their Arms in an Instant, old and young. The Noise came nearer, and nearer still, till at last I cou'd perceive several <HI>Indians</HI> bolt out of the Wood, who were met by our <HI>Indians,</HI> and a bloody Fight ensu'd. The Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> seem'd to have the best on't, by reason of some Fire-Arms that they had, with which they made strange havock with our <HI>Indians;</HI> the Battle conti∣nu'd for some Hours with a great deal of Heat, and many of our <HI>Indians</HI> fell. At last the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> drove ours, even be∣yond the Hutts, and I cou'd only hear the Noise they made, being I was still fastned to the Tree. The Fight continu'd out of sight about half an Hour, when my Wife came running with all the Transports of Joy imaginable; and after having put her Head under my Feet, she unty'd me, and fell upon me with all the Signs of a sincere Love. I must confess I was mightily re∣joyc'd to see my self at Liberty, and let what wou'd happen, my Condition cou'd
<PB N="154" REF="368"/>
not be worse than it was some Hours ago. I cou'd not forbear expressing my Love to my Wife by Kisses and Embraces. We went to our Hutt, and I took my Sword that had been laid up from my first being amongst 'em. I was going out of my Tent in order to go with my Wife to some o∣ther part of the Island, that was not known to these <HI>Indians:</HI> But just as we came among the Tents, three <HI>Indians</HI> met us that had run way from the Fight (as I conjectur'd:) As soon as they saw me and my Wife, they came up with a great deal of ill Nature in their Countenances; and after some Talk with my Wife, one of 'em with his wooden Sword, went to make a Blow at me; but my Wife inter∣posing, receiv'd the Blow upon her Head, which struck her to the Ground, bloody and senseless. My Rage rose so high up∣on this, that I cou'd not contain my self; but I drew my Sword, and thrust it up to the Hilt in the Wretches Body; the other two seeing their Companion's Death, ran upon me with the Rage of Lyons; but I slipping on one side, avoided the Strokes intended me: They turn'd immediately
<PB N="155" REF="369"/>
upon me, and let drive at me several Blows, which had the good Fortune not to hit me; but I run one of 'em into the Throat with my Sword; upon which he set up such a Cry that frightned me, and ran away, and was immediately follow'd by the other. I then ran to the Assistance of my Wife, who lay almost strangled in her own Blood. I rais'd her from the Earth, and seated her under the Tree where I was ty'd, and brought her to her self a little; but I found her Skull was crack'd with the Blow the <HI>Indian</HI> gave her, and to my great Grief perceiv'd she was just expiring. But the Sorrow and Tender∣ness to part with me, (as I judg'd by her Actions) struck me to the Soul. She laid one Arm about my Waste, and her Head in my Lap, but with such piteous Looks with her Eyes that almost distracted me. She made Signs to me to look upward (as I fancy'd) to pray for her, tho' I cou'd not tell for certain what she meant; but she pronounc'd several Words with Ear∣nestness and Passion; and I really fancy'd, if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u'd have understood one another, I shou'd have found she wou'd have had
<PB N="156" REF="370"/>
some Notions of a supreme Being. Be∣fore she expir'd, the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> re∣turn'd with all of our <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners, I mean all that they had not kill'd; for out of Two Hundred <HI>Indians</HI> of our Party, there was not above Twenty-two left. They were mightily surpriz'd to find me, for many of the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> knew me; and when I came to examine their Faces, I remember'd they were the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabited about the Bay where our Ship lay. One or two of 'em cou'd speak a little English, that they learn'd by con∣versing with the <HI>English</HI> that usually An∣chor'd in the Bay. One of 'em knew my Name, that he had gather'd from our Sailors enquiring for me, when sent by the Captain before the Ship sail'd. Master <HI>Falconer,</HI> says he, me glad to see you, White Men belong to great Ships; come look, for you very Great, and not look you here go away much sorry. My Wife took up all my Thoughts, who was just dying; and though her Strength and Speech fail'd her, yet she endeavour'd to pull down my Face to hers, which she kiss'd; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sunk her Head into my Bosom, and expir'd.
<PB N="157" REF="371"/>
I was really as much concern'd, as if I had marry'd one of my own Complexion and Country; for I had great Hopes, if ever I cou'd have made my Escape with her, and cou'd but have taught her English, to have made her a good Christian. With the Assistance of my now friendly <HI>Indians</HI> I laid her in the Earth: They told me she was Daughter to one of the Chief of their Enemy-Tribe. From these <HI>Indians</HI> I learn'd, that those I had fell amongst were a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> that had liv'd on this side the Ridge of Mountains for many Years, and declar'd open War with those of the other side for holding Correspon∣dence with <HI>Whites;</HI> and were so strict, that they put all <HI>Indians</HI> to Death that ever at∣tempted singly to go over the Mountains, which was the Reason of my Danger of Burning. The Women that they took, (all that were with Child) were shot to Death, and the Men in general ran the same Fate; for they were resolv'd not to have any one of the Breed alive. When they had plunder'd the Hutts, they went through the Woods, and over the Mountain again, and so to their own
<PB N="158" REF="372"/>
Hutts, which I knew. The Old Men, and Women met 'em, skipping and dance∣ing for Joy of their Success, and some Mourning for the Loss of a Husband, Brother, or Father that was slain in Battle. These friendly <HI>Indians</HI> were often plagu'd with their sudden rushing upon them, and destroying many of them, till at last they took up a resolution to Assault them, and if possible to extirpate the whole Race; and they had often made Inroads upon 'em, which lessen'd their Number till this last ended 'em, as I said before. The Women and Female Children dwelt con∣tentedly among 'em, being they had no where to go. I began to live comfortably among these <HI>Indians,</HI> and us'd to partake of their Diversion and Labour; as, Hunt∣ing and Fishing, &amp;c. These <HI>Indians</HI> were so expert in Shooting with their Bows and Arrows, that I have seen 'em hit the Mark Three Hundred Yards, within the compass of a half Crown.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Dominico</HI> took its Name from its being discover'd on a <HI>Sunday.</HI> It is computed to be in length about thirty Leagues, and about twenty-eight in
<PB N="159" REF="373"/>
breadth. It is very mountainous, especi∣ally to the North-East. I have heard there are some <HI>French</HI> Settlements upon the Island; but I enquir'd of the above-menti∣on'd <HI>Indian,</HI> who assur'd me there was not any Inhabitants but Natives, and of those not above a Hundred Families, who were mostly seated near that Part that compos'd the Harbour. Says the <HI>Indian</HI> that I us'd to talk with, there be some indeed a great way off in <HI>de Island,</HI> dat are our Fathers and Mothers; and some of our Wives dat when de die, we throw into de Sea, and de swim to dat place; and when we die, we swim dere too. By this we might perceive they had some Notion of the Immortality of the Soul. I did my Endeavour to make him sensible of the Joys of Heaven, and Pains of Hell, but to no purpose. I told him of a su∣perior Being that commanded all things below, and that Righteous People dwelt with him after this Life. He ask'd where my God live? His Throne is in Heaven, answer'd I, pointing upward, where He sits to Judge the Quick and Dead. He
<PB N="160" REF="374"/>
live up dare, high; how you get up high, no steps reach dare. It is our Immortal Part, added I, that ascends, our Soul, which is cloath'd with the Grace of our Divine Creator, and enjoys an Eternity of Blessings. You be de <HI>White Man,</HI> you have Soul; we be no <HI>White,</HI> we have no Soul; when we die, we fling in Water, big Fish come carry us to an oder place, den we live dare and die agen, and Fish bring us upon back to an oder place. How are you assur'd of this (says I?) Have you ever seen any that have been transported in the manner you tell me of? No (answer'd he) but me sure it be so. But when we were carry'd by Fish to dat oder place, we eat de Leaf of Tree, dat we can no remember what we do in toter place, dat we be bring from. All the Argu∣ments I cou'd use was of no Effect; for Hea∣thenism was so rooted in him, and all the other <HI>Indians,</HI> that it will be the greatest Difficulty imaginable to bring 'em to em∣brace Christianity. Their Understand∣ings are so infirm, that without a Miracle there will be no curing 'em. The <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="375"/>
wou'd have had me marry'd into one of their Tribe; and I, fearful to deny 'em, brought my self off by telling no <HI>White</HI> cou'd marry under twelve Moons after their Wive's Death; with which they seem'd satisfy'd, but made me Pro∣mise when that time was expir'd to change my Condition of Widower to that of Marry'd Man. I might have been ac∣commodated with a She-Companion if I had found any Inclination, but I evaded it as well as I could.</P>
<P>The Soil of the Island is very fruitful, and there's plenty of every thing.</P>
<P>I could not perceive that these <HI>Indians</HI> worship'd any thing, except the Moon: Which when at full, they would all ga∣ther together; and looking upward, stand gazing a considerable time, and then with one Consent pronounce a word which sounded like <HI>Hiu!</HI> This word they gene∣rally repeated three times. When they had done <HI>Stargazing,</HI> they would fall to Jumping and Capering like so many mad things. When that was over, they would retire to their several Hutts, and not stir out till Morning upon any account.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="376"/>
I ask'd <HI>Will</HI> (for that was the Name of him that could speak English, who was mighty proud to be call'd so) what Cere∣mony was it they perform'd after they were retir'd into their Hutts? But he an∣swer'd, <HI>Me no tell dat, Wife make much Noise, she no care for dat; when you have new Wife, you know what we do, but me no tell till den.</HI> What gave me a Curiosity to know, was, that <HI>Will</HI> told me that af∣ter the Ceremony was over, I must not offer to come out of my Hutt, nor come a nigh any of theirs; for if I did, they would kill me. The Hutt that was built for me, was order'd in another manner than their own, with a high Door made of Wicket; there's being so low, that an ordinary siz'd Man must have stoop'd to go in or out.</P>
<P>I us'd to go fish in their <HI>Canoes</HI> with 'em, where they would catch good store; and let it be what it would, the Cargo was divided among the whole Tribe, only he that caught 'em chose first.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Will,</HI> that as soon as ever a Ship arriv'd there, I did design to imbark in her in order to pursue my Voyage: But he
<PB N="163" REF="377"/>
told me I must take care not to let any other of the <HI>Indians</HI> know it, for they would never suffer any one to go from 'em, after they had been once settled a∣mong 'em. How do you know that, says I? Have you had any Talk with 'em con∣cerning me? He told me he had not, but it was their way: For he gave me to un∣derstand, that about six Years ago there was four Men left on shore upon their Island, by reason of their Vessel driving out to Sea by a Hurricano; and these four Men settled among 'em, and marry'd <HI>Indian</HI> Wives, and had Children by 'em. But at any time when a Ship came into the Bay, they were hurry'd a great way up in the Country, and detain'd there till the Ships were gone, and then liv'd with 'em as before. But a small Vessel put∣ting in there by Night, the English-Men spy'd it before any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were got to the Shore side, conversing with the Crew of the Vessel before the <HI>Indians</HI> found 'em out. But when they saw 'em talking together, they were mightily enrag'd. The four Men went on Board the Vessel to make merry with
<PB N="164" REF="378"/>
their Countrymen, and afterwards came on shore again, and made it no Secret, that they design'd to go on Board that Vessel in order to go to their own Coun∣try. The <HI>Indians</HI> took no notice for the present: But the Day they design'd to imbark, they set upon the Vessel with their <HI>Canoes,</HI> and kill'd every Person on Board it. When they had done that, they took as many things out of her as they had occasion for, and set her a-drift. He told me that the four <HI>Englishmen</HI> were the first that taught 'em to use Fire-Arms, and in the Ship they took, they had seve∣ral Muskets and Quantities of Powder and Shot. But carrying the Powder to their Hutts, a Boy met 'em smoaking in a Cane, they call a Smoaking Cane, and by some Accident the Fire caught hold of the Powder, and blew it up, with the Death of Eight <HI>Indians,</HI> and wounding several others. After they had brought every thing up to their Hutts, they took the Wives of the four Sailors (the <HI>Indians</HI> with their Children) and shot 'em to Death with Arrows. This is the Sense of the Story <HI>Indian Will</HI> told me, which
<PB N="165" REF="379"/>
was pretty hard to pick out too, consi∣dering his manner of telling it. The Re∣lation made me very uneasy, yet put me upon thinking to make my Escape the first Opportunity. I waited a full Month before I could see any Vessel, but at last one came into the Harbour. I perceiv'd they came in order to get Wood by hoist∣ing out their long Boat; but as I was ob∣serving 'em, I was seiz'd by several <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and carry'd at least six Miles up in the Country, in order to be secur'd till the Ship should be gone. I began to de∣spair now of ever getting away, being it was natural to suppose, that they would be more watchful over me for the future. Besides, I did not know but they would use me after another manner, and not let me have so much Liberty as I had before. I wanted for nothing in my Confinement, and was only guarded by four <HI>Indians</HI> that went to sleep when I did. I once thought I might make my Escape whilst they slept; but afterwards repented that Thought, in knowing if they should chance to wake, I was certainly a dead Man; for <HI>Indian Will</HI> told me, as I was carrying away, that
<PB N="166" REF="380"/>
the <HI>Indians</HI> had Orders to shoot me if I offer'd to make my Escape: Besides, I should have found it difficult enough to have known my way, especially in the Dark; for they carry'd me to a place that I had never been at before. I had been here four Days, and had given over all Hopes of my Liberty, and began to call together my scatter'd Thoughts, that were fluster'd upon that Occasion; when, on the fourth Day, about Noon, I was agreeably surpriz'd with <HI>English</HI> Voices, I began to prick up my Ears, and wish'd they might come to the place where I was. I was not long in expecting of 'em; for one of 'em spying the Hutt, where I was, call'd out to the others to come along; for here's an <HI>Indian</HI>'s Hutt, says he, we'll go in it, and see what they'll give us. With that they immediately came in before two of my <HI>Indians</HI> could hide me, (the other two be∣ing gone in the Morning to the Village:) As soon as ever I saw 'em, tho' Strangers, I could not forbear showing my Transports at the sight of my Countrymen. They were mightily surpriz'd to see me; and when I told 'em my Condition, they said
<PB N="167" REF="381"/>
they would have me along with 'em in spight of their Teeth: But I told 'em that was very dangerous; for if these <HI>Indians</HI> should raise the Village (that lay within a Mile of the Shore) we should all lose our Lives. Some advis'd to knock 'em on the Head; but I could not agree to that, for these were <HI>Indians</HI> that never injur'd me. Two of my Countrymen had got a cou∣ple of Spaw-water Flasks fill'd with Rum, upon the sight of which a Thought came into my Head, that seem'd the most likely to compass my Design. I told my Coun∣trymen if we could make the <HI>Indians</HI> drunk, there might be some hopes of get∣ting off without either hurting them, or endangering our selves. We drank to one another, and the <HI>Indians</HI> did us Reason in pledging us; for I believe out of the two Flasks they drank one and three quarters. It soon began to work with them, and they got up and fell a Dancing most mad∣ly, and a while after drop'd down dead Drunk. We resolv'd to tye 'em Hands and Feet, that if they awak'd, they might not follow us, and raise the whole Body of <HI>Indians</HI> upon us. With the help of
<PB N="168" REF="382"/>
our Garters we ty'd 'em fast enough with∣out waking 'em, and made the best of our way towards the Sea-side. All the Danger we ran was in meeting with any of the other <HI>Indians,</HI> but we happily avoided 'em, and came to the place where the Boat lay. The Ship was ready to Sail, having got their Wood and Water aboard; and these eight Men were those that had been la∣bouring hard in cutting Wood, &amp;c. and so were resolv'd to go up the Country to view it, never having been farther than the place where they fell'd the Trees, and happily for me came to give me my Li∣berty, under Providence. As we were getting into the Boat to go on Board (the Ship having made a Waft in her Ancient,) <HI>Indian Will</HI> came running down almost out of Breath, and cry'd, Get quick in Ship, they come down presently kill all me go wid you de kill me else for tell you. We hurry'd away, and <HI>Indian Will</HI> with us, and got on Board in very good time; for before we were well under Sail, we could perceive at least Two Hundred <HI>In∣dians</HI> bringing their <HI>Canoes</HI> with 'em. We had a brisk Gale, so that they could not
<PB N="169" REF="383"/>
well overtake us; for they never go above two Leagues from shore. Nevertheless they put their <HI>Canoes</HI> in the Water, and began to paddle after us. The Captain was for Firing at 'em with our great Guns, but I perswaded him against it, by telling him it might be worse for other <HI>English</HI> Vessels that should come after us; and as they could not overtake us to do us any damage, it was best not to take any no∣tice of 'em. When we had lost sight of <HI>Dominico,</HI> I ask'd <HI>Indian Will</HI> the Reason of their endeavouring to detain all <HI>Whites</HI> in that clandestine Manner; and he gave me to know, that they fear'd if the <HI>Whites</HI> should know the Smallness of their Number, that they would put 'em all to Death, and seize upon the whole Island. The Ship that took us up was call'd the <HI>Twins</HI> from <HI>Caroline,</HI> Captain <HI>Fuller</HI> Com∣mander; she came then from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Jamaica.</HI> I took <HI>In∣dian Will</HI> as my Servant, and did design to give him some Cloaths, as soon as we arriv'd at <HI>Jamaica;</HI> but for the present I had none for my self, and made but an odd sort of a Figure. My Beard was
<PB N="170" REF="384"/>
pretty long, and being something incli∣ning to Red, look'd but oddly: My Li∣ning was all gone, so that my whole Dress consisted of a Hat, a Wastecoat, a pair of Breeches, and a pair of Shooes. The Captain was so kind to lend me a Shirt, and a pair of Stockings, and I got my Beard off, and once more look'd like a Christian. We made <HI>Jamaica</HI> without meeting with any thing material, and found the Fleet at Anchor. I went on Board the Admiral, and paid my Respects to him. which he took very kindly. I there once more met with my Friend Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> and the rest of my Companions who had given me over for lost; for Captain <HI>Walton</HI> told the Admiral and my Comrades, that I was certainly Murther'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI> I had all my Things restor'd me, that were brought in the <HI>Al∣bion</HI> Frigate, that arriv'd about a Week before me with the Stores of the Fleet, after she had been in the Dock at <HI>Plimouth</HI> and well mended. She also brought News of War being declared between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and the Death of his Sacred Majesty King <HI>William</HI> the Third, of Glo∣rious
<PB N="171" REF="385"/>
Memory, and the Coronation of her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne. July</HI> the 11<HI>th</HI> 1702, The whole Fleet set out from <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> in order for a Descent upon St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> as was suppos'd, but things not answering, the Admiral, in the <HI>Breda</HI> Captain <HI>Fog,</HI> with six other Men of War, <HI>viz. Defiance,</HI> Captain <HI>Kirby; Greenwich,</HI> Captain <HI>Wade; Windsor,</HI> Captain <HI>Consta∣ble; Ruby,</HI> Captain <HI>Walton; Falmouth,</HI> Captain <HI>Vincent;</HI> and <HI>Pendennis,</HI> Captain <HI>Hudson,</HI> in quest of Monsieur <HI>du Casse,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Commodore, that was design'd for <HI>America</HI> with Ammunition, Forces, Provision, and Money to pay the Garri∣sons, besides several Governors to be put in the room of others that were call'd back. We directed our Course to Port <HI>Leogaon,</HI> where <HI>du Casse</HI> was expected every Day: But when we came there we were inform'd that <HI>du Casse</HI> was Sail'd for <HI>Carthagena,</HI> upon which we directed our Course for that place, after having taken three Ships, one of Sixteen, another of Thirty, call'd <HI>Reine de Angelos,</HI> or the Queen of Angels, and another of Six Guns richly Laden, beside three Barks
<PB N="172" REF="386"/>
taken by Captain <HI>Constable,</HI> in the <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> and a fourth Sunk, likewise a <HI>French</HI> Man of War of Forty Guns burnt.</P>
<P>On the 19<HI>th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> O. S. about 10 in the Morning, we discover'd Ten Sail to the Eastward of us, which we bore up to, and found 'em to be the Fleet we were in quest of; tho' there was Ten Sail, yet there was but Six Fighting Ships, the rest were Store-Ships which made the best of their Way; so when the Admiral came up with 'em we had but Six to Engage. The Line of Battle was form'd about three in the Afternoon, The <HI>Defiance</HI> led the Van, the <HI>Windsor</HI> second, and <HI>Ben∣bow</HI> in the <HI>Breda</HI> the third. These three kept pretty close together, but the other four were a League behind. At four in the Afternoon we began the Engagement, but the <HI>Defiance</HI> after firing three Guns bore away to Leeward and lay there out of Gun-shot all the Evening, so that the whole strength of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay upon the Admiral and the <HI>Windsor</HI> till it was Dark. In the Night the <HI>Windsor</HI> fell foul of our Ship, which startled a great many, that were not upon Deck, as believing it
<PB N="173" REF="387"/>
might be a <HI>French</HI> Fireship, tho' we knew they had not one in the Fleet: But Fear, as well as Passion, blends our Reason. The Wind chop'd about in the Night, so that we had the Weather-gage of 'em; upon which we bore down upon 'em, and en∣gag'd for three Hours; but the <HI>Ruby,</HI> Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> was disabl'd, and order'd by the Admiral to make for <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> My Man <HI>Indian Will,</HI> who was on Board, dress'd like an <HI>European,</HI> was terribly frighted with the Noise of our Guns; and every time he saw the Flash of our Ene∣my's Cannon, he wou'd squat down upon the Deck, and lye flat upon his Belly for some time; one of our Men that was shot in the Guts lay expiring, and <HI>Indian Will</HI> was getting away out of Danger, he said, but unfortunately stumbled over the Dy∣ing Man, who in the Pangs of Death grasp'd <HI>Will</HI> so fast, that he cry'd out lustily for Help, but it was more than I could do to unclench his Hand till he was quite Dead, and then we releas'd poor <HI>Will,</HI> frighted out of his Wits, who could not be prevail'd upon to come upon Deck any more till we told him we had done
<PB N="174" REF="388"/>
Fighting. We took one Ship from the <HI>French,</HI> that they had taken from the <HI>En∣glish</HI> in their Voyage. The Fight lasted six Days, on and off; but the Admiral being wounded in the Thigh, and finding that, <HI>Wade, Kirby,</HI> and <HI>Hudson,</HI> did not care for Fighting, we left 'em, after dis∣abling two of their Ships, and directed our Course back to <HI>Portugal.</HI> As soon as we arriv'd there, the Admiral sent Or∣ders to confine Captain <HI>Constable, Wade, Kirby,</HI> and <HI>Hudson,</HI> and Summon'd a Court-Marshal, Try'd 'em, and found 'em Guilty of Cowardice, excluding <HI>Constable;</HI> and accordingly the other Three were sent to <HI>England</HI> to receive Sentence of Death, which was executed upon Two of 'em. The Third, Captain <HI>Hudson</HI> dy'd in the Voyage, and so prevented an Ignominious Death. How easy had it been for the <HI>English</HI> to have taken the <HI>French,</HI> if they had been unanimous; but such an Instance of Pusillanimity is not to be found in the Records of the Navy.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 14<HI>th,</HI> 1702, We were all concern'd with the News of Admiral <HI>Ben∣bow</HI>'s Death, who dy'd of the Wound in
<PB N="175" REF="389"/>
his Thigh that he receiv'd in the Engage∣ment with Monsieur <HI>du Casse,</HI> lamented by all. I observ'd there was a perfect Groan in every Ship in the Fleet, when the Admiral's Flag was Lor'd with a Whiff, which is the Custom at Sea. He was bury'd at <HI>Kingstown,</HI> where he dy'd. He had several rich <HI>Plantations</HI> in <HI>Jamai∣ca,</HI> and many Slaves. He had made five successful Voyages to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and re∣turn'd home laden with Wealth and Ho∣nour; but the sixth prov'd fatal to Him. He had a perfect Knowledge in the Na∣vigation of <HI>America,</HI> having been several Years Captain of a Privateer there. He was a Man belov'd of both Officers and Common Sailors; a Person of true Cou∣rage, and Fortitude: For when he was wounded in the Engagement, he order'd the Carpenters to make him a Cradle, that he might be upon Deck to give Orders. Nothing went more near his Heart than this unfortunate Expedition; and the Sur∣geons reported, that the Grief he conceiv'd from it, hinder'd the healing of his Wound, which was given with a Musket-Ball, and
<PB N="176" REF="390"/>
not a Chain-Shot, as has been reported in our Publick Papers. Admiral <HI>Martin,</HI> as being the eldest Officer, supply'd his Place till Admiral <HI>Whetstone</HI> arriv'd in the <HI>Boyne.</HI> My very good Friend Captain <HI>Hercules Mitchell,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Strombelo</HI> Fire∣ship, was made Captain of the <HI>Windsor;</HI> and Admiral <HI>Benbow</HI> being Dead, I re∣mov'd my self, with Captain <HI>Fog</HI>'s leave, into his Ship. The Fleet set Sail with the Merchant Ships for <HI>England, March</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> 1703, and met with nothing worthy of Note.</P>
<P>On <HI>May</HI> the 5<HI>th,</HI> we enter'd St. <HI>John</HI>'s Harbour in <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and stay'd there till <HI>May</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> then set Sail for the <HI>Bay of Bulls,</HI> a convenient Harbour to Wood and Water in the same Island. After we had provided every thing we wanted there, we weigh'd Anchor in or∣der to Sail for <HI>England.</HI> In weighing our best <HI>Bowre</HI> (an Anchor so call'd) the Nippers giving way, the Captstorn-Barrs kill'd us three Men, and broke the Back of a fourth, who dy'd in a Week after.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="391"/>
<HI>November</HI> the 1st, we were separated from the Fleet by a dreadful Storm, that threw all our Masts by the Board, and our Boltsprit was also Sprung, but we fish'd that which preserv'd it. We were in a very pitiful Condition, and I am sure in great Danger, for I really heard some of the Sailors at their Prayers. We lost two of our Men, who fell with the Main-mast overboard. The Storm lasted for two Days, and the Weather continu'd so Hazy we could not take our Obser∣vations. We put up our Jury-Masts, but could make but little Way. We had Captain <HI>Titchburn</HI>'s Company of <HI>Marines,</HI> and Major <HI>Bowls,</HI> Major of the Regiment that did belong to Colonel <HI>Jones,</HI> who dy'd in the Voyage, so that having above our Com∣plement, our Provision began to be at an Ebb, which obliged us all to come to half-allowance, and half a Pint of Water a Day to each Man, for we did not know how long we should be out at Sea; but we made <HI>Ireland</HI> beyond all our Hopes <HI>November</HI> the 20<HI>th,</HI> and got safe into <HI>Gallaway</HI> Harbour on the 23<HI>d,</HI> and it was a great Providence we did so; for on the 25<HI>th</HI> there arose such a violent Storm, that must have inevitably destroyed us. This was that fatal Hurricane that did so much Dammage in <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. There was two Ships in <HI>Gallaway</HI> Harbour that was stranded, and it was allowed by every Body that we should have run the same Fate, if our Masts had been standing; but having none but Jury-Masts, which we took down when the Storm began to be pretty high, so that the Wind could not have the same Power over us; neither do I think shat the Storm was so violent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by all Description, as it was in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> We stay'd at <HI>Gallaway</HI> four Months, and in that time we had got Masts up and repair'd our other Dammages. While the Ship was fitting up, I lay on shore in the Town. <HI>Gallaway</HI> is a

neat well-fortify'd Town, as big as <HI>Salisbury,</HI> yet has but one Church. Every thing is very cheap there. I had my Board in a private House for four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, and seldom Din'd without two or three Dishes at Table: We bought the best <HI>French</HI> Wine for Fourteen pence <HI>per</HI> Quart, and sometimes under. We set Sail from <HI>Gallaway, February</HI> the 27<HI>th,</HI> 1704, and arrived safely at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Thus after many Misfortunes and Ha∣zards I once more set my Feet upon my dear na∣tive Country (accompany'd with <HI>Indian Will,</HI> who still lives with me, and proves an honest faithful Servant; and I have taken Pains to have him in∣structed in the Christian Religion, and likewise to have him Christned by the Name of <HI>William Domi∣nico,</HI> from the Island that he came from;) and tho' warn'd by many Dangers I had run, I could not forbear making three Voyages more, but yet in a Station different from what I went before. But as they were but common Voyages, that is nothing extraordinary happening, I shall conclude with my Prayers and Thanks to Heaven for the many Mercies I have received; wishing long Life and Happiness to my King, Prosperity, Peace, and Riches to my Coun∣try, and a hearty Union among my Fellow Subjects.</P>
