<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>YNTHIO, Eugenius</HI> and <HI>Philander</HI> had retired together from the town to a country village, that lies upon the <HI>Thames.</HI> Their design was to pass away the heats of the Summer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong the fresh breezes, that rise from the river, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the agreeable mixture of shades and fountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which the whole country naturally abounds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were all three very well versed in the po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er parts of learning, and had travelled into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost refined nations of <HI>Europe</HI>: so that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere capable of entertaining themselves on a
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
thousand different subjects without running into the common topics of defaming publick parties, or particular persons. As they were intimate friends they took the freedom to dissent from one another in discourse, or upon occasion to speak a <HI>Latin</HI> sentence without fearing the imputation of pedantry or ill-breeding.</P>
<P>They were one evening taking a walk together in the fields when their discourse accidentally fell upon several unprofitable parts of learning. It was <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s humour to run down every thing that was rather for ostentation than use. He was still preferring good sense to arts and sciences, and often took a pleasure to appear ignorant, that he might the better turn to ridicule those that valued themselves on their books and studies, though at the same time one might very well see that he could not have attacked many parts of learning so successfully, had not he borrowed his assistances from them. After having rally'd a set or two of <HI>Virtuoso's,</HI> he fell upon the Me∣dallists.</P>
<P>These gentlemen, says he, value themselves upon being critics in Rust, and will undertake to tell you the different ages of it, by its colour. They are possessed with a kind of learned avarice, and are for getting together hoards of such mony only as was current among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>La∣tins.</HI> There are several of them that are better acquainted with the faces of the <HI>Antonines,</HI> than of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> and would rather chuse to count out a Sum in Sesterces, than in pounds sterling, I have heard of one in <HI>Italy</HI> that used to swear <HI>by the head of Otho.</HI> Nothing can be pleasanter than to see a circle of these <HI>Virtuoso's</HI> about a cabinet
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
of Medals, descanting upon the value, rarity and authenticalness of the several pieces that lie before them. One takes up a coin of gold, and after having well weighed the figures and inscription, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ells you very gravely, if it were brass, it would be invaluable. Another falls a ringing a <HI>Pescen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius Niger,</HI> and judiciously distinguishes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound of it to be modern. A third desires you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o observe well the <HI>Toga</HI> on such a reverse, and asks you whether you can in conscience believe the sleeve of it to be of the true <HI>Roman</HI> cut.</P>
<P>I must confess, says <HI>Philander,</HI> the knowledge of Medals has most of those disadvantages that can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender a science ridiculous, to such as are not well versed in it. Nothing is more easy than to represent as impertinences any parts of learning that have no immediate relation to the happiness or convenience of mankind. When a man spends his whole life among the Stars and Planets, or lays out a twelve-month on the spots in the Sun, however noble his speculations may be, they are very apt to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto burlesque. But it is still more natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>augh at such studies as are employed on low and vulgar objects. What curious observations have been made on Spiders, Lobsters, and Cockle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hells? yet the very naming of them is almost suf∣ficient to turn them into raillery. It is no won∣der therefore that the science of Medals, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s charged with so many unconcerning parts of knowledge, and built on such mean materials, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould appear ridiculous to those that have not ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the pains to examine it.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenius</HI> was very attentive to what <HI>Philander</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid on the subject of Medals. He was one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavoured rather to be agreeable than shining
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
in conversation, for which reason he was more beloved, though not so much admired as <HI>Cynthio.</HI> I must confess, says he, I find my self very much inclined to speak against a sort of study that I know nothing of. I have however one strong Prejudice in favour of it, that <HI>Philander</HI> has thought it worth his while to employ some time upon it. I am glad then, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that I have thrown him on a science of which I have long wished to hear the Usefulness. There, says <HI>Philander,</HI> you must excuse me. At present you do not know but it may have its usefulness. But should I endeavour to convince you of it, I might fail in my attempt, and so render my sci∣ence still more contemptible. On the contrary, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> we are already so persuaded of the unprofitableness of your science, that you can but leave us where you find us, but if you succeed you increase the number of your party. Well, says <HI>Philander,</HI> in hopes of making two such considerable proselytes, I am very well content to talk away an evening with you on the subject; but on this condition, that you will communicate your thoughts to me freely when you dissent from me, or have any difficulties that you think me capable of removing. To make use of the li∣berty you give us, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I must tell you what I believe surprizes all beginners as well as my self. We are apt to think your Medallists a little fantastical in the different prices they set upon their coins, without any regard to the an∣cient value or the metal of which they are com∣posed. A silver Medal, for example, shall be more esteemed than a golden one, and a piece of brass than either. To answer you, says <HI>Philander,</HI> it
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he language of a Medallist, you are not to look upon a cabinet of Medals as a treasure of mony, but of knowledge, nor must you fancy any charms in gold, but in the figures and inscriptions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at adorn it. The intrinsic value of an old coin does not consist in its metal but its erudition. It is the Device that has raised the species, so that at present an <HI>As</HI> or an <HI>Obolus</HI> may carry a higher price than a <HI>Denarius</HI> or a <HI>Drachma</HI>; and a piece of mony that was not worth a peny fif∣teen hundred years ago, may be now rated at fifty crowns, or perhaps a hundred guineas. I find, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that to have a relish for anci∣ent coins it is necessary to have a contempt of the modern. But I am afraid you will never be able, with all your Medallic eloquence, to per∣suade <HI>Eugenius</HI> and my self that it is better to have a pocket full of <HI>Otho's</HI> and <HI>Gordians</HI> than of <HI>Jaco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us's</HI> or <HI>Louis d'ors.</HI> This however we shall be judges of, when you have let us know the several uses of old coins.</P>
<P>The first and most obvious one, says <HI>Philan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,</HI> is the shewing us the Faces of all the great persons of antiquity. A cabinet of Medals is a collection of pictures in miniature. <HI>Juvenal</HI> calls them very humorously,
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Concisum argentum in titulos, faciesque minutas.</L>
<BIBL>Sat. 5.</BIBL></Q>
You here see the <HI>Alexanders, Caesars, Pompeys, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rajans,</HI> and the whole catalogue of Heroes; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho have many of them so distinguished them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves from the rest of mankind that we almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook upon them as another species. It is an a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reeable amusement to compare in our own
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
thoughts the face of a great Man with the chara∣cter that authors have given us of him, and to try if we can find out in his looks and features either the haughty, cruel, or merciful temper that discovers it self in the history of his actions. We find too on Medals the representations of Ladies that have given occasion to whole volumes on the account only of a face. We have here the pleasure to ex∣amine their looks and dresses, and to survey at leisure those beauties that have sometimes been the happiness or misery of whole kingdoms: Nor do you only meet the faces of such as are famous in history, but of several whose names are not to be found any where except on Medals. Some of the Emperors, for example, have had Wives, and some of them Children, that no authors have mentioned. We are therefore obliged to the study of coins for having made new discoveries to the learned, and given them information of such persons as are to be met with on no other kind of records. You must give me leave, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to reject this last use of Medals. I do not think it worth while to trouble my self with a person's name or face that receives all his repu∣tation from the mint, and would never have been known in the world had there not been such things as Medals. A man's memory finds suf∣ficient employment on such as have really signa∣lized themselves by their great actions, without charging it self with the names of an insignificant people whose whole history is written on the edges of an old coin.</P>
<P>If you are only for such persons as have made a noise in the world, says <HI>Philander,</HI> you have on Medals a long list of heathen Deities, distinguish∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
from each other by their proper titles and or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aments. You see the copies of several statues that have had the politest nations of the world f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll down before them. You have here too seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l persons of a more thin and shadowy nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Hope, Constancy, Fidelity, Abundance, Ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, Virtue, Eternity, Justice, Moderation, Hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness, and in short a whole creation of the like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maginary substances. To these you may add the Genies of nations, provinces, cities, high-ways, and the like Allegorical Beings. In devices of this nature one sees a pretty poetical invention, and may often find as much thought on the re∣verse of a Medal as in a Canto of <HI>Spenser.</HI> Not to interrupt you, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I fancy it is this use of Medals that has recommended them to se∣veral history-painters, who perhaps without this assistance would have found it very difficult to have invented such an airy species of beings, when they are obliged to put a moral virtue into co∣lours, or to find out a proper dress for a passion. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is doubtless for this reason, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that Painters have not a little contributed to bring the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udy of Medals in vogue. For not to mention several others, <HI>Caraccio</HI> is said to have assisted <HI>A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etine</HI> by designs that he took from the <HI>Spintriae</HI> of <HI>Tiberius. Raphael</HI> had thoroughly studied the figures on old Coins. <HI>Patin</HI> tells us that <HI>Lo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>run</HI> had done the same. And it is well known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <HI>Rubens</HI> had a noble collection of Medals in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn possession. But I must not quit this head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore I tell you, that you see on Medals not on∣ly the names and persons of Emperors, Kings, consuls, Pro-consuls, Praetors, and the like cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acters of importance, but of some of the Poets,
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
and of several who had won the prizes at the Olympic games. It was a noble time, says <HI>Cyn∣thio,</HI> when Trips and <HI>Cornish</HI> hugs could make a man immortal. How many Heroes would <HI>Moor-fields</HI> have furnished out in the days of old? A fellow that can now only win a hat or a belt, had he lived among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> might have had his face stampt upon their Coins. But these were the wise ancients, who had more esteem for a <HI>Milo</HI> than a <HI>Homer,</HI> and heapt up greater Honours on <HI>Pindar</HI>'s Jockies, than on the Poet himself. But by this time I suppose you have drawn up all your medallic people, and indeed they make a much more formidable body than I could have imagined. You have shewn us all conditions, sexes and ages, emperors and empresses, men and children, gods and wrestlers. Nay you have con∣jured up persons that exist no where else but on old Coins, and have made our Passions and Vir∣tues and Vices visible. I could never have thought that a cabinet of Medals had been so well peopled. But in the next place, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> as we see on coins the different Faces of persons, we see on them too their different Ha∣bits and Dresses, according to the mode that pre∣vailed in the several ages when the Medals were stampt. This is another use, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that in my opinion contributes rather to make a man learned than wise, and is neither capable of plea∣sing the understanding or imagination. I know there are several supercilious Critics that will treat an author with the greatest contempt imagi∣nable, if he fancies the old <HI>Romans</HI> wore a girdle, and are amazed at a man's ignorance, who be∣lieves the <HI>Toga</HI> had any Sleeves to it till the de∣clension
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Now I would fain know the great importance of this kind of learning, and why it should not be as noble a task to write upon a Bib and hanging-sleeves, as on the <HI>Bulla</HI> and <HI>Praetexta.</HI> The reason is, that we are familiar with the names of the one, and meet with the other no where but in learned authors. An Antiquary will scorn to mention a pinner or a night-rail, a petticoat or a manteau; but will talk as gravely as a father of the church on the <HI>Vitta</HI> and <HI>Peplus,</HI> the <HI>Stola</HI> and <HI>Instita.</HI> How would an old <HI>Roman</HI> laugh, were it possible for him to see the solemn dissertations that have been made on these weighty subjects! To set them in their natural light, let us fancy, if you please, that about a thousand years hence, some profound author shall write a learned treatise on the Ha∣bit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the present age, distinguished into the fol∣lowing Titles and Chapters.

I must confess, says <HI>Eugenius</HI> interrupting him, the knowledge of these affairs is in it self very lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e improving, but as it is impossible without it to understand several parts of your ancient au∣thors, it certainly hath its use. It is pity indeed there is not a nearer way of coming at it. I have sometimes fancied it would not be an imperti∣nent design to make a kind of an old <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
wardrobe, where you should see <HI>Toga's</HI> and <HI>Tuni∣ca's,</HI> the <HI>Chlamys</HI> and <HI>Trabea,</HI> and in short all the different vests and ornaments that are so often mentioned in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> authors. By this means a man would comprehend better and remember much longer the shape of an ancient garment, than he possibly can from the help of tedious quotations and descriptions. The design says <HI>Philander,</HI> might be very useful, but after what models would you work? <HI>Sigonius,</HI> for example, will tell you that the <HI>Vestis Trabeat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was of such a particular fashion, <HI>Scaliger</HI> is fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another, and <HI>Dacier</HI> thinks them both in the wrong. These are, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> I suppose the names of three <HI>Roman</HI> taylors: for is it possible men of learning can have any disputes of this na∣ture? May not we as well believe that hereafter the whole learned world will be divided upon the make of a modern pair of breeches? And yet, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the Critics have fallen as fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon each other for matters of the same moment But as to this point, where the Make of the gar∣ment is controverted, let them, if they can find cloth enough, work after all the most probable fashions. To enlarge the design, I would have another room for the old <HI>Roman</HI> instruments o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> war, where you might see the <HI>Pilum</HI> and the shield, the eagles, ensigns, helmets, battering-rams and trophies, in a word, all the ancient military furniture in the same manner as it might have been in an Arsenal of old <HI>Rome.</HI> A third apart∣ment should be a kind of Sacristie for altars idols, sacrificing instruments, and other religious utensils. Not to be tedious, one might make a magazine for all sorts of antiquities, that would
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>
show a man in an afternoon more than he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earn out of books in a twelve-month. This would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut short the whole study of antiquities, and perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much more useful to Universities than those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollections of Whale-bone and Crocodile-skins in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich they commonly abound. You will find it very difficult, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to persuade those soci∣eties of learned men to fall in with your project. They will tell you that things of this importance must not be taken on trust; you ought to learn them among the Classic Authors and at the foun∣tain-head. Pray consider what a figure a man would make in the republick of letters, should he appeal to your University-wardrobe, when they expect a sentence out of the <HI>Re Vestiaria?</HI> or how do you think a man that has read <HI>Vegetius</HI> will relish your <HI>Roman</HI> Arsenal? In the mean time, says <HI>Philander,</HI> you find on Medals every thing that you could meet with in your magazine of antiquities, and when you have built your arse∣nals, wardrobes, and sacristies, it is from Medals that you must fetch their furniture. It is here too that you see the figures of several instruments of musick, mathematics and mechanics. One might make an entire gally out of the plans that are to be met with on the reverses of several old coins. Nor are they only charged with Things but with many ancient Customs, as sacrifices, tri∣umphs, congiaries, allocutions, decursions, lecti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erniums, and a thousand other antiquated names <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ceremonies that we should not have had so j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st a notion of, were they not still preserved on Coins. I might add under this head of antiqui∣ties, that we find on Medals the manner of spel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng in the old <HI>Roman</HI> inscriptions. That is, says
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
<HI>Cynthio,</HI> we find that <HI>Felix</HI> is never written with an <HI>oe</HI> dipthongue, and that in <HI>Augustus</HI>'s days <HI>Civis</HI> stood for <HI>Cives,</HI> with other secrets in Or∣thography of the same importance.</P>
<P>To come then to a more weighty use, says <HI>Philander,</HI> it is certain that Medals give a very great light to history, in confirming such passages as are true in old Authors, in settling such as are told after different manners, and in recording such as have been omitted. In this case a cabinet of Medals is a body of history. It was indeed the best way in the world to perpetuate the me∣mory of great actions, thus to coin out the life of an Emperor, and to put every great exploit in∣to the mint. It was a kind of Printing, before the art was invented. It is by this means that Mon∣sieur <HI>Vaillant</HI> has disembroiled a history that was lost to the world before his time, and out of a short collection of Medals has given us a chroni∣cle of the Kings of <HI>Syria.</HI> For this too is an ad∣vantage Medals have over books, that they tell their story much quicker, and sum up a whole volume in twenty or thirty reverses. They are indeed the best epitomes in the world, and let you see with one cast of an eye the substance of above a hundred pages. Another use of Medals is, that they not only shew you the actions of an Emperor, but at the same time mark out the year in which they were performed. Every exploit has its date set to it. A series of an Emperor's Coins is his life digested into annals. Historians seldom break their relation with a mixture of chronology, nor distribute the particulars of an Emperor's story into the several years of his reign: or where they do it they often differ in their seve∣ral
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
periods. Here therefore it is much safer to quote a Medal than an Author, for in this case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou do not appeal to a <HI>Suetonius</HI> or a <HI>Lampri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> but to the Emperor himself, or to the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senate. Besides that a Coin is in no danger of having its characters altered by copiers and transcribers. This I must confess, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> may in some cases be of great moment, but considering the subjects on which your chro∣nologers are generally employed, I see but little use that rises from it. For example, what signi∣fies it to the world whether such an Elephant ap∣peared in the Amphi-theatre in the second or the third year of <HI>Domitian?</HI> Or what am I the wiser for knowing that <HI>Trajan</HI> was in the fifth year of his Tribuneship when he entertained the people with such a Horse-race or Bull-baiting? Yet it is the fixing of these great periods that gives a man the first rank in the republic of letters, and re∣commends him to the world for a person of va∣rious reading and profound erudition.</P>
<P>You must always give your men of great reading leave to show their talents on the meanest subjects, says <HI>Eugenius</HI>; it is a kind of shooting at rovers: where a man lets fly his arrow without taking any aim, to shew his strength. But there is one advantage, says he, turning to <HI>Philander,</HI> that seems to me very considerable, although your Medallists sel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om throw it into the account, which is the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lp to memory one finds in Medals: for my own part I am very much embarrassed in the names and ranks of the several <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and find it difficult to recollect upon occasion the different parts of their history: but your Medal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts upon the first naming of an Emperor will
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>
immediately tell you his age, family and life. To remember where he enters in the succession, they only consider in what part of the cabinet he lies; and by runinng over in their thoughts such a par∣ticular drawer, will give you an account of all the remarkable parts of his reign.</P>
<P>I thank you, says <HI>Philander,</HI> for helping me to an use that perhaps I should not have thought on. But there is another of which I am sure you could not be but sensible when you were at <HI>Rome.</HI> I must own to you it surprized me to see my <HI>Ci∣ceroni</HI> so well acquainted with the busts and sta∣tues of all the great people of antiquity. There was not an Emperor or Empress but he knew by sight, and as he was seldom without Medals in his pocket, he would often shew us the same face on an old Coin that we saw in the Statue. He would discover a <HI>Commodus</HI> through the disguise of the club and lion's skin, and find out such a one to be <HI>Livia</HI> that was dressed up like a <HI>Ceres.</HI> Let a bust be never so disfigured, they have a thousand marks by which to decipher it. They will know a <HI>Zenobia</HI> by the sitting of her Dia∣dem, and will distinguish the <HI>Faustina's</HI> by their different way of tying up their hair. Oh! Sir, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> they will go a great deal farther, they will give you the name and titles of a Sta∣tue that has lost his nose and ears; or if there is but half a beard remaining, will tell you at first sight who was the owner of it. Now I must con∣fess to you, I used to fancy they imposed upon me an Emperor or Empress at pleasure, rather than appear ignorant.</P>
<P>All this however is easily learnt from Medals, says <HI>Philander,</HI> where you may see likewise the
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
plans of many the most considerable buildings of Old <HI>Rome.</HI> There is an ingenious Gentleman of our own nation extremely well versed in this stu∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who has a design of publishing the whole hi∣story of Architecture, with its several improve∣ments and decays as it is to be met with on an∣cient Coins. He has assured me that he has ob∣served all the nicety of proportion in the figures of the different orders that compose the buildings on the best preserved Medals. You here see the copies of such Ports and triumphal Arches as there are not the least traces of in the places where they once stood. You have here the models of seve∣ral ancient Temples, though the Temples them∣selves, and the Gods that were worshipped in them, are perished many hundred years ago. Or if there are still any foundations or ruines of for∣mer edifices, you may learn from Coins what was their Architecture when they stood whole and entire. These are buildings with the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> could not demolish, that are infinite∣ly more durable than stone or marble, and will perhaps last as long as the earth it self. They are in short so many real monuments of Brass.</P>

day together from one ruin to another, he at last brought us to the <HI>Rotunda,</HI> And this, says he, is the most valuable Antiquity in <HI>Italy,</HI> notwith∣standing it is so entire.</P>
<P>The same kind of fancy, says <HI>Philander,</HI> has formerly gained upon several of your Medallists, who were for hoording up such pieces of money only as had been half consumed by time or rust. There were no Coins pleased them more than those which had passed through the hands of an old <HI>Roman</HI> Clipper. I have read an Author of this taste that compares a ragged Coin to a tattered Colours. But to come again to our Subject. As we find on Medals the plans of several buildings that are now demolished, we see on them too the Models of many ancient Statues that are now lost. There are several Reverses which are own∣ed to be the representations of antique figures, and I question not but there are many others that were formed on the like Models, though at pre∣sent they lie under no suspicion of it. The <HI>Her∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les Farnese,</HI> the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI> the <HI>Apollo</HI> in the <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and the famous <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> on horse-back, which are perhaps the four most beautiful Statues extant, make their appearance all of them on ancient Medals, though the figures that represent them were never thought to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pies of statues till the statues themselves were discovered. There is no question, I think, but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> same reflexion may extend it self to antique P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctures: for I doubt not but in the designs of se∣veral <HI>Greek</HI> Medals in particular, one might of∣ten see the hand of an <HI>Apelles</HI> or <HI>Protogenes,</HI> were we as well acquainted with their works as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are with <HI>Titian</HI>'s or <HI>Vandike</HI>'s. I might here
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
make a much greater show of the Usefulness of Medals, if I would take the method of others, and prove to you that all arts and sciences receive a considerable illustration from this study. I must however tell you, that Medals and the Civil Law, as we are assured by those who are well read in both, give a considerable light to each other, and that several old Coins are like so many maps for explaining of the ancient Geography. But besides the more solid parts of learning, there are severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little intimations to be met with on Medals tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are very pleasant to such as are conversant in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind of study. Should I tell you gravely, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without the help of Coins we should never have known which was the first of the Emperors tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wore a beard, or rode in stirrups, I might turt my science into ridicule. Yet it is certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there are a thousand little impertinencies of this na¦ture that are very gratifying to curiosity, tho' per∣haps not very improving to the understanding To see the dress that such an Empress delighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be drawn in, the titles that were most agreeabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to such an Emperor, the flatteries that he lay mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open to, the honours that he paid to his chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦dren, wives, predecessors, friends or collegue with the like particularities only to be met with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Medals, are certainly not a little pleasing to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inquisitive temper which is so natural to the min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of man.</P>
<P>I declare to you, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> you have ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nished me with the several parts of knowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that you have discovered on Medals. I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never fancy before this evening, that a Coin cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have any nobler use in it than to pay a recko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ing.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="23"/>You have not heard all yet, says <HI>Philander,</HI> there is still an advantage to be drawn from Me∣dals, which I am sure will heighten your esteem for them. It is indeed an use that no body has hitherto dwelt upon. If any of the Antiquaries have touched upon it, they have immediately quitted it, without considering it in its full latitude, light and extent. Not to keep you in suspence, I think there is a great affinity between Coins and Poetry, and that your Medallist and Critic are much nearer related than the world generally imagines. A reverse often clears up the passage of an old poet, as the poet often serves to unrid∣dle a reverse. I could be longer on this head, but I fear I have already tired you. Nay, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> since you have gone so far with us, we must beg you to finish your lecture, especial∣ly since you are on a subject, that I dare promise you will be very agreeable to <HI>Cynthio,</HI> who is so professed an admirer of the ancient poets. I must only warn you, that you do not charge your Coins with more uses than they can bear. It is generally the method of such as are in love with any particular science to discover all others in it. Who would imagine, for example, that archite∣cture should comprehend the knowledge of histo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, ethics, music, astronomy, natural philosophy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hysic and the civil law? Yet <HI>Vitruvius</HI> will give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou his reasons, such as they are, why a good ar∣chitect is master of these several arts and sciences. Sure, says <HI>Cynthio, Martial</HI> had never read <HI>Vitru∣vius</HI> when he threw the Cryer and the Architect into the same class.

Several of your Medallists will be here again a∣stonished at the wisdom of the ancients, that knew how to couch such excellent Precepts of morality under visible objects.

Gentlemen who have fixed this piece of morality on the three naked Sisters dancing hand in hand, would have found out as good a one for them, had there been four of them sitting at a distance from each other, and covered from head to foot. It is here therefore, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that the old Poets step in to the assistance of the Medallist, when they give us the same though in words as the masters of the <HI>Roman</HI> min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have done in figures. A man may see a meta∣phor or an allegory in picture, as well as rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them in a description. When therefore I con∣front a Medal with a Verse, I only shew yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same design executed by different hands, and appeal from one master to another of the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> age and taste. This is certainly a much sure way than to build on the interpretations of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> author who does not consider how the ancient used to think, but will be still inventing myste¦ries and applications out of his own fancy. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make my self more intelligible, I find a shield o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the reverse of an Emperor's Coin, designed as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compliment to him from the senate of <HI>Rome.</HI> meet with the same metaphor in ancient poets t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> express protection or defence.

the next place, the figure of the shield being round it is an emblem of perfection, for <HI>Aristotle</HI> has said the round figure is the most perfect.

I am very well satisfied, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> by what you have said on this subject, that the Poets may contribute to the explication of such reverses as are purely emblematical, or when the persons are of that shadowy allegorical nature you have before men∣tioned, but I suppose there are many other re∣verses that represent things and persons of a more real existence. In this case too, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> a Poet lets you into the knowledge of a device better than a Prose-writer, as his de∣scriptions are often more diffuse, his story more naturally circumstanced, and his language en∣riched with a greater variety of epithets: So that you often meet with little hints and suggestions in a Poet that give a great illustration to the cu∣stoms, actions, ornaments, and all kinds of Antiqui∣ties that are to be met with on ancient Coins.

<HI>Latin</HI> Poets. He never thinks of the beauty of the thought or language, but is for searching in∣to what he calls the Erudition of the Author. He will turn you over all <HI>Virgil</HI> to find out the figure of an old <HI>Rostrum,</HI> and has the greatest esteem imaginable for <HI>Homer,</HI> because has given us the fashion of a <HI>Greek</HI> scepter. It is indeed odd enough to consider how all kinds of Readers find their account in the old Poets. Not only your men of the more refined or solid parts of Learning, but even your Alchymist and Fortune-teller will discover the secrets of their art in <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> This, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> is a pre∣judice of a very ancient standing. Read but <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>'s discourse on <HI>Homer,</HI> and you will see that the Iliad contains the whole circle of arts, and that <HI>Thales</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras</HI> stole all their philosophy out of this Poet's works. One would be amazed to see what pains he takes to prove that <HI>Homer</HI> understood all the figures in Rhetoric, before they were invented. I do not question, says <HI>Philander,</HI> were it possible for <HI>Homer</HI> to read his praises in this Author, but he would be as much surprized as ever Monsieur <HI>Jordain</HI> was when he had found he had talked Prose all his life-time without ever knowing what it was. But to finish the task you have set me, we may observe that not only the Virtues, and the like imaginary persons, but all the heathen Divinities appear generally in the same Dress among the Po∣ets that they wear in Medals. I must confess, I believe both the one and the other took the Mode from the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Statuaries. It will not perhaps be an improper transition to pass from the heathen gods to the several monsters of antiquity,
<PB N="33" REF="29"/>
as <HI>Chimaeras, Gorgons, Sphinxes,</HI> and many others that make the same figure in verse as on coins. It often happens too, that the Poet and the Se∣nate of <HI>Rome</HI> have both chosen the same Topic to flatter their Emperor upon, and have some∣times fallen upon the same thought. It is cer∣tain, they both of them lay upon the catch for a great action: It is no wonder therefore, that they were often engaged on one subject, the Medal and the Poem being nothing else but oc∣casional compliments to the Emperor. Nay, I question not but you may sometimes find certain passages among the Poets that relate to the par∣cular device of a Medal.</P>
<P>I wonder, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that your Medallists have not been as diligent in searching the Poets as the Historians, since I find they are so capable of enlightning their art. I would have some bo∣dy put the Muses under a kind of contribution to furnish out whatever they have in them that bears any relation to Coins. Though they taught us but the same things that might be learnt in other writings, they would at least teach us more agreeably, and draw several over to the study of Medals that would rather be instructed in verse than in prose. I am glad, says <HI>Philander,</HI> to hear you of this opinion, for to tell you truly, when I was at <HI>Rome,</HI> I took occasion to buy up many Imperial Medals that have any affinity with passages of the ancient Poets. So that I have by me a sort of poetical Cash, which I fancy I could count over to you in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> verse, If you will drink a dish of Tea with me to-mor∣row morning, I will lay my whole collection before you. I cannot tell, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> how the

Poets will succeed in the explication of coins, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they are generally very great strangers. We are however obliged to you for preventing us with the offer of a kindness that you might well imagine we should have asked you.</P>
<P>Our three friends had been so intent on thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discourse, that they had rambled very far int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fields without taking notice of it. <HI>Philande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> first put them in mind, that unless they turne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> back quickly they would endanger being benight¦ed.

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>SOME of the finest treatises of the most po∣lite <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> writers are in Dialogue, as many very valued pieces of <HI>French, Itali∣an,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> appear in the same dress. I have sometimes however been very much distasted at this way of writing, by reason of the long Pre∣faces and exordiums into which it often betrays an author. There is so much time taken up in ceremony, that before they enter on their subject the Dialogue is half ended. To avoid the fault I have found in others, I shall not trouble my self nor my Reader with the first salutes of our three friends, nor with any part of their discourse over the Tea-table. We will suppose the <HI>China</HI> dishes taken off, and a Drawer of Medals supply∣ing their room. <HI>Philander,</HI> who is to be the He∣roe in my Dialogue, takes it in his hand, and ad∣dressing himself to <HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I will first of all, says he, show you an assembly of the most virtuous Ladies that you have ever perhaps conversed with. I do not know, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> re∣garding them, what their virtue may be, but me∣thinks they are a little fantastical in their dress. You will find, says <HI>Philander,</HI> there is good sense in it. They have not a single ornament that they cannot give a reason for. I was going to ask you, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> in what country you find these Ladies. But I see they are some of those
<PB N="36" REF="32"/>
imaginary persons you told us of last night that inhabit old Coins, and appear no where else but on the reverse of a Medal. Their proper coun∣try, says <HI>Philander,</HI> is the breast of a good man: for I think they are most of them the figures of Virtues. It is a great compliment methinks to the sex, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that your Virtues are gene∣rally shown in petticoats. I can give no other reason for it, says <HI>Philander,</HI> but because they chanced to be of the feminine gender in the learn∣ed languages.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>First Series.</HI> FIGURE I.</NOTE> You find however something bold and masculine in the air and posture of the first figure, which is that of <HI>Virtue</HI> her self, and agrees very well with the description we find of her in <HI>Silius Italicus.</HI>

I find, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> the <HI>Latins</HI> mean Courage by the figure of Virtue, as well as by the word it self.

I am apt to think <HI>Virgil</HI> had a further view in this request of <HI>Juno</HI> than what his Commenta∣tors have discovered in it. He knew very well that his <HI>Aeneid</HI> was founded on a very doubtful story, and that <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s coming into <HI>Italy</HI> was not uni∣versally received among the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves. He knew too that a main objection to this story was the great difference of Customs, Language and Habits among the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Trojans.</HI> To obviate therefore so strong an objection, he makes this difference to arise from the forecast and prae∣determination of the Gods themselves. But pray what is the name of the Lady in the next Medal? Methinks she is very particular in her Quoiffure.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="84"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIG. 9.</NOTE>It is the emblem of Fruitfulness, says <HI>Philander,</HI> and was designed as a com∣pliment to <HI>Julia</HI> the wife of <HI>Septimius Severus,</HI> who had the same number of children as you see on this Coin.

On old Coins we often see an Emperor, a <HI>Victory,</HI> the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> or a slave, sitting on a heap of arms, which always marks out the Peace that arose from such an action as gave occasion to the Me∣dal.

We are told by the old Scholiast, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that there was actually such a statue in the Tem∣ple of <HI>Janus</HI> as that <HI>Virgil</HI> has here described, which I am almost apt to believe, since you assure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that this part of the design is so often met with on ancient Medals.

who will not allow of the interpretation I have put on these two last Medals may think it an ob∣jection that there is no torch or fire near them to signifie any such allusion. But they may consi∣der that on several Imperial Coins we meet with the figure of a funeral pile, without any thing to denote the burning of it, though indeed there is on some of them a Flambeau sticking out on each side, to let us know it was to be consumed to ashes.</P>
<P>You have been so intent on the burning of the Arms, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that you have forgotten the Pil∣lar on your 18th Medal. You may find the history of it, says <HI>Philander,</HI> in <HI>Ovid de Fastis.</HI> It was from this Pillar that the spear was tossed at the o∣pening of a war, for which reason the little figure on the top of it holds a spear in its hand, and <HI>Peace</HI> turns her back upon it.</P>

seems to come in to its assistance, and to lift it off the shallows: for we see the water scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaches up to the knees, though it is the fi∣gure of a man standing on firm ground. His attendants, and the good office he is employed upon, resemble those the Poets often attribute to <HI>Neptune. Homer</HI> tells us, that the Whales leap∣ed up at their God's approach, as we see in the Medal. The two small figures that stand naked among the waves are Sea-Deities of an inferiour rank, who are supposed to assist their Sovereign in the succour he gives the distressed vessel.

The interpreters of this Medal have mistaken these two figures for the representation of two persons that are drowning. But as they are both naked and drawn in a posture rather of trium∣phing o'er the waves than of sinking under them, so we see abundance of Water-Deities on other Medals represented after the same manner.

After having thus far cleared our way to the Me∣dal, I take the thought of the reverse to be this.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIG. 22.</NOTE>The next is a reverse of <HI>Marcus Au∣relius.</HI> We have on it a <HI>Minerva</HI> mounted on a monster, that <HI>Ausonius</HI> describes in the following verses.
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Illa etiam Thalamos per trina aenigmata querens</L>
<L>Qui bipes, et quadrupes foret, et tripes omnia solus;</L>
<L>Terruit Aoniam Volucris, Leo, Virgo; triformis</L>
<L>Sphinx, volucris pennis, pedibusfera, fronte puella.</L></Q>
<Q><L>To form the monster <HI>Sphinx,</HI> a triple kind,</L>
<L>Man, bird, and beast, by nature were combin'd:</L>
<L>With feather'd fans she wing'd th' aerial space;</L>
<L>And on her feet the Lion-claws disgrace</L>
<L>The bloomy features of a Virgin-face.</L>
<L>O'er pale <HI>Aönia</HI> pannic horror ran,</L>
<L>While in mysterious speech she thus began:</L>
<L>"What animal, when yet the Morn is new,</L>
<L>"Walks on Four legs infirm; at Noon on Two:</L>
<L>"But day declining to the western skies,</L>
<L>"He needs a Third; a Third the Night supplies?</L></Q>
The monster, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> is a Sphinx, but for her meaning on this Medal, I am not <HI>O Edipus</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="105"/>
enough to unriddle it. I must confess, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> the Poets fail me in this particular. There is however a passage in <HI>Pausanias</HI> that I will re∣peat to you, though it is in prose, since I know no body else that has explained the Medal by it. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> says he, drew a Sphinx on the armour of <HI>Pallas,</HI> by reason of the strength and sagacity of this animal. The Sphinx therefore signifies the same as <HI>Minerva</HI> herself, who was the Goddess of arms as well as wisdom, and describes the Emperor, as one of the Poets ex∣presses it,
<Q LANG="lat"><L>—Studiis florentem utriusque Minervae.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Whom both <HI>Minerva's</HI> boast t'adopt their own.</L></Q>
The <HI>Romans</HI> joined both devices together, to make the emblem the more significant, as in∣deed they could not too much extol the learn∣ing and military virtues of this excellent Empe∣ror, who was the best Philosopher and greatest General of his Age.</P>
<P>We will close up this Series of Me∣dals with one that was stamped under <HI>Tiberius</HI> to the memory of <HI>Augustus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIG. 23.</NOTE> Over his head you see the star that his father <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was supposed to have been changed into.

<P>I have now given you a sample of such emble∣matical Medals as are unriddled by the <HI>Latin</HI> Po∣ets, and have shown several passages in the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets that receive an illustration from Medals. Some of the Coins we have had before us have
<PB N="114" REF="110"/>
not been explained by others, as many of them have been explained in a different manner. There are indeed others that have had very near the same explication put upon them, but as this explication has been supported by no authority, it can at best be looked upon but as a probable conjecture. It is certain, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> there cannot be any more authentic illustrations of <HI>Roman</HI> Medals, especially of those that are full of fancy, than such as are drawn out of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. For as there is a great affinity between Designing and Poetry, so the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, and the Designers of the <HI>Roman</HI> Medals, lived very near one ano∣ther, were acquainted with the same customs, conversant with the same objects, and bred up to the same relish for wit and fancy. But who are the Ladies that we are next to examine? These are, says <HI>Philander,</HI> so many Cities, Nations and Provinces that present themselves to you under the shape of women. What you take for a fine Lady at first sight, when you come to look into her will prove a town, a country, or one of the four parts of the world. In short, you have now <HI>Afric, Spain, France, Italy,</HI> and several other na∣tions of the earth before you. This is one of the pleasantest Maps, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that I ever saw. Your Geographers now and then fancy a coun∣try like a Leg or a Head, a Bear or a Dragon, but I never before saw them represented like wo∣men. I could not have thought your mountains, seas and promontories could have made up an assembly of such well-shaped persons. This therefore, says <HI>Philander,</HI> is a Geography particu∣lar to the Medallists. The Poets however have sometimes given into it, and furnish us with very

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood lights for the explication of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Third Series.</HI> FIG. 1.</NOTE> The first Lady you see on the List is <HI>Africa,</HI> she carries an Elephant's tooth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y her side.

I need not mention her sitting on the ground, be∣cause we have already spoken of the aptness of such a posture to represent an extreme affliction. I fancy, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> might have an eye on the customs of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation, as well as of those of their country, in the several marks of sorrow they have set on this figure. The Psalmist describes the <HI>Jews</HI> lamenting their captivity in the same pensive posture. <HI>By the wa∣ters of</HI> Babylon <HI>we sate down and wept, when we remembred thee, O</HI> Sion. But what is more re∣markable, we find <HI>Judaea</HI> represented as a wo∣man in sorrow sitting on the ground, in a passage of the Prophet that foretells the very captivity re∣ed on this Medal. The covering of the head, and the rending of garments, we find very often in Holy Scripture, as the expressions of a raging grief. But what is the tree we see on both these Medals? We find, says <HI>Philander,</HI> not only on these, but on several other coins that relate to <HI>Judaea,</HI> the figure of a Palm-tree, to show us that Palms are the growth of the country.

<P>You have given us some quotations out of <HI>Persius</HI> this morning, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that in my opinion have a great deal of poetry in them. I have often wondered at Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> for passing so severe a censure on this Author. He fancies the description of a Wreck that you have already ci∣ted, is too good for <HI>Persius,</HI> and that he might be helpt in it by <HI>Lucan,</HI> who was one of his contemporaries. For my part, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> I am so far from Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s opinion in this particu∣lar, that I fancy <HI>Persius</HI> a better Poet than <HI>Lucan</HI>: and that had he been engaged on the same sub∣ject, he would at least in his Expressions and De∣scriptions have out-writ the <HI>Pharsalia.</HI> He was indeed employed on subjects that seldom led him into any thing like Description, but where he has an occasion of shewing himself, we find very few of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets that have given a grea∣ter beauty to their Expressions. His obscurities are indeed sometimes affected, but they generally arise from the remoteness of the Customs, Per∣sons and Things he alludes to: as Satyr is for this reason more difficult to be understood by those that are not of the same Age with it, than any other kind of Poetry. Love-verses and
<PB N="142" REF="138"/>
Heroics deal in Images that are ever fixed and settled in the nature of things, but a thousand ideas enter into Satyr, that are as changeable and unsteady as the mode or the humours of mankind.</P>
<P>Our three friends had passed away the whole morning among their Medals and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. <HI>Philander</HI> told them it was now too late to enter on another Series, but if they would take up with such a dinner as he could meet with at his Lodgings, he would afterwards lay the rest of his Medals before them. <HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Euge∣nius</HI> were both of them so well pleased with the novelty of the subject, that they would not refuse the offer <HI>Philander</HI> made them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A PARALLEL between the Ancient and Modern MEDALS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PHILANDER</HI> used every morning to take a walk in a neighbouring wood, that stood on the borders of the <HI>Thames.</HI> It was cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough by abundance of beautiful allies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erminating on the water, looked like so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainted views in perspective. The banks of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver and the thickness of the shades drew into them all the birds of the country, that at Sun-ri∣sing filled the wood with such a variety of notes, as made the prettiest confusion imaginable. I know in descriptions of this nature the scenes are generally supposed to grow out of the Au∣thor's imagination, and if they are not charming in all their parts, the Reader never imputes it to the want of sun or soil, but to the Writer's bar∣renness of invention. It is <HI>Cicero</HI>'s observation on the Plane-tree, that makes so flourishing a fi∣gure in one of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Dialogues, that it did not
<PB N="144" REF="140"/>
draw its nourishment from the fountain that ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by it and watered its roots, but from the rich∣ness of the style that describes it. For my own part, as I design only to fix the scene of the fol∣lowing Dialogue, I shall not endeavour to give it any other ornaments than those which nature has bestowed upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Philander</HI> was here enjoying the cool of the morning, among the dews that lay on every thing about him, and that gave the air such a freshness as is not a little agreeable in the hot part of the year. He not been here long before he was joined by <HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Eugenius. Cyn∣thio</HI> immediately fell upon <HI>Philander</HI> for breaking his night's rest. You have so filled my head, says he, with old Coins, that I have had nothing but figures and inscriptions before my eyes. If I chanced to fall into a little slumber, it was im∣mediately interrupted with the vision of a <HI>Cadu∣ceus</HI> or a <HI>Cornu-copiae.</HI> You will make me be∣lieve, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that you begin to be recon∣ciled to Medals. They say it is a sure sign a man loves money, when he is used to find it in his dreams. There is certainly, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> something like Avarice in the study of Medals. The more a man knows of them, the more he desires to know. There is one subject in par∣ticular that <HI>Cynthio,</HI> as well as my self, has a mind to engage you in. We would fain know how the Ancient and Modern Medals differ from one another, and which of them deserves the preference. You have a mind to engage me in a subject, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that is perhaps of a lar∣ger extent than you imagine. To examine it thoroughly, it would be necessary to take them
<PB N="145" REF="141"/>
in pieces, and to speak of the difference that shews it self in their Metals, in the Occasion of stamp∣ing them, in the Inscriptions, and in the Figures that adorn them. Since you have divided your subject, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> be so kind as to enter on it without any further preface.</P>
<P>We should first of all, says <HI>Philander,</HI> consider the difference of the Metals that we find in an∣cient and modern Coins, but as this speculation is more curious than improving, I believe you will excuse me if I do not dwell long upon it. One may understand all the learned part of this science, without knowing whether there were Coins of iron or lead among the old <HI>Romans,</HI> and if a man is well acquainted with the Device of a Medal, I do not see what necessity there is of being able to tell whether the Medal it self be of copper or <HI>Corinthian</HI> brass. There is how∣ever so great a difference between the antique and modern Medals, that I have seen an Antiquary lick an old Coin, among other tryals, to distin∣guish the age of it by its Taste. I remember when I laught at him for it, he told me with a great deal of vehemence, there was as much dif∣ference between the relish of ancient and modern brass, as between an apple and a turnep. It is pity, says <HI>Engenius,</HI> but they found out the Smell too of an ancient Medal. They would then be able to judge of it by all the senses. The Touch, I have heard, gives almost as good evidence as the Sight, and the Ringing of a Me∣dal is, I know, a very common experiment. But I suppose this last proof you mention relates only to such Coins as are made of your baser sorts of metal. And here, says <HI>Philander,</HI> we may ob∣serve
<PB N="146" REF="142"/>
the prudence of the Ancients above that of the Moderns, in the care they took to perpetuate the memory of great actions. They knew very well that silver and gold might fall into the hands of the covetous or ignorant, who would not respect them for the Device they bore, but for the Metal they were made of. Nor were their apprehensions ill-founded; for it is not easily ima∣gined how many of these noble monuments of history have perished in the goldsmiths hands, be∣fore they came to be collected together by the learned men of these two or three last Centuries. Inscriptions, Victories, Buildings, and a thousand other pieces of antiquity were melted down in those barbarous Ages, that thought figures and letters only served to spoil the gold that was charged with them. Your Medallists look on this destruction of Coins, as on the burning of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Library, and would be content to compound for them, with almost the loss of a <HI>Vatican.</HI> To prevent this in some measure, the ancients placed the greatest variety of their devi∣ces on their brass and copper Coins, which are in no fear of falling into the clippers hands, nor in any danger of melting till the general confla∣gration. On the contrary, our modern Medals are most in silver or gold, and often in a very small number of each. I have seen a golden one at <HI>Vienna,</HI> of <HI>Philip</HI> the second, that weighed two and twenty pound, which is probably singular in its kind, and will not be able to keep it self long out of the furnace when it leaves the Emperor's Treasury. I remember another in the King of <HI>Prussia</HI>'s collection, that has in it three pound weight of gold. The Princes who struck these
<PB N="147" REF="143"/>
Medals, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> seem to have designed them rather as an ostentation of their Wealth, than of their Virtues. They fancied probably, it was a greater honour to appear in gold than in copper, and that a Medal receives all its value from the rarity of the metal. I think the next subject you proposed to speak of, were the dif∣ferent Occasions that have given birth to ancient and modern Medals.</P>
<P>Before we enter on this particular, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> I must tell you by way of preliminary, that formerly there was no difference between Money and Medals. An old <HI>Roman</HI> had his purse full of the same pieces that we now pre∣serve in Cabinets. Assoon as an Emperor had done any thing remarkable, it was immediately stamped on a Coin, and became current through his whole Dominions. It was a pretty contri∣vance, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to spread abroad the virtues of an Emperor, and make his actions circulate. A fresh Coin was a kind of a <HI>Gazette,</HI> that pub∣lished the latest news of the Empire. I should fancy your <HI>Roman</HI> Bankers were very good Hi∣storians. It is certain, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> they might find their profit and instruction mixed together. I have often wondered that no nation among the moderns has imitated the antient <HI>Romans</HI> in this particular. I know no other way of securing these kinds of monuments, and making them nu∣merous enough to be handed down to future ages. But where Statesmen are ruled by a spi∣rit of faction and interest, they can have no pas∣sion for the glory of their country, nor any con∣cern for the figure it will make among posterity. A man that talks of his nation's honour a thou∣sand
<PB N="148" REF="144"/>
years hence, is in very great danger of being laught at. We shall think, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> you have a mind to fall out with the Government, because it does not encourage Medals. But were all your ancient Coins that are now in Cabinets once current money? It is the most probable opinion, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that they were all of them such, excepting those we call Meda∣lions. These in respect of the other Coins were the same as modern Medals, in respect of mo∣dern money. They were exempted from all commerce, and had no other value but what was set upon them by the fancy of the owner. They are supposed to have been struck by Emperors for presents to their Friends, foreign Princes, or Ambassadors. However, that the smallness of their number might not endanger the loss of the devices they bore, the <HI>Romans</HI> took care gene∣rally to stamp the subject of their Medalions on their ordinary Coins that were the running cash of the nation. As if in <HI>England</HI> we should see on our half-penny and farthing pieces, the several designs that show themselves in their perfection on our Medals.</P>
<P>If we now consider, continued <HI>Philander,</HI> the different Occasions or Subjects of ancient and modern Medals, we shall find they both agree in recording the great actions and successes in war, allowing still for the different ways of making it, and the circumstances that attended it in past ages, and in the present. I shall instance one. I do not remember in any old Coin to have seen the taking of a town mentioned: as indeed there were few conquerors could signalize themselves that way before the invention of powder and
<PB N="149" REF="145"/>
fortifications, a single battle often deciding the fate of whole kingdoms. Our modern Medals give us several sieges and plans of fortified towns, that show themselves in all their parts to a great advantage on the reverse of a Coin. It is indeed, a kind of justice, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that a Prince owes to posterity, after he has ruined or defaced a strong place to deliver down to them a model of it as it stood whole and entire. The Coin re∣pairs in some measure the mischiefs of his Bombs and Cannons. In the next place, says <HI>Philan∣der,</HI> we see both on the ancient and modern Me∣dals the several noble pieces of Architecture that were finished at the time when the Medals were stamped. I must observe however, to the ho∣nour of the latter, that they have represented their buildings according to the rules of perspe∣ctive. This I remember to have seen but in ve∣ry few of the plans on ancient Coins, which makes them appear much less beautiful than the modern, especially to a mathematical eye. Thus far our two setts of Medals agree as to their Subject. But old Coins go farther in their compliments to their Emperor, as they take occasion to celebrate his distinguishing Virtues; not as they showed themselves in any particular action, but as they shone out in the general view of his character. This humour went so far, that we see <HI>Nero</HI>'s fid∣ling, and <HI>Commodus</HI>'s skill in fencing, on several of their Medals. At present, you never meet with the King of <HI>France</HI>'s generosity, nor the Em∣peror's devotion recorded after this manner. A∣gain, the <HI>Romans</HI> used to register the great actions of Peace that turned to the good of the people, as well as those of War. The remission of a
<PB N="150" REF="146"/>
Debt, the taking off a Duty, the giving up a Tax, the mending a Port, or the making a Highway, were not looked upon as improper subjects for a Coin. They were glad of any opportunity to encourage their Emperors in the humour of do∣ing good, and knew very well, that many of these acts of beneficence had a wider and more lasting influence on the happiness and welfare of a peo∣ple, than the gaining a Victory, or the Conquest of a nation. In <HI>England</HI> perhaps it would have looked a little odd to have stamped a Medal on the abolishing of Chimney-money in the last Reign, or on the giving a hundred thousand pound a year towards the carrying on a war, in this. I find, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> had we struck in with the practice of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> we should have had Medals on the fitting up our several Docks, on the making of our Rivers navigable, on the building our men of War, and the like subjects, that have certainly very well deserved them. The reason why it has been neglected, says <HI>Philander,</HI> may possibly be this. Our Princes have the coin∣ing of their own Medals, and perhaps may think it would look like vanity to erect so many Tro∣phies and Monuments of praise to their own merit; whereas among the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> the Senate had still a watchful eye on their Emperor, and if they found any thing in his life and actions that might furnish out a Medal, they did not fail of making him so acceptable an offering. 'Tis true, their flatteries betray often such a base∣ness of spirit, as one would little expect to find among such an order of men. And here by the way we may observe, that you never find any thing like Satyr or Raillery on old Coins.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="147"/>Whatever victories were got on foreign ene∣mies, or the several pretenders to the Empire obtained over one another, they are recorded on Coins without the least bitterness or reflection. The Emperors often jested on their rivals or predecessors, but their Mints still maintained their gravity. They might publish invectives against one another in their discourses or wri∣tings, but never on their Coins. Had we no other histories of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, but those we find on their money, we should take them for the most virtuous race of Princes that mankind were ever blessed with: whereas, if we look in∣to their lives, they appear many of them such monsters of lust and cruelty, as are almost a re∣proach to human nature. Medals are therefore so many compliments to an Emperor, that a∣scribe to him all the Virtues and Victories he himself pretended to. Were you to take from hence all your informations, you would fancy <HI>Claudius</HI> as great a Conqueror as <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Domitian</HI> a wiser Prince than his brother <HI>Ti∣tus. Tiberius</HI> on his Coins is all Mercy and Mo∣deration, <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> are Fathers of their Country, <HI>Galba</HI> the patron of public Liberty, and <HI>Vitellius</HI> the restorer of the city of <HI>Rome.</HI> In short, if you have a mind to see the religious <HI>Commodus,</HI> the pious <HI>Caracalla,</HI> and the devout <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> you may find them either in the inscription or device of their Medals. On the contrary, those of a modern make are often char∣ged with Irony and Satyr. Our Kings no soon∣er fall out, but their mints make war upon one another, and their malice appears on their Me∣dals. One meets sometimes with very nice
<PB N="152" REF="148"/>
touches of Raillery, but as we have no instance of it among the ancient Coins, I shall leave you to determine, whether or no it ought to find a place there. I must confess, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> I be∣lieve we are generally in the wrong, when we deviate from the ancients: because their practice is for the most part grounded upon reason. But if our fore-fathers have thought fit to be grave and serious, I hope their posterity may laugh with∣out offence. For my part, I cannot but look on this kind of Raillery as a refinement on Me∣dals: and do not see why there may not be some for diversion, at the same time that there are o∣thers of a more solemn and majestic nature, as a Victory may be celebrated in an Epigram as well as in an Heroic Poem. Had the ancients given place to Raillery on any of their Coins, I question not but they would have been the most valued parts of a collection. Besides the enter∣tainment we should have found in them, they would have shown us the different state of Wit, as it flourished or decayed in the several ages of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. There is no doubt, says <HI>Philander,</HI> but our fore-fathers, if they had plea∣sed, could have been as witty as their posterity. But I am of opinion, they industriously avoided it on their Coins, that they might not give us oc∣casion to suspect their sincerity. Had they run into mirth or satyr we should not have thought they had designed so much to instruct as to di∣vert us. I have heard, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that the <HI>Romans</HI> stamped several Coins on the same occa∣sion. If we follow their example, there will be no danger of deceiving posterity: since the more serious sort of Medals may serve as Comments
<PB N="153" REF="149"/>
on those of a lighter character. However it is, the raillery of the Moderns cannot be worse than the flattery of the Ancients. But hitherto you have only mentioned such Coins as were made on the Emperor, I have seen several of our own time that have been made as a compliment to private persons. There are pieces of money, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that during the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, were coined in honour of the Senate, Army or People. I do not remember to have seen in the upper Empire the face of any private person that was not some way related to the Im∣perial family. <HI>Sejanus</HI> has indeed his Consulship mentioned on a Coin of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as he has the honour to give a name to the year in which our Saviour was crucified. We are now come to the Legend or Inscription of our Medals, which as it is one of the more essential parts of them, it may deserve to be examined more at length. You have chosen a very short Text to enlarge upon, says <HI>Cynthio</HI>: I should as soon expect to see a Critique on the Posie of a Ring, as on the In∣scription of a Medal.</P>
<P>I have seen several modern Coins, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> that have had part of the Legend running round the edges, like the <HI>Decus et Tutamen</HI> in our milled money; so that a few years will proba∣bly wear out the action that the Coin was de∣signed to perpetuate. The ancients were too wise to register their exploits on so nice a sur∣face. I should fancy, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the mo∣derns may have chosen this part of the Medal for the inscription, that the figures on each side might appear to a greater advantage. I have observed in several old Coins a kind of confusion between
<PB N="154" REF="150"/>
the legend and the device. The figures and let∣ters were so mingled together, that one would think the Coiner was hard put to it on what part of the money to bestow the several words of his inscription. You have found out some∣thing like an excuse, says <HI>Philander,</HI> for your milled Medals, if they carried the whole legend on their edges. But at the same time that they are lettered on the edges, they have other inscrip∣tions on the face and the reverse. Your modern Designers cannot contract the occasion of the Medal into an inscription that is proper to the Volume they write upon: so that having scrib∣bled over both sides, they are forced, as it were to write upon the margin. The first fault there∣fore that I shall find with a modern legend, is its Diffusiveness. You have sometimes the whole side of a Medal over-run with it. One would fancy the Author had a design of being <HI>Ciceroni∣an</HI> in his <HI>Latin,</HI> and of making a round period I will give you only the reverse of a Coin stampt by the present Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> on the rai∣sing of the siege of <HI>Vienna.</HI> VIENNA AVSTRIA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 IVLII AB ACHMETE II.

I should take this, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> for the paragraph of a <HI>Gazette,</HI> rather than the inscription of a Medal. I remember you represented your ancient Coins as abridgements of history; but your modern, if there are many of them like this, should themselves be epitomized. Compare with this, says <HI>Philander,</HI> the brevity and comprehen∣siveness of those legends that appear on ancient Coins.

What a majesty and force does one meet with in these short Inscriptions! Are not you amazed to see so much history gathered into so small a compass? You have often the subject of a Vo∣lume in a couple of words.</P>
<P>If our modern Medals are so very prolix in their prose, they are every whit as tedious in their verse. You have sometimes a dull Epigram of four lines. This, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> may be of great use to immortalize Punns and Quibbles, and to let posterity see their forefathers were a parcel of blockheads. A Coin, I find, may be of great use to a bad Poet. If he cannot become im∣mortal by the goodness of his verse, he may by the durableness of the Metal that supports it. I shall give you an instance, says <HI>Philander,</HI> from a Medal of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> that will stand as an eternal monument of Dullness and Bravery.
<Q LANG="lat"><L>Miles ego Christi, Christo duce sterno tyrannos,</L>
<L>Haereticos simul et calco meis pedibus.</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="152"/>Parcere Christicolis me, debellare feroces</L>
<L>Papicolas Christus dux meus en animat.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is well, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> you tell us this is a Medal of the Great <HI>Gustavus:</HI> I should have ta∣ken it for some one of his <HI>Gothic</HI> Predecessors. Does it not bring into your mind <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great's being accompanied with a <HI>Chaerilus</HI> in his <HI>Persian</HI> expedition? If you are offended at the homeliness of this Inscription, says <HI>Philander,</HI> what would you think of such as have neither sense nor grammar in them? I assure you I have seen the face of many a great Monarch hemmed in with false <HI>Latin.</HI> But it is not only the stupi∣dity and tediousness of these Inscriptions that I find fault with; supposing them of a moderate length and proper sense, why must they be in verse? We should be surprized to see the title of a serious book in rhime, yet it is every whit as ri∣diculous to give the subject of a Medal in a piece of an Hexameter. This however is the practice of our modern Medallists. If you look into the ancient Inscriptions, you see an air of simplicity in the words, but a great magnificence in the thought; on the contrary, in your modern Me∣dals you have generally a trifling thought wrapt up in the beginning or end of an Heroic verse. Where the sense of an Inscription is low, it is not in the power of <HI>Dactyls</HI> and <HI>Spondees</HI> to raise it; where it is noble, it has no need of such af∣fected ornaments. I remember a Medal of <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> the second, on <HI>Charles le Quint</HI>'s resigning to him the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> with this Inscription, <HI>Ut Quiescat Atlas.</HI> The Device is a <HI>Hercules</HI> with the Sphere on his shoulders. Notwithstanding
<PB N="157" REF="153"/>
the thought is poetical, I dare say you would think the beauty of the Inscription very much lost, had it been — <HI>requiescat ut Atlas.</HI> To instance a Medal of our own nation. After the conclusion of the peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> there was one stampt with the following Legend — <HI>Re∣deant Commercia Flandris.</HI> The thought is here great enough, but in my opinion it would have looked much greater in two or three words of prose. I think truly, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> it is ridiculous enough to make the Inscription run like a piece of a verse, when it is not ta∣ken out of an old Author. But I would fain have your opinion on such Inscriptions as are borrowed from the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. I have seen several of this sort that have been very prettily ap∣plied, and I fancy when they are chosen with art, they should not be thought unworthy of a place in your Medals.</P>
<P>Which ever side I take, says <HI>Philander,</HI> I am like to have a great party against me. Those who have formed their relish on old Coins, will by no means allow of such an innovation; on the contrary, your men of wit will be apt to look on it as an improvement on ancient Medals. You will oblige us however to let us know what kind of rules you would have observed in the choice of your quotations, since you seem to lay a stress on their being chosen with Art. You must know then, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I do not think it enough that a quotation tells us plain matter of fact, unless it has some other accidental orna∣ments to set it off. Indeed if a great action that seldom happens in the course of human affairs, is exactly described in the passage of an old Poet, it
<PB N="158" REF="154"/>
gives the Reader a very agreeable surprize, and may therefore deserve a place on a Medal.</P>
<P>Again, if there is more than a single circum∣stance of the action specified in the quotation, it pleases a man to see an old exploit copied out as it were by a Modern, and running parallel with it in several of its particulars.</P>
<P>In the next place, when the quotation is not only apt, but has in it a turn of Wit or Satyr, it is still the better qualified for a Medal, as it has a double capacity of pleasing.</P>
<P>But there is no Inscription fitter for a Medal, in my opinion, than a quotation that besides its aptness has something in it lofty and sublime: for such an one strikes in with the natural great∣ness of the soul, and produces a high idea of the person or action it celebrates, which is one of the principal designs of a Medal.</P>
<P>It is certainly very pleasant, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> to see a verse of an old Poet, revolting as it were from its original sense, and siding with a modern subject. But then it ought to do it wil∣lingly of its own accord, without being forced to it by any change in the words, or the punctua∣tion: for when this happens, it is no longer the verse of an ancient Poet, but of him that has converted it to his own use.</P>
<P>You have, I believe, by this time exhausted your subject, says <HI>Philander</HI>; and I think the criticisms you have made on the poetical quota∣tions that we so often meet with in our modern Medals, may be very well applied to the Mottos of books, and other Inscriptions of the same nature. But before, we quit the Legends of Me∣dals, I cannot but take notice of a kind of wit
<PB N="159" REF="155"/>
that flourishes very much on many of the mo∣dern, especially those of <HI>Germany,</HI> when they re∣present in the Inscription the year in which they were coined. As to mention to you another of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus. C</HI>HR<HI>I</HI>ST<HI>V</HI>S <HI>DVX</HI> ER∣GO TR<HI>IVM</HI>PH<HI>V</HI>S. If you take the pains to pick out the figures from the several words, and range them in their proper order, you will find they amount to 1627, the year in which the Me∣dal was coined; for do not you observe some of the letters distinguish themselves from the rest, and top it over their fellows? these you must consider in a double capacity, as letters and as cy∣phers. Your laborious <HI>German</HI> Wits will turn you over a whole Dictionary for one of these in∣genious Devices. You would fancy perhaps they were searching after an apt classical term, but in∣stead of that, they are looking out a word that has an L. an M. or a D. in it. When there∣fore you see any of these Inscriptions, you are not so much to look in them for the thought, as for the year of the Lord. There are foreign U∣niversities where this kind of wit is so much in vogue, that as you praise a man in <HI>England</HI> for being an excellent Philosopher or Poet, it is an or∣dinary character among them to be a great Chro∣nogrammatist. These are probably, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> some of those mild provinces of Acrostic land, that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has assigned to his Anagrams, Wings and Altars. We have now done, I sup∣pose, with the Legend of a Medal. I think you promised us in the next place to speak of the Fi∣gures.</P>
<P>As we had a great deal of talk on this part of a Coin, replied <HI>Philander,</HI> in our discourse on
<PB N="160" REF="156"/>
the Usefulness of ancient Medals, I shall only just touch on the chief heads wherein the Ancient and the Modern differ. In the first place, the <HI>Romans</HI> always appear in the proper Dress of their country, insomuch that you see the little variations of the Mode in the drapery of the Medal. They would have thought it ridiculous to have drawn an Emperor of <HI>Rome</HI> in a <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Cloak or a <HI>Phrygian</HI> Mitre. On the con∣trary, our modern Medals are full of <HI>Toga's</HI> and <HI>Tunica's, Trabea's</HI> and <HI>Paludamentums,</HI> with a multitude of the like antiquated garments, that have not been in fashion these thousand years. You see very often a King of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France</HI> dressed up like a <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> One would think they had a mind to pass themselves upon posteri∣ty for <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors. The same observation may run through several customs and religions, that appear in our ancient and modern Coins. Nothing is more usual than to see Allusions to <HI>Roman</HI> customs and ceremonies on the Medals of our own nation. Nay very often they carry the figure of a heathen god. If posterity takes its notions of us from our Medals, they must fancy one of our Kings paid a great devotion to <HI>Miner∣va,</HI> that another was a professed Worshipper of <HI>Apollo,</HI> or at best that our whole religion was a mixture of Paganism and Christianity. Had the old <HI>Romans</HI> been guilty of the same extravagance, there would have been so great a confusion in their Antiquities, that their Coins would not have had half the uses we now find in them. We ought to look on Medals as so many monu∣ments consigned over to Eternity, that may pos∣sibly last when all other memorials of the same
<PB N="161" REF="157"/>
Age are worn out or lost. They are a kind of Present that those who are actually in Being make over to such as lie hid within the depths of Futu∣rity. Were they only designed to instruct the three or four succeeding generations, they are in no great danger of being misunderstood: but as they may pass into the hands of a posterity, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie many removes from us, and are like to act their part in the world, when its governments, manners and religions may be quite altered; we ought to take a particular care not to make any false reports in them, or to charge them with any Devices that may look doubtful or unintelligible.</P>
<P>I have lately seen, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> a Medallic history of the present King of <HI>France.</HI> One might expect, methinks, to see the Medals of that na∣tion in the highest perfection, when there is a so∣ciety pensioned and set apart on purpose for the designing of them.</P>
<P>We will examine them, if you please, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> in the light that our foregoing observa∣tions have set them: but on this condition that you do not look on the faults I find in them any more than my own private opinion. In the first place then, I think it is impossible to learn from the <HI>French</HI> Medals either the religion, custom, or habits of the <HI>French</HI> nation. You see on some of them the Cross of our Saviour, and on others <HI>Hercules</HI>' his Club. In one you have an Angel, and in another a <HI>Mercury.</HI> I fancy, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> posterity would be as much puzzled on the reli∣gion of <HI>Louis le Grand,</HI> were they to learn it from his Medals, as we are at present on that of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great. It is certain, says <HI>Phi∣lander,</HI> there is the same mixture of Christian and
<PB N="162" REF="158"/>
Pagan in their Coins; nor is there a less confu∣sion in their customs. For example, what rela∣tion is there between the figure of a Bull, and the planting of a <HI>French</HI> colony in <HI>America</HI>? The <HI>Romans</HI> made use of this type in allusion to one of their own customs at the sending out of a co∣lony. But for the <HI>French,</HI> a Ram, a Hog, or an Elephant, would have been every whit as signi∣ficant an emblem. Then can any thing be more unnatural than to see a King of <HI>France</HI> dressed like an Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> with his arms stripped up to the elbows, a Laurel on his head, and a <HI>Chlamys</HI> over his shoulders? I fancy, says <HI>Euge∣nius,</HI> the society of Medallists would give you their reasons for what they have done. You your self allow the Legend to be <HI>Latin,</HI> and why may not the customs and ornaments be of the same country as the language? especially since they are all of them so universally understood by the learned. I own to you, says <HI>Philander,</HI> if they only design to deliver down to posterity the several parts of their Great Monarch's histo∣ry, it is no matter for the other circumstances of a Medal; but I fancy it would be as great a plea∣sure and instruction for future ages, to see the Dres∣ses and Customs of their ancestors, as their Buil∣dings and Victories. Besides, I do not think they have always chosen a proper Occasion for a Me∣dal. There is one struck, for example, on the <HI>English</HI> failing in their attempts on <HI>Dunkirk</HI>: when in the last reign they endeavoured to blow up a Fort, and bombard the town. What have the <HI>French</HI> here done to boast of? A Medal how∣ever you have with this inscription, DVNKIRKA ILLAESA. Not to cavil at the two K's in
<PB N="163" REF="159"/>
<HI>Dunkirka,</HI> or the impropriety of the word <HI>Illaesa,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole Medal, in my opinion, tends not so much to the honour of the <HI>French</HI> as of the <HI>Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish,</HI>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>—quos opimus</L>
<L>Fallere et effugere est triumphus.</L></Q>
I could mention a few other faults, or at least what I take for such. But at same time must be forced to allow, that this Series of Medals is the most perfect of any among the moderns in the beauty of the Work, the aptness of the De∣vice, and the propriety of the Legend. In these and other particulars, the <HI>French</HI> Medals come nearer the ancients than those of any other coun∣try, as indeed it is to this nation we are indebted for the best lights that have been given to the whole science in general.</P>
<P>I must not here forget to mention the Medal∣lic history of the Popes, where there are many Coins of an excellent workmanship, as I think they have none of those faults that I have spoken of in the preceding sett. They are always <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholic in the Device and in the Legend, which are both of them many times taken out of the ho∣ly Scriptures, and therefore not unsuitable to the character of the Prince they represent. Thus when <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. lay under terrible apprehen∣sions of the <HI>French</HI> King, he put out a Coin, that on the reverse of it had a ship tossed on the waves to represent the Church. Before it, was the figure of our Saviour walking on the waters, and St. <HI>Peter</HI> ready to sink at his feet. The in∣scription, if I remember, was in <HI>Latin. Help
<PB N="164" REF="160"/>
Lord, or else I perish.</HI> This puts me in mind, says <HI>Cynthio,</HI> of a Pasquinade, that at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime was fixed up at <HI>Rome. Ad Galli cantum Petrus flet.</HI> But methinks, under this head of the figures on ancient and modern Coins, we might expect to hear your opinion on the difference that appears in the Workmanship of each. You must know then, says <HI>Philander,</HI> that till about the end of the third Century, when there was a gene∣ral decay in all the arts of designing, I do not re∣member to have seen the head of a <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣peror drawn with a full face. They always ap∣pear in <HI>profil,</HI> to use a <HI>French</HI> term of art, which gives us the view of a head, that, in my opinion, has something in it very majestic, and at the same time suits best with the dimensions of a Medal. Besides that it shows the nose and eyebrows, with the several prominencies and fallings in of the fea∣tures, much more distinctly than any other kind of figure. In the lower Empire you have abundance of broad <HI>Gothic</HI> faces, like so many full Moons on the side of a Coin. Among the moderns too, we have of both sorts, though the finest are made after the antique. In the next place, you find the figures of many ancient Coins rising up in a much more beautiful <HI>relief</HI> than those on the modern. This too is a beauty that fell with the grandeur of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, so that you see the face sinking by degrees in the several declensions of the Empire, till about <HI>Constantine</HI>'s time it lies al∣most even with the surface of the Medal. After this it appears so very plain and uniform, that one would think the Coiner look'd on the flatness of a figure as one of the greatest beauties in Sculp∣ture. I fancy, says <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the Sculptors of
<PB N="165" REF="161"/>
that age had the same relish as a <HI>Greek</HI> Priest that was buying some religious pictures at <HI>Venice.</HI> A∣mong others he was shown a noble piece of <HI>Ti∣tian.</HI> The Priest having well survey'd it, was ve∣ry much scandalized at the extravagance of the <HI>relief,</HI> as he termed it. You know, says he, our religion forbids all idolatry: We admit of no I∣mages but such as are drawn on a smooth sur∣face: The figure you have here shown me, stands so much out to the eye, that I would no sooner suf∣fer it in my Church than a Statue. I could re∣commend your <HI>Greek</HI> Priest, says <HI>Philander,</HI> to a∣bundance of celebrated Painters on this side of the <HI>Alps</HI> that would not fail to please him. We must own however, that the figures on several of our modern Medals are raised and rounded to a very great perfection. But if you compare them in this particular with the most finished among the ancients, your men of art declare universally for the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Eugenius,</HI> though they were well pleased with <HI>Philander</HI>'s discourse, were glad how∣ever to find it at an end: for the Sun began to gather strength upon them, and had pierced the shelter of their walks in several places. <HI>Philan∣der</HI> had no sooner done talking, but he grew sen∣sible of the heat himself, and immediately propo∣sed to his friends the retiring to his lodgings, and getting a thicker shade over their heads. They both of them very readily closed with the propo∣sal, and by that means give me an opportunity of finishing my Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of the following Essay has endeavoured to draw into one continued scheme the whole state of the present war, and the methods that appear to him the most proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or bringing it to a happy conclusion.</P>
<P>After having considered that the <HI>French</HI> are the constant and most dangerous enemies to the <HI>British</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, and that the danger from them is now grea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er than ever, and will still increase till their present Union with <HI>Spain</HI> be broken, he sets forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he several advantages which this Union has already given <HI>France,</HI> and taken from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the woollen manufacture, the trade of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the naval power of the two nations.</P>
<P>He shews how these advantages will still rise higher after a peace, notwithstanding our present conquests, with new additions, should be confirmed to us, as well because the monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> would not be weakened by such concessions, as because no Guarantee could be found sufficient to secure them to us. For which reasons he lays it down as a fixt Rule, that no peace is to be made without an entire disunion of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchies.</P>
<P>That this may be brought about, he endeavours to prove from the progress we have already made towards it, and the successes w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have purchased in
<PB REF="202"/>
the present war, which are very considerable if well pursued, but of no effect if we acquiesce in them.</P>
<P>In order to complete this disunion in which we have gone so far, he would not have us rely upon exhausting the <HI>French</HI> Treasury, attempts on the <HI>Spanish Indies,</HI> Descents on <HI>France,</HI> but chiefly upon out-numbring them in troops, <HI>France</HI> being already drained of her best supplies, and the con∣federates masters of much greater forces for multi∣tude and strength, both in men and horse, and pro∣vided with Generals of greater fame and abilities.</P>
<P>He then considers the wrong measures we have hitherto taken in making too small levies after a suc∣cessful campaign, in regulating their number by that of the enemies forces, and hiring them of our confederates; shewing at the same time the incon∣veniences we suffer from such hired troops, and se∣veral advantages we might receive from employing those of our own nation.</P>
<P>He further recommends this augmentation of our forces, to prevent the keeping up a standing bo∣dy of them in times of peace, to enable us to make an impression on the Enemy in the present posture of the war, and to secure our selves against a Prince, who is now at the head of a powerful army, and has not yet declared himself.</P>
<P>In the last place, he answers by several conside∣rations those two popular objections. That we fur∣nish more towards the war than the rest of the Allies, and That we are not able to contribute more than we do already.</P>
<P>These are the most material heads of the follow∣ing Essay, in which there are many other subordi∣nate reflections that naturally grow out of so copious a subject.</P>
<P>November 1707.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT <HI>STATE</HI> of the <HI>WAR,</HI> AND The Necessity of an Augmentation, considered.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>French</HI> are certainly the most implacable, and the most dangerous enemies of the <HI>British</HI> nation. Their form of government, their religion, their jealousy of the <HI>British</HI> power, as well as their prosecutions or commerce, and pursuits of universal Monarchy, will fix them for ever in their animosities and aversions to∣wards us, and make them catch at all oppor∣tunities of subverting our constitution, destroying our religion, ruining our trade, and sinking the figure which we make among the nations of
<PB N="242" REF="204"/>
<HI>Europe:</HI> Not to mention the particular ties of honour that lie on their present King to impose on us a Prince, who must prove fatal to our country if he ever reigns over us.</P>
<P>As we are thus in a natural state of war, if I may so call it, with the <HI>French</HI> nation; it is our misfortune, that they are not only the most inve∣terate, but most formidable of our enemies; and have the greatest power, as well as the strongest inclination, to ruin us. No other state equals them in the force of their fleets and armies, in the nearness and conveniency of their situation, and in the number of friends and well-wishers, which, it is to be feared, they have among us.</P>
<P>For these reasons, our wars with <HI>France</HI> have always affected us in our most tender interests, and concerned us more than those we have had with any other nation; but I may venture to say, this Kingdom was never yet engaged in a war of so great consequence, as that which now lies up∣on our hands. Our All is at stake, and irretrie∣vably lost, if we fail of success. At other times, if a war ended in a dishonourable peace, or with equal loss, we could comfort our selves with the hopes of a more favourable juncture, that might set the balance right, or turn it to our advan∣tage. We had still the prospect of forming the same alliance, or perhaps strengthning it with new confederacies, and by that means of trying our fortune a second time, in case the injustice or ambition of the enemy forced us into the field. At present, if we make a drawn game of it, or procure but moderate advantages, we are in a condition which every <HI>British</HI> heart must tremble at the thought of. There are no second tryals,
<PB N="243" REF="205"/>
no wars in reserve, no new schemes of alliance to which we can have recourse. Should the <HI>French</HI> King be able to bear down such an united force as now makes head against him, at a time when <HI>Spain</HI> affords him no greater assistance; what will he do when the trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> lies at his mercy; when the whole kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> is supplied with his manufactures, and the wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> flows into his coffers; and, what is yet worse, when this additional strength must arise in all its particulars from a propor∣tionable decay in the States that now make war upon him? It is no wonder therefore that our late King of glorious memory, who, by the confes∣sion of his greatest enemies, was a Prince that perfectly understood the interests of <HI>Europe,</HI> should in his last speech recommend to his Par∣liament the declaring war against <HI>France</HI> in those memorable words: <HI>You have yet an opportunity, by God's blessing, to secure to you and your posteri∣ty the quiet enjoyment of your religion and liber∣ties, if you are not wanting to your selves, but will exert the ancient vigour of the</HI> English <HI>nation: but I tell you plainly, my opinion is, if you do not lay hold on this occasion, you have no reason to hope for another.</HI></P>
<P>We have already a dreadful proof of the in∣crease of power that accrues to <HI>France</HI> from its conjunction with <HI>Spain.</HI> So expensive a war as that which the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy hath been car∣rying on in so many and so remote parts at once, must long since have drained and exhausted all its substance, had there not been several secret springs, that swelled their treasury from time to time, in proportion as the war has sunk it. The King's
<PB N="244" REF="206"/>
coffers have been often reduced to the lowest ebb, but have still been seasonably refreshed by frequent and unexpected supplies from the <HI>Spa∣nish America.</HI> We hear indeed of the arrival but of very few ships from those parts; but as in eve∣ry vessel there is stowage for immense treasures, when the cargo is pure Bullion, or merchandise of as great a value: so we find by experience they have had such prodigious sums of money con∣veyed to them by these secret channels, that they have been enabled to pay more numerous armies, than they ever had on foot before; and that at a time when their trade fails in all its other branches, and is distressed by all the arts and contrivances of their neighbouring nations. During the last four years, by a modest computation, there have been brought into <HI>Brest</HI> above six millions of pounds sterling in bullion. What then shall we suppose wou'd be the effect of this correspondence with <HI>America,</HI> might the wealth of those parts come to them on squadrons of men of war, and fleets of galeons? If these little by-currents, that creep into the country by stealth, have so great a force, how shall we stem the whole torrent, when it breaks in upon us with its full violence? and this certainly will be our case, unless we find a means to dissolve the union between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I have dwelt the longer on this consideration, be∣cause the present war hath already furnished us with the experiment, and sensibly convinced us of the increase of power, which <HI>France</HI> has recei∣ved from its intercourse with the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>As there are many who look upon every thing which they do not actually see and feel as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="245" REF="207"/>
probability and speculation, I shall only touch on those other reasons of which we have already had some experience, for our preventing this coalition of interests and designs in the two monarchies.</P>
<P>The Woollen manufacture is the <HI>British</HI> strength, the staple commodity and proper growth of our country; if this fails us, our trade and estates must sink together, and all the cash of the nation be consumed on foreign merchandize. The <HI>French</HI> at present gain very much upon us in this great article of our trade, and since the acces∣sion of the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy, supply with cloth, of their own making, the very best mart we had in <HI>Europe.</HI> And what a melancholy prospect have we, if ever a peace gives them leave to enrich their manufacture with mixtures of <HI>Spanish</HI> wool, to multiply the hands employed in it, to improve themselves in all the niceties of the art, and to vend their wares in those places where was the greatest consumption of our woollen works, and the most considerable gain for the <HI>British</HI> mer∣chant? Notwithstanding our many seasonable re∣cruits from <HI>Portugal</HI> and our plantations, we al∣ready complain of our want of bullion; and must at last be reduced to the greatest exigencies, if this great source be dryed up, and our traffick with <HI>Spain</HI> continue under its present discourage∣ment.</P>
<P>The trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> must likewise flourish or decay in our hands, as we are friends or ene∣mies of the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy. The late con∣quest of <HI>Naples</HI> will very little alter the case, though <HI>Sicily</HI> should follow the fate of her sister kingdom. The <HI>Streight</HI>'s mouth is the key of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and will be always in the possession of
<PB N="246" REF="208"/>
those who are Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> We may only add, that the same causes which straiten the <HI>British</HI> commerce, will naturally enlarge the <HI>French</HI>; and that the naval force of either nation will thrive or languish in the same degree as their commerce gathers or loses strength. And if so powerful and populous a nation as that of <HI>France</HI> become superior to us by sea, our whole is lost, and we are no more a people. The considera∣tion of so narrow a channel betwixt us, of such numbers of regular troops on the enemy's side, of so small a standing force on our own, and that too in a country destitute of all such forts and strong places as might stop the progress of a victorious army, hath something in it so terrify∣ing, that one does not care for setting it in its proper light. Let it not therefore enter into the heart of any one that hath the least zeal for his religion, or love of liberty, that, hath any regard either to the honour or safety of his country, or a well wish for his friends or posterity, to think of a peace with <HI>France,</HI> till the <HI>Spanish</HI> monar∣chy be entirely torn from it, and the house of <HI>Bourbon</HI> disabled from ever giving the law to <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>Let us suppose that the <HI>French</HI> King would grant us the most advantageous terms we can desire; without the separation of the two monar∣chies they must infallibly end in our destruction. Should he secure to us all our present acquisi∣tions; should he add two or three frontier-towns to what we have already in <HI>Flanders</HI>; should he join the kingdoms of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia</HI> to <HI>Mi∣lan</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI>; should he leave King <HI>Charles</HI> in the peaceable possession of <HI>Catalonia</HI>; should
<PB N="247" REF="209"/>
he make over to <HI>Great Britain</HI> the town and harbour of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and at the same time resign his conquests in <HI>Portugal</HI>: it would all be of no effect towards the common safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> while the bulk of the <HI>Spanish</HI> continent and the riches of <HI>America</HI> remain in the possession of the <HI>Bourbon</HI> family.</P>
<P><HI>Boccalini</HI> when he weighs the States of <HI>Europe</HI> in his political balance, after having laid <HI>France</HI> ill one scale, throws <HI>Spain</HI> into the other, which wanted but very little of being a counter-poise. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this, says he, begun to pro∣mise themselves the honour of the ballance; reckoning that if <HI>Spain</HI> of it self weighed so well, they could not fail of success when the several parts of the monarchy were lumped in the same scale. Their surprise was very great when upon the throwing in of <HI>Naples</HI> they saw the scale rise, and was greater still when they found that <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> had the same effect. The truth of it is, these parts of the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy are ra∣ther for ornament than strength. They furnish out Vice-royalties for the Grandees, and posts of honour for the noble families; but in a time of war are incumbrances to the main body of the kingdom, and leave it naked and exposed by the great number of hands they draw from it to their defence. Should we therefore continue in the possession of what we have already made our selves masters, with such additions as have been mentioned, we should have little more than the excrescencies of the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy. The strength of it will still join it self to <HI>France,</HI> and grow the closer to it by its disunion from the rest. And in this case the advantages which must arise
<PB N="248" REF="210"/>
to that people from their intimate alliance with the remaining part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> dominions, would in a very few years not only repair all the damages they have sustained in the present war, but fill the kingdom with more riches than it hath yet had in its most flourishing periods.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King hath often entered on several expensive projects, on purpose to dissipate the wealth that is continually gathering in his coffers in times of peace. He hath employed immense sums on architecture, gardening, water-works, painting, statuary, and the like, to distribute his treasures among his people, as well as to hu∣mour his pleasures and his ambition; but if he once engrosses the commerce of the <HI>Spanish Indies,</HI> whatever quantities of gold and silver stagnate in his private coffers, there will be still enough to carry on the circulation among his subjects. By this means in a short space of time he may heap up greater wealth than all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> joined together; and in the present consti∣tution of the world, wealth and power are but different names for the same thing. Let us there∣fore suppose that after eight or ten years of peace, he hath a mind to infringe any of his treaties, or invade a neighbouring State; to revive the pre∣tensions of <HI>Spain</HI> upon <HI>Portugal,</HI> or attempt the taking those places which were granted us for our security; what resistance, what opposition can we make to so formidable an enemy? Should the same alliance rise against him that is now in war with him, what could we hope for from it, at a time when the States engaged in it will be comparatively weakened, and the enemy who is
<PB N="249" REF="211"/>
now able to keep them at a stand, will have re∣ceived so many new accessions of strength?</P>
<P>But I think it is not to be imagined that in such a conjuncture as we here suppose, the same confederates, or any other of equal force, could be prevailed upon to join their arms, and endea∣vour at the pulling down so exorbitant a power. Some might be bought into his interests by mo∣ney, others drawn over by fear, and those that are liable to neither of these impressions, might not think their own interest so much concerned as in the present war; or if any appeared in a dis∣position to enter into such a confederacy, they might be crushed separately before they could con∣cert measures for their mutual defence.</P>
<P>The keeping together of the present alliance can be ascribed to nothing else but the clear and evident conviction which every member of it is under, that if it should once break without ha∣ving had its effect, they can never hope for ano∣ther opportunity of reuniting, or of prevailing by all the joint efforts of such an union. Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt rule, and an in∣violable maxim, never to lay down our arms a∣gainst <HI>France,</HI> till we have utterly disjoined her from the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy. Let this be the first step of a publick treaty, the basis of a general peace.</P>
<P>Had the present war indeed run against us, and all our attacks upon the enemy been vain, it might look like a degree of frenzy, or a mixture of obstinacy and despair, to be determined on so impracticable an undertaking. But on the contra∣ry, we have already done a great part of our work, and are come within view of the end that we
<PB N="250" REF="212"/>
have been so long driving at. We remain victo∣rious in all the seats of war. In <HI>Flanders</HI> we have got into our hands several open countries, rich towns, and fortified places. We have dri∣ven the enemy out of all his alliances, dispossessed him of his strong holds, and ruined his allies in <HI>Germany.</HI> We have not only recovered what the beginning of the war had taken from us, but possessed ourselves of the kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and the avenue of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>I∣taly.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> war hath given us a haven for our ships, and the most populous and wealthy province of that kingdom. In short, we have ta∣ken all the outlying parts of the <HI>Spanish</HI> monar∣chy, and made impressions upon the very heart of it. We have beaten the <HI>French</HI> from all their advanced posts in <HI>Europe,</HI> and driven them into their last entrenchments. One vigorous push on all sides, one general assault will force the ene∣my to cry out for quarter, and surrender them∣selves at discretion. Another <HI>Blenheim</HI> or <HI>Ramil∣lies</HI> will make the confederates masters of their own terms, and arbitrators of a peace.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the advantages already gained are very considerable if we pursue them, they will be of no effect unless we improve them towards the carrying of our main point. The enemy staggers; if you follow your blow, he falls at your feet; but if you allow him respite, he will recover his strength, and come upon you with greater fury. We have given him several repeated wounds that have enfeebled him, and brought him low; but they are such as time will heal, unless you take advantage from his present weakness to redouble your attacks upon him.
<PB N="251" REF="213"/>
It was a celebrated part in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s character, and what comes home to our present purpose, that he thought nothing at all was done, while any thing remained undone. In short, we have been tugging a great while against the stream, and have almost weathered our point; a stretch or two more will do the work; but if instead of that we slacken our arms, and drop our oars, we shall be hurried back in a moment to the place from whence we first set out.</P>
<P>After having seen the necessity of an entire se∣paration of the kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> our subject naturally leads us into the considera∣tion of the most proper means for effecting it.</P>
<P>We have a great while flattered our selves with the prospect of reducing <HI>France</HI> to our own terms by the want of money among the peo∣ple, and the exigencies of the publick treasury; but have been still disappointed by the great sums imported from <HI>America,</HI> and the many new expedients which the Court hath found out for its relief. A long consumptive war is more likely to break the grand alliance, than disable <HI>France</HI> from maintaining sufficient armies to op∣pose it. An arbitrary government will never want money so long as the people have it; and so active a people will always have it, whilst they can send what merchandises they please to <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> since their al∣liance with <HI>Spain</HI> keep thirty ships in constant motion between the western ports of <HI>France</HI> and the south seas of <HI>America.</HI> The King himself is an adventurer in this traffick, and besides the share that he receives out of the gains of his subjects, has immense sums that come directly from it into his own hands.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="214"/>We may further consider, that the <HI>French</HI> since their abandoning <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> have very much retrenched the expence of the war, and lay out among themselves all the money that is consumed in it.</P>
<P>Many are of opinion, that the most probable way of bringing <HI>France</HI> to reason would be by the making an attempt upon the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> and by that means to cut off all commu∣nication with this great source of riches, or turn the current of it into our own country. This I must confess carries so promising an appear∣ance, that I would by no means discourage the attempt: but at the same time I think it should be a collateral project rather than our principal de∣sign. Such an undertaking (if well concerted, and put into good hands) would be of infinite advantage to the common cause: but certainly an enterprise that carries in it the fate of <HI>Europe,</HI> should not turn upon the uncertainty of winds and waves, and be liable to all the accidents that may befal a naval expedition.</P>
<P>Others there are that have long deceived them∣selves with the hopes of an insurrection in <HI>France,</HI> and are therefore for laying out all our strength on a descent. These, I think, do not enough consider the natural love which the gross of mankind have for the constitution of their fa∣thers. A man that is not enlightened by travel or reflexion, grows as fond of arbitrary power, to which he hath been used from his infancy, as of cold climates, or barren countries in which he hath been born and bred. Besides, there is a kind of sluggish resignation, as well as poorness and degeneracy of spirit, in a state of slavery,
<PB N="253" REF="215"/>
that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of recovering themselves out of it; as we find in history instances of per∣sons who after their prisons have been flung open, and their fetters struck off, have chosen rather to lan∣guish in their dungeons, than stake their miserable lives and fortunes upon the success of a revolution. I need not instance the general fate of descents, the difficulty of supplying men and provisions by sea against an enemy that hath both at hand, and without which it is impossible to secure those conquests that are often made in the first onsets of an invasion. For these and other reasons I can never approve the nursing up commotions and insurrections in the enemy's country, which for want of the necessary support are likely to end in the massacre of our friends and the ruin of their families.</P>
<P>The only means therefore for bringing <HI>France</HI> to our conditions, and what appears to me, in all human probability, a sure and infallible expe∣dient, is to throw in multitudes upon them, and overpower them with numbers. Would the con∣federacy exert it self as much to annoy the ene∣my, as they themselves do for their defence, we might bear them down with the weight of our armies, and in one summer overset the whole power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> monarchy is already exhausted of its best and bravest subjects. The flower of the nation is consumed in its wars: the strength of their armies consists at present of such as have saved themselves by flight from some or other of the victorious confederates; and the only proper persons to recruit them are but the refuse of those
<PB N="254" REF="216"/>
who have been already picked out for the service. Mareschal <HI>de Vauban,</HI> though infinitely partial in his calculations of the power of <HI>France,</HI> reckons that the number of its inhabitants was two mil∣lions less at the peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> than in the be∣ginning of the war that was there concluded: and though that war continued nine years, and this hath as yet lasted but six, yet considering that their armies are more strong and numerous; that there hath been much more action in the present war; and that their losses sustained in it have been very extraordinary; we may, by a moderate computa∣tion, suppose that the present war hath not been less prejudicial than the foregoing one in the ravage which it has made among the people. There is in <HI>France</HI> so great a disproportion between the num∣ber of males and females; and among the former, between those who are capable of bearing arms, and such as are too young, sickly, or decrepit for the service; and at the same time such vast numbers of Ecclesiasticks, secular and religious, who live upon the labours of others, that when the several trades and professions are supplied, you will find most of those that are proper for war absolutely necessary for filling up the laborious part of life, and carrying on the underwork of the nation. They have already contributed all their superfluous hands, and every new levy they make must be at the expence of their farms and vine∣yards, their manufactures and commerce.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the grand Alliance have in∣numerable sources of recruits, not only in <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>; but in all the populous parts of <HI>Germany</HI> that have little trade or manufactures, in propor∣tion
<PB N="255" REF="217"/>
to the number of their inhabitants. We may add, that the <HI>French</HI> have only <HI>Switzerland,</HI> be∣sides their own country, to recruit in; and we know the difficulties they meet with in getting thence a single regiment: whereas the Allies have not only the same resource, but may be supplied for money from <HI>Denmark</HI> and other neutral States. In short, the Confederates may bring to the field what forces they please, if they will be at the charge of them: but <HI>France,</HI> let her wealth be what it will, must content herself with the product of her own country.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are still in greater streights for sup∣plies of horse than men. The breed of their coun∣try is neither so good nor numerous as what are to be found in most of the countries of the Allies. They had last summer about threescore thousand in their several armies, and could not perhaps bring into the field thirty thousand more, if they were disposed to make such an augmentation.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> horse are not only few, but weak in comparison of ours. Their cavalry in the battle of <HI>Blenheim</HI> could not sustain the shock of the <HI>British</HI> horse. For this reason our late way of attacking their troops sword in hand is very much to the advantage of our nation, as our men are more robust, and our horses of a stronger make than the <HI>French</HI>; and in such attacks it is the weight of the forces, supposing equal courage and conduct, that will always carry it. The <HI>English</HI> strength turned very much to account in our wars against the <HI>French</HI> of old, when we used to gall them with our long bows, at a greater di∣stance than they could shoot their arrows: this advantage we lost upon the invention of fire-arms,
<PB N="256" REF="218"/>
but by the present method our strength as well as bravery may again be of use to us in the day of battle.</P>
<P>We have very great encouragement to send what numbers we are able into the field, because our Generals at present are such as are likely to make the best use of them, without throwing them away on any fresh attempts or ill-concert∣ed projects. The Confederate armies have the happiness of being commanded by persons who are esteemed the greatest leaders of the present age, and are perhaps equal to any that have prece∣ded them. There is a sort of resemblance in their characters; a particular sedateness in their conversation and behaviour, that qualifies them for council, with a great intrepidity and resolu∣tion that fits them for action. They are all of them men of concealed fire, that doth not break out with noise and heat in the ordinary circum∣stances of life; but shews it self sufficiently in all great enterprises that require it. It is true, the General upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> hath not had the same occasions as the others to signalize himself; but if we consider the great vigilance, activity and courage, with the consummate prudence, and the nice sense of honour which appears in that Prince's character, we have great reason to hope, that as he purchased the first success in the present war, by forcing into the service of the Confederates an army that was raised against them in the very heart of the Empire, he will give one of the fi∣nishing strokes to it, and help to conclude the great work which he so happily begun. The sud∣den check that he gave to the <HI>French</HI> army the last campaign, and the good order he established
<PB N="257" REF="219"/>
in that of the <HI>Germans,</HI> look like happy presa∣ges of what we may expect from his conduct. I shall not pretend to give any character of the Generals on the enemies side; but I think we may say this, that in the eyes of their own nation they are inferior to several that have formerly com∣manded the <HI>French</HI> armies. If then we have greater numbers than the <HI>French,</HI> and at the same time better Generals, it must be our own fault if we will not reap the fruit of such advantages.</P>
<P>It would be loss of time to explain any farther our superiority to the enemy in numbers of men and horse. We see plainly that we have the means in our hands, and that nothing but the application of them is wanting. Let us only con∣sider what use the enemy would make of the ad∣vantage we have mentioned, if it fell on their side; and is it not very strange that we should not be as active and industrious for our security, as they would certainly be for our destruction? But be∣fore we consider more distinctly the method we ought to take in the prosecution of the war, un∣der this particular view, let us reflect a little upon those we have already taken in the course of it for these six years past.</P>
<P>The Allies after a successful summer are too apt, upon the strength of it, to neglect their pre∣parations for the ensuing campaign, while the <HI>French</HI> leave no art nor stratagem untried to fill up the empty spaces of their armies, and swell them to an equal bulk with those of the Confede∣rates. By this means our advantage is lost, and the fate of <HI>Europe</HI> brought to a second decision. It is now become an observation, that we are to expect a very indifferent year after a very success∣ful
<PB N="258" REF="220"/>
one. <HI>Blenheim</HI> was followed by a summer that makes no noise in the war. <HI>Ramillies, Turin,</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> were the parents of our last cam∣paign. So many dreadful blows alarmed the ene∣my, and raised their whole country up in arms. Had we on our side made proportionable prepara∣tions, the war by this time had been brought to a happy issue. If after having gained the great vi∣ctories of <HI>Blenheim</HI> and <HI>Ramillies,</HI> we had made the same efforts as we should have done had we lost them, the power of <HI>France</HI> could not have withstood us.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the winter we usually get what intelligence we can of the force which the enemy intends to employ in the campaigns of the succeeding year, and immediately cast about for a sufficient number of troops to face them in the field of battle. This, I must confess, would be a good method if we were engaged in a de∣fensive war. We might maintain our ground with an equal number of forces; but our business is not only to secure what we are already in possession of; we are to wrest the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy out of the hands of the enemy; and in order to it, to work our way into the heart of his country by dint of arms. We should there∣fore put forth all our strength, and without hav∣ing an eye to his preparations, make the greatest push that we are able on our own side. We are told that the enemy at present thinks of raising threescore thousand men for the next summer; if we regulate our levies in that view, we do no∣thing; let us perform our utmost, as they do, and we shall overwhelm them with our multitudes. We have it in our power at least to be four times
<PB N="259" REF="221"/>
as strong as the <HI>French,</HI> but if ten men are in war with forty, and the latter detach only an e∣qual number to the engagement, what benefit do they receive from their superiority?</P>
<P>It seems therefore to be the business of the Con∣federates to turn to their advantage their apparent odds in men and horse; and by that means to out-number the enemy in all rencounters and en∣gagements. For the same reason it must be for the interest of the Allies to seek all opportu∣nities of battle, because all losses on the opposite side are made up with infinitely more difficulty than on ours; besides that the <HI>French</HI> do their business by lying still, and have no other con∣cern in the war than to hold fast what they have already got into their hands.</P>
<P>The miscarriage of the noblest project that ever was formed in <HI>Europe,</HI> can be ascribed to no∣thing else but our want of numbers in the several quarters of the war. If our armies on all sides had begun to busy and insult the enemy, at the same time that the forces marched out of <HI>Pie∣mont, Toulon</HI> had been at present in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> But could that Prince ever have imagined that the <HI>French</HI> would have been at liberty to detach whole armies against him? or will it appear credible to posterity, that in a war carried on by the joint force of so many populous and powerful nations, <HI>France</HI> could send so great a part of its troops to one seat of the war, without suffering in any of the rest? Whereas it is well known, that if the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had continued before <HI>Toulon</HI> eight days longer, he had been attacked by an army of sixty thousand men, which was more than double the
<PB N="260" REF="222"/>
number of his own; and yet the enemy was strong enough every where else to prevent the Confederates from making any impression upon them. However, let us fall into the right mea∣sures, and we may hope that the stroke is only de∣ferred. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> hath secured a passage into <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> and if the Allies make such efforts in all parts, as we may reasonably expect from them, that Prince may still make himself Master of the <HI>French</HI> dominions on the other side of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>There is another part of our conduct which may perhaps deserve to be considered. As soon as we have agreed with the States-General upon any augmentation of our forces, we immediate∣ly negotiate with some or other of the <HI>German</HI> Princes, who are in the same confederacy, to fur∣nish out our quota in Mercenaries. This may be doubly prejudicial to the alliance; First, as it may have an ill influence on the resolutions of those Princes in the Diet of the Empire, who may be willing to settle as small a quota as they can for themselves, that they may have more troops to hire out; and in the next place, as it may hin∣der them from contributing the whole quota which they have settled This actually happened in the last campaign, when we are told the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> excused themselves for their want of troops upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as having already put most of their forces into the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> service. Such an excuse, indeed, is very unjust, but it would be better to give them no occasion of making it; and on such occasions to consider what men are apt to do, as well as what they may do with reason.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="223"/>It might therefore be for our advantage that all the foreign troops in the <HI>British</HI> pay should be rai∣sed in neutral countries. <HI>Switzerland</HI> in parti∣cular, if timely applied to, might be of great use to us; no only in respect of the reinforcements which we might draw from thence, but be∣cause such a draught of forces would lessen the number of those that might otherwise be employ∣ed in the <HI>French</HI> service. The bulk of our levies should nevertheless be raised in our own coun∣try, it being impossible for neutral States to fur∣nish both the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> with a sufficient number of effective men; besides that the <HI>British</HI> soldiers will be more at the disposal of their Ge∣neral, and act with greater vigour under the conduct of one for whom they have so just a va∣lue, and whom they do not consider only as their leader, but as their country-man. We may like∣wise suppose that the soldiers of a neutral state, who are not animated by any national interest, cannot fight for pay with the same ardour and alacrity, as men that fight for their Prince and country, their wives and children.</P>
<P>It may likewise be worth while to consider whether the military Genius of the <HI>English</HI> nation may not fall by degrees, and become inferior to that of our neighbouring states, if it hath no oc∣casion to exert it self. Minds that are altogether set on trade and profit, often contract a certain narrowness of temper, and at length become un∣capable of great and generous resolutions. Should the <HI>French</HI> ever make an unexpected de∣scent upon us, we might want soldiers of our own growth to rise up in our defence; and might not have time to draw a sufficient number of
<PB N="262" REF="224"/>
troops to our relief from the remote corners of <HI>Germany.</HI> It is generally said, that if King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had made war upon <HI>France</HI> in the be∣ginning of his reign, he might have conquered it by the many veterans which were scattered up and down this kingdom, and had been inured to service in the civil wars. It is to be hoped we shall never have such another nursery of soldiers; but if the present war gives a more military turn to all other nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to our own, it is to be feared we may lose in strength, what we gain in number. We may apply the same con∣sideration nearer home. If all our levies are made in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> may not those two parts of the <HI>British</HI> monarchy, after the disbanding of the present army, be too powerful for the rest, in case of a revolt? though, God be thanked, we are not in any danger of one at present. However, as these considerations do not concern the more essential part of our design, it is suffi∣cient to have mentioned them.</P>
<P>The sparing of our selves in so important a conjuncture, when we have but this single op∣portunity left for the preserving every thing that is precious amongst us, is the worst sort of ma∣nagement that we can possibly fall into. The good husbandry of one age may intail an endless expence upon all posterity. We must venture the sacri∣ficing a part of our lives and fortunes at present, if we will effectually secure both for the future. The <HI>British</HI> Kingdom is so well stock'd with people, and so much abounds in horse, that we have power enough in our own hands, did we make our outmost use of it, to humble <HI>France,</HI> and in a campaign or two to put an end to the war.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="225"/>There is not a more disagreeable thought to the people of <HI>Great Britain</HI> than that of a standing ar∣my. But if a peace be made before the disunion of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> there are few, perhaps, that will not think the maintaining a settled body of numerous forces indispensable for the safety of our country. We have it therefore in our choice to raise such a strong reinforcement of troops as at present may be sufficient, in conjunction with those of the allies, for breaking the strength of the enemy; or when the peace is concluded, to keep on foot such an army as will be necessa∣ry for preventing his attempts upon us.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that those who would be the most zealous against keeping up a constant body of regular troops after a general peace, will the most distinguish themselves for the promoting an augmentation of those which are now on foot; and by that means take care that we shall not stand in need of such an expedient.</P>
<P>We are indeed obliged by the present situation of our affairs to bring more troops into the field than we have yet done. As the <HI>French</HI> are retired within their lines, and have collected all their strength into a narrow compass, we must have greater numbers to charge them in their in∣trenchments, and force them to a battle. We saw the last campaign that an army of fourscore thousand of the best troops in <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> at the head of them, could do nothing against an enemy that were too nume∣rour to be assaulted in their camps, or attacked in their strong holds.</P>
<P>There is another consideration which deserves our utmost attention. We know very well,
<PB N="264" REF="226"/>
that there is a Prince at the head of a powerful ar∣my, who may give a turn to the war, in which we are engaged, if he thinks fit to side with either party. I cannot presume to guess how far our ministers may be informed of his designs: but unless they have very strong assurances of his falling in with the grand alliance, or not opposing it, they cannot be too circumspect and speedy in taking their precautions against any contrary re∣solution. We shall be unpardonable, if after such an expence of blood and treasure, we leave it in the power of any single Prince to command a peace, and make us accept what conditions he thinks fit. It is certain, according to the posture of our affairs in the last campaign, this Prince could have turn'd the ballance on either side; but it is to be hoped the liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> will not depend any more on the determination of one man's will. I do not speak this because I think there is any appearance of that Prince's uni∣ting himself to <HI>France.</HI> On the contrary, as he hath an extraordinary zeal for the reformed reli∣gion, and great sentiments of honour, I think it is not improbable we should draw him over to the con∣federacy, if we press him to it by proper motives. His love for religion, and his sense of glory, will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already distinguished himself by being a patron of protestants, and guarantee of the <HI>Westphalian</HI> trea∣ty. And if his interest hath any part in his acti∣ons, the allies may make him greater offers than the <HI>French</HI> King can do in the present conjun∣cture. There are large extents of dominion in the forfeited principalities of the Empire; doubt∣ful successions, to which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> seems
<PB N="265" REF="227"/>
to have very just pretensions; and at the same time a great title not yet disposed of, and a seat of war on the <HI>Moselle,</HI> where none of our gene∣rals have signalized themselves. It would be pre∣sumption to be particular in any proposals on such an occasion; it is enough to have shewn in gene∣ral, that there are fair opportunities, of which the wisdom of the confederates may make use.</P>
<P>Common sense will direct us, when we see so warlike a prince at the head of so great an army <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hovering on the borders of our confederates, ei∣ther to obtain his friendship, or secure our selves against the force of his arms. We are sure, whatever numbers of troops we raise, we shall have no hands but what will turn to account. Nay, we are certain, that extraordinary funds and augmentations for one or two campaigns may spare us the expence of many years, and put an end to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axes and levies for a whole age; whereas a long parsimonious war will drain us of more men and money, and in the end may prove inef∣fectual.</P>
<P>There is still a great popular objection, which will be made to every thing that can be urged on this subject. And indeed it is such a one as falls so much in with the prejudices and little passions of the multitude, that when it is turned and set off to advantage by ill-designing men, it throws a damp on the publick spirit of the nation, and gives a check to all generous resolutions for its honour and safety. In short, we are to be told, that <HI>England</HI> contributes much more than any other of the Allies, and that therefore it is not reasonable she should make any addition to her present efforts. If this were true in fact, I do
<PB N="266" REF="228"/>
not see any tolerable colour for such a conclu∣sion. Supposing among a multitude embarqued in the same vessel, there are several that in the fu∣ry of a tempest will rather perish than work for their preservation; would it not be madness in the rest to stand idle, and rather chuse to sink toge∣ther than do more than comes to their share? Since we are engaged in a work so absolutely ne∣cessary for our welfare, the remissness of our Al∣lies should be an argument for us to redouble our endeavours rather than slacken them. If we must govern our selves by example, let us rather imi∣tate the vigilance and activity of the common enemy, than the supineness and negligence of our friends.</P>
<P>We have indeed a much greater share in the war than any other part of the confederacy. The <HI>French</HI> King makes at us directly, keeps a King by him to set over us, and hath very lately aug∣mented the salary of his court, to let us see how much he hath that design at his heart. Few of the nations in war with him, should they ever fall into his hands, would lose their religion or form of government, or interfere at present with him in matters of commerce. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are likely to be the greatest losers after the <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI> have but little trade to the <HI>Levant</HI> in com∣parison with ours, have no considerable planta∣tions or commerce in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or any woollen-manufactures for <HI>Spain</HI>; not to men∣tion the strong barrier they have already purcha∣sed between <HI>France</HI> and their own country.</P>
<P>But after all, every nation in the confedera∣cy makes the same complaint, and fancies it self the greatest sufferer by the war. Indeed in
<PB N="267" REF="229"/>
to common a pressure, let the weight be never so equally distributed, every one will be most sensible of that part which lies on his own shoulders. We furnish, without dispute, more than any other branch of the Alliance: but the question is, whether others do not exert them∣selves in proportion according to their respective strength. The Emperor, the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as well as the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> seem at least to come up to us. The greatest powers in <HI>Germa∣ny</HI> are borrowing mony where they can get it, in order to maintain their stated Quota's, and go thorough their part of the expence: and if any of the Circles have been negligent, they have paid for it much more in their late contributions, than what would have furnished out their shares in the common charges of the war.</P>
<P>There are others who will object the poverty of the nation, and the difficulties it would find in furnishing greater supplies to the war than it doth at present. To this we might answer, that if the nation were really as poor as this ob∣jection makes it, it should be an argument for en∣forcing rather than diminishing our present efforts against <HI>France.</HI> The sinking our taxes for a few years would be only a temporary relief, and in a little time occasion far greater impositions, than those which are now laid upon us. Whereas the seasonable expence of part of our riches, will not only preserve the rest; but by the right use of them procure vast additions to our present stock. It may be necessary for a person lan∣guishing under an ill habit of body to lose several ounces of blood, notwithstanding it will weaken

him for a time, in order to put a new ferment into the remaining mass, and draw into it fresh supplies.</P>
<P>But we can by no means make this concession, to those who so industriously publish the nation's poverty. Our country is not only rich, but abounds in wealth much more than any other of the same extent in <HI>Europe. France,</HI> notwith∣standing the goodness of its climate, the fertility of its soil, the multitude of its inhabitants, its convenient harbours, both for the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Me∣diterranean,</HI> and its present correspondence with the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is not to compare with <HI>Great Britain</HI> in this particular. I shall transcribe word for word the passage of a late celebrated <HI>French</HI> Author, which will lay this matter in its full light; and leave the Reader to make the counter-part of the parallel between the two na∣tions.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">According to all the inquiries that I have been able to make during several years, in which I have applied my self to this sort of remarks, I have observed, that about a tenth part of the people of this kingdom are reduced to begga∣ry, and are actual beggars. That among the nine other parts, five are not in a condition to give alms or relief to those aforementioned, being very near reduced themselves to the same miserable condition. Of the four other remain∣ing parts, three are very uneasy in their cir∣cumstances, and embarrassed with debts and law-suits. In the tenth part, I reckon the Sol∣diers, Lawyers, Ecclesiasticks, Merchants and substantial Citizens, which cannot make up more than a hundred thousand families. And
<PB N="269" REF="231"/>
I believe I should not be mistaken, if I should say, that there are not above ten thousand of these families, who are very much at their ease: and if out of these ten thousand we should take the men that are employed in publick business, with their dependents and adherents, as also those whom the King supports by his boun∣ty, with a few Merchants, the number of those who remain will be surprizingly little.</Q>
<HI>Dixme Royale.</HI></P>
<P>What a dreadful account is this of nineteen millions of people; for so many the author rec∣kons in that kingdom. How can we see such a multitude of souls cast under so many subdivi∣sions of misery, without reflecting on the absur∣dity of a form of government that sacrifices the ease and happiness of so many reasonable Beings to the glory of one of their fellow-creatures? But this is not our affair at present.</P>
<P>If we run over the other nations of <HI>Europe</HI> that have any part in the present war, we shall only pass through so many different scenes of po∣verty. <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> are reduced to great extremities. <HI>Germany</HI> is exhausted to the last degree in many parts of it, and in others plundered of all she had left. <HI>Holland</HI> indeed flourishes above the rest in wealth and plenty: but if we consider the infinite industry and penu∣riousness of that people, the coarseness of their food and raiment, their little indulgences of plea∣sure and excess, it is no wonder that notwith∣standing they furnish as great taxes as their neigh∣bours, they make a better figure under them. In a common wealth there are not so many over∣grown estates as in monarchies, the wealth of the
<PB N="270" REF="232"/>
country is so equally distributed, that most of the community are at their ease, though few are placed in extraordinary points of splendor and magnificence. But notwithstanding these cir∣cumstances may very much contribute to the seem∣ing prosperity of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> we know they are indebted many millions more than their whole republick is worth, and if we consider the variety of taxes and impositions they groan under at a time when their private dissentions run high, and some of the wealthiest parts of the government refuse to bear their share in the pub∣lick expence, we shall not think the condition of that people so much to be envied as some amongst us would willingly represent it.</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Great Britain</HI> only rich as she stands in comparison with other States, but is really so in her own intrinsick wealth. She had never more ships at sea, greater quantities of merchandise in her warehouses, larger receipts of customs, or more numerous commodities rising out of her manufactures than she has at present. In short, she sits in the midst of a mighty affluence of all the necessaries and conveniences of life. If our silver and gold diminishes, our publick credit con∣tinues unimpaired, and if we are in want of bul∣lion, it lies in our own power to supply our selves. The old <HI>Roman</HI> General, when he heard his ar∣my complain of thirst, shewed them the springs and rivers that lay behind the enemy's camp. It is our own case: the rout of a <HI>Spanish</HI> army would make us masters of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>If Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> takes upon him the com∣mand of the confederate forces in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and meets with that support from the alliance
<PB N="271" REF="233"/>
which they are capable of giving him, we have a fair prospect of reducing <HI>Spain</HI> to the entire obe∣dience of the house of <HI>Austria.</HI> The <HI>Silesian</HI> fund (to the immortal reputation of those generous pa∣triots who were concerned in it) enabled that Prince to make a conquest of <HI>Italy,</HI> at a time when our affairs were more desperate there, than they are at present in the kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When our Parliament has done their utmost, another publick-spirited project of the same na∣ture, which the common enemy could not fore∣see nor prepare against, might in all probability set King <HI>Charles</HI> upon the throne for which he hath so long contended. One pitched battle would determine the fate of the <HI>Spanish</HI> continent.</P>
<P>Let us therefore exert the united strength of our whole Island, and by that means put a new life and spirit into the confederates, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir eyes fixed upon us, and will abate or increase <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir preparations according to the example that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s set them. We see the necessity of an aug∣mentation if we intend to bring the enemy to rea∣son, or rescue our country from the miseries that may befall it; and we find our selves in a condition of making such an augmentation as, by the blessing of God, cannot but prove effectual. If we carry it on vigorously, we shall gain for our selves and our posterity a long, a glorious and a lasting peace; but if we neglect so fair an opportunity, we may be willing to employ all our hands, and all our treasures, when it will be too late; and shall be tormented with one of the most melancholy reflexions of an afflicted heart, That it was once in our power to have made our selves and our children happy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> General division of the following discourse, with regard to <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI> Authors, who men∣tion particulars relating to our Saviour.</P>

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> And because many books of that age are lost.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> An instance of one record proved to be au∣thentick.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> A second record of probable, though not un∣doubted, authority.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><PB N="276" REF="236"/>I <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT I may lay before you a full state of the subject under our con∣sideration, and methodize the seve∣ral particulars that I touched upon in discourse with you; I shall first take notice of such <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors, as have given their testimony to the history of our Saviour; re∣duce these Authors under their respective classes, and shew what authority their testimonies carry with them. Secondly, I shall take notice of <HI>Jew∣ish</HI> Authors in the same light.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are many reasons, why you should not expect that matters of such a wonderful na∣ture should be taken notice of by those eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, who were contemporaries with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or by those who lived before his Disciples had personally appeared among them, and ascertained the report which had gone abroad concerning a life so full of miracles.</P>
<P>Supposing such things had happened at this day in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or among the <HI>Grisons,</HI> who make a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter figure in <HI>Europe</HI> than <HI>Judaea</HI> did in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, would they be immediately be∣lieved by those who live at a great distance from them? or would any certain account of them be transmitted into foreign countries, within so short a space of time as that of our Saviour's pub∣lick ministry? Such kinds of news, though never so true, seldom gain credit, till some time after they are transacted and exposed to the examina∣tion of the curious, who by laying together cir∣cumstances, attestations, and characters of those who are concerned in them, either receive or re∣ject what at first none but eye-witnesses could ab∣solutely
<PB N="277" REF="237"/>
believe or disbelieve. In a case of this sort, it was natural for men of sense and learn∣ing to treat the whole account as fabulous, or at farthest to suspend their belief of it, until all things stood together in their full light.</P>
<P N="3">III. Besides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were branded not only for superstitions different from all the religions of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, but in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous people; so that whatever reports of such a nature came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as false, frivolous, and improbable.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may further observe that the ordina∣ry practice of Magic in those times, with the ma∣ny pretended Prodigies, Divinations, Apparitions, and local Miracles among the Heathens, made them less attentive to such news from <HI>Judaea,</HI> till they had time to consider the nature, the occasion, and the end of our Saviour's miracles, and were awakened by many surprizing events to allow them any consideration at all.</P>
<P N="5">V. We are indeed told by St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> that the fame of our Saviour, during his life, went throughout all <HI>Syria,</HI> and that there followed him great multitudes of people from <HI>Galilee, Judaea, Decapolis, Idumaea,</HI> from beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> and from <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> Now had there been any historians of those times and places, we might have expected to have seen in them some account of those wonderful transactions in <HI>Judaea</HI>; but there is not any single Author extant, in any kind, of that age, in any of those countries.</P>
<P N="6">VI. How many books have perished in which possibly there might have been mention of our Saviour? Look among the <HI>Romans,</HI> how few of
<PB N="278" REF="238"/>
their writings are come down to our times? In the space of two hundred years from our Saviour's birth, when there was such a multitude of wri∣ters in all kinds, how small is the number of Au∣thors that have made their way to the present age?</P>
<P N="7">VII. One authentick Record, and that the most authentick heathen Record, we are pretty sure is lost. I mean the account sent by the Go∣vernor of <HI>Judaea,</HI> under whom our Saviour was judged, condemned, and crucified. It was the custom in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as it is to this day in all the governments of the world, for the praefects and vice-roys of distant provinces to transmit to their Soveraign a summary relation of every thing remarkable in their administration. That <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> in his account, would have touched on so extraordinary an event in <HI>Judaea,</HI> is not to be doubted; and that he actually did, we learn from <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who lived about a hundred years after our Saviour's death, resi∣ded, made Converts, and suffered martyrdom at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was engaged with Philosophers, and in a particular manner with <HI>Crescens</HI> the <HI>Cynick,</HI> who could easily have detected, and would not fail to have exposed him, had he quo∣ted a Record not in being, or made any false cita∣tion out of it. Would the great Apologist have challenged <HI>Crescens</HI> to dispute the cause of Chri∣stianity with him before the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, had he forged such an evidence? or would <HI>Crescens</HI> have refused the challenge, could he have trium∣phed over him in the detection of such a forgery? To which we must add, that the Apology, which appeals to this Record, was presented to a learn∣ed Emperor, and to the whole body of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="239"/>
Senate. This father in his apology, speak∣ing of the death and suffering of our Saviour, re∣fers the Emperor for the truth of what he says to the acts of <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> which I have here mentioned. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who wrote his Apology about fifty years after <HI>Justin,</HI> doubtless referred to the same Record, when he tells the Governor of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> having recei∣ved an account out of <HI>Palestine</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> of the Divine person who had appeared in that country, paid him a particular regard, and threatned to punish any who should accuse the christians; nay, that the Emperor would have adopted him among the Deities whom they worshipped, had not the Senate refused to come into his pro∣posal. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who gives us this history, was not only one of the most learned men of his age, but, what adds a greater weight to his au∣thority in this case, was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Nor can it be said, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> grounded his quotation upon the authority of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> be∣cause we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that Author. <HI>Eusebius</HI> mentions the same ancient Record, but as it was not extant in his time, I shall not insist upon his authority in this point. If it be objected that this particular is not mentioned in any <HI>Roman</HI> Historian, I shall use the same argument in a pa∣rallel case, and see whether it will carry any force with it. <HI>Ulpian</HI> the great <HI>Roman</HI> Lawyer gather∣ed together all the Imperial Edicts that had been made against the christians. But did any one ever say that there had been no such Edicts, be∣cause they were not mentioned in the histories of
<PB N="280" REF="240"/>
those Emperors? Besides, who knows but this circumstance of <HI>Tiberius</HI> was mentioned in o∣ther historians that have been lost, though not to be found in any still extant? Has not <HI>Suetoni∣us</HI> many particulars of this Emperor omitted by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> many that are not so much as hinted at by either? As for the spurious <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pilate,</HI> now extant, we know the occa∣sion and time of their writing, and that had there not been a true and authentick Record of this nature, they would never have been forged.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The story of <HI>Agbarus</HI> King of <HI>Edessa,</HI> relating to the letter which he sent to our Saviour, and to that which he received from him, is a re∣cord of great authority; and though I will not in∣sist upon it, may venture to say, that had we such an evidence for any fact in <HI>Pagan</HI> history, an Au∣thor would be thought very unreasonable who should reject it. I believe you will be of my o∣pinion, if you will peruse, with other Authors, who have appeared in vindication of these letters as genuine, the additional arguments which have been made use of by the late famous and learned Dr. <HI>Grabe,</HI> in the second volume of his <HI>Spicile∣gium.</HI></P>

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> What facts in the history of our Saviour might be taken notice of by <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> What particular facts are taken notice of, and by what <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors.</P>

<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> What facts in our Saviour's history not to be expected from <HI>Pagan</HI> writers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. WE now come to consider what un∣doubted authorities are extant among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers; and here we must premise, that some parts of our Saviour's history may be reasonably expected from <HI>Pagans.</HI> I mean such parts as might be known to those who lived at a distance from <HI>Judaea,</HI> as well as to those who were the followers and eye-witnesses of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Such particulars are most of these which follow, and which are all attested by some one or other of those heathen Authors, who lived in or near the age of our Saviour and his disciples. <HI>That</HI> Augustus Caesar <HI>had ordered the whole em∣pire to be censed or taxed,</HI> which brought our Sa∣viour's reputed parents to <HI>Bethlehem:</HI> This is mentioned by several <HI>Roman</HI> historians, as <HI>Taci∣tus,
<PB N="282" REF="242"/>
Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Dion. That a great light or a new star appeared in the east, which directed the wise men to our Saviour:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Chalcidius. That</HI> Herod, <HI>the King of</HI> Pa∣lestine, <HI>so often mentioned in the</HI> Roman <HI>history, made a great slaughter of innocent children,</HI> be∣ing so jealous of his successor, that he put to death his own sons on that account: This cha∣racter of him is given by several historians, and this cruel fact mentioned by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a heathen Author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark of doubt upon it. <HI>That our Saviour had been in</HI> Egypt: This <HI>Celsus,</HI> though he raises a monstrous story upon it, is so far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. <HI>That</HI> Pontius Pilate <HI>was Governor of</HI> Judaea, <HI>that our Saviour was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Tacitus. That many miraculous cures and works out of the ordinary course of nature were wrought by him:</HI> This is confessed by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, <HI>Por∣phyry,</HI> and <HI>Hierocles,</HI> all of them not only <HI>Pa∣gans,</HI> but professed enemies and persecutors of Christianity. <HI>That our Saviour foretold several things, which came to pass according to his predi∣ctions:</HI> This was attested by <HI>Phlegon</HI> in his an∣nals, as we are assured by the learned <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celsus. That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkness and a great earthquake:</HI> This is recorded by the same <HI>Phlegon</HI> the <HI>Trallian,</HI> who was likewise a <HI>Pagan</HI> and Freeman to <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor. We may here observe, that a native of <HI>Trallium,</HI> which was not situate at so great a distance from <HI>Pale∣stine,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="243"/>
might very probably be informed of such remarkable events as had passed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the age immediately preceding his own times, since several of his countrymen with whom he had conversed, might have received a confused report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably lived within the Shake of the earth∣quake, and the Shadow of the eclipse, which are recorded by this Author. <HI>That</HI> Christ <HI>was wor∣shipped as a God among the Christians; that they would rather suffer death than blaspheme him; that they received a sacrament, and by it entered into a vow of abstaining from sin and wickedness,</HI> conformable to the advice given by St. <HI>Paul; that they had private assemblies of worship, and used to join together in Hymns</HI>: This is the account which <HI>Pliny</HI> the younger gives of Christianity in his days, about seventy years after the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> and which agrees in all its circumstances with the accounts we have in holy writ, of the first state of Christianity after the crucifixion of our Blessed Saviour. <HI>That St.</HI> Peter, <HI>whose mi∣racles are many of them recorded in holy writ, did many wonderful works,</HI> is owned by <HI>Julian</HI> the apostate, who therefore represents him as a great Magician, and one who had in his possession a book of magical secrets left him by our Saviour. <HI>That the devils or evil spirits were subject to them,</HI> we may learn from <HI>Porphyry,</HI> who objects to Christianity, that since <HI>Jesus</HI> had begun to be worshipped, <HI>Aesculapius</HI> and the rest of the gods did no more converse with men. Nay, <HI>Celsus</HI> himself affirms the same thing in effect, when he says, that the power which seemed to reside in Christians, proceeded from the use of certain
<PB N="284" REF="244"/>
names, and the invocation of certain daemons. <HI>Origen</HI> remarks on this passage, that the Author doubtless hints at those Christians who put to flight evil spirits, and healed those who were pos∣sessed with them; a fact which had been often seen, and which he himself had seen, as he de∣clares in another part of his discourse against <HI>Cel∣sus.</HI> But at the same time he assures us, that this miraculous power was exerted by the use of no other name but that of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to which were ad∣ded several passages in his history, but nothing like any invocation to <HI>Daemons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Celsus</HI> was so hard set with the report of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atte∣stations concerning him, that though he often in∣timates he did not believe them to be true, yet knowing he might be silenced in such an answer, provides himself with another retreat, when beat∣ed out of this; namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of so many thousands at two different times with a few loaves and fishes, to the magical feasts of those <HI>Egyptian</HI> impostors, who would present their spe∣ctators with visionary entertainments that had in them neither substance nor reality: which, by the way, is to suppose, that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an apparition, or strength∣ned and refreshed with shadows. He knew very well that there were so many witnesses and actors, if I may call them such, in these two miracles, that it was impossible to refute such multitudes, who had doubtless sufficiently spread the fame of them, and was therefore in this place forced to re∣sort to the other solution, that it was done by ma∣gic. It was not enough to say that a miracle
<PB N="285" REF="245"/>
which appeared to so many thousand eye-witnes∣ses was a forgery of <HI>Christ</HI>'s disciples, and there∣fore supposing them to be eye-witnesses, he en∣deavours to shew how they might be deceived.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The unconverted heathens, who were pressed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who had actually seen them, were driven to account for them after the same manner: For, to work by magic in the heathen way of speak∣ing, was in the language of the <HI>Jews</HI> to cast out devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perverse interpretation on his miracles, has branded the malignity of those men, who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts started such an unreasonable objection, as a blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and decla∣red not only the guilt, but the punishment of so black a crime. At the same time he condescen∣ded to shew the vanity and emptiness of this ob∣jection against his miracles, by representing that they evidently tended to the destruction of those powers, to whose assistance the enemies of his doctrine then ascribed them. An argument, which, if duly weighed, renders the objection so very fri∣volous and groundless, that we may venture to call it even blasphemy against common sense. Would Magic endeavour to draw off the minds of men from the worship which was paid to stocks and stones, to give them an abhorrence of those e∣vil spirits who rejoiced in the most cruel sacrifi∣ces, and in offerings of the greatest impurity; and in short to call upon mankind to exert their whole strength in the love and adoration of that
<PB N="286" REF="246"/>
one Being, from whom they derived their exist∣ence, and on whom only they were taught to de∣pend every moment for the happiness and conti∣nuance of it? Was it the business of magic to hu∣manize our natures with compassion, forgiveness, and all the instances of the most extensive cha∣rity? Would evil spirits contribute to make men sober, chaste, and temperate, and in a word to pro∣duce that reformation, which was wrought in the moral world by those doctrines of our Savi∣our, that received their sanction from his miracles? Nor is it possible to imagine, that evil spirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their correspondence and intercourse with mankind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting themselves to those rites and ceremonies, which had done them so much ho∣nour. We see the early effect which Christianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that number of books, which were filled with the secrets of magic, and made a sacrifice to Christianity by the converts mentioned in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles. We have likewise an emi∣nent instance of the inconsistency of our Religion with magic, in the history of the famous <HI>Aqui∣la.</HI> This Person, who was a kinsman of the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> and likewise a man of great learning, notwithstanding he had embraced Chri∣stianity, could not be brought off from the studies of magic, by the repeated admonitions of his fel∣low-christians: so that at length they expelled him their society, as rather chusing to lose the reputation of so considerable a Proselyte, than communicate with one who dealt in such dark and infernal practices. Besides we may observe,
<PB N="287" REF="247"/>
that all the favourers of magic were the most pro∣fest and bitter enemies to the christian religion. Not to mention <HI>Simon Magus</HI> and many others, I shall only take notice of those two great perse∣cutors of christianity, the Emperors <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, both them initiated in the mysteries of divination, and skilled in all the depths of magic. I shall only add, that evil spi∣rits cannot be supposed to have concurred in the establishment of a religion which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they possest, and divested them of their influence on man∣kind: nor would I mention this particular, though it be unanimously reported by all the ancient christian Authors; did it not appear from the authorities above-cited, that this was a fact con∣fest by heathens themselves.</P>
<P N="5">V. We now see what a multitude of <HI>Pagan</HI> testimonies may be produced for all those remark∣able passages, which might have been expected from them: and indeed of several, that, I believe, do more than answer your expectation, as they were not subjects in their own nature so exposed to publick notoriety. It cannot be expected they should mention particulars, which were trans∣acted amongst the Disciples only, or among some few even of the Disciples themselves; such as the transfiguration, the agony in the garden, the ap∣pearance of <HI>Christ</HI> after his resurrection, and o∣thers of the like nature. It was impossible for a heathen author to relate these things; because if he had believed them, he would no longer have been a heathen, and by that means his testimony would not have been thought of so much vali∣dity. Besides, his very report of facts so favou∣rable
<PB N="288" REF="248"/>
to Christianity would have prompted men to say that he was probably tainted with their doctrine. We have a parallel case in <HI>Hecataeus,</HI> a famous <HI>Greek</HI> Historian, who had several pas∣sages in his book conformable to the history of the <HI>Jewish</HI> writers, which when quoted by <HI>Jose∣phus,</HI> as a confirmation of the <HI>Jewish</HI> history, when his heathen adversaries could give no other answer to it, they would need suppose that <HI>He∣cataeus</HI> was a <HI>Jew</HI> in his heart, though they had no other reason for it, but because his history gave greater authority to the <HI>Jewish</HI> than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Records.</P>

TO this list of heathen writers, who make mention of our Saviour, or touch upon any particulars of his life, I shall add those Authors who were at first heathens, and after∣wards concerted to Christianity; upon which ac∣count, as I shall here shew, their testimonies are to be looked upon as the more authentick. And in this list of evidences, I shall confine my self to such learned <HI>Pagans</HI> as came over to Christianity in the three first centuries, because those were the times in which men had the best means of infor∣ming themselves of the truth of our Saviour's hi∣story, and because among the great number of Philosophers who came in afterwards, under the reigns of christian Emperors, there might be seve∣ral who did it partly out of worldly motives.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us now suppose, that a learned heathen writer who lived within 60 years of our Savi∣our's crucifixion, after having shewn that false mi∣racles were generally wrought in obscurity, and before few or no witnesses, speaking of those which were wrought by our Saviour, has the fol∣lowing passage.
<Q REND="margQuotes">But his works were always seen, because they were true, they were seen by those who were healed, and by those who were raised from the dead. Nay these persons who were thus healed, and raised, were seen not only at the time of their being healed, and raised, but long afterwards. Nay they were seen not only all the while our Saviour was upon earth, but survived after his departure out of
<PB N="290" REF="250"/>
this world, nay some of them were living in our days.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. I dare say you would look upon this as a glorious attestation for the cause of Christianity, had it come from the hand of a famous <HI>Atheni∣an</HI> Philosopher. These forementioned words however are actually the words of one who lived about sixty Years after our Saviour's crucifixion, and was a famous Philosopher in <HI>Athens:</HI> but it will be said, he was a convert to Christianity. Now consider this matter impartially, and see if his testimony is not much more valid for that rea∣son. Had he continued a <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosopher, would not the world have said that he was not sincere in what he writ, or did not believe it; for, if so, would not they have told us he would have embraced Christianity? This was indeed the case of this excellent man: he had so thoroughly examined the truth of our Saviour's history, and the excellency of that religion which he taught, and was so entirely convinced of both, that he be∣came a Proselyte and died a Martyr.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Aristides</HI> was an <HI>Athenian</HI> Philosopher, at the same time, famed for his learning and wis∣dom, but converted to Christianity. As it can∣not be questioned that he perused and approved the apology of <HI>Quadratus,</HI> in which is the passage just now cited, he joined with him in an apolo∣gy of his own, to the same Emperor, on the same subject. This apology, tho' now lost, was extant in the time of <HI>Ado Viennensis, A. D.</HI> 870, and highly esteemed by the most learned <HI>Atheni∣ans,</HI> as that Author witnesses. It must have con∣tained great arguments for the truth of our Sa∣viour's history, because in it he asserted the divi∣nity
<PB N="291" REF="251"/>
of our Saviour, which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do allow that, generally speaking, a man is not so acceptable and unquestioned an evi∣dence in facts, which make for the advancement of his own party. But we must consider that, in the case before us, the persons to whom we ap∣peal, were of an opposite party, till they were per∣suaded of the truth of those very facts, which they report. They bear evidence to a history in de∣fence of Christianity, the truth of which histo∣ry was their motive to embrace Christianity. They attest facts which they had heard while they were yet heathens, and had they not found rea∣son to believe them, they would still have con∣tinued heathens, and have made no mention of them in their writings.</P>
<P N="6">VI. When a man is born under christian Parents, and trained up in the profession of that religion from a child, he generally guides himself by the rules of <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in believing what is deli∣vered by the Evangelists; but the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of antiquity, before they became Christians, were only guided by the common rules of <HI>Histori∣cal Faith:</HI> That is, they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in com∣mon fame, tradition, and the writings of those persons who related them, together with the num∣ber, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of those persons; and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the same reason to believe the history of our Saviour, as that of any other person to which they themselves were not actual∣ly eye-witnesses, they were bound by all the rules of historical faith, and of right reason, to give
<PB N="292" REF="252"/>
credit to this history. This they did accordingly, and in consequence of it published the same truths themselves, suffered many afflictions, and very often death it self, in the assertion of them. When I say, that an historical belief of the acts of our Saviour induced these learned <HI>Pagans</HI> to em∣brace his doctrine, I do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his precepts, the fulfilling of prophecies, the miracles of his Disciples, the ir∣reproachable lives and magnanimous sufferings of their followers, with other considerations of the same nature: but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or less with Philoso∣phers of that age, it is certain that a belief in the history of our Saviour was one motive with eve∣ry new convert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very basis and foundation of Christianity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To this I must further add, that as we have already seen many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ, attested by particular <HI>Pa∣gan</HI> Authors: the testimony of those I am now going to produce, extends to the whole history of our Saviour, and to that continued series of actions, which are related of him and his Disci∣ples in the books of the <HI>New-Testament.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. This evidently appears from their quo∣tations out of the Evangelists, for the confirma∣tion of any doctrine or account of our blessed Sa∣viour. Nay a learned man of our nation, who examined the writings of the most ancient Fathers in another view, refers to several passages in <HI>Ire∣naeus, Tertullian, Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Ori∣gen,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> by which he plainly shows that
<PB N="293" REF="253"/>
each of these early writers ascribe to the four E∣vangelists by name their respective histories; so that there is not the least room for doubting of their belief in the history of our Saviour, as recor∣ded in the Gospels. I shall add, that three of the five Fathers here mentioned, and probably four, were <HI>Pagans</HI> converted to Christianity, as they were all of them very inquisitive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philosophy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. IT happened very providentially to the ho∣nour of the Christian religion, that it did not take its rise in the dark illiterate ages of the world, but at a time when arts and sciences were at their height, and when there were men who made it the business of their lives to search after truth, and sift the several opinions of Phi∣losophers
<PB N="294" REF="254"/>
and wise men, concerning the duty, the end, and chief happiness of reasonable crea∣tures.</P>
<P N="2">II. Several of these therefore, when they had informed themselves of our Saviour's history, and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his disciples and followers, were so struck and convinced, that they professed themselves of that sect; notwithstanding, by this profession in that juncture of time, they bid fare∣well to all the pleasures of this life, renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin∣terrupted course of severities, and exposed them∣selves to publick hatred and contempt, to suffer∣ings of all kinds, and to death itself.</P>
<P N="3">III. Of this sort we may reckon those three early converts to Christianity, who each of them was a member of a Senate famous for its wisdom and learning. <HI>Joseph</HI> the <HI>Arimathean</HI> was of the <HI>Jewish Sanhedrim, Dionysius</HI> of the <HI>Athenian A∣reopagus,</HI> and <HI>Flavius Clemens</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Se∣nate; nay at the time of his death Consul of <HI>Rome.</HI> These three were so throughly satisfied of the truth of the Christian religion, that the first of them, according to all the reports of an∣tiquity, died a martyr for it; as did the second, unless we disbelieve <HI>Aristides,</HI> his fellow-citi∣zen and contemporary; and the third, as we are informed both by <HI>Roman</HI> and Christian Authors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Among those innumerable multitudes, who in most of the known nations of the world came over to Christianity at its first appearance, we may be sure there were great numbers of wise and learned men, beside those whose names are in the Christian records, who without doubt
<PB N="295" REF="255"/>
took care to examine the truth of our Saviour's history, before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers, for the sake of one that would not only cut them off from the allurements of this world, but subject them to every thing terrible or disagreeable in it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells the <HI>Roman</HI> Governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, compa∣nies, the palace, senate, and courts of judica∣ture were filled with Christians; as <HI>Arnobius</HI> as∣serts, that men of the finest parts and learning, Orators, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Lawyers, Physicians, Philosophers, despising the sentiments they had been once fond of, took up their rest in the Christian religion.</P>
<P N="5">V. Who can imagine that men of this chara∣cter did not thoroughly inform themselves of the history of that person, whose doctrines they em∣braced? for however consonant to reason his pre∣cepts appeared, how good soever were the ef∣fects which they produced in the world, nothing could have tempted men to acknowledge him as their God and Saviour, but their being firmly persuaded of the miracles he wrought, and the many attestations of his divine mission, which were to be met with in the history of his life. This was the ground-work of the Christian re∣ligion, and, if this failed, the whole superstru∣cture sunk with it. This point therefore, of the truth of our Saviour's history, as recorded by the Evangelists, is every where taken for granted in the writings of those, who from <HI>Pagan</HI> Philoso∣phers became Christian Authors, and who, by reason of their conversion, are to be looked upon as of the strongest collateral testimony for the
<PB N="296" REF="256"/>
truth of what is delivered concerning our Sa∣viour.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Besides innumerable Authors that are lost, we have the undoubted names, works, or frag∣ments of several <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers, which shew them to have been as learned as any unconverted heathen Authors of the age in which the lived. If we look into the greatest nurseries of learn∣ing in those ages of the world, we find in <HI>Athens, Dionysius, Quadratus, Aristides, Athenagoras</HI>; and in <HI>Alexandria, Dionysius, Clemens, Ammo∣nius, Arnobius,</HI> and <HI>Anatolius,</HI> to whom we may add <HI>Origen</HI>; for though his father was a Christian martyr, he became, without all controversy, the most learned and able Philosopher of his age, by his education at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in that famous semi∣nary of arts and sciences.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. IT now therefore only remains to consider, whether these learned men had means and opportunities of informing themselves of the truth of our Saviour's history; for unless this point can be made out, their testimonies will ap∣pear invalid, and their enquiries ineffectual.</P>
<P N="2">II. As to this point, we must consider, that many thousands had seen the transactions of our Saviour in <HI>Judaea,</HI> and that many hundred thou∣sands had received an account of them from the mouths of those who were actually eye-witnes∣ses. I shall only mention among these eye-wit∣nesses the twelve Apostles, to whom we must
<PB N="298" REF="258"/>
add St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had a particular call to this high office, though many other disciples and fol∣lowers of <HI>Christ</HI> had also their share in the pub∣lishing this wonderful history. We learn from the ancient records of Christianity, that many of the Apostles and Disciples made it the express business of their lives, travelled into the remo∣test parts of the world, and in all places gathered multitudes about them, to acquaint them with the history and doctrines of their crucified Ma∣ster. And indeed, were all Christian records of these proceedings entirely lost, as many have been, the effect plainly evinces the truth of them; for how else during the Apostles lives could Christianity have spread itself with such an ama∣zing progress through the several nations of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire? how could it fly like lightning, and carry conviction with it, from one end of the earth to the other?</P>
<P N="3">III. Heathens therefore of every age, sex, and quality, born in the most different climates, and bred up under the most different institutions, when they saw men of plain sense, without the help of learning, armed with patience and courage, in∣stead of wealth, pomp, or power, expressing in their lives those excellent doctrines of Morality, which they taught as delivered to them from our Saviour, averring that they had seen his mi∣racles during his life, and conversed with him af∣ter his death; when, I say, they saw no suspicion of falshood, treachery, or worldly interest, in their behaviour and conversation, and that they submit∣ted to the most ignominious and cruel deaths, ra∣ther than retract their testimony, or even be si∣lent in matters which they were to publish by their
<PB N="299" REF="259"/>
Saviour's especial command, there was no rea∣son to doubt of the veracity of those facts which they related, or of the Divine Mission in which they were employed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But even these motives to Faith in our Sa∣viour would not have been sufficient to have brought about in so few years such an incredible number of conversions, had not the Apostles been able to exhibit still greater proofs of the truths which they taught. A few persons of an odious and despised country could not have filled the world with Believers, had they not shown undoubted credentials from the Divine person who sent them on such a message. According∣ly we are assured, that they were invested with the power of working miracles, which was the most short and the most convincing argument that could be produced, and the only one that was a∣dapted to the reason of all mankind, to the capa∣cities of the wise and ignorant, and could over∣come every cavil and every prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the sick, and raised the dead, when it was published by those who themselves often did the same mi∣racles, in their presence, and in his name! Could any reasonable person imagine, that God Almigh∣ty would arm men with such powers to autho∣rize a lye, and establish a religion in the world which was displeasing to him, or that evil spirits would lend them such an effectual assistance to beat down vice and idolatry?</P>
<P N="5">V. When the Apostles had formed many as∣semblies in several parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, who gave credit to the glad tidings of the Gospel, that, upon their departure, the memory of what they
<PB N="300" REF="260"/>
had related might not perish, they appointed out of these new converts, men of the best sense, and of the most unblemished lives, to preside over these several Assemblies, and to inculcate with∣out ceasing what they had heard from the mouths of these eye-witnesses.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Upon the death of any of those substitutes to the Apostles and Disciples of <HI>Christ,</HI> his place was filled up with some other person of emi∣nence for his piety and learning, and generally a member of the same Church, who after his de∣cease was followed by another in the same man∣ner, by which means the succession was continu∣ed in an uninterrupted line. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> informs us, that every church preserved a catalogue of its Bishops in the order that they succeeded one a∣nother, and (for an example) produces a cata∣logue of those who governed the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in that character, which contains eight or nine persons, though but at a very small remove from the times of the Apostles.</P>
<P>Indeed the lists of Bishops, which are come down to us in other churches, are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect. But the succession was quick in the three first centuries, because the Bishop very often ended in the Martyr: for when a persecution arose in any place, the first fury of it fell upon this Order of holy men, who abundantly testified by their Deaths and Sufferings that they did not under∣take these offices out of any temporal views, that they were sincere and satisfied in the belief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhe∣red to what they had received from the Apostles, as laying down their lives in the same hope, and upon the same principles. None can be suppo∣sed
<PB N="301" REF="261"/>
so utterly regardless of their own happiness as to expire in torment, and hazard their Eter∣nity, to support any fables and inventions of their own, or any forgeries of their predecessors who had presided in the same church, and which might have been easily detected by the tradi∣tion of that particular church, as well as by the concurring testimony of others. To this purpose, I think it is very remarkable, that there was not a single Martyr among those many Hereticks, who disagreed with the Apostolical church, and intro∣duced several wild and absurd notions into the doctrines of Christianity. They durst not stake their present and future happiness on their own chimerical imaginations, and did not only shun persecution, but affirmed that it was unnecessary for their followers to bear their religion through such fiery tryals.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We may fairly reckon, that this first age of Apostles and Disciples, with that second gene∣ration of many who were their immediate con∣verts, extended itself to the middle of the second Century, and that several of the third generation from these last mentioned, which was but the fifth from <HI>Christ,</HI> continued to the end of the third Century. Did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church, which was planted by the Apostles, I doubt not but in most of them there might be found five persons who in a continued series would reach through these three centuries of years, that is till the 265th from the death of our Saviour.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Among the accounts of those very few out of innumerable multitudes, who had embra∣ced Christianity, I shall single out four persons, eminent for their lives, their writings, and their
<PB N="302" REF="262"/>
sufferings, that were successively contemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. <HI>John,</HI> who was the beloved Di∣sciple, and conversed the most intimately with our Saviour, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 100. <HI>Poly∣carp,</HI> who was the Disciple of St. <HI>John,</HI> and had conversed with others of the Apostles and Disci∣ples of our Lord, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 167, though his life was shortened by martyrdom. <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> who was the Disciple of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> and had con∣versed with many of the immediate Disciples of the Apostles, lived, at the lowest computation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewise cut off by martyrdom; in which year the great <HI>Origen</HI> was appointed Regent of the Catechetick school in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and as he was the miracle of that age, for industry, learning and philoso∣phy, he was looked upon as the champion of Christianity, till the year 254, when, if he did not suffer martyrdom, as some think he did, he was certainly actuated by the spirit of it, as ap∣pears in the whole course of his life and writings; nay, he had often been put to the torture, and had undergone tryals worse than death. As he con∣versed with the most eminent Christians of his time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the East, brought over multitudes both from heresy and heathenism, and left behind him several Disciples of great fame and learning, there is no question but there were considerable numbers of those who knew him, and had been his hearers, scholars, or proselytes, that lived till the end of the third century, and to the reign of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is evident to those, who read the lives and writings of <HI>Polycarp, Irenaeus,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> that these three Fathers believed the accounts
<PB N="303" REF="263"/>
which are given of our Saviour in the four Evan∣gelists, and had undoubted arguments that not only St. <HI>John,</HI> but many others of our Saviour's disciples, published the same accounts of him. To which we must subjoin this further remark, that what was believed by these Fathers on this sub∣ject, was likewise the belief of the main body of Christians in those successive ages when they flou∣rished; since <HI>Polycarp</HI> cannot but be looked up∣on, if we consider the respect that was paid him, as the representative of the Eastern Churches in this particular, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> of the Western upon the same account, and <HI>Origen</HI> of those established in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. To these I might add <HI>Paul</HI> the famous her∣mite, who retired from the <HI>Decian</HI> persecution five or six years before <HI>Origen</HI>'s death, and lived till the year 343. I have only discovered one of those channels by which the history of our Savi∣our might be conveyed pure and unadulterated, through those several ages that produced those <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers, whose testimonies I make use of for the truth of our Saviour's history. Some or other of these Philosophers came into the Christian faith during its infancy, in the seve∣ral periods of these three first centuries, when they had such means of informing themselves in all the particulars of our Saviour's history. I must fur∣ther add, that though I have here only chosen this single link of martyrs, I might find out others among those names which are still extant, that delivered down this account of our Saviour in a successive tradition, till the whole <HI>Roman</HI> em∣pire became Christian; as there is no question but numberless series of witnesses might follow
<PB N="304" REF="264"/>
one another in the same order, and in as short a chain, and that perhaps in every single Church, had the names and ages of the most eminent pri∣mitive Christians have been transmitted to us with the like certainty.</P>
<P N="11">XI. But to give this consideration more force, we must take notice, that the tradition of the first ages of Christianity had several circumstances peculiar to it, which made it more authentick than any other tradition in any other age of the world. The Christians, who carried their reli∣gion through so many general and particular per∣secutions, were incessantly comforting and sup∣porting one another, with the example and history of our Saviour and his Apostles. It was the sub∣ject not only of their solemn assemblies, but of their private visits and conversations. <HI>Our virgins,</HI> says <HI>Tatian,</HI> who lived in the second century, <HI>dis∣course over their distaffs on divine subjects.</HI> In∣deed, when religion was woven into the civil go∣vernment, and flourished under the protection of the Emperors, men's thoughts and discourses were, as they are now, full of secular affairs; but in the three first centuries of Christianity, men, who embraced this religion, had given up all their interests in this world, and lived in a perpe∣tual preparation for the next, as not knowing how soon they might be called to it: so that they had little else to talk of but the life and doct∣rines of that divine person, which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory. We can∣not therefore imagine, that there was a single person arrived at any degree of age or considera∣tion, who had not heard and repeated above a thousand times in his life, all the particulars of
<PB N="305" REF="265"/>
our Saviour's birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Especially if we consider, that they could not then be received as Christians, till they had undergone several examinations. Persons of ri∣per years, who flocked daily into the Church during the three first centuries, were obliged to pass through many repeated instructions, and give a strict account of their proficiency, before they were admitted to Baptism. And as for those who were born of Christian parents, and had been baptised in their infancy, they were with the like care prepared and disciplined for confirma∣tion, which they could not arrive at, till they were found upon examination to have made a sufficient progress in the knowledge of Christi∣anity.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. We must further observe, that there was not only in those times this religious conversa∣tion among private Christians, but a constant cor∣respondence between the Churches that were e∣stablished by the Apostles or their successors, in the several parts of the world. If any new doct∣rine was started, or any fact reported of our Savi∣our, a strict enquiry was made among the Chur∣ches, especially those planted by the Apostles them∣selves, whether they had received any such doct∣rine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the Apostles, or the tradition of those Chri∣stians, who had preceded the present members of the Churches which were thus consulted. By this means, when any novelty was published, it was immediately detected and censured.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. St. <HI>John,</HI> who lived so many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in these emergen∣cies
<PB N="306" REF="266"/>
as the living Oracle of the Church; and as his oral testimony lasted the first century, many have observed that, by a particular providence of God, several of our Saviour's Disciples, and of the early converts of his religion, lived to a very great age, that they might personally convey the truth of the Gospel to those times, which were very remote from the first publication of it. Of these, besides St. <HI>John,</HI> we have a remark∣able instance in <HI>Simeon,</HI> who was one of the seventy sent forth by our Saviour, to publish the Gospel before his crucifixion, and a near kins∣man of the Lord. This venerable person, who had probably heard with his own ears our Savi∣our's prophecy of the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> presided over the Church established in that city, during the time of its memorable siege, and drew his congregation out of those dreadful and unpa∣rallel'd calamities which befel his countrymen, by following the advice our Saviour had given, when they should see <HI>Jerusalem</HI> encompassed with armies, and the <HI>Roman</HI> standards, or abomi∣nation of desolation, set up. He lived till the year of our Lord 107, when he was martyred under the Emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. THUS far we see how the learned <HI>Pa∣gans</HI> might apprize themselves from oral information of the particulars of our Saviour's history. They could hear, in every Church planted in every distant part of the earth, the account which was there received and preser∣ved among them, of the history of our Saviour. They could learn the names and characters of those first missionaries that brought to them these
<PB N="308" REF="268"/>
accounts, and the miracles by which God Al∣mighty attested their reports. But the Apostles and Disciples of <HI>Christ,</HI> to preserve the history of his life, and to secure their accounts of him from error and oblivion, did not only set aside certain persons for that purpose, as has been already shewn, but appropriated certain days to the commemora∣tion of those facts which they had related con∣cerning him. The first day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his resur∣rection, as the devotional exercises adapted to <HI>Fri∣day</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of those days, and that he rested in the grave on the other. You may apply the same remark to several of the annual festivals instituted by the Apostles themselves, or at furthest by their immediate Successors, in me∣mory of the most important particulars in our Sa∣viour's history; to which we must add the Sacra∣ments instituted by our Lord himself, and many of those rites and ceremonies which obtained in the most early times of the Church. These are to be regarded as standing marks of such facts as were delivered by those, who were eye-witnesses to them, and which were contrived with great wisdom to last till time should be no more. These, without any other means, might have, in some measure, conveyed to posterity, the memo∣ry of several transactions in the history of our Sa∣viour, as they were related by his Disciples. At least, the reason of these institutions, though they might be forgotten, and obscured by a long course of years, could not but be very well known by those who lived in the three first Cen∣turies, and a means of informing the inquisitive
<PB N="309" REF="269"/>
<HI>Pagans</HI> in the truth of our Saviour's history, that being the view in which I am to consider them.</P>
<P N="2">II. But least such a tradition, though guarded by so many expedients, should wear out by the length of time, the four Evangelists within about fifty, or, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> affirms, thirty years, after our Saviour's death, while the memory of his actions was fresh among them, consigned to writing that history, which for some years had been published only by the mouth of the Apo∣stles and Disciples. The further consideration of these holy penmen will fall under another part of this discourse.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will be sufficient to observe here, that in the age which succeeded the Apostles, many of their immediate Disciples sent or carrried in per∣son the books of the four Evangelists, which had been written by Apostles, or at least approved by them, to most of the Churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world. This was done with so much diligence, that when <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> a man of great learning and piety, had travelled into <HI>India</HI> for the propagation of Chri∣stianity, about the year of our Lord 200, he found among that remote people the Gospel of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> which upon his return from that country he brought with him to <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Gospel is generally supposed to have been left in those parts by St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apo∣stle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> who probably carried it with him before the writings of the three other Evan∣gelists were publish'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the history of our Saviour, as recor∣ded by the Evangelists, was the same with that which had been before delivered by the Apostles
<PB N="286" REF="270"/>
and Disciples, will further appear in the prosecu∣tion of this discourse, and may be gathered from the following considerations.</P>
<P N="5">V. Had these writings differed from the ser∣mons of the first planters of Christianity, either in history or doctrine, there is no question but they would have been rejected by those Churches which they had already formed. But so con∣sistent and uniform was the relation of the Apo∣stles, that these histories appeared to be nothing else but their tradition and oral attestations made fixt and permanent. Thus was the fame of our Saviour, which in so few years had gone through the whole earth, confirmed and perpetuated by such records, as would preserve the traditionary account of him to after-ages; and rectifie it, if at at any time, by passing through several genera∣tions, it might drop any part that was material, or contract any thing that was false or fictitious.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Accordingly we find the same <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who was born of a Virgin, who had wrought many miracles in <HI>Palestine,</HI> who was crucified, rose again, and ascended into Heaven; I say, the same <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> had been preached, and was worshipped, in <HI>Germany, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in <HI>Parthia, Media, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> in <HI>Ita∣ly, Egypt, Afric,</HI> and beyond <HI>Cyrene, India</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> and, in short, in all the islands and pro∣vinces that are visited by the rising or setting sun. The same account of our Saviour's life and do∣ctrine was delivered by thousands of Preachers, and believed in thousands of places, who all, as fast as it could be conveyed to them, received the
<PB N="287" REF="271"/>
same account in writing from the four Evange∣lists.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to this purpose very aptly re∣marks, that those barbarous nations, who in his time were not possest of the written gospels, and had only learned the history of our Saviour from those who had converted them to Christianity be∣fore the Gospels were written, had among them the same accounts of our Saviour, which are to be met with in the four Evangelists. An uncon∣testible proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy scripture and the tradition of the Churches in those early times of Christia∣nity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Thus we see what opportunities the learned and inquisitive heathens had of informing themselves of the truth of our Saviour's history, during the three first Centuries, especially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountain-head: beside which, there were many uncontroverted traditions, records of Christianity, and particular histories, that then threw light into these matters, but are now entirely lost, by which, at that time, any appearance of contradiction, or seeming dif∣ficulties, in the history of the Evangelists, were fully cleared up and explained: though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the histo∣ry of our Saviour, as related by the four Evange∣lists, than in the accounts of any other person, published by such a number of different histori∣ans who lived at so great a distance from the present age.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Among those records which are lost, and were of great use to the primitive Christians, is the letter to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> which I have already men∣tioned;
<PB N="312" REF="272"/>
that of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> which I shall take notice of hereafter; the writings of <HI>Hegesip∣pus,</HI> who had drawn down the history of Christi∣anity to his own time, which was not beyond the middle of the second Century; the genuine <HI>Sibyl∣line</HI> oracles, which in the first ages of the Church were easily distinguished from the spurious; the records preserved in particular Churches, with many other of the same nature.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THERE were other means, which I find had a great influence on the learned of the three first Centuries, to create and confirm in them the belief of our blessed Savi∣our's history, which ought not to be passed over in silence. The first was, the opportunity they en∣joyed
<PB N="313" REF="273"/>
of examining those miracles, which were on several occasions performed by Christians, and appeared in the Church, more or less, during these first ages of Christianity. These had great weight with the men I am now speaking of, who, from learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> became fathers of the Church; for they frequently boast of them in their writings, as attestations given by God him∣self to the truth of their religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. At the same time, that these learned men de∣clare how disigenuous, base and wicked it would be, how much beneath the dignity of Philosophy, and contrary to the precepts of Christianity, to utter falshoods or forgeries in the support of a cause, though never so just in it self, they con∣fidently assert this miraculous power, which then subsisted in the Church, nay, tell us that they themselves had been eye-witnesses of it at several times, and in several instances; nay, appeal to the heathens themselves for the truth of several facts they relate, nay challenge them to be pre∣sent at their assemblies, and satisfy themselves, if they doubt of it; nay we find that <HI>Pagan</HI> Au∣thors have in some instances confessed this mira∣culous power.</P>
<P N="3">III. The letter of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> whose ar∣my was preserved by a refreshing shower, at the same time that his enemies were discomfited by a storm of lightning, and which the heathen histori∣ans themselves allow to have been supernatural and the effect of magic: I say, this letter, which ascribed this unexpected assistance to the prayers of the Christians, who then served in the army, would have been thought an unquestionable testimony of the miraculous power I am speaking of,
<PB N="314" REF="274"/>
had it been still preserved. It is sufficient for me in this Place to take notice, that this was one of those miracles which had its influence on the lear∣ned Converts, because it is related by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and the very letter appealed to. When these learned men saw sickness and frenzy cured, the dead raised, the oracles put to silence, the <HI>Daemons</HI> and evil spirits forced to confess themselves no Gods, by persons who only made use of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified Sa∣viour; how could they doubt of their Saviour's power on the like occasions, as represented to them by the traditions of the Church, and the writings of the Evangelists?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Under this head, I cannot omit that which appears to me a standing miracle in the three first Centuries, I mean that amazing and supernatural courage or patience, which was shewn by innu∣merable multitudes of Martyrs, in those slow and painful torments that were inflicted on them. I cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at <HI>Lyons,</HI> amid the insults and mockeries of a crouded Amphitheatre, and still keeping his seat; or stretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his soul among the ex∣quisite sufferings of such a tedious execution, ra∣ther than renounce his religion, or blaspheme his Saviour. Such tryals seem to me above the strength of human nature, and able to over-bear duty, reason, faith, conviction, nay, and the most absolute certainty of a future state. Humanity, unassisted in an extraordinary manner, must have shaken off the present pressure, and have deliver'd it self out of such a dreadful distress, by any means that could have been suggested to it. We can
<PB N="315" REF="275"/>
easily imagine, that many persons, in so good a cause, might have laid down their lives at the gib∣bet, the stake, or the block: but to expire leisure∣ly among the most exquisite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental reser∣vation, or an hypocrisy which was not without a possibility of being followed by repentance and for∣giveness, has something in it, so far beyond the force and natural strength of mortals, that one cannot but think there was some miraculous pow∣er to support the sufferer.</P>
<P N="5">V. We find the Church of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in that ad∣mirable letter which gives an account of the death of <HI>Polycarp</HI> their beloved Bishop, mentioning the cruel torments of other early Martyrs for Christi∣anity, are of opinion, that our Saviour stood by them in a vision, and personally conversed with them, to give them strength and comfort during the bitterness of their long-continued agonies; and we have the story of a young man, who, having suffered many tortures, escaped with life, and told his fellow-christians, that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable, by the presence of an Angel who stood by him, and wiped off the tears and sweat, which ran down his face whilst he lay under his sufferings. We are assured at least that the first Martyr for Christianity was encouraged in his last moments, by a vision of that divine per∣son, for whom he suffered, and into whose pre∣sence he was then hastening.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart, and after reading these terrible conflicts in which the ancient Martyrs and Confessors were engaged, when they passed through such new in∣ventions and varieties of pain, as tired their tor∣mentors;
<PB N="316" REF="276"/>
and ask himself, however zealous and sincere he is in his religion, whether under such acute and lingring tortures he could still have held fast his integrity, and have professed his faith to the last, without a supernatural assistance of some kind or other. For my part, when I consider that it was not an unaccountable obstinacy in a single man, or in any particular sett of men, in some extraordinary juncture; but that there were multitudes of each sex, of every age, of different countries and conditions, who for near 300 years together made this glorious confession of their faith, in the midst of tortures, and in the hour of death: I must conclude, that they were ei∣ther of another make than men are at present, or that they had such miraculous supports as were peculiar to those times of Christianity, when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extinguished.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is certain, that the deaths and sufferings of the primitive Christians had a great share in the conversion of those learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> who lived in the ages of Persecution, which with some inter∣vals and abatements lasted near 300 years after our Saviour. <HI>Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactan∣tius, Arnobius,</HI> and others, tell us, that this first of all alarmed their curiosity, roused their attenti∣on, and made them seriously inquisitive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with so much strength, and overcome the fear of death, nay raise an earnest desire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of those Philosophers, whom they had thoroughly studied, and who had been labouring at this great
<PB N="317" REF="277"/>
point. The sight of these dying and tormented Martyrs engaged them to search into the history and doctrines of him for whom they suffered. The more they searched, the more they were con∣vinced; till their conviction grew so strong, that they themselves embraced the same truths, and ei∣ther actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readiness to do it, rather than depart from them.</P>

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> These arguments strengthened by what has hap∣pened since <HI>Origen</HI>'s time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE second of those extraordinary means, of great use to the learned and inquisitive <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three first Centuries, for evincing the truth of the history of our Saviour, was the completion of such prophecies as are
<PB N="318" REF="278"/>
recorded of him in the Evangelists. They could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold, and was fulfilled during his life, be∣cause both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were published by the Evange∣lists; though, as <HI>Origen</HI> observes, what end could there be in forging some of these predictions, as that of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying his master, and all his Disciples forsaking him in the greatest extremity, which reflects so much shame on the great A∣postle, and on all his companions? Nothing but a strict adherence to truth, and to matters of fact, could have prompted the Evangelists to re∣late a circumstance so disadvantageous to their own reputation; as that Father has well obser∣ved.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to pursue his reflections on this Sub∣ject. There are predictions of our Saviour re∣corded by the Evangelists, which were not com∣pleted till after their deaths, and had no likeli∣hood of being so, when they were pronounced by our blessed Saviour. Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they should be brought before Governours and Kings for his sake, for a testimony against them and the <HI>Gentiles, Mat.</HI> 10.28. with the other like prophecies, by which he foretold that his Disciples were to be persecuted. Is there any other doctrine in the world, says this Father, whose followers are punished? Can the enemies of <HI>Christ</HI> say, that he knew his opinions were false and impious, and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretell what would be the treatment of those persons who should embrace them? Supposing his doctrines were really such, why should this be the consequence? what likeli∣hood
<PB N="319" REF="279"/>
that men should be brought before Kings and Governours for opinions and tenets of any kind, when this never happened even to the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> who absolutely denied a Providence; nor to the <HI>Peripateticks</HI> themselves, who laughed at the prayers and sacrifices which were made to the Divinity? Are there any but the Christians who, according to this prediction of our Saviour, being brought before Kings and Governours for his sake, are pressed to their latest gasp of breath, by their respective judges, to renounce Christiani∣ty, and to procure their liberty and rest, by of∣fering the same sacrifices, and taking the same oaths that others did?</P>
<P N="3">III. Consider the time when our Saviour pro∣nounced those words, Matt. 10.32. <HI>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven: but whoso∣ever shall deny me before men, him will I also de∣ny before my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Had you heard him speak after this manner, when as yet his Disciples were under no such tryals, you would certainly have said within your self, If these speeches of <HI>Jesus</HI> are true, and if, accord∣ing to his prediction, Governours and Kings under∣take to ruin and destroy those who shall profess themselves his Disciples, we will believe (not only that he is a Prophet) but that he has re∣ceived power from God sufficient to preserve and propagate his religion; and that he would never talk in such a peremptory and discourag∣ing manner, were he not assured that he was able to subdue the most powerful opposition, that could be made against the faith and doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="320" REF="280"/>IV. Who is not struck with admiration, when he represents to himself our Saviour at that time foretelling, that his Gospel should be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, or as St. <HI>Origen</HI> (who rather quotes the sense than the words) to serve for a conviction to Kings and people, when at the same time he finds that his Gospel has accordingly been preached to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to the learned and to the ignorant, and that there is no quality or con∣dition of life able to exempt men from submitting to the doctrine of <HI>Christ.</HI> As for us, says this great Author, in another part of his book against <HI>Celsus?</HI>
<Q REND="margQuotes">When we see every day those events exactly accomplished which our Saviour foretold at so great a distance: That his Gospel is preached in all the world, <HI>Mat∣thew</HI> 24.14. That his Disciples go and teach all nations, <HI>Matthew</HI> 28.19. And that those, who have received his doctrine, are brought for his sake before Governours, and before Kings, <HI>Matthew</HI> 10.18. we are filled with admiration, and our faith in him is confirmed more and more. What clearer and stronger proofs can <HI>Celsus</HI> ask for the truth of what he spoke?</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Origen</HI> insists likewise with great strength on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour, concerning the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> pronoun∣ced at a time, as he observes, when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by so many others, that I shall refer you to what this Father has said on the subject in the first book against <HI>Celsus.</HI> And as to the accomplishment of this remarka∣ble
<PB N="321" REF="281"/>
prophecy, shall only observe, that whoever reads the account given us by <HI>Josephus,</HI> without knowing his character, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hi∣storian had been a Christian, and that he had no∣thing else in view but to adjust the event to the prediction.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I cannot quit this head without taking notice, that <HI>Origen</HI> would still have tri∣umphed more in the foregoing arguments, had he lived an age longer, to have seen the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and all their Governors and provin∣ces, submitting themselves to the Christian religi∣on, and glorying in its profession, as so many Kings and Soveraigns still place their relation to <HI>Christ</HI> at the head of their titles.</P>
<P>How much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received, had he seen our Saviour's prophecy stand good in the destruction of the temple, and the dissolution of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Oeco∣nomy, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> united all their endeavours under <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, to baffle and falsifie the prediction? The great preparations that were made for rebuilding the temple, with the hurricane, earthquake, and eruptions of fire, that destroyed the work, and terrified those em∣ployed in the attempt from proceeding in it, are related by many historians of the same age, and the substance of the story testified both by <HI>Pa∣gan</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI> writers, as <HI>Ammianus Marcel∣linus</HI> and <HI>Zemath-David.</HI> The learned <HI>Chry∣sostome,</HI> in a sermon against the <HI>Jews,</HI> tells them this fact was then fresh in the memories even of their young men, that it happened but twen∣ty years ago, and that it was attested by all the
<PB N="322" REF="282"/>
inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where they might still see the marks of it in the rubbish of that work, from which the <HI>Jews</HI> desisted in so great a fright, and which even <HI>Julian</HI> had not the cou∣rage to carry on. This fact, which is in it self so miraculous, and so indisputable, brought o∣ver many of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Christianity; and shows us, that after our Saviour's prophecy against it, the temple could not be preserved from the plough passing over it, by all the care of <HI>Titus,</HI> who would fain have prevented its destruction, and that instead of being re-edified by <HI>Julian,</HI> all his endeavours towards it did but still more literally accomplish our Saviour's prediction, that not one stone should be left upon ano∣ther.</P>
<P>The antient Christians were so entirely per∣suaded of the force of our Saviour's prophecies and of the punishment which the <HI>Jews</HI> had drawn upon themselves, and upon their children, for the treatment which the <HI>Messiah</HI> had received at their hands, that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and dispersed people, an hissing and an astonishment among the nati∣ons, as they are to this day. In short, that they had lost their peculiarity of being God's peo∣ple, which was now transferred to the body of Christians, and which preserved the Church of <HI>Christ</HI> among all the conflicts, difficul∣ties and persecutions, in which it was enga∣ged, as it had preserved the <HI>Jewish</HI> government and oeconomy for so many ages, whilst it had the same truth and vital principle in it, notwithstand∣ing it was so frequently in danger of being utterly abolished and destroyed. <HI>Origen,</HI> in his fourth
<PB N="323" REF="283"/>
book against <HI>Celsus,</HI> mentioning their being cast out of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the place to which their wor∣ship was annexed, deprived of their temple and sacrifice, their religious rites and solemnities, and scattered over the face of the earth, ventures to assure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-established, since they had committed that horrid crime against the Sa∣viour of the world. This was a bold assertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been so wonderfully re-established in former times, when they were almost swallowed up, and in the most desperate state of desolation, as in their deliverance out of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity, and the oppressions of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes.</HI> Nay, he knew that within less than a hundred years be∣fore his own time, the <HI>Jews</HI> had made such a powerful effort for their re-establishment under <HI>Barchocab,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Adrian,</HI> as shook the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire. But he founded his opi∣nion on a sure word of prophecy, and on the punishment they had so justly incurred; and we find, by a long experience of 1500 years, that he was not mistaken, nay that his opinion gathers strength daily, since the <HI>Jews</HI> are now at a grea∣ter distance from any probability of such a re-establishment, than they were when <HI>Origen</HI> wrote.</P>

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Pursued:</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Pursued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THERE was one other means enjoyed by the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three first centuries, for satisfying them in the truth of our Saviour's history, which I might have flung under one of the foregoing heads; but as it is so shining a particular, and does so much honour to our religion, I shall make a distinct article of it, and only consider it with regard to the subject I am upon: I mean the lives and manners of those holy men, who believed in <HI>Christ</HI> during the first ages of Christianity. I should be thought to advance a paradox, should I affirm that there were More Christians in the world during those times of persecution, than there are at present in these which we call the
<PB N="325" REF="285"/>
flourishing times of Christianity. But this will be found an indisputable truth, if we form our calculation upon the opinions which prevailed in those days, that every one who lives in the ha∣bitual practice of any voluntary sin, actually cuts himself off from the benefits and profession of Christianity, and whatever he may call himself, is in reality no Christian, nor ought to be esteem∣ed as such.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the times we are now surveying, the Christian religion showed its full force and effi∣cacy on the minds of men, and by many examples demonstrated what great and generous souls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its proselytes to a very high degree of perfection, and set them far above the pleasures, and even the pains, of this life. It strengthened the infir∣mity, and broke the fierceness of human nature. It lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the know∣ledge and worship of him that made them, and in∣spired the vicious with a rational devotion, a strict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it spread through the world, it seemed to change mankind into another species of Beings. No sooner was a convert initiated into it, but by an easy figure he became a New Man, and both acted and look∣ed upon himself as one regenerated and born a second time into another state of existence.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is not my business to be more particular in the accounts of primitive Christianity, which have been exhibited so well by others, but ra∣ther to observe, that the <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, of whom I am now speaking, mention this great refor∣mation of those who had been the greatest sin∣ners,
<PB N="326" REF="286"/>
with that sudden and surprising change which it made in the lives of the most profli∣gate, as having something in it supernatural, mi∣raculous, and more than human. <HI>Origen</HI> repre∣sents this power in the Christian religion, as no less wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind, or cleansing the leper. Many others re∣present it in the same light, and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion, which showed it self in such strange and glorious effects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This therefore was a great means not on∣ly of recommending Christianity to honest and learned heathens, but of confirming them in the belief of our Saviour's history, when they saw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming them∣selves upon his example, animated by his precepts, and actuated by that Spirit which he had promised to send among his Disciples.</P>
<P N="5">V. But I find no argument made a stronger impression on the minds of these eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, for strengthening their faith in the history of our Saviour, than the predictions rela∣ting to him in those old prophetick writings, which were deposited among the hands of the greatest enemies to Christianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned heathen converts were astonished to see the whole history of their Sa∣viour's life published before he was born, and to find that the Evangelists and Prophets, in their ac∣counts of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> differed only in point of time, the one foretelling what should happen to him, and the other describing those very particu∣lars as what had actually happened. This our
<PB N="327" REF="287"/>
Saviour himself was pleased to make use of as the strongest argument of his being the pro∣mised <HI>Messiah,</HI> and without it would hardly have reconciled his Disciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable passage which men∣tions his conversation with the two Disciples, on the day of his resurrection. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. 24. verse 13. to the end.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The heathen converts, after having travel∣led through all human learning, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and scien∣ces, were particularly qualified to examine these prophecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or prepossession. If the <HI>Jews</HI> on the one side put an unnatural interpretation on these prophecies, to evade the force of them in their controversies with the Christians; or if the Christians on the other side over-strained several passages in their applications of them, as it often happens among men of the best understanding, when their minds are heated with any consi∣deration that bears a more than an ordinary weight with it: the learned Heathens may be looked upon as neuters in the matter, when all these prophecies were new to them, and their educa∣tion had left the interpretation of them free and indifferent. Besides, these learned men among the primitive Christians, knew how the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had preceded our Saviour, interpreted these predictions, and the several marks by which they acknowledged the <HI>Messiah</HI> would be disco∣vered, and how those of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Doctors who succeeded him, had deviated from the inter∣pretations and doctrines of their forefathers, on purpose to stifle their own conviction.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="328" REF="288"/>VII. This sett of arguments had therefore an invincible force with those <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers who became Christians, as we find in most of their writings. They could not disbelieve our Saviour's history, which so exactly agreed with every thing that had been written of him many a∣ges before his birth, nor doubt of those circum∣stances being fulfilled in him, which could not be true of any person that lived in the world be∣sides himself. This wrought the greatest confu∣sion in the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> and the greatest conviction in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who every where speak with astonishment of these truths they met with in this new magazine of learning which was opened to them, and carry the point so far as to think whatever excellent doctrine they had met with among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, had been stole from their conversation with the <HI>Jews,</HI> or from the perusal of these writings which they had in their custody.</P>
