<P>â€”THEY order, said I, this matter better in Franceâ€”</P>
<P>â€”You have been in France? said my gentleman, turning quick upon me with the most civil triumph in the world.â€”Strange! quoth I, deâˆ£bating the matter with myself, That one and twenty miles sailing, for 'tis absolutely no further from Dover to Calais, should give a man these

rightsâ€”I'll look into them: so givâˆ£ing up the argumentâ€”I went straight to my lodgings, put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breechesâ€”<Q REND="inline">" the coat I have on, said I, lookâˆ£ing at the sleeve, will do"</Q>â€”took a place in the Dover stage; and the packet sailing at nine the next mornâˆ£ingâ€”by three I had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricassee'd chicken so incontestably in France, that had I died that night of an indigestion, the whole world could not have susâˆ£pended the effects of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the effects of strangers (Swiss and Scotch excepted) dying in France, are seized by virtue of this law, tho' the heir be upon the spotâ€”the profit of these contingencies being farm'd, there is no redress.</NOTE> <HI>Droits</HI>

<HI>d'aubaine</HI>â€”my shirts, and black pair of silk breechesâ€”portmanteau and all must have gone to the King of Franceâ€”even the little picture which I have so long worn, and so often have told thee, Eliza, I would carry with me into my grave, would have been torn from my neck.â€”Ungeneâˆ£rous!â€”to seize upon the wreck of an unwary passenger, whom your subâˆ£jects had beckon'd to their coastâ€”by heaven! SIRE, it is not well done; and much does it grieve me, 'tis the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous, and so renown'd for senâˆ£timent and fine feelings, that I have to reason withâ€”</P>

<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I had finish'd my dinâˆ£ner, and drank the King of France's health, to satisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen, but, on the contrary, high honour for the humaâˆ£nity of his temperâ€”I rose up an inch taller for the accommodation.</P>
<P>â€”Noâ€”said Iâ€”the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be misled like other people; but there is a mildness in their blood. As I acâˆ£knowledged this, I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheekâ€”more warm and friendly to man, than
<PB N="5" REF="24"/>
what Burgundy (at least of two livres a bottle, which was such as I had been drinking) could have produced.</P>
<P>â€”Just God! said I, kicking my portmanteau aside, what is there in this world's goods which should sharpen our spirits, and make so many kind-hearted brethren of us, fall out so cruelly as we do by the way?</P>
<P>When man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metals in his hand! he pulls out his purse, and holding it airily and uncompress'd, looks round him, as if he sought for an object to share it withâ€”In doing this, I felt
<PB N="6" REF="25"/>
every vessel in my frame dilateâ€”the arteries beat all chearily together, and every power which sustained life, perform'd it with so little friction, that 'twould have confounded the most <HI>physical precieuse</HI> in France: with all her materialism, she could scarce have called me a machineâ€”</P>
<P>I'm confident, said I to myself, I should have overset her creed.</P>
<P>The accession of that idea, carried nature, at that time, as high as she could goâ€”I was at peace with the world before, and this finish'd the treaty with myselfâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="26"/>
â€”Now, was I a King of France, cried Iâ€”what a moment for an orâˆ£phan to have begg'd his father's portmanteau of me!</P>

<HEAD>THE MONK.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD scarce utter'd the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg something for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingenciesâ€”or one man may be generous, as another man is puissantâ€”<HI>sed non, quo ad hanc</HI>â€”or be it as it mayâ€”for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the same causes, for ought I know, which influence the tides themselvesâ€”'twould oft be no disâˆ£credit
<PB N="9" REF="28"/>
to us, to suppose it was so: I'm sure at least for myself, that in many a case I should be more highly satisfied, to have it said by the world, <Q REND="inline">"I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither sin nor shame,"</Q> than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was so much of both.</P>
<P>â€”But be this as it may. The moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to give him a single sous; and accordingly I put my purse into my pocketâ€”button'd it upâ€”set myself a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was something, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>
figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deserved better.</P>
<P>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonsure, a few scatter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about seventyâ€”but from his eyes, and that sort of fire which was in them, which seemed more temper'd by courtesy than years, could be no more than sixtyâ€”Truth might lie betweenâ€”He was certainly sixty-five; and the general air of his counteâˆ£nance, notwithstanding something seem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="30"/>
It was one of those heads, which Guido has often paintedâ€”mild, paleâ€”penetrating, free from all comâˆ£mon-place ideas of fat contented igâˆ£norance looking downwards upon the earthâ€”it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at something beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's shoulders, best knows: but it would have suited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indostan, I had reverenced it.</P>
<P>The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to design, for 'twas neither elegant or
<PB N="12" REF="31"/>
otherwise, but as character and exâˆ£pression made it so: it was a thin, spare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the disâˆ£tinction by a bend forwards in the figureâ€”but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and as it now stands preâˆ£sented to my imagination, it gain'd more than it lost by it.</P>
<P>When he had enter'd the room three paces, he stood still; and layâˆ£ing his left hand upon his breast, (a slender white staff with which he journey'd being in his right)â€”when I had got close up to him, he introâˆ£duced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his orderâ€”and did it with
<PB N="13" REF="32"/>
so simple a graceâ€”and such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figureâ€”I was beâˆ£witch'd not to have been struck with itâ€”</P>
<P>â€”A better reason was, I had preâˆ£determined not to give him a single sous.</P>

<P>â€”'TIS very true, said I, replyâˆ£ing to a cast upwards with his eyes, with which he had conâˆ£cluded his addressâ€”'tis very trueâ€”and heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world, the stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many <HI>great claims</HI> which are hourly made upon it.</P>
<P>As I pronounced the words <HI>great claims,</HI> he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve
<PB N="15" REF="34"/>
of his tunickâ€”I felt the full force of the appealâ€”I acknowledge it, said Iâ€”a coarse habit, and that but once in three years, with meagre dietâ€”are no great matters; and the true point of pity is, as they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry, that your order should wish to proâˆ£cure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged and the infirmâ€”the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afâˆ£flictions, languishes also for his share of it; and had you been of the <HI>order of mercy,</HI> instead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portmanteau, full chearfully should it have been open'd
<PB N="16" REF="35"/>
to you, for the ransom of the unforâˆ£tunateâ€”The monk made me a bowâ€”but of all others, resumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, surely, have the first rights; and I have left thousands in distress upon our own shoreâ€”The monk gave a cordial wave with his headâ€”as much as to say, No doubt, there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our conventâ€”But we distinguish, said I, laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick, in return for his appealâ€”we distinâˆ£guish, my good Father! betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labourâ€”and those who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get
<PB N="17" REF="36"/>
through it in sloth and ignorance, <HI>for the love of God.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Franciscan made no reâˆ£ply: a hectic of a moment pass'd across his cheek, but could not tarryâ€”Nature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him; he shewed noneâ€”but letting his staff fall within his arm, he press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and retired.</P>

<P>MY heart smote me the moment he shut the doorâ€”Psha! said I with an air of carelessness, three several timesâ€”but it would not do: every ungracious syllable I had utâˆ£ter'd, crouded back into my imagiâˆ£nation: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deâˆ£ny him; and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed without the addition of unkind lanâˆ£guageâ€”I consider'd his grey hairsâ€”his courteous figure seem'd to reâˆ£enter and gently ask me what injury he had done me?â€”and why I could
<PB N="19" REF="38"/>
use him thusâ€”I would have given twenty livres for an advocateâ€”I have behaved very ill; said I within myself; but I have only just set out upon my travels; and shall learn better manners as I get along.</P>

Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaiseâ€”and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire someâˆ£thing of that kind to my purpose: an old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A chaise, so called in France, from its bolding but one person.</NOTE> Desobligeant in the furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it,
<PB N="21" REF="40"/>
and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monsieur Dessein the master of the hÃ´telâ€”but Monsieur Dessein being gone to vespers, and not caring to face the Franciscan whom I saw on the opposite side of the court, in conference with a lady just arrived, at the innâ€”I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink, and wrote the preface to it in the <HI>Disobligeant.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<PB N="22" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE, IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</HEAD>
<P>IT must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumâˆ£scribe the discontent of man: she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain his sufferings at home. It is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy
<PB N="23" REF="42"/>
for one pair of shoulders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond <HI>her</HI> limits, but 'tis so ordered, that from the want of languages, connections, and deâˆ£pendencies, and from the difference in education, customs and habits, we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere, as often amount to a total impossibility.</P>
<P>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of sentimental comâˆ£merce is always against the expaâˆ£triated adventurer: he must buy what he has little occasion for at their own priceâ€”his conversation
<PB N="24" REF="43"/>
will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discountâ€”and this, by the by, eternally drivâˆ£ing him into the hands of more equitable brokers for such converâˆ£sation as he can find, it requires no great spirit of divination to guess at his partyâ€”</P>
<P>This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the see-saw of this <HI>Desobligeant</HI> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final causes of travellingâ€”</P>
<P>Your idle people that leave their native country and go abroad for some reason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causesâ€” 
<LIST>
<PB N="25" REF="44"/>
<ITEM>Infirmity of body,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Imbecility of mind, or </ITEM>
<ITEM>Inevitable necessity.</ITEM>
</LIST> The first two include all those who travel by land or by water, laâˆ£bouring with pride, curiosity, vanity or spleen, subdivided and combined <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>The third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs; more especially those travellers who set out upon their travels with the beâˆ£nefit of the clergy, either as delinâˆ£quents travelling under the direction of governors recommended by the magistrateâ€”or young gentlemen transported by the cruelty of paâˆ£rents and guardians, and travelling under the direction of governors reâˆ£commended

by Oxford, Aberdeen and Glasgow.</P>
<P>There is a fourth class, but their number is so small that they would not deserve a distinction, was it not necessary in a work of this nature to observe the greatest precision and nicety, to avoid a confusion of chaâˆ£racter. And these men I speak of, are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers with a view of saving money for various reasons and upon various pretences: but as they might also save themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at homeâ€”and as their reasons for travelling are the least complex of any other species of emigrants, I shall diâˆ£stinguish
<PB N="27" REF="48"/>
these gentlemen by the name of<LIST>
<ITEM>Simple Travellers.</ITEM>

<P>Thus the whole circle of travellers may be reduced to the following <HI>Heads.</HI><LIST>

<ITEM>Inquisitive Travellers,</ITEM>

<ITEM>Proud Travellers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vain Travellers,</ITEM>

 <PB N="28" REF="49"/> And last of all (if you please) 

 <LIST>
<ITEM>The Sentimental Traveller</ITEM>
</LIST>
 
 (meaning thereby myself) who have 
 travell'd, and of which I am now sitting down to give an 
 accountâ€”as much out of <HI>Necessity,</HI> 
 and the <HI>besoin de</HI> Voyager, as any one 
 in the class.</P>
<P>I am well aware, at the same time, as both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my fore-runners; that I might have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myselfâ€”but I should break in upon the confines of the <HI>Vain</HI> Traveller, in wishing to draw attention towards me, till I have some better grounds for it, than the mere <HI>Novelty of my Veâˆ£hicle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="50"/>
It is sufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himself, that with study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the cataâˆ£logueâ€”it will be one step towards knowing himself; as it is great odds, but he retains some tincture and resemblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the present hour.</P>
<P>The man who first transplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope (observe he was a Dutch man) never dreamt of drinkâˆ£ing the same wine at the Cape, that the same grape produced upon the French mountainsâ€”he was too phlegmatic for thatâ€”but undoubtâˆ£edly
<PB N="30" REF="51"/>
he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor; but whether good, bad, or indifferentâ€”he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <HI>chance</HI> was to decide his success: however, he hoped for the best; and in these hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his discretion, <HI>Mynheer</HI> might possibly overset both in his new vineyard; and by discovering his nakedness, become a laughingâˆ£stock to his people.</P>
<P>Even so it fares with the poor Traveller, sailing and posting through the politer kingdoms of the globe
<PB N="31" REF="52"/>
in pursuit of knowledge and imâˆ£provements.</P>
<P>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose; but whether useâˆ£ful knowledge and real improveâˆ£ments, is all a lotteryâ€”and even where the adventurer is successful, the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety to turn to any profitâ€”but as the chances run prodigiously the other way both as to the acquisition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wisely, if he could prevail upon himself, to live conâˆ£tented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements, especially
<PB N="32" REF="53"/>
if he lives in a country that has no absolute want of eitherâ€”and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time cost me, when I have observed how many a foul step the inquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into discoâˆ£veries; all which, as Sancho Panca said to Don Quixote, they might have seen dry-shod at home. It is an age so full of light, that there is scarce a country or corner of Euâˆ£rope whose beams are not crossed and interchanged with othersâ€”Knowledge in most of its branches, and in most affairs, is like music in an Italian street, whereof those may partake, who pay nothingâ€”But there is no nation under heaven
<PB N="33" REF="54"/>
â€”and God is my record, (before whose tribunal I must one day come and give an account of this work)â€”that I do not speak it vauntinglyâ€”But there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learnâˆ£ingâ€”where the sciences may be more fitly woo'd, or more surely won than hereâ€”where art is encouraged, and will so soon rise highâ€”where Nature (take her all together) has so little to answer forâ€”and, to close all, where there is more wit and variety of chaâˆ£racter to feed the mind withâ€”Where then, my dear countrymen, are you goingâ€”</P>
<P>â€”We are only looking at this chaise, said theyâ€”Your most obeâˆ£dient
<PB N="34" REF="55"/>
servant, said I, skipping out of it, and pulling off my hatâ€”We were wondering, said one of them, who, I found, was an <HI>inquisitive traveller</HI>â€”what could occasion its motion.â€”â€”'Twas the agitation, said I coolly, of writing a prefaceâ€”I never heard, said the other, who was a <HI>simple traâˆ£veller,</HI> of a preface wrote in a <HI>Desoâˆ£bligeant.</HI>â€”It would have been better, said I, in a <HI>Vis a Vis.</HI></P>
<P>â€”<HI>As an English man does not travel to see English men,</HI> I retired to my room.</P>

<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>I Perceived that something darken'd the passage more than myself, as I stepp'd along it to my room; it was effectually Mons. Dessein, the master of the hÃ´tel, who had just reâˆ£turn'd from vespers, and, with his hat under his arm, was most comâˆ£plaisantly following me, to put me in mind of my wants. I had wrote myâˆ£self pretty well out of conceit with the <HI>Desobligeant;</HI> and Mons. Dessein speaking of it, with a shrug, as if it would no way suit me, it immediately struck my fancy that it belong'd to some <HI>innocent traveller,</HI> who, on his
<PB N="36" REF="57"/>
return home, had left it to Mons. Dessein's honour to make the most of. Four months had elapsed since it had finish'd its career of Europe in the corner of Mons. Dessein's coachâˆ£yard; and having sallied out from thence but a vampt-up business at the first, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not profited much by its advenâˆ£turesâ€”but by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of Mons. Dessein's coachâˆ£yard. Much indeed was not to be said for itâ€”but something mightâ€”and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="58"/>
â€”Now was I the master of this hÃ´tel, said I, laying the point of my fore-finger on Mons. Dessein's breast, I would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate <HI>Desoâˆ£bligeant</HI>â€”itstands swinging reproaches at you every time you pass by itâ€”</P>
<P><HI>Mon Dieu!</HI> said Mons. Desseinâ€”I have no interestâ€”Except the inâˆ£terest, said I, which men of a certain turn of mind take, Mons. Dessein, in their own sensationsâ€”I'm persuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as for himself, every rainy night, disâˆ£guise it as you will, must cast a damp upon your spiritsâ€”You suffer, Mons. Dessein, as much as the machineâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="59"/>
I have always observed, when there is as much <HI>sour</HI> as <HI>sweet</HI> in a compliâˆ£ment, that an Englishman is eternally at a loss within himself, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Mons. Dessein made me a bow.</P>
<P><HI>C'est bien vrai,</HI> said heâ€”But in this case I should only exchange one disâˆ£quietude for another, and with loss: figure to yourself, my dear Sir, that in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to Parisâ€”figure to yourself how much I should suffer, in giving an ill impression of myself to a man of hoâˆ£nour, and lying at the mercy, as I must do, <HI>d'un homme d'esprit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="60"/>
The dose was made up exactly after my own prescription; so I could not help taking itâ€”and returning Mons. Dessein his bow, without more casuistry we walk'd together towards his Remise, to take a view of his magazine of chaises.</P>

<HEAD>IN THE STREET.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>IT must needs be a hostile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a sorry post-chaise) canâˆ£not go forth with the seller thereâˆ£of into the street to terminate the difference betwixt them, but he inâˆ£stantly falls into the same frame of mind and views his conventionist with the same sort of eye, as if he was going along with him to Hydeâˆ£park corner to fight a duel. For my own part, being but a poor sword'sâˆ£man, and no way a match for Monâˆ£sieur <HI>Dessein,</HI> I felt the rotation of
<PB N="41" REF="62"/>
all the movements within me, to which the situation is incidentâ€”I looked at Monsieur <HI>Dessein</HI> through and throughâ€”ey'd him as he walked along in profileâ€”then, <HI>en face</HI>â€”thought he look'd like a Jewâ€”then a Turkâ€”disliked his wigâ€”cursed him by my godsâ€”wished him at the devilâ€”</P>
<P>â€”And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly acâˆ£count of three or four louisd'ors, which is the most I can be overâˆ£reach'd in?â€”Base passion! said I, turning myself about, as a man naâˆ£turally does upon a sudden reverse of sentimentâ€”base, ungentle passion! thy hand is against every man, and
<PB N="42" REF="63"/>
every man's hand against theeâ€”heaven forbid! said she, raising her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had seen in conference with the monkâ€”she had followed us unperceivedâ€”Heaven forbid indeed! said I, offering her my ownâ€”she had a black pair of silk gloves open only at the thumb and two foreâˆ£fingers, so accepted it without reâˆ£serveâ€”and I led her up to the door of the Remise.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Dessein</HI> had <HI>diabled</HI> the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himself to have it open'd; and so
<PB N="43" REF="64"/>
attentive to the obstacle, that I conâˆ£tinued holding her hand almost withâˆ£out knowing it; so that Monsieur <HI>Dessein</HI> left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remise, and said he would be back in five minutes.</P>
<P>Now a colloquy of five miâˆ£nutes, in such a situation, is worth one of as many ages, with your faces turned towards the street: in the latter case, 'tis drawn from the objects and occurrences withâˆ£outâ€”when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blankâ€”you draw purely from yourselves. A silence of a single moment upon Monsieur <HI>Dessein</HI>'s
<PB N="44" REF="65"/>
leaving us, had been fatal: to the situationâ€”she had infallibly turned aboutâ€”so I begun the conversation instantly.â€”</P>
<P>â€”But what were the temptations, (as I write not to apologize for the weaknesses of my heart in this tour,â€”but to give an account of them)â€”shall be described with the same simplicity, with which I felt them.</P>

<HEAD>THE REMISE DOOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the <HI>Desobligeant,</HI> because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the innâ€”I told him the truth; but I did not tell him the whole truth; for I was full as much restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to. Suspicion crossed my brain, and said, he was telling her what had passed: something jarred upon it within meâ€”I wished him at his convent.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="67"/>
When the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judgâˆ£ment a world of painsâ€”I was cerâˆ£tain she was of a better order of beingsâ€”however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my preface.</P>
<P>The impression returned, upon my encounter with her in the street; a guarded frankness with which she gave me her hand, shewed, I thought, her good education and her good sense; and as I led her on, I felt a pleasurable ductility about her, which spread a calmness over all my spiritsâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="68"/>
â€”Good God! how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world with him!â€”</P>
<P>I had not yet seen her faceâ€”'twas not material; for the drawing was instantly set about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remise, <HI>Fancy</HI> had finished the whole head, and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess, as if she had dived into the TIBER for itâ€”but thou art a seduced, and a seâˆ£ducing slut; and albeit thou cheatest us seven times a day with thy picâˆ£tures and images, yet with so many charms dost thou do it, and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes of so many angels of light, 'tis a shame to break with thee.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="69"/>
When we had got to the door of the Remise, she withdrew her hand from across her forehead, and let me see the originalâ€”it was a face of about six and twentyâ€”of a clear transparent brown, simply set off without rouge or powderâ€”it was not critically handsome, but there was that in it, which in the frame of mind I was in, which attached me much more to itâ€”it was interesting; I fancied it wore the characters of a widow'd look, and in that state of its declension, which had passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its lossâ€”but a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines; I wish'd to know
<PB N="49" REF="70"/>
what they had beenâ€”and was ready to enquire, (had the same <HI>bon ton</HI> of conversation permitted, as in the days of Esdras)â€”<Q REND="inline">"<HI>What aileth thee? and why art thou disquieted? and why is thy understanding troubled?</HI>"</Q>â€”In a word, I felt benevolence for her; and resolved some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesyâ€”if not of service.</P>
<P>Such were my temptationsâ€”and in this disposition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned closer to the door of the Remise than what was abâˆ£solutely necessary.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<PB N="50" REF="71"/>
<HEAD>THE REMISE DOOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS certainly, fair lady! said I, raising her hand up a little lightly as I began, must be one of Fortune's whimsical doings: to take two utter strangers by their handsâ€”of different sexes, and perâˆ£haps from different corners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in such a cordial situâˆ£ation, as Friendship herself could scarce have atchieved for them, had she projected it for a monthâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="72"/>
â€”And your reflection upon it, shews how much, Monsieur, she has embarassed you by the adventure.â€”</P>
<P>When the situation is, what we would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as to hint at the circumstances which make it so: you thank Fortune, conâˆ£tinued sheâ€”you had reasonâ€”the heart knew it, and was satisfied; and who but an English philosopher would have sent notices of it to the brain to reverse the judgment?</P>
<P>In saying this, she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="73"/>
It is a miserable picture which I am going to give of the weakness of my heart, by owning, that it suffered a pain, which worthier occasions could not have inflicted.â€”I was mortified with the loss of her hand, and the manner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life.</P>
<P>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfiâˆ£tures. In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to finish her reply; so some way or other, God knows how, I regained my situation.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="74"/>
â€”She had nothing to add.</P>
<P>I forthwith began to model a difâˆ£ferent conversation for the lady, thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this, that I had been miâˆ£staken in her character; but upon turning her face towards me, the spirit which had animated the reply was fledâ€”the muscles relaxed, and I beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interestâ€”melancholy! to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow.â€”I pitied her from my soul; and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,â€”I could have taken her into my arms, and cherished her,
<PB N="54" REF="75"/>
though it was in the open street, without blushing.</P>
<P>The pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers, told her what was passing within me: she looked downâ€”a silence of some moâˆ£ments followed.</P>
<P>I fear, in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts toâˆ£wards a closer compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my ownâ€”not as if she was going to withdraw hersâ€”but, as if she thought about itâ€”and I had infallibly lost it a second time, had not instinct more than reaâˆ£son directed me to the last resource
<PB N="55" REF="76"/>
in these dangersâ€”to hold it loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment going to release it, of myâˆ£self; so she let it continue, till Monâˆ£sieur <HI>Dessein</HI> returned with the key; and in the mean time I set myself to consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk's story, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast against me.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<PB N="56" REF="77"/>
<HEAD>THE SNUFF-BOX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE good old monk was within six paces of us, as the idea of him cross'd my mind; and was adâˆ£vancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no.â€”He stopp'd, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a world of frankness; and having a horn snuff-box in his hand, he presented it open to meâ€”You shall taste mineâ€”said I, pulling out my box (which was a small tortoise one) and putting it into his handâ€”
<PB N="57" REF="78"/>
'Tis most excellent, said the monk; Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, sometimes recollect it was the peace-offering of a man who once used you unkindly, but not from his heart.</P>
<P>The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet. <HI>Mon Dieu!</HI> said he, pressâˆ£ing his hands togetherâ€”you never used me unkindly.â€”I should think, said the lady, he is not likely. I blush'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyseâ€”Excuse me, Madame, replied Iâ€”I treated him most unâˆ£kindly; and from no provocationsâ€”'Tis impossible, said the lady.â€”My
<PB N="58" REF="79"/>
God! cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to himâ€”the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zealâ€”the lady opposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his, could give offence to any.</P>
<P>I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it.â€”We remained silent, without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place, when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word. Whilst this lasted, the monk rubb'd his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunick;
<PB N="59" REF="80"/>
and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the frictionâ€”he made a low bow, and said, 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakâˆ£ness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contestâ€”but be it as it wouldâ€”he begg'd we might exchange boxesâ€”In sayâˆ£ing this, he presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other; and having kiss'd itâ€”with a stream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his bosomâ€”and took his leave.</P>
<P>I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to something betâˆ£ter: in truth, I seldom go abroad
<PB N="60" REF="81"/>
without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the justlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon some military services ill reâˆ£quited, and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenâˆ£derest of passions, he abandon'd the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his conâˆ£vent as in himself.</P>
<P>I feel a damp upon my spirits, as I am going to add, that in my last return through Calais, upon inquirâˆ£ing after Father Lorenzo, I heard
<PB N="61" REF="82"/>
he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his desire, in a little cimetiery belonging to it, about two leagues off: I had a strong desire to see where they had laid himâ€”when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no business to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections, that I burst into a flood of tearsâ€”but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to smile, but pity me.</P>

<HEAD>THE REMISE DOOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD never quitted the lady's hand all this time; and had held it so long, that it would have been indecent to have let it go, without first pressing it to my lips: the blood and spirits, which had suffer'd a reâˆ£vulsion from her, crouded back to her, as I did it.</P>
<P>Now the two travellers who had spoke to me in the coach-yard, hapâˆ£pening at that crisis to be passing by, and observing our communications, naturally took it into their heads that
<PB N="63" REF="84"/>
we must be <HI>man and wife</HI> at least; so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise, the one of them, who was the inquisitive traâˆ£veller, ask'd us, if we set out for Paris the next morning?â€”I could only answer for myself, I said; and the lady added, she was for Amiens.â€”We dined there yesterday, said the simple travellerâ€”You go directly through the town, added the other, in your road to Paris. I was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence, <HI>that Amiens was in the road to Paris;</HI> but, upon pulling out my poor monk's little horn box to take a pinch of snuffâ€”I made them a quiet bow, and wishing them a
<PB N="64" REF="85"/>
good passage to Doverâ€”they left us aloneâ€”</P>
<P>â€”Now where would be the harm, said I to myself, if I was to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise?â€”and what mighty mischief could ensue?</P>
<P>Every dirty passion, and bad proâˆ£pensity in my nature, took the alarm, as I stated the propositionâ€”It will oblige you to have a third horse, said AVARICE, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket.â€”You know not who she is, said CAUTIONâ€”or what scrapes the affair may draw you into, whisper'd COWARDICEâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="86"/>
Depend upon it, Yorick! said DISCRETION, 'twill be said you went off with a mistress, and came by asâˆ£signation to Calais for that purposeâ€”</P>
<P>â€”You can never after, cried HYâˆ£POCRISY aloud, shew your face in the worldâ€”or rise, quoth MEANNESS, in the churchâ€”or be any thing in it, said PRIDE, but a lousy prebendary.</P>

<P>HAVING, on first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that she was of the better order of beings"</Q>â€”and then laid it down as a second axiom, as indisputâˆ£able as the first, That she was a wiâˆ£dow, and wore a character of disâˆ£tressâ€”I went no further; I got ground enough for the situation which pleased meâ€”and had she remained close beâˆ£side my elbow till midnight, I should have held true to my system, and considered her only under that geneâˆ£ral idea.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="90"/>
She had scarce got twenty paces distant from me, ere something within me called out for a more particular inquiryâ€”it brought on the idea of a further separationâ€”I might possibly never see her moreâ€”the heart is for saving what it can; and I wanted the traces thro' which my wishes might find their way to her, in case I should never rejoin her myself: in a word, I wish'd to know her nameâ€”her faâˆ£mily'sâ€”her condition; and as I knew the place to which she was going, I wanted to know from whence she came: but there was no coming at all this intelligence: a hundred little delicacies stood in the way. I form'd a score different plansâ€”There was
<PB N="70" REF="91"/>
no such thing as a man's asking her directlyâ€”the thing was impossible.</P>
<P>A little French <HI>debonaire</HI> captain, who came dancing down the street, shewed me, it was the easiest thing in the world; for popping in betwixt us, just as the lady was returning back to the door of the Remise, he introâˆ£duced himself to my acquaintance, and before he had well got announâˆ£ced, begg'd I would do him the hoâˆ£nour to present him to the ladyâ€”I had not been presented myselfâ€”so turning about to her, he did it just as well by asking her, if she had come from Paris?â€”No: she was going that rout, she said.â€”<HI>Vous n'etez pas de Londre?</HI>â€”She was not, she replied.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="92"/>
â€”Then Madame must have come thro' Flanders.â€”<HI>Apparamment vous etez Flammande?</HI> said the French capâˆ£tain.â€”The lady answered, she was.â€”<HI>Peutetre, de Lisle?</HI> added heâ€”She said, she was not of Lisle.â€”Nor Arâˆ£ras?â€”nor Cambray?â€”nor Ghent?â€”nor Brussels?

itâ€”he begg'd the honour to know her nameâ€”so made his bow.</P>
<P>â€”<HI>Et Madame a son Mari?</HI>â€”said he, looking back when he had made two stepsâ€”and without staying for an answerâ€”danced down the street.</P>

<P>AS the little French captain left us, Mons. Dessein came up with the key of the Remise in his hand, and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises.</P>
<P>The first object which caught my eye, as Mons. Dessein open'd the door of the Remise, was another old tatter'd <HI>Desobligeant:</HI> and notwithâˆ£standing it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coach-yard but an hour beforeâ€”the very sight of it stirr'd up a

<P>I observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself: so Mons.

<P>It is supposed so at leastâ€”and how it has come to pass, continued I, I know not; but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love, and making it better than any other nation upon earth: but for my own part I think them errant bunglers, and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried Cupid's patience.</P>

<P>I HAD once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice got out in the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the postilion to tie it on, without beâˆ£ing able to find out what was wantâˆ£ingâ€”Nor was it till I got to Monâˆ£triul, upon the landlord's asking me if I wanted not a servant, that it ocâˆ£curred to me, that that was the very thing.</P>
<P>A servant! That I do most sadly, quoth Iâ€”Because, Monsieur, said the landlord, there is a clever young felâˆ£low,

<P>Now Janatone being the landâˆ£lord's daughter, and the landlord supposing I was young in French, took the liberty to inform me, I should

not have said <HI>tant pis</HI>â€”but, <HI>tant mieux. Tant mieux, toujours, Monsieur,</HI> said he, when there is any thing to be gotâ€”<HI>tant pis,</HI> when there is nothing. It comes to the same thing, said I. <HI>Pardonnez moi,</HI> said the landlord.</P>
<P>I cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all, that <HI>tant pis</HI> and <HI>tant mieux</HI> being two of the great hinges in French conversation, a stranâˆ£ger would do well to set himself right in the use of them, before he gets to Paris.</P>
<P>A prompt French Marquis at our ambassador's table demanded of Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, if he was H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> the poet?

<P>When the landlord had set me right in this matter, he called in La Fleur, which was the name of the young man he had spoke ofâ€”saying only first, That as for his talents, he would presume to say nothingâ€”Monâˆ£sieur was the best judge what would suit him; but for the fidelity of La Fleur, he would stand responsible in all he was worth.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="117"/>

<PB N="102" REF="127"/>
of this poor fellow, for shaming me into one of a better kind. With all this, La Fleur had a small cast of the coxcombâ€”but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and before I had been three days in Paris with himâ€”he seemed to be no coxcomb at all.</P>

<P><HI>C'est un garÃ§on de bonne fortune,</HI> said the landlord, pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur, and were most kindly taking their leave of him, as the postilion was leading out the horses. La Fleur kissed all their hands round and

<P>A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim, by
<PB N="112" REF="137"/>
retiring two steps out of the circle, and making a disqualifying bow on his part. Had the whole parterre cried out, <HI>Place aux dames,</HI> with one voice, it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect.</P>
<P>Just heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou order'd it, that beggary and urbanity, which are at such variance in other countries, should find a way to be at unity in this?</P>
<P>â€”I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous, merely for his <HI>poâˆ£litesse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="138"/>
A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow, who stood over-against me in the circle, putting something first under his arm, which had once been a hat, took his snuff-box out of his pocket, and generously offer'd a pinch on both sides of him: it was a gift of consequence, and modestly declinedâ€”The poor little fellow press'd it upon them with a nod of welcomenessâ€”<HI>Prenez en</HI>â€”<HI>prenez,</HI> said he, lookâˆ£ing another way; so they each took a pinchâ€”Pity thy box should ever want one! said I to myself; so I put a couple of sous into itâ€”taking a small pinch out of his box, to enâˆ£hance their value, as I did itâ€”He felt the weight of the second obligaâˆ£tion more than that of the firstâ€”'twas
<PB N="114" REF="139"/>
doing him an honourâ€”the other was only doing him a charityâ€”and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.</P>
<P>â€”Here! said I to an old soldier with one hand, who had been camâˆ£paign'd and worn out to death in the serviceâ€”here's a couple of sous for theeâ€”<HI>Vive le Roi!</HI> said the old solâˆ£dier.</P>
<P>I had then but three sous left: so I gave one, simply <HI>pour l'amour de Dieu,</HI> which was the footing on which it was begg'dâ€”The poor woman had a dislocated hip; so it could not be well, upon any other motive.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="140"/>
<HI>Mon cher et tres charitable Monâˆ£sieur</HI>â€”There's no opposing this, said I.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Anglois</HI>â€”the very sound was worth the moneyâ€”so I gave <HI>my last sous for it.</HI> But in the eagerness of giving, I had overlook'd a <HI>pauvre honteux,</HI> who had no one to ask a sous for him, and who, I believed, would have perish'd, ere he could have ask'd one for himself: he stood by the chaise a little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen better daysâ€”Good God! said Iâ€”and I have not one single sous left to give himâ€”But you have a thousand! cried all the powers of nature, stirring within meâ€”so I gave himâ€”no matter whatâ€”I am
<PB N="116" REF="141"/>
ashamed to say <HI>how much,</HI> nowâ€”and was ashamed to think, how little, then: so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition, as these two fixed points are given him, he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum.</P>
<P>I could afford nothing for the rest, but, <HI>Dieu vous benisse</HI>â€”<HI>Et le bon Dieu vous benisse encore</HI>â€”said the old solâˆ£dier, the dwarf, &amp;c. The <HI>pauvre honteux</HI> could say nothingâ€”he pull'd out a little handkerchief, and wiped his face as he turned awayâ€”and I thought he thank'd me more than them all.</P>

<HEAD>THE BIDET.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING settled all these little matters, I got into my postâˆ£chaise with more ease than ever I got into a post-chaise in my life; and La Fleur having got one large jackâˆ£boot on the far side of a little <HI>bidet</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Post horse.</NOTE>, and another on this (for I count noâˆ£thing of his legs)â€”he canter'd away before me as happy and as perpenâˆ£dicular as a prince.â€”</P>
<P>â€”But what is happiness! what is grandeur in this painted scene of life! A dead ass, before we had got a league, put a sudden stop to La Fleur's careerâ€”his bidet would not
<PB N="118" REF="143"/>
pass by itâ€”a contention arose betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very first kick.</P>
<P>La Fleur bore his fall like a French christian, saying neither more or less upon it, than, Diable! so presently got up and came to the charge again astride his bidet, beatâˆ£ing him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</P>
<P>The bidet flew from one side of the road to the other, then back againâ€”then this wayâ€”then that way, and in short every way but by the dead ass.â€”La Fleur insisted upon the thingâ€”and the bidet threw him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="144"/>
What's the matter, La Fleur, said I, with this bidet of thine?â€”<HI>Monâˆ£sieur,</HI> said he, <HI>c'est un cheval le plus opiniatrÃ© du monde</HI>â€”Nay, if he is a conceited beast, he must go his own way, replied Iâ€”so La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good sound lash, the bidet took me at my word, and away he scamper'd back to Montriul.â€”<HI>Peste!</HI> said La Fleur.</P>
<P>It is not <HI>mal a propos</HI> to take noâˆ£tice here, that tho' La Fleur availed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounterâ€”namely, <HI>Diable!</HI> and <HI>Peste!</HI> that there are nevertheless three, in the French language; like the positive, comparative, and superlative, one or
<PB N="120" REF="145"/>
the other of which serve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life.</P>
<P><HI>Le Diable!</HI> which is the first, and positive degree, is generally used upon ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out contrary to your expectationsâ€”such asâ€”the throwing once doubletsâ€”La Fleur's being kick'd off his horse, and so forthâ€”cuckoldom, for the same reason, is alwaysâ€”<HI>Le Diable!</HI></P>
<P>But in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that of the bidet's running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-bootsâ€”'tis the second degree.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="146"/>
'Tis then <HI>Peste!</HI></P>
<P>And for the thirdâ€”</P>
<P>â€”But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow-feeling, when I reflect what miseries must have been their lot, and how bitterly so refined a people must have smarted, to have forced them upon the use of it.â€”</P>
<P>Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distress!â€”whatever is my <HI>cast,</HI> Grant me but decent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature way.</P>
<P>â€”But as these were not to be had in France, I resolved to take every

evil just as it befell me without any exclamation at all.</P>
<P>La Fleur, who had made no such covenant with himself, followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of sightâ€”and then, you may imagine, if you please, with what word he closed the whole affair.</P>
<P>As there was no hunting down a frighten'd horse in jack-boots, there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise, or into it.â€”</P>
<P>I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at Nampont.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>THE DEAD ASS.</HEAD>
<P>â€”AND this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his walletâ€”and this, should have been thy portion, said he, hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me. I thought by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to his child; but 'twas to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned La Fleur's misadventure. The man seemed to lament it much; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho's laâˆ£mentation
<PB N="124" REF="151"/>
for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.</P>
<P>The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to timeâ€”then laid them downâ€”look'd at them and shook his head. He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time in his handâ€”then laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridleâ€”looked wistfully at the little arrangeâˆ£ment he had madeâ€”and then gave a sigh.</P>
<P>The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur
<PB N="125" REF="152"/>
amongst the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads.</P>
<P>â€”He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest borders of Franconia; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died. Every one seem'd desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.</P>
<P>It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in all Germany; but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the small-pox, and the
<PB N="126" REF="153"/>
youngest falling ill of the same diâˆ£stemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would not take him from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.</P>
<P>When the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp'd to pay nature her tributeâ€”and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>He said, Heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creaâˆ£ture, who had been a patient partner of his journeyâ€”that it had eat the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="154"/>
Every body who stood about, heard the poor fellow with concernâ€”â€”La Fleur offered him money.â€”The mourner said, he did not want itâ€”it was not the value of the assâ€”but the loss of him.â€”The ass, he said, he was assured loved himâ€”and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met.</P>
<P>Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least in the loss of thy poor beast; I'm sure thou hast been a merâˆ£ciful
<PB N="128" REF="155"/>
master to him.â€”Alas! said the mourner, I thought so, when he was aliveâ€”but now that he is dead I think otherwise.â€”I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for himâ€”they have shortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to answer for.â€”Shame on the world! said I to myselfâ€”Did we love each other, as this poor soul but loved his assâ€”'twould be something.â€”</P>

<HEAD>THE POSTILLION.</HEAD>
<P>THE concern which the poor fellow's story threw me into, required some attention: the poâˆ£stillion paid not the least to it, but set off upon the <HI>pavÃ¨</HI> in a full gallop.</P>
<P>The thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of Arabia could not have wished more for a cup of cold water, than mine did for grave and quiet movements; and I should have had an high opinion of the postillion had he but stolen off with me in someâˆ£thing like a pensive pace.â€”On the
<PB N="130" REF="157"/>
contrary, as the mourner finished his lamentation, the fellow gave an unâˆ£feeling lash to each of his beasts, and set off clattering like a thousand devils.</P>
<P>I called to him as loud as I could, for heaven's sake to go slowerâ€”and the louder I called the more unmerâˆ£cifully he galloped.â€”The deuce take him and his galloping tooâ€”said Iâ€”he'll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a foolish passion, and then he'll go slow, that I may enjoy the sweets of it.</P>
<P>The postillion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got
<PB N="131" REF="158"/>
to the foot of a steep hill about half a league from Nampont,â€”he had put me out of temper with himâ€”and then with myself, for being so.</P>
<P>My case then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop would have been of real service to me.â€”</P>
<P>â€”Then, prithee get onâ€”get on, my good lad, said I.</P>
<P>The postillion pointed to the hillâ€”I then tried to return back to the story of the poor German and his assâ€”but I had broke the clueâ€”and could no more get into it again, than the postillion could into a trot.â€”</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="159"/>
â€”The deuce go, said I, with it all! Here am I sitting as candidly disposed to make the best of the worst, as ever wight was, and all runs counter.</P>
<P>There is one sweet lenitive at least for evils, which nature holds out to us; so I took it kindly at her hands, and fell asleep; and the first word which roused me was <HI>Amiens.</HI></P>

<P>THE words were scarce out of my mouth, when the Count de L***'s post-chaise, with his sister in it, drove hastily by: she had just time to make me a bow of reâˆ£cognitionâ€”and of that particular kind of it, which told me she had not yet done with me. She was as good as her look; for, before I had quite finished my supper, her broâˆ£ther's servant came into the room with a billet, in which she said, she had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter, which I was to present myself to Madame R*** the first
<PB N="134" REF="161"/>
morning I had nothing to do at Paris. There was only added, she was sorry, but from what <HI>penchant</HI> she had not considered, that she had been preâˆ£vented telling me her storyâ€”that she still owed it me; and if my rout should ever lay through Brussels, and I had not by then forgot the name of Maâˆ£dame de L***â€”that Madame de L*** would be glad to discharge her obligation.</P>
<P>Then I will meet thee, said I, fair spirit! at Brusselsâ€”'tis only returnâˆ£ing from Italy through Germany to Holland, by the rout of Flanders, homeâ€”'twill scarce be ten posts out of my way; but were it ten thouâˆ£sand! with what a moral delight will

it crown my journey, in sharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer? to see her weep! and though I canâˆ£not dry up the fountain of her tears, what an exquisite sensation is there still left, in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women, as I'm sitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night besides her.</P>
<P>There was nothing wrong in the sentiment; and yet I instantly reâˆ£proached my heart with it in the bitâˆ£terest and most reprobate of expresâˆ£sions.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="163"/>
It had ever, as I told the reader, been one of the singular blessings of my life, to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one; and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the sudden turn of a corner, I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of Eliza but about three months beâˆ£foreâ€”swearing as I did it, that it should last me through the whole journeyâ€”Why should I dissemble the matter? I had sworn to her eternal fidelityâ€”she had a right to my whole heartâ€”to divide my affections was to lessen themâ€”to expose them, was to risk them: where there is risk, there may be lossâ€”and what wilt
<PB N="137" REF="164"/>
thou have, Yorick! to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidenceâ€”so good, so gentle and unreproachâˆ£ing?</P>
<P>â€”I will not go to Brussels, replied I, interrupting myselfâ€”but my imagiâˆ£nation went onâ€”I recall'd her looks at that crisis of our separation when neither of us had power to say Adieu! I look'd at the picture she had tied in a black ribband about my neckâ€”and blush'd as I look'd at itâ€”I would have given the world to have kiss'd it,â€”but was ashamedâ€”And shall this tender flower, said I, pressing it beâˆ£tween my handsâ€”shall it be smitten to its very rootâ€”and smitten, Yorick!
<PB N="138" REF="165"/>
by thee, who hast promised to shelter it in thy breast?</P>
<P>Eternal fountain of happiness! said I, kneeling down upon the groundâ€”be thou my witnessâ€”and every pure spirit which tastes it, be my witness also, That I would not travel to Brussels, unless Eliza went along with me, did the road lead me toâˆ£wards heaven.</P>

<P>FORTUNE had not smiled upon La Fleur; for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of chivalryâ€”and not one thing had offer'd to signalize his zeal for my service from the time he had enter'd into it, which was almost four and twenty hours. The poor soul burn'd with impaâˆ£tience; and the Count de L***'s servant's coming with the letter, beâˆ£ing the first practicable occasion which offered, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and in order to do honour to his
<PB N="140" REF="167"/>
master, had taken him into a back parlour in the Auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in Picardy; and the Count de L***'s servant in return, and not to be behind hand in politeness with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count's hÃ´tel. La Fleur's <HI>prevenancy</HI> (for there was a passport in his very looks) soon set every serâˆ£vant in the kitchen at ease with him; and as a Frenchman, whatever be his talents, has no sort of prudery in shewing them, La Fleur, in less than five minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance himself with the first note, set the <HI>fille de chambre,</HI> the <HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> the cook,
<PB N="141" REF="168"/>
the scullion, and all the houshold, dogs and cats, besides an old monkey, a dancing: I suppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood.</P>
<P>Madame de L***, in passing from her brother's apartments to her own, hearing so much jollity below stairs, rung up her <HI>fille de chambre</HI> to ask about it; and hearing it was the English gentleman's servant who had set the whole house merry with his pipe, she order'd him up.</P>
<P>As the poor fellow could not preâˆ£sent himself empty, he had loaden'd himself in going up stairs with a thouâˆ£sand compliments to Madame de L***, on the part of his masterâ€”

added a long apocrypha of inquiries after Madame de L***'s healthâ€”told her, that Monsieur his master was <HI>au desespoire</HI> for her re-establishâˆ£ment from the fatigues of her jourâˆ£neyâ€”and, to close all, that Monâˆ£sieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honourâ€”And he has done me the hoâˆ£nour, said Madame de L***, interâˆ£rupting La Fleur, to send a billet in return.</P>
<P>Madame de L*** had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact, that La Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectationsâ€”he trembled for my honourâ€”and posâˆ£sibly might not altogether be unconâˆ£cerned
<PB N="143" REF="172"/>
for his own, as a man capable of being attach'd to a master who could be a wanting <HI>en egards vis a vis d'une femme;</HI> so that when Maâˆ£dame de L*** asked La Fleur if he had brought a letterâ€”<HI>O qu'oui,</HI> said La Fleur: so laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his left hand, he began to search for the letter with his rightâ€”then contrary-wiseâ€”<HI>Diable!</HI>â€”then sought every pocketâ€”pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fobâ€”<HI>Peste!</HI>â€”then La Fleur emptied them upon the floorâ€”pulled out a dirty cravatâ€”a handkerchiefâ€”a combâ€”a whip lashâ€”a night-capâ€”then gave a peep
<PB N="144" REF="173"/>
into his hatâ€”<HI>Quelle etourderie!</HI> He had left the letter upon the table in the Aubergeâ€”he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</P>
<P>I had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an acâˆ£count of his adventure: he told the whole story simply as it was; and only added, that if Monsieur had forgot <HI>(par hazard)</HI> to answer Maâˆ£dame's letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the <HI>faux pas</HI>â€”and if not, that things were only as they were.</P>
<P>Now I was not altogether sure of my <HI>etiquette,</HI> whether I ought to have wrote or no; but if I hadâ€”a devil
<PB N="145" REF="174"/>
himself could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a wellâˆ£meaning creature for my honour; and however he might have mistook the roadâ€”or embarrassed me in so doingâ€”his heart was in no faultâ€”I was under no necessity to writeâ€”and what weighed more than allâ€”he did not look as if he had done amiss.</P>
<P>â€”'Tis all very well, La Fleur, said I.â€”'Twas sufficient. La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening, and return'd with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them close before me, with such a delight in his counâˆ£tenance, that I could not help taking up the pen.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="175"/>
I begun and begun again; and though I had nothing to say, and that nothing might have been express'd in half a dozen lines, I made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way please myself.</P>
<P>In short, I was in no mood to write.</P>
<P>La Fleur stepp'd out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my inkâ€”then fetch'd sand and seal-waxâ€”It was all one: I wrote, and blotâˆ£ted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote againâ€”<HI>Le Diable l'emporte!</HI> said I half to myselfâ€”I cannot write this self-same letter; throwing the pen down despairingly as I said it.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="176"/>
As soon as I had cast down the pen, La Fleur advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table, and making a thousand apoloâˆ£gies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he durst say, would suit the occasion.</P>
<P>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humourâ€”Then prithee, said I, let me see it.</P>
<P>La Fleur instantly pull'd out a little dirty pocket-book cramm'd full of small letters and billet-doux in a sad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the string
<PB N="148" REF="177"/>
which held them all together, run them over one by one, till he came to the letter in questionâ€”<HI>La voila!</HI> said he, clapping his hands: so unâˆ£folding it first, he laid it before me, and retired three steps from the table whilst I read it.</P>

<P>A poor prince who is weak in cavalry, and whose whole infantry does not exceed a single man, had best quit the field; and signalize himself in the cabinet, if he can get up into itâ€”I say <HI>up into it</HI>â€”for there is no descending perpendicular amongst 'em with a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Me voici!</HI>

<HEAD>THE WIG.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the barber came, he absolutely refused to have any thing to do with my wig: 'twas either above or below his art: I had nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recomâˆ£mendation.</P>
<P>â€”But I fear, friend! said I, this buckle won't stand.â€”You may imâˆ£merge it, replied he, into the ocean, and it will standâ€”</P>
<P>What a great scale is every thing upon in this city! thought Iâ€”The
<PB N="157" REF="188"/>
utmost stretch of an English periwigâˆ£maker's ideas could have gone no further than to have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"dipped it into a pail of water"</Q>â€”What difference! 'tis like time to eternity.</P>
<P>I confess I do hate all cold conâˆ£ceptions, as I do the puny ideas which engender them; and am geâˆ£nerally so struck with the great works of nature, that for my own part, if I could help it, I never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least. All that can be said against the French sublime in this instance of it, is thisâ€”that the grandeur is <HI>more</HI> in the <HI>word;</HI> and <HI>less</HI> in the <HI>thing.</HI> No doubt the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas;

but Paris being so far inland, it was not likely I should run post a hundred miles out of it, to try the experimentâ€”the Parisian barber meant nothing.â€”</P>
<P>The pail of water standing besides the great deep, makes certainly but a sorry figure in speechâ€”but 'twill be saidâ€”it has one advantageâ€”'tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a single moment.</P>
<P>In honest truth, and upon a more candid revision of the matter, <HI>The French expression professes more than it performs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="192"/>
I think I can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national chaâˆ£racters more in these nonsensical <HI>miâˆ£nutiae,</HI> than in the most important matters of state; where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much alike, that I would not give nineâˆ£pence to chuse amongst them.</P>
<P>I was so long in getting from under my barber's hands, that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to Madame R*** that night: but when a man is once dressed at all points for going out, his reflections turn to little account, so taking down the name of the Hotel de Modene where I lodged, I

<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>HAIL ye small sweet courtesies of life, for smooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight; 'tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in.</P>
<P>â€”Pray, Madame, said I, have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opera comique:â€”Most willingly, Monsieur, said she, laying aside her workâ€”</P>
<P>I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as I came
<PB N="162" REF="195"/>
along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interrupâˆ£tion; till at last, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</P>
<P>She was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the doorâ€”</P>
<P>â€”<HI>Tres volentieres;</HI> most willingly, said she, laying her work down upon a chair next her, and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in, with so chearful a movement and so chearful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her, I should have saidâ€”<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This woman is grateful."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="196"/>
You must turn, Monsieur, said she, going with me to the door of the shop, and pointing the way down the street I was to takeâ€”you must turn first to your left handâ€”<HI>mais prenez guarde</HI>â€”there are two turns; and be so good as to take the secondâ€”then go down a little way and you'll see a church, and when you are past it, give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <HI>pont neuf,</HI> which you must crossâ€”and there, any one will do himself the pleasure to shew youâ€”</P>
<P>She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natur'd patience the third time
<PB N="164" REF="197"/>
as the first;â€”and if <HI>tones and manners</HI> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unless to hearts which shut them outâ€”she seem'd really interested, that I should not lose myself.</P>
<P>I will not suppose it was the woâˆ£man's beauty, notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisset, I think, I ever saw, which had much to do with the sense I had of her courtesy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes,â€”and that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions.</P>
<P>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot
<PB N="165" REF="198"/>
every tittle of what she had saidâ€”so looking back, and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether I went right or notâ€”I returned back, to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or leftâ€”for that I had absolutely forgot.â€”Is it possible! said she, half laughing.â€”'Tis very possible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman, than of her good advice.</P>
<P>As this was the real truthâ€”she took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a slight courtesy.</P>
<P>â€”<HI>Attendez!</HI> said she, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilst she called a lad out of the

I am just going to send him, said she, with a packet into that quarter, and if you will have the complaisance to step in, it will be ready in a moment, and he shall attend you to the place.â€”So I walk'd in with her to the far side of the shop, and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to sit, she sat down herself in her low chair, and I instantly sat myself down besides her.</P>
<P>â€”He will be ready, Monsieur, said she, in a momentâ€”And in that moâˆ£ment, replied I, most willingly would I say something very civil to you for
<PB N="167" REF="202"/>
all these courtesies. Any one may do a casual act of good nature, but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature; and certainly, added I, if it is the same blood which comes from the heart, which deâˆ£scends to the extremes (touching her wrist) I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the worldâ€”Feel it, said she, holding out her arm. So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two fore-fingers of my other to the arteryâ€”</P>
<P>â€”Would to heaven! my dear Euâˆ£genius, thou hadst passed by, and beheld me sitting in my black coat, and in my lack-a-day-sical manner,
<PB N="168" REF="203"/>
counting the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her feverâ€”How wouldst thou have laugh'd and moâˆ£ralized upon my new profession?â€”and thou shouldst have laugh'd and moralized onâ€”Trust me, my dear Eugenius, I should have said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there are worse occupations in this world <HI>than feeling a woman's pulse.</HI>"</Q>â€”But a Grisset's! thou wouldst have saidâ€”and in an open shop!

<HEAD>THE HUSBAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD counted twenty pulsations, and was going on fast towards the fortieth, when her husband comâˆ£ing unexpected from a back parlour into the shop, put me a little out in my reckoningâ€”'Twas no body but her husband, she saidâ€”so I began a fresh scoreâ€”Monsieur is so good, quoth she, as he pass'd by us, as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulseâ€”The husband took off his hat, and making me a bow, said, I did him too much honourâ€”and havâˆ£ing
<PB N="170" REF="205"/>
said that, he put on his hat and walk'd out.</P>
<P>Good God! said I to myself, as he went outâ€”and can this man be the husband of this woman?</P>
<P>Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation, if I exâˆ£plain it to those who do not.</P>
<P>In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh: in the several endowments of mind and body, someâˆ£times the one, sometimes the other has it, so as in general to be upon a par, and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="206"/>
In Paris, there are scarce two orâˆ£ders of beings more different: for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husâˆ£band, he seldom comes thereâ€”in some dark and dismal room behind, he sits commerceless in his thrum night-cap, the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him.</P>
<P>The genius of a people where noâˆ£thing but the monarchy is <HI>salique,</HI> having ceded this department, with sundry others, totally to the womenâ€”by a continual higgling with cusâˆ£tomers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night, like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a
<PB N="172" REF="207"/>
bag, by amicable collisions, they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles, and not only become round and smooth, but will receive, some of them, a polish like a brilâˆ£liantâ€”Monsieur <HI>le Mari</HI> is little betâˆ£ter than the stone under your footâ€”</P>
<P>â€”Surelyâ€”surely man! it is not good for thee to sit aloneâ€”thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings, and this improvement of our natures from it, I appeal to, as my evidence.</P>
<P>â€”And how does it beat, Monâˆ£sieur? said she.â€”With all the beâˆ£nignity, said I, looking quietly in
<PB N="173" REF="208"/>
her eyes, that I expectedâ€”She was going to say something civil in reâˆ£turnâ€”but the lad came into the shop with the glovesâ€”<HI>A propos,</HI> said I; I want a couple of pair myself.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>THE GLOVES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE beautiful Grisset rose up when I said this, and going behind the counter, reach'd down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the side over-against her: they were all too large. The beautiful Grisset measured them one by one across my handâ€”It would not alter the dimenâˆ£sionsâ€”She begg'd I would try a single pair, which seemed to be the leastâ€”She held it openâ€”my hand slipp'd into it at onceâ€”It will not do, said I,
<PB N="175" REF="210"/>
shaking my head a littleâ€”No, said she, doing the same thing.</P>
<P>There are certain combined looks of simple subtletyâ€”where whim, and sense, and seriousness, and nonsense, are so blended, that all the languages of Babel set loose together could not express themâ€”they are communiâˆ£cated and caught so instantaneously, that you can scarce say which party is the infecter. I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about itâ€”it is enough in the present to say again, the gloves would not do; so folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counterâ€”it was narrow, and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="211"/>
The beautiful Grisset look'd someâˆ£times at the gloves, then side-ways to the window, then at the glovesâ€”and then at me. I was not disposed to break silenceâ€”I follow'd her exâˆ£ample: so I look'd at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at herâ€”and so on alternately.</P>
<P>I found I lost considerably in every attackâ€”she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eye-lashes with such penetraâˆ£tion, that she look'd into my very heart and reinsâ€”It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she didâ€”</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="212"/>
â€”It is no matter, said I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.</P>
<P>I was sensible the beautiful Grisset had not ask'd above a single livre above the priceâ€”I wish'd she had ask'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter aboutâ€”Do you think, my dear Sir, said she, mistaking my embarrassâˆ£ment, that I could ask a <HI>sous</HI> too much of a strangerâ€”and of a stranger whose politeness, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy?â€”<HI>Men croyez capable?</HI>â€”Faith! not I, said I; and if you were, you are welcomeâ€”
<PB N="178" REF="213"/>
So counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one geneâˆ£rally makes to a shopkeeper's wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRANSLATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was no body in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer. I love the chaâˆ£racter, not only because I honour the man whose manners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse; but that I once knew oneâ€”for he is no moreâ€”and why should I not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it, and telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy, the dearest of my flock and friends, whose philanthropy I never
<PB N="180" REF="215"/>
think of at this long distance from his deathâ€”but my eyes gush out with tears. For his sake, I have a predilection for the whole corps of veterans; and so I strode over the two back rows of benches, and placed myself beside him.</P>
<P>The old officer was reading attenâˆ£tively a small pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of spectacles. As soon as I sat down, he took his spectacles off, and putting them into a shagreen case, return'd them and the book into his pocket together. I half rose up, and made him a bow.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="216"/>
Translate this into any civilized language in the worldâ€”the sense is this:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here's a poor stranger come in to the boxâ€”he seems as if he knew no body; and is never likely, was he to be seven years in Paris, if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his noseâ€”'tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely in his faceâ€”and using him worse than a German."</Q></P>
<P>The French officer might as well have said it all aloud; and if he had, I should in course have put the bow I made him into French too, and told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was sensible of his atâˆ£tention,

<P>There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this <HI>short hand,</HI> and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words. For my own part, by long habitude, I do it so mechanically, that when I walk the streets of Lonâˆ£don, I go translating all the way; and have more than once stood beâˆ£hind in the circle, where not three words have been said, and have brought off twenty different dialogues with me, which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to.</P>

I was going one evening to Marâˆ£tini's concert at Milan, and was just entering the door of the hall, when the Marquesina di F*** was coming out in a sort of a hurryâ€”she was alâˆ£most upon me before I saw her; so I gave a spring to one side to let her passâ€”She had done the same, and on the same side too; so we ran our heads together: she instantly got to the other side to get out: I was just as unfortunate as she had been; for I had sprung to that side, and opâˆ£posed her passage againâ€”We both flew together to the other side, and then backâ€”and so onâ€”it was ridiâˆ£culous; we both blush'd intolerably; so I did at last the thing I should have
<PB N="184" REF="221"/>
done at firstâ€”I stood stock still, and the Marquesina had no more diffiâˆ£culty. I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her so much reparation as to wait and folâˆ£low her with my eye to the end of the passageâ€”She look'd back twice, and walk'd along it rather side-ways, as if she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass herâ€”No, said Iâ€”that's a vile translation: the Marquesina has a right to the best apology I can make her; and that opening is left for me to do it inâ€”so I ran and begg'd pardon for the embarrassment I had given her, saying it was my intention to have made her way. She answered, she
<PB N="185" REF="222"/>
was guided by the same intention toâˆ£wards meâ€”so we reciprocally thank'd each other. She was at the top of the stairs; and seeing no <HI>chichesbee</HI> near her, I begg'd to hand her to her coachâ€”so we went down the stairs, stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the adventureâ€”Upon my word, Madame, said I when I had handed her in, I made six different efforts to let you go outâ€”And I made six efforts, replied she, to let you enterâ€”I wish to heaven you would make a seventh, said Iâ€”With all my heart, said she, making roomâ€”Life is too short to be long about the forms of itâ€”so I instantly stepp'd in, and she carried me home with herâ€”And
<PB N="186" REF="223"/>
what became of the concert, St. Ceâˆ£cilia, who, I suppose, was at it, knows more than I.</P>
<P>I will only add, that the connecâˆ£tion which arose out of that translaâˆ£tion, gave me more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy.</P>

<HEAD>THE DWARF.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, exâˆ£cept by one; and who that was, will probably come out in this chapter; so that being pretty much unpreposâˆ£sessed, there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment I cast my eyes over the <HI>parterre</HI>â€”and that was, the unaccountable sport of nature in forming such numbers of dwarfsâ€”No doubt, she sports at cerâˆ£tain times in almost every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is no
<PB N="188" REF="225"/>
end to her amusementsâ€”The godâˆ£dess seems almost as merry as she is wise.</P>
<P>As I carried my idea out of the <HI>opera comique</HI> with me, I measured every body I saw walking in the streets by itâ€”Melancholy application! espeâˆ£cially where the size was extremely littleâ€”the face extremely darkâ€”the eyes quickâ€”the nose longâ€”the teeth whiteâ€”the jaw prominentâ€”to see so many miserables, by force of acciâˆ£dents driven out of their own proper class into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to write downâ€”every third man a pigmy!â€”some by ricketty heads and hump backsâ€”
<PB N="189" REF="226"/>
others by bandy legsâ€”a third set arâˆ£rested by the hand of Nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growthâ€”a fourth, in their perfect and natural state, like dwarf appleâˆ£trees; from the first rudiments and stamina of their existence, never meant to grow higher.</P>
<P>A medical traveller might say, 'tis owing to undue bandagesâ€”a spleneâˆ£tic one, to want of airâ€”and an inâˆ£quisitive traveller, to fortify the sysâˆ£tem, may measure the height of their housesâ€”the narrowness of their streets, and in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such numâˆ£bers of the <HI>Bourgoisie</HI> eat and sleep

together; but I remember, Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like any body else, in speakâˆ£ing one evening of these matters, averred, that children, like other aniâˆ£mals, might be increased almost to any size, provided they came right into the world; but the misery was, the citizens of Paris were so coop'd up, that they had not actually room enough to get themâ€”I do not call it getting any thing, said heâ€”'tis getâˆ£ting nothingâ€”Nay, continued he, rising in his argument, 'tis getting worse than nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed upâˆ£on
<PB N="191" REF="228"/>
it, shall not at last be as high as my leg. Now, Mr. Shandy being very short, there could be nothing more said upon it.</P>
<P>As this is not a work of reasoning, I leave the solution as I found it, and content myself with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carousal to the Palais Royal, and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter, which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and help'd him over. Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about
<PB N="192" REF="229"/>
fortyâ€”Never mind, said I; some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.</P>
<P>I feel some little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my species, who have neither size or strength to get on in the worldâ€”I cannot bear to see one of them trod upon; and had scarce got seated beâˆ£side my old French officer, ere the disgust was exercised, by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in.</P>
<P>At the end of the orchestra, and betwixt that and the first side-box,
<PB N="193" REF="230"/>
there is a small esplanade left, where, when the house is full, numbers of all ranks take sanctuary. Though you stand, as in the parterre, you pay the same price as in the orchestra. A poor defenceless being of this order had got thrust some how or other inâˆ£to this luckless placeâ€”the night was hot, and he was surrounded by beâˆ£ings two feet and a half higher than himself. The dwarf suffered inexâˆ£pressibly on all sides; but the thing which incommoded him most, was a tall corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a
<PB N="194" REF="231"/>
peep at what was going forwards, by seeking for some little opening beâˆ£twixt the German's arm and his body, trying first one side, then the other; but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imaginedâ€”the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest draw-well in Paris; so he civilly reach'd up his hand to the German's sleeve, and told him his distressâ€”The German turn'd his head back, look'd down-upon him as Goâˆ£liah did upon Davidâ€”and unfeelâˆ£ingly resumed his posture.</P>
<P>I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk's little horn boxâ€”And how would thy meek and
<PB N="195" REF="232"/>
courteous spirit, my dear monk! so temper'd to <HI>bear and forbear!</HI>â€”how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul's complaint!</P>
<P>The old French officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apostrophe, took the liâˆ£berty to ask me what was the matterâ€”I told him the story in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</P>
<P>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his first transâˆ£ports, which are generally unreasonâˆ£able, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knifeâ€”The German look'd back coolly,
<PB N="196" REF="233"/>
and told him he was welcome if he could reach it.</P>
<P>An injury sharpened by an insult, be it to who it will, makes every man of sentiment a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redressed it.â€”The old French officer did it with much less confusion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel, and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distressâ€”the centinel made his way up to it.â€”There was no occasion to tell the grievanceâ€”the thing told itself; so thrusting back the German instantly with his musketâ€”he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him
<PB N="197" REF="234"/>
before him.â€”This is noble! said I, clapping my hands togetherâ€”And yet you would not permit this, said the old officer, in England.</P>
<P>â€”In England, dear Sir, said I, <HI>we sit all at our ease.</HI></P>
<P>The old French officer would have set me at unity with myself, in case I had been at variance,â€”by saying it was a <HI>bon mot</HI>â€”and as a <HI>bon mot</HI> is always worth something at Paris, he offered me a pinch of snuff.</P>

from the prepossessions which it holds against the otherâ€”that the advanâˆ£tage of travel, as it regarded the <HI>sÃ§aâˆ£voir vivre,</HI> was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners; it taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making me a bow, taught us mutual love.</P>
<P>The old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense, as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his characâˆ£terâ€”I thought I loved the man; but I fear I mistook the objectâ€”'twas my own way of thinkingâ€”the difâˆ£ference was, I could not have exâˆ£pressed it half so well.</P>

It is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beastâ€”if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and starting all the way at every object which he never saw beforeâ€”I have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive; and yet I honestly confess, that many a thing gave me pain, and that I blush'd at many a word the first monthâ€”which I found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second.</P>
<P>Madame de Ramboulict, after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her, had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of townâ€”Of all women, Maâˆ£dame de Rambouliet is the most corâˆ£rect; and I never wish to see one of
<PB N="203" REF="242"/>
more virtues and purity of heartâ€”In our return back, Madame de Ramâˆ£bouliet desired me to pull the cordâ€”I ask'd her if she wanted any thingâ€”<HI>Rien que pisser,</HI> said Madame de Ramboulietâ€”</P>
<P>Grieve not, gentle traveller, to let Madame de Rambouliet pâ€”ss onâ€”And, ye fair mystic nymphs! go each one <HI>pluck your rose,</HI> and scatter them in your pathâ€”for Madame de Ramâˆ£bouliet did no moreâ€”I handed Maâˆ£dame de Rambouliet out of the coach; and had I been the priest of the chaste CASTALIA, I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum.</P>
