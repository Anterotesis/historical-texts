<HEAD>THE
PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Town has been amus'd. with a
Story of late about a Design discovered
at St. <HI>Germans</HI> to have stollen away
the Prince of Wales, and some of our
News-Writers have been prevail'd with to put
it into their Publick Papers, and bestow it upon
the World.</P>
<P>Since then he that Prints a Story subjects both
Himself and his Tale to the Censure of every
Reader, I have as much Right as another to pass
my Judgment in the Case.</P>
<P>And tho' I am first assur'd from very good
Hands, that the Story it self is a Forgery, and
that at St. <HI>Germains</HI> they know nothing of the
Matter; yet I think it may not be amiss to give
the World some short Observatious upon the Sub∣ject,
because I believe they will quickly hear more
<PB REF="3"/>
of it. For the Story of Stealing the Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI> was not contriv'd to no purpose, but as an
Anticedent to something which was to come after,
which the World is to be acquainted with in good
time, when 'tis first observ'd how they will relish
this.</P>
<P>If what I shall say be Offensive to such who
are concern'd for the <HI>Young Gentleman,</HI> they
ought to be angry with the Broachers of the
Story, and not with the Author of these Obser∣vations.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ARGUMENT,
Shewing, That the
Prince of WALES,
Tho' a PROTESTANT, has no
just Pretensions to the
Crown of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG those People who are
more than ordinarily careful for the
Future, it has been a Question not
a little debated, What shall we do
for a King in <HI>England</HI> after the Decease of
his present Majesty and the Princess in case
they should die without Issue?</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
And tho' it be properly a Work which no
Body has any thing to do with but a Par∣liament,
yet our busie Politicians have ran∣sack't
Forreign Countries for a King.</P>
<P>Some wiser than others, have propos'd
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Son, the young Prince
of <HI>Piedmont.</HI> Some one, some another, as
their Fancies guide them. <HI>Ay,</HI> but says a
Learned Rabbi, skill'd in the Letter of the
Law, <HI>he is a Roman Catholick, and that
is a Barr by our Constitution. Well,</HI> re∣plys
another, <HI>but he may he sent into</HI> Eng∣land
<HI>to be Educated a Protestant.</HI> At the
hearing of which Medium, a Third Party
have thought fit to start a Case on the other
side; <HI>Why, so may some body else?</HI> and so all
Parties become Friends again.</P>
<Q>They that have Ears to hear let them hear.</Q>
<P>First, We thank those Gentlemen for sa∣tisfying
the World that they despair now
of the Restoration of K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>James,</HI> which
has been so long talk'd of, and are content
to Postpone their Happiness to a Time so
remote, that possibly it may never come to
pass.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
And as to the Case in hand, if they
think it proper, they may propose it to the
next Parliament, and no doubt but what
they do in it the Nation will be well satified
with, and in the mean time we refer them
to the Experiment.</P>
<P>But it may not be improper to Exa∣mine
here the Project laid to Try the
Nation, How such a Story would take with
them.</P>
<P>And if you Examine the News-Paper,
you will find it introduc'd into the World
with a <HI>We hear. We hear there has been a De∣sign
discover'd at St. Germans to steal away the
Prince of Wales, and to convey him over into</HI>
England, <HI>to be brought up a Protestant.</HI></P>
<P>The Writer of this News wou'd be ve∣ry
helpful in the Discovery, if he wou'd
honestly inform the World how and where
he heard the News; whether he had it by
Letter, or Messenger, Post, or Express;
for 'tis certain that no body else can hear
any thing of it.</P>
<P>If he will own <HI>with more honesty than he
wrote,</HI> that he really invented it of his own
Head, to help fill up his own Paper, as no
question they many times do in other Ca∣ses;
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
It will be the best Reply to my Sug∣gestions
that any body can make, and I must
allow all I am saying is as Impertinent as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Knavish.</HI></P>
<P>But if he was directed to write it by some
body, no matter by who, it must be from a
design.</P>
<P>I shall attempt therefore to open the Eyes
of the World a little, by Examining the In∣coherences
and Inconsistences of the Story,
and then the Design of it.</P>
<P>As to the Incoherence of the Story, a
discovery of a Design, but by no Evi∣dence,
or Information, no Persons de∣signing
taken, nor none enquired after to
be apprehended, no body nam'd to be dis∣coverers,
or discovered; so that they are
only supposed to be afraid of such and such
a thing, and to have doubled the Guards
to prevent it.</P>
<P>Then the Reason is set down for which
he shou'd be convey'd away, to be carried
into <HI>England.</HI> Had they stopt there, some∣thing
might have been meant, some Mis∣chief
might have been supposed to have
been design'd against him. But to clear it
up to the World, the very bottom of the
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
design is laid open, that they shou'd take
the Child away to Educate him <HI>a Prote∣stant.</HI></P>
<P>Unless the Author of this News was let
into the Project I speak of, he wou'd ne∣ver
have suggested it, but all Man∣kind wou'd have thought, that if there
had been any danger of stealing him a∣way,
to carry him into <HI>England,</HI> it shou'd
be with some wicked design to <HI>make away
with him,</HI> his coming being death by our
Law, rather then Educate him in the Pro∣testant
Religion.</P>
<P>The Party therefore that cou'd descend
to these Particulars, tho' no Evidence be
produc'd, nor no Confession made of any
Person concern'd, must I say be let into the
design.</P>
<P>And now I have said so much of a De∣sign,
I desire to Explain what I mean by
it.</P>
<P>The design I mean, is not to steal the
Prince of <HI>Wales, as they call him,</HI> away, and
bring him into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to broach an Oponion among the
People, That on the failure of the present
Settlement, the Prince of <HI>VVales</HI> is the true
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
and lawful Heir of the Crown, and that to
qualifie him to Enjoy it, he may be bred a
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estant.</P>
<P>And to insinuate this more finely into
our Fancies it is put the other way, That
they are afraid the English People shou'd
steal him away, to make him a Protestant
in order to have the Kingdom, whether he
will or no.</P>
<P>I cannot help making a little sport of this
Jest—<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we shou'd be made believe the
late King wou'd be so chary of this Child
and his Religion, as to prevent his being
declar'd Heir apparent to the Crown of
<HI>England,</HI> on the bare apprehensions of his
being Educated a Protestant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the English shou'd be in such
distress for a Successor to the Crown, when
God be thank'd there are Two happy Lives
to Enjoy it before hand, as to go abroad to
steal One.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Crown of <HI>England</HI> shou'd be
accounted so mean a thing, that a Guard
shou'd be set upon any body to prevent
their being <HI>spirited away</HI> from the Court
of <HI>France</HI> to be made King of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
And to add to the ridiculous part of it,
That any body on pretence of Educating
him a Protestant, shou'd dare to bring him
into <HI>England,</HI> without Licence from the
present Government, as is expresly pro∣vided
for by Act of Parliament. They
wou'd make <HI>a special Protestant</HI> of him in∣deed,
where he must be a Martyr at first
Conversion, to bring him where setting his
Foot was immediate Death by the Statutes
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The insinuation therefore of stealing the
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to make a Protestant of
him, is a Figurative Expression, a <HI>Metani∣my,</HI>
a way of speaking wherein something
is intended which is not expressed, and if I
could make it speak English, 'tis thus:</P>
<P><HI>That if you please, Gentlemen, to have the
Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>to Reign over you, after the fai∣lure
of the present Settlement, he is at your Ser∣vice,
and will come and be brought up in the Pro∣testant
Religion, whenever you think fit.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not enter into any Discoveries of
the Nature of the Succession of the Crown of
<HI>England,</HI> nor of the Right of such Families as
pretend to it, they are things to tender to be
handled here.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
But in this case I may presume to say, that
since the present Settlement of the Crown of
<HI>England</HI> is declar'd by the Parliament of <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
own'd by the World, and receiv'd by
the general Ascent of the Nation, at the end
of this Settlement the same Collective Body
of the Nation, are the only Judges of the
Right of any Person whatsoever.</P>
<P>And as for the Gentlemen who are so wil∣ling
to restore the Line of King <HI>James,</HI> they
are desir'd to consider, that by attempting it
in this method, they come under a Necessity
of owning the Authority of the Parliament
of <HI>England:</HI> the same Authority which Ab∣dicated
his Father, and by consequence must
justifie all the Proceedings of the late Revo∣lution,
and this will be a bitter Pill to them.</P>
<P>Not but that stranger things than these
have been done too for a Crown, but this
must be done before an English Parliament
can so much as consider of it; nay by suggest∣ing,
or so much as supposing his Right to be
referr'd to the English Nation, it must at the
same time be suppos'd that he wou'd not
stick at all that to be declar'd capable of In∣heriting
the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>These are such contradictory and incon∣stent
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
things, as makes the Story very ridicu∣lous,
and shows the Party is driven to <HI>strange
shifts</HI> to bring to pass their designs, and wou'd
comply with any thing to get the Reins in
their hands again.</P>
<P>Now if they only want to know how the
Nation wou'd resent an Attempt of this Na∣ture,
they may be soon satisfied in that point,
by moving it in Parliament; and in the mean
time they need not pretend to keep a Guard
upon him at St. <HI>Germain,</HI> for I dare say the
English Nation will as soon steal away his Fa∣ther
as him, and they have not shown them∣selves
so fond of either, as to make them a∣fraid
of it.</P>
<P>I shall not at all enter into the Enquiry
concerning the Legitimacy of his Birth, nor
quote the learned Authorities of the eminent
Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> on that Head, whose Evidence is to
as much purpose as the matter is insignificant.</P>
<P>For be it so, that King <HI>James</HI> is the true Fa∣ther
of the Child, it matters not one farthing
in the Title to the Crown; for his Father,
whose Legitimacy no body doubts, by being
a Roman Catholick, has rendred himself un∣capable
of the Government, and so does the
Son, and Settlements are not to be alter'd eve∣ry
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
time he thinks fit to alter his Religion.</P>
<P>But methinks it remains as an Eternal
Mark either of the Folly, or Pride of his Pa∣rents,
that if the Queen was really with
Child (which (<HI>God forgive me if I am mi∣staken</HI>)
I never believed) she did not put it
past all possibility of Debate, by giving such
undeniable proofs of it, <HI>as 'tis known such Ca∣ses
will admit of,</HI> and that to those Persons in
particular as she knew wou'd be very sorry
to see it.</P>
<P>The Queen was not a Lady of so much
Nicety, as that she shou'd decline letting such
Female Effects of her Conception be known,
<HI>especially to her own Sex,</HI> as wou'd have con∣founded
all Gainsayers.</P>
<P>Nor did she want the Vanity of shewing
those invincible Demonstrations to some
Persons in the Court, to whom she might
have reason to think the truth, would have
been a particular Mortification.</P>
<P>The truth then being so easie to be made
plain, <HI>and those easie steps being omitted,</HI> gives
me more cause of doubt in the Matter, than
all the Affirmatives of Evidence <HI>Fuller</HI> can do,
for it was not a thing for the Nation to prove
a Negative upon, as some have pretended to
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
expect, but they in whose power it was once
to make it plain, having omitted it, Man∣kind
ought to doubt the truth of it, because
had it been true, none but Madmen, or worse,
would have conceal'd any part of it.</P>
<P>Nor does the Declaration of the present
King, when Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> say any more,
than that there was ground to suspect it;
and then concludes, <HI>that the Examination both
of it, and the Right of Succession, is referr'd to
a free Parliament.</HI> Which Parliament having
settled the Succession, according to that Ar∣ticle
on the unexpected Occasion of the Ab∣dication
of King <HI>James,</HI> and his carrying this
Son on whom the doubt was rais'd into
<HI>France,</HI> to be brought up a Papist, <HI>Examining
into his Birth became needless;</HI> and it signifies
nothing whether he be Legitimate, or no;
his Father rendred them both incapable, by
the Article of Religion, and the Nation has
settled the Succession another way.</P>
<P>This, with submission, I think to be the
true state of the Case, and will pass for such
with me, till I see it stated otherwise by some
body that understands it better than I do.</P>
<P>But some have started a Case which re∣quires
a word or two of Reply.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<HI>If the Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>be allowed to be the
Legitimate Son of King</HI> James, <HI>and had been a
Protestant, there had been no Objection against
his Title.</HI></P>
<P>This has a plain Answer in the sequel of
the Story. The Abdication of King <HI>James</HI>
did not consist in his Male-administration,
<HI>but in his deserting the Nation;</HI> and it may be
remembred that there was great strugling
for the Word in the <HI>Convention,</HI> some
wou'd have had the word <HI>Deserted</HI> voted in∣stead
of <HI>Abdicated.</HI></P>
<P>Now if King <HI>James</HI> Deserted the Nation,
so did his Son with him, and thereby the
Throne became vacant, and the power of
Government devolv'd upon such as were
next Heirs; and who they were was to be
decided by the Parliament, who have been
allow'd to be the Judges of the Right of
Succession in all Ages.</P>
<P>Now the Parliament did not upon this
Vacancy of the Throne proceed to Elect a
King, <HI>as some People are mighty fond of saying,</HI>
and so alter our Constitution to an Elective
Monarchy.</P>
<P>But they proceeded to Examine whose
the Right of Government was, and to make
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
a Declaration of that Right by Authority of
Parliament, and King <HI>James</HI> and his Son,
<HI>if he be his Son,</HI> having left the Kingdom,
they declared that the Throne was thereby
vacant, that is, by their deferting the People,
and that the Succession ought to descend so
and so; which Succession they farther con∣firm'd
by the Sanction of an Act of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Had K. <HI>James</HI> notwithstanding his Male∣administration,
continued in the Kingdom,
tho' he might have been Deposed, yet the
Parliament must have gone upon other mea∣sures
to have transferr'd the Succession to
the Crown from him to another Head.</P>
<P>On this account it is that the King and
Queen of <HI>England</HI> are declared rightful and
lawful.</P>
<P>And on this Foundation the young Gen∣tleman
we speak of, tho' he were the Legi∣timate
Son of King <HI>James,</HI> and a Protestant,
yet having deserted the People of <HI>England</HI>
with his Father, has equally abdicated the
Government, and the Throne was thereby
vacant.</P>
<P>The Point of Religion is the next Barr;
the Commons of <HI>England</HI> at the first Meet∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
of the Convention, did not make any
new Laws, but only made a Declaration of
what was before the undoubted Right of the
People of <HI>England,</HI> and what ought to be
observ'd by any Prince who shou'd hereafter
succeed in the Government, and in order to
obviate all Objections <HI>against</HI> the continuing
under the Government of King <HI>James,</HI> and
before they had entred upon ths Considera∣tion
or his having gone away and left them,
they laid a firm Foundation of a Regular
Government, in a Message to the Lords,
carried up by Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> and a Body of
their Members, in which the Vote of the
House was read at the Barr of the House of
Lords, thus:</P>
<P>Resolved <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI>
<Q>That it is inconsistent with the Constituti∣on
of this Protestant Kingdom, to be
governed by a Popish Prince.</Q></P>
<P>Now how a Popish Prince may pretend to
be converted and turn Protestant, to obtain a
Crown, and how often he may turn and re∣turn
on the same account, and whether the
Settlement of the Succession is oblig'd to
change with him; or how far a Parliament
wou'd think themselves oblig'd to take notice
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
of such changes of the Religion of a Prince,
these are things not for me to determine.</P>
<P>But this I dare be free to determine, that
no Parliament will send into <HI>France</HI> to steal
away a Prince to make a Protestant of, and
so force him to accept of the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
whether he will or no, and especially a
Person whom they thought fit to leave whol∣ly
out of their Settlement before.</P>
<P>So that these Gentlemen may save them∣selves
the labour of attempting the Conver∣sion
of this Prince, for the Settlement of our
Succession was not built upon his being a Ro∣man
Catholick, but upon the Abdication of
his Father, and so far upon his own, as his
Birth shall appear to give him a Title; since
he has from that time forward absented him∣self
from the Kingdom to which his preten∣ces,
<HI>if he had any,</HI> were to be made.</P>
<P>It may be ask'd here, To what end and
purpose K. <HI>James</HI> convey'd him away, if he
had any confidence in the possibility of clear∣ing
up the point of his Legitimacy, he might
have left him here, it was impracticable, that
any violence cou'd have been pretended to be
acted upon him, for nothing cou'd have been
charg'd upon him, if the Illegitimacy of his
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Birth had been alledg'd, the proof wou'd have
been put upon the Nations side, till which no∣thing
cou'd legally have been done to his pre∣judice,
but as it is, the proof remains at their
own doors, which since they thought fit to o∣mit,
I see no concern the Nation has in the
matter.</P>
<P>For, suppose Q. <HI>Mary</HI> had really been with
Child, and had, <HI>for as wise ends as other things
were then done,</HI> thought fit never to let it be
known, and a Child had been born in the
dark, and bred up in private, and the Nation
knew nothing of the matter, but that twen∣ty
years after, when the Parliament might
have settled the Succession another way, this
Child shou'd be Trumpt up as a right Heir
to the Crown.</P>
<P>It wou'd be never the less true that he was
K. <HI>James</HI>'s Son, and he wou'd have as much
right to the Crown as a real Son; but who
wou'd have believ'd it; wou'd not the Na∣tion
say, and reason good, <HI>Why, was it not
told us that the Queen was with Child? Why,
was not some of the Royal Family entrusted with
the knowledge of it? Why was not the
Queen's being with Child made known, and
the Protesta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ladies of the Court shown</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20"/><HI>such proofs of it as that they might be able to
testifie the truth of it</HI>—wou'd it be enough
to say it was below the Queen to trouble her
head about it, and she did not think the satis∣faction
of the Nation worth her while.</P>
<P>I question whether any Nation in <HI>Europe</HI>
wou'd accept of a King upon such terms; we
see 'tis quite otherwise in <HI>France,</HI> where all the
Princes of the Blood are at liberty, and claim
it as a priviledge to come into the very
Chamber of the Queen when she is in Tra∣vail,
and to see the Infant as soon as 'tis come
into the World.</P>
<P>The Case thus stated, I put it upon all the
Champions of their Party to disprove the Ar∣gument
which I lay down in these few words.</P>
<P><HI>That the Persons on whom the proof of his
Legitimacy lay, having omitted the Legal de∣monstrations
of it, which they ought to have gi∣ven,
'tis very reasonable that we shou'd question
the truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>And while the Ligitimacy of his Birth re∣mains
a question, the People of <HI>England</HI> ought
not to trouble their heads about him, for 'tis
not for us to enquire of it, but they shou'd
have made it out whose business it was.</P>
<P>Thus far the reason of the Case is plain,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
without any need to go to proving of Nega∣tives.</P>
<P>And while it is thus, they may even take
their double Guards off of him again, for if
he is ever Kidnap'd away to make a Prote∣stant
of, we must be reduc'd to very hard
terms, and the English Crown go a begging
at a most pitiful rate.</P>
<P>I confess I am no Friend to a Common∣wealth
Government in <HI>England</HI> when I re∣flect
on the last, how ill it was manag'd, and
how soon it fell into Disorders and Parties,
and how little a while it continu'd; but I had
rather see a Commonwealth set up, or any
thing (Popery excepted) than that we shou'd
be brought to seek a King at the French
Court, and one that we have repudiated as
born in hugger-mugger, no body knows how,
nor where, and that his Mother did not
think it worth while to give the English Na∣tion
satisfaction about when she was with
Child, but on the contrary, scorn'd the At∣tempts
of some of the first Quality to make
the Discovery.</P>
<P>But that which adds to the Banter too, is
that we shou'd steal him away. <HI>Bless us all!</HI>
that we shou'd turn <HI>Kidnappers</HI> for a King,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
and spirit folks Children away, <HI>for let him be
whose Son he will, 'tis certain he is some bodies,</HI> to
make Kings of them.</P>
<P>The truth on't is, it is not a light matter
to be a King of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis a Post of great
Difficulty as well as Honour, and perhaps K.
<HI>James</HI> may be afraid to venture his Son, least
he shou'd have no better success than him∣self,
which wou'd certaily fall out if he took
his Measures.</P>
<P>But to think that the English Nation shou'd
ever entertain such thoughts of his Son, <HI>allow he
were so,</HI> as to take him away by stealth. I cannot
call it an affront to the Nation, 'tis rather a
Banter upon the poor young Gentleman, who
I dare say knows not a word of the matter.</P>
<P>I remember I have heard it said before the
Fire of <HI>London</HI> happen'd, news was carried
down into the Country that the City was
burnt, and was reported publickly above 100
Miles from <HI>London,</HI> at least two days before
the Fire began, which was a certain Token
of a design to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>If I shou'd judge of the present Case by the
practice of those People, I shou'd expect to
hear next Post that this young Prince is re∣ally
lost, carried away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the unspeak∣able
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
Grief of his Parents, and the Distur∣bance
of the whole Court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not venture to say it will be so, but
I may venture to say there are several Turns
of State in the World which such a Thing
may answer.</P>
<P>As first, If it shou'd be true that at the bot∣tom
of the business, this was not the Legiti∣mate
Son of K. <HI>James,</HI> which however uncer∣tain
we are of it, it is well enough known to
themselves—Why now they see the Sham
won't take, and they have ran the Jest so far
as that they have ruin'd themselves, and the
Show is over, they will of course be soon wea∣ry
of the Child, and as a Plot made a Prince
of him, so another may reduce him to what
they please; he may be lost in the dark, and
be heard of no more, and give it out, that the
English have carry'd him away to reserve him
in <HI>Petto,</HI> as the Pope does his Cardinals, to
make a King of him when they want one, and
in the mean time bring him up a Heretick.</P>
<P>This is an easy way to be rid of him when∣ever
they please, and so the poor young Gen∣tleman
had better have appear'd in the world
what he really was—nor do we want Instan∣ces
of Impostors set up in the World to per∣sonate
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
Princes who have afterwards vanish'd
as they came when the Persons who set them
up cou'd not bring to pass their designs by it.</P>
<P>Or if we shou'd suppose that the King of
<HI>France</HI> has his Eyes on the Succession of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
(as he has lately had on that of <HI>Spain</HI>)
in right of the Dutchess of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and pos∣sibly
may oblige King <HI>James</HI> to make the se∣cond
Experiment of leaving him the Crown
by his last Will and Testament, I do not say
such Chimera's as these are in the heads of
any body, but I do say that if they are, 'twill
be absolutely necessary to remove the Per∣son
we are speaking of out of the way.</P>
<P>And what likelier Project can they have
to rid themselves of him, and as they may
think, at the same time to make the Nation
uneasy, then to give out that the English have
carried him away to make a Protestant of
him.</P>
<P>These are Ends▪ I say, that such a thing will
serve, and I may be excused making such re∣mote
Guesses and Suppositions, for none of
them are so wild and chimerical, as the fan∣cy
of bringing him hither.</P>
<P>And if any such Measures shou'd be taken
with the young Gentlemen, I think a single
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Author may venture to enter this Protest in
the Name of the whole Nation, that 'tis a
Trick of their own, and the English Nation
can have no hand in it.</P>
<P>The Authority of the Nation cannot have
any hand in it, because they can do nothing
in private, and it must be known if it had
been Parliamentary.</P>
<P>The honest protestant loyal Party cannot
be said to have a hand in it, because Mankind
is said not to be able to do that which their
known Interest forbids them to do, and no
body can imagine that Party should ever de∣sign
to bring him hither, without imagining
at the same time that it was to Murther and
Destroy him, which God forbid.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> English Party, they can∣not
design it, because 'twill not any way an∣swer
their designs.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If ever they shou'd have power to
make him a King publickly, 'tis plain he will
serve their turn as well if he be a Papist as a
Protestant, or else they cannot be what we call
them, <HI>Jacobites,</HI> that is, Friends to King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If they bring him in only to reserve
him in <HI>Petto,</HI> as I said, it must be one of these
two ways, either publickly or privately.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26"/>
If publickly, unless they have a Force to
defend him, they bring him only to Martyr∣dom,
for our Laws will take immediate hold
on him, and put him to death.</P>
<P>If privately, to be reserv'd till the Line shall
fail, he must then reside <HI>Incognito,</HI> and if ever
the time shou'd come to set him up, having
been lost so many years, no body wou'd know
him, and the Nation wou'd never believe
'twas he, which wou'd always leave room
for Impostors, and setting up sham Princes to
mise Insurrections, and disturb the publick
<HI>Peace</HI> of the Nation, as in the Case of <HI>Perkin
Warbeck</HI> and <HI>Ralph Wilford</HI> in the days' of
<HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh.</P>
<P>So that rightly examin'd, this Sham will
never fasten upon the English Nation, for it
will answer the Ends of neither Friend nor
Foe.</P>
<P>But if ever we hear that the <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Wales,</HI> as they call him, is lost, carried away,
it must either be that <HI>they</HI> are conscious to
themselves of his being a foster Son, and the
design having miscarried, are weary of the
Adopt, and so have dismist him this World;
or else that he is remov'd to try another
Fetch for the English Crown by way of Ti∣tle,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
which, if the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Piedmont</HI> dies, falls
by Inheritance, the Barr of Religion excep∣ted,
to the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> in right of the
Wife of the present Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI>
who is Grand-daughter to a Daughter of
<HI>England</HI> by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First.</P>
<P>And as to the Barr of Religion, pray what's
that to a good Army; What's the Gospel to
a Kettle Drum? or Justice and Laws to a Re∣giment
of Curiasseeres? If the French King
comes once to have a fair Claim to the Crown
of <HI>England</HI> for his Grandson, and you have
nothing to plead in Barr but his Religion,
he'll talk with you about that in other
Terms—</P>
<P>You must certainly expect to talk in the
Insernal Language of Fire and Smoke, and
tho' tis hoped we shov'd have Zeal enough
for our Religion, to fight him to the last
Gasp, yet all Men must allow the <HI>Power</HI> of
<HI>France,</HI> at this time is so great, that 'twould
be much better never to have it brought to
a Trial.</P>
