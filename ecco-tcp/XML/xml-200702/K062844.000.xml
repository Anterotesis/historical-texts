<P>THE EVIDENCES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, By the Right Honorable <HI>JOSEPH ADDISON,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> To which are added, Several Discourses against Atheism and Infidelity, and in Defence of the Chri∣stian Revelation, occasionally published by Him and Others: And now collected into one Body, and digested under their proper Heads. With a PREFACE, containing the Sentiments of Mr. BOYLE, Mr. LOCK, and Sir ISAAC NEWTON, concerning the <HI>Gospel-Revelation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Character of Mr. <HI>Addi∣son</HI> and his Writings, for Just∣ness of thought, Strength of reasoning, and Purity of style, is too well establish'd to need a Recommendation; but their great∣est Ornament, and that which gives a Lustre to all the rest, is his appear∣ing, throughout, a zealous Advocate for Virtue and Religion against Pro∣faneness and Infidelity. And because his excellent Discourses upon those Subjects lie dispersed among his other Writings, and are by that means not so generally known and read as they deserve, it was judg'd to be no unsea∣sonable Service to Religion at this
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
time, to move the Bookseller to pub∣lish them together in a distinct Vo∣lume; in hopes, that the Politeness and Beauty peculiar to Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Writings would make their way to persons of a superior Character and a more liberal Education; and, that as they come from the hands of a <HI>Lay∣man,</HI> they may be the more readily re∣ceiv'd and consider'd by young Gentle∣men, as a proper <HI>Manual of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Our modern Scepticks and Infi∣dels are great Pretenders to Reason and Philosophy, and are willing to have it thought that none who are really possess'd of those Talents, can easily assent to the Truth of Christi∣anity. But it falls out very unfortu∣nately for them and their Cause, that those persons within our own memory, who are confess'd to have been the most perfect Reasoners and Philosophers of their time, are also known to have been firm Believ∣ers, and they, <HI>Laymen</HI>; I mean Mr. BOYLE, Mr. LOCK, Sir ISAAC
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
NEWTON, and Mr. ADDISON: who, modestly speaking, were <HI>as</HI> good Thinkers and Reasoners, as the best among the Scepticks and Infidels at this day. Some of them might have their particular Opinions about this or that point in Christianity, which will be the case as long as men are men; but the thing here insisted on, is, That they were <HI>accurate Reasoners,</HI> and at the same time <HI>firm Believers.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. BOYLE, the most exact Search∣er into the Works of Nature that any Age has known, and who saw Atheism and Infidelity beginning to shew them∣selves in the loose and voluptuous reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, pursu'd his Philosophical Enquiries with Religious Views, to establish the minds of men in a firm belief and thorow sense of the infinite Pow∣er and Wisdom of the great Creator.</P>
<P>This account we have from one who was intimately ac∣quainted with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Burnet.</HI></NOTE> and preach'd his fu∣neral
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
Sermon:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It appear'd to those who convers'd with him in his Enquiries into Nature, that his main design in that (on which as he had his own eye most con∣stantly, so he took care to put others often in mind of it) was to raise in himself and others, vaster thoughts of the Greatness and Glory, and of the Wisdom and Goodness of God. This was so deep in his thoughts, that he concludes the Article of his Will, which relates to that Illustri∣ous Body, the Royal Society, in these Words: <HI>wishing them a happy success in their laudable Attempts, to discover the true nature of the</HI> Works of God; <HI>and praying, that they and all other Searchers into</HI> Physical <HI>Truths, may cordially refer their At∣tainments to the</HI> Glory <HI>of the</HI> great Author of Nature, <HI>and to the Com∣fort of Mankind.</HI>'</Q>
The same person also speaks thus of him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">He had the profoundest Veneration for the great God of Heaven and Earth,
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
that ever I observ'd in any person. The very name of GOD was never mention'd by him without a Pause and a visible Stop in his Discourse.</Q></P>
<P>And, of the strictness and exem∣plariness of the whole course of his life, he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 9.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">I might here challenge the whole Tribe of <HI>Libertines,</HI> to come and view the Usefulness, as well as the Ex∣cellence of the Christian Religion, in a Life that was entirely dedicated to it.</Q></P>
<P>Against the <HI>Atheists,</HI> he wrote his <HI>Free Enquiry into the receiv'd Notion of Nature</HI> (to confute the pernicious Principle of ascribing Effects to <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> which are only produced by the infinite Power and Wisdom of God;) and also his <HI>Essay about</HI> final <HI>Causes of things Natural,</HI> to shew that all things in nature were made and contriv'd with great order, and every thing for its proper End and Use, by an all-wise Creator.</P>
<P>Against the <HI>Deists,</HI> he wrote a Trea∣tise <HI>of Things above Reason</HI>; in which
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
he makes it appear that several things which we judge to be contrary to Rea∣son, because <HI>above</HI> the reach of our Understanding, are not therefore to be thought unreasonable, because we can∣not comprehend them, since they may be apparently reasonable to a greater and more comprehensive Understand∣ing. And he wrote another Treatise, to show the Possibility of the <HI>Resur∣rection of the same Body.</HI></P>
<P>The Veneration he had for the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> appears not only from his studying them with great Exact∣ness, and exhorting others to do the same; but more particularly from a distinct Treatise which he wrote, on purpose to defend the <HI>Scripture-Style,</HI> and to answer all the objections which Profane and Irreligious persons have made against it. And speaking of Mo∣rality consider'd as a Rule of Life, he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 17.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">I have formerly taken pains to peruse Books of Mo∣rality; yet since they have only a power to <HI>persuade,</HI> but not to <HI>command,</HI> and
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
Sin and Death do not necessarily attend the Disobedience of them, they have the less Influence; for since we may take the liberty to question human Writers, I find that the methods they take to impose their Writings upon us, may serve to countenance either Truth or Falshood.</Q></P>
<P>His Zeal to <HI>propagate</HI> Christianity in the World, appears by many and large Benefactions to that end; which are enumerated in his Funeral Sermon:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">He was at the Charge of the Translation and Impression of the New Testament into the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 36.</NOTE> which he sent over all the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> He gave a noble Reward to him that translated <HI>Grotius</HI>'s incomparable Book of the <HI>Truth of the Christian Religion</HI> into <HI>Arabick,</HI> and was at the Charge of a whole Impression, which he took care to order to be distributed in all the Countries where that Language is understood. He was resolved to have carried on the impression of the
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
New Testament in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Lan∣guage; but the Company thought it became them to be the Doers of it, and so suffer'd him only to give a large share towards it.— He was at seven hundred Pounds charge in the Edition of the <HI>Irish</HI> Bi∣ble,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life</HI> p. 37.</NOTE> which he ordered to be di∣stributed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and he contribu∣ted largely both to the Impressions of the <HI>Welsh</HI> Bible, and of the <HI>Irish</HI> Bible in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He gave during his Life three hundred Pounds to advance the design of propagating the Christian Religion in <HI>America</HI>; and as soon as he heard that the <HI>East-India</HI> Company were entertain∣ing Propositions for the like design in the <HI>East,</HI> he presently sent an hun∣dred Pounds for a Beginning and an Example, but intended to carry it much further, when it should be set on foot to purpose. He had design∣ed, tho' some Accidents did upon great considerations divert him from settling it during his Life, but not
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
from ordering it by his Will, that a liberal Provision should be made for one, who should in a very few well-digested Sermons, every year set forth the Truth of the Christian Religion, in General, without de∣scending to the Subdivisions amongst Christians; and who should be changed every third Year, that so this noble Study and Employment might pass through many Hands, by which means many might be∣come Masters of the Argument.</Q></P>
<P>In his younger years, he had thoughts of entring into <HI>Holy Orders,</HI> and one reason that determin'd him against it, was, that he believed he might in some respects be more ser∣viceable to Religion, by continuing a Layman;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">His having no Interests,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 37.</NOTE> with relation to Religion, besides those of sa∣ving his own Soul, gave him, as he thought, a more unsuspected Au∣thority in writing or acting on that Side. He knew the Prophane Crew
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
fortified themselves against all that was said by Men of our Profession, with this, that it was their Trade, and that they were paid for it: He hoped therefore that he might have the more Influence, the less he shared in the Patrimony of the Church.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. LOCK, whose accurate Ta∣lent in reasoning is so much celebra∣ted even by the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and <HI>Infi∣dels</HI> of our Times, show'd his Zeal for Christianity, first, in his middle age, by publishing a Discourse on pur∣pose to demonstrate the Reasonable∣ness of believing Jesus to be the pro∣mis'd Messiah; and, after that, in the last years of his Life, by a very judicious Commentary upon several of the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>He speaks of the MIRACLES wrought by our Saviour and his Apo∣stles, in the strongest manner, both as Facts unexceptionably true, and as
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
the clearest Evidences of a divine mission.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reasonable∣ness,</HI> &amp;c. p. 256.</NOTE> His words are these; <HI>The Evidence of our Saviour's mission from Heaven is so great, in the multitude of his</HI> Miracles <HI>he did before all sorts of people (which the divine Providence and Wisdom has so order'd, that they never were nor could be denied by any of the Enemies and Opposers of Christianity) that what he deliver'd, cannot but be received as the Oracles of God, and unquestionable verity.</HI> And again;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 263.</NOTE> <HI>After his Re∣surrection, he sent his Apo∣postles amongst the Nati∣ons, accompanied with</HI> Miracles; <HI>which were done in all Parts so fre∣quently, and before so many Wit∣nesses of all sorts, in broad day-light, that, as I have often observ'd, the Enemies of Christianity have never dared to deny them; No, not</HI> Julian <HI>himself: who neither wanted Skill nor Power to enquire into the Truth; nor would have failed to have pro∣claimed
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
and exposed it, if he could have detected any falshood in the Hi∣story of the Gospel, or found the least ground to question the Matter of Fact published of Christ, and his Apo∣stles, The Number and Evidence of the Miracles done by our Saviour and his Followers, by the power and force of Truth bore down this mighty and accomplished Emperor and all his Parts, in his own Dominions. He durst not deny so plain Matter of Fact; Which being granted, the truth of our Saviour's Doctrine and Mission una∣voidably follows; notwithstanding what∣soever Artful Suggestions his Wit could invent, or Malice should offer, to the contrary.</HI></P>
<P>To those who ask, <HI>What need was there of a Saviour? What Advantage have we by Jesus Christ? Mr.</HI> LOCK replies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 255.</NOTE> <HI>It is e∣nough to justifie the fitness of any thing to be done, by resolving it in∣to the Wisdom of God? who has done it; Whereof our narrow Understandings,
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
and short Views may utterly incapa∣citate us to judge. We know little of this Visible, and nothing at all of the State of that Intellectual World (wherein, are infinite numbers and de∣grees of Spirits out of the reach of our ken or guess,) and therefore know not what Transactions there were be∣tween God and our Saviour, in refe∣rence to his Kingdom. We know not what need there was to set up a Head and a Chieftain, in opposition to</HI> THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD, THE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR, &amp;c. <HI>whereof there are more than obscure intimations in Scripture. And we shall take too much upon us, if we shall call God's Wisdom or Provi∣dence to Account, and pertly condemn for needless, all that our weak, and perhaps biassed</HI> UNDERSTANDING, <HI>cannot account for.</HI> And then he shews at large the <HI>necessity</HI> there was of the Gospel-Revelation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. 260.</NOTE> to deliver the World from the miserable State of Darkness and
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
Ignorance that mankind were in, 1. As to the true knowledge of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">257.264</NOTE> 2. As to the Worship to be paid him, 3. As to the duties to be perform'd to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">282.</NOTE> To which he adds the mighty Aids and Encouragements to the per∣formance of our duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">284.</NOTE> 1. From the Assurance the Gospel gives of future Rewards and Punishments; and 2,<NOTE PLACE="marg">289.</NOTE> From the Promise of the Spirit of God to direct and assist us.</P>
<P>The Holy SCRIPTURES are every where mentioned by him with the greatest Reverence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prof. to Comment.</NOTE> He calls them the <HI>Holy Books,</HI> the <HI>Sacred Text, Holy Writ,</HI> and <HI>Divine Revelation</HI>; and exhorts Chri∣stians <HI>to betake themselves in earnest to the study of the way to Salvation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 24.</NOTE> <HI>in those Holy Wri∣tings, wherein God has reveal'd it from Heaven, and propos'd it to the World; seeking our Religion where we are sure it is in truth to be found, com∣comparing
<PB N="xvii" REF="17"/>
comparing Spiritual things with Spi∣ritual.</HI> And in a Letter written the year before his death, to one who had asked this Question,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Posth. Works,</HI> p. 344.</NOTE> <HI>What is the shortest and surest way, for a young Gentleman to attain to a true knowledge of the Christian Religion, in the full and just extent of it?</HI> his answer is, <HI>Let him study the</HI> Holy Scripture, <HI>especially the New Testament. Therein are contain'd the words of Eternal Life. It has God for its Author; Salvation for its End; and Truth, without any mixture of error, for its Matter.</HI> A direction, that was copied from his own practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Posth. Works,</HI> p. 20.</NOTE> in the <HI>latter</HI> part of his Life and after his Retire∣ment from business; when for <HI>four∣teen or fifteen years, he applied him∣self especially to the study of the Holy Scriptures, and employed the last years of his Life hardly in any thing else. He was never weary of admiring the great Views of that Sacred Book, and the just relation of all its parts. He
<PB N="xviii" REF="18"/>
every day made discoveries in it, that gave him fresh cause of Admira∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>Of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in particular, upon se∣veral of whose Epistles he drew up a most useful Commentary, he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comment.</HI> p. 16.</NOTE> <HI>That he was miraculous∣ly call'd to the Ministry of the Gospel, and declared to be a chosen Ves∣sel; — That he had the whole doctrine of the Gospel from God by immediate Revelation — That for his Informa∣tion in the Christian Knowledge, and the Mysteries and depths of the dispen∣sation of God by Jesus Christ, God him∣self had condescended to be his Instruc∣tor and Teacher — That he had re∣cev'd the light of the Gospel, from the fountain and father of Light himself</HI> —and, That an exact observation of his reasonings and inferences, is the only safe guide for the right under∣standing of him, <HI>under the spirit of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 17.</NOTE> <HI>that directed these Sacred Writings.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="19"/>And the <HI>death</HI> of this great man was agreeable to his life.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Posth. Works,</HI> p. 21.</NOTE> For we are inform'd by one who was with him when he dy'd, and had lived in the same family for seven years before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 20, 21.</NOTE> That the day before his death he particularly <HI>exhorted all about him to read the Holy Scriptures,</HI> That he desir'd <HI>to be remember'd by them at Evening Prayers, and being told, that if he would, the whole Family should come and pray by him in his Chamber, he answer'd, he should be very glad to have it so, if it would not give too much trou∣ble</HI>; That an occasion offering to speak of <HI>the</HI> Goodness <HI>of God, he especially ex∣alted the love which God shewed to man, in justifying him by Faith in Jesus Christ; and return'd God thanks in par∣ticular for having called him to the knowledge of that divine Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>About two months before his death he drew up a Letter to a cer∣tain<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Posth. Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks,</HI> p. 328.</NOTE> Gentleman (who afterwards distinguish'd himself by a very
<PB N="xx" REF="20"/>
different way of thinking and writing,) and left this direction upon it, <HI>To be deliver'd to him after my decease.</HI> In it, are these remarkable words, — <HI>This Life is a scene of Vanity that soon passes away, and affords no solid Satis∣faction, but in the consciousness of doing well, and in the hopes of another life. This is what I can say upon experience, and what you will find to be true, when you come to make up the account.</HI></P>
<P>Sir ISAAC NEWTON, universally acknowledged to be the ablest Philo∣sopher and Mathematician that this or perhaps any other Nation has produc'd, is also well known to have been a firm Believer, and a Serious Christian. His discoveries concerning the frame and System of the Universe, were apply'd by him, as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Enquiries into Nature had been, to demonstrate a∣gainst <HI>Atheists</HI> of all kinds, the Being of a God, and to illustrate his Power and Wisdom in the Creation of the World. Of which a better account
<PB N="xxi" REF="21"/>
cannot be given, than in the words of an ingenious Person who has been much conversant in his Philosophical Writings:<NOTE PLACE="marg">View of his Philosophy, <HI>p. 405.</HI></NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">At the end of his Mathematical Princi∣ples of Natural Philosophy, he has given us his thoughts concerning the Deity. Wherein he first observes, that the similitude found in all parts of the universe, makes it undoubted, that the whole is governed by one supreme Being, to whom the origi∣nal is owing of the frame of nature, which evidently is the effect of choice and design. He then pro∣ceeds briefly to state the best meta∣physical notions concerning God. In short, we cannot conceive either of Space or Time otherwise than as necessarily existing; this Being there∣fore, on whom all others depend, must certainly exist by the same ne∣cessity of nature. Consequently wherever space and time is found, there God must also be. And as it appears impossible to us, that space should be limited, or that time
<PB N="xxii" REF="22"/>
should have had a beginning, the Deity must be both immense and eternal.</Q></P>
<P>This great Man apply'd himself with the utmost attention to the study of the Holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and consider'd the several parts of them with an un∣common Exactness; particularly, as to the order of Time, and the series of Prophecies and Events relating to the Messiah. Upon which head, he has left behind him an elaborate Dis∣course, to prove that the famous Pro∣phecy of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Weeks, which has been so industriously perverted by the DEISTS of our times, was an express Prophecy of the coming of the Mes∣siah, and fulfill'd in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Mr. ADDISON, so deservedly cele∣brated for an uncommon accuracy in Thinking and Reasoning, has given abundant proof of his firm belief of Christianity and his Zeal against Infi∣dels of all kinds, in the Writings that are here publish'd; of which it is <HI>cer∣tainly</HI>
<PB N="xxiii" REF="23"/>
known, that a great part of them were his own Compositions.</P>
<P>I mention not these great Names, nor the Testimonies they have given of their firm belief of the Truth of Christianity, as if the Evidences of our Religion were to be finally resolv'd into human Authority, or try'd in any other way than by the known and establish'd Rules of right Reason; but my design in mentioning them, is</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew the very great <HI>Assurance</HI> of those who would make the belief of Revelation inconsistent with the due use of our Reason; when they have known so many eminent instances in our own time, of the greatest Masters of Reason not only believing Revela∣tion, but zealously concerned to <HI>esta∣blish</HI> and <HI>propagate</HI> the belief of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Remembrance of this will al∣so be a means, on one hand, to hinder well-meaning people from being <HI>mis∣led</HI> by the vain Boasts of our modern <HI>Pretenders</HI> to Reason; and, on the
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24"/>
other hand, to check the <HI>Inclination</HI> of the wicked and vicious to be mis∣led; when both of them have before their eyes such fresh and eminent In∣stances of sound Reasoning and a firm Faith, join'd together in one and the same mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. Further, as these were persons generally esteem'd for Virtue and Goodness, and, notwithstanding their high Attainments, remarkable for their Modesty and Humility; their Exam∣ples shew us, that a strong and clear Reason naturally leads to the belief of Revelation, when it is not under the Influences of Vice, or Pride.</P>
<P N="4">4. And, finally, as they are all <HI>Lay∣men,</HI> there is no room for the Ene∣mies of Reveal'd Religion to alledge, that they were prejudiced by Interest, or secular Considerations of any kind. A suggestion, that has really no weight, when urg'd against the writings of the <HI>Clergy</HI> in defence of Revelation, since they do not desire to be trusted upon their own Authority, but upon the
<PB N="xxv" REF="25"/>
Reasons they offer; and Lawyers and Physicians are not less trusted, because they <HI>live</HI> by their Professions; but it is a suggestion that easily takes hold of weak minds, and especially such as catch at objections, and are <HI>willing</HI> to be caught by them. And, consider∣ing the Diligence of the Adversary in making Proselytes and drawing Men from the Faith of Christ; equal di∣ligence is requir'd of those who are to maintain that Faith, not only to leave men no real <HI>ground,</HI> but even no <HI>colour</HI> or <HI>pretence,</HI> for their Infide∣lity.</P>
<P>The following Discourses, except that concerning the Evidences of the Christian Religion, were all published in separate Papers some years ago, and afterwards collected into Volumes, with marks of distinction at the end of ma∣ny of them, to point out the Writers, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s are there distinguish'd by some one of the Letters of the word CLIO; and the same marks of distin∣ction are here continued; as are also
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26"/>
the rest, where any Letter was found at the end of the Discourse.</P>
<P>In those Volumes, they stand ac∣cording to the order of time in which they were at first separately publish'd, without any Connexion as to the mat∣ters contain'd in them; but here, the several Discourses on the same Subject, which lie dispers'd in those Papers, are reduced to their proper Heads, and put into one view, that the whole may be more regularly read, and each head may leave a more lasting Impression upon the mind of the Reader.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> General division of the following discourse, with regard to <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI> Authors, who mention particulars relating to our Saviour.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Not probable that any such should be mentioned by <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers who lived at the same time, from the Nature of such transactions.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Especially when related by the <HI>Jews</HI>▪</P>

<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Besides that, no <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers of that age lived in <HI>Judaea</HI> or its Confines.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="2" REF="30"/><HI>VI.</HI> And because many books of that age are lost.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> An instance of one record proved to be authentick.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> A second record of probable, though not undoubted, authority.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT I may lay before you a full state of the sub∣ject under our considera∣tion, and methodize the several particulars that I touched upon in discourse with you; I shall first take notice of such <HI>Pagan</HI> Au∣thors as have given their testimony to the history of our Saviour; reduce these Au∣thors under their respective classes, and shew what authority their testimonies car∣ry with them. Secondly, I shall take no∣tice of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author did not live to write this second Part.</NOTE> <HI>Jewish</HI> Authors in the same light.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are many reasons, why you should not expect that matters of such a wonderful nature should be taken notice of by those eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, who were contemporaries with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or by those who lived before his Disciples had personally appeared among them, and as∣certained
<PB N="3" REF="31"/>
the report which had gone a∣broad concerning a life so full of miracles.</P>
<P>Supposing such things had happened at this day in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or among the <HI>Grisons,</HI> who make a greater figure in <HI>Europe</HI> than <HI>Judaea</HI> did in the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire, would they be immediately believed by those who live at a great distance from them? or would any certain ac∣count of them be transmitted into fo∣reign countries, within so short a space of time as that of our Saviour's publick ministry? Such kinds of news, though never so true, seldom gain credit, till some time after they are transacted and exposed to the examination of the cu∣rious, who by laying together circum∣stances, attestations, and characters of those who are concerned in them, either receive, or reject what at first none but eye-witnesses could absolutely believe or disbelieve. In a case of this sort, it was natural for men of sense and learning to treat the whole account as fabulous, or at farthest to suspend their belief of it, until all things stood together in their full light.</P>
<P N="3">III. Besides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were branded not only for superstitions different from all the religions of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, but
<PB N="4" REF="32"/>
in a particular manner ridiculed for be∣ing a credulous People; so that whatever reports of such a nature came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as false, frivolous, and improbable.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may further observe, that the ordinary practice of Magic in those times, with the many pretended Prodigies, Di∣vinations, Apparitions, and local Mira∣cles among the Heathens, made them less attentive to such news from <HI>Judaea,</HI> 'till they had time to consider the nature, the occasion, and the end of our Saviour's miracles, and were awakened by many surprizing events to allow them any con∣sideration at all.</P>
<P N="5">V. We are indeed told by St. <HI>Mat∣thew,</HI> that the fame of our Saviour, du∣ring his life, went throughout all <HI>Syria,</HI> and that there followed him great multi∣tudes of people from <HI>Galilee, Judaea, De∣capolis, Idumaea,</HI> from beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> and from <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> Now had there been any historians of those times and places, we might have expected to have seen in them some account of those wonderful transactions in <HI>Judaea</HI>; but there is not any single Author extant, in any kind, of that age, in any of those Countries.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="5" REF="33"/>VI. How many books have perished in which possibly there might have been mention of our Saviour? Look among the <HI>Romans,</HI> how few of their writings are come down to our times? In the space of two hundred years from our Saviour's birth, when there was such a multitude of writers in all kinds, how small is the number of Authors that have made their way to the present age?</P>
<P N="7">VII. One authentick Record, and that the most authentick heathen Record, we are pretty sure is lost. I mean the ac∣count sent by the Governor of <HI>Judaea,</HI> under whom our Saviour was judged, condemned, and crucified. It was the custom in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as it is to this day in all the governments of the world, for the praefects and vice-roys of distant provinces to transmit to their So∣veraign a summary relation of every thing remarkable in their administration. That <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> in his account, would have touched on so extraordinary an e∣vent in <HI>Judaea,</HI> is not to be doubted; and that he actually did, we learn from <HI>Ju∣stin Martyr,</HI> who lived about a hundred years after our Saviour's death, resided, made Converts, and suffered martyrdom
<PB N="6" REF="34"/>
at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was engaged with Philosophers, and in a particular manner with <HI>Crescens</HI> the <HI>Cynick,</HI> who could easi∣ly have detected, and would not fail to have exposed him, had he quoted a Re∣cord not in being, or made any false ci∣tation out of it. Would the great Apo∣logist have challenged <HI>Crescens</HI> to dispute the cause of Christianity with him be∣fore the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, had he forged such an evidence? or would <HI>Crescens</HI> have refused the challenge, could he have tri∣umphed over him in the detection of such a forgery? To which we must add, that the Apology, which appeals to this Re∣cord, was presented to a learned Empe∣ror, and to the whole body of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Senate. This Father in his apology, speaking of the death and suffering of our Saviour, refers the Emperor for the truth of what he says to the acts of <HI>Pon∣tius Pilate,</HI> which I have here mentioned. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who wrote his Apology about fifty years after <HI>Justin,</HI> doubtless referred to the same Record, when he tells the Governor of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> having received an account out of <HI>Palestine</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> of the Divine per∣son, who had appeared in that country,
<PB N="7" REF="35"/>
paid him a particular regard, and threat∣ned to punish any who should accuse the Christians; nay, that the Emperor would have adopted him among the Deities whom they worshipped, had not the Senate re∣fused to come into his proposal. <HI>Tertulli∣an,</HI> who gives us this history, was not only one of the most learned men of his age, but what adds a greater weight to his autho∣rity in this case, was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Nor can it be said, that <HI>Tertul∣lian</HI> grounded his quotation upon the au∣thority of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> because we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that Author. <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> mentions the same ancient Record, but as it was not extant in his time, I shall not insist upon his authority in this point. If it be objected that this parti∣cular is not mentioned in any <HI>Roman</HI> Hi∣storian, I shall use the same argument in a parallel case, and see whether it will carry any force with it. <HI>Ulpian</HI> the great <HI>Roman</HI> Lawyer gathered together all the Imperial Edicts that had been made a∣gainst the Christians. But did any one ever say that there had been no such E∣dicts, because they were not mentioned
<PB N="8" REF="36"/>
in the histories of those Emperors? Besides, who knows but this circumstance of <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI> was mention'd in other historians that have been lost, though not to be found in any still extant? Has not <HI>Suetonius</HI> many particulars of this Emperor omitted by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> many that are not so much as hinted at by either? As for the spurious <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pilate,</HI> now extant, we know the occasion and time of their wri∣ting, and had there not been a true and authentick Record of this nature, they would never have been forged.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The story of <HI>Agbarus</HI> King of <HI>Edessa,</HI> relating to the letter which he sent to our Saviour, and to that which he received from him, is a Record of great authority; and though I will not insist upon it, may venture to say, that had we such an evidence for any fact in <HI>Pagan</HI> history, an Author would be thought very unreasonable who should reject it. I believe you will be of my opinion, if you will peruse, with other Authors, who have appeared in vindica∣tion of these letters as genuine, the addi∣tional arguments which have been made use of by the late famous and learned Dr. <HI>Grabe,</HI> in the second volume of his <HI>Spi∣cilegium.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. WE now come to consider what undoubted authorities are ex∣tant among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers; and here we must premise, that some parts of our Saviour's history may be reasonably ex∣pected from <HI>Pagans.</HI> I mean such parts as might be known to those who lived at a distance from <HI>Judaea,</HI> as well as to those who were the followers and eye-witnesses of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="38"/>II. Such particulars are most of these which follow, and which are all attested by some one or other of those heathen Authors, who lived in or near the age of our Saviour and his disciples. <HI>That</HI> Augustus Caesar <HI>had ordered the whole em∣pire to be censed or taxed,</HI> which brought our Saviour's reputed parents to <HI>Bethle∣hem:</HI> This is mentioned by several <HI>Ro∣man</HI> historians, as <HI>Tacitus, Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Dion. That a great light, or a new star appeared in the east, which directed the wise men to our Saviour:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Chalcidius. That</HI> Herod, <HI>the King of</HI> Pa∣lestine, <HI>so often mentioned in the</HI> Roman <HI>history, made a great slaughter of innocent children,</HI> being so jealous of his succes∣sor, that he put to death his own sons on that account: This character of him is given by several historians, and this cruel fact mentioned by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a heathen Author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark or doubt upon it. <HI>That our Saviour had been in</HI> Egypt: This <HI>Celsus,</HI> though he raises a monstrous sto∣ry upon it, is so far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. <HI>That</HI> Pontius Pi∣late <HI>was Governor of</HI> Judaea, <HI>that our Sa∣viour
<PB N="11" REF="39"/>
was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Tacitus. That many miracu∣lous cures and works out of the ordinary course of nature were wrought by him:</HI> This is confessed by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, <HI>Por∣phyry,</HI> and <HI>Hierocles,</HI> all of them not only <HI>Pagans,</HI> but professed enemies and perse∣cutors of Christianity. <HI>That our Saviour foretold several things which came to pass according to his predictions:</HI> This was at∣tested by <HI>Phlegon</HI> in his annals, as we are assured by the learned <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Cel∣sus. That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkness and a great earthquake:</HI> This is recorded by the same <HI>Phlegon</HI> the <HI>Trallian,</HI> who was like∣wise a <HI>Pagan</HI> and Freeman to <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor. We may here observe, that a native of <HI>Trallium,</HI> which was not situate at so great a distance from <HI>Palestine,</HI> might very probably be informed of such remark∣able events as had passed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the age immediately preceding his own times, since several of his countrymen with whom he had conversed, might have re∣ceived a confused report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably liv∣ed within the Shake of the earthquake,
<PB N="12" REF="40"/>
and the Shadow of the eclipse, which are recorded by this Author. <HI>That</HI> Christ <HI>was worshipped as a God among the Christians; that they would rather suffer death than blaspheme him; that they received a sacra∣ment, and by it entered into a vow of ab∣staining from sin and wickedness,</HI> conform∣able to the advice given by St. <HI>Paul; that they had private assemblies of worship, and used to join together in Hymns:</HI> This is the account which <HI>Pliny</HI> the younger gives of Christianity in his days, about seventy years after the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> and which agrees in all its circumstances with the accounts we have in holy writ, of the first state of Christianity after the cruci∣fixion of our Blessed Saviour. <HI>That St.</HI> Pe∣ter, <HI>whose miracles are many of them re∣corded in holy writ, did many wonderful works,</HI> is owned by <HI>Julian</HI> the apostate, who therefore represents him as a great Magician, and one who had in his pos∣session a book of magical secrets left him by our Saviour. <HI>That the devils or evil spirits were subject to them,</HI> we may learn from <HI>Porphyry,</HI> who objects to Christi∣anity, that since <HI>Jesus</HI> had begun to be worshipped, <HI>Aesculapius</HI> and the rest of the gods did no more converse with men.
<PB N="13" REF="41"/>
Nay, <HI>Celsus</HI> himself affirms the same thing in effect, when he says, that the power which seemed to reside in Christians, proceeded from the use of certain names, and the invocation of certain daemons. <HI>Origen</HI> remarks on this passage, that the Author doubtless hints at those Christians who put to flight evil spirits, and healed those who were possessed with them; a fact which had been often seen, and which he himself had seen, as he declares in an∣other part of his discourse against <HI>Celsus.</HI> But at the same time he assures us, that this miraculous power was exerted by the use of no other name but that of <HI>Je∣sus,</HI> to which were added several passages in his history, but nothing like any invo∣cation to <HI>Daemons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Celsus</HI> was so hard set with the re∣port of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident attestations concerning him, that though he often intimates he did not believe them to be true, yet know∣ing he might be silenced in such an An∣swer, provides himself with another re∣treat, when beaten out of this; namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of so many thou∣sands at two different times with a few
<PB N="14" REF="42"/>
loaves and fishes, to the magical feasts of those <HI>Egyptian</HI> impostors, who would pre∣sent their spectators with visionary en∣tertainments that had in them neither substance nor reality: which, by the way, is to suppose, that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an ap∣parition, or strengthned and refreshed with shadows. He knew very well that there were so many witnesses and actors, if I may call them such, in these two mi∣racles, that it was impossible to refute such multitudes, who had doubtless suf∣ficiently spread the fame of them, and was therefore in this place forced to re∣sort to the other solution, that it was done by magic. It was not enough to say that a miracle which appeared to so many thousand eye-witnesses was a forgery of <HI>Christ</HI>'s disciples, and therefore suppo∣sing them to be eye-witnesses, he endea∣vours to shew how they might be de∣ceived.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The unconverted heathens, who were pressed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who had actual∣ly seen them, were driven to account for them after the same manner: For, to
<PB N="15" REF="43"/>
work by magic in the heathen way of speaking, was in the language of the <HI>Jews</HI> to cast out devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perverse interpretation on his mira∣cles, has branded the malignity of those men, who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts started such an unrea∣sonable objection, as a blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and declared not only the guilt, but the punishment of so black a crime. At the same time he conde∣scended to shew the vanity and emptiness of this objection against his miracles, by representing that they evidently tended to the destruction of those powers, to whose assistance the enemies of his do∣ctrine then ascribed them. An argu∣ment, which, if duly weighed, renders the objection so very frivolous and ground∣less, that we may venture to call it even blasphemy against common sense. Would Magic endeavour to draw off the minds of men from the worship which was paid to stocks and stones, to give them an abhorrence of those evil spirits who re∣joiced in the most cruel sacrifices, and in offerings of the greatest impurity;
<PB N="16" REF="44"/>
and in short to call upon mankind to ex∣ert their whole strength in the love and adoration of that one Being, from whom they derived their existence, and on whom only they were taught to depend every moment for the happiness and con∣tinuance of it? Was it the business of magic to humanize our natures with compassion, forgiveness, and all the in∣stances of the most extensive charity? Would evil spirits contribute to make men sober, chaste, and temperate, and in a word to produce that reformation, which was wrought in the moral world by those doctrines of our Saviour, that received their sanction from his Miracles? Nor is it possible to imagine, that evil spirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their cor∣respondence and intercourse with man∣kind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting themselves to those rites and ceremonies, which had done them so much honour. We see the early ef∣fect which Christianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that num∣ber of books, which were filled with the secrets of magic, and made a sacrifice to Christianity by the converts mentioned
<PB N="17" REF="45"/>
in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles. We have likewise an eminent instance of the incon∣sistency of our Religion with magic, in the history of the famous <HI>Aquila.</HI> This person, who was a kinsman of the Em∣peror <HI>Trajan,</HI> and likewise a man of great learning, notwithstanding he had embra∣ced Christianity, could not be brought off from the studies of magic, by the re∣peated admonitions of his fellow-christi∣ans: so that at length they expelled him their society, as rather chusing to lose the reputation of so considerable a Pro∣selyte, than communicate with one who dealt in such dark and infernal practices. Besides we may observe, that all the fa∣vourers of magic were the most profest and bitter enemies to the christian reli∣gion. Not to mention <HI>Simon Magus</HI> and many others, I shall only take notice of those two great persecutors of christiani∣ty, the Emperors <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, both of them initiated in the mysteries of divination, and skilled in all the depths of magic. I shall only add, that evil spirits cannot be supposed to have concurred in the establishment of a religion, which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they possest,
<PB N="18" REF="46"/>
and divested them of their influence on mankind; nor would I mention this par∣ticular, though it be unanimously re∣ported by all the ancient christian Au∣thors; did it not appear from the autho∣rities above-cited, that this was a fact confest by heathens themselves.</P>
<P N="5">V. We now see what a multitude of <HI>Pagan</HI> testimonies may be produced for all those remarkable passages, which might have been expected from them: and indeed of several, that, I believe, do more than answer your expectation, as they were not subjects in their own na∣ture so exposed to publick notoriety. It cannot be expected they should mention particulars, which were transacted a∣mongst the Disciples only, or among some few even of the Disciples them∣selves; such as the transfiguration, the agony in the garden, the appearance of <HI>Christ</HI> after his resurrection, and others of the like nature. It was impossible for a heathen Author to relate these things; because if he had believed them, he would no longer have been a heathen, and by that means his testimony would not have been thought of so much vali∣dity. Besides, his very report of facts so
<PB N="19" REF="47"/>
favourable to Christianity would have prompted men to say that he was pro∣bably tainted with their doctrine. We have a parallel case in <HI>Hecataeus,</HI> a famous <HI>Greek</HI> Historian, who had several passa∣ges in his book conformable to the hi∣story of the <HI>Jewish</HI> writers, which when quoted by <HI>Josephus,</HI> as a confirmation of the <HI>Jewish</HI> history, when his heathen ad∣versaries could give no other answer to it, they would need suppose that <HI>Heca∣taeus</HI> was a <HI>Jew</HI> in his heart, though they had no other reason for it, but because his history gave greater authority to the <HI>Jewish</HI> than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Records.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. TO this list of heathen writers, who make mention of our Sa∣viour, or touch upon any particulars of his life, I shall add those Authors who were at first Heathens, and afterwards converted to Christianity; upon which account, as I shall here shew, their te∣stimonies are to be looked upon as the more authentick. And in this list of evi∣dences, I shall confine myself to such learned <HI>Pagans</HI> as came over to Christi∣anity in the three first centuries, because those were the times in which men had the best means of informing themselves of the truth of our Saviour's history, and because among the great number of phi∣losophers who came in afterwards, under
<PB N="21" REF="49"/>
the reigns of christian Emperors, there might be several who did it partly out of worldly motives.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us now suppose, that a learn∣ed heathen writer who lived within six∣ty years of our Saviour's crucifixion, af∣ter having shewn that false miracles were generally wrought in obscurity, and be∣fore few or no witnesses, speaking of those which were wrought by our Sa∣viour, has the following passage.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">But his works were always seen, because they were true, they were seen by those who were healed, and by those who were raised from the dead. Nay these persons who were thus healed, and raised, were seen not only at the time of their being healed, and raised, but long afterwards. Nay they were seen not only all the while our Savi∣our was upon earth, but survived af∣ter his departure out of this world, nay some of them were living in our days.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. I dare say you would look upon this as a glorious attestation for the cause of Christianity, had it come from the hand of a famous <HI>Athenian</HI> Philosopher. These forementioned words however are
<PB N="22" REF="50"/>
actually the words of one who lived about sixty years after our Saviour's crucifixi∣on, and was a famous Philosopher in <HI>A∣thens:</HI> but it will be said, he was a con∣vert to Christianity. Now consider this matter impartially, and see if his testi∣mony is not much more valid for that reason. Had he continued a <HI>Pagan</HI> Phi∣losopher, would not the world have said that he was not sincere in what he writ, or did not believe it; for, if so, would not they have told us he would have em∣braced Christianity? This was indeed the case of this excellent man: he had so thoroughly examined the truth of our Sa∣viour's history, and the excellency of that religion which he taught, and was so entirely convinced of both, that he became a Proselyte, and died a Martyr.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Aristides</HI> was an <HI>Athenian</HI> Philoso∣pher, at the same time, famed for his learning and wisdom, but converted to Christianity. As it cannot be questioned that he perused and approved the apolo∣gy of <HI>Quadratus,</HI> in which is the passage just now cited, he joined with him in an apology of his own, to the same Em∣peror, on the same subject. This apolo∣gy, tho' now lost, was extant in the time
<PB N="23" REF="51"/>
of <HI>Ado Viennensis, A. D.</HI> 870, and highly esteemed by the most learned <HI>Athenians,</HI> as that Author witnesses. It must have contained great arguments for the truth of our Saviour's history, because in it he asserted the Divinity of our Saviour▪ which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do allow that, generally speak∣ing, a man is not so acceptable and un∣questioned an evidence in facts, which make for the advancement of his own party. But we must consider that, in the case before us, the persons, to whom we appeal, were of an opposite party, till they were persuaded of the truth of those very facts, which they report. They bear evidence to a history in de∣fence of Christianity, the truth of which history was their motive to embrace Christianity, They attest facts which they had heard while they were yet hea∣thens, and had they not found reason to believe them, they would still have con∣tinued heathens, and have made no men∣tion of them in their writings.</P>
<P N="6">VI. When a Man is born under chri∣stian Parents, and trained up in the pro∣fession of that religion from a child, he
<PB N="24" REF="52"/>
generally guides himself by the rules of <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in believing what is deli∣vered by the Evangelists; but the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of antiquity, before they became Christians, were only guided by the com∣mon rules of <HI>Historical Faith:</HI> That is, they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in common fame, tradition, and the writings of those persons who related them, together with the number, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of those persons; and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the same reason to believe the history of our Saviour, as that of any other person to which they themselves were not actually eye-witnesses, they were bound by all the rules of historical faith, and of right reason, to give credit to this history. This they did accord∣ingly, and in consequence of it published the same truths themselves, suffered ma∣ny afflictions, and very often death itself, in the assertion of them. When I say, that an historical belief of the acts of our Saviour induced these learned <HI>Pagans</HI> to embrace his doctrine, I do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his
<PB N="25" REF="53"/>
precepts, the fulfilling of prophecies, the miracles of his Disciples, the irreproach∣able lives and magnanimous sufferings of their followers, with other considera∣tions of the same nature: but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or less with Philosophers of that age, it is certain that a belief in the history of our Saviour was one motive with every new convert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very basis and foundation of Christianity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To this I must further add, that as we have already seen many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ, attested by particular <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors: the testimony of those I am now going to produce, extends to the whole histo∣ry of our Saviour, and to that continued series of actions, which are related of him and his Disciples in the books of the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. This evidently appears from their quotations out of the Evangelists, for the confirmation of any doctrine or account of our blessed Saviour. Nay a learned man of our nation, who examin∣ed the writings of our most ancient Fa∣thers in another view, refers to several
<PB N="26" REF="54"/>
passages in <HI>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Origen,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> by which he plainly shows that each of these early writers ascribe to the four Evangelists by name their respective histories; so that there is not the least room for doubting of their belief in the history of our Sa∣viour, as recorded in the Gospels. I shall only add, that three of the five Fa∣thers here mentioned, and probably four, were <HI>Pagans</HI> converted to Christianity, as they were all of them very inquisitive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philosophy.</P>

Of this sort we may reckon those three early converts to Christianity, who each of them was a member of a Senate famous for its wisdom and learning. <HI>Jo∣seph</HI> the <HI>Arimathean</HI> was of the <HI>Jewish Sanhedrim, Dionysius</HI> of the <HI>Athenian Are∣opagus,</HI> and <HI>Flavius Clemens</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate; nay at the time of his death Consul of <HI>Rome.</HI> These three were so thoroughly satisfied of the truth of the Christian religion, that the first of them, according to all the reports of antiquity, died a martyr for it; as did the second, unless we disbelieve <HI>Aristides,</HI> his fellow-citizen and contemporary; and the third, as we are informed both by <HI>Roman</HI> and Christian Authors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Among those innumerable multi∣tudes, who in most of the known nations of the world came over to Christianity at its first appearance, we may be sure there were great numbers of wise and learned men, beside those whose Names are in the Christian records, who with∣out doubt took care to examine the truth of our Saviour's history, before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers, for the sake of one that would not only cut
<PB N="29" REF="57"/>
them off from the allurements of this world, but subject them to every thing terrible or disagreeable in it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells the <HI>Roman</HI> Governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, senate, and courts of judicature were filled with Christians; as <HI>Arnobius</HI> asserts, that men of the finest parts and learning, Orators, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Lawyers, Physicians, Phi∣losophers, despising the sentiments they had been once fond of, took up their rest in the Christian religion.</P>
<P N="5">V. Who can imagine that men of this character did not thoroughly inform themselves of the history of that person, whose doctrines they embraced? for how∣ever consonant to reason his precepts appeared, how good soever were the ef∣fects which they produced in the world, nothing could have tempted men to ac∣knowledge him as their God and Savi∣our, but their being firmly persuaded of the miracles he wrought, and the ma∣ny attestations of his divine mission, which were to be met with in the histo∣ry of his life. This was the ground∣work of the Christian religion, and, if this failed, the whole superstructure sunk
<PB N="30" REF="58"/>
with it. This point therefore, of the truth of our Saviour's history, as recor∣ded by the Evangelists, is every where taken for granted in the writings of those, who from <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers be∣came Christian Authors, and who, by reason of their conversion, are to be looked upon as of the strongest collate∣ral testimony for the truth of what is delivered concerning our Saviour.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Besides innumerable Authors that are lost, we have the undoubted names, works, or fragments of several <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers, which shew them to have been as learned as any unconverted hea∣then Authors of the age in which they lived. If we look into the greatest nur∣series of learning in those ages of the world, we find in <HI>Athens, Dionysius, Qua∣dratus, Aristides, Athenagoras</HI>; and in <HI>A∣lexandria, Dionysius, Clemens, Ammonius,</HI> and <HI>Anatolius,</HI> to whom we may add <HI>Ori∣gen</HI>; for though his father was a Chri∣stian martyr, he became, without all controversy, the most learned and able Philosopher of his age, by his education at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in that famous seminary of arts and sciences.</P>

<P N="1">I. IT now therefore only remains to consider, whether these learned men had means and opportunities of inform∣ing themselves of the truth of our Sa∣viour's history; for unless this point can be made out, their testimonies will ap∣pear invalid, and their enquiries ineffe∣ctual.</P>
<P N="2">II. As to this point, we must consi∣der, that many thousands had seen the transactions of our Saviour in <HI>Judaea,</HI> and that many hundred thousands had receiv∣ed an account of them from the mouths of those who were actually eye-witnesses. I shall only mention among these eye-witnesses the twelve Apostles, to whom we must add St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had a parti∣cular call to this high office, though ma∣ny
<PB N="33" REF="61"/>
other disciples and followers of <HI>Christ</HI> had also their share in the publish∣ing this wonderful history. We learn from the ancient records of Christianity, that many of the Apostles and Disciples made it the express business of their lives, travelled into the remotest parts of the world, and in all places gathered multi∣tudes about them, to acquaint them with the history and doctrines of their cruci∣fied Master. And indeed, were all Chri∣stian records of these proceedings entire∣ly lost, as many have been, the effect plainly evinces the truth of them; for how else during the Apostles lives could Christianity have spread itself with such an amazing progress through the several nations of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire? how could it fly like lightning, and carry conviction with it, from one end of the earth to the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r?</P>
<P N="3">III. Heathens therefore of every age, sex, and quality, born in the most diffe∣rent climates, and bred up under the most different institutions, when they saw men of plain sense, without the help of learn∣ing, armed with patience and courage, instead of wealth, pomp, or power, ex∣pressing in their lives those excellent do∣ctrines
<PB N="34" REF="62"/>
of Morality, which they taught as delivered to them from our Saviour, averring that they had seen his miracles during his life, and conversed with him after his death; when, I say, they saw no suspicion of falshood, treachery, or worldly interest, in their behaviour and conversation, and that they submitted to the most ignominious and cruel deaths, rather than retract their testimony, or even be silent in matters which they were to publish by their Saviour's espe∣cial command, there was no reason to doubt of the veracity of those facts which they related, or of the Divine Mission in which they were employed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But even these motives to Faith in our Saviour would not have been suf∣ficient to have brought about in so few years such an incredible number of con∣versions, had not the Apostles been able to exhibit still greater proofs of the truths which they taught. A few per∣sons of an odious and despised country could not have filled the world with Be∣lievers, had they not shown undoubted credentials from the Divine person who sent them on such a message. According∣ly we are assured, that they were inve∣sted
<PB N="35" REF="63"/>
with the power of working mira∣cles, which was the most short and the most convincing argument that could be produced, and the only one that was adapted to the reason of all mankind, to the capacities of the wise and ignorant, and could overcome every cavil and eve∣ry prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the sick, and raised the dead, when it was published by those who themselves often did the same miracles, in their presence, and in his name! Could any reasonable person imagine, that God Almighty would arm men with such powers to authorize a lye, and establish a religion in the world which was displeasing to him, or that evil spirits would lend them such an ef∣fectual assistance to beat down vice and idolatry?</P>
<P N="5">V. When the Apostles had formed many assemblies in several parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, who gave credit to the glad tidings of the Gospel, that, upon their departure, the memory of what they had related might not perish, they ap∣pointed out of these new converts, men of the best sense, and of the most unble∣mished lives, to preside over these seve∣ral
<PB N="36" REF="64"/>
assemblies, and to inculcate without ceasing what they had heard from the mouths of these eye-witnesses.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Upon the death of any of those substitutes to the Apostles and Disciples of <HI>Christ,</HI> his place was filled up with some other person of eminence for his piety and learning, and generally a mem∣ber of the same Church, who after his decease was followed by another in the same manner, by which means the suc∣cession was continued in an uninterrupt∣ed line. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> informs us, that every church preserved a catalogue of its Bi∣shops in the order that they succeeded one another, and (for an example) produces the catalogue of those who governed the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in that character, which contains eight or nine persons, though but at a very small remove from the times of the Apostles.</P>
<P>Indeed the lists of Bishops, which are come down to us in other churches, are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect. But the succession was quick in the three first centuries, be∣cause the Bishop very often ended in the Martyr: for when a persecution arose in any place, the first fury of it fell upon
<PB N="37" REF="65"/>
this Order of holy men, who abundant∣ly testified by their Deaths and Suffer∣ings that they did not undertake these offices out of any temporal views, that they were sincere and satisfied in the be∣lief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhered to what they had received from the Apostles, as laying down their lives in the same hope, and upon the same principles. None can be supposed so utterly regardless of their own happi∣ness as to expire in torment, and hazard their Eternity, to support any fables and inventions of their own, or any forgeries of their predecessors who had presided in the same church, and which might have been easily detected by the tradition of that particular church, as well as by the concurring testimony of others. To this purpose, I think it is very remarkable, that there was not a single Martyr among those many Hereticks, who disagreed with the Apostolical church, and intro∣duced several wild and absurd notions into the doctrines of Christianity. They durst not stake their present and future happiness on their own chimerical ope∣rations, and did not only shun persecu∣tion, but affirmed that it was unnecessa∣ry
<PB N="38" REF="66"/>
for their followers to bear their reli∣gion through such fiery tryals.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We may fairly reckon, that this first age of Apostles and Disciples, with that second generation of many who were their immediate converts, extended it self to the middle of the second Cen∣tury, and that several of the third gene∣ration from these last mentioned, which was but the fifth from <HI>Christ,</HI> continued to the end of the third Century. Did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church, which was planted by the Apostles, I doubt not but in most of them there might be found five persons who in a continued series would reach through these three centuries of years, that is till the 265th from the death of our Sa∣viour.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Among the accounts of those very few out of innumerable multitudes, who had embraced Christianity, I shall single out four persons eminent for their lives, their writings, and their sufferings, that were successively contemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. <HI>John,</HI> who was the beloved Disciple, and conversed the
<PB N="39" REF="67"/>
most intimately with our Saviour, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 100. <HI>Polycarp,</HI> who was the Disciple of St. <HI>John,</HI> and had con∣versed with others of the Apostles and Disciples of our Lord, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 167, though his life was shortened by martyrdom. <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> who was the Disciple of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> and had conversed with many of the immediate Disciples of the Apostles, lived, at the lowest com∣putation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewise cut off by martyr∣dom; in which year the great <HI>Origen</HI> was appointed Regent of the Catechetick school in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and as he was the miracle of that age, for industry, learn∣ing, and philosophy, he was looked upon as the champion of Christianity, till the year 254, when, if he did not suffer martyrdom, as some think he did, he was certainly actuated by the spirit of it, as appears in the whole course of his life and writings; nay, he had often been put to the torture, and had undergone tryals worse than death. As he conver∣sed with the most eminent Christians of his time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the East, brought over multitudes both from heresy and heathenism, and left behind him several
<PB N="40" REF="68"/>
Disciples of great fame and learning, there is no question but there were con∣siderable numbers of those who knew him, and had been his hearers, scholars, or proselytes, that lived till the end of the third century, and to the reign of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is evident to those, who read the lives and writings of <HI>Polycarp, Ire∣naeus,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> that these three Fathers believed the accounts which are given of our Saviour in the four Evangelists, and had undoubted arguments that not only St. <HI>John,</HI> but many others of our Sa∣viour's disciples, published the same ac∣counts of him. To which we must sub∣join this further remark, that what was believed by these Fathers on this subject, was likewise the belief of the main body of Christians in those successive ages when they flourished; since <HI>Polycarp</HI> cannot but be looked upon, if we consider the re∣spect that was paid him, as the represen∣tative of the Eastern Churches in this particular, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> of the Western upon the same account, and <HI>Origen</HI> of those established in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. To these I might add <HI>Paul</HI> the fa∣mous hermite, who retired from the <HI>De∣cian</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="69"/>
persecution five or six years before <HI>Origen</HI>'s death, and lived till the year 343. I have only discovered one of those chan∣nels by which the history of our Saviour might be conveyed pure and unadultera∣ted, through those several ages that pro∣duced those <HI>Pagan</HI> Philosophers, whose testimonies I make use of for the truth of our Saviour's history. Some or other of these Philosophers came into the Chri∣stian faith during its infancy, in the se∣veral periods of these three first centu∣ries, when they had such means of in∣forming themselves in all the particulars of our Saviour's history. I must further add, that though I have here only cho∣sen this single link of martyrs, I might find out others among those names which are still extant, that delivered down this account of our Saviour in a successive tra∣dition, till the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire be∣came Christian; as there is no question but numberless series of witnesses might follow one another in the same order, and in as short a chain, and that perhaps in every single Church, had the names and ages of the most eminent primitive Christians been transmitted to us with the like certainty.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="42" REF="70"/>XI. But to give this consideration more force, we must take notice, that the tradition of the first ages of Christi∣anity had several circumstances peculiar to it, which made it more authentick than any other tradition in any other age of the world. The Christians, who carried their religion through so ma∣ny general and particular persecutions, were incessantly comforting and sup∣porting one another, with the exam∣ple and history of our Saviour and his Apostles. It was the subject not only of their solemn assemblies, but of their pri∣vate visits and conversations. <HI>Our vir∣gins,</HI> says <HI>Tatian,</HI> who lived in the second century, <HI>discourse over their distaffs on di∣vine subjects.</HI> Indeed, when religion was woven into the civil government, and flourished under the protection of the Emperors, men's thoughts and discour∣ses were, as they are now, full of secu∣lar affairs; but in the three first centu∣ries of Christianity, men, who embraced this religion, had given up all their in∣terests in this world, and lived in a per∣petual preparation for the next, as not knowing how soon they might be called to it: so that they had little else to talk
<PB N="43" REF="71"/>
of but the life and doctrines of that di∣vine person, which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory. We cannot therefore imagine, that there was a single person arrived at any degree of age or consideration, who had not heard and repeated above a thousand times in his life, all the particulars of our Sa∣viour's birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Especially if we consider, that they could not then be received as Chri∣stians, till they had undergone several ex∣aminations. Persons of riper years, who flocked daily into the Church during the three first centuries, were obliged to pass through many repeated instructions, and give a strict account of their proficien∣cy, before they were admitted to Bap∣tism. And as for those who were born of Christian parents, and had been bap∣tised in their infancy, they were with the like care prepared and disciplined for confirmation, which they could not ar∣rive at, till they were found upon exa∣mination to have made a sufficient pro∣gress in the knowledge of Christianity.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. We must further observe, that there was not only in those times this re∣ligious
<PB N="44" REF="72"/>
conversation among private Chri∣stians, but a constant correspondence be∣tween the Churches that were establish∣ed by the Apostles or their successors, in the several parts of the world. If any new doctrine was started, or any fact re∣ported of our Saviour, a strict enquiry was made among the Churches, especi∣ally those planted by the Apostles them∣selves, whether they had received any such doctrine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the Apostles, or the tradition of those Christians, who had preceded the present members of the Churches which were thus consulted. By this means, when any novelty was published, it was immediately detected and censured.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. St. <HI>John,</HI> who lived so many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in these emergencies as the living Ora∣cle of the Church; and as his oral testi∣mony lasted the first century, many have observed that, by a particular providence of God, several of our Saviour's Disci∣ples, and of the early converts of his re∣ligion, lived to a very great age, that they might personally convey the truth of the Gospel to those times, which were
<PB N="45" REF="73"/>
very remote from the first publication of it. Of these, besides St. <HI>John,</HI> we have a remarkable instance in <HI>Simeon,</HI> who was one of the Seventy sent forth by our Saviour, to publish the Gospel before his crucifixion, and a near kins∣man of the Lord. This venerable per∣son, who had probably heard with his own ears our Saviour's prophecy of the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> presided over the Church established in that city, du∣ring the time of its memorable siege, and drew his congregation out of those dreadful and unparallel'd calamities which befel his countrymen, by following the advice our Saviour had given, when they should see <HI>Jerusalem</HI> encompassed with armies, and the <HI>Roman</HI> standards, or abo∣mination of desolation, set up. He liv∣ed till the year of our Lord 107, when he was martyred under the Emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI></P>

<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> Instances of such records.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THUS far we see how the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> might apprize themselves from oral information of the particulars
<PB N="47" REF="75"/>
of our Saviour's history. They could hear, in every Church planted in every distant part of the earth, the account which was there received and preserved among them, of the history of our Sa∣viour. They could learn the names and characters of those first missionaries that brought to them these accounts, and the miracles by which God Almighty atte∣sted their reports. But the Apostles and Disciples of <HI>Christ,</HI> to preserve the histo∣ry of his life, and to secure their ac∣counts of him from error and oblivion, did not only set aside certain persons for that purpose, as has been already shewn, but appropriated certain days to the commemoration of those facts which they had related concerning him. The first day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his resurrection, as the devotional exercises adapted to <HI>Fri∣day</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of those days, and that he rested in the grave on the other. You may apply the same re∣mark to several of the annual festivals instituted by the Apostles themselves, or at furthest by their immediate successors, in memory of the most important parti∣culars
<PB N="48" REF="76"/>
in our Saviour's history; to which we must add the Sacraments instituted by our Lord himself, and many of those rites and ceremonies which obtained in the most early times of the Church. These are to be regarded as standing marks of such facts as were delivered by those, who were eye-witnesses to them, and which were contrived with great wisdom to last till time should be no more. These, without any other means, might have, in some measure, conveyed to posterity, the memory of several transactions in the history of our Saviour, as they were re∣lated by his Disciples. At least, the rea∣son of these institutions, though they might be forgotten, and obscured by a long course of years, could not but be very well known by those who lived in the three first centuries, and a means of informing the inquisitive <HI>Pagans</HI> in the truth of our Saviour's history, that be∣ing the view in which I am to consider them.</P>
<P N="2">II. But lest such a tradition, though guarded by so many expedients, should wear out by the length of time, the four Evangelists within about fifty, or, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> affirms, thirty years, after our
<PB N="49" REF="77"/>
Saviour's death, while the memory of his actions was fresh among them, consigned to writing that history, which for some years had been published only by the mouths of the Apostles and Disciples. The further consideration of these holy penmen will fall under another part of this discourse.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will be sufficient to observe here, that in the age which succeeded the Apostles, many of their immediate Disciples sent or carried in person the books of the four Evangelists, which had been written by Apostles, or at least ap∣proved by them, to most of the Churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world. This was done with so much diligence, that when <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> a man of great learning and piety, had travelled into <HI>India</HI> for the propagation of Christianity, about the year of our Lord 200, he found among that remote peo∣ple the Gospel of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> which upon his return from that country he brought with him to <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Gospel is generally supposed to have been left in those parts by St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> who probably car∣ried it with him before the writings
<PB N="50" REF="78"/>
of the three other Evangelists were pub∣lish'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the history of our Saviour, as recorded by the Evangelists, was the same with that which had been before delivered by the Apostles and Disciples, will further appear in the prosecution of this discourse, and may be gathered from the following considerations.</P>
<P N="5">V. Had these writings differed from the sermons of the first planters of Chri∣stianity, either in history or doctrine, there is no question but they would have been rejected by those Churches which they had already formed. But so consi∣stent and uniform was the relation of the Apostles, that these histories appeared to be nothing else but their tradition and oral attestations made fixt and perma∣nent. Thus was the fame of our Saviour, which in so few years had gone through the whole earth, confirmed and perpe∣tuated by such records, as would preserve the traditionary account of him to after∣ages; and rectify it, if at any time, by passing through several generations, it might drop any part that was material, or contract any thing that was false or fictitious.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="51" REF="79"/>VI. Accordingly we find the same <HI>Je∣sus Christ,</HI> who was born of a Virgin, who had wrought many miracles in <HI>Pa∣lestine,</HI> who was crucified, rose again, and ascended into Heaven; I say, the same <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> had been preached, and was worshipped, in <HI>Germany, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in <HI>Parthia, Media, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Asia</HI> and <HI>Pamphilia,</HI> in <HI>Italy, Egypt, Afric,</HI> and beyond <HI>Cyrene, India</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> and, in short, in all the islands and provinces that are visited by the rising or setting sun. The same account of our Saviour's life and doctrine was delivered by thou∣sands of Preachers, and believed in thou∣sands of places, who all, as fast as it could be conveyed to them, received the same ac∣count in writing from the four Evangelists.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to this purpose very apt∣ly remarks, that those barbarous nations, who in his time were not possest of the written gospels, and had only learned the history of our Saviour from those who had converted them to Christianity before the Gospels were written, had a∣mong them the same accounts of our Sa∣viour, which are to be met with in the four Evangelists. An uncontestable proof
<PB N="52" REF="80"/>
of the harmony and concurrence between the holy scripture and the tradition of the Churches in those early times of Christianity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Thus we see what opportuni∣ties the learned and inquisitive heathens had of informing themselves of the truth of our Saviour's history, during the three first Centuries, especially as they lay near∣er one than another to the fountain∣head: beside which, there were many un∣controverted traditions, records of Chri∣stianity, and particular histories, that then threw light into these matters, but are now entirely lost, by which, at that time, any appearance of contradiction, or seeming difficulties, in the history of the Evangelists, were fully cleared up and explained: though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the history of our Saviour, as related by the four Evangelists, than in the accounts of any other person, published by such a number of different historians who lived at so great a distance from the present age.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Among those records which are lost, and were of great use to the primi∣tive Christians, is the letter to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> which I have already mentioned; that
<PB N="53" REF="81"/>
of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> which I shall take notice of hereafter; the writings of <HI>He∣gesippus,</HI> who had drawn down the histo∣ry of Christianity to his own time, which was not beyond the middle of the second Century; the genuine <HI>Sibylline</HI> oracles, which in the first ages of the Church were easily distinguished from the spu∣rious; the records preserved in particu∣lar Churches, with many other of the same nature.</P>

THERE were other means, which I find had a great influence on the learned of the three first Centuries, to create and confirm in them the belief of our blessed Saviour's history, which ought not to be passed over in silence. The first was, the opportunity they enjoyed of examining those miracles, which were on several occasions performed by Chri∣stians, and appeared in the Church, more or less, during these first ages of Chri∣stianity. These had great weight with the men I am now speaking of, who, from learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> became fathers of the Church; for they frequently boast of them in their writings, as attestations given by God himself to the truth of their religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. At the same time, that these learn∣ed men declare how disingenuous, base and wicked it would be, how much be∣neath the dignity of Philosophy, and con∣trary to the precepts of Christianity, to utter falshoods or forgeries in the sup∣port of a cause, though never so just in it self, they confidently assert this mira∣culous power, which then subsisted in the Church, nay tell us that they them∣selves
<PB N="55" REF="83"/>
had been eye-witnesses of it at se∣veral times, and in several instances; nay appeal to the heathens themselves for the truth of several facts they re∣late, nay challenge them to be present at their assemblies, and satisfy them∣selves, if they doubt of it; nay we find that <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors have in some instan∣ces confessed this miraculous power.</P>
<P N="3">III. The letter of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> whose army was preserved by a refresh∣ing shower, at the same time that his enemies were discomfited by a storm of lightning, and which the heathen histo∣rians themselves allow to have been su∣pernatural and the effect of magic: I say, this letter, which ascribed this unexpe∣cted assistance to the prayers of the Chri∣stians, who then served in the army, would have been thought an unquestion∣able testimony of the miraculous power I am speaking of, had it been still pre∣served. It is sufficient for me in this place to take notice, that this was one of those miracles which had its influence on the learned Converts, because it is related by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and the very letter appealed to. When these learned men saw sickness and frenzy cured, the dead raised, the ora∣cles
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
put to silence, the <HI>Daemons</HI> and evil spirits forced to confess themselves no Gods, by persons who only made use of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified Saviour; how could they doubt of their Saviour's power on the like occasions, as represented to them by the traditions of the Church, and the writings of the Evangelists?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Under this head, I cannot omit that which appears to me a standing mi∣racle in the three first Centuries, I mean that amazing and supernatural courage or patience, which was shewn by innu∣merable multitudes of Martyrs, in those slow and painful torments that were in∣flicted on them. I cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at <HI>Lyons,</HI> amid the insults and mockeries of a crouded Amphitheatre, and still keeping his seat; or stretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his soul among the exqui∣site sufferings of such a tedious execu∣tion, rather than renounce his religion, or blaspheme his Saviour. Such tryals seem to me above the strength of human nature, and able to over-bear duty, rea∣son, faith, conviction, nay, and the most
<PB N="57" REF="85"/>
absolute certainty of a future state. Hu∣manity, unassisted in an extraordinary manner, must have shaken off the pre∣sent pressure, and have delivered it self out of such a dreadful distress, by any means that could have been suggested to it. We can easily imagine, that many persons, in so good a cause, might have laid down their lives at the gibbet, the stake, or the block: but to expire lei∣surely among the most exquisite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental reservation, or an hy∣pocrisy which was not without a possibi∣lity of being followed by repentance and forgiveness, has something in it, so far beyond the force and natural strength of mortals, that one cannot but think there was some miraculous power to support the sufferer.</P>
<P N="5">V. We find the Church of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in that admirable letter which gives an ac∣count of the death of <HI>Polycarp</HI> their be∣loved Bishop, mentioning the cruel tor∣ments of other early Martyrs for Christi∣anity, are of opinion, that our Saviour stood by them in a vision, and personal∣ly conversed with them, to give them strength and comfort during the bitter∣ness
<PB N="58" REF="86"/>
of their long-continued agonies; and we have the story of a young man, who, having suffered many tortures, esca∣ped with life, and told his fellow-chri∣stians, that the pain of them had been rendred tolerable, by the presence of an Angel who stood by him, and wiped off the tears and sweat, which ran down his face whilst he lay under his sufferings. We are assured at least that the first Martyr for Christianity was encouraged in his last moments, by a vision of that divine person, for whom he suffered, and into whose presence he was then hasten∣ing.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart, and after reading these terrible conflicts in which the ancient Martyrs and Confessors were engaged, when they passed through such new in∣ventions and varieties of pain, as tired their tormentors; and ask himself, however zealous and sincere he is in his religion, whether under such acute and lingring tortures he could still have held fast his integrity, and have professed his faith to the last, without a supernatural assistance of some kind or other. For my part, when I consider that it was not an unac∣countable
<PB N="59" REF="87"/>
obstinacy in a single man, or in any particular sett of men, in some ex∣traordinary juncture; but that there were multitudes of each sex, of every age, of different countries and conditions, who for near 300 years together made this glorious confession of their faith, in the midst of tortures, and in the hour of death▪ I must conclude, that they were either of another make than men are at present, or that they had such miracu∣lous supports as were peculiar to those times of Christianity, when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extinguished.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is certain, that the deaths and sufferings of the primitive Christians had a great share in the conversion of those learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> who lived in the ages of Persecution, which with some intervals and abatements lasted near 300 years af∣ter our Saviour. <HI>Justin Martyr, Tertul∣lian, Lactantius, Arnobius,</HI> and others, tell us, that this first of all alarmed their cu∣riosity, roused their attention, and made them seriously inquisitive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with so much strength and over∣come the fear of death, nay raise an ear∣nest
<PB N="60" REF="88"/>
desire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of those Philosophers, whom they had thorough∣ly studied, and who had been labouring at this great point. The sight of these dying and tormented Martyrs engaged them to search into the history and do∣ctrines of him for whom they suffered. The more they searched, the more they were convinced; till their conviction grew so strong, that they themselves embraced the same truths, and either actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readiness to do it, rather than depart from them.</P>

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> These arguments strengthened by what has happened since <HI>Origen</HI>'s time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE second of those extraordinary means, of great use to the learn∣ed and inquisitive <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three first Centuries, for evincing the truth of the history of our Saviour, was the com∣pletion of such prophecies as are record∣ed of him in the Evangelists. They could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold, and was fulfilled du∣ring his life, because both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were published by the Evangelists; though, as <HI>Origen</HI> observes, what end could there be in forging some of these predictions, as that of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s deny∣ing his master, and all his Disciples for∣saking him in the greatest extremity, which reflects so much shame on the great Apostle, and on all his companions? Nothing but a strict adherence to truth,
<PB N="62" REF="90"/>
and to matters of fact, could have prompted the Evangelists to relate a cir∣cumstance so disadvantageous to their own reputation; as that Father has well observed.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to pursue his reflections on this subject. There are predictions of our Sa∣viour recorded by the Evangelists, which were not completed till after their deaths, and had no likelihood of being so, when they were pronounced by our blessed Sa∣viour. Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they should be brought before Governors and Kings for his sake, for a testimony against them and the <HI>Gen∣tiles, Mat.</HI> x.28. with the other like prophecies, by which he foretold that his Disciples were to be persecuted. Is there any other doctrine in the world, says this Father, whose followers are punished? Can the enemies of <HI>Christ</HI> say, that he knew his opinions were false and impious, and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretel what would be the treatment of those persons who should embrace them? Supposing his do∣ctrines were really such, why should this be the consequence? what likelihood that men should be brought before Kings
<PB N="63" REF="91"/>
and Governors for opinions and tenets of any kind, when this never happened even to the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> who absolutely denied a Providence; nor to the <HI>Peri∣pateticks</HI> themselves, who laughed at the prayers and sacrifices which were made to the Divinity? Are there any but the Christians who, according to this pre∣diction of our Saviour, being brought before Kings and Governors for his sake, are pressed to their latest gasp of breath, by their respective judges, to renounce Christianity, and to procure their liber∣ty and rest, by offering the same sacri∣fices, and taking the same oaths that o∣thers did?</P>
<P N="3">III Consider the time when our Sa∣viour pronounced those words, Mat. x. 32. <HI>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven: but whosoever shall de∣ny me before men, him will I also deny be∣fore my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Had you heard him speak after this manner, when as yet his Disciples were under no such tryals, you would certainly have said within your self, If these speeches of <HI>Jesus</HI> are true, and if, according to his prediction, Governors and Kings un∣dertake
<PB N="64" REF="92"/>
to ruin and destroy those who shall profess themselves his Disciples, we will believe (not only that he is a Pro∣phet) but that he has received power from God sufficient to preserve and pro∣pagate his religion; and that he would never talk in such a peremptory and dis∣couraging manner, were he not assured that he was able to subdue the most pow∣erful opposition, that could be made a∣gainst the faith and doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Who is not struck with admira∣tion, when he represents to himself our Saviour at that time foretelling, that his Gospel should be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, or as <HI>Origen</HI> (who rather quotes the sense than the words) to serve for a convi∣ction to Kings and people, when at the same time he finds that his Gospel has accordingly been preached to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to the learned and to the ig∣norant, and that there is no quality or condition of life able to exempt men from submitting to the doctrine of <HI>Christ?</HI> As for us, says this great Author, in an∣other part of his book against <HI>Celsus,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">When we see every day those events
<PB N="65" REF="93"/>
exactly accomplished which our Sa∣viour foretold at so great a distance: That his Gospel is preached in all the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiv.14. That his Disci∣ples go and teach all nations, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii.19. And that those, who have received his doctrine, are brought for his sake before Governors, and before Kings, <HI>Mat.</HI> x.18. we are filled with admiration, and our faith in him is confirmed more and more. What clearer and stronger proofs can <HI>Celsus</HI> ask for the truth of what he spoke?</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Origen</HI> insists likewise with great strength on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour, concerning the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> pronounced at a time, as he observes, when there was no likeli∣hood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by so many others, that I shall refer you to what this Father has said on the subject in the first book against <HI>Celsus.</HI> And as to the accomplishment of this remark∣able prophecy, shall only observe, that whoever reads the account given us by <HI>Josephus,</HI> without knowing his character, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the historian had
<PB N="66" REF="94"/>
been a Christian, and that he had no∣thing else in view but to adjust the event to the prediction.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I cannot quit this head without taking notice, that <HI>Origen</HI> would still have triumphed more in the foregoing argu∣ments, had he lived an age longer, to have seen the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and all their Governors and provinces, submit∣ting themselves to the Christian religion, and glorying in its profession, as so ma∣ny Kings and Soveraigns still place their relation to <HI>Christ</HI> at the head of their titles.</P>
<P>How much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received, had he seen our Saviour's prophecy stand good in the destruction of the temple, and the dissolution of the <HI>Jewish</HI> oecono∣my, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> united all their endeavours under <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo∣state, to baffle and falsify the prediction? The great preparations that were made for re-building the temple, with the hur∣ricane, earthquake, and eruptions of fire, that destroyed the work, and terrified those employed in the attempt from pro∣ceeding in it, are related by many histo∣rians of the same age, and the substance of the story testified both by <HI>Pagan</HI> and
<PB N="67" REF="95"/>
<HI>Jewish</HI> writers, as <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> and <HI>Zemath-David.</HI> The learned <HI>Chry∣sostome,</HI> in a sermon against the <HI>Jews,</HI> tells them this fact was then fresh in the memories even of their young men, that it happened but twenty years ago, and that it was attested by all the inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where they might still see the marks of it in the rubbish of that work, from which the <HI>Jews</HI> desisted in so great a fright, and which even <HI>Julian</HI> had not the courage to carry on. This fact, which is in it self so miraculous, and so indisputable, brought over many of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Christianity; and shows us, that after our Saviour's prophecy a∣gainst it, the temple could not be pre∣served from the plough passing over it, by all the care of <HI>Titus,</HI> who would fain have prevented its destruction, and that instead of being re-edified by <HI>Julian,</HI> all his endeavours towards it did but still more literally accomplish our Saviour's prediction, that not one stone should be left upon another.</P>
<P>The ancient Christians were so entire∣ly persuaded of the force of our Saviour's prophecies, and of the punishment which the <HI>Jews</HI> had drawn upon themselves,
<PB N="68" REF="96"/>
and upon their children, for the treat∣ment which the <HI>Messiah</HI> had received at their hands, that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and dispersed people, an hissing and an astonishment among the nations, as they are to this day. In short, that they had lost their peculiarity of being God's peo∣ple, which was now transferred to the body of Christians, and which preserved the Church of <HI>Christ</HI> among all the con∣flicts, difficulties and persecutions, in which it was engaged, as it had pre∣served the <HI>Jewish</HI> government and oeco∣nomy for so many ages, whilst it had the same truth and vital principle in it, not∣withstanding it was so frequently in dan∣ger of being utterly abolished and de∣stroyed, <HI>Origen,</HI> in his fourth book a∣gainst <HI>Celsus,</HI> mentioning their being cast out of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the place to which their worship was annexed, deprived of their temple and sacrifice, their religious rites and solemnities, and scattered over the face of the earth, ventures to assure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-established, since they had committed that horrid crime against the Saviour of the world. This was a
<PB N="69" REF="97"/>
bold assertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been so won∣derfully re-established in former times, when they were almost swallowed up, and in the most desperate state of desola∣tion, as in their deliverance out of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity, and the oppressions of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes.</HI> Nay, he knew that within less than a hundred years be∣fore his own time, the <HI>Jews</HI> had made such a powerful effort for their re-esta∣blishment under <HI>Barchocab,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Adrian,</HI> as shook the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire. But he founded his opinion on a sure word of prophecy, and on the pu∣nishment they had so justly incurred; and we find, by a long experience of 1500 years, that he was not mistaken, nay that his opinion gathers strength daily, since the <HI>Jews</HI> are now at a greater distance from any probability of such a re-establishment, than they were when <HI>Origen</HI> wrote.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THERE was one other mean en∣joyed by the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three first centuries, for satisfying them in the truth of our Saviour's histo∣ry, which I might have flung under one of the foregoing heads; but as it is so shining a particular, and does so much honour to our religion, I shall make a distinct article of it, and only consider it with regard to the subject I am upon:
<PB N="71" REF="99"/>
I mean the lives and manners of those holy men, who believed in <HI>Christ</HI> during the first ages of Christianity. I should be thought to advance a paradox, should I affirm that there were More Christians in the world during those times of per∣secution, than there are at present in these which we call the flourishing times of Christianity. But this will be found an indisputable truth, if we form our calculation upon the opinions which pre∣vailed in those days, that every one who lives in the habitual practice of any vo∣luntary sin, actually cuts himself off from the benefits and profession of Christiani∣ty, and whatever he may call himself, is in reality no Christian, nor ought to be esteemed as such.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the times we are now surveying, the Christian religion showed its full force and efficacy on the minds of men, and by many examples demonstrated what great and generous souls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its proselytes to a very high degree of per∣fection, and set them far above the plea∣sures, and even the pains, of this life. It strengthned the infirmity, and broke the fierceness of human nature. It lifted up
<PB N="72" REF="100"/>
the minds of the ignorant to the know∣ledge and worship of him that made them, and inspired the vicious with a rational devotion, a strict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it spread through the world, it seemed to change mankind into another species of Beings. No sooner was a convert initiated into it, but by an easy figure he became a New Man, and both acted and looked upon himself as one regenerated and born a second time into another state of exi∣stence.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> It is not my business to be more particular in the accounts of primitive Christianity, which have been exhibited so well by others, but rather to observe, that the <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, of whom I am now speaking, mention this great refor∣mation of those who had been the great∣est sinners, with that sudden and sur∣prising change which it made in the lives of the most profligate, as having some∣thing in it supernatural, miraculous, and more than human. <HI>Origen</HI> represents this power in the Christian religion, as no less wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind, or cleansing the leper.
<PB N="73" REF="101"/>
Many others represent it in the same light, and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion, which showed it self in such strange and glorious effects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This therefore was a great means not only of recommending Christianity to honest and learned heathens, but of confirming them in the belief of our Sa∣viour's history, when they saw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming themselves upon his example, animated by his pre∣cepts, and actuated by that Spirit which he had promised to send among his Dis∣ciples.</P>
<P N="5">V. But I find no argument made a stronger impression on the minds of these eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, for strengthen∣ing their faith in the history of our Sa∣viour, than the predictions relating to him in those old prophetick writings, which were deposited among the hands of the greatest enemies to Christianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned heathen converts were astonished to see the whole history of their Saviour's life published before he was born, and to find that the Evangelists and Prophets,
<PB N="74" REF="102"/>
in their accounts of the <HI>Messiah</HI> differed only in point of time, the one foretel∣ling what should happen to him, and the other describing those very particulars as what had actually happened. This our Saviour himself was pleased to make use of as the strongest argument of his being the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> and without it would hardly have reconciled his Dis∣ciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable passage which men∣tions his conversation with the two Dis∣ciples, on the day of his resurrection. St. <HI>Luke.</HI> xxiv.13. to the end.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The heathen converts, after ha∣ving travelled through all human learn∣ing, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and sciences, were par∣ticularly qualified to examine these pro∣phecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or prepossession. If the <HI>Jews</HI> on the one side put an unna∣tural interpretation on these prophecies, to evade the force of them in their con∣troversies with the Christians; or if the Christians on the other side over-strained several passages in their applications of them, as it often happens among men of the best understanding, when their minds
<PB N="75" REF="103"/>
are heated with any consideration that bears a more than ordinary weight with it: the learned Heathens may be looked upon as neuters in the matter, when all these prophecies were new to them, and their education had left the interpreta∣tion of them free and indifferent. Be∣sides, these learned men among the pri∣mitive Christians, knew how the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had preceded our Saviour, inter∣preted these predictions, and the several marks by which they acknowledged the <HI>Messiah</HI> would be discovered, and how those of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Doctors who suc∣ceeded him, had deviated from the inter∣pretations and doctrines of their forefa∣thers, on purpose to stifle their own con∣viction.</P>
<P N="7">VII. This set of arguments had there∣fore an invincible force with those <HI>Pa∣gan</HI> Philosophers who became Christians, as we find in most of their writings. They could not disbelieve our Saviour's history, which so exactly agreed with every thing that had been written of him many ages before his birth, nor doubt of those circumstances being fulfilled in him, which could not be true of any person that lived in the world besides
<PB N="76" REF="104"/>
himself. This wrought the greatest confusion in the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> and the greatest conviction in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who every where speak with astonish∣ment of these truths they met with in this new magazine of learning which was opened to them, and carry the point so far as to think whatever excellent do∣ctrine they had met with among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, had been stole from their con∣versation with the <HI>Jews,</HI> or from the perusal of these writings which they had in their custody.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IMONIDES</HI> being ask'd by <HI>Dionysius</HI> the tyrant what God was, desired a day's time to consider of it before he made his reply. When the day was expired, he desired two days; and afterwards, instead of returning his answer, demanded still double the time to consider of it. This great poet and philosopher, the more he contemplated the nature of the Deity, found that he
<PB N="78" REF="106"/>
waded but the more out of his depth; and that he lost himself in the thought, instead of finding an end of it.</P>
<P>If we consider the Idea which wise men, by the light of reason, have framed of the Divine Being, it amounts to this: That he has in him all the perfection of a spiritual nature; and since we have no notion of any kind of spiritual perfection but what we discover in our own souls, we join Infinitude to each kind of these perfections, and what is a faculty in an human soul becomes an attribute in God. <HI>We</HI> exist in place and time, the Divine Being fills the immensity of space with his presence, and inhabits teernity. <HI>We</HI> are possessed of a little power and a little knowledge, the Divine Being is Almigh∣ty and Omniscient. In short, by adding Infinity to any kind of perfection we en∣joy, and by joining all these different kinds of perfections in one Being, we form our idea of the great Sovereign of nature.</P>
<P>Though every one who thinks must have made this observation, I shall pro∣duce Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s authority to the same purpose, out of his essay on human un∣derstanding.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">If we examine the idea
<PB N="79" REF="107"/>
we have of the incomprehensible su∣preme Being, we shall find, that we come by it the same way; and that the complex <HI>ideas</HI> we have both of God and separate spirits, are made up of the simple <HI>ideas</HI> we receive from <HI>reflection: v. g.</HI> having from what we experiment in our selves, got the <HI>ideas</HI> of existence and duration, of knowledge and pow∣er, of pleasure and happiness, and of se∣veral other qualities and powers, which it is better to have, than to be with∣out; when we would frame an <HI>idea</HI> the most suitable we can to the supreme Being, we enlarge every one of these with our <HI>idea</HI> of infinity; and so put∣ting them together, make our complex <HI>idea of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is not impossible that there may be many kinds of spiritual perfection, besides those which are lodged in an human soul; but it is impossible that we should have ideas of any kinds of perfection, except those of which we have some small rays and short imperfect strokes in our selves. It would be therefore a very high presum∣ption to determine whether the supreme Being has not many more attributes than those which enter into our conceptions
<PB N="80" REF="108"/>
of him. This is certain, that if there be any kind of spiritual perfection which is not marked out in an human soul, it belongs in its fulness to the Divine Na∣ture.</P>
<P>Several eminent Philosophers have ima∣gined that the soul, in her separate state, may have new faculties springing up in her, which she is not capable of exerting during her present union with the body, and whether these faculties may not cor∣respond with other attributes in the Di∣vine Nature, and open to us hereafter new matter of wonder and adoration, we are altogether ignorant. This, as I have said before, we ought to acquiesce in, that the Sovereign Being, the great Author of Nature, has in him all possible perfection, as well in <HI>kind</HI> as in <HI>degree</HI>; to speak ac∣cording to our methods of conceiving. I shall only add under this head, that when we have raised our notion of this infinite Being as high as it is possible for the mind of man to go, it will fall infinitely short of what he really is. <HI>There is no end of his greatness:</HI> The most exalted creature he has made, is only capable of adoring it, none but himself can comprehend it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="109"/>The advice of the son of <HI>Sirach</HI> is ve∣ry just and sublime in this light. <HI>By his word all things consist. We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all. How shall we be able to magnify him? For he is great above all his works. The Lord is terrible and very great; and marvellous in his power. When you glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as you can; for even yet will he far exceed. And when you exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for you can never go far enough. Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? And who can magnify him as he is? There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works.</HI></P>
<P>I have here only considered the Su∣preme Being by the light of reason and philosophy. If we would see him in all the wonders of his mercy we must have recourse to revelation, which represents him to us, not only as infinitely great and glorious, but as infinitely good and just in his dispensations towards man. But as this is a theory which falls under every one's consideration, tho' indeed it can never be sufficiently considered, I shall here only take notice of that habi∣tual worship and veneration which we
<PB N="82" REF="110"/>
ought to pay to this Almighty Being. We should often refresh our minds with the thought of him, and annihilate our selves before him, in the contemplation of our own worthlessness, and of his tran∣scendent excellency and perfection. This would imprint in our minds such a con∣stant and uninterrupted awe and venera∣tion as that which I am here recommend∣ing, and which is in reality a kind of incessant prayer, and reasonable humilia∣tion of the soul before him who made it.</P>
<P>This would effectually kill in us all the little seeds of pride, vanity and self-conceit, which are apt to shoot up in the minds of such whose thoughts turn more on those comparative advantages which they enjoy over some of their fel∣low-creatures, than on that infinite di∣stance which is placed between them and the supreme model of all perfection. It would likewise quicken our desires and endeavours of uniting our selves to him by all the acts of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>Such an habitual homage to the Su∣preme Being would, in a particular man∣ner, banish from among us that prevail∣ing impiety of using his name on the most trivial occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="111"/>I find the following passage in an ex∣cellent sermon, preached at the funeral of a gentleman who was an honour to his country, and a more diligent as well as successful enquirer into the works of nature, than any other our nation has ever produced.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">He had the profound∣est veneration for the great God of hea∣ven and earth that I have ever observed in any person. The very name of God was never mentioned by him without a pause and a visible stop in his discourse; in which, one that knew him most particularly above twenty years, has told me, that he was so exact, that he does not remember to have observed him once to fail in it.</Q></P>
<P>Every one knows the veneration which was paid by the <HI>Jews</HI> to a name so great, wonderful and holy. They would not let it enter even into their religious discour∣ses. What can we then think of those who make use of so tremendous a name in the ordinary expressions of their anger, mirth, and most impertinent passions? Of those who admit it into the most familiar que∣stions and assertions, ludicrous phrases and works of humour? not to mention those who violate it by solemn perjuries? It
<PB N="84" REF="112"/>
would be an affront to reason to endeavour to set forth the horror and profaneness of such a practice. The very mention of it exposes it sufficiently to those in whom the light of nature, not to say religion, is not utterly extinguished. </P>

<BIBL>Virg.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Was yesterday about sun-set walking in the open fields, 'till the night in∣sensibly fell upon me. I at first amused my self with all the richness and variety of colours, which appeared in the we∣stern parts of heaven: In proportion as they faded away and went out, several stars and planets appeared one after ano∣ther, 'till the whole firmament was in a glow. The blueness of the <HI>Aether</HI> was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the season of the year, and by the rays of all those luminaries that passed thro' it. The <HI>Galaxy</HI> appeared in its most beau∣tiful white. To compleat the scene, the full moon rose at length in that clouded majesty, which <HI>Milton</HI> takes notice of, and opened to the eye a new picture of
<PB N="85" REF="113"/>
nature, which was more finely shaded, and disposed among softer lights, than that which the sun had before discovered to us.</P>
<P>As I was surveying the moon walking in her brightness, and taking her pro∣gress among the constellations, a thought rose in me which I believe very often perplexes and disturbs men of serious and contemplative natures. <HI>David</HI> himself fell into it in that reflection, <HI>When I con∣sider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast or∣dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou re∣gardest him!</HI> In the same manner when I considered that infinite host of stars, or, to speak more philosophically, of suns, which were then shining upon me, with those innumerable sets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their respective suns; when I still enlar∣ged the idea, and supposed another hea∣ven of suns and worlds rising still above this which we discovered, and these still enlightned by a superior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so great a distance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the stars do to us; in short, whilst I pursued this
<PB N="86" REF="114"/>
thought, I could not but reflect on that little insignificant figure which I my self bore amidst the immensity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the sun, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the host of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extinguished and annihilated; they would not be missed more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The space they possess is so exceedingly lit∣tle in camparison of the whole, that it would scarce make a <HI>blank</HI> in the crea∣tion. The chasm would be impercepti∣ble to an eye, that could take in the whole compass of nature, and pass from one end of the creation to the other; as it is possible there may be such a sense in our selves hereafter, or in creatures which are at present more exalted than our selves. We see many stars by the help of glasses, which we do not discover with our naked eyes; and the finer our telescopes are, the more still are our dis∣coveries. <HI>Huygenius</HI> carries this thought so far, that he does not think it impossi∣ble there may be stars whose light is not yet travelled down to us, since their first creation. There is no question but the
<PB N="87" REF="115"/>
universe has certain bounds set to it; but when we consider that it is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite goodness, with an infinite space to exert it self in, how can our imagination set any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return therefore to my first thought, I could not but look upon my self with secret horror, as a Being that was not worth the smallest regard of one who had so great a work under his care and su∣perintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidst the immensity of na∣ture, and lost among that infinite variety of creatures, which in all probability swarm through all these immeasurable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my self from this mortifying thought, I considered that it took its rise from those narrow concep∣tions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine Nature. We our selves can∣not attend to many different objects at the same time. If we are careful to in∣spect some things, we must of course neglect others. This imperfection which we observe in our selves, is an imperfe∣ction that cleaves in some degree to crea∣tures of the highest capacities, as they
<PB N="88" REF="116"/>
are creatures, that is, Beings of finite and limited natures. The presence of every created Being is confined to a cer∣tain measure of space, and consequently his observation is stinted to a certain number of objects. The sphere in which we move, and act, and understand, is of a wider circumference to one creature than another, according as we rise one above another in the scale of existence. But the widest of these our spheres has its circumference. When therefore we reflect on the divine nature, we are so used and accustomed to this imperfection in our selves, that we cannot forbear in some measure ascribing it to him in whom there is no shadow of imperfecti∣on. Our reason indeed assures us that his attributes are infinite, but the poor∣ness of our conceptions is such that it cannot forbear setting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our reason comes again to our succour, and throws down all those little prejudices which rise in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multi∣plicity
<PB N="89" REF="117"/>
of his works, and the infinity of those objects among which he seems to be incessantly employed, if we consider, in the first place, that he is Omnipre∣sent; and, in the second, that he is Om∣niscient.</P>
<P>If we consider him in his Omnipre∣sence: His Being passes thro', actuates, and supports the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either so distant, so little, or so inconsiderable, which he does not essen∣tially inhabit. His substance is within the substance of every Being, whether material, or immaterial, and as intimate∣ly present to it, as that Being is to it self. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to withdraw himself from any thing he has created, or from any part of that space which is diffused and spread abroad to infinity. In short, to speak of him in the language of the old philosopher, he is a Being whose centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P>In the second place, he is Omniscient as well as Omnipresent. His Omniscience
<PB N="90" REF="118"/>
indeed necessarily and naturally flows from his Omnipresence; he cannot but be conscious of every motion that arises in the whole material world, which he thus essentially pervades, and of every thought that is stirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Several moralists have considered the creation as the temple of God, which he has built with his own hands, and which is filled with his pre∣sence. Others have considered infinite space as the receptacle, or rather the habi∣tation of the Almighty: But the noblest and most exalted way of considering this infinite space is that of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> who calls it the <HI>Sensorium</HI> of the God∣head. Brutes and men have their <HI>Senso∣riola,</HI> or little <HI>Sensoriums,</HI> by which they apprehend the presence and perceive the actions of a few objects, that lie conti∣guous to them. Their knowledge and observation turns within a very narrow circle. But as God Almighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he resides, infinite space gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to Omniscience.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="119"/>Were the soul separate from the bo∣dy, and with one glance of thought should start beyond the bounds of the creation, should it for millions of years continue its progress through infinite space with the same activity, it would still find it self within the embrace of its creator, and encompassed round with the immensity of the Godhead. Whilst we are in the body he is not less present with us, because he is concealed from us. <HI>O that I knew where I might find him!</HI> says <HI>Job. Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot per∣ceive him. On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him.</HI> In short, reason as well as revela∣tion assures us, that he cannot be absent from us, notwithstanding he is undisco∣vered by us.</P>
<P>In this consideration of God Almigh∣ty's Omnipresence and Omniscience eve∣ry uncomfortable thought vanishes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, especially such of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is
<PB N="92" REF="120"/>
apt to trouble them on this occasion: For, as it is impossible he should over∣look any of his creatures, so we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, those who endeavour to re∣commend themselves to his notice, and in an unfeigned humility of heart think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of them.</P>

<P>IN your paper of <HI>Friday</HI> the 9th in∣stant, you had occasion to consider the Ubiquity of the Godhead, and at the same time to shew, that as he is present to every thing, he cannot but be atten∣tive to every thing, and privy to all the modes and parts of its existence; or, in other words, that his Omniscience and Omnipresence are coexistent, and run to∣gether through the whole infinitude of space. This consideration might furnish us with many incentives to devotion and motives to morality, but as this subject has been handled by several excellent wri∣ters, I shall consider it in a light where∣in I have not seen it placed by others.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="121"/><HI>First,</HI> How disconsolate is the condi∣tion of an intellectual Being who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this his presence!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How deplorable is the con∣dition of an intellectual Being, who feels no other effect from this his presence but such as proceed from divine wrath and indignation!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> How happy is the condition of that intellectual Being, who is sensible of his Maker's presence from the secret effects of his mercy and loving-kindness.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> How disconsolate is the condi∣tion of an intellectual Being, who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this his presence! E∣very particle of matter is actuated by this Almighty Being which passes through it. The heavens and the earth, the stars and planets, move and gravitate by ver∣tue of this great principle within them. All the dead parts of nature are invigo∣rated by the presence of their Creator, and made capable of exerting their respe∣ctive qualities. The several instincts, in the brute creation, do likewise operate and work towards the several ends which
<PB N="94" REF="122"/>
are agreeable to them, by this divine energy. Man only, who does not co∣operate with this holy spirit, and is un∣attentive to his presence, receives none of those advantages from it, which are perfective of his nature, and necessary to his well-being. The Divinity is with him, and in him, and every where about him, but of no advantage to him. It is the same thing to a man without reli∣gion, as if there were no God in the world. It is indeed impossible for an in∣finite Being to remove himself from any of his creatures, but though he cannot withdraw his essence from us, which would argue an imperfection in him, he can withdraw from us all the joys and consolations of it. His presence may per∣haps be necessary to support us in our existence; but he may leave this our ex∣istence to it self, with regard to its hap∣piness or misery. For, in this sense, he may cast us away from his presence, and take his holy spirit from us. This single consideration one would think sufficient to make us open our hearts to all those infusions of joy and gladness which are so near at hand, and ready to be poured in upon us; especially when we consi∣der, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The deplorable condition
<PB N="95" REF="123"/>
of an intellectual Being who feels no o∣ther effects from his Maker's presence, but such as proceed from divine wrath and indignation!</P>
<P>We may assure ourselves, that the great Author of nature will not always be as one, who is indifferent to any of his crea∣tures. Those who will not feel him in his love, will be sure at length to feel him in his displeasure. And how dread∣ful is the condition of that creature, who is only sensible of the Being of his Cre∣ator by what he suffers from him! He is as essentially present in hell as in heaven, but the inhabitants of those accursed places behold him only in his wrath, and shrink within the flames to conceal them∣selves from him. It is not in the power of imagination to conceive the fearful effect of Omnipotence incensed.</P>
<P>But I shall only consider the wretched∣ness of an intellectual Being, who, in this life, lies under the displeasure of him, that at all times and in all places is inti∣mately united with him. He is able to disquiet the soul, and vex it in all its faculties. He can hinder any of the great∣est comforts of life from refreshing us, and give an edge to every one of its lightest calamities. Who then can bear
<PB N="96" REF="124"/>
the thought of being an out-cast from his presence, that is, from the comforts of it, or of feeling it only in its terrors? How pathetick is that expostulation of <HI>Job,</HI> when, for the tryal of his patience, he was made to look upon himself in this deplorable condition! <HI>Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am become a burthen to my self?</HI> But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> how happy is the condition of that intel∣lectual Being, who is sensible of his Ma∣ker's presence from the secret effects of his mercy and loving-kindness.</P>
<P>The Blessed in heaven behold him face to face; that is, are as sensible of his presence as we are of the presence of any person whom we look upon with our eyes. There is doubtless a faculty in Spi∣rits, by which they apprehend one ano∣ther, as our senses do material objects; and there is no question but our souls, when they are disembodied, or placed in glorified bodies, will by this faculty, in whatever part of space they reside, be al∣ways <HI>sensible</HI> of the divine presence. We, who have this veil of flesh standing be∣tween us and the world of spirits, must be content to know that the Spirit of God is present with us, by the effects which he produceth in us. Our outward senses are
<PB N="97" REF="125"/>
too gross to apprehend him; we may however taste and see how gracious he is, by his influence upon our minds, by those virtuous thoughts which he awa∣kens in us, by those secret comforts and refreshments which he conveys into our souls, and by those ravishing joys and inward satisfactions, which are perpetu∣ally springing up, and diffusing them∣selves among all the thoughts of good men. He is lodged in our very essence, and is as a soul within the soul, to irra∣diate its understanding, rectify its will, purify its passions, and enliven all the powers of man. How happy therefore is an intellectual Being, who, by prayer and meditation, by virtue and good works, opens this communication between God and his own soul! Tho' the whole crea∣tion frowns upon him, and all nature looks black about him, he has his light and support within him, that are able to cheer his mind, and bear him up in the midst of all those horrors which encom∣pass him. He knows that his helper is at hand, and is always nearer to him than any thing else can be, which is capable of annoying or terrifying him. In the midst of calumny or contempt, he at∣tends to that Being who whispers better
<PB N="98" REF="126"/>
things within his soul, and whom he looks upon as his defender, his glory, and the lifter-up of his head. In his deepest solitude and retirement, he knows that he is in company with the greatest of Beings; and perceives within himself such real sensations of his presence, as are more delightful than any thing that can be met with in the conversation of his creatures. Even in the hour of death, he considers the pains of his dissolution to be nothing else but the breaking down of that partition, which stands betwixt his soul, and the sight of that being, who is always present with him, and is about to manifest it self to him in fulness of joy.</P>
<P>If we would be thus happy, and thus sensible of our Maker's presence, from the secret effects of his mercy and good∣ness, we must keep such a watch over all our thoughts, that, in the language of the scripture, his soul may have pleasure in us. We must take care not to grieve his holy Spirit, and endeavour to make the meditations of our hearts always ac∣ceptable in his sight, that he may de∣light thus to reside and dwell in us. The light of nature could direct <HI>Seneca</HI> to this doctrine, in a very remarkable passage a∣mong his epistles; <HI>Sacer inest in nobis spi∣ritus
<PB N="99" REF="127"/>
bonorum malorumque custos, &amp; obser∣vator, &amp; quemadmodum nos illam tracta∣mus, ita &amp; ille nos.</HI> There is a holy Spi∣rit residing in us, who watches and ob∣serves both good and evil men, and will treat us after the same manner that we treat him. But I shall conclude this dis∣course with those more emphatical words in divine revelation, <HI>If a man love me, he will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Considered in my two last letters that awful and tremendous subject, the Ubiquity or Omnipresence of the Divine Being. I have shewn that he is equally present in all places through∣out the whole extent of infinite space. This doctrine is so agreeable to reason, that we meet with it in the writings of the enlightened heathens, as I might show at large, were it not already done by other hands. But tho' the Deity be thus essentially present through all
<PB N="100" REF="128"/>
the immensity of space, there is one part of it in which he discovers him∣self in a most transcendent and visible glory. This is that place which is marked out in scripture under the dif∣ferent appellations of <HI>paradise, the third heaven, the throne of God, and the habi∣tation of his glory.</HI> It is here where the glorified body of our Saviour resides, and where all the celestial hierarchies, and the innumerable hosts of Angels, are represented as perpetually surround∣ing the seat of God with <HI>hallelujahs</HI> and hymns of praise. This is that pre∣sence of God which some of the divines call his glorious, and others his maje∣statick presence. He is indeed as essen∣tially present in all other places as in this, but it is here where he resides in a sen∣sible magnificence, and in the midst of those splendors which can affect the imagination of created Beings.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable that this opi∣nion of God Almighty's presence in heaven, whether discovered by the light of nature, or by a general tradition from our first parents, prevails among all the nations of the world, whatsoever diffe∣rent notions they entertain of the God∣head. If you look into <HI>Homer,</HI> that is,
<PB N="101" REF="129"/>
the most ancient of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers, you see the Supreme Powers seated in the heavens, and encompassed with in∣ferior Deities, among whom the Muses are represented as singing incessantly about his throne. Who does not here see the main strokes and outlines of this great truth we are speaking of? The same doctrine is shadowed out in many other heathen authors, tho' at the same time, like several other revealed truths, dashed and adulterated with a mixture of fables and human inventions. But to pass over the notions of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> those more enlightened parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, we find there is scarce a people among the late dis∣covered nations who are not trained up in an opinion, that heaven is the habi∣tation of the Divinity whom they wor∣ship.</P>
<P>As in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple there was the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> in which a visible glory appeared among the figures of the Cherubims, and into which none but the high priest himself was permit∣ted to enter, after having made an atonement for the sins of the people; so if we consider the whole creation as one great temple, there is in it this Ho∣ly
<PB N="102" REF="130"/>
of Holies, into which the high priest of our salvation entered, and took his place among Angels and Archangels, after having made a propitiation for the sins of mankind.</P>
<P>With how much skill must the throne of God be erected? With what glo∣rious designs is that habitation beauti∣fied, which is contrived and built by him who inspired <HI>Hyram</HI> with wisdom? How great must be the majesty of that place, where the whole art of creation has been employed, and where God has chosen to show himself in the most magnificent manner? What must be the architecture of infinite power under the direction of infinite wisdom? A spi∣rit cannot but be transported after an ineffable manner, with the sight of those objects, which were made to affect him by that Being who knows the inward frame of a soul, and how to please and ravish it in all its most secret powers and faculties. It is to this majestatick presence of God, we may apply those beautiful expressions in holy writ: <HI>Be∣hold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea the stars are not pure in his sight.</HI> The light of the sun, and all the glories of the world in which we live, are but
<PB N="103" REF="131"/>
as weak and sickly glimmerings, or ra∣ther darkness itself, in comparison of those splendors which encompass the throne of God.</P>
<P>As the <HI>glory</HI> of this place is transcen∣dent beyond imagination, so probably is the <HI>extent</HI> of it. There is light be∣hind light, and glory within glory. How far that space may reach, in which God thus appears in perfect majesty, we cannot possibly conceive. Tho' it is not infinite, it may be indefinite; and though not immeasurable in it self, it may be so with regard to any created eye or imagination. If he has made these lower regions of matter so incon∣ceivably wide and magnificent for the habitation of mortal and perishable Be∣ings, how great may we suppose the courts of his house to be, where he makes his residence in a more especial manner, and displays himself in the ful∣ness of his glory, among an innumera∣ble company of Angels, and Spirits of just men made perfect?</P>
<P>This is certain, that our imagina∣tions cannot be raised too high, when we think on a place where Omnipo∣tence and Omniscience have so signal∣ly exerted themselves, because that they
<PB N="104" REF="132"/>
are able to produce a Scene infinitely more great and glorious than what we are able to imagine. It is not impossi∣ble but at the consummation of all things, these outward apartments of na∣ture, which are now suited to those Beings who inhabit them, may be ta∣ken in and added to that glorious place of which I am here speaking; and by that means made a proper habitation for Beings who are exempt from mor∣tality, and cleared of their imperfecti∣ons: For so the scripture seems to in∣timate when it speaks of new heavens and of a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</P>
<P>I have only considered this glorious place, with regard to the sight and ima∣gination, though it is highly probable that our other senses may here likewise enjoy their highest gratifications. There is nothing which more ravishes and tran∣sports the soul, than harmony; and we have great reason to believe, from the descriptions of this place in Holy Scri∣ture, that this is one of the entertain∣ments of it. And if the soul of man can be so wonderfully affected with those strains of musick, which human art is capable of producing, how much
<PB N="105" REF="133"/>
more will it be raised and elevated by those, in which is exerted the whole power of harmony! The senses are fa∣culties of the human soul, though they cannot be employed, during this our vital union, without proper instruments in the body. Why therefore should we exclude the satisfaction of these faculties, which we find by experience are inlets of great pleasure to the soul, from among those entertainments which are to make up our happiness hereaf∣ter? Why should we suppose that our hearing and seeing will not be gratify'd with those objects which are most a∣greeable to them, and which they can∣not meet with in these lower regions of nature; objects, <HI>which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive? I knew a man in Christ</HI> (says St. <HI>Paul,</HI> speaking of himself) <HI>above fourteen years ago (whe∣ther in the body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God know∣eth) such a one caught up to the third hea∣ven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth) how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not possible for a man to
<PB N="106" REF="134"/>
utter.</HI> By this is meant, that what he heard was so infinitely different from any thing which he had heard in this world, that it was impossible to express it in such words as might convey a no∣tion of it to his hearers.</P>
<P>It is very natural for us to take de∣light in enquiries concerning any fo∣reign Country, where we are some time or other to make our abode; and as we all hope to be admitted into this glorious place, it is both a laudable and useful curiosity, to get what infor∣mations we can of it, whilst we make use of revelation for our guide. When these everlasting doors shall be open to us, we may be sure that the pleasures and beauties of this place will infinite∣ly transcend our present hopes and ex∣pectations, and that the glorious ap∣pearance of the throne of God, will rise infinitely beyond whatever we are able to conceive of it. We might here entertain our selves with many other speculations on this subject, from those several hints which we find of it in the holy scriptures; as whether there may not be different mansions and a∣partments of glory, to Beings of different natures; whether as they excel one
<PB N="107" REF="135"/>
another in perfection, they are not ad∣mitted nearer to the throne of the Al∣mighty, and enjoy greater manifesta∣tions of his presence; whether there are not solemn times and occasions, when all the multitude of heaven ce∣lebrate the presence of their Maker in more extraordinary forms of praise and adoration; as <HI>Adam,</HI> though he had continued in a state of innocence, would, in the opinion of our Divines, have kept holy the Sabbath-day, in a more particular manner than any other of the seven. These, and the like specu∣lations, we may very innocently in∣dulge, so long as we make use of them to inspire us with a desire of becoming inhabitants of this delightful place.</P>
<P>I have in this, and in two foregoing letters, treated on the most serious sub∣ject that can employ the mind of man, the Omnipresence of the Deity; a subject which, if possible, should ne∣ver depart from our meditations. We have considered the Divine Being, as he inhabits infinitude, as he dwells a∣mong his work, as he is present to the mind of man, and as he discovers him∣self in a more glorious manner among the regions of the Blest. Such a con∣sideration
<PB N="108" REF="136"/>
should be kept awake in us at all times, and in all places, and pos∣sess our minds with a perpetual awe and reverence. It should be interwo∣ven with all our thoughts and percep∣tions, and become one with the con∣sciousness of our own Being. It is not to be reflected on in the coldness of philosophy, but ought to sink us into the lowest prostration before him, who is so astonishingly great, wonderful and holy.</P>

<P>WE consider infinite space as an ex∣pansion without a circumference: We consider eternity, or infinite durati∣on, as a line that has neither a begin∣ning nor end. In our speculations of in∣finite space, we consider that particular place in which we exist, as a kind of center to the whole expansion. In our
<PB N="109" REF="137"/>
speculations of eternity, we consider the time which is present to us as the mid∣dle, which divides the whole line into two equal parts. For this reason, many witty authors compare the present time to an Isthmus or narrow neck of land, that rises in the midst of an ocean, im∣measurably diffused on either side of it.</P>
<P>Philosophy, and indeed common sense, naturally throws eternity under two divi∣sions; which we may call in <HI>English,</HI> that eternity which is past, and that eternity which is to come. The learned terms of <HI>aeternitas a parte ante,</HI> and <HI>aeternitas a parte post,</HI> may be more amusing to the reader, but can have no other idea affixed to them than what is conveyed to us by those words, an eternity that is past, and an eternity that is to come. Each of these eternities is bounded at the one ex∣tream; or, in other words, the former has an end, and the latter a beginning.</P>
<P>Let us first of all consider that eterni∣ty which is past, reserving that which is to come for the subject of another paper. The nature of this eternity is utterly in∣conceivable by the mind of man: Our reason demonstrates to us that it <HI>has been,</HI> but at the same time can frame no idea of it, but what is big with absurdity and
<PB N="110" REF="138"/>
contradiction. We can have no other conception of any duration which is past, than that all of it was once present; and whatever was once present, is at some certain distance from us; and whatever is at any certain distance from us, be the distance never so remote, cannot be eter∣nity. The very notion of any duration's being past, implies that it was once pre∣sent; for the idea of being once present, is actually included in the idea of its be∣ing past. This therefore is a depth not to be sounded by human understanding. We are sure that there has been an eter∣nity, and yet contradict our selves when we measure this eternity by any notion which we can frame of it.</P>
<P>If we go to the bottom of this mat∣ter, we shall find, that the difficulties we meet with in our conceptions of eternity proceed from this single reason, that we can have no other idea of any kind of duration, than that by which we our selves, and all other created Beings, do exist; which is, a successive duration made up of past, present, and to come. There is nothing which exists after this manner, all the parts of whose existence were not once actually present, and con∣sequently may be reached by a certain
<PB N="111" REF="139"/>
number of years applied to it. We may ascend as high as we please, and employ our Being to that eternity which is to come, in adding millions of years to mil∣lions of years, and we can never come up to any fountain-head of duration, to any beginning in eternity: But at the same time we are sure, that whatever was once present does lye within the reach of numbers, though perhaps we can never be able to put enough of them together for that purpose. We may as well say, that any thing may be actually present in any part of infinite space, which does not lye at a certain distance from us, as that any part of infinite duration was once actually present, and does not also lye at some determined distance from us. The distance in both cases may be im∣measurable and indefinite as to our facul∣ties, but our reason tells us that it can∣not be so in it self. Here therefore is that difficulty which human understanding is not capable of surmounting. We are sure that something must have existed from eternity, and are at the same time unable to conceive, that any thing which exists, according to our notion of exi∣stence, can have existed from eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="140"/>It is hard for a reader, who has not rolled this thought in his own mind, to follow in such an abstracted speculation; but I have been the longer on it, be∣cause I think it is a demonstrative argu∣ment of the Being and Eternity of a God: And tho' there are many other demon∣strations which lead us to this great truth, I do not think we ought to lay aside any proofs in this matter which the light of reason has suggested to us, especi∣ally when it is such a one as has been ur∣ged by men famous for their penetration and force of understanding, and which appears altogether conclusive to those who will be at the pains to examine it.</P>
<P>Having thus considered that eternity which is past, according to the best idea we can frame of it, I shall now draw up those several articles on this subject which are dictated to us by the light of reason, and which may be looked upon as the Creed of a Philosopher in this great point.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is certain that no Being could have made it self; for if so, it must have acted before it was, which is a con∣tradiction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That therefore some Being must have existed from all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="141"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That whatever exists after the manner of created Beings, or according to any notions which we have of Existence, could not have existed from Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That this eternal Being must therefore be the great Author of nature, <HI>The Ancient of Days,</HI> who, being at an in∣finite distance in his perfections from all finite and created Beings, exists in a quite different manner from them, and in a manner of which they can have no Idea.</P>
<P>I know that several of the School-men, who would not be thought ignorant of any thing, have pretended to explain the manner of God's existence, by telling us, That he comprehends infinite du∣ration in every moment; That eternity is with him a <HI>Punctum stans,</HI> a fixed point; or, which is as good Sense, an <HI>infinite instant</HI>; That nothing with refe∣rence to his Existence is either past or to come: To which the ingenious Mr. <HI>Cow∣ley</HI> alludes in his description of Heaven,
<Q><L>Nothing is there to come, and nothing past,</L>
<L>But an Eternal <HI>NOW</HI> does always last.</L></Q></P>
<P>For my own part, I look upon these propositions as words that have no ideas annexed to them; and think men had better own their ignorance, than advance
<PB N="114" REF="142"/>
Doctrines by which they mean nothing, and which indeed are self-contradictory. We cannot be too modest in our dis∣quisitions, when we meditate on Him who is environed with so much glory and perfection, who is the source of Be∣ing, the fountain of all that Existence which we and his whole Creation derive from him. Let us therefore with the ut∣most humility acknowledge, that as some Being must necessarily have ex∣isted from eternity, so this Being does exist after an incomprehensible man∣ner, since it is impossible for a Being to have existed from eternity after our manner or notions of Existence. Re∣velation confirms these natural di∣ctates of reason in the accounts which it gives us of the Divine Existence, where it tells us, that he is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; that he is the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Be∣ginning and the Ending; that a thou∣sand years are with him as one day, and one day as a thousand years; by which and the like expressions, we are taught, that his Existence, with relation to time or duration, is infinitely different from the Existence of any of his creatures, and consequently that it is impossible for
<PB N="115" REF="143"/>
us to frame any adequate conceptions of it.</P>
<P>In the first revelation which he makes of his own Being, he entitles himself, <HI>I am that I am</HI>; and when <HI>Moses</HI> desires to know what Name he shall give him in his embassy to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he bids him say that <HI>I am</HI> hath sent you. Our great Creator, by this revelation of himself, does in a manner exclude every thing else from a real Existence, and distinguishes himself from his creatures, as the only Being which truly and really exists. The ancient Platonick notion, which was drawn from speculations of eternity, won∣derfully agrees with this revelation which God has made of himself. There is no∣thing, say they, which in reality exists, whose Existence, as we call it, is pieced up of past, present and to come. Such a flitting and successive Existence is ra∣ther a shadow of Existence, and some∣thing which is like it, than Existence it self. He only properly exists whose Ex∣istence is intirely present; that is, in o∣ther words, who exists in the most per∣fect manner, and in such a manner, as we have no idea of.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this speculation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e useful inference. How can we suffi∣ciently
<PB N="116" REF="144"/>
prostrate our selves and fall down before our Maker, when we consider that ineffable goodness and wisdom which con∣trived this Existenee for finite natures? What must be the overflowings of that good-will, which prompted our Creator to adapt Existence to Beings, in whom it is not necessary? Especially when we consider that he himself was before in the compleat possession of Existence and of Happiness, and in the full enjoyment of Eternity. What man can think of himself as called out and separated from nothing, of his being made a conscious, a reasonable and a happy creature, in short, of being taken in as a sharer of his Existence and a kind of partner in Eternity, without being swallowed up in wonder, in praise, in adoration! It is in∣deed a thought too big for the mind of man, and rather to be entertained in the secrecy of devotion, and in the silence of the soul, than to be expressed by words. The Supreme Being has not given us powers or faculties sufficient to extol and magnifie such unutterable goodness.</P>
<P>It is however some comfort to us, that we shall be always doing what we shall be never able to do, and that a work which cannot be finished, will however be the work of an Eternity.</P>

<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of pleasure in contemplating the material world, by which I mean that system of bodies into which Nature has so curiously wrought the mass of dead matter, with the several relations which those bodies bear to one another; there is still, methinks, something more wonderful and surprizing in contempla∣tions on the world of life, by which I mean all those animals with which eve∣ry part of the universe is furnished. The material world is only the shell of the universe: The world of Life are its in∣habitants.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="146"/>If we consider those parts of the ma∣terial world which lie the nearest to us, and are therefore subject to our observa∣tions and enquiries, it is amazing to con∣sider the infinity of animals with which it is stocked. Every part of matter is peopled: Every green leaf swarms with Inhabitants. There is scarce a single hu∣mour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our glasses do not discover myriads of' living creatures. The surface of animals is also covered with other animals, which are in the same manner the basis of other animals, that live upon it; nay, we find in the most solid bodies, as in marble itself, innume∣rable cells and cavities that are crouded with such imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to disco∣ver. On the other hand, if we, look in∣to the more bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes and rivers teeming with numberless kinds of living creatures: We find every mountain and marsh, wil∣derness and wood, plentifully stocked with birds and beasts, and every part of matter affording proper necessaries and conveniencies for the livelihood of multi∣tudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="147"/>The author of the <HI>Plurality of Worlds</HI> draws a very good argument from this consideration, for the <HI>Peopling</HI> of every planet; as indeed it seems very probable from the analogy of reason, that if no part of matter, which we are acquainted with, lies waste and useless, those great bodies which are at such a distance from us should not be desart and unpeopled, but rather that they should be furnished with Beings adapted to their respective situations.</P>
<P>Existence is a blessing to those Beings only which are endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any further than as it is sub∣servient to Beings which are conscious of their Existence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our observation, that matter is only made as the basis and support of animals, and that there is no more of the one, than what is necessary for the Existence of the o∣ther.</P>
<P>Infinite Goodness is of so communi∣cative a nature, that it seems to delight in the conferring of Existence upon eve∣ry degree of perceptive Being. As this is a speculation, which I have often pur∣sued
<PB N="120" REF="148"/>
with great pleasure to my self, I shall enlarge farther upon it, by consi∣dering that part of the scale of Beings which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P>There are some living creatures which are raised but just above dead matter. To mention only that species of shelfish, which are form'd in the fashion of a cone, that grow to the surface of several Rocks, and immediately die upon their being sever'd from the place where they grow. There are many other creatures but one remove from these, which have no other sense besides that of feeling and taste. Others have still an additional one of hearing; others of smell, and others of sight. It is wonderful to observe, by what a gradual progress the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of species, before a creature is form'd that is compleat in all its senses; and even among these there is such a different degree of perfection in the sense which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the sense in dif∣ferent animals be distinguished by the same common denomination, it seems al∣most of a different nature. If after this we look into the several inward per∣fections
<PB N="121" REF="149"/>
of cunning and sagacity, or what we generally call Instinct, we find them rising after the same manner, im∣perceptibly one above another, and re∣ceiving additional improvements accord∣ing to the species in which they are im∣planted. This progress in Nature is so very gradual, that the most perfect of an inferior species comes very near to the most imperfect of that which is imme∣diately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing good∣ness of the Supreme Being, whose mercy extends to all his works, is plainly seen, as I have before hinted, from his having made so very little matter, at least what falls within our knowledge, that does not swarm with life: Nor is his good∣ness less seen in the diversity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one species of animals, none of the rest would have enjoyed the hap∣piness of existence; he has, therefore, <HI>specified</HI> in his creation every degree of life, every capacity of Being. The whole chasm in nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diverse kinds of crea∣tures, rising one over another, by such a gentle and easie ascent, that the little
<PB N="122" REF="150"/>
transitions and deviations; from one spe∣cies to another, are almost insensible. This intermediate space is so well hus∣banded and managed, that there is scarce a degree of perception which does not appear in some one part of the world of life. Is the goodness or wisdom of the Divine Being, more manifested, in this his Proceeding?</P>
<P>There is a consequence; besides those I have already mentioned, which seems very naturally deducible from the fore∣going Considerations. If the scale of Being rises by such a regular progress, so high as man, we may by a parity of reason suppose that it still proceeds gra∣dually through those Beings which are of a superior nature to him, since there is an infinitely greater space and room for different degrees of perfection, be∣tween the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the most despicable in∣sect. This, consequence of so great a variety of Beings which are superior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us, is made by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in a passage which I shall here set down, after having premised, that not withstanding there is such infinite room between man and his
<PB N="123" REF="151"/>
Maker for the creative power to exert it self in, it is impossible that it should ever be filled up, since there will be still an infinite gap or distance between the highest created Being, and the Power which produced him.</P>
<P><HI>That there should be more</HI> species <HI>of in∣telligent creatures above us, than there are of sensible and material below us, is probable to me from hence; That in all the visible corporeal world, we see no chasms, or no gaps. All quite down from us, the descent is by easy steps, and a continued series of things, that in each remove differ very lit∣tle one from the other. There are fishes that have wings, and are not stranger to the airy region: and there are some birds, that are inhabitants of the water; whose blood is cold as fishes, and their flesh so like in taste, that the scrupulous are allowed them on fish-days. There are animals so near of kin both to birds and beasts, that they are in the middle between both: Amphibious animals link the terrestrial and aquatick together; Seals live at land and at sea, and porpoises have the warm blood and entrails of a hog; not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or sea-men. There are some brutes, that seem to have as much
<PB N="124" REF="152"/>
knowledge and reason, as some that are called men; and the animal and vegetable king∣doms are so nearly join'd, that if you will take the lowest of one, and the highest of the other, there will scarce be perceived any great difference between them: and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical parts of matter, we shall find every where that the several</HI> Species <HI>are linked together, and differ but in almost insensible degrees. And when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the Maker, we have reason to think that it is suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe, and the great de∣sign and infinite goodness of the architect, that the</HI> Species <HI>of creatures should also, by gentle degrees, ascend upward from us to∣ward his infinite perfection, as we see they gradually descend from us downwards: which if it be probable, we have reason then to be persuaded, that there are far more</HI> Species <HI>of creatures above us, than there are beneath; we being in degrees of perfecti∣on much more remote from the infinite Being of God, than we are from the lowest state of Being, and that which approaches nearest to nothing. And yet of all those distinct</HI> Spe∣cies, <HI>we have no clear distinct</HI> ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="153"/>In this system of Being, there is no creature so wonderful in its nature, and which so much deserves our particular attention, as man, who fills up the mid∣dle space between the animal and intel∣lectual nature, the visible and invisible world, and is that link in the chain of Beings, which has been often termed the <HI>nexus utriusque mundi.</HI> So that he who in one respect is associated with Angels and Arch-angels, may look upon a Be∣ing of infinite perfection as his father, and the highest order of spirits as his brethren, may in another respect say to <HI>corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my sister.</HI> </P>

<P>THOSE who were skilful in anato∣my among the ancients, concluded from the outward and inward make of an human body, that it was the work of a Being transcendently wise and power∣ful. As the world grew more enlightened in this art, their discoveries gave them fresh opportunities of admiring the con∣duct of Providence in the formation of an
<PB N="126" REF="154"/>
human body. <HI>Galen</HI> was converted by his dissections, and could not but own a Su∣preme Being upon a survey of this his handy-work. There were, indeed, many parts of which the old Anatomists did not know the certain use; but as they saw that most of those which they examined were adapted with admirable art to their se∣veral functions, they did not question but those, whose uses they could not determine, were contrived with the same wisdom for respective ends and purposes. Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great discoveries have been made by our mo∣dern Anatomists, we see new wonders in the human frame, and discern several im∣portant uses for those parts, which uses the ancients knew nothing of. In short, the body of man is such a subject as stands the utmost test of examination. Tho' it appears formed with the nicest wisdom, upon the most superficial survey of it, it still mends upon the search, and produces our surprize and amazement in proportion as we pry into it. What I have here said of an human body, may be applied to the body of every animal which has been the subject of anatomical observations.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="155"/>The body of an animal is an object ade∣quate to our Senses. It is a particular system of providence, that lies in a nar∣row compass. The eye is able to com∣mand it, and by successive enquiries can search into all its parts. Could the body of the whole earth, or indeed the whole universe, be thus submitted to the exami∣nation of our senses, were it not too big and disproportioned for our enquiries, too unwiedly for the management of the eye and hand, there is no question but it would appear to us as curious and well-contrived a frame as that of an human body. We should see the same conca∣tenation and subserviency, the same ne∣cessity and usefulness, the same beauty and harmony in all and every of its parts, as what we discover in the body of every single animal.</P>
<P>The more extended our reason is, and the more able to grapple with immense objects, the greater still are those disco∣veries which it makes of wisdom and providence in the work of the creation. A Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> who stands up as the miracle of the present age, can look through a whole planetary system; con∣sider it in its weight, number, and mea∣sure;
<PB N="128" REF="156"/>
and draw from it as many demon∣strations of infinite power and wisdom, as a more confined understanding is able to deduce from the system of an human body.</P>
<P>But to return to our speculations on anatomy. I shall here consider the fa∣brick and texture of the bodies of ani∣mals in one particular view; which, in my opinion, shews the hand of a think∣ing and all-wise Being in their formati∣on, with the evidence of a thousand de∣monstrations. I think we may lay this down as an incontested principle, that chance never acts in a perpetual unifor∣mity and consistence with it self. If one should always fling the same number with ten thousand dice, or see every throw just five times less, or five times more in number than the throw which immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there is some invisible power which directs the cast? This is the pro∣ceeding which we find in the operations of nature. Every kind of animal is di∣versified by different magnitudes, each of which gives rise to a different species. Let a man trace the dog or lion-kind, and he will observe how many of the
<PB N="129" REF="157"/>
works of nature are published, if I may use the expression, in a variety of editi∣ons. If we look into the reptile world, or into those different kinds of animals that fill the element of water, we meet with the same repetitions among several species, that differ very little from one another, but in size and bulk. You find the same creature that is drawn at large, copied out in several proportions, and ending in miniature. It would be tedious to produce instances of this regular con∣duct in Providence, as it would be su∣perfluous to those who are versed in the natural history of animals. The magni∣ficent harmony of the universe is such, that we may observe innumerable <HI>divi∣sions</HI> running upon the same <HI>ground.</HI> I might also extend this speculation to the dead parts of nature, in which we may find matter disposed into many <HI>similar</HI> systems, as well in our survey of stars and planets, as of stones, vegetables, and o∣ther sublunary parts of the creation. In a word, Providence has shewn the rich∣ness of its goodness and wisdom, not on∣ly in the production of many original species, but in the multiplicity of De∣scants which it has made on every origi∣nal species in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="158"/>But to pursue his thought still farther: Every living creature, considered in it self, has many very complicated parts, that are exact copies of some other parts which it possesses, and which are com∣plicated in the same manner. One <HI>eye</HI> would have been sufficient for the subsi∣stence and preservation of an animal; but, in order to better his condition, we see another placed with a mathematical ex∣actness in the same most advantageous si∣tuation, and in every particular of the same size and texture. Is it possible for chance to be thus delicate and uniform in her operations? Should a million of dice turn up twice together the same number, the wonder would be nothing in compa∣rison with this. But when we see this similitude and resemblance in the arm, the hand, the fingers; when we see one half of the body entirely correspond with the other in all those minute strokes, without which a man might have very well subsisted; nay, when we often see a single part repeated an hundred times in the same body, notwithstanding it con∣sists of the most intricate weaving of numberless fibres, and these parts differ∣ing still in magnitude, as the convenience
<PB N="131" REF="159"/>
of their particular situation requires; sure a man must have a strange cast of understanding, who does not discover the Finger of God in so wonderful a work. These duplicates in those parts of the body, without which a man might have very well subsisted, tho' not so well as with them, are a plain demonstration of an all-wise contriver; as those more numerous copyings, which are found a∣mong the vessels of the same body, are evident demonstrations that they could not be the work of chance. This argu∣ment receives additional strength, if we apply it to every animal and insect with∣in our knowledge, as well as to those numberless living creatures that are ob∣jects too minute for a human eye: and if we consider how the several species in this whole world of life resemble one an∣other in very many particulars, so far as is convenient for their respective states of existence; it is much more probable that an hundred million of dice should be ca∣sually thrown a hundred million of times in the same number, than that the body of any single animal should be produced by the fortuitous concourse of matter. And that the like chance should arise in
<PB N="132" REF="160"/>
innumerable instances, requires a degree of credulity that is not under the dire∣ction of common sense. We may carry this consideration yet further, if we re∣flect on the two sexes in every living spe∣cies, with their resemblances to each o∣ther, and those particular distinctions that were necessary for the keeping up of this great world of life.</P>
<P>There are many more demonstrations of a Supreme Being, and of his transcen∣dent wisdom, power and goodness in the formation of the body of a living crea∣ture, for which I refer my reader to o∣ther writings, particularly to the sixth book of the Poem, entitled <HI>Creation,</HI> where the anatomy of the human body is described with great perspicuity and elegance. I have been particular on the thought which runs through this specu∣lation, because I have not seen it enlarged upon by others.</P>

<P>I Had this morning a very valuable and kind present sent me, of a trans∣lated work of a most excellent foreign writer, who makes a very considerable figure in the learned and christian world. It is entitled, <HI>A demonstration of the Exi∣stence, Wisdom, and Omnipotence of God,</HI> drawn from the knowledge of nature, particularly of man, and fitted to the meanest capacity, by the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> author of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and trans∣lated from the <HI>French</HI> by the same hand that <HI>Englished</HI> that excellent piece. This great author, in the writings which he has before produced, has manifested an heart full of virtuous sentiments, great benevolence to mankind, as well as a sin∣cere and fervent piety towards his Crea∣tor. His talents and parts are a very great good to the world, and it is a plea∣sing thing to behold the polite arts sub∣servient to religion, and recommending it from its natural beauty. Looking over the letters of my correspondents, I find one which celebrates this treatise, and recommends it to my readers.</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>GUARDIAN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think I have somewhere read, in the writings of one whom I take to be a friend of yours, a saying which struck me very much, and as I remem∣ber it was to this purpose: <HI>The Exi∣stence of a God is so far from being a thing that wants to be proved, that I think it the only thing of which we are certain.</HI> This is a sprightly and just expression; however, I dare say, you will not be displeased that I put you in mind of saying something on the De∣monstration of the Bishop of <HI>Cambray.</HI> A man of his talents views all things in a light different from that in which ordinary men see them, and the devout disposition of his soul turns all those talents to the improvement of the plea∣sures of a good life. His style cloaths philosophy in a dress almost poetick, and his readers enjoy in full perfection the advantage, while they are reading him, of being what he is. The plea∣sing representation of the animal pow∣ers in the beginning of his work, and
<PB N="135" REF="163"/>
his consideration of the nature of man with the addition of reason, in the sub∣sequent discourse, impresses upon the mind a strong satisfaction in it self, and gratitude towards him who bestowed that superiority over the brute world. These thoughts had such an effect up∣on the author himself, that he has end∣ed his discourse with a prayer. This adoration has a sublimity in it befitting his character, and the emotions of his heart flow from wisdom and know∣ledge. I thought it would be proper for a <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper, and have trans∣lated it, to make you a present of it. I have not, as the translator was obli∣ged to do, confined my self to an exact version from the original, but have en∣deavoured to express the spirit of it, by taking the liberty to render his thoughts in such a way as I should I have ut∣tered them if they had been my own. It has been observed, that the private letters of great men are the best pi∣ctures of their souls, but certainly their private devotions would be still more instructive, and I know not why they should not be as curious and entertain∣ing.</P>

If you insert this prayer, I know not but I may send you, for another occasion, one used by a very great wit of the last age, which has allusions to the errors of a very wild life, and I believe you will think is written with an uncommon spirit. The person whom I mean was an excellent writer, and the publication of this prayer of his may be, perhaps, some kind of anti∣dote against the infection in his other writings. But this supplication of the Bishop has in it a more happy and un∣troubled spirit; it is (if that is not say∣ing something too fond) the worship of an Angel concerned for those who had fallen, but himself still in the state of glory and innocence. The book ends with an act of devotion, to this effect:</P>
<P>O my God, if the greater number of mankind do not discover thee in that glorious show of nature which thou hast placed before our eyes, it is not because thou art far from every one of us; thou art present to us more than any one object which we touch with our hands; but our senses, and the passions which they produce in us, turn
<PB N="137" REF="165"/>
our attention from thee. Thy light shines in the midst of darkness, but the darkness comprehends it not. Thou, O Lord, dost every where display thy self. Thou shinest in all thy works, but art not regarded by heedless and unthinking man. The whole creation talks aloud of thee, and eccho's with the repetitions of thy holy name. But such is our insensibility, that we are deaf to the great and universal voice of nature. Thou art every where about us, and within us; but we wander from our selves, become strangers to our own souls, and do not apprehend thy presence. O thou, who art the eternal fountain of light and beauty, who art the ancient of days, without beginning and without end; O thou, who art the life of all that truly live, those can never fail to find thee, who seek for thee within themselves. But alas, the very gifts which thou bestow∣est upon us, do so employ our thoughts, that they hinder us from perceiving the hand which conveys them to us. We live by thee, and yet we live without thinking of thee; but, O Lord, what is life in the ignorance of thee? A dead
<PB N="138" REF="166"/>
unactive piece of matter, a flower that withers, a river that glides away, a pa∣lace that hastens to its ruin, a picture made up of fading colours, a mass of shining oar, strike our imaginations, and make us sensible of their Ex∣istence. We regard them as objects capable of giving us pleasure, not con∣sidering that thou conveyest through them all the pleasure which we ima∣gine they give us. Such vain empty objects that are only the shadows of Being, are proportioned to our low and groveling thoughts. That beauty which thou hast poured out on thy creation, is as a veil which hides thee from our eyes. As thou art a Being too pure and exalted to pass through our senses, thou art not regarded by men, who have debased their nature, and have made themselves like the beasts that perish. So infatuated are they, that, notwithstanding they know what is wisdom and virtue, which have nei∣ther sound, nor colour, nor smell, nor taste, nor figure, nor any other sensi∣ble quality, they can doubt of thy Ex∣istence, because thou art not appre∣hended by the grosser organs of sense.
<PB N="139" REF="167"/>
Wretches that we are! we consider shadows as realities, and truth as a phantome. That which is nothing is all to us, and that which is all appears to us nothing. What do we see in all nature but thee, O my God! thou, and only thou, appearest in every thing. When I consider thee, O Lord, I am swallowed up and lost in contempla∣tion of thee. Every thing besides thee, even my own existence, vanishes and disappears in the contemplation of thee. I am lost to my self, and fall into no∣thing, when I think on thee. The man who does not see thee, has beheld nothing; he who does not taste thee, has a relish of nothing. His Being is vain, and his life but a dream. Set up thy self, O Lord, set up thy self that we may behold thee. As wax con∣sumes before the fire, and as the smoke is driven away, so let thine enemies va∣nish out of thy presence. How un∣happy is that Soul who, without the sense of thee, has no God, no hope, no comfort to support him? but how happy the man who searches, sighs, and thirsts after thee! but he only is fully happy on whom thou liftest up the
<PB N="140" REF="168"/>
light of thy countenance, whose tears thou hast wiped away, and who enjoys, in thy loving-kindness the completion of all his desires. How long, how long, O Lord, shall I wait for that day, when I shall possess, in thy presence, fullness of joy and pleasures for ever∣more? O my God, in this pleasing hope, my bones rejoice and cry out, Who is like unto thee! my heart melts away, and my soul faints within me, when I look up to thee who art the God of my life, and my portion to all eternity.</P>

<P>IT is very reasonable to believe, that part of the pleasure which happy minds shall enjoy in a future state, will a∣rise from an enlarged contemplation of the Divine Wisdom in the government of the world, and a discovery of the se∣cret and amazing steps of Providence, from the beginning to the end of time. Nothing seems to be an entertainment more adapted to the nature of man, if we consider that curiosity is one of the strongest and most lasting appetites im∣planted in us, and that admiration is one of our most pleasing passions; and what a perpetual succession of enjoyments will be afforded to both these, in a scene so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge and various as shall then be laid
<PB N="142" REF="170"/>
open to our view in the society of supe∣rior Spirits, who perhaps will join with us in so delightful a prospect!</P>
<P>It is not impossible, on the contrary, that part of the punishment of such as are excluded from bliss, may consist not only in their being denied this privilege, but in having their appetites at the same time vastly encreased, without any satis∣faction afforded to them. In these, the vain pursuit of knowledge shall, perhaps, add to their infelicity, and bewilder them into labyrinths of error, darkness, distraction and uncertainty of every thing but their own evil state. <HI>Milton</HI> has thus repre∣sented the fallen Angels reasoning to∣gether in a kind of respite from their torments, and creating to themselves a new disquiet amidst their very amuse∣ments; he could not properly have de∣scribed the sports of condemned Spirits, without that cast of horror and melan∣choly he has so judiciously mingled with them.</P>
<Q><L>Others apart sate on a hill retir'd,</L>
<L>In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high</L>
<L>Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,</L>
<L>Fixt Fate, Freewill, Foreknowledge absolute,</L>
<L>And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="143" REF="171"/>In our present condition, which is a middle state, our minds are, as it were, chequered with truth and falshood; and as our faculties are narrow and our views imperfect, it is impossible but our curio∣sity must meet with many repulses. The business of mankind in this life being ra∣ther to act than to know, their portion of knowledge is dealt to them accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that the reason of the Inquisitive has so long been exerci∣sed with difficulties, in accounting for the promiscuous distribution of good and evil to the virtuous and the wicked in this world. From hence come all those pathetical complaints of so many tragi∣cal events, which happen to the wise and the good; and of such surprizing prosperity, which is often the reward of the guilty and the foolish; that reason is sometimes puzzled, and at a loss what to pronounce upon so mysterious a dispen∣sation.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> expresses his abhorrence of some fables of the Poets, which seem to reflect on the Gods as the authors of injustice; and lays it down as a principle, that
<PB N="144" REF="172"/>
whatever is permitted to befal a just man, whether poverty, sickness, or any of those things which seem to be evils, shall either in life or death conduce to his good. My reader will observe how a∣greeable this maxim is to what we find delivered by a greater authority. <HI>Seneca</HI> has written a discourse purposely on this subject, in which he takes pains, after the doctrine of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> to shew, that adversity is not in itself an evil; and mentions a noble saying of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> That <HI>nothing would be more unhappy than a man who had never known affliction.</HI> He compares prosperity to the indulgence of a fond mother to a child, which often proves his ruin; but the affection of the Divine Being to that of a wise father, who would have his sons exercised with labour, disappointment, and pain, that they may gather strength, and improve their fortitude. On this occasion the Philosopher rises into that celebrated sen∣timent, that there is not on earth a spe∣ctacle more worthy the regard of a Cre∣ator intent on his works, than a brave man superior to his sufferings; to which he adds, that it must be a pleasure to <HI>Ju∣piter</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="173"/>
himself to look down from heaven, and see <HI>Cato</HI> amidst the ruins of his coun∣try preserving his integrity</P>
<P>This thought will appear yet more reasonable, if we consider human life as a state of probation, and adversity as the post of honour in it, assigned often to the best and most select Spirits.</P>
<P>But what I would chiefly insist on here, is, that we are not at present in a proper situation to judge of the coun∣sels by which Providence acts, since but little arrives at our knowledge, and even that little we discern imperfectly; or ac∣cording to the elegant figure in Holy Writ, <HI>We see but in part, and as in a glass darkly.</HI> It is to be considered, that Pro∣vidence in its oeconomy regards the whole system of time and things together, so that we cannot discover the beautiful connections between incidents which lie widely separated in time, and by losing so many links of the chain, our reason∣ings become broken and imperfect. Thus those parts in the moral world which have not an absolute, may yet have a relative beauty, in respect of some other parts concealed from us, but open to his eye before whom <HI>Past, Present,</HI> and <HI>To
<PB N="146" REF="174"/>
come,</HI> are set together in one point of view: and those events, the permission of which seems now to accuse his good∣ness, may in the consummation of things both magnify his goodness, and exalt his wisdom. And this is enough to check our presumption, since it is in vain to apply our measures of regularity to mat∣ters of which we know neither the an∣tecedents nor the consequents, the be∣ginning nor the end.</P>
<P>I shall relieve my readers from this abstracted thought, by relating here a <HI>Jewish</HI> tradition concerning <HI>Moses,</HI> which seems to be a kind of parable, illustra∣ting what I have last mentioned. That great Prophet, it is said, was called up by a voice from heaven to the top of a mountain; where, in a conference with the Supreme Being, he was permitted to propose to him some questions concern∣ing his administration of the universe. In the midst of this Divine Colloquy he was commanded to look down on the plain below. At the foot of the moun∣tain there issued out a clear spring of water, at which a soldier alighted from his horse to drink. He was no sooner gone than a little boy came to the same
<PB N="147" REF="175"/>
place, and finding a purse of gold which the Soldier had dropped, took it up and went away with it. Immediately after this came an infirm old man, weary with age and travelling, and having quenched his thirst, sat down to rest himself by the side of the spring. The soldier missing his purse returns to search for it, and demands it of the old man, who affirms he had not seen it, and ap∣peals to heaven in witness of his inno∣cence. The Soldier, not believing his protestation, kills him. <HI>Moses</HI> fell on his face with horror and amazement, when the Divine Voice thus prevented his ex∣postulation;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">Be not surprized, <HI>Moses,</HI> nor ask why the Judge of the whole earth has suffer'd this thing to come to pass: The child is the occasion that the blood of the old man is spilt; but know, that the old man whom thou saw'st, was the murderer of that child's father.</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE famous <HI>Gratian,</HI> in his little book wherein he lays down max∣ims for a man's advancing himself at court, advises his reader to associate him∣self with the fortunate, and to shun the company of the unfortunate; which not∣withstanding the baseness of the precept to an honest mind, may have something useful in it for those who push their in∣terest in the world. It is certain a great part of what we call good or ill fortune, rises out of right or wrong measures nd schemes of life. When I hear a man complain of his being unfortunate in all his undertakings, I shrewdly suspect him for a very weak man in his affairs. In conformity with this way of thinking, Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> used to say, that un∣fortunate and imprudent were but two words for the same thing. As the Car∣dinal himself had a great share both of prudence and good-fortune, his famous antagonist, the Count <HI>d'Olivarez,</HI> was disgraced at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> be∣cause it was alledged against him that he
<PB N="149" REF="177"/>
had never any success in his undertakings. This, says an eminent author, was <HI>indi∣rectly</HI> accusing him of Imprudence.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> recommended <HI>Pompey</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> for their General upon three ac∣counts, as he was a man of courage, con∣duct, and good-fortune. It was, perhaps, for the reason above mentioned, namely, that a series of good-fortune supposes a prudent management in the person whom it befalls, that not only <HI>Sylla</HI> the Dicta∣tor, but several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, as is still to be seen upon their medals, among their other titles, gave them∣selves that of <HI>Felix</HI> or fortunate. The Heathens, indeed, seem to have valued a man more for his good-fortune than for any other quality, which I think is very natural for those who have not a strong belief of another world. For how can I conceive a man crowned with ma∣ny distinguishing blessings, that has not some extraordinary fund of merit and perfection in him, which lies open to the Supreme Eye, tho' perhaps it is not dis∣covered by my observation? What is the reason <HI>Homer</HI>'s and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s heroes do not form a resolution, or strike a blow, with∣out the conduct and direction of some
<PB N="150" REF="178"/>
Deity? Doubtless, because the Poets esteemed it the greatest honour to be fa∣voured by the Gods, and thought the best way of praising a man was to re∣count those favours which naturally im∣plied an extraordinary merit in the per∣son on whom they descended.</P>
<P>Those who believe a future state of rewards and punishments act very absurd∣ly, if they form their opinions of a man's merit from his successes. But certainly, if I thought the whole circle of our Be∣ing was concluded between our births and deaths, I should think a man's good-fortune the measure and standard of his real merit, since Providence would have no opportunity of rewarding his virtue and perfections, but in the present life. A virtuous unbeliever, who lies under the pressure of misfortunes, has reason to cry out, as they say <HI>Brutus</HI> did a little before his death, <HI>O Virtue, I have wor∣shipped thee as a substantial good, but I find thou art an empty name.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our first point: Tho' prudence does undoubtedly in a great measure produce our good or ill-fortune in the world, it is certain there are ma∣ny unforeseen accidents and occurrences,
<PB N="151" REF="179"/>
which very often pervert the finest schemes that can be laid by human wis∣dom. The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. No∣thing less than Infinite Wisdom can have an absolute command over Fortune; the highest degree of it which man can pos∣sess, is by no means equal to fortuitous events, and to such contingencies as may rise in the prosecution of our affairs. Nay, it very often happens, that prudence, which has always in it a great mixture of caution, hinders a man from being so fortunate as he might possibly have been without it. A person who only aims at what is likely to succeed, and follows closely the dictates of humane prudence, never meets with those great and unfore∣seen successes, which are often the effect of a sanguine temper, or a more happy rashness; and this perhaps may be the reason, that according to the common observation, Fortune, like other females, delights rather in favouring the young than the old.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, since man is so short-sighted a creature, and the accidents which may happen to him so various, I cannot but be of Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI>'s opinion
<PB REF="180"/>
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nother case, that were there any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t of a Providence, yet it certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ld be very desirable there should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h a Being of infinite wisdom and goodness, on whose direction we might rely in the conduct of human life.</P>
<P>It is a great presumption to ascribe our successes to our own management, and not to esteem our selves upon any blessing, rather as it is the bounty of heaven, than the acquisition of our own prudence. I am very well pleased with a Medal which was struck by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a little after the defeat of the invincible Armada, to perpetuate the memory of that extraordinary event. It is well known how the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and others, who were the enemies of that great Princess, to derogate from her glory, ascribed the ruin of their fleet rather to the violence of storms and tem∣pests, than to the bravery of the <HI>English.</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> instead of looking up∣on this as a diminution of her honour, valued herself upon such a signal favour of Providence, and accordingly in the reverse of the Medal above mentioned has represented a fleet beaten by a tempest, and falling foul upon one another, with
<PB N="153" REF="181"/>
that religious inscription, <HI>Afflavit deus &amp; dissipantur. He blew with his wind, and they were scattered.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarked of a famous <HI>Grecian</HI> Ge∣neral, whose name I cannot at present recollect, and who had been a particular favourite of Fortune, that upon recount∣ing his victories among his friends, he added at the end of several great actions, <HI>And in this Fortune had no share.</HI> After which it is observed in history, that he never prospered in any thing he under∣took.</P>
<P>As arrogance, and a conceitedness of our own abilities, are very shocking and of∣fensive to men of sense and virtue, we may be sure they are highly displeasing to that Being who delights in an humble mind, and by several of his dispensations seems purposely to show us, that our own schemes or prudence have no share in our advancements.</P>
<P>Since on this subject I have already ad∣mitted several quotations which have oc∣curred to my memory upon writing this paper, I will conclude it with a little <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Fable. A drop of water fell out of a cloud into the sea, and finding it self lost in such an immensity of fluid matter,
<PB N="154" REF="182"/>
broke out into the following reflection:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Alas! what an insignificant creature am I in this prodigious ocean of wa∣ters; my existence is of no concern to the universe, I am reduced to a kind of nothing, and am less than the least of the works of God.'</Q>
It so happened that an Oyster, which lay in the neigh∣bourhood of this Drop, chanced to gape and swallow it up in the midst of this its humble Soliloquy. The Drop, says the fable, lay a great while hardening in the shell, 'till by degrees it was ripened into a pearl, which falling into the hands of a Diver, after a long series of adventures, is at present that famous pearl which is fixed on the top of the <HI>Persian</HI> dia∣dem.</P>

<P>MAN, considered in himself, is a ve∣ry helpless and a very wretched Being. He is subject every moment to the greatest calamities and misfortunes. He is beset with dangers on all sides, and may become unhappy by numberless ca∣sualties,
<PB N="155" REF="183"/>
which he could not foresee, nor have prevented, had he foreseen them.</P>
<P>It is our comfort, while we are ob∣noxious to so many accidents, that we are under the care of one who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capa∣ble of annoying or offending us; who knows the assistance we stand in need of, and is always ready to bestow it on those who ask it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which such a creature bears to so infinitely wise and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the blessings and conveniencies of life, and an habitual trust in him for de∣liverance out of all such dangers and difficulties as may befall us.</P>
<P>The Man, who always lives in this disposition of mind, has not the same dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who considers himself ab∣stractedly from this relation to the Su∣preme Being. At the same time that he reflects upon his own weakness and im∣perfection, he comforts himself with the contemplation of those divine attributes, which are employed for his safety and his welfare. He finds his want of fore∣sight
<PB N="156" REF="184"/>
made up by the Omniscience of him who is his support. He is not sensi∣ble of his own want of strength, when he knows that his Helper is Almighty. In short, the person who has a firm trust on the Supreme Being is Powerful in <HI>his</HI> Power, Wise by <HI>his</HI> Wisdom, Happy by <HI>his</HI> Happiness. He reaps the benefit of every Divine Attribute, and loses his own insufficiency in the fullness of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more easie to us, we are commanded to put our trust in him, who is thus able to relieve and suc∣cour us; The Divine Goodness having made such a reliance a duty, notwith∣standing we should have been miserable had it been forbidden us.</P>
<P>Among several motives, which might be made use of to recommend this duty to us, I shall only take notice of those that follow.</P>
<P>The first and strongest is, that we are promised, He will not fail those who put their trust in him.</P>
<P>But without considering the superna∣tural blessing which accompanies this duty, we may observe that it has a na∣tural tendency to its own reward, or in
<PB N="157" REF="185"/>
other words, that this firm trust and con∣fidence in the great Disposer of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing it manfully. A person who believes he has his succour at hand, and that he acts in sight of his friend, often exerts him∣self beyond his abilities, and does won∣ders that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with such a confi∣dence of success. I could produce in∣stances from history, of Generals, who out of a belief that they were under the protection of some invisible assistant, did not only encourage their Soldiers to do their utmost, but have acted themselves beyond what they would have done, had they not been inspired by such a be∣lief. I might in the same manner shew how such a trust in the assistance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces pa∣tience, hope, chearfulness, and all other dispositions of mind that alleviate those calamities which we are not able to re∣move.</P>
<P>The practice of this virtue administers great comfort to the mind of man in times of poverty and affliction, but most of all in the hour of death. When the
<PB N="158" REF="186"/>
soul is hovering in the last moments of its separation, when it is just entring on another state of Existence, to converse with scenes, and objects, and compani∣ons that are altogether new, what can support her under such tremblings of thought, such fear, such anxiety, such apprehensions, but the casting of all her cares upon him who first gave her Being, who has conducted her through one stage of it, and will be always with her to guide and comfort her in her progress through eternity?</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> has very beautifully represent∣ed this steady reliance on God Almighty in his twenty third Psalm, which is a kind of <HI>Pastoral</HI> hymn, and filled with those allusions which are usual in that kind of writing. As the poetry is very exquisite, I shall present my reader with the following Translation of it.</P>

<BIBL>Incerti Autoris apud Aul. Gell.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is of the last importance to season the passions of a child with Devo∣tion, which seldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it. Though it may seem extinguished for a while by the cares of the world, the heats of youth, or the allurements of vice, it generally breaks out and dis∣covers it self again as soon as discre∣tion, consideration, age, or misfortunes have brought the man to himself. The fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and smo∣thered.</P>
<P>A state of temperance, sobriety, and justice, without devotion, is a cold, life∣less,
<PB N="161" REF="189"/>
insipid condition of virtue; and is rather to be styled Philosophy than Reli∣gion. Devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more sub∣lime ideas than any that are to be met with in the most exalted science; and at the same time warms and agitates the Soul more than sensual pleasure.</P>
<P>It has been observed by some writers, that man is more distinguished from the animal world by Devotion than by Rea∣son, as several brute creatures discover in their actions something like a faint glimmering of reason, though they be∣tray in no single circumstance of their behaviour any thing that bears the least affinity to devotion. It is certain, the propensity of the mind to religious wor∣ship, the natural tendency of the soul to fly to some superior Being for succour in dangers and distresses, the gratitude to an invisible Superintendent which ari∣ses in us upon receiving any extraordina∣ry and unexpected good fortune, the acts of love and admiration with which the thoughts of men are so wonderfully trans∣ported in meditating upon the Divine Perfections, and the universal concur∣rence of all the nations under heaven in
<PB N="162" REF="190"/>
the great article of adoration, plainly shew that devotion or religious worship must be the effect of a tradition from some first founder of mankind, or that it is conformable to the natural light of reason, or that it proceeds from an in∣stinct implanted in the soul it self. For my part, I look upon all these to be the concurrent causes, but which ever of them shall be assigned as the principle of Divine Worship, it manifestly points to a Supreme Being as the first author of it.</P>
<P>I may take some other opportunity of considering those particular forms and methods of devotion which are taught us by Christianity; but shall here observe into what errors even this Divine Prin∣ciple may sometimes lead us, when it is not moderated by that right reason which was given us as the guide of all our actions.</P>
<P>The two great errors into which a mistaken devotion may betray us, are Enthusiasm and Superstition.</P>
<P>There is not a more melancholy ob∣ject than a man who has his head turned with religious enthusiasm. A person that is crazed, tho' with pride or malice, is
<PB N="163" REF="191"/>
a sight very mortifying to human na∣ture; but when the distemper arises from any indiscreet fervors of devotion, or too intense an application of the mind to its mistaken duties, it deserves our compas∣sion in a more particular manner. We may however learn this lesson from it, that since devotion it self (which one would be apt to think could not be too warm) may disorder the mind, unless its heats are tempered with caution and pru∣dence, we should be particularly careful to keep our reason as cool as possible, and to guard our selves in all parts of life against the influence of passion, imagina∣tion, and constitution.</P>
<P>Devotion, when it does not lie under the check of reason, is very apt to de∣generate into Enthusiasm. When the mind finds herself very much enflamed with her devotions, she is too much in∣clined to think they are not of her own kindling, but blown up with something Divine within her. If she indulges this thought too far, and humours the grow∣ing passion, she at last flings herself into imaginary raptures and ecstasies; and when once she fancies herself under the influence of a Divine Impulse, it is no
<PB N="164" REF="192"/>
wonder if she slights human ordinances, and refuses to comply with any esta∣blished form of religion, as thinking her self directed by a much superior guide.</P>
<P>As Enthusiasm is a kind of excess in devotion, Superstition is the excess not only of devotion, but of religion in ge∣neral; according to an old Heathen say∣ing, quoted by <HI>Aulus Gellius, Religentem esse oportet; Religiosum nefas</HI>; A man should be religious, not superstitious; for as the author tells us, <HI>Nigidius</HI> ob∣served upon this passage, that the <HI>Latin</HI> words which terminate in <HI>osus</HI> generally imply vitious characters, and the having of any quality to an excess.</P>
<P>An Enthusiast in religion is like an ob∣stinate clown, a superstitious man like an insipid courtier. Enthusiasm has some∣thing in it of madness, Superstition of folly. Most of the Sects that fall short of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have in them strong tinctures of Enthusiasm, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion is one huge over-grown body of childish and idle Su∣perstitions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Church seems indeed irrecoverably lost in this particu∣lar. If an absurd dress or behaviour be
<PB N="165" REF="193"/>
introduced in the world, it will soon be found out and discarded: On the con∣trary, a habit or ceremony, tho' never so ridiculous, which has taken sanctuary in the Church, sticks in it for ever. A <HI>Gothic</HI> Bishop, perhaps, thought it pro∣per to repeat such a form in such parti∣cular shoes or slippers; another fancied it would be very decent if such a part of publick devotions were performed with a Mitre on his head, and a Crosier in his hand: To this a brother <HI>Van∣dal,</HI> as wise as the others, adds an antick dress, which he conceived would allude very aptly to such and such mysteries, 'till by degrees the whole office has de∣generated into an empty show.</P>
<P>Their successors see the vanity and in∣convenience of these ceremonies; but in∣stead of reforming, perhaps add others, which they think more significant, and which take possession in the same man∣ner, and are never to be driven out after they have been once admitted. I have seen the Pope officiate at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, where, for two hours together, he was busied in putting on or off his different accoutrements, according to the different parts he was to act in them.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="194"/>Nothing is so glorious in the eyes of mankind, and ornamental to human na∣ture, setting aside the infinite advantages which arise from it, as a strong steady masculine piety; but Enthusiasm and Su∣perstition are the weaknesses of human reason, that expose us to the scorn and derision of Infidels, and sink us even be∣low the Beasts that perish.</P>
<P>Idolatry may be looked upon as ano∣ther error 
arising from mistaken Devo∣tion; but because reflections
on that sub∣ject would be of no use to an <HI>English</HI>
reader I shall not enlarge upon it.</P>

<P>IN my last <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper I laid down some 
thoughts upon Devotion in ge∣neral, and shall here shew 
what were the notions of the most refined Heathens on this 
subject, as they are represented in <HI>Plato</HI>'s dialogue upon Prayer, enti∣tuled, <HI>Alcibiades the Second,</HI> which doubt∣less gave occasion to <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s tenth Sa∣tyr,
<PB N="167" REF="195"/>
and to the second Satyr of <HI>Persius</HI>; as the last of these authors has almost tran∣scribed the preceding dialogue, enti∣tuled, <HI>Alcibiades the First,</HI> in his fourth Satyr.</P>
<P>The speakers in this dialogue upon Prayer, are <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Alcibiades</HI>; and the substance of it (when drawn toge∣ther out of the intricacies and digressi∣ons) as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates</HI> meeting his pupil <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> as he was going to his devotions, and observing his eyes to be fixed upon the earth with great seriousness and attenti∣on, tells him, that he had reason to be thoughtful on that occasion, since it was possible for a man to bring down evils upon himself by his own Prayers, and that those things which the Gods send him in answer to his petitions might turn to his destruction: This, says he, may not only happen when a man prays for what he knows is mischievous in its own nature, as <HI>Oedipus</HI> implored the Gods to sow dissention between his sons, but when he prays for what he believes would be for his good, and against what he believes would be to his detriment. This the Philosopher shews must necessa∣rily
<PB N="168" REF="196"/>
happen among us, since most men are blinded with ignorance, prejudice, or passion, which hinder them from seeing such things as are really beneficial to them. For an instance, he asks <HI>Alci∣biades,</HI> Whether he would not be tho∣roughly pleased and satisfied if that God to whom he was going to address him∣self, should promise to make him the so∣vereign of the whole earth? <HI>Alcibiades</HI> answers, That he should doubtless look upon such a promise as the greatest fa∣vour that could be bestowed upon him. <HI>Socrates</HI> then asks him, If after receiving this great favour he would be contented to lose his life? or if he would receive it though he was sure he should make an ill use of it? To both which questi∣ons <HI>Alcibiades</HI> answers in the negative. <HI>Socrates</HI> then shews him, from the ex∣amples of others, how these might pro∣bably be the effects of such a blessing. He then adds, That other reputed pieces of good fortune, as that of having a son, or procuring the highest post in a go∣vernment, are subject to the like fatal consequences; which nevertheless, says he, men ardently desire, and would not fail to pray for, if they thought their
<PB N="169" REF="197"/>
prayers might be effectual for the ob∣taining of them.</P>
<P>Having established this great point, That all the most apparent blessings in this life are obnoxious to such dreadful consequences, and that no man knows what in its events would prove to him a blessing or a curse, he teaches <HI>Alcibiades</HI> after what manner he ought to pray.</P>
<P>In the first place, he recommends to him, as the model of his devotions, a short prayer, which a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet com∣posed for the use of his friends, in the following words; <HI>O</HI> Jupiter, <HI>give us those things which are good for us, whether they are such things as we pray for, or such things as we do not pray for; and remove from us those things which are hurtful, though they are such things as we pray for.</HI></P>
<P>In the second place, that his Disciple may ask such things as are expedient for him, he shews him, that it is absolutely necessary to apply himself to the study of true wisdom, and to the knowledge of that which is his chief good, and the most suitable to the excellency of his nature.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="198"/>In the third and last place he informs him, that the best methods he could make use of to draw down blessings up∣on himself, and to render his prayers ac∣ceptable, would be to live in a con∣stant practice of his duty towards the Gods, and towards men. Under this head he very much recommends a form of Prayer the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> made use of, in which they petition the Gods, <HI>to give them all good things, so long as they were virtuous.</HI> Under this head likewise he gives a very remarkable account of an Oracle to the following purpose.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the war with the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> received many defeats both by sea and land, they sent a message to the oracle of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> to ask the reason why they who erected so ma∣ny temples to the Gods, and adorned them with such costly offerings; why they who had instituted so many festi∣vals, and accompanied them with such pomps and ceremonies; in short, why they who had slain so many Hecatombs at their altars, should be less successful than the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> who fell so short of them in all these particulars. To this, says he, the Oracle made the following
<PB N="171" REF="199"/>
reply; <HI>I am better pleased with the prayer of the</HI> Lacedemonians <HI>than with all the oblations of the</HI> Greeks. As this prayer implied and encouraged virtue in those who made it; the Philosopher proceeds to shew how the most vicious man might be devout, so far as victims could make him, but that his Offerings were regard∣ed by the Gods as bribes, and his peti∣tions as blasphemies. He likewise quotes on this occasion two verses out of <HI>Homer,</HI> in which the Poet says, That the scent of the <HI>Trojan</HI> sacrifices was carried up to heaven by the winds; but that it was not acceptable to the Gods, who were displeased with <HI>Priam</HI> and all his People.</P>
<P>The conclusion of this dialogue is ve∣ry remarkable. <HI>Socrates</HI> having deterr'd <HI>Alcibiades</HI> from the prayers and sacrifice which he was going to offer, by setting forth the above-mentioned difficulties of performing that duty as he ought, adds these words, <HI>We must therefore wait 'till such time as we may learn how we ought to behave our selves towards the Gods, and towards men.</HI> But when will that time come, says <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and who is it will instruct us? For I would fain see this man, whoever he is. It is one, says
<PB N="172" REF="200"/>
<HI>Socrates,</HI> who takes care of you; but as <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that <HI>Minerva</HI> removed the mist from <HI>Diomedes</HI> his eyes, that he might plainly discover both Gods and men; so the darkness that hangs upon your mind must be removed, before you are able to discern what is good and what is evil. Let him remove from my mind, says <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> the darkness, and what else he pleases; I am determined to refuse nothing he shall order me, whoever he is, so that I may become the better man by it. The remaining part of this dialogue is very obscure: There is something in it that would make us think <HI>Socrates</HI> hinted at himself, when he spoke of this Divine Teacher who was to come into the world, did he not own that he himself was in this respect as much at a loss, and in as great distress as the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>Some learned men look upon this conclusion as a prediction of our Savi∣our, or at least that <HI>Socrates,</HI> like the High-priest, prophesied unknowingly, and pointed at that Divine Teacher who was to come into the world some ages after him. However that may be, we find that this great Philosopher saw, by the
<PB N="173" REF="201"/>
light of reason, that it was suitable to the goodness of the Divine Nature, to send a Person into the world who should instruct mankind in the duties of reli∣gion, and, in particular, teach them how to Pray.</P>
<P>Whoever reads this abstract of <HI>Plato</HI>'s discourse on Prayer, will, I believe, na∣turally make this reflection, That the great Founder of our religion, as well by his own example, as in the form of prayer which he taught his disciples, did not only keep up to those rules which the light of nature had suggested to this great Philosopher, but instructed his disciples in the whole extent of this duty, as well as of all others. He directed them to the proper object of adoration, and taught them, according to the third rule above-mentioned, to apply themselves to him in their closets, without show or ostentation, and to worship him in spirit and in truth. As the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in their form of Prayer implored the Gods in ge∣neral to give them all good things so long as they were virtuous, we ask in particular <HI>that our offences may be forgiven as we forgive those of others.</HI> If we look into the second Rule which <HI>Socrates</HI> has
<PB N="174" REF="202"/>
prescribed, namely, That we should ap∣ply our selves to the knowledge of such things as are best for us, this too is ex∣plained at large in the doctrines of the Gospel, where we are taught in several instances to regard those things as curses, which appear as blessings in the eye of the world; and on the contrary, to e∣steem those things as blessings, which to the generality of mankind appear as curses. Thus in the form which is pre∣scribed to us we only pray for that hap∣piness which is our chief good, and the great end of our Existence, when we pe∣tition the Supreme Being for <HI>the coming of his kingdom,</HI> being sollicitous for no other temporal blessing but our <HI>daily sustenance.</HI> On the other side, we pray against nothing but Sin, and a∣gainst <HI>Evil</HI> in general, leaving it with Omniscience to determine what is really such. If we look into the first of <HI>Socrates</HI> his rules of prayer, in which he recom∣mends the above-mentioned form of the antient Poet, we find that form not only comprehended, but very much improved in the petition, wherein we pray to the Supreme Being that <HI>his Will may be done:</HI> which is of the same force with that
<PB N="175" REF="203"/>
form which our Saviour used, when he prayed against the most painful and most ignominious of deaths, <HI>Nevertheless not my Will, but thine be done.</HI> This compre∣hensive petition is the most humble, as well as the most prudent, that can be offered up from the creature to his Creator, as it supposes the Supreme Be∣ing wills nothing but what is for our good, and that he knows better than our selves what is so.</P>

<BIBL>Hor.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REligion may be considered under two general heads. The first com∣prehends what we are to believe, the other what we are to practise. By those things which we are to believe, I mean whatever is revealed to us in the Holy Writings, and which we could not have obtained the knowledge of by the light of nature; by the things which we are to practise, I mean all those duties to which we are directed by reason or natural religion. The first of these I shall distinguish by the name of Faith, the se∣cond by that of Morality.</P>
<P>If we look into the more serious part of mankind, we find many who lay so
<PB N="177" REF="205"/>
great a stress upon faith, that they neg∣lect morality; and many who build so much upon morality, that they do not pay a due regard to faith. The perfect man should be defective in neither of these particulars, as will be very evident to those who consider the benefits which arise from each of them, and which I shall make the subject of this day's paper.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this general division of Christian duty into morality and faith, and that they have both their peculiar ex∣cellencies, the first has the pre-eminence in several respects.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because the greatest part of mo∣rality (as I have stated the notion of it) is of a fixt eternal nature, and will en∣dure when faith shall fail, and be lost in conviction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Because a Person may be qua∣lified to do greater good to mankind, and become more beneficial to the world, by morality, without faith, than by faith without morality.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because morality gives a grea∣ter perfection to humane nature, by qui∣eting the mind, moderating the passions, and advancing the happiness of every man in his private capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="206"/><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Because the rule of morality is much more certain than that of faith, all the civilized nations of the world agreeing in the great points of mora∣lity, as much as they differ in those of faith.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Because infidelity is not of so malignant a nature as immorality; or to put the same Reason in another light, because it is generally owned, there may be salvation for a virtuous Infidel, (particularly in the case of invincible ignorance) but none for a vicious Be∣liever.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Because faith seems to draw its principal, if not all its excellency, from the influence it has upon morality; as we shall see more at large, if we con∣sider wherein consists the excellency of faith, or the belief of revealed religion; and this I think is,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In explaining and carrying to greater heights, several points of mora∣lity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In furnishing new and stron∣ger motives to enforce the practice of morality.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In giving us more amiable ideas of the Supreme Being, more en∣dearing
<PB N="179" REF="207"/>
notions of one another, and a truer state of our selves, both in regard to the grandeur and vileness of our na∣tures.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> By shewing us the blackness and deformity of vice, which in the Christian system is so very great, that he who is possessed of all perfection and the Sovereign Judge of it, is represented by several of our Divines as hating sin to the same degree that he loves the Sacred Person who was made the propitiation of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In being the ordinary and pre∣scribed method of making morality ef∣fectual to salvation.</P>
<P>I have only touched on these several heads, which every one who is conver∣sant in discourses of this nature will ea∣sily enlarge upon in his own thoughts, and draw conclusions from them which may be useful to him in the conduct of his life. One I am sure is so obvious, that he cannot miss it, namely that a man cannot be perfect in his scheme of morality, who does not strengthen and support it with that of the Christian faith.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="208"/>Besides this, I shall lay down two or three other maxims which I think we may deduce from what has been said.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That we should be particularly cautious of making any thing an article of faith, which does not contribute to the confirmation or improvement of mo∣rality.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That no article of faith can be true and authentick, which weakens or subverts the practical part of religion, or what I have hitherto called mora∣lity.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the greatest friend of morality, or natural religion, cannot pos∣sibly apprehend any danger from embra∣cing Christianity, as it is preserved pure and uncorrupt in the doctrines of our na∣tional Church.</P>
<P>There is likewise another maxim which I think may be drawn from the forego∣ing considerations, which is this, that we should, in all dubious points, consi∣der any ill consequences that may arise from them, supposing they should be er∣roneous, before we give up our assent to them.</P>
<P>For example, in that disputable point of persecuting men for conscience sake,
<PB N="181" REF="209"/>
besides the imbittering their minds with hatred, indignation, and all the vehe∣mence of resentment, and ensnaring them to profess what they do not believe; we cut them off from the pleasures and ad∣vantages of society, afflict their bodies, distress their fortunes, hurt their reputa∣tions, ruin their families, make their lives painful, or put an end to them. Sure when I see such dreadful consequences rising from a principle, I would be as fully convinced of the truth of it, as of a mathematical demonstration, before I would venture to act upon it, or make it a part of my religion.</P>
<P>In this case the injury done our neigh∣bour is plain and evident, the principle that puts us upon doing it, of a dubious and disputable nature. Morality seems highly violated by the one, and whether or no a zeal for what a man thinks the true system of faith may justify it, is very uncertain. I cannot but think, if our religion produce charity as well as zeal, it will not be for shewing it self by such cruel instances. But, to conclude with the words of an excellent author, <HI>We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.</HI></P>

<P>IT was the common boast of the Hea∣then Philosophers, that by the effica∣cy of their several doctrines, they made humane nature resemble the Divine. How much mistaken soever they might be in the several means they proposed for this end, it must be owned that the design was great and glorious. The finest works of invention and imagination are of ve∣ry little weight, when put in the ba∣lance with what refines and exalts the rational mind. <HI>Longinus</HI> excuses <HI>Homer</HI> very handsomely, when he says the Poet made his Gods like men, that he might make his men appear like the Gods: But it must be allowed that several of the ancient Philosophers acted, as <HI>Cicero</HI> wishes <HI>Homer</HI> had done; they endeavour∣ed rather to make men like Gods, than Gods like men.</P>
<P>According to this general maxim in philosophy, some of them have endea∣voured to place men in such a state of pleasure, or indolence at least, as they
<PB N="183" REF="211"/>
vainly imagined the happiness of the Su∣preme Being to consist in. On the other hand, the most virtuous sect of Philo∣sophers have created a chimerical wise man, whom they made exempt from pas∣sion and pain, and thought it enough to pronounce him All-sufficient.</P>
<P>This last character, when divested of the glare of humane philosophy that sur∣rounds it, signifies no more, than that a good and wise man should so arm him∣self with patience, as not to yield tame∣ly to the violence of passion and pain; that he should learn so to suppress and contract his desires as to have few wants; and that he should cherish so many vir∣tues in his soul, as to have a perpetual source of pleasure in himself.</P>
<P>The Christian religion requires, that, after having framed the best Idea, we are able, of the Divine Nature, it should be our next care to conform our selves to it, as far as our imperfections will per∣mit. I might mention several passages in the Sacred Writings on this head, to which I might add many maxims and wise sayings of moral Authors among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="212"/>I shall only instance a remarkable pas∣sage, to this purpose, out of <HI>Julian</HI>'s <HI>Caesars.</HI> The Emperor having represent∣ed all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, with <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> the Great, as passing in review be∣fore the Gods, and striving for the su∣periority, lets them all drop, excepting <HI>Alexander, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Constantine.</HI> Each of these great heroes of antiquity lays in his claim for the upper place; and, in order to it, sets forth his actions after the most advantageous manner. But the Gods, instead of being dazzled with the lustre of their actions, enquire, by <HI>Mercury,</HI> into the proper motive and go∣verning principle that influenced them throughout the whole series of their lives and exploits. <HI>Alexander</HI> tells them, That his aim was to conquer: <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> That his was to gain the highest post in his country; <HI>Augustus,</HI> To govern well; <HI>Trajan,</HI> That his was the same as that of <HI>Alexander,</HI> namely, to conquer. The question, at length, was put to <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who replied, with great modesty, That <HI>it had always been his care to imitate the Gods.</HI> This conduct seems to have gained him the most votes and
<PB N="185" REF="213"/>
best place in the whole assembly. <HI>Mar∣cus Aurelius</HI> being afterwards asked to ex∣plain himself declares, That, by imita∣ting the Gods, he endeavoured to imi∣tate them in the use of his understanding, and of all other faculties; and, in parti∣cular, That it was always his study to have as few wants as possible in him∣self, and to do all the good he could to others.</P>
<P>Among the many methods by which revealed religion has advanced morality, this is one, That it has given us a more just and perfect idea of that Being whom every reasonable creature ought to imi∣tate. The young man, in a heathen Comedy, might justify his lewdness by the example of <HI>Jupiter</HI>; as, indeed, there was scarce any crime that might not be countenanced by those notions of the Deity which prevailed among the com∣mon people in the heathen world. Re∣vealed religion sets forth a proper ob∣ject for imitation, in that Being who is the pattern, as well as the source, of all spiritual perfection.</P>
<P>While we remain in this life, we are subject to innumerable temptations, which, if listen'd to, will make us deviate from
<PB N="186" REF="214"/>
reason and goodness, the only things wherein we can imitate the Supreme Be∣ing. In the next life we meet with no∣thing to excite our inclinations that doth not deserve them. I shall therefore dis∣miss my reader with this maxim, <HI>viz. Our happiness in this world proceeds from the suppression of our desires, but in the next world from the gratification of them.</HI></P>

<P>IT is usual with polemical writers to object ill designs to their adversaries. This turns their argument into satyr, which, instead of shewing an error in the understanding, tends only to expose the morals of those they write against. I shall not act after this manner with re∣spect to the <HI>Free-thinkers.</HI> Virtue, and the happiness of society, are the great ends which all men ought to promote, and some of that Sect would be thought to have at heart above the rest of mankind. But supposing those who make that pro∣fession to carry on a good design in the simplicity of their hearts, and according
<PB N="187" REF="215"/>
to their best knowledge, yet it is much to be feared, those well-meaning souls, while they endeavoured to recommend virtue, have in reality been advancing the interests of vice, which as I take to proceed from their ignorance of human nature, we may hope, when they become sensible of their mistake, they will, in consequence of that beneficent principle they pretend to act upon, reform their practice for the future.</P>
<P>The Sages whom I have in my eye speak of virtue as the most amiable thing in the world; but at the same time that they extol her Beauty, they take care to lessen her Portion. Such innocent crea∣tures are they, and so great strangers to the world, that they think this a likely method to increase the number of her admirers.</P>
<P>Virtue has in her self the most en∣gaging charms; and Christianity, as it places her in the strongest light, and adorned with all her native attractions, so it kindles a new fire in the Soul, by adding to them the unutterable rewards which attend her votaries in an eternal state. Or if there are men of a Saturnine and heavy complexion, who are not ea∣sily
<PB N="188" REF="216"/>
lifted up by hope, there is the pro∣spect of everlasting punishment to agitate their souls, and frighten them into the practice of virtue, and an aversion from vice.</P>
<P>Whereas your sober <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> tell you, that virtue indeed is beautiful, and vice deformed: the former deserves your love, and the latter your abhorrence; but then, it is for their own sake, or on account of the good and evil which im∣mediately attend them, and are insepa∣rable from their respective natures. As for the immortality of the Soul, or eter∣nal punishments and rewards, those are openly ridiculed, or rendered suspici∣ous by the most sly and laboured arti∣fice.</P>
<P>I will not say, these men act treache∣rously in the cause of virtue; but, will any one deny, that they act foolishly, who pretend to advance the interest of it by destroying or weakening the strong∣est motives to it, which are accommo∣dated to all capacities, and fitted to work on all dispositions, and enforcing those alone which can affect only a generous and exalted mind?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="217"/>Surely <HI>they</HI> must be destitute of passi∣on themselves, and unacquainted with the force it hath on the minds of others, who can imagine that the meer beauty of fortitude, temperance and justice, is suf∣ficient to sustain the mind of man in a severe course of self-denial against all the temptations of present profit and sen∣suality.</P>
<P>It is my opinion the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> should be treated as a sett of poor ignorant creatures, that have not sense to disco∣ver the excellency of religion; it being evident those men are no witches, nor likely to be guilty of any deep design, who proclaim aloud to the world, that they have less motives of honesty than the rest of their fellow-subjects; who have all the inducements to the exercise of any virtue which a <HI>Free-thinker</HI> can possibly have, and besides, the expecta∣tion of never-ending happiness or misery as the consequence of their choice.</P>
<P>Are not men actuated by their passi∣ons; and are not hope and fear the most powerful of our passions? and are there any objects which can rouse and awaken our hopes and fears, like those prospects that warm and penetrate the heart of a Chri∣stian,
<PB N="190" REF="218"/>
but are not regarded by a <HI>Free-thinker.</HI></P>
<P>It is not only a clear point, that a Christian breaks through stronger en∣gagements whenever he surrenders him∣self to commit a criminal action, and is stung with a sharper remorse after it, than a <HI>Free-thinker</HI>; but it should even seem that a man who believes no future state, would act a foolish part in being tho∣roughly honest. For what reason is there why such a one should postpone his own private interest or pleasure to the doing his duty? If a Christian foregoes some present advantage for the sake of his con∣science, he acts accountably, because it is with the view of gaining some greater future good. But he that, having no such view, should yet conscientiously deny himself a present good in any incident where he may save appearances, is alto∣gether as stupid as he that would trust him at such a juncture.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be said, that virtue is her own reward, that a natural gratifi∣cation attends good actions, which is a∣lone sufficient to excite men to the per∣formance of them. But although there is nothing more lovely than virtue, and
<PB N="191" REF="219"/>
the practice of it is the surest way to solid, natural happiness, even in this life; yet titles, estates, and fantastical pleasures, are more ardently sought after by most men, than the natural gratifications of a reasonable mind; and it cannot be de∣nied, that virtue and innocence are not always the readiest methods to attain that sort of happiness. Besides, the fumes of passion must be allayed, and reason must burn brighter than ordinary, to enable men to see and relish all the native beau∣ties and delights of a virtuous life. And tho' we should grant our <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> to be a sett of refined spirits, capable only of being enamoured of virtue, yet what would become of the bulk of mankind who have gross understandings, but live∣ly senses and strong passions? What a deluge of lust, and fraud, and violence would in a little time overflow the whole nation, if these wise advocates for mora∣lity were universally hearkened to? Last∣ly, opportunities do sometimes offer in which a man may wickedly make his fortune, or indulge a pleasure, without fear of temporal damage, either in repu∣tation, health, or fortune. In such cases what restraint do they lie under who have
<PB N="192" REF="220"/>
no regards beyond the grave? the inward compunctions of a wicked, as well as the joys of an upright mind, being grafted on the sense of another state.</P>
<P>The thought, <HI>that our Existence ter∣minates with this life,</HI> doth naturally check the soul in any generous pursuit, con∣tract her views, and fix them on tem∣porary and selfish ends. It dethrones the reason, extinguishes all noble and heroick sentiments, and subjects the mind to the slavery of every present passion. The wise Heathens of antiquity were not ig∣norant of this; hence they endeavoured by fables, and conjectures, and the glim∣merings of nature, to possess the minds of men with the belief of a future state, which has been since brought to light by the Gospel, and is now most incon∣sistently decry'd by a few weak men, who would have us believe that they promote Virtue by turning Religion in∣to ridicule.</P>

<P>TO one who regards things with a philosophical eye, and hath a Soul capable of being delighted with the sense that truth and knowledge prevail among men, it must be a grateful reflection to think that the sublimest truths, which among the Heathens only here and there one of brighter parts and more leisure than ordinary could attain to, are now grown familiar to the meanest in∣habitants of these nations.</P>
<P>Whence came this surprizing change, that regions formerly inhabited by igno∣rant and savage people should now out∣shine ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> and the other eastern countries, so renowned of old, in the most elevated notions of theology and morality? Is it the effect of our own parts and industry? Have our common mechanicks more refined understandings than the ancient Philosophers? It is ow∣ing to the God of truth, who came down from heaven, and condescended to be himself our Teacher. It is as we are <HI>Christians,</HI> that we profess more excel∣lent

<P>If there be any of the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> who are not direct Atheists, Charity would incline one to believe them igno∣rant of what is here advanced.

Is it possible for the mind of man to conceive a more august idea of the Deity than is set forth in the holy Scriptures? I shall throw together some passages relating to this subject, which I propose only as philosophical sentiments, to be considered by a <HI>Free-thinker.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Tho' there be that are called Gods, yet to us there is but one God. He made the Heaven, and Heaven of Hea∣vens, with all their host; the earth and all things that are therein; the seas and all that is therein; He said, Let them be, and it was so. He hath stretched forth the heavens. He hath founded the earth, and hung it upon nothing. He hath shut up the sea with doors, and said, Hitherto shalt thou
<PB N="195" REF="223"/>
come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be staid. The Lord is an invisible Spirit, in whom we live, and move, and have our Being. He is the fountain of life. He preserveth man and beast. He giveth food to all flesh. In his hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all man∣kind. The Lord maketh poor and ma∣keth rich. He bringeth low and lift∣eth up. He killeth and maketh alive. He woundeth and he healeth. By him Kings reign, and Princes decree justice, and not a sparrow falleth to the ground without him. All Angels, Authorities, and Powers are subject to him. He appointeth the Moon for seasons, and the Sun knoweth his going down. He thundereth with his voice, and direct∣eth it under the whole Heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. Fire and hail, snow and vapour, wind and storm, fulfil his word. The Lord is King for ever and ever, and his do∣minion is an everlasting dominion. The earth and the heavens shall perish, but thou, O Lord, remainest. They all shall wax old, as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and
<PB N="196" REF="224"/>
they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. God is perfect in knowledge; his understanding is infinite. He is the Fa∣ther of lights. He looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven. The Lord beholdeth all the children of men from the place of his habitation, and considereth all their works. He knoweth our down-sitting and uprising. He compasseth our path, and counteth our steps. He is acquaint∣ed with all our ways; and when we enter our closet, and shut our door, he seeth us. He knoweth the things that come into our mind, every one of them: and no thought can be with∣holden from him. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. He is a father of the fa∣therless, and a judge of the widow. He is the God of peace, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort and consolation. The Lord is great, and we know him not: His greatness is unsearchable. Who but he hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the heavens with a span? Thine, O Lord, is the
<PB N="197" REF="225"/>
Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Ma∣jesty. Thou art very great, thou art clothed with honour. Heaven is thy throne, and earth is thy footstool.</Q></P>
<P>Can the mind of a Philosopher rise to a more just and magnificent, and at the same time, a more amiable idea of the Deity, than is here set forth in the strongest images and most emphatical language? And yet this is the language of Shepherds and Fishermen. The illite∣rate Jews and poor persecuted Christians retained these noble sentiments, while the polite and powerful nations of the earth were given up to that sottish sort of wor∣ship of which the following elegant de∣scription is extracted from one of the in∣spired Writers.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Who hath formed a God or molten an image that is profitable for nothing? The Smith with the tongs both work∣eth in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms: Yea he is hungry and his strength faileth. He drinketh no water and is faint. A man planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it. He burneth part thereof in the fire.
<PB N="198" REF="226"/>
He roasteth Roast. He warmeth him∣self. And the residue thereof he maketh a God. He falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God. None considereth in his heart, I have burnt part of it in the fire, yea also, I have baked bread upon the coals there∣thereof: I have roasted flesh and eaten it; and shall I make the residue there∣of an abomination? Shall I fall down to the Stock of a Tree?</Q></P>
<P>In such circumstances as these▪ for a man to declare for Free-thinking, and disengage himself from the yoke of Ido∣latry, were doing honour to human na∣ture, and a work well becoming the great asserters of reason. But in a Church, where our adoration is directed to the Supreme Being, and (to say the least) where is no∣thing either in the object or manner of worship that contradicts the light of Na∣ture, there, under the pretence of Free-thinking, to rail at the religious institu∣tions of their Country, sheweth an un∣distinguishing Genius that mistakes Op∣position for Freedom of thought. And, indeed, notwithstanding the pretences of some few among our <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> I can

hardly think there are men so stupid and inconsistent with themselves, as to have a serious regard for natural Religion, and at the same time use their utmost endea∣vours to destroy the credit of those sa∣cred Writings, which as they have been the means of bringing these parts of the world to the knowledge of natural Reli∣gion, so in case they lose their authority over the minds of men, we should of course sink into the same idolatry which we see practised by other unenlightened nations.</P>
<P>If a person who exerts himself in the modern way of Free-thinking be not a stupid Idolater, it is undeniable that he contributes all he can to the making o∣ther men so, either by ignorance or de∣sign; which lays him under the <HI>dilemma,</HI> I will not say of being a Fool or Knave, but of incurring the contempt or dete∣station of mankind.</P>

<P>IT is owing to pride, and a secret af∣fectation of a certain self-existence, that the noblest motive for action that ever was proposed to man, is not acknowledged the glory and happiness of their Being. The heart is treacherous to it self, and we do not let our reflecti∣ons go deep enough to receive religion as the most honourable incentive to good and worthy actions. It is our natural weakness, to flatter our selves into a be∣lief, that if we search into our inmost thoughts, we find our selves wholly dis∣interested, and divested of any views ari∣sing from self-love and vain-glory. But
<PB N="201" REF="229"/>
however spirits of superficial greatness may disdain at first fight to do any thing, but from a noble impulse in themselves, without any future regards in this or an∣other Being; upon stricter enquiry they will find, to act worthily and expect to be rewarded only in another world, is as heroick a pitch of virtue as human na∣ture can arrive at. If the tenor of our actions have any other motive than the desire to be pleasing in the eye of the Deity, it will necessarily follow that we must be more than men, if we are not too much exalted in prosperity and de∣pressed in adversity: But the Christian world has a leader, the contemplation of whose life and sufferings must administer comfort in affliction, while the sense of his Power and Omnipotence must give them humiliation in prosperity.</P>
<P>It is owing to the forbidden and un∣lovely constraint with which men of low conceptions act when they think they conform themselves to religion, as well as to the more odious conduct of hypo∣crites, that the word Christian does not carry with it at first view all that is great, worthy, friendly, generous, and heroick. The man who suspends his
<PB N="202" REF="230"/>
hopes of the reward of worthy actions till after death, who can bestow unseen, who can overlook hatred, do good to his slanderer, who can never be angry at his friend, never revengeful to his ene∣my, is certainly formed for the benefit of society: Yet these are so far from he∣roick virtues, that they are but the or∣dinary duties of a Christian.</P>
<P>When a man with a steady faith looks back on the great catastrophe of this day, with what bleeding emotions of heart must he contemplate the life and suffer∣ings of his deliverer? When his agonies occur to him, how will he weep to re∣flect that he has often forgot them for the glance of a wanton, for the applause of a vain world, for an heap of fleeting past pleasures, which are at present aking sorrows?</P>
<P>How pleasing is the contemplation of the lowly steps our Almighty Leader took in conducting us to his heavenly mansions! In plain and apt parable, si∣militude, and allegory, our great Master enforced the doctrine of our salvation; but they of his acquaintance, instead of receiving what they could not oppose, were offended at the presumption of be∣ing
<PB N="203" REF="231"/>
wiser than they: They could not raise their little ideas above the conside∣ration of him, in those circumstances familiar to them, or conceive that he who appear'd not more terrible or pom∣pous, should have any thing more ex∣alted than themselves; he in that place therefore would not longer ineffectually exert a power which was incapable of conquering the prepossession of their nar∣row and mean conceptions.</P>
<P>Multitudes follow'd him, and brought him the dumb, the blind, the sick, and maim'd; whom when their Creator had touch'd, with a second life they saw, spoke, leap'd, and ran. In affection to him, and admiration of his actions, the crowd could not leave him, but waited near him till they were almost as faint and helpless as others they brought for succour. He had compassion on them, and by a miracle supplied their necessi∣ties. Oh, the ecstatic entertainment, when they could behold their food immediately increase to the Distributer's hand, and see their God in person feeding and refreshing his creatures! Oh envied happiness! But why do I say envied? as if our God did not still preside over our temperate meals,
<PB N="204" REF="232"/>
chearful hours, and innocent conversa∣tions.</P>
<P>But tho' the sacred story is every where full of miracles not inferior to this, and tho' in the midst of those acts of Divi∣nity he never gave the least hint of a de∣sign to become a secular Prince, yet had not hitherto the Apostles themselves any other hopes than of worldly power, pre∣ferment, riches and pomp; for <HI>Peter,</HI> upon an accident of ambition among the Apostles, hearing his Master explain that his kingdom was not of this world, was so scandaliz'd that he whom he had so long follow'd should suffer the ignominy, shame, and death which he foretold, that he took him aside and said, <HI>Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee:</HI> For which he suffered a severe reprehension from his Master, as having in his view the glory of man rather than that of God.</P>
<P>The great change of things began to draw near, when the Lord of Nature thought fit as a Saviour and Deliverer to make his publick entry into <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> with more than the power and joy, but none of the ostentation and pomp of a triumph; he came humble, meek, and
<PB N="205" REF="233"/>
lowly: with an unfelt new ecstacy, mul∣titudes strewed his way with garments and olive-branches, crying with loud gladness and acclamation, <HI>Hosannah to the son of</HI> David, <HI>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!</HI> At this great King's accession to his throne, men were not en∣nobled, but sav'd; crimes were not re∣mitted, but sins forgiven; he did not be∣stow medals, honours, favours, but health, joy, sight, speech. The first object the blind ever saw, was the Author of Sight; while the lame ran before, and the dumb repeated the <HI>Hosannah.</HI> Thus attended, he entered into his own house, the sa∣cred temple, and by his Divine Autho∣rity expell'd traders and worldlings that profaned it; and thus did he, for a time, use a great and despotick power, to let unbelievers understand, that 'twas not want of, but superiority to, all worldly dominion, that made him not exert it. But is this then the Saviour? is this the Deliverer? Shall this obseure <HI>Nazarene</HI> command <HI>Israel,</HI> and sit on the throne of <HI>David?</HI> Their proud and disdainful hearts, which were petrified with the love and pride of this world, were impregnable to the reception of so mean a benefactor,
<PB N="206" REF="234"/>
and were now enough exasperated with benefits to conspire his death. Our Lord was sensible of their design, and prepa∣red his disciples for it, by recounting to 'em now more distinctly what should be∣fal him; but <HI>Peter</HI> with an ungrounded resolution, and in a flush of temper, made a sanguine protestation, that tho' all men were offended in him, yet would not he be offended. It was a great article of our Saviour's business in the world, to bring us to a sense of our inability, without God's assistance, to do any thing great or good; he therefore told <HI>Peter,</HI> who thought so well of his courage and fide∣lity, that they would both fail him, and even he should deny him thrice that very night.</P>
<P><HI>But what heart can conceive, what tongue utter the sequel? Who is that yonder buf∣feted, mock'd, and spurn'd? Whom do they drag like a felon? Whither do they carry my Lord, my King, my Saviour, and my God? And will he die to expiate those very injuries? See where they have nailed the Lord and Giver of Life! How his wounds blacken, his body writhes, and heart heaves with pity and with agony! Oh Almighty Sufferer, look down, look down from thy tri∣umphant

<P>IF to inform the understanding, and regulate the will, is the most lasting and diffusive benefit, there will not be found so useful and excellent an institu∣tion as that of the Christian Priesthood, which is now become the scorn of fools. That a numerous order of men should be consecrated to the study of the most sub∣lime and beneficial truths, with a design to propagate them by their discourses and writings, to inform their fellow-creatures of the Being and Attributes of the Deity, to possess their minds with the sense of a future state, and not only to explain the nature of every virtue and moral duty, but likewise to persuade mankind to the practice of them by the most powerful and engaging motives, is a thing so excellent and necessary to the well-being of the world, that no body
<PB N="208" REF="236"/>
but a modern <HI>Free-thinker</HI> could have the forehead or folly to turn it into ridicule.</P>
<P>The light in which these points should be exposed to the view of one who is pre∣judiced against the names, <HI>Religion, Church, Priest,</HI> and the like, is, to constider the Clergy as so many Philosophers, the churches as schools, and their sermons as lectures, for the information and improve∣ment of the audience. How would the heart of <HI>Socrates</HI> or <HI>Tully</HI> have rejoiced, had they lived in a nation, where the law had made provision for Philosophers, to read lectures of morality and theolo∣gy every seventh day, in several thou∣sands of schools erected at the publick charge throughout the whole country, at which lectures all ranks and sexes without distinction were obliged to be present for their general improvement? And what wicked wretches would they think those men, who should endeavour to defeat the purpose of so divine an in∣stitution?</P>
<P>It is indeed usual with that low tribe of writers, to pretend their design is on∣ly to reform the Church, and expose the vices and not the order of the Clergy. The Author of a pamphlet printed the

other day, (which without my men∣tioning the title, will on this occasion occur to the thoughts of those who have read it) hopes to insinuate by that artifice what he is afraid or ashamed openly to maintain. But there are two points which clearly shew what it is he aims at. The first is, that he con∣stantly uses the word <HI>Priest</HI> in such a manner, as that his reader cannot but observe he means to throw an odium on the Clergy of the church of <HI>England,</HI> from their being called by a name which they enjoy in common with Heathens and Impostors. The other is, his raking together and exaggerating, with great spleen and industry, all those actions of church-men, which, either by their own illness or the bad light in which he places them, tend to give men an ill impression of the dispensers of the Gospel: All which he pathetically addresses to the conside∣ration of his wise and honest countrymen of the laiety. The sophistry and ill-breeding of these proceedings are so ob∣vious to men who have any pretence to that character, that I need say no more either of them or their author.</P>

<P>THERE is a certain coldness and indifference in the phrases of our <HI>European</HI> languages, when they are compared with the oriental forms of speech; and it happens very luckily, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> idioms run into the <HI>English</HI> tongue with a particular grace and beau∣ty. Our language has received innume∣rable elegancies and improvements, from that infusion of <HI>Hebraisms,</HI> which are de∣rived to it out of the poetical passages in Holy Writ. They give a force and ener∣gy to our expressions, warm and animate our language, and convey our thoughts
<PB N="211" REF="239"/>
in more ardent and intense phrases, than any that are to be met with in our own tongue. There is something so pathe∣tick in this kind of diction, that it often sets the mind in a flame, and makes our hearts burn within us. How cold and dead does a prayer appear, that is com∣posed in the most elegant and polite forms of speech, which are natural to our tongue, when it is not heightned by that solemnity of phrase, which may be drawn from the Sacred Writings. It has been said by some of the ancients, that if the Gods were to talk with men, they would certainly speak in <HI>Plato</HI>'s style; but I think we may say, with justice, that when mortals converse with their Creator, they cannot do it in so proper a style as in that of the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>If any one would judge of the beau∣ties of poetry that are to be met with in the Divine Writings, and examine how kindly the <HI>Hebrew</HI> manners of speech mix and incorporate with the <HI>English</HI> lan∣guage; after having perused the book of Psalms, let him read a literal translation of <HI>Horace</HI> or <HI>Pindar.</HI> He will find in these two last such an absurdity and confusion of style, with such a comparative pover∣ty
<PB N="212" REF="240"/>
of imagination, as will make him ve∣ry sensible of what I have been here ad∣vancing.</P>
<P>Since we have therefore such a treasury of words, so beautiful in themselves, and so proper for the airs of musick, I can∣not but wonder that persons of distinction should give so little attention and encou∣ragement to that kind of musick, which would have its foundation in reason, and which would improve our virtue in pro∣portion as it raised our delight. The passions that are excited by ordinary compositions generally flow from such silly and absurd occasions, that a man is ashamed to reflect upon them seriously; but the fear, the love, the sorrow, the indignation that are awakened in the mind by hymns and anthems, make the heart better, and proceed from such causes as are altogether reasonable and praise∣worthy. Pleasure and duty go hand in hand, and the greater our satisfaction is, the greater is our religion.</P>
<P>Musick among those who were styled the chosen people was a religious art. The songs of <HI>Sion,</HI> which we have reason to believe were in high repute among the courts of the Eastern Monarchs, were
<PB N="213" REF="241"/>
nothing else but Psalms and pieces of Poetry that adored or celebrated the Su∣preme Being. The greatest conqueror in this Holy Nation, after the manner of the old <HI>Grecian</HI> Lyricks, did not only compose the words of his Divine Odes, but generally set them to musick himself: After which, his works, tho' they were consecrated to the tabernacle, became the national entertainment, as well as the devotion of his people.</P>
<P>The first original of the Drama was a religious worship consisting only of a Chorus, which was nothing else but an hymn to a Deity. As luxury and volup∣tuousness prevailed over innocence and religion, this form of worship degene∣rated into Tragedies; in which however the Chorus so far remembered its first of∣fice, as to brand every thing that was vicious, and recommend every thing that was laudable; to intercede with heaven for the innocent, and to implore its ven∣geance on the criminal.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Hesiod</HI> intimate to us how this art should be applied, when they re∣present the <HI>Muses</HI> as surrounding <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and warbling their hymns about his throne. I might shew from innumerable
<PB N="214" REF="242"/>
sages in ancient Writers, not only that vocal and instrumental musick were made use of in their religious worship, but that their most favourite diversions were fil∣led with songs and hymns to their re∣spective Deities. Had we frequent en∣tertainments of this nature among us, they would not a little purify and exalt our passions, give our thoughts a proper turn, and cherish those divine impulses in the soul, which every one feels that has not stifled them by sensual and immoderate pleasures.</P>
<P>Musick, when thus applied, raises no∣ble hints in the mind of the hearer, and fills it with great conceptions. It strength∣ens devotion, and advances praise in∣to rapture. It lengthens out every act of worship, and produces more lasting and permanent impressions in the mind, than those which accompany any transi∣ent form of words that are uttered in the ordinary method of religious wor∣ship.</P>

<P>DR. <HI>Tillotson,</HI> in his discourse con∣cerning <HI>the danger of all known sin, both from the light of nature and revela∣tion,</HI> after having given us the description of the last day out of Holy Writ, has this remarkable passage.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I appeal to any man, whether this be not a representation of things very proper and suitable to that <HI>great day,</HI> wherein he who made the world shall come to judge it? And whether the wit of man ever devised any thing so awful, and so agreeable to the Majesty of God, and the solemn judgment of the whole world? The description which <HI>Virgil</HI> makes of the <HI>Elysian Fields,</HI> and the <HI>Infernal Regions,</HI> how infinitely do they fall short of the majesty of the Holy Scripture, and the description there made of <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>hell,</HI> and of <HI>the great and terrible day of the Lord</HI>! So that in comparison they are childish and trifling; and yet perhaps he had the most regular and most govern'd
<PB N="216" REF="244"/>
imagination of any man that ever lived, and observed the greatest decorum in his characters and descriptions. But who can declare <HI>the great things of God,</HI> but <HI>he to whom God shall reveal them?</HI></Q></P>
<P>This observation was worthy a most polite man, and ought to be of authori∣ty with all who are such, so far as to ex∣amine whether he spoke that as a man of a just taste and judgment, or advanced it merely for the service of his doctrine as a clergyman.</P>
<P>I am very confident whoever reads the Gospels, with an heart as much prepa∣red in favour of them as when he sits down to <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Homer,</HI> will find no passage there which is not told with more natural force than any episode in either of those wits, who were the chief of mere mankind.</P>
<P>The last thing I read was the 24th chapter of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which gives an ac∣count of the manner in which our bles∣sed Saviour, after his resurrection, joined with two disciples on the way to <HI>Em∣maus</HI> as an ordinary traveller, and took the privilege as such to enquire of them what occasioned a sadness he observed in
<PB N="217" REF="245"/>
their countenances; or whether it was from any publick cause? Their wonder that any man so near <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should be a stranger to what had passed there; their acknowledgment to one they met accidentally that they had believed in this Prophet; and that now, the third day after his death, they were in doubt as to their pleasing hope which occa∣sioned the heaviness he took notice of, are all represented in a style which men of letters call <HI>the great and noble simplicity.</HI> The attention of the Disciples, when he expounded the Scriptures concerning himself, his offering to take his leave of them, their fondness of his stay, and the manifestation of the great guest whom they had entertained while he was yet at meat with them, are all incidents which wonderfully please the imagination of a Christian reader; and give to him some∣thing of that touch of mind which the brethren felt, when they said one to an∣other, <HI>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</HI></P>
<P>I am very far from pretending to treat these matters as they deserve; but I hope those Gentlemen who are qualified for it,
<PB N="218" REF="246"/>
and called to it, will forgive me, and consider that I speak as a meer secular man, impartially considering the effect which the Sacred Writings will have upon the soul of an intelligent reader; and it is some argument, that a thing is the immediate work of God, when it so infinitely transcends all the labours of man. When I look upon <HI>Raphael</HI>'s pi∣cture of our Saviour appearing to his Disciples after his resurrection, I cannot but think the just disposition of that piece has in it the force of many volumes on the subject: The Evangelists are easi∣ly distinguished from the rest by a pas∣sionate zeal and love which the Painter has thrown in their faces; the huddle group of those who stand most distant are admirable representations of men a∣bashed with their late unbelief and hard∣ness of heart.

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Against <HI>ATHEISM</HI> and <HI>INFIDELITY.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="essay">
<P>AFTER having treated of false Zealots in Religion, I cannot for∣bear mentioning a monstrous spe∣cies of men, who one would not think had any existence in nature, were they not to be met with in ordinary conversa∣tion, I mean the Zealots in Atheism. One would fancy that these men, tho' they fall short, in every other respect, of those who make a profession of religion, would at least out-shine them in this par∣ticular, and be exempt from that single fault which seems to grow out of the imprudent fervours of religion: But so it is, that Infidelity is propagated with as much fierceness and contention, wrath and indignation, as if the safety of man∣kind
<PB N="223" REF="251"/>
depended upon it. There is some∣thing so ridiculous and perverse in this kind of Zealots, that one does not know how to set them out in their proper co∣lours. They are a sort of gamesters who are eternally upon the fret, tho' they play for nothing. They are perpetually teiz∣ing their friends to come over to them, though at the same time they allow that neither of them shall get any thing by the bargain. In short, the zeal of spreading Atheism is, if possible, more absurd than Atheism it self.</P>
<P>Since I have mentioned this unac∣countable Zeal which appears in Atheists and Infidels, I must further observe that they are likewise in a most particular manner possessed with the spirit of bigo∣try. They are wedded to opinions full of contradiction and impossibility, and at the same time look upon the smallest difficulty in an article of faith as a sufficient reason for rejecting it. Notions that fall in with the common reason of mankind, that are conformable to the sense of all ages and all nations, not to mention their tendency for promoting the happiness of societies, or of particular persons, are ex∣ploded as errors and prejudices; and
<PB N="224" REF="252"/>
schemes erected in their stead that are al∣together monstrous and irrational, and require the most extravagant credulity to embrace them. I would fain ask of one these bigotted Infidels, supposing all the great points of Atheism, as the casual or eter∣nal formation of the world, the materi∣ality of a thinking substance, the morta∣lity of the Soul, the fortuitous organi∣zation of the body, the motions and gra∣vitation of matter, with the like particu∣lars, were laid together and formed into a kind of Creed, according to the opini∣ons of the most celebrated Atheists; I say, supposing such a Creed as this were formed, and imposed upon any one peo∣ple in the world, whether it would not require an infinitely greater measure of faith, than any set of articles which they so violently oppose. Let me therefore advise this generation of Wranglers, for their own and for the publick good, to act at least so consistently with them∣selves, as not to burn with Zeal for Ir∣religion, and with Bigotry for Non-sense.</P>

<P>UPon my return to my lodgings last night I found a letter from my worthy friend the Clergyman, whom I have given some account of in my former papers. He tells me in it that he was particularly pleased with the latter part of my yesterday's speculation; and at the same time enclosed the following Essay, which he desires me to publish as the se∣quel of that discourse. It consists partly of uncommon reflections, and partly of such as have been already used, but now set in a stronger light.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>A Believer may be excused by the most hardened Atheist for endeavour∣ing to make him a Convert, because he does it with an eye to both their inte∣rests. The Atheist is inexcusable who tries to gain over a Believer, because he does not propose the doing himself or Believer any good by such a conver∣sion.</P>
<P>The prospect of a future State is the secret comfort and refreshment of my
<PB N="226" REF="254"/>
soul, it is that which makes nature look gay about me; it doubles all my plea∣sures, and supports me under all my af∣flictions. I can look at disappoint∣ments and misfortunes, pain and sick∣ness, death it self, and what is worse than death, the loss of those who are dearest to me, with indifference, so long as I keep in view the pleasures of eternity, and the state of Being in which there will be no fears nor apprehensions, pains nor sorrows, sickness nor separation. Why will any man be so impertinently officious, as to tell me all this is only fancy and delusion? Is there any me∣rit in being the messenger of ill news? If it is a dream, let me enjoy it, since it makes me both the happier and the better man.</P>
<P>I must confess I do not know how to trust a man who believes neither heaven nor hell, or in other words, a future State of rewards and punish∣ments. Not only natural self-love, but reason directs us to promote our own interest above all things. It can never be for the interest of a Believer to do me a mischief, because he is sure upon the ballance of accompts to find him∣self
<PB N="227" REF="255"/>
a loser by it. On the contrary, if he considers his own welfare in his be∣haviour towards me, it will lead him to do me all the good he can, and at the same time restrain him from doing me an injury. An Unbeliever does not act like a reasonable creature, if he fa∣vours me contrary to his present inte∣rest, or does not distress me when it turns to his present advantage. Ho∣nour and good-nature may indeed tie up his hands; but as these would be very much strengthened by reason and principle, so without them they are only instincts, or wavering unsettled notions, which rest on no foundation.</P>
<P>Infidelity has been attacked with so good success of late years, that it is driven out of all its out-works. The Atheist has not found his post tenable, and is therefore retired into Deism, and a disbelief of revealed Religion only. But the truth of it is, the greatest num∣ber of this set of men, are those who, for want of a virtuous education, or examining the grounds of Religion, know so very little of the matter in question, that their Infidelity is but a∣nother term for their ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="256"/>
As folly and inconsiderateness are the foundations of Infidelity, the great pillars and supports of it are either a vanity of appearing wiser than the rest of mankind, or an ostentation of cou∣rage in despising the terrors of ano∣ther world, which have so great an influence on what they call weaker minds; or an aversion to a belief that must cut them off from many of those pleasures they propose to themselves, and fill them with remorse for many of those they have already tasted.</P>
<P>The great received articles of the Christian Religion have been so clearly proved, from the authority of that Di∣vine Revelation in which they are de∣livered, that it is impossible for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see, not to be convinced of them. But were it possible for any thing in the Christian faith to be erroneous, I can find no ill consequences in adhering to it. The great points, of the Incarna∣tion and Sufferings of our Saviour, produce naturally such habits of virtue in the mind of man, that I say, sup∣posing it were possible for us to be mi∣staken in them, the Infidel himself must
<PB N="229" REF="257"/>
at least allow that no other system of Religion could so effectually contribute to the heightning of morality. They give us great ideas of the dignity of human nature, and of the love which the Supreme Being bears to his crea∣tures, and consequently engage us in the highest acts of duty towards our Creator, our neighbour, and our selves. How many noble arguments has Saint <HI>Paul</HI> raised from the chief articles of our Religion, for the advancing of mo∣rality in its three great branches? To give a single example in each kind: What can be a stronger motive to a firm trust and reliance on the mercies of our Maker, than the giving us his Son to suffer for us? What can make us love and esteem even the most in∣considerable of mankind, more than the thought that Christ died for him? Or what dispose us to set a stricter guard upon the purity of our own hearts, than our being members of Christ, and a part of the society of which that im∣maculate Person is the Head? But these are only a specimen of those admirable enforcements of morality which the Apostle has drawn from the history of our blessed Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="258"/>
If our modern Infidels considered these matters with that candour and seriousness which they deserve, we should not see them act with such a spirit of bitterness, arrogance, and ma∣lice: they would not be raising such in∣significant cavils, doubts and scruples, as may be started against every thing that is not capaple of mathematical de∣monstration; in order to unsettle the minds of the ignorant, disturb the pub∣lick peace, subvert morality, and throw all things into confusion and disorder. If none of these reflections can have any influence on them, there is one that perhaps may, because it is adapted to their vanity, by which they seem to be guided much more than their rea∣son. I would therefore have them con∣sider, that the wisest and best of men in all ages of the world, have been those who lived up to the Religion of their country, when they saw nothing in it opposite to morality, and to the best lights they had of the Divine Na∣ture. <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s first rule directs us to worship the Gods <HI>as it is ordained by law,</HI> for that is the most natural in∣terpretation of the precept. <HI>Socrates,</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="259"/>
who was the most renowned among the Heathens both for wisdom and virtue, in his last moments desires his friends to offer a Cock to <HI>Aesculapius</HI>; doubt∣less out of a submissive deference to the established worship of his country. <HI>Xenophon</HI> tells us, that his Prince (whom he sets forth as a patern of perfection) when he found his death approaching, offered sacrifices on the mountains to the <HI>Persian Jupiter,</HI> and the Sun, <HI>ac∣cording to the custom of the Persians</HI>; for those are the words of the Historian. Nay, the <HI>Epicureans</HI> and atomical Phi∣losophers shewed a very remarkable modesty in this particular; for, though the Being of a God was entirely repug∣nant to their schemes of natural Phi∣losophy, they contented themselves with the denial of a Providence, assert∣ing at the same time the Existence of Gods in general; because they would not shock the common belief of man∣kind, and the Religion of their Coun∣try. </P></Q>

<P>HAVING endeavoured in my last <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper to shew the great excellency of faith, I shall here consider what are the proper means of strength∣ning and confirming it in the mind of man. Those who delight in reading books of controversy, which are written on both sides of the question in points of faith, do very seldom arrive at a fixed and set∣tled habit of it. They are one day en∣tirely convinced of its important truths, and the next meet with something that shakes and disturbs them. The doubt which was laid revives again, and shews it self in new difficulties, and that gene∣rally for this reason, because the mind which is perpetually tost in controversies and disputes, is apt to forget the reasons which had once set it at rest, and to be disquieted with any former perplexity, when it appears in a new shape, or is started by a different hand. As nothing is more laudable than an enquiry after
<PB N="233" REF="261"/>
truth, so nothing is more irrational than to pass away our whole lives, without determining our selves one way or other in those points which are of the last im∣portance to us. There are indeed many things from which we may with-hold our assent; but in cases by which we are to regulate our lives, it is the greatest ab∣surdity to be wavering and unsettled, without closing with that side which ap∣pears the most safe and the most proba∣ble.</P>
<P>The first rule therefore which I shall lay down is this, that when by reading or discourse we find our selves thorough∣ly convinced of the truth of any article, and of the reasonableness of our belief in it, we should never after suffer our selves to call it into question. We may per∣haps forget the arguments which occa∣sioned our conviction, but we ought to remember the strength they had with us, and therefore still to retain the convi∣ction which they once produced. This is no more than what we do in every common art or science, nor is it possible to act otherwise, considering the weak∣ness and limitation of our intellectual fa∣culties. It was thus that <HI>Latimer,</HI> one
<PB N="234" REF="262"/>
of the glorious army of martyrs who in∣troduced the reformation in <HI>England,</HI> be∣haved himself in that great conference which was managed between the most learned among the Protestants and Pa∣pists in the reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> This venerable old man knowing how his abi∣lities were impaired by age, and that it was impossible for him to recollect all those reasons which had directed him in the choice of his religion, left his com∣panions, who were in the full possession of their parts and learning, to baffle and confound their antagonists by the force of reason. As for himself he only re∣peated to his adversaries the articles in which he firmly believed, and in the pro∣fession of which he was determined to die. It is in this manner that the Ma∣thematician proceeds upon propositions which he has once demonstrated; and though the demonstration may have slipt out of his memory, he builds upon the truth, because he knows it was demon∣strated. This rule is absolutely necessary for weaker minds, and in some measure for men of the greatest abilities.</P>
<P>But to these last I would propose, in the second place, that they should lay
<PB N="235" REF="263"/>
up in their memories, and always keep by them in a readiness, those arguments which appear to them of the greatest strength, and which cannot be got over by all the doubts and cavils of infide∣lity.</P>
<P>But, in the third place, there is no∣thing which strengthens faith more than morality. Faith and morality naturally produce each other. A man is quickly convinced of the truth of religion, who finds it is not against his interest that it should be true. The pleasure he receives at present, and the happiness which he promises himself from it hereafter, will both dispose him very powerfully to give credit to it, according to the ordinary observation that <HI>we are easy to believe what we wish.</HI> It is very certain, that a man of sound reason cannot forbear clo∣sing with religion upon an impartial exa∣mination of it; but at the same time it is as certain, that faith is kept alive in us, and gathers strength from practice more than from speculation.</P>
<P>There is still another method which is more persuasive than any of the former, and that is an habitual adoration of the Supreme Being, as well in constant acts
<PB N="236" REF="264"/>
of mental worship, as in outward forms. The devout man does not only believe but feels there is a Deity. He has actual sensations of him; his experience con∣curs with his reason; he sees him more and more in all his intercourses with him, and even in this life almost loses his faith in conviction.</P>
<P>The last method which I shall men∣tion for the giving life to a man's faith, is frequent retirement from the world, accompanied with religious meditation. When a man thinks of any thing in the darkness of the night, whatever deep impressions it may make in his mind, they are apt to vanish as soon as the day breaks about him. The light and noise of the day, which are perpetually solliciting his senses, and calling off his attention, wear out of his mind the thoughts that im∣printed themselves in it, with so much strength, during the silence and dark∣ness of the night. A man finds the same difference as to himself in a crowd and in a solitude: The mind is stunned and dazzled amidst that variety of objects which press upon her in a great city: She cannot apply herself to the conside∣ration of those things which are of the
<PB N="237" REF="265"/>
utmost concern to her. The cares or pleasures of the world strike in with eve∣ry thought, and a multitude of vicious examples give a kind of justification to our folly. In our retirements every thing disposes us to be serious. In courts and cities we are entertained with the works of men; in the country with those of God. One is the province of art, the other of nature. Faith and devotion na∣turally grow in the mind of every rea∣sonable man, who sees the impressions of Divine Power and Wisdom in every ob∣ject, on which he casts his eye. The Supreme Being has made the best argu∣ments for his own Existence, in the for∣mation of the heavens and the earth, and these are arguments which a man of sense cannot forbear attending to, who is out of the noise and hurry of human affairs. <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, that should a man live un∣der ground, and there converse with works of art and mechanism, and should afterwards be brought up into the open day, and see the several glories of the heaven and earth, he would immediately pronounce them the works of such a Be∣ing as we define God to be. The Psalmist has very beautiful strokes of Poetry to
<PB N="238" REF="266"/>

On<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day telleth another: And one night certifieth another. There is neither speech nor lan∣guage: But their voices are heard among them.

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Against the modern FREE-THINKERS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 REND="margQuotes" TYPE="letter">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE arrived in this neigh∣bourhood two days ago one of your gay gentlemen of the town, who being attended at his entry with a servant of his own, besides a country∣man he had taken up for a guide, ex∣cited the curiosity of the village to learn whence and what he might be. The countryman (to whom they ap∣plied as most easy of access) knew lit∣tle more than that the gentleman came from <HI>London</HI> to travel and see fashions, and was, as he heard say, a Free-thinker: What religion that might be, he could not tell; and for his own part, if they had not told him the man was a Free-thinker, he should have guessed, by his way of talking, he was
<PB N="241" REF="269"/>
little better than a Heathen; except∣ing only that he had been a good gen∣tleman to him, and made him drunk twice in one day, over and above what they had bargained for.</P>
<P>I do not look upon the simplicity of this, and several odd enquiries with which I shall trouble you, to be won∣dered at, much less can I think that our youths of fine wit, and enlarged understandings, have any reason to laugh. There is no necessity that eve∣ry squire in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> should know what the word Free-thinker stands for; but it were much to be wished, that they who valued themselves upon that conceited title, were a little better in∣structed in what it ought to stand for; and that they would not perswade them∣selves a man is really and truly a Free-thinker in any tolerable sense, merely by virtue of his being an Atheist, or an Infidel of any other distinction. It may be doubted, with good reason, whether there ever was in nature a more abject, slavish, and bigotted ge∣neration than the tribe of <HI>Beaux Esprits,</HI> at present so prevailing in this island, Their pretension to be Free-thinkers▪
<PB N="242" REF="270"/>
is no other than rakes have to be free-livers, and savages to be free-men, that is, they can think whatever they have a mind to, and give themselves up to whatever conceit the extravagancy of their inclination, or their fancy, shall suggest; they can think as wildly as talk and act, and will not endure that their wit should be controuled by such formal things as decency and common sense: Deduction, coherence, consisten∣cy, and all the rules of reason they ac∣cordingly disdain, as too precise and me∣chanical for men of a liberal education.</P>
<P>This, as far as I could ever learn from their writings, or my own obser∣vation, is a true account of the <HI>British</HI> Free-thinker. Our visitant here, who gave occasion to this paper, has brought with him a new system of common sense, the particulars of which I am not yet acquainted with, but will lose no opportunity of informing myself whether it contain any thing worth <HI>Mr.</HI> SPECTATOR's notice. In the mean time, Sir, I cannot but think it would be for the good of mankind, if you would take this subject into your own consideration, and convince the hope∣ful

<P>I Am diverted from the account I was giving the town of my particular con∣cerns, by casting my eye upon a trea∣tise, which I could not overlook with∣out an inexcusable negligence, and want of concern for all the civil, as well as re∣ligious interests of mankind. This piece has for its title, <HI>A discourse of free-think∣ing, occasioned by the rise and growth of a sect called free-thinkers.</HI> The Author ve∣ry methodically enters upon his argu∣ment, and says, <HI>By free-thinking I mean the use of the understanding in endeavouring to find out the meaning of any proposition whatsoever, in considering the nature of the evidence for, or against, and in judging of it according to the seeming force or weak∣ness of the evidence.</HI> As soon as he has
<PB N="244" REF="272"/>
delivered this definition, from which one would expect he did not design to shew a particular inclination for or against any thing before he had considered it, he gives up all title to the character of a <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> with the most appa∣rent prejudice against a body of men, whom of all other a good man would be most careful not to violate, I mean men in holy orders. Persons who have devo∣ted themselves to the service of God, are venerable to all who fear him; and it is a certain characteristick of a disso∣lute and ungovern'd mind, to rail or speak disrespectfully of them in general. It is certain, that in so great a crowd of men some will intrude, who are of tem∣pers very unbecoming their function; but because ambition and avarice are sometimes lodged in that bosom, which ought to be the dwelling of sanctity and devotion, must this unreasonable Author villify the whole order? He has not ta∣ken the least care to disguise his being an enemy to the persons against whom he writes, nor any where granted that the institution of religious men to serve at the altar, and instruct such who are not as wise as himself, is at all necessary
<PB N="245" REF="273"/>
or desirable; but proceeds without the least apology, to undermine their cre∣dit, and frustrate their labours: What∣ever clergy-men in disputes against each other, have unguardedly uttered, is here recorded in such a manner as to affect religion itself, by wresting concessions to its disadvantage from its own teachers. If this be true, as sure any man that reads the discourse must allow it is; and if religion is the strongest tie of human society; in what manner are we to treat this our common enemy, who promotes the growth of such a sect as he calls <HI>Free-thinkers:</HI> He that should burn a house, and justify the action by assert∣ing he is a free agent, would be more excusable than this Author in uttering what he has from the right of a <HI>Free-thinker:</HI> But they are a set of dry, joy∣less, dull fellows, who want capacities and talents to make a figure amongst mankind upon benevolent and generous principles, that think to surmount their own natural meanness, by laying offen∣ces in the way of such as make it their endeavour to excel upon the received maxims and honest arts of life. If it were possible to laugh at so melancholy an af∣fair
<PB N="246" REF="274"/>
as what hazards salvation, it would be no unpleasant enquiry to ask what sa∣tisfaction they reap, what extraordinary gratification of sense, or what delicious libertinism this sect of <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> en∣joy, after getting loose of the laws which confine the passions of other men? Would it not be a matter of mirth to find, after all, that the heads of this growing sect are sober wretches, who prate whole evenings over coffee, and have not them∣selves fire enough to be any further de∣bauchees, than merely in principle? These sages of iniquity are, it seems, themselves only speculatively wicked, and are con∣tented that all the abandoned young men of the age are kept safe from reflection by dabbling in their rhapsodies, without tasting the pleasures for which their do∣ctrines leave them unaccountable. Thus do heavy mortals, only to gratify a dry pride of heart, give up the interests of another world, without enlarging their gratifications in this; but it is certain that there are a sort of men that can puz∣zle truth, but cannot enjoy the satisfa∣ction of it. This same <HI>Free-thinker</HI> is a creature unacquainted with the emotions which possess great minds when they are
<PB N="247" REF="275"/>
turned for religion, and it is apparent that he is untouched with any such sen∣sation as the rapture of devotion. What∣ever one of these scorners may think, they certainly want parts to be devout; and a sense of piety towards heaven, as well as the sense of any thing else, is live∣ly and warm in proportion to the facul∣ties of the head and heart. This gentle∣man may be assured he has not a taste for what he pretends to decry, and the poor man is certainly more a blockhead than an Atheist. I must repeat, that he wants capacity to relish what true piety is; and he is as capable of writing an heroick Poem, as making a fervent Pray∣er. When men are thus low and nar∣row in their apprehensions of things, and at the same time vain, they are na∣turally led to think every thing they do not understand, not to be understood. Their contradiction to what is urged by others, is a necessary consequence of their incapacity to receive it. The atheistical fellows who appeared the last age did not serve the devil for nought; but re∣velled in excesses suitable to their prin∣ciples, while in these unhappy days mis∣chief is done for mischief's sake. These
<PB N="248" REF="276"/>
<HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> who lead the lives of re¦cluse students, for no other purpose but to disturb the sentiments of other men put me in mind of the monstrous re∣creation of those late wild youths, who, without provocation, had a wantonness in stabbing and defacing those they met with. When such writers as this, who has no spirit but that of malice, pretend to inform the age, <HI>Mohocks</HI> and Cut-throats may well set up for wits and men of pleasure.</P>
<P>It will be perhaps expected, that I should produce some instances of the ill intention of this <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> to support the treatment I here give him. In his 52d page he says,</P>
<P N="2"><Q REND="margQuotes">2<HI>dly,</HI> The Priests throughout the world differ about Scriptures, and the autho∣rity of Scriptures. The <HI>Bramins</HI> have a book of <HI>Scripture</HI> called the <HI>Shaster.</HI> The <HI>Persees</HI> have their <HI>Zundavastaw.</HI> The <HI>Bonzes</HI> of <HI>China</HI> have books writ∣ten by the <HI>Disciples of</HI> Fo-he, whom they call the <HI>God and Saviour of the world, who was born to teach the way of salvation, and to give satisfaction for all mens sins.</HI> The <HI>Talapoins</HI> of <HI>Siam</HI> have a <HI>book of Scripture</HI> written by <HI>Sommono∣codom,</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="277"/>
who, the <HI>Siamese</HI> say, was <HI>born of a Virgin,</HI> and was <HI>the God expected by the universe.</HI> The <HI>Dervizes</HI> have their <HI>Alcoran.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I believe there is no one will dispute the Author's great impartiality in setting down the accounts of these different re∣ligions. And I think it is pretty evi∣dent he delivers the matter with an air, that betrays, the history of <HI>one born of a Virgin</HI> has as much authority with him from St. <HI>Sommonocodom</HI> as from St. <HI>Mat∣thew.</HI> Thus he treats revelation. Then as to philosophy, he tells you, <HI>p.</HI> 136. Cicero <HI>produces this as an instance of a pro∣bable opinion, that they who study Philoso∣phy do not believe there are any Gods</HI>; and then, from consideration of various no∣tions, he affirms <HI>Tully</HI> concludes, <HI>That there can be nothing after death.</HI></P>
<P>As to what he misrepresents of <HI>Tully,</HI> the short sentence on the head of this paper is enough to oppose; but who can have patience to reflect upon the assem∣blage of impostures among which our Author places the religion of his coun∣try? As for my part, I cannot see any possible interpretation to give this work, but a design to subvert and ridicule the
<PB N="250" REF="278"/>
authority of Scripture. The peace and tranquility of the nation, and regards even above those, are so much concern∣ed in this matter, that it is difficult to express sufficient sorrow for the offender, or indignation against him.

<P>AS I was, the other day, taking a so∣litary walk in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, I indulged my thoughts in the pursuit of a certain analogy between the Fabrick and the <HI>Christian Church</HI> in the largest sense. The divine order and oeconomy of the one seemed to be emblematically set forth by the just, plain, and majestick architecture of the other. And as the one consists of a great variety of parts united in the same regular design, according to the truest art, and most exact proportion; so the other contains a decent subordination of members, various sacred institutions, su∣blime doctrines, and solid precepts of morality digested into the same design,
<PB N="251" REF="279"/>
and with an admirable concurrence tend∣ing to one view, the happiness and ex∣altation of human nature.</P>
<P>In the midst of my contemplation I beheld a Fly upon one of the Pillars; and it straitway came into my head, that this same Fly was a <HI>Free-thinker.</HI> For it required some comprehension in the eye of the Spectator, to take in at one view the various parts of the building, in or∣der to observe their symmetry and de∣sign. But to the Fly, whose prospect was confined to a little part of one of the stones of a single pillar, the joint beauty of the whole, or the distinct use of its parts, were inconspicuous, and no∣thing could appear but small inequalities in the surface of the hewn stone, which in the view of that insect seemed so ma∣ny deformed rocks and precipices.</P>
<P>The thoughts of a <HI>Free-thinker</HI> are em∣ployed on certain minute particularities of Religion, the difficulty of a single text, or the unaccountableness of some step of Providence or point of doctrine to his narrow faculties, without com∣prehending the scope and design of Chri∣stianity, the perfection to which it rai∣seth human nature, the light it hath shed
<PB N="252" REF="280"/>
abroad in the world, and the close con∣nexion it hath as well with the good of publick societies, as with that of parti∣cular persons.</P>
<P>This raised in me some reflections on that frame or disposition which is called <HI>largeness of mind,</HI> its necessity towards forming a true judgment of things, and where the Soul is not incurably stinted by nature, what are the likeliest methods to give it enlargement.</P>
<P>It is evident that Philosophy doth open and enlarge the mind, by the gene∣ral views to which men are habituated in that study, and by the contemplation of more numerous and distant objects, than fall within the sphere of mankind in the ordinary pursuits of life. Hence it comes to pass, that Philosophers judge of most things very differently from the vulgar. Some instances of this may be seen in the <HI>Theaetetus</HI> of <HI>Plato,</HI> where <HI>Socrates</HI> makes the following remarks, among o∣thers of the like nature.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">When a Philosopher hears ten thou∣sand acres mentioned as a great estate, he looks upon it as an inconsider∣able spot, having been used to con∣template the whole globe of earth.
<PB N="253" REF="281"/>
Or when he beholds a man elated with the nobility of his race, because he can reckon a series of seven rich ancestors, the Philosopher thinks him a stupid ig∣norant fellow, whose mind cannot reach to a general view of human na∣ture, which would shew him that we have all innumerable ancestors, among whom are crowds of rich and poor, Kings and Slaves, <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbari∣ans.</HI></Q>
Thus far <HI>Socrates,</HI> who was ac∣counted wiser than the rest of the Hea∣thens, for notions which approach the nearest to Christianity.</P>
<P>As all parts and branches of Philoso∣phy, or speculative knowledge, are use∣ful in that respect, Astronomy is peculi∣arly adapted to remedy a little and nar∣row spirit. In that science there are good reasons assigned to prove the sun an hun∣dred thousand times bigger than our earth; and the distance of the stars so prodigious, that a Cannon-bullet conti∣nuing in its ordinary rapid motion, would not arrive from hence at the nearest of them, in the space of an hundred and fifty thousand years. These ideas won∣derfully dilate and expand the mind. There is something in the immensity of
<PB N="254" REF="282"/>
this distance, that shocks and over∣whelms the imagination, it is too big for the grasp of a human intellect: Estates, Provinces, and Kingdoms vanish at its presence. It were to be wished a cer∣tain Prince, who hath encouraged the study of it in his subjects, had been him∣self a proficient in Astronomy. This might have shewed him how mean an ambition that was, which terminated in a small part of what is it self but a point, in respect of that part of the universe which lies within our view.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> ennobleth and enlargeth the mind beyond any o∣ther profession or science whatsoever. Upon that scheme, while the earth, and the transient enjoyments of this life, shrink in the narrowest dimensions, and are accounted as <HI>the dust of a balance, the drop of a bucket, yea less than nothing,</HI> the intellectual world opens wider to our view: The perfections of the Deity, the nature and excellence of virtue, the dig∣nity of the human soul, are displayed in the largest characters. The mind of man seems to adapt it self to the different na∣ture of its objects; it is contracted and debased by being conversant in little and
<PB N="255" REF="283"/>
low things, and feels a proportionable enlargement arising from the contem∣plation of these great and sublime ideas.</P>
<P>The greatness of things is compara∣tive; and this does not only hold, in re∣spect of extension, but likewise in respect of dignity, duration, and all kinds of perfection. Astronomy opens the mind, and alters our judgment, with regard to the magnitude of extended Beings; but Christianity produceth an universal great∣ness of Soul. Philosophy encreaseth our views in every respect, but Christianity extends them to a degree beyond the light of nature.</P>
<P>How mean must the most exalted Po∣tentate upon earth appear to that eye which takes in innumerable orders of blessed Spirits, differing in glory and perfection? How little must the amusements of sense, and the ordinary occupations of mortal men, seem to one who is engaged in so noble a pursuit, as the assimilation of himself to the Deity, which is the pro∣per employment of every Christian!</P>
<P>And the improvement which grows from habituating the mind to the com∣prehensive views of Religion must not be thought wholly to regard the under∣standing.
<PB N="256" REF="284"/>
Nothing is of greater force to subdue the inordinate motions of the heart, and to regulate the will. Whe∣ther a man be actuated by his passions or his reason, these are first wrought up∣on by some object, which stirs the soul in proportion to its apparent dimensions. Hence irreligious men, whose short pro∣spects are filled with earth, and sense, and mortal life, are invited, by these mean ideas, to actions proportionably little and low. But a mind, whose views are en∣lightened and extended by Religion, is animated to nobler pursuits by more sub∣lime and remote objects.</P>
<P>There is not any instance of weakness in the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> that raises my indig∣nation more, than their pretending to ri∣dicule Christians, as men of narrow un∣derstandings, and to pass themselves up∣on the world for persons of superior sense, and more enlarged views. But I leave it to any impartial man to judge which hath the nobler sentiments, which the greater views; he whose notions are stinted to a few miserable inlets of sense, or he whose sentiments are raised above the common taste by the anticipation of those delights which will satiate the soul, when the
<PB N="257" REF="285"/>
whole capacity of her nature is branched out into new faculties? He who looks for nothing beyond this short span of du∣ration, or he whose aims are co-extended with the endless length of Eternity? He who derives his Spirit from the elements, or he who thinks it was inspired by the Almighty?</P>

<P>SInce you have not refused to insert matters of a Theological nature in those excellent papers, with which you daily both instruct and divert us, I earnestly desire you to print the fol∣lowing paper. The notions therein ad∣vanced are, for ought I know, new to the <HI>English</HI> Reader, and if they are true, will afford room for many useful in∣ferences.</P>
<P>No man that reads the Evangelists, but must observe that our blessed Sa∣viour does upon every occasion bend all his force and zeal to rebuke and correct the hypocrisie of the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> Upon that subject he shews a warmth which one meets with in no other part
<PB N="258" REF="286"/>
of his sermons. They were so enraged at this publick detection of their se∣cret villanies, by one who saw through all their disguises, that they joined in the prosecution of him, which was so vigorous, that <HI>Pilate</HI> at last consented to his death. The frequency and ve∣hemence of these reprehensions of our Lord, have made the word <HI>Pharisee</HI> to be looked upon as odious among Chri∣stians, and to mean only one who lays the utmost stress upon the Outward, Ceremonial, and Ritual part of his Re∣ligion, without having such an inward sense of it, as would lead him to a ge∣neral and sincere observance of those duties which can only arise from the heart, and which cannot be supposed to spring from a desire of applause or profit.</P>
<P>This is plain from the history of the life and actions of our Lord, in the four Evangelists. One of them, St. <HI>Luke,</HI> continued his history down in a se∣cond part, which we commonly call the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI> Now it is obser∣vable, that in this second part, in which he gives a particular account of what the Apostles did and suffered at <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="287"/>
upon their first entring upon their commission, and also of what St. <HI>Paul</HI> did after he was consecrated to the A∣postleship 'till his journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> we find not only no opposition to Christi∣anity from the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> but several signal occasions in which they assisted its first Teachers, when the Christian Church was in its infant State. The true, zealous and hearty persecutors of Christianity at that time were the <HI>Sad∣ducees,</HI> whom we may truly call the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> among the <HI>Jews.</HI> They believed neither Resurrection, nor An∣gel, nor Spirit, <HI>i. e.</HI> in plain <HI>English,</HI> they were <HI>Deists</HI> at least, if not <HI>Atheists.</HI> They could outwardly comply with, and conform to the establishment in Church and State, and they pretended forsooth to belong only to a particular Sect, and because there was nothing in the law of <HI>Moses</HI> which in so many words asserted a Resurrection, they ap∣peared to adhere to that in a particular manner beyond any other part of the Old Testament. These men therefore justly dreaded the spreading of Christi∣anity after the ascension of our Lord,
<PB N="260" REF="288"/>
because it was wholly founded upon his Resurrection.</P>
<P>Accordingly therefore when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> had cured the lame man at the beautiful gate of the Temple, and had thereby raised a wonderful expectation of themselves among the people, the Priests and <HI>Sadducees, Acts</HI> 4. clapt them up, and sent them away for the first time with a severe reprimand. Quickly after, when the deaths of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira,</HI> and the many miracles wought after those severe instances of the apostolical power had alarmed the <HI>Priests,</HI> who looked upon the Temple worship, and consequently their Bread, to be struck at, these Priests, and all they that were with them, who were of the sect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> imprisoned the Apostles, intending to examine them in the great Council the next day. Where, when the Council met, and the Priests and <HI>Sadducees</HI> proposed to proceed with great Rigor against them, we find that <HI>Gamaliel</HI> a very emi∣nent <HI>Pharisee,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s master, a man of great authority among the people, many of whose determinations we have
<PB N="261" REF="289"/>
still preserved in the body of the <HI>Jewish</HI> traditions, commonly called the <HI>Tal∣mud,</HI> opposed their heat, and told them, for ought they knew the Apostles might be acted by the Spirit of God, and that in such a case it would be in vain to oppose them, since if they did so, they would only fight against God, whom they could not overcome. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> was so considerable a man amongst his own Sect, that we may reasonably be∣lieve he spoke the sense of his party as well as his own. St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s mar∣tyrdom came on presently after, in which we do not find the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> as such, had any hand; it is probable that he was prosecuted by those who had before imprisoned <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John.</HI> One Novice indeed of that Sect was so zealous that he kept the cloaths of those that stoned him. This Novice, whose zeal went beyond all bounds, was the great St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was pe∣culiarly honoured with a Call from Heaven by which he was converted, and he was afterwards, by God himself, appointed to be the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Besides him, and him too re∣claimed
<PB N="262" REF="290"/>
in so glorious a manner, we find no one <HI>Pharisee</HI> either named or hinted at by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> as an opposer of Christianity in those earliest days. What others might do we know not. But we find the <HI>Sadducees</HI> pursuing St. <HI>Paul</HI> even to death at his coming to <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> in the 21st of the <HI>Acts.</HI> He then, upon all occasions, owned himself to be a <HI>Pharisee.</HI> In the 22d Chapter he told the people, that he had been bred up at the feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> after the strictest manner, in the Law of his Fa∣thers. In the 23d Chapter he told the Council that he was a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> the son of a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> and that he was accused for asserting the Hope and Resurrecti∣on of the dead, which was their dar∣ling doctrine. Hereupon the <HI>Pharisees</HI> stood by him, and though they did not own our Saviour to be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> yet they would not deny but some An∣gel or Spirit might have spoken to him, and then if they opposed him they should fight against God. This was the very argument <HI>Gamaliel</HI> had used be∣fore. The Resurrection of our Lord, which they saw so strenuously asserted
<PB N="263" REF="291"/>
by the Apostles, whose miracles they also saw and owned, (<HI>Acts</HI> 4.16.) seems to have struck them, and many of them were converted (<HI>Acts</HI> 15.5) even without a miracle, and the rest stood still and made no opposition.</P>
<P>We see here what the part was which the <HI>Pharisees</HI> acted in this im∣portant conjuncture. Of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> we meet not with one in the whole apostolic history that was converted. We hear of no miracles wrought to convince any of them, tho' there was an eminent one wrought to reclaim a <HI>Pha∣risee.</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> we see, after his con∣version always gloried in his having been bred a <HI>Pharisee.</HI> He did so to the people of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the great Council, to King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and to the <HI>Philippians.</HI> So that from hence we may justly infer, that it was not their institution, which was in itself laudable, which our blessed Saviour found fault with, but it was their hypocrisie, their covetousness, their oppression, their overvaluing themselves upon their zeal for the ceremonial Law, and their ad∣ding to that yoke by their traditions,
<PB N="264" REF="292"/>
all which were not properly essentials of their institution, that our Lord blamed.</P>
<P>But I must not run on. What I would observe, Sir, is, that Atheism is more dreadful, and would be more grievous to human society, if it were invested with sufficient power, than Religion under any shape, where its professors do at the bottom believe what they profess. I despair not of a Papist's conversion, tho' I would not willingly lie at a zealot Papist's mercy, (and no Protestant would, if he knew what Popery is) tho' he truly believes in our Saviour. But the <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> who scarcely believes there is a God, and certainly disbelieves Revelation, is a very terrible Animal. He will talk of <HI>natural rights,</HI> and the just freedoms of mankind, no longer than 'till he himself gets into power; and by the instance before us, we have small grounds to hope for his salvation, or that God will ever vouchsafe him suf∣ficient grace to reclaim him from er∣rors, which have been so immediately levelled against himself.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am fully persuaded that one of the best springs of generous and wor∣thy actions, is the having generous and worthy thoughts of our selves. Whoever has a mean opinion of the dignity of his nature, will act in no higher a rank than he has allotted him∣self in his own estimation. If he con∣siders his Being as circumscribed by the uncertain term of a few years, his de∣signs will be contracted into the same
<PB N="267" REF="295"/>
narrow span he imagines is to bound his Existence. How can he exalt his thoughts to any thing great and no∣ble, who only believes that, after a short turn on the stage of this world, he is to sink into oblivion, and to lose his Consciousness for ever?</P>
<P>For this reason I am of opinion, that so useful and elevated a contemplation as that of the <HI>Soul's Immortality</HI> cannot be resumed too often. There is not a more improving exercise to the human mind, than to be frequently reviewing its own great privileges and endow∣ments; nor a more effectual means to awaken in us an ambition raised above low objects and little pursuits, than to value our selves as heirs of eternity.</P>
<P>It is very great satisfaction to con∣sider the best and wisest of mankind in all nations and ages, asserting, as with one voice, this their birth-right, and to find it ratify'd by an express revelation. At the same time, if we turn our thoughts inward upon our∣selves, we may meet with a kind of secret sense concurring with the proofs of our own immortality.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="296"/>
You have, in my opinion, raised a good presumptive argument from the encreasing appetite the mind has to knowledge, and to the extending its own faculties, which cannot be accom∣plished, as the more restrained perfe∣ction of lower creatures may, in the limits of a short life. I think another probable conjecture may be raised from our appetite to duration it self, and from a reflection on our progress thro' the several stages of it: <HI>We are com∣plaining,</HI> as you observe in a former speculation, <HI>of the shortness of life, and yet are perpetually hurrying over the parts of it, to arrive at certain little settlements or imaginary points of rest, which are dis∣persed up and down in it.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us consider what happens to us when we arrive at these <HI>imaginary points of rest:</HI> Do we stop our motion, and sit down satisfied in the settlement we have gain'd? or are we not remo∣ving the boundary, and marking out new points of rest, to which we press forward with the like eagerness, and which cease to be such as fast as we at∣tain them? Our case is like that of a traveller upon the <HI>Alps,</HI> who should
<PB N="269" REF="297"/>
fancy that the top of the next hill must end his journey, because it terminates his prospect; but he no sooner arrives at it, than he sees new ground and other hills beyond it, and continues to travel on as before.</P>
<P>This is so plainly every man's con∣dition in life, that there is no one who has observed any thing, but may observe, that as fast as his time wears away, his appetite to something future remains. The use therefore I would make of it, is this; That since Nature (as some love to express it) does nothing in vain, or, to speak properly, since the Author of our Being has planted no wander∣ing passion in it, no desire which has not its object, Futurity is the proper object of the passion so constantly ex∣ercised about it; and this restlessness in the present, this assigning our selves over to farther stages of duration, this successive grasping at somewhat still to come, appears to me (whatever it may to others) as a kind of instinct or natu∣ral symptom which the mind of man has of its own immortality.</P>
<P>I take it at the same time for grant∣ed, that the Immortality of the soul is
<PB N="270" REF="298"/>
sufficiently established by other argu∣ments: and if so, this appetite, which otherwise would be very unaccountable and absurd, seems very reasonable, and adds strength to the conclusion. But I am amazed when I consider there are creatures capable of thought, who, in spite of every argument, can form to themselves a sullen satisfaction in thinking otherwise. There is some∣thing so pitifully mean in the inverted ambition of that man who can hope for annihilation, and please himself to think that his whole fabrick shall one day crumble into dust, and mix with the mass of inanimate Beings, that it equal∣ly deserves our admiration and pity. The mystery of such mens unbelief is not hard to be penetrated; and indeed amounts to nothing more than a sor∣did hope that they shall not be immor∣tal, because they dare not be so.</P>
<P>This brings me back to my first ob∣servation, and gives me occasion to say further, That as worthy actions spring from worthy thoughts, so worthy thoughts are likewise the consequence of worthy actions: But the wretch who has degraded himself below the cha∣racter
<PB N="271" REF="299" MS="y"/>
of immortality, is very willing to resign his pretensions to it, and to substitute in its room a dark negative happiness in his extinction of his Being.</P>
<P>The admirable <HI>Shakespear</HI> has given us a strong image of the unsupported condition of such a person in his last minutes, in the second part of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, where Cardinal <HI>Beau∣fort,</HI> who had been concerned in the mur∣ther of the good Duke <HI>Humphrey,</HI> is re∣presented on his death-bed. After some short confused speeches which shew an imagination disturbed with guilt, just as he is expiring, King <HI>Henry</HI> standing by him full of compassion, says,
<Q><L>Lord Cardinal! if thou think'st on heav'ns bliss,</L>
<L>Hold up thy hand, make signal of that hope!</L>
<L>He dies, and makes no sign!</L></Q></P>
<P>The despair which is here shewn, without a word or action on the part of the dying person, is beyond what could be painted by the most forcible expressions whatever.</P>
<P>I shall not pursue this thought fur∣ther, but only add, That as annihila∣tion is not be had with a wish, so it is the most abject thing in the world to
<PB N="272" REF="300"/>
wish it. What are honour, same, wealth or power, when compared with the ge∣nerous expectation of a Being without end, and a happiness adequate to that Being?</P>

<P>THE <HI>time present</HI> seldom affords suffi∣cient employment to the mind of man. Objects of pain or pleasure, love or admiration, do not lie thick enough together in life to keep the Soul in con∣stant action, and supply an immediate ex∣ercise to its faculties. In order, there∣fore, to remedy this defect, that the mind may not want business, but always have materials for thinking, she is endowed with certain powers, that can recal what is passed, and anticipate what is to come.</P>
<P>That wonderful faculty, which we call the Memory, is perpetually looking back, when we have nothing present to enter∣tain us. It is like those repositories in several animals, that are filled with stores
<PB N="273" REF="301"/>
of their former food, on which they may ruminate when their present pasture fails.</P>
<P>As the memory relieves the mind in her vacant moments, and prevents any chasms of thought by ideas of what is <HI>past,</HI> we have other faculties that agitate and employ her upon what <HI>is to come.</HI> These are the passions of hope and fear.</P>
<P>By these two passions we reach forward into futurity, and bring up to our pre∣sent thoughts objects that lie hid in the remotest depths of time. We suf∣fer misery, and enjoy happiness, before they are in Being; we can set the sun and stars forward, or lose sight of them by wandring into those retired parts of eternity, when the heavens and earth shall be no more.</P>
<P>By the way, who can imagine that the Existence of a creature is to be circum∣scribed by time, whose Thoughts are not? But I shall, in this paper, confine my self to that particular passion which goes by the name of Hope.</P>
<P>Our actual enjoyments are so few and transient, that man would be a very mi∣serable Being, were he not endowed with this passion, which gives him a taste of those good things that may possibly come
<PB N="274" REF="302"/>
into his possession. <HI>We should hope for every thing that is good,</HI> says the old Poet <HI>Linus, because there is nothing which may not be hoped for, and nothing but what the Gods are able to give us.</HI> Hope quickens all the still parts of life, and keeps the mind awake in her most remiss and indo∣lent hours. It gives habitual serenity and good humour. It is a kind of vital heat in the soul, that chears and gladdens her, when she does not attend to it. It makes pain easy, and labour pleasant.</P>
<P>Beside these several advantages which rise from <HI>Hope,</HI> there is another which is none of the least, and that is, its great efficacy in preserving us from setting too high a value on present enjoyments. The saying of <HI>Caesar</HI> is very well known. When he had given away all his estate in gratuities among his friends, one of them asked what he had left for himself; to which that great man replied, <HI>Hope.</HI> His natural magnanimity hindred him from prizing what he was certainly pos∣sessed of, and turned all his thoughts up∣on something more valuable that he had in view. I question not but every rea∣der will draw a moral from this story, and apply it to himself without my direction.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="303"/>The old story of <HI>Pandora</HI>'s box (which) many of the learned believe was formed among the Heathens upon the tradition of the fall of man) shews us how deplo∣rable a state they thought the present life, without Hope: To set forth the ut∣most condition of misery they tell us, that our forefather, according to the Pa∣gan Theology, had a great vessel pre∣sented him by <HI>Pandora:</HI> Upon his lifting up the lid of it, says the fable, there flew out all the calamities and distempers in∣cident to men, from which, till that time, they had been altogether exempt. <HI>Hope,</HI> who had been enclosed in the cup with so much bad company, instead of flying of with the rest, stuck so close to the lid of it, that it was shut down up∣on her.</P>
<P>I shall make but two reflections upon what I have hitherto said. First, that no kind of life is so happy as that which is full of hope, especially when the hope is well grounded, and when the object of it is of an exalted kind, and in its na∣ture proper to make the person happy who enjoys it. This proposition must be very evident to those who consider how few are the present enjoyments of
<PB N="276" REF="304"/>
the most happy man, and how insuffi∣cient to give him an entire satisfaction and acquiescence in them.</P>
<P>My next observation is this, That a religious life is that which most abounds in a well-grounded Hope, and such an one as is fixed on objects that are capa∣ble of making us entirely happy. This hope in a religious man, is much more sure and certain than the hope of any temporal blessing, as it is strengthened not only by reason, but by faith. It has at the same time its eye perpetually fixed on that state, which implies in the very notion of it the most full and the most compleat happiness.</P>
<P>I have before shewn how the influ∣ence of hope in general sweetens life, and makes our present condition sup∣portable, if not pleasing; but a religious hope has still greater advantages. It does not only bear up the mind under her sufferings, but makes her rejoice in them, as they may be the instruments of pro∣curing her the great and ultimate end of all her hope.</P>
<P>Religious hope has likewise this ad∣vantage above any other kind of hope, that it is able to revive the <HI>dying</HI> man,
<PB N="277" REF="305"/>
and to fill his mind not only with secret comfort and refreshment, but sometimes with rapture and transport. He triumphs in his agonies, whilst the soul springs forward with delight to the great ob∣ject which she has always had in view, and leaves the body with an expectation of being re-united to her in a glorious and joyful resurrection.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Essay with those em∣phatical expressions of a lively hope, which the Psalmist made use of in the midst of those dangers and adversities which sur∣rounded him; for the following passage had its present and personal, as well as its fu∣ture and prophetick sense. <HI>I have set the Lord always before me: Because he is at right hand I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>SPECTATOR.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been usual to remind persons of rank, on great occasions in life, of their race and quality, and to what expectations they were born; that by considering what is worthy of them, they may be withdrawn from mean pursuits, and encouraged to laudable undertakings. This is turning Nobility into a principle of virtue, and making it productive of merit, as it is under∣stood to have been originally a reward of it.</P>
<P>It is for the like reason, I imagine, that you have in some of your specula∣tions asserted to your readers the <HI>Dig∣nity of Human Nature.</HI> But you can∣not be insensible that this is a contro∣verted doctrine; there are Authors who consider human nature in a very diffe∣rent view, and books of maxims have been written to shew the <HI>Falsity of all Human Virtues.</HI> The reflections which
<PB N="279" REF="307"/>
are made on this subject usually take some tincture from the tempers and characters of those that make them. Politicians can resolve the most shining actions among men into artifice and design; others, who are soured by dis∣content, repulses, or ill usage, are apt to mistake their spleen for philosophy; men of profligate lives, and such as find themselves incapable of rising to any distinction among their fellow-crea∣tures, are for pulling down all appea∣rances of merit, which seem to upbraid them: and Satirists describe nothing but deformity. From all these hands we have such draughts of mankind as are represented in those burlesque pi∣ctures, which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Caraca∣tura's</HI>; where the art consists in pre∣serving, amidst distorted proportions and aggravated features, some distin∣guishing likeness of the person, but in such a manner as to transform the most agreeable beauty into the most odious monster.</P>
<P>It is very disingenuous to level the best of mankind with the worst, and for the faults of particulars to degrade the whole species. Such methods tend
<PB N="280" REF="308"/>
not only to remove a man's good opi∣nion of others, but to destroy that re∣verence for himself, which is a great guard of innocence, and a spring of virtue.</P>
<P>It is true indeed that there are sur∣prizing mixtures of beauty and defor∣mity, of wisdom and folly, virtue and vice in the human make; such a dis∣parity is found among numbers of the same kind, and every individual, in some instances, or at some times, is so unequal to himself, that <HI>man</HI> seems to be the most wavering and inconsistent Being in the whole Creation. So that the question in morality, concerning the dignity of our nature, may at first sight appear like some difficult que∣stions in natural Philosophy, in which the arguments on both sides seem to be of equal strength. But as I began with considering this point, as it re∣lates to action, I shall here borrow an admirable reflection from Monsieur <HI>Pascal,</HI> which I think sets it in its pro∣per light.</P>
<P><HI>It is of dangerous consequence,</HI> says he, <HI>to represent to man how near he is to the level of beasts, without shewing him at the
<PB N="281" REF="309"/>
same time his</HI> Greatness. <HI>It is likewise dangerous to let him see his</HI> Greatness <HI>without his</HI> Meanness. <HI>It is more dange∣rous yet to leave him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he should be made sensible of both.</HI> Whatever imperfecti∣ons we may have in our nature, it is the business of religion and virtue to rectify them, as far as is consistent with our present state, In the mean time, it is no small encouragement to gene∣rous minds to consider that we shall put them all off with our mortality. That sublime manner of salutation with which the <HI>Jews</HI> approached their Kings,
<Q><HI>O King,</HI> live for ever!</Q>
may be addressed to the lowest and most despised mortal among us, under all the infirmities and distresses with which we see him surrounded. And whoever believes the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> will not need a better argument for the dignity of his nature, nor a stronger incitement to actions suitable to it.</P>
<P>I am naturally led by this reflection to a subject I have already touched up∣on
<PB N="282" REF="310"/>
in a former letter, and cannot with∣out pleasure call to mind the thoughts of <HI>Cicero</HI> to this purpose, in the close of his book concerning <HI>Old Age.</HI> Every one who is acquainted with his writings will remember that the elder <HI>Cato</HI> is introduced in that discourse as the Speaker, and <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius</HI> as his Auditors. This venerable person is re∣presented looking forward as it were from the verge of extreme old age, in∣to a future state, and rising into a con∣templation on the unperishable part of his nature, and its existence after death. I shall collect part of his discourse. And as you have formerly offered some arguments for the Soul's Immortality, agreeable both to reason and the Chri∣stian doctrine, I believe your readers will not be displeased to see how the same great truth shines in the pomp of <HI>Roman</HI> eloquence.</P>
<P>This, says <HI>Cato,</HI> is my firm, persua∣sion, that since the human Soul exerts it self with so great activity, since it has such a remembrance of the Past, such a concern for the Future, since it is en∣riched with so many arts, sciences, and discoveries, it is impossible but the
<PB N="283" REF="311"/>
Being which contains all these must be Immortal.</P>
<P>The elder <HI>Cyrus,</HI> just before his death, is represented by XENOPHON speaking after this manner.<Q REND="margQuotes">Think not, my dearest Children, that when I depart from you I shall be no more, but remember, that my Soul, even while I lived among you, was invisible to you; yet by my acti∣ons you were senfible it existed in this body. Believe it therefore existing still, though it be still unseen. How quickly would the honours of illustrious men perish after death, if their Souls performed nothing to preserve their fame? For my own part, I could never think that the Soul while in a mortal body, lives; but when departed out of it, dies; or that its consciousness is lost when it is discharged out of an unconscious habitation. But when it is freed from all corporeal al∣liance, then it truly exists. Further, since the human frame is broken by death, tell us what becomes of its parts? It is visible whether the materials of other Beings are translated, namely, to the source from whence they had their birth. The soul a∣lone, neither present nor departed, is the object of our eyes.</Q></P>

Thus <HI>Cyrus.</HI> But to proceed. No one shall persuade me, <HI>Scipio,</HI> that your wor∣thy Father, or your Grandfathers <HI>Paulus</HI> and <HI>Africanus,</HI> or <HI>Africanus</HI> his Father, or Uncle, or many other excellent men whom I need not name, performed so many actions to be remembred by posterity, without being sensible that Futurity was their right. And, if I may be allowed an old man's privi∣lege, to speak of my self, do you think I would have endured the fatigue of so many wearisome days and nights both at home and abroad, if I ima∣gined that the same boundary which is set to my life must terminate my glo∣ry? Were it not more desirable to have worn out my days in ease and tranquility, free from labour, and with∣out emulation? But I know not how, my Soul has always raised it self, and looked forward on futurity, in this view and expectation, that when it shall depart out of life, it shall then live for ever; and if this were not true, that the Mind is immortal, the Souls of the most worthy would not, above all others, have the strongest impulse to glory.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="317"/>
What besides this is the cause that the wisest men die with the greatest aequanimity, the ignorant with the greatest concern? Does it not seem that those minds which have the most extensive views, foresee they are re∣moving to a happier condition, which those of a narrower sight do not per∣ceive? I, for my part, am transported with the hope of seeing your ancestors, whom I have honoured and loved, and am earnestly desirous of meeting not only those excellent persons whom I have known, but those too of whom I have heard and read, and of whom I my self have written; nor would I be detained from so pleasing a Jour∣ney. O happy day, when I shall escape from this croud, this heap of pollu∣tion, and be admitted to that divine assembly of exalted spirits!

<P>A Lewd young fellow seeing an aged Hermit go by him barefoot, <HI>Father,</HI> says he, <HI>you are in a very miserable condition if there is not another world. True, Son,</HI> said the Hermit; <HI>but what is thy condition if there is?</HI> Man is a creature designed for two different states of Being, or ra∣ther, for two different Lives. His first life is short and transient; his second permanent and lasting. The question we are all concerned in is this, In which of these two lives it is our chief interest to make our selves happy? Or, in other words, Whether we should endeavour to secure to ourselves the pleasures and
<PB N="287" REF="319"/>
gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its utmost length of a very inconsiderable duration; or to secure to our selves the pleasures of a life which is fixed and settled, and will ne∣ver end? Every man, upon the first hear∣ing of this question, knows very well which side of it he ought to close with. But however right we are in Theory, it is plain that in Practice we adhere to the wrong side of the question. We make provisions for this life as tho' it were ne∣ver to have an End, and for the other life as tho' it were never to have a Be∣ginning.</P>
<P>Should a Spirit of superior rank who is a stranger to human nature, acciden∣tally alight upon the earth, and take a survey of its inhabitants; what would his notions of us be? Would not he think that we are a species of Beings made for quite different ends and pur∣poses than what we really are? Must not he imagine that we were placed in this world to get riches and honours? Would not he think that it was our duty to toil after wealth, and station, and title? Nay, would not he believe we were forbidden Poverty by threats of eternal punishment,
<PB N="288" REF="320"/>
and enjoined to pursue our pleasures un∣der pain of Damnation? He would cer∣tainly imagine that we were influenced by a scheme of duties quite opposite to those which are indeed prescribed to us. And truly, according to such an imagi∣nation, he must conclude that we are a species of the most obedient creatures in the universe; that we are constant to our duty; and that we keep a steddy eye on the end for which we were sent hither.</P>
<P>But how great would be his astonish∣ment, when he learnt that we were Be∣ings not designed to exist in this world above threescore and ten years? and that the greatest part of this busie species fall short even of that age? How would he be lost in horrour and admiration, when he should know that this sett of creatures, who lay out all their endeavours for this life, which scarce deserves the name of Existence, when, I say, he should know that this sett of creatures are to exist to all eternity in another life, for which they make no preparations? Nothing can be a greater disgrace to reason, than that men, who are persuaded of these two different states of Being, should be perpetually em∣ployed in providing for a life of threescore
<PB N="289" REF="321"/>
and ten years, and neglecting to make provision for that, which after many myriads of years will be still new, and still beginning; especially when we con∣sider that our endeavours for making our∣selves great, or rich, or honourable, or whatever else we place our happiness in, may after all prove unsuccessful; where∣as if we constantly and sincerely endea∣vour to make ourselves happy in the o∣ther life, we are sure that our endeavours will succeed, and that we shall not be disappointed of our hope.</P>
<P>The following question is started by one of the Schoolmen. Supposing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or mass of the finest sand, and that a single grain or particle of this sand should be annihilated every thousand years. Supposing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious mass of sand was consu∣ming by this slow method 'till there was not a grain of it left, on condition you were to be miserable for ever after; or, supposing that you might be happy for ever after, on condition you would be miserable 'till the whole mass of sand were thus annihilated at the rate of one sand in
<PB N="290" REF="322"/>
a thousand years: Which of these two cases would you make your choice?</P>
<P>It must be confessed in this case, so many thousands of years are to the ima∣gination as a kind of Eternity, tho' in reality they do not bear so great a pro∣portion to that duration which is to follow them, as an Unite does to the greatest number which you can put together in figures, or as one of those sands to the supposed heap. Reason therefore tells us, without any manner of hesitation, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our reason might in such case be so overset by the imagination, as to dispose some persons to sink under the consideration of the great length of the first part of this duration, and of the great distance of that second duration which is to suc∣ceed it. The mind, I say, might give it self up to that happiness which is at hand, considering that it is so very near, and that it would last so very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will chuse to be happy for the space only of threescore and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might say of only a day or
<PB N="291" REF="323"/>
an hour, and miserable to all eternity; or, on the contrary, miserable for this short term of years, and happy for a whole Eternity: What words are suffi∣cient to express that folly and want of consideration which in such a case makes a wrong choice?</P>
<P>I here put the case even at the worst, by supposing (what seldom happens) that a course of virtue makes us miserable in this life: But if we suppose (as it gene∣rally happens) that virtue would make us more happy even in this life than a con∣trary course of vice; how can we suffi∣ciently admire the stupidity or madness of those persons who are capable of ma∣king so absurd a choice?</P>
<P>Every wise man therefore will consi∣der this life only as it may conduce to the happiness of the other, and chearful∣ly sacrifice the Pleasures of a few years to those of an Eternity.</P>

<P>THERE are none of your specu∣lations which please me more than those upon Infinitude and Eternity. You have already considered that part of E∣ternity which is past, and I wish you would give us your thoughts upon that which is to come.</P>
<P>Your readers will perhaps receive greater pleasure from this view of Eter∣nity than the former, since we have every one of us a concern in that which is to come: Whereas a specula∣tion on that which is past is rather cu∣rious than useful.</P>
<P>Besides, we can easily conceive it possible for successive duration never to have an end; tho', as you have justly observed, that Eternity which never had a beginning is altogether incom∣prehensible; That is, we can conceive an eternal duration which <HI>may be,</HI> tho' we cannot an eternal duration which <HI>hath been</HI>; or, if I may use the philoso∣phical

terms, we may apprehend a <HI>po∣tential</HI> though not an <HI>actual</HI> Eternity.</P>
<P>This notion of a future Eternity, which is natural to the mind of man, is an unanswerable argument that he is a Being designed for it: especially if we consider that he is capable of being virtuous or vicious here; that he hath faculties improvable to all Eternity; and by a proper or wrong employ∣ment of them, may be happy or mise∣rable throughout that infinite duration. Our idea indeed of this Eternity is not of an adequate or fixed nature, but is perpetually growing and enlarging it∣self toward the object, which is too big for human comprehension. As we are now in the beginnings of Exi∣stence, so shall we always appear to our selves as if we were for ever entring upon it. After a million or two of centuries, some considerable things, al∣ready past, may slip out of our memo∣ry; which, if it be not strengthned in a wonderful manner, may possibly for∣get that ever there was a Sun or Pla∣nets. And yet, notwithstanding the long race that we shall then have run, we shall still imagine our selves just

<BIBL>Cicero Somn. Scip.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE following Essay comes from the ingenious Author of the letter upon <HI>Novelty,</HI> printed in a late <HI>Spectator:</HI> The notions are drawn from the <HI>Platonick</HI> way of thinking, but as they contribute to raise the mind, and may inspire noble sentiments of our own future grandeur and happiness, I think it well deserves to be presented to the publick.</P>
<P>IF the universe be the creature of an In∣telligent Mind, this Mind could have no immediate regard to himself in pro∣ducing it. He needed not to make trial of his Omnipotence, to be informed what effects were within its reach: The world as existing in his eternal idea was then as beautiful as now it is drawn forth in∣to Being; and in the immense abyss of
<PB N="295" REF="327"/>
his Essence are contained far brighter scenes than will be ever set forth to view; it being impossible that the great Author of Nature should bound his own power by giving Existence to a system of crea∣tures so perfect that he cannot improve upon it by any other exertions of his Al∣mighty Will. Between finite and infi∣nite there is an unmeasured interval, not to be filled up in endless ages; for which reason, the most excellent of all God's works must be equally short of what his power is able to produce as the most im∣perfect, and may be exceeded with the same ease.</P>
<P>This thought hath made some ima∣gine, (what, it must be confest, is not impossible) that the unfathomed space is ever teeming with new births, the youn∣ger still inheriting a greater perfection than the elder. But as this doth not fall within my present view, I shall content my self with taking notice, that the con∣sideration now mentioned proves undeni∣ably, that the ideal worlds in the Divine Understanding yield a prospect incom∣parably more ample, various and delight∣ful than any created world can do: And that therefore as it is not to be supposed
<PB N="296" REF="328"/>
that God should make a world merely of inanimate matter, however diversified; or inhabited only by creatures of no higher an order than brutes; so the end for which he designed his reasonable off∣spring is the contemplation of his works, the enjoyment of himself, and in both to be happy, having, to this purpose, en∣dowed them with correspondent facul∣ties and desires. He can have no greater pleasure from a bare review of his works, than from the survey of his own ideas, but we may be assured that he is well pleased in the satisfaction derived to Be∣ings capable of it, and, for whose enter∣tainment, he hath erected this immense theatre. Is not this more than an inti∣mation of our Immortality? Man, who when considered as on his probation for a happy Existence hereafter is the most remarkable instance of Divine Wisdom; if we cut him off from all relation to E∣ternity, is the most wonderful and un∣accountable composition in the whole creation. He hath capacities to lodge a much greater variety of knowledge than he will be ever master of, and an unsatisfied curiosity to tread the secret paths of nature and providence: But,
<PB N="297" REF="329"/>
with this, his organs, in their present structure, are rather fitted to serve the necessities of a vile body, than to mini∣ster to his understanding? and from the little spot to which he is chained, he can frame but wandering guesses concerning the innumerable worlds of light that en∣compass him, which, tho' in themselves of a prodigious bigness, do but just glimmer in the remote spaces of the hea∣vens; and, when with a great deal of time and pains he hath laboured a little way up the steep ascent of truth, and beholds with pity the groveling multi∣tude beneath, in a moment, his foot slides, and he tumbles down headlong into the grave.</P>
<P>Thinking on this, I am obliged to be∣lieve, in justice to the Creator of the world, that there is another state when man shall be better situated for contem∣plation, or rather have it in his power to remove from object to object, and from world to world; and be accommo∣dated with senses, and other helps, for making the quickest and most amazing discoveries. How doth such a genius as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> from amidst the darkness that involves human under∣standing,
<PB N="298" REF="330"/>
break forth, and appear like one of another species! The vast machine, we inhabit, lies open to him, he seems not unacquainted with the general laws that govern it; and while with the tran∣sport of a Philosopher he beholds and admires the glorious work, he is capable of paying at once a more devout and more rational homage to his maker. But alas! how narrow is the prospect even of such a mind? and how obscure to the compass that is taken in by the ken of an Angel; or of a Soul but newly escaped from its imprisonment in the bo∣dy! For my part, I freely indulge my soul in the confidence of its future gran∣deur; it pleases me to think that I who know so ssmall a portion of the works of the Creator, and with slow and painful steps creep up and down on the surface of this globe, shall e'er long shoot away with the swiftness of imagination, trace out the hidden springs of nature's ope∣rations, be able to keep pace with the heavenly bodies in the rapidity of their career, be a spectator of the long chain of events in the natural and moral worlds, visit the several apartments of the crea∣tion, know how they are furnished and
<PB N="299" REF="331"/>
how inhabited, comprehend the order, and measure the magnitudes, and distan∣ces of those orbs, which to us seem dis∣posed without any regular design, and set all in the same circle; observe the dependance of the parts of each system, and (if our minds are big enough to grasp the theory) of the several systems upon one another, from whence results the harmony of the universe. In Eternity a great deal may be done of this kind. I find it of use to cherish this generous ambition; for besides the secret refresh∣ment it diffuses through my soul, it en∣gages me in an endeavour to improve my faculties, as well as to exercise them conformably to the rank I now hold a∣mong reasonable Beings, and the hope I have of being once advanced to a more exalted station.</P>
<P>The other, and that the ultimate end of man, is the enjoyment of God, be∣yond which he cannot form a wish. Dim at best are the conceptions we have of the Supreme Being, who, as it were, keeps his creatures in suspence, neither discovering, nor hiding himself; by which means, the Libertine hath a handle to dis∣pute his Existence, while the most are
<PB N="300" REF="332"/>
content to speak him fair, but in their hearts prefer every trifling satisfaction to the favour of their Maker, and ridicule the good man for the singularity of his choice. Will there not a time come, when the Free-thinker shall see his im∣pious schemes overturned, and be made a convert to the truths he hates; when deluded mortals shall be convinced of the folly of their pursuits, and the few wise who followed the guidance of heaven, and, scorning the blandishments of sense and the sordid bribery of the world, as∣pired to a celestial abode, shall stand pos∣sessed of their utmost wish in the vision of the Creator? Here the mind heaves a thought now and then towards him, and hath some transient glances of his Pre∣sence: When, in the instant it thinks it self to have the fastest hold, the object eludes its expectations, and it falls back tired and baffled to the ground. Doubt∣less there is some more perfect way of conversing with heavenly Beings. Are not Spirits capable of mutual intelli∣gence, unless immersed in bodies, or by their intervention? Must superior natures depend on inferior for the main privi∣lege of sociable Beings, that of conver∣sing
<PB N="301" REF="333"/>
with them, and knowing each other? What would they have done, had mat∣ter never been created? I suppose, not have lived in eternal solitude. As incor∣poreal substances are of a nobler order, so be sure, their manner of intercourse is answerably more expedite and inti∣mate. This method of communication, we call intellectual Vision, as somewhat analogous to the sense of seeing, which is the medium of our acquaintance with this visible world. And in some such way can God make himself the object of immediate intuition to the Blessed; and as he can, 'tis not improbable that he will, always condescending, in the cir∣cumstances of doing it, to the weakness and proportion of finite minds. His works but faintly reflect the Image of his Perfections, 'tis a second-hand know∣ledge: To have a just idea of him, it may be necessary that we see him as he is. But what is that? 'Tis something, that never entered into the heart of man to conceive; yet, what we can easi∣ly conceive, will be a fountain of un∣speakable, of everlasting rapture. All created glories will fade and die away in his Presence. Perhaps it will be my hap∣piness

<P>IN compassion to those gloomy mor∣tals, who by their unbelief are ren∣dered incapable of feeling those impres∣sions of joy and hope, which the ce∣lebration of the late glorious <HI>Easter</HI> festi∣val naturally leaves on the mind of a Christian, I shall in this paper endeavour to evince that there are grounds to ex∣pect a future state, without supposing in the reader any faith at all, not even the belief of a Deity. Let the most sted∣fast unbeliever open his eyes, and take a survey of the sensible world, and then say if there be not a connexion, an ad∣justment, an exact and constant order
<PB N="303" REF="335"/>
discoverable in all the parts of it. What∣ever be the cause, the thing it self is evi∣dent to all our faculties. Look into the animal system, the passions, senses, and locomotive powers; is not the like con∣trivance and propriety observable in these too? Are they not fitted to certain ends, and are they not by nature directed to proper objects?</P>
<P>Is it possible then that the smallest bo∣dies should, by a management superior to the wit of man, be disposed in the most excellent manner agreeable to their respective natures; and yet the Spirits or Souls of men be neglected, or managed by such rules as fall short of man's un∣derstanding? Shall every other passion be rightly placed by nature, and shall that appetite of Immortality natural to all mankind be alone misplaced, or designed to be frustrated? Shall the industrious application of the inferior animal powers in the meanest vocations be answered by the ends we propose, and shall not the generous efforts of a virtuous mind be rewarded? In a word, Shall the corpo∣real world be all order and harmony, the intellectual discord and confusion? He who is Bigot enough to believe these
<PB N="304" REF="336"/>
things, must bid adieu to that natural rule, of <HI>reasoning from Analogy</HI>; must run counter to that maxim of common sense, <HI>That men ought to form their judgments of things unexperienced from what they have experienced.</HI></P>
<P>If any thing looks like a recompence of calamitous virtue on this side the grave, it is either an assurance that there∣by we obtain the favour and protection of heaven, and shall, whatever befalls us in this, in another life meet with a just return; or else that applause and repu∣tation, which is thought to attend vir∣tuous actions. The former of these, our <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> out of their singular wis∣dom, and benevolence to makind, en∣deavour to erase from the minds of men. The latter can never be justly distributed in this life, where so many ill actions are reputable, and so many good actions dis∣esteemed or misinterpreted; where sub∣tile hypocrisy is placed in the most en∣gaging light, and modest virtue lies concealed; where the heart and the soul are hid from the eyes of men, and the eyes of men are dimmed and vitiated. <HI>Plato</HI>'s sense in relation to this point is contained in his <HI>Gorgias,</HI> where he in∣troduces
<PB N="305" REF="337"/>
<HI>Socrates</HI> speaking after this man∣ner.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">It was in the reign of <HI>Saturn</HI> pro∣vided by a law, which the Gods have since continued down to this time, That they who had lived virtuously and piously upon earth, should after death enjoy a life full of happiness, in cer∣tain Islands appointed for the habi∣tation of the Blessed: But that such as had lived wickedly should go into the receptacle of damned Souls, named <HI>Tar∣tarus,</HI> there to suffer the punishments they deserved. But in all the reign of <HI>Saturn,</HI> and in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Jove,</HI> living judges were ap∣pointed, by whom each person was judged in his life-time in the same day on which he was to die. The conse∣quence of which was, that they often passed wrong judgments. <HI>Pluto,</HI> there∣fore, who presided in <HI>Tartarus,</HI> and the Guardians of the blessed Islands, finding that on the other side many unfit per∣sons were sent to their respective domi∣nions, complain'd to <HI>Jove,</HI> who pro∣mised to redress the evil. He added, the reason of these unjust proceedings are that men are judged in the body.
<PB N="306" REF="338"/>
Hence many conceal the blemishes and imperfections of their minds by beauty, birth and riches; not to mention, that at the time of trial there are crowds of witnesses to attest their having lived well. These things mis-lead the judges, who being themselves also of the num∣ber of the living, are surrounded each with his own body, as with a veil thrown over his mind. For the fu∣ture, therefore, it is my intention that men do not come on their trial till af∣ter death, when they shall appear be∣fore the judge, disrobed of all their corporeal ornaments. The judge him∣self too shall be a pure unveiled spirit, beholding the very soul, the naked soul of the party before him. With this view I have already constituted my sons, <HI>Minos</HI> and <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> judges, who are natives of <HI>Asia</HI>; and <HI>Aeacus,</HI> a native of <HI>Europe.</HI> These, after death, shall hold their court in a certain mea∣dow, from which there are two roads, leading the one to <HI>Tartarus,</HI> the other to the Islands of <HI>the Blessed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From this, as from numberless other passages of his writings, may be seen <HI>Plato</HI>'s opinion of a Future State. A thing
<PB N="307" REF="339"/>
therefore in regard to us so comfortable, in itself so just and excellent, a thing so agreeable to the analogy of nature, and so universally credited by all orders and ranks of men, of all nations and ages, what is it that should move a few men to reject? Surely there must be something of prejudice in the case. I appeal to the secret thoughts of a <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> if he does not argue within himself after this manner: The senses and faculties I enjoy at present are visibly designed to repair, or preserve the body from the injuries it is liable to in its present circumstances. But in an eternal state where no decays are to be repaired, no outward injuries to be fenced against, where there are no flesh and bones, nerves or blood-vessels, there will certanly be none of the Senses: and that there should be a state of life without the Senses is inconceivable?</P>
<P>But as this manner of reasoning pro∣ceeds from a poverty of imagination, and narrowness of Soul in those that use it, I shall endeavour to remedy those de∣fects, and open their views, by laying before them a case which, being natural∣ly possible, may perhaps reconcile them to
<PB N="308" REF="340"/>
the belief of what is supernaturally re∣vealed.</P>
<P>Let us suppose a person blind and deaf from his birth, who being grown to man's estate, is by the Dead-palsy, or some other cause, deprived of his Feel∣ing, Tasting, and Smelling; and at the same time has the impediment of his Hearing removed, and the film taken from his eyes: What the five Senses are to us, that the Touch, Taste and Smell were to him. And any other ways of perception of a more refined and exten∣sive nature were to him as inconceivable, as to us those are which will one day be adapted to perceive those things which <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to con∣ceive.</HI> And it would be just as reason∣able in him to conclude, that the loss of those three Senses could not possibly be succeeded by any new inlets of percep∣tion; as in a modern <HI>Free-thinker</HI> to ima∣gine there can be no state of life and per∣ception without the Senses he enjoys at present. Let us further suppose the same person's eyes, at their first opening, to be struck with a great variety of the most
<PB N="309" REF="341"/>
gay and pleasing objects, and his ears with a melodious consort of vocal and instrumental musick: Behold him ama∣zed, ravished, transported; and you have some distant representation, some faint and glimmering idea of the ecstatic state of the Soul in that article in which she emerges from this Sepulchre of flesh into life and immortality.</P>

<P>THE same faculty of Reason and Understanding, which placeth us above the Brute part of the Creation, doth also subject our minds to greater and more manifold disquiets than crea∣tures of an inferior rank are sensible of. It is by this that we anticipate future disasters, and oft create to ourselves real pain from imaginary evils, as well as multiply the pangs arising from those which cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>It behoves us therefore to make the best use of that sublime talent, which,
<PB N="310" REF="342"/>
so long as it continues the instrument of passion, will serve only to make us more miserable, in proportion as we are more excellent than other Beings.</P>
<P>It is the privilege of a Thinking Be∣ing to withdraw from the objects that sollicit his senses, and turn his thoughts inward on himself. For my own part, I often mitigate the pain arising from the little misfortunes and disappoint∣ments that chequer human life by this introversion of my faculties, wherein I regard my own Soul as the image of her Creator, and receive great consola∣tion from beholding those perfections which testify her Divine Original, and lead me into some knowledge of her e∣verlasting Archetype.</P>
<P>But there is not any property or cir∣cumstance of my Being that I contem∣plate with more joy than my Immorta∣lity. I can easily overlook any present momentary sorrow, when I reflect that it is in my power to be happy a thou∣sand years hence. If it were not for this thought, I had rather be an Oyster than a Man, the most stupid and senseless of animals than a reasonable mind tortured
<PB N="311" REF="343"/>
with an extream innate desire of that perfection which it despairs to ob∣tain.</P>
<P>It is with great pleasure that I be∣hold Instinct, Reason and Faith con∣curring to attest this comfortable truth. It is revealed from Heaven, it is disco∣vered by Philosophers, and the ignorant, unenlightened part of mankind have a natural propensity to believe it. It is an agreeable entertainment to reflect on the various shapes under which this do∣ctrine has appeared in the world. The <HI>Pythagorean</HI> transmigration, the sensual habitations of the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and the shady realms of <HI>Pluto,</HI> do all agree in the main points, the continuation of our Existence, and the distribution of rewards and punishments, proportioned to the merits or demerits of men in this life.</P>
<P>But in all these schemes there is some∣thing gross and improbable, that shocks a reasonable and speculative mind. Where∣as nothing can be more rational and sub∣lime than the Christian idea of a future State. <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of
<PB N="312" REF="344"/>
man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for those that love him.</HI> The above-mentioned schemes are narrow transcripts of our present state: But in this indefinite description there is something ineffably great and noble. The mind of man must be raised to a higher pitch, not only to partake the enjoyments of the Christian Paradise, but even to be able to frame any notion of them.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, in order to gratify our imagination, and by way of condescen∣sion to our low way of thinking, the Ideas of Light, Glory, a Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made use of to adumbrate that which we cannot directly understand. <HI>The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them into living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe a∣way all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away, and behold all things are new. There shall be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the sun: for the Lord God giveth them light, and shall make them
<PB N="313" REF="345"/>
drink of the river of his pleasures: and they shall reign for ever and ever. They shall receive a crown of glory which fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>These are chearing reflections: And I have often wondered that men could be found so dull and phlegmatick, as to prefer the thought of annihilation before them; or so ill-natur'd, as to endeavour to persuade mankind to the disbelief of what is so pleasing and profitable even in the prospect; or so blind, as not to see that there is a Deity, and if there be, that this scheme of things flows from his attributes, and evidently corre∣sponds with the other parts of his cre∣ation.</P>
<P>I know not how to account for this absurd turn of thought, except it pro∣ceed from a want of other employment joined with an affectation of singularity. I shall, therefore, inform our modern <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> of two points, whereof they seem to be ignorant. The first is, that it is not the being singular, but be∣ing singular for something that argues either extraordinary endowments of na∣ture, or benevolent intentions to man∣kind,
<PB N="314" REF="346"/>
which draws the admiration and esteem of the world. A mistake in this point naturally arises from that con∣fusion of thought which I do not re∣member to have seen so great instances of in any Writers, as in certain modern <HI>Free-Thinkers.</HI></P>
<P>The other point is, that there are innumerable objects within the reach of a human mind, and each of these objects may be viewed in innumerable lights and positions, and the relations arising between them are innumerable. There is, therefore, an infinity of things whereon to employ their thoughts, if not with advantage to the world, at least with amusement to themselves, and without offence or prejudice to other people. If they proceed to exert their talent of <HI>Free-thinking</HI> in this way; they may be innocently dull, and no one take any notice of it. But to see men with∣out either Wit or Argument pretend to run down Divine and Human Laws, and treat their fellow-subjects with con∣tempt for professing a belief of those points on which the present as well as future interest of Mankind depends, is
<PB N="315" REF="347"/>
not to be endured. For my own part, I shall omit no endeavours to render their persons as despicable, and their practices as odious, in the eye of the world, as they deserve.</P>

<P>THE following Letter comes to me from that excellent man in Holy Orders, whom I have men∣tioned more than once as one of that society who assist me in my specula∣tions. It is a <HI>thought in sickness,</HI> and of a very serious nature, for which rea∣son I give it a place in the paper of this day.</P>
<LETTER REND="margQuotes">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE indisposition which has long hung upon me, is at last grown to such a head, that it must quickly
<PB N="317" REF="349"/>
make an end of me, or of it self. You may imagine, that whilst I am in this bad state of health, there are none of your works which I read with greater pleasure than your <HI>Saturday</HI>'s papers. I should be very glad if I could fur∣nish you with any hints for that day's entertainment. Were I able to dress up several thoughts of a serious na∣ture, which have made great impres∣sions on my mind during a long fit of sickness, they might not be an improper entertainment for that occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Among all the reflections which u∣sually rise in the mind of a sick man, who has time and inclination to con∣sider his approaching end, there is none more natural than that of his going to appear naked and unbodied before Him who made him. When a man considers, that as soon as the vital union is dissolved, he shall see that Supreme Being, whom he now con∣templates at a distance, and only in his works; or, to speak more philo∣sophically, when by some faculty in the Soul he shall apprehend the Di∣vine
<PB N="318" REF="350"/>
Being, and be more sensible of his Presence, than we are now of the Presence of any object which the eye beholds, a man must be lost in care∣lessness and stupidity, who is not a∣larmed at such a thought. Dr. <HI>Sher∣lock,</HI> in his excellent treatise upon death, has represented, in very strong and lively colours, the state of the Soul in its first separation from the Body, with regard to that invisible world which every where surrounds us, tho' we are not able to discover it through this grosser world of matter, which is accommodated to our senses in this life. His words are as follow.</P>
<P>That death, which is our leaving this world, is nothing else but our putting off these bodies, teaches us, that it is only our union to these bodies, which intercepts the sight of the other world: The other world is not at such a distance from us, as we may imagine; the throne of God indeed is at a great remove from this earth, above the third heavens, where he displays his glory to those blessed Spirits which encompass his throne; but as soon
<PB N="319" REF="351"/>
as we step out of these bodies, we step into the other world, which is not so pro∣perly another world, (for there is the same heaven and earth still) as a new state of life. To live in these bodies is to live in this world; to live out of them is to remove into the next: For while our Souls are confined to these bodies, and can look only through these material case∣ments, nothing but what is material can affect us; nay, nothing but what is so gross, that it can reflect light, and con∣vey the shapes and colours of things with it to the eye: So that though within this visible world, there be a more glorious scene of things than what appears to us, we perceive nothing at all of it; for this veil of flesh parts the visible and in∣visible world: But when we put off these bodies, there are new and surpri∣zing wonders present themselves to our views; when these material spectacles are taken off, the Soul, with its own naked eyes, sees what was invisible before: And then we are in the other world, when we can see it, and converse with it: Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, That <HI>when we are at home in the body,, we are absent from
<PB N="320" REF="352"/>
the Lord; but when we are absent from the body, we are present with the Lord, 2</HI> Cor. <HI>5.6, 8.</HI> And me∣thinks this is enough to cure us of our fondness for these bodies, unless we think it more desirable to be confined to a pri∣son, and to look through a grate all our lives, which gives us but a very narrow prospect, and that none of the best neither, than to be set at liberty to view all the glories of the world. What would we give now for the least glimpse of that in∣visible world, which the first step we take out of these bodies will present us with? There are such things <HI>as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to con∣ceive:</HI> Death opens our eyes, enlarges our prospect, presents us with a new and more glorious world, which we can never see while we are shut up in flesh; which should make us as willing to part with this veil, as to take the film off our eyes, which hinders our sight.</P>
<P>As a thinking man cannot but be very much affected with the idea of his appearing in the Presence of that
<PB N="321" REF="353"/>
Being <HI>whom none can see and live</HI>; he must be much more affected when he considers that this Being whom he appears before, will examine all the actions of his past life, and reward or punish him accordingly. I must con∣fess that I think there is no scheme of Religion, besides that of Christi∣anity, which can possibly support the most virtuous person under this thought. Let a man's innocence be what it will, let his virtues rise to the highest pitch of perfection attainable in this life, there will be still in him so many se∣cret sins, so many human frailties, so many offences of ignorance, passion and prejudice, so many unguarded words and thoughts, and, in short, so many defects in his best actions, that, with∣out the advantages of such an expia∣tion and atonement as Christianity has revealed to us, it is impossible that he should be cleared before his Sovereign Judge, or that he should be able <HI>to stand in his sight.</HI> Our holy Religion suggests to us the only means whereby our guilt may be taken away, and our imperfect obedience accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="354"/>

<P>THE prospect of death is so gloomy and dismal, that if it were con∣stantly before our eyes, it would imbit∣ter all the sweets of life. The gracious Author of our Being hath therefore so formed us, that we are capable of ma∣ny pleasing sensations and reflections,
<PB N="224" REF="356"/>
and meet with so many amusements and solicitudes, as divert our thoughts from dwelling upon an evil, which by rea∣son of its seeming distance, makes but languid impressions upon the mind. But how distant soever the time of our death may be, since it is certain that we must die, it is necessary to allot some portion of our life to consider the end of it; and it is highly convenient to fix some stated times to meditate upon the final period of our Existence here. The prin∣ciple of self-love, as we are men, will make us enquire, what is like to be∣come of us after our dissolution? and our conscience, as we are Christians, will inform us, that according to the good or evil of our actions here, we shall be translated to the mansions of eternal bliss or misery. When this is seriously weighed, we must think it madness to be unprepared against the black mo∣ment; but when we reflect that perhaps that black moment may be to-night, how watchful ought we to be!</P>
<P>I was wonderfully affected with a dis∣course I had lately with a Clergyman of my acquaintance upon this head,
<PB N="325" REF="357"/>
which was to this effect:
<Q REND="margQuotes">The consi∣deration, said the good man, that my Being is precarious, moved me many years ago to make a resolution, which I have diligently kept, and to which I owe the greatest satisfaction that a mortal man can enjoy. Every night before I address my self in private to my Creator, I lay my hand upon my heart, and ask my self, Whether if God should require my Soul of me this night, I could hope for mercy from him? The bitter agonies I un∣derwent, in this my first acquaintance with my self, were so far from throw∣ing me into despair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that they rather proved motives to greater circumspection in my future conduct. The oftner I exercised my self in me∣ditations of this kind, the less was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at first so terrible and shocking is become the sweetest of my enjoyments. These con∣templations have indeed made me se∣rious, but not sullen; nay, they are so far from having sour'd my temper
<PB N="326" REF="358"/>
that as I have a mind perfectly com∣posed, and a secret spring of joy in my heart, so my conversation is plea∣sant, and my countenance serene. I taste all the innocent satisfactions of life pure and sincere; I have no share in pleasures that leave a sting behind them, nor am I cheated with that kind of mirth, <HI>in the midst of which there is heaviness.</HI></Q></P>

<P>THE following letter was really writ∣ten by a young Gentleman in a lan∣guishing illness, which both himself, and those who attended him, thought it im∣possible for him to outlive.

<LETTER REND="margQuotes">
<PB N="327" REF="359"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU formerly observed to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the dispari∣ty we often find in him sick and well. Thus one of an unfortunate constitu∣tion is perpetually exhibiting a misera∣ble example of the weakness of his Mind, or of his Body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to consider my self in these different views, and hope I have received some advantage by it. If what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> says be true, that
<Q><L>The Soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>
<L>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made:</L></Q>
Then surely sickness, contributing no less than old-age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body, may dis∣cover the inclosed structure more plainly. Sickness is a sort of early old-age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state, and inspires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thousand volumes of Philosophers and
<PB N="328" REF="360"/>
Divines. It gives so warning a con∣cussion to those props of our vanity, our strength and youth, that we think of fortifying our selves within, when there is so little dependance on our out-works. Youth, at the very best, is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age: 'Tis like a stream that nou∣rishes a plant upon its bank, and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight, but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me; it has afforded several pro∣spects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the world have not dazzled me very much; and I began where most people end, with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition, and the unsa∣tisfactory nature of all human plea∣sures.</P>
<P>When a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcerned as was that honest <HI>Hiber∣nian,</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="361"/>
who (being in bed in the great storm some years ago, and told the house would tumble over his head) made answer, <HI>What care I for the house? I am only a lodger.</HI> I fancy 'tis the best time to die when one is in the best humour, and so excessively weak as I now am, I may say with consci∣ence, that I am not at all uneasie at the thought that many men, whom I never had any esteem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an inconsiderable little atome every single man is, with re∣spect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a shame to be concerned at the removal of such a trivial animal as I am. The morning after my <HI>Exit,</HI> the Sun will arise as bright as ever, the flowers smell as sweet, the plants spring as green, the world will proceed in its old course, people will laugh as heartily, and marry as fast as they were used to do. <HI>The memory of man</HI> (as it is elegantly exprest in the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon) passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day.</HI> There are reasons enough, in the fourth Chap∣ter
<PB N="330" REF="362"/>
of the same Book, to make any young man contented with the prospect of Death. <HI>For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, or is measured by number of years. But wisdom is the grey hair to men, and an unspotted life is old age.</HI> He was taken away speedily, lest that <HI>wickedness should alter his un∣derstanding, or deceit beguile his Soul.</HI></P>
