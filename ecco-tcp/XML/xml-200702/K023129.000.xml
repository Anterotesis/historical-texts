<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Reflections of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the Judgments past in this Epistle to <HI>Augustus,</HI> seem'd so seasonable to the present Times, that I could not help applying them to the use of my own Country. The Author thought them considerable enough to address them to His Prince; whom he paints with all the great and good Qualities of a Monarch, upon whom the <HI>Romans</HI> depended for the En∣crease of an <HI>Absolute Empire.</HI> But to make the Poem en∣tirely English, I was willing to add one or two such, as contribute to the Happiness of a <HI>Free People,</HI> and are more consistent with the Welfare of <HI>our Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>This Epistle will show the learned World to have fallen into two mistakes; one, that <HI>Augustus was a Patron of Poets in general;</HI> whereas he not only prohibited all but the Best Writers to name him, but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magistrate: <HI>Admonebat Praetores, ne paterentur Nomen suum obsolefieri,</HI> &amp;c. The other to imagine this Piece to be a <HI>general Discourse of Poetry;</HI> whereas it is an <HI>Apology for the Poets,</HI> in order to render <HI>Augustus</HI> more their Patron. <HI>Horace</HI> here pleads the Cause of his Cotemporaries, first against the Taste of the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Town, whose humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age; secondly against the Court and Nobi∣lity, who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and lastly against the Emperor himself, who had conceived them of little use to the Government. He shews (by a view of the Progress of Learning, and the Change of Taste a∣mong the <HI>Romans</HI>) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of <HI>Greece</HI> had given the Writers of his Time great advan∣tages over their Predecessors, that their <HI>Morals</HI> were much improved, and the Licence of those ancient Poets restrain∣ed: that <HI>Satire</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> were become more just and useful; that whatever extravagancies were left on the Stage, were owing to the Ill Taste of the Nobility; that Poets, under due Regulations, were in many respects use∣ful to the <HI>State;</HI> and concludes, that it was upon them the Emperor himself must depend, for his Fame with Poste∣rity.</P>
<P>We may farther learn from this Epistle, that <HI>Horace</HI> made his Court to this Great Prince, by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a just Contempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own Character.</P>
