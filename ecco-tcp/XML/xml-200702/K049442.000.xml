<HEAD>THE Fifteen Comforts, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>The First Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>BE Dumb ye Beggars of the Rhiming Trade</L>
<L>Geld the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose Wits, and let the Muse be Splaid</L>
<L>Charge not the Parish with the Bastard Phrase</L>
<L>Of <HI>Balm, Elixar,</HI> both the <HI>India</HI>'s,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Shrine, Saint, Sacriledge,</HI> and such as these</L>
<L>Expressions, common as their Mistresses.</L>
<L>Of her I write, no Pen can reach her Worth,</L>
<L>Nor find an Epithet to set her forth;</L>
<L>I mean Heroick <HI>Anne,</HI> our Gracious Queen,</L>
<L>In War Victorious, and in Pomp Serene;</L>
<L>The Circle of whose Reign contains all Bliss,</L>
<L>And daily studies <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Second Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now Sacred <HI>Anne</HI> does wear the <HI>British</HI> Crown,</L>
<L>The Church does flourish, and is lofty grown;</L>
<L>The Laws are risen from a long, long Trance,</L>
<L>And our uniting is a Check to <HI>France;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
Which Union even would make our Foes Bap∣tize</L>
<L>Themselves all Converts in our watry Eyes;</L>
<L>Which we for very Joy do weep, to see</L>
<L>How <HI>Anne</HI> designs to make Posterity</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or ever happy, whilst She's on the Throne,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n making <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> both as One.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Third Comfort</HEAD>
<L>Among the num'rous Throng, we <HI>Scots</HI> do come,</L>
<L>To wish the grand Support of <HI>Christendom</HI></L>
<L>Health, that's the Joy of Life, and Soul of Mirth,</L>
<L>Bane of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Comfort of our Birth:</L>
<L>May't with your Years, as clearly last and rise,</L>
<L>As 'twas e'er Winds had blasted Paradise!</L>
<L>Wealth! the Support of Pleasure and the Crown,</L>
<L>The only Prop of Glory and Renown.</L>
<L>May the same virtuous Temper, the same Fire,</L>
<L>That never flags too low, nor do's mount higher,</L>
<L>Enflame your Breast, and to't by Heaven be sent</L>
<L>That which all seek (but find not) true Content.</L>
<L>May all your Aims atchieve their purpos'd End,</L>
<L>Then Loyal <HI>Scotland</HI> ne'er will want a Friend,</L>
<L>To be the Guardian of their Church and State,</L>
<L>Whilst the <HI>Rose</HI> and <HI>Thistle</HI> do incorporate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fourth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Poor lousie, beggar'd <HI>France,</HI> &amp; half-starv'd <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Durst not presume t' appear upon the Main;</L>
<L>For now St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and St. <HI>George</HI> do joyn,</L>
<L>Upon the Ocean they'll in Glory shine.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Whose Union-Colours on the rolling Sea,</L>
<L>Will shew the Force of <HI>British</HI> Heraldry:</L>
<L>Thus on that Element the <HI>Scots</HI> too Fame</L>
<L>Will get, and to tho encient <HI>Scottish</HI> Name</L>
<L>Will Honour add, by having such a Fleet</L>
<L>That durst our Foe upon the Ocean meet,</L>
<L>And make them low'r their Top-sails too at Sea,</L>
<L>As owning that the only Sovereignty</L>
<L>Thereof is Sacred <HI>Anna</HI>'s Lawful Right,</L>
<L>For which Her Loyal Subjects too will Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fifth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>In a <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession now the Crown</L>
<L>Is fix'd, and none must mount the <HI>British</HI> Throne,</L>
<L>But what will the reformed Faith defend,</L>
<L>And to the Church of <HI>England</HI> be a Friend;</L>
<L>For by her Grandeur we supported be,</L>
<L>Whilst Conscience do's enjoy its Liberty.</L>
<L>And that which also gives our Hearts Content,</L>
<L>As that two Nations has one Parliament.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Sixth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>As to our Comforts what can more be said?</L>
<L>Freedom we have, and Intercourse of Trade,</L>
<L>To any Port or Place the Kingdom round;</L>
<L>Besides, all <HI>Scottish</HI> Ships that shall be found,</L>
<L>At Signing of this Treaty, on the Sea,</L>
<L>Of any sort of Foreign Built, shall be</L>
<L>As Ships of the Built of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> deem'd:</L>
<L>So much is <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Queen esteem'd,</L>
<L>That Her Indulgence makes us all conspire</L>
<L>To act, and to comply with Her Desire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>The Seventh Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now, now, old <HI>Scotland</HI> is for ever made,</L>
<L>Since (with the <HI>English)</HI> in the way of Trade,</L>
<L>We have the same Allowances, Restitutions,</L>
<L>Lawful Encouragements, and Prohibitions.</L>
<L>No Article the Loyal <HI>Scots</HI> do blame,</L>
<L>For Excise with us, as you, is all the same;</L>
<L>For seven Years we shall be Duty-free</L>
<L>In making Salt; and farthermore we see,</L>
<L>The Land-Tax will be very easie here,</L>
<L>The Yoak is light for any one to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Eighth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Duties on Paper Stamp'd we shall not pay,</L>
<L>Nor Duties which they do on Velome lay;</L>
<L>And farther to confirm us in our Rights,</L>
<L>We shall no Duty pay for Window-Lights;</L>
<L>Nay, Royal Favours still are more enlarg'd,</L>
<L>For Coals consum'd at Home we shan't be charg'd,</L>
<L>Nor charg'd with any Duty laid on Malt,</L>
<L>So if we won't unite, 'tis all our Fault:</L>
<L>Both Nations will be one, and we shall be</L>
<L>To all Intents as <HI>Englishmen</HI> (Sir) free;</L>
<L>All Animosities being laid aside,</L>
<L>In Love and Unity we shall take Pride,</L>
<L>And in Eternal Friendship so dispose</L>
<L>Our selves, as to be dreadful to our Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Ninth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>One <HI>British</HI> Parliament will now be made,</L>
<L>And we have an Equivalent in Trade:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
The Coin of the united Kingdoms too</L>
<L>Be all alike, that all may have their Due:</L>
<L>Our Weights and Measures too must be the same,</L>
<L>That People may not diff'rent Measures b lame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Tenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>The Laws concerning regulating Trade,</L>
<L>In favour of our Constitution's made;</L>
<L>The Court of Sessions must the same remain</L>
<L>As formerly, in this the present Reign;</L>
<L>All Misdemeanours done upon the Sea,</L>
<L>To be subject to the <HI>British</HI> Admiralty.</L>
<L>Nay, further to encrease our Happiness,</L>
<L>Men Offices for Life may still possess;</L>
<L>And yet to make us happy o'er again,</L>
<L>The Queen is pleas'd, that all the Rights remain</L>
<L>Of Royal <HI>Scottish</HI> Burroughs, as they now</L>
<L>At present are: What more can She allow?</L>
<L>Or we from Royal Bounty still require,</L>
<L>Since we have all as Subjects can desire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Eleventh Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>We shall have Lords and Commons too to sit</L>
<L>In Parliament, where're the Queen thinks fit,</L>
<L>Who will have all the Priviledges too,</L>
<L>That's really to their noble Peerage due;</L>
<L>The same as <HI>English</HI> Peers they will enjoy,</L>
<L>Which Treaty will the Hopes of <HI>France</HI> destroy</L>
<L>And that in time we may our Breaches heal,</L>
<L><HI>Great-Britain</HI> must but use one only Seal,</L>
<L>Quartered with those Arms as best may sure,</L>
<L>This Union, which makes <HI>ANNA</HI> absolute,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Empress Imperial over the Bless'd Realm,</L>
<L>Of which She does so wisely rule the Helm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Twelfth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>All Laws and Statutes in each Realm, so far</L>
<L>As to the Union they contrary are,</L>
<L>From and after it they cease, and shall be void,</L>
<L>That Liberty by us may be enjoy'd.</L>
<L>What can we then of <HI>England</HI> ask for more,</L>
<L>No greater Blessings they can have in store,</L>
<L>Than what are granted, so let's all sit down,</L>
<L>And drink the Health of <HI>Anne,</HI> who wears the Crown,</L>
<L>And wish Her long to Reign, that She may be</L>
<L>A Terror to the <HI>Gallick</HI> Monarchy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Thirteenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>The <HI>Scottish</HI> Parliament has done their best,</L>
<L>That these two Kingdoms may be doubly blest;</L>
<L>Upon the <HI>English</HI> Parliament we wait,</L>
<L>With low Submission for to know our Fate,</L>
<L>Hoping kind Heav'n will cause them to agree</L>
<L>To this long wish'd and hop'd for Unity,</L>
<L>Which surely will prove of such Consequence,</L>
<L>That it will be a Thorn i' th' side of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>And make them rue the Day that e'er we came</L>
<L>To be a People of one Crown, and Name:</L>
<L>For our uniting makes the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> fear,</L>
<L>Some dreadful Storm's to them approaching near.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>The Fourteenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now, now, the <HI>Scots</HI> with <HI>England</HI> do unite,</L>
<L><HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Maintenon</HI> are in a Fright;</L>
<L>Ye <HI>Spaniards</HI> too, your drooping Kingdom drench</L>
<L>Till Tears the Flames of <HI>Purgatory</HI> quench:</L>
<L>But you that can't cry, yet would seem to weep</L>
<L>Your Hankerchiefs in Holy Water steep,</L>
<L>Then Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Saints invoke,</L>
<L>To keep your Kingdom from the <HI>Frenchmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Yoke</L>
<L>But if ye'll still be Fools, and will not own</L>
<L>King <HI>Charles,</HI> by Force we'll put on him a Crown</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fifteenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Glory and Honour Crown great <HI>Anna</HI>'s N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></L>
<L>And let her Greatness shine with endless Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>For making such an Union that shall shake</L>
<L>Proud <HI>France,</HI> and make its haughty Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>So whilst we Praises to our Sovereign give,</L>
<L>Let's pray that <HI>Anne</HI> a <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Age may live</L>
