<HEAD>THE SPANISH DESCENT. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOng had this Nation been amus'd in vain</L>
<L>With Posts from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and News from <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>Or—d</HI>'s Conquests, and the Fleets Success,</L>
<L>And Favours from the <HI>Moors</HI> at <HI>Maccaness.</HI></L>
<L>The Learned <HI>Mob</HI> bought Compasses and Scales,</L>
<L>And every Barber knew the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Cales,</HI></L>
<L>Show'd us the Army here, and there the Fleet,</L>
<L>Here the Troops Land, and there the Foes Retreat.</L>
<L>There at St. <HI>Maries</HI> how the Spaniard runs,</L>
<L>and listen close as if they heard the Guns,</L>
<L>And some pretend they see them—the Nuns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>Others describe the Castle and <HI>Puntalls,</HI></L>
<L>And tell how easie 'tis to Conquer <HI>Cales</HI>;</L>
<L>Wisely propose to let the Silver come,</L>
<L>And help to Pay the Nation's Debts at Home.</L>
<L>But still they count the Spoils without the Cost,</L>
<L>And still the News came faster than the Post.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The graver Heads, like Mountebanks of State,</L>
<L>Of Abdication and Revolts Debate,</L>
<L>Expect a Revolution should appear</L>
<L>As Cheap and Easie as it had done here.</L>
<L>Bring the revolting <HI>Grandees</HI> to the Coast,</L>
<L>And give the Duke <HI>D' Anjou</HI> up for Lost.</L>
<L>Doom him to <HI>France</HI> to seek Relief in vain,</L>
<L>And send the Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> to <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
<L>Canvas the Council at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and find</L>
<L>How all the Spanish Courtiers stand enclin'd.</L>
<L>Describe the strange Convulsions of the State,</L>
<L>And Old <HI>Carreroe</HI>'s Sacrific'd to Fate.</L>
<L>Then all the Stage of Action they Survey,</L>
<L>And wish our Generals knew as much as they.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some have their Fancies so exceeding Bold,</L>
<L>They saw the Queens fall out, and heard 'em Scold:</L>
<L>Nor is the thing so strange, for if they did,</L>
<L>'Twas Talking from <HI>Toledo</HI> to <HI>Madrid.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Farce is acting o'er again,</L>
<L>The meaning of our Mischiefs to Explain.</L>
<L>The Learned <HI>Mob c'er-read</HI> in Arms and Law,</L>
<L>The Cause of their Miscarriages foresaw.</L>
<L>Tell us the Loitering Minutes were mis-spent,</L>
<L>Too long a going, and too few that went.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>Exalt the Catalonian Garrison,</L>
<L>The New made Works, the Platform, and the <HI>Town.</HI></L>
<L>Tell us it was Impossible to Land,</L>
<L>And all their Batteries sunk into the Sand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some are all Banter, and the Voyage Despise;</L>
<L>For fruitless Actions seldom pass for Wise.</L>
<L>Tell us 'twas like our <HI>English</HI> Politicks,</L>
<L>To think to wheedle <HI>Spain</HI> with <HI>Hereticks.</HI></L>
<L>The disproportion'd Force they Banter too;</L>
<L>The Ships too many, and the Men too few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then they find fault with Conduct, and condemn</L>
<L>Sometimes the Officers, sometimes the Men:</L>
<L>Nor scapes his Grace the <HI>Satyr</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI>;</L>
<L>Whoever fails Success, shall fail Renown.</L>
<L>Sir <HI>George</HI> comes in among the Indiscreet;</L>
<L>Sometimes the Armies censur'd, then the Fleet;</L>
<L>How the abandon'd <HI>Country</HI> they destroy'd,</L>
<L>And made their early Declarations void;</L>
<L>Too hasty Proofs of their Protection gave,</L>
<L>Plundering the People they came there to Save.</L>
<L>As if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so plagu'd with <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>To fly to Thieves for their Deliverance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But amongst all the Wisdom of the <HI>Town,</HI></L>
<L>The vast Designs of Fate remains unknown,</L>
<L>Unguest at, unexpected, hid from Thoughts,</L>
<L>For no Man look'd for Blessings in our Faults.</L>
<L>Mischances sometimes are a Nation's Good,</L>
<L>Rightly Improv'd, and Nicely Understood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ten Years we felt the Dying Pangs of War,</L>
<L>And fetch'd our Grief and Miseries from far.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Our <HI>English</HI> Millions Foreign War maintains,</L>
<L>And <HI>English</HI> Blood has Drencht the Neighbouring Plains.</L>
<L>Nor shall we Blush to Boast what all Men own,</L>
<L>Uncommon <HI>English</HI> Valour has been shown;</L>
<L>The forward Courage of our <HI>Ill Paid Men,</HI></L>
<L>Deserves more Praise than Nature spares my Pen.</L>
<L>What cou'd they not Perform, or what Endure?</L>
<L>Witness the Mighty Bastions of <HI>Namure.</HI></L>
<L>We fasted much, and we attempted more,</L>
<L>But ne'er cou'd come to giving Thanks before,</L>
<L>Unless 'twas when the Fatal Strife was o're.</L>
<L>Some secret <HI>Achan</HI> Curst our Enterprize,</L>
<L>And <HI>Israel</HI> fled before her Enemies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether the Poisonous Particles were hid</L>
<L>In Us that Follow'd, <HI>or in Them that Led:</HI></L>
<L>What Fatal Charm benumb'd the Nations Sense,</L>
<L>To struggle with Eternal Providence:</L>
<L>Whether some Curse, or else some <HI>Perjur'd Vow,</HI></L>
<L>Or some strange Guilt that's expiated now:</L>
<L>Was it the <HI>Pilots</HI> who ill steer'd the State;</L>
<L>Or was it the Decisive Will of Fate;</L>
<L>'Tis hard to tell; but this too well we know,</L>
<L>All things went backward, or went on too slow;</L>
<L>Small was the Glory of our High Success,</L>
<L>A Tedious War, and an Imperfect Peace;</L>
<L>Peace Dearly purchas'd, and which Cost us more</L>
<L>Great Kingdoms than we Conquer'd Towns before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Actions may miss of their deserv'd Applause,</L>
<L>When Heaven approves the Men, and not the Cause;</L>
<L>And well contriv'd Designs miscarry when</L>
<L>Heaven may approve the Cause, but not the Men;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Here then's the Ground of our Expence of Blood,</L>
<L>The Sword of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s, not the Sword of <HI>God.</HI></L>
<L>The Mighty and the Wise are laid aside,</L>
<L>And Victory <HI>the Sex</HI> has Dignified;</L>
<L>We have bin us'd to <HI>Female Conquests</HI> here,</L>
<L>And <HI>Queens</HI> have bin the Glory of the War,</L>
<L>The Scene Revives with Smiles of Providence,</L>
<L>All things Declin'd before, and Prosper since;</L>
<L>And as if ill Success had been Entail'd,</L>
<L>The Posthume Projects are the last that fail'd;</L>
<L>As Heaven, whose Works are hid from Humane View,</L>
<L>Would blast our Old Designs, and bless our New.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Baffl'd Enterprize grows stale,</L>
<L>Their Hopes decrease, and juster Doubts prevail:</L>
<L>The Unattempted <HI>Town</HI> Sings Victory,</L>
<L>And scar'd with Walls, and not with Men, we Fly;</L>
<L>Great Conduct in our safe Retreat we shew,</L>
<L>And bravely Re-imbark when none Pursue;</L>
<L>The Guns, the Ammunitions, put on Board,</L>
<L>And what we could not Plunder, we Restor'd.</L>
<L>And thus we Quit the <HI>Andalusion</HI> Shores,</L>
<L>Drencht with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and <HI>Spanish</HI> W—s.</L>
<L>With Songs of Scorn the <HI>Arragonians</HI> Sing,</L>
<L>And loud <HI>Te Deum</HI> make the Valleys Ring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Uncommon Joys now raise the Hopes of <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Vigo</HI> does their Plate-Fleet Entertain;</L>
<L>The vast Galeons Deep-Balasted with Ore,</L>
<L>Safely reach Home to the <HI>Galitian</HI> Shore.</L>
<L>The Double Joy spreads from <HI>Madrid</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> Fled, the Silver Fleet's come Home:</L>
<L>From thence it reaches to the Banks of <HI>Po,</HI></L>
<L>And the Loud Cannons let the <HI>Germans</HI> know.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>The ratling Volleys tell their Short-liv'd Joys,</L>
<L>And roar <HI>Te Deum</HI> out in Smoak and Noise.</L>
<L>To <HI>Milan</HI> next it flies on Wings of Fame,</L>
<L>There the Young Monarch and his Heroes came,</L>
<L>From sad <HI>Luzara,</HI> and the <HI>Mantuan</HI> Walls,</L>
<L>To seek New Dangers, and to rescue <HI>Cales.</HI></L>
<L>His Joy for Welcome Treasure he exprest,</L>
<L>But grieves at his good Fortune in the rest:</L>
<L>The Flying <HI>English</HI> he had wisht to stay,</L>
<L>To Crown with Conquest One Victorious Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Priest, in high Procession shew their Joy,</L>
<L>And all the Arts of Eloquence Employ,</L>
<L>To feed his Pride of fancy'd Victories,</L>
<L>And raise his untry'd Valour to the Skies.</L>
<L>The flattering <HI>Courtiers</HI> his vain Mind possess</L>
<L>With Airy Hopes of Conquest and Success.</L>
<L>Prompt his young Thoughts to run on new Extreams,</L>
<L>And Sycophantick Pride his Heart Enflames;</L>
<L>His <HI>Native Crime</HI> springs up, his Pulse beats high,</L>
<L>With Thoughts of Universal Monarchy;</L>
<L>Fancies his Foreign Enemies supprest,</L>
<L>And Boasts too soon how he'll subdue the rest.</L>
<L>Princes, like other Men, are blind to Fate,</L>
<L>He only sees the Event who does the Cause create.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence through <HI>France</HI> the Welcome Tydings fly,</L>
<L>To mock his Ancient Sire with Mushroom Joy.</L>
<L>Raptures possess the Ambitious Heads of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>And Golden Hopes their new Designs advance.</L>
<L>Now they Consult to Crush the World agen,</L>
<L>And talk of rifling <HI>Christendom</HI> for Men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>New Fleets, new Armies, and new Leagues contrive,</L>
<L>And swallow Men and Nations up alive;</L>
<L>Prescribe no Bounds to their Ambitious Pride,</L>
<L>But first the Wealth, and then the World, Divide.</L>
<L>Excess of Pride to Airy Madness grows,</L>
<L>And makes Men strange Romantick things propose:</L>
<L>The Head turns round, and all the Fancy's vain,</L>
<L>And makes the World as Giddy as the Brain.</L>
<L>Men that Consult such Weighty Things as those,</L>
<L>All Possible Disasters should suppose:</L>
<L>In vain great <HI>Princes</HI> mighty things Invent,</L>
<L>While Heaven retains the Power to prevent:</L>
<L>He that to General Mischief makes Pretence,</L>
<L>Should first know how to conquer Providence.</L>
<L>Such strive in vain, and only shew Mankind,</L>
<L>How Tyrants cloath'd with Power are all enclin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while our melancholy Fleet steers Home,</L>
<L>Some griev'd for past, for future Mischiefs some:</L>
<L>Disaster swells the Blood, and Spleen the Face,</L>
<L>And ripens them for glorious Things apace.</L>
<L>With deep Regret they turn their Eyes to <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>And wish they once might Visit them again.</L>
<L>Little they dreamt that Good which Heaven prepar'd;</L>
<L>No Merit from below, no Signs from Heaven appear'd;</L>
<L>No Hints, unless from their high-ripen'd Spleen,</L>
<L>And strange ungrounded Sympathy within.</L>

<L>The silent Duke, from all Misconduct Free,</L>
<L>Alone enjoys <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Calm of Honesty:</L>
<L>Fear not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should be fairly shown,</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>His Constant Temper's all serene and Clear;</L>
<L>First free from Guilt, and therefore free from Fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so the rest, for conscious Thoughts become</L>
<L>More restless now the nearer they come Home.</L>
<L>The Party-making Feuds on Board begin:</L>
<L>For People always Quarrel when they Sin.</L>
<L>Reflect with Shame upon the things mis-done,</L>
<L>And shift their Faults about from One to One,</L>
<L>Prepare Excuses, and compute their Friends,</L>
<L>And dread the Fate which their Desert attends.</L>
<L>Some wish for Storms, and curse the Wind and Sails,</L>
<L>And Dream, no doubt, of Gibbets, and of Jayls;</L>
<L>Imaginary Punishments appear,</L>
<L>And suited to their secret Guilts, their Fear,</L>
<L>Their hast'ning Fate in their own Fancies Read,</L>
<L>And few, 'tis fear'd, their Innocence can plead.</L>
<L>Then their sweet Spoils to trusty Hands convey,</L>
<L>And throw the <HI>rifl'd Gods of Spain</HI> away:</L>
<L>Disgorge that Wealth they dare not entertain,</L>
<L>And wish the Nuns <HI>their Maiden-Heads again.</HI></L>
<L>Dismiss their Wealth for fear of Witnesses,</L>
<L>And purge their Coffers and their Consciences,</L>
<L>Cursing their <HI>Ill-got Trifles,</HI> but in vain,</L>
<L>For still the Guilt, and still the Fears, remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell us ye Rabbies of abstruser Sense,</L>
<L>Who jumble Fate and Fools with Providence;</L>
<L>Is this the chosen Army, this the Fleet,</L>
<L>For which Heaven's Praises sound in every Street?</L>
<L>Cou'd Heaven provide them one Occasion more,</L>
<L>Who had so Ill discharg'd themselves before?</L>
<L>That Fleet so many former Millions Lost,</L>
<L>So little had Perform'd, so much had Cost:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>That Fleet so often Mann'd with Knaves before,</L>
<L>That serv'd us all the War to make us Poor;</L>
<L>That Twice had made their fruitless Voyage to <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>And saw the <HI>Streights,</HI> and <HI>so came Home again:</HI></L>
<L>Our <HI>Wooden Walls</HI> that should Defend our Trade,</L>
<L>And many a Witless <HI>Wooden</HI> Voyage ha' made;</L>
<L>How oft have they been fitted out in Vain,</L>
<L>Wasted our Money, and destroy'd our Men,</L>
<L>Betray'd our Merchants, and expos'd their Fleets,</L>
<L>And caus'd Eternal Murmurs in our Streets?</L>

<L>The more they wonder, and the more he flies.</L>

<L>For Joy and Hope have swifter Wings than Fear.</L>
<L>With what Surprize of Joy they meet the News!</L>
<L>Joys, that to every Vein new Spirits infuse.</L>

<L>For Joys and Griefs are all irregular.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Councils of War for sake of Forms they call,</L>

<L>Let <HI>France</HI> sing Praise for Shams of Victories,</L>
<L>And Mock their Maker with Religious Lies:</L>
<L>But <HI>England</HI> blest with thankful Hearts shall raise,</L>
<L>For mighty Conquests, mighty Songs of Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She needs no false Pretences to Deceive:</L>
<L>What all Men see, all Men must needs believe.</L>
<L>Our Joy can hardly run into Excess,</L>
<L>The well known Subject all our Foes confess:</L>
<L>We can't desire more, they can't pretend to less.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>ANNE,</HI> like her Great Progenitor, sings Praise:</L>
<L>Like her she Conquers, and like her she Prays;</L>
<L>Like her she Graces and Protects the Throne,</L>
<L>And counts the Lands Prosperity her own:</L>
<L>Like her, <HI>and long like her,</HI> be Bless'd her Reign,</L>
<L>Crown'd with new Conquests, and more Fleets from <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See now the Royal Chariot comes amain,</L>
<L>With all the willing Nation in her Train,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>With humble Glory, and with solemn Grace,</L>
<L>Queen in her Eyes, and Christian in her Face.</L>
<L><HI>With Her,</HI> Her represented Subjects join;</L>
<L>And when She Prays, th' whole Nation says, <HI>Amen.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Her, in Stalls the Illustrious Nobles sat,</L>
<L>The Cherubims and Seraphims of State:</L>
<L><HI>ANNE</HI> like a Cornet in the Center shone,</L>
<L>And they like Stars that circumfere the Sun.</L>
<L>She Great in them, and they as Great in Her;</L>
<L>Sure Heaven will such Illustrious Praises hear.</L>
<L>The crouding Millions Hearty Blessings pour:</L>
<L><HI>Saint</HI> Paul <HI>ne'er saw but one such Day before.</HI></L>
