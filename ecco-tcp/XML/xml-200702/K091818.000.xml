<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you will be so just unto me, as not to think I gave over writing unto you during the sit∣ting of the Parliament, because I did not in a good while receive an an∣swer unto my first letter. I seldom stand upon such ceremonies, and ne∣ver with those who have obliged me, as you have done. The truth is, some of your friends, and mine, were so entangled in business then upon the
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>
stage, that I could say nothing to the purpose, without mentioning them; and the parts they had taken upon themselves, were such as I was unwil∣ling to relate. The result of all this is, that the Lord Sunderland is out of his place and the Council: The Lord Conway succeeds him, and hath the Seals. Essex is also put out of the Council and Lieutenancy of Hartford∣shire, upon presenting a Petition from the Lords. Godolphin hoped to have had the Honour of accompanying them in their disgrace; but Temple only hath it. The Council being hereby weakened, is reinforced by the admis∣sion of the Earls of Oxford, Chester∣field and Aylesbury; and it is hoped that, to render it compleat, the Lords Berkeley, Craven and Arundel of Tre∣rice,
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
shall be called. The Lord Hal∣lifax is gone to ruminate upon these matters at Rufford, and says he will not return southward, until the Par∣liament meet at Oxford. The fruits expected from the last Parliament hav∣ing been lost by little underhand bar∣gains, and, as some say, the King and Parliament equally betrayed by those that were trusted by them, men's minds seem to be filled with various conceits, and many jealousies. Some think, the Writs for calling the Parliament are in themselves void, as being without advice of Council; and that the Law takes notice of nothing done by the King, <HI>sine sapientum &amp; magnatum consilio:</HI> Or that if it should meet at Oxford, its Acts would be void, or sub∣ject to be vacated for want of the free∣dom
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
of voting, which is essential unto it. Others say, the validity of the Writs depends solely upon the <HI>person</HI> of the King, and that others ought to think themselves safe, where he is safe, though their danger be from him. I know not what this will produce, but I never saw men's minds more heated than at present; and cannot think that portends less evil than the <HI>Comet.</HI> People are every where busy in choos∣ing Parliament Men of their own Prin∣ciples, and they will probably be like unto the last; but it is thought, many Officers will be prevailed with to make <HI>false returns.</HI> I hear of no Election passed, but that of <HI>Amersham:</HI> Of those who by the last Parliament were there judged capable of giving their voices, Sir Robert Hill had forty; Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
Sydney seven and thirty; Sir Joseph Drake twenty eight; Mr. Cheyney twenty nine; but the Constables have been pleased to return the two latter. To-morrow is appointed for the Elec∣tion of the <HI>City-Members,</HI> who, people believe, will be the same as formerly. Some think his Royal Highness hath business enough to employ his thoughts: Others say he is at such perfect leisure, that the Maid of Honour, who accom∣panied him, cannot employ all his spare time; and for that reason, or to give her time to lay aside something that troubled her, he applys himself to a young Gentlewoman, who with much respect, and gratitude, receives the honour he is pleased to do her; but she hath an old crabbed Husband, who doth not take that for a just recom∣pence
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
of the great respect he hath shewed unto his Royal Highness, and is not like to learn better manners from his Presbyterian Bretheren.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what is said, we good Subjects hope all will go perfect∣ly well. His Majesty, as is said, re∣solves so to reform his Court, that all shall be of one Mind. Mr. Seymour being now looked upon as the greatest man, brings his two friends Conway and Ranelagh into the management of business; and the first of these be∣ing as eminent for finesse of Wit, quickness and easiness in state affairs, as the other in the excellency of all moral Virtues, things cannot but go well; and we particularly hope that England will keep up its reputation
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
of being, as the Cardinal Pallavicini says, the <HI>Mother</HI> and <HI>Nurse of the best Wits in the World,</HI> when all foreign Ministers shall come to treat with Jen∣kins and Conway, who will be taken for patterns of the Genius of the Na∣tion, and not thought the only men it produceth, that deserve the highest praises; and lest any thing should be wanting, Mr. Hide is joined unto these. It is true that we have not of our Na¦tion, a man to put at the head of the Soldiers, as admirable in military skill, and virtues, as those above-mentioned are in civils and morals: But the knowledge of our own defects, the sa∣gacity of discovering in the Earl of Feversham the qualities which we have not, and the prudent humility of sub∣mitting unto him that is blessed with
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
them, though a stranger, deserves some commendations: And I am confident, that when things shall be brought into such order, that a Papist may appear open-faced, we shall shew as great re∣spect unto the Lord Dunbarton. France and Germany, that are full of their Trophies, cannot but admire this, whilst we rest secure under their shadow. Fit men may more easily be found for less eminent Places; and the Earl of Thanet, as is said, shall succeed Mr. Russell in the Command of the Foot Guards. Civil and military affairs being thus settled, Treasures flowing in unto us on all sides, and all Foreign Princes, concerned in our affairs, be∣ing sure unto us; we need not fear a few <HI>discontented Lords,</HI> a <HI>mutinous Ci∣ty,</HI> or <HI>murmuring Counties;</HI> and
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
presuming that the vast magazines of arms made at Brest, and some that with a good quantity of ammunition, were lately sent into Ireland, are in pur∣suance of agreements made with you, we cannot but think all will tend to our good.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you will excuse the trou∣ble I give you, in enclosing this, and desire you to send it forward into Gascoiney. It is a climate where I cannot be suspected of sending any thing of a dangerous nature; but we have so many at the Post-House, in∣fected with the most impertinent folly, that a Pacquet though directed thither can hardly pass unvisited, unless the Person to whom it is directed do pro∣tect it.</P>
<P>The last Resolutions of the City, have been as pleasing to the Countie
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
as distastful to the Court. Yesterday the Company of Artillery intended to have chosen Prince Rupert to be their Captain, and Sir Thomas Player their Leader; but a letter was produced from the King, rather desiring than com∣manding that no new Officers should be chosen; and they having no Constitu∣tion beyond an Act of King and Coun∣cil, depending upon his Majesty's Will, did unwillingly obey.</P>
<P>Parliament-Men are for the most part chosen by the Parties most contra∣ry to the Court, and many believe this next House of Commons will not be at all more pliable than the last. Sir Wil∣liam Waller and Poultney were this day chosen at Westminster without any opposition. Col. Titus and Sir Tho∣mas
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
Proby were with the same facility chosen Knights of Huntingtonshire; Hambden the elder, and Wharton, of Buckinghamshire; with a multitude of others.</P>
<P>The Lady Portsmouth is said to have entirely recovered her lost favour. The Earl of Sunderland is at his House in Queen-Street. The Lady Hallifax, on Tuesday, followed her Lord to Ruf∣ford.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING conscious unto my self, that what I could say of busi∣nesses now upon the Stage would be of little use unto you, I thought it fit∣ter for me to be one of the last in writing to you, than to take place ac∣cording to my desire of serving you, which would suffer me to yield to none; but lest this acknowledgment should be taken for a pretence to cover laziness, I will here give you such a sight of things▪ as I have; and intend to continue to do the like as often as I can without troubling you. You will
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
have heard from all hands, what tem∣per the House of Commons appears to be of, and that the Earl of Danby hath accomplished his promise of bringing it into an entire subjection unto the King's Will, as well as the other two points, of paying his Majesty's Debts, encreasing his Treasure, and rendering him considerable amongst his Neigh∣bouring Princes; which are verified in leaving twenty two Shillings and ten pence in the Exchequer, two and forty hundred thousand Pounds of passive debts, and the revenue anticipated for almost a Year and half, and the account his Lordship was pleased to give in his speech to the Peers, of the esteem the King of France had for his person and government. Notwithstanding all this, he is so far considered at Court, that
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
his concernments are a general ob∣struction to all businesses. The Lord Berckely, Frécheville, and others of the learned, think he hath behaved himself so well, as to deserve no punish∣ment, and therefore opposed the Com∣mitment of the Bill of Attainder, that it might be cast out: Shaftsbury, Es∣sex and Halifax differing something in opinion from them, in compliance unto the King's desires, did, as an amend∣ment, wipe out the word <HI>Attainder,</HI> and made it almost the same with that which their Lordships had formerly sent up to banish him, and declaring him attainted only if he came into England after the first of May next: The consideration of which business, is likely this day to possess the House of Commons, and if their mind be
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>
known before this letter be sealed, it shall be inserted.</P>
<P>The next important point likely to be pursued is, to prosecute the last week's Vote, that <HI>all the Forces now on foot in</HI> England, <HI>except the trained Bands, were kept up contrary to Law;</HI> and though it was objected that the King's Guards, and the Garrisons of Portsmouth and other places would be included; it was answered, that <HI>Kings governing justly according to</HI> Law, <HI>had no need of</HI> Custodia Corporis; and that it was better to have no Garrisons at all, than such as were commanded by Leg, Holmes, and their Peers.</P>
<P>The controversy concerning the E∣lection at Grinstead, was determined
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
at the Committee in favour of Mr. Pow∣ell, chosen by the Commons, and Tho∣mas Pelham, by the major part of the Corporation, no complaint being made against him. Powell choosing to stand as he is chosen for Ciciter, the dispute upon the new Election is like to be be∣tween Skrog and Sir Thomas Littleton, who is like to have the assistance of the Dorset Family, the Pelhams, and some others. On Friday last, the same Committee voted the Right of Election at Windsor to be in the Commons; and that <HI>Ernely</HI> and his Companion hav∣ing been unduly chosen by the Cor∣poration, a new Election should be made; but the House approving of the first part only, annulled the Election of Ernely and the other, and approved that of Winhood and Storkey.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="20"/>
All <HI>Foreign Affairs</HI> are at a stand, only Van Beuninghen takes great pains to make people believe the King of France intends to add England unto his other Conquests, and disabuse such as were so foolish as to believe there was any thing of truth in the reports of those that had spoken of the Popish Plot; and finding me infected with the same opinion, with some of my Friends, he was pleased to spend two hours the other day in the Park to con∣vince me of my error, in which he did succeed as well as he used to do in his great designs.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> certainly inclines not to be so stiff as formerly in advancing on∣ly those that exalt <HI>Prerogative;</HI> but the Earl of Essex, and some others that
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>
are coming into play thereupon, can∣not avoid being suspected of having in∣tentions different from what they have hitherto professed.</P>
<P>The Earl of Ormond's miscarriages are so extreme, and his favour to the Irish so apparent, that few believe he can continue in the Government of Ire∣land. Some speak of three Justices and a good Commander of the Army, whol∣ly fixed upon an English Interest; but if a Lieutenant be sent, I believe it will be Essex or Halifax.</P>
<P>That you may see the good humour we are in, I here enclosed send you, a piece of Poetry given unto me by a Friend of yours; and if you have not seen another, which is the Speech of
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Writ by Andrew Marvel.</NOTE> <HI>Hodge</HI> the <HI>Clown</HI> from the top of the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> I will endeavour to send it unto you.</P>
<P>The House of Commons have this day presented unto the Lords, the Ar∣ticles drawn against the five Lords in the Tower. I also hear just now, that they do adhere to the Bill of Attainder of the Earl of Danby, and will no ways admit of the Lords amendments of it. One <HI>Reading,</HI> a Lawyer, not long since offered four thousand pounds, and three hundred pounds a year in Land to <HI>Bedloe,</HI> if he would disavow the testimony he had given against the Lords of Powys, Bellassys and Peters; which being communicated unto Prince
<PB N="27" REF="23"/>
Robert, and Earl of Essex, he brought Reading by their advice into a place, where two Witnesses heard him; whereupon Reading was apprehended, and he having found means whilst he was in the Serjeant's hands to send a Letter to his Wife, to be delivered to Mr. Chyvins, (desiring to be admitted to the King's Presence, promising to tell great matters) his Majesty refers him wholly to the House of Commons, and offers to issue out a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for his Trial, which will be very speedy, if he save not himself by discoveries: This Morning a Letter was intercepted written to him by his Wife, where∣in she tells him, that every body says he is a Rogue, and if he doth
<PB N="28" REF="24"/>
not confess all, he will be hanged, and she together with her Children ruined.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are so much afore-hand in obliging me, when I most want∣ed a friend, that I cannot hope in a long time to pay my debt, though I were in a place that gave me more advantages, than any I can ever rea∣sonably expect; but you may ever be sure of all that is within my reach. I write now in some haste, but am un∣willing this Post should go without a Letter from me. I presume you know that the Earl of Danby rendered him∣self to the Black Rod, on Wednesday last; and that desiring of the Lords at
<PB N="30" REF="26"/>
the Bar, that for his health he might be suffer'd to continue under his Cus∣tody: That he might have recourse, as often as occasion should require, to all State Papers, that were necessary to him in making his defence: That he might at once have a Copy of all his Charge, and be obliged not to answer to any part, until the whole were be∣fore him: And that he might have Serjeant Weston, Serjeant Raymond, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Holt assigned un∣to him for Counsel. He received no other answer, than that if he told what Papers he desired, the House would do as was usual in those cases: That the House of Commons could not be abridged of the liberty retained to it∣self, of bringing in additional charges, if it were thought fit: That he might
<PB N="31" REF="27"/>
have for his Counsel, such of those he had named as were not of the King's: And that he must be committed to the Tower, where Cheeke received him. Subtle men find great mysteries in his rendering himself, and make the King to be of the Plot; but those that see no farther than I, believe he hath had in this, and all his businesses of late, no other Counsel than his Lady.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be surpriz'd to hear, that yesterday the King did en∣tirely dissolve his Old Privy Council, and chose a new one, consisting of fifteen Officers of the Crown, ten Lords, and five Commoners; his Ma∣jesty retaining unto himself the liberty of naming a President, calling such Princes of the Blood, as should be
<PB N="32" REF="28"/>
from time to time; and the Secretary of Scotland for the time being, if he thought fit; declaring moreover, that whensoever any Place should be va∣cant, he would name none without the advice of the Council; and that the Person named should be called by a Letter subscribed by them all. To which he was pleased to add, That he would have no <HI>first</HI> or <HI>principal Mi∣nister,</HI> no Committee of Foreign af∣fairs, or Cabinet Council; but that in all things he would follow and rely upon their advice, next unto that of his Great Council, the Parliament, which was also specified in the letter sent by his Majesty for the calling of every one of them, who are now to serve in Council. The Officers, who by their places are to be of the Coun∣cil
<PB N="33" REF="29" MS="y"/>
(as I remember) are the Chan∣cellor, Chief Justice, Privy Seal, Or∣mond Steward, Arlington Chamber∣lain, Sussex, as first Commissioner of the Treasury, Sir Henry Capell as first Commissioner of the Admiralty, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bi∣shop of London, the two Secretaries, and some others that I have for∣got; but Newport and Mainard are none. The Lords are, the Dukes of Newcastle and Albemarle, the Marquesses of Winchester and Wor∣cester, Earls of Bridgewater and Salis∣bury, Viscounts Faulconbridge and Halifax, Barons Roberts and Hollys; Commoners are, the Lords Russel and Cavendish, Mr. Powell, Mr. Seymour, and (as I hear) Sir William Temple.
<PB N="34" REF="30" MS="y"/>
I hear also seven Commissioners nam'd for the Admiralty, Sir Henry Capell, Merres, Littleton, Vaughan, Mr. Da∣niel Finch, and two others, that I have forgotten. The Lord Shaftsbury is declared President of the Council. These were sworn this morning, and that Ceremony being performed, the King went to the house of Lords, and sent for the house of Commons, to whom he did impart all that had passed; and all that I have yet spok∣en with, seem much pleased; though it might have been wished, that some of those that are chosen had been left out. A friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marquess of Halifax, Earls of Sunderland and Essex. See Letter of May the 12th, p.</NOTE>of yours and mine is, as far as I understand, the author of all this; and if he and two more can
<PB N="35" REF="31"/>
well agree amongst themselves, I be∣lieve they will have the management of almost all businesses, and may bring much honour to themselves, and good to our nation.</P>
<P>I find men's hearts much set upon taking the Government of Ireland out of the Earl of Ormond's hands. If a Lieutenant be named, I believe it will be Essex or Halifax; and, if neither of them, three Justices.</P>
<P>Others design Halifax successor to his unkle Coventry. You will perhaps wonder, not to hear his brother Wil∣liam mentioned; but as yet there is no occasion for it.</P>
<P>We have every day foolish alarms
<PB N="36" REF="32"/>
from the French Fleet, and I find no body but the Lord Sunderland and myself that believe not one word of it. Morgan, Governor of Jersey, is dead, and Laheer appointed to succeed him. That our affairs may be managed by as able a man abroad as that island is defended by, Sir H. Goodrike expects in a few days to be dispatched for Spain. We do not yet see what effect the death of the King of Sweden will have as to the peace of Europe. I received the good piece of Poetry, that I sent you, from the Lord Hali∣fax. You should have <HI>Hodge's Speech</HI> by this Post, but it is very long, and I must write it in my own hand, which obligeth me to stay until the next week. The house of Commons hath been all this day upon Sir John

<P>ON this day was a se'nnight, I writ unto you what I had heard of the passages of the foregoing week; and though I make no doubt, but you have many that give you far better ac∣counts of what is done than I am able to do, I will not make that an excuse for silence, lest others should alledge the same, and covering true laziness with fained modesty, leave you in the dark, as my friends did me when I was abroad.</P>
<P>The five Popish Lords in the Tow∣er, had at the first given in cavilling
<PB N="39" REF="35"/>
uncertain answers; but Bellassys and Peters on Thursday, and Powys, Staf∣ford and Arundell on Saturday, with∣out any ambiguity, pleaded <HI>not guilty,</HI> and declared they put themselves upon the Lords Justice.</P>
<P>The Earl of Danby hath not thought fit, as yet, to deal so clearly, but hath put in a huge long answer, containing great protestations of his own Inno∣cence, as to every part of his charge; and then pleads his pardon, which enu∣merates and acquits him of all the crimes, that it is almost possible for a man to commit. This is by some thought very strange; his Innocence that he protests, declaring that he had no need of Pardon, and the Pardon pleaded in effect acknowledging the
<PB N="40" REF="36"/>
truth of his Charge; it being useless if he be not guilty. Hereupon other questions do arise, as whether the King can pardon? Whether if he have this power, he hath rightly executed it, the formalities not having been observed? And lastly, whether he will insist upon this answer, which will not leave him any plea at all, if the pardon be judg∣ed defective? I dare give no opinion upon these points, but I hear the learn∣ed say, <HI>the</HI> King <HI>cannot pardon a man impeached by Parliament upon a pub∣lick account:</HI> That though he could, this would be of no value, being de∣fective in all the formalities: And though perhaps the Court may be pre∣valent enough in the house of Lords, to have it admitted; that would be of evil consequence, no man doubting but
<PB N="41" REF="37"/>
the house of Commons will extremely dislike such a Judgment, and grow very refractory thereupon; and the whole Nation would follow them in it, so as all business would be thereby ob∣structed; by which means the King, upon the personal account of the Earl of Danby, would lose the advantage of all that hath been done of late to please the Nation; which I leave to your Judgment, that know the Court much better than I do. This point I only find to be clear, that if the Pardon can be found good, though the formalities are wanting, it will be made good; and the burthen left upon the Chancel∣lor, that put the great Seal unto it, without taking care of seeing them ob∣served.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="38"/>
Some Judges were yesterday put out; Wild for inability of body, and Barton and Thurland of mind, with some others; to whom old Ellys, Ray∣mond and Pemmerton, Leake and At∣kins the younger are to succeed. The house of Lords is busy upon one Bill concerning Popery, and the house of Commons upon another, both inclin∣ing to find a way of distinguishing Pro∣testants only from Papists, but cannot yet resolve upon it, so as to include the several dissenting Sects; that Papists may not be sheltered, and receive the indulgence (which is not intended them) under other Names; and this difficulty is chiefly occasioned by the Quakers, who, for more than one rea∣son, are thought least to deserve much to be cared for. Shaftsbury and Ha∣lifax
<PB N="43" REF="39"/>
are eminent in pleading for in∣dulgence to tender-conscienced Pro∣testants, and severity against Papists: The first of these said the other day, <Q>he neither could live <HI>with</HI> or <HI>under</HI> a <HI>Papist.</HI></Q> On Saturday it was re∣ported to the house of Commons, that the Lord Cottington, who died many years ago in Spain, had appointed an Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb, expressing his desire, that his body might rest there until England were restored to the Church, and then car∣ried over: This it was the last year, and a Warrant was produced from the Earl of Danby to the Commissioners of the Customs to let it pass.</P>
<P>Yesterday was appointed extraordi∣nary by the house of Commons, to
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>
consider of the succession of the Crown in relation to Popery, upon the debate of which Secretary Coventry, amongst other things, is said to have reproach∣ed Birch, that his discourses savoured of the Years 1640 and 41, but that himself continued in the same mind he had ever been; and having taken the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King and his Successors, could not without Perjury fail of performing the contents of them to his Successor, what Religion soever he should hap∣pen to be of. Unto which Birch re∣plied, asserting his own services to the King; taxing Coventry of having broken his word to the Parliament twice the last year, in relation to a War promised to be declared and ac∣tually made upon France; disserved
<PB N="45" REF="41"/>
the King and Nation, in having been a principal cause of breaking the triple League; and concluded, he was as fit to be turn'd out of the Council as any one that had been so. Bennet not long before had said, that though this Council seemed in some degree to be reformed, no good could reason∣ably be expected, as long as one conti∣nued in it, who did by such violences and other undue ways advance Arbi∣trary Power in Scotland, and one that had masses daily said for him in Ire∣land: For the first of these he named Latherdale, and left the house in an opinion, that for the other he meant Anglesey. At the last it was conclud∣ed, that the King should be desired to give order for the execution of Picker∣ing and another condemned Priest;
<PB N="46" REF="42"/>
that a Proclamation should be issued to banish all Papists without any other exceptions than publick Ministers, and their followers, twenty miles out of London: The Lady Portsmouth was named, but not pursued: That the Duke of York being a Papist, the hopes of his succeeding unto the Crown had been the principal ground and founda∣tion of the Plot against the King's life and the Protestant Religion: That the secret Committee should, on Wed∣nesday next, bring into the House such Letters and Papers as they had in their hands relating unto the said Duke. The concurrence of the Lords is de∣sired, as to the Proclamation, and the first vote concerning the Duke; and the Lord Russell, notwithstanding his being a Privy Counsellor, appointed to
<PB N="47" REF="43"/>
carry up the Message. They also voted an address to be made to the King, that all Sea-ports, places of strength, and command of Ships may be put into trusty hands, and concluded to refer the farther consideration of this busi∣ness to Wednesday next, and I believe it will be then debated, whether such an Association shall be entered into as was appointed in Queen Elizabeth's time; or an Act made, that this Par∣liament should not determine in such a time as should be limited, though the King should die, or in so many months after, or something to that purpose, which may tend to the King's security. I do not well know what the Houses have done this Morning, but hear the Message from the house of Commons is carried up to the Lords, and that
<PB N="48" REF="44"/>
they have appointed the Earl of Dan∣by to be at their Bar to-morrow morn∣ing. The Commons have also per∣fected their Bill for disbanding of the Army, by a Land-Tax of twenty thou∣sand pounds the month, subsequent to that which will expire in February next. Several Priests were taken the last night, of which two confess they were sent over by all means to endea∣vour to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's testimony. Reading was this morning in the Pillory, and is condemned to a year's imprisonment and 1000 pounds fine, for having endeavoured to cor∣rupt Bedloe. Stubbs, the Countess of Shrewsbury's Butler, confesseth he had been induced by three Priests, to gain as many Servants as he could, to set
<PB N="49" REF="45"/>
fire on their Masters houses; of which a wench was apprehended for firing her Master's in Fetter-Lane.</P>

<P>THOUGH the last week was spent rather in wrangling than the dispatch of any business of impor∣tance, I continue to give you an ac∣count of what I hear, because these irregular motions are often the fore∣runners of great matters; and as they denote the temper of a Nation, they give good grounds of guessing what they will end in. I do not send you the King and Chancellor's speeches, because I presume care was taken to send them to you by the last post; but perhaps others have not been so free in
<PB N="51" REF="47"/>
telling you the effect of it as I shall be. The Courtiers did believe, that the King's yielding that the Parlia∣ment should not end with his life, or be revived by his death, if it chanced to be dissolved in his life-time, and have the nomination of all Officers, both civil and military, if his Successor proved to be a Papist, would have given entire satisfaction unto the house of Commons. But to the contrary it is certain, that the supposition that the next in blood must be King, though a Papist, is so distastful to them, that no∣thing will please upon that odious con∣dition; and as to this particular, it is looked upon as a trick to bring the Parliament to confess and confirm the Duke's title, that is, a little gilding to cover a poisonous pill. This puts them
<PB N="52" REF="48"/>
upon various counsels; some would <HI>impeach</HI> him, upon what is discovered of his part in the Plot: Others incline more to bring in an Act, to <HI>exclude</HI> him from the succession of the Crown, as being a Papist, and thereby a friend unto and dependent upon, a foreign and enemy Power. Some of those that are of this mind, look <Q><HI>who is fittest to succeed,</HI> if this should be; and they are for the most part <HI>divided between</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> hath plainly the most <HI>plausible title,</HI> by his <HI>Mother</HI> and his Wife; but, be∣sides the opinion of the influence it is believed the Duke of York would have over him, it is feared that the <HI>Commonwealth-party</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> would be so frighted with that, as to
<PB N="53" REF="49"/>
cast itself absolutely into the hands of the <HI>King of France,</HI> who might thereby have a fair occasion of ruining both England and Holland.</Q> I need not tell you the reasons <HI>against</HI> Mon∣mouth; but the strongest I hear alledg∣ed <HI>for</HI> him, are, that whosoever is op∣posed to York, will have a good party, and all Scotland, which is every day like to be in arms, doth certainly fa∣vour him, <Q>and may probably be of as much importance in the troubles that are now likely to fall upon us, as they were in the beginning of the last.</Q> Others are only upon nega∣tives. But when I have said what I can upon this business, I must confess I do not know three men of a mind, and that a spirit of giddiness reigns amongst
<PB N="54" REF="50"/>
us, far beyond any I have ever observed in my life.</P>
<P>Nothing was done the last week con∣cerning the Popish Lords in the Tower. The Earl of Danby on Saturday last did insist upon his former plea and an∣swer, how little sense soever there be in it. some say it is, <HI>ex industria per∣plexa;</HI> and that having the Court and house of Lords to favour him, he cares not for the inconsistence of protesting his innocence, which renders his par∣don useless, and pleading his pardon, which is a confession of guilt; hoping that if the Commons do demur in Law upon the two points, (first, that the King cannot pardon a Delinquent im∣peached by one Commoner, much less by all the Commons in England;
<PB N="55" REF="51"/>
secondly, that though it were granted he might pardon, this pardon could not hold, because it wants all the for∣malities) the Lords would over-rule it, and then he is acquitted.</P>
<P>The Bill for the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was passed by the Lords on Friday last, and sent down to the Commons. The same day they also passed an Act for the ba∣nishing of the Papists out of London, and penned it so well by the industry of the Bishops, that if the Commons should pass it without amendment, all the Non-conformists of London would be driven out of town, and half the shops shut up. The Bill for disband∣ing the Army is passed the two Houses, and I presume will not stay long for the Royal assent. The Lords did as∣sent
<PB N="56" REF="52"/>
to the vote of the Commons, that the Duke being a Papist, had been the occasion of the Plot, but added the word, <HI>unwillingly.</HI> The whole busi∣ness formerly mentioned of the Earl of Danby his endeavour to suborn Bedloe to renounce his testimony, was the last week verified before a Committee of Lords, and Dumblain his man con∣fessed he had been employed to do it; so as his Lordship is found to have done just the same thing, for which <HI>Reading</HI> stood the last week in the pil∣lory. Some Scholars sent from St. O∣mer's were lately apprehended by Sir William Waller, and confess they are sent hither by the Jesuits, by any means to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's testi∣monies, but they rather confirm them. The Lord Ross having been put
<PB N="57" REF="53"/>
out of the house of Commons, is by Writ called to the house of Lords. Sir John Hartup, who petitioned against him, is, upon the invalidating of his Election, chosen by the Freeholders of the County, and took his place in the House on Friday. This day is ap∣pointed for the new Election in Nor∣folk, and it is thought Sir John Hub∣bert will have the same success.</P>
<P>Sir, I desire you to tell Monsieur de Ruvygny the younger, that upon his recommendation I did address the Duke de Gramont's <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to the places where all the best horses in England were to be had; but he has rid four hundred miles, and is returned with∣out liking any. To say the truth, he is such a proud ass, that he neither
<PB N="58" REF="54"/>
knows what is good, nor will believe any body else. I had directed him to see two, that are said to be as fine young horses of five years old as any are in England, which having never been trained were fat, and as he said, <HI>trop relever.</HI> Near Lincoln he saw two of the Lord Castletown's, which had the same faults. At the Lord Burlington's in Yorkshire he saw one, that is thought to be worth as much as any one in England, bred of an Arabian, six years old passed, never run but once at Kippling, and then won the Plate; and being now thin, and drawn for another course, he is to run within this week, this wise Gentleman took him for a Mazette: He did the like with some others in the same place and at the Marquess of
<PB N="59" REF="55"/>
Winchester's; upon all which I have no more to say to Mons. Ruvygny, than that he should find a way to re∣vive Bucephalus, or send a man that hath more wit than this, to take such as the world affords.</P>
<P>The horrible reports made from France of poisoning, affright reason∣able persons here, as much as the dis∣courses of the fleet at Brest do fools.</P>
<P>The house of Commons have voted, that the pardon pretended by the Earl of Danby was of no value, and went up to desire justice upon him of the house of Lords. We live in a time that no man, by what is passed, can well judge what is to be expected for the future; but I am much inclined
<PB N="60" REF="56"/>
to believe, that Danby having in this last act followed his own disposition, that ever delighted in juggling and in∣directness, will, by the tricks he hath played, have found a way to hang himself. It is said, that the King will be at the House to-morrow, in his Robes, to pass the act for dis∣banding the Army. This morning, Secretary Coventry not being well, the Lord Russel from the King declared unto the house of Commons, he ex∣pected no supply from them this ses∣sions, but desired care might be taken of the Navy.</P>

<P>I HAVE received your Letter of May 13, and continue my custom of giving you once a Week an account of what comes to my knowledge, though to discourage me I can only make the unpleasant relations of such disorders here, as in my opinion threaten us with the greatest mischiefs, that can befall a Nation. The three that I meant in my Letter, that you would have me explain, were the Earls of Sunderland, Essex, and Halifax, and I am still of the same mind, so far as the power of the Court goes.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="58"/>
The last week was spent for the most part in janglings between the two Houses, upon <HI>points of Privilege</HI> re∣lating unto the Rights the Lords pre∣tend unto in points of <HI>Judicatories;</HI> which the Lords Frecheville, Berckely, Ferrers, Aylesbury, Northampton, and some others equal unto them in under∣standing, eloquence and reputation, do with the help of the Bishops very magnanimously defend. Several pro∣posals have been made by the Com∣mons of conferring with them upon all the points in question, or appointing a Committee of both Houses, which, meeting together, might adjust all those that might be occasion of difference; but their Lordships disdaining to con∣fer upon points that as they did sup∣pose depended wholly upon their Will,
<PB N="63" REF="59"/>
on Friday last did vote that they would have no such Committee, which vote was carried only by two voices, the one side having 54, the other 52. Of eighteen Bishops that were present, six∣teen were on the victorious side, and only Durham and Carlisle were so humble as to join with the vanquished. Of those 52, one and fifty the next day protested, and I think only lazi∣ness hindered the Earl of Leicester, who was the other, not to protest, as well as the others with whom he had voted. On Saturday there was a con∣ference between the two Houses upon this business, and it appearing that all proceedings would stop thereupon, it being impossible for two to agree upon any thing, unless their thoughts and reasons are communicated, they were
<PB N="64" REF="60"/>
pleased yesterday to recede from that vote, and appointed a Committee of twelve Lords to confer with a double number of Commons thereupon.</P>
<P>The house of Commons have made an address unto his Majesty, desiring him to remove the Duke of Latherdale out of all employments in England and Ireland, and from his presence for ever; to which they received a dilatory an∣swer.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of St. Andrew's hath been lately murther'd in his coach three miles from St. Andrew's, by ten men, that there set upon him, of which two were taken by some horse that came suddenly to the place. It is not known who they are, nor
<PB N="65" REF="61"/>
who employed them; but Latherdale is graciously pleased to lay it upon the Nonconformists, and hath thereupon caused a very severe Proclamation to be issued out against them: But others believe it was upon a private quarrel with some Gentlemen, that by fraud and power the Prelate had thrown out of their estates, he having been most remarkable for outragious covetousness, besides other Episcopal qualities.</P>
<P>The house of Commons have for∣bidden all Commoners of England to be of Counsel to the Earl of Danby, under the pain of being esteemed be∣trayers of the rights of all the Com∣mons, by whom he is accused, unless leave be asked and given by them.
<PB N="66" REF="62"/>
The Bill for <HI>disbanding the Army</HI> is passed. On Saturday the King hav∣ing appointed sixteen small pieces of Ordnance to be sent to Portsmouth, notice was taken thereof in the house of Commons, and a great suspicion, that they being sent with field-car∣riages, harnesses for horses, and all ne∣cessaries belonging to the train of a marching Army, they might be in∣tended rather for such an use, than to furnish a Garrison as is pretended. At the same time reports were spread, that the Duke of York was returned into England, or hourly expected, and some believe his business is to hinder the dis∣banding of the Army, with such others as the knowledge of his nature, toge∣ther with the persons that command in Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, and
<PB N="67" REF="63"/>
some other places may suggest, in the most jealous time that I have ever liv∣ed in.</P>
<P>The house of Commons sate yester∣day, being Sunday, to hear such papers read, as the secret Committee thought fit to produce relating to the <HI>Duke of York,</HI> which had been found amongst the Cardinal of Norfolk's papers, and other places. They are many in num∣ber, which speak of his assenting unto and approving of the Plot in all points, but none directed to him, or written by him. Many various motions were made, but in the end it was ordered, that a Bill should be drawn up, to de∣bar him from the <HI>Succession of the Crown.</HI> Sir Francis Winnington and Mr. Vau∣ghan would have put off the debate,
<PB N="68" REF="64"/>
until the trial os Danby and the Popish Lords was over. Sir William Coven∣try, Sir Thomas Littleton, and others, spoke directly against the thing, but the major part by much was of the other opinion, so as on the division appointed upon the question, whether there should be Candles, the inequality was so great, that the pains of telling was spared, and when the main que∣stion was put, there was no division at all. Not to trouble you with many particulars, I will only recite one, which is, that a Gentleman moving the words should be put in, <Q>Or ever had been a Papist,</Q> they were laid aside, as some believe, in respect unto him, who by the direction of the late Lord Crofts, was brought up under the discipline of the Peres de l'Oratorie. The next work
<PB N="69" REF="65"/>
was to make an address to his Majesty, full of humility and loyalty, expressing their utmost resolution to serve him with their lives and fortunes in the pre∣servation of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>I hope the new method resolved up∣on here, in relation unto publick Mi∣nisters, will be of as little prejudice unto you where you are, as the report of the occasion which began with you will do you here.</P>

<P>I HAVE been abroad all this day, and come with a Head so disorder∣ed with the East-wind and dust, that I can say very little this night. The Lords and Commons have not yet found the way of agreeing upon the method of trying the Earl of Danby and the other Lords. The Bishops are the principal causes of the dispute, affecting a right to sit as Judges, and content themselves to leave the exercise of it to the Papists, but with a protestation that the Prece∣dent be not alledged against them for the future, but insist upon sitting in
<PB N="71" REF="67"/>
the Earl of Danby's case, until they come to vote upon life or death; and to shew how ingenious they are in that point, they profess they do no preju∣dice to their calling, in being his Judges, resolving not to condemn him. The truth is, that business is full of a multitude of difficulties, that are very hard to decide; the chief of which are, first, whether the King hath power to pardon one impeached by the Com∣mons; secondly, whether that Judg∣ment belonging to the declaratory part of the Law, is to be given by one or both Houses. Thirdly, in case the King can pardon, whether this hath the for∣malities required. Fourthly, If this par∣don be not good, whether he may be admitted to plead any thing else. Fifthly, If he may plead, whether the
<PB N="72" REF="68"/>
points he is accused of amount to Trea∣son, which may probably exercise the House until it be dissolved or pro∣rogued. The two Houses differ also, in that the Lords would first try the Popish Lords, and the Commons would give the preference to Danby.</P>
<P>The Duke Hamilton arrived the last week from Scotland with a great train, and was received here in triumph: All that come with him say, the Arch∣bishop of St. Andrew's was killed by one that had been his own Steward, and others that were not Conventicle∣men.</P>
<P>The <HI>severe Bill</HI> against the <HI>Duke of York</HI> was read on Thursday last, and is appointed to be read again to-mor∣row.
<PB N="73" REF="69"/>
It recites the Pope's pretensions to power over Kings, particularly in England; the Immorality of the Ro∣man Religion; Incompatibility of those that profess it with English Pro∣testants; their perpetual Plots against the Government; sedulity in seducing the Duke; and a multitude of other things of the like nature in the pream∣ble: Asserts the power of Parliament to dispose of the Succession, as best conduced to the good of the King∣dom, which had been often exercised in debarring those that were nearest in blood, but never with so much rea∣son as now: Wherefore it doth enact, <Q>that the Duke should be, and was thereby excluded; declares him at∣tainted of high Treason, if he land∣ed in England before or after the
<PB N="74" REF="70"/>
King's death; forbids commerce or correspondency with him, under the same penalty of Treason.</Q> This pleas∣eth the City so well, that a petition is framing there, which will be pre∣sented in two Days, signed by one hundred thousand men, to give thanks unto the Parliament for their vigorous proceeding in discovering the Plot, and opposing of Popery, and promising to assist them in so doing with their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>The Committee of Lords being in∣formed that some important papers were hid in a wall at Tart-hall, they sent to break it, and in a copper Box found those which the Attorney Ge∣neral says give more light into the Plot, than all they had formerly seen;
<PB N="75" REF="71"/>

<P>YOUR Nephew arrived here last night, and I going to welcome him, received your letter from him. His friends find he bears in his face too fair marks of a Spanish journey, but in all things else, I believe he will give them as entire satisfaction as unto me, who ever had an extraordinary good opinion of him.</P>
<P>This day was se'nnight the proro∣gation of the Parliament was spoken of, but being then uncertain, and (as I thought) not like to be, I was not
<PB N="77" REF="73"/>
willing to mention it; but it fell out the next day, and all men's wits have been screwed ever since that day to find out the consequences. Every body hath had his conjecture, and the most ignorant shewed themselves the most bold, in asserting their opinions. Many find that the King would not have done it, if he had not resolved to send for the Duke; keep up the Army; desire assistances from abroad; sell Jer∣sey and Tangier to the French, (for which Mr. Savile is to make the bar∣gain) set the Earl of Danby at liberty, and with the help of the Papists and Bishops set up for himself. But instead of this, we see little reason to believe the Duke will think himself well here: The Army is in part disbanded, and had been entirely before this day, if it
<PB N="78" REF="74"/>
had pleased Colonel Birch. The place from whence the foreign assistances should come is not known: Mr. Sa∣vile is not thought very good at such Treaties: The Earl of Danby is like to lie where he is, and the utmost help his Majesty can (for ought I hear) ex∣pect, until the Parliament do meet, is, by Fox, Kent, and Duncomb's credit, which perhaps will not be found to be a very steddy foundation. No man will avow having been the King's Counsellor in this business; and some wonder, that his Majesty in constitut∣ing the privy Council, having promised that he would have no cabinet Coun∣cil, but that he would in all things fol∣low their advices, next unto those of his great Council the Parliament; should so suddenly prorogue that great
<PB N="79" REF="75"/>
Council, without so much as asking the other. This fills men with many ill humours; the Parliament-men go down discontented, and are like by their reports to add unto the discon∣tents of the Countries, which are al∣ready very great; and the fears from the Papists at home, and their friends abroad, being added thereunto, they begin to look more than formerly unto the means of preserving themselves.</P>
<P>There hath been a suit at Law in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine a great man in the Highlands, and the Earl (as is said) by the favour of Duke Latherdale, hath obtained a decree for the Lands in question; which by order from hence, is to be put in execution, by the
<PB N="80" REF="76"/>
strength of all the King's forces in Scotland, and fire and sword to be used in case they find resistance; as probably they will, Macclaine resolving he will not be turned out of his ancient inheri∣tance by a trick in law, and a decree from corrupt Judges: This Man being head of a numerous and stout people, helped by the fastness and poverty of their Country, may perhaps make good what he proposeth unto himself; and to shew he is not to be surprised, he hath already entered into Argyle's Country with 800 or 1000 men. The Earl of Athol is his neighbour, friend, and enemy to Argyle, so as it is be∣lieved, he may give him secret assist∣ance at the first, and afterwards more openly. About the same time a pro∣clamation was there published, mak∣ing
<PB N="81" REF="77" MS="y"/>
it Treason to be present at any of the Field-Conventicles that are armed; and every man knowing the pressures they are exposed unto if they go dis∣armed, they must incurr the penalties, or abstain wholly from going, which they will hardly be perswaded unto. Things being thus brought unto ex∣tremities, the King hath been per∣swaded to give a hearing unto what the Duke Hamilton, and other Scotch Lords, have to say against Latherdale, as is appointed before the Council.</P>
<P>Two associates were offered unto Sir Thomas Chichely, for the better executing of his Office of Master of the Ordnance; but he thinking that an affront to a man of so eminent abili∣ties as himself, refused them, which
<PB N="82" REF="78"/>
hath obliged the King to dismiss him from the place, and put it into com∣mission, as some others have been; Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir William Hick∣man, and Sir Joseph Lowther are said to be the men. If what is said be true, the ill management of the Trea∣sury was not more extreme, than this of the Ordnance; for besides the ex∣travagancies of furnishing the French Armies with arms and ammunition, (whereas the Stores where fuller two years ago than ever they were known to have been) there are now but six hundred muskets in the Tower, and other things in proportion.</P>
<P>Some think these ways of <HI>employing many Parliament-men,</HI> may strengthen the King's party in the House. Others
<PB N="83" REF="79"/>
think, that a <HI>King is ever a loser when he enters into a Faction, and ban∣dys against his Subjects;</HI> besides that these men will lose their credit, and, having only single votes, will be over∣powered by number. I do not find the new privy Counsellors well at ease, and am not free from sear, that whilst they endeavour to keep fair with both parties, they may give distaste unto both. Harry Sydney is to go Envoy extraor∣dinary into Holland, and yesterday the King declared unto him his intention to that purpose.</P>
<P>Vanlieu the Holland Ambassador is arrived, and Van Beuninghen going away. He made the last week a great noise about a message sent by the King of France unto his Masters, concern∣ing
<PB N="84" REF="80"/>
the contribution-money due from the Country about Breda; denouncing in a very terrible manner, his inten∣tion of levying it by force, if it were not paid; and that in an <HI>Ottoman</HI> stile, which unto some silly people gave as silly a hope, that the peace would break, and the league be renew∣ed against the French; but the French Ambassador says, it is a thing of no moment at all, and already composed. However I see no inclinations in dis∣creet men here, to desire such a dis∣composure of things abroad, as should engage us to take any part in them, until our affairs are better settled at home than they are yet like to be.</P>
<P>Ireland is in extreme disorder, by the Duke of Ormond's negligence, ig∣norance,
<PB N="85" REF="81"/>
and favour to the Irish. Dou∣glass his Regiment thinking to use the same licentiousness at Kinsale, as it had been accustomed unto in France, gives great distaste, and apprehensions of such works as began almost by the same ways in 1641. Old Roberts, in appearing of late for the King and Bishops, thinks himself of merit to suc∣ceed him; but he is as singular in that opinion as in many others.</P>
<P>Some that know matters better than I do, must tell you, whether we shall have the same Parliament, at the end of the prorogation, or a new one, or none at all. But I think, this, or ano∣ther will be found necessary; and if this be dissolved, another will be cho∣sen of less inclinations to favour the
<PB N="86" REF="82"/>
Court. The four Priests are sent down to be hanged, where they were con∣demned. The Council gave order to the Lord Mayor, to be very diligent in putting the Proclamations against the Papists in execution, and careful un∣der that name not to trouble Pro∣testant dissenters. It is said that Lang∣horne, Wakeman, Sir Joseph Gage, Sir William Goring, and other Popish Commoners, shall be soon brought to their tryal. Now the Parliament doth not sit, little news will be stirring, but you shall constantly have such as I know, or any other service that lies in the Power of</P>

<P>THE best news I can now send you, is, that your Nephew and mine is looked upon as we wish, and I believe he will perform all that you and I expect from him.</P>
<P>There hath been a suit at Law de∣pending this good while in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine, the head of a great and nu∣merous family in the Highlands. The Earl (as is said) by the help of the Duke of Latherdale, obtained of late a Decree for the possession of the Lands
<PB N="88" REF="84"/>
in question, and an order was sent from hence unto the King's Officers, to assist the Earl in executing the de∣cree, and use fire and sword against such as should oppose it; which was so far prosecuted, that he with 300 of the King's men and 500 of his own, raised upon an Island of Macclaine's, which he was not able to defend, or perhaps thought it his best course by way of diversion to draw Argyle from thence; but what reason soever per∣swaded him, he said he would not be put out of the Inheritance of his An∣cestors by a trick in law, and the cor∣ruption of the Judges; and joining the Macdonnells unto himself, fell into Argyle's Country with near 3000 men, where he found no resistance; the Lady of Argyle was obliged to leave
<PB N="89" REF="85"/>
her house, and in some haste retired to Edinborough to get relief, which could not easily be granted, lest the Fana∣ticks should take advantage of the King's forces being so employed. Some say this is only a family feud, others believe it hath a deeper root; but what∣soever this is, no man doubts of the truth of the news brought hither by an express on Saturday morning; which is, that the Conventicle-men in the County of Glascow are in arms; that one Captain Grimes coming some∣thing too near them, with his Troop and other forces, was beaten back, with the loss of his Cornet and fourteen Troopers; which according to the posture he found them in, he was per∣swaded to content himself with, ra∣ther than to press farther. The Coun∣cil
<PB N="90" REF="86"/>
was called upon this occasion on Saturday last, but nothing (as I hear) resolved until they hear more, some doubting whether it be a laid business, or a sudden tumult raised by accident. I know not the truth of this, but <HI>the discourses I have heard very often of late, of those who every day expected some such thing,</HI> perswades me to be∣lieve it is not fallen out by chance. Though no resolution was taken at Council upon this matter, it is said, that private orders are given out to se∣veral Officers of the late disbanded Troops, to get their men again toge∣ther; and to others, upon the most plausible pretences that they can in∣vent, to delay their disbanding as much as may be. These suspicions go too far, and already reach some of your
<PB N="91" REF="87"/>
friends and mine, to such a degree, that <HI>Counsellors are rather said to be changed than Councils;</HI> and if they do not find a way to cure that sore, at the next meeting of the Parliament, they will be looked on as their predecessors. If nothing from Scotland hinders, the Court will go to Windsor to-morrow. I presume you know that H. Syd∣ney hath bought Mr. Godolphin's place of Master of the Robes, gives 6000 pounds, and is to go Envoy ex∣traordinary into Holland. The Lord Ranalagh for the same sum paid to the Lord Sunderland is made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber in his place, and the great business concerning his ac∣count is referred to the Council in Ireland.</P>

<P>THE Scotch news that I men∣tioned to you last week, doth still possess the minds of all men here; but all relations that come from Scot∣land are so imperfect, that no man knows what to make of them; and those that come to Court being more particularly so than others, no men are thought to understand less of the bu∣siness than Privy Counsellors. This is attributed to Latherdale; and though it be concluded, that what he says is not true, some think the business worse, others better, than it is represented.

The fact, as far as I hear, is, that the Earl of Lithco with above five and twenty hundred horse and foot did come within a few miles of the Con∣venticle-men, and finding them in such a posture, as he did not think it pru∣dent to charge them, he concluded the best was to let them take Glascow, where they are said to have found good store of arms, ammunition and some cannon, and having left so many men in the Town as are thought suf∣ficient to guard it, they march with four pieces. They are said to encrease in number every day, but we know nothing of them certainly, unless it be that they have no landed men amongst them, nor any Gentlemen, but a young∣er brother to a Knight of the Hamil∣ton family. The last week we heard
<PB N="95" REF="91"/>
of nothing but raising of great forces to subdue these Rebels. The Dukes of Monmouth, Albemarle, and Lord Garret were to have Regiments of Horse, Feversham one of Dragoons and Grenadiers, the Lord Cavendish, Grey of Werk, Mr. T. Thinne, and some others, Regiments of Foot; but that heat seems to be something abated. The Lord Grey gave up his Commission, Mr. Thinne refused to take any; Ca∣vendish doth not raise any men upon his, and Garret swears he will not be at a penny charge to raise a man, but if the Commissioners for the Treasury will raise him a Regiment, and provide money to pay it, he will command it. Whilst ways were sought to remove these difficulties, the Scotch Lords that are here endeavoured to perswade the
<PB N="96" REF="92"/>
King, that the business may be ended by far more certain and less chargeable ways, in as much as these men having been driven into a necessity of taking arms, by the extreme pressure suffered from those that did abuse the autho∣rity his Majesty had trusted them with, the people being eased of those bur∣thens, the persons removed that had caused them, and such men placed in the Government, as were acceptable to the Nation, they durst undertake that all may be composed without blood. This was not (as I hear) disliked, but another point was started, that doth yet more incline the Court to mild courses; which is, in the Year 1641 Acts of Parliament were made in both Kingdoms, making it Treason for any person belonging unto either to make
<PB N="97" REF="93"/>
war upon or invade the other, without the consent of Parliament. And though one or two of the Judges say, that the Acts being reciprocal, the Scots having rescinded theirs, ours falls of itself; or though it did not, the act forbid∣ding an Invasion, no ways toucheth such as by the King's command should go to subdue Rebels; others say, that what the Scots did might indeed give unto the Parliament of England a just ground of annulling their act also, but not having done it, no man can doubt but it remains in force; and whoso∣ever marcheth against Scotland incurrs the penalties of Treason denounced by it. And some that were present at the making of it, are so far from ap∣proving the distinction between <HI>in∣vading</HI> and <HI>subduing Rebels,</HI> as to say,
<PB N="98" REF="94"/>
that the Parliament then finding they had been upon the like pretence en∣gaged against Scotland in 1638 and 39, made this act expressly to hinder any such a business as that which is now depending; and to take care, that England should never be again engaged against Scotland, without the consent of the Parliament; which was also the reason why the act was conti∣nued in force on our side, though it was dissolved on theirs. This renders men of estates unwilling to engage, and hereupon the Duke of Monmouth was sent away yesterday in such haste, as to carry no more company with him, than could go in one day to your good town of Newark, where he was to lodge the last night. He is fur∣nished with powers of indulgence to
<PB N="99" REF="95"/>
compose rather than destroy; and the Lord Melvin (who is thought well enough inclined to Non-conformists, and well liked by them) is sent with him, as being thought a fit Minister of a good agreement. The foot that was embarqued in the Thames is gone for Barwick, where it is to stay to se∣cure the Town; and the other forces, that are newly entertained, are to con∣tinue only for a Month. This looks as if your friend Latherdale may with∣in a while be lest as naked as the Earl of Danby. The army is almost every where disbanded, unless it be these that upon this occasion are again taken into pay, and the Countries almost every where express the utmost hatred unto them, as soon as they have laid down their arms. Douglas his Regiment now
<PB N="100" REF="96"/>
in Ireland, as is said, hath orders to march into Scotland, which giving people oc∣casion to talk of that Country, they say that the King having lately placed the greatest powers of the three King∣doms in the hands of the three worst men that could be found in them, can never be at ease until they are all sa∣crificed, to expiate the faults of the Government, and appease the discon∣tents of the Nation.</P>
<P>Harry Sydney hath his Instructions for Holland. Sir Henry Goodrike is going into Spain, as a pattern by which that Court may judge of the wit and good sense of our Nation. On Friday last Harcourt, Whitebread, and three other Priests were, at the old Baily, found guilty of the Plot, and con∣demned
<PB N="101" REF="97"/>
as Traitors. On Saturday the like sentence passed upon Langhorne. The trials were in all respects fair, even by the confession of the adversaries. The arraigned persons placed all the hopes of their defence upon the inva∣lidating of Oates his testimony, to which end they had about 16 witnesses sent from St. Omer's, to assert that they had seen him every day in May and June was a twelve month at St. Omer's, and consequently he could not be here as he doth assert; but as three of them, having been apprehended by Sir Will. Waller at their first coming, told him they were come to be witnesses, and being asked what they were to witness, they said they must know that from their superiors; it did plainly appear at the trial, that they were ready to say
<PB N="102" REF="98"/>
whatever they were bid; and Oates did plainly prove by a Knight and two of his servants, two Protestant Par∣sons, a Popish Priest, and some others, that he was here at that time; so as his testimony was taken without dis∣pute. This is a dangerous leading case for the Lords in the Tower, whose principal hopes were to invalidate the testimony of Oates, Bedloe, and Dug∣dale; all which being confirmed by the judgment of a jury in the face of all London, cannot be questioned. Wakeman was to have been tried the same day, but being arraigned the trial was put off for a month, as is said, at the sollicitation of the Portugal Am∣bassador, and in a way that to many seemed scandalous. If the Scotch bu∣siness be settled, the King will go to
<PB N="103" REF="99"/>
Windsor as he intended. You may re∣member that the last year four Irish∣men were spoken of, for having been sent down thither to attempt upon the King's life; it is now said that one An∣tonio, a servant to the Queen, told one belonging to the Duke of Monmouth at that time, that four Irishmen were expected there about a business of great importance; and the King's harbinger says, four such were then recommend∣ed to him, as men he must take a care of, and see well lodged.

<P>I TOLD you in my last, that the Duke of Monmouth was gone to∣wards <HI>Scotland,</HI> since which time re∣ports have been so various, that no man well knows what to make of that business; and the cause of this uncer∣tainty is imputed to the diligence of the King's Officers, who intercept and keep all letters directed unto persons any ways suspected, so as no more is known, than they think fit to divulge. An express arrived here on Saturday-night from Edinburgh, and brought news that the Duke of Monmouth arrived there on Wednesday: That he
<PB N="105" REF="101"/>
had been received with great joy, and as much honour, as those that were there could shew unto him: That the Council having been immediately call∣ed, he exposed unto them his Com∣mission, which was very well liked: That the Chancellor invited him to supper that night, and that he was the next morning to go to the Army, having first sent an express to the Lord Lithco, that commands it, no ways to engage in any action before he comes. Some think that he hath the Conven∣ticle-men at an advantage, and will pursue it to their destruction. Others say, that upon the extreme aversion that is shewn all over England to a War in Scotland, and the little probability yet appearing of the Parliament's being any ways engageable in it, he hath receiv∣ed
<PB N="106" REF="102"/>
much more gentle instructions, and intends, by the help of the Lord Mel∣vin, to compose those businesses if he can; and if he can accomplish it, will certainly render himself very popular in England and Scotland.</P>
<P>The Duke Hamilton and some other Scotch Lords, having let his Majesty know, that the disorders in Scotland proceeded only from the extreme pres∣sures the people was brought under, by those who contrary to Law ab∣used the power his Majesty had trusted them with, did undertake to finish all without blood, if he would be pleased to ease them of those pres∣sures, and, removing those who had caused them, put the Government of the Kingdom into the hands of such persons as were well-pleasing unto the
<PB N="107" REF="103"/>
Nation. This having been taken into consideration for some days, the Duke Hamilton with the rest, and one Loc∣kart, were sent for by the King, who told them, the points formerly spoken of did relate unto his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> which in <HI>three points</HI> he would not suffer to be touched: 1st, That he having a right of disposing of all <HI>places,</HI> might incapacitate such persons as he should think fit: 2dly, That it belonging to him to prevent <HI>conspira∣cies,</HI> he might secure and imprison suspected persons; and that there was no such thing as a Habeas Corpus in Scotland, nor should be as long as he liv'd: 3dly, That it being his part to prevent or to quell <HI>rebellions,</HI> he might raise such forces as he pleased, quarter them where he thought fit, and em∣ploy
<PB N="108" REF="104"/>
them as occasion should require. To which Lockart replied, that the <HI>places</HI> in question were those belonging to Counties and Corporations, which had ever been chosen by the <HI>people</HI> re∣spectively according to their Charters. And forasmuch as concerns <HI>conspiracies</HI> and <HI>rebellions,</HI> he thought he could prove, that what his Majesty did as∣sert did neither agree with the Laws of Scotland, nor any other Law, nor the ends for which that, or any other Government was constituted.</P>
<P>The next point in discourse was con∣cerning some articles exhibited against Latherdale; in which it is said, that <Q>his Majesty for several years passed had been utterly misinformed, and never known the truth of any thing relating unto Scotland, but been
<PB N="109" REF="105"/>
guided by such reports as best suited with Latherdale's interests.</Q> That he had been thereby induced to bring down the last year that army of bar∣barous Highlanders, upon pretence of mutinous and seditious Field-conventi∣cles; whereas such meetings as had been, were modest and quiet; and quartered them in those countries where there never had been any at all. Several other misdemeanors are said to be mentioned, and amongst others, that of Michell, who had been put to death after having had a promise of life and limb, by false oaths made by Lather∣dale and some others of the privy Council. The conclusion was, the King commanded the Duke that <HI>these articles should not be made publick.</HI> In which he excused himself, forasmuch
<PB N="110" REF="106"/>
as having done nothing in the dark, several copies had been taken, which were not in his power. Some say, we shall this day see them in print, with the Declaration of the Conventicle∣men, printed at Glascow, which is very well worth seeing. The forces of these Conventicle-men, or, as they call them∣selves, the Western Army, are vari∣ously reported. Some say, they have 14000 or 15000 Men; others, that this Day was a se'nnight they had, not far from Stirling, between two and three thousand Horse, well armed and mounted, with about the like number of Foot; that a brother of the Earl of Galloway was coming to them, and within three hours march, with above four hundred horse and foot, and that they had parties of good strength in several other places.</P>

The five Priests formerly condemn∣ed, were executed on Saturday, con∣fessing nothing. Langhorne is reprieved for some time, upon his offer to con∣fess that which shall deserve his Life. The Earl of Shaftsbury hath been twice with him, but, as is said, hath as yet gained nothing from him, but the dis∣covery of some Lands belonging to the Jesuits, Franciscans, and Benedictins, not exceeding two thousand pounds a year, which will not save his life. Wake∣man is to be tried this week at the King's Bench bar. His relations desire he should confess, and think he will. It is said that about this time was a twelvemonth, some women visiting his wife, saw a daughter of his, growing up to be marriageable, which gave oc∣casion to the gossips to ask the mother,
<PB N="112" REF="108"/>
what portion she should have? To which she answered, that if one thing hit right, Sir George would give her ten thousand pounds; which people now reflecting upon, together with the life and estate of the Person, believe That <HI>one</HI> thing which was to enable him to give so large a portion, was the 15000 pounds, which was promised him to poison the King.</P>
<P>There is a certain Petition prepar∣ing in London to be presented unto the King, which, as is said, will be sign∣ed by many Lords, Gentlemen, and all the principal house-holders of the City of London, taking notice of the Ar∣my having been raised upon pretence of the French War, kept up by Dan∣by's means contrary to an Act of Par∣liament,
<PB N="113" REF="109"/>
as a standing Army. In the next place it mentions the Acts of Parliament made in England and Scot∣land, making it Treason for the sub∣jects of either kingdom to invade the other, or the subjects thereof, giving power and enjoining all other subjects of either to fall upon and destroy such as should in any time attempt to do it, as rebels and traitors; and shewing the dangerous consequences of forcing the Protestants of his kingdom to imbrue their hands in each other's blood, if according to the rumour spread of a war in Scotland, any men should con∣trary to the act march against them; desiring his Majesty to put an end to their fears in that point, compose things there, suffer the Parliament to meet the 14th of August, bring Dan∣by
<PB N="114" REF="110"/>
and others to their trials, perfect the disbanding of the army, and other new-rais'd forces. If this petition do take, as some believe, it will be sent to the Grand Juries in the several coun∣ties, and come up signed by so many as shall approve of it. Some say, the Highlanders have laid down their arms, and submit the determination of their differences with Argyle to the King.</P>
<P>The Speaker Jeffryes is made a Ba∣ron of the Exchequer in the place of Leak, who resigned it.

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> This long letter was to have been sent by the last post, and left by accident till it is in danger of appear∣ing unseasonable. A Courier arrived the last night from Scotland, who brings word, that the Duke of Mon∣mouth had attacked the Conventicle-men, and easily forcing a little barri∣cado they had made to defend a bridge, had utterly defeated them. Some letters say, two thousand are killed upon the place; but my Lord
<PB N="116" REF="112" MS="y"/>
Sunderland tells me there is only some hundreds slain, many taken, and the whole party dissipated and destroyed; by which means it is said, that the Duke of Monmouth will have made himself as popular in England and Scotland as the Duke of York. Men here will be startled at present, but that will not hold. The Scotch Lords here have been so wise as to leave their countrymen to be cut in pieces, but (as some believe) not enough to keep themselves so free from corresponding with them, as not to leave that, which being well followed may bring their heads to the block.

<P>I WRITE to you now rather to keep my day, than from an opinion that these last days have produced any thing that deserves to be communi∣cated unto you. The news concerning the Scots, mentioned in my last, is con∣firmed by several expresses, and all shew their defeat to have been entire, the party dissipated, and those who es∣caped the fury of the sword remain exposed to the discretion of their con∣querors. I find men's judgments as various, as to the use will be made of
<PB N="119" REF="115"/>
this advantage, as of the Duke of Mon∣mouth's action in what is passed. Some did think that they being a poor peo∣ple, brought into despair by the most violent persecution, pitied by all both in England and Scotland, helped by none, without head or conduct, were to be spared; and that in doing so, he might have made himself very po∣pular in both Kingdoms, (which he is thought with reason much to desire) and best to have provided for the King's interest. Others, who look upon it as a fine thing to kill a great many men, and believe Monarchies are best kept up by terrour, extol the action, and say there is no other way of suppressing old rebellions, or preventing new ones, than by force and rigour; looking up∣on Caligula as a great Statesman, and
<PB N="120" REF="116"/>
<HI>oderint dum metuant</HI> as a good maxim. Some think that the Duke of Mon∣mouth's first instructions were accord∣ing to the first of these ways, but that he was followed by others, which sa∣voured much of the second; those that were of the first opinion, do now think the best way were to compose things there, and by shewing indulgence not only in sparing those that are obnoxi∣ous, but in giving them such indul∣gence in matters of conscience, as may satisfy them, prevent the like, and please the Body of the English Nation, which hath given many tokens of be∣ing much concerned for them. On the other side, those are not wanting who think the best way of bringing that stubborn people into subjection, and keep 'em, as they call it in peace, free from
<PB N="121" REF="117"/>
rebellions, is to use the utmost rigour upon those that are in their power, and to discover who did in any measure assist or abet them; and in order there∣unto the prisoners are used most cruel∣ly, and it is said, that at the least forty of the most noted men amongst them shall be put into the <HI>Boots</HI> my Lord of Latherdale hath brought into fashion, to make them discover what correspon∣dence the great men held with them. I know not how far this may concern some that are, or lately have been here but it is probable enough they may have the fortune that ordinarily accompa∣nies them that pretending to be very subtile and keep well with both sides, ever do too much or too little; and that whereas they might have prevent∣ed all tumults, if they had endeavoured
<PB N="122" REF="118"/>
it, by denying all manner of favour to the discontented people; or reformed the state of that Kingdom, if they would have taken the conduct of them, and very well provided for their own interest by either way, may have ruin∣ed these poor people by stirring them up, and leaving them to themselves; brought the whole Nation under the power of their enemy, and given such advantages against themselves, as may be their ruin, if they are pursued; that is, to perish or be saved by the mercy of him they profess to abhor. Duke Hamilton complains he is ruined by this business, and that not only all the provisions of victuals and corn and grass upon the ground is destroyed, but that there is not a Cow, one Horse or Sheep left upon his whole estate; and
<PB N="123" REF="119"/>
his own house had been plundered, if the Duke of Monmouth had not sent an Officer to preserve it. But Lather∣dale says, he cannot believe that Hamil∣ton's friends, tenants, and servants, would so far forget their dependence, obligations and good manners, as to deal uncivilly with him. Such as are near unto those who manage businesses may speak positively of them, but I must as you see suspend my judgment, until the Duke of Monmouth comes back, which is expected in a few days.</P>
<P>The Petition I mentioned in my last did meet with some interruption, but the defeat of the Scots put an end to it. Those who use to extol all that relates to Rome, admire the constancy of the five Priests executed the last week,
<PB N="124" REF="120"/>
but we simple people find no more in it, than that the Papists, by arts formerly unknown to mankind, have found ways of reconciling falshood in the utmost degree with the hopes of salvation, and at the best have no more to brag of, than that they have made men dye with lies in their mouths. Langhorne's discoveries being trivial, relating only to lands of a small value belonging to Convents, I think he will be hanged this day or to-morrow. Wakeman's trial is put off, as is believed to avoid the indecency of the discourses that would have been made. This day and to-morrow will bring all the Court to Windsor. The King is to meet the Council every Thursday at Hampton Court, and we of the Vulgar expect after their first meeting to hear, whe∣ther
<PB N="125" REF="121"/>
the Parliament shall meet or no, at the time appointed. Some speak as if our small Queen, upon pretence of going to Burton, would be so cruel as to leave us.</P>

<P>IF I had a mind to play the Poli∣tick, like a house of Commons man newly preferred to be a privy Counsel∣lor, I should very gravely excuse myself for not writing to you by the last post, and lay the fault upon my want of lei∣sure, putting as much weight upon a Law-suit, as they do upon affairs of State; but having at their costs learnt, that those who make such discourses, cheat none but themselves, I inge∣nuously confess, I had nothing to say; and that now the Parliament is pro∣rogued and the Court at Windsor, I

hear little more than I shall do when I am dead. The truth is, some of our friends being newly grown men of business, are so politick and secret, that a man who sees it can hardly forbear laughing; but none is so ingenuous as to be content men should do it, except the Lord Ha∣lifax, who is sometimes free enough with his Companions to begin. I long since found that the design of sending H.

to be no more, than under the pretence of a guaranty to draw Hol∣land and Spain into a League with England, which may help the Prince of Orange with an occasion of breaking the peace lately made; which I believe will take effect, if the French can be perswaded to sleep three months, and take no notice of it; if the Louvesteine party in Holland, and their associates can be brought to believe the Prince of Orange thinks of advancing no in∣terest but the publick good of the Country; and if our house of Com∣mons can be so well satisfied with the management of the last business in Flanders, as to be willing to raise a new army under the same conduct, and to believe one that is so raised, will conduce to the defence of Flanders, as much as the last.</P>

The last post brought me yours of July the 12th, and if you confess you did not know what to make of the Scotch business before you had my let∣ters, I may conclude you were as much in the dark afterwards, for I could not make you understand that which I am ignorant of; and to say the truth, I am so; a great part of our modern pru∣dence being to suppress informations of the truth, which I take to be as great a point of subtilty as that of one of our friends, who concealed a misfor∣tune befallen him in the first acquain∣tance he had with a woman, until he was like to fall into pieces. Some think the great Lords will be found to have incited the poor people, and then en∣deavoured to value themselves at Court upon the power they had of appeasing
<PB N="130" REF="126"/>
them; and if that prove true, they may have the fortune that ordinarily ac∣companies those that do too much or too little, and my Lord Latherdale's Boots will be a powerful means of discovering whether this be so or no.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Flamarin hath been received at Windsor as seriously, as if it had been believed the Queen of Spain's marriage should not hold, unless it were here approved, and the forma∣lities that are usual with men of busi∣ness, having been observed to him, he is grown to think he is so. You know Monsieur de Barillion governs us (if he be not mistaken) but he seems not to be so much pleased with that, as to find his <HI>Embonpoint</HI> encreased by the moist∣ness of our air, by frequently clapping
<PB N="131" REF="127"/>
his hands upon his thighs, shewing the delight he hath in the sharpness of the sound that testifies the plumpness and hardness of his flesh; and certainly if this climate did not nourish him better than any other, the hairs in his nose, and nails of his fingers could not grow so fast as to furnish enough of the one to pull out, and of the other to cut off in all Companies, which being done he picks his ears with as good a grace as my Lord La. The dissolution of the Tables at Windsor hath caused a great solitude there, which leaves the King few better entertainments than fishing, and unto some of our friends a good opportunity of making their court, which they improve. A man is come out of the North, who says, that Sir Thomas Gascoin did treat with him
<PB N="132" REF="128"/>
to undertake to kill the King, sent him to London to receive farther instruc∣tions, and tells his story so discreetly, that every body believes him. He seems to involve Sir George Ratclife of North∣umberland, who had been formerly taxed by Oates. One Carrill, a Sus∣sex Gentleman, was last week seiz∣ed and brought before Oates; he says he is a Jesuit, and the same man that by those of the Society was called Blun∣dell, of whom much hath been said.</P>
<P>I dare not assure you that the Gentle∣man to, whom the Letters were ad∣dressed that I sent to you, is as honest as he is understanding in business, be∣cause I doubt men that are necessitous and live by their wits, may be apt to swerve from the best way, and I know
<PB N="133" REF="129"/>
some of his near relations to be very naught; but I can truly say, that in many years acquaintance I have not found him guilty of any ill thing, and I am sure that a brother of his, having undertaken one that was abominable, he was so far from joining with him, that he discovered it to the person con∣cerned in it, and as I believe thereby saved his life; and since that time so brake with his brother, as never to have looked upon him for this 13 or 14 years. I hear the Duke of Monmouth is expected here this day. We poor people know nothing of the sitting of the Parliament, but are confident it will not be in August.</P>

<P>YOU may with reason believe, I am little informed of what passeth in the world, that in my last letter I said nothing of the Parliament, which I make no doubt but others, that writ to you the same day, said was dissolved. The truth is, the bu∣siness being done at Hampton-Court, the news came not hither until the afternoon, and I having it two or three hours later than others, had already sent my letter to the post, and could not recover it to make an addition, though of so great importance. This business is wholly imputed unto your two friends, and the other that ever
<PB N="135" REF="131"/>
joins with them; but the King find∣ing it would not pass at Council, takes it wholly upon himself; tho' that, as well as some other things of the like nature, are thought not well to agree with what his Majesty was pleased to declare when he made the new Coun∣cil, to have no Cabinet Council, but next unto the advices of the Parlia∣ment to follow their's in all things; and the world looking upon this as the work of the three above mentioned, they begin to be spoken of all over England in the same manner as Dan∣by, and I fear, may be impeached the next Parliament upon this point, and the War in Scotland, as is said, con∣trary to an act Parliament in the Year 1641. The new Parliament is to meet on the 7th of October: there
<PB N="136" REF="132"/>
will be as great canvassing for Places as ever, people believing this Parlia∣ment was dissolved only in hopes of having one that would be less careful of the publick interest. All men that wish well unto it, think it necessary to imploy all their industry in endeavour∣ing to make it better in that sense; and many believe they will effect it, though some probably will grow weary of the expences of Elections, and the ways of preventing them as yet are not settled. The Lord Halifax is made an Earl, under the same title. The Lord Sunderland hath order to pre∣pare Warrants to confer the same ho∣nour upon the Lords Garret and Ro∣berts.</P>
<P>The Lord of Wiltshire's marriage with Mrs. Coventry was the last week

Lang∣horne was yesterday hanged, professing the same innocence that the Jesuites did, and had the fortune as well as they, to be believed only by those that are in the same crimes, or are con∣cerned in having them concealed. This day the Council was extraordi∣narily assembled at Hampton-Court, to consider of Wakeman's business, with its consequences, which notwith∣standing he is to be tried to-morrow at the Old Baily.</P>
<P>The last week the King gave the Scotch Lords a hearing against Lather∣dale;
<PB N="138" REF="134"/>
they had counsel on both sides; Lockart and Cunningham did under∣take to prove a multitude of things done by Latherdale to have been a∣gainst law; and Mackenzy, the King's Advocate, being of counsel for him, could no ways disprove them, but had recourse unto the Royal Authority. The Lords of Essex and Halifax were present, and both of them, but espe∣cially the latter, did very much uphold the complainants, and, amongst other things, told the King he saw the Sco∣tish nation was more free than the English. Nevertheless answer was re∣turned to them, that Latherdale had done nothing but what his Majesty had commanded, and which he would up∣hold by virtue of his <HI>prerogative,</HI> which was <HI>above the law.</HI> This, as is thought,
<PB N="139" REF="135"/>
will preserve him from punishment, but his place of Secretary will be given to the Lord Magennis.</P>
<P>The Duke of Monmouth, before he came from Scotland, had taken care that the Scotch Prisoners should be used with more humanity than they found amongst their Countrymen, and since his arrival here, orders are sent to enlarge the indulgence granted unto the Non-conformists in their meetings. The result of that business, as far as I understand it, is, a great many fools have been killed; their blood lies upon Latherdale; their folly and the cruelty shewed unto them hath gained a great deal of compassion for those that re∣main of their party, which probably will perswade those in authority here
<PB N="140" REF="136"/>
to proceed more gently; and that which is reasonable in itself, will be rendered absolutely necessary, if the Parliament be suffered to sit; for un∣less they prove to be of a temper very different from what is expected, they will suffer nothing like unto that which hath been.</P>
<P>A business happened lately which makes a great deal of noise. A cer∣tain Captain under the shelter of the African Company committed several Piracies upon the English Company trading in Turky, and lately coming to town, five or six principal Merchants that had received the damage, arrested him, whereupon he complained to the Commissioners of the Admiralty, who sent for the Merchants, and upon their
<PB N="141" REF="137"/>
refusal to release the Captain, commit∣ted them. They addressed themselves to one of the Judges for a Habeas Cor∣pus, who before he granted it, gave notice unto the Commissioners, that the commitment of the Merchants was against Law, advised their release be∣fore the Habeas Corpus was granted, which could not be denied, which the Commissioners refused to do; but ad∣vising farther with Lawyers, found not only that what they had done was un∣warrantable, but that they were sub∣ject to actions for false imprisonment, upon which the injured persons would obtain great damages; so as they found no better way than to release the men, with a great many fair words: But they not being therewith satisfied, resolved to sue them at law, or bring the busi∣ness
<PB N="142" REF="138"/>
into Parliament. I write this two days before the going of the Post, be∣cause I am obliged to make a little journey this day, and shall not be back until he be gone.</P>

<P>I HAVE been out of Town almost this month, so as my last letter to you was dated about that time. At my return I found men's minds more disturbed than ever I remember them to have been, so as there is no extremity of disorder to be imagined, that we might not probably have fallen into if the King had died, or that may not yet reasonably be feared if he should relapse. All that is now to be told of news, is from the Court, and must be known from those that are more conversant there than I am.
<PB N="144" REF="140"/>
Though the Parliament is like to sig∣nify little, people are busy in bringing those in, who are of their own mind; and the party that is most averse to the Court seems to prevail in the Counties and great Corporations, as the other doth in many of the small Boroughs; and upon the whole matter, many be∣lieve the House will be composed as the last was, or, as some think, of a more harsh humour, the same men be∣ing something sharpened.</P>
<P>Your friend the Lord Latherdale is more powerful than ever in Scotland, openly opposeth the Duke of Mon∣mouth, and hath so far prevailed, as to render the indulgences obtained by him utterly ineffectual: But lest his power there should not be sufficient
<PB N="145" REF="141"/>
to protect him here, if the Parliament meets, he doth not disdain a pardon, and as I hear, one is preparing for him. I know not how much your friends and mine do grow at Court, nor whe∣ther the gains they can expect to make there, will countervail what they lose in the Nation; but I do think myself assured, that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lords Halifax and Essex.</NOTE>two of them, who were generally as well esteemed as any men I know, are now as ill spoken of as any; and the asperity one of them shewed against the Papists, is most bit∣terly retorted upon him. If the Par∣liament sits, I shall not be so ignorant as I am of what passeth, and I will with the same care that I did the last time, let you know what I hear, and

<P>IT is indeed a good while since I heard from you, and I have been less diligent in writing to you than formerly, partly because I doubted, whether my letters were any ways ac∣ceptable unto you, and partly because one that is far from Court knows no∣thing worth relating, unless it be in Parliament-time, when all that is done is made publick, or at the least comes to the knowledge of those that have any acquaintance. I am not able to give so much as a guess, whether the Parliament shall sit the 26th of Janu∣ary or not, and though I think myself in all respects well chosen, am uncer∣tain
<PB N="148" REF="144"/>
whether I shall be of it, or not, there being a double return; and no∣thing can be assured, until the que∣stion arising thereupon be determined, unless it be that as I and my princi∣ples are out of fashion, my inclina∣tions going one way, my friendship and alliance with those that are like to give occasion for the greatest con∣tests drawing another, I shall be equal∣ly disliked and suspected by both par∣ties, and thereby become the most in∣considerable member of the <HI>House.</HI> But however matters go, if the house doth sit, and you care to know what I either hear or think, I so far abhor the excuse that is worn out by having been so often alledged by liars and fools, as never to pretend to much bu∣siness
<PB N="149" REF="145"/>
as a reason for my omission; and I think I shall make none.</P>
<P>I have often heard of Monsieur D'Avaux his behaviour in Holland, but did not need any information as to matter of fact, to be assured he would oppose it; to believe he would suc∣ceed, and indeed with some confi∣dence to conclude, that our disap∣pointment in that case is much more for our advantage than what we sought. And as it is said in Religion, that nothing is more terrible than the return of ill-conceived prayers, nothing is more to be feared in Politicks than the success of unreasonable and ill∣grounded counsels. And though the <Q>proposition that was made, being
<PB N="150" REF="146"/>
rejected, will certainly raise the par∣ty in Holland that is least for the Prince of Orange, and cast it into a <HI>dependence upon France;</HI> that is less mortal unto us than a <HI>League,</HI> that would certainly have produced a rupture of the peace, renewed the war all over Europe, exposed Flan∣ders to be lost the first year (which this must have done;</Q> it being as certain, the assistances expected from hence would have failed, as that it hath not in itself that which is neces∣sary for its Defence.) This, and a great deal more upon the like subject was told the Lord Sunderland, and Mr. H. Sydney before he went; but Sir William, who was taken for the oracle of those parts, assured them, there was no such thing as a
<PB N="151" REF="147"/>
party in Holland inclined to oppose the Prince of Orange: That all was sub∣mitted unto his authority, and united in desiring such an alliance with us: That it would certainly be accepted as soon as offered, and that the French which had made the Peace for fear of us, would by the same reason more exactly keep it, when it was seen that we were joined with them. I should think him bewitched, that doth not see there is as many falsities, as to mat∣ter of fact, and mistakes in judgment in this matter, as there are words; but I see no intention of receding from such counsels, nor remedy for the mischiefs they bring upon us. It was also believed this Business would have been liked by the Parliament, but I am as confident, as of this that is
<PB N="152" REF="148"/>
passed, that if the Parliament had met, neither this nor any thing that is like to engage us in any war, would have been endured by them, nor that they would have given a Penny towards it.</P>
<P>You will certainly have heard of a precious <HI>plot,</HI> carried on by a man of four names (who had been almost as many times in the pillory for perjury, and such other pieces of wit) where∣by the Presbyterians should be brought under the suspicion of having one now on foot, which should have given oc∣casion of bailing the Lords in the Tower: But he having had the ill luck to mistake Mansell for Mansfield, carried a bundle of letters, he had forg∣ed, to a wrong place; and bringing some officers of the customs to search
<PB N="153" REF="149"/>
Mansell's lodgings for Flanders lace, and other prohibited commodities, was fain to find them himself; but the mistake of the superscription, which was to Mansfield, the seals not opened, and other circumstances making the fraud to appear, the whole matter va∣nished. About the same time another design of equal prudence and integri∣ty was carried on to suborn Dugdale to renounce his testimony concerning the Popish plot; but he consulted with some friends, placed two good wit∣nesses under the hanging to testify what the woman said, who treated with him; and when he saw a fit time, discovered all to the council, so as that plot also is enervated. We hear of several other persons that would more fully discover the Popish plot;
<PB N="154" REF="150"/>
but as things stand, none dares appear. Serjeant, long spoken of, hath deposed what he knows, and, as I hear, deliver∣ed it into safe hands signed and seal∣ed. H. Sydney is said to have made a very ill discourse to him at the Hague, and if it come before the Parliament, will probably have evil effects. The Duke went towards Scotland on Mon∣day, full of various imaginations, as is said; but some understanding men think he hath nothing, that ought more to please him in his journey than good weather. There is a paper cast about the town of the Earl of Danby his case, which makes a very ill one of it; and amongst other things to prove he was not of the French faction, he says, he needs alledge only the French Ambassador's discourses of him at
<PB N="155" REF="151" MS="y"/>
Madam Mazarin's; this new Logick of proving a thing by a proposition, either false, or as uncertain as itself, being looked upon as the invention of that excellent wit.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear of the dulness you observe in your neighbourhood, and wish you could find means to encrease it, believing that nothing else can keep them from taking advantage of our follies, as I am sure the League would have done, if it had been accepted in Holland. H. Sydney arrived here yes∣terday. The Duke his first lodging was at Hatfield; the Earl of Salisbury being at Quickshot, six miles off, sent his son to excuse his not coming to wait upon his Royal Highness, for that he had been let blood five days before.
<PB N="156" REF="152"/>
No provisions for his entertainment appeared in the house, but two Does upon the table, one barrel of small beer in the cellar, and a pile of faggots. The Duke's servants sent into the town to buy all things necessary, even to can∣dles, and to borrow candlesticks. The gentlemen of the neighbourhood were so charitable as to take the Lord of Ossory and many others to their houses, where they were well entertained. The Duke being unwilling to be burthen∣some to a poor Lord, appointed Sir J. Worden to pay for what he had had, and the Steward took money for the faggots, and eight shillings for the bar∣rel of beer. The Earl of Orrery is dead, and the Lord of Ormond hath made his son Arran, Major-General in his stead; that if the French invade
<PB N="157" REF="153"/>
that kingdom, the army commanded by himself and his two sons may be fit to oppose them.</P>

<P>WE are in a busy time, and how empty soever any man's head hath formerly been, the variety of re∣ports concerning things in agitation do so fill it, at the least with an imagina∣tion of contributing something to other men's inventions, that they have little leisure to do any thing else. This obligeth me to write in haste, and without any other consideration than of the agreement made between you and me, to set down nothing but truth; to tell you in short, that the first day of the Parliament the Lord Russel
<PB N="159" REF="155"/>
named Mr. Williams to be Speaker, who being approved of without con∣tradiction, was with little ceremony, and no excuse made for himself, as∣sented unto by the King. The two next days were spent in swearing the members of the house of Commons, and putting them to the test. On Monday the five and twentieth, the Committees were named, and a multi∣tude of petitions concerning Elections presented, and referred unto that of Privileges and Elections.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the 26th, Dangerfield was brought to the bar of the house of Commons, where he did declare him∣self positively, that the Duke had of∣fered him a great sum of money to kill the King. He also said, that the
<PB N="160" REF="156"/>
Lord Privy Seal, Peterborough and Sir Robert Payton, were privy unto and contrivers of the <HI>Meal-Tub Plot.</HI> The same day the Lord Russell, represent∣ing the mischiefs and dangers that threaten our nation, shewed the Duke to be the center of all. Sir H. Capell seconded him. Sir Francis Winning∣ton made a Recapitulation of all that had been done since the last Parlia∣ment to the prejudice of the nation, in favour of Popery, and imputed the greatest part thereof unto the same cause; whereupon a vote was passed by the house <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that the house should proceed incessantly upon the further discovery of the plot, and the means of preventing a Popish successor.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="157"/>
Wednesday the 27th, Dangerfield was brought into the Speaker's cham∣ber, and being put to his oath by a Justice of the Peace, did depose what he had formerly said. Mr. Hide only and Sir Lionel Jenkins did speak in favour of the Duke; and the latter having the ill luck to say, he did in his heart believe his Royal Highness was as good a Subject as any is in England, one, that was not far off, whisper'd, "and as good a Protestant.</P>
<P>The same day complaint being made in the house of Commons of those who had obstructed Petitions, and some Members severely answering such as had been guilty thereof, Sir Robert Howard desired the House to proceed cautiously therein, his Majesty having
<PB N="162" REF="158"/>
by Proclamation declared such Petiti∣ons to be contrary to Law. Notwith∣standing which admonition, the House did vote nemine contradicente, That it was, and had ever been the right of the Subjects of England to petition his Majesty for the meeting and sitting of Parliaments, until all petitions were heard and grievances redressed. In the second place they appointed a Committee to examine who had been guilty of obstructing such Petitions, and therein betraying their Country. There are six or seven Members of the house of Commons said to have declar∣ed themselves detesters and abhorrers of such Petitions, who, as is thought, will be turned out of the House with∣out other ceremony.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="159"/>
The same day Sir Robert Payton was suspended the House.</P>
<P>An American Jew, lately interpreter to the last Portugal Embassador that was here, did testify before a Commit∣tee of the house of Lords, that he had been suborned by the said Embas∣sador to kill the Earl of Shaftsbury, by casting Hand-granadoe's into his Coach as he should be going to, or coming from Chelsea; and to find others to kill Arnold, Oates and Bed∣loe. He mention'd this at first in the phrensy of a Fever, and finding that he had so discover'd himself, found no better way of security than to de∣clare the whole to the Earl of Cla∣rendon the first day of May last, and deliver'd unto him the whole matter
<PB N="164" REF="160"/>
in writing. The Earl doth neither deny the receipt of the papers, nor give any reason why he concealed it.</P>
<P>Many terrible accusations come in against Anglesy.</P>
<P>The Lord Halifax brought in a Bill for the speedy discovery and conviction of Papists, and ease of Nonconformists, but so contrived, that both parties are almost equally incensed against him for it. The house of Lords was on Thursday turned into a Committee, and, as I hear, will be so every day, to consider of it, and try whether it can be so mended, as to be useful un∣to the ends intended. I know not whether that can be done or no; but I could have wished, that intend∣ing
<PB N="165" REF="161"/>
to oblige above a Million of men, that go under the name of Noncon∣formists, he had been pleased to con∣sult with one of that number, con∣cerning the ways of doing it.</P>
<P>On Friday twenty-nine Lords and Commoners were invited by the Lord Mayor to his feast, and after dinner the Duke of Monmouth came to them. In his return he was accompanied by a great number of people, that ran to see him and Esquire Thinne. It was observed that having formerly had a Bar in his Arms upon his Coach, it was then wiped out.</P>
<P>October the 30th Dugdale did de∣clare unto the house of Commons, that Ewers the Jesuit told him, there
<PB N="166" REF="162"/>
had been a contest between the Duke of York and Coleman; he complain∣ing that the Duke put him upon bu∣sinesses that would bring him to be hanged, the Duke told him, he would secure his life, so he would hold his peace: Coleman answered, he could do so for the future; but he had al∣ready confessed so much unto his Friend Sir Edmond Godfrey, that it was in his Power to discover him and all his Busi∣ness; whereupon the Duke replied, that ought not to trouble him, for order should be taken to keep Godfrey from doing any hurt, which in a few days was performed by his death. Cann of Bristol, and Withins Steward of Westminster, are put out of the house of Commons for discountenancing and opposing Petitioning.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="163"/>
I believe To-morrow will be a great day in the house of Commons, in as much as it relates to the Duke; he is said to be arrived in Scotland, but no certain news is come of him, since he was seen off from Newcastle on Monday last. If the orders sent into Flanders from Spain concerning reprisals upon the Duke of Branden∣burgh by sea or land be executed (as is said) by sending two or three thousand Horse into the Pais de Cleves &amp; de Juliers, I look upon the peace as broken; for the French will cer∣tainly defend it, or do the like in Flanders.</P>

This would have been a convenience unto me; but my obligation unto you is the same, and I so far acknowledge it to be the greatest that I have in a long time received from any man, as not to value the leave you have ob∣tained for me to return into my coun∣try after so long an absence, at a lower
