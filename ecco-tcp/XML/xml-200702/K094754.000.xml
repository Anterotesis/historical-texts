<HEAD>THE CANDIDATE: BY Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN sly Jemmy Twitcher had smugg'd up his face</L>
<L>With a lick of court white-wash, and pious grimace,</L>
<L>A wooing he went, where three Sisters of old</L>
<L>In harmless society guttle and scold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord! Sister, says Physic to Law, I declare</L>
<L>Such a sheep-biting look, such a pick-pocket air,</L>
<L>Not I, for the Indies! you know I'm no prude;</L>
<L>But his nose is a shame, and his eyes are so lewd!</L>
<L>Then he shambles and straddles so oddly, I fear—</L>
<L>No; at our time of life, 'twould be silly, my dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I don't know, says Law, now methinks, for his look,</L>
<L>'Tis just like the picture in Rochester's book.</L>
<L>But his character, Phyzzy, his morals, his life;</L>
<L>When she died, I can't tell, but he once had a wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="9"/>
<L>They say he's no Christian, loves drinking and whoring,</L>
<L>And all the town rings of his swearing and roaring,</L>
<L>His lying, and filching, and Newgate-bird tricks:—</L>
<L>Not I,—for a coronet, chariot and six.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Divinity heard, between waking and dozing,</L>
<L>Her sisters denying, and Jemmy proposing;</L>
<L>From dinner she rose with her bumper in hand,</L>
<L>She stroked up her belly, and stroked down her band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What a pother is here about wenching and roaring!</L>
<L>Why David loved catches, and Solomon whoring.</L>
<L>Did not Israel filch from th' Aegyptians of old</L>
<L>Their jewels of silver, and jewels of gold?</L>
<L>The prophet of Bethel, we read, told a lie:</L>
<L>He drinks; so did Noah: he swears; so do I.</L>
<L>To refuse him for such peccadillos, were odd;</L>
<L>Besides, he repents, and he talks about G--.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Never hang down your head, you poor penitent elf!</L>
<L>Come, buss me, I'll be Mrs. Twitcher myself.</L>
<L>D--n ye both for a couple of Puritan bitches!</L>
<L>He's Christian enough, that repents, and that --------.</L>
