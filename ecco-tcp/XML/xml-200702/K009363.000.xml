<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y expectations in this small perform∣ance
may seem somewhat extraordi∣nary,
when I declare that my inten∣tions
are to render a larger work
more intelligible to ordinary capacities,
by abridging it. 'Tis however certain, that those
who are not accustomed to abstract reasoning, are apt
to lose the thread of argument, where it is drawn
out to a great length, and each part fortified with all
the arguments, guarded against all the objections,
and illustrated with all the views, which occur to
a writer in the diligent survey of his subject. Such
Readers will more readily apprehend a chain of rea∣soning,
that is more single and concise, where the
chief propositions only are linkt on to each other, il∣lustrated
by some simple examples, and confirmed by a
few of the more forcible arguments. The parts ly∣ing
nearer together can better be compared, and the
connexion be more easily traced from the first principles
to the last conclusion.</P>
<P>THE work, of which I here present the Rea∣der
with an abstract, has been complained of as ob∣scure
and difficult to be comprehended, and I am apt
to think, that this proceeded as much from the length
as from the abstractedness of the argument. If I
have remedy'd this inconvenience in any degree, I
have attain'd my end. The book seem'd to me to have
such an air of singularity, and novelty as claim'd the
<PB REF="3"/>
attention of the public; especially if it be found, as
the Author seems to insinuate, that were his philoso∣phy
receiv'd, we must alter from the foundation the
greatest part of the sciences. Such bold attempts are
always advantageous in the republic of letters, because
they shake off the yoke of authority, accustom men to
think for themselves, give new hints, which men of
genius may carry further, and by the very opposition,
illustrate points, wherein no one before suspected any
difficulty.</P>
<P>THE Author must be contented to wait with
patience for some time before the learned world can
agree in their sentiments of his performance. 'Tis his
misfortune, that he cannot make an <HI>appeal to the peo∣ple,</HI>
who in all matters of common reason and elo∣quence
are found so infallible a tribunal. He must be
judg'd by the FEW, whose verdict is more apt to be
corrupted by partiality and prejudice, especially as no
one is a proper judge in these subjects, who has not
often thought of them; and <HI>such</HI> are apt to form to
themselves systems of their own, which they resolve
not to relinquish. I hope the Author will excuse me
for intermeddling in this affair, since my aim is only
to encrease his auditory, by removing some difficulties,
which have kept many from apprehending his mean∣ing.</P>
<P>I have chosen one simple argument, which I have
carefully traced from the beginning to the end. This
is the only point I have taken care to finish. The rest
is only hints of particular passages, which seem'd to
me curious and remarkable.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ABSTRACT
OF
A BOOK lately PUBLISHED,
ENTITULED,
<HI>A Treatise of Human Nature,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS book seems to be wrote up∣on
the same plan with several
other works that have had a
great vogue of late years in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
The philosophical spirit, which has
been so much improved all over <HI>Europe</HI> with∣in
these last fourscore years, has been carried
to as great a length in this kingdom as in any
other. Our writers seem even to have start∣ed
a new kind of philosophy, which promi∣ses
more both to the entertainment and ad∣vantage
of mankind, than any other with
which the world has been yet acquainted.
Most of the philosophers of antiquity, who
treated of human nature, have shewn more
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
of a delicacy of sentiment, a just sense of
morals, or a greatness of soul, than a depth of
reasoning and reflection. They content them∣selves
with representing the common sense of
mankind in the strongest lights, and with the
best turn of thought and expression, without
following out steadily a chain of propositions, or
forming the several truths into a regular science.
But 'tis at least worth while to try if the sci∣ence
of <HI>man</HI> will not admit of the same accu∣racy
which several parts of natural philosophy
are found susceptible of. There seems to be all
the reason in the world to imagine that it may
be carried to the greatest degree of exactness.
If, in examining several phaenomena, we find
that they resolve themselves into one common
principle, and can trace this principle into
another, we shall at last arrive at those few
simple principles, on which all the rest de∣pend.
And tho' we can never arrive at the
ultimate principles, 'tis a satisfaction to go as
far as our faculties will allow us.</P>
<P>THIS seems to have been the aim of our
late philosophers, and, among the rest, of
this author. He proposes to anatomize hu∣man
nature in a regular manner, and promi∣ses
to draw no conclusions but where he is
authorized by experience. He talks with
contempt of hypotheses; and insinuates, that
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
such of our countrymen as have banished
them from moral philosophy, have done a
more signal service to the world, than <HI>my
Lord Bacon,</HI> whom he considers as the father
of experimental physicks. He mentions, on
this occasion, <HI>Mr. Locke, my Lord Shafts∣bury,
Dr. Mandeville, Mr. Hutchison, Dr.
Butler,</HI> who, tho' they differ in many points
among themselves, seem all to agree in found∣ing
their accurate disquisitions of human na∣ture
intirely upon experience.</P>
<P>BESIDE the satisfaction of being acquaint∣ed
with what most nearly concerns us, it
may be safely affirmed, that almost all the
sciences are comprehended in the science of
human nature, and are dependent on it. <HI>The
sole end of</HI> logic <HI>is to explain the principles and
Operations of our reasoning faculty, and the
nature of our ideas;</HI> morals and criticism <HI>re∣gard
our tastes and sentiments; and</HI> politics
<HI>consider men as united in society, and dependent
on each other.</HI> This treatise therefore of hu∣man
nature seems intended for a system of the
sciences. The author has finished what re∣gard
logic, and has laid the foundation of the
other parts in his account of the passions.</P>
<P>THE celebrated <HI>Monsieur Leibnitz</HI> has ob∣served
it to be a defect in the common sy∣stems
of logic, that they are very copious
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
when they explain the operations of the un∣derstanding
in the forming of demonstra∣tions,
but are too concise when they treat of
probabilities, and those other measures of evi∣dence
on which life and action intirely de∣pend,
and which are our guides even in most
of our philosophical speculations. In this
censure, he comprehends <HI>the essay on human
understanding, le recherche de la verité,</HI> and
<HI>l'art de penser.</HI> The author of the <HI>treatise of
human nature</HI> seems to have been sensible of
this defect in these philosophers, and has en∣deavoured,
as much as he can, to supply it.
As his book contains a great number of spe∣culations
very new and remarkable, it will be
impossible to give the reader a just notion of
the whole. We shall therefore chiefly con∣fine
ourselves to his explication of our reason∣ings
from cause and effect. If we can make
this intelligible to the reader, it may serve as
a specimen of the whole.</P>
<P>OUR author begins with some definitions.
He calls a <HI>perception</HI> whatever can be present
to the mind, whether we employ our senses,
or are actuated with passion, or exercise our
thought and reflection. He divides our per∣ceptions
into two kinds, <HI>viz. impressions</HI> and
<HI>ideas.</HI> When we feel a passion or emotion
of any kind, or have the images of exter∣nal
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
objects conveyed by our senses; the per∣ception
of the mind is what he calls an <HI>im∣pression,</HI>
which is a word that he employs in
a new sense. When we reflect on a passion
or an object which is not present, this per∣ception
is an <HI>idea. Impressions,</HI> therefore, are
our lively and strong perceptions; <HI>ideas</HI> are
the fainter and weaker. This distinction is
evident; as evident as that betwixt feeling
and thinking.</P>
<P>THE first proposition he advances, is, that
all our ideas, or weak perceptions, are de∣rived
from our impressions, or strong percep∣tions,
and that we can never think of any
thing which we have not seen without us,
or felt in our own minds. This proposition
seems to be equivalent to that which Mr.
<HI>Locke</HI> has taken such pains to establish, <HI>viz.
that no ideas are innate.</HI> Only it may be ob∣served,
as an inaccuracy of that famous phi∣losopher,
that he comprehends all our per∣ceptions
under the term of idea, in which
sense it is false, that we have no innate ideas.
For it is evident our stronger perceptions or
impressions are innate, and that natural af∣fection,
love of virtue, resentment, and all
the other passions, arise immediately from na∣ture.
I am perswaded, whoever would take
the question in this light, would be easily a∣ble
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
to reconcile all parties. <HI>Father Male∣branche</HI>
would find himself at a loss to point
out any thought of the mind, which did not
represent something antecedently felt by it,
either internally, or by means of the external
senses, and must allow, that however we
may compound, and mix, and augment, and
diminish our ideas, they are all derived from
these sources. <HI>Mr. Locke,</HI> on the other
hand, would readily acknowledge, that all
our passions are a kind of natural instincts, de∣rived
from nothing but the original constitu∣tion
of the human mind.</P>
<P>OUR author thinks, <Q REND="inline">"that no discovery
could have been made more happily for de∣ciding
all controversies concerning ideas than
this, that impressions always take the pre∣cedency
of them, and that every idea with
which the imagination is furnished, first
makes its appearance in a correspondent
impression. These latter perceptions are
all so clear and evident, that they admit
of no controversy; tho' many of our ide∣as
are so obscure, that 'tis almost impossi∣ble
even for the mind, which forms them,
to tell exactly their nature and composi∣tion."</Q>
Accordingly, wherever any idea
is ambiguous, he has always recourse to
the impression, which must render it clear
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and precise. And when he suspects that any
philosophical term has no idea annexed to it
(as is too common) he always asks <HI>from what
impression that idea is derived?</HI> And if no im∣pression
can be produced, he concludes that
the term is altogether insignificant. 'Tis after
this manner he examines our idea of <HI>substance</HI>
and <HI>essence;</HI> and it were to be wished, that
this rigorous method were more practised in
all philosophical debates.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that all reasonings concerning
<HI>matter of fact</HI> are founded on the relation of
cause and effect, and that we can never infer
the existence of one object from another,
unless they be connected together, either
mediately or immediately. In order there∣fore
to understand these reasonings, we must
be perfectly acquainted with the idea of a
cause; and in order to that, must look about
us to find something that is the cause of a∣nother.</P>
<P>HERE is a billiard-ball lying on the ta∣ble,
and another ball moving towards it with
rapidity. They strike; and the ball, which
was formerly at rest, now acquires a mo∣tion.
This is as perfect an instance of the
relation of cause and effect as any which we
know, either by sensation or reflection. Let
us therefore examine it. 'Tis evident, that
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the two balls touched one another before
the motion was communicated, and that
there was no interval betwixt the shock and
the motion. <HI>Contiguity</HI> in time and place is
therefore a requisite circumstance to the ope∣ration
of all causes. 'Tis evident likewise,
that the motion, which was the cause, is
prior to the motion, which was the effect.
<HI>Priority</HI> in time, is therefore another requi∣site
circumstance in every cause. But this is
not all. Let us try any other balls of the
same kind in a like situation, and we shall al∣ways
find, that the impulse of the one pro∣duces
motion in the other. Here therefore
is a <HI>third</HI> circumstance, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a <HI>con∣stant
conjunction</HI> betwixt the cause and effect.
Every object like the cause, produces always
some object like the effect. Beyond these
three circumstances of contiguity, priority,
and constant conjunction, I can discover no∣thing
in this cause. The first ball is in mo∣tion;
touches the second; immediately the
second is in motion: and when I try the ex∣periment
with the same or like balls, in the
same or like circumstances, I find, that up∣on
the motion and touch of the one ball,
motion always follows in the other. In what∣ever
shape I turn this matter, and however I
examine it, I can find nothing farther.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
THIS is the case when both the cause and
effect are present to the senses. Let us now
see upon what our inference is founded, when
we conclude from the one that the other has
existed or will exist. Suppose I see a ball
moving in a streight line towards another, I
immediately conclude, that they will shock,
and that the second will be in motion. This
is the inference from cause to effect; and of
this nature are all our reasonings in the con∣duct
of life: on his is founded all our belief
in history: and from hence is derived all phi∣losophy,
excepting only geometry and arith∣metic.
If we can explain the inference from
the shock of two balls, we shall be able to
account for this operation of the mind in all
instances.</P>
<P>WERE a man, such as <HI>Adam,</HI> created in the
full vigour of understanding, without expe∣rience,
he would never be able to infer mo∣tion
in the second ball from the motion and
impulse of the first. It is not any thing that
reason sees in the cause, which make us <HI>infer</HI>
the effect. Such an inference, were it possi∣ble,
would amount to a demonstration, as
being founded merely on the comparison of
ideas. But no inference from cause to effect
amounts to a demonstration. Of which there
is this evident proof. The mind can always
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<HI>conceive</HI> any effect to follow from any cause,
and indeed any event to follow upon another:
whatever we <HI>conceive</HI> is possible, at least in a
metaphysical sense: but wherever a demon∣stration
takes place, the contrary is impossi∣ble,
and implies a contradiction. There is
no demonstration, therefore, for any con∣junction
of cause and effect. And this is a
principle, which is generally allowed by phi∣losophers.</P>
<P>IT would have been necessary, therefore,
for <HI>Adam</HI> (if he was not inspired) to have
had <HI>experience</HI> of the effect, which followed
upon the impulse of these two balls. He
must have seen, in several instances, that
when the one ball struck upon the other, the
second always acquired motion. If he had
seen a sufficient number of instances of this
kind, whenever he saw the one ball moving
towards the other, he would always conclude
without hesitation, that the second would
acquire motion. His understanding would
anticipate his sight, and form a conclusion
suitable to his past experience.</P>
<P>IT follows, then, that all reasonings con∣cerning
cause and effect, are founded on ex∣perience,
and that all reasonings from expe∣rience
are founded on the supposition, that
the course of nature will continue uniformly
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
the same. We conclude, that like causes,
in like circumstances, will always produce
like effects. It may now be worth while to
consider, what determines us to form a con∣clusion
of such infinite consequence.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that <HI>Adam</HI> with all his sci∣ence,
would never have been able to <HI>demon∣strate,</HI>
that the course of nature must con∣tinue
uniformly the same, and that the future
must be conformable to the past. What is
possible can never be demonstrated to be false;
and 'tis possible the course of nature may
change, since we can conceive such a change.
Nay, I will go farther, and assert, that he
could not so much as prove by any <HI>probable</HI>
arguments, that the future must be conform∣able
to the past. All probable arguments are
built on the supposition, that there is this
conformity betwixt the future and the past,
and therefore can never prove it. This con∣formity
is a <HI>matter of fact,</HI> and if it must
be proved, will admit of no proof but from
experience. But our experience in the past
can be a proof of nothing for the future, but
upon a supposition, that there is a resemblance
betwixt them. This therefore is a point,
which can admit of no proof at all, and which
we take for granted without any proof.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
WE are determined by CUSTOM alone to
suppose the future conformable to the past.
When I see a billiard-ball moving towards
another, my mind is immediately carry'd by
habit to the usual effect, and anticipates my
sight by conceiving the second ball in motion.
There is nothing in these objects, abstractly
considered, and independent of experience,
which leads me to form any such conclusion:
and even after I have had experience of many
repeated effects of this kind, there is no argu∣ment,
which determines me to suppose, that
the effect will be conformable to past expe∣rience.
The powers, by which bodies ope∣rate,
are entirely unknown. We perceive
only their sensible qualities: and what <HI>reason</HI>
have we to think, that the same powers will
always be conjoined with the same sensible
qualities?</P>
<P>'TIS not, therefore, reason, which is the
guide of life, but custom. That alone de∣termines
the mind, in all instances, to suppose
the future conformable to the past. How∣ever
easy this step may seem, reason would
never, to all eternity, be able to make it.</P>
<P>THIS is a very curious discovery, but leads
us to others, that are still more curious. <HI>When
I see a billiard ball moving towards another, my
mind is immediately carried by habit to the usual</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>and anticipate my sight by conceiving the second
ball in motion.</HI> But is this all? Do I nothing
but CONCEIVE the motion of the second ball?
No surely. I also BELIEVE that it will move.
What then is this <HI>belief?</HI> And how does it
differ from the simple conception of any
thing? Here is a new question unthought of
by philosophers.</P>
<P>When a demonstration convinces me of
any proposition, it not only makes me con∣ceive
the proposition, but also makes me
sensible, that 'tis impossible to conceive any
thing contrary. What is demonstratively false
implies a contradiction; and what implies a
contradiction cannot be conceived. But with
regard to any matter of fact, however strong
the proof may be from experience, I can al∣ways
conceive the contrary, tho' I cannot al∣ways
believe it. The belief, therefore, makes
some difference betwixt the conception to
which we assent, and that to which we do
not assent.</P>
<P>To account for this, there are only two
hypotheses. It may be said, that belief joins
some new idea to those which we may con∣ceive
without assenting to them. But this
hypothesis is false. For <HI>first,</HI> no such idea can
be produced. When we simply conceive an
object, we conceive it in all its parts. We
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
conceive it as it might exist, tho' we do not
believe it to exist. Our belief of it would
discover no new qualities. We may paint out
the entire object in imagination without be∣lieving
it. We may set it, in a manner, be∣fore
our eyes, with every circumstance of
time and place. 'Tis the very object conceiv∣ed
as it might exist; and when we believe
it, we can do no more.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE mind has a faculty of join∣ing
all ideas together, which involve not a
contradiction; and therefore if belief consist∣ed
in some idea, which we add to the simple
conception, it would be in a man's power,
by adding this idea to it, to believe any thing,
which he can conceive.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore belief implies a concep∣tion,
and yet is something more; and since
it adds no new idea to the conception; it fol∣lows,
that it is a different MANNER of con∣ceiving
an object; <HI>something</HI> that is distinguish∣able
to the feeling, and depends not upon our
will, as all our ideas do. My mind runs by
habit from the visible object of one ball mov∣ing
towards another, to the usual effect of mo∣tion
in the second ball. It not only conceives
that motion, but <HI>feels</HI> something different in
the conception of it from a mere reverie of the
imagination. The presence of this visible
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
object, and the constant conjunction of that
particular effect, render the idea different to
the <HI>feeling</HI> from those loose ideas, which come
into the mind without any introduction.
This conclusion seems a little surprizing;
but we are led into it by a chain of proposi∣tions,
which admit of no doubt. To ease
the reader's memory I shall briefly resume
them. No matter of fact can be proved but
from its cause or its effect. Nothing can be
known to be the cause of another but by ex∣perience.
We can give no reason for extend∣ing
to the future our experience in the past;
but are entirely determined by custom, when
we conceive an effect to follow from its usual
cause. But we also believe an effect to fol∣low,
as well as conceive it. This belief joins
no new idea to the conception. It only
varies the manner of conceiving, and makes
a difference to the feeling or sentiment. Be∣lief,
therefore, in all matters of fact arises
only from custom, and is an idea conceived
in a peculiar <HI>manner.</HI></P>
<P>OUR author proceeds to explain the man∣ner
or feeling, which renders belief different
from a loose conception. He seems sensible,
that 'tis impossible by words to describe this
feeling, which every one must be conscious
of in his own breast. He calls it sometimes
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
a <HI>stronger</HI> conception, sometimes a more <HI>lively,</HI>
a more <HI>vivid,</HI> a <HI>firmer,</HI> or a more <HI>intense</HI> con∣ception.
And indeed, whatever name we
may give to this feeling, which constitutes
belief, our author thinks it evident, that it
has a more forcible effect on the mind than
fiction and mere conception. This he proves
by its influence on the passions and on the
imagination; which are only moved by truth
or what is taken for such. Poetry, with all
its art, can never cause a passion, like one in
real life. It fails in the original conception
of its objects, which never <HI>feel</HI> in the same
manner as those which command our belief
and opinion.</P>
<P>OUR author presuming, that he had suffi∣ciently
proved, that the ideas we assent to are
different to the feeling from the other ideas,
and that this feeling is more firm and lively
than our common conception, endeavours in
the next place to explain the cause of this
lively feeling by an analogy with other acts of
the mind. His reasoning seems to be curious;
but could scarce be rendered intelligible, or at
least probable to the reader, without a long
detail, which would exceed the compass I
have prescribed to myself.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
I have likewise omitted many arguments,
which he adduces to prove that belief con∣sists
merely in a peculiar feeling or sentiment.
I shall only mention one; our past experience
is not always uniform. Sometimes one ef∣fect
follows from a cause, sometimes ano∣ther:
In which case we always believe, that
that will exist which is most common. I
see a billiard-ball moving towards another.
I cannot distinguish whether it moves upon
its axis, or was struck so as to skim along the
table. In the first case, I know it will not
stop after the shock. In the second it may
stop. The first is most common, and there∣fore
I lay my account with that effect. But
I also conceive the other effect, and conceive
it as possible, and as connected with the
cause. Were not the one conception diffe∣rent
in the feeling or sentiment from the o∣ther,
there would be no difference betwixt
them.</P>
<P>WE have confin'd ourselves in this whole
reasoning to the relation of cause and effect,
as discovered in the motions and operations of
matter. But the same reasoning extends to
the operations of the mind. Whether we
consider the influence of the will in moving
our body, or in governing our thought, it
may safely be affirmed, that we could never
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
foretel the effect, merely from the considera∣tion
of the cause, without experience. And
even after we have experience of these effects,
'tis custom alone, not reason, which deter∣mines
us to make it the standard of our fu∣ture
judgments. When the cause is pre∣sented,
the mind, from habit, immediately
passes to the conception and belief of the usual
effect. This belief is something different
from the conception. It does not, however,
join any new idea to it. It only makes it be
felt differently, and renders it stronger and
more lively.</P>
<P>HAVING dispatcht this material point con∣cerning
the nature of the inference from
cause and effect, our author returns upon
his footsteps, and examines anew the idea of
that relation. In the considering of motion
communicated from one ball to another, we
could find nothing but contiguity, priority in
the cause, and constant conjunction. But,
beside these circumstances, 'tis commonly
suppos'd, that there is a necessary connexion
betwixt the cause and effect, and that the
cause possesses something, which we call a
<HI>power,</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>energy.</HI> The question is,
what idea is annex'd to these terms? If all
our ideas or thoughts be derived from our
impressions, this power must either discover
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
itself to our senses, or to our internal feeling.
But so little does any <HI>power</HI> discover itself to
the senses in the operations of matter, that
the <HI>Cartesians</HI> have made no scruple to assert,
that matter is utterly deprived of energy, and
that all its operations are perform'd merely
by the energy of the supreme Being. But the
question still recurs, <HI>What idea have we of
energy or power even in the supreme Being?</HI>
All our idea of a Deity (according to those
who deny innate ideas) is nothing but a com∣position
of those ideas, which we acquire from
reflecting on the operations of our own minds.
Now our own minds afford us no more notion
of energy than matter does. When we consider
our will or volition a <HI>priori,</HI> abstracting from
experience, we should never be able to infer
any effect from it. And when we take the
assistance of experience, it only shows us ob∣jects
contiguous, successive, and constantly
conjoined. Upon the whole, then, either
we have no idea at all of force and energy,
and these words are altogether insignificant,
or they can mean nothing but that determi∣nation
of the thought, acquir'd by habit, to
pass from the cause to its usual effect. But
who-ever would thoroughly understand this
must consult the author himself. 'Tis suffi∣cient,
if I can make the learned world ap∣prehend,
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
that there is some difficulty in the
case, and that who-ever solves the difficulty
must say some thing very new and extraordi∣nary;
as new as the difficulty itself.</P>
<P>BY all that has been said the reader
will easily perceive, that the philosophy con∣tain'd
in this book is very sceptical, and tends
to give us a notion of the imperfections and
narrow limits of human understanding. Al∣most
all reasoning is there reduced to experi∣ence;
and the belief, which attends experi∣ence,
is explained to be nothing but a peculiar
sentiment, or lively conception produced by
habit. Nor is this all, when we believe any
thing of <HI>external</HI> existence, or suppose an ob∣ject
to exist a moment after it is no longer
perceived, this belief is nothing but a senti∣ment
of the same kind. Our author in∣sists
upon several other sceptical topics; and
upon the whole concludes, that we assent to
our faculties, and employ our reason only
because we cannot help it. Philosophy wou'd
render us entirely <HI>Pyrrhonian,</HI> were not nature
too strong for it.</P>
<P>I shall conclude the logics of this author
with an account of two opinions, which seem
to be peculiar to himself, as indeed are most
of his opinions. He asserts, that the soul,
as far as we can conceive it, is nothing but a
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
system or train of different perceptions, those
of heat and cold, love and anger, thoughts
and sensations; all united together, but with∣out
any perfect simplicity or identity. <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> maintained that thought was the es∣sence
of the mind; not this thought or that
thought, but thought in general. This seems to
be absolutely unintelligible, since every thing,
that exists, is particular: And therefore it
must be our several particular perceptions,
that compose the mind. I say, <HI>compose</HI> the
mind, not <HI>belong</HI> to it. The mind is not a
substance, in which the perceptions inhere.
That notion is as unintelligible as the <HI>Carte∣sian,</HI>
that thought or perception in general is
the essence of the mind. We have no idea
of substance of any kind, since we have no
idea but what is derived from some impressi∣on,
and we have no impression of any sub∣stance
either material or spiritual. We know
nothing but particular qualities and percepti∣ons.
As our idea of any body, a peach, for
instance, is only that of a particular taste, co∣lour,
figure, size, consistence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So our
idea of any mind is only that of particular
perceptions, without the notion of any thing
we call substance, either simple or compound.</P>
<P>THE second principle, which I proposed
to take notice of, is with regard to Geome∣try.
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Having denied the infinite divisibility of
extension, our author finds himself obliged to
refute those mathematical arguments, which
have been adduced for it; and these indeed
are the only ones of any weight. This he
does by denying Geometry to be a science ex∣act
enough to admit of conclusions so subtile
as those which regard infinite divisibility.
His arguments may be thus explained. All
Geometry is founded on the notions of equa∣lity
and inequality, and therefore according
as we have or have not an exact standard of
that relation, the science itself will or will
not admit of great exactness. Now there is
an exact standard of equality, if we suppose
that quantity is composed of indivisible points.
Two lines are equal when the numbers of
the points, that compose them, are equal,
and when there is a point in one correspond∣ing
to a point in the other. But tho' this
standard be exact, 'tis useless; since we can
never compute the number of points in any
line. It is besides founded on the suppo∣sition
of finite divisibility, and therefore can
never afford any conclusion against it. If we
reject this standard of equality, we have
none that has any pretensions to exactness. I
find two that are commonly made use of.
Two lines above a yard, for instance, are
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
said to be equal, when they contain any infe∣rior
quantity, as an inch, an equal number
of times. But this runs in a circle. For
the quantity we call an inch in the one is sup∣posed
to be <HI>equal</HI> to what we call an inch in
the other: And the question still is, by what
standard we proceed when we judge
them to be equal; or, in other words, what
we mean when we say they are equal. If
we take still inferior quantities, we go on <HI>in
infinitum.</HI> This therefore is no standard of
equality. The greatest part of philosophers,
when ask'd what they mean by equality,
say, that the word admits of no definition,
and that it is sufficient to place before us two
equal bodies, such as two diameters of a cir∣cle,
to make us understand that term. Now
this is taking the <HI>general appearance</HI> of the ob∣jects
for the standard of that proportion, and
renders our imagination and senses the ulti∣mate
judges of it. But such a standard ad∣mits
of no exactness, and can never afford
any conclusion contrary to the imagination
and senses. Whether this question be just or
not, must be left to the learned world to
judge. 'Twere certainly to be wish'd, that
some expedient were fallen upon to reconcile
philosophy and common sense, which with re∣gard
to the question of infinite divisibility
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
have wag'd most cruel wars with each o∣ther.</P>
<P>WE must now proceed to give some ac∣count
of the second volume of this work,
which treats of the PASSIONS. 'Tis of more
easy comprehension than the first; but con∣tains
opinions, that are altogether as new and
extraordinary. The author begins with <HI>Pride</HI>
and <HI>humility.</HI> He observes, that the objects
which excite these passions, are very nume∣rous,
and seemingly very different from each
other. Pride or self-esteem may arise from
the qualities of the mind; wit, good-sense,
learning, courage, integrity: from those of
the body; beauty, strength, agility, good
mein, address in dancing, riding, fencing:
from external advantages; country, family,
children, relations, riches, houses, gardens,
horses, dogs, cloaths. He afterwards pro∣ceeds
to find out that common circumstance,
in which all these objects agree, and which
causes them to operate on the passions. His
theory likewise extends to love and hatred,
and other affections. As these questions, tho'
curious, could not be rendered intelligible
without a long discourse, we shall here omit
them.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be more acceptable to
the reader to be informed of what our author
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
says concerning <HI>free-will.</HI> He has laid the
foundation of his doctrine in what he said
concerning cause and effect, as above explain∣ed.
<Q REND="inline">" 'Tis universally acknowledged, that
the operations of external bodies are neces∣sary,
and that in the communication of
their motion, in their attraction and mutual
cohesion, there are not the least traces of
indifference or liberty."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Whatever
therefore is in this respect on the same
footing with matter, must be acknowledged
to be necessary. That we may know
whether this be the case with the actions of
the mind, we may examine matter, and
consider on what the idea of a necessity
in its operations are founded, and why we
conclude one body or action to be the in∣fallible
cause of another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It has been observed already, that in no
single instance the ultimate connexion of
any object is discoverable either by our
senses or reason, and that we can never pe∣netrate
so far into the essence and construc∣tion
of bodies, as to perceive the principle
on which their mutual influence is found∣ed.
'Tis their constant union alone, with
which we are acquainted; and 'tis from
the constant union the necessity arises, when
the mind is determined to pass from one
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
object to its usual attendant, and infer the
existence of one from that of the other.
Here then are two particulars, which we
are to regard as essential to <HI>necessity, viz.</HI>
the constant <HI>union</HI> and the <HI>inference</HI> of the
mind, and wherever we discover these we
must acknowledge a necessity."</Q> Now
nothing is more evident than the constant
union of particular actions with particular
motives. If all actions be not constantly
united with their proper motives, this uncer∣tainty
is no more than what may be observed
every day in the actions of matter, where by
reason of the mixture and uncertainty of cau∣ses,
the effect is often variable and uncertain.
Thirty grains of opium will kill any man that
is not accustomed to it; tho' thirty grains of
rhubarb will not always purge him. In like
manner the fear of death will always make
a man go twenty paces out of his road; tho'
it will not always make him do a bad action.</P>
<P>AND as there is often a constant conjunction
of the actions of the will with their motives,
so the inference from the one to the other is
often as certain as any reasoning concerning
bodies: and there is always an inference pro∣portioned
to the constancy of the conjunction.
On this is founded our belief in witnesses, our
credit in history, and indeed all kinds of mo∣ral
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
evidence, and almost the whole conduct of
life.</P>
<P>OUR author pretends, that this reasoning
puts the whole controversy in a new light, by
giving a new definition of necessity. And,
indeed, the most zealous advocates for free∣will
must allow this union and inference with
regard to human actions. They will only de∣ny,
that this makes the whole of necessity.
But then they must shew, that we have an
idea of something else in the actions of mat∣ter;
which, according to the foregoing rea∣soning,
is impossible.</P>
<P>THRO' this whole book, there are great
pretensions to new discoveries in philosophy;
but if any thing can intitle the author to so
glorious a name as that of an <HI>inventor,</HI> 'tis
the use he makes of the principle of the as∣sociation
of ideas, which enters into most of
his philosophy. Our imagination has a great
authority over our ideas; and there are no ideas
that are different from each other, which it
cannot separate, and join, and compose into
all the varieties of fiction. But notwith∣standing
the empire of the imagination, there
is a secret tie or union among particular ideas,
which causes the mind to conjoin them more
frequently together, and makes the one, upon
its appearance, introduce the other. Hence
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
arises what we call the <HI>apropos</HI> of discourse:
hence the connection of writing: and hence
that thread, or chain of thought, which a
man naturally supports even in the loosest
<HI>reverie.</HI> These principles of association are
reduced to three, <HI>viz. Resemblance;</HI> a pic∣ture
naturally makes us think of the man it
was drawn for. <HI>Contiguity;</HI> when <HI>St. Den∣nis</HI>
is mentioned, the idea of <HI>Paris</HI> naturally
occurs. <HI>Causation;</HI> when we think of the
son, we are apt to carry our attention to the
father. 'Twill be easy to conceive of what
vast consequence these principles must be in
the science of human nature, if we consider,
that so far as regards the mind, these are the
only links that bind the parts of the universe
together, or connect us with any person or
object exterior to ourselves. For as it is by
means of thought only that any thing ope∣rates
upon our passions, and as these are the
only ties of our thoughts, they are really <HI>to
us</HI> the cement of the universe, and all the
operations of the mind must, in a great mea∣sure,
depend on them.</P>
