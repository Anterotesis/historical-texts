<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Fraud</HI> made use of by <HI>Insolvents</HI> to bring themselves within the Reach of the Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> with some Limitations; humbly offered to be con∣sidered of, in order (not to prevent an Act of Favour to real <HI>Insolvents,</HI> but) to prevent the Abuse of it by im∣proper Objects.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is no wonder, if after so many Pe∣titions from the several Prisons almost over the whole Kingdom, and such horrid <HI>Cruelties</HI> and Inhumanities, as appears to have been practised by some Jai∣lors, especially by the <HI>Warden of the Fleet</HI> and his <HI>Agents,</HI> upon several unfortunate Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands; I say, 'tis no wonder if a Bill for Relief of Prisoners is become very popular.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>By how much the ill Usage of the Priso∣ners, who are thus abused by the <HI>Keepers of Prisons,</HI> shocks the tender and charitable Part in every Man's Breast; by so much the Case of the <HI>Prisoners,</HI> even of those who have not been used ill, prevails upon the <HI>Publick</HI> in favour of the GRACE desir'd.</P>
<P>Nor shall one Word be said, or one Thought suggested, in this Tract in Preju∣dice of the <HI>Charitable</HI> Intention of the House, or any way to lessen the good and generous Disposition of any Person whatever, whether in the Legislature, or out of it, to∣wards promoting so good a Work.</P>
<P><HI>Far less</HI> shall I take one Step, or speak one Word, that so much as looks like a Plea for the <HI>Cruelty</HI> and Inhumanity of <HI>Jaylors</HI> and Prison-keepers; their Conduct in most, if not in all the Jails in <HI>England,</HI> calls aloud for a like Inspection of Authority and for Justice upon the Persons, as well as a severe Censure of the Practises of the Delinquents, in order to have that rigid, tho' necessary Part of the Law, call'd <HI>Imprisonment for Debt,</HI> be executed with <HI>Humanity</HI> and with Equity, according to the natural Rights of the Unfortunate, as Men; and according to
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
their <HI>legal</HI> Rights as <HI>Englishmen,</HI> which it is evident has not been observ'd hitherto.</P>
<P>And to conclude this Part; <HI>least of all</HI> shall I say one Word here in behalf of the Persons at this time detected openly in the <HI>Cruelties,</HI> Inhumanities and Extortions, which they have practis'd upon the unhap∣py Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands: I do not see they merit the least <HI>Favour</HI> from their Country; they have acted a <HI>dreadful Part,</HI> and they are in Hands, which I doubt not will have more <HI>Mercy</HI> than they have shewn to the Miserable, who have been under their Power; and tho' I shall not, on the other hand, prompt or push their <HI>Misfortune,</HI> yet this I may say without any Prejudice or Injury to them, that I hope they shall have such Justice, as will effectually disable them, and warn all others (of that <HI>rough</HI> Employment) from the <HI>like</HI> Practices.</P>
<P>Having laid down these <HI>Postulata,</HI> in or∣der to prevent any prejudging my Design in this Work, or raising a <HI>popular</HI> Clamour, as if it was intended to lessen the intended <HI>Grace</HI> of the Government or Legislature, and to prevent the <HI>Deliverance</HI> of Prisoners; I shall with the more freedom lay down some Dif∣ficulties,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
which, as they occur to me on this Occasion, shall be worth the Consideration of the Legislature, not to lye as <HI>Obstructions</HI> in the way of the intended Bill, as a Reason <HI>sine qua non,</HI> but that the Parliament, taking them into their Hands, and <HI>approving</HI> or <HI>disapproving</HI> them, as they shall appear <HI>im∣portant,</HI> may find out such <HI>proper Remedies</HI> as to their great Wisdom shall seem meet.</P>
<P>Having thus, as I hope, remov'd the Prejudices which might lye against my pre∣sent Design, I must also speak a Word or two, very briefly, to remove if possible a popular Objection (at least as it is used in the Mouths of some who are more particu∣cularly concern'd in that part) namely, that it is <HI>unchristian</HI> and inhuman, and inconsist∣ent with a <HI>generous</HI> Nation abhorring Cruel∣ty, as <HI>England</HI> professes to be, to confine poor miserable People in <HI>Prison</HI> for Debt, especially such as have nothing to pay.</P>
<P>As to the latter Part, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>confining</HI> People in Prison who have <HI>nothing</HI> to pay, I come readily into that part, and in doing so I confirm what I have said above, that I am not writing in order to intercept the in∣tended <HI>Grace</HI> of the Parliament to the <HI>Un∣fortunate.</HI> The honest Debtor willing to
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
pay, but <HI>unable</HI>; and willing to pay as far as he is <HI>able,</HI> and ready to give all reasona∣ble Satisfaction, such as the Parliament may direct, that he is so unable, is certainly an <HI>Object</HI> recommending it self to the <HI>Charity</HI> and Compassion of the whole Nation; and whatever intervenes by the Fraud of others, these, and these only, are allow'd to be the Persons for whom the <HI>Parliamentary Grace</HI> which has been settled, and extended in so many Acts of Parliament already pass'd, has been <HI>intended.</HI></P>
<P>That very great Numbers of <HI>Fraudulent,</HI> unqualify'd, wicked, and dishonest People have formerly receiv'd the Benefit of the like <HI>Grace</HI> by the Help of <HI>false Oaths,</HI> unjust Pre∣tences, Connivance of Jailors, Bribery and Corruption of many kinds, has been loudly complain'd of, and I doubt is much easier to prove than to prevent; and not being wil∣ling, as I have said, to be any ways a Hin∣drance to the Relief of the <HI>honest</HI> and real Objects of <HI>Grace,</HI> who are indeed within the Intention of the Act, I cover all that Part with saying, Better <HI>Ten</HI> dishonest Debtors <HI>escape,</HI> than that <HI>one</HI> real Object of the in∣tended <HI>Good</HI> should <HI>perish.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>Yet I humbly propose it, as a Thing worthy the Consideration of the <HI>British Par∣liament,</HI> whether it is any Way probable, that there can be such a Number of miser∣able Insolvents in one Year, and that of but the <HI>lowest</HI> Class too; namely, not owing above 100<HI>l.</HI> to any one Person, and all act∣ually Prisoners, as have presented themselves yearly to the Magistrates, to be discharged by the <HI>Grace</HI> of Parliament, for these seve∣ral Years past?</P>
<P>If it is true, as common <HI>Fame</HI> says it is, that notwithstanding there was an Act for Delivering such <HI>Prisoners</HI> but <HI>two</HI> Years past, there are at this Time near ninety Thou∣sand such <HI>Insolvents,</HI> now on the Books of the several <HI>Jails</HI> in this Kingdom; I say, if this is <HI>true,</HI> is it rational to believe, that these are all really and fairly Prisoners, with∣in the Intent and Meaning of the <HI>intended Grace.</HI></P>
<P>It would be a noble Undertaking, and in my Opinion well worth the House of Com∣mons, tho' it took up a good Part of a <HI>Session,</HI> to find out some effectual Means to <HI>separate between the Sheep and the Goats,</HI> (speaking of that Allusion with due Regard) in this Case; and to discover, expose, and
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
punish the <HI>Frauds</HI> which are put upon the NATION in this Affair.</P>
<P>It is true, the People are despicable; I mean, the <HI>Guilty</HI>; the Debts they lye for not large, at least not to particular Men, and some may suggest that it is not worth Notice; but I reply, the Number is great, surprizingly great, and the Injury to Trade is very <HI>considerable,</HI> nor is the Matter small among <HI>Tradesmen,</HI> tho' the Debts (as above) are not singly large. For as many of these <HI>Insolvents</HI> frequently fall within the Compass of one and the same Shopkeeper, it very of∣ten falls heavy; and as these <HI>fraudulent</HI> Debtors boldly run into Mens Books, with a Dependance upon such <HI>Acts of Grace,</HI> and with an evident Design to cheat and defraud their Creditors, and this <HI>several</HI> Times over, such People are, I think, very far from be∣ing Debtors who deserve Compassion, or within the Intent and Meaning of the <HI>Par∣liamentary</HI> Grace.</P>
<P>Likewise they are greatly injurious to Trade in general, as they <HI>ruin innocent</HI> Tradesmen by their Knavery; many Trades∣men having had thirty to fifty such Insolvents discharged by <HI>one Act,</HI> tho' they were never
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
put in Prison, or so much ar arrested at their Suit, or for any Part of their Debt.</P>
<P>The usual <HI>Practice</HI> of these People has been to run themselves into the <HI>Tradesmens Books,</HI> as it is called, in as many particular and different Places as possible; always tak∣ing Care that it be for small Sums, within the usual Restraint of the <HI>Acts of Grace</HI>; and then when the expected <HI>Favour</HI> is in Prospect, get themselves arrested, and put in Prison, or turn'd over by <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> so to be within the Reach of the Law, and then all the other <HI>Creditors,</HI> who have never offered them the <HI>least</HI> Violence, are paid with a SUMMONS.</P>
<P>Others by <HI>Corruption</HI> of Jailors, and by <HI>Bribery,</HI> have obtained those Jailors to own them as <HI>Prisoners in Custody,</HI> tho' not <HI>really</HI> so, for a certain antedated Time, so as to be brought within the Reach of the Act.</P>
<P>What <HI>Perjury,</HI> what <HI>Forgery,</HI> what foul Things are practised under this Head, de∣serves the Inspection of the like Authority as lately detected the <HI>Frauds</HI> of the <HI>Fleet-prison</HI>; a Committee, who are above the Reach of <HI>Fraud</HI> or <HI>Corruption</HI> themselves, and fully qualified to search those <HI>Deeds of</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<HI>Darkness</HI> to the Bottom; indeed it seems to be reserv'd to a House of Commons, and to them only.</P>
<P>It was the Saying of a known and judi∣cious Writer, that no Man ought to com∣plain in Print of any publick Grievance, un∣less at the same Time he proposed also the Remedies; I shall take the Hint, and offer something to the Purpose in this Case, that I may dismiss it as I go:<LIST>
<ITEM>I. It would go a great Way towards pre∣venting this Mischief, if it was provided in the <HI>Act,</HI> that no <HI>Insolvent</HI> should claim the Benefit <HI>twice</HI> over; it having been frequent to have them take <HI>new Credit,</HI> after their having been once <HI>discharged,</HI> seeking out new Places of Abode, and new Creditors, who, upon a Variety of Pretences, they insinuate themselves so far into, as to get Credit with them, their former Circumstances not being known.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That none should claim the Benefit of such an <HI>Act,</HI> who had <HI>run</HI> from their <HI>Bail,</HI> made <HI>Escapes</HI> from Officers or Prison-keepers upon their Parole, or that had committed any notorious <HI>Fraud</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
punishable by Law, or that had obtain∣ed Credit upon Promise and express Conditions (before two or more Wit∣nesses who shall attest the same) not to claim or take the Benefit of any such <HI>Act of Grace.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That none should claim such <HI>Benefit</HI> who shall conceal any of their Goods and Effects from their Creditors, not∣withstanding their having made Affi∣davit as the Law directs, as in the Case of a Bankrupt.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These Proviso's, together with a <HI>New Method</HI> to be taken, to limit and restrain the <HI>Prison-keepers,</HI> to prevent their keeping Pri∣soners on their Books after they have been <HI>discharged, antedating</HI> their Commitments, and giving <HI>fraudulent</HI> Certificates of their being <HI>Prisoners,</HI> when really they were not; I say these Methods, and such as these, un∣der the farther Direction and Improvement of the Legislature, I perswade myself would go a great way to prevent the Abuse of <HI>Par∣liamentary Grace,</HI> and to make the future <HI>Acts for Relief of Insolvents</HI> effectually and truly, merciful and good, and the honest <HI>poor</HI> Prisoner, nobody repining at his Relief, would be deliver'd; the <HI>knavish</HI> designing
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
Debtor remaining, <HI>as he ought to do,</HI> where the Law directs.</P>
<P>This leads me to enter a little into the Question so much insisted on by some, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>no Man should be put in Prison for Debt.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that this <HI>Doctrine</HI> has many Advocates, and some have pushed it so far, as to think the contrary Opinion <HI>cruel</HI> and unchristian; but I shall enquire more parti∣cularly into it in the next Part.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I take this Occasion to repeat again what I hinted at before, name∣ly, that this is so far from <HI>impeaching</HI> the common Charity, and the Compassion of the <HI>British</HI> Nation to Prisoners, that it prompts and recommends it by the meer Nature of the Thing; for when I argue against the Knavery of the Debtor, in mak∣ing himself a <HI>voluntary</HI> Prisoner, on purpose to defraud and delude his <HI>Creditors,</HI> it natu∣rally follows that the Prisons should be pur∣ged from all such voluntary, fraudulent Peo∣ple, and those that remain would be the more real and unexceptionable Objects of the National <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>When the Prisoners were all really <HI>Insol∣vent,</HI> really miserable, and that without any room to charge either <HI>them,</HI> or the <HI>Jailers</HI> and <HI>Keepers</HI> with corrupt Practices, abusing the publick Mercy, and the like, the Parlia∣ment would always be the more ready to pass Acts for their Relief, as they should see Cause, so that this Proposal is evidently cal∣culated to encourage and prompt the Mercy of the <HI>Publick</HI> to <HI>Insolvents,</HI> by removing all the just <HI>Objections</HI> which now lie in the way, and have so often obstructed it.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Necessity of Preserving to the Creditor the Right of arresting and im∣prisoning the <HI>Person</HI> of his Debtor; and how the Petty Credit given in all Retail Trade, and which is essential to the Support of our whole <HI>Commerce,</HI> depends upon it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Believe it will not be called <HI>begging the Question</HI> to lay it down as a <HI>Foundation,</HI> That as there is a greater Trade carried on in <HI>England</HI> than in any other Nation in <HI>Europe</HI>; so there is a larger Personal Credit given in Trade here than in any other Nation, not in <HI>Europe</HI> only, but in the whole World.</P>
<P>There are so many <HI>Evidences</HI> of the first, and so many Authors have written on that Subject, that I need only refer my Reader to them; and the last is evident to every
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
MERCHANT now in Trade, who sees with the least Observation what Difference there is between the way of Trading here, and the like way of Trading in <HI>Foreign</HI> Coun∣tries, and between the Credit given in ei∣ther.</P>
<P>Some would make it a Question, <HI>tho' I think it is no Question,</HI> whether the Great∣ness of our Trade is the Cause of giving this <HI>large Credit,</HI> or that the giving this large Credit is the Cause of the <HI>Greatness of our Trade.</HI></P>
<P>I say there is no room to debate this Part; the latter is evident to Demonstration, name∣ly, that the giving such large Credit is the true Spring of the Greatness of our Trade: This appears by comparing the Bulk of the Trade in this Kingdom with the Bulk of our <HI>Current Stock</HI> in Trade. If no <HI>Credit</HI> was given, the Trade could not go beyond the <HI>Stock</HI>; it is true, it might go beyond the Current Coin, because some Trade may be carry'd on by Barter, or exchanging one kind of Goods for another, without the In∣terposition of any <HI>Medium</HI> (which is Money) But no Trade can go beyond the <HI>Stock</HI> with∣out <HI>Credit,</HI> because one Value must always be deliver'd for another, and they must be
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
always equal too, otherwise the Exchange is not equal, nor the Payment compleat.</P>
<P>But in Credit the Case is quite different; for here the Seller delivers his Goods (which are a <HI>real Value</HI>) to the Buyer on his Note for Payment, or perhaps on his Verbal Promise, either of which, is an <HI>imaginary Value</HI> only; in a Word, the <HI>Fame</HI> or Reputation of a Buyer is put into the <HI>Scale of Commerce</HI> with the <HI>real</HI> Value and Substance of the Seller, and the one is deliver'd for the other: the Account in the Tradesman's Ledger stands as a Register of the Case; the Buyer stands Debtor on one side for the Value of the Goods sold and deliver'd to him against an open <HI>Blank</HI> on the contrary side, to be fill'd up to his <HI>Creditor</HI> when he pays the Mo∣ney.</P>
<P>By this strange thing call'd <HI>Credit,</HI> all the mighty Wonders of an exalted Commerce are perform'd; a Tradesman beginning with a Thousand Pound Cash, and a good Cha∣racter, shall store his Shop or Warehouse with 5000<HI>l.</HI> in Goods, and may trade for 10000, nay for 20000<HI>l. per Annum</HI>; and so long as he manages <HI>prudently,</HI> pays cur∣rently, and keeps up his Reputation, shall run almost what Length he pleases in his
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Trade, so much greater a Stroke in Trade does his <HI>Character</HI> furnish to him, than his <HI>Cash.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Foot of this very Article call'd <HI>Credit,</HI> as a private Man may trade for 10000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> with but 1000<HI>l.</HI> Stock, so if the Stock of the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be, as some insist, Ten Millions, the Trade may actually return a Hundred Millions of Pounds Sterling in a Year; an <HI>immense</HI> Sum, but not at all <HI>improbable</HI> to be true, and per∣haps within Compass too.</P>
<P>But to bring it down to the Subject: Take the Credit given in smaller Articles; I mean, in <HI>retailing</HI> Goods to the <HI>last</HI> Consumer: This is what I call <HI>petty Credit,</HI> and is the particular thing which fills our Jails with <HI>In∣solvent</HI> Prisoners. Even this <HI>petty Credit</HI> is, though small in the particular, immensely great in the general; and tho' it does not <HI>encrease</HI> the Stock of the Retailer, it certain∣ly does <HI>encrease</HI> his Trade, and causes him to sell a great deal more Goods than otherwise he would find Customers for.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Wholesale</HI> Dealer trusts or gives Credit to the <HI>Retailer,</HI> and thereby encreases <HI>his Stock</HI> (for Credit in Trade is Stock in
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
Trade) the <HI>Retailer</HI> gives Credit to the <HI>Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umer,</HI> and thereby increases <HI>his Sale.</HI></P>
<P>Now upon what Foundation is all this Credit given? The <HI>Retailer,</HI> being a <HI>Wool∣len-Draper,</HI> trusts his Neighbour with a Suit of Clothes; how comes he to do it? per∣haps the Man has no extraordinary Chara∣cter; well but, says the <HI>Retailer,</HI> he is a Tradesman as well as I, and he must pay me, or he shall not be able to stand at his Shop Door, or sit behind his <HI>Counter,</HI> for I will <HI>arrest</HI> him and make him pay me; and upon this <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Arresting the Debtor,</HI> and carrying him to <HI>Prison,</HI> or whether he is carry'd to <HI>Prison</HI> or no, the exposing him, disgracing him, and ruining his Credit; I say, upon this is founded the Freedom of the Tradesman to trust him.</P>
<P>If you destroy this Power of <HI>Coercion,</HI> you destroy the <HI>Credit in Trade</HI>; for if the Man cannot be <HI>credited,</HI> he cannot <HI>buy</HI>; and if the Tradesman cannot <HI>arrest</HI> him, he will not sell.</P>
<P>This particular Case merits to be <HI>very well observ'd</HI>; and there is more Weight in it than perhaps appears at first View.<LIST>
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
<ITEM>1. I say if the Buyer cannot be trusted, he cannot buy, <HI>that is to say,</HI> he can∣not buy at that time; he will make shift for a while, will wear his old Clothes longer, go without such or such <HI>fine things</HI> for himself, or Wife, or Children, and abate in his Expence, because he has not Money to buy, and the Shop-keeper will not trust him.
<P>Even the <HI>Drunkard</HI> will abate his Liquor, if the <HI>Alehouse</HI> or <HI>Tavern∣keeper</HI> will not admit him to score; abundance of <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> as well in <HI>Food</HI> as <HI>fine things,</HI> must abate for want of ready Money; whereas Men will venture to buy if they have Credit with the Tradesman.</P>
<P>To say, let Luxury and Extrava∣gance <HI>abate,</HI> it will perhaps reform the Town, is to say nothing; for the <HI>Que∣stion</HI> does not lye that way: It is not whether the Luxury will abate, but will our <HI>Trade</HI> abate or not; if the <HI>Trade abates,</HI> as it certainly will, my Argument is good.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="19" REF="22"/>2. On the other hand, if the <HI>Buyer</HI> can∣not <HI>buy,</HI> the <HI>Seller</HI> cannot <HI>sell</HI>; then his Stock lyes dead on his Hands, the Money for it, and for which perhaps he has been trusted himself, grows due, and he cannot pay; he had bet∣ter sell, and give some <HI>Credit</HI>; but he is afraid to do that, because if his Debtor refuses to pay, he cannot force him to it. In short, he must <HI>trust,</HI> or <HI>shut</HI> up Shop, and <HI>break</HI>; and thus if a LAW should be made to pre∣vent <HI>arresting</HI> the <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>Debtor,</HI> you at once destroy <HI>Perso∣nal Credit</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> the Tradesmen.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I remember an Attempt ignorantly made, (as it appear'd afterwards) even by the <HI>Tradesmen</HI> themselves, to destroy this <HI>Petty Credit:</HI> The Shop-keepers mightily af∣fected to write over their Shop-Doors, No TRUST BY RETAIL. But the Consequence soon appear'd, to the opening their Under∣standings; for <HI>Thousands</HI> of Buyers, who laid out their Money freely, and who, tho' they might not always pay down upon the <HI>Spot,</HI> yet paid tolerably well, went from their Shops, and bought where they knew they could be <HI>trusted.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23"/>In a Word, any LAW which abates <HI>Petty Credit,</HI> or Trust by Retail, will be fatal to TRADE, and would give such a <HI>Blow</HI> to our Commerce in general, as it would be impossible for all our Heads put together to retrieve.</P>
<P>Therefore if we will support <HI>Trade,</HI> we must encourage <HI>Petty Credit</HI>; and if you will support <HI>Petty Credit,</HI> you must not take away the <HI>Security</HI> to the <HI>Creditor</HI>; the Security of the Tradesman's trusting his Neighbour is the Power he has by Law to <HI>enforce</HI> his Payment, and of arresting and imprisoning the Debtor if he fails or refu∣ses: The Law is the Tradesman's <HI>Secu∣rity,</HI> and if you take away the <HI>Law,</HI> which is his <HI>Security,</HI> you take away his Trade.</P>
<P>What is the Reason why in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in other Countries, they have so <HI>little</HI> Trade? 'tis because you cannot <HI>enforce</HI> your Demand of Debt, you can't send the Debtor to Prison; and therefore no Man <HI>buys</HI> till he has <HI>Money</HI> to pay; if you will imprison the Debtor, you must allow him a Main∣tenance, or he will come out before your Face.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24"/>It may be true, that there is some <HI>Humanity</HI> in such a Law, but I cannot say there is any <HI>Policy</HI> in it; for it overthrows <HI>personal</HI> Cre∣dit, and that in effect sinks Trade, lessens the <HI>Consumption</HI> of Goods, and <HI>ruins</HI> the Tradesmen themselves: I cannot but think it were much better to have an <HI>Act of Mer∣cy</HI> every Year, to release poor Insolvents upon reasonable Conditions, than not have it in the Tradesman's Power to <HI>imprison</HI> them when they do not pay; for this <HI>Mercy</HI> will not be so prejudicial to the <HI>particular</HI> Creditors, as the other would be to the <HI>gene∣ral</HI> Credit.</P>
<P>It is our Business to <HI>increase</HI> our Trade to the utmost by all lawful Methods; nay, wise Men in Commerce tell us, some Errors, even in Morality, had better be wink'd at, than the Trade be ruin'd, or than any <HI>general</HI> Head of Trade be impair'd; the Meaning is, that, in some Cases, even our Luxury or High-living, <HI>I do not mean our Drunkenness and Vice,</HI> is so essential to our Trade, that it were better <HI>continued,</HI> than be entirely <HI>sup∣pressed,</HI> the Trade would suffer so much.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, a Set of <HI>Sumptuary</HI> Laws, as they are called, to reform our Ex∣travagancies in Equipages and Dress, House-Furniture
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
and Diet, would effectually <HI>ruin</HI> our Commerce, starve and leave unemploy'd our <HI>Poor,</HI> and reduce the whole Nation to a most deplorable Condition of Misery and Distress.</P>
<P><HI>It would be the like,</HI> in Case of a Stop to <HI>Credit,</HI> for it would be an Abatement of the Consumption in all Sorts of Goods, as well our Manufactures and Home Product, as our importation from abroad; for as the last Con∣sumer is the Life of all, if Credit abates, he abates his Expence, and buys less; conse∣quently Trade declines, and less is consumed. By Credit here, <HI>that I may explain Things as I go,</HI> I must be understood to mean not <HI>pub∣lick</HI> Credit, I have nothing to do with that Part here; but <HI>personal</HI> Credit, the <HI>ordinary</HI> Credit given by one Tradesman to another, as well in <HI>wholesale</HI> Dealing and Merchandi∣zing, as in Retailing from the Shopkeeper to his Neighbours and Customers, and indeed chiefly the <HI>last</HI>; for on that does the Whole∣sale Part depend.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation I build the Conse∣quences which I insist upon, as above; this <HI>Trust by Retail,</HI> this <HI>petty</HI> Credit entirely de∣pends upon the Right which every Citizen, thus selling his Goods to his Neighbour <HI>upon</HI>

<HI>his Word,</HI> that is, upon his <HI>personal</HI> Credit, has by <HI>Law to sue, arrest, imprison,</HI> and <HI>keep in Prison his Debtor,</HI> if he delays or refuses to pay the Money when it is due.</P>
<P>If you take away this <HI>Right,</HI> you take away the <HI>Credit</HI>; for no Man will sell his Goods upon a <HI>Faith</HI> which the Debtor is not obli∣ged to <HI>keep.</HI></P>
<P>It is a great Mistake to say, <HI>personal</HI> Cre∣dit is given upon the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> of the Debtor; the case is quite otherwise, the <HI>Credit</HI> is given to the <HI>Law</HI>; 'tis my being able to prosecute the Debtor in a Course of Law, and <HI>(as we call it)</HI> make him pay me, that encourages me to trust him; and there∣fore 'tis the ordinary Enquiry of a Tradesman, when he would <HI>inform</HI> himself about a Man he deals with, not whether he be <HI>honest,</HI> but whether he is <HI>able</HI>; if you tell him he is a <HI>Knave,</HI> and won't pay any body if he can help it, <HI>O,</HI> says the <HI>Tradesman, I don't value that; I am willing to get off the Goods, and if he is</HI> able, <HI>I'll venture; for I know how to make him willing.</HI></P>
<P>Nor does any Part of this Discourse, to repeat it again, tend in the least to prevent our <HI>Tenderness</HI> to any of these <HI>Debtors</HI> who
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
are thus <HI>imprison'd,</HI> if by Disasters, Losses, Misfortunes, or any visible Accident they are render'd really poor and unable, but that such should always be reliev'd; and if the Creditor be <HI>cruel</HI> and inexorable, as some perhaps will always be, the Parliament will, on all just Occasions, <HI>of which also they are the proper Judges,</HI> deliver such Insolvents by <HI>Acts of Clemency and Grace,</HI> as they do <HI>now,</HI> and no Christian Tradesman can, I think, re∣pine at their commiserating and relieving <HI>unfortunate,</HI> tho' otherwise <HI>honest Insolvents.</HI></P>
