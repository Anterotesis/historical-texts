<HEAD>Sally of our Alley.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OF all the girls in our town</L>
<L>There's none like pretty Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling of my heart;</L>
<L>And lives in our alley:</L>
<L>There's ne'er a lady in the land</L>
<L>Is half so sweet as Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling of my heart,</L>
<L>And lives in our alley.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her father he makes cabbage nets,</L>
<L>And in the streets does cry them,</L>
<L>Her mother she sells laces long,</L>
<L>To all who chuse to buy them;</L>
<L>But sure such folks could ne'er beget</L>
<L>So sweet a girl as Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Sally's by I leave my work,</L>
<L>I love her so sincerely,</L>
<L>My master comes like any Turk,</L>
<L>And bangs me most severely,</L>
<L>But let him bang his belly full,</L>
<L>I'll bear it all for Sally, she is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the days that's in the week,</L>
<L>I dearly love but one day,</L>
<L>And that's the day that comes between</L>
<L>A Saturday and Monday:</L>
<L>O then I'm drest in all my best,</L>
<L>To walk abroad with Sally, she is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My master carries me to church,</L>
<L>And often I am blamed,</L>
<L>Because I leave him in the lurch,</L>
<L>As soon as text is named:</L>
<L>I leave the church in sermon time,</L>
<L>And slink away to Sally, she is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Christmas comes about again,</L>
<L>O then I shall have money,</L>
<L>I'll hoard it up, and box and all,</L>
<L>I'll give it to my Sally,</L>
<L>And would it were a thousand pounds,</L>
<L>I'd give it all to Sally, she is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My master and the neighbours all</L>
<L>Make game of me and Sally,</L>
<L>And but for her I'd better be</L>
<L>A slave, and row a galley;</L>
<L>But when my seven long years are out,</L>
<L>O then I'll marry Sally,</L>
<L>O then we'll wed, and then we'll bed,</L>
<L>But not in our alley.</L>
