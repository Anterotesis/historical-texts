<HEAD>DEDICATION. To DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was ask'd to whom I should dedicate these volumes, I carelessly answered to no one—Why not? (replied the person who put the question to me.) Because most dedications
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
look like begging a protection to the book. Perhaps a worse interpretation may be given to it. No, no! already so much obliged, I cannot, will not, put another tax upon the generosity of any friend of Mr. Sterne's, or mine. I went home to my lodgings, and gratitude warmed my heart to such a pitch, that I vow'd they should be dedicated to the man my father so much ad∣mired—who, with an unpre∣judiced eye, read, and approved
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
his works, and moreover loved the man—'Tis to Mr. Garrick then, that I dedicate these Ge∣nuine Letters.</P>
<P>Can I forget the sweet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 11.</NOTE> Epi∣taph which proved Mr. Garrick's friendship, and opinion of him? 'Twas a tribute to friendship—and as a tribute of my gra∣titude I dedicate these volumes to a man of understanding and
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
feelings—Receive this, as it is meant—May you, dear Sir, approve of these letters, as much as Mr. Sterne admired you—but Mr. Garrick, with all his ur∣banity, can never carry the point half so far, for Mr. Sterne was an enthusiast, if it is possible to be one, in favour of Mr. Garrick.</P>
<P>This may appear a very sim∣ple dedication, but Mr. Garrick will judge by his own sensi∣bility,
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
that I can feel more than I can express, and I believe he will give me credit for all my grateful acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I am, with every sentiment of gratitude, and esteem,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN publishing these Letters the Editor does but comply with her mother's request, which was, that if any letters were publish'd under Mr. Sterne's name, that those she had in her possession, (as well as those that her father's friends would be kind enough to send to her) should be likewise publish'd—She depends much
<PB N="xiv" REF="12"/>
on the candour of the public for the favourable reception of these,—their being genuine (she thinks—and hopes) will render them not unacceptable—She has already experienced much bene∣volence and generosity from her late father's friends—the re∣memberance of it will ever warm her heart with gratitude!</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE AND FAMILY OF THE LATE Rev. Mr. LAURENCE STERNE.</HEAD>
<P>ROGER STERNE, (grand∣son to Archbishop Sterne) Lieutenant in Hand aside's regi∣ment, was married to Agnes He∣bert, widow of a captain of a good family: her family name was
<PB N="2" REF="20"/>
(I believe) Nuttle—though, upon recollection, that was the name of her father-in-law, who was a noted sutler in Flanders, in Queen Ann's wars, where my father married his wife's daugh∣ter (N. B. he was in debt to him) which was in September 25, 1711, Old Stile.—This Nuttle had a son by my grand∣mother—a fine person of a man but a graceless whelp—what be∣came of him I know not.—The family (if any left), live now at Clomwel in the south of Ire∣land,
<PB N="3" REF="21"/>
at which town I was born November 24th, 1713, a few days after my mother arrived from Dunkirk.—My birth-day was ominous to my poor father, who was, the day after our ar∣rival, with many other brave officers broke, and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two children—the elder of which was Mary; she was born in Lisle in French Flanders, July the tenth, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, New Stile.—This child was most un∣fortunate—she
<PB N="4" REF="22"/>
married one Wee∣mans in Dublin—who used her most unmercifully—spent his substance, became a bankrupt, and left my poor sister to shift for herself,—which she was able to do but for a few months, for she went to a friend's house in the country, and died of a broken heart. She was a most beautiful woman—of a fine figure, and deserved a better fate.—The regiment, in which my father served, being broke, he left Ireland as soon as I was able to
<PB N="5" REF="23"/>
be carried, with the rest of his family, and came to the family seat at Elvington, near York, where his mother lived. She was daughter to Sir Roger Jaques, and an heiress. There we so∣journed for about ten months, when the regiment was esta∣blished, and our houshold de∣camped with bag and baggage for Dublin—within a month of our arrival, my father left us, being ordered to Exeter, where, in a sad winter, my mother and her two children followed him, travelling from
<PB N="6" REF="24"/>
Liverpool by land to Plymouth. (Melancholy description of this journey not necessary to be trans∣mitted here). In twelve months we were all sent back to Dublin.—My mother, with three of us, (for she laid in at Plymouth of a boy, Joram), took ship at Bristol, for Ireland, and had a narrow escape from being cast away by a leak springing up in the vessel.—At length, after many perils, and struggles, we got to Dublin.—There my father took a large house, furnished it, and in a
<PB N="7" REF="25"/>
year and a half's time spent a great deal of money.—In the year one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, all unhing'd again; the regiment was ordered, with many others, to the Isle of Wight, in order to embark for Spain in the Vigo expedition. We accompanied the regiment, and was driven into Milford Haven, but landed at Bristol, from thence by land to Ply∣mouth again, and to the Isle of Wight—where I remember we stayed encamped some time be∣fore
<PB N="8" REF="26"/>
the embarkation of the troops—(in this expedition from Bristol to Hampshire we lost poor Joram—a pretty boy, four years old, of the small-pox), my mother, sister, and myself, re∣mained at the Isle of Wight dur∣ing the Vigo Expedition, and until the regiment had got back to Wicklow in Ireland, from whence my father sent for us.—We had poor Joram's loss sup∣plied during our stay in the Isle of Wight, by the birth of a girl, Anne, born September the
<PB N="9" REF="27"/>
twenty-third, one thousand se∣ven hundred and nineteen.—This pretty blossom fell at the age of three years, in the Bar∣racks of Dublin—she was, as I well remember, of a fine deli∣cate frame, not made to last long, as were most of my father's babes.—We embarked for Dub∣lin, and had all been cast away by a most violent storm; but through the intercessions of my mother, the captain was prevailed upon to turn back into Wales, where we stayed a month, and at length
<PB N="10" REF="28"/>
got into Dublin, and travelled by land to Wicklow, where my father had for some Weeks given us over for lost.—We lived in the barracks at Wicklow, one year, (one thousand seven hun∣dred and twenty) when Devije∣her (so called after Colonel De∣vijeher,) was born; from thence we decamped to stay half a year with Mr. Fetherston, a clergy∣man, about seven miles from Wicklow, who being a relation of my mother's, invited us to his parsonage at Animo.—It was
<PB N="11" REF="29"/>
in this parish, during our stay, that I had that wonderful escape in falling through a mill-race whilst the mill was going, and of being taken up unhurt—the story is incredible, but known for truth in all that part of Ire∣land—where hundreds of the common people flocked to see me.—From hence we followed the regiment to Dublin, where we lay in the barracks a year.—In this year, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-one, I learned to write, &amp;c.—The regiment,
<PB N="12" REF="30"/>
ordered in twenty-two, to Car∣rickfergus in the north of Ire∣land; we all decamped, but got no further than Drogheda, thence ordered to Mullengar, forty miles west, where by Providence we stumbled upon a kind rela∣tion, a collateral descendant from Archbishop Sterne, who took us all to his castle and kindly en∣treated us for a year—and sent us to the regiment at Car∣rickfergus, loaded with kind∣nesses, &amp;c.—a most rueful and tedious journey had we all, in
<PB N="13" REF="31"/>
March, to Carrickfergus, where we arrived in six or seven days—little Devijeher here died, he was three years old—He had been left behind at nurse at a farm∣house near Wicklow, but was fetch'd to us by my father the summer after—another child sent to fill his place, Susan; this babe too left us behind in this weary journey—The autumn of that year, or the spring afterwards, (I forget which) my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at school—which he did near Hali∣fax,
<PB N="14" REF="32"/>
with an able master; with whom I staid some time, 'till by God's care of me my cousin Sterne, of Elvington, became a father to me, and sent me to the university, &amp;c. &amp;c. To pursue the thread of our story, my fa∣ther's regiment was the year after ordered to Londonderry, where another sister was brought forth, Catherine, still living, but most un∣happily estranged from me by my uncle's wickedness, and her own folly—from this station the regi∣ment was sent to defend Gibraltar,
<PB N="15" REF="33"/>
at the seige, where my father was run through the body by Captain Phillips, in a duel, (the quarrel begun about a goose) with much difficulty he survived—tho' with an impaired constitution, which was not able to withstand the hardships it was put to—for he was sent to Jamaica, where he soon fell by the country fever, which took away his senses first, and made a child of him, and then, in a month or two, walking about continually without complaining, till the
<PB N="16" REF="34"/>
moment he sat down in an arm chair, and breathed his last—which was at Port Antonio, on the north of the island.—My father was a little smart man—active to the last degree, in all exercises—most patient of fatigue and disappointments, of which it pleased God to give him full measure—he was in his temper somewhat rapid, and hasty—but of a kindly, sweet disposition, void of all design; and so inno∣cent in his own intentions, that he suspected no one; so that
<PB N="17" REF="35"/>
you might have cheated him ten times in a day, if nine had not been sufficient for your purpose—my poor father died in March 1731—I remained at Halifax 'till about the latter end of that year, and cannot omit mention∣ing this anecdote of myself, and school-master—He had had the cieling of the school-room new white-washed—the ladder re∣mained there—I one unlucky day mounted it, and wrote with a brush in large capital letters, LAU. STERNE, for which the
<PB N="18" REF="36"/>
usher severely whipped me. My master was very much hurt at this, and said, before me, that never should that name be ef∣faced, for I was a boy of genius, and he was sure I should come to preferment—this expression made me forget the stripes I had received—In the year thirty-two my cousin sent me to the univer∣sity, where I staid some time. 'Twas there that I commenced a friendship with Mr. H... which has been most lasting on both sides—I then came to York,
<PB N="19" REF="37"/>
and my uncle got me the living of Sutton—and at York I be∣come acquainted with your mo∣ther, and courted her for two years—she owned she liked me, but thought herself not rich enough, or me too poor, to be joined together—she went to her sister's in S—, and I wrote to her often—I believe then she was partly determined to have me, but would not say so—at her return she fell into a con∣sumption—and one evening that I was sitting by her with an al∣most
<PB N="20" REF="38"/>
broken heart to see her so ill, she said, <Q REND="inline">"my dear Lawrey, I can never be yours, for I verily believe I have not long to live—but I have left you every shilling of my fortune;"</Q>—upon that she shewed me her will—this genero∣sity overpowered me.—It pleased God that she recovered, and I married her in the year 1741. My uncle and myself were then upon very good terms, for he soon got me the Prebendary of York—but he quarrelled with me afterwards, because I would
<PB N="21" REF="39"/>
not write paragraphs in the news∣papers—though he was a party∣man, I was not, and detested such dirty work: thinking it beneath me—from that period, he be∣came my bitterest enemy.—By my wife's means I got the living of Stillington—a friend of her's in the south had promised her, that if she married a clergyman in Yorkshire, when the living became vacant, he would make her a compliment of it. I re∣mained near twenty years at Sut∣ton, doing duty at both places—
<PB N="22" REF="40"/>
I had then very good health.—Books, painting, fiddling, and shooting were my amusements; as to the 'Squire of the parish, I cannot say we were upon a very friendly footing—but at Stilling∣ton, the family of the C—s shewed us every kindness—'twas most truly agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family, who were ever cordial friends—In the year 1760, I took a house at York for your mother and yourself, and went up to London to publish my two first
<PB N="23" REF="41"/>
volumes of Shandy. In that year Lord F— presented me with the curacy of Coxwold—a sweet retirement in comparison of Sut∣ton. In sixty-two I went to France before the peace was con∣cluded, and you both followed me.—I left you both in France, and in two years after I went to Italy for the recovery of my health—and when I called upon you, I tried to engage your mo∣ther to return to England, with me—she and yourself are at length come—and I have had the inex∣pressible
<PB N="24" REF="42"/>
joy of seeing my girl every thing I wished her.</P>

<P>YOU bid me tell you, my dear L. how I bore your departure for S—, and whether the valley where D'Estella stands retains still its looks—or, if I think the roses or jessamines smell as sweet, as when you left it—Alas! every thing has now lost its relish, and look! The hour you left D'Estella I took to my bed.—I was worn out with fevers of all kinds, but most by that fever of the heart with which thou knowest well I have been wasting
<PB N="32" REF="49"/>
these two years—and shall continue wasting 'till you quit S—. The good Miss S—, from the forebodings of the best of hearts, thinking I was ill, insisted upon my going to her.—What can be the cause, my dear L. that I never have been able to see the face of this mutual friend, but I feel my∣self rent to pieces? She made me stay an hour with her, and in that short space I burst into tears a dozen differ∣ent times—and in such affectionate gusts of passion that she was con∣strained to leave the room, and sym∣pathize in her dressing room—I have been weeping for you both, said she, in a tone of the sweetest pity—for
<PB N="33" REF="50"/>
poor L's heart I have long known it—her anguish is as sharp as yours—her heart as tender—her constancy as great—her virtues as heroic—Heaven brought you not together to be tor∣mented. I could only answer her with a kind look, and a heavy sigh—and return'd home to your lodgings (which I have hired 'till your return) to resign myself to misery—Fanny had prepared me a supper—she is all at∣tention to me—but I sat over it with tears; a bitter sauce, my L. but I could eat it with no other—for the moment she began to spread my little table, my heart fainted within me.—One solitary plate, one knife, one
<PB N="34" REF="51"/>
fork, one glass!—I gave a thousand pensive, penetrating looks at the chair thou hadst so often graced, in those quiet, and sentimental repasts—then laid down my knife, and fork, and took out my handkerchief, and clapped it across my face, and wept like a child.—I do so this very moment, my L. for as I take up my pen my poor pulse quickens, my pale face glows, and tears are trickling down upon the paper, as I trace the word L—. O thou! blessed in thyself, and in thy virtues—blessed to all that know thee—to me most so, because more do I know of thee than all thy sex.—This is the philtre, my L. by which thou

hast charmed me, and by which thou wilt hold me thine whilst virtue and faith hold this world together.—This, my friend, is the plain and simple magick by which I told Miss — I have won a place in that heart of thine, on which I depend so satisfied, that time, or distance, or change of every thing which might alarm the hearts of little men, create no uneasy suspence in mine—Wast thou to stay in S— these seven years, thy friend, though he would grieve, scorns to doubt, or to be doubted—'tis the only exception where security is not the parent of danger.—I told you poor Fanny was all attention to me since

to-day, to-morrow shall be marked with some deed of beneficence.—The Libertine says, let me enjoy this week in forbidden and luxurious pleasures, and the next I will dedicate to serious thought and reflection.—The Gamester says, let me have one more chance with the dice and I will never touch them more.—The Knave of every profession wishes to obtain but inde∣pendency, and he will become an honest man.—The Female Coquette triumphs in tormenting her inamorato, for fear, after marriage, he should not pity her.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="57"/>Thy apparition of the fifth instant, (for letters may almost be called so) proved more welcome as I did not expect it. Oh! my L—, thou art kind indeed to make an apology for me, and thou never wilt assuredly repent of one act of kindness—for being thy debtor, I will pay thee with interest.—Why does my L. complain of the desertion of friends?—Where does the human being live that will not join in this complaint?—It is a common observation, and perhaps too true, that married people seldom extend their regards beyond their own fire∣side.—There is such a thing as parsi∣mony in esteem, as well as money—
<PB N="41" REF="58"/>
yet as the one costs nothing, it might be bestowed with more liberality.—We cannot gather grapes from thorns, so we must not expect kind attach∣ments from persons who are wholly folded up in selfish schemes.—I do not know whether I most despise, or pity such characters—nature never made an unkind creature—ill usage, and bad habits, have deformed a fair and lovely creation.</P>
<P>My L!—thou art surrounded by all the melancholy gloom of winter; wert thou alone, the retirement would be agreeable.—Disappointed ambition might envy such a retreat, and disap∣pointed
<PB N="42" REF="59"/>
love would seek it out.—Crouded towns, and busy societies, may delight the unthinking, and the gay—but solitude is the best nurse of wisdom.—Methinks I see my con∣templative girl now in the garden, watching the gradual approaches of spring.—Do'st not thou mark with delight the first vernal buds? the snow-drop, and primrose, these early and welcome visitors, spring beneath thy feet.—Flora and Pomona already consider thee as their handmaid; and in a little time will load thee with their sweetest blessing.—The feathered race are all thy own, and with them, untaught harmony will soon begin to
<PB N="43" REF="60"/>
cheer thy morning and evening walks.—Sweet as this may be, return—re∣turn—the birds of Yorkshire will tune their pipes, and sing as melodiously as those of Staffordshire.</P>

<P>I HAVE offended her whom I so tenderly love!—what could tempt me to it! but if a beggar was to knock at thy gate, wouldst thou not open the door and be melted with compas∣sion.—I know thou wouldst, for Pity has erected a temple in thy bosom.—Sweetest, and best of all human pas∣sions! let thy web of tenderness cover the pensive form of affliction, and soften the darkest shades of misery! I have re-considered this apology, and, alas!

<P>I have lost a very valuable friend by a sad accident, and what is worse, he has left a widow and five young children to lament this sudden stroke.—If real usefulness and integrity of heart, could have secured him from this, his friends would not now be mourning his untimely fate.—These dark and seemingly cruel dispensations of Provi∣dence, often make the best of human hearts complain.—Who can paint the distress of an affectionate mother,

made a widow in a moment, weeping in bitterness over a numerous, helpless, and fatherless offspring?—God! these are thy chastisements, and require (hard task!) a pious acquiescence.</P>

nearly over.—At sixty years of age the tenement gets fast out of repair, and the lodger with anxiety thinks of a discharge.—In such a situation the poet might well say<Q>"The soul uneasy, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>My L. talks of leaving the country—may a kind angel guide thy steps hither.—Solitude at length grows tire∣some.—Thou sayest thou wilt quit the place with regret—I think so too.—Does not something uneasy mingle with the very reflection of leaving it? It is like parting with an old friend, whose temper and company one has long been acquainted with.—I think
<PB N="48" REF="65"/>
I see you looking twenty times a day at the house—almost counting every brick and pane of glass, and telling them at the same time with a sigh, you are going to leave them.—Oh happy modification of matter! they will remain insensible of thy loss.—But how wilt thou be able to part with thy garden?—The recollection of so many pleasing walks must have endeared it to you. The trees, the shrubs, the flowers, which thou reared with thy own hands—will they not droop and fade away sooner upon thy departure.—Who will be the successor to nurse them in thy absence.—Thou wilt leave thy name upon the myrtle∣tree.—If

trees, and shrubs, and flow∣ers, could compose an elegy, I should expect a very plaintive one upon this subject.</P>

his M.......s and dependants, to dis∣patch affairs with him many hours sooner than of late—and 'tis much to be question'd whether they will not be enabled to wait upon him sooner by being free'd from long levees of their own, and applications; which will in all likelyhood be transferr'd from them directly to himself—the present system being to remove that Phalanx of great people, which stood betwixt the throne and the subjects, and suffer them to have immediate access without the intervention of a caball—(this is the language of others): however the K. gives every thing himself, knows every thing, and weighs every thing ma∣turely,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS moment received the favour of your kind letter.—The letter in the Ladies Magazine about me, was wrote by the noted Dr. H—, who wrote the Inspector, and undertakes that magazine—the people of York are very uncharitable to suppose any man so gross a beast as to pen such a cha∣racter of himself.—In this great town no soul ever suspected it, for a thousand

reasons—could they suppose I should be such a fool as to fall foul upon Dr. W—n, my best friend, by repre∣senting him so weak a man—or by tel∣ling such a lye of him—as his giving me a purse, to buy off his tutorship for Tristram!—or I should be fool enough to own I had taken his purse for that purpose!</P>

at another place, and with another physician; which I have contradicted in this city for the ho∣nour of my friend M—y, all which shews the absurdity of York credulity, and nonsense.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the favour of your obliging letter, nothing has hap∣pened, or been said one day, which has not been contradicted the next; so having little certain to write, I have forbore writing at all, in hopes every day of something worth filling up a letter. We had the greatest expectations yesterday that ever were
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>
raised, of a pitched battle in the H— of C—, wherein Mr. P— was to have entered and thrown down the gaunt∣let, in defence of the German war.—There never was so full a house—the gallery full to the top—I was there all the day—when, lo! a political fit of the gout seized the great combat∣tant—he entered not the lists—B... got up, and begged the house, as he saw not his right honourable friend there, to put off the debate—it could not be done; so B... rose up, and made a most long, passionate, inco∣herent speech, in defence of the Ger∣manick war—but very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was carried
<PB N="67" REF="84"/>
on—in which he addressed himself principally to the C— of the E—, and laid him on terribly.—It seems the chancery of Hanover had laid out 350,000 pounds, on account, and brought in our treasury debtor—and the grand debate was, for an honest examination of the particulars of this extravagant account, and for vouchers to authenticate it.—L... answered B... very rationally, and coolly—Lord N. spoke long—Sir F. D— maintained the German war was most pernicious—Mr. C—, of Surry, spoke well against the ac∣count, with some others—L. B—n at last got up, and spoke half an hour
<PB N="68" REF="85"/>
with great plainness, and temper—explained a great many hidden springs relating to these accounts, in favour of the late K.—and told two or three conversations which had passed between the K. and himself, relative to these expences—which cast great honour upon the K's character. This was with regard to the money the K. had secretly furnished out of his pocket to lessen the account of the Hanover-score brought us to discharge.</P>
<P>B—d and B—n abused all who sought for peace, and joined in the cry for it; and B—d added, that the reasons of wishing a peace
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>
now, were the same as at the peace of Utretch—that the people behind the curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too, so were for making another sacrifice of the nation, to their own interests.—After all—the cry for a peace is so general, that it will certainly end in one. Now for myself.—</P>
<P>One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies—the best is, they abuse and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A STRAIN which I got in my wrist by a terrible fall, prevented my acknowledging the favour of your obliging letter. I went yesterday morn∣ing to breakfast with Mr. V—, who is a kind of right-hand man to the secretary, on purpose to enquire about the propriety, or feasibility, of doing what you wish me—and he has
<PB N="72" REF="89"/>
told me an anecdote which, had you been here, would, I think, have made it wiser to have deferred speaking about the affair a month hence than now; it is this—You must know that the numbers of officers who have left their regiments in Germany, for the pleasures of the town, have been a long topic for merriment; as you see them in St. James's Coffee-house, and the park, every hour, enquiring, open mouth, how things go on in Germany, and what news?—when they should have been there to have fur∣nished news themselves—but the worst part has been, that many of them have left their brother officers on their
<PB N="73" REF="90"/>
duty, and in all the fatigues of it, and have come with no end but to make friends, to be put unfairly over the <HI>heads of those</HI> who were left risk∣ing <HI>their lives.</HI>—In this attempt there have been some but too successful, which has justly raised ill-blood and complaints from the officers who staid behind—the upshot has been, that they have every soul been ordered off, and woe be to him ('tis said) who shall be found listening. Now just to mention our friend's case whilst this cry is on foot, I think would be doing more hurt than good, but if you think otherwise, I will go with all my heart and mention it to Mr.
<PB N="74" REF="91"/>
T..., for to do more I am too in∣considerable a person to pretend to. You made me and my friends here very merry with the accounts current at York, of my being forbid the court—but they do not consider what a considerable person they make of me, when they suppose either my going, or my not going there, is a point that ever enters the K's head—and for those about him, I have the honour either to stand so personally well known to them; or to be so well represented by those of the first rank, as to fear no accident of that kind.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="92"/>I thank God (B...'s excepted) I have never yet made a friend, or connection I have forfeited, or done ought to forfeit—but on the contrary, my true character is bet∣ter understood, and where I had one friend last year, who did me honour, I have three now.—If my enemies knew that by this rage of abuse, and ill will, they were effec∣tually serving the interests both of myself, and works, they would be more quiet—but it has been the fate of my betters, who have found, that the way to fame, is like the way to heaven—through much tribulation—and till I shall have the honour to be

as much mal-treated as Rabelais, and Swift were, I must continue humble; for I have not filled up the measure of half their <HI>persecutions.</HI></P>

<P>—<HI>DE mortuis nil nisi bonum,</HI> is a maxim which you have so often of late urged in conversation, and in your letters, (but in your last especi∣ally) with such seriousness, and severity against me, as the supposed transgres∣sor of the rule;—that you have made me at length as serious and severe as yourself:—but that the humours you have stirred up might not work too
<PB N="85" REF="102"/>
potently within me, I have waited four days to cool myself, before I would set pen to paper to answer you, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>de mortuis nil nisi bonum.</HI>"</Q> I de∣clare I have considered the wisdom, and foundation of it over and over again, as dispassionately and charitably as a good Christian can, and, after all, I can find nothing in it, or make more of it, than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse, put into Latin by some pedant, to be chanted by some hypo∣crite to the end of the world, for the consolation of departing lechers.—'Tis, I own, Latin; and I think that is all the weight it has—for, in plain English, 'tis a loose and futile position
<PB N="86" REF="103"/>
below a dispute—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>you are not to speak any thing of the dead, but what is good.</HI>"</Q> Why so?—Who says so?—neither reason or scripture.—Inspired authors have done otherwise—and reason and common sense tell me, that if the characters of past ages and men are to be drawn at all, they are to be drawn like themselves; that is, with their excellencies, and with their foi∣bles—and it is as much a piece of justice to the world, and to virtue too, to do the one, as the other.—The rule∣ing passion <HI>et les egarements du coeur,</HI> are the very things which mark, and distinguish a man's character;—in which I would as soon leave out a
<PB N="87" REF="104"/>
man's head as his hobby-horse.—How∣ever, if like the poor devil of a painter, we must conform to this pious canon, <HI>de mortuis, &amp;c.</HI> which I own has a spice of piety in the <HI>sound</HI> of it, and be obliged to paint both our angels and our devils out of the same pot—I then infer that our Sydenhams, and Sangrados, our Lucretias,—and Mas∣salinas, our Sommers, and our Bo∣lingbrokes—are alike entitled to sta∣tues, and all the historians, or satirists who have said otherwise since they de∣parted this life, from Sallust, to S—e, are guilty of the crimes you charge me with, "cowardice and injustice."</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="105"/>But why cowardice? <Q REND="inline">"because 'tis not courage to attack a dead man who can't defend himself."</Q>—But why do you doctors of the faculty attack such a one with your incision knife? Oh! for the good of the living.—'Tis my plea.—But I have something more to say in my behalf—and it is this—I am not guilty of the charge—tho' de∣fensible. I have not cut up Doctor Kunastrokius at all—I have just scratch'd him—and that scarce skin∣deep.—I do him first all honour—speak of Kunastrokius as a great man—(be he who he will) and then most distantly hint at a drole foible in his character—and that not first reported
<PB N="89" REF="106"/>
(to the few who can even understand the hint) by me—but known before by every chamber-maid and footman within the bills of mortality—but Kunastrokius, you say, was a great man—'tis that very circumstance which makes the pleasantry—for I could name at this instant a score of honest gentlemen who might have done the very thing which Kunastrokius did, and seen no joke in it at all—as to the failing of Kunstrokius, which you say can only be imputed to his friends as a misfortune—I see nothing like a misfortune in it to any friend or re∣lation of Kunastrokius—that Kuna∣strokius
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Prior-Park, <DATE>June 15, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your favour of the 9th Instant, and am glad to understand, you are got safe home, and employ'd again in your proper studies and amuse∣ments. You have it in your power to make that, which is an amusement to yourself and others, useful to both: at least, you should above all things, beware of its becoming hurtful to either, by any violations of
<PB N="101" REF="118"/>
decency and good manners; but I have already taken such repeated li∣berties of advising you on that head, that to say more would be needless, or perhaps unacceptable.</P>
<P>Whoever is, in any way, well re∣ceived by the public, is sure to be annoy'd by that pest of the public, <HI>profligate scribblers.</HI> This is the com∣mon lot of successful adventurers; but such have often a worse evil to struggle with, I mean the over-offi∣ciousness of their indiscreet friends. There are two Odes, as they are call'd, printed by Dodsley. Whoever was the author, he appears to be a
<PB N="102" REF="119"/>
monster of impiety and lewdness—yet such is the malignity of the scrib∣blers, some have given them to your friend Hall; and others, which is still more impossible, to yourself; tho' the first Ode has the insolence to place you both in a mean and a ridiculous light. But this might arise from a tale equally groundless and maglignant, that you had shewn them to your ac∣quaintances in <HI>M. S.</HI> before they were given to the public. Nor was their being printed by Dodsley the likeliest means of discrediting the calumny.</P>
<P>About this time, another, under the mask of friendship, pretended to draw
<PB N="103" REF="120"/>
your character, which was since pub∣lished in a <HI>Female Magazine,</HI> (for dul∣ness, who often has as great a hand as the devil, in deforming God's works of the creation, has <HI>made them,</HI> it seems, <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female</HI>) and from thence it was transformed into a <HI>Chronicle.</HI> Pray have you read it, or do you know its author?</P>
<P>But of all these things, I dare say Mr. Garrick, whose prudence is equal to his honesty or his talents, has re∣monstrated to you with the freedom of a friend. He knows the inconstancy of what is called the Public, towards all, even the best intentioned, of those
<PB N="104" REF="121"/>
who contribute to its pleasure, or amusement. He (as every man of honour and discretion would) has availed himself of the public favour, to regulate the taste, and, in his proper station, to reform the manners of the fashionable world; while by a well judged oeconomy, he has provided against the temptations of a mean and servile dependency, on the follies and vices of the great.</P>

This vile plight I found my genius in, was the reason I have told Mr. —, I would not write to you till the next post—hopeing, by that time to get some small recruit, at least of vivacity, if not wit, to set out with;—but upon second thoughts, thinking a bad letter in season—to be better than a good one, out of it—this scrawl is the con∣sequence, which, if you will burn the moment you get it—I promise to send you a fine set essay in the stile of your female epistolizers, cut and trim'd at all points.—God defend me from such, who never yet knew what it was to

say or write one premeditated word in my whole life—for this reason I send you with pleasure, because wrote with the careless irregularity of an easy heart.—Who told you Garrick wrote the medley for Beard?—'Twas wrote in his house, however, and be∣fore I left town.—I deny it—I was not lost two days before I left town.—I was lost all the time I was there, and never found till I got to this Shandy castle of mine.—Next winter I intend to sojourn amongst you with more de∣corum, and will neither be lost or found any where.</P>

<P>I REJOICE you are in London—rest you there in peace; here 'tis the devil.—You was a good prophet.—I wish myself back again, as you told me I should—but not because a thin death-doing pestiferous north-east wind blows in a line directly from crazy-castle turret full upon me in this cuckoldly retreat, (for I value the north-east wind and all its powers

<P>The Duke of Orleans has suffered my portrait to be added to the number

<SALUTE>My Dear G.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SNATCH the occasion of Mr. Wilcox (the late Bishop of Roche∣ster's son) leaving this place for Eng∣land, to write to you, and I inclose it to Hall, who will put it into your hand, possibly behind the scenes. I hear no news of you, or your <HI>empire,</HI> I would have said <HI>kingdom</HI>—but here every thing is hyperbolized—and if
<PB N="143" REF="160"/>
a woman is but simply pleased—'tis <HI>Je suis charmeé</HI>—and if she is charmed 'tis nothing less, than that she is <HI>ravi</HI>-sh'd—and when ravi-sh'd, (which may happen) there is nothing left for her but to fly to the other world for a metaphor, and swear, qu'elle etoit toute <HI>exiasieé</HI>—which mode of speaking, is, by the bye, here creep∣ing into use, and there is scarce a woman who understands the <HI>bon ton,</HI> but is seven times in a day in down∣right extasy—that is, the devil's in her—by a small mistake of one world for the other—Now, where am I got?</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="161"/>I have been these two days reading a tragedy, given me by a lady of talents, to read and conjecture if it would do for you—'Tis from the plan of Diderot, and possibly half a trans∣lation of it—The Natural Son, or, the Triumph Virtue, in five acts—It has too much sentiment in it, (at least for me) the speeches too long, and savour too much of <HI>preaching</HI>—this may be a second reason, it is not to my taste—'Tis all love, love, love, throughout, without much separation in the character; so I fear it would not do for your stage, and perhaps for the very reason which recommend it to a French one.—After a vile sus∣pension
<PB N="145" REF="162"/>
of three weeks—we are be∣ginning with our comedies and operas again—yours I hear never flourished more—here the comic actors were never so low—the tragedians hold up their heads—in all senses. I have known <HI>one little man</HI> support the the∣atrical world, like a David Atlas, upon his shoulders, but Preville can't do half as much here, though Mad. Clairon stands by him, and sets her back to his—she is very great, however, and highly improved since you saw her—she also supports her dignity at table, and has her public day every Thurs∣day, when she <HI>gives to eat,</HI> (as they say here) to all that are hungry and dry.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="163"/>You are much talked of here, and much expected as soon as the peace will let you—these two last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at two great houses where I was at dinner—'Tis the greatest problem in nature, in this meridian, that one and the same man should possess such tragic and comic powers, and in such an equilibrio, as to divide the world for which of the two nature intended him.</P>
<P>Crebillion has made a convention with me, which, if he is not too lazy, will be no bad <HI>persiflage</HI>—as soon as I get to Thoulouse he has agreed to
<PB N="147" REF="164"/>
write me an expostulatry letter upon the indecorums of T. Shandy—which is to be answered by recrimi∣nation upon the liberties in his own works—these are to be printed together—Crebillion against Sterne—Sterne against Crebillion—the copy to be sold, and the money equally divided—This is good Swiss-policy.</P>
<P>I am recovered greatly, and if I could spend one whole winter at Tou∣louse, I should be fortified, in my inner man, beyond all danger of re∣lapsing.—A sad asthma my daughter has been martyr'd with these three winters, but mostly this last, makes
<PB N="148" REF="165"/>
it, I fear, necessary she should try the last remedy of a warmer and softer air, so I am going this week to Ver∣sailles, to wait upon Count Choiseul to solicit passports for them—If this system takes place, they join me here—and after a month's stay we all de∣camp for the south of France—if not, I shall see you in June next. Mr. Fox, and Mr. Macartny, having left Paris, I live altogether in French families—I laugh 'till I cry, and in the same tender moments <HI>cry 'till I laugh.</HI> I Shandy it more than ever, and verily do believe, that by mere Shandeism sublimated by a laughter-loving peo∣ple, I fence as much against infirmi∣ties,
<PB N="149" REF="166"/>
as I do by the benefit of air and climate. Adieu, dear G. present ten thousand of my best respects and wishes to and for my friend Mrs. G.—had she been last night upon the Tulleries, she would have annihilated a thousand French goddesses, <HI>in one single turn.</HI></P>

<P>IT is a thousand to one that this reaches you before you have set out—However I take the chance—you will receive one wrote last night, the mo∣ment you get to Mr. E. and to wish you joy of your arrival in town—to that letter which you will find in town, I have nothing to add that I can think on—for I have almost drain'd my

<P>THERE have no mails arrived here 'till this morning, for three posts, so I expected with great impatience a letter from you and Lydia—and lo! it is arrived. You are as busy as Throp's wife, and by the time you receive this, you will be busier still—I have exhausted all my ideas about your journey—and what is needful
<PB N="154" REF="171"/>
for you to do before and during it—so I write only to tell you I am well—Mr. Colebrooks, the minister of Swisserland's secretary, I got this morning to write a letter for you to the governor of the Custom-House-Office, at Calais—it shall be sent you next post.—You must be cautious about Scotch snuff—take half a pound in your pocket, and make Lyd do the same. 'Tis well I bought you a chaise—there is no getting one in Paris now, but at an enormous price—for they are all sent to the army, and such a one as yours we have not been able to match for forty guineas; for a friend of mine who is going from
<PB N="155" REF="172"/>
hence to Italy—the weather was never known to set in so hot, as it has done the latter end of this month, so he and his party are to get into his chaises by four in the morning, and travel 'till nine—and not stir out again till six; but I hope this severe heat will abate by the time you come here—however I beg of you once more to take special care of heating your blood in travel∣ling and come <HI>tout doucement,</HI> when you find the heat too much—I shall look impatiently for intelligence from you, and hope to hear all goes well; that you conquer all difficulties, that you have received your pass-port, my picture, &amp;c. Write and tell me
<PB N="156" REF="173"/>
something of every thing. I long to see you both, you may be assured, my dear wife and child, after so long a separation—and write me a line directly, that I may have all the notice you can give me, that I may have apartments ready and fit for you when you arrive.—For my own part I shall continue writing to you a fortnight longer—present my respects to all friends—you have bid Mr. C. get my visitations at P. done for me, &amp;c. &amp;c. If any offers are made about the inclosure at Rascal, they must be en∣closed to me—nothing that is fairly proposed shall stand still on my score. Do all for the best, as He who guides

<P>I KEEP my promise and write to you again—I am sorry the bureau must be open'd for the deeds—but you will see it done—I imagine you are con∣vinced of the necessity of bringing three hundred pounds in your pocket—if you consider, Lydia must have two slight negligees—you will want a new gown or two—as for painted linens

buy them in town, they will be more admired because English than French.—Mrs. H. writes me word that I am mistaken about buying silk cheaper at Toulouse, than Paris, that she advises you to buy what you want here—where they are very beautiful and cheap, as well as blonds, gauzes, &amp;c.—these I say will all cost you sixty gui∣neas—and you must have them—for in this country nothing must be spared for the back—and if you dine on an onion, and lay in a garret seven stories high, you must not betray it in your cloaths, according to which you are well or ill look'd on. When we are got to Toulouse, we must begin to turn

<SALUTE>My dearest,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING an opportunity of writing by a friend who is setting out this morning for London, I write again, in case the two last letters I have wrote this week to you should be be detained by contrary winds at Calais—I have wrote to Mr. E—, by the same hand, to thank him for his kindness to you in the handsomest

manner I could—and have told him, his good heart, and his wife's, have made them overlook the trouble of having you at his house, but that if he takes you apartments near him they will have occasion still enough left to shew their friendship to us—I have begged him to assist you, and stand by you as if he was in my place with regard to the sale of the Shandys—and then the copy-right—Mark to keep these things distinct in your head—but Becket I have ever found to be a man of probity, and I dare say you will have very little trouble in finishing matters with him—and I would rather wish you to treat with him than with
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
another man—but whoever buys the fifth and sixth volumes of Shandy's, must have the nay-say of the seventh and eighth.—I wish, when you come here, in case the weather is too hot to travel, you could think it pleasant to go to the Spaw for four or six weeks, where we should live for half the money we should spend at Paris—after that we should take the sweetest season of the vintage to go to the south of France—but we will put our heads together, and you shall just do as you please in this, and in every thing which depends on me—for I am a being perfectly contented, when others are pleased—to bear and forbear will
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>
ever be my maxim—only I fear the heats through a journey of five hun∣dred miles for you, and my Lydia, more than for myself.—Do not forget the watch chains—bring a couple for a gentleman's watch likewise, we shall lie under great obligations to the Abbé M. and must make him such a small acknowledgement; according to my way of flourishing, 'twill be a present worth a kingdom to him—They have bad pins, and vile needles here—bring for yourself, and some for presents—as also a strong bottle-skrew, for whatever Scrub we may hire as butler, coachman, &amp;c. to uncork us our Frontiniac—You will
<PB N="167" REF="184"/>

<P>PROBABLY you will receive another letter with this, by the same post, if so read this the last—It will be the last you can possibly receive at York, for I hope it will catch you just as you are upon the wing—if that should happen, I suppose in course you have executed the contents of it, in all things which relate to pecuniary

You have done every thing well with regard to our Sutton and Stillington affairs, and left things in the best channel—if I was not sure you must have long since got my pic∣ture, garnets, &amp;c. I would write and scold Mr. T— abominably—he put

them in Becket's hands to be for∣warded by the stage coach to you as soon as he got to town.—I long to hear from you, and that all my letters and things are come safe to you, and then you will say that I have not been a bad lad—for you will find I have been writing continually as I wished you to do—Bring your silver coffee-pot, 'twill serve both to give water, le∣monade, and orjead—to say nothing of coffee and chocolate, which, by the bye, is both cheap and good at Tou∣louse, like other things—I had like to have forgot a most necessary thing, there are no copper tea-kettles to be had in France, and we shall find such
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>
a thing the most comfortable utensil in the house—buy a good strong one, which will hold two quarts—a dish of tea will be of comfort to us in our journey south—I have a bronze tea-pot, which we will carry also, as China cannot be brought over from Eng∣land, we must make up a villainous party-coloured tea equipage to regale ourselves, and our English friends whilst we are at Toulouse—I hope you have got your bill from Becket.—There is a good natured kind of a trader I have just heard of, at Mr. Foley's, who they think will be coming off from England to France, with horses, the latter end of June. He happened
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>

He was infinitely friendly in the same office last year to the lady who now writes to him, and nursed her on ship-board, and de∣fended her by land with great good∣will.—Do not say I forget you, or whatever can be conducive to your ease of mind, in this journey—I wish I was with you to do these offices my∣self, and to strew roses on your way—
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>
but I shall have time and occasion to shew you I am not wanting—Now, my dears, once more pluck up your spirits—trust in God—in me—and in your∣selves—with this, was you put to it, you would encounter all these difficul∣ties ten times told—Write instantly, and tell me you triumph over all fears; tell me Lydia is better, and a help∣mate to you—You say she grows like me—let her shew me she does so in her comtempt of small dangers, and fighting against the apprehensions of them, which is better still. As I will not have F.'s share of the books, you will inform him so—Give my love to Mr. Fothergill, and to those true

friends which Envy has spared me—and for the rest, laissés passer—You will find I speak French tolerably—but I only wish to be understood.—You will soon speak better; a month's play with a French Demoiselle will make Lyd chatter it like a magpye.
