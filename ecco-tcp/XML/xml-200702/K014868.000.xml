<LG>
<L>WHile Crouds of Princes Your Deserts proclaim,</L>
<L>Proud in their Number to enroll Your Name;</L>
<L>While Emperors to You commit their Cause,</L>
<L>And <HI>ANNA</HI>'S Praises crown the vast Applause,</L>
<L>Accept, Great Leader, what the Muse indites,</L>
<L>That in ambitious Verse records Your Fights,</L>
<L>Fir'd and transported with a Theme so new:</L>
<L>Ten Thousand Wonders op'ning to my View</L>
<L>Shine forth at once, Sieges and Storms appear,</L>
<L>And Wars and Conquests fill th'Important Year,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4" MS="y"/>
Rivers of Blood I see, and Hills of Slain;</L>
<L>An Iliad rising out of One Campaign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Haughty <HI>Gaul</HI> beheld, with tow'ring Pride,</L>
<L>His ancient Bounds enlarg'd on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L><HI>Pirene</HI>'s lofty Barriers were subdu'd,</L>
<L>And in the midst of his wide Empire stood;</L>
<L><HI>Ausonia</HI>'s States, the Victor to restrain,</L>
<L>Oppos'd their <HI>Appenines</HI> and <HI>Alpes</HI> in vain,</L>
<L>Nor found themselves, with strength of Rocks immur'd,</L>
<L>Behind their Everlasting Hills secur'd;</L>
<L>The rising <HI>Danube</HI> its long Race began,</L>
<L>And half its Course through the new Conquests ran;</L>
<L>Amaz'd and anxious for her Sov'raign's Fates,</L>
<L><HI>Germania</HI> trembled through a Hundred States;</L>
<L>Great <HI>Leopold</HI> himself was seis'd with Fear,</L>
<L>He gaz'd around, but saw no Succour near,</L>
<L>He gaz'd, and half abandon'd to Despair</L>
<L>His Hopes on Heav'n, and Confidence in Pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To BRITTAIN'S QUEEN the Nations turn their Eyes,</L>
<L>On Her Resolves the Western World relies,</L>
<L>Confiding still, amidst its dire Alarms,</L>
<L>In <HI>ANNA</HI>'S Councils, and in CHURCHILL'S Arms:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5" MS="y"/>
Thrice Happy BRITTAIN, from the Kingdoms rent,</L>
<L>To sit the Guardian of the Continent!</L>
<L>That sees her Bravest Son advanc'd so high,</L>
<L>And flourishing so near her Prince's Eye;</L>
<L>Thy Fav'rites grow not up by Fortune's sport,</L>
<L>Or from the Crimes, or Follies of a Court;</L>
<L>On the firm Basis of Desert they rise,</L>
<L>From long try'd Faith, and Friendship's Holy Ties:</L>
<L>Their Sov'raign's well-distinguish'd Smiles they share,</L>
<L>Her Ornaments in Peace, her Strength in War,</L>
<L>The Nation thanks them with a Publick Voice,</L>
<L>By Show'rs of Blessings Heav'n approves their Choice;</L>
<L>Envy it self is dumb, in Wonder lost,</L>
<L>And Factions strive who shall applaud 'em most.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as soft Vernal Breezes warm the Sky</L>
<L><HI>Brittania</HI>'s Colours in the Zephyrs fly,</L>
<L>Her Chief already has his March begun,</L>
<L>Crossing the Provinces Himself had won,</L>
<L>Till the <HI>Moselle</HI> appearing from afar</L>
<L>Retards the Progress of the Moving War:</L>
<L>Delightful Stream, had Nature bid her fall</L>
<L>In distant Climes, far from the perjur'd <HI>Gaul;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6" MS="y"/>
But now a Purchase to the Sword she lyes,</L>
<L>Her Harvests for uncertain Owners rise,</L>
<L>Each Vineyard doubtful of its Master grows,</L>
<L>And to the Victor's Bowl each Vintage flows:</L>
<L>The discontented Shades of slaughter'd Hosts</L>
<L>That wander'd on her Banks, her Heroes Ghosts</L>
<L>Hop'd, when they saw <HI>Brittania</HI>'s Arms appear,</L>
<L>The Vengeance due to their great Deaths was near.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our God-like Leader, e'er the Stream he past,</L>
<L>The mighty Scheme of all his Labours cast,</L>
<L>Forming the Wond'rous Year within his Thought;</L>
<L>His Bosom glow'd with Battels yet unfought:</L>
<L>The long laborious March he first surveys,</L>
<L>And joins the distant <HI>Danube</HI> to the <HI>Maese,</HI></L>
<L>Between whose Floods such pathless Forests grow,</L>
<L>Such Mountains rise, so many Rivers flow:</L>
<L>The Toil looks lovely in the Heroes Eyes,</L>
<L>And Danger serves but to enhance the Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Big with the Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> he renews</L>
<L>His dreadful Course, and the proud Foe pursues:</L>
<L>Amidst the sultry Gales his Temples beat,</L>
<L>Infected by the burning Scorpion's Heat,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7" MS="y"/>
'Till on the Borders of the <HI>Maine</HI> he finds</L>
<L>Defensive Shadows, and refreshing Winds:</L>
<L>Our <HI>Brittish</HI> Youth, with in-born Freedom bold,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd Scenes of Servitude behold,</L>
<L>Nations of Slaves, with Tyranny debas'd,</L>
<L>(Their Maker's Image more than half defac'd)</L>
<L>Hourly instructed, as they urge their Toil,</L>
<L>To prize their QUEEN, and love their Native Soil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still to the rising Sun they take their Way</L>
<L>Through Clouds of Dust, and gain upon the Day.</L>
<L>When now the <HI>Neckar</HI> on its friendly Coast</L>
<L>With cooling Streams revives the fainting Host,</L>
<L>That chearfully its Labours pass'd forgets,</L>
<L>The Midnight Watches, and the Noon-day Heats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er prostrate Towns and Palaces they pass,</L>
<L>(Now cover'd o'er with Weeds, and hid in Grass)</L>
<L>Breathing Revenge; whilst Anger and Disdain</L>
<L>Fire ev'ry Breast, and boil in ev'ry Vein:</L>
<L>Here shatter'd Walls, like broken Rocks, from far</L>
<L>Rise up in hideous Views, the Guilt of War,</L>
<L>Whilst here the Vine o'er Hills of Ruin climbs,</L>
<L>Industrious to conceal great <HI>Bourbon</HI>'s Crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y"/>
<L>At length the Fame of <HI>England</HI>'s Heroe drew</L>
<L><HI>Eugenio</HI> to the glorious Interview;</L>
<L>Great Souls by Instinct to each other turn,</L>
<L>Demand Alliance, and in Friendship burn;</L>
<L>A sudden Friendship, while with stretch'd out Rays</L>
<L>They meet each other, mingling Blaze with Blaze.</L>
<L>Polish'd in Courts, and harden'd in the Field,</L>
<L>Renown'd for Conquest, and in Council skill'd,</L>
<L>Their Courage dwells not in a troubl'd Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul, with Virtue over-rul'd,</L>
<L>Inflam'd by Reason, and by Reason cool'd,</L>
<L>In Hours of Peace content to be unknown,</L>
<L>And only in the Field of Battel shown:</L>
<L>To Souls like these, in mutual Friendship join'd,</L>
<L>Heav'n dares entrust the Cause of Human kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Brittania</HI>'s graceful Sons appear in Arms,</L>
<L>Her Harras'd Troops the Heroe's Presence warms,</L>
<L>Whilst the high Hills and Rivers all around</L>
<L>With thund'ring Peals of <HI>Brittish</HI> Shouts resound:</L>
<L>Doubling their Speed they March with fresh Delight,</L>
<L>Eager for Glory, and require the Fight.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9" MS="y"/>
So the stanch Hound the trembling Deer pursues,</L>
<L>And smells his Footsteps in the tainted Dews,</L>
<L>The tedious Track unrav'ling by degrees:</L>
<L>But when the Scent comes warm in ev'ry Breeze,</L>
<L>Fir'd at the near Approach, he shoots away</L>
<L>On his full Stretch, and bears upon his Prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The March concludes, the various Realms are past,</L>
<L>Th' Immortal <HI>Schellenberg</HI> appears at last:</L>
<L>Like Hills th' aspiring Ramparts rise on high,</L>
<L>Like Vallies at their Feet the Trenches lye,</L>
<L>Batt'ries on Batt'ries guard each fatal Pass,</L>
<L>Threat'ning Destruction; Rows of hollow Brass,</L>
<L>Tube behind Tube, the dreadful Entrance keep,</L>
<L>Whilst in their Wombs Ten Thousand Thunders sleep:</L>
<L>Great CHURCHILL owns, charm'd with the glorious sight,</L>
<L>His March o'er-paid by such a promis'd Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Western Sun now shot a feeble Ray,</L>
<L>And faintly scatter'd the Remains of Day,</L>
<L>Ev'ning approach'd, but oh what Hosts of Foes</L>
<L>Were never to behold that Ev'ning close!</L>
<L>Thick'ning their Ranks, and wedg'd in firm Array,</L>
<L>The close compacted <HI>Brittons</HI> win their Way;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10" MS="y"/>
In vain the Cannon their throng'd War defac't</L>
<L>With Tracks of Death, and laid the Battel waste,</L>
<L>Still pressing forward to the Fight, they broke</L>
<L>Through Flames of Sulphur, and a Night of Smoke,</L>
<L>'Till slaughter'd Legions fill the Trench below,</L>
<L>And bear their fierce Avengers to the Foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High on the Works the mingling Hosts engage,</L>
<L>The Battel kindled into Tenfold Rage</L>
<L>With Show'rs of Bullets and with Storms of Fire</L>
<L>Burns in full Fury, Heaps on Heaps expire,</L>
<L>Whole Nations trampl'd into Dirt, and bruis'd,</L>
<L>In one promiscuous Carnage lye confus'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many gen'rous <HI>Brittons</HI> meet their Doom,</L>
<L>New to the Field, and Heroes in the Bloom!</L>
<L>Th' Illustrious Youths, that left their Native Shore</L>
<L>To March where <HI>Brittons</HI> never march'd before,</L>
<L>(O Fatal Love of Fame! O Glorious Heat</L>
<L>Only Destructive to the Brave and Great!)</L>
<L>After such Toils o'ercome, such Dangers past,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on <HI>Bavarian</HI> Ramparts breathe their last.</L>
<L>But hold, my Muse, may no Complaints appear,</L>
<L>Nor blot the Day with an ungrateful Tear:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11" MS="y"/>
While MARLBRÃ” lives <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Stars dispense,</L>
<L>A friendly Light, and shine in Innocence.</L>
<L>Plunging thro' Seas of Blood his fiery Steed</L>
<L>Where e'er his Friends retire, or Foes succeed;</L>
<L>Those he supports, these drives to sudden Flight,</L>
<L>And turns the various Fortune of the Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forbear, Great Man, Renown'd in Arms, forbear</L>
<L>To brave the thickest Terrors of the War,</L>
<L>Nor hazard thus, confus'd in Crouds of Foes,</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI>'s Safety, and the World's Repose;</L>
<L>Let Nations anxious for thy Life abate</L>
<L>This Scorn of Danger, and Contempt of Fate:</L>
<L>Thou liv'st not for thy self; thy QUEEN demands</L>
<L>Conquest and Peace from thy Victorious Hands;</L>
<L>Kingdoms and Empires in thy Fortune join,</L>
<L>And <HI>Europe</HI>'s Destiny depends on Thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the long-disputed Pass they gain,</L>
<L>By crouded Armies fortify'd in vain;</L>
<L>The War breaks in, the fierce <HI>Bavarians</HI> yield,</L>
<L>And see their Camp with <HI>British</HI> Legions fill'd.</L>
<L>So <HI>Belgian</HI> Mounds bear on their shatter'd Sides</L>
<L>The Sea's whole weight, encreas'd with swelling Tides,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12" MS="y"/>
But if the rushing Wave a Passage finds,</L>
<L>Enrag'd by watry Moons, and warring Winds,</L>
<L>The trembling Peasant sees his Country round</L>
<L>Cover'd with Tempests, and in Oceans drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The few surviving Foes, disperst in Flight,</L>
<L>(Refuse of Swords, and Gleanings of a Fight)</L>
<L>In ev'ry russling Wind the Victor hear,</L>
<L>And MARLBRÃ”'S Form in ev'ry Shadow fear,</L>
<L>'Till the dark Cope of Night with kind Embrace</L>
<L>Befriends the Rout, and covers their Disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Donnawert,</HI> with unresisted Force,</L>
<L>The gay Victorious Army bends its Course;</L>
<L>The Growth of Meadows, and the Pride of Fields,</L>
<L>Whatever Spoils <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Summer yields,</L>
<L>(The <HI>Danube</HI>'s great Increase) <HI>Britannia</HI> shares,</L>
<L>The Food of Armies, and Support of Wars:</L>
<L>With Magazines of Death, destructive Balls,</L>
<L>And Cannons doom'd to batter <HI>Landau</HI>'s Walls,</L>
<L>The Victor finds each hidden Cavern stor'd,</L>
<L>And turns their Fury on their Guilty Lord.</L>
</LG>

<L>Deluded Prince! how is thy Greatness crost,</L>
<L>And all the gaudy Dream of Empire lost,</L>
<L>That proudly set thee on a fancy'd Throne,</L>
<L>And made Imaginary Realms thy own!</L>
<L>Thy Troops, that now behind the <HI>Danube</HI> join,</L>
<L>Shall shortly seek for Shelter from the <HI>Rhine,</HI></L>
<L>Nor find it there: Surrounded with Alarms,</L>
<L>Thou hop'est th' Assistance of the <HI>Gallic</HI> Arms;</L>
<L>The <HI>Gallic</HI> Arms in Safety shall advance,</L>
<L>And croud thy Standards with the Pow'r of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>While to console thy Doom, th'aspiring <HI>Gaul</HI></L>
<L>Shares thy Destruction, and adorns thy Fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unbounded Courage and Compassion join'd,</L>
<L>Temp'ring each other in the Victor's Mind,</L>
<L>Alternately proclaim him Good and Great,</L>
<L>And make the Heroe and the Man compleat.</L>
<L>Long did he strive th'obdurate Foe to gain</L>
<L>By proffer'd Grace, but long he strove in vain,</L>
<L>'Till fir'd at length he thinks it vain to spare</L>
<L>His rising Wrath, and gives a Loose to War.</L>
<L>In Vengeance rous'd the Soldier fills his Hand</L>
<L>With Sword and Fire, and ravages the Land,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14" MS="y"/>
A Thousand Villages to Ashes turns,</L>
<L>In crackling Flames a Thousand Harvests burns,</L>
<L>To the thick Woods the woolly Flocks retreat,</L>
<L>And mixt with bellowing Herds confus'dly bleat;</L>
<L>Their trembling Lords the common Shade partake,</L>
<L>And Cries of Infants sound in ev'ry Brake:</L>
<L>The list'ning Soldier fixt in Sorrow stands,</L>
<L>Loth to Obey his Leader's just Commands;</L>
<L>The Leader grieves, by gen'rous Pity sway'd,</L>
<L>To see his just Commands so well obey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the Trumpet terrible from far</L>
<L>In shriller Clangors animates the War,</L>
<L>Confed'rate Drums in fuller Consort beat,</L>
<L>And ecchoing Hills the loud Alarm repeat:</L>
<L><HI>Gallia</HI>'s proud Standards, to <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s join'd,</L>
<L>Unfurl their gilded Lillies in the Wind,</L>
<L>The daring Prince his blasted Hopes renews,</L>
<L>And while the thick embattled Host he views</L>
<L>Stretcht out in deep Array, and dreadful Length,</L>
<L>His Heart dilates, and glories in his Strength.</L>

<L>The fatal Day its mighty Course began</L>
<L>That the griev'd World had long desir'd in vain:</L>

States that their New Captivity bemoan'd,</L>
<L>Armies of Martyrs that in Exile groan'd,</L>

<L><HI>Europe</HI>'s loud Cries, that Providence assail'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>ANNA</HI>'S Ardent Vows at length prevail'd;</L>
<L>The Day was come when Heav'n design'd to show</L>
<L>His Care and Conduct of the World below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold in awful March and dread Array</L>
<L>The long Extended Squadrons shape their Way!</L>
<L>Death, in approaching terrible, imparts</L>
<L>An anxious Horror to the Bravest Hearts,</L>
<L>Yet do their beating Breasts demand the Strife,</L>
<L>And Thirst of Glory quells the Love of Life;</L>
<L>The <HI>British</HI> Souls low Images disclaim,</L>
<L>The Heat of Vengeance and Desire of Fame</L>
<L>O'er-look the Foe, advantag'd by his Post,</L>
<L>Lessen his Numbers, and Contract his Host:</L>
<L>Tho' Fens and Floods possest the middle Space,</L>
<L>That unprovok'd they would have fear'd to pass,</L>

<L>Methinks I hear the Drum's tumultuous Sound</L>
<L>The Victor's Shouts and Dying Groans confound,</L>
<L>The dreadful Burst of Cannon rend the Skies,</L>
<L>And all the Thunder of the Battel rise.</L>
<L>'Twas then Great MARLBRÃ”'S mighty Soul was prov'd,</L>

<L>Free'd by the Terror of the Victor's Name</L>
<L>The rescu'd States his great Protection claim;</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Ulme</HI> th' Approach of her Deliv'rer waits,</L>
<L>And longs to open her obsequious Gates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Heroe's Breast still swells with great Designs,</L>
<L>In ev'ry Thought the tow'ring Genius shines:</L>
<L>If to the Foe his dreadful Course he bends,</L>
<L>O'er the wide Continent his March extends;</L>
<L>If Sieges in his lab'ring Thoughts are form'd,</L>
<L>Camps are assaulted, and an Army storm'd;</L>
<L>If to the Fight his active Soul is bent,</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> turns on its Event.</L>
<L>What distant Land, what Region can afford</L>
<L>An Action worthy his Victorious Sword;</L>
<L>Where will he next the flying <HI>Gaul</HI> defeat,</L>
<L>To make the Series of his Toils compleat?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the swoln <HI>Rhine</HI> rushing with all its Force</L>
<L>Divides the Hostile Nations in its Course,</L>
<L>While Each contracts its Bounds, or wider grows,</L>
<L>Enlarg'd or straiten'd as the River flows,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
On <HI>Gallia</HI>'s Side a mighty Bulwark stands,</L>
<L>That all the wide extended Plain commands;</L>
<L>Twice, since the War was kindled, has it try'd</L>
<L>The Victor's rage, and twice has chang'd its Side;</L>
<L>As oft whole Armies, with the Prize o'erjoy'd,</L>
<L>Have the long Summer on its Walls employ'd.</L>
<L>Hither our mighty Chief his Arms directs,</L>
<L>Hence future Triumphs from the War expects;</L>
<L>And, tho' the Dog-star had its Course begun,</L>
<L>Carries his Arms still nearer to the Sun:</L>
<L>Fixt on the glorious Action, He forgets</L>
<L>The Change of Seasons, and Increase of Heats:</L>
<L>No Toils are painful that can Danger show,</L>
<L>No Climes unlovely that contain a Foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The roving <HI>Gaul,</HI> to his own Bounds restrain'd,</L>
<L>Learns to Encamp within his Native Land,</L>
<L>But soon as the Victorious Host he spies,</L>
<L>From Hill to Hill, from Stream to Stream he flies:</L>
<L>Such dire Impressions in his Heart remain</L>
<L>Of MARLBRÃ”'S Sword, and HOCKSTET'S fatal Plain:</L>
<L>In vain <HI>Britannia</HI>'s mighty Chief besets</L>
<L>Their shady Coverts, and obscure Retreats;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22" MS="y"/>
They fly the Conqueror's approaching Fame,</L>
<L>That bears the Force of Armies in his Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Austria</HI>'s Young Monarch, whose Imperial Sway</L>
<L>Sceptres and Thrones are destin'd to obey,</L>
<L>Whose boasted Ancestry so high extends</L>
<L>That in the Pagan Gods his Lineage ends,</L>
<L>Comes from a-far, in Gratitude to own</L>
<L>The great Supporter of his Father's Throne:</L>
<L>What Tides of Glory to his Bosom ran,</L>
<L>Clasp'd in th' Embraces of the God-like Man?</L>
<L>How were his Eyes with pleasing Wonder fixt</L>
<L>To see such Fire with so much Sweetness mixt,</L>
<L>Such easie Greatness, such a graceful Port,</L>
<L>So turn'd and finish'd for the Camp or Court!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> thus was form'd with ev'ry Grace,</L>
<L>And <HI>Nireus</HI> shone but in the second Place;</L>
<L>Thus the great Father of Almighty <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>(His Features flusht with an Immortal Bloom</L>

<L>The Royal Youth by MARLBRÃ”'S Presence charm'd,</L>
<L>Taught by his Counsels, by his Actions warm'd,</L>

<L>Discharges all his Thunder on its Walls,</L>
<L>O'er Mines and Caves of Death provokes the Eight,</L>
<L>And learns to Conquer in the Hero's sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>British</HI> Chief, for mighty Toils renown'd,</L>
<L>Increas'd in Titles, and with Conquests crown'd,</L>
<L>To <HI>Belgian</HI> Coasts his tedious March renews,</L>
<L>And the long Windings of the <HI>Rhine</HI> pursues,</L>
<L>Clearing its Borders from Usurping Foes,</L>
<L>And blest by rescu'd Nations as he goes.</L>
<L><HI>Treves</HI> fears no more, freed from its dire Alarms,</L>
<L>And <HI>Traerbach</HI> feels the Terror of his Arms,</L>
<L>Seated on Rocks her proud Foundations shake,</L>
<L>While MARLBRÃ” presses to the dire Attack,</L>
<L>Plants all his Batt'ries, bids his Cannon roar,</L>
<L>And shows how <HI>Landau</HI> might have fall'n before.</L>
<L>Scar'd at his near Approach, Great <HI>Louis</HI> fears</L>
<L>Vengeance reserv'd for his declining Years,</L>
<L>Forgets his Thirst of Universal Sway,</L>
<L>And scarce can teach his Subjects to Obey;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24" MS="y"/>
His Arms he finds on vain Attempts employ'd,</L>
<L>Th' Ambitions Projects of his Race destroy'd,</L>
<L>The Work of Ages sunk in One Campaign,</L>
<L>And Lives of Millions sacrific'd in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are th' Effects of <HI>ANNA</HI>'s Royal Cares:</L>
<L>By Her, <HI>Britannia,</HI> great in Foreign Wars,</L>
<L>Ranges through Nations, wheresoe'er disjoin'd,</L>
<L>Without the wonted Aid of Sea and Wind.</L>
<L>By Her th' unfetter'd <HI>Ister</HI>'s States are free,</L>
<L>And taste the Sweets of <HI>English</HI> Liberty.</L>
<L>But who can tell the Joys of those that lye</L>
<L>Within the constant Influence of Her Eye!</L>
<L>Whilst in diffusive Show'rs Her Bounties fall</L>
<L>Like Heav'n's Indulgence, and descend on All,</L>
<L>Secure the Happy, succour the Distrest,</L>
<L>Make ev'ry Subject Glad, and a whole People Blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus would I fain <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Wars rehearse,</L>
<L>In the smooth Records of a faithful Verse;</L>
<L>That, if such Numbers can o'er Time prevail,</L>
<L>May tell Posterity the wond'rous Tale.</L>
<L>When Actions, Unadorn'd, are faint and weak,</L>
<L>Cities and Countries must be taught to speak;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25" MS="y"/>
Gods may descend in Factions from the Skies,</L>
<L>And Rivers from their Oozy Beds arise;</L>
<L>Fiction may deck the Truth with spurious Rays,</L>
<L>And round the Heroe cast a borrow'd Blaze.</L>
<L>MARLBRÃ”'S Exploits appear divinely bright,</L>
<L>And proudly shine in their own Native Light;</L>
<L>Rais'd of themselves, their genuin Charms they boast,</L>
<L>And those who Paint 'em truest Praise 'em most.</L>
