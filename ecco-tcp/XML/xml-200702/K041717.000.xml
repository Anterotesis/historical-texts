<HEAD>THE PROPHECY of FAMINE. A SCOTS PASTORAL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN CUPID first instructs his darts to fly</L>
<L>From the sly corner of some cook-maid's eye,</L>
<L>The stripling raw, just enter'd in his teens,</L>
<L>Receives the wound, and wonders what it means;</L>
<L>His heart, like dripping, melts, and new desire</L>
<L>Within him stirs, each time she stirs the fire;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>Trembling and blushing he the fair one views,</L>
<L>And fain would speak, but can't—without a MUSE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>So,</HI> to the sacred mount he takes his way,</L>
<L>Prunes his young wings, and tunes his infant lay,</L>
<L>His oaten reed to rural ditties frames,</L>
<L>To flocks and rocks, to hills and rills proclaims,</L>
<L>In simplest notes, and all unpolish'd strains,</L>
<L>The loves of nymphs, and <HI>eke</HI> the loves of swains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clad, as your nymphs were always clad of yore,</L>
<L>In rustic weeds—a cook-maid now no more—</L>
<L>Beneath an aged oak LARDELLA lies—</L>
<L>Green moss, her couch; her canopy, the skies.</L>
<L>From aromatic shrubs the <HI>roguish</HI> gale</L>
<L>Steals <HI>young</HI> perfumes, and wafts them thro' the vale.</L>
<L>The youth, turn'd swain, and skill'd in rustic lays,</L>
<L>Fast by her side his am'rous descant plays.</L>
<L>Herds lowe, Flocks bleat, Pies chatter, Ravens scream,</L>
<L>And the full chorus dies a-down the stream.</L>
<L>The streams, with music freighted, as they pass,</L>
<L>Present the fair LARDELLA with a glass,</L>
<L>And ZEPHYR, to compleat the love-sick plan,</L>
<L>Waves his light wings, and serves her for a fan.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<L>But when maturer Judgment takes the lead,</L>
<L>These childish toys on Reason's altar bleed,</L>
<L>Form'd after some <HI>great man,</HI> whose name breeds awe,</L>
<L>Whose ev'ry sentence Fashion makes a law,</L>
<L>Who on mere credit his vain trophies rears,</L>
<L>And founds his merit on our servile fears;</L>
<L>Then we discard the workings of the heart,</L>
<L>And nature's banish'd by <HI>mechanic</HI> art.</L>

<L>Landscapes, unknown to <HI>dowdy</HI> Nature, rise,</L>
<L>And new creations strike our wond'ring eyes.</L>

<L>How did'st thou bear thy MAGGY's falshood? how,</L>

<L>O she was <HI>bonny!</HI> all the Highlands round</L>
<L>Was there a rival to my MAGGY found!</L>
<L>More precious (tho' that precious is to all)</L>
<L>Than the rare medicine, which we Brimstone call,</L>
<L>Or that choice plant, so grateful to the nose,</L>
<L>Which in, I know not what, far country grows,</L>

<L>A lass so fair should ever prove untrue.</L>

<L>Whether with pipe or song to charm the ear,</L>

<L>Curs'd be that year by ev'ry honest Scot,</L>

<L>Full sorely may we all lament that day:</L>
<L>For all were losers in the deadly fray.</L>
<L>Five brothers had I, on the Scottish plains,</L>
<L>Well dost thou know, were none more hopeful swains;</L>
<L>Five brothers there I lost, in manhood's pride,</L>
<L>Two in the field, and three on gibbets died;</L>
<L><HI>Ah!</HI> silly swains, to follow war's alarms,</L>
<L><HI>Ah!</HI> what hath shepherd's life to do with arms?</L>

<L>Mention it not—there saw I strangers clad</L>
<L>In all the honours of our ravish'd <HI>Plaid,</HI></L>
<L>Saw the FERRARA too, our nation's pride,</L>
<L>Unwilling grace the aukward victor's side.</L>
<L>There fell our choicest youth, and from that day</L>

<L>Thus plain'd the boys, when from her throne of turf,</L>

<L>Vile humours, which, in life's corrupted well</L>
<L>Mix'd at the birth, not abstinence could quell,</L>
<L>Pale FAMINE rear'd the head; her eager eyes,</L>
<L>Where hunger e'en to madness seem'd to rise,</L>
<L>Speaking aloud her throes and pangs of heart,</L>
<L>Strain'd to get loose, and from their orbs to start;</L>
<L>Her hollow cheeks were each a deep-sunk cell,</L>
<L>Where wretchedness and horror lov'd to dwell;</L>
<L>With double rows of useless teeth supplied,</L>
<L>Her mouth, from ear to ear, extended wide,</L>
<L>Which, when for want of food her entrails pin'd,</L>

<L>Pent in this barren corner of the isle,</L>

<L>What was rejected by the lawful heir;</L>
<L>Unknown amongst the nations of the earth,</L>
<L>Or only known to raise contempt and mirth;</L>
<L>Long free, because the race of Roman braves</L>
<L>Thought it not worth their while to make us slaves;</L>
<L>Then into bondage by that nation brought,</L>
<L>Whose ruin we for ages vainly sought,</L>
