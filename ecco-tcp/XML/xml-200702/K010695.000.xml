<P>TASTE is the power of recei∣ving
pleasure from the beau∣ties
of Nature and of Art.</P>
<P>It is an internal sense, in many of its
exertions directed and assisted by reason.</P>
<P>It is common, in some degree, to all
men; and is an improveable faculty.</P>
<P>It derives its improvement from ex∣ercise,
and from the application of rea∣son
and good sense to the objects of
taste.</P>
<P>Delicacy and correctness are the cha∣racters
of taste in its most perfect state.</P>
<P>The general sense and feelings of
mankind form the <HI>Standard of Taste.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P>CRITICISM is the application of im∣proved
taste to the several fine arts.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
The rules of criticism are founded on
experience; or on the observation of
such beauties as give the highest and
most general pleasure to mankind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<P>GENIUS is a higher power of the
mind than Taste. Taste feels and jud∣ges;
Genius invents and executes.</P>
<P>Genius is more limited in its sphere
than Taste. Genius may in some cases
be strong, where Taste is incorrect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<P>The PLEASURES OF TASTE arise
from various sources; chiefly from
<HI>Grandeur,</HI> and from <HI>Beauty.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<P>The sensation of GRANDEUR, or
SUBLIMITY, is produced, either by the
<HI>view</HI> of certain external objects, or by
the <HI>description</HI> of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<P>In external objects, Grandeur arises
from vastness, or amplitude; from
loudness of sounds; from the violence
of the elements; in general, from all
appearances of extraordinary force and
might.</P>
<P>The awful assists the impression of
the grand or sublime. Darkness, soli∣tude,
and silence promote it. Super∣natural
scenes are always sublime.</P>
<P>The Moral Sublime arises from senti∣ments
of uncommon magnanimity or
heroism.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<P>The description of grand or sublime
objects in their proper colours, or the
representation of sublime sentiments,
constitutes <HI>Sublime Writing.</HI> This
term has been often used in too loose a
sense.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Simplicity, as opposed to a profusion
of ornament, is an essential requisite to
sublime writing.</P>
<P>Conciseness, as opposed to superfluous
expression, is another requisite.</P>
<P>The proper selection circumstances
is particularly necessary in sublime de∣scription.
One mean or trifling cir∣cumstance
destroys the emotion which
was intended to be raised.</P>
<P>What is called a <HI>Sublime Style</HI> is com∣monly
a very bad one. To be sublime
is to express great conceptions in few
and plain words.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frigid</HI> and the <HI>Bombast</HI> are the
two opposites of the sublime.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<P>BEAUTY extends to a much greater
variety of objects than grandeur.</P>
<P>It is ascribed to colour; to figure;
to motion; to certain moral qualities;
to the human countenance; to fitness
and design in works of art; to certain
kinds of writing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>

<P>Novelty, Variety, Imitation, Harmo∣ny,
Wit and Humour, are also sources
of pleasure to Taste.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Language</HI> possesses the most extensive
power of exhibiting the objects which

<P>LANGUAGE is the expression of
our ideas by certain articulate
sounds which are used as the signs of
those ideas.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P>Language in its early state was aided
by expressive tones and gestures. Pro∣nunciation
among the ancients was more
vehement than among the moderns.</P>
<P>Language in its early state was figura∣tive
and metaphorical, and advanced
gradually to simplicity.</P>
<P>The arrangement of words in ancient
languages followed most commonly the
order of the imagination. Arrange∣ment,
in modern languages, follows
the order of the understanding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Written characters</HI> are of two kinds:
either representing objects, or repre∣senting
words.</P>
<P>Pictures, Hieroglyphicks, and the
Chinese characters, are of the former
kind; and were the most ancient me∣thod
of writing.</P>
<P>Alphabetical characters are of the lat∣ter
kind; and were an improvement on
the ancient method.</P>
<P><HI>Written Language</HI> is more extensive
and permanent than speech. <HI>Spoken
Language</HI> has more force and energy
than writing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<P>The parts of language or speech may
be divided into <HI>Substantives, Attribu∣tives,</HI>
and <HI>Connectives.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Substantives</HI> are general names of ob∣jects;
and are particularised by the <HI>Ar∣ticle.</HI></P>
<P>The most common affections of Sub∣stantives
are <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Gender.</HI></P>
<P>Varieties in the use of gender occur
in different languages. The English
tongue possesses a considerable advan∣tage
in this respect.</P>
<P><HI>Declension</HI> or <HI>Cases</HI> of substantives
express relations which objects bear to
one another.</P>
<P>The ancient tongues employed de∣clension
more than the modern.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Attributives</HI> express the attribute,
quality, or action, of some substance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adjective</HI> is the simplest form of
attributive words; the <HI>Verb,</HI> the most
complex.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
Every verb expresses an attribute, an
affirmation, and time.</P>
<P><HI>Conjugation</HI> is the manner of express∣ing
the diversity of circumstances in∣cluded
in the verb, by a variation of
syllables in the word. Conjugation is
more regular and complete in ancient
than in modern languages.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Connectives</HI> join words and sentences
together; and express the relations,
connections, and dependencies of ob∣jects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>English Language</HI> is a derived
and compounded language.</P>
<P>It is irregular in its structure.</P>
<P>It is a copious and expressive lan∣guage,
especially on the graver subjects.</P>
<P>It is flexible, or pssesses a consider∣able
power of accommodation to differ∣ent
styles and manners.</P>
<P>It is not unharmonious</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<P>STYLE is the peculiar manner in
which different men employ lan∣guage
for expressing their conceptions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Perspicuity</HI> is the first virtue of style.</P>
<P>Perspicuity, in the choice of words,
requires <HI>Purity, Propriety,</HI> and <HI>Preci∣sion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Purity</HI> is the use of such words and
phrasses as belong to the idiom of the
language which we employ.</P>
<P><HI>Propriety</HI> is the selection of such
words, belonging to the language, as
the most authorised usage has appropri∣ated
to the ideas which we mean to exp∣ress
by them.</P>
<P><HI>Precision</HI> is the expression of those i∣deas
which we intend to convey, with∣out
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
any foreign or superfluous circum∣stance
added to them.</P>
<P>The loose use of words reputed <HI>sy∣nonymous,</HI>
is one great cause of want
of precision.</P>
<P>There are few words in any language
that are strictly synonymous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<P>A SENTENCE is one complete pro∣position
of enunciation of thought.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<P>Variety is to be preserved with regard
to long and short sentences.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<P>In the <HI>Structure</HI> of a sentence, the
principal things to be studied are,
<HI>Clearness, Unity, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Har∣mony.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Clearness</HI> consists in such a colloca∣tion
of the words and members of a
sentence as shall mark the relation of the
several parts to each other without am∣biguity.</P>
<P>This requires particular attention to
the position of adverbs, of interposed
circumstances, and of relative pronouns
and particles.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Unity</HI> of a sentence requires the
principal object not to be changed;
the sentence not to be crouded with
things slightly related to each other;
parentheses to be seldom interposed;
and no adjections to be brought in after
the natural close of the period.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Strength</HI> of a sentence arises from
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
such a disposition of the several words
and members of it, as shall render the
impression which the sentence is design∣ed
to make, most full and complete.</P>
<P>This requires all redundant words
and members to be rejected; particular
attention to be given to copulative and
relative particles; the capital words to
be disposed of in the most proper place,
and to be kept clear from circumstances
that would clog them; the members of
the sentence to be made to grow in their
importance; the sentence not to be ter∣minated
by particles, prepositions, or
inconsiderable words; and objects com∣pared
or contrasted, to be expressed in
resembling terms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Harmony</HI> of a sentence consists
either in agreeable sound being so or∣dered
as to become expressive of the
sense.</P>
<P>Agreeableness of sound depends, first,
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
on the choice of words, and next on
the arrangement of them.</P>
<P>The Greeks and Romans, for several
reasons, attended to musical arrange∣ment
more than the moderns.</P>
<P>Musical arrangement is sensible chief∣ly
in the distribution of the members,
and rests, of a period; and in the close
or cadence of it.</P>
<P>Monotony is always to be avoided.
Sense is never to be sacrificed to sound.</P>
<P>Sounds may be rendered expressive of
the sense, either by adapting it to the
general tenor of the discourse; or by
accomplishing a particular analogy be∣tween
the sounds, the motions, and the
sensations, which are described, and the
words employed in describing them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<P>FIGURES OF SPEECH convey our
ideas to others in a particular dress, and
with some circumstance added, which
is designed to render the idea more
strong and vivid.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"/>
They are a natural mode of language,
prompted by the imagination and pas∣sions.</P>
<P>They take their rise partly from the
barrenness of language, but more from
the influence of imagination over the
use of language.</P>
<P>They serve for the embellishment of
style, by rendering it more copious,
more dignified, more expressive, and
more picturesque.</P>
<P>All the relations which objects bear
to one another may be sources of fi∣gures.
The most copious source of
them is the relation of similitude or re∣semblance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>11.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Metaphor</HI> is the most frequent of all
figures. It is an abridged comparison;
and consists in substituting one object
in place of another, on account of the
close resemblance which is supposed be∣twixt
them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="18"/>
Metaphors ought to be suited to the
strain of the subject. They ought to be
taken from objects of some dignity.
They ought to be founded on a resem∣blance
which is clear, and not intricate
or far-fetched. The metaphorical and
the literal sense must not be confound∣ed.
Metaphors must not be mixed; nor
crouded; nor too far pursued.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>12.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Allegory</HI> is of the nature of meta∣phor,
and subject to the same rules.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>13.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Hyperbole</HI> is the effect of passion and
heated imagination, which are always
prone to exaggerate their objects.</P>
<P>Passionate hyperboles are more natu∣ral
and proper than descriptive ones.</P>
<P>Frequent or strained hyperboles weak∣en
style in place of strengthening it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Personification</HI> springs from a ten∣dency
in human nature to animate all
objects when the mind is warmed. It
is a figure of extensive use.</P>
<P>The lowest degree of it consists in a∣scribing
to inanimate beings the quali∣ties
of such as have life; the next, in a∣scribing
to them the actions of living
creatures; the highest, in addressing
ourselves to them as such, or represent∣ing
them as speaking to us,</P>
<P>In this last degree, it is the boldest of
all figures of speech; and is natural on∣ly
when the mind is highly elevated, or
much moved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>15.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Apostrophe</HI> is a direct address to per∣sons
who are absent or dead; and is
much allied to personification.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Comparison,</HI> or <HI>Smile,</HI> is suggested
by imagination, not by passion.</P>
<P>All comparisons are intended, either
to explain, or to embellish.</P>
<P>Embellishing comparison should
serve to produce a strong impression of
the primary object; should be founded
on some likeness or analogy, neither too
near and obvious, not too faint and re∣mote;
and trite and beaten subjects of
comparison should be avoided.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>17.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Antithesis</HI> is founded on the contrast

<P>PRONUNCIATION or DELIVERY
is one of the most important parts of
eloquence.</P>
<P>The first object in delivery is, to speak
so as to be fully and easily understood;
the next is, to speak with grace and
force.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33"/>
In order to be easily and fully under∣stood,
the voice must be pitched on a
proper key; pronunciation must not
be rapid and hurried; it must be dis∣tinct
and articulate; it must be proper
and correct in the sound given to
words.</P>
<P>In order to speak with grace and
force, the principal things to be at∣tended
to are, the <HI>Emphases,</HI> the
<HI>Pauses,</HI> the <HI>Tones,</HI> and the <HI>Gestures,</HI>
which belong to discourse.</P>
<P>These, in publick speaking, are to be

leads us to express ourselves in a∣nimated
conversation.</P>
