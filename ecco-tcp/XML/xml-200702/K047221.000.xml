<HEAD>TO SAMUEL SPAN, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> Master of the Society of Mer∣chants Adventurers of Bristol.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your letter of the 13th, in answer to mine, which accompanied the resolutions of the House relative to the trade of Ireland.</P>
<P>You will be so good as to present my best respects to the Society, and to assure them, that it was altogether unnecessary to remind me of the interest of the con∣stituents. I have never regarded any thing else, since I had a seat in parlia∣ment. Having frequently and maturely considered that interest, and stated it
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
to myself in almost every point of view, I am persuaded, that, under the present circumstances, I cannot more effectually pursue it, than by giving all the sup∣port in my power to the propositions which I lately transmitted to the Hall.</P>
<P>The fault I find in the scheme is,— that it falls extremely short of that li∣berality in the commercial system, which, I trust, will one day be adopted. If I had not considered the present re∣solutions, merely as preparatory to bet∣ter things, and as a means of shewing experimentally, that justice to others is not always folly to ourselves, I should have contented myself with receiving them in a cold and silent acquiescence. Separately considered, they are matters of no very great importance. But they aim, however imperfectly, at a right principle. I submit to the restraint to appease prejudice: I accept the enlarge∣ment,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
so far as it goes, as the result of reason and of sound policy.</P>
<P>We cannot be insensible of the cala∣mities which have been brought upon this nation by an obstinate adherence to narrow and restrictive plans of govern∣ment. I confess, I cannot prevail on myself to take them up, precisely at a time, when the most decisive experience has taught the rest of the world to lay them down. The propositions in ques∣tion did not originate from me, or from my particular friends. But when things are so right in themselves, I hold it my duty, not to enquire from what hands they come. I opposed the American measures upon the very same principle on which I support those that relate to Ireland. I was convinced, that the evils which have arisen from the adoption of the former, would be infinitely aggra∣vated by the rejection of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Perhaps Gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the situation of their country, and what its exigencies absolutely re∣quire. I find that we are still disposed to talk at our ease, and as if all things were to be regulated by our good plea∣sure. I should consider it as a fatal symptom, if, in our present distressed and adverse circumstances, we should persist in the errors which are natural only to prosperity. One cannot indeed sufficiently lament the continuance of that spirit of delusion, by which, for a long time past, we have thought fit to measure our necessities by our inclina∣tions. Moderation, prudence, and equi∣ty, are far more suitable to our condi∣tion, than loftiness, and confidence, and rigour. We are threatened by enemies of no small magnitude, whom, if we think fit, we may despise, as we have despised others; but they are enemies
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
who can only cease to be truly formi∣dable, by our entertaining a due respect for their power. Our danger will not be lessened by our shutting our eyes to it; nor will our force abroad be en∣creased by rendering ourselves feeble, and divided at home.</P>
<P>There is a dreadful schism in the Bri∣tish nation. Since we are not able to reunite the empire, it is our business to give all possible vigour and soundness to those parts of it which are still con∣tent to be governed by our councils. Sir, it is proper to inform you, that our measures <HI>must be healing.</HI> Such a degree of strength must be communicated to all the members of the state, as may enable them to defend themselves, and to co-operate in the defence of the whole. Their temper too must be ma∣naged, and their good affections culti∣vated. They may then be disposed to
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
bear the load with chearfulness, as a contribution towards what may be call∣ed with truth and propriety, and not by an empty form of words, <HI>a common cause.</HI> Too little dependence cannot be had, at this time of day, on names and prejudices. The eyes of mankind are opened; and communities must be held together by an evident and solid inte∣rest. God forbid, that our conduct should demonstrate to the world, that Great Britain can, in no instance what∣soever, be brought to a sense of rational and equitable policy, but by coercion and force of arms!</P>
<P>I wish you to recollect, with what powers of concession, relatively to com∣merce, as well as to legislation, his Majesty's Commissioners to the United Colonies have sailed from England with∣in this week. Whether these powers are sufficient for their purposes, it is not
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
now my business to examine. But we all know, that our resolutions in favour of Ireland are trifling and insignificant, when compared with the concessions to the Americans. At such a juncture, I would implore every man, who retains the least spark of regard to the yet re∣maining honour and security of this country, not to compel others to an imitation of their conduct; or by pas∣sion and violence, to force them to seek in the territories of the separation, that freedom, and those advantages, which they are not to look for whilst they re∣main under the wings of their ancient government.</P>
<P>After all, what are the matters we dispute with so much warmth? Do we in these resolutions <HI>bestow</HI> any thing upon Ireland? Not a shilling. We only consent to <HI>leave</HI> to them, in two or three instances, the use of the natu∣ral
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
faculties which God has given to them, and to all mankind. Is Ireland united to the crown of Great Britain for no other purpose, than that we should counteract the bounty of Provi∣dence in her favour? And in propor∣tion as that bounty has been liberal, that we are to regard it as an evil, which is to be met with in every sort of cor∣rective? To say that Ireland interferes with us, and therefore must be checked, is, in my opinion, a very mistaken, and a very dangerous principle. I must beg leave to repeat, what I took the liberty of suggesting to you in my last letter, that Ireland is a country, in the same climate, and of the same natural qua∣lities and productions, with this; and has consequently no other means of growing wealthy in herself, or, in other words, of being useful to us, but by doing the very same things which we
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
do, for the same purposes. I hope that in Great Britain we shall always pur∣sue, without exception, <HI>every</HI> means of prosperity; and of course, that Ireland <HI>will</HI> interfere with us in something or other; for either, in order to <HI>limit</HI> her, we <HI>must restrain</HI> ourselves, or we must fall into that shocking conclusion, that we are to keep our yet remaining de∣pendency, under a general and indis∣criminate restraint, for the mere pur∣pose of oppression. Indeed, Sir, Eng∣land and Ireland may flourish together. The world is large enough for us both. Let it be our care, not to make our∣selves too little for it.</P>
<P>I know it is said, that the people of Ireland do not pay the same taxes, and therefore ought not in equity to enjoy the same benefits with this. I had hopes, that the unhappy phantom of a compulsory <HI>equal taxation</HI> had haunted
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
us long enough. I do assure you, that until it is entirely banished from our imaginations, (where alone it has, or can have any existence,) we shall never cease to do ourselves the most substan∣tial injuries. To that argument of equal taxation, I can only say,—that Ireland pays as many taxes, as those who are the best judges of her powers, are of opinion she can bear. To bear more she must have more ability; and in the order of nature, the advantage must <HI>precede</HI> the charge. This disposi∣tion of things, being the law of God, neither you nor I <HI>can</HI> alter it. So that if you will have more help from Ireland, you must <HI>previously</HI> supply her with more means. I believe it will be found, that if men are suffered freely to cultivate their natural advantages, a vir∣tual equality of contribution will come in its own time, and will flow by an
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
easy descent, through its own proper and natural channels. An attempt to disturb that course, and to force nature, will only bring on universal discontent, distress and confusion.</P>
<P>You tell me, Sir, that you prefer an union with Ireland to the little regula∣tions which are proposed in Parliament. This union is a great question of state, to which, when it comes properly be∣fore me in my parliamentary capacity, I shall give an honest and unprejudiced consideration. However, it is a settled rule with me, to make the most of my <HI>actual situation</HI>; and not to refuse to do a proper thing, because there is some∣thing else more proper, which I am not able to do. This union is a business of difficulty; and on the principles of your letter, a business impracticable. Until it can be matured into a feasible and desirable scheme, I wish to have as
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
close an union of interest and affection with Ireland, as I can have; and that, I am sure, is a far better thing than any nominal union of government.</P>
<P>France, and indeed most extensive empires, which by various designs and fortunes have grown into one great mass, contain many Provinces that are very different from each other in pri∣vileges and modes of government; and they raise their supplies in different ways; in different proportions; and under dif∣ferent authorities; yet none of them are for this reason, curtailed of their natu∣ral rights; but they carry on trade and manufactures with perfect equality. In some way or other the true balance is found; and all of them are properly poised and harmonised. How much have you lost by the participation of Scotland in all your commerce? The external trade of England has more than doubled
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
since that period; and I believe your internal (which is the most advantage∣ous) has been augmented at least four∣fold. Such virtue there is in liberality of sentiment, that you have grown richer even by the partnership of poverty.</P>
<P>If you think, that this participation was a loss, commercially considered, but that it has been compensated by the share which Scotland has taken in defraying the public charge—I believe you have not very carefully looked at the public accounts. Ireland, Sir, pays a great deal more than Scotland; and is perhaps as much, and as effectually united to England as Scotland is. But if Scot∣land, instead of paying little, had paid nothing at all, we should be gainers, not losers by acquiring the hearty co-opera∣tion of an active intelligent people, to∣wards the increase of the common stock; instead of our being employed in watch∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
and counteracting them, and their being employed in watching and coun∣teracting us, with the peevish and chur∣lish jealousy of rivals and enemies on both sides.</P>
<P>I am sure, Sir, that the commercial experience of the merchants of Bristol, will soon disabuse them of the preju∣dice, that they can trade no longer, if countries more lightly taxed, are per∣mitted to deal in the same commodities at the same markets. You know, that in fact, you trade very largely where you are met by the goods of all nations. You even pay high duties, on the im∣port of your goods, and afterwards un∣dersell nations less taxed, at their own markets; and where goods of the same kind are not charged at all. If it were otherwise, you could trade very little. You know, that the price of all sorts of manufacture is not a great deal in∣hanced,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
(except to the domestic con∣sumer) by any taxes paid in this country. This I might very easily prove.</P>
<P>The same consideration will relieve you from the apprehension you express, with relation to sugars, and the difference of the duties paid here and in Ireland. Those duties affect the interior consumer only; and for obvious reasons, rela∣tive to the interest of revenue itself, they must be proportioned to his ability of payment; but in all cases in which su∣gar can be an <HI>object of commerce,</HI> and therefore (in this view) of rivalship, you are sensible, that you are at least on a par with Ireland. As to your appre∣hensions concerning the more advan∣tageous situation of Ireland, for some branches of commerce, (for it is so but for some) I trust you will not find them more serious. Millford Haven, which is at your door, may serve to shew you,
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
that the mere advantage of ports is not the thing which shifts the seat of com∣merce from one part of the world to the other. If I thought you inclined to take up this matter on local con∣siderations, I should state to you, that I do not know any part of the king∣dom so well situated for an advantage∣ous commerce with Ireland as Bristol; and that none would be so likely to profit of its prosperity as our city. But your profit and theirs must concur. Beg∣gary and bankruptcy are not the cir∣cumstances which invite to an inter∣course with that or with any country; and I believe it will be found invariably true, that the superfluities of a rich na∣tion furnish a better object of trade than the necessities of a poor one. It is the interest of the commercial world that wealth should be found every where.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>The true ground of fear, in my opi∣nion is this; that Ireland, from the vi∣tious system of its internal polity, will be a long time before it can derive any benefit from the liberty now granted, or from any thing else. But as I do not vote advantages, in hopes that they may not be enjoyed, I will not lay any stress upon this consideration. I rather wish, that the Parliament of Ireland may, in its own wisdom, remove these impedi∣ments, and put their country in a con∣dition to avail itself of its natural ad∣vantages. If they do not, the fault is with them, and not with us.</P>
<P>I have written this long letter, in or∣der to give all possible satisfaction to my constituents with regard to the part I have taken in this affair. It gave me inexpressible concern to find, that my conduct had been a cause of uneasiness to any of them. Next to my honour
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
and conscience, I have nothing so near and dear to me as their approbation. However, I had much rather run the risque of displeasing than of injuring them;—if I am driven to make such an option. You obligingly lament, that you are not to have me for your advo∣cate; but if I had been capable of act∣ing as an advocate in opposition to a plan so perfectly consonant to my known principles, and to the opinions I had publicly declared on an hundred occa∣sions, I should only disgrace myself, without supporting with the smallest degree of credit or effect, the cause you wished me to undertake. I should have lost the only thing which can make such abilities as mine of any use to the world now or hereafter; I mean that autho∣rity which is derived from an opinion, that a member speaks the language of truth and sincerity; and that he is not
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
ready to take up or lay down a great political system for the convenience of the hour; that he is in parliament to support his opinion of the public good, and does not form his opinion in order to get into parliament, or to continue in it. It is in a great measure for your sake, that I wish to preserve this cha∣racter. Without it, I am sure, I should be ill able to discharge, by any service, the smallest part of that debt of grati∣tude and affection, which I owe you for the great and honourable trust you have reposed in me. I am, with the highest regard and esteem,</P>

<HEAD>COPY OF A LETTER TO Mess. ******* ****** and Co. Bristol.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me the most sensible con∣cern to find, that my vote on the resolutions relative to the trade of Ireland, has not been fortunate enough to meet with your approbation. I have explained at large the grounds of my conduct on that occasion in my letters to the Merchants Hall: but my very sincere regard and esteem for you will not permit me to let the matter pass without an explanation, which is par∣ticular to yourselves, and which, I hope, will prove satisfactory to you.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>You tell me, that the conduct of your late member is not much wondered at; but you seem to be at a loss to account for mine; and you lament, that I have taken so decided a part <HI>against</HI> my con∣stituents.</P>
<P>This is rather an heavy imputation. Does it then really appear to you, that the propositions, to which you refer, are, on the face of them, so manifestly wrong, and so certainly injurious to the trade and manufactures of Great Bri∣tain, and particularly to yours, that no man could think of proposing, or sup∣porting them, except from resentment to you, or from some other oblique mo∣tive? If you suppose your late mem∣ber, or if you suppose me, to act upon other reasons than we choose to avow, to what do you attribute the conduct of the <HI>other</HI> members, who in the begin∣ning almost unanimously adopted those
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
resolutions? To what do you attribute the strong part taken by the ministers, and along with the ministers, by seve∣ral of their most declared opponents? This does not indicate a ministerial jobb; a party design; or a provincial or local purpose. It is therefore not so absolutely clear, that the measure is wrong, or likely to be injurious to the true interests of any place, or any per∣son.</P>
<P>The reason, gentlemen, for taking this step, at this time, is but too obvious and too urgent. I cannot imagine, that you forget the great war, which has been carried on with so little success (and, as I thought, with so little policy) in America; or that you are not aware of the other great wars which are im∣pending. Ireland has been called upon to repel the attacks of enemies of no small power, brought upon her by coun∣cils,
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
in which she has had no share. The very purpose and declared object of that original war, which has brought other wars, and other enemies on Ire∣land, was not very flattering to her dig∣nity, her interest, or to the very prin∣ciple of her liberty. Yet she submitted patiently to the evils she suffered from an attempt to subdue to <HI>your</HI> obedience, countries whose very commerce was not open to her. America was to be con∣quered, in order that Ireland should <HI>not</HI> trade thither; whilst the miserable trade which she is permitted to carry on to other places has been torn to pieces in the struggle. In this situation, are we neither to suffer her to have any real in∣terest in our quarrel, or to be flattered with the hope of any future means of bearing the burthens which she is to incurr in defending herself against ene∣mies which we have brought upon her?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26"/>I cannot set my face against such ar∣guments. Is it quite fair to suppose, that I have no other motive for yield∣ing to them, but a desire of acting <HI>against</HI> my constituents? It is for <HI>you,</HI> and for <HI>your</HI> interest, as a dear, che∣rished, and respected part of a valuable whole, that I have taken my share in this question. You do not, you cannot suffer by it. If honesty be true policy with regard to the transient interest of individuals, it is much more certainly so with regard to the permanent inte∣rests of communities. I know, that it is but too natural for us to see our own <HI>certain</HI> ruin, in the <HI>possible</HI> prosperity of other people. It is hard to persuade us, that every thing which is <HI>got</HI> by another is not <HI>taken</HI> from ourselves. But it is fit, that we should get the better of these suggestions, which come from what is not the best and soundest
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
part of our nature, and that we should form to ourselves a way of thinking, more ra∣tional, more just, and more religious. Trade is not a limited thing; as if the objects of mutual demand and con∣sumption, could not stretch beyond the bounds of our jealousies. God has given the earth to the children of men, and he has undoubtedly, in giving it to them, given them what is abundantly sufficient for all their exigencies; not a scanty, but a most liberal provision for them all. The Author of our nature has written it strongly in that nature, and has promulgated the same law in his written word, that man shall eat his bread by his labour; and I am per∣suaded, that no man, and no combina∣tion of men, for their own ideas of their particular profit, can, without great impiety, undertake to say, that he <HI>shall not</HI> do so; that they have no
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
sort of right, either to prevent the la∣bour, or to withhold the bread. Ire∣land having received no <HI>compensation,</HI> directly or indirectly, for any restraints on their trade, ought not, in justice or common honesty, be made subject to such restraints. I do not mean to im∣peach the right of the parliament of Great Britain, to make laws for the trade of Ireland. I only speak of what laws it is right for Parliament to make.</P>
<P>It is nothing to an oppressed people, to say that in part they are protected at our charge. The military force which shall be kept up in order to cramp the na∣tural faculties of a people, and to pre∣vent their arrival to their utmost pros∣perity, is the instrument of their servi∣tude not the means of their protection. To protect men, is to forward, and not to restrain their improvement. Else, what is it more, than to avow to them,
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
and to the world, that you guard them from others, only to make them a prey to yourself. This fundamental nature of protection does not belong to free, but to all governments; and is as valid in Turkey as in Great Britain. No go∣vernment ought to own that it exists for the purpose of checking the prosperity of its people, or that there is such a principle involved in its policy.</P>
<P>Under the impression of these senti∣ments, (and not as wanting every at∣tention to my constituents, which af∣fection and gratitude could inspire,) I voted for these bills which give you so much trouble. I voted for them, not as doing complete justice to Ireland, but as being something less unjust than the general prohibition which has hi∣therto prevailed. I hear some discourse, as if in one or two paltry duties on mate∣rials, Ireland had a preference; and that
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
those who set themselves against this act of scanty justice, assert that they are only contending for an <HI>equality.</HI> What equality? Do they forget, that the whole woollen manufacture of Ire∣land, the most extensive and profitable of any, and the natural staple of that kingdom, has been in a manner so de∣stroyed by restrictive laws of ours, and (at our persuasion, and on our pro∣mises) by restrictive laws of <HI>their own,</HI> that in a few years, it is probable, they will not be able to wear a coat of their own fabric. Is this equality? Do gentlemen forget, that the understood faith upon which they were persuaded to such an unnatural act, has not been kept; but a linen-manufacture has been set up, and highly encouraged, against them? Is this equality? Do they for∣get the state of the trade of Ireland in beer, so great an article of consumption,
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
and which now stands in so mischievous a position with regard to their revenue, their manufacture, and their agricul∣ture? Do they find any equality in all this? Yet if the least step is taken to∣wards doing them common justice in the lightest articles for the most limited markets, a cry is raised, as if we were going to be ruined by partiality to Ire∣land.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I know that the defi∣ciency in these arguments is made up (not by you, but by others) by the usual resource on such occasions, the confi∣dence in military force, and superior power. But that ground of confidence, which at no time was perfectly just, or the avowal of it tolerably decent, is at this time very unseasonable. Late ex∣perience has shewn, that it cannot be altogether relied upon; and many, if not all our present difficulties, have
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
arisen from putting our trust in what may very possibly fail; and if it should fail, leaves those who are hurt by such a reliance, without pity. Whereas ho∣nesty and justice, reason and equity, go a very great way in securing prosperity to those who use them; and in case of failure, secure the best retreat, and the most honourable consolations.</P>
<P>It is very unfortunate, that we should consider those as rivals, whom we ought to regard as fellow-labourers in a com∣mon cause. Ireland has never made a single step in its progress towards prospe∣rity, by which you have not had a share, and perhaps the greatest share, in the benefit. That progress has been chief∣ly owing to her own natural advantages, and her own efforts, which, after a long time, and by slow degrees, have prevailed in some measure over the mis∣chievous systems which have been ad∣opted.
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Far enough she is still from having arrived even at an ordinary state of perfection; and if our jealousies were to be converted into politics, as syste∣matically as some would have them, the trade of Ireland would vanish out of the system of commerce. But, believe me, if Ireland is beneficial to you, it is so not from the parts in which it is re∣strained, but from those in which it is left free, though not left unrivalled. The greater its freedom, the greater must be your advantage. If you should lose in one way, you will gain in twenty.</P>
<P>Whilst I remain under this unalter∣able and powerful conviction, you will not wonder at the <HI>decided</HI> part I take. It is my custom so to do, when I see my way clearly before me; and when I know, that I am not misled by any pas∣sion, or any personal interest; which in this case, I am very sure, I am not. I
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
find that disagreeable things are circu∣lated among my constituents; and I wish my sentiments, which form my justification, may be equally general with the circulation against me. I have the honour to be, with the greatest re∣gard and esteem,</P>
