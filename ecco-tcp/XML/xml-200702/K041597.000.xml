<HEAD><HI>An EPISTLE to</HI> FLAVIA, On the Sight of two Pindarick Odes on the <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Vanity.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by a Lady her Friend.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FLAVIA, to you with Safety I commend,</L>
<L>This Verse, the secret Failing of your Friend.</L>
<L>To your Good-nature I securely trust,</L>
<L>Who know that to Conceal is to be just.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
The Muse, like wretched Maids by Love undone,</L>
<L>From Friends, Acquaintance, and the Light would run;</L>
<L>Conscious of Folly, fears attending Shame,</L>
<L>Fears the censorious World, and Loss of Fame.</L>
<L>Some Confident by chance she finds (tho' few</L>
<L>Pity the Fools, whom Love or Verse undo)</L>
<L>Whose fond Compassion sooths her in the Sin,</L>
<L>And sets her on to venture once again▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SURE, in the better Ages of old Time,</L>
<L>Nor Poetry nor Love was thought a Crime;</L>
<L>From Heav'n they both, the Gods best Gifts, were sent,</L>
<L>Divinely perfect both, and Innocent.</L>
<L>Then were bad Poets and loose Loves not known,</L>
<L>None felt a Warmth which they might blush to own.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Beneath cool Shades our happy Fathers lay,</L>
<L>And spent in pure untainted Joys the Day:</L>
<L>Artless their Loves, artless their Numbers were,</L>
<L>While Nature, simply did in both appear,</L>
<L>Nor could the Censor or the Critick fear.</L>
<L>Pleas'd to be pleas'd, they took what Heaven bestow'd,</L>
<L>Nor were too curious of the given Good.</L>
<L>At length, like <HI>Indians,</HI> fond of fancy'd Toys,</L>
<L>We lost being happy, to be thought more wise.</L>
<L>In one curst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, to punish Verse and Sin,</L>
<L>Criticks and Hang-men, both at once, came in;</L>
<L>Wit and the Laws had both the same ill Fate,</L>
<L>And partial Tyrants sway'd in either State:</L>
<L>Then a lewd Tide of Verse, with vicious Rage,</L>
<L>Broke in upon the Morals of the Age.</L>
<L>The Stage (whose Art was once the Mind to move</L>
<L>To Noble Daring, and to Virtuous Love)</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
Precept, with Pleasure mixt, no more profest,</L>
<L>But dealt in double-meaning Bawdy Jest:</L>
<L>The shocking Sounds offend the blushing Fair,</L>
<L>And drive 'em from the guilty Theatre.</L>
<L>Ye wretched Bards! from whom these Ills have sprung,</L>
<L>Whom the avenging Pow'rs have spar'd too long,</L>
<L>Well may you fear the Blow will surely come,</L>
<L>Your <HI>Sodom</HI> has no <HI>Ten</HI> t' avert its Doom;</L>
<L>Unless the Fair ARDELIA will alone</L>
<L>To Heav'n for all the guilty Tribe atone;</L>
<L>Nor can <HI>Tou Saints</HI> do more than such a <HI>One.</HI></L>
<L>Since she alone of the Poetick Crowd▪</L>
<L>To the false Gods of Wit has never bow'd;</L>
<L>The Empire, which she saves, shall own her Sway,</L>
<L>And all <HI>Parnassus</HI> her blest Laws obey.</L>

<L>SAY, from what Sacred Fountain, Nymph Di∣vine!</L>
<L>The Treasures flow, which in thy Verse do shine?</L>
<L>With what strange Inspiration art thou blest,</L>
<L>What more than <HI>Delphic</HI> Ardor warms thy Breast?</L>
<L>Our sordid Earth ne'er bred so bright a Flame,</L>
<L>But from the Skies, thy Kindred Skies it came.</L>
<L>To Numbers great like thine th'Angelick Quire</L>
<L>In Joyous Consort tune the Golden Lyre.</L>
<L>Viewing, with pitying Eyes, our Care's with thee,</L>
<L>They wisely own, that <HI>All is Vanity;</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n all the Joys which mortal Minds can know,</L>
<L>And find ARDELIA'S Verse the least vain thing below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF PINDAR'S Name to those blest Mansions reach,</L>
<L>And Mortal Muses may Immortal teach;</L>
<L>In Verse like His, the Heav'nly Nation raise</L>
<L>Their tuneful Voices to their Maker's Praise.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Nor shall Celestial Harmony disdain</L>
<L>For once to imitate an Earthly Strain,</L>
<L>Whose Fame, secure, no Rival e're can fear,</L>
<L>But those above, and fair ARDELIA here.</L>
<L>She, who undaunted, could his Raptures view,</L>
<L>And with bold Wings his Sacred Heights persue.</L>
<L>Safe thro' the <HI>Dithyrambick</HI> Stream she steer'd,</L>
<L>Nor the rough Deep in all its Dangers fear'd:</L>
<L>Not so the rest, who with successless Pain</L>
<L>Th' unnavigable Torrent try'd in vain.</L>
<L>So CLELIA leapt into the rapid Flood,</L>
<L>While the <HI>Etruscans</HI> struck with Wonder stood:</L>
<L>Amidst the Waves her rash Persuers dy'd,</L>
<L>The matchless Dame could only stem the Tide,</L>
<L>And gain the Glory of the farther Side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEE with what Pomp the Antick Masque comes in!</L>
<L>The various Forms of the Fantastick <HI>Spleen.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12" MS="y"/>
Vain empty Laughter, howling Grief and Tears,</L>
<L>False Joy, bred by false Hope, and falser Fears;</L>
<L>Each Vice, each Passion which pale Nature wears,</L>
<L>In this odd monstrous <HI>Medley</HI> mixt appears.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Bays</HI> his Dance, confus'dly round they run,</L>
<L>Statesman, Coquet, gay Fop, <HI>and</HI> pensive Nun,</L>
<L>Spectres <HI>and</HI> Heroes, Husbands <HI>and their</HI> Wives,</L>
<L>With <HI>Moukish-Drones</HI> that dream away their Lives.</L>
<L>Long have I labour'd with the dire Disease,</L>
<L>Nor found, but from ARDELIA's Numbers, Ease:</L>
<L>The dancing Verse runs thro' my sluggish Veins,</L>
<L>Where Dull and Cold the frozen Blood remains.</L>
<L>Pale Cares and anxious Thoughts give Way in haste,</L>
<L>And to returning Joy resign my Breast.</L>
<L>Then free from ev'ry Pain I did endure,</L>
<L>I bless the Charming Author of my Cure.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
So when to SAUL the great Musician play'd,</L>
<L>The sullen Fiend unwillingly obey'd,</L>
<L>And left the Monarch's Breast to seek some safer Shade.</L>

<LG>
<L>AS Some Brave <HI>Knight,</HI> who once with Spear and Shield</L>
<L>Had sought Renown in many a well∣fought Field,</L>
<L>But now no more with Sacred Fame inspir'd,</L>
<L>Was to a peaceful Hermitage retir'd;</L>
<L>There, if by Chance disastrous Tales he hears,</L>
<L>Of Matrons Wrongs, and captive Virgins Tears,</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
He feels soft Pity urge his Gen'rous Breast,</L>
<L>And vows once more, to succour the Distress'd.</L>
<L>Buckl'd in <HI>Mail</HI> he sallies on the Plain,</L>
<L>And turns him to the Feats of Arms again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO We, to former Leagues of Friendship true,</L>
<L>Have bid once more our peaceful Homes Adieu,</L>
<L>To aid old THOMAS, and to pleasure you.</L>
<L>Like Errant Damsels boldly we Engage,</L>
<L>Arm'd, as you see, for the Defenceless Stage.</L>
<L>Time was, when this Good Man no Help did lack,</L>
<L>And scorn'd that any <HI>She,</HI> should hold his Back;</L>
<L>But now, so Age and Frailty have ordain'd,</L>
<L>By <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle,</HI> clasp him round the Waste.</NOTE>two at once he's forc'd to be sustain'd.</L>
<L>You see, what failing Nature brings Man to;</L>
<L>And yet let none insult, for ought we know,</L>
<L>She may not wear so well with some of you.</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="37"/>
Tho' old, you find his Strength is not clean past,</L>
<L>But true as Steel, he's Mettle to the last.</L>
<L>If better he perform'd in Days of Yore,</L>
<L>Yet now he gives you all that's in his Pow'r;</L>
<L>What can the Youngest of you all do more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT he has been, tho' present Praise be dumb,</L>
<L>Shall haply be a Theme in Times to come,</L>
<L>As now we talk of ROSCIUS, and of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Had you with-held your Favours on this Night,</L>
<L>Old SHAKESPEAR'S Ghost had ris'n to do him Right.</L>
<L>With Indignation had you seen him frown</L>
<L>Upon a Worthless, Witless, Tastless Town;</L>
<L>Griev'd and repining, you had heard him say,</L>
<L>Why are the Muses Labours cast away?</L>
<L>Why did I write what only he could Play?</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="38"/>
But since, like Friends to Wit, thus throng'd you meet,</L>
<L>Go on, and make the Gen'rous Work compleat;</L>
<L>Be true to Merit, and still own his Cause,</L>
<L>Find something for him more than bare Applause.</L>
<L>In just Remembrance of your Pleasures past,</L>
<L>Be kind, and give him a Discharge at last.</L>
<L>In Peace and Ease Life's Remnant let him wear,</L>
