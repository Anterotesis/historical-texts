<P>THE unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine. After a tranquil and prosperous reign, the Conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman Empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding genera∣tions. The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the histo∣rian must be oppressed by their number and va∣riety,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time. He will describe the political in∣stitutions that gave strength and stability to the empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline. He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients, of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of the Christians, and their intestine discord, will sup∣ply copious and distinct materials both for edifi∣cation and for scandal.</P>
<P>After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Design of a new ca∣pital.</NOTE> his victorious rival proceeded to lay the founda∣tions of a city, destined to reign, in future times, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 324.</NOTE> the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire and religion of Constantine. The motives, whe∣ther of pride or of policy, which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors, and the habits of forty years. Rome was insensibly con∣founded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold in∣difference by a martial prince, born in the neigh∣bourhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain. The Italians, who had received Constantine as their deliverer, submis∣sively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes con∣descended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but they were seldom honoured with the presence of their new sovereign. During the vi∣gour
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
of his age, Constantine, according to the va∣rious exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity, or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his extensive dominions; and was al∣ways prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy. But as he gradu∣ally reached the summit of prosperity and the de∣cline of life, he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the con∣fines of Europe and Asia; to curb, with a power∣ful arm, the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With these views, Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church; and Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war against Licinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a soldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position of Byzantium; and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of Byzan∣tium.</NOTE> observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against an hostile attack, whilst it was acces∣sible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse. Many ages before Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of antiqui∣ty <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Polybius, l. iv. p. 423. edit. Casaubon. He observes that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently disturbed, and the extent of their territory contracted, by the inroads of the wild Thracians.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="11" MS="y"/>
had described the advantages of a situation, from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea, and the honours of a flourishing and independent republic <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The navigator Byzas, who was styled the son of Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the Christian Aera. His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara. Byzantium was afterwards rebuilt and fortified by the Spartan general Pausanias. See Scaliger Animadvers. ad Euseb. p. 81. Ducange Constantinopolis, l. i. part i. cap. 15, 16. With regard to the wars of the Byzantines against Philip, the Gauls, and the kings of Bithynia, we should trust none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatness of the imperial city had excited a spirit of flattery and fiction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Descrip∣tion of CON∣STANTI∣NOPLE.</NOTE> acquired with the august name of Constantinople, the figure of the imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle. The obtuse point, which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus. The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbour; and the southern is washed by the Propontis, or sea of Marmara. The basis of the triangle is opposed to the west, and terminates the continent of Europe. But the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample ex∣planation, be clearly or sufficiently understood.</P>
<P>The winding channel through which the waters <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bol∣phorus.</NOTE> of the Euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the Mediterranean, received the appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less cele∣brated
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
in the history, than in the fables, of an∣tiquity <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The Bosphorus has been very minutely described by Dionysius of Byzantium, who lived in the time of Domitian (Hudson Geo∣graph. Minor. tom. iii.), and by Gilles or Gyllius, a French tra∣veller of the XVIth century. Tournefort (Lettre XV.) seems to have used his own eyes and the learning of Gyllius.</NOTE>. A crowd of temples and of votive al∣tars, profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the devotion of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the Argonauts, explored the dan∣gers of the inhospitable Euxine. On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">There are very few conjectures so happy as that of Le Clerc (Bibliotheque Universelle, tom. i. p. 248.), who supposes that the harpies were only locusts. The Syriac or Phaenician name of those insects, their noisy flight, the stench and devastation which they oc∣casion, and the north wind which drives them into the sea, all con∣tribute to form this striking resemblance.</NOTE>; and of the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the Cestus <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The residence of Amycus was in Asia, between the old and the new castles, at a place called Laurus Insana. That of Phineus was in Europe, near the village of Mauromole and the Black Sea. See Gyllius de Bosph. l. ii. c. 23. Tournefort, Lettre XV.</NOTE>. The streights of the Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, according to the de∣scription of the poets, had once floated on the face of the waters; and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The deception was occasioned by several pointed rocks, alter∣nately covered and abandoned by the waves. At present there are two small islands, one towards either shore: that of Europe is dis∣tinguished by the column of Pompey.</NOTE>. From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbour of Byzantium, the
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
winding length of the Bosphorus extends about sixteen miles <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The ancients computed one hundred and twenty stadia, or fifteen Roman miles. They measured only from the new castles, but they carried the streights as far as the town of Chalcedon.</NOTE>, and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half. The <HI>new</HI> castles of Europe and Asia are construct∣ed, on either continent, upon the foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius. The <HI>old</HI> castles, a work of the Greek em∣perors, command the narrowest part of the chan∣nel, in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other. These fortresses were restored and strengthened by Ma∣homet the Second, when he meditated the siege of Constantinople <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ducas Hist. c. 34. Leunclavius Hist. Turcia Musulmanica, l. xv. p. 577. Under the Greek empire these castles were used as state prisons, under the tremendous name of Lethe, or towers of ob∣livion.</NOTE>: but the Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant, that near two thou∣sand years before his reign, Darius had chosen the same situation to connect the two continents by a bridge of boats <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Darius engraved in Greek and Assyrian letters on two marble columns, the names of his subject-nations, and the amazing num∣bers of his land and sea forces. The Byzantines afterwards trans∣ported these columns into the city, and used them for the altars of their tutelar deities. Herodotus, l. iv. c. 87.</NOTE>. At a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of Chryso∣polis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople. The Bosphorus, as it begins to open into the Propon∣tis, passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon. The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks,
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
a few years before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who overlooked the superior ad∣vantages of the opposite coast, has been stig∣matized by a proverbial expression of contempt <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Namque artissimo inter Europam Asiamque divortio Byzan∣tium in extremâ Europâ posuere Graeci, quibus, Pythium Apolli∣nem consulentibus ubi conderent urbem, redditum oraculum est, quaererent sedem <HI>caecorum</HI> terris adversam. Eâ ambage Chalcedonii monstrabantur, quòd priores illuc advecti, praevisâ locorum utilitate pejora legissent. Tacit. Annal. xii. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The harbour of Constantinople, which may be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The port.</NOTE> considered as an arm of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the <HI>Golden Horn.</HI> The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag, or, as it should seem, with more propriety, to that of an ox <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. x. p. 492. Most of the antlers are now broke off; or, to speak less figuratively, most of the recesses of the harbour are filled up. See Gyllius de Bosphoro Thracio, l. i. c. 5.</NOTE>. The epithet of <HI>golden</HI> was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople. The river Lycus, formed by the conflux of two little streams, pours into the harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to cleanse the bottom, and to invite the pe∣riodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess. As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas, the constant depth of the harbour allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats; and it has been observed, that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>

Many opulent senators of Rome, and of the Eastern provinces, were probably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own residence. The invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from commands; and the liberality of the emperor ob∣tained a ready and cheerful obedience.

In less than a cen∣tury, Constantinople disputed with Rome itself the pre-eminence of riches and numbers. New piles of buildings, crowded together with too little regard to health or convenience, scarcely al∣lowed the intervals of narrow streets for the per∣petual throng of men, of horses, and of carriages.

But when they lost even the sem∣blance of those virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom, the simplicity of Roman manners was insensibly corrupted by the stately affectation of the courts of Asia.

This multitude of abject dependents was interest∣ed in the support of the actual government, from the dread of a revolution, which might at once confound their hopes, and intercept the reward of their services. In this divine hierarchy (for such it is frequently styled), every rank was marked with the most scrupulous exactness, and its dignity was displayed in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies, which it was a study to learn, and a sacrilege to neglect <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">The emperor Gratian, after confirming a law of precedency published by Valentinian, the father of his <HI>Divinity,</HI> thus continues: Siquis igitur indebitum sibi locum usurpaverit, nulla se ignoratione defendat; sitque plane <HI>sacrilegii</HI> reus, qui <HI>divina</HI> praecepta neglexerit.

Some of these official ensigns were really exhibited in their hall of audience; others preceded their pompous march whenever they appeared in public; and every circumstance of their demeanour, their dress, their ornaments, and their train, was cal∣culated to inspire a deep reverence for the repre∣sentatives of supreme majesty.

The Patrician families, on the other hand, whose original number was never recruited till the end of the commonwealth, either failed in the ordinary course of nature, or were ex∣tinguished in so many foreign and domestic wars, or, through a want of merit or fortune, insensibly mingled with the mass of the people <NOTE N="95" PLACE="foot">In the year of Rome 800, very few remained, not only of the old Patrician families, but even of those which had been created by Caesar and Augustus.

Little more was left, when Constantine ascended the throne, than a vague and imperfect tradition, that the Patricians had once been the first of the Ro∣mans. To form a body of nobles, whose influ∣ence may restrain, while it secures the authority of the monarch, would have been very incon∣sistent with the character and policy of Constan∣tine; but had he seriously entertained such a de∣sign, it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify, by an arbitrary edict, an institu∣tion which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion. He revived, indeed, the title of PA∣TRICIANS, but he revived it as a personal, not as an hereditary distinction.

<P N="2">II. The fortunes of the Praetorian praefects <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prae∣torian prae∣fects.</NOTE> were essentially different from these of the consuls and patricians. The latter saw their ancient great∣ness evaporate in a vain title. The former, rising by degrees from the most humble condition, were invested with the civil and military administra∣tion of the Roman world. From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were intrusted to their superintend∣ing care; and, like the Vizirs of the East, they held with one hand the seal, and with the other the standard, of the empire. The ambition of the praefects, always formidable, and some∣times fatal to the masters whom they served, was supported by the strength of the Praetorian bands; but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian, and finally suppressed by Constantine, the praefects, who survived their fall, were reduced without difficulty to the sta∣tion of useful and obedient ministers. When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor's person, they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace. They were deprived by Constantine of all military com∣mand, as soon as they had ceased to lead into the
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
field, under their immediate orders, the flower of the Roman troops; and at length, by a singular revolution, the captains of the guards were trans∣formed into the civil magistrates of the provinces. According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian, the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect; and, after the monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine, he still continued to create the same number of FOUR PRAEFECTS, and entrusted to their care the same provinces which they already administered. 1. The praefect of the East stretched his ample juris∣diction into the three parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Per∣sia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, once acknow∣ledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the praefect of Italy was not con∣fined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and those of Tingitania. 4. The praefect of the Gauls com∣prehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the fort of Mount Atlas <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 109, 110.

After the Praetorian praefects had been dismissed from all military command, the civil functions which they were ordained to exercise over so many subject nations, were adequate to the am∣bition and abilities of the most consummate mi∣nisters. To their wisdom was committed the su∣preme administration of justice and of the finances, the two objects which, in a state of peace, com∣prehend almost all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the share of their property which is required for the expences of the state. The coin, the highways, the posts, the granaries, the manufactures, whatever could interest the public prosperity, was moderated by the authority of the Praetorian praefects. As the immediate representatives of the Imperial ma∣jesty, they were empowered to explain, to enforce, and on some occasions to modify, the general edicts by their discretionary proclamations. They watched over the conduct of the provincial go∣vernors, removed the negligent, and inflicted punishments on the guilty. From all the inferior jurisdictions, an appeal in every matter of im∣portance, either civil or criminal, might be brought before the tribunal of the praefect: but <HI>his</HI> sentence was final and absolute; and the em∣perors themselves refused to admit any complaints against the judgment or the integrity of a magi∣strate

Their vigilance ensured the three principal objects of a regular police, safety, plenty, and cleanliness; and as a proof of the attention of government to preserve the splendour and ornaments of the capi∣tal, a particular inspector was appointed for the statues; the guardian, as it were, of that inani∣mate people, which, according to the extrava∣gant computation of an old writer, was scarcely inferior in number to the living inhabitants of Rome.

It may be sufficient for the histo∣rian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to restrain the abuse of authority. 1. For the preservation of peace and order, the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice. They inflicted corporal punishments, and they exercised, in capital offences, the power of life and death. But they were not authorised to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution, or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honourable kind of exile. These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces <NOTE N="114" PLACE="foot">The presidents, or consulars, could impose only two ounces; the vice-praefects, three; the proconsuls, count of the east, and praefect of Egypt, six. See Heineccii Jur. Civil. tom. i. p. 75. Pandect. l. xlviii. tit. xix. n. 8. Cod. Justinian. l. i. tit. liv. leg. 4. 6.</NOTE>. This distinction, which seems to grant the larger, while it denies the smaller degree of authority, was founded on a very rational motive. The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse. The passions of a provincial magistrate might fre∣quently provoke him into acts of oppression,
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject; though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood. It may likewise be considered, that exile, considerable fines, or the choice of an easy death, relate more particu∣larly to the rich and the noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate, were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect. 2. As it was reasonably apprehended that the inte∣grity of the judge might be biassed, if his interest was concerned, or his affections were engaged; the strictest regulations were established, to ex∣clude any person, without the special dispensa∣tion of the emperor, from the government of the province where he was born <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot">Ut nulli patriae suae administratio sine speciali principis permissu permittatur.

of Phoenicia; which flourished above three cen∣turies from the time of Alexander Severus, the author perhaps of an institution so advantageous to his native country. After a regular course of education, which lasted five years, the students dispersed themselves through the provinces, in search of fortune and honours; nor could they want an inexhaustible supply of business in a great empire, already corrupted by the multiplicity of laws, of arts, and of vices. The court of the Praetorian praefect of the east could alone furnish employment for one hundred and fifty advocates, sixty-four of whom were distinguished by peculiar privileges, and two were annually chosen with a salary of sixty pounds of gold, to defend the causes of the treasury. The first experiment was made of their judicial talents, by appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates; from thence they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which they had pleaded. They obtained the government of a province; and, by the aid of merit, of reputation, or of fa∣vour, they ascended, by successive steps, to the <HI>illustrious</HI> dignities of the state <NOTE N="121" PLACE="foot">As in a former period I have traced the civil and military pro∣motion of Pertinax, I shall here insert the civil honours of Mallius Theodorus. 1.

Others, recluse in their chambers, main∣tained the dignity of legal professors, by furnish∣ing a rich client with subtleties to confound the plainest truth, and with arguments to colour the most unjustifiable pretensions.

revenue, the authority of law, and the command of a military force, concurred to render their power supreme and absolute; and whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance, the loyal province which they involved in their rebellion, was scarcely sensible of any change in its political state. From the time of Commodus to the reign of Constantine, near one hundred governors might be enumerated, who, with various success, erected the standard of revolt; and though the innocent were too often sacrificed, the guilty might be sometimes prevented, by the suspicious cruelty of their master <NOTE N="125" PLACE="foot">The Abbé Dubos, who has examined with accuracy (see Hist. de la Monarchie Françoise, tom. i. p. 41—100. edit. 1741.) the institutions of Augustus and of Constantine, observes, that if Otho had been put to death the day before he executed his conspiracy, Otho would now appear in history as innocent as Corbulo.</NOTE>. To secure his throne and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants, Constantine resolved to divide the mili∣tary from the civil administration; and to esta∣blish, as a permanent and professional distinction, a practice which had been adopted only as an oc∣casional expedient.

Their number was soon doubled by the division of the east and west; and as sepa∣rate generals of the same rank and title were ap∣pointed on the four important frontiers of the Rhine, of the Upper and the Lower Danube, and of the Euphrates, the defence of the Roman em∣pire was at length committed to eight masters ge∣neral of the cavalry and infantry. Under their orders, thirty-five military commanders were sta∣tioned in the provinces: three in Britain, six in Gaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five on the Upper, and four on the Lower Danube; in Asia eight, three in Egypt, and four in Africa.

All these provincial generals were therefore <HI>dukes;</HI> but no more than ten among them were dignified with the rank of <HI>counts</HI> or companions, a title of honour, or rather of fa∣vour, which had been recently invented in the
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
court of Constantine. A gold belt was the en∣sign which distinguished the office of the counts and dukes; and besides their pay, they received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred and ninety servants, and one hun∣dred and fifty-eight horses. They were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which related to the administration of justice or the re∣venue; but the command which they exercised over the troops of their department, was inde∣pendent of the authority of the magistrates. About the same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order, he instituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers. The emulation, and sometimes the discord, which reigned between two professions of opposite interests and incom∣patible manners, was productive of beneficial and of pernicious consequences. It was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the dis∣turbance, or should unite for the service, of their country. While the one delayed to offer the as∣sistance which the other disdained to solicit, the troops very frequently remained without orders or without supplies; the public safety was be∣trayed, and the defenceless subjects were left ex∣posed to the fury of the Barbarians. The divided administration, which had been formed by Con∣stantine, relaxed the vigour of the state, while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch.</P>
<P>The memory of Constantine has been deserved∣ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of the troops.</NOTE> censured for another innovation which cor∣rupted

military discipline, and prepared the ruin of the empire. The nineteen years which pre∣ceded his final victory over Licinius, had been a period of license and intestine war. The rivals who contended for the possession of the Roman world, had withdrawn the greatest part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier; and the principal cities which formed the boun∣dary of their respective dominions were filled with soldiers, who considered their countrymen as their most implacable enemies. After the use of these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war, the conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian, and to suppress a fatal indulgence, which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military or∣der.

The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters. The soldiers insensibly forgot the vir∣tues of their profession, and contracted only the
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
vices of civil life. They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades, or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres. They soon be∣came careless of their martial exercises, curious in their diet and apparel; and while they inspired terror to the subjects of the empire, they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">Ferox erat in suos miles et rapax, ignavus vero in hostes et fractus.

The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers, was no longer maintained with the same care, or defended with the same vigilance. The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier, might be suf∣ficient for the ordinary defence. But their spirit was degraded by the humiliating reflection, that <HI>they</HI> who were exposed to the hardships and dan∣gers of a perpetual warfare, were rewarded only with about two-thirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court. Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy favourites, were in some measure disgraced by the title of honour which they were allowed to assume. It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who should dare to desert their colours, to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians, or to

The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities: and though succeeding princes laboured to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons, the empire, till the last moment of its dissolution, continued to languish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly inflicted by the hand of Constantine.</P>
<P>The same timid policy, of dividing whatever is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduction of the legions.</NOTE> united, of reducing whatever is eminent, of dread∣ing every active power, and of expecting that the most feeble will prove the most obedient, seems to pervade the institutions of several princes, and particularly those of Constantine. The martial pride of the legions, whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion, was nou∣rished by the memory of their past exploits, and the consciousness of their actual strength. As long as they maintained their ancient establish∣ment of six thousand men, they subsisted, under the reign of Diocletian, each of them singly, a visible and important object in the military his∣tory of the Roman empire. A few years after∣wards, these gigantic bodies were shrunk to a very diminutive size; and when <HI>seven</HI> legions, with some auxiliaries, defended the city of Amida against the Persians, the total garrison, with the

The remainder of their troops was distributed into several hundred cohorts of insantry, and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms, and titles, and ensigns, were calcu∣lated to inspire terror, and to display the variety of nations who marched under the imperial stan∣dard.

The resources of the Roman trea∣sury were exhausted by the encrease of pay, by the repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new emoluments and indulgences, which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, might com∣pensate the hardships and dangers of a military life.

although slaves, at least by a tacit connivance, were indiscriminately received into the ranks, the insurmountable difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and coercive methods.

profitable to defend than to ravage the provinces, were enrolled, not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations, but in the legions themselves, and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops. As they freely mingled with the sub∣jects of the empire, they gradually learned to despise their manners, and to imitate their arts. They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of Rome had exacted from their ignorance, while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she support∣ed her declining greatness. The Barbarian sol∣diers who displayed any military talents, were advanced, without exception, to the most im∣portant commands; and the names of the tri∣bunes, of the counts and dukes, and of the gene∣rals themselves, betray a foreign origin, which they no longer condescended to disguise. They were often entrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen; and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood, they did not always avoid the guilt, or at least the suspicion, of holding a treasonable cor∣respondence with the enemy, of inviting his in∣vasion, or of sparing his retreat. The camps, and the palace of the son of Constantine, were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks, who preserved the strictest connection with each other, and with their country, and who resented every personal affront as a national indignity <NOTE N="140" PLACE="foot">Malarichus-adhibitis Francis quorum ea tempestate in pa∣latio multitudo florebat, erectius jam loquebatur tumultuabaturque.

When the tyrant Caligula was suspected of an in∣tention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the consular robes, the sacrilegious profana∣tion would have scarcely excited less astonish∣ment, if, instead of a horse, the noblest chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his choice. The revolution of three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the preju∣dices of the people, that, with the public appro∣bation, Constantine shewed his successors the ex∣ample of bestowing the honours of the consulship on the barbarians, who, by their merit and ser∣vices, had deserved to be ranked among the first of the Romans <NOTE N="141" PLACE="foot">Barbaros omnium primus, ad usque fasces auxerat et trabeas consulares.

The private apartments of the palace were governed by a favourite eunuch, who, in the language of that age, was styled the <HI>praepo∣situs</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cham∣berlain.</NOTE> or praefect of the sacred bed-chamber. His duty was to attend the emperor in his hours of state, or in those of amusement, and to perform about his person all those menial services, which can only derive their splendor from the influence of royalty. Under a prince who deserved to reign, the great chamberlain (for such we may call him) was an useful and humble domestic; but an artful domestic, who improves every occasion of unguarded confidence, will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can seldom ob∣tain. The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius, who were invisible to their subjects, and con∣temptible to their enemies, exalted the praefects of their bed-chamber above the heads of all the ministers of the palace <NOTE N="142" PLACE="foot">Cod.

The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four <HI>scrinia,</HI> or offices of this minister of state. The first was appropriated to memorials, the second to epistles, the third to petitions, and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind. Each of these was directed by an inferior <HI>master</HI> of <HI>respectable</HI> dignity, and the whole busi∣ness was dispatched by an hundred and forty-eight secretaries, chosen for the most part from the profession of the law, on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which fre∣quently

occurred in the exercise of their several functions. From a condescension, which in for∣mer ages would have been esteemed unworthy of the Roman majesty, a particular secretary was al∣lowed for the Greek language; and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the Barbarians: but the department of foreign affairs, which constitutes so essential a part of modern po∣licy, seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices. His mind was more seriously en∣gaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire. There were thirty-four cities, fifteen in the east, and nineteen in the west, in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive ar∣mour, offensive weapons of all sorts, and military engines, which were deposited in the arsenals, and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops. 3. In the course of nine centuries, the office of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The quae∣stor.</NOTE> <HI>quaestor</HI> had experienced a very singular revolu∣tion.

But this obscure point of antiquity is contested by other writers.</NOTE>; a similar assistant was granted to every proconsul, and to every praetor, who exercised a military or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the two quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four,

Yet the augmentation which he made of praetors subsisted under the succeeding reigns.</NOTE>; and the noblest citizens ambi∣tiously solicited an office which gave them a seat in the senate, and a just hope of obtaining the ho∣nours of the republic. Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the freedom of election, he consented to accept the annual privilege of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain propor∣tion of candidates; and it was his custom to select one of these distinguished youths, to read his ora∣tions or epistles in the assemblies of the senate <NOTE N="147" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in August. c. 65. and Torrent. ad loc.

subjects, whose dangerous situation was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those advantages, either of nature or of fortune, which exposed them to the jealousy of the monarch.

But this reflection, which would tend to alleviate the miseries of despotism, is contradicted at least by the history of the Roman empire; which accuses the same princes of despoiling the senate of its authority, and the provinces of their wealth.

The emperor subscribed with his own hand, and in purple ink, the solemn edict, or indiction, which was fixed up in the principal city of each diocese, during two months previous to the first day of September. And, by a very easy connection of ideas, the word <HI>indiction</HI> was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed, and to the annual term which it al∣lowed for the payment. This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and ima∣ginary wants of the state; but as often as the ex∣pence exceeded the revenue, or the revenue fell short of the computation, an additional tax, under the name of <HI>superindiction,</HI> was imposed on the people, and the most valuable attribute of sove∣reignty was communicated to the Praetorian prae∣fects, who, on some occasions, were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exi∣gencies of the public service. The execution of these laws (which it would be tedious to pursue in
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
their minute and intricate detail) consisted of two distinct operations; the resolving the general im∣position into its constituent parts, which were as∣sessed on the provinces, the cities, and the indivi∣duals of the Roman world; and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals, the cities, and the provinces, till the accumulated sums were poured into the Imperial treasuries. But as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open, and as the renewal of the de∣mand anticipated the perfect discharge of the pre∣ceding obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution. Whatever was honourable or important in the administration of the revenue, was committed to the wisdom of the praefects, and their provincial representatives; the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers, some of whom depended on the treasurer, others on the governor of the province; and who, in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction, had frequent opportu∣nities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people. The laborious offices, which could be productive only of envy and reproach, of expence and danger, were imposed on the <HI>Decurions,</HI> who formed the corporations of the cities, and whom the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the burthens of civil society <NOTE N="172" PLACE="foot">The title concerning the Decurions (l. xii. tit. i.) is the most ample in the whole Theodosian Code; since it contains not less than one hundred and ninety-two distinct laws to ascertain the duties and privileges of that useful order of citizens.</NOTE>.

The lands were measured by surveyors, who were sent into the provinces; their nature, whether arable or pasture, or vine∣yards or woods, was distinctly reported; and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years. The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential part of the report; an oath was administered to the proprietors, which bound them to disclose the true state of their affairs; and their attempts to pre∣varicate, or elude the intention of the legislator, were severely watched, and punished as a capital crime, which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege <NOTE N="174" PLACE="foot">Siquis sacrilegâ vitem falce succiderit, aut feracium Ramorum foetus hebetaverit, quo declinet fidem Censuum, et mentiatur callide paupertatis ingenium, mox detectus capitale subibit exitium, et bona ejus in Fisci jura migrabunt.

The remainder of the taxes, according to the pro∣portions determined by the annual indiction, was furnished in a manner still more direct, and still more oppressive. According to the different na∣ture of lands, their real produce, in the various articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, wood or iron, was transported by the labour or at the ex∣pence of the provincials to the Imperial maga∣zines, from whence they were occasionally distri∣buted, for the use of the court, of the army, and of the two capitals, Rome and Constantinople. The commissioners of the revenue were so fre∣quently obliged to make considerable purchases, that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation, or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind. In the primitive simplicity of small com∣munities, this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people; but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness, which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud <NOTE N="176" PLACE="foot">Some precautions were taken (see Cod.

Roman provinces was insensibly ruined, and, in the progress of despotism, which tends to disap∣point its own purpose, the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts, or the remission of tributes, which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying. Ac∣cording to the new division of Italy, the fertile and happy province of Campania, the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retire∣ments of the citizens of Rome, extended between the sea and the Appenine from the Tyber to the Silarus. Within sixty years after the death of Constantine, and on the evidence of an actual survey, an exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and thirty thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land; which amount∣ed to one-eighth of the whole surface of the pro∣vince. As the footsteps of the Barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing desolation, which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the administration, of the Roman emperors <NOTE N="177" PLACE="foot">Cod.

The returns which were sent of every province or district, expressed the number of tributary sub∣jects, and the amount of the public impositions. The latter of these sums was divided by the for∣mer; and the estimate, that such a province con∣tained so many <HI>capita,</HI> or heads of tribute; and that each <HI>head</HI> was rated at such a price, was uni∣versally received, not only in the popular, but even in the legal computation. The value of a tributary head must have varied, according to many accidental, or at least fluctuating circum∣stances; but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact, the more important, since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman empire, and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the European kingdoms. The rapacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-five pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head. The humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces <NOTE N="179" PLACE="foot">Quid profuerit <HI>(Julianus)</HI> anhelantibus extremâ penuriâ Gallis, hinc maxime claret, quod primitus partes eas ingressus, pro <HI>capitibus</HI> singulis tributi nomine vicenos quinos aureos reperit flagitari; dis∣cedens vero septenos tantum munera universa complentes.

or about nine pounds sterling, the common stand∣ard perhaps of the impositions of Gaul <NOTE N="180" PLACE="foot">In the calculation of any sum of money under Constantine and his successors, we need only refer to the excellent discourse of Mr. Greaves on the Denarius, for the proof of the following prin∣ciples: 1. That the ancient and modern Roman pound, containing 5256 grains of Troy weight, is about one twelfth lighter than the English pound, which is composed of 5760 of the same grains. 2. That the pound of gold, which had once been divided into forty∣eight <HI>aurei,</HI> was at this time coined into seventy-two smaller pieces of the same denomination. 3. That five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver, and that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of silver, ac∣cording to the Roman, or about thirteen pounds according to the English, weight. 4. That the English pound of silver is coined into sixty-two shillings. From these elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold, the usual method of reckoning large sums, at forty pounds sterling; and we may fix the currency of the <HI>aureus</HI> at somewhat more than eleven shillings.</NOTE>. But this calculation, or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced, cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind, who will be at once surprised by the <HI>equality,</HI> and by the <HI>enor∣mity</HI> of the capitation. An attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect some light on the inte∣resting subject of the finances of the declining empire.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and main∣tains so unequal a division of property, the most numerous part of the community would be de∣prived of their subsistence, by the equal assess∣ment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue. Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation; but in the practice, this unjust equality was no longer
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
felt, as the tribute was collected on the principle of a <HI>real,</HI> not of a <HI>personal</HI> imposition. Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single <HI>head,</HI> or share of taxation; while the wealthy pro∣vincial, in proportion to his fortune, alone repre∣sented several of those imaginary beings. In a poetical request, addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the Roman Princes who reign∣ed in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the Geryon of the Grecian fables, and intreats the new Hercules that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads <NOTE N="181" PLACE="foot"><L>Geryones nos esse puta, monstrumque tributum,</L>

The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet; but if he had pursued the allusion, he must have painted many of the Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading over the face of the country, and devouring the substance of an hun∣dred families. II. The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country, as it is now go∣verned by the absolute monarch of an industrious, wealthy and affectionate people. The taxes of France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
flattery, beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling, which ought perhaps to be shared among four-and-twenty millions of inha∣bitants <NOTE N="182" PLACE="foot">This assertion, however formidable it may seem, is founded on the original registers of births, deaths, and marriages, collected by public authority, and now deposited in the <HI>Contrôle General</HI> at Paris. The annual average of births throughout the whole kingdom, taken in five years (from 1770 to 1774, both inclusive) is, 479, 649 boys, and 449, 269 girls, in all 928, 918 children. The province of French Hainault alone furnishes 9906 births: and we are assured, by an actual numeration of the people annually repeated from the year 1773 to the year 1776, that, upon an average, Hainault con∣tains 257,097 inhabitants. By the rules of fair analogy, we might infer, that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people, is about 1 to 26; and that the kingdom of France contains 24, 151, 868 persons of both sexes and of every age. If we content ourselves with the more moderate proportion of 1 to 25, the whole population will amount to 23, 222, 950. From the diligent researches of the French government (which are not unworthy of our own imi∣tation), we may hope to obtain a still greater degree of certainty on this important subject.</NOTE>. Seven millions of these, in the ca∣pacity of fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the obligations of the remaining multi∣tude of women and children; yet the equal pro∣portion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money, instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable, which was regularly imposed on their Gallic an∣cestors. The reason of this difference may be found, not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver, as in the different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern France. In a country where personal freedom is the pri∣vilege of every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are levied on property or on con∣sumption, may be fairly divided among the whole

In such a state the poor were maintained at the expence of the masters, who enjoyed the fruits of their la∣bour; and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honourable, or at least of a decent subsistence, the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation. The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example: The Aedui, one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or <HI>cities</HI> of Gaul, occupied an extent of ter∣ritory, which now contains above five hundred thousand inhabitants, in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers <NOTE N="184" PLACE="foot">The ancient jurisdiction of <HI>(Augustodunum)</HI> Autun in Bur∣gundy, the capital of the Aedui, comprehended the adjacent ter∣ritory of <HI>(Noviodunum)</HI> Nevers.

The registers of births, taken during eleven years, in 476 parishes of the same province of Burgundy, and multiplied by the moderate pro∣portion of 25 (see Messance Recherches sur la Population, p. 142.), may authorise us to assign an average number of 656 persons for each parish, which being again multiplied by the 770 parishes of the dioceses of Nevers and Autun, will produce the sum of 505, 120 persons for the extent of country which was once possessed by the Aedui.</NOTE>; and with the

This accession of territory might be justified by very specious reasons. 1. Châlons and Maçon were undoubtedly within the original juris∣diction of the Aedui. (See d'Anville Notice, p. 187. 443.) 2. In the Notitia of Gaul, they are enumerated not as <HI>Civitates,</HI> but mere∣ly as <HI>Costra.</HI> 3. They do not appear to have been episcopal seats before the fifth and sixth centuries. Yet there is a passage in Eume∣nius (Panegyr. Vet. viii. 7.) which very forcibly deters me from ex∣tending the territory of the Aedui in the reign of Constantine, along the beautiful banks of the navigable Saône.</NOTE>, the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls. In the time of Con∣stantine, the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than twenty-five thousand <HI>heads</HI> of capita∣tion, of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tri∣bute <NOTE N="186" PLACE="foot">Eumenius in Panegyr.

The exactions of Constantius may be calculated at seven millions sterling, which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101"/>
But this tax, or capitation, on the proprietors of land, would have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to escape. With the view <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capitation on trade and in∣dustry.</NOTE> of sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labour, and which exists in money or in merchandise, the emperors imposed a dis∣tinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects <NOTE N="188" PLACE="foot">See Cod. Theod. l. xiii. tit. i. and iv.</NOTE>. Some exemptions, very strictly confined both in time and place, were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates. Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts: but every other branch of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the law. The honourable mer∣chant of Alexandria, who imported the gems and spices of India for the use of the western world; the usurer, who derived from the interest of mo∣ney a silent and ignominious profit; the inge∣nious manufacturer, the diligent mechanic, and even the most obscure retailer of a sequestered village, were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnership of their gain: and the sovereign of the Roman empire, who tolerated the profession, consented to share the infamous salary, of public prostitutes. As this general tax upon industry was collected every fourth year, it was styled the <HI>Lustral Contribution:</HI> and the histo∣rian Zosimus <NOTE N="189" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. ii. p. 115. There is probably as much passion and prejudice in the attack of Zosimus, as in the elaborate defence of the memory of Constantine by the zealous Dr. Howell. Hist. of the World, vol. ii. p. 20.</NOTE> laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the tears and ter∣rors
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
of the citizens, who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most ab∣horred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property had been assessed. The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be justi∣fied from the charge of passion and prejudice, but, from the nature of this tribute, it seems reason∣able to conclude that it was arbitrary in the dis∣tribution, and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting. The secret wealth of commerce, and the precarious profits of art or labour, are suscep∣tible only of a discretionary valuation, which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the trea∣sury; and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security, the pay∣ment of the imposition, which, in the case of a land-tax, may be obtained by the seizure of pro∣perty, can rarely be extorted by any other means than those of corporal punishments. The cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state, is attested, and was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of Constantine, who, disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges, allots a spacious and airy prison for the place of their confine∣ment <NOTE N="190" PLACE="foot">Cod. Theod. l. xi. tit. vii. leg. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute authority of the monarch; but the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Free gifts.</NOTE> occasional offerings of the <HI>coronary gold</HI> still re∣tained the name and semblance of popular con∣sent. It was an ancient custom that the allies of the republic, who ascribed their safety or deliver∣ance

to the success of the Roman arms; and even the cities of Italy, who admired the virtues of their victorious general, adorned the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold, which, after the ceremony, were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter, to remain a lasting monu∣ment of his glory to future ages. The progress of zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number, and increased the size, of these popular donations; and the triumph of Caesar was enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twenty-two massy crowns, whose weight amounted to twenty thou∣sand four hundred and fourteen pounds of gold. This treasure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator, who was satisfied that it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods: his example was imitated by his suc∣cessors; and the custom was introduced, of ex∣changing these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of the empire <NOTE N="191" PLACE="foot">See Lipsius de Magnitud. Romana, l. ii. c. 9. The Tarra∣gonese Spain presented the emperor Claudius with a crown of gold of seven, and Gaul with another of nine <HI>hundred</HI> pounds weight.

The spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty; and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph, it was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy, as often as the emperor condescended to announce his accession, his consulship, the birth of a son, the creation of a Caesar, a victory over the Barbarians, or any other real or imaginary event which graced the

annals of his reign. The peculiar free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at sixteen hundred pounds of gold, or about sixty-four thousand pounds sterling.

<P>A people elated by pride, or soured by dis∣content, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu∣sion.</NOTE> are seldom qualified to form a just esti∣mate of their actual situation. The subjects of Constantine were incapable of discerning the de∣cline of genius and manly virtue, which so far degraded them below the dignity of their an∣cestors; but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny, the relaxation of discipline, and the encrease of taxes. The impartial historian, who acknowledges the justice of their complaints, will observe some favourable circumstances which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition. The threatening tempest of Barbarians, which so soon subverted the foundations of Roman great∣ness, was still repelled, or suspended, on the fron∣tiers. The arts of luxury and literature were cultivated, and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe. The forms, the pomp, and the expence of the civil administration contri∣buted to restrain the irregular licence of the sol∣diers; and although the laws were violated by

power, or perverted by subtlety, the sage prin∣ciples of the Roman jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity, unknown to the despo∣tic governments of the east.

<P>THE character of the prince who removed the seat of empire, and introduced such important changes into the civil and religious <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Con∣stantine.</NOTE> constitution of his country, has fixed the atten∣tion, and divided the opinions, of mankind. By the grateful zeal of the Christians, the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every at∣tribute of a hero, and even of a saint; while the discontent of the vanquished party has compared Constantine to the most abhorred of those tyrants, who, by their vice and weakness, dishonoured the Imperial purple. The same passions have in some degree been perpetuated to succeeding ge∣nerations, and the character of Constantine is con∣sidered, even in the present age, as an object either of satire or of panegyric. By the impar∣tial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest admirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable ene∣mies, we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man, which the truth and candour of history should adopt without a
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
blush <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">On ne se trompera point sur Constantin, en croyant tout le mal qu'en dit Eusebe, et tout le bien qu'en dit Zosime. Fleury Hist. Ecclesiastique, tom. iii. p. 233. Eusebius and Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective. The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers, whose character or situation variously tempered the influence of their religious zeal.</NOTE>. But it would soon appear, that the vain at∣tempt to blend such discordant colours, and to re∣concile such inconsistent qualities, must produce a figure monstrous rather than human, unless it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights, by a care∣ful separation of the different periods of the reign of Constantine.</P>
<P>The person, as well as the mind of Constan∣tine, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His vir∣tues.</NOTE> had been enriched by nature with her choicest endowments. His stature was lofty, his coun∣tenance majestic, his deportment graceful; his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise, and from his earliest youth, to a very advanced season of life, he preserved the vi∣gour of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance. He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation; and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station, the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him. The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected; yet he shewed, on some occasions, that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment. The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
of the value of learning; and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine. In the dispatch of business, his diligence was indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading, writing, or meditating, in giving audience to ambassadors, and in examin∣ing the complaints of his subjects. Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge, that he possessed mag∣nanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the most arduous designs, without being checked either by the prejudices of education, or by the clamours of the multitude. In the field, he in∣fused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whom he conducted with the talents of a con∣summate general; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic. He loved glory, as the re∣ward, perhaps as the motive, of his labours. The boundless ambition, which, from the mo∣ment of his accepting the purple at York, ap∣pears as the ruling passion of his soul, may be justified by the dangers of his own situation, by the character of his rivals, by the consciousness of superior merit, and by the prospect that his suc∣cess would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire. In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius, he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people, who com∣pared the undissembled vices of those tyrants, with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
to direct the general tenor of the administration of Constantine <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The virtues of Constantine are collected for the most part from Eutropius, and the younger Victor, two sincere pagans, who wrote after the extinction of his family. Even Zosimus, and the <HI>Emperor</HI> Julian, acknowledge his personal courage and military achievements.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His vices.</NOTE> Tyber, or even in the plains of Hadrianople, such is the character which, with a few excep∣tions, he might have transmitted to posterity. But the conclusion of his reign (according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age) degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the Roman princes <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Eutropius x. 6. In primo Imperii tempore optimis princi∣pibus, ultimo mediis comparandus. From the ancient Greek ver∣sion of Poeanius (edit. Havercamp. p. 697.), I am inclined to sus∣pect that Eutropius had originally written <HI>vix</HI> mediis; and that the offensive monosyllable was dropped by the wilful inadvertency of transcribers. Aurelius Victor expresses the general opinion by a vulgar and indeed obscure proverb. <HI>Trachala</HI> decem annis praestan∣tissimus; duodecim sequentibus <HI>latro;</HI> decem novissimis <HI>pupillus</HI> ob immodicas profusiones.</NOTE>. In the life of Augustus, we behold the tyrant of the republic, converted, almost by imperceptible degrees, into the father of his country and of human kind. In that of Constantine, we may contemplate a hero, who had so long inspired his subjects with love, and his enemies with terror, degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch, corrupted by his fortune, or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissi∣mulation. The general peace which he main∣tained during the last fourteen years of his reign, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 323—337.</NOTE>
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
was a period of apparent splendor rather than of real prosperity; and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcileable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality. The ac∣cumulated treasures found in the palaces of Max∣entius and Licinius, were lavishly consumed; the various innovations introduced by the conqueror, were attended with an encreasing expence; the cost of his buildings, his court, and his festivals, required an immediate and plentiful supply; and the oppression of the people was the only fund which could support the magnificence of the sovereign <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Julian.

In such apparel, scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch, and the simplicity of a Roman veteran <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Julian, in the Caesars, attempts to ridicule his uncle. His suspicious testimony is confirmed however by the learned Spanheim, with the authority of medals (See Commentaire, p. 156. 299. 397. 459.). Eusebius (Orat. c. 5.) alleges, that Constantine dressed for the public, not for himself. Were this admitted, the vainest cox∣comb could never want an excuse.</NOTE>. A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence, was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion, and dares to forgive. The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy, as they are taught in the schools of tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the executions, or rather murders, which sullied the declining age of Constantine, will suggest to our most candid thoughts, the idea of a prince, who could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice, and the feelings of nature, to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest.</P>
<P>The same fortune which so invariably followed <NOTE PLACE="marg">His family.</NOTE> the standard of Constantine, seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his domestic life. Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the longest and most prosperous reigns, Augustus,

Trajan, and Diocletian, had been disappointed of posterity; and the frequent revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple. But the royalty of the Flavian line, which had been first ennobled by the Gothic Clau∣dius, descended through several generations; and Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honours which he transmitted to his children. The emperor had been twice married. Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his youthful attachment <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Zosimus and Zonaras agree in representing Minervina as the concubine of Constantine: but Ducange has very gallantly rescued her character, by producing a decisive passage from one of the pane∣gyrics: "Ab ipso fine pueritiae te matrimonii legibus dedisti."</NOTE>, had left him only one son, who was called Crispus. By Fausta, the daughter of Maximian, he had three daughters, and three sons known by the kindred names of Constantine, Constantius, and Constans.

Julian afterwards became the most illustrious of the children of Julius Constantius, the <HI>Patrician.</HI> The two sons of Dalmatius, who had been deco∣rated with the vain title of <HI>Censor,</HI> were named Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The two sisters of the great Constantine, Anastasia and Eurropia, were bestowed on Optatus and Nepotianus, two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity. His third sister, Constantia, was distinguished by her pre-eminence of greatness and of misery. She remained the widow of the vanquished Lici∣nius; and it was by her entreaties, that an inno∣cent boy, the offspring of their marriage, pre∣served for some time, his life, the title of Caesar, and a precarious hope of the succession. Besides the females, and the allies of the Flavian house, ten or twelve males, to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood, seemed, according to the order of their birth, to be destined either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine. But in less than thirty years, this numerous and encreasing family was reduced to the persons of Constantius and Julian, who alone had survived a series of crimes and calamities, such as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus.</P>
<P>Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Virtues of Crispus.</NOTE> presumptive heir of the empire, is represented by impartial historians as an amiable and accom∣plished youth. The care of his education, or at least of his studies, was entrusted to Lactantius, the most eloquent of the Christians; a praeceptor

At the age of seventeen, Crispus was invested with the title of Caesar, and the administration of the Gallic provinces, where the inroads of the Ger∣mans gave him an early occasion of signalizing his military prowess. In the civil war which broke out soon afterwards, the father and son di∣vided their powers; and this history has already celebrated the valour as well as conduct displayed by the latter, in forcing the streights of the Hel∣lespont, so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of Licinius. This naval victory contributed to determine the event of the war; and the names of Constantine and of Crispus were united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects: who loudly proclaimed, that the world had been sub∣dued, and was now governed, by an emperor en∣dowed with every virtue; and by his illustrious son, a prince beloved of heaven, and the lively image of his father's perfections. The public fa∣vour, which seldom accompanies old-age, dis∣fused its lustre over the youth of Crispus. He deserved the esteem, and he engaged the affec∣tions, of the court, the army, and the people. The experienced merit of a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with reluctance, and frequently denied with partial and discon∣tented

The Czar Peter, in the full possession of despotic power, submitted to the judgment of Russia, of Europe, and of posterity, the reasons which had compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of a criminal, or at least of a degenerate, son <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Histoire de Pierre le Grand, par Voltaire, part ii. c. x.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The innocence of Crispus was so universally ac∣knowledged, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The em∣press Fausta.</NOTE> that the modern Greeks, who adore the memory of their founder, are reduced to pal∣liate the guilt of a parricide, which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify. They pretend, that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled, he published to the world his repentance and remorse; that he mourned forty days, during which he ab∣stained from the use of the bath, and all the ordi∣nary comforts of life; and that, for the lasting instruction of posterity, he erected a golden statue of Crispus, with this memorable inscription: TO MY SON, WHOM I UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">In order to prove that the statue was erected by Constantine, and afterwards concealed by the malice of the Arians, Codinus very readily creates (p. 34.) two witnesses, Hippolitus, and the younger Herodotus, to whose imaginary histories he appeals with unblushing confidence.</NOTE>.

They ascribe the misfortunes of Crispus to the arts of his step∣mother Fausta, whose implacable hatred, or whose disappointed love, renewed in the palace of Constantine the ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. ii. p. 103.) may be considered as our original.

But Helena, the aged mother of Con∣stantine, lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson Crispus: nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made, that Fausta herself entertained a criminal connection with a slave belonging to the Imperial stables <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Philostorgius, l. ii. c. 4.

thought, that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years, and the honour of their common offspring, the destined heirs of the throne, might have softened the obdurate heart of Constantine; and persuaded him to suffer his wife, however guilty she might appear, to ex∣piate her offences in a solitary prison. But it seems a superfluous labour to weigh the pro∣priety, unless we could ascertain the truth, of this singular event; which is attended with some cir∣cumstances of doubt and perplexity. Those who have attacked, and those who have defended, the character of Constantine, have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages of two orations pro∣nounced under the succeeding reign. The former celebrates the virtues, the beauty, and the for∣tune of the empress Fausta, the daughter, wife, sister, and mother of so many princes <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Julian. Orat. i.

as well as of the Christian religion, there may still remain some reason to believe, or at least to suspect, that Fausta escaped the blind and sus∣picious cruelty of her husband.

<P>By the death of Crispus, the inheritance of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The sons and ne∣phews of Constan∣tine.</NOTE> empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of Fausta, who have been already mentioned under the names of Constantine, of Constantius, and of Constans. These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar; and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Euseb.

This conduct, though it tend∣ed to multiply the future masters of the Roman world, might be excused by the partiality of pa∣ternal affection; but it is not easy to understand
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people, by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The former was raised, by the title of Caesar, to an equality with his cousins. In favour of the latter, Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of <HI>Nobilissimus</HI> <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Zosim. l. ii. p. 117. Under the predecessors of Constantine, <HI>Nobilissimus</HI> was a vague epithet, rather than a legal and determined title.</NOTE>; to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold. But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire, Hannibalianus alone was distinguish∣ed by the title of KING; a name which the sub∣jects of Tiberius would have detested, as the pro∣fane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny. The use of such a title, even as it appears under the reign of Constantine, is a strange and unconnect∣ed fact, which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contempo∣rary writers <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">Adstruunt nummi veteres ac singulares.

<P>The whole empire was deeply interested in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their edu∣cation.</NOTE> education of these five youths, the acknowledged successors of Constantine.

The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith, of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman juris∣prudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government, and the knowledge of mankind. But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience. In the free intercourse of private life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had learned to com∣mand his own passions, to encounter those of his equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Imperial purple. Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers, they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their rank per∣mit

them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform as∣pect. The indulgence of Constantine admitted them, at a very tender age, to share the admini∣stration of the empire; and they studied the art of reigning at the expence of the people entrusted to their care. The younger Constantine was ap∣pointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Constantius exchanged that department, the an∣cient patrimony of their father, for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East. Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the third of his sons, as the representative of the great Constan∣tine. He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece. The city of Caesarea was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the Lesser Armenia, were designed to form the extent of his new kingdom. For each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided. A just proportion of guards, of legions, and of auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dig∣nity and defence. The ministers and generals, who were placed about their persons, were such as Constantine could trust to assist, and even to con∣trol, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power. As they advanced in years and experience, the limits of their autho∣rity were insensibly enlarged: but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus;

<P>Among the different branches of the human <NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners of the Sar∣matians.</NOTE> race, the Sarmatians form a very remarkable shade; as they seem to unite the manners of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of Europe.

and Sarmatians, who were associated for the pur∣poses of destruction; and from the accounts of history, there is some reason to believe that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae, one of the most nu∣merous and warlike tribes of the nation. The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a per∣manent establishment on the frontiers of the em∣pire. Soon after the reign of Augustus, they obliged the Dacians, who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the river Teyss or Tibiscus, to retire into the hilly country, and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hun∣gary, which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the semi-circular inclosure of the Carpathian mountains <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">The Sarmatians Jazygae were settled on the banks of the Pa∣thissus or Tibiscus, when Pliny, in the year 79, published his Natural History.

<P>This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention, which perpetually arise on <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣thic war,</NOTE> the confines of warlike and independent nations. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

After some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries, the Sarmatians im∣plored the protection of the Roman monarch, who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations, but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the Gothic arms. As soon as Constantine had declared himself in favour of the weaker party, the haughty Araric, king of the Goths, in∣stead of expecting the attack of the Legions, boldly passed the Danube, and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia. To oppose the inroad of this destroying host, the aged emperor took the field in person; but on this oc∣casion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many fo∣reign

and domestic wars. He had the mortifica∣tion of seeing his troops fly before an inconsider∣able detachment of the Barbarians, who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp, and ob∣liged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat. The event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honour of the Roman name; and the powers of art and dis∣cipline prevailed, after an obstinate contest, over the efforts of irregular valour. The broken army of the Goths abandoned the field of battle, the wasted province, and the passage of the Danube: and although the eldest of the sons of Constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 332, April 20.</NOTE> the merit of the victory, which diffused universal joy, was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself.</P>
<P>He contributed, at least, to improve this advan∣tage, by his negociations with the free and war∣like people of Chersonesus <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">I may stand in need of some apology for having used, without scruple, the authority of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in all that relates to the wars and negociations of the Chersonites. I am aware that he was a Greek of the tenth century, and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently confused and fabulous. But on this occasion his narrative is, for the most part, consistent and probable; nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to some secret archives, which had escaped the diligence of meaner historians. For the situation and history of Chersone, see Peyssonel des Peuples barbares qui ont habité les Bords du Danube, c. xvi. p. 84—90.</NOTE>, whose capital situate on the western coast of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula, still retained some vestiges of a Grecian colony, and was governed by a perpetual magi∣strate, assisted by a council of senators, emphati∣cally styled the Fathers of the City. The Cher∣sonites
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
were animated against the Goths, by the memory of the wars which, in the preceding cen∣tury, they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country. They were connected with the Romans by the mutual bene∣fits of commerce; as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures, which they purchased with their only productions, salt, wax, and hides. Obedient to the requisition of Constantine, they prepared, under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes, a considerable army, of which the principal strength consisted in cross∣bows and military chariots. The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites, by divert∣ing the attention of the Goths, assisted the opera∣tions of the Imperial generals. The Goths, van∣quished on every side, were driven into the moun∣tains, where, in the course of a severe campaign, above an hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger. Peace was at length granted to their humble supplications; the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most va∣luable hostage; and Constantine endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a liberal distribution of honours and rewards, how far the friendship of the Romans was preferable to their enmity. In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faith∣ful Chersonites, the emperor was still more mag∣nificent. The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestow∣ed on their magistrate and his successors. A per∣petual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea. A regular subsidy was promised, of
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
iron, corn, oil, and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war. But it was thought that the Sarmatians were sufficiently re∣warded by their deliverance from impending ruin; and the emperor, perhaps with too strict an oeco∣nomy, deducted some part of the expences of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation.</P>
<P>Exasperated by this apparent neglect, the Sar∣matians <NOTE PLACE="marg">Expulsion of the Sar∣matians,</NOTE> soon forgot, with the levity of Barbarians, the services which they had so lately received, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 334.</NOTE> and the dangers which still threatened their safety. Their inroads on the territory of the empire pro∣voked the indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate; and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently ascended the Gothic throne. Wisu∣mar, the Vandal king, whilst alone and unassist∣ed, he defended his dominions with undaunted courage, was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the Sarma∣tian youth. The remainder of the nation em∣braced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from their confines. But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable. Enraged by their former servitude, elated by their present glory, the slaves, under the name of Limigantes, claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved. Their masters, unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
the hardships of exile, to the tyranny of their ser∣vants. Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence, under the hostile standard of the Goths. A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian mountains, among the Quadi, their German allies, and were easily ad∣mitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land. But the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful pro∣vinces of Rome. Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor, they solemnly pro∣mised, as subjects in peace, and as soldiers in war, the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bo∣som. According to the maxims adopted by Pro∣bus and his successors, the offers of this Barbarian colony were eagerly accepted; and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Italy, were immediate∣ly assigned for the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians <NOTE N="134" PLACE="foot">The Gothic and Sarmatian wars are related in so broken and imperfect a manner, that I have been obliged to compare the follow∣ing writers, who mutually supply, correct and illustrate each other.

The arguments, by which they solicited the concur∣rence of the soldiers and people, are of a more obvious nature: and they might with decency, as well as truth, insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine, the danger of multiply∣ing the number of sovereigns, and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic, from the discord of so many rival princes, who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal af∣fection.

As soon as he had taken possession of the palace of Constanti∣nople, his first care was to remove the apprehen∣sions of his kinsmen, by a solemn oath, which he pledged for their security. His next employment was to find some specious pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise. The arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty; and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character. From the hands of the bishop of Nicomedia, Constantius received a fa∣tal scroll, affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father; in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his bro∣thers; and conjured his sons to revenge his death,

Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to de∣fend their life and honour against so incredible an accusation, they were silenced by the furious cla∣mours of the soldiers, who declared themselves, at once, their enemies, their judges, and their exe∣cutioners. The spirit, and even the forms of le∣gal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a pro∣miscuous massacre; which involved the two uncles of Constantius, seven of his cousins, of whom Dal∣matius and Hannibalianus were the most illustri∣ous, the Patrician Optatus, who had married a sister of the late emperor, and the Praefect Abla∣vius, whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple. If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene, we might add, that Constantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius, and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus.

Of so numerous a fa∣mily, Gallus and Julian alone, the two youngest children of Julius Constantius, were saved from the hands of the assassins, till their rage, satiated with slaughter, had in some measure subsided. The emperor Constantius, who, in the absence of his brothers, was the most obnoxious to guilt and reproach, discovered, on some future occasions, a faint and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious counsels of his ministers, and the irresistible violence of the troops, had extorted from his unexperienced youth <NOTE N="52" PLACE="foot">Julian (ad S.

At the decease of Constantine, the throne of the east was filled by Sapor, son of Hormouz, or Hormisdas, and grandson of Narses, who, after the victory of Galerius, had humbly confessed the superiority of the Roman power. Although Sapor was in the thirtieth year of his long reign, he was still in the vigour of youth, as the date of his accession, by a very strange fatality, had preceded that of his birth. The wife of Hormouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband's death; and the un∣certainty
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
of the sex, as well as of the event, ex∣cited the ambitious hopes of the princes of the house of Sassan. The apprehensions of civil war were at length removed, by the positive assurance of the Magi, that the widow of Hormouz had conceived, and would safely produce a son. Obe∣dient to the voice of superstition, the Persians prepared, without delay, the ceremony of his co∣ronation. A royal bed, on which the queen lay in state, was exhibited in the midst of the palace; the diadem was placed on the spot, which might be supposed to conceal the future heir of Arta∣xerxes, and the prostrate Satraps adored the ma∣jesty of their invisible and insensible sovereign <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Agathias, who lived in the sixth century, is the author of this story (l. iv. p. 135. edit.

The coronation of the mother of Sapor is likewise mentioned by Schikard (Tarikh. p. 116.) and d'Herbelot (Bibliotheque Orien∣tale, p. 763.).</NOTE>. If any credit can be given to this marvellous tale, which seems however to be countenanced by the manners of the people, and by the extraordinary duration of his reign, we must admire not only the fortune, but the genius, of Sapor. In the soft sequestered education of a Persian haram, the royal youth could discover the importance of ex∣ercising the vigour of his mind and body; and, by his personal merit, deserved a throne, on which he had been seated, while he was yet unconscious of the duties and temptations of absolute power. His minority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord; his capital was
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
surprised and plundered by Thair, a powerful king of Yemen, or Arabia; and the majesty of the royal family was degraded by the captivity of a princess, the sister of the deceased king. But as soon as Sapor attained the age of manhood, the presumptuous Thair, his nation, and his coun∣try, fell beneath the first effort of the young war∣rior; who used his victory with so judicious a mixture of rigour and clemency, that he obtained from the fears and gratitude of the Arabs, the title of <HI>Dhoulacnaf,</HI> or protector of the nation <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 764.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ambition of the Persian, to whom his ene∣mies <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Mesopo∣tamia and Armenia.</NOTE> ascribe the virtues of a soldier and a states∣man, was animated by the desire of revenging the disgrace of his fathers, and of wresting from the hands of the Romans the five provinces beyond the Tigris. The military same of Constantine, and the real or apparent strength of his govern∣ment, suspended the attack; and while the hos∣tile conduct of Sapor provoked the resentment, his artful negociations amused the patience of the Imperial court. The death of Constantine was the signal of war <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Sextus Rufus (c. 26.), who on this occasion is no contempt∣ible authority, affirms, that the Persians sued in vain for peace, and that Constantine was preparing to march against them: yet the su∣perior weight of the testimony of Eusebius, obliges us to admit the preliminaries, if not the ratification, of the treaty.

The example of the massacres of the palace, diffused a spirit of licen∣tiousness

and sedition among the troops of the east, who were no longer restrained by their ha∣bits of obedience to a veteran commander. By the prudence of Constantius, who, from the in∣terview with his brothers in Pannonia, imme∣diately hastened to the banks of the Euphrates, the legions were gradually restored to a sense of duty and discipline; but the season of anarchy had permitted Sapor to form the siege of Nisibis, and to occupy several of the most important fort∣resses of Mesopotamia <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Julian. Orat. i. p. 20.</NOTE>. In Armenia, the re∣nowned Tiridates had long enjoyed the peace and glory which he deserved by his valour and fidelity to the cause of Rome. The firm alliance which he maintained with Constantine, was productive of spiritual as well as of temporal benefits: by the conversion of Tiridates, the character of a saint was applied to that of a hero, the Christian faith was preached and established from the Eu∣phrates to the shores of the Caspian, and Armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and of religion. But as many of the Ar∣menian nobles still refused to abandon the plu∣rality of their gods and of their wives, the pub∣lic tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction, which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign, and impatiently expected the hour of his death. He died at length after a reign of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 342.</NOTE> fifty-six years, and the fortune of the Armenian monarchy expired with Tiridates. His lawful heir was driven into exile, the Christian priests
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
were either murdered or expelled from their churches, the barbarous tribes of Albania were solicited to descend from their mountains; and two of the most powerful governors, usurping the ensigns or the powers of royalty, implored the assistance of Sapor, and opened the gates of their cities to the Persian garrisons. The Christian party, under the guidance of the archbishop of Artaxata, the immediate successor of St. Gregory the Illuminator, had recourse to the piety of Con∣stantius. After the troubles had continued about three years, Antiochus, one of the officers of the household, executed with success the Imperial commission of restoring Chosroes, the son of Ti∣ridates, to the throne of his fathers, of distribut∣ing honours and rewards among the faithful ser∣vants of the house of Arsaces, and of proclaiming a general amnesty, which was accepted by the greater part of the rebellious Satraps. But the Romans derived more honour than advantage from this revolution. Chosroes was a prince of a puny stature, and a pusillanimous spirit. Un∣equal to the fatigues of war, averse to the society of mankind, he withdrew from his capital to a re∣tired palace, which he built on the banks of the river Eleutherus, and in the centre of a shady grove; where he consumed his vacant hours in the rural sports of hunting and hawking. To secure this inglorious ease, he submitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condescended to impose; the payment of an annual tribute, and the restitution of the fertile province of Atropatene, which the

The two first orations of Julian, and the third oration of Libanius, exhibit a more flattering picture; but the recantation of both those orators, after the death of Constantius, while it restores us to the possession of the truth, degrades their own character, and that of the emperor.

<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
the day was most commonly adverse to the Ro∣mans, but in the battle of Singara, their impru∣dent valour had almost atchieved a signal and de∣cisive victory. The stationary troops of Singara retired on the approach of Sapor, who passed the Tigris over three bridges, and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp, which, by the labour of his numerous pioneers, he sur∣rounded in one day with a deep ditch, and a lofty rampart. His formidable host, when it was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the river, the adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles, which separated the two armies. Both were alike impatient to engage; but the Barbarians, after a slight resist∣ance, fled in disorder; unable to resist, or de∣sirous to weary, the strength of the heavy legions, who, fainting with heat and thirst, pursued them across the plain, and cut in pieces a line of ca∣valry, clothed in complete armour, which had been posted before the gates of the camp to pro∣tect their retreat. Constantius, who was hurried along in the pursuit, attempted, without effect, to restrain the ardour of his troops, by represent∣ing to them the dangers of the approaching night,
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
and the certainty of completing their success with the return of day. As they depended much more on their own valour, than on the experience or the abilities of their chief, they silenced by their cla∣mours his timid remonstrances; and rushing with fury to the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and dispersed themselves through the tents, to recruit their exhausted strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labours. But the prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of which the greater part, securely posted on the heights, had been spectators of the action, advanced in silence, and under the shadow of the night; and his Per∣sian archers, guided by the illumination of the camp, poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd. The sincerity of history <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Acerrimâ nocturnâ concertatione pugnatum est, nostrorum copiis ingenti strage confossis. Ammian. xviii. 5. See likewise Eu∣tropius, x. 10. and S.

Even the tenderness of panegyric, confessing that the glory of the emperor was sul∣lied by the disobedience of his soldiers, chuses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this melan∣choly retreat. Yet one of those venal orators, so jealous of the fame of Constantius, relates with amazing coolness, an act of such incredible cruelty, as, in the judgment of posterity, must imprint a far deeper stain on the honour of the Imperial name.

The ordinary machines, invented to bat∣ter or undermine the walls, were rendered inef∣fectual by the superior skill of the Romans; and many days had vainly elapsed, when Sapor em∣braced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch, who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power.

On this ar∣tificial lake, a fleet of armed vessels, filled with soldiers, and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight, advanced in or∣der of battle, and engaged, almost upon a level, the troops which defended the ramparts. The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls, unable to sustain the accumulated pressure, gave way at once, and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet. The Per∣sians were instantly driven to the assault, and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day. The heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were embarrassed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters. The elephants, made furious by their wounds, encreas∣ed the disorder, and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers. The Great King, who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms, sounded, with reluctant indignation, the signal of the retreat, and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the attack. But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night; and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height, rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach. Notwithstanding the dis∣appointment of his hopes, and the loss of more than twenty thousand men, Sapor still pressed the

The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war en∣gaged him soon afterwards to conclude, or at least to observe, a truce with the Roman em∣peror, which was equally grateful to both princes; as Constantius himself, after the deaths of his two brothers, was involved, by the revolutions of the west, in a civil contest, which required and seem∣ed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his un∣divided strength.</P>
<P>After the partition of the empire, three years <NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil war, and death of Con∣stantine,</NOTE> had scarcely elapsed, before the sons of Constan∣tine seemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The eldest of those princes soon complained, that he was defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kins∣men; and though he might yield to the superior guilt and merit of Constantius, he exacted from Constans the cession of the African provinces, as an equivalent for the rich countries of Macedo∣nia and Greece, which his brother had acquired
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
by the death of Dalmatius. The want of sin∣cerity, which Constantine experienced in a te∣dious and fruitless negociation, exasperated the fierceness of his temper; and he eagerly listened to those favourites, who suggested to him that his honour, as well as his interest, was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel. At the head of a tumultuary band, suited for rapine rather than for conquest, he suddenly broke into the domi∣nions of Constans, by the way of the Julian Alps, and the country round Aquileia felt the first ef∣fects of his resentment. The measures of Con∣stans, who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and ability. On the news of his brother's invasion, he detached a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces. But the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest. By the artful appearances of flight, Constantine was be∣trayed into an ambuscade, which had been con∣cealed in a wood, where the rash youth, with a few attendants, was surprised, surrounded, and slain. His body, after it had been found in the obscure stream of the Alsa, obtained the honours of an Imperial sepulchre; but his provinces trans∣ferred their allegiance to the conqueror, who, re∣fusing to admit his elder brother Constantius to any share in these new acquisitions, maintained the undisputed possession of more than two-thirds of the Roman empire <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">The causes and the events of this civil war are related with much perplexity and contradiction.

The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer, and the revenge of his brother's death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Constans,</NOTE> a domestic traitor. The pernicious tendency of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 350, February.</NOTE> the system introduced by Constantine, was dis∣played in the feeble administration of his sons; who, by their vices and weakness, soon lost the esteem and affections of their people. The pride assumed by Constans, from the unmerited success of his arms, was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application. His fond partiality towards some German captives, distin∣guished only by the charms of youth, was an ob∣ject of scandal to the people <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Quarum <HI>(gentium)</HI> obsides pretio quaesitos pueros venustiores, quod cultius habuerat, libidine hujusmodi arsisse <HI>pro certo</HI> habetur.

The soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments, that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude; and, by the choice of an active and vigilant prince, to re∣ward the same virtues which had raised the an∣cestors of the degenerate Constans from a pri∣vate condition to the throne of the world. As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution, Marcellinus, under the pretence of celebrating his son's birth-day, gave a splendid entertainment to the <HI>illustrious</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI> persons of the court of Gaul, which then resided in the city of Autun. The intemperance of the feast was artfully pro∣tracted till a very late hour of the night; and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation. On a sudden the doors were thrown open, and Magnentius, who had retired for a few moments, returned into the apartment, in∣vested with the diadem and purple. The con∣spirators instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor. The surprise, the ter∣ror, the intoxication, the ambitious hopes, and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly, prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation. The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity; the gates of the town were shut; and before the dawn of day, Magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun. By his secrecy and diligence he
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans, who was pursuing in the adjacent fo∣rest his favourite amusement of hunting, or per∣haps some pleasures of a more private and cri∣minal nature. The rapid progress of fame al∣lowed him, however, an instant for flight, though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance.

of Illyricum, from the Danube to the extremity of Greece, had long obeyed the government of Vetranio, an aged general, beloved for the sim∣plicity of his manners, and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Eutropius (x. 10.) describes Vetranio with more temper, and probably with more truth, than either of the two Victors. Vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest parts of Maesia; and so much had his education been neglected, that, after his elevation, he sludied the alphabet.</NOTE>. Attached by habit, by duty, and by gra∣titude, to the house of Constantine, he imme∣diately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master, that he would expose, with unshaken fidelity, his person and his troops, to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul. But the legions of Vetranio were seduced, rather than provoked, by the example of rebel∣lion; their leader soon betrayed a want of firm∣ness, or a want of sincerity; and his ambition de∣rived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina. That cruel and aspiring woman, who had obtained from the great Constantine her father the rank of <HI>Augusta,</HI> placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the Illyrian general; and seemed to expect from his victory, the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes, of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus. Perhaps it was without the consent of Constantina, that the new emperor formed a necessary, though disho∣nourable, alliance with the usurper of the west,

<P>The intelligence of these important events, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constan∣tius refuses to treat.</NOTE> which so deeply affected the honour and safety of the Imperial house, recalled the arms of Constan∣tius <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

He recommended the care of the east to his lieutenants, and afterwards to his cousin Gal∣lus, whom he raised from a prison to a throne; and marched towards Europe, with a mind agi∣tated by the conflict of hope and fear, of grief and indignation. On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace, the emperor gave audience to the am∣bassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio. The first author of the conspiracy, Marcellinus, who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master, boldly accepted this dangerous com∣mission; and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army. These deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment, and to alarm the fears, of Con∣stantius. They were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes, to cement their union by a double marriage; of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius, and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina; and to acknowledge in the treaty the pre-eminence of rank, which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the east. Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equi∣table

conditions, the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must at∣tend his rashness, if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the west to exert their superior strength; and to employ against him that valour, those abilities, and those legions, to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs. Such propositions and such ar∣guments appeared to deserve the most serious at∣tention; the answer of Constantius was deferred till the next day; and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people, he thus addressed his council, who listened with real or affected credulity: <Q>Last night, said he, after I retired to rest, the shade of the great Constantine, embracing the corpse of my murdered brother, rose before my eyes; his well-known voice awakened me to revenge, forbade me to despair of the republic, and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms.</Q> The authority of such a vision, or ra∣ther of the prince who alleged it, silenced every doubt, and excluded all negociation. The igno∣minious terms of peace were rejected with disdain. One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dis∣missed with the haughty answer of Constantius; his colleagues, as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations, were put in irons; and the contending powers prepared to wage an impla∣cable war <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">See Peter the Patrician, in the Excerpta Legationum, p. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="160"/>
Such was the conduct, and such perhaps was the duty, of the brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul. The situation and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deposes Vetranio,</NOTE> character of Vetranio admitted of milder mea∣sures; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 350, Dec. 25.</NOTE> and the policy of the eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists, and to sepa∣rate the forces of Illyricum from the cause of re∣bellion. It was an easy task to deceive the frank∣ness and simplicity of Vetranio, who, fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honour and interest, displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper, and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negociation. Constantius ac∣knowledged him as a legitimate and equal col∣league in the empire, on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnen∣tius, and appoint a place of interview on the fron∣tiers of their respective provinces; where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity, and regulate by common consent the fu∣ture operations of the civil war. In consequence of this agreement, Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Zonaras, tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 16. The position of Sardica, near the modern city of Sophia, appears better suited to this interview than the situation of either Naissus or Sirmium, where it is placed by Jerom, Socrates, and Sozomen.</NOTE>, at the head of twenty thousand horse, and of a more numerous body of infantry; a power so far superior to the forces of Constan∣tius, that the Illyrian emperor appeared to com∣mand the life and fortunes of his rival, who, de∣pending on the success of his private negocia∣tions, had seduced the troops, and undermined
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
the throne, of Vetranio. The chiefs, who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius, pre∣pared in his favour a public spectacle, calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multi∣tude <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">See the two first orations of Julian, particularly p. 31.; and Zosimus, l. ii. p. 122. The distinct narrative of the historian serves to illustrate the diffuse, but vague, descriptions of the orator.</NOTE>. The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city. In the centre, according to the rules of ancient disci∣pline, a military tribunal, or rather scaffold, was erected, from whence the emperors were accus∣tomed, on solemn and important occasions, to harangue the troops. The well-ordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians, with drawn swords, or with erected spears, the squadrons of cavalry, and the cohorts of infantry, distinguished by the va∣riety of their arms and ensigns, formed an im∣mense circle round the tribunal; and the atten∣tive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamour or of ap∣plause. In the presence of this formidable assem∣bly, the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs: the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius; and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric, he acquitted himself, under these difficult circumstances, with firmness, dexterity, and eloquence. The first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans, he insinuated, that none, except a brother, could claim a right to the suc∣cession
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
of his brother. He displayed, with some complacency, the glories of his Imperial race; and recalled to the memory of the troops, the va∣lour, the triumphs, the liberality of the great Constantine, to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the in∣gratitude of his most favoured servants had tempt∣ed them to violate. The officers, who surrounded the tribunal, and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene, confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence, by saluting the emperor Constantius as their lawful sovereign. The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank; till the plain of Sardica resounded with the universal acclama∣tion of <Q>Away with these upstart usurpers! Long life and victory to the son of Constantine! Under his banners alone we will fight and con∣quer.</Q> The shout of thousands, their me∣nacing gestures, the fierce clashing of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio, who stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in anxious and silent suspence. Instead of em∣bracing the last refuge of generous despair, he tamely submitted to his fate; and taking the diadem from his head, in the view of both armies, fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror. Con∣stantius used his victory with prudence and mo∣deration; and raising from the ground the aged suppliant, whom he affected to style by the en∣dearing name of Father, he gave him his hand to descend from the throne. The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdi∣cated
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
monarch, who lived six years in the enjoy∣ment of ease and affluence. He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius, and, with a very amiable simplicity, advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world, and to seek for content (where alone it could be found) in the peaceful obscurity of a private condi∣tion <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">The younger Victor assigns to his exile the emphatical appel∣lation of "Voluptarium otium." Socrates (l. ii. c. 28.) is the voucher for the correspondence with the emperor, which would seem to prove, that Vetranio was, indeed, prope ad stultitiam simplicissimus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Constantius on this memo∣rable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes war against Magnen∣tius,</NOTE> occasion was celebrated with some appear∣ance of justice; and his courtiers compared the studied orations which a Pericles or a Demo∣sthenes <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

But as he neither shews himself a soldier nor a politician, his narrative must be weighed with attention, and received with caution.</NOTE>. Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis, a name that would animate his troops by the re∣membrance of the victory which, on the same auspicious ground, had been obtained by the arms of his father Constantine. Yet, by the impreg∣nable fortifications with which the emperor en∣compassed his camp, he appeared to decline, ra∣ther than to invite, a general engagement. It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to com∣pel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position; and he employed, with that view, the various marches, evolutions, and stratagems, which the knowledge of the art of war could sug∣gest to an experienced officer. He carried by as∣sault the important town of Siscia; made an at∣tack on the city of Sirmium, which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp; attempted to force a passage over the Save into the eastern provinces of
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
Illyricum; and cut in pieces a numerous detach∣ment, which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne. During the greater part of the sum∣mer, the tyrant of Gaul shewed himself master of the field. The troops of Constantius were ha∣rassed and dispirited; his reputation declined in the eye of the world; and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace, which would have re∣signed to the assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip, the Im∣perial ambassador; and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them. But the haughty usurper, careless of the remonstrances of his friends, gave orders that Philip should be detained as a captive, or at least as a hostage; while he dispatched an officer to re∣proach Constantius with the weakness of his reign, and to insult him by the promise of a pardon, if he would instantly abdicate the purple. <Q>That he should confide in the justice of his cause, and the protection of an avenging Deity,</Q> was the only answer which honour permitted the em∣peror to return. But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation, that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative. The negociation of Philip was not, however, ineffectual; since he determined Sylvanus the Frank, a general of merit and reputation, to desert with a consider∣able body of cavalry, a few days before the battle of Mursa.</P>

The vigi∣lance of the garrison extinguished the flames; the approach of Constantius left him no time to con∣tinue the operations of the siege; and the em∣peror soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions, by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphi∣theatre. The field of battle round Mursa was a naked and level plain: on this ground the army of Constantius formed, with the Drave on their right; while their left, either from the nature of their disposition, or from the superiority of their cavalry, extended far beyond the right slank of Magnentius <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">This position, and the subsequent evolutions, are clearly, though concisely, described by Julian, Orat. i. p. 36.</NOTE>.

Their prison was an ancient palace, the residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the situa∣tion was pleasant, the buildings stately, the inclo∣sure spacious. They pursued their studies, and practised their exercises, under the tuition of the most skilful masters; and the numerous house∣hold appointed to attend, or rather to guard, the the nephews of Constantine, was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom they could trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the company of slaves, devoted to the commands of a tyrant, who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation. At length, however, the emergencies of the state compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs, to invest Gallus, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of Caesar, and to cement this poli∣tical <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallus de∣clared Caesar,</NOTE> connection by his marriage with the princess Constantina.

had been conscious how much he had to fear, and how little he deserved to reign, selected for the objects of his resentment, the provincials accused of some imaginary treason, and his own courtiers, whom with more reason he suspected of incensing, by their secret correspondence, the timid and sus∣picious mind of Constantius. But he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support, the affection of the people; whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth, and afforded the emperor the fairest pretence of ex∣acting the forfeit of his purple, and of his life <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">See in Ammianus (l. xiv. c. 1. 7.) a very ample detail of the cruelties of Gallus.

<P>As long as the civil war suspended the fate of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacre of the Im∣perial mi∣nisters,</NOTE> the Roman world, Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel administration to which his choice had subjected the East; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

But when the vic∣tory was decided in favour of Constantius, his de∣pendent colleague became less useful and less for∣midable. Every circumstance of his conduct was severely and suspiciously examined, and it was pri∣vately resolved, either to deprive Gallus of the
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
purple, or at least to remove him from the indo∣lent luxury of Asia to the hardships and dangers of a German war. The death of Theophilus, consular of the province of Syria, who in a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of Antioch, with the connivance, and almost at the instigation, of Gallus, was justly resented, not only as an act of wanton cruelty, but as a dan∣gerous insult on the supreme majesty of Constan∣tius. Two ministers of illustrious rank, Domi∣tian, the Oriental praefect, and Montius, quaestor of the palace, were empowered by a special com∣mission to visit and reform the state of the East. They were instructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and respect, and, by the gentlest arts of persuasion, to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague. The rashness of the praefect disappointed these prudent measures, and hastened his own ruin, as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging a slight pretence of in∣disposition, continued several days in sullen re∣tirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he transmitted to the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus, the praefect condescended to take his seat in council; but his first step was to signify a con∣cise and haughty mandate, importing that the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himself would punish his de∣lay or hesitation, by suspending the usual allow∣ance of his household. The nephew and daughter
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
of Constantine, who could ill brook the insolence of a subject, expressed their resentment by in∣stantly delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard. The quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommodation. They were rendered im∣practicable by the imprudent behaviour of Mon∣tius, a statesman, whose art and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his disposi∣tion <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">In the present text of Ammianus, we read, <HI>Asper,</HI> quidem, sed ad <HI>lenitatem</HI> propensior; which forms a sentence of contradictory non∣sense.

By this rash declaration of war, the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels. He order∣ed his guards to stand to their arms, assembled the populace of Antioch, and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge. His com∣mands were too fatally obeyed. They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor, and tying their legs together with ropes, they dragged them through the streets of the city, inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims, and at last precipitated their

<P>After such a deed, whatever might have been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangerous situation of Gallus.</NOTE> the designs of Gallus, it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with any hope of success. But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weak∣ness. Instead of assuming the title of Augustus, instead of employing in his defence the troops and treasures of the East, he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Con∣stantius, who, leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled the veteran le∣gions from the provinces of Asia. But as it still appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his capital, the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were prac∣tised with success. The frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled with professions of confidence and friendship; exhorting the Caesar to discharge the duties of his high station, to re∣lieve his colleague from a part of the public cares, and to assist the West by his presence, his coun∣sels, and his arms. After so many reciprocal in∣juries, Gallus had reason to fear and to distrust. But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of resistance; he was seduced by the flatter∣ing assurances of the tribune Scudilo, who, under the semblance of a rough soldier, disguised the
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
most artful insinuation; and he depended on the credit of his wife Constantina, till the unseasonable death of that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous pas∣sions <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">She had preceded her husband; but died of a fever on the road, at a little place in Bithynia, called Coenum Gallicanum.</NOTE>.</P>

From Antioch to Hadrianople, he traversed the wide <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The progress of the journey might, how∣ever, have warned him of the impending danger. In all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence, commissioned to seize the offices of government, to observe his motions, and to pre∣vent the hasty sallies of his despair. The persons dispatched to secure the provinces which he left behind, passed him with cold salutations, or af∣fected disdain; and the troops, whose station lay along the public road, were studiously removed on his approach, lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">The Thebaean legions, which were then quartered at Hadria∣nople, sent a deputation to Gallus, with a tender of their services.

After Gallus had been permitted to repose him∣self a few days at Hadrianople, he received a mandate, expressed in the most haughty and ab∣solute style, that his splendid retinue should halt in that city, while the Caesar himself, with only ten post-carriages, should hasten to the Imperial residence at Milan. In this rapid journey, the profound respect which was due to the brother and colleague of Constantius, was insensibly changed into rude familiarity; and Gallus, who discovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards, and might soon be employed as his exe∣cutioners, began to accuse his fatal rashness, and to recollect with terror and remorse the conduct by which he had provoked his fate. The dissi∣mulation which had hitherto been preserved, was laid aside at Petovio in Pannonia. He was con∣ducted to a palace in the suburbs, where the ge∣neral Barbatio, with a select band of soldiers, who could neither be moved by pity, nor corrupted by rewards, expected the arrival of his illustrious victim. In the close of the evening he was ar∣rested, ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Caesar, and hurried away to Pola in Istria, a se∣questered prison, which had been so recently pol∣luted with royal blood. The horror which he felt, was soon increased by the appearance of his im∣placable enemy the eunuch Eusebius, who, with the assistance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the East. The Caesar sunk under the weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the criminal

actions, and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged; and by imputing them to the advice of his wife, exasperated the indignation of Constantius, who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination. The emperor was easily convinced, that his own safety was incom∣patible with the life of his cousin: the sentence of death was signed, dispatched, and executed; and the nephew of Constantine, with his hands tied behind his back, was beheaded in prison like the vilest malefactor <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">See the complete narrative of the journey and death of Gallus in Ammianus, l. xiv. c. 11. Julian complains that his brother was put to death without a trial; attempts to justify, or at least to ex∣cuse, the cruel revenge which he had inflicted on his enemies; but seems at last to acknowledge that he might justly have been deprived of the purple.</NOTE>. Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of Constantius, assert that he soon relented, and endeavoured to recal the bloody mandate; but that the second messenger entrusted with the reprieve, was detained by the eunuchs, who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were desirous of re-uniting to <HI>their</HI> empire the wealthy provinces of the East <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Philostorgius, l. iv. c. 1.

the court of Milan; where he languished above seven months, in the continual apprehension of suffering the same ignominious death, which was daily inflicted, almost before his eyes, on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family. His looks, his gestures, his silence, were scru∣tinized with malignant curiosity, and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies, whom he had never offended, and by arts to which he was a stranger <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">See Ammianus Marcellin. l. xv. c. 1. 3. 8. Julian himself, in his epistle to the Athenians, draws a very lively and just picture of his own danger, and of his sentiments. He shews, however, a tendency to exaggerate his sufferings, by insinuating, though in ob∣scure terms, that they lasted above a year; a period which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology.</NOTE>. But in the school of adversity, Julian insensibly acquired the virtues of firmness and discretion. He defended his honour, as well as his life, against the ensnaring subtleties of the eunuchs, who endeavoured to extort some de∣claration of his sentiments: and whilst he cau∣tiously suppressed his grief and resentment, he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant, by any seeming approbation of his brother's murder.

By the intercession of his patroness, Julian was admitted into the Imperial presence: he pleaded his cause with a decent freedom, he was heard with favour; and, not∣withstanding the efforts of his enemies, who urged the danger of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus, the milder sentiment of Eusebia prevail∣ed in the council. But the effects of a second in∣terview were dreaded by the eunuchs; and Ju∣lian was advised to withdraw for a while into the neighbourhood of Milan, till the emperor thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is sent to Athens,</NOTE> proper to assign the city of Athens for the place <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

As he had discovered, from his earliest youth, a propensity, or rather passion, for the language, the manners, the learn∣ing, and the religion of the Greeks, he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his wishes. Far from the tumult of arms, and the treachery of courts, he spent six months amidst the groves of the academy, in a free intercourse with the philosophers of the age, who studied to cultivate the genius, to encourage the vanity, and to in∣flame the devotion of their royal pupil. Their
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
labours were not unsuccessful; and Julian in∣violably preserved for Athens that tender regard, which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind, from the recollection of the place where it has discover∣ed and exercised its growing powers. The gentle∣ness and affability of manners, which his temper suggested and his situation imposed, insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers, as well as citizens, with whom he conversed. Some of his fellow-students might perhaps examine his beha∣viour with an eye of prejudice and aversion; but Julian established, in the schools of Athens, a ge∣neral prepossession in favour of his virtues and talents, which was soon diffused over the Roman world <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Libanius and Gregory Nazianzen have exhausted the arts as well as the powers of their eloquence, to represent Julian as the first of heroes, or the worst of tyrants.

Above all, the Per∣sian monarch, elated by victory, again threatened the peace of Asia, and the presence of the em∣peror was indispensably required, both in the West, and in the East.

After an obstinate, though secret struggle, the opposition of the favourite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the empress; and it was re∣solved that Julian, after celebrating his nuptials with Helena, sister of Constantius, should be ap∣pointed, with the title of Caesar, to reign over the countries beyond the Alps <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, l. xv. c. 8.

<P>The emperors of the age of Constantine no longer deigned to consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague; but they were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the con∣sent of the army.

The approbation of the soldiers was

As soon as the ceremony of his investiture had been performed, Constantius addressed him with the tone of authority, which his superior age and station permitted him to as∣sume; and exhorting the new Caesar to deserve, by heroic deeds, that sacred and immortal name, the emperor gave his colleague the strongest as∣surances of a friendship which should never be impaired by time, nor interrupted by their sepa∣ration into the most distant climates. As soon as the speech was ended, the troops, as a token of applause, clashed their shields against their knees <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Militares omnes horrendo fragore scuta genibus illidentes; quod est prosperitatis indicium plenum; nam contra cum hastis clypei feriuntur, irae documentum est et doloris. . . .

In the summer which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fatal end of Sylva∣nus,</NOTE> preceded his own elevation, that general had been chosen to deliver Gaul from the tyranny of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

A dexterous informer, counte∣nanced by several of the principal ministers, pro∣cured from him some recommendatory letters; and erazing the whole of the contents, except the signature, filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high and treasonable import. By the industry and courage of his friends, the fraud was however detected, and in a great council of the
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
civil and military officers, held in the presence of the emperor himself, the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly acknowledged. But the discovery came too late; the report of the calumny, and the hasty seizure of his estate, had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so unjustly accused. He assumed the purple at his head-quarters of Cologne, and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an invasion, and Milan with a siege. In this emergency, Ur∣sicinus, a general of equal rank, regained, by an act of treachery, the favour which he had lost by his eminent services in the East. Exasperated, as he might speciously allege, by injuries of a similar nature, he hastened with a few followers to join the standard, and to betray the confidence, of his too credulous friend. After a reign of only twenty-eight days, Sylvanus was assassinated: the soldiers who, without any criminal intention, had blindly followed the example of their leader, immediately returned to their allegiance; and the flatterers of Constantius celebrated the wis∣dom and felicity of the monarch who had ex∣tinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xv. 5.) was perfectly well informed of the conduct and fate of Sylvanus.

We have only to add, that Themistius was appointed deputy from Constantinople, and that he composed his fourth Oration for this ceremony.</NOTE>. He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the Aemi∣lian and Flaminian ways; and as soon as he ap∣proached within forty miles of the city, the march of a prince who had never vanquished a foreign enemy, assumed the appearance of a triumphal procession. His splendid train was composed of all the ministers of luxury; but in a time of pro∣found peace, he was encompassed by the glitter∣ing arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and cuirassiers. Their streaming banners of silk, embossed with gold, and shaped in the form of dragons, waved round the person of the em∣peror. Constantius sat alone in a lofty car re∣splendent with gold and precious gems; and, ex∣cept when he bowed his head to pass under the gates of the cities, he affected a stately demeanour of inflexible, and, as it might seem, of insensible gravity. The severe discipline of the Persian youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace; and such were the habits of patience which they had inculcated, that, during a slow and sultry march, he was never seen to move his hand towards his face, or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left. He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome; and the emperor surveyed, with attention, the civil honours of the republic, and the consular images of the noble families. The streets were lined
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
with an innumerable multitude. Their repeated acclamations expressed their joy at beholding, after an absence of thirty-two years, the sacred person of their sovereign; and Constantius him∣self expressed, with some pleasantry, his affected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on the same spot. The son of Con∣stantine was lodged in the ancient palace of Augustus: he presided in the senate, harangued the people from the tribunal which Cicero had so often ascended, assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the Circus, and accepted the crowns of gold, as well as the panegyrics which had been prepared for this ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities. His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power, which were scattered over the seven hills and the interjacent vallies. He admired the awful majesty of the capitol, the vast extent of the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, the severe simplicity of the Pantheon, the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant archi∣tecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace, and, above all, the stately structure of the Forum and column of Trajan; acknowledg∣ing, that the voice of fame, so prone to invent and to magnify, had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world. The traveller, who has contemplated the ruins of ancient Rome, may conceive some imperfect idea of the senti∣ments which they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the splendour of unsullied beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="201"/>
The satisfaction which Constantius had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the Romans some me∣morial <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new obelisk.</NOTE> of his own gratitude and munificence. His first idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he had seen in the Forum of Trajan; but when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Hormisdas, a fugitive prince of Persia, observed to the em∣peror, that if he made such a horse, he must think of preparing a similar stable (the Forum of Trajan).

The contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope.</NOTE>, he chose rather to embellish the capital by the gift of an Egyptian obelisk. In a remote but polished age, which seems to have preceded the invention of alpha∣betical writing, a great number of these obelisks had been erected, in the cities of Thebes and He∣liopolis, by the ancient sovereigns of Egypt, in a just confidence that the simplicity of their form, and the hardness of their substance, would resist the injuries of time and violence <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">When Germanicus visited the ancient monuments of Thebes, the eldest of the priests explained to him the meaning of these hiero∣glyphics.

A vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness was provided to con∣vey this enormous weight of granite, at least an hundred and fifteen feet in length, from the banks of the Nile to those of the Tyber.

The garrisons of the frontier were insufficient to check their progress; and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to assemble, from the extremities of his dominions, the flower of the Palatine troops, to take the field in person, and to employ a whole campaign, with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring, in the serious prosecution of the war. The emperor passed the Danube on a bridge of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march, penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and severely retaliated the calami∣ties which they had inflicted on the Roman pro∣vince. The dismayed Barbarians were soon re∣duced to sue for peace: they offered the restitution of his captive subjects, as an atonement for the past, and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct. The generous courtesy which was shewn to the first among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Constantius, encou∣raged the more timid, or the more obstinate, to imitate their example; and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes, who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland, and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains. While Constantius gave
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished with specious compassion the Sar∣matian exiles, who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves, and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi. The emperor, em∣bracing a generous but artful system of policy, released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence, and restored them, by a separate treaty, to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the friend and ally of the republic. He declared his reso∣lution of asserting the justice of their cause, and of securing the peace of the provinces by the ex∣tirpation, or at least the banishment, of the Li∣migantes, whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin. The execution of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube, against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss. The marshy lands which lay between those rivers, and were often covered by their inundations, formed an intricate wilderness, pervious only to the inha∣bitants, who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses. On the approach of Constantius, the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms; but he sternly rejected their supplications, defeated their rude stratagems, and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valour. One of their most warlike tribes, established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss and the
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
Danube, consented to pass the river with the in∣tention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference. They soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated. Encompassed on every side, tram∣pled down by the cavalry, slaughtered by the swords of the legions, they disdained to ask for mercy; and with an undaunted countenance still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this victory a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite banks of the Danube; the Taifalae, a Gothic tribe engaged in the service of the empire, invaded the Limigantes on the side of the Teyss; and their former masters, the free Sarmatians, animated by hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions. A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were seated in the depth of the wilderness; and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In this extremity the bravest of the Limigantes were re∣solved to die in arms, rather than to yield: but the milder sentiment, enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed; and the suppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children, repaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation, Con∣stantius assigned for the place of their exile a re∣mote country, where they might enjoy a safe and
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
honourable repose. The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance; but before they could reach, at least before they could occupy, their destined habita∣tions, they returned to the banks of the Danube, exaggerating the hardships of their situation, and requesting, with fervent professions of fidelity, that the emperor would grant them an undisturb∣ed settlement within the limits of the Roman provinces. Instead of consulting his own ex∣perience of their incurable perfidy, Constantius listened to his flatterers, who were ready to repre∣sent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions, than the military service of the subjects of the empire. The Limigantes were permitted to pass the Da∣nube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda. They surrounded the tribunal, and seem∣ed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and dignity; when one of the Barbarians, cast∣ing his shoe into the air, exclaimed with a loud voice, <HI>Marha! Marha!</HI> a word of defiance, which was received as the signal of the tumult. They rushed with fury to seize the person of the em∣peror; his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands; but the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allow∣ed him a moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the confusion. The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans; and the combat was only terminated
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats; and al∣though Constantius distrusted the levity of their character, he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demeanour of Zizais, one of the noblest of their chiefs. He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign, by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interest of his benefactor, who, after this splendid success, received the name of <HI>Sarmaticus</HI> from the acclamations of his victorious army <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Genti Sarmatarum magno decori considens apud eos regem dedit.

Two of the eastern ministers of Constantius, the Prae∣torian praefect Musonian, whose abilities were disgraced by the want of truth and integrity, and Cassian duke of Mesopotamia, a hardy and vete∣ran soldier, opened a secret negociation with the Satrap Tamsapor <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 9.</NOTE> These overtures of peace, translated into the servile and flattering language of Asia, were transmitted to the camp of the Great King; who resolved to signify, by an am∣bassador,

the terms which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans. Narses, whom he invested with that character, was honourably received in his passage through Antioch and Con∣stantinople: he reached Sirmium after a long jour∣ney, and, at his first audience, respectfully un∣solded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign. Sapor, King of Kings, and Brother of the Sun and Moon (such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity), ex∣pressed his satisfaction that his brother, Constan∣tius Caesar, had been taught wisdom by adver∣sity. As the lawful successor of Darius Hystaspes, Sapor asserted, that the river Strymon in Mace∣donia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire; declaring, however, that as an evidence of his moderation, he would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his ancestors. He alleged, that, without the re∣stitution of these disputed countries, it was im∣possible to establish any treaty on a solid and per∣manent basis; and he arrogantly threatened, that if his ambassador returned in vain, he was pre∣pared to take the field in the spring, and to sup∣port the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms.

A count, a notary, and a sophist, had been selected for this important commission; and Constantius, who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the peace, entertained some hopes that the dignity of the first of these ministers, the dexterity of the second, and the rhetoric of the third <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xvii. 5. and Valesius ad loc.

The military historian <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Ammian. l. xviii. 6, 7, 8. 10.</NOTE>, who was himself dis∣patched to observe the army of the Persians, as they were preparing to construct a bridge of boats <NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Mesopo∣tamia by Sapor,</NOTE> over the Tigris, beheld from an eminence the plain of Assyria, as far as the edge of the horizon, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 359.</NOTE> covered with men, with horses, and with arms. Sapor appeared in the front, conspicuous by the splendor of his purple. On his left hand, the place of honour among the Orientals, Grumbates, king of the Chionites, displayed the stern coun∣tenance of an aged and renowned warrior. The monarch had reserved a similar place on his right hand for the king of the Albanians, who led his independent tribes from the shores of the Caspian. The fatraps and generals were distributed ac∣cording to their several ranks, and the whole army, besides the numerous train of Oriental luxury, consisted of more than one hundred thou∣sand effective men, inured to fatigue, and selec∣ted from the bravest nations of Asia. The Ro∣man deserter, who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor, had prudently advised, that, instead of wasting the summer in tedious and dif∣ficult sieges, he should march directly to the Eu∣phrates, and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis of Syria. But the Persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of Mesopotomia, than they discovered that every precaution had been used which could re∣tard their progress, or defeat their design. The inhabitants, with their cattle, were secured in
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
places of strength, the green forage through∣out the country was set on fire, the fords of the river were fortified by sharp stakes; mili∣tary engines were planted on the opposite banks, and a seasonable swell of the waters of the Eu∣phrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage of the bridge of Thapsacus. Their skilful guide, changing his plan of opera∣tions, then conducted the army by a longer cir∣cuit, but through a fertile territory, towards the head of the Euphrates, where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream. Sapor overlooked, with prudent disdain, the strength of Nisibis; but as he passed under the walls of Amida, he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison into im∣mediate submission. The sacrilegious insult of a random dart, which glanced against the royal tiara, convinced him of his error; and the indig∣nant monarch listened with impatience to the advice of his ministers, who conjured him, not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratifi∣cation of his resentment. The following day Grumbates advanced towards the gates with a se∣lect body of troops, and required the instant sur∣render of the city, as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence. His proposals were answered by a ge∣neral discharge, and his only son, a beautiful and valiant youth, was pierced through the heart by a javelin, shot from one of the balistae. The fu∣neral of the prince of the Chionites was celebrated according to the rites of his country; and the
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
grief of his aged father was alleviated by the so∣lemn promise of Sapor, that the guilty city of Amida should serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death, and to perpetuate the memory, of his son.</P>

The emperor Constan∣tius had recently conferred on Amida the honour of his own name, and the additional fortifications of strong walls and lofty towers.

assault. To the several nations which followed his standard their respective posts were assigned; the south to the Vertae, the north to the Alba∣nians, the east to the Chionites, inflamed with grief and indignation; the west to the Segestans, the bravest of his warriors, who covered their front with a formidable line of Indian elephants <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Of these four nations, the Albanians are too well known to re∣quire any description. The Segestans inhabited a large and level country, which still preserves their name, to the south of Khorasan, and the west of Hindostan (See Geographia Nubiensis, p. 133. and d'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 797.). Notwithstanding the boasted victory of Bahram (vol. i. p. 410.), the Segestans, above fourscore years afterwards, appear as an independent nation, the ally of Persia. We are ignorant of the situation of the Vertae and Chionites, but I am inclined to place them (at least the latter) to∣wards the confines of India and Scythia. See Ammian. xvi. 9.</NOTE>. The Persians, on every side, supported their ef∣forts, and animated their courage; and the mo∣narch himself, careless of his rank and safety, dis∣played in the prosecution of the siege, the ardor of a youthful soldier. After an obstinate combat, the Barbarians were repulsed; they incessantly returned to the charge; they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter, and two rebel le∣gions of Gauls, who had been banished into the East, signalized their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart of the Persian camp. In one of the fiercest of these repeated assaults, Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a de∣serter, who indicated to the Barbarians a secret and neglected staircase, scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris. Se∣venty chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to the third story of a lofty tower which
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
commanded the precipice; they elevated on high the Persian banner, the signal of confidence to the assailants, and of dismay to the besieged; and if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few minutes longer, the reduction of the place might have been purchased by the sacrifice of their lives. After Sapor had tried, without success, the efficacy of force and of stratagem, he had recourse to the slower but more certain opera∣tions of a regular siege, in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of the Roman de∣serters. The trenches were opened at a conve∣nient distance, and the troops destined for that service advanced under the portable cover of strong hurdles, to fill up the ditch, and under∣mine the foundations of the walls. Wooden towers were at the same time constructed, and moved forwards on wheels, till the soldiers, who were provided with every species of missile wea∣pons, could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart. Every mode of resistance which art could suggest, or courage could execute, was employed in the de∣fence of Amida, and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed by the fire of the Ro∣mans. But the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted. The Persians repaired their losses, and pushed their approaches; a large breach was made by the battering-ram, and the strength of the garrison, wasted by the sword and by disease, yielded to the fury of the assault. The soldiers, the citizens, their wives, their children, all who
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
had not time to escape through the opposite gate, were involved by the conquerors in a promiscuous massacre.</P>
<P>But the ruin of Amida was the safety of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Sin∣gara, &amp;c.</NOTE> Roman provinces. As soon as the first transports of victory had subsided, Sapor was at leisure to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 360.</NOTE> reflect, that to chastise a disobedient city, he had lost the flower of his troops, and the most favour∣able season for conquest <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by three signs, which do not perfectly coincide with each other, or with the series of the history. 1. The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded Mesopotamia; "Cum jam stipulâ flavente turgerent;" a circum∣stance, which, in the latitude of Aleppo, would naturally refer us to the month of April or May. See Harmer's Observations on Scripture, vol. i. p. 41. Shaw's Travels, p. 335. edit. 4 to. 2. The progress of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the Euphrates, which generally happens in July and August. Plin. Hist. Nat. v. 21. Viaggi di Pietro della Valle, tom. i. p. 696. 3. When Sapor had taken Amida, after a siege of seventy-three days, the autumn was far advanced. <Q>Autumno precipiti haedoruinque improbo sidere extoto.</Q> To reconcile these apparent contradictions, we must allow for some delay in the Persian king, some inaccuracy in the historian, and some disorder in the seasons.</NOTE>. Thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of Amida, during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventy-three days; and the disappointed mo∣narch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification. It is more than prob∣able, that the inconstancy of his Barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties; and that the aged king of the Chionites, satiated with revenge, turned away with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation. The strength as well as
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
spirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the ensuing spring, was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition. Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East, he was ob∣liged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified cities of Mesopotamia, Singara and Bezabde <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">The account of these sieges is given by Ammianus, xx. 6, 7.</NOTE>; the one situate in the midst of a sandy desert, the other in a small peninsula, surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the Tigris. Five Roman legions, of the di∣minutive size, to which they had been reduced in the age of Constantine, were made prisoners, and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Persia. After dismantling the walls of Singara, the conqueror abandoned that soli∣tary and sequestered place; but he carefully re∣stored the fortifications of Bezabde, and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of ve∣terans; amply supplied with every means of de∣fence, and animated by high sentiments of ho∣nour and fidelity. Towards the close of the cam∣paign, the arms of Sapor incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprize against Virtha, or Tecrit, a strong, or, as it was universally esteem∣ed till the age of Tamerlane, an impregnable fortress of the independent Arabs <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">For the identity of Virtha and Tecrit, see d'Anville, Geo∣graphie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 201.

The Persian biographer exaggerates the merit and difficulty of this exploit, which delivered the caravans of Bagdad from a formidable gang of robbers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218"/>
The defence of the East against the arms of Sapor, required and would have exercised the abilities of the most consummate general; and it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Romans.</NOTE> seemed fortunate for the state, that it was the actual province of the brave Ursicinus, who alone deserved the confidence of the soldiers and people. In the hour of danger, Ursicinus <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xviii. 5, 6. xix. 3. xx. 2.) represents the merit and disgrace of Ursicinus with that faithful attention which a soldier owed to his general. Some partiality may be suspected, yet the whole account is consistent and probable.</NOTE> was removed from his station by the intrigues of the eunuchs; and the military command of the East was be∣stowed, by the same influence, on Sabinian, a wealthy and subtle veteran, who had attained the infirmities, without acquiring the experience, of age. By a second order, which issued from the same jealous and inconstant counsels, Ursicinus was again dispatched to the frontier of Mesopota∣mia, and condemned to sustain the labours of a war, the honours of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival. Sabinian fixed his indo∣lent station under the walls of Edessa; and while he amused himself with the idle parade of military exercise, and moved to the sound of flutes in the Pyrrhic dance, the public defence was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former gene∣ral of the East. But whenever Ursicinus recom∣mended any vigorous plan of operations; when he proposed, at the head of a light and active army, to wheel round the foot of the mountains, to intercept the convoys of the enemy, to harass the wide extent of the Persian lines, and to re∣lieve
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
the distress of Amida; the timid and en∣vious commander alleged, that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops. Amida was at length taken; its bravest defenders, who had escaped the sword of the Barbarians, died in the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner; and Ursicinus himself, after supporting the disgrace of a partial enquiry, was punished for the misconduct of Sabinian by the loss of his military rank. But Constantius soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant, that as long as such maxims of go∣vernment were suffered to prevail, the emperor himself would find it no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy. When he had subdued or pacified the Barbarians of the Danube, Constantius proceeded by slow marches into the East; and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of Amida, he formed, with a powerful army, the siege of Bezabde. The walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the battering-rams; the town was reduced to the last extremity; but it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valour of the garrison, till the approach of the rainy season ob∣liged the emperor to raise the siege, and inglo∣riously to retreat into his winter-quarters at An∣tioch <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xx. 11.

<P>In the blind fury of civil discord, Constantius <NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Gaul by the Germans.</NOTE> had abandoned to the Barbarians of Germany the countries of Gaul, which still acknowledged the authority of his rival.

But the emperor, who for a temporary service had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious spirit of the Barbarians, soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies, after they had tasted the richness of the Roman soil.

Forty-five flourishing cities, Tongres, Cologne, Treves, Worms, Spires, Strasburgh, &amp;c. besides a far greater number of
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
towns and villages, were pillaged, and for the most part reduced to ashes. The Barbarians of Germany, still faithful to the maxims of their an∣cestors, abhorred the confinement of walls, to which they applied the odious names of prisons and sepulchres; and fixing their independent ha∣bitations on the banks of rivers, the Rhine, the Moselle, and the Meuse, they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise, by a rude and hasty fortification of large trees, which were felled and thrown across the roads. The Alemanni were established in the modern countries of Al∣sace and Lorraine; the Franks occupied the island of the Batavians, together with an extensive dis∣trict of Brabant, which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xvi. 8.).

Toxandria was a country of woods and morasses, which extended from the neighbourhood of Tongres to the conflux of the Vahal and the Rhine. See Valesius, Notit.

name and nation; and the scene of their de∣vastations was three times more extensive than that of their conquests. At a still greater distance the open towns of Gaul were deserted, and the inhabitants of the fortified cities, who trusted to their strength and vigilance, were obliged to con∣tent themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the inclosure of their walls. The diminished legions, desti∣tute of pay and provisions, of arms and disci∣pline, trembled at the approach, and even at the name, of the Barbarians.</P>
<P>Under these melancholy circumstances, an un∣experienced <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of Julian.</NOTE> youth was appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul, or rather, as he expresses it himself, to exhibit the vain image of Imperial greatness. The retired scholastic edu∣cation of Julian, in which he had been more con∣versant with books than with arms, with the dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and govern∣ment; and when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn, he exclaimed with a sigh, <Q>O Plato, Plato, what a task for a philosopher!</Q> Yet even this speculative philosophy, which men of busi∣ness are too apt to despise, had filled the mind of Julian with the noblest precepts, and the most shining examples; had animated him with the love of virtue, the desire of fame, and the con∣tempt of death.

in the severe discipline of a camp. The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep. Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table, he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers. During the rigour of a Gallic winter, he never suffered a fire in his bed-chamber; and after a short and inter∣rupted slumber, he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor, to dispatch any urgent business, to visit his rounds, or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favourite studies <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">The private life of Julian in Gaul, and the severe discipline which he embraced, are displayed by Ammianus (xvi. 5.), who pro∣fesses to praise, and by Julian himself, who affects to ridicule (Miso∣pogon, p. 340.), a conduct, which, in a prince of the house of Constantine, might justly excite the surprise of mankind.</NOTE>. The precepts of elo∣quence, which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation, were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of conversation and literature, was more fa∣miliarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language, he had attained a competent know∣ledge of the Latin tongue <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Aderat Latine quoque disserenti sufficiens sermo.

derived from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice, tempered by a disposition to clemency; the knowledge of the general prin∣ciples of equity and evidence, and the faculty of patiently investigating the most intricate and te∣dious questions which could be proposed for his discussion. The measures of policy, and the ope∣rations of war, must submit to the various acci∣dents of circumstance and character, and the un∣practised student will often be perplexed in the ap∣plication of the most perfect theory. But in the acquisition of this important science, Julian was assisted by the active vigour of his own genius, as well as by the wisdom and experience of Sallust, an officer of rank, who soon conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friend∣ship; and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths, without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">We are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent minister, whom Julian afterwards created praefect of Gaul. Sallust was speedily recalled by the jealousy of the emperor; and we may still read a sensible but pedantic discourse (p. 240—252), in which Julian deplores the loss of so valuable a friend, to whom he acknowledges himself indebted for his reputation, See La Bleterie, Preface à la Vie de Jovien, p. 20.</NOTE>.</P>

deliverance of Autun. That large and antient city, protected only by a ruined wall and pusil∣lanimous garrison, was saved by the generous re∣solution of a few veterans, who resumed their arms for the defence of their country. In his march from Autun, through the heart of the Gallic provinces, Julian embraced with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage. At the head of a small body of archers, and heavy cavalry, he preferred the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads; and sometimes eluding, and sometimes resisting, the attacks of the Barba∣rians, who were masters of the field, he arrived with honour and safety at the camp near Rheims, where the Roman troops had been ordered to as∣semble. The aspect of their young prince re∣vived the drooping spirit of the soldiers, and they marched from Rheims in search of the enemy, with a confidence which had almost proved fatal to them. The Alemanni, familiarized to the knowledge of the country, secretly collected their scattered forces, and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day, poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of the Romans. Before the in∣evitable disorder could be remedied, two legions were destroyed; and Julian was taught by expe∣rience, that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war. In a second and more successful action, he recovered and estab∣lished his military fame; but as the agility of the Barbarians saved them from the pursuit, his vic∣tory was neither bloody nor decisive. He ad∣vanced, however, to the banks of the Rhine,
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
surveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced himself of the difficulties of the war, and retreated on the approach of winter, discontented with the court, with his army, and with his own success <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xvi. 2, 3.) appears much better satisfied with the success of this first campaign than Julian himself; who very fairly owns that he did nothing of consequence, and that he fled before the enemy.</NOTE>. The power of the enemy was yet unbroken; and the Caesar had no sooner separated his troops, and fixed his own quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of Germans. Reduced in this ex∣tremity to the resources of his own mind, he dis∣played a prudent intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies of the place and garrison; and the Barbarians, at the end of thirty days, were obliged to retire with disappointed rage.</P>
<P>The conscious pride of Julian, who was in∣debted <NOTE PLACE="marg">His second campaign,</NOTE> only to his sword for this signal deliver∣ance, was embittered by the reflection, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 357.</NOTE> was abandoned, betrayed, and perhaps devoted to destruction, by those who were bound to assist him by every tie of honour and fidelity. Mar∣cellus, master-general of the cavalry in Gaul, in∣terpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the court, beheld with supine indifference the distress of Julian, and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens. If the Caesar had dissembled in silence so danger∣ous an insult, his person and authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world; and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
with impunity, the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions, which received a very specious co∣lour from his past conduct towards the princes of the Flavian family. Marcellus was recalled, and gently dismissed from his office <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 7. Libanius speaks rather more advantageously of the military talents of Marcellus, Orat. x. p. 272. And Julian insinuates, that he would not have been so easily recalled, unless he had given other reasons of offence to the court, p. 278.</NOTE>. In his room Severus was appointed general of the cavalry; an experienced soldier, of approved courage and fidelity, who could advise with respect, and exe∣cute with zeal; and who submitted, without re∣luctance, to the supreme command which Julian, by the interest of his patroness Eusebia, at length obtained over the armies of Gaul <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Severus, non discors, non arrogans, sed longa militiae frugali∣tate compertus; et eum recta praeeuntem secuturus, ut ductorem mo∣rigerus miles. Ammian. xvi. 11. Zosimus, l. iii. p. 140.</NOTE>. A very ju∣dicious plan of operations was adopted for the ap∣proaching campaign. Julian himself, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of some new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments, and carefully re-established the for∣tifications of Saverne, in an advantageous post, which would either check the incursions, or in∣tercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the same time Barbatio, general of the infantry, advanced from Milan with an army of thirty thousand men, and passing the mountains, prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Basil. It was reasonable to expect that the Ale∣manni, pressed on either side by the Roman arms,
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul, and to hasten to the defence of their native country. But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the envy, or the se∣cret instructions, of Barbatio; who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caesar, and the secret ally of the Barbarians. The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass, and to return almost before the gates of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats, and a superfluous stock of provisions, which would have been of the most essential service to the army of Gaul, was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions. The Germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them; and the igno∣minious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected support; and left him to extricate him∣self from a hazardous situation, where he could neither remain with safety, nor retire with ho∣nour <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">On the design and failure of the co-operation between Julian and Barbatio, see Ammianus (xvi. 11.), and Libanius, Orat. x. p. 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion, the Alemanni prepared to chastise the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stras∣burgh,</NOTE> Roman youth, who presumed to dispute the pos∣session <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

They employed three days, and as many nights, in transporting over the Rhine their military powers. The fierce Chnodomar, shaking the

ponderous javelin, which he had victoriously wielded against the brother of Magnentius, led the van of the Barbarians, and moderated by his experience the martial ardour which his example inspired <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xvi. 12.) describes, with his inflated eloquence, the figure and character of Chnodomar. Audax et fidens ingenti ro∣bore lacertorum, ubi ardor proelii sperabatur immanis, equo spu∣mante, sublimior, erectus in jaculum formidandae vastitatis, armo∣rumque nitore conspicuus: antea strenuus et miles, et utilis praeter caeteros ductor. . . .

He was followed by six other kings, by ten princes of regal extraction, by a long train of high-spirited nobles, and by thirty-five thou∣sand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of Ger∣many. The confidence derived from the view of their own strength, was encreased by the intelli∣gence which they received from a deserter, that the Caesar, with a feeble army of thirteen thou∣sand men, occupied a post about one-and-twenty miles from their camp of Strasburgh. With this inadequate force, Julian resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarian host; and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the Alemanni. The Romans marched in close order, and in two columns, the cavalry on the right, the infantry on the left; and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy, that Julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and food. Yielding, however, with some reluctance,
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
to the clamours of the soldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted them to jus∣tify by their valour the eager impatience, which, in case of a defeat, would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presumption. The trumpets sounded, the military shout was heard through the field, and the two armies rush∣ed with equal fury to the charge. The Caesar, who conducted in person his right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers, and the weight of his cuirassiers. But his ranks were instantly bro∣ken by an irregular mixture of light-horse and of light-infantry, and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of his most renowned cuirassiers <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">After the battle, Julian ventured to revive the rigour of ancient discipline, by exposing these fugitives in female apparel to the de∣rision of the whole camp. In the next campaign, these troops nobly retrieved their honour. Zosimus, l. iii. p. 142.</NOTE>. The fugitives were stop∣ped and rallied by the presence and authority of Julian, who, careless of his own safety, threw himself before them, and urging every motive of shame and honour, led them back against the vic∣torious enemy. The conflict between the two lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody. The Germans possessed the superiority of strength and stature, the Romans that of discipline and tem∣per; and as the Barbarians, who served under the standard of the empire, united the respective advantages of both parties, their strenuous efforts, guided by a skilful leader, at length determined the event of the day. The Romans lost four tribunes, and two hundred and forty-three sol∣diers,

Libanius adds 2000 more to the num∣ber of the slain (Orat. x. p. 274.). But these trifling differences disappear before the 60,000 Barbarians, whom Zosimus has sacrificed to the glory of his hero (l. iii. p. 141.). We might attribute this extravagant number to the carelessness of transcribers, if this cre∣dulous or partial historian had not swelled the army of 35,000 Ale∣manni to an innumerable multitude of barbarians, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

Chnodomar himself was surrounded and taken prisoner, with three of his brave companions, who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death the fate of their chief∣tain. Julian received him with military pomp in the council of his officers; and expressing a ge∣nerous pity for the fallen state, dissembled his in∣ward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive. Instead of exhibiting the vanquished king of the Alemanni, as a grateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul, he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendid trophy of his victory. Chnodomar experienced an honourable treatment: but the impatient Barbarian could not long

<P>After Julian had repulsed the Alemanni from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Julian sub∣dues the Franks,</NOTE> the provinces of the Upper Rhine, he turned his arms against the Franks, who were seated nearer <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine, they professed a dis∣interested love of war; which they considered as the supreme honour and felicity of human nature; and their minds and bodies were so completely hardened by perpectual action, that, according to the lively expression of an orator, the snows of winter were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring. In the month of December, which followed the battle of Strasburg, Julian attacked a body of six hundred Franks, who had thrown themselves into two castles on the Meuse <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xvii. 2. Libanius, Orat. x. p. 278. The Greek orator, by misapprehending a passage of Julian, has been induced to represent the Franks as consisting of a thousand men; and as his head was always full of the Peloponnesian war, he compares them to the Lacedaemonians, who were besieged and taken in the island of Sphacteria.</NOTE>. In the midst of that severe season they sustained, with inflexible constancy, a siege of fifty-four days; till at length, exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river, left them no hopes of escape, the

The ob∣stinate resistance of this handful of Franks, ap∣prised Julian of the difficulties of the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring, against the whole body of the nation. His rapid dili∣gence surprised and astonished the active Bar∣barians. Ordering his soldiers to provide them∣selves with biscuit for twenty days, he suddenly pitched his camp near Tongres, while the enemy still supposed him in his winter-quarters of Paris, expecting the slow arrival of his convoys from Aquitain. Without allowing the Franks to unite or to deliberate, he skilfully spread his legions from Cologne to the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the success of his arms, soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the cle∣mency, and to obey the commands, of their con∣queror. The Chamavians submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine: but the Salians were permitted to possess their new establishment of Toxandria, as the subjects and

auxiliaries of the Roman empire <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvii. 8. Zosimus, l. iii. p. 146—150. (his narrative is darkened by a mixture of fable); and Julian. ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 280. His expression, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This difference of treatment confirms the opinion, that the Salian Franks were permitted to retain the settlements in Tox∣andria.</NOTE>. The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths; and perpetual in∣spectors were appointed to reside among the Franks, with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the conditions. An incident is re∣lated, interesting enough in itself, and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian, who ingeni∣ously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the tragedy. When the Chamavians sued for peace, he required the son of their king, as the only hostage in whom he could rely. A mournful silence, interrupted by tears and groans, declared the sad perplexity of the Barbarians; and their aged chief lamented in pathetic lan∣guage, that his private loss was now embittered by a sense of the public calamity. While the Chamavians lay prostrate at the foot of his throne, the royal captive, whom they believed to have been slain, unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and as soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention, the Caesar addressed the assembly in the following terms: <Q>Behold the son, the prince, whom you wept. You had lost him by your fault. God and the Romans have restored him to you. I shall still preserve and educate the youth, rather as a monument of my own virtue, than as a pledge of your sin∣cerity. Should you presume to violate the

<P>It was not enough for Julian to have delivered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes three ex∣peditions beyond the Rhine,</NOTE> the provinces of Gaul from the Barbarians of Germany. He aspired to emulate the glory of the first and most illustrious of the emperors; after <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

But Zosimus (l. iii. p. 140.) seems to have derived his in∣formation only from the Orations (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and the Epistles of Julian. The discourse which is addressed to the Athenians contains an accu∣rate, though general, account of the war against the Germans.</NOTE>. Caesar has related, with conscious pride, the manner in which he <HI>twice</HI> passed the Rhine. Julian could boast, that before he assumed the title of Augustus, he had carried the Roman Eagles beyond that great river in <HI>three</HI> successful expeditions <NOTE N="85" PLACE="foot">See Ammian. xvii. 1. 10. xviii. 2. and Zosim. l. iii. p. 144. Julian ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 280.</NOTE>. The consterna∣tion of the Germans, after the battle of Strasburgh, encouraged him to the first attempt; and the reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of a leader, who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers. The villages on either
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
side of the Meyn, which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle, felt the ravages of an in∣vading army. The principal houses, constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance, were consumed by the flames; and the Caesar boldly advanced about ten miles, till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest, under∣mined by subterraneous passages, which threaten∣ed, with secret snares and ambush, every step of the assailant. The ground was already covered with snow; and Julian, after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce of ten months to the submissive Bar∣barians. At the expiration of the truce, Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine, to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire, two of the kings of the Alemanni, who had been pre∣sent at the battle of Strasburgh. They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remain∣ed alive; and as the Caesar had procured an ex∣act account from the cities and villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had lost, he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy, which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge. His third expedition was still more splendid and im∣portant than the two former. The Germans had collected their military powers, and moved along the opposite banks of the river, with a design of destroying the bridge, and of preventing the pas∣sage of the Romans. But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion. Three hundred light armed and active soldiers
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
were detached in forty small boats, to fall down the stream in silence, and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy. They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity, that they had almost surprised the Barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxi∣cation from one of their nocturnal festivals. Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation, it is sufficient to observe, that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni, three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a Ro∣man camp. Followed by twenty thousand cap∣tives, whom he had rescued from the chains of the Barbarians, the Caesar repassed the Rhine, after terminating a war, the success of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories.</P>
<P>As soon as the valour and conduct of Julian <NOTE PLACE="marg">Restores the cities of Gaul.</NOTE> had secured an interval of peace, he applied him∣self to a work more congenial to his humane and philosophic temper. The cities of Gaul, which had suffered from the inroads of the Barbarians, he diligently repaired; and seven important posts, between Mentz and the mouth of the Rhine, are particularly mentioned, as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xviii. 2. Libanius, Orat. x. p. 279, 280. Of these seven posts, four are at present towns of some consequence; Bin∣gen, Andernach, Bonn, and Nuyss. The other three, Tricesimae, Quadriburgium, and Castra Herculis, or Heraclea, no longer sub∣sist; but there is room to believe, that, on the ground of Quadri∣burgium, the Dutch have constructed the fort of Schenk, a name so offensive to the fastidious delicacy of Boileau. See d'Anville Notice de l'ancienne Gaule, p. 183. Boileau, Epitre iv. and the notes.</NOTE>. The van∣quished
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
Germans had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing and convey∣ing the necessary materials. The active zeal of Julian urged the prosecution of the work; and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops, that the auxiliaries themselves, waving their exemption from any duties of fatigue, con∣tended in the most servile labours with the dili∣gence of the Roman soldiers. It was incumbent on the Caesar to provide for the subsistence, as well as for the safety, of the inhabitants and of the garrisons. The desertion of the former, and the mutiny of the latter, must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine. The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been inter∣rupted by the calamities of war; but the scanty harvests of the continent were supplied, by his pa∣ternal care, from the plenty of the adjacent island. Six hundred large barks, framed in the forest of the Ardennes, made several voyages to the coast of Britain; and returning from thence laden with corn, sailed up the Rhine, and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and fortresses along the banks of the river <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">We may credit Julian himself, Orat. ad S. P. Q. Athenien∣sem, p. 280. who gives a very particular account of the transaction. Zosimus adds two hundred vessels more, l. iii. p. 145. If we compute the 600 corn ships of Julian at only seventy tons each, they were capable of exporting 120,000 quarters (See Arbuthnot's Weights and Measures, p. 237.); and the country, which could bear so large an exportation, must already have attained an improved state of agriculture.</NOTE>. The arms of Julian had
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
restored a free and secure navigation, which Con∣stantius had offered to purchase at the expence of his dignity, and of a tributary present of two thou∣sand pounds of silver. The emperor parsimo∣niously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted with a lavish and trembling hand to the Barbarians. The dexterity, as well as the firm∣ness of Julian, was put to a severe trial, when he took the field with a discontented army, which had already served two campaigns, without re∣ceiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">The troops once broke out into a mutiny, immediately before the second passage of the Rhine. Ammian. xvii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A tender regard for the peace and happiness of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil ad∣ministra∣tion of Julian.</NOTE> his subjects, was the ruling principle which di∣rected, or seemed to direct, the administration of Julian <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 5. xviii. 1. Mamertinus in Panegyr. Vet. xi. 4.</NOTE>. He devoted the leisure of his winter-quarters to the offices of civil government; and affected to assume, with more pleasure, the cha∣racter of a magistrate than that of a general. Be∣fore he took the field, he devolved on the pro∣vincial governors, most of the public and private causes which had been referred to his tribunal; but, on his return, he carefully revised their pro∣ceedings, mitigated the rigour of the law, and pronounced a second judgment on the judges themselves. Superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds, an indiscreet and intemperate zeal for justice, he restrained, with calmness and dignity, the warmth of an advocate who prose∣cuted,
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
for extortion, the president of the Nar∣bonnese province. <Q>Who will ever be found guilty, exclaimed the vehement Delphidius, if it be enough to deny?</Q> <Q>and who, replied Julian, will ever be innocent, if it is sufficient to affirm?</Q> In the general administration of peace and war, the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people; but Constantius would have thought himself deeply injured, if the virtues of Julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country. The prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty, might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of the inferior agents; to ex∣pose their corrupt arts, and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection. But the manage∣ment of the finances was more safely entrusted to Florentius, Praetorian praefect of Gaul, an effe∣minate tyrant, incapable of pity or remorse; and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition, while Julian himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behaviour. The Caesar had rejected with abhorrence, a mandate for the levy of an extra∣ordinary tax; a new superdiction, which the prae∣fect had offered for his signature; and the faithful picture of the public misery, by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal, offended the court of Constantius. We may enjoy the plea∣sure of reading the sentiments of Julian, as he ex∣presses them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most intimate friends. After stating
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
his own conduct, he proceeds in the following terms: <Q>Was it possible for the disciple of Plato and Aristotle to act otherwise than I have done? Could I abandon the unhappy subjects entrusted to my care? Was I not called upon to defend them from the repeated injuries of these unfeeling robbers? A tribune who de∣serts his post is punished with death, and de∣prived of the honours of burial. With what justice could I pronounce <HI>his</HI> sentence, if, in the hour of danger, I myself neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important? God has placed me in this elevated post; his pro∣vidence will guard and support me. Should I be condemned to suffer, I shall derive comfort from the testimony of a pure and upright con∣science. Would to heaven, that I still possessed a counsellor like Sallust! If they think proper to send me a successor, I shall submit without reluctance; and had much rather improve the short opportunity of doing good, than enjoy a long and lasting impunity of evil <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvii. 3. Julian. Epistol. xv. edit. Spanheim. Such a conduct almost justifies the encomium of Mamertinus. Ita illi anni spatia divisa sunt, ut aut Barbaros domitet, aut civibus jura restituat; perpetuum professus, aut contra hostem, aut contra vitia, cortamen.</NOTE>.</Q> The precarious and dependent situation of Julian dis∣played his virtues, and concealed his defects. The young hero who supported, in Gaul, the throne of Constantius, was not permitted to reform the vices of the government; but he had courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people. Unless he had been able to revive the martial
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
spirit of the Romans, or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among their savage ene∣mies, he could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tranquillity, either by the peace or conquest of Germany.

capital, which now embraces an ample terri∣tory on either side of the Seine, was originally confined to the small island in the midst of the river, from whence the inhabitants derived a supply of pure and salubrious water. The river bathed the foot of the walls; and the town was accessible only by two wooden bridges. A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine; but on the south, the ground, which now bears the name of the University, was insensibly covered with houses, and adorned with a palace and amphi∣theatre, baths, an aqueduct, and a field of Mars for the exercise of the Roman troops. The se∣verity of the climate was tempered by the neigh∣bourhood of the ocean; and with some precau∣tions, which experience had taught, the vine and fig-tree were successfully cultivated. But, in re∣markable winters, the Seine was deeply frozen; and the huge pieces of ice that floated down the stream, might be compared, by an Asiatic, to the blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of Phrygia.

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. <HI>The Motives, Progress, and Effects of the Conversion of Constantine.—Legal Establishment and Constitu∣tion of the Christian or Catholic Church.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE public establishment of Christianity may be considered as one of those im∣portant and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively curiosity, and afford the most valuable instruction. The victories and the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of Europe; but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch; and the eccle∣siastical institutions of his reign are still connected, by an indissoluble chain, with the opinions, the passions, and the interests of the present genera∣tion.</P>
<P>In the consideration of a subject which may be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Date of the conversion of Con∣stantine.</NOTE> examined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed with indifference, a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature; that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of Con∣stantine. The eloquent Lactantius, in the midst <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 306.</NOTE> of his court, seems impatient <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The date of the Divine Institutions of Lactantius has been ac∣curately discussed, difficulties have been started, solutions proposed, and an expedient imagined of two <HI>original</HI> editions; the former pub∣lished during the persecution of Diocletian, the latter under that of Licinius. See Dufresnoy, Prefat. p. v. Tillemont, Mem. Eccle∣siast. tom. vi. p. 465—470. Lardner's Credibility, part ii. vol. vii. p. 78—86. For my own part, I am <HI>almost</HI> convinced that Lactantius dedicated his Institutions to the sovereign of Gaul, at a time when Galerius, Maximin, and even Licinius, persecuted the Christians; that is, between the years 306 and 311.</NOTE> to proclaim to the
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
world the glorious example of the sovereign of Gaul; who, in the first moments of his reign, ac∣knowledged and adored the majesty of the true and only God <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lactant. Divin. Institut. i. 1. vii. 27. The first and most im∣portant of these passages is indeed wanting in twenty-eight manu∣scripts; but it is found in nineteen. If we weigh the comparative value of those manuscripts, one of 900 years old, in the king of France's library, may be alleged in it's favour; but the passage is omitted in the correct manuscript of Bologna, which the P. de Montfaucon ascribes to the sixth or seventh century (Diarium Italic. p. 409.). The taste of most of the editors (except Isaeus, see Lactant. edit. Dufresnoy, tom. i. p. 596.) has felt the genuine style of Lactantius.</NOTE>. The learned Eusebius has as∣cribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign which was displayed in the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the Italian expedition <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Euseb. in Vit. Constant. l. i. c. 27—32.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The per∣plexity <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 326.</NOTE> produced by these discordant authorities, is derived from the behaviour of Constantine him∣self. According to the strictness of ecclesiastical language, the first of the <HI>Christian</HI> emperors was unworthy of that name, till the moment of his death; since it was only during his last illness <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 337.</NOTE> that he received, as a catechumen, the imposition
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
of hands <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">That rite was <HI>always</HI> used in making a catechumen (see Bing∣ham's Antiquities, l. x. c. 1. p. 419. Dom. Chardon, Hist. des Sacremens, tom. i. p. 62.), and Constantine received it for the <HI>first</HI> time (Euseb. in Vit. Constant. l. iv. c. 61.) immediately before his baptism and death. From the connection of these two facts, Valesius (ad loc. Euseb.) has drawn the conclusion which is reluctantly ad∣mitted by Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 628.), and opposed with feeble arguments by Mosheim (p. 968.).</NOTE>, and was afterwards admitted, by the initiatory rites of baptism, into the number of the faithful <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Euseb. in Vit. Constant. l. iv. c. 61, 62, 63. The legend of Constantine's baptism at Rome, thirteen years before his death, was invented in the eighth century, as a proper motive for his <HI>donation.</HI> Such has been the gradual progress of knowledge, that a story, of which Cardinal Baronius (Annal. Ecclesiast. A. D. 324, No. 43—49.) declared himself the unblushing advocate, is now feebly supported, even within the verge of the Vatican. See the Antiqui∣tates Christianae, tom. ii. p. 232; a work published with six appro∣bations at Rome, in the year 1751, by Father Mamachi, a learned Dominican.</NOTE>. The Christianity of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qua∣lified sense; and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible grada∣tions by which the monarch declared himself the protector, and at length the proselyte, of the church. It was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education, to ac∣knowledge the divine power of Christ, and to un∣derstand that the truth of <HI>his</HI> revelation was in∣compatible with the worship of the gods. The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind, instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion; and he insensibly discovered his new opinions, as far as he could enforce them with
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
safety and with effect. During the whole course of his reign, the stream of Christianity flowed with a gentle, though accelerated, motion: but its general direction was sometimes checked, and sometimes diverted, by the accidental circum∣stances of the times, and by the prudence, or pos∣sibly by the caprice, of the monarch. His mini∣sters were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles; <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><Q>The quaestor, or secretary, who composed the law of the Theodosian Code, makes his master say with indifference, <Q>homini∣bus supradictae religionis</Q> (l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 1.).</Q> The minister of ecclesiastical affairs was allowed a more devout and respectful style, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; the legal, most holy, and Catholic worship.

D. 321, No. 18.) censures his profane conduct with truth and asperity.</NOTE>. While this im∣portant revolution yet remained in suspense, the Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety, but with very opposite sentiments. The former were prompted by every motive of zeal, as well as va∣nity, to exaggerate the marks of his favour, and the evidences of his faith. The latter, till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
resentment, attempted to conceal from the world, and from themselves, that the gods of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the num∣ber of their votaries. The same passions and pre∣judices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of Chris∣tianity with the most glorious or the most igno∣minious aera of the reign of Constantine.</P>
<P>Whatever symptoms of Christian piety might <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Pagan supersti∣tion.</NOTE> transpire in the discourses or actions of Constan∣tine, he persevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the established religion <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Theodoret (l. i. c. 18.) seems to insinuate that Helena gave her son a Christian education; but we may be assured, from the superior authority of Eusebius (in Vit. Constant. l. iii. c. 47.), that she herself was indebted to Constantine for the knowledge of Christianity.</NOTE>; and the same conduct which in the court of Nico∣media might be imputed to his fear, could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of Gaul. His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods: the medals which issued from his Imperial mint are impressed with the figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo, of Mars and Hercules; and his filial piety increased the council of Olympus by the solemn apotheosis of his father Constantius <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">See the medals of Constantine in Ducange and Banduri. As few cities had retained the privilege of coining, almost all the medals of that age issued from the mint under the sanction of the Imperial authority.</NOTE>. But the devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly di∣rected to the genius of the Sun, the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology; and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
God of Light and Poetry. The unerring shafts of that deity, the brightness of his eyes, his laurel wreath, immortal beauty, and elegant accom∣plishments, seem to point him out as the patron of a young hero. The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of Constantine; and the credulous multitude were taught to be∣lieve, that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tu∣telar deity; and that, either waking or in a vision, he was blessed with the auspicious omens of a long and victorious reign. The Sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine; and the Pagans might reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrate∣ful favourite <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">The panegyric of Eumenius (vii. inter Panegyr. Vet.), which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war, abounds with the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of Con∣stantine, and of his particular veneration for Apollo, or the Sun; to which Julian alludes (Orat. vii. p. 228. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.). See Com∣mentaire de Spanheim sur les Césars, p. 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As long as Constantine exercised a limited <NOTE PLACE="marg">He pro∣tects the Christians of Gaul,</NOTE> sovereignty over the provinces of Gaul, his Chris∣tian subjects were protected by the authority, and perhaps by the laws, of a prince, who wisely left <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 306—312.</NOTE> to the gods the care of vindicating their own ho∣nour. If we may credit the assertion of Constan∣tine himself, he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted, by the hands of Roman soldiers, on those citizens whose religion was their only crime <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Constantin. Orat. ad Sanctos, c. 25. But it might easily be shewn, that the Greek translator has improved the sense of the Latin original; and the aged emperor might recollect the persecution of Diocletian with a more lively abhorrence than he had actually felt in the days of his youth and Paganism.</NOTE> In the East and
<PB N="244" REF="251"/>
in the West, he had seen the different effects of severity and indulgence; and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of Ga∣lerius, his implacable enemy, the latter was re∣commended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father. The son of Constan∣tius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of persecution, and granted the free exercise of their religious ceremonies to all those who had al∣ready professed themselves members of the church. They were soon encouraged to depend on the favour as well as on the justice of their sovereign, who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of Christ, and for the God of the Christians <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">See Euseb.

<P>About five months after the conquest of Italy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

In the personal interview of the two western princes, Constantine, by the ascendant of genius and power, obtained the ready concur∣rence of his colleague Licinius; the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of Maximin; and, after the death of the tyrant of the East, the edict of Milan was received as a ge∣neral and fundamental law of the Roman world <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Caecilius (de Mort. Persecut. c. 48.) has preserved the Latin original; and Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. 5.) has given a Greektranslation of this perpetual edict, which refers to some provisional regulations.</NOTE>.
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly deprived. It was enacted, that the places of worship, and public lands, which had been confiscated, should be restored to the church, without dispute, without delay, and without expence: and this severe in∣junction was accompanied with a gracious pro∣mise, that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price, they should be indemnified from the Imperial treasury. The salutary regu∣lations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful, are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration; and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an ad∣vantageous and honourable distinction. The two emperors proclaim to the world, that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Chris∣tians, and to all others, of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has addicted his mind, and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use. They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict, which was designed to establish and secure, without any limitation, the claims of religious liberty. They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration: the hu∣mane intention of consulting the peace and hap∣piness
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
of their people; and the pious hope, that, by such a conduct, they shall appease and pro∣pitiate <HI>the Deity,</HI> whose seat is in heaven. They gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favour; and they trust that the same Providence will for ever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people. From these vague and inde∣finite expressions of piety, three suppositions may be deduced, of a different, but not of an incom∣patible, nature. The mind of Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian re∣ligions. According to the loose and complying notions of polytheism, he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>many</HI> deities who composed the hierarchy of heaven. Or per∣haps he might embrace the philosophic and pleas∣ing idea, that, notwithstanding the variety of names, of rites, and of opinions, all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the wor∣ship of the common Father and Creator of the universe <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">A panegyric of Constantine, pronounced seven or eight months after the edict of Milan (see Gothofred. Chronolog. Legum, p. 7. and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs tom. iv. p. 246.), uses the following remarkable expression: <Q>Summe rerum sator, cujus tot nomina sunt, quot linguas gentium esse voluisti, quem enim te ipse dici velis, scire non possumus.</Q> Panegyr. Vet. ix. 26. In explaining Constantine's progress in the faith, Mosheim (p. 971, &amp;c.) is ingenious, subtle, prolix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of temporal advantage, than <NOTE PLACE="marg">Use and beauty of the Christ∣ian mo∣rality.</NOTE> by considerations of abstract and speculative truth. The partial and increasing favour of Constantine
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Chris∣tians; and to a persuasion, that the propagation of the gospel would inculcate the practice of pri∣vate and public virtue. Whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct, whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions, it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obliga∣tions of society. But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious. They seldom inspire virtue, they cannot always restrain vice. Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn, nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit. The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of educa∣tion and of opinion. But every principle which had once maintained the vigour and purity of Rome and Sparta, was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire. Philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind, but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan supersti∣tion. Under these discouraging circumstances, a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure, benevolent, and universal sys∣tem of ethics, adapted to every duty and every condition of life; recommended as the will and reason of the Supreme Deity, and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments. The experience of Greek and Roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation; and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the flattering, and indeed reasonable, assurances of Lactantius. The eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect, and almost ventured to promise, <HI>that</HI> the esta∣blishment of Christianity would restore the inno∣cence and felicity of the primitive age; <HI>that</HI> the worship of the true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent; <HI>that</HI> every impure desire, every angry or selfish passion, would be restrained by the knowledge of the gospel; and <HI>that</HI> the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety, of equity and moderation, of harmony and universal love <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">See the elegant description of Lactantius (Divin. Institut. v. 8.), who is much more perspicuous and positive than it becomes a discreet prophet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The passive and unresisting obedience, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theory and prac∣tice of pas∣sive obedi∣ence.</NOTE> bows under the yoke of authority, or even of op∣pression, must have appeared, in the eyes of an absolute monarch, the most conspicuous and use∣ful of the evangelic virtues <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">The political system of the Christians is explained by Grotius, de Jure Belli et Pacis, l. i. c. 3, 4. Grotius was a republican and an exile, but the mildness of his temper inclined him to support the established powers.</NOTE>. The primitive Christians derived the institution of civil govern∣ment, not from the consent of the people, but from the decrees of heaven. The reigning em∣peror, though he had usurped the sceptre by trea∣son
<PB N="249" REF="256"/>
and murder, immediately assumed the sacred character of vicegerent of the Deity. To the Deity alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power; and his subjects were indissolubly bound, by their oath of fidelity, to a tyrant, who had violated every law of nature and society. The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among wolves; and since they were not permitted to employ force, even in the defence of their religion, they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow-creatures, in disputing the vain privileges, or the sordid possessions, of this transitory life. Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle, who in the reign of Nero had preached the duty of un∣conditional submission, the Christians of the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy, or open rebellion. While they experienced the rigour of persecution, they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field, or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and se∣questered corner of the globe <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Tertullian.

The protestants of France, of Germany, and of Britain, who as∣serted with such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom, have been insulted by the in∣vidious comparison between the conduct of the

See his Dia∣logue de Jure Regni apud Scotos, tom. ii. p. 28. 30. edit. fol. Ruddiman.</NOTE>. Perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness, as well as to its virtue. A sect of unwarlike ple∣beians, without leaders, without arms, without fortifications, must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the Roman legions. But the Christians, when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian, or solicited the favour of Constantine, could allege, with truth and confidence, that they held the prin∣ciple of passive obedience, and that, in the space of three centuries, their conduct had always been conformable to their principles. They might add, that the throne of the emperors would be established on a fixed and permanent basis, if all their subjects embracing the Christian doctrine, should learn to suffer and to obey.</P>
<P>In the general order of Providence, princes and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divine right of Constan∣tine.</NOTE> tyrants are considered as the ministers of Heaven, appointed to rule or to chastise the nations of the earth. But sacred history affords many illustrious
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
examples of the more immediate interposition of the Deity in the government of his chosen people. The sceptre and the sword were committed to the hands of Moses, of Joshua, of Gideon, of David, of the Maccabees; the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of the Divine favour, the success of their arms was destined to atchieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church. If the judges of Israel were occasional and tem∣porary magistrates, the kings of Judah derived from the royal unction of their great ancestor, an hereditary and indefeasible right, which could not be forfeited by their own vices, nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects. The same extraor∣dinary providence, which was no longer confined to the Jewish people, might elect Constantine and his family as the protectors of the Christian world; and the devout Lactantius announces, in a pro∣phetic tone, the future glories of his long and universal reign <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Lactant. Divin. Institut. i. 1. Eusebius, in the course of his history, his life, and his oration, repeatedly inculcates the divine right of Constantine to the empire.</NOTE>. Galerius and Maximin, Max∣entius and Licinius, were the rivals who shared with the favourite of heaven the provinces of the empire. The tragic deaths of Galerius and Maxi∣min soon gratified the resentment, and fulfilled the sanguine expectations, of the Christians. The success of Constantine against Maxentius and Li∣cinius, removed the two formidable competitors who still opposed the triumph of the second David, and his cause might seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence. The cha∣racter
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
of the Roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature; and though the Christians might enjoy his precarious favour, they were ex∣posed, with the rest of his subjects, to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty. The con∣duct of Licinius soon betrayed the reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and hu∣mane regulations of the edict of Milan. The convocation of provincial synods was prohibited in his dominions; his Christian officers were ig∣nominiously dismissed; and if he avoided the guilt, or rather danger, of a general persecution, his partial oppressions were rendered still more odious, by the violation of a solemn and volun∣tary engagement <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Our imperfect knowledge of the persecution of Licinius is de∣rived from Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. 8. Vit. Constantin. l. i. c. 49—56. l. ii. c. 1, 2.). Aurelius Victor mentions his cruelty in general terms.</NOTE>. While the East, according to the lively expression of Eusebius, was involved in the shades of infernal darkness, the auspicious rays of celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the West. The piety of Constantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the justice of his arms; and his use of victory con∣firmed the opinion of the Christians, that their hero was inspired, and conducted, by the Lord of Hosts. The conquest of Italy produced a gene∣ral edict of toleration: and as soon as the defeat of Licinius had invested Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world, he immediately, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 324.</NOTE> by circular letters, exhorted all his subjects to imitate, without delay, the example of their sove∣reign,

<P>The assurance that the elevation of Constan∣tine <NOTE PLACE="marg">Loyalty and zeal of the Christ∣ian party.</NOTE> was intimately connected with the designs of Providence, instilled into the minds of the Christ∣ians two opinions, which, by very different means, assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy. Their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favour every resource of human industry; and they confidently expected that their strenuous ef∣forts would be seconded by some divine and mira∣culous aid. The enemies of Constantine have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the Catholic church, and which apparently contributes to the success of his ambition. In the beginning of the fourth century, the Christians still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire; but among a degenerate people, who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves, the spirit and union of a religious party might as∣sist the popular leader, to whose service, from a principle of conscience, they had devoted their lives and fortunes <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of the last century, the Papists of England were only a <HI>thirtieth,</HI> and the Protestants of France only a <HI>fifteenth</HI> part of the respective nations, to whom their spirit and power were a con∣stant object of apprehension. See the relations which Bentivoglio (who was then nuncio at Brussels, and afterwards cardinal) trans∣mitted to the court of Rome (Relazione, tom. ii. p. 211. 241.).

of public offices, he had the advantage of strengthening his government, by the choice of ministers or generals, in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence. By the influence of these dignified missionaries, the pro∣selytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army; the Barbarians of Germany, who filled the ranks of the legions, were of a care∣less temper, which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander; and when they passed the Alps, it may fairly be presumed, that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of Constantine <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">This careless temper of the Germans appears almost uniformly in the history of the conversion of each of the tribes. The legions of Constantine were recruited with Germans (Zosimus, l. ii. p. 86.); and the court even of his father had been filled with Christians. See the first book of the Life of Constantine, by Eusebius.</NOTE>. The habits of mankind, and the interest of religion, gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed, which had so long prevailed among the Christians; and in the coun∣cils which were assembled under the gracious pro∣tection of Constantine, the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath, and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">De his qui arma projiciunt in <HI>pace,</HI> placuit eos abstinere a com∣munione.

A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects of Maxentius and Licinius; and the re∣sentment which the latter did not attempt to con∣ceal, served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor. The regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces, enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs, and to transmit without danger any useful intelli∣gence, or any pious contributions, which might promote the service of Constantine, who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deli∣verance of the church <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Eusebius always considers the second civil war against Licinius as a sort of religious crusade.

The authority of the church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion of Constantine, who in the same prudent and gradual progress acknowledged the truth, and assumed the symbol, of Christianity. But the testimony of a contemporary writer, who in a formal treatise has avenged the cause of reli∣gion, bestows on the piety of the emperor a more awful and sublime character. He affirms with the most perfect confidence, that in the night which preceded the last battle against Maxentius, Constantine was admonished in a dream to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the <HI>celestial sign of God,</HI> the sacred monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the commands of heaven, and that his valour and obedience were rewarded by the decisive victory of the Milvian bridge.

Three arguments from the title of the book, and from the names of Donatus and Caecilius, are produced by the advocates for Lactantius (See the P. Lestocq, tom. ii. p. 46—60.).

In favour of Licinius, who still dissembled his animosity to the Christians, the same author has provided a similar vision, of a form of prayer, which was communicated by an angel, and re∣peated by the whole army before they engaged the legions of the tyrant Maximin. The frequent repetition of miracles serves to provoke, where it does not subdue, the reason of mankind <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Caecilius, de M. P. c. 46.

Yet even this angel is favourably entertained by Pagi, Tillemont, Fleury, &amp;c. who are fond of en∣creasing their stock of miracles.</NOTE>; but if the dream of Constantine is separately consider∣ed, it may be naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor.

One circumstance may be observed, in which the modern churches have materially departed from the ancient custom. The sacrament of baptism (even when it was administered to infants) was immediately followed by confirm∣ation and the holy communion.</NOTE>

was regularly administered by the bishop himself, with his assistant clergy, in the cathedral church of the diocese, during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of Easter and Pen∣tecost; and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church. The discretion of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they could understand the obligations which they con∣tracted: the severity of ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a noviciate of two or three years; and the catechumens themselves, from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual na∣ture, were seldom impatient to assume the cha∣racter of perfect and initiated Christians. The sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and the soul was instantly restored to its original purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity, there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite, which could not be repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege, which could never be recovered. By the delay of their baptism, they could venture freely to indulge their passions in

The ingenious rhetoric of Chrysostom could find only three arguments against these prudent Christians. 1. That we should love and pursue virtue for her own sake, and not merely for the reward. 2. That we may be surprised by death without an opportunity of baptism. 3. That although we shall be placed in heaven, we shall only twinkle like little stars, when compared to the suns of righteousness who have run their appointed course with labour, with success, and with glory. Chrysostom in Epist. ad Hebraeos, Homil. xiii. apud Chardon, Hist. des Sacremens, tom. i. p. 49.

The sublime theory of the gospel had made a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of Constantine himself. He pursued the great object of his am∣bition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy; and, after the victory, he abandoned himself, without moderation, to the abuse of his fortune. Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect heroism and prophane phi∣losophy of Trajan and the Antonines, the mature age of Constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth. As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth, he propor∣tionably declined in the practice of virtue; and the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of Nice, was polluted by the execution, or rather murder, of his eldest son.

The bishops, whom he summoned, in his last illness, to the palace of Nicomedia, were edified by the fervour with which he requested and re∣ceived the sacrament of baptism, by the solemn protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a disciple of Christ, and by his hum∣ble refusal to wear the Imperial purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a Neo∣phyte.

The domestic juris∣diction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the ecclesiastical order, whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the cog∣nizance of a secular judge. Their venial offences were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment; and the gentle correction, which the tenderness of youth may endure from its pa∣rents or instructors, was inflicted by the temperate severity of the bishops. But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honourable and beneficial profession, the Roman magistrate drew the sword of justice, without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities. 3. The arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law; and the judges were instructed to execute, without appeal or delay, the episcopal decrees, whose va∣lidity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties. The conversion of the magistrates themselves, and of the whole empire, might gra∣dually remove the fears and scruples of the Chris∣tians.

The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the demagogues of Athens, and the tribunes of Rome; the custom of preaching, which seems to constitute a con∣siderable part of Christian devotion, had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity; and the ears of monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence, till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators, who possessed some advantages unknown to their pro∣fane predecessors <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">See Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. ii. l. iii. c. 83. p. 1761—1770.) and Bingham (Antiquities, vol. i. l. xiv. c. 4. p. 688—717.).

The most sublime representations of the attributes and laws of the Deity were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical subtleties, puerile rites, and fictitious miracles: and they expatiated, with the most fervent zeal, on the religious merit of hating the adversaries, and obeying the ministers, of the church. When the public peace was distracted by heresy and schism, the sacred orators sounded the trumpet, of discord, and perhaps of sedition. The understandings of their congre∣gations were perplexed by mystery, their passions were inflamed by invectives: and they rushed from the Christian temples of Antioch or Alexan∣dria, prepared either to suffer or to inflict martyr∣dom.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. <HI>Persecution of Heresy.—The Schism of the Donatists.—The Arian Controversy.—Athanasius.—Distracted State of the Church and Empire under Constantine and his Sons.—Toleration of Paganism.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their in∣terest. Constantine gave them security, wealth, honours, and revenge: and the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate. The edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world, the privilege of chusing and professing his own religion. But this inestimable privilege was soon violated: with the knowledge of truth, the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution; and the sects which dissented from the Catholic church, were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity. Constantine easily believed that the Heretics, who presumed to dispute <HI>his</HI> opinions, or to oppose <HI>his</HI> commands, were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy; and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation. Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy. But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace, the conquest of the East was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Eusebius in Vit. Constantin. l. iii. c. 63, 64, 65, 66.</NOTE>. After a preamble filled with passion and reproach, Constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics, and con∣fiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church. The sects against whom the Imperial severity was directed, appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata; the Montanists of Phrygia, who main∣tained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy; the Novatians, who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and Va∣lentinians, under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied; and perhaps the Manichaeans, who had recently imported from Persia a more artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">After some examination of the various opinions of Tillemont, Beausobre, Lardner, &amp;c. I am convinced that Manes did not propa∣gate his sect, even in Persia, before the year 270. It is strange, that a philosophic and foreign heresy should have penetrated so rapid∣ly into the African provinces; yet I cannot easily reject the edict of Diocletian against the Manichaeans, which may be found in Baronius. (Annal. Eccl. A. D. 287.)</NOTE>. The design of extirpating the name, or at least of restraining the progress of these odious Heretics, was prose∣cuted with vigour and effect. Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocle∣tian; and this method of conversion was applauded
<PB N="308" REF="315"/>
by the same bishops who had felt the hand of op∣pression, and had pleaded for the rights of huma∣nity. Two immaterial circumstances may serve, however, to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry. Before he condemned the Mani∣chaeans and their kindred sects, he resolved to make an accurate enquiry into the nature of their religious principles. As if he distrusted the im∣partiality of his ecclesiastical counsellors, this delicate commission was entrusted to a civil magistrate; whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed; and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Constantinus, enim cum limatius superstitionum quaereret sectas, Manichaeorum et similium, &amp;c.

The emperor was soon convinced, that he had too hastily proscribed the orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians; who had dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which were not per∣haps essential to salvation. By a particular edict, he exempted them from the general penalties of the law <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cod. Theod. l. xvi. tit. v. leg. 2.

<P>The complaints and mutual accusations which <NOTE PLACE="marg">African contro∣versy,</NOTE> assailed the throne of Constantine, as soon as the death of Maxentius had submitted Africa to his <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 312.</NOTE> victorious arms, were ill adapted to edify an im∣perfect proselyte. He learned, with surprise, that the provinces of that great country, from the con∣fines of Cyrene to the columns of Hercules, were distracted with religious discord <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The best materials for this part of ecclesiastical history may be found in the edition of Optatus Milevitanus, published (Paris 1700) by M. Dupin, who has enriched it with critical notes, geographical discussions, original records, and an accurate abridgement of the whole controversy. M. de Tillemont has bestowed on the Donatists the greatest part of a volume (tom. vi. part i.): and I am indebted to him for an ample collection of all the passages of his favourite St. Augustin, which relate to those heretics.</NOTE>. The source of the division was derived from a double election in the church of Carthage; the second, in rank and opulence, of the ecclesiastical thrones of the West. Caecilian and Majorinus were the two rival pri∣mates of Africa; and the death of the latter soon made room for Donatus, who, by his superior abilities and apparent virtues, was the firmest support of his party. The advantage which Caecilian might claim from the priority of his ordination, was destroyed by the illegal, or at least indecent, haste, with which it had been per∣formed, without expecting the arrival of the
<PB N="310" REF="317"/>
bishops of Numidia. The authority of these bishops, who, to the number of seventy, con∣demned Caecilian, and consecrated Majorinus, is again weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters; and by the female intrigues, sacrilegious bargains, and tumultuous proceedings which are imputed to this Numidian council <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Schisma igitur illo tempore confusae mulieris iracundia peperit; ambitus nutrivit; avaritia roboravit. Optatus, l. i. c. 19. The language of Purpurius is that of a furious madman. Dicitur te necasse filios sororis tuae duos. Purpurius respondit: Putas me terreri à te . . . occidi; et occido eos qui contra me faciunt. Acta Concil, Cirtensis, ad calc. Optat. p. 274. When Caecilian was invited to an assembly of bishops, Purpurius said to his brethren, or rather to his accomplices, <Q>Let him come hither to receive our imposition of hands; and we will break his head by way of penance.</Q> Optat. l. i. c. 19.</NOTE>. The bishops of the contending factions main∣tained, with equal ardour and obstinacy, that their adversaries were degraded, or at least dishonoured, by the odious crime of delivering the Holy Scrip∣tures to the officers of Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, as well as from the story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferred, that the late persecution had embittered the zeal, without reforming the manners, of the African Christians. That divided church was incapable of affording an impartial judicature; the con∣troversy was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals, which were appointed by the emperor; and the whole proceeding, from the first appeal to the final sentence, lasted above three years. A severe inquisition, which was taken by the Praetorian vicar, and the proconsul of Africa, the report of two episcopal visitors who had been sent
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
to Carthage, the decrees of the councils of Rome and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of Con∣stantine himself in his sacred consistory, were all favourable to the cause of Caecilian; and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and eccle∣siastical powers, as the true and lawful primate of Africa. The honours and estates of the church were attributed to <HI>his</HI> suffragan bishops, and it was not without difficulty, that Constantine was satis∣fied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal leaders of the Donatist faction. As their cause was examined with attention, perhaps it was determined with justice. Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation, that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious arts of his favourite Osius. The influence of falsehood and corruption might pro∣cure the condemnation of the innocent, or aggra∣vate the sentence of the guilty. Such an act, however, of injustice, if it concluded an impor∣tunate dispute, might be numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration, which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity.</P>
<P>But this incident, so inconsiderable that it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Schism of the Do∣natists,</NOTE> scarcely deserves a place in history, was productive of a memorable schism; which afflicted the pro∣vinces <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 315</NOTE> of Africa above three hundred years, and was extinguished only with Christianity itself. The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism ani∣mated the Donatists to refuse obedience to the usurpers, whose election they disputed, and whose spiritual powers they denied. Excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind,
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind, who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian, and of the Traditors, from whom he derived his pretended ordination. They asserted with con∣fidence, and almost with exultation, that the Apostolical succession was interrupted; that <HI>all</HI> the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism; and that the prerogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers, who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline. This rigid theory was supported by the most uncharitable conduct. Whenever they acquired a proselyte, even from the distant provinces of the East, they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">The councils of Arles, of Nice, and of Trent, confirmed the wise and moderate practice of the church of Rome. The Donatists, however, had the advantage of maintaining the sentiment of Cyprian, and of a considerable part of the primitive church. Vincentius Liri∣nensis (p. 332. ap. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. vi. p. 138.) has explained why the Donatists are eternally burning with the Devil, while St. Cyprian reigns in heaven with Jesus Christ.</NOTE> and ordina∣tion; as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of here∣tics or schismatics. Bishops, virgins, and even spotless infants, were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance, before they could be admitted to the communion of the Donatists. If they ob∣tained possession of a church which had been used by their Catholic adversaries, they purified the unhallowed building with the same jealous care which a temple of Idols might have required. They washed the pavement, scraped the walls,
<PB N="313" REF="320"/>
burnt the altar, which was commonly of wood, melted the consecrated plate, and cast the Holy Eucharist to the dogs, with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of religious factions <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">See the sixth book of Optatus Milevitanus, p. 91—100.</NOTE>. Notwith∣standing this irreconcilable aversion, the two par∣ties, who were mixed and separated in all the cities of Africa, had the same language and man∣ners, the same zeal and learning, the same faith and worship. Proscribed by the civil and eccle∣siastical powers of the empire, the Donatists still maintained in some provinces, particularly in Numidia, their superior numbers; and four hun∣dred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate. But the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals; and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions. A fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the independent standard of the Maximianists. The narrow and solitary path which their first leaders had marked out, con∣tinued to deviate from the great society of mankind. Even the imperceptible sect of the Rogatians could affirm, without a blush, that when Christ should descend to judge the earth, he would find his true religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the Caesarean Mau∣ritania <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Tillemont, Mem.

The schism of the Donatists was confined to Africa: the more diffusive mischief of the Trini∣tarian controversy successively penetrated into <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trini∣tarian con∣troversy.</NOTE> every part of the Christian world. The former was an accidental quarrel, occasioned by the abuse of freedom; the latter was a high and mysterious argument, derived from the abuse of philosophy. From the age of Constantine to that of Clovis and Theodoric, the temporal interests both of the Romans and Barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of Arianism. The histo∣rian may therefore be permitted respectfully to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary; and to deduce the progress of reason and faith, of error and pas∣sion, from the school of Plato to the decline and fall of the empire.</P>

The vain hope of extricating himself from these difficulties, which must ever oppress the feeble powers of the human mind, might induce Plato to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification; of the first cause, the reason or <HI>Logos,</HI> and the soul or spirit of the universe. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The LO∣GOS</NOTE> His poetical imagination sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical abstractions; the three <HI>archical</HI> or original principles were represented in the Platonic system as three Gods, united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable genera∣tion; and the Logos was particularly considered under the more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal Father, and the Creator and Governor of the world.

These specula∣tions,

instead of being treated as the amusement of a vacant hour, became the most serious business of the present, and the most useful preparation for a future, life. A theology, which it was incum∣bent to believe, which it was impious to doubt, and which it might be dangerous, and even fatal, to mistake, became the familiar topic of private meditation and popular discourse.

A metaphysical argument became the cause or pretence of political contests; the subtle∣ties of the Platonic school were used as the badges <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions.</NOTE> of popular factions, and the distance which sepa∣rated their respective tenets was enlarged or mag∣nified by the acrimony of dispute.

The life of Athanasius was consumed in irreconcileable op∣position to the impious <HI>madness</HI> of the Arians <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">The ordinary appellation with which Athanasius and his followers chose to compliment the Arians, was that of <HI>Ariomanites.</HI></NOTE>; but he defended above twenty years the Sabel∣lianism of Marcellus of Ancyra; and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion, he continued to mention, with an ambiguous smile, the venial errors of his respec∣table friend <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Epiphanius, tom. i.

and insulted the repeated variations of their adver∣saries, who were destitute of any certain rule of faith. The sincerity or the cunning of the Arian chiefs, the fear of the laws or of the people, their reverence for Christ, their hatred of Athanasius, all the causes, human and divine, that influence and disturb the counsels of a theological faction, introduced among the sectaries a spirit of discord and inconstancy, which, in the course of a few years, erected eighteen different models of reli∣gion <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">Athanasius, in his epistle concerning the synods of Seleucia and Rimini (tom. i. p. 886—905.), has given an ample list of Arian creeds, which has been enlarged and improved by the labours of the indefatigable Tillemont (Mem.

The Homo∣ousion is rejected, and received, and explained away by successive synods. The partial or total resemblance of the Father and of the Son, is a subject of dispute for these unhappy times. Every year, nay every moon, we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries. We repent of what we have done, we defend those who repent, we anathematise those whom we defended. We condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves, or our own in that of others; and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces, we have been the cause of each other's ruin <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Hilarius ad Constantium, l. ii. c. 4, 5. p. 1227, 1228.

<P>It will not be expected, it would not perhaps <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arian sects.</NOTE> be endured, that I should swell this theological digression, by a minute examination of the eighteen creeds, the authors of which, for the most part, disclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius. It is amusing enough to delineate the form, and to trace the vegetation, of a singular plant; but
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
the tedious detail of leaves without flowers, and of branches without fruit, would soon exhaust the patience, and disappoint the curiosity, of the laborious student. One question which gradually arose from the Arian controversy, may however be noticed, as it served to produce and discri∣minate the three sects, who were united only by their common aversion to the Homoousion of the Nicene synod. 1. If they were asked, whether the Son was <HI>like</HI> unto the Father; the question was resolutely answered in the negative, by the here∣tics who adhered to the principles of Arius, or indeed to those of philosophy; which seem to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his creatures. This obvious consequence was maintained by Aetius <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">In Philostorgius (l. iii. c. 15.) the character and adventures of Aetius appear singular enough, though they are carefully softened by the hand of a friend. The editor Godefroy (p. 153.), who was more attached to his principles than to his author, has collected the odious circumstances which his various adversaries have preserved or invented.</NOTE>, on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist. His restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life. He was successively a slave, or at least a husbandman, a travelling tinker, a gold∣smith, a physician, a schoolmaster, a theologian, and at last the apostle of a new church, which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Euno∣mius <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">According to the judgment of a man who respected both those sectaries, Aetius had been endowed with a stronger understanding, and Eunomius had acquired more art and learning (Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 18.). The confession and apology of Eunomius (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. viii. p. 258—305.) is one of the few heretical pieces which have escaped.</NOTE>. Armed with texts of scripture, and with
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
captious syllogisms from the logic of Aristotle, the subtle Aetius had acquired the fame of an invin∣cible disputant, whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince. Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian bishops, till they were forced to renounce, and even to persecute, a dan∣gerous ally, who, by the accuracy of his reasoning, had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion, and offended the piety of their most devoted fol∣lowers. 2. The omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the <HI>likeness</HI> of the Father and the Son; and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny, that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections, and create a being similar only to himself <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Yet, according to the opinion of Estius and Bull (p. 297.), there is one power, that of creation, which God <HI>cannot</HI> communicate to a creature. Estius, who so accurately defined the limits of Omni∣potence, was a Dutchman by birth, and by trade a scholastic divine. Dupin, Bibliot. Eccles. tom. xvii. p. 45.</NOTE>. These Arians were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders, who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian interest, and who occupied the principal thrones of the East. They detested, perhaps with some affectation, the impiety of Aetius; they professed to believe, either without reserve, or according to the scriptures, that the Son was different from all <HI>other</HI> creatures, and similar only to the Father. But they denied, that
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
he was either of the same, or of a similar substance; sometimes boldly justifying their dissent, and some∣times objecting to the use of the word substance, which seems to imply an adequate, or at least a distinct, notion of the nature of the Deity. 3. The sect which asserted the doctrine of a similar sub∣stance, was the most numerous, at least in the provinces of Asia; and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of Seleucia <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Sabinus (ap. Socrat. l. ii. c. 39.) had copied the acts; Atha∣nasius and Hilary have explained the divisions of this Arian synod; the other circumstances which are relative to it are carefully collected by Baronius and Tillemont.</NOTE>, <HI>their</HI> opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to forty-three bishops. The Greek word, which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance, bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol, that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians. As it frequently happens, that the sounds and cha∣racters which approach the nearest to each other, accidentally represent the most opposite ideas, the observation would be itself ridiculous, if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the Semi-Arians, as they were improperly styled, and that of the Catholics themselves. The bishop of Poitiers, who in his Phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties, endeavours to prove that, by a pious and faithful interpretation <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Fideli et piâ intelligentiâ...De Synod. c. 77. p. 1193. In his short apologetical notes (first published by the Benedictines from a MS. of Chartres) he observes, that he used this cautious expression, qui intelligerem et impiam, p. 1206. See p. 1146. Philostorgius, who saw those objects through a different medium, is inclined to for∣get the difference of the important diphthong. See in particular viii. 17. and Godefroy, p. 352.</NOTE>, the <HI>Homoiousion</HI> may be
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
reduced to a consubstantial sense. Yet he confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect; and, as if darkness were congenial to theological disputes, the Semi-Arians, who advanced to the doors of the church, assailed them with the most unrelenting fury.</P>
<P>The provinces of Egypt and Asia, which cul∣tivated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith of the West∣ern or La∣tin church.</NOTE> the language and manners of the Greeks, had deeply imbibed the venom of the Arian con∣troversy. The familiar study of the Platonic system, a vain and argumentative disposition, a copious and flexible idiom, supplied the clergy and people of the East with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions; and, in the midst of their fierce contentions, they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy, and the submission which is enjoined by religion. The inhabitants of the West were of a less inqui∣sitive spirit; their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects; their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute; and such was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church, that Hilary himself, above thirty years after the first general council, was still a stranger to the Nicene creed <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Testor Deum coeli atque terrae mecum neutrum audissem, semper tamen utrumque sensisse. . . .

<PB N="343" REF="350"/>

But as the western provincials had the good for∣tune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source, they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility; and when the Arian pestilence approached their frontiers, they were supplied with the seasonable pre∣servative of the Homoousion, by the paternal care of the Roman pontiff. Their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Council of Rimini,</NOTE> Rimini, which surpassed in numbers the council <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 360.</NOTE> of Nice, since it was composed of above four hun∣dred bishops of Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum. From the first debates it appeared, that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party, though <HI>they</HI> affected to anathematise the name and memory, of Arius. But this inferiority was com∣pensated by the advantages of skill, of experience,
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
and of discipline; and the minority was conducted by Valens and Ursacius, two bishops of Illyricum, who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils, and who had been trained under the Eusebian banner, in the religious wars of the East. By their arguments and negociations, they embarrassed, they confounded, they at last de∣ceived, the honest simplicity of the Latin bishops; who suffered the palladium of the faith to be ex∣torted from their hands by fraud and importunity, rather than by open violence. The council of Rimini was not allowed to separate, till the mem∣bers had imprudently subscribed a captious creed, in which some expressions, susceptible of an here∣tical sense, were inserted in the room of the Homoousion. It was on this occasion, that, according to Jerom, the world was surprised to find itself Arian <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Ingemuit totus orbis, et Arianum se esse miratus est. Hieronym. adv. Lucifer. tom. i. p. 145.</NOTE>. But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses, than they discovered their mistake, and repented of their weakness. The ignominious capi∣tulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence: and the Homoousian standard, which had been shaken but not overthrown, was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the West <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">The story of the council of Rimini is very elegantly told by Sulpicius Severus (Hist. Sacra, l. ii. p. 419—430. edit. Lugd. Bat. 1647.), and by Jerom, in his dialogue against the Luciferians. The design of the latter is to apologize for the conduct of the Latin bishops, who were deceived, and who repented.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the rise and progress, and such were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the em∣perors in the Arian contro∣versy.</NOTE> the natural revolutions of those theological dis∣putes,
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
which disturbed the peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine and of his sons. But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith, as well as over the lives and fortunes, of their subjects; the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance: and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled, or changed, or modified, in the cabinet of an earthly monarch.</P>
<P>The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indiffe∣rence of Constan∣tine,</NOTE> the provinces of the East, interrupted the triumph of Constantine; but the emperor continued for some time to view, with cool and careless indif∣ference, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians, he addressed to the con∣tending parties, to Alexander and to Arius, a mo∣derating epistle <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">Eusebius, in Vit.

The principles of toleration and religious indifference, contained in this epistle, have given great offence to Baronius, Tillemont, &amp;c. who suppose that the emperor had some evil counsellor, either Satan or Eusebius, at his elbow. See Jortin's Remarks, tom. ii. p. 183.</NOTE>; which may be ascribed, with far greater reason, to the untutored sense of a sol∣dier and statesman, than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors. He attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question, concerning an incomprehensible point of the law, which was foolishly asked by the bishop, and imprudently resolved by the presbyter. He laments that the Christian people, who had the same God, the same religion, and the same wor∣ship, should be divided by such inconsiderable
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
distinctions; and he seriously recommends to the clergy of Alexandria the example of the Greek philosophers; who could maintain their argu∣ments without losing their temper, and assert their freedom without violating their friendship. The indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been, perhaps, the most effectual method of silencing the dispute: if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous; and if Constan∣tine himself, in the midst of faction and fanati∣cism, could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind. But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate, and to awaken the zeal of the prose∣lyte. He was provoked by the insults which had <NOTE PLACE="marg">His zeal.</NOTE> been offered to his statues; he was alarmed by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

But the credit of his favourite Osius, who appears to have presided in the council of Nice, might dispose the emperor in favour of the orthodox party; and a well-timed insinuation, that the same Eusebius of Nicomedia, who now protected the heretic, had lately assisted the tyrant <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">Theodoret has preserved (l. i. c. 20.) an epistle from Constan∣tine to the people of Nicomedia, in which the monarch declares him∣self the public accuser of one of his subjects; he styles Eusebius, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and complains of his hostile behaviour during the civil war.</NOTE>, might exasperate him against their ad∣versaries. The Nicene creed was ratified by Con∣stantine; and his firm declaration, that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod, must prepare themselves for an immediate exile, anni∣hilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition; which from seventeen, was almost instantly reduced to two, protesting bishops.

The exiles were recalled; and Eusebius, who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of Constantine, was restored to the episcopal throne, from which he had been ignominiously degraded. Arius himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man. His faith was approved by the synod of Jerusalem; and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice, by issuing an absolute command, that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of Constantinople. On the same day, which had been fixed for the triumph of Arius, he expired;—and the strange and horrid circum∣stances of his death might excite a suspicion, that

The ecclesiastical government of Constantine can∣not be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness. But the credulous monarch, unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare, might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics, whose sentiments he never per∣fectly understood; and while he protected Arius, and persecuted Athanasius, he still considered the council of Nice as the bulwark of the Christian faith, and the peculiar glory of his own reign <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">The change in the sentiments, or at least in the conduct, of Constantine, may be traced in Eusebius (in Vit.

A secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle; and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master, Valens assured him that the Gallic legions gave way; and insinuated with some presence of mind, that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel.

The guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favour of the unfortunate Gallus; and even the deaths of the Imperial ministers, who had been massacred at Antioch, were imputed to the sug∣gestions of that dangerous sophist. The mind of Constantius, which could neither be mode∣rated by reason, nor fixed by faith, was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss, by his horror of the opposite extreme: he alternately embraced and condemned the senti∣ments, he successively banished and recalled the leaders, of the Arian and Semi-Arian factions <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, l. iv. c. 23.

levity, by the divisions of the Arians, and by the resistance of the catholics; and he resolved, as the last and decisive effort, imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council. The destructive earthquake of Nicomedia, the difficulty of finding a convenient place, and perhaps some secret mo∣tives of policy, produced an alteration in the sum∣mons. The bishops of the East were directed to meet at Seleucia, in Isauria; while those of the West held their deliberations at Rimini, on the coast of the Hadriatic; and, instead of two or three deputies from each province, the whole episcopal body was ordered to march. The Eastern council, after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate, separated without any definitive conclusion. The council of the West was protracted till the seventh month. Taurus, the Praetorian praefect, was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion; and his efforts were supported by a power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory, and a promise of the consulship if he atchieved so difficult an adventure. His <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Edu∣cated in the family of Alexander, he had vigorously opposed the early progress of the Arian heresy: he exercised the important functions of secretary under the aged prelate; and the fathers of the Nicene council beheld with surprise and respect, the rising virtues of the young deacon. In a time of public danger, the dull claims of age and of
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
rank are sometimes superseded; and within five months after his return from Nice, the deacon Athanasius was seated on the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt. He filled that eminent station above <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 326—373.</NOTE> forty-six years, and his long administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of Arianism. Five times was Athanasius expelled from his throne; twenty years he passed as an exile or a fugitive; and almost every province of the Roman empire was successively witness to his merit, and his sufferings in the cause of the Ho∣moousion, which he considered as the sole pleasure and business, as the duty, and as the glory, of his life. Amidst the storms of persecution, the arch∣bishop of Alexandria was patient of labour, jealous of fame, careless of safety; and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism, Atha∣nasius displayed a superiority of character and abilities, which would have qualified him, far better than the degenerate sons of Constantine, for the government of a great monarchy. His learning was much less profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of Caesarea, and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the po∣lished oratory of Gregory or Basil; but whenever the primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct, his unpremeditated style, either of speaking or writing, was clear, forcible, and persuasive. He has always been revered in the orthodox school, as one of the most accurate masters of the Christian theology; and he was supposed to possess two profane sciences, less adapted to the episcopal character; the know∣ledge

<P>But as Athanasius was continually engaged with the prejudices and passions of every order of men from the monk to the emperor, the knowledge of human nature was his first and most important science. He preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting; and never failed to improve those decisive mo∣ments which are irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common eye. The archbishop of Alexandria was capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command, and where he must dextrously insinuate; how long he might contend with power, and when he must withdraw from per∣secution; and while he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and rebellion, he could assume, in the bosom of his own party, the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader.

of his behaviour conciliated the affections both of the clergy and of the people. The Alexandrians were impatient to rise in arms for the defence of an eloquent and liberal pastor. In his distress he always derived support, or at least consolation, from the faithful attachment of his parochial clergy; and the hundred bishops of Egypt adhered, with unshaken zeal, to the cause of Athanasius. In the modest equipage, which pride and policy would affect, he frequently per∣formed the episcopal visitation of his provinces, from the mouth of the Nile to the confines of Aethiopia; familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace, and humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot">See the History of the Fathers of the Desert, published by Ros∣weide: and Tillemont Mem.

Nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies, among men whose edu∣cation and manners were similar to his own, that Athanasius displayed the ascendancy of his genius.

<P>In his youth, the primate of Egypt resisted the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Perse∣cution against Athana∣sius,</NOTE> great Constantine, who had repeatedly signified <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 330.</NOTE>
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
his will, that Arius should be restored to the Ca∣tholic communion <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">At first Constantine threatened in <HI>speaking,</HI> but requested in <HI>writing,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. His letters gradually assumed a menacing tonc; but while he required that the entrance of the church should be open to <HI>all,</HI> he avoided the odious name of Arius. Athanasius, like a skilful politician, has accurately marked these distinctions (tom. i. p. 788), which allowed him some scope for excuse and delay.</NOTE>. The emperor respected, and might forgive, this inflexible resolution; and the faction who considered Athanasius as their most formidable enemy, were constrained to dis∣semble their hatred, and silently to prepare an indirect and distant assault. They scattered rumours and suspicions, represented the arch∣bishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant, and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had been ratified in the Nicene council, with the schismatic followers of Meletius <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">The Meletians in Egypt, like the Donatists in Asrica, were produced by an episcopal quarrel which arose from the persecution. I have not leisure to pursue the obscure controversy, which seems to have been misrepresented by the partiality of Athanasius, and the ig∣norance of Epiphanius. See Mosheim's General History of the Church, vol. i. p. 201.</NOTE>. Athanasius had openly disapproved that ignominious peace, and the emperor was disposed to believe, that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power, to persecute those odious sectaries; that he had sacri∣legiously broken a chalice in one of their churches of Maraeotis: that he had whipped or imprisoned six of their bishops; and that Arsenius, a seventh bishop of the same party, had been murdered, or at least mutilated, by the cruel hand of the pri∣mate <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">The treatment of the six bishops is specified by Sozomen (l. ii. c. 25.); but Athanasius himself, so copious on the subject of Arse∣nius and the chalice, leaves this grave accusation without a reply.</NOTE>.
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
These charges, which affected his ho∣nour and his life, were referred by Constantine to his brother Dalmatius the Censor, who resided at Antioch; the synods of Caesarea and Tyre were successively convened; and the bishops of the East were instructed to judge the cause of Athanasius, before they proceeded to consecrate the new church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem. The primate might be conscious of his innocence; but he was sensible, that the same implacable spi∣rit which had dictated the accusation, would direct the proceeding, and pronounce the sentence. He prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies, despised the summons of the synod of Caesarea; and, after a long and artful delay, submitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor, who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">Athanas. tom. i. p. 788.

Before Athanasius, at the head of fifty Egyptian <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

his numerous faction repeated the names of ho∣micide and tyrant; and their clamours were en∣couraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius; who expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly. The nature of the other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory replies; yet the archbishop was able to prove, that, in the village, where he was accused of breaking a con∣secrated chalice, neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist. The Arians, who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy, attempted, however, to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms: the synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect evidence on the spot; and this measure, which was vigorously opposed by the Egyptian bishops, opened new scenes of vio∣lence and perjury <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">See, in particular, the second Apology of Athanasius (tom. i. p. 763—808.), and his Epistles to the Monks (p. 808—866.).

After the return of the deputies from Alexandria, the majority of the council pronounced the final sentence of degrada∣tion and exile against the primate of Egypt. The decree, expressed in the fiercest language of ma∣lice and revenge, was communicated to the em∣peror and the catholic church; and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect, such as became their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Eusebius in Vit.

<P><PB N="363" REF="370"/>
But the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been countenanced by the submission, or even by the presence, of Athanasius. He re∣solved <NOTE PLACE="marg">His first exile,</NOTE> to make a bold and dangerous experiment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 336.</NOTE> whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of truth; and before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark, which was ready to hoist sail for the Imperial city. The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded; but Athanasius concealed his arrival, watched the moment of Constantine's return from an adjacent villa, and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople. So strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation; and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor; but his resentment was subdued by invo∣luntary respect; and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a bishop, who implored his justice, and awakened his conscience <NOTE N="107" PLACE="foot">Athanas. tom. i. p. 804.

The emperor was satisfied that the peace of Egypt would be secured by the absence of a popular leader; but he refused to fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne; and the sentence, which, after long hesitation, he pronounced, was that of a jealous ostracism, rather than of an ignominious exile. In the re∣mote province of Gaul, but in the hospitable court of Treves, Athanasius passed about twenty-eight months.

He gave audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant, with whom he was afterwards accused of holding a secret correspond∣ence <NOTE N="120" PLACE="foot">Athanasius (tom. i. p. 677, 678.) defends his innocence by pathetic complaints, solemn assertions, and specious arguments.

Gra∣titude and humanity would have disposed the pri∣mate of Egypt to deplore the untimely fate of Constans, and to abhor the guilt of Magnentius; but as he clearly understood that the apprehen∣sions of Constantius were his only safeguard, the
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
servour of his prayers for the success of the righte∣ous cause might perhaps be somewhat abated. The ruin of Athanasius was no longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops, who abused the authority of a credulous monarch. The monarch himself avowed the re∣solution, which he had so long suppressed, of avenging his private injuries <NOTE N="122" PLACE="foot">Athanas. tom. i. p. 861. Theodoret, l. ii. c. 16.

<P>If the emperor had capriciously decreed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Councils of Arles and Milan,</NOTE> death of the most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic, the cruel order would have been <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The cau∣tion, the delay, the difficulty with which he pro∣ceeded in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop, discovered to the world that the privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the Roman govern∣ment. The sentence which was pronounced in the synod of Tyre, and subscribed by a large majority of the eastern bishops, had never been expressly repealed; and as Athanasius had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren, every subsequent act might be considered as irregular, and even cri∣minal. But the memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate of Egypt had derived
<PB N="372" REF="379"/>
from the attachment of the western church, en∣gaged Constantius to suspend the execution of the sentence, till he had obtained the concurrence of the Latin bishops. Two years were consumed in ecclesiastical negociations; and the important cause between the emperor and one of his subjects was solemnly debated, first in the synod of Arles, and afterwards in the great council of Milan <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">The affairs of the council of Milan are so imperfectly and erroneously related by the Greek writers, that we must rejoice in the supply of some letters of Eusebius, extracted by Baronius, from the archives of the church of Vercellae, and of an old life of Dionysius of Milan, published by Bollandus. See Baronius, A. D. 355. and Tillemont, tom. vii. p. 1415.</NOTE>, which consisted of above three hundred bishops. Their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of the Arians, the dexterity of the eunuchs, and the pressing solicitations of a prince, who gratified his revenge at the expence of his dignity; and exposed his own passions, whilst he influenced those of the clergy. Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty, was successfully practised: honours, gifts, and immunities, were offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote <NOTE N="124" PLACE="foot">The honours, presents, feasts, which seduced so many bishops, are mentioned with indignation by those who were too pure or too proud to accept them. <Q>We combat (says Hilary of Poitiers) against Constantius the antichrist; who strokes the belly instead of scourg∣ing the back;</Q> qui non dorsa caedit, sed ventrem palpat.

With a manly spirit, which the sanctity of their character rendered less dangerous, they maintained, in public debate, and in private conference with the emperor, the eternal obligation of religion and justice. They declared, that neither the hope of his favour, nor the fear of his displeasure, should prevail on them to join in the condemnation of an absent, an inno∣cent, a respectable brother <NOTE N="125" PLACE="foot">Something of this opposition is mentioned by Ammianus (xv. 7.), who had a very dark and superficial knowledge of eccle∣siastical history.

They affirmed, with apparent reason, that the illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of Tyre had long since been tacitly abolished by the Imperial edicts, the ho∣nourable re-establishment of the archbishop of Alexandria, and the silence or recantation of his most clamorous adversaries.

They deplored the hard condition of Athanasius, who, after enjoying so many years his seat, his reputa∣tion, and the seeming confidence of his sovereign, was again called upon to confute the most ground∣less

and extravagant accusations. Their language was specious; their conduct was honourable: but in this long and obstinate contest, which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a single bishop, the ecclesiastical factions were prepared to sacrifice truth and justice, to the more interesting object of defending, or removing, the intrepid champion of the Nicene faith. The Arians still thought it prudent to disguise in ambiguous language, their real sentiments and designs: but the orthodox bishops, armed with the favour of the people, and the decrees of a general council, insisted on every occasion, and particularly at Milan, that their adversaries should purge themselves from the suspicion of heresy, before they presumed to arraign the conduct of the great Athanasius <NOTE N="127" PLACE="foot">Sulp. Severus in Hist. Sacra, l. ii. p. 412.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the voice of reason (if reason was indeed on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Condem∣nation of Athana∣sius,</NOTE> the side of Athanasius) was silenced by the cla∣mours of a factious or venal majority; and the councils of Arles and Milan were not dissolved <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 355.</NOTE> till the archbishop of Alexandria had been so∣lemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the Western, as well as of the Eastern, church. The bishops who had opposed, were required to subscribe, the sentence; and to unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of the ad∣verse party. A formulary of consent was trans∣mitted by the messengers of state to the absent bishops: and all those who refused to submit their private opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of Arles and Milan, were
<PB N="375" REF="382"/>
immediately banished by the emperor, who affect∣ed to execute the decrees of the Catholic church. Among those prelates who led the honourable band of confessors and exiles, Liberius of Rome, Osius of Cordova, Paulanus of Treves, Diony∣sius of Milan, Eusebius of Vercellae, Lucifer of Cagliari, and Hilary of Poitiers, may deserve to be particularly distinguished. The eminent station of Liberius, who governed the capital of the em∣pire; the personal merit and long experience of the venerable Osius, who was revered as the fa∣vourite of the great Constantine, and the father of the Nicene faith; placed those prelates at the head of the Latin church: and their example, either of submission or resistance, would probably be imitated by the episcopal crowd. But the re∣peated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to intimidate the bishops of Rome and Cordova, were for some time ineffectual. The Spaniard declared himself ready to suffer under Constan∣tius, as he had suffered threescore years before under his grandfather Maximian. The Roman, in the presence of his sovereign, asserted the in∣nocence of Athanasius, and his own freedom. When he was banished to Beraea in Thrace, he sent back a large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey; and insulted the court of Milan by the haughty remark, that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers and their bishops <NOTE N="128" PLACE="foot">The exile of Liberius is mentioned by Ammianus, xv. 7.

resolution of Liberius and Osius was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and confine∣ment. The Roman pontiff purchased his return by some criminal compliances; and afterwards ex∣piated his guilt by a seasonable repentance. Per∣suasion and violence were employed to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepid bishop of Cor∣dova, whose strength was broken, and whose faculties were perhaps impaired, by the weight of an hundred years; and the insolent triumph of the Arians provoked some of the orthodox party to treat with inhuman severity the character, or rather the memory, of an unfortunate old man, to whose former services Christianity itself was so deeply indebted <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">The life of Osius is collected by Tillemont (tom. vii. p. 524—561.) who in the most extravagant terms first admires, and then reprobates, the bishop of Cordova.

<P>The fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exiles.</NOTE> brighter lustre on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered, with unshaken fidelity, to the cause of Athanasius and religious truth. The ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the benefit of mutual comfort and ad∣vice, separated those illustrious exiles into distant provinces, and carefully selected the most inho∣spitable spots of a great empire <NOTE N="130" PLACE="foot">The confessors of the West were successively banished to the deserts of Arabia or Thebais, the lonely places of Mount Taurus, the wildest parts of Phrygia, which were in the possession of the im∣pious Montanists, &amp;c.

The disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the West were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of Athanasius himself <NOTE N="133" PLACE="foot">Ample materials for the history of this third persecution of Athanasius may be found in his own works. See particularly his very able Apology to Constantius (tom. i. p. 673.), his first Apology for his flight (p. 701.), his prolix Epistle to the Solitaries (p. 808.), and the original Protest of the People of Alexandria against the vio∣lences committed by Syrianus (p. 866.). Sozomen (l. iv. c. 9.) has thrown into the narrative two or three luminous and important circumstances.</NOTE>. Six <NOTE PLACE="marg">Third ex∣pulsion of Athana∣sius from Alexan∣dria,</NOTE> and twenty months had elapsed, during which the Imperial court secretly laboured, by the most insidious arts, to remove him from Alexandria, and to withdraw the allowance which supplied his <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 356.</NOTE> popular liberality. But when the primate of of Egypt, deserted and proscribed by the Latin church, was left destitute of any foreign support, Constantius dispatched two of his secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the order of his banishment. As the justice of the sentence was publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive which could restrain Constantius from giving his messengers the sanction of a writ∣ten mandate, must be imputed to his doubt of the event; and to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the second city, and the most fer∣tile province of the empire, if the people should persist in the resolution of defending, by force of arms, the innocence of their spiritual father. Such extreme caution afforded Athanasius a spe∣cious pretence respectfully to dispute the truth of an order, which he could not reconcile, either with the equity, or with the former declarations,
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
of his gracious master. The civil powers of Egypt found themselves inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his episcopal throne; and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria, by which it was stipulated, that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperor's pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained. By this seeming moderation, the Catholics were deceived into a false and fatal security; while the legions of the Upper Egypt, and of Libya, advanced, by secret orders and hasty marches, to besiege, or rather to surprise, a capital, habituated to sedition, and inflamed by religious zeal <NOTE N="134" PLACE="foot">Athanasius had lately sent for Antony, and some of his chosen Monks. They descended from their mountain, announced to the Alexandrians the sanctity of Athanasius, and were honourably con∣ducted by the archbishop as far as the gates of the city. Athanas. tom. ii. p. 491, 492. See likewise Rufinus, iii. 164. in Vit. Patr. p. 524.</NOTE>. The position of Alexandria, between the sea and the lake Mareotis, facilitated the approach and landing of the troops; who were introduced into the heart of the city, before any effectual measures could be taken, either to shut the gates, or to occupy the important posts of desence. At the hour of midnight, twenty-three days after the signature of the treaty, Syri∣anus duke of Egypt, at the head of five thousand soldiers, armed and prepared for an assault, unex∣pectedly invested the church of St. Theonas, where the archbishop, with a part of his clergy and people, performed their nocturnal devotions. The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the impetu∣osity
<PB N="380" REF="387"/>
of the attack, which was accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and blood∣shed; but, as the bodies of the slain, and the fragments of military weapons, remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the Catholics, the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a successful irruption, rather than as an absolute conquest. The other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages; and, during at least four months, Alexandria was ex∣posed to the insults of a licentious army, stimu∣lated by the ecclesiastics of an hostile faction. Many of the faithful were killed; who may de∣serve the name of martyrs, if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged; bishops and presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy; con∣secrated virgins were stripped naked, scourged, and violated; the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered; and, under the mask of reli∣gious zeal, lust, avarice, and private resentment, were gratified with impunity, and even with ap∣plause. The Pagans of Alexandria, who still formed a numerous and discontented party, were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed. The hopes of some peculiar favours, and the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion, engaged them to promise their support to the destined suc∣cessor of Athanasius, the famous George of Cap∣padocia. The usurper, after receiving the con∣secration of an Arian synod, was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian, who had been appointed Count of Egypt for the exe∣cution
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
of that important design. In the use, as well as in the acquisition, of power, the tyrant George disregarded the laws of religion, of jus∣tice, and of humanity; and the same scenes of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the capital, were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities of Egypt. Encouraged by suc∣cess, Constantius ventured to approve the conduct of his ministers. By a public and passionate epistle, the emperor congratulates the deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant, who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence; expatiates on the virtues and piety of the most reverend George, the elected bishop; and aspires, as the patron and benefactor of the city, to sur∣pass the fame of Alexander himself. But he solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked Athanasius, who, by flying from justice, has confessed his guilt, and escaped the ignominious death which he had so often de∣served <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Athanas. tom. i. p. 694.

<P>Athanasius had indeed escaped from the most <NOTE PLACE="marg">His beha∣viour.</NOTE> imminent dangers; and the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our attention. On the memorable night when the church of St. Theonas was invested by the troops of Syrianus, the archbishop, seated on his throne, expected, with calm and intrepid dignity, the approach of death. While the public devotion was inter∣rupted
<PB N="382" REF="389"/>
by shouts of rage, and cries of terror, he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence, by chanting one of the psalms of David, which celebrates the triumph of the God of Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt. The doors were at length burst open; a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people; the soldiers, with drawn swords, rushed forwards into the sanctuary; and the dread∣ful gleam of their armour was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">These minute circumstances are curious, as they are literally transcribed from the protest, which was publicly presented three days afterwards by the Catholics of Alexandria. See Athanas. tom. i. p. 867.</NOTE>. Athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the Monks and Presbyters, who were attached to his person; and nobly refused to desert his epis∣copal station, till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation. The darkness and tu∣mult of the night favoured the retreat of the archbishop; and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude, though he was thrown to the ground, and left without sense or motion, he still recovered his undaunted courage; and eluded the eager search of the soldiers, who were instructed by their Arian guides, that the head of Athanasius would be the most acceptable present to the emperor. From that moment the primate of Egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies, and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable obscurity <NOTE N="137" PLACE="foot">The Jansenists have often compared Athanasius and Arnauld, and have expatiated with pleasure on the faith and zeal, the merit and exile, of those celebrated doctors.

The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole extent of the Roman world; and the exasperated monarch had endeavoured, by a <NOTE PLACE="marg">His retreat,</NOTE> very pressing epistle to the Christian princes of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Counts, praefects, tribunes, whole armies, were successively employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive; the vigilance of the civil and military powers were excited by the Imperial edicts; liberal rewards were promised to the man who should produce Athanasius, either alive or dead; and the most severe penalties were denounced against those who should dare to protect the public enemy <NOTE N="138" PLACE="foot">Hinc jam toto orbe profugus Athanasius, nec ullus ci tutus ad latendum super-erat locus.

The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachomius received the fugitive primate as their father, admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions, collected every word which dropt from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom; and persuaded themselves, that their prayers, their fasts, and their vigils, were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed,

The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places, on the summit of mountains, or in the islands of the Nile; and the sacred horn or trum∣pet of Tabenne was the well-known signal which assembled several thousand robust and determined Monks, who, for the most part, had been the peasants of the adjacent country. When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force, which it was impossible to resist, they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner; and supported their national character, that tortures could never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to dis∣close <NOTE N="140" PLACE="foot">Et nulla tormentorum vis inveniri adhuc potuit; quae ob∣durato illius tractûs latroni invito elicere potuit, ut nomen proprium dicat.

The archbishop of Alexandria, for whose safety they eagerly devoted their lives, was lost among a uniform and well-disciplined multitude; and on the nearer approach of danger, he was swiftly removed, by their officious hands, from one place of concealment to another, till he reached the formidable deserts, which the gloomy and credulous temper of superstition had peopled with daemons and savage monsters. The retire∣ment of Athanasius, which ended only with the life of Constantius, was spent, for the most part, in the society of the Monks, who faithfully served him as guards, as secretaries, and as messengers;

but the importance of maintaining a more inti∣mate connection with the Catholic party, tempted him, whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated, to emerge from the desert, to introduce himself into Alexandria, and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents. His various adventures might have furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance. He was once secreted in a dry cistern, which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the trea∣chery of a female slave <NOTE N="141" PLACE="foot">Rufin. l. i. c. 18. Sozomen, l. iv. c. 10.

At the hour of midnight, as she related the story many years afterwards, she was surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress, who, advancing with hasty steps, conjured her to afford him the protection which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable roof. The pious maid ac∣cepted and preserved the sacred pledge which was entrusted to her prudence and courage. Without imparting the secret to any one, she instantly con∣ducted Athanasius into her most secret chamber, and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant. As long as the danger continued, she regularly supplied him with books and provisions, washed his feet, ma∣naged

The advantage of personally negociating with his friends, and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies, might justify, in a prudent statesman, so bold and dan∣gerous an enterprise: and Alexandria was con∣nected by trade and navigation with every sea∣port of the Mediterranean.

<P N="1">I. The Roman pontiff, as long as he main∣tained <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome.</NOTE> his station and his principles, was guarded by the warm attachment of a great people; and could reject with scorn the prayers, the menaces, and the oblations of an heretical prince. When the eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius, the well-grounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost precau∣tions in the execution of the sentence. The capital was invested on every side, and the Prae∣fect was commanded to seize the person of the bishop, either by stratagem or by open force. The order was obeyed; and Liberius, with the greatest difficulty, at the hour of midnight, was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the Roman people, before their consternation was turned into rage. As soon as they were informed of his ba∣nishment into Thrace, a general assembly was convened, and the clergy of Rome bound them∣selves, by a public and solemn oath, never to desert their bishop, never to acknowledge the usurper Faelix; who, by the influence of the eu∣nuchs, had been irregularly chosen and conse∣crated within the walls of a profane palace. At the end of two years, their pious obstinacy sub∣sisted entire and unshaken; and when Constan∣tius
<PB N="391" REF="398"/>
visited Rome, he was assailed by the impor∣tunate solicitations of a people, who had preserved, as the last remnant of their ancient freedom, the right of treating their sovereign with familiar in∣solence. The wives of many of the senators and most honourable citizens, after pressing their hus∣bands to intercede in favour of Liberius, were ad∣vised to undertake a commission, which, in their hands, would be less dangerous, and might prove more successful. The emperor received with po∣liteness these female deputies, whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments: he admired their in∣flexible resolution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of the earth; and con∣sented that the two bishops, Liberius and Faelix, should govern in peace their respective congre∣gations. But the ideas of toleration were so re∣pugnant to the practice, and even to the senti∣ments, of those times, that when the answer of Constantius was publicly read in the Circus of Rome, so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule. The eager vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisive moment of a horse-race, was now directed towards a different object; and the Cir∣cus resounded with the shout of thousands, who repeatedly exclaimed, <Q>One God, One Christ, One Bishop.</Q> The zeal of the Roman people in the cause of Liberius, was not confined to words alone; and the dangerous and bloody sedi∣tion which they excited soon after the departure

After some ineffectual resistance, his rival was ex∣pelled from the city by the permission of the em∣peror, and the power of the opposite faction; the adherents of Faelix were inhumanly murdered in the streets, in the public places, in the baths, and even in the churches; and the face of Rome, upon the return of a Christian bishop, renewed the horrid image of the massacres of Marius, and the proscriptions of Sylla <NOTE N="149" PLACE="foot">See, on this ecclesiastical revolution of Rome, Ammianus, xv. 7.

<P N="2">II. Notwithstanding the rapid increase of Christ∣ians under the reign of the Flavian family, Rome, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constan∣tinople.</NOTE> Alexandria, and the other great cities of the em∣pire, still contained a strong and powerful faction of Infidels, who envied the prosperity, and who ridiculed, even on their theatres, the theological disputes of the church.

The capital of the East had never been polluted by the worship of Idols; and the whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions, the virtues, and the passions, which distinguished the Christians of that age from the rest of mankind. After the death of Alexander, the episcopal throne was dis∣puted by Paul and Macedonius. By their zeal

and abilities they both deserved the eminent sta∣tion to which they aspired; and if the moral cha∣racter of Macedonius was less exceptionable, his competitor had the advantage of a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine. His firm attach∣ment to the Nicene creed, which has given Paul a place in the calendar among saints and martyrs, exposed him to the resentment of the Arians. In the space of fourteen years he was five times driven from his throne; to which he was more frequently restored by the violence of the people, than by the permission of the prince; and the power of Ma∣cedonius could be secured only by the death of his rival. The unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount Taurus <NOTE N="150" PLACE="foot">Cucusus was the last stage of his life and sufferings.

Yet he acknowledges, that the here∣tics attributed to disease the death of the bishop of Constantinople.

both sides, in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people. The commission of enforcing a sen∣tence of banishment against Paul, had been en∣trusted to Hermogenes, the master-general of the cavalry; but the execution of it was fatal to him∣self. The Catholics rose in the defence of their bishop; the palace of Hermogenes was consumed; the first military officer of the empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of Constantinople, and, after he expired, his lifeless corpse was ex∣posed to their wanton insults <NOTE N="152" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xiv. 10.) refers to his own account of this tragic event. But we no longer possess that part of his history.</NOTE>. The fare of Hermogenes instructed Philip, the Praetorian prae∣fect, to act with more precaution on a similar oc∣sion. In the most gentle and honourable terms, he required the attendance of Paul in the baths of Zeuxippus, which had a private communication with the palace and the sea. A vessel, which lay ready at the garden-stairs, immediately hoisted fail; and, while the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege, their bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica. They soon beheld, with surprise and indignation, the gates of the palace thrown open, and the usurper Macedonius seated by the side of the praefect on a lofty chariot, which was surrounded by troops of guards with drawn swords. The military proces∣sion advanced towards the cathedral; the Arians and the Catholics eagerly rushed to occupy that important post; and three thousand one hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of

the tumult. Macedonius, who was supported by a regular force, obtained a decisive victory; but his reign was disturbed by clamour and sedition; and the causes which appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute, were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil discord. As the chapel in which the body of the great Con∣stantine had been deposited was in a ruinous con∣dition, the bishop transported those venerable re∣mains into the church of St. Acacius. This pru∣dent and even pious measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party which ad∣hered to the Homoousian doctrine. The factions immediately flew to arms, the consecrated ground was used as their field of battle; and one of the ecclesiastical historians has observed, as a real fact, not as a figure of rhetoric, that the well be∣fore the church overflowed with a stream of blood, which filled the porticoes and the adjacent courts. The writer who should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle, would betray a very im∣perfect knowledge of human nature; yet it must be confessed, that the motive which misled the sincerity of zeal, and the pretence which disguised the licentiousness of passion, suppressed the re∣morse which, in another cause, would have suc∣ceeded to the rage of the Christians of Constan∣tinople <NOTE N="153" PLACE="foot">See Socrates, l. ii. c. 6, 7. 12, 13. 15, 16. 26, 27. 38. and Sozomen, l. iii. 3, 4. 7. 9. l. iv. c. ii. 21. The acts of St. Paul of Constantinople, of which Photius has made an abstract (Phot.

The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constan∣tius, which did not always require the provoca∣tions of guilt and resistance, was justly exasperated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of the Arians.</NOTE> by the tumults of his capital, and the criminal behaviour of a faction, which opposed the autho∣rity and religion of their sovereign. The ordinary punishments of death, exile, and confiscation were inflicted with partial rigour; and the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks, a reader and a sub-deacon, who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes, and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople. By an edict of Constantius against the Catholics, which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodosian code, those who refused to communicate with the Arian bishops, and particularly with Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics, and of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches; and were strictly prohibited from holding their assem∣blies within the walls of the city. The execution of this unjust law, in the provinces of Thrace and Asia Minor, was committed to the zeal of Ma∣cedonius; the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands; and the cruelties exercised by this Semi-Arian tyrant in the support of the <HI>Homoiousion,</HI> exceeded the commission, and disgraced the reign, of Constantius. The sacra∣ments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims, who denied the vocation, and abhorred the principles, of Macedonius. The rites of baptism were conferred on women and chil∣dren, who, for that purpose, had been torn from
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
the arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the communicants were held open, by a wooden engine, while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot egg-shells, or in∣humanly compressed between sharp and heavy boards <NOTE N="154" PLACE="foot">Socrates, l. ii. c. 27. 38.

The successor of Constantius has express∣ed, in a concise but lively manner, some of the theological calamities which afflicted the empire, and more especially the East, in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions, and of those of his eunuchs. <Q>Many were imprisoned, and persecuted, and driven into exile.

The pea∣sants who inhabited the villages of Numidia and Mauritania, were a ferocious race, who had been imperfectly reduced under the authority of the Roman laws; who were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith; but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their Donatist teachers. They indignantly supported the exile of their bishops, the demolition of their churches, and the interruption of their secret assemblies. The violence of the officers of justice, who were usually sustained by a military guard, was sometimes repelled with equal vio∣lence; and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics, which had been shed in the quarrel, inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of re∣venging the death of these holy martyrs. By

their own cruelty and rashness, the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate; and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion. Driven from their native villages, the Donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the Getulian desert; and readily exchanged the habits of labour for a life of idleness and rapine, which was consecrated by the name of religion, and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect. <Q>The leaders of the Circumcellions assumed the assumed the title of captains of the saints; their principal weapon, as they were indifferently pro∣vided with swords and spears, was a huge and weighty club, which they termed an <HI>Israelite;</HI> and the well-known sound of "Praise be to God," which they used as their cry of war, diffused con∣sternation over the unarmed provinces of Africa.</Q> At first their depredations were coloured by the plea of necessity; but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence, indulged without controul their intemperance and avarice, burnt the villages which they had pillaged, and reigned the licen∣tious tyrants of the open country. The occupa∣tions of husbandry, and the administration of justice, were interrupted; and as the Circumcel∣lions pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind, and to reform the abuses of civil society, they opened a secure asylum for the slaves and debtors, who flocked in crowds to their holy standard. When they were not resisted, they usually contented themselves with plunder, but the slightest opposition provoked them to acts of
<PB N="401" REF="408"/>
violence and murder; and some Catholic priests, who had imprudently signalized their zeal, were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity. The spirit of the Circumcel∣lions was not always exerted against their defence∣less enemies; they engaged, and sometimes de∣feated, the troops of the province; and in the bloody action of Bagai, they attacked in the open field, but with unsuccessful valour, an advanced guard of the Imperial cavalry. The Donatists who were taken in arms, received, and they soon deserved, the same treatment which might have been shewn to the wild beasts of the desert. The captives died, without a murmur, either by the sword, the axe, or the fire; and the measures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion, which aggravated the horrors of rebellion, and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness. In the beginning of the present century, the example of the Circumcellions has been renewed in the per∣secution, the boldness, the crimes, and the en∣thusiasm of the Camisards; and if the fanatics of Languedoc surpassed those of Numidia, by their military atchievements, the Africans maintained their fierce independence with more resolution and perseverance <NOTE N="159" PLACE="foot">The Histoire des Camisards, in 3 vol. 12mo.

and which, if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be paral∣leled in any country, or in any age. Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of little moment by what means, or by what hands, they perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting them∣selves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope of eternal happiness <NOTE N="160" PLACE="foot">The Donatist suicides alleged in their justification the example of Razias, which is related in the 14th chapter of the second book of the Maccabees.</NOTE>. Sometimes they rudely disturbed the festivals, and profaned the temples of paganism, with the design of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the insulted honour of their gods. They sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice, and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their im∣mediate execution. They frequently stopped tra∣vellers on the public highways, and obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom, by the pro∣mise of a reward, if they consented, and by the threat of instant death, if they refused to grant so very singular a favour. When they were disap∣pointed of every other resource, they announced the day on which, in the presence of their friends and brethren, they should cast themselves head∣long from some lofty rock; and many precipices were shewn, which had acquired fame by the number of religious suicides. In the actions of these desperate enthusiasts, who were admired by one party as the martyrs of God, and abhorred by

<P>The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of <NOTE PLACE="marg">and his sons.</NOTE> their father, with more zeal, and with less dis∣cretion. The pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied <NOTE N="168" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxii. 4.) speaks of some court eunuchs who were spoliis templorum pasti. Libanius says (Orat. pro Templ. p. 23.), that the emperor often gave away a temple, like a dog, or a horse, or a slave, or a gold cup; but the devout philosopher takes care to observe, that these sacrilegious favourites very seldom prospered.</NOTE>; every indulgence was shewn to the illegal behaviour of the Chris∣tians; every doubt was explained to the disad∣vantage of paganism; and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as one of the auspicious events of the reign of Constans and Constan∣tius <NOTE N="169" PLACE="foot">See Gothofred. Cod. Theodos. tom. vi. p. 262. Liban. Orat. Parental. c. x. in Fabric. Bibl. Graec. tom. vii. p. 235.</NOTE>. The name of Constantius is prefixed to a concise law, which might have superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions. <Q>It is our pleasure, that in all places, and in all cities, the temples be immediately shut, and carefully guarded, that none may have the power of offending. It is likewise our pleasure, that all
<PB N="408" REF="415"/>
our subjects should abstain from sacrifices. If any one should be guilty of such an act, let him feel the sword of vengeance; and after his execution, let his property be confiscated to the public use. We denounce the same penalties against the governors of the pro∣vinces, if they neglect to punish the crimi∣nals <NOTE N="170" PLACE="foot">Placuit omnibus locis atque urbibus universis claudi protinus templa, et accessu vetitis omnibus licentiam delinquendi perditis ab∣negari. Volumus etiam cunctos a sacrificiis abstinere. Quod siquis aliquid forte hujusmodi perpetraverit, gladio sternatur: facultates etiam perempti fisco decernimus vindicari: et similiter adfligi rectores provinciarum si facinora vindicare neglexerint. Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. x. leg. 4. Chronology has discovered some contradiction in the date of this extravagant law; the only one, perhaps, by which the negligence of magistrates is punished by death and confiscation. M. de la Bastie (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xv. p. 98.) conjectures, with a shew of reason, that this was no more than the minutes of a law, the heads of an intended bill, which were found in Scriniis Memoriae, among the papers of Constantius, and afterwards inserted, a worthy model, in the Theodosian Code.</NOTE>.</Q> But there is the strongest reason to believe, that this formidable edict was either composed without being published, or was pub∣lished without being executed. The evidence of facts, and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble, continue to prove the public exercise of the pagan worship during the whole reign of the sons of Constantine. In the East, as well as in the West, in cities, as well as in the country, a great number of temples were respected, or at least were spared; and the devout multi∣tude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices, of festi∣vals, and of processions, by the permission, or by the connivance, of the civil government. About four years after the supposed date of his
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
bloody edict, Constantius visited the temples of Rome; and the decency of his behaviour is re∣commended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes. <Q>That emperor, says Symmachus, suffered the privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate; he bestowed the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome, granted the customary allowance to defray the expences of the pub∣lic rites and sacrifices: and, though he had embraced a different religion, he never at∣tempted to deprive the empire of the sacred worship of antiquity <NOTE N="171" PLACE="foot">Symmach. Epistol. x. 54.</NOTE>.</Q> The senate still pre∣sumed to consecrate, by solemn decrees, the <HI>divine</HI> memory of their sovereigns; and Constan∣tine himself was associated, after his death, to those gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life. The title, the ensigns, the pre∣rogatives of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, which had been instituted by Numa, and assumed by Augustus, were accepted, without hesitation, by seven Christ∣ian emperors; who were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted, than over that which they pro∣fessed <NOTE N="172" PLACE="foot">The fourth Dissertation of M. de la Bastie, sur le Souverain Pontificat des Empereurs Romains (in the Mem. de l'Acad. tom. xv. p. 75—144), is a very learned and judicious performance, which ex∣plains the state, and proves the toleration, of paganism from Constan∣tine to Gratian. The assertion of Zosimus, that Gratian was the first who refused the pontifical robe, is confirmed beyond a doubt: and the murmurs of bigotry, on that subject, are almost silenced.</NOTE>.</P>

The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of <HI>paganism</HI> <NOTE N="173" PLACE="foot">As I have freely anticipated the use of <HI>pagans</HI> and paganism, I shall now trace the singular revolutions of those celebrated words. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the Doric dialect, so familiar to the Italians, signifies a fountain; and the rural neighbourhood which frequented the same fountain, derived the common appellation of <HI>pagus</HI> and <HI>pagans</HI> (Eestus sub voce, and Servius ad Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382.). 2. By an easy extension of the word, <HI>pagan</HI> and rural became almost synonymous (Plin. Hist. Natur. xxviii. 5.); and the meaner rustics acquired that name, which has been corrupted into <HI>peasants</HI> in the modern languages of Europe. 3. The amazing increase of the military order intro∣duced the necessity of a correlative term (Hume's Essays, vol. i. p. 555.); and all the <HI>people</HI> who were not enlisted in the service of the prince were branded with the contemptuous epithet of pagans (Tacit. Hist. iii. 24. 43. 77. Juvenal. Satir. xvi. Tertullian de Pallio, c. 4.). 4. The Christians were the soldiers of Christ; their adversaries, who refused his <HI>sacrament,</HI> or military oath of baptism, might deserve the metaphorical name of pagans; and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian (A. D. 365.) into Imperial laws (Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18.) and theological writings. 5. Christianity gradually filled the cities of the empire: the old religion, in the time of Prudentius (advers. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Orosius (in Praefat. Hist.), retired and languished in obscure villages; and the word <HI>pagans,</HI> with its new sig∣nification, reverted to its primitive origin. 6. Since the worship of Jupiter and his family has expired, the vacant title of pagans has been successively applied to all the idolaters and polytheists of the old and new world. 7. The Latin Christians bestowed it, without scruple, on their mortal enemies the Mahometans; and the purest <HI>unitarians</HI> were branded with the unjust reproach of idolatry and pa∣ganism. See Gerard Vossius Etymologicon Linguae Latinae, in his works, tom. i. p. 420. Godefroy's Commentary on the Theodosian Code, tom. vi. p. 250. and Ducange, mediae &amp; infimae Latinitat. Glossar.</NOTE>; and the holy war against the in∣fidels was less vigorously prosecuted by princes and bishops, who were more immediately alarmed by the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion. The extirpation of <HI>idolatry</HI> <NOTE N="174" PLACE="foot">In the pure language of Ionia and Athens, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were ancient and familiar words. The former expressed a likeness, an apparition (Homer. Odyss. xi. 601.) a representation, an <HI>image,</HI> created either by fancy or art. The latter denoted any sort of <HI>service</HI> or slavery. The Jews of Egypt, who translated the Hebrew scrip∣tures, restrained the use of these words (Exod. xx. 4, 5.) to the re∣ligious worship of an image. The peculiar idiom of the Hellenists, or Grecian Jews, has been adopted by the sacred and ecclesiastical writers; and the reproach of <HI>idolatry</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) has stigmatized that visible and abject mode of superstition, which some sects of Christianity should not hastily impute to the polytheists of Greece and Rome.</NOTE> might have been
<PB N="411" REF="418"/>
justified by the established principles of intole∣rance: but the hostile sects, which alternately reigned in the Imperial court, were mutually ap∣prehensive of alienating, and perhaps exasperat∣ing, the minds of a powerful, though declining faction. Every motive of authority and fashion, of interest and reason, now militated on the side of Christianity; but two or three generations elapsed, before their victorious influence was universally felt. The religion which had so long and so lately been established in the Roman em∣pire was still revered by a numerous people, less attached indeed to speculative opinion, than to ancient custom. The honours of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on all the sub∣jects of Constantine and Constantius; and a con∣siderable portion of knowledge and wealth and valour was still engaged in the service of poly∣theism. The superstition of the senator and of the peasant, of the poet and the philosopher, was derived from very different causes, but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods. Their zeal was insensibly provoked by the insult∣ing triumph of a proscribed sect; and their hopes
<PB N="412" REF="419"/>
were revived by the well-grounded confidence, that the presumptive heir of the empire, a young and valiant hero, who had delivered Gaul from the arms of the Barbarians, had secretly em∣braced the religion of his ancestors.</P>
