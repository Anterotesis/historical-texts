<LG>
<L>ENOUGH of <HI>Actors</HI>—let them play the play'r,</L>
<L>And, free from censure, fret, sweat, strut, and stare.</L>
<L>GARRICK abroad, what motives can engage</L>
<L>To waste one couplet on a barren stage?</L>
<L>Ungrateful GARRICK! when these <HI>tasty</HI> days,</L>
<L>In justice to themselves, allow'd thee praise,</L>
<L>When, at thy bidding, Sense, for twenty years,</L>
<L>Indulg'd in laughter, or dissolv'd in tears,</L>
<L>When, in return for labour, time, and health,</L>
<L>The Town had giv'n some little share of wealth,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Could'st Thou repine at being still a slave?</L>
<L>Dar'st Thou presume t' enjoy that wealth She gave?</L>
<L>Could'st Thou repine at laws ordain'd by Those,</L>
<L>Whom nothing but thy merit made thy foes,</L>
<L>Whom, too refin'd for honesty and trade,</L>
<L>By need made tradesmen, Pride had Bankrupts made,</L>
<L>Whom Fear made Drunkards, and, by modern rules,</L>
<L>Whom Drink made Wits, tho' Nature made them Fools?</L>
<L>With Such, beyond all pardon is thy crime,</L>
<L>In such a manner, and at such a time,</L>
<L>To quit the stage, but Men of real Sense</L>
<L>Who neither lightly give, nor take offence,</L>
<L>Shall own Thee clear, or pass an act of grace</L>
<L>Since Thou hast left a POWELL in thy place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Authors</HI>—why, when Scribblers fail,</L>
<L>Must other Scribblers spread the hateful tale,</L>
<L>Why must they pity, why contempt express,</L>
<L>And why insult a Brother in distress?</L>
<L>Let Those, who boast th' uncommon gift of brains,</L>
<L>The Laurel pluck, and wear it for their pains,</L>
<L>Fresh on their brows for ages let It bloom,</L>
<L>And, ages past, still flourish round their tomb.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Let Those, who without Genius write, and write,</L>
<L>Versemen or Prosemen, all in Nature's spite,</L>
<L>The Pen laid down, their course of Folly run,</L>
<L>In peace, unread, unmention'd, be undone.</L>
<L>Why should I tell to cross the will of fate,</L>
<L>That FRANCIS once endeavour'd to translate?</L>
<L>Why, sweet Oblivion winding round his head,</L>
<L>Should I recall poor MURPHY from the dead?</L>
<L>Why may not LANGHORNE, simple in his lay,</L>
<L><HI>Effusion</HI> on <HI>Effusion</HI> pour away,</L>
<L>With <HI>Friendship,</HI> and with <HI>Fancy</HI> trifle here,</L>
<L>Or sleep in <HI>Pastoral</HI> at BELVIDERE?</L>
<L>Sleep let them all, with DULLNESS on her throne,</L>
<L>Secure from any malice, but their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Critics</HI>—let them, if they please,</L>
<L>Fond of new pomp, each month pass new decrees;</L>
<L>Wide and extensive be their infant State,</L>
<L>Their Subjects many, and those Subjects great,</L>
<L>Whilst all their mandates as sound Law succeed,</L>
<L>With Fools who write, and greater fools who read.</L>
<L>What, tho' they lay the realms of Genius waste,</L>
<L>Fetter the Fancy, and debauch the Taste;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Tho' They, like Doctors, to approve their skill,</L>
<L>Consult not how to cure, but how to kill;</L>
<L>Tho' by whim, envy, or resentment led,</L>
<L>They damn those authors whom they never read,</L>
<L>Tho', other rules unknown, one rule they hold,</L>
<L>To deal out so much praise for to much gold;</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Scot</HI> with <HI>Scot,</HI> in damned close intrigues,</L>
<L>Against the Commonwealth of Letters leagues;</L>
<L>Uncensur'd let them Pilot at the helm,</L>
<L>And, rule in Letters, as they rul'd the realm.</L>
<L>Ours be the curse, the mean, tame Coward's curse,</L>
<L>(Nor could Ingenious Malice make a worse,</L>
<L>To do our Sense, and Honour deep despite)</L>
<L>To credit what They say, read what They write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Scotland</HI>—let her rest in peace,</L>
<L>The cause remov'd, effects of course should cease.</L>
<L>Why should I tell, how <HI>Tweed,</HI> too mighty grown,</L>
<L>And proudly swell'd with waters not his own,</L>
<L>Burst o'er his banks, and, by destruction led,</L>
<L>O'er our fair ENGLAND desolation spread,</L>
<L>Whilst riding on his waves, Ambition plum'd</L>
<L>In tenfold pride the port of BUTE assum'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Now that the River God, convinc'd, tho' late,</L>
<L>And yielding, tho' reluctantly, to fate,</L>
<L>Holds his fair course, and with more humble tides,</L>
<L>In tribute to the sea, as usual, glides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>States,</HI> and such like trifling things;</L>
<L>Enough of Kinglings, and enough of Kings;</L>
<L>Henceforth, secure, let ambush'd Statesmen lie,</L>
<L>Spread the Court web, and catch the Patriot fly;</L>
<L>Henceforth, unwhipt of Justice, uncontroul'd</L>
<L>By fear or shame, let Vice, secure and bold,</L>
<L>Lord it with all her sons, whilst Virtue's groan</L>
<L>Meets with compassion only from the Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Patriots</HI>—all I ask of man</L>
<L>Is only to be honest as he can.</L>
<L>Some have deceiv'd, and some may still deceive;</L>
<L>'Tis the Fool's curse at random to believe.</L>
<L>Would those, who, by Opinion plac'd on high,</L>
<L>Stand fair and perfect in their Country's eye,</L>
<L>Maintain that honour, let me in their ear</L>
<L>Hint this essential doctrine—<HI>Persevere.</HI></L>
<L>Should They (which Heav'n forbid) to win the grace</L>
<L>Of some proud Courtier, or to gain a place,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Their King and Country Sell, with endless shame</L>
<L>Th' avenging Muse shall mark each trait'rous name;</L>
<L>But if, to Honour true, they scorn to bend,</L>
<L>And, proudly honest, hold out to the end,</L>
<L>Their grateful Country shall their fame record,</L>
<L>And I Myself descend to praise a Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Wilkes</HI>—with good and honest men</L>
<L>His actions speak much stronger than my pen,</L>
<L>And future ages shall his name adore,</L>
<L>When he can act, and I can write no more.</L>
<L>ENGLAND may prove ungrateful, and unjust,</L>
<L>But fost'ring FRANCE shall ne'er betray her trust;</L>
<L>'Tis a brave debt which Gods on men impose,</L>
<L>To pay with praise the merit e'en of foes.</L>
<L>When the great Warriour of Amilcar's race</L>
<L>Made ROME's wide Empire tremble to her base,</L>
<L>To prove her Virtue, tho' it gall'd her pride,</L>
<L>ROME gave that fame which CARTHAGE had denied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Self</HI>—that darling, luscious theme,</L>
<L>O'er which Philosophers in raptures dream;</L>
<L>On which with seeming disregard they write,</L>
<L>Then prizing most, when most they seem to slight;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Vain proof of Folly tinctur'd strong with pride!</L>
<L>What Man can from himself himself divide?</L>
<L>For Me (nor dare I lie) my leading aim,</L>
<L>(Conscience first satisfied) is love of Fame,</L>
<L>Some little Fame deriv'd from some brave few,</L>
<L>Who, prizing Honour, prize her Vot'ries too.</L>
<L>Let All (nor shall resentment flush my cheek)</L>
<L>Who know me well, what they know, freely speak,</L>
<L>So Those (the greatest curse I meet below)</L>
<L>Who know me not, may not pretend to know.</L>
<L>Let none of Those, whom bless'd with parts above</L>
<L>My feeble Genius, still I dare to love,</L>
<L>Doing more mischief than a thousand foes,</L>
<L><HI>Posthumous</HI> nonsense to the world expose,</L>
<L>And call it mine, for mine tho' never known,</L>
<L>Or which, if mine, I living blush'd to own.</L>
<L><HI>Know all the World,</HI> no greedy heir shall find,</L>
<L>Die when I will, one couplet left behind.</L>
<L>Let none of Those, whom I despise tho' great,</L>
<L>Pretending Friendship to give malice weight,</L>
<L>Publish my life; let no false, sneaking peer</L>
<L>(Some such there are) to win the public ear,</L>
<L>Hand me to shame with some vile anecdote,</L>
<L>Nor soul-gall'd Bishop damn me with a note.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Let one poor sprig of Bay around my head</L>
<L>Bloom whilst I live, and point me out when dead;</L>
<L>Let It (may Heav'n indulgent grant that pray'r)</L>
<L>Be planted on my grave, nor wither there;</L>
<L>And when, on travel bound, some riming guest</L>
<L>Roams thro' the Church-yard, whilst his Dinner's dress'd,</L>
<L>Let It hold up this Comment to his eyes;</L>
<L>Life to the last enjoy'd, <HI>here</HI> Churchill lies;</L>
<L>Whilst (O, what joy that pleasing flatt'ry gives)</L>
<L>Reading my Works, he cries—<HI>here</HI> Churchill lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enough of <HI>Satire</HI>—in less harden'd times</L>
<L>Great was her force, and mighty were her rimes.</L>
<L>I've read of Men, beyond Man's daring brave,</L>
<L>Who yet have trembled at the strokes she gave,</L>
<L>Whose souls have felt more terrible alarms</L>
<L>From her one line, than from a world in arms.</L>
<L>When, in her faithful and immortal page,</L>
<L>They saw transmitted down from age to age</L>
<L>Recorded Villains, and each spotted name</L>
<L>Branded with marks of everlasting shame,</L>
<L>Succeeding Villains sought her as a friend,</L>
<L>And, if not really mended, feign'd to mend.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>But in an age, when actions are allow'd</L>
<L>Which strike all Honour dead, and crimes avow'd,</L>
<L>Too terrible to suffer the report,</L>
<L>Avow'd and prais'd by men who stain a Court;</L>
<L>Propp'd by the arm of Pow'r, when Vice, high-born,</L>
<L>High-bred, high-station'd, holds rebuke in scorn,</L>
<L>When She is lost to ev'ry thought of fame,</L>
<L>And, to all Virtue dead, is dead to shame,</L>
<L>When Prudence a much easier task must hold</L>
<L>To make a new World, than reform the old,</L>
<L>SATIRE throws by her arrows on the ground,</L>
<L>And, if She cannot cure, She will not wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, PANEGYRICK—tho' the MUSE disdains,</L>
<L>Founded on Truth, to prostitute her strains</L>
<L>At the base instance of those men, who hold</L>
<L>No argument but pow'r, no God but Gold,</L>
<L>Yet, mindful that from heav'n She drew her birth,</L>
<L>She scorns the narrow maxims of this earth,</L>
<L>Virtuous herself, brings Virtue forth to view,</L>
<L>And loves to praise, where praise is justly due.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come PANEGYRICK—in a former hour,</L>
<L>My soul with pleasure yielding to thy pow'r,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Thy shrine I sought, I pray'd—but wanton air,</L>
<L>Before it reach'd thy ears, dispers'd my pray'r;</L>
<L>E'en at thy altars whilst I took my stand,</L>
<L>The pen of Truth and Honour in my hand,</L>
<L>Fate, meditating wrath 'gainst me and mine,</L>
<L>Chid my fond zeal, and thwarted my design,</L>
<L>Whilst, HAYTER brought too quickly to his end,</L>
<L>I lost a Subject, and Mankind a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come PANEGYRICK—bending at thy throne,</L>
<L>Thee and thy Pow'r my soul is proud to own,</L>
<L>Be Thou my kind Protector, Thou my Guide,</L>
<L>And lead me safe thro' passes yet untry'd.</L>
<L>Broad is the road, nor difficult to find,</L>
<L>Which to the house of <HI>Satire</HI> leads mankind;</L>
<L>Narrow, and unfrequented are the ways,</L>
<L>Scarce found out in an age, which lead to Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' no theme I chuse of vulgar note,</L>
<L>Nor wish to write, as Brother Bards have wrote,</L>
<L>So mild, so meek in praising, that they seem</L>
<L>Afraid to wake their Patrons from a dream,</L>
<L>What tho' a theme I chuse, which might demand</L>
<L>The nicest touches of a Master's hand,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>Yet, if the inward workings of my soul</L>
<L>Deceive me not, I shall attain the goal,</L>
<L>And Envy shall behold, in triumph rais'd,</L>
<L>The Poet praising, and the Patron prais'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Patron shall I chuse? shall public voice,</L>
<L>Or private knowledge influence my choice?</L>
<L>Shall I prefer the grand retreat of STOWE,</L>
<L>Or, seeking Patriots, to friend WILDMAN's go?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To WILDMAN's, cried DISCRETION (who had heard</L>
<L>Close-standing at my elbow, ev'ry word)</L>
<L>To WILDMAN's! art Thou mad? can'st Thou be sure</L>
<L>One moment there to have thy head secure?</L>
<L>Are they not All (let observation tell)</L>
<L>All mark'd in Characters as black as Hell,</L>
<L>In <HI>Doomsday</HI> book by Ministers set down,</L>
<L>Who stile their pride the honour of the crown?</L>
<L>Make no reply—let Reason stand aloof—</L>
<L>Presumptions here must pass as solemn proof.</L>
<L>That settled Faith, that Love which ever springs</L>
<L>In the best Subjects, for the best of Kings,</L>
<L>Must not be measur'd now, by what Men think,</L>
<L>Or say, or do—by what They eat, and drink,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>Where, and with whom, that Question's to be try'd,</L>
<L>And Statesmen are the Judges to decide;</L>
<L>No Juries call'd, or, if call'd, kept in awe,</L>
<L>They, facts confest, in themselves vest the law.</L>
<L>Each dish at WILDMAN's of sedition smacks;</L>
<L>Blasphemy may be Gospel at ALMACK's.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Peace, good DISCRETION, peace—thy fears are vain;</L>
<L>Ne'er will I herd with WILDMAN's factious train,</L>
<L>Never the vengeance of the great incur,</L>
<L>Nor, without might, against the mighty stir.</L>
<L>If, from long proof, my temper you distrust,</L>
<L>Weigh my profession, to my gown be just;</L>
<L>Dost Thou one Parson know, so void of grace</L>
<L>To pay his court to Patrons out of place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If still you doubt (tho' scarce a doubt remains)</L>
<L>Search thro' my alter'd heart, and try my reins;</L>
<L>There, searching, find, nor deem me now in sport,</L>
<L>A Convert made by SANDWICH to the Court:</L>
<L>Let Mad-men follow error to the end,</L>
<L>I, of mistakes convinc'd, and proud to mend,</L>
<L>Strive to act better, being better taught,</L>
<L>Nor blush to own that change, which Reason wrought▪</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>For such a change as this, must Justice speak;</L>
<L>My heart was honest, but my head was weak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bigot to no one Man, or set of Men,</L>
<L>Without one selfish view, I drew my pen;</L>
<L>My Country ask'd, or seem'd to ask my aid,</L>
<L>Obedient to that call, I left off trade;</L>
<L>A side I chose, and on that side was strong,</L>
<L>'Till time hath fairly prov'd me in the wrong;</L>
<L>Convinc'd, I change (can any Man do more,</L>
<L>And have not greater Patriots chang'd before)</L>
<L>Chang'd, I at once (can any man do less)</L>
<L>Without a single blush, that change confess,</L>
<L>Confess it with a manly kind of Pride,</L>
<L>And quit the losing for the winning side,</L>
<L>Granting, whilst virtuous SANDWICH holds the rein,</L>
<L>What BUTE for ages might have sought in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Hail</HI> SANDWICH,—nor shall WILKES resentment shew</L>
<L>Hearing the praises of so brave a foe—</L>
<L><HI>Hail,</HI> SANDWICH,—nor, thro' pride, shalt Thou refuse</L>
<L>The grateful tribute of so mean a Muse—</L>
<L>SANDWICH, <HI>All Hail</HI>—when BUTE with foreign hand,</L>
<L>Grown wanton with ambition, scourg'd the land,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>When <HI>Scots,</HI> or slaves to <HI>Scotsmen</HI> steer'd the helm,</L>
<L>When Peace, inglorious Peace, disgrac'd the realm,</L>
<L>Distrust, and gen'ral discontent prevail'd;</L>
<L>But when (he best knows why) his spirits fail'd,</L>
<L>When, with a sudden panic struck, he fled,</L>
<L>Sneak'd out of pow'r, and hid his recreant head;</L>
<L>When, like a MARS (fear order'd to retreat)</L>
<L>We saw Thee nimbly vault into his seat,</L>
<L>Into the seat of pow'r, atone bold leap,</L>
<L>A perfect Connoisseur in Statemanship;</L>
<L>When, like another MACHIAVEL, we saw</L>
<L>Thy fingers twisting, and untwisting law,</L>
<L>Straining, where godlike Reason bade, and where</L>
<L>She warranted thy Mercy, pleas'd to spare,</L>
<L>Saw Thee resolv'd, and fix'd (come what, come might)</L>
<L>To do thy God, thy King, thy Country right;</L>
<L>All things were chang'd, suspence remain'd no more,</L>
<L>Certainty reign'd where doubt had reign'd before.</L>
<L>All felt thy virtues, and all knew their use,</L>
<L>What Virtues such as thine must needs produce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Foes (for Honour ever meets with foes)</L>
<L>Too mean to praise, too fearful to oppose,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>In sullen silence sit; thy Friends (some Few,</L>
<L>Who, friends to Thee, are Friends to Honour too)</L>
<L>Plaud thy brave bearing, and the Common-weal</L>
<L>Expects her safety from thy stubborn zeal.</L>
<L>A place amongst the rest the Muses claim,</L>
<L>And bring this free-will off'ring to thy fame,</L>
<L>To prove their virtue, make thy virtues known,</L>
<L>And, holding up thy fame, secure their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From his youth upwards to the present day,</L>
<L>When Vices more than years have mark'd him grey,</L>
<L>When riotous excess with wasteful hand</L>
<L>Shakes life's frail glass, and hastes each ebbing sand,</L>
<L>Unmindful from what stock he drew his birth,</L>
<L>Untainted with one deed of real worth,</L>
<L>LOTHARIO, holding Honour at no price,</L>
<L>Folly to Folly added, Vice to Vice,</L>
<L>Wrought sin with greediness, and sought for shame</L>
<L>With greater zeal than good men seek for fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where (Reason left without the least defence)</L>
<L>Laughter was Mirth, Obscenity was Sense,</L>
<L>Where Impudence made Decency submit,</L>
<L>Where Noise was Humour, and where Whim was Wit,</L>

<LG>
<L>To whip a Top, to knuckle down at Taw,</L>
<L>To swing upon a gate, to ride a straw,</L>
<L>To play at Push-Pin with dull brother Peers,</L>
<L>To belch out Catches in a Porter's ears,</L>
<L>To reign the monarch of a midnight cell,</L>
<L>To be the gaping Chairman's Oracle,</L>
<L>Whilst, in most blessed union, rogue and whore</L>

<L>Whilst <HI>grey</HI> Authority, who slumbers there</L>
<L>In robes of Watchman's fur, gives up his chair,</L>
<L>With midnight howl to bay th' affrighted Moon,</L>
<L>To walk with torches thro' the streets at noon,</L>
<L>To force plain nature from her usual way,</L>
<L>Each night a vigil, and a blank each day,</L>
<L>To match for speed one Feather 'gainst another,</L>
<L>To make one leg run races with his brother,</L>
<L>'Gainst all the rest to take the northern wind,</L>

<L>Nor in such limits rests his soul confin'd;</L>
<L>Folly may share, but can't engross his mind;</L>
<L>Vice, bold, substantial Vice, puts in her claim,</L>

<L>Is the soft Nature of some easy Maid</L>
<L>Fond, easy, full of faith, to be betray'd,</L>
<L>Must She, to Virtue lost, be lost to fame,</L>
<L>And He, who wrought her guilt, declare her shame?</L>
<L>Is some brave Friend, who, men but little known,</L>
<L>Deems ev'ry heart as honest as his own,</L>
<L>And, free himself, in others fears no guile,</L>
<L>To be ensnar'd, and ruin'd with a smile?</L>
<L>Is Law to be perverted from her course?</L>
<L>Is abject fraud to league with brutal force?</L>
<L>Is Freedom to be crush'd, and ev'ry son,</L>
<L>Who dares maintain her cause, to be undone?</L>
<L>Is base Corruption, creeping thro' the land,</L>
<L>To plan, and work her ruin, underhand,</L>
<L>With regular approaches, sure tho' slow,</L>
<L>Or must she perish by a single blow?</L>

<L>And fashion'd into strength, shalt Thou repose,</L>
<L>Secure of lib'ral praise, since ISIS flows,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>True to her TAME, as duty hath decreed,</L>
<L>Nor longer, like a harlot, lust for TWEED,</L>
<L>And those old wreaths, which OXFORD once dar'd twine,</L>
<L>To grace a STUART brow, she plants on thine.</L>
