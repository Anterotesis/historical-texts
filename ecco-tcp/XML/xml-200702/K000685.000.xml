<HEAD>CAMILLUS: A POEM Humbly Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> and <HI>Monmouth.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Injur'd Heroes suffer in their Fame,</L>
<L>Justice, unsummon'd, shou'd their Wrongs proclaim;</L>
<L><HI>Apollo</HI>'s Sons shou'd raise Resentment high'r,</L>
<L>And flame in Raptures of Poetick Fire;</L>
<L>Since where Injustice clouds a Noble Name,</L>
<L>The Poet suffers in the Patron's Shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Permit, Great Sir, my humble Muse to raise</L>
<L>A grateful Monument to Crown your Praise;</L>
<L>Unbend your mighty Soul, and stoop to Fame,</L>
<L>Whose Voice shall sound to Heav'n your glorious Name.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Minds that are Great like Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs, disdain Applause,</L>
<L>Their inborn Vertue gives their Reason Laws,</L>
<L>Above the reach of Malice, bless'd they live,</L>
<L>Prou'd to be enay'd, and like <HI>Heav'n</HI> forgive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where shall my lab'ring Fancy Numbers find,</L>
<L>To sing the shining Glories of thy Mind?</L>
<L>Or thro' the lab'rynth of thy Wonders wind?</L>
<L>How dares my artless Pen attempt a Verse,</L>
<L>Worthy thy God-like Actions to reherse?</L>
<L>How dares my Muse to Songs of Valour press,</L>
<L>Which all alike admire, but none can well express!</L>
<L>About my Breast tumult'ous Terrors rowl,</L>
<L>And rising Passions shake my sickly Soul,</L>
<L>Reasons un-number'd through my Judgment shine,</L>
<L>Some urge, and some forbid the vast Design,</L>
<L><HI>Here</HI> Justice summons, <HI>There</HI> my Youth denies,</L>
<L>Duty to <HI>This,</HI> to <HI>That</HI> my Will replys,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Resolv'd, at last, your safe Return to greet,</L>
<L>I throw my worthless Numbers at your Feet,</L>
<L>Assur'd, the gen'rous Goodness of your Eye,</L>
<L>Will see my Will, and pass my Errors by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if my feeble Genius chance to fail,</L>
<L>Nor ardent Pray'rs can with the Nine prevail,</L>
<L>Think, Sir, how various your Great Acts appear,</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> War and Glory, Wit and Honour <HI>Here;</HI></L>
<L>One Glitt'ring Moment spreads your wond'rous Fame,</L>
<L>Battles and Bloodshed celebrate your Name;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Now the great Hero, in a Purple Flood,</L>
<L>Plunges thro' stormy Seas of hostile Blood;</L>
<L>Then Strides with skilful Courage from afar,</L>
<L>To stop the Gap of unsuccessful W A R:</L>
<L>Another Moment smoothly Guilds his Face</L>
<L>With Female Sweetness, and a Lovely Grace;</L>
<L>Calmly he Tunes his Mind to soster Sports,</L>
<L>And lives the Matchless Parragon of Courts,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No wonder then, if my presumptuous Eye,</L>
<L>Viewing thy Sun of Excellence too nigh,</L>
<L>Dazled with Light, is forc'd to look awry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, when some Traveller who wants a Guide,</L>
<L>O'er an extended Plain attempts to ride,</L>
<L>Where Num'rous Paths of Equal breadth appear,</L>
<L>Till he no longer knows which Course to Steer,</L>
<L>If, chusing wrong at last, he goes astray,</L>
<L>What Man wou'd blame him that he lost his way?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Peace, the fam'd <HI>HISPANIA</HI> long had slept,</L>
<L>And full Possession of her <HI>Indies</HI> kept;</L>
<L>Burthen'd with Plenty, idle Bliss they knew,</L>
<L>Till with their Swords, their Natures rusty grew:</L>
<L>But now, against their Wills, they climb to Fate,</L>
<L>And hostile Heroes force 'em to be Great,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When their late Monarch had resign'd his Breath,</L>
<L>And swift-wing'd Fame, proclaim'd his mighty Death,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
The Trumpets Clangors eccho'd from afar,</L>
<L>And Friendly Nations rose to sudden War;</L>
<L>The hardy Veterans their Arms prepare,</L>
<L>And waving Banners fan the Warlike Air;</L>
<L>The sprightly Steeds with lofty Bounds advance,</L>
<L>And curb'd by skillful Riders, proudly prance;</L>
<L>A wild Confusion o'er the Globe is hurl'd,</L>
<L>And dreadful Earthquakes shake the Christian World;</L>
<L>The <HI>AUSTRIAN</HI> Prince, Heir by a just Descent,</L>
<L>To gain his Right, his strong Endeavours bent:</L>
<L><HI>BOURBON</HI> oppos'd, and in the vacant Throne</L>
<L>Wou'd place a Royal Offspring of his own;</L>
<L>The first had Right, but Pow'r, which all obey,</L>
<L>Appear'd, to justifie the Second's Sway;</L>
<L>The Arms of <HI>France</HI> his false Pretence maintain,</L>
<L>And mount their <HI>ANJOU</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With helpless sighs the Injur'd <HI>AUSTRIAN</HI> stands,</L>
<L>And lifts to gracious <HI>Heav'n</HI> his Eyes and Hands;</L>
<L>He begs his Justice to a much-wrong'd Man,</L>
<L>And <HI>Heav'n</HI> directs his Pray'rs to matchless <HI>ANNE.</HI></L>
<L>Thither they fly whom pow'rful Wrongs oppress,</L>
<L>And find a certain Shelter from Distress:</L>
<L>By her the proud Usurper daily bleeds,</L>
<L>And Gazing Monarchs Wonder at her Deeds;</L>
<L>In deep Surprize and Silence, fix'd they stand,</L>
<L>And see the Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> in her Hand.</L>
<L>Thither, with tow'ring Hopes, and longing Eyes,</L>
<L>The Young Excluded Monarch swiftly flies,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Whispers in <HI>ANNA</HI>'s Ears his weighty Grief,</L>
<L>And from her Pitty'ng Soul extracts Relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At her Command the ready <HI>Britains</HI> fly,</L>
<L>Exert their inborn Worth and proudly die;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with their Fate, they gladly sell their Breath,</L>
<L>And smile amidst the raging Pangs of Death.</L>
<L>A Chosen Band of Men, who all things dare,</L>
<L>For distant War their mighty Souls prepare;</L>
<L>Through ev'ry Ear their Glorious Cause they Ring,</L>
<L>To Curb proud <HI>France,</HI> and Right an injur'd King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er these a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Earl of</HI> Peterborough.</NOTE> Chief, by Art and Nature grac'd,</L>
<L>Renown'd in War and Policy, was plac'd;</L>
<L>Beyond the rest his Judgment cou'd discern,</L>
<L>And cou'd with ease improve, what others cou'd not learn.</L>
<L>He ow'd not Virtue to the fear of Shame,</L>
<L>Nor practis'd Honesty in Hopes of Fame.</L>
<L>In him a spotless Honour firmly stood,</L>
<L>Bath'd in the Gen'rous Streams of Noble Blood.</L>
<L>Him the Great <HI>ANNA</HI> chose<HI>—CAMILLUS</HI> go,</L>
<L>Revenge my <HI>Brother</HI> on his haughty Foe,</L>
<L>Guard him through Dangers, give the Prince his own,</L>
<L>And safely lift him to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Valiant Chief, without Ambition Brave,</L>
<L>Humbly Receiv'd the Weighty Charge She gave;</L>
<L>Destin'd in spite of Malice to be Great,</L>
<L>He Arms his daring Soul to Combate Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>And now the <HI>British</HI> Gen'rals gladly meet,</L>
<L>And lead their Army to the waiting Fleet:</L>
<L>With swelling Hopes embark, and Joy to find</L>
<L>The brisk Assistance of a willing Wind.</L>
<L>In loud Salutes the deep-mouth'd Cannons Roar,</L>
<L>Answer'd by zealous Wishes from the Shore,</L>
<L>Whence mingled Crowds their hearty Pray'rs repeat,</L>
<L>Till rising Waves Obscure the sailing Fleet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On the extremest Limits of that Land,</L>
<L>Through which the <HI>Tagus,</HI> rich in Golden Sand,</L>
<L>His Rapid Course in depth of Waters bends,</L>
<L>And twice two hundred Miles his Stream extends,</L>
<L>Old <HI>BARCELONA,</HI> strong by Nature stands,</L>
<L>And Rules a vast Extent of fertile Lands.</L>
<L>With Rocky Mountains half environ'd round,</L>
<L>The other half, by Bogs and Marshy Ground;</L>
<L>Beneath her Walls surrounding Trenches lie,</L>
<L>Above their Banks rise Bulworks vastly high;</L>
<L>Walls within Walls the solid Place defend,</L>
<L>And watchful Centinels their Charge attend:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngines of hollow Brass, with fiery Breath,</L>
<L>Vomit black sulph'rous Messages of Death;</L>
<L>Charg'd with Destruction, speak with horrid Roar,</L>
<L>And scatter Terrors round the Neigh'bring Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither with crowded Sails the <HI>Britains</HI> bent,</L>
<L>Big with the Message their Great Mistress sent;</L>
<L>Their War-like Souls to Emulation rise,</L>
<L>And breath out pious Wishes to the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>And now those Pow'rs which brave Designs attend,</L>
<L>Had brought their Voyage to an happy End.</L>
<L>From <HI>Barcelona</HI>'s Tow'rs, with wild Affright,</L>
<L>The trembling Foe beholds th' unwelcome Sight;</L>
<L>A mighty Fleet approaching by degrees,</L>
<L>In graceful Order Ploughs the smiling Seas;</L>
<L>Harmonious Musick spreads the Joy they bring,</L>
<L>And Clam'rous Shouts proclaim the coming King:</L>
<L>The sounding Trumpets his Intent declare,</L>
<L>And waving Streamers flourish in the Air.</L>
<L>Arriv'd at length, the Cannons loudly roar,</L>
<L>And shake with panick Fright the wond'ring Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all their Force prepare,</L>
<L>And Arm confus'dly for defensive War;</L>
<L>Blind with Amusement, and ignoble Fear,</L>
<L>They double all the <HI>BRITAINS</HI> that appear;</L>
<L>All think with Horror, <HI>England</HI> now had bent</L>
<L>Her utmost Force to form one Grand Descent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when they saw so small a Number Land—</L>
<L>And boldly tread the Surface of their Sand,</L>
<L>The paler Marks of Fear forsook their Face,</L>
<L>And Wonder, far more Great, supplies the Place.</L>
<L>An equal Force within their Walls they found,</L>
<L>Yet fear'd to meet their Foes on equal Ground;</L>
<L>They saw, with Wonder at an Act so vain,</L>
<L>Th' undaunted <HI>Britains</HI> win the Neighb'ring Plain,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Where soon their Squadrons form'd a Camp, and then</L>
<L>They thought, or dreaded they were more than Men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus had the great <HI>CAMILLUS</HI> forc'd his Way,</L>
<L>And void of Fear, in midst of Dangers lay.</L>
<L>Impatient of Delays the <HI>Austrian</HI> Youth,</L>
<L>Deep touch'd with Sorrow, listen'd to the Truth;</L>
<L>He saw the Weakness of his daring Few,</L>
<L>And with Concern his Foes Advantage knew.</L>
<L>The Brazen Tubes of Death were mounted high,</L>
<L>And Clouds of rowling Smoak obscur'd the Sky:</L>
<L>All this and more, from his small Camp was seen,</L>
<L>And Death, disguis'd with Horror, stalk'd between.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Aged Chiefs, in cautious War grown old,</L>
<L>Wou'd rather be too backward than too bold;</L>
<L>Therefore advis'd the Prince to haste away,</L>
<L>Since 'twas scarce possible to live and stay.</L>
<L>The Prince, with melancholy Thoughts opprest,</L>
<L>Came to <HI>CAMILLUS</HI> and unlock'd his Breast,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Pangs of Sorrow, Shame and Rage,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shook the blooming Comforts of his Age:</L>
<L>Told him the Flames in which his Soul wou'd burn,</L>
<L>Shou'd he thus unsuccessfully Return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Grief the gen'rous <HI>Britain</HI> heard him tell</L>
<L>The deep Misfortunes he but knew too well.</L>
<L>He rowls his Eyes, accuses Partial Fate,</L>
<L>And tells the <HI>Austrian,</HI> that he shou'd be Great.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Resolv'd to act, the Council speak in vain,</L>
<L>And, by Debates, protract the Fall of <HI>Spain;</HI></L>
<L><HI>CAMILLUS</HI> had a Soul, whose Heav'nly Fire</L>
<L>Cou'd compass all Things, and to all aspire.</L>
<L>Himself alone cou'd with himself Debate,</L>
<L>And mov'd obscurely, like the Hand of Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard by the Tow'rs of <HI>Barcelona</HI> stands,</L>
<L>High on the Rocks o'erlooking Neighb'ring Lands,</L>
<L>A strong-built Castle, whose extended Sway</L>
<L>Obliges ev'n the City to Obey.</L>
<L>Five Hundred Men the solid Ramparts keep</L>
<L>On Rocks beyond Imagination steep;</L>
<L>Whence rowling Stones invading Foes can Chace,</L>
<L>When with an aking Eye they climb the dreadful Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This was the Source whence Victories must flow,</L>
<L>Hither the <HI>British</HI> Chief resolv'd to go;</L>
<L>Unus'd to Fear, and more unus'd to boast,</L>
<L>With temp'rate Words he chear'd his wond'ring Host;</L>
<L>Strove not to hide the Hazard of the Task,</L>
<L>Nor cover Danger with a guilded Mask:</L>
<L>He tells each Soldier what he must perform,</L>
<L>And by Example wins 'em to the Storm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Rosy Morning usher'd in the Sun,</L>
<L>Which was to see a bloody Business done;</L>
<L>His Beams shon bright to guide the Battle well,</L>
<L>And drank their Blood in Pitty as it fell.</L>
<L>Eight Hundred <HI>Britains</HI> on this glorious Day,</L>
<L>O'er Pathless Forrests force their oblique Way:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
In tedious March o'er high Assents they past,</L>
<L>And won the dang'rous Precipice at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With strange Surprize the Foe begins to Arm,</L>
<L>And Bells rung backward in a loud alarm:</L>
<L>The summon'd Soldiers hasten to their Post,</L>
<L>And pour whole Vollies on the climbing Host:</L>
<L>New Forms of Death huge falling Stones create,</L>
<L>And crush invading Numbers with their Weight.</L>
<L>Repeated Charges from the Cannons fly,</L>
<L>Like fiery Meteors blazing thro' the Sky.</L>
<L>The shatter'd Limbs of Men, who bravely dare,</L>
<L>Are born on Bullets thro' the flaming Air,</L>
<L>Adding new Motion to disjointed Parts;</L>
<L>The dismal Prospect shocks the bravest Hearts.</L>
<L>The brave <HI>CAMILLUS,</HI> with a fierce Delight,</L>
<L>Guides on the head-long Fury of the Fight;</L>
<L>Prompting his bleeding Troops to venture higher,</L>
<L>And scatter Death for Death, and Fire for Fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when of old, the mighty Giants strove</L>

<L>With Force like this, but in a Cause less good,</L>
<L>The huge <HI>Briareus,</HI> bath'd in Streams of Blood,</L>
<L>Stands on the Globe, attempts to conquer Fate,</L>
<L>And shakes the solid Center with his Weight;</L>
<L>Kicks at the Thunder which with Horror flies,</L>
<L>And while swift Lightning flashes in his Eyes,</L>
<L>Tears up a hundred Rocks, and throws 'em at the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<L>But now aloft the mingled War grows high,</L>
<L>On heaps promiscuous Numbers fall and Die;</L>
<L>Rivers of Blood from the mix'd Battle flows,</L>
<L>Till Death scarce sees to Guide her destin'd Blows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Walls are won, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lose the Day,</L>
<L>And Valiant <HI>Britains</HI> win the Cover'd Way:</L>
<L>Soldiers below, by mutual Help ascend,</L>
<L>While those above the Conquer'd Pass Defend.</L>
<L>No more the driven Foes their Fortune try,</L>
<L>But quit their bloody Battlements and fly:</L>
<L>Despair and Horror fill the Dismal Place,</L>
<L>And Terror sits Enthron'd on ev'ry Face;</L>
<L>Destructive Fate grows Cruel to Excess,</L>
<L>And rages blindly in her blackest Dress.</L>
<L>Matrons and Virgins Weep with bitter Cries,</L>
<L>And Noisy Sorrows pierce the distant Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But cease, mistaken Wretches, cease your Moan,</L>
<L>And on your bended Knees your Follies own;</L>
<L>Tho' haughty <HI>Gauls</HI> will still Tyrannick be,</L>
<L><HI>CAMILLUS</HI> Conquers but to set you Free.</L>
<L>His Gen'rous Soul no base Intention knows,</L>
<L>But Pitties ev'n the Blackest of his Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This swift Success confounds the wondring King,</L>
<L>And all the Host their Gen'ral's Praises sing.</L>
<L>But he with wonted Care proceeds to End</L>
<L>The vast Design, such early Joys attend;</L>
<L>VVith rich Rewards he chears his Men again,</L>
<L>And leads them down with Courage to the Plain,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
There plants divided Troops on distant Ground,</L>
<L>To force a City they not half surround.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus moves he brightly like some wand'ring Star,</L>
<L>And scorns the heavy Arts of Common VVar;</L>
<L>His Actions by their Merits brightly blaze,</L>
<L>He needs no Council, and he seeks no Praise.</L>
<L>VVhile other Gen'rals tedious Projects Form,</L>
<L>He Thinks, and Acts, and VVins Applause by Storm;</L>
<L>With furious Courage stands and Tempts his Fate,</L>
<L>But <HI>Heav'n</HI> still spares the MAN to Bless the STATE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Threat'ning Look each ready <HI>Britain</HI> stands,</L>
<L>And sharp-edg'd VVeapons grace their VVar-like Hands,</L>
<L>Obsequious Silence waits the Gen'ral's Nod,</L>
<L>As Ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> watch'd the <HI>Delphian</HI> God.</L>

<LG>
<L>And now the mighty Deed is greatly done,</L>
<L>A King reliev'd and Kingdoms bravely won;</L>
<L>The Warlike Chief, with Glory fir'd his Breast,</L>
<L>Forgot his Pleasures, and forsook his Rest;</L>

<L>The stubborn <HI>Catalans,</HI> unus'd to bow,</L>
<L>Gladly submit to firm Subjection now;</L>
<L>With joyful Shouts their happy Monarch greet,</L>

<L>That strong-built Fort, whose State the rest excell'd,</L>

<L><HI>Valencia</HI>'s Kingdom Gloriously he won,</L>
