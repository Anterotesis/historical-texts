<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am, by Profession, no Poet, Yet, having a Son, of my own, at this Time, of no small Hope, in one of our famous Universities; I cannot, therefore, be suppos'd to want Reverence for those Seminaries of the Muses: Upon this Account partly (for, of Itself, I have no great Opinion of Poetry) but, perceiving, at the Head of the Manuscript, that it had been written by a <HI>Fellow of All-Souls;</HI> and chiefly, invited by some encour∣aging Expressions, in the Beginning, alluding to a Chariot, that could carry a Man up to the Stars, I bestow'd a serious Perusal on the Ver∣ses, which I, herewith, publish; and which I found one rainy Day, at the Bottom of a
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
Hackney-Coach; where, I suppose, they might have been dropt, by Somebody, who had been in Possession of that Coach, before me.</P>
<P>But, I confess, the oftner I perus'd the Ma∣nuscript, the less I was able to comprehend of its Meaning; I had not, indeed, labour'd far in the Matter, before I discovered, that the Au∣thor, notwithstanding he has been pleased to make free with the <HI>Stars,</HI> is a <HI>Novice</HI> in <HI>our Science;—</HI> so that what he writes, con∣cerning the <HI>Thinness of Heaven's Purlieus;—surmounting the Stars in a Chariot of Air,</HI> and such like promising Conceptions, ought not (I believe) to be taken in the strict Sense of the Phrase, but only for a Joke, or a Fancy;—However, some of my Profession, to whom I shew'd it, agreed, that it was a dark Piece of Work, had more in it, than <HI>Satire;</HI> and, for any thing They, or I, knew to the contrary, might be Matter of Danger to the Government, and ought to be carried to the Secretary's Office.</P>
<P>By a Mind, laudably filled with a Zeal for his Country's Safety, every Hint, that infers its Danger, should be thought of the utmost Importance; To the Secretary's Office, therefore, I went with it, and put it into the Hands of one, who appear'd to think Himself more consi∣derable, than any Body, I cou'd see about him; I begg'd the Favour, that he would look it over, and give me his Opinion, whether it was a treasonable Libel: I would not, willingly, do
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Injustice to the Characters of Persons, above my Station, (tho' it is well known, <HI>Physick,</HI> and <HI>Astrology,</HI> are consider'd with <HI>Respect,</HI> among Liberal Sciences.) But, truly, be seem'd to me, to peruse it, with less Seriousness, than, I suppose, with all due Reverence to his Office, became the Trust, that was lodg'd in him: For he laugh'd out, once, or twice; and, lifting his Eyes from the Paper, took upon him, to remark me, with a Countenance, which I thought too merry for the Occasion: He was pleas'd, when he came to the following Lines, to read them aloud, to a Young Spark, in Red, and ask'd him, what <HI>He</HI> thought of the Mat∣ter?—I confess, I was almost in a Passion, when this <HI>Feather-Brain</HI> made answer, that it was the liveliest Satire in the World, upon a <HI>Bawdy-House,</HI> of his Acquaintance, by the Bank Side, over the Water!—I cite the very Verses, for the Reader's more effectual Amazement, at the Unaccountableness of the Young Fellows of this forward Generation!</P>
<Q><L><HI>Caught, by the gulphy</HI> Void, <HI>that gloom'd, below,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Crowds, from the Current's fair-descending Flow,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Indrawn, at once, by Darkness swallow'd o'er,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sunk, from their sunny Scene, and rose no more;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Still gap'd th'unclosing Deep, o'er Millions gone,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet, still insatiate, hourly, swallow'd on.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I could not forbear telling this Story, with due Gravity, and Resentment, to a certain
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
Lawyer, of my Acquaintance, whom I met, just landed, at <HI>White-Hall</HI> Stairs: we walk'd together, a few Turns, in the Privy-Garden, and he open'd the Manuscript, where it speaks of <HI>Shapeless Bodies,</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Whose breathing Bulks; to Life, and Motion, blown,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shot into human Forms, compleatly grown;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mix'd Rank, and Sex, sprung thro' the liquid Jett,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But pouring outward, clear</HI> Distinction <HI>met:</HI></L></Q>
<P>He read it, once and again, and was clear in his Opinion it meant the <HI>Masquerade,</HI> in the <HI>Hay-market:</HI> He own'd, indeed, that, under proper Hands, it might be explain'd into something more considerable—But we wave it, cry'd he, after reading it a little farther, we will wave the Point of <HI>Treason,</HI> in Exchange for <HI>Scandalum Magnatum!</HI> It follows here, as clear, as Sunshine, upon a Minister of State, and a Privy-Counsellor: Then he read to me this slanderous <HI>Inuendo,</HI> of People, who coming within Reach of a <HI>dark, bustling, Power, obscurely seen,</HI></P>
<Q><L>From the blind Bounty of his hasty Hand,</L>
<L>Buoyant, in Boats, rode o'er the shining Sand;</L>
<L>Of different Form, these Boats—A single Oar</L>
<L>Distinguish'd some—some wing'd their Sides with more;</L>
<L>Others, with Oars, and Sails, conjoyn'd, made way,</L>
<L>And mow'd the murm'ring Surge, with sweepy Sway;</L>
<L><PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
While some slow Pole-men, o'er their Toil reclin'd,</L>
<L>Push'd their check'd Barks, and, labouring, lagg'd, behind:</L>
<L>Some waded, naked, &amp;c.—</L></Q>
<P>He ask'd me, whether I did not plainly discern, what great Man, in a certain Assem∣bly, was pointed at, under this Image of a <HI>dark, bustling, Power, obscurely seen;</HI> upon which, recollecting myself, as became me, and pondering the Words, to the best of my Capa∣city, I reply'd, I thought it was the <HI>Devil.—</HI> He shook his Head, and inform'd me, civilly, that I was, <HI>a little,</HI> mistaken; but perceiving me, in some measure abash'd, he assur'd me, it was so natural an Error, that any Body might have fallen into it, as well as I: Then proceeded to convince me, that <HI>shining Sand</HI> was a <HI>Cant-Word</HI> for <HI>Mo∣ney Bags;</HI> that by the Boats said to be distri∣buted, at Random, by the Bounty of the blind Power, that was so busy in Darkness, was to be understood, those <HI>Gratifications,</HI> impudently call'd <HI>Pensions,</HI> by Persons disaffected to the Ministry; That, for Example, the largest of such pretended Pensions were represented, under the Similitude of <HI>Boats which had Sails, and Oars, together:—</HI> Middling Pensions, were <HI>Boats with many Oars:—</HI> Smaller still, were <HI>One-Oar'd Barks:—</HI> The least of all, were <HI>Pole-men:—</HI> And as for the <HI>naked Waders,</HI> it was, by this Time, become
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
clear to my own unassisted Capacity, that they could mean nothing, but those poor Souls, who were neglected by the <HI>black Bustler,</HI> and had no Pensions at all to take Boat with.</P>
<P>My ingenious Friend the Lawyer, advis'd me to write a Letter, to the Great Man, who had made so light of a good Subject's Informa∣tion, and put him in Mind of the Fate of <HI>Philotas.—</HI> He added, that the Fears of Statesmen would be more awake, for their Masters, if less watchful for Themselves: He was sorry, he was, then, in Haste, but invi∣ted me next Morning to his Chambers, where he assured me, no Assistance, in his Power, should be wanting, to <HI>make something</HI> of the Matter, we had been conferring on.</P>
<P>How admirable is the Penetration of some Men's Spirits! and how powerful the good Influence of their Example!—I, who, before I had received this Light, could see no Tendency to such seditious Purpose, in the Ma∣nuscript, so providentially <HI>decypher'd,</HI> could, now, in every Page of it, discover the clearest, and most visible, <HI>Disaffection:</HI> Nay, I have, since that Time, upon frequent Revisal of the Libel, under Help of better Eyes, than my own, found <HI>Popery</HI> in it, as well as <HI>Jacobitism.</HI> Not to mention, that the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Name, Itself, in great Letters, stands audaciously written at the End of it.</P>
<P>I sent a Copy, with a Recital of all the foregoing Particulars, to my Boy, before-men∣tion'd,
<PB N="xi" REF="9"/>
who is, now, of three Years standing, at the College; where, I fear, his Political Principles have been new-modell'd, since I saw him; for he seems a little <HI>Malepert,</HI> in a Let∣ter, he return'd me, for Answer: which, however, in Justice to the good Parts of the Youth, I take Pleasure in Publishing; not sup∣posing, the Childish Mistake, it turns upon, capable of making any Impression, upon Readers, who <HI>know the World,</HI> and are acquainted with <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Business.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honour'd Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am sorry to say, I was asham'd of your Account, concerning the Manuscript, you demand my Thoughts of; It is no other, than a <HI>Satire,</HI> written, by <HI>One</HI> Poet, on the Misapplication of <HI>Another's</HI> Genius;—You apprehended it to mean <HI>more,</HI> than the Author design'd, by finding it say <HI>less,</HI> than the Reader expected; But Scurrility, and Grossness, are so far from being <HI>Requisites</HI> in <HI>Satire,</HI> that it can be no <HI>true Satire,</HI> in which they are to be met with. The Force of these Writings consists, in their <HI>Smiling;</HI> and whenever they grow <HI>angry,</HI> they bring a Storm over their own Sunshine; which, like the Frown of incens'd Beauty, loses more, by Abatement of Influence, than is gain'd, from Accession of Rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="10"/>
The <HI>Pope,</HI> at the End of the Poem, ought to give you no Jealousy: He is none of his <HI>Holyness,</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> but an <HI>English,</HI> (I had almost said, <HI>Protestant) Pope,</HI> of this Nation's own Breeding; He wears, indeed, a <HI>Triple Crown,</HI> like the other, but it is of <HI>Musick, Painting,</HI> and <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more easily perceived, than, that this Satire is the Consequence of some Pieces, lately publish'd, which savour, to say Truth, of a Sensibility, too like <HI>Levity,</HI> in a Mind, so rich, as His, who is reputed their Author; But I cannot, without Plea∣sure, observe the Influence of acknowledg'd Merit confining Satire to his <HI>Folly,</HI> without allowing it to attack his <HI>Wit;</HI> which is not weaker, tho' less lovely, when it stains itself upon a dirty Subject, than, when it orna∣ments Beauty itself, and adds Magnificence to Palaces.</P>
<P>It is an <HI>Art</HI> to <HI>trifle, importantly;</HI> and even to <HI>trifle, agreeably,</HI> has its Attra∣ction: But to trifle, unseasonably, indecently or improperly, let who will be the Trifler, must be, either, inhumane, or unguarded—Either wrong Judgment, or Ill-breeding.</P>
<P>What Pity, that the warmest of a certain Gentleman's Admirers are, lately, forc'd to confess, there are <HI>Grossnesses,</HI> in some of his Sallies, obscene enough to blot out any Wit, but their Author's! <HI>Insults,</HI> low enough to be∣come the most vulgar-spirited among his Ene∣mies:
<PB N="xiii" REF="11"/>
And <HI>Malice,</HI> animated enough to be beautiful, in any of his Friends, but Himself!</P>
<P>It gives, however, a Kind of ill-natur'd Comfort to us, who are his <HI>distant Cotem∣poraries,</HI> that among Virtues, which we must despair of equalling, we discover Er∣rors, which we disdain to imitate.—So, pray, Sir, commit the Poem to the Press, and let it travel, in Search of its Author, who will, hardly, look for it in <HI>Your</HI> Hands, and, by that Means, it may be lost to the Publick.</P>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unveiling, thence, the World's bleak Wastes, below,</L>
<L>They saw the <HI>Stream of Life</HI> beneath 'em flow;</L>
<L>Dim, from the sable Sea of <HI>Birth</HI> it rose,</L>
<L>In a slow, silent, sullen, dread Repose:</L>
<L>For, round th'emerging Source, that glimmer'd pale,</L>
<L>Mountains of Midnight Darkness roll'd a Veil:</L>
<L>But, as the evolving Surge swell'd into Day,</L>
<L>Quick'ning, it mov'd, and roar'd, and rush'd away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Broad, on the Left, from low <HI>Oblivion</HI>'s Shore,</L>
<L>Quicksands, and Rocks, reach'd half the Current o'er:</L>
<L>Lucid, like Truth, the treach'rous Water shone,</L>
<L>And, o'er gay gilded Shoals, ran, tuneful, on;</L>
<L>Pebbles, of Gem-like Hue, with painted Pride,</L>
<L>Glow'd thro' the Wave, and burnt, amid the Tide:</L>
<L>Wantonly kind, the Sun's enliv'ning Beams</L>
<L>Shower'd, in light Spangles, on the dancing Streams:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="15"/>
While Insect Nations, <HI>Gnats,</HI> and <HI>Wasps,</HI> and <HI>Flies,</HI></L>
<L>Ting'd in the Rainbow's ever-changing Dyes,</L>
<L>Sheathing their Stings, and, smiling, like the <HI>Fair,</HI></L>
<L>Peopled the Sunshine, and adorn'd the Air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Less lively, on the Right, the Stream's <HI>deep</HI> Flow,</L>
<L>There, no false Colours mix'd their varied Glow;</L>
<L>No gawdy Bottom catch'd the <HI>downcast</HI> Eye:</L>
<L><HI>Above,</HI> no flutt'ring Insects wing'd the Sky:</L>
<L>Serenely solemn, All!—One equal <HI>Whole</HI></L>
<L>Flash'd not upon the Sense, but touch'd the Soul:</L>
<L>Instead of Rocks, green Islands flourish'd, here,</L>
<L>Silent, and fruitful, as the full-grown Year;</L>
<L>In Place of <HI>Flies,</HI> grave <HI>Swans,</HI> of Snow-like Hue,</L>
<L>Sweetly majestick, in slow Circles, flew:</L>
<L>But, tho' these Isles the distant Prospect chear'd,</L>

<L>Kind Birds, alone, gave Entrance o'er the Mound,</L>

<L>All Eyes attracted, and each Hearing charm'd;</L>
<L>Pointing in Transport, All their Helms forsook,</L>
<L>And, on one Object, hung their length'ning Look.</L>

<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
<L>Down, from the gloomy Source, in sidelong Float,</L>
<L>Proudly descending, mov'd a glittering Boat;</L>
<L>Her silken Sails a colour'd Radiance threw,</L>
<L>And ting'd the Sunny Beams, thro' which they flew;</L>
<L>While Oars, of Silver, dash'd the watry Spray,</L>
<L>That rain'd in gemmy Showers, and dazled Day:</L>
<L>High, on the painted Stern, a Youth appear'd,</L>
<L>Who, rather <HI>happily,</HI> than <HI>strongly,</HI> steer'd;</L>
<L>Faint, and unstriking was his anguish'd Mien,</L>
<L>Sadden'd by Sickness, and o'ercast with Spleen;</L>
<L>Yet, from his Eyes, there beam'd a living Light,</L>
<L>Keen, and intent, as a fir'd Eagle's Sight:</L>
<L>And, from his Voice, (for, as he sail'd, he <HI>sung)</HI></L>
<L>Such magick Sounds of melting Musick sprung,</L>
<L>That the hush'd Heaven all downward seem'd to bend,</L>
<L>And, against Nature, the charm'd Earth ascend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Careless, he look'd, yet, heedful of his Way,</L>
<L>Broke the kind Current's unobstructing Sway,</L>
<L>That kiss'd his Oars, and hasten'd to obey:</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="23"/>
Scarce was his Course <HI>oblique,</HI> for each glad Boat,</L>
<L>That, envious, stem'd all other's rival Float,</L>
<L>Fix'd, and enchanted, when this Youth drew nigh,</L>
<L>Hung on his passing Notes, and help'd him by:</L>
<L>The <HI>Muses</HI> row'd him, and the <HI>Graces'</HI> Care</L>
<L>Trim'd his light Sails, and spread them to the Air;</L>
<L>In his Boat's Bottom green-ey'd <HI>Envy</HI> lay,</L>
<L>And serv'd, as <HI>Ballast,</HI> while she clog'd his way:</L>
<L>Down from her Chariot light-wing'd <HI>Fancy</HI> flew,</L>
<L>And o'er him, loose, her Starry Mantle threw;</L>
<L><HI>Pleasure, Praise, Beauty,</HI> 'twixt his Shrowds trod gay,</L>
<L>And danc'd the measur'd Moments soft away:</L>
<L>Sportful as ZEPHYRS, in his Smiles, they strove,</L>
<L>And the Young <HI>Loves</HI> forsook their Mother's Grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus fortunate, thus favour'd, and thus bright,</L>
<L>Luckily negligent, and aptly light,</L>
<L>He touch'd no Shoal, safe rounded every Rock,</L>
<L>Despis'd all Danger, and sustain'd no Shock;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="24"/>
'Till to that calmer Coast approaching nigh,</L>
<L>And gliding, 'twixt green Islands, safely high,</L>
<L>Circles of hovering Swans, with joyful Note,</L>
<L>Clapp'd their broad Wings, in Triumph, o'er his Boat,</L>
<L>Charm'd, that, so soon, he reach'd their solemn Side,</L>
<L>Ere yet one Third of the Stream's Length was try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Steering, from Isle to Isle, with joyless Awe,</L>
<L>Thin, o'er each Height, their white-rob'd Lords he saw,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, without Transport, bow the Palms, they bore,</L>
<L>To hail his Passage near their silent Shore;</L>
<L><HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>uncharm'd,</HI> he sought his favourite Croud,</L>
<L>Immensely distant, now, tho', late, so loud:</L>
<L>All was serene, the Air was hush'd around,</L>
<L>The Waters calm!—Lost even <HI>His</HI> Musick's Sound!</L>
<L>Back to the Left impatient Looks he cast</L>
<L>And long'd for every shining Insect past;</L>
<L>Distant he saw them, Wings o'er Wings, display,</L>
<L>And, in light Chases, thread the colour'd Ray:</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="25"/>
Eager, for these, contending Pilots strove,</L>
<L>And catch'd them, careless how their Vessels drove;</L>
<L>Then, with their Trophies, dress'd each gaudy Sail,</L>
<L>While humming <HI>Drones,</HI> in Swarms, their Fortune hail:</L>
<L>Record past Leaps, foretel their next Essays,</L>
<L>And buzz, melodious, in the <HI>Fly-men</HI>'s Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Warm'd, and misled, by this false Fire of Fame,</L>
<L>His beaming Eyes with Emulation flame;</L>
<L>And have I, Recreant, thus, renounc'd a Field,</L>
<L>Where baffled Danger can such Glory yield?</L>
<L>Lives there a <HI>Catch-Fly,</HI> of yon venturous Press,</L>
<L>More brave than I am?—Or, who fears them less?</L>
<L>Shew me the warring Wasp, whose threatning Wing</L>
<L>I dare not strike at, and provoke his Sting!</L>
<L>Swans! give me Way—your shoreless Islands keep,</L>
<L>Too safe your Clime is, and too calm your Deep;</L>
<L>I chuse a rapid Glory, not a slow,</L>
<L>Shoals are <HI>sought Harbours,</HI> where these <HI>Jewels</HI> grow:</L>

<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
<L>He said, and rising, push'd, with liquid Sweep,</L>
<L>Th' inverted Helm, and goar'd the groaning Deep:</L>
<L>Flaming erect, resought the surgy Side,</L>
<L>And bounded, threatning, o'er the foaming Tide:</L>
<L>Sailing athwart the Swarms, and skipping high,</L>
<L>He snatch'd, triumphant, every tempting <HI>Fly:</HI></L>
<L>Gave his loos'd Rudder to the Current's Claim,</L>
<L>And drove, disdainful, thro' his Rival's Game;</L>
<L>Press'd by <HI>invaded Wasp's</HI> excited Stings,</L>
<L>He warr'd, revengeful, on their falling Wings:</L>
<L>Thro' Dust of slaughter'd <HI>Gnats</HI> he fought, in Shade,</L>
<L>And squeez'd them, deathful, on the Wounds, they made:</L>
<L>Fleets of cold Opposites, from all Sides, join,</L>
<L>And, wedg'd, against this general Foe, combine:</L>
<L><HI>Vainly</HI> indignant, they resist his Sway,</L>
<L>Yet block his Passage, and obstruct his Way:</L>
<L>Still, tho' he stagnates, he the Fight maintains,</L>
<L>While Drones, applausive, with their ductile Strains,</L>
<L>Homage the rising Hero's new Renown,</L>
<L>And <HI>Prince of Fly-Catchers</HI> the Champion crown.</L>

<L>The <HI>Swans,</HI> mean-while, which, from the calmer Side,</L>
<L>Forsaken, saw him trust the fatal Tide;</L>
<L>Mournful, with pendent Wing, his Triumph griev'd,</L>
<L>And wish'd his wasted Vigour less deceiv'd:</L>
<L>Trembling, they mark'd his Vessel, downward bent,</L>
<L>Hang o'er th' engulphing Ocean's dark Descent,</L>
<L>While he, regardless, still, new Trophies won,</L>
<L>And, bent to <HI>conquer,</HI> saw not what to <HI>shun.</HI></L>
