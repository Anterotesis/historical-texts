<L>A Quaker with's dark Lanthorn light.</L>
<L>Is here exposed to your sight;</L>
<L>Stript off's nice Vizard and fair Paint,</L>
<L>Wherein he us'd to Ape a Saint.</L>
<L>So false Fires may delude our Eyes,</L>
<L>And seem like Stars to guild the Skies;</L>
<L>Till Reason proves they owe their Birth</L>
<L>To stinking vapours of the Earth.</L>
<L>This Hypocrite we here essay,</L>
<L>In's proper Colours to display;</L>
<L>Whose Yea and Nay in mischief goes</L>
<L>Beyond the Hectors damning Oaths</L>
<L>A Play-house Beau, is not so Gay,</L>
<L>As now a Days the Yea and Nay:</L>
<L>Whose Wigg in Curles, with Powder Drest,</L>
<L>Makes him as Wicked as the rest;</L>
<L>And seems to Act so very oddly,</L>
<L>You'd Swear he's fallen from the Godly:</L>
<L>For when he looks the most Precise,</L>
<L>He tells you damn'd confounded Lyes.</L>

<HEAD><HI>D' FOE</HI>'s Answer to the <HI>Quakers CATECHISM,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Quaker is a <HI>Hogs-head of Phanaticisme</HI> drawn off to the Lees; a <HI>Common-Shore</HI> of Heresie into which most extravagant Opinions at last <HI>Disembogue</HI> themselves and <HI>center,</HI> the <HI>fag-end</HI> of Reformation marked with a <HI>sullen meagre-look,</HI> and this Characteristick <HI>Thou;</HI> A Fox in a <HI>Lamb∣skin Coat,</HI> that retains his <HI>Subtlety</HI> though not his <HI>colour,</HI> a <HI>dough-baked</HI> piece of formality that decries <HI>Supersti∣tion,</HI> yet idolizes <HI>Garbs</HI> and <HI>Phrases.</HI> You may know him by his <HI>diminitive-band,</HI> that looks like the <HI>Folorne∣hope</HI> of his Shirt crawling out at his Collar; for his <HI>pu∣rity</HI> consists only in his <HI>Dress,</HI> and his Religion is, <HI>Not to speak like his Neighbours.</HI> His Orignal is as Obscure as the head of <HI>Nile;</HI> some refer it to <HI>Behmen</HI> the can∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Philosophaster of <HI>Germany.</HI> Others run his Pe∣digree higher, and say he was <HI>hatcht</HI> when the <HI>degra∣ded Seraphm</HI> first took on him to counterfeit an <HI>Angel of Light.</HI> He is a meer Composition of <HI>Contradiction</HI> and <HI>Clownishnessana,</HI> with a sew odd <HI>Scruples</HI> of Hypo∣crisie to give it a <HI>Tincture.</HI> Should the Parliament make a Law for Eating, he would Starve rather then be Guilty of obeying it; and if you would have him do a thing, you need only forbid it on Pain of Death: He thinks that to be <HI>Religious</HI> one is obliged to be <HI>Un∣civil,</HI> and flings his Witts over Board to make room for <HI>Inspirations.</HI> His Dreams he Intitles Visions, and each <HI>Crapicio</HI> of his Fancy must pass for a divine <HI>Reve∣lation,</HI> to which he Blasphemously puts a <HI>Probatum est, The Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</HI> The first Article of
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
this <HI>Creed</HI> is to keep his Hat on, which he observs so Religiously, as if he thought <HI>vailing Bonnet</HI> to be the Sin against the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> Titles of Honour he takes for infallible Marks of the Beast, and believes the Master of the Ceremonies to be <HI>Antichrist;</HI> He would have done rarely in the old <HI>Chaos</HI> before Nature had anked ihings in their places, being a profest Enemy to all Order, that thinks there's no <HI>pure walking</HI> unless it be with the Heels upwards: He bears a Grudge a∣gainst <HI>Paul</HI> for saying <HI>most noble Festus,</HI> and hates the Memory of <HI>Sarah</HI> because she called her Husband <HI>Lord</HI> His Discourses are nothing but a <HI>Rhapsody</HI> of oft re∣peated <HI>Non-sense;</HI> and when he hath darkned your Understanding with a Cloud of infignificant <HI>Babble,</HI> he Cry's, <HI>Ah! Friends mind the Light!</HI> He usually be∣gins with <HI>Raving</HI> like <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his <HI>Falling-fit,</HI> or the Devil of <HI>Delphose's Priests,</HI> that never delivered their Lying <HI>Oracles,</HI> but with <HI>extravagant Gestures</HI> and <HI>odd Distortions</HI> of Body, <HI>Swear not at all,</HI> is his Motto, but <HI>Lies</HI> he holds in many cases <HI>Venial,</HI> and in <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o meritori∣ous,</HI> when they make for the <HI>Interest of the beloved Seed,</HI> or reflect <HI>Scandal</HI> on the <HI>Government.</HI> He Cheats worse then a <HI>Long-lane Broaker,</HI> by pretending to deal <HI>at a word,</HI> and the <HI>Hook</HI> whereby he draws in his Cus∣tomers, is a <HI>far-fetcht Sigh,</HI> and <HI>plainly I tell thee Friend.</HI></P>
<P>This troublesome <HI>Insect</HI> (for all his <HI>demure Looks)</HI> is deservedly suspected to be part of the <HI>Vermine</HI> dropt from the <HI>Beast,</HI> a <HI>Puppet of Religion,</HI> contrived to amuse the <HI>Rabble,</HI> that receives it's Motion from his <HI>Holynes∣ses</HI> invisible Hand behind the Curtain; for though the <HI>Jesuite</HI> and he seem Enemies, at long run (like <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,)</HI> they prove the same <HI>Equivocations</HI> being as common with them both as <HI>Curses</HI> to a <HI>Gamester.</HI> Ask our <HI>trembling Saint</HI> if he believe the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> he shall answer <HI>yea,</HI> but tell you another time, he meant only <HI>an arising from Sin;</HI> by <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> he intends no more but several <HI>Scenes</HI> Transacted <HI>with∣in</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<HI>us,</HI> and abuses <HI>holy Scripture</HI> into a mystical <HI>Romance</HI> Each of them averrs <HI>Perfection</HI> Attainable in this Life but herein they differ, the <HI>Papist</HI> Acknowledgeth but <HI>one Pope</HI> in the World, the Quaker sets up a Pope in <HI>every Individual Breast,</HI> to whom all <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea∣son</HI> must <HI>Truckle;</HI> so that refusing the <HI>Polestar</HI> of Gods Word and the <HI>Churches Compass,</HI> he will needs <HI>Steer</HI> by the wandring Motion of a Treacherous <HI>Ignus fatuus</HI> within, subject to be <HI>blown any way,</HI> and often Exting∣uisht by the Hurricanes of <HI>Passion.</HI></P>
<P>He makes <HI>Self</HI> the Centre whereunto the Lines of all his Actions tend, and like a <HI>Hedge-hog</HI> wrapt up in his own warm down, turn out <HI>Brisles</HI> to all the World besides; you can come on no side of him but he <HI>Pricks</HI> and <HI>Bites,</HI> and all his <HI>Craggy</HI> and <HI>Inhospitable.</HI> He that deals with him has need of more Eyes then <HI>Poets bestow on Argus,</HI> for he out-vies a <HI>Genoe's</HI> for Subtlety, and a <HI>Jew</HI> may come to be an Apprentice with him; he loves the <HI>Exchange</HI> though he hates the <HI>Church,</HI> and Admires no Preaching so much as <HI>Foxes.</HI></P>
<P>For all his peaceable <HI>Sheepish</HI> Countenance, he de∣lights in <HI>Contention,</HI> and when he is <HI>Thou-ing a Court</HI> of Justice, thinks himself in his proper Element. He bawls (like an <HI>Oysterwife)</HI> at other Folks <HI>Pride,</HI> and evidences his own <HI>Humility</HI> onely in defying the <HI>Ped∣lars Pack, Lace, Ribbons, &amp;c.</HI> whilest he <HI>sawcily</HI> con∣temns his <HI>Superiours,</HI> and prefers the <HI>Crotchets</HI> of his own <HI>giddy Brain</HI> before the <HI>Decrees of a general Council.</HI> He hates <HI>no Whore</HI> so much as her of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and ever and anon greatifies <HI>the old Man</HI> with a kind <HI>Green-ap∣ron'd Friend,</HI> whom he picks up at a <HI>Conventicle</HI> by a <HI>teacherous Touch</HI> of the Hand, under pretence of a <HI>pure Salutation,</HI> and finding by her <HI>rampant Pulse,</HI> and temp∣ting turning up the <HI>Whites,</HI> (which she pretends to do in <HI>Devotion)</HI> that her desires are <HI>at Flood,</HI> they retire to∣gether for mutual <HI>Edification.</HI> He is often <HI>Drunk,</HI> but not like his Neighbours <HI>Temporally,</HI> for <HI>Sleep</HI> cannot
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
cure him, but the <HI>Fumes</HI> of his spiritual Pride having <HI>Intoxicated</HI> his Head, makes his very Soul <HI>Reel,</HI> and but his Body into a fit of <HI>Shivering;</HI> ye, will he not privatly in the company of <HI>Friends</HI> refuse the <HI>refreshing Bottle,</HI> provided it be not known in <HI>Gath,</HI> nor publish∣ed amongst the wicked of <HI>Askalon,</HI> for he confesseth the use <HI>of the Creature</HI> (especially when it comes on <HI>Free-cost)</HI> to be <HI>exceeding Lawful.</HI> He is very curious to be in all things <HI>contrary to the common Mode,</HI> that he may be taken notice of, for a <HI>singular Man,</HI> and hav∣ing screw'd his Face into a Religious Frame, and turn'd his Voice to a <HI>puling sanctimonious Key,</HI> he uses it as a <HI>Low-bell</HI> to catch <HI>Larks,</HI> or rather such <HI>Owles</HI> as will be <HI>Bubbled</HI> out of their Money merely on the Repute of his <HI>conscientions Dealing;</HI> he abominates our <HI>Churches,</HI> and sayes very well, that <HI>God must be Wor∣shipped every where in Spirit,</HI> yet will rather be <HI>knock'd o'th' Head</HI> theu forsake <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> here it is that he <HI>Glories in Tribulations.</HI></P>
<P>In brief, a Quaker is a <HI>Cynick</HI> in Religion, one that would have <HI>Illnature</HI> translated <HI>Grace;</HI> as if the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> (that <HI>pure sweet gentle Dove)</HI> did inspire Men with <HI>sullen Humours</HI> and <HI>waspish Disposition:</HI> He hates both <HI>Magistracie</HI> and <HI>Ministrie,</HI> and never speaks, well of <HI>Authority</HI> or <HI>Obedience,</HI> but when he is going to lash his <HI>Maid</HI> or his <HI>Apprentices;</HI> for though himself have shaken off all <HI>subjection</HI> to Superious, yet to his <HI>Dome∣sticks</HI> he is worse then an <HI>Egyptian Taskmaster,</HI> and speaks to his <HI>Servants</HI> in a tone as imperious as the <HI>Grand Seigniour</HI> to his <HI>Mutes;</HI> he cannot endure Cere∣monies or Complements, especially where his Belly is concerned, and therefore falls to all meat (as Gal∣lants do to a Wench or Oysters) without saying Grace, he is very diligent in his Generation-work, and may therefore have many Children but no Heirs; for his Issue comes into the World out-law'd, and can no more boast to be born in lawful Wedlock, then
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
the <HI>Kinchen-cove</HI> of a <HI>Gypsie</HI> got under a Hedge by a strauling <HI>Tinker;</HI> he bannes the Banes, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Respect only refuses <HI>License,</HI> Consummating his Marriage before it is Solemnized; for so soon as the Spirit begins to yield to the Rebellion of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and his Bowels Yearn to be Multiplying, he and his willing <HI>Doxy</HI> never wait the Parsons Leisure, but take each others Word and so to Bed.</P>
<P>The Devil that furnishes others with his <HI>Tare</HI> but by Retail, deals with the Quaker by Whole sale, so many <HI>Heresies</HI> Club to his Generation that 'tis Impossible to say which he Resembles most. Sure Satan had a Fancy to present the World with an <HI>Oglio,</HI> and therefore here hath Rendevouzed all his Hell bred Errours in <HI>Epitomie,</HI> and set down a Catalogue of them in <HI>Short-hand.</HI></P>
<P>By his obstinate Zeal to keep his Noddle cover∣ed, you may guess him a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> that resents nothing so Dishonourable as a bare Head; and in∣deed he hath no more Christinaity in him than a <HI>Turk:</HI> His <HI>Good Fryday Looks</HI> speak him a supersti∣tious <HI>Anchorite;</HI> his Subtlety and Equivocations would become a <HI>Jesuite;</HI> he Names his Children with as little Ceremony as other Folks do their <HI>Whelps;</HI> and so far kees pace with the <HI>Anabaptist,</HI> but of a sudden he out-strips them, and falls in with the Seekers to deny all Ordinances. From <HI>Socinus</HI> he steals Arguments against the blessed <HI>Trinity,</HI> and learns to disown all Government from <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden.</HI> At first he was much a∣gainst the <HI>Carnal-Weapon,</HI> but now begins to be Reconciled to Fighting, and if you Anger him will rather venture a <HI>Rubbers at fity Cuffs,</HI> then
<PB REF="7"/>
turn the other Cheek to the Smiter. He has of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate so far fallen from his first pretence of Humillity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he out strips Handsom <HI>Fielding,</HI> or any <HI>Play∣house Bully</HI> for Wig and Vanity.</P>
<P>'Tis a prudent Maxime in the Art Military, never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o think too Contemptibly of an Enemy. Our Grandfathers saw that <HI>Scotch-mist Presbytery</HI> rising to bigger then a Mans Hand, and yet how Dismal∣ly did it in few Years over-spread our whole <HI>Ho∣rison.</HI></P>
<P>Consider but this <HI>Quaking Gang</HI> in it's true Di∣mensions, and the Arts they have to promote their Designs, and they will appear more formidable then most of the other Eactions.</P>
<P>For First, They are a People generally Subtle, Frugal, Industrious, and Wary in their Dealing; by which and their large Pretensions to a punctual Honesty, they have Ingrossed a grand part of the Nations Trade.</P>
<P>Secondly, Whereas other Perswasions are di∣vided into distinct Congregations, and so have se∣veral particular TEACHERS, who frequent∣ly Broaching different Whimseys, Mince them into <HI>subdivisions,</HI> whilst some dare not hear <HI>such an one,</HI> and others scruple to Communicate with <HI>such a one,</HI> though all of a PARTY.</P>
<P>The QUAKERS on the contrary; though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o two of them scarce agree in all things, doe yet generally throughout <HI>England</HI> keep themselves up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>one intire Body,</HI> glewed together with a strict Unity, as to <HI>Affection,</HI> and <HI>Correspondence,</HI> as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vident by their <HI>Weekly Collections</HI> in every Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y continually sent up to <HI>London</HI> where their
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
common Stock cannot but in so many Years as they have Maintained it, be very vast. To which add the exact Accompt and <HI>Registry</HI> they every where keep of all their Births and Burials (which are likewise duely Transmitted up) so that in an Instant they are able to give a near Estimate of their Number and Strength in all the three Nati∣ons. These and some other <HI>Importants</HI> being due∣ly weighed, render this <HI>shivering Sect</HI> not so in considerable as the common <HI>Rabble</HI> Deluded with their specious Pretences are apt to think them. 'Tis a good Caution of a Minor Poet,</P>
<LG>
<L>As white Powder discharges without Noise,</L>
<L>So may Saint-seeming Hypocrites Destroys,</L>
<L>Trust not too far, the soft Hand sometimes Smites</L>
<L>And Larks are Birds of Prey as well as Kites.</L>
</LG>
<P>To conclude, a <HI>Quaker</HI> is a canting thing that Cozens the World by the Purity of his Cloaths, a few <HI>Close-stool Faces</HI> and whineing Expressions, his Life is only a real Lye, his Doctrine contrary to all sober Religon, and withal so Troublesome that I am grown quite Weary of drawing his Character and cannot but wish him and all his Tribe fairly Embarqu'd for <HI>terra Incognita,</HI> of the late found <HI>Isle of Pines,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Penn</HI> their high <HI>Admiral.</HI></P>
