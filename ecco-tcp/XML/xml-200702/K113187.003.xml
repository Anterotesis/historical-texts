<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GESTA ROMANORUM.</HEAD>
<P>TALES are the learning of a rude age. In the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>og<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of letters, speculation and enquiry commence with re∣finement of manners. Literature becomes sentimental and discursive, in proportion as a people is polished: and men must be instructed by facts, either real or imaginary, before they can apprehend the subtleties of argument, and the force of ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection.</P>
<P>Vincent of Beauvais, a learned Dominican of France, who flou∣rished in the thirteenth century, observes in his MIRROR of HISTORY, that it was a practice of the preachers of his age, to rouse the indifference and relieve the languor of their hearers, by quoting the fables of Esop: yet, at the same time, he re∣commends a sparing and prudent application of these profane fancies in the discussion of sacred subjects <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">SPECUL. HIST. Lib. iii. c. viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol. 31. b. edit. Ven. 1591.</NOTE>. Among the Harleian
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/>
manuscripts in the British Museum we find a very antient collection of two hundred and fifteen stories, romantic, allegorical, religious, and legendary, which were evidently compiled by a professed preacher, for the use of monastic societies. Some of these ap∣pear to have been committed to writing from the recitals of bards and minstrels: others to have been invented and written by troubadours and monks <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 463. membran. fol.</NOTE>. In the year 1389, a grand system of divinity appeared at Paris, afterwards translated by Caxton under the title of the COURT OF SAPYENCE, which abounds with a multitude of historical examples, parables, and apologues; and which the writer wisely supposes, to be much more likely to interest the attention and excite the devotion of the people, than the authority of science, and the parade of theology. In consequence of the expediency of this mode of of instruction, the Legends of the Saints were received into the ritual, and rehearsed in the course of public worship. For religious romances were nearly allied to songs of chivalry; and the same gross ignorance of the people, which in the early centuries of christianity created a necessity of introducing the visible pomp of theatrical ceremonies into the churches, was taught the duties of devotion, by being amused with the achieve∣ments of spiritual knight-errantry, and impressed with the ex∣amples of pious heroism. In more cultivated periods, the DECA∣MERON of Boccace, and other books of that kind, ought to be considered as the remnant of a species of writing which was founded on the simplicity of mankind, and was adapted to the exigencies of the infancy of society.</P>

But among the antient story-books of this character, a Latin compilation entitled GESTA ROMANORUM seems to have been the favorite.</P>
<P>This piece has been before incidentally noticed: but as it operated powerfully on the general body of our old poetry, affording a variety of inventions not only to Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate, but to their distant successors, I have judged it of sufficient importance to be examined at large in a separate disser∣tation: which has been designedly reserved for this place, for the purpose both of recapitulation and illustration, and of giving the reader a more commodious opportunity of surveying at leisure, from this intermediate point of view, and under one comprehensive detail, a connected display of the materials and original subjects of many of our past and future poets.</P>
<P>Indeed, in the times with which we are now about to be con∣cerned, it seems to have been growing more into esteem. At the commencement of typography, Wynkyn de Worde pub∣lished this book in English. This translation wasre printed, by one Robinson, in 1577. And afterwards, of the same transla∣tion there were six impressions before the year 1601 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 18. seq.</NOTE>. There is an edition in black letter so late as the year 1689. About the year 1596, an English version appeared of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Epitomes des cent HISTOIRES TRAGIQUES, partie extraictes des ACTES DE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ROMAINS et autres, &amp;c."</Q> From the popularity, or rather familiarity, of this work in the reign of queen Elisabeth, the title of GESTA GRAYORUM was affixed to the history of the acts of the Christmas Prince at Grays-inn, in 1594 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Printed, or reprinted, in 1688. 4to.</NOTE>. In Sir GILES GOOSECAP, an anonymous comedy, presented by the Children of the Chapel in the year 1606, we have, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then for your lordship's quips and quick jests, why GESTA RO∣MANORUM were nothing to them <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lond. Printed for John Windet. 1606. 4to.</NOTE>."</Q> And in George Chap∣man's MAY-DAY, a comedy, printed at London in 1611, a man of the highest literary taste for the pieces in vogue is characterised,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
"One that has read Marcus Aurelius, GESTA RO∣MANORUM, the Mirrour of Magistrates, &amp;c.—to be led by the nose like a blind beare that has read nothing <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Act iii. pag. 39.</NOTE>!"</Q> The critics and collectors in black-letter, I believe, could produce many other proofs.</P>
<P>The GESTA ROMANORUM were first printed without date, but as it is supposed before or about the year 1473, in folio, with this title, <HI>Incipiunt</HI> HISTORIE NOTABILES <HI>collecte ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <HI>et quibusdam aliis libris cum applicationibus eorundem</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Much the same title occurs to a ma∣nuscript of this work in the Vatican, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Historiae Notabiles collectae ex Gestis Romanorum et quibusdam aliis libris cum explicationibus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orundem."</Q> Mont∣fauc. Bibl. MANUSCR. tom. i. pag. 17. Num. 172.</NOTE>. This edition has one hundred and fifty-two chapters, or GESTS, and one hundred and seventeen leaves <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Without initials, paging, signatures, or catch-words.</NOTE>. It is in the Gothic letter, and in two columns. The first chapter is of king Pompey, and the last of prince, or king, Cleonicus. The initials are written in red and blue ink.

The reverend and learned doctor Farmer, master of Emanuel college in Cambridge, has the second edition, as it seems, printed at Louvain, in quarto, the same or the subse∣quent year, by John de Westfalia, under the title, <HI>Ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM HISTORIE NOTABILES <HI>de viciis virtutibusque tractantes cum applicationibus moralisatis et mysticis.</HI> And with this colophon, GESTA ROMANORUM <HI>cum quibusdam aliis</HI> HIS∣TORIIS <HI>eisdem annexis</HI> ad MORALITATES <HI>dilucide redacta hic finem habent.

The la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is entitled De ADUL∣TERIO.</NOTE>. That is, twenty-nine more than are contained in the former edition: the first of the addi∣tional chapters being the story of Antiochus, or the substance of the romance of APOLLONIUS of TYRE. The initials are inserted
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>

Another followed soon afterwards, in quarto, <HI>Ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <HI>Historie notabiles moralizatae,</HI> per <HI>Gi∣rardum Lieu,</HI> GOUDAE, 1480. The next edition, with the use of which I have been politely favoured by George Mason esquire, of Aldenham-Lodge in Hertfordshire, was printed in folio, and in the year 1488, with this title, GESTA RHOMA∣NORUM <HI>cum Applicationibus moralisatis et misticis.</HI> The colophon is, <HI>Ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <HI>cum pluribus applicatis Historiis de virtutibus et viciis mystice ad intellectum transsumptis Recollectorii finis. Anno nre salutis</HI> MCCCCLXXX viij <HI>kalendas vero februarii</HI> xviij. A general, and alphabetical, table, are subjoined. The book, which is printed in two columns, and in the Gothic cha∣racter, abounding with abbreviations, contains ninety-three leaves. The initials are written or flourished in red and blue, and all the capitals in the body of the text are miniated with a pen. There were many other later editions <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">For which see supr. vol. ii. p. 15.</NOTE>. I must add, that the GESTA ROMANORUM were translated into Dutch, so early as the year 1484. There is an old French version in the British Museum.</P>
<P>This work is compiled from the obsolete Latin chronicles of the later Roman or rather German story, heightened by roman∣tic inventions, from Legends of the Saints, oriental apologues, and many of the shorter fictitious narratives which came into Europe with the Arabian literature, and were familiar in the ages of ignorance and imagination. The classics are sometimes cited for authorities; but these are of the lower order, such as Valerius Maximus, Macrobius, Aulus Gallius, Seneca, Pliny, and Boethius. To every tale a MORALISATION is subjoined, reducing it into a christian or moral lesson.</P>
<P>Most of the oriental apologues are taken from the CLERICA∣LIS DISCIPLINA, or a latin Dialogue between an Arabian Philo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opher
<PB N="vi" REF="13"/>

Some are also borrowed from an old Latin translation of the CALILAH U DAMNAH, a celebrated sett of eastern fables, to which Alphonsus was indebted.</P>
<P>On the whole, this is the collection in which a curious enquirer might expect to find the original of Chaucer's Cam∣buscan:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>Our author frequently cites GESTA ROMANORUM, the title of his own work. By which I understand no particular book of that name, but the Roman History in general. Thus in the title of the SAINT ALBANS CHRONICLE, printed by Caxton, <HI>Titus Livyus</HI> de GESTIS ROMANORUM is recited. In the year 1544, Lucius Florus was printed at Paris under the same title <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Apud Vascosan. 4to.</NOTE>. In the British Museum we find <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"LES FAIS DE ROMAINS jusques a la <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in de l' empire Domician, selon Orose, Justin, Lucan, &amp;c."</Q> A plain historical deduction <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">MSS. RE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 20 C i.</NOTE>. The ROMULEON, an old manuscript history of Rome from the foundation of the city to Constantine the Great, is also called de GESTIS ROMANORUM. This manuscript occurs both in Latin and French: and a French copy, among the royal man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scripts,
<PB N="vii" REF="14"/>
has the title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ROMULEON, ou des FAIS DE RO∣MAINS <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">MS. 19 E. v.</NOTE>."</Q> Among the manuscript books written by Lapus de Castellione, a Florentine civilian, who flourished about the year 1350, there is one, <HI>De Origine</HI> URBIS ROMAE <HI>et de</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 19.</NOTE>. Gower, in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, often introduces Roman stories with the Latin preamble, <HI>Hic secundum</HI> GESTA. Where he certainly means the Roman History, which by degrees had acquired simply the appellation of GESTA. Herman Korner, in his CHRONICA NOVELLA, written about the year 1438, refers for his vouchers to Bede, Orosius, Vale∣rius Maximus, Josephus, Eusebius, and the <HI>Chronicon</HI> et GESTA ROMANORUM. Most probably, to say no more, by the CHRO∣NICON he means the later writers of the Roman affairs, such as Isidore and the monkish compilers; and by GESTA the antient Roman history, as related by Livy and the more established Latin historians.</P>
<P>Neither is it possible that this work could have been brought as a proof or authority, by any serious annalist, for the Roman story.</P>
<P>For though it bears the title of GESTA ROMANORUM, yet this title by no means properly corresponds with the contents of the collection: which, as has been already hinted, comprehends a multitude of narratives, either not historical; or, in another respect, such as are either totally unconnected with the Roman people, or perhaps the most preposterous misrepresentations of their history. To cover this deviation from the promised plan, which, by introducing a more ample variety of matter, has contributed to encrease the reader's entertainment, our col∣lector has taken care to preface almost every story with the name or reign of a Roman emperor; who, at the same time, is often a monarch that never existed, and who seldom, whether real or suppositious, has any concern with the circumstances of the narrative. </P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="15"/>
But I hasten to exhibit a compendious analysis of the chap∣ters which form this very singular compilation: intermixing occasional illustrations arising from the subject, and shortening or lengthening my abridgement of the stories, in proportion as I judge they are likely to interest the reader. Where, for that reason, I have been very concise, I have yet said enough to direct the critical antiquarian to this collection, in case he should find a similar tale occurring in any of our old poets. I have omitted the mention of a very few chapters, which were beneath notice. Sometimes, where common authors are quoted, I have only mentioned the author's name, without specifying the substance of the quotation. For it was necessary that the reader should be made acquainted with our collector's track of reading, and the books which he used. In the mean time, this review will serve as a full notification of the edition of 1488, which is more comprehensive and complete than some others of later publication, and to which all the rest, as to a general criterion, may be now comparatively referred.</P>
<P>CHAP. i. Of a daughter of king Pompey, whose chamber was guarded by five armed knights and a dog. Being permitted to be present at a public shew, she is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educed by a duke, who is afterwards killed by the champion of her father's court. She is reconciled to her father, and betrothed to a nobleman: on which occasion, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> receives from her father an embroidered robe and a crown of gold, from the champion a gold ring, ano∣ther from the wise man who pacified the king's anger, another from the king's son, another from her cousin, and from her spouse a seal of gold. All these presents are inscribed with pro∣verbial sentences, suitable to the circumstances of the princess.</P>
<P>The latter part of this story is evidently oriental. The feudal manners, in a book which professes to record the achievements of the Roman people, are remarkable in the introductory cir∣cumstances. But of this mixture we shall see many striking instances.</P>

daughter falls in love with him; and having procured his escape, accompanies him to his own country, where they are married.</P>
<P>CHAP. vi. An emperor is married to a beautiful young prin∣cess. In case of death, they mutually agree not to survive one other. To try the truth of his wife, the emperor going into a distant country, orders a report of his death to be circulated. In remembrance of her vow, and in imitation of the wives of India, she prepares to throw herself headlong from a high pre∣cipice. She is prevented by her father; who interposes his pa∣ternal authority, as predominating over a rash and unlawful promise.</P>
<P>CHAP. vii. Under the reign of Dioclesian, a noble knight had two sons, the youngest of which marries a harlot.</P>
<P>This story, but with a difference of circumstances, ends like the beautiful apologue of the Prodigal Son.</P>
<P>CHAP. viii. The emperor Leo commands three female sta∣tues to be made. One has a gold ring on a finger pointing for∣ward, another a beard of gold, and the third a golden cloak and purple tunic. Whoever steals any of these ornaments, is to be punished with an ignominious death.</P>
<P>This story is copied by Gower, in the CONFESSIO AMAN∣TIS: but he has altered some of the circumstances. He sup∣poses a statue of Apollo.</P>

<P>CHAP. x. Vespasian marries a wife in a distant country, who refuses to return home with him, and yet declares she will kill herself if he goes. The emperor ordered two rings to be made, of a wonderous efficacy; one of which, in the stone, has the image of Oblivion, the other the image of Memory: the ring of Oblivion he gave to the empress, and returned home with the ring of Memory.</P>
<P>CHAP. xi. The queen of the south sends her daughter to king Alexander, to be his concubine. She was exceedingly beautiful, but had been nourished with poison from her birth. Alexander's master, Aristotle, whose sagacity nothing could escape, knowing this, entreated, that before she was admitted to the king's bed, a malefactor condemned to death might be sent for, who should give her a kiss in the presence of the king. The malefactor, on kissing her, instantly dropped down dead. Aristotle, having explained his reasons for what he had done, was loaded with honours by the king, and the princess was dismissed to her mother.</P>
<P>This story is founded on the twenty-eighth chapter of Aris∣totle's SECRETUM SECRETORUM: in which, a queen of India is said to have treacherously sent to Alexander, among other costly presents, the pretended testimonies of her friendship, a girl of exquisite beauty, who having been fed with serpents from her infancy, partook of their nature <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><P>[See supr. vol. i. p. 132.] This I now cite from a Latin translation, without date, but evidently printed before 1500.

<P>CHAP. xiii. An empress having lost her husband, becomes so doatingly fond of her only son, then three years of age, as not to bear his absence for a moment. They sleep together every night, and when he was eighteen years of age, she proves with child by him. She murthers the infant, and her left hand is immediately marked with four circles of blood. Her repentance is related, in consequence of a vision of the holy virgin.</P>

<P>CHAP. xv. Eufemian, a nobleman in the court of the em∣peror of Rome, is attended by three thousand servants girt with golden belts, and cloathed in silken vestments. His house was crouded with pilgrims, orphans, and widows, for whom three tables were kept every day. He has a son, Allexius; who quits his father's palace, and lives unknown seventeen years in a monastery in Syria. He then returns, and lives seventeen years undiscovered as a pilgrim in his father's family, where he suf∣fers many indignities from the servants.</P>
<P>Allexius, or Alexis, was canonised. This story is taken from his Legend <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Caxton, GOLD. LEG. f. ccclxiii. b.</NOTE>.

<P>CHAP. xvii. A poor man named Guido, engages to serve an emperor of Rome in six several capacities, or employments. One of these services is, to shew the best way to the holy land. Acquitting himself in all with singular address and fidelity, he is made a knight, and loaded with riches.</P>
<P>CHAP. xviii. A knight named Julian is hunting a stag, who turns and says, <Q REND="inline">"you will kill your father and mother."</Q> On this he went into a distant country, where he married a rich Lady of a castle. Julian's father and mother travelled into va∣rious lands to find their son, and at length accidentally came to this castle, in his absence; where telling their story to the lady, who had heard it from her husband, she discovered who they were, and gave them her own bed to sleep in. Early in the morning, while she was at mass in the chapel, her husband Julian unexpectedly returned; and entering his wife's chamber, perceived two persons in the bed, whom he immediately slew with his sword, hastily supposing them to be his wife and her adulterer. At leaving the chamber, he met his wife coming from the cha∣pel; and with great astonishment asked her, who the persons were sleeping in her bed? She answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are your parents, who have been seeking you so long, and whom I have honoured with a place in our own bed."</Q> Afterwards they founded a sumptuous hospital for the accommodation of travellers, on the banks of a dangerous river.</P>
<P>This story is told in Caxton's GOLDEN LEGENDE <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 90. edit. 1493.</NOTE>, and in

<P>I take this opportunity of observing, that the Legends of the the Saints, so frequently referred to in the GESTA ROMA∣NORUM, often contain high strokes of fancy, both in the structure and decorations of the story. That they should abound in extravagant conceptions, may be partly accounted for, from the superstitious and visionary cast of the writer: but the truth is, they derive this complexion from the east. Some were originally forged by monks of the Greek church, to whom the oriental fictions and mode of fabling were familiar. The more early of the Latin lives were carried over to Constantinople, where they were translated into Greek with new embellishments of eastern imagination. These being returned into Europe, were translated into Latin, where they naturally superseded the old Latin arche∣types. Others of the Latin lives contracted this tincture, from being written after the Arabian literature became common in Europe. The following ideas in the Life of Saint Pelagian
<PB N="xvi" REF="23"/>
evidently betray their original. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the bysshop sange masse in the cyte of Usanance, he saw thre dropes ryghte clere all of one gratenesse whiche were upon the aulter, and al thre ranne to gyder in to a precyous gemme: and whan they had set thys gemme in a crosse of golde, al the other precyous stones that were there, fyllen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fell out.</NOTE> out, and thys gemme was clere to them that were clene out of synne, and it was obscure and darke to synners <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Caxton's GOLD. LEG. f. ccclxxxxviii.</NOTE>, &amp;c."</Q> The peculiar cast of romantic inven∣tion was admirably suited to serve the purposes of superstition.</P>
<P>Possevin, a learned Jesuit, who wrote about the close of the sixteenth century, complains, that for the last five hundred years the courts of all the princes in Europe had been infatuated by reading romances: and that, in his time, it was a mark of in∣elegance, not to be familiarly acquainted with Lancelot du Lake, Perceforest, Tristan, Giron the Courteous, Amadis de Gaul, Primaleon, Boccace's Decameron, and Ariosto. He even goes so far as to say, that the devil instigated Luther to procure a transla∣tion of Amadis from Spanish into French, for the purpose of facilitating his grand scheme of overthrowing the catholic reli∣gion. The popularity of this book, he adds, warped the minds of the French nation from their antient notions and studies; introduced a neglect of the scriptures, and propagated a love for astrology, and other fantastic arts <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">BI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>LIOTH. SELECT. Lib. i. cap. 25. p. 113. edit. 1593.</NOTE>. But with the leave of this zealous catholic I would observe, that this sort of reading was likely to produce, if any, an effect quite contrary. The genius of romance and of popery was the same; and both were strengthened by the reciprocation of a similar spirit of cre∣dulity. The dragons and the castles of the one, were of a piece with the visions and pretended miracles of the other. The ridiculous theories of false and unsolid science, which, by the way, had been familiarised to the French by other ro∣mances, long before the translation of Amadis, were surely more likely to be advanced under the influence of a religion founded on
<PB N="xvii" REF="24"/>
deception, than in consequence of Luther's reformed system, which aimed at purity and truth, and which was to gain its end by the suppression of antient prejudices.</P>
<P>Many of the absurdities of the catholic worship were per∣haps, as I have hinted, in some degree necessary in the early ages of the church, on account of the ignorance of the people; at least, under such circumstances they were natural, and there∣fore excusable. But when the world became wiser, those mum∣meries should have been abolished, for the same reason that the preachers left off quoting Esop's fables in their sermons, and the stage ceased to instruct the people in the scripture-history by the representation of the MYSTERIES. The advocates of the pa∣pal communion do not consider, that in a cultivated age, abound∣ing with every species of knowledge, they continue to retain those fooleries which were calculated only for christians in a con∣dition of barbarism, and of which the use now no longer subsists.</P>
<P>CHAP. xix. When Julius Cesar was preparing to pass the Rubicon, a gigantic spectre appeared from the middle of the river, threatening to interrupt his passage, if he came not to establish the peace of Rome. Our author cites the GESTA ROMANORUM for this story.</P>
<P>It was impossible that the Roman history could pass through the dark ages, without being infected with many romantic cor∣ruptions. Indeed, the Roman was almost the only antient history, which the readers of those ages knew: and what re∣lated even to pagan Rome, the parent of the more modern papal metropolis of christianity, was regarded with a supersti∣tious veneration, and often magnified with miraculous additions.</P>

<P>I have observed that Caxton's GOLDEN LEGENDE is taken from Jacobus de Voragine. This perhaps is not precisely true. Caxton informs us in his first preface to the first edition of 1483 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Westminster. This is one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nest of Caxton's publications.</NOTE>, that he had in his possession a Legend in French, ano∣ther in Latin, and a third in English, which varied from the other two in many places: and that MANY HISTORIES were contained in the English collection, which did not occur in the French and Latin. Therefore, says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have wryton ON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> OUTE of the sayd three bookes: which I have orderyd other∣wyse than in the sayd <HI>Englysshe Legende,</HI> which was so to fore made."</Q> Caxton's English original might have been the old METRICAL LIVES OF THE SAINTS.</P>

<P>CHAP. xxvi. An emperor, visiting the holy land, commits his daughter and his favorite dog, who is very fierce, to the custody of five knights, under the superintendance of his sene∣shall. The seneshall neglects his charge: the knights are obliged to quit their post for want of necessaries; and the dog, being fed with the provisions assigned to the knights, grows fiercer, breaks his three chains, and kills the lady who was per∣mitted to wander at large in her father's hall.

<P>This, I think, is from the SECRETA SECRETORUM. Aris∣totle, for two reasons, was a popular character in the dark ages. He was the father of their philosophy: and had been the pre∣ceptor of Alexander the Great, one of the principal heroes of romance. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was Aristotle himself without his romantic history; in which he falls in love with a queen of Greece, who quickly confutes his subtlest syllogisms.</P>

<P>CHAP. xxxix. Julius Cesar's mediation between two brothers. From the GESTA ROMANORUM.</P>
<P>We must not forget, that there was the Romance of JULIUS CESAR. And I believe Antony and Cleopatra were more known characters in the dark ages, than is commonly supposed. Shakespeare is thought to have formed his play on this story from North's translation of Amyot's unauthentic French Plu∣tarch, published at London in 1579. Montfaucon, among the manuscripts of monsieur Lancelot, recites an old piece written about the year 1500, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"LA VIE ET FAIS DE MARC ANTOINE le triumvir et de sa mie CLEOPATRA, translatè de l' historien Plutarque pour tres illustre haute et puissante dame Madame Françoise de Fouez Dame de Châteaubriand <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bibl.

painting in glass, was a very different work: and, I believe, I can shew it was brought from Constantinople to Rome before the tenth century, with other ornamental arts. Guiccardini, who wrote about 1560, in his <HI>Descrittione de tutti Paesi Bassi,</HI> ascribes the invention of baking colours in glass for church∣windows to the Netherlanders <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Antw.

It is certain that this art owed much to the laborious and mechanical genius of the Germans; and, in particular, their deep researches and ex∣periments in chemistry, which they cultivated in the dark ages with the most indefatigable assiduity, must have greatly assisted its operations. I could give very early anecdotes of this art in England. But, with the careless haste of a lover, I am antici∣pating what I have to say of it in my HISTORY OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND.</P>

At supper, the nobleman placed the merchant next to his wife, who imme∣diately shewed evident tokens of being much struck with her beauty. The table was covered with the richest dainties; but while all were served in golden dishes, a pittance of meat was placed before the lady in a dish made out of a human scull. The merchant was surprised and terrified at this strange spec∣tacle. At length he was conducted to bed in a fair chamber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where, when left alone, he observed a glimmering lamp in a nook or corner of the room, by which he discovered two dead bodies hung up by the arms. He was now filled with the most horrible apprehensions, and could not sleep all the night. When he rose in the morning, he was asked by the nobleman how he liked his entertainment? He answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is plenty of every thing; but the scull prevented me from eating at sup∣per, and the two dead bodies which I saw in my chamber from sleeping. With your leave therefore I will depart."</Q> The nobleman answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My friend, you observed the beauty of my wife. The scull which you saw placed before her at supper, was the head of a duke, whom I detected in her embraces, and which I cut off with my own sword. As a memorial of her crime, and to teach her modest behaviour, her adulterer's scull is made to serve for her dish. The bodies of the two young men hanging in the chamber are my two kinsmen, who were murthered by the son of the duke. To keep up my sense of revenge for their blood, I visit their dead bodies every day. Go in peace, and remember to judge nothing without knowing the truth."</Q></P>

<P>CHAP. lxxx. A devout hermit lived in a cave, near which a shepherd folded his flock. Many of the sheep being stolen, the shepherd was unjustly killed by his master as being con∣cerned in the theft. The hermit seeing an innocent man put to death, began to suspect the existence of a divine Providence; and resolved no longer to perplex himself with the useless seve∣ties of religion, but to mix in the world. In travelling from his retirement, he was met by an angel in the figure of a man; who said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am an angel, and am sent by God to be your companion on the road."</Q> They entered a city; and begged for lodging at the house of a knight, who entertained them at a splendid supper. In the night, the angel rose from his bed, and strangled the knight's only child who was asleep in the
<PB N="xxix" REF="36"/>
cradle. The hermit was astonished at this barbarous return for so much hospitality, but was afraid to make any remonstrance to his companion. Next morning they went to another city. Here they were liberally received in the house of an opulent citizen; but in the night the angel rose, and stole a golden cup of inestimable value. The hermit now concluded, that his companion was a Bad Angel. In travelling forward the next morning, they passed over a bridge; about the middle of which they met a poor man, of whom the angel asked the way to the next city. Having received the desired information, the angel pushed the poor man into the water, where he was immediately drowned. In the evening they arrived at the house of a rich man; and begging for a lodging, were ordered to sleep in a shed with the cattle. In the morning the angel gave the rich man the cup which he had stolen. The hermit, amazed that the cup which was stolen from their friend and bene∣factor should be given to one who refused them a lodging, began to be now convinced that his companion was the devil; and begged to go on alone. But the angel said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hear me, and depart. When you lived in your hermitage a shepherd was killed by his master. He was innocent of the supposed offence: but had he not been then killed, he would have committed crimes in which he would have died impenitent. His master endeavours to atone for the murther, by dedicating the remainder of his days to alms and deeds of charity. I strangled the child of the knight. But know, that the father was so intent on heaping up riches for this child, as to ne∣glect those acts of public munificence for which he was be∣fore so distinguished, and to which he has now returned. I stole the golden cup of the hospitable citizen. But know, that from a life of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trictest temperance, he became, in consequence of possessing this cup, a perpetual drunkard; and is now the most abstemious of men. I threw the poor man into the water. He was then honest and religious. But know, had he walked one half of a mile further, he would
<PB N="xxx" REF="37"/>
have murthered a man in a state of mortal sin. I gave the golden cup to the rich man who refused to take us within his roof. He has therefore received his reward in this world; and in the next, will suffer the pains of hell for his inhospi∣tality."</Q> The hermit fell prostrate at the angel's feet; and re∣questing forgiveness, returned to his hermitage, fully convinced of the wisdom and justice of God's government.</P>
<P>This is the fable of Parnell's HERMIT, which that elegant yet original writer has heightened with many masterly touches of poetical colouring, and a happier arrangement of circum∣stances. Among other proofs which might be mentioned of Parnell's genius and address in treating this subject, by reserving the discovery of the angel to a critical period at the close of the fable, he has found means to introduce a beautiful description, and an interesting surprise. In this poem, the last instance of the angel's seeming injustice, is that of pushing the guide from the bridge into the river. At this, the hermit is unable to suppress his indignation.</P>

For what is the reason we are so much pleased with the reading romances and the fictions of the poets, but that here, as Aristotle says, things are set down as they should be; but in the true history hitherto of the world, things are recorded indeed as they are, but it is but a testi∣mony, that they have not been as they should be? Where∣fore, in the upshot of all, when we shall see that come to pass, that so mightily pleases us in the reading the most ingenious plays and heroick poems, that long afflicted vertue at last comes to the crown, the mouth of all unbelievers must be for ever stopped. And for my own part, I doubt not but that it will so come to pass in the close of the world. But impatiently to call for vengeance upon every enormity before that time, is rudely to overturn the stage before the entrance into the fifth act, out of ignorance of the plot of the comedy; and to prevent the solemnity of the general judgement by more paltry and particular executions <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 335.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

CHAP. ci. Of Ganterus, who for his prowess in war being elected a king of a certain country, is on the night of his coro∣nation conducted to a chamber, where at the head of the bed is a fierce lion, at the feet a dragon, and on either side a bear, toads, and serpents. He immediately quitted his new kingdom; and was quickly elected king of another country. Going to rest the first night, he was led into a chamber furnished with a bed richly embroidered, but stuck all over with sharp razors. This kingdom he also relinquishes. At length he meets a hermit, who gives him a staff, with which he is directed to knock at the gate of a magnificent palace, seated on a lofty mountain. Here he gains admittance, and finds every sort of happiness unembittered with the laest degree of pain.</P>
<P>The king means every man advanced to riches and honour, and who thinks to enjoy these advantages without interruption and alloy. The hermit is religion, the staff penitence, and the palace heaven.</P>
<P>In a more confined sense, the first part of this apologue may be separately interpreted to signify, that a king, when he enters on his important charge, ought not to suppose himself to succeed to the privilege of an exemption from care, and to be put into immediate possession of the highest pleasures, conveniencies, and felicities of life; but to be sensible, that from that moment, he begins to encounter the greatest dangers and difficulties.</P>

<P>The learned reader must immediately recollect a similar story of one Androclus, who being exposed to fight with wild beasts in the Roman amphitheatre, is recognised and unattacked by a most savage lion, whom he had formerly healed exactly in the same manner. But I believe the whole is nothing more than an oriental apologue on gratitude, written much earlier; and that it here exists in its original state. Androclus's story is related by Aulus Gellius, on the authority of a Greek writer, one Ap∣pion, called Plistonices, who flourished under Tiberius.

But the two writers agree only in the general subject. Our compiler's narrative has much more simplicity than that of Gellius; and contains marks of eastern manners and life. Let me add, that the oriental fabulists are fond of illustrating and enforcing the duty of gratitude, by feigning instances of the gratitude of beasts towards men. And of this the present compilation, which is strongly tinctured with orientalism, affords several other proofs.</P>
<P>CHAP. cv. Theodosius the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d emperor ordained, that the cause of every injured person should be heard, on ringing a bell placed in a public part of his palace. A serpent had a nest near the spot where the bell-rope fell. In the absence of the serpent, a toad took possession of her nest. The serpent twisting herself round the rope, rang the bell for justice; and by the emperor's special command the toad was killed. A few days afterwards, as the king was reposing on his couch, the serpent entered the chamber, bearing a precious stone in her mouth. The serpent creeping up to the emperor's face, laid the precious stone on his eyes, and glided out of the apartment. Immediately the em∣peror was restored to his sight.</P>
<P>This circumstance of the Bell of Justice occurs in the real history of some eastern monarch, whose name I have forgot.</P>

In the Arabian philosophy, serpents, either from the bright∣ness of their eyes, or because they inhabit the cavities of the earth, were considered as having a natural, or occult, connection with precious stones. In Alphonsus's CLERICALIS DISCI∣PLINA, a snake is mentioned, whose eyes were real jacinths. In Alexander's romantic history, he is said to have found ser∣pents in the vale of Jordian, with collars of huge emeralds growing on their necks <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vincent Beauvais, SPECUL. HIST. Lib. iv. c. 58. fol. 42. a.</NOTE>.

<P>CHAP. cvii. There was an image in the city of Rome, which stretched forth its right hand, on the middle finger of which was written STRIKE HERE. For a long time none could un∣derstand the meaning of this mysterious inscription. At length a certain subtle Clerk, who came to see this famous image, ob∣served, as the sun shone against it, the shadow of the inscribed finger on the ground at some distance. He immediately took a spade, and began to dig exactly on that spot. He came at length to a flight of steps which descended far under ground, and led him to a stately palace. Here he entered a hall, where he saw a king and queen sitting at table, with their nobles and a multitude of people, all clothed in rich garments. But no per∣son spake a word. He looked towards one corner, where he saw a polished carbuncle, which illuminated the whole room <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 229. So in the romance, or LAY, of SYR LAUNFAL. MSS.

with all that his wishes could desire.

<P>In the MORALISATION of this story, the steps by which the Clerk descends into the earth are supposed to be the Passions. The palace, so richly stored, is the world with all its vanities and temptations. The figure with the bow bent is Death, and the carbuncle is Human Life. He suffers for his avarice in coveting and seizing what was not his own; and no sooner has he taken the golden knife and cup, that is, enriched himself with the goods of this world, than he is delivered up to the gloom and horrors of the grave.</P>

<P>This story was originally invented of pope Gerbert, or Sylvester
<PB N="xlv" REF="52"/>
the second, who died in the year 1003. He was emi∣nently learned in the mathematical sciences, and on that ac∣count was styled a magician. William of Malmesbury is, I believe, the first writer now extant by whom it is recorded: and he produces it partly to shew, that Gerbert was not always successful in those attempts which he so frequently practised to discover treasures hid in the earth, by the application of the ne∣cromantic arts. I will translate Malmesbury's narration of this fable, as it varies in some of the circumstances, and has some heightenings of the fiction. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At Rome there was a brazen statue, extending the forefinger of the right hand; and on its forehead was written <HI>Strike here.</HI> Being suspected to conceal a treasure, it had received many bruises from the credulous and ignorant, in their endeavours to open it. At length Gerbert unriddled the mystery. At noon-day observing the reflection of the forefinger on the ground, he marked the spot. At night he came to the place, with a page carrying a lamp. There by a magical operation he opened a wide passage in the earth; through which they both descended, and came to a vast palace. The walls, the beams, and the whole structure, were of gold: they saw golden images of knights playing at chess, with a king and queen of gold at a banquet, with numerous attendants in gold, and cups of immense size and value. In a recess was a carbuncle, whose lustre illuminated the whole palace: opposite to which stood a figure with a bended bow. As they attempted to touch some of the rich furniture, all the golden images seemed to rush upon them. Gerbert was too wise to attempt this a second time: but the page was bold enough to snatch from the table a golden knife of ex∣quisite workmanship. At that moment, all the golden images rose up with a dreadful noise; the figure with the bow shot at the carbuncle; and a total darkness ensued. The page then replaced the knife, otherwise, they both would have suffered a cruel death."</Q> Malmesbury afterwards mentions a brazen bridge, framed by the enchantments of Gerbert, beyond which
<PB N="xlvi" REF="53"/>
were golden horses of a gigantic size, with riders of gold richly illuminated by the most serene meridian sun. A large company attempt to pass the bridge, with a design of stealing some pieces of the gold. Immediately the bridge rose from its foundations, and stood perpendicular on one end: a brazen man appeared from beneath it, who struck the water with a mace of brass, and the sky was overspread with the most horrible gloom. Gerbert, like some other learned necromancers of the Gothic ages, was supposed to have fabricated a brazen head under the influence of certain planets, which answered questions. But I forbear to suggest any more hints for a future collection of Ara∣bian tales. I shall only add Malmesbury's account of the educa∣tion of Gerbert, which is a curious illustration of what has been often inculcated in these volumes, concerning the introduc∣tion of romantic fiction into Europe <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See DISS. i. And vol. i. 400. seq.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gerbert, a native of France, went into Spain for the purpose of learning astrology, and other sciences of that cast, of the Saracens; who, to this day, occupy the upper regions of Spain. They are seated in the metropolis of Seville; where, according to the cus∣tomary practice of their country, they study the arts of divi∣nation and enchantment.—Here Gerbert soon exceeded Ptolemy in the astrolabe, Alchind in astronomy, and Julius Firmicus in fatality. Here he learned the meaning of the flight and language of birds, and was taught how to raise spectres from hell. Here he acquired whatever human cu∣riosity has discovered for the destruction or convenience of mankind. I say nothing of his knowledge in arithmetic, music, and geometry; which he so fully understood as to think them beneath his genius, and which he yet with great industry introduced into France, where they had been long forgotten. He certainly was the first who brought the algorithm from the Saracens, and who illustrated it with

<P>I conclude this chapter with a quotation from the old me∣trical romance of SYR LIBEAUX DIASCONIOS, where the knight, in his attempt to disenchant the Lady of Sinadone, after entering the hall of the castle of the necromancers, is almost in similar circumstances with our subterraneous adven∣turers.

<P>The story, however, as it stands in Gower, seems to be co∣pied from one which is told by the hermit Barlaam to king Avenamore, in the spiritual romance, written originally in Greek about the year 800, by Joannes Damascenus a Greek monk <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Joan.

And ibid. EM. and ADDIT. to pag. 342.</NOTE>. But Gower's imme∣diate author, if not Boccace, was perhaps Vincent of Beauvais, who wrote about the year 1290, and who has incorporated Damascenus's history of Barlaam and Josaphat <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">It is extant in Surius, and other col∣lections.</NOTE>, who were canonised, into his SPECULUM HISTORIALE <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">DE REGE AUEMUR, &amp;c. Lib. xiv. f. 196. Ven. 1591. It contains sixty-four chapters.</NOTE>. As Bar∣laam's fable is probably the remote but original source of Shakespeare's CASKETTS in the MERCHANT OF VENICE, I will give the reader a translation of the passage in which it occurs, from the Greek original, never yet printed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The king commanded four chests to be made: two of which were covered with gold, and secured by golden locks, but
<PB N="l" REF="57"/>
filled with the rotten bones of human carcasses. The other two were overlaid with pitch, and bound with rough cords; but replenished with pretious stones and the most exquisite gems, and with ointments of the richest odour. He called his nobles together; and placing these chests before them, asked which they thought the most valuable. They pronounced those with the golden coverings to be the most pretious, sup∣posing they were made to contain the crowns and girdles of the king <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">In doctor Johnson's abridgement of a tale like this from Boccace, which he sup∣poses to have been Shakespeare's original, the king says, that in one of the Caskets was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"contained his crown, sceptre and jewels, &amp;c."</Q> See Steeven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s SHAKE∣SPEARE, vol. iii. p. 255. edit. 1779.</NOTE>. The two chests covered with pitch they viewed with contempt. Then said the king, I presumed what would be your determination: for ye look with the eyes of sense. But to discern baseness or value, which are hid within, we must look with the eyes of the mind.

<P>This romantic legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, which is a history of considerable length, is undoubtedly the composition of one who had an intercourse with the east: and from the strong traces which it contains of the oriental mode of mora∣lising, appears plainly to have been written, if not by the monk whose name it bears, at least by some devout and learned ascetic of the Greek church, and probably before the tenth century.</P>

<P>The most curious anecdote of chivalry, now on record, oc∣curs in the ecclesiastical history of Spain. Alphonsus the ninth, about the year 1214, having expelled the Moors from Toledo, endeavoured to establish the Roman missal in the place of saint Isidore's. This alarming innovation was obstinately opposed by the people of Toledo; and the king found that his project would be attended with almost insuperable difficulties. The contest at length between the two missals grew so serious, that it was mutually resolved to decide the controversy, not by a theological disputation, but by single combat; in which the champion of the Toletan missal proved victorious <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the MOZARA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ES, or Missal of saint Isidore, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted at Toledo, by the command of Cardinal Ximenes, A.

<P>CHAP. cxvi. The queen of Pepin king of France died in childbed, leaving a son. He married a second wife, who bore

a son within a year. These children were sent abroad to be nursed. The surviving queen, anxious to see her child, desired that both the boys might be brought home. They were so exceedingly alike, that the one could not be distinguished from the other, except by the king. The mother begged the king to point out her own son. This he refused to do, till they were both grown up; left she should spoil him by too fond a partia∣lity.

<P>CHAP. cxix. A king had an oppressive Seneshall, who passing through a forest, fell into a deep pit, in which were a lion, an ape, and a serpent. A poor man who gathered sticks in the forest hearing his cries, drew him up: together with the lion, the ape, and the serpent. The Seneshall returned home, pro∣mising to reward the poor man with great riches. Soon after∣wards the poor man went to the palace to claim the promised reward; but was ordered to be cruelly beaten by the seneshall. In the mean time, the lion drove ten asses laden with gold to the poor man's cottage: the serpent brought him a pretious stone of three colours: and the ape, when he came to the forest on his daily business, laid him heaps of wood. The poor man, in consequence of the virtues of the serpent's pretious stone,
<PB N="lv" REF="62"/>
which he sold, arrived to the dignity of knighthood, and ac∣quired ample possessions. But afterwards he found the pretious stone in his chest, which he presented to the king. The king having heard the whole story, ordered the seneshall to be put to death for his ingratitude, and preferred the poor man to his office.</P>
<P>This story occurs in Symeon Seth's translation of the cele∣brated Arabian fable-book called CALILAH U DUMNAH <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 444. This work was translated into Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> under the title of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Donies MORALL PHILOSOPHIE, translated from the Indian tongue, 1570."</Q> Black Letter with woodden cuts. 4to.

MA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 179. Edit. Wats.</NOTE>. It is versified by Gower, who omits the lion, as Matthew Paris does the ape, in the fifth book of the CONFESSIO AMANTIS <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">fol. 110. b.</NOTE>. He thus describes the services of the ape and serpent to the poor man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who gained his livelihood by gathering sticks in a forest.</P>

<P>CHAP. XX. King Darius's legacy to his three sons. To the eldest he bequeathes all his paternal inheritance: to the second, all that he had acquired by conquest: and to the third, a ring and necklace, both of gold, and a rich cloth. All the three last gifts were endued with magical virtues. Whoever wore the ring on his finger, gained the love or favour of all whom he desired to please. Whoever hung the necklace over his breast, obtained all his heart could desire. Whoever sate down on the cloth, could be instantly transported to any part of the world which he chose.</P>
<P>From this beautiful tale, of which the opening only is here given, Occleve, commonly called Chaucer's disciple, framed a poem in the octave stanza, which was printed in the year 1614, by William Browne, in his set of Eclogues called the SHEP∣HEARDS PIPE.

The king replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go home, and you shall hear my answer to morrow."</Q> The king ordered his trumpeters to sound early the next morning before his brother's gate, and to bring him with them to judgement. The brother, on hearing this unexpected dreadful summons, was seized with horror, and came before the king in a black robe. The king commanded a deep pit to be made, and a chair composed of the most frail materials, and supported by four slight legs, to be placed in∣clining over the edge of the pit. In this the brother, being strip∣ped naked, was seated. Over his head a sharp sword was hung by a small thread of silk. Around him four men were stationed with swords exceedingly sharp, who were to wait for the king's word, and then to kill him. In the mean time, a table co∣vered with the most costly dishes was spread before him, ac∣companied with all sorts of music. Then said the king, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My brother, why are you so sad? Can you be dejected, in the midst of this delicious music, and with all these choice dainties?"</Q> He answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can I be glad, when I have this morning heard the trumpet of death at my doors, and while I am seated in this tottering chair? If I make the smallest mo∣tion, it will break, and I shall fall into the pit, from which I shall never arise again. If I lift my head, the suspended sword will penetrate my brain; while these four tormentors only wait your command to put me to death."</Q> The king replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now I will answer your question, why I was sad yesterday. I am exactly in your situation. I am seated, like you, in a frail and perishable chair, ready to tumble to pieces every moment, and to throw me into the infernal pit. Divine judgement, like this sharp sword, hangs over my head: and I am surrounded, like you, with four executioners. That before me is Death, whose coming I cannot tell; that behind me, my Sins, which are prepared to accuse me before the tribunal of God; that on the right, the Devil, who is ever watching for his prey; and that on the left, the Worm, who is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after my flesh.

Here is a traite of the private life of our ancestors, who wanted the diver∣sions and engagements of modern times to relieve a tedious even∣ing. Hence we learn, that when a company was assembled, if a
<PB N="lxv" REF="72"/>
jugler or a minstrel were not present, it was their custom to en∣tertain themselves by relating or hearing a series of adventures. Thus the general plan of the CANTERBURY TALES, which at first sight seems to be merely an ingenious invention of the poet to serve a particular occasion, is in great measure founded on a fashion of antient life: and Chaucer, in supposing each of the pilgrims to tell a tale as they are travelling to Becket's shrine, only makes them adopt a mode of amusement which was com∣mon to the conversations of his age. I do not deny, that Chaucer has shewn his address in the use and application of this practice.</P>
<P>So habitual was this amusement in the dark ages, that the graver sort thought it unsafe for ecclesiastics, if the subjects ad∣mitted any degree of levity. The following curious injunction was deemed necessary, in a code of statutes assigned to a college at Oxford in the year 1292. I give it in English. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"CH. xx.—The fellows shall all live honestly, as becomes Clerks.—They shall not rehearse, sing, nor willingly hear, BALLADS or TALES of LOVERS, which tend to lasciviousness and idle∣ness <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">CANTILENA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> VEL FABULAS DE AMA∣SIIS, &amp;c.

When a man begins to drink, he is meek and ignorant as the lamb, then becomes bold as the lion, his courage is soon trans∣formed into the foolishness of the ape, and at last he wallows in the mire like the sow.

<P>CHAP. clxviii. Barlaam is cited for the story of a man, who, flying from a unicorn, and falling into a deep and noisom pit, hung on the boughs of a lofty tree which grew from the bottom. On looking downward, he saw a huge dragon twisted round the trunk, and gaping to devour him. He also observed two mice gnawing at the roots of the tree, which began to totter. Four white vipers impregnated the air of the pit with their poisonous breath. Looking about him, he discovered a stream of hony distilling from one of the branches of the tree, which he began eagerly to devour, without regarding his dan∣gerous situation. The tree soon fell: he found himself strug∣gling in a loathsome quagmire, and was instantly swallowed by the dragon.</P>

<P>I take the liberty of introducing a small digression here, which refers to two pieces of the poet last-mentioned, never enume∣rated among his works. In the year 1483, Caxton printed at Westminster, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>The PYLGREMAGE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> OF THE SOWLE</HI> translated oute of Frensshe into Englisshe. Full of devout maters touching the sowle, and many questyons assoyled to cause a man to lyve the better, &amp;c. Emprinted at Westminster by William Caxton the first yere of kynge Edward <HI>V. 1483.</HI>"</Q> The French book, which is a vision, and has some degree of imagination, is probably the PELERIN DE L'AME, of Guillaume prior of Chaulis <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 120.</NOTE>. This translation was made from the French, with additions, in the year 1413. For in the colophon are these words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here endeth the dreme of the PYLGREMAGE OF THE SOWLE translated out of Frensche into Englisshe, with somwhat of Addicions, the yere of our lorde M. CCCC. and thyrteen, and endethe in the vigyle of seint Bartholomew."</Q> The translator of this book, at least the author of the <HI>Addicions,</HI> which altoge∣ther consist of poetry in seven-lined stanzas, I believe to be Lydgate. Not to insist on the correspondence of time and style, I observe, that the thirty-fourth chapter of Lydgate's metrical LIFE OF THE VIRGIN MARY is literally repeated in the thirty∣fourth chapter of this Translation. This chapter is a digression of five or six stanzas in praise of Chaucer; in which the writer feelingly laments the recent death of his <HI>maister Chaucer, poete of Britaine,</HI> who used to <HI>amende and correcte the wronge traces of my rude penne.</HI> No writer besides, in Lydgate's own life-time, can be supposed, with any sort of grace or propriety, to have men∣tioned those personal assistances of Chaucer, in Lydgate's own

And if we suppose that the Translation, or its <HI>Addicions,</HI> were written by Lydgate before he wrote his LIFE OF THE VIRGIN, the proof will be the same <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe mentions Lydgate's <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PIL∣GRIMAGE OF THE WORLD by the com∣maundement of the earle of Salisburie, 1426."</Q> But this must be a different work. Ad calc. Opp. Chauc. fol. 376, col. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another piece probably written by Lydgate, yet never sup∣posed or acknowledged to be of his composition, is a poem in the octave stanza, containing thirty-seven leaves in folio, and entitled LABEROUS AND MARVEYLOUS WORKE OF SAPIENCE. After a long debate between MERCY and TRUTH, and JUSTICE and PEACE, all the products of nature and of human know∣ledge are described, as they stand arranged in the palace and do∣minions of WISDOM. It is generally allowed to have been printed by Caxton: it has not the name of the printer, nor any date. Had it been written by Caxton, as I once hastily suspected, or by any of his cotemporaries, the name of Lydgate would have appeared in conjunction with those of Gower and Chaucer, who are highly celebrated in the Prologue as <HI>erthely gods expert in poesie:</HI> for these three writers were constantly joined in pane∣gyric, at least for a century, by their successors, as the distin∣guished triumvirate of English poetry. In the same Prologue, the author says he was commanded to write this poem by the king. No poet cotemporary with Caxton was of consequence enough to receive such a command: and we know that Lydgate compiled many of his works by the direction, or under the pa∣tronage, of king Henry the fifth. Lydgate was born in Suffolk: and our author from the circumstance of having lived in a part of England not of a very polished dialect, apologises for the rude∣ness of his language, so that he cannot <HI>delycately endyte.</HI> It is much in the style and manner of Lydgate: and I believe it to have been one of his early performances <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 194. I know not if this is the poem recited by Stowe and called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Courte of Sapience in hea∣ven for redemption of mankind."</Q> Ubi supr. col. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHAP. clxxii. A king of England has two knights, named
<PB N="lxxi" REF="78"/>
Guido and Tirius. Guido having achieved many splendid ex∣ploits for the love of a beautiful lady, at length married her. Three days after his marriage he saw a vision, which summoned him to engage in the holy war. At parting she gave him a ring; saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as often as you look on this ring, remember me."</Q> Soon after his departure she had a son. After various adventures, in which his friend Tirius has a share, at the end of seven years he returned to England in the habit of a pilgrim. Coming to his castle, he saw at the gate his lady sitting, and distributing alms to a croud of poor people; ordering them all to pray for the return of her lord Guido from the holy land. She was on that day accompanied by her son a little boy, very beautiful, and richly apparelled; and who hearing his mother, as she was distributing her alms, perpetually recommending Guido to their prayers, asked, if that was his father? Among others, she gave alms to her husband Guido, not knowing him in the pilgrim's disguise. Guido, seeing the little boy, took him in his arms, and kissed him: saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O my sweet son, may God give you grace to please him!"</Q> For this boldness he was reproved by the attendants. But the lady, finding him destitute and a stranger, assigned him a cottage in a neighbouring forest. Soon afterwards falling sick, he said to his servant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Carry this ring to your lady, and tell her, if she desires ever to see me again, to come hither without delay."</Q> The servant conveyed the ring; but before she arrived, he was dead. She threw her∣self on his body, and exclaimed with tears, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where are now my alms which I daily gave for my lord? I saw you receive those alms, but I knew you not.—You beheld, embraced, and kissed your own son, but did not discover yourself to him nor to me. What have I done, that I shall see you no more?"</Q> She then interred him magnificently.</P>
<P>The reader perceives this is the story of Guido, or Guy, earl of Warwick; and probably this is the early outline of the life and death of that renowned champion.</P>
<P>Many romances were at first little more than legends of devotion,
<PB N="lxxii" REF="79"/>
containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior. At length, as chivalry came more into vogue, and the stores of invention were increased, the youthful and active part of the pilgrim's life was also written, and a long series of imaginary martial adventures was added, in which his religious was eclipsed by his heroic character, and the penitent was lost in the knight-errant. That which was the principal subject of the short and simple legend, became only the remote catastrophe of the voluminous romance. And hence by degrees it was almost an established rule of every romance, for the knight to end his days in a hermitage. Cer∣vantes has ridiculed this circumstance with great pleasantry, where Don Quixote holds a grave debate with Sancho, whether he shall turn saint or archbishop.</P>
<P>So reciprocal, or rather so convertible, was the pious and the military character, that even some of the apostles had their ro∣mance. In the ninth century, the chivalrous and fabling spirit of the Spaniards transformed saint James into a knight. They pretended that he appeared and fought with irresistible fury, completely armed, and mounted on a stately white horse, in most of their engagements with the Moors; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cause, by his superior prowess in these bloody conflicts, he was supposed to have freed the Spaniards from paying the annual tribute of a hundred christian virgins to their infidel enemies, they repre∣sented him as a professed and powerful champion of distressed damsels. This apotheosis of chivalry in the person of their own apostle, must have ever afterwards contributed to exaggerate the characteristical romantic heroism of the Spaniards, by which it was occasioned; and to propagate through succeeding ages, a stronger veneration for that species of military enthusiasm, to which they were naturally devoted. It is certain, that in con∣sequence of these illustrious achievements in the Moorish wars, saint James was constituted patron of Spain; and became the founder of one of the most magnificent shrines, and of the most opulent order of knighthood, now existing in christendom.

The sixth and last book has seventeen fables ex <HI>tran∣slatione Rinucii,</HI> that is Rinucius, who translated Planudes's life of Esop, and sixty-nine of his fables, from Greek into Latin, in the fifteenth century.

In this age of curiosity, distinguished for its love of historical anecdotes and the investigation of antient manners, it is extraor∣dinary that a new translation should not be made of Froissart from a collated and corrected original of the French. Froissart is commonly ranked with romances: but it ought to be remem∣bered, that he is the historian of a romantic age, when those manners which form the fantastic books of chivalry were actually practised. As he received his multifarious intelligence from such a variety of vouchers, and of different nations, and almost al∣ways collected his knowledge of events from report, rather than from written or recorded evidence, his notices of persons and places are frequently confused and unexact. Many of these petty incorrectnesses are not, however, to be imputed to Froissart: and it may seem surprising, that there are not more inaccuracies of this kind in a voluminous chronicle, treating of the affairs of England, and abounding in English appellations, composed by a French∣man, and printed in France. Whoever will take the pains to compare this author with the coeval records in Rymer, will find numerous instances of his truth and integrity, in relating the more public and important transactions of his own times. Why he should not have been honoured with a modern edition at the Louvre, it is easy to conceive: the French have a national prejudice against a writer, who has been so much more com∣plaisant to England, than to their own country. Upon the whole, if Froissart should be neglected by the historical reader for his want of precision and authenticity, he will at least be valued by the philosopher for his striking pictures of life, drawn without reserve or affectation from real nature with a faithful and free pencil, and by one who had the best opportunities of obser∣vation, who was welcome alike to the feudal castle or the royal palace, and who mingled in the bustle and business of the world, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat very curious period of society, when manners are very far refined, and yet retain a considerable tincture of bar∣barism. But I cannot better express my sentiments on this sub∣ject, than in the words of Montaigne. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"J'ayme les Historien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Cesarius, I suppose, is a Cistercian monk of the thirteenth century; who, beside voluminous Lives, Chronicles, and Ho∣milies, wrote twelve Books on the Miracles, Visions, and Ex∣amples, of his own age. But there is another and an older monkish writer of the same name. In the British Museum, there is a narrative taken from Cesarius, in old northern English, of a lady deceived by the fiends, or the devil, through the pride of rich clothing <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">MSS.

But although the printed copies have one hundred and eighty-one stories or chapters, there are many in the manuscripts which do not appear in the editions.

<P>But I hasten to point out the writer of the GESTA ROMA∣NORUM, who has hitherto remained unknown to the most dili∣gent enquirers in Gothic literature. He is Petrus Berchorius, or Pierre Bercheur, a native of Poitou, and who died Prior of the Benedictine convent of saint Eloi at Paris, in the year 1362.</P>
<P>For the knowledge of this very curious circumstance, I am obliged to Salomon Glassius, a celebrated theologist of Saxe∣Gotha, in his PHILOLOGIA SACRA <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">PHILOLO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IAE SACRAE, qua totius sa∣crosanctae veteris et novi testamenti scrip∣turae tum stylus et literatura, tum sensus et genuinae interpretationis ratio expendi∣tur, Libri quinque, &amp;c. edit. tert.

In his chapter DE ALLEGORIIS FABULARUM, he censures those writers who affect to interpret allegorically, not only texts of scripture, but also poetical fables and profane histo∣ries, which they arbitrarily apply to the explication or confir∣mation of the mysteries of christianity. He adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hoc in studio excelluit quidam <HI>Petrus Berchorius,</HI> Pictaviensis, ordinis divi Benedicti: qui, <HI>peculiari</HI> libro, GESTA ROMANORUM, necnon Legendas Patrum, aliasque aniles fabulas, allegorice ac mystice exposuit <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">LIB. ii.

<P>Berchorius was one of the most learned divines of his country, and a voluminous writer. His three grand printed works are, I. REDUCTORIUM MORALE <HI>super totam Bibliam,</HI> in twenty∣four books. II. REPERTORIUM [or Reductorium] MORALE, in fourteen books <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">I use a folio edition of all these three works, in three volumes, printed at Ve∣nice in 1583.

The REDUCTORIUM SUPER BIBLIAM<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">This was first printed, Argentorat. 1473. fol.

The REPERTORIUM MORALE is a dictionary of things, persons, and places; all which are supposed to be mystical, and which are therefore explained in their moral or practical sense.

The moralisation, or moral explanation, which is added to every ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle, is commonly prefaced, as in the GESTA, with the introductory address of CARISSIMI. In the colophon, the GESTA is called <HI>Ex gestis Romanorum</HI> RECOLLECTORIUM: a word much of a piece with his other titles of REPERTORIUM and REDUCTORIUM.

As a further proof of his allegorising genius I must add, that he moralised all the stories in Ovid's Metamorphosis, in a work entitled, <HI>Commentarius</HI> MORALIS, <HI>five</HI> ALLEGORIAE <HI>in Libros quindecim Ovidii Metamorphoseon</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See what he says of the <HI>Fabulae Poe∣tarum,</HI> REPERTOR.

He seems to have been strongly impressed with whatever related to the Roman affairs, and to have thought their history more in∣teresting than that of any other people. This appears from the following passage, which I translate from the article ROMA, in his DICTIONARIUM MORALE, and which will also contri∣bute to throw some other lights on this subject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How many remarkable facts might be here collected concerning the vir∣tues and vices of the Romans, did my design permit me to drop Moralities, and to enter upon an historical detail!

It is remarkable, that a copy of this manuscript in the British Mu∣seum is entitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"TITUS LIVIUS Des FAIS DES ROMAINS translate par Pierre Bertheure."</Q> MSS.

But because I do not mean to treat of historical affairs in the present work, the matter of which is entirely moral, I refer the historical reader to Livy himself, to Trogus Pom∣peius, Justin, Florus, and Orosius, who have all written his∣tories of Rome; as also to Innocent, who in his book on the <HI>Miseries of human nature</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Pope Innocent the third, about the year 1200, wrote three Books <HI>De Contemptu Mundi, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive De Miseria humanae Conditionis,</HI> printed, Colon. 1496.</NOTE>, speaks largely of the vices of the Romans <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">DICTION.

The king himself, as we have just seen, recommended a translation of Livy. French translations also of Sallust, Cesar, and Lucan, were now circu∣lated. A Latin historical compilation called ROMULEON was now just published by a gentleman of France, which was soon afterwards translated into French. A collection of the GESTA ROMANORUM was therefore a popular subject, at least it pro∣duced a popular title, and was dictated by the fashion of the times.</P>
<P>I have here mentioned all Berchorius's works, except his Comment on a Prosody called <HI>Doctrinale metricum,</HI> which was
<PB N="xc" REF="97"/>
used as a school-book in France, till Despauterius's manual on that subject appeared <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Oudin, ubi supr.</NOTE>. Some biographers mention his TROPO∣LOGIA, his COSMOGRAPHIA, and his BREVIARIUM. But the TROPOLOGIA<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">I have seen a very old black-letter edition with the title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tropologiarum mysticarumque enarrationum, &amp;c."</Q> Without date.</NOTE> is nothing more than his REDUCTORIUM on the Bible; and probably the BREVLARIUM is the same <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">But see Bibl.

The COSMOGRAPHIA seems to be the fourteenth book of his RE∣PERTORIUM MORALE; which treats of the wonders of various countries, and is chiefly taken from Solinus and Gervase of Til∣bury <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is in some measure hinted by Oudin, ubi supr. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Egressus autem a PRO∣FANIS et grammaticis Berchorius, ani∣mum SOLIDIORIBUS applicuit, &amp;c."</Q></NOTE>. He is said by the biographers to have written other smaller pieces, which they have not named or described. Among these perhaps is comprehended the GESTA: which we may conceive to have been thus undistinguished, either as having been neglected or proscribed by graver writers, or rather as having been probably disclaimed by its author, who saw it at length in the light of a juvenile performance, abounding in fantastic and unedifying narrations, which he judged unsuitable to his character, studies, and station <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gesner adds, reciting his works, that he wrote <Q REND="inline">"alia multa."</Q> EPITOM.

It is in the Epistle dedica∣tory of his edition of the Chronicles of Marianus Scotus, and Martinus Polonus, addressed to our queen Elisabeth; in which he promises to publish many Latin CHRONICA, that is, those of Godfrey of Viterbo, Hugo Floriacensis, Conrade Engelhus, Hermannus Edituus, Lanfranc, Ivo, Robert of Saint Victor, PETER BERCHORIUS, and of many others, <HI>qui de</HI> TEMPORI∣BUS <HI>scripserunt,</HI> who have written of times <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dat. 1559.

<P>Had other authentic evidences been wanting, we are sure of the age in which Berchorius flourished, from the circumstance of his being employed to translate Livy by John king of France, who acceded to the throne in the year 1350, and died in the year 1364. That Berchorius died, and probably an old man, in the year 1362, we learn from his epitaph in the monastery of saint Eloy at Paris, which is recited by Sweertius, and on other accounts deserves a place here.</P>

Berchorius was constituted grammatical preceptor to the no∣vices of the Benedictine Congregation, or monastery, at Clugni, in the year 1340 <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Oudin. ubi supr. p. 1063.</NOTE>. At which time he drew up his Notes on the Prosody, and his Commentary on Ovid, for the use of his scho∣lars. About the same time, and with a view of rendering their exercises in Latinity more agreeable and easy by an enter∣taining Latin story-book, yet resoluble into lessons of religion, he probably compiled the GESTA: perpetually addressing the application of every tale to his young audience, by the paternal and affectionate appellation of CARISSIMI <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This, by habit, and otherwise with no impropriety, he seems to have retained in his later and larger works.</NOTE>. There was there∣fore time enough for the GESTA to become a fashionable book of tales, before Boccace published his DECAMERON. The action of the DECAMERON being supposed in 1348, the year of the great pestilence, we may safely conjecture, that Boccace did not begin his work till after that period. An exact and ingenious critic has proved, that it was not finished till the year 1358 <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Tyrwhitt's CHAUCER, iv. 115. seq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have just observed, that Berchorius probably compiled this work for the use of his grammatical pupils. Were there not many good reasons for that supposition, I should be induced to think, that it might have been intended as a book of stories for the purpose of preachers. I have already given instances, that it was antiently fashionable for preachers to enforce the several moral duties by applying fables, or exemplary narratives: and, in the present case, the perpetual recurrence of the address of CARISSIMI might be brought in favour of this hypothesis. But I will here suggest an additional reason. Soon after the age of
<PB N="xciii" REF="100"/>
Berchorius, a similar collection of stories, of the same cast, was compiled, though not exactly in the same form, professedly de∣signed for sermon writers, and by one who was himself an emi∣nent preacher: for, rather before the year 1480, a Latin volume was printed in Germany, written by John Herolt a Dominican friar of Basil, better known by the adopted and humble appella∣tion of DISCIPULUS, and who flourished about the year 1418. It consists of three parts. The first is entitled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Incipiunt Ser∣mones pernotabiles DISCIPULI de Sanctis per anni circu∣lum."</Q> That is, a set of Sermons on the Saints of the whole year. The second part, and with which I am now chiefly con∣cerned, is a PROMPTUARY, or ample repository, of examples for composing sermons: and in the Prologue to this part the author says, that saint Dominic always <HI>abundabat exemplis</HI> in his dis∣courses, and that he constantly practiced this popular mode of edification. This part contains a variety of little histories. Among others, are the following. Chaucer's Friar's tale. Aris∣totle falling in love with a queen, who compels him to permit her to ride upon his back <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">EXEMPL. lxvii.

<P>It may not be thought impertinent to close this discourse with a remark on the MORALISATIONS, subjoined to the stories of the GESTA ROMANORUM. This was an age of vision and mystery: and every work was believed to contain a double, or

secondary, meaning. Nothing escaped this eccentric spirit of refinement and abstraction: and, together with the bible, as we have seen, not only the general history of antient times was ex∣plained allegorically, but even the poetical fictions of the classics were made to signify the great truths of religion, with a degree of boldness, and a want of a discrimination, which in another age would have acquired the character of the most profane levity, if not of absolute impiety, and can only be defended from the simplicity of the state of knowledge which then prevailed.</P>
<P>Thus, God creating man of clay, animated with the vital principle of respiration, was the story of Prometheus, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> formed a man of similar materials, to which he communicated life by fire stolen from heaven. Christ twice born, of his father God and of his mother Mary, was prefigured by Bac∣chus, who was first born of Semele, and afterwards of Jupiter. And as Minerva sprung from the brain of Jupiter, so Christ proceeded from God without a mother. Christ born of the Virgin Mary was expressed in the fable of Danae shut within a tower, through the covering of which Jupiter descended in a shower of gold, and begot Perseus. Acteon, killed by his own hounds, was a type of the persecution and death of our Saviour. The poet Lycophron relates, that Hercules in returning from the adventure of the Golden Fleece was shipwrecked; and that being devoured by a monstrous fish, he was disgorged alive on the shore after three days. Here was an obvious symbol of Christ's resurrection. John Waleys, an English Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nciscan of the thirteenth century, in his moral exposition of Ovid's Me∣tamorphoses <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">I have before mentioned Berchorius's OVID MORALISED.</NOTE>, affords many other instances equally ridiculous; and who forgot that he was describing a more heterrogeneous chaos, than that which makes so conspicuous a figure in his author's exordium, and which combines, amid the monstrous and indigested aggregate of its unnatural associations,

At length, compositions professedly allegorical, with which that age abounded, were resolved into allegories for which they were never intended. In the famous ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, written about the year 1310, the poet couches the difficulties of an ardent lover in attaining the object of his passion, under the allegory of a Rose, which is gathered in a delicious but almost inaccessible garden. The theologists proved this rose to be the white rose of Jericho, the new Jerusalem, a state of grace, di∣vine wisdom, the holy Virgin, or eternal beatitude, at none of which obstinate heretics can ever arrive. The chemists pre∣tended, that it was the philosopher's stone; the civilians, that it was the most consummate point of equitable decision; and the physicians, that it was an infallible panacea. In a word, other professions, in the most elaborate commentaries, explained away the lover's rose into the mysteries of their own respective science. In conformity to this practice, Tasso allegorised his own poem: and a flimsy structure of morality was raised on the chimerical conceptions of Ariosto's ORLANDO. In the year 1577, a translation of a part of Amadis de Gaule appeared in France; with a learned preface, developing the valuable stores of profound instruction, concealed under the naked letter of the old romances, which were discernible only to the intelligent, and totally unperceived by common readers; who, instead of plucking the fruit, were obliged to rest contented with <HI>le simple</HI> FLEUR <HI>de la Lecture litterale.</HI> Even Spenser, at a later period, could not indulge his native impulse to descriptions of chivalry, without framing such a story, as conveyed, under the <HI>dark con∣ceit</HI> of ideal champions, a set of historic transactions, and an exemplification of the nature of the twelve moral virtues. He presents his fantastic queen with a rich romantic mirrour, which shewed the wonderous achievements of her magnificent ancestry.</P>

<P>It was not, however, solely from an unmeaning and a wanton spirit of refinement, that the fashion of resolving every thing into allegory so universally prevailed. The same apology may be offered for the cabalistical interpreters, both of the classics and of the old romances. The former not willing that those books should be quite exploded which contained the antient mythology, laboured to reconcile the apparent absurdities of the pagan system to the christian mysteries, by demonstrating a figurative resemblance. The latter, as true learning began to dawn, with a view of supporting for a while the expiring credit of giants and magicians, were compelled to palliate those monstrous incre∣dibilities, by a bold attempt to unravel the mystic web which had been wove by fairy hands, and by shewing that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of Gothic invention.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>OUR communications and intercourse with Italy, which began to prevail about the beginning of the sixteenth century, not only introduced the studies of classical lite∣rature into England, but gave a new turn to our vernacular poetry. At this period, Petrarch still continued the most favo∣rite poet of the Italians; and had established a manner, which was universally adopted and imitated by his ingenious countrymen. In the mean time, the courts both of France and England were distinguished for their elegance. Francis the first had changed the state of letters in France, by mixing gallantry with learning, and by admitting the ladies to his court in company with the ecclesiastics <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. His carousals were celebrated with a brilliancy and a festivity unknown to the ceremonious shews of former princes. Henry the eighth vied with Francis in these gaieties. His ambition, which could not bear a rival even in diversions,
<PB N="2" REF="106"/>
was seconded by liberality of disposition and a love of ostentation. For Henry, with many boisterous qualities was magnificent and affable. Had he never murthered his wives, his politeness to the fair sex would remain unimpeached. His martial sports were unincumbered by the barbaric pomp of the antient chivalry, and softened by the growing habits of more rational manners. He was attached to those spectacles and public amusements, in which beauty assumed a principal share; and his frequent masques and tournaments encouraged a high spirit of romantic courtesy. Poetry was the natural accompaniment of these re∣finements. Henry himself was a leader and a chief character in these pageantries, and at the same time a reader and a writer of verses. The language and the manners of Italy were esteemed and studied. The sonnets of Petrarch were the great models of composition. They entered into the genius of the fashionable manners: and in a court of such a complexion, Pe∣trach of course became the popular poet. Henry Howard earl Surrey, with a mistress perhaps as beautiful as Laura, and at least with Petrarch's passion if not his taste, led the way to great im∣provements in English poetry, by a happy imitation of Petrarch, and other Italian poets, who had been most successful in paint∣ing the anxieties of love with pathos and propriety.</P>
<P>Lord Surrey's life throws so much light on the character and subjects of his poetry, that it is almost impossible to consider the one, without exhibiting a few anecdotes of the other. He was the son and grandson of two lords treasurers dukes of Nor∣folk; and in his early childhood discovered the most promising marks of lively parts and an active mind.</P>
<P>While a boy, he was habituated to the modes of a court at Windsor-castle; where he resided, yet under the care of proper instructors, in the quality of a companion to Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, a natural son of king Henry the eighth, and of the highest expectations.</P>
<P>This young nobleman, who also bore other titles and honours, was the child of Henry's affection: not so much on account of
<PB N="3" REF="107"/>
hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hopeful abilities, as for a reason insinuated by lord Herbert, and at which those who know Henry's history and character will not be surprised, because he equally and strongly resembled both his father and mother.</P>
<P>A friendship of the closest kind commencing between these two illustrious youths, about the year 1530, they were both re∣moved to cardinal Wolsey's college at Oxford, then universally frequented, as well for the excellence as the novelty of its insti∣tution; for it was one of the first seminaries of an English uni∣versity, that professed to explode the pedantries of the old bar∣barous philosophy, and to cultivate the graces of polite litera∣ture. Two years afterwards, for the purpose of acquiring every accomplishment of an elegant education, the earl accompanied his noble friend and fellow-pupil into France, where they re∣ceived king Henry, on his arrival at Calais to visit Francis the first, with a most magnificent retinue. The frienship of these two young noblemen was soon strengthened by a new tie; for Richmond married the lady Mary Howard, Surrey's sister. Rich∣mond, however, appears to have died in the year 1536, about the age of seventeen, having never cohabited with his wife <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 68.</NOTE>. It was long, before Surrey forgot the untimely loss of this amiable youth, the friend and associate of his childhood, and who nearly resembled himself in genius, refinement of manners, and liberal acquisitions.</P>
<P>The FAIR GERALDINE, the general object of lord Surrey's passionate sonnets, is commonly said to have lived at Florence, and to have been of the family of the Gera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i of that city. This is a mistake, yet not entirely without grounds, propagated by an easy misapprehension of an expression in one of our poet's odes, and a passage in Drayton's heroic epistles. She was un∣doubtedly one of the daughters of Gerald Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare. But it will be necessary to transcribe what our author himself has said of this celebrated lady. The history of one
<PB N="4" REF="108"/>
who caused so memorable and so poetical a passion naturally ex∣cites curiosity, and will justify an investigation, which, on many a similar occasion, would properly be censured as frivolous and impertinent.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>These notices, it must be confessed, are obscure and indirect. But a late elegant biographer has, with the most happy sagacity, solved the difficulties of this little enigmatical ode, which had been before either neglected and unattempted as inexplicable, or rendered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more unintelligible by false conjectures. I readily adopt Mr. Walpole's key to the genealogy of the matchless Geraldine <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">CATAL. Roy. and Noble Authors, vol. i. p. 105. edit. 1759.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Her poetical appellation is almost her real name. Gerald Fitzgerald, abovementioned, earl of Kildare in the reign of Henry the eighth, married a second wife, Margaret daughter of Thomas Gray, marquis of Dorset: by whom he had three daughters, Margaret, Elisabeth, and Cicely. Margaret was born deaf and dumb; and a lady who could neither hear nor answer her lover, and who wanted the means of contributing to the most endearing reciprocations, can hardly be supposed to have
<PB N="5" REF="109"/>
been the cause of any vehement effusions of amorous panegyric. We may therefore safely pronounce Elisabeth or Cicely to have been Surrey's favorite. It was probably Elisabeth, as she seems always to have lived in England.</P>
<P>Every circumstance of the sonnet evidently coincides with this state of the case. But, to begin with the first line, it will naturally be asked, what was lady Elisabeth Gerald's connection with Tuscany? The beginnings of noble families, like those of nations, often owe somewhat to fictitious embellishment: and our genealogists uniformly assert, that the family of Fitzgerald derives its origin from Otho, a descendant of the dukes of Tuscany: that they migrated into England under the reign of king Alfred, whose annals are luckily too scanty to contradict such an account, and were from England speedily transplanted into Ireland. Her father was an Irish earl, resident at his earl∣dom of Kildare; and she was consequently born and nursed in Ireland. Her mother, adds the sonnet, was of princely paren∣tage. Here is a no less exact correspondence with the line of the lady's pedigree: for Thomas, marquis of Dorset, was son of queen Elisabeth Gray, daughter of the duchess of Bedford, de∣scended from the royal house of Luxemburgh. The poet ac∣quaints us, that he first saw her at Hunsdon. This notice, which seems of an indifferent nature and quite extraneous to the ques∣tion, abundantly corroborates our conjecture. Hundsdon-house in Hertfordshire was a new palace built by Henry the eighth, and chiefly for the purpose of educating his children. The lady Elisabeth Fitzgerald was second cousin to Henry's daughters the princesses Mary and Elisabeth, who were both educated at Huns∣don <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, ECCL. MEM. vol. i. APPEND. Numb. 71.</NOTE>. At this royal nursery she therefore <HI>tasted of costly foode with kinges childe,</HI> that is, lived while a girl with the young princesses her relations, as a companion in their education. At the same time, and on the same plan, our earl of Surrey resided at Windsor-castle, as I have already remarked, with the young
<PB N="6" REF="110"/>
duke of Richmond. It is natural to suppose, that he sometimes visited the princesses at Hunsdon, in company with the young duke their brother, where he must have also seen the fair Geral∣dine: yet by the nature of his situation at Windsor, which im∣plied a degree of confinement, he was hindered from visiting her at Hunsdon so often as he wished. He therefore pathetically laments,
<Q><L>Windsor, alas, doth chase me from her sight!</L></Q>
But although the earl first beheld this lady at the palace of Huns∣don, yet, as we further learn from the sonnet, he was first struck with her incomparable beauty, and his passion com∣menced, at Hampton-court.
<Q><L>Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine!</L></Q>
That is, and perhaps on occasion of some splendid masque or carou∣sal, when the lady Elisabeth Fitzgerald, with the princesses Mary and Elisabeth, and their brother Richmond, with the young lord Surrey, were invited by the king to Hampton-court.</P>
<P>In the mean time we must remember, that the lord Leonard Gray, uncle to lord Gerald Fitzgerald, was deputy of Ireland for the young duke of Richmond: a connection, exclusive of all that has been said, which would alone account for Surrey's acquaintance at least with this lady. It is also a reason, to say no more, why the earl should have regarded her from the first with a particular attention, which afterwards grew into the most passionate attachment. She is supposed to have been Maid of honour to queen Catharine. But there are three of Henry's queens of that name. For obvious reasons, however, we may venture to say, that queen Catharine Howard was Geraldine's queen.</P>
<P>It is not precisely known at what period the earl of Surrey began his travels. They have the air of a romance. He made the tour of Europe in the true spirit of chivalry, and with the
<PB N="7" REF="111"/>
ideas of an Amadis; proclaiming the unparalleled charms of his mistress, and prepared to defend the cause of her beauty with the weapons of knight-errantry. Nor was this adventurous journey performed without the intervention of an enchanter. The first city in Italy which he proposed to visit was Florence, the capital of Tuscany, and the original seat of the ancestors of his Geraldine. In his way thither, he passed a few days at the emperor's court; where he became acquainted with Cornelius Agrippa, a celebrated adept in natural magic. This visionary philosopher shewed our hero, in a mirror of glass, a living image of Geraldine, reclining on a couch, sick, and reading one of his most tender sonnets by a waxen taper <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Drayton, HER. EPIST.—HOWARD to GERALDINE, v. 57.</NOTE>. His imagination, which wanted not the flattering representations and artificial in∣centives of illusion, was heated anew by this interesting and af∣fecting spectacle. Inflamed with every enthusiasm of the most romantic passion, he hastened to Florence: and, on his arrival, immediately published a defiance against any person who could handle a lance and was in love, whether Christian, Jew, Turk, Saracen, or Canibal, who should presume to dispute the superio∣rity of Geraldine's beauty. As the lady was pretended to be of Tuscan extraction, the pride of the Florentines was flattered on this occasion: and the grand duke of Tuscany permitted a ge∣neral and unmolested ingress into his dominions of the comba∣tants of all countries, till this important trial should be decided. The challenge was accepted, and the earl victorious <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wood, ubi supr.</NOTE>. The shield which he presented to the duke before the tournament be∣gan, is exhibited in Vertue's valuable plate of the Arundel family, and was actually in the possession of the late duke of Norfolk <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Walpole, AN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CD. PAINT. i. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These heroic vanities did not, however, so totally engross the time which Surrey spent in Italy, as to alienate his mind from letters: he studied with the greatest success a critical knowledge
<PB N="8" REF="112"/>
of the Italian tongue, and, that he might give new lustre to the name of Geraldine, attained a just taste for the peculiar graces of the Italian poetry.</P>
<P>He was recalled to England for some idle reason by the king, much sooner than he expected: and he returned home, the most elegant traveller, the most polite lover, the most learned nobleman, and the most accomplished gentleman, of his age. Dexterity in tilting, and gracefulness in managing a horse under arms, were excellencies now viewed with a critical eye, and practised with a high degree of emulation. In 1540, at a tour∣nament held in the presence of the court at Westminster, and in which the principal of the nobility were engaged, Surrey was distinguished above the rest for his address in the use and exercise of arms. But his martial skill was not solely displayed in the parade and ostentation of these domestic combats. In 1542, he marched into Scotland, as a chief commander in his father's army; and was conspicuous for his conduct and bravery at the memorable battle of Flodden-field, where James the fourth of Scotland was killed. The next year, we find the career of his victories impeded by an obstacle which no valour could resist. The censures of the church have humiliated the greatest heroes: and he was imprisoned in Windsor-castle for eating flesh in Lent. The prohibition had been renewed or strengthened by a recent proclamation of the king. I mention this circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not only as it marks his character, impatient of any controul, and careless of very serious consequences which often arise from a contempt of petty formalities, but as it gave occasion to one of his most sentimental and pathetic sonnets <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fol. 6. 7.</NOTE>. In 1544, he was field-marshal of the English army in the expedition to Bologne, which he took. In that age, love and arms constantly went together: and it was amid the fatigues of this protracted cam∣paign, that he composed his last sonnet called the FANSIE of a <HI>wearied Lover</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Fol. 18. See Dudg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> BARONAG<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ii. p. 275.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="113"/>
But as Surrey's popularity encreased, his interest declined with the king; whose caprices and jealousies grew more violent with his years and infirmities. The brilliancy of Surrey's character, his celebrity in the military science, his general abilities, his wit, learning, and affability, were viewed by Henry with dis∣gust and suspicion. It was in vain that he possessed every advan∣tageous qualification, which could adorn the scholar, the cour∣tier, and the soldier. In proportion as he was amiable in the eyes of the people, he became formidable to the king. His rising reputation was misconstrued into a dangerous ambition, and gave birth to accusations equally groundless and frivolous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He was suspected of a design to marry the princess Mary; and, by that alliance, of approaching to a possibility of wearing the crown. It was insinuated, that he conversed with foreigners, and held a correspondence with cardinal Pole.</P>
<P>The addition of the escocheon of Edward the Confessor to his own, although used by the family of Norfolk for many years, and justified by the authority of the heralds, was a suffi∣cient foundation for an impeachment of high treason. These motives were privately aggravated by those prejudices, with which Henry remembered the misbehaviour of Catharine Howard, and which were extended to all that lady's relations. At length, the earl of Surrey fell a sacrifice to the peevish injustice of a merci∣less and ungrateful master. Notwithstanding his eloquent and masculine defence, which even in the cause of guilt itself would have proved a powerful persuasive, he was condemned by the prepared suffrage of a servile and obsequious jury, and beheaded on Tower-hill in the year 1547 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See Stowe, CHRON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 592.

In the mean time we should remember, that Surrey's public conduct was not on all occasions quite unexceptionable. In the affair of Bologne he had made a false step. This had offended the king. But Henry, when once offended, could never forgive. And when Hertford was sent into France to take the command, he could not refrain from
<PB N="10" REF="114"/>
dropping some reproachful expressions against a measure which seemed to impeach his personal courage. Conscious of his high birth and capacity, he was above the little attentions of caution and reserve; and he too frequently neglected to consult his own situation, and the king's temper. It was his misfortune to serve a monarch, whose resentments, which were easily provoked, could only be satisfied by the most severe revenge. Henry brought those men to the block, which other monarchs would have only disgraced.</P>
<P>Among these anecdotes of Surrey's life, I had almost forgot to mention what became of his amour with the fair Geraldine. We lament to find, that Surrey's devotion to this lady did not end in a wedding, and that all his gallantries and verses availed so little! No memoirs of that incurious age have informed us, whether her beauty was equalled by her cruelty; or whether her ambition prevailed so far over her gratitude, as to tempt her to prefer the solid glories of a more splendid title and ample for∣tune, to the challenges and the compliments, of so magnani∣mous, so faithful, and so eloquent a lover. She appears, however, to have been afterwards the third wife of Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln. Such also is the power of time and accident over amorous vows, that even Surrey himself outlived the violence of his passion. He married Frances, daughter of John earl of Oxford, by whom he left several children. One of his daugh∣ters, Jane countess of Westmoreland, was among the learned ladies of that age, and became famous for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugd. BARON. i. 533. ii. 275.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Surrey's poems were in high reputation with his cotempora∣ries, and for many years afterwards. He is thus characterised by the author of the old ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, whose opinion remained long as a rule of criticism. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the latter end of the same kinges [Henry] raigne, spronge up a new company of courtly makers, of whom sir Thomas Wyat the

Surrey is said, by the ingenious author of the MUSES LIBRARY, to have been the first who broke through the fashion of stanzas, and wrote in the heroic couplet. But all Surrey's poems are in the alternate rhyme; nor, had this been true, is the other position to be granted. Chaucer's Prologues and most of the Canterbury Tales are written in long verse: nor was the use of the couplet resumed, till late in the reign of Elisabeth.</P>
<P>In the sonnets of Surrey, we are surprised to find nothing of that metaphysical cast which marks the Italian poets, his sup∣posed masters, especially Petrarch. Surrey's sentiments are for the most part natural and unaffected; arising from his own feel∣ings, and dictated by the present circumstances. His poetry is alike unembarrassed by learned allusions, or elaborate conceits. If our author copies Petrarch, it is Petrarch's better manner: when he descends from his Platonic abstractions, his refinements of passion, his exaggerated compliments, and his play upon oppo∣site sentiments, into a track of tenderness, simplicity, and nature. Petrarch would have been a better poet had he been a worse scho∣lar. Our author's mind was not too much overlaid by learning.</P>
<P>The following is the poem abovementioned, in which he laments his imprisonment in Windsor-castle. But it is rather an elegy than a sonnet.</P>

With eyes cast up into the mayden's tower <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Swift's joke about the Maids of ho∣nour being lodged at Windsor in the round tower, in queen Anne's time, is too well known and too indelicate to be repeated here. But in the present instance, Surrey speaks loosely and poetically in making the MAIDEN-TOWER, the true reading, the residence of the women. The maiden∣tower was common in other castles, and means the principal tower, of the greatest strength and defence. MAIDEN is a cor∣ruption of the old French <HI>Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> or <HI>Mayne,</HI> great.

We have Maiden-down in Somertsetshire with the same signification. A thousand other instances might be given.

<P>In the poet's situation, nothing can be more natural and striking than the reflection with which he opens his complaint. There is also much beauty in the abruptness of his exordial exclamation. The superb palace, where he had passed the most pleasing days of his youth with the son of a king, was now con∣verted into a tedious and solitary prison! This unexpected vicis∣situde of fortune awakens a new and interesting train of thought. The comparison of his past and present circumstances recals their juvenile sports and amusements; which were more to be regretted, as young Richmond was now dead. Having described some of these with great elegance, he recurs to his first idea by a beautiful apostrophe. He appeals to the place of his confine∣ment, once the source of his highest pleasures: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O place of bliss, renewer of my woe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! And where is now my noble friend, my companion is these delights, who was once your
<PB N="16" REF="120"/>
inhabitant! Echo alone either pities or answers my question, and returns a plaintive hollow sound!"</Q> He closes his com∣plaint with an affecting and pathetic sentiment, much in the style of Petrarch. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To banish the miseries of my present distress, I am forced on the wretched expedient of remem∣bering a greater!"</Q> This is the consolation of a warm fancy. It is the philosophy of poetry.</P>
<P>Some of the following stanzas, on a lover who presumed to compare his lady with the divine Geraldine, have almost the ease and gallantry of Waller. The leading compliment, which has been used by later writers, is in the spirit of an Italian fiction. It is very ingenious, and handled with a high degree of elegance.</P>

<P>But Surrey was not merely the poet of idleness and gallantry. He was fitted both from nature and study, for the more solid and laborious parts of literature. He translated the second and fourth books of Virgil into blank verse <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">They were first printed in 1557. 12mo.</NOTE>: and it seems probable, that
<PB N="21" REF="125"/>
his active situations of life prevented him from completing a design of translating the whole Eneid.</P>
<P>This is the first composition in blank verse, extant in the English language. Nor has it merely the relative and accidental merit of being a curiosity.

<P>This was a noble attempt to break the bondage of rhyme. But blank verse was now growing fashionable in the Italian poetry, the school of Surrey. Felice Figlinei, a Sanese, and Surrey's cotemporary, in his admirable Italian commentary on the ETHICS of Aristotle, entitled FILOSOSIA MORALE SOPRA IL LIBRI D' ETHICA D'ARISTOTILE, declaims against the barbarity of rhyme, and strongly recommends a total rejection of this Gothic ornament to his countrymen. He enforces his precept by his own example; and translates all Aristotle's quotations from Homer and Euripides into verse without rhyme. Gonsalvo Perez, the learned secretary to Philip of Spain, had also recently tran∣slated Homer's Odyssey into Spanish blank-verse. How much the excellent Roger Ascham approved of Surrey's disuse of rhyme in this translation from Virgil, appears from the following pas∣sage in his SCHOLEMASTER, written about the year 1566 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I know of no English critic besides, who has mentioned Surrey's Virgil, except Bolton, a great reader of old English books.

<P>The revival of the Greek and Roman poets in Italy, excited all the learned men of that country to copy the Roman versifica∣tion, and consequently banished the old Leonine Latin verse. The same classical idea operated in some degree on the vernacular poetry of Italy. In the year 1528, Trissino published his ITA∣LIA LIBERATA DI GOTI, or, ITALY DELIVERED FROM THE GOTHS, an heroic poem, professedly written in imitation of the Iliad, without either rhyme, or the usual machineries of the Gothic romance. Trissino's design was to destroy the TERZA RIMA of Dante. We do not, however, find, whether it be from the facility with which the Italian tongue falls into rhyme, or that the best and established Italian poets wrote in the stanza, that these efforts to restore blank-verse, produced any lasting effects in the progress of the Italian poetry. It is very probable, that this specimen of the Eneid in blank-verse by Surrey, led the way to Abraham Fleming's blank-verse translation of Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics, although done in Alexandrines, published in the year 1589 <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">London, 4to.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Lord Surrey wrote many other English poems which were never
<PB N="26" REF="130"/>
published, and are now perhaps entirely lost. He translated the ECCLESIASTES of Solomon into English verse. This piece is cited in the Preface to the Translation of the Psalms, printed at London in 1567. He also translated a few of the Psalms into metre. These versions of Scripture shew that he was a friend to the refor∣mation. Among his works are also recited, a Poem on his friend the young duke of Richmond, an Exhortation to the citizens of London, a Translation of Boccace's Epistle to Pinus, and a sett of Latin epistles. Aubrey has preserved a poetical Epitaph, written by Surrey on sir Thomas Clere, his faithful retainer and constant attendant, which was once in Lambeth-church <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Aubrey's SURREY, V. 247.</NOTE>; and which, for its affection and elegance, deserves to be printed among the earl's poems.

<P>Surrey, for his justness of thought, correctness of style, and purity of expression, may justly be pronounced the first English classical poet. He unquestionably is the first polite writer of love∣verses in our language. It must, however, be allowed, that there is a striking native beauty in some of our love-verses written much earlier than Surrey's. But in the most savage ages and countries, rude nature has taught elegance to the lover.</P>

<P>WITH Surrey's Poems, Tottel has joined, in his editions of 1557 and 1565, the SONGES and SONNETTES of sir Thomas Wyat the elder <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wyat's begin at fol. 19.</NOTE>, and of Uncertain Auctours.</P>
<P>Wyat was of Allington-castle in Kent, which he magnificently repaired, and educated in both our universities. But his chief and most splendid accomplishments were derived from his travels into various parts of Europe, which he frequently visited in the quality of an envoy. He was endeared to king Henry the eighth, who did not always act from caprice, for his fidelity and success in the execution of public business, his skill in arms, literature, familiarity with languages, and lively conversation. Wood, who degrades every thing by poverty of style and improper represen∣tations, says, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the king was in a high manner delighted with his <HI>witty jests</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 51.</NOTE>."</Q> It is not perhaps improbable, that Henry was as much pleased with his repartees as his politics. He is re∣ported to have occasioned the reformation by a joke, and to have planned the fall of cardinal Wolsey by a seasonable story <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e MISCELLANEOUS ANTIQUITIES. Numb. ii. pag. 16. Printed at Strawberry∣hill, 1772. 4to.</NOTE>. But he had almost lost his popularity, either from an intimacy with queen Anne Boleyn, which was called a connection, or the gloomy cabals of bishop Bonner, who could not bear his poli∣tical superiority. Yet his prudence and integrity, no less than the powers of his oratory, justified his innocence. He laments his severe and unjust imprisonment on that trying occasion, in a sonnet addressed to sir Francis Bryan: insinuating his sollici∣tude, that although the wound would be healed, the scar would
<PB N="29" REF="133"/>
remain, and that to be acquitted of the accusation would avail but little, while the thoughts of having been accused were still fresh in remembrance <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fol. 44.</NOTE>. It is a common mistake, that he died abroad of the plague in an embassy to Charles the fifth. Being sent to conduct that emperor's embassador from Falmouth to London, from too eager and a needless desire of executing his commission with dispatch and punctuality, he caught a fever by riding in a hot day, and in his return died on the road at Shir∣burn, where he was buried in the great conventual church, in the year 1541. The next year, Leland published a book of Latin verses on his death, with a wooden print of his head pre∣fixed, probably done by Holbein <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">NAEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AE <HI>in mortem T. Viati,</HI> Lond. 1542. 4to. See also Leland's ENCOM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 358.</NOTE>. It will be superfluous to transcribe the panegyrics of his cotemporaries, after the enco∣mium of lord Surrey, in which his amiable character owes more to truth, than to the graces of poetry, or to the flattery of friendship.</P>
<P>We must agree with a critic above quoted, that Wyat co∣operated with Surry, in having corrected the roughness of our poetic style. But Wyat, although sufficiently distinguished from the common versifiers of his age, is confessedly inferior to Surrey in harmony of numbers, perspicuity of expression, and facility of phraseology. Nor is he equal to Surrey in elegance of senti∣timent, in nature and sensibility. His feelings are disguised by affectation, and obscured by conceit. His declarations of passion are embarrassed by wit and fancy; and his style is not intelli∣gible, in proportion as it is careless and unadorned. His compli∣ments, like the modes of behaviour in that age, are ceremonious and strained. He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet. His gallantries are laboured, and his versification negli∣gent. The truth is, his genius was of the moral and didactic species: and his poems abound more in good sense, satire, and observations on life, than in pathos or imagination. Yet there
<PB N="30" REF="134"/>
is a degree of lyric sweetness in the following lines to his lute, in which, <HI>The lover complaineth of the unkindness of his love.</HI></P>

<P>Our author has more imitations, and even translations, from the Italian poets than Surrey: and he seems to have been more fond of their conceits. Petrarch has described the perplexities of a lover's mind, and his struggles betwixt hope and despair, a subject most fertile of sentimental complaint, by a combination of contrarieties, a species of wit highly relished by the Italians. I am, says he, neither at peace nor war. I burn, and I freeze. I soar to heaven, and yet grovel on the earth. I can hold no∣thing, and yet grasp every thing. My prison is neither shut, nor is it opened. I see without eyes, and I complain without a voice. I laugh, and I weep. I live, and am dead.

</LG></Q>
<P>It was from the capricious and over-strained invention of the Italian poets, that Wyat was taught to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orture the passion of love by prolix and intricate comparisons, and unnatural allusions. At one time his love is a galley steered by cruelty through stormy seas and dangerous rocks; the sails torn by the blast of tem∣pestuous sighs, and the cordage consumed by incessant showers of tears: a cloud of grief envelopes the stars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason is drowned,
<PB N="33" REF="137"/>
and the haven is at a distance <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fol. 22.</NOTE>. At another <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fol. 25.</NOTE>, it is a spring trickling from the summit of the Alps, which gathering force in its fall, at length overflows all the plain beneath <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Fol. 25.</NOTE>. Some∣times, it is a gun, which being overcharged, expands the flame within itself, and bursts in pieces <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Fol. 29.</NOTE>. Sometimes it is like a pro∣digious mountain, which is perpetually weeping in copious foun∣tains, and sending forth sighs from its forests: which bears more leaves than fruits: which breeds wild-beasts, the proper em∣blems of rage, and harbours birds that are always singing <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fol. 36.</NOTE>. In another of his sonnets, he says, that all nature sympathises with his passion. The woods resound his elegies, the rivers stop their course to hear him complain, and the grass weeps in dew. These thoughts are common and fantastic. But he adds an image which is new, and has much nature and sentiment, al∣though not well expressed.
<Q><L>The hugy okes have rored in the winde,</L>
<L>Eche thing, methought, complaining in theyr kinde.</L></Q>
This is a touch of the pensive. And the apostrophe which fol∣lows is natural and simple.
<Q><L>Ah stony hart, who hath thus framed thee</L>
<L>So cruel, that art clothed with beautie <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fol. 24.</NOTE>!</L></Q>
And there is much strength in these lines of the lover to his bed.
<Q><L>The place of slepe, wherein I do but wake,</L>
<L>Besprent with tears, my bed, I thee forsake <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 25.</NOTE>!</L></Q>
But such passages as these are not the general characteristics of Wyat's poetry. They strike us but seldom, amidst an impracticable
<PB N="34" REF="138"/>
mass of forced reflections, hyperbolical metaphors, and complaints that move no compassion.</P>
<P>But Wyat appears a much more pleasing writer, when he moralises on the felicities of retirement, and attacks the vanities and vices of a court, with the honest indignation of an inde∣pendent philosopher, and the freedom and pleasantry of Horace. Three of his poetical epistles are professedly written in this strain, two to John Poines <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">He seems to have been a person about the court. See LIFE of Sir Thomas Pope, p. 46.</NOTE>, and the other to sir Francis Bryan: and we must regret, that he has not left more pieces in a style of composition for which he seems to have been eminently qua∣lified. In one of the epistles to Poines on the life of a cour∣tier, are these spirited and manly reflections.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>In pursuit of this argument, he declares his indisposition and inability to disguise the truth, and to flatter, by a variety of instances.

<P>I mention this circumstance about Chaucer, to shew the esteem in which the KNIGHT'S TALE, that noble epic poem of the dark ages, was held in the reign of Henry eighth, by men of taste.</P>

<P>In another epistle to John Poines, on the security and happi∣ness of a moderate fortune, he versifies the fable of the City and Country Mouse with much humour.

<P>Wyat may justly be deemed the first polished English satirist. I am of opinion, that he mistook his talents when, in com∣pliance with the mode, he became a sonnetteer; and, if we may judge from a few instances, that he was likely to have treated any other subject with more success than that of love. His abi∣lities were seduced and misapplied in fabricating fine speeches to an obdurate mistress. In the following little ode, or rather epi∣gram, on a very different occasion, there is great simplicity and propriety, together with a strain of poetic allusion. It is on his return from Spain into England.</P>

<P>Among Wyat's poems is an unfinished translation, in Alexan∣drine verse, of the Song of Iopas in the first book of Virgil's Eneid <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 49.</NOTE>. Wyat's and Surrey's versions from Virgil are the first
<PB N="39" REF="143"/>
regular translations in English of an antient classic poet: and they are symptoms of the restoration of the study of the Roman writers, and of the revival of elegant literature. A version of David's Psalms by Wyat is highly extolled by lord Surrey and Leland. But Wyat's version of the PENITENTIAL PSALMS seems to be a separate work from his translation of the whole Psaltery, and probably that which is praised by Surrey, in an ode above quoted, and entitled, <HI>Praise of certain Psalmes of David, translated by Sir T. Wyat the elder</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Fol. 16. [See supr. p. 18.]</NOTE>.

<P>A similarity, or rather sameness of studies, as it is a proof, so perhaps it was the chief cement, of that inviolable friend∣ship which is said to have subsisted between Wyat and Surrey. The principal subject of their poetry was the same: and they both treated the passion of love in the spirit of the Italian poets,
<PB N="40" REF="144"/>
and as professed disciples of Petrarch. They were alike devoted to the melioration of their native tongue, and an attainment of the elegancies of composition. They were both engaged in tran∣slating Virgil, and in rendering select portions of Scripture into English metre.</P>

<P>TO the poems of Surrey and Wyat are annexed, as I have before hinted, in Tottell's editions, those of uncertain authors <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">They begin at fol. 50.</NOTE>. This latter collection forms the first printed poetical miscellany in the English language: although very early manu∣script miscellanies of that kind are not uncommon. Many of these pieces are much in the manner of Surrey and Wyat, which was the fashion of the times. They are all anonymous; but probably, sir Francis Bryan, George Boleyn earl of Roch∣ford, and lord Vaulx, all professed rhymers and sonnet-writers, were large contributors.</P>
<P>Drayton, in his elegy <HI>To his dearly loved friend</HI> HENRY REY∣NOLDS OF POETS AND POESIE, seems to have blended all the several collections of which Tottell's volume consists. After Chaucer he says,</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>That princely Surrey, early in the time</L>
<L>Of the eighth Henry, who was then the prime</L>

<P><PB N="42" REF="146"/>
Sir Francis Bryan was the friend of Wyat, as we have seen; and served as a commander under Thomas earl of Surrey in an expedition into Brittany, by whom he was knighted for his bravery <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dugd. BAR. ii. 273. a.</NOTE>. Hence he probably became connected with lord Surrey the poet. But Bryan was one of the brilliant ornaments of the court of king Henry the eighth, which at least affected to be polite: and from his popular accomplishments as a wit and a poet, he was made a gentleman of the privy-chamber to that monarch, who loved to be entertained by his domestics <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, FO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>D. xiv. 380.</NOTE>. Yet he enjoyed much more important appointments in that reign, and in the first year of Edward the sixth; and died chief justiciary of Ireland, at Waterford, in the year 1548 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hollinsh. CHRON. i. 61. And Ibid. Hooker's CONTIN. tom. ii. P. ii. pag. 110. See also FOX, MARTYR. p. 991.</NOTE>. On the principle of an unbiassed attachment to the king, he wrote epistles on Henry's divorce, never published; and translated into English from the French, Antonio de Guevara's Spanish Disser∣tation on the life of a courtier, printed at London in the year last mentioned <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cod. Impress. A. Wood, Mus. Ash∣mol. Oxon.</NOTE>. He was nephew to John Bourchier, lord Berners, the translator of Froissart; who, at his desire, tran∣slated at Calais from French into English, the GOLDEN BOKE, or Life of Marcus Aurelius, about 1533 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See the COLOPHON. It was printed by Thomas Berthelett, in 1536, quarto. Often afterwards. Lord Berners was, de∣puty-general of Calais, and its Marches.</NOTE>. Which are Bryan's pieces I cannot ascertain.</P>
<P>George Boleyn, viscount Rochford, was son of sir Thomas Boleyn, afterwards earl of Wiltshire and Ormond; and at Ox∣ford discovered an early propensity to polite letters and poetry. He was appointed to several dignities and offices by king Henry the eighth, and subscribed the famous declaration sent to Pope Clement the seventh. He was brother to queen Anne Boleyn, with whom he was suspected of a criminal familiarity. The chief accusation against him seems to have been, that he was seen to whisper with the queen one morning while she was in
<PB N="43" REF="147"/>
bed. As he had been raised by the exaltation, he was involved in the misfortunes of that injured princess, who had no other fault but an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uarded and indiscrete frankness of nature; and whose character has been blackened by the bigotted historians of the catholic cause, merely because she was the mother of queen Elisabeth. To gratify the ostensible jealousy of the king, who had conceived a violent passion for a new object, this amiable nobleman was beheaded on the first of May, in 1536 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See Dugd. BARON. iii. p. 306. a.</NOTE>. His elegance of person, and spritely conversation, captivated all the ladies of Henry's court. Wood says, that at the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"royal court he was much <HI>adored,</HI> especially by the <HI>female sex,</HI> for his <HI>admirable</HI> discourse, and <HI>symmetry</HI> of body <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. i. 44.</NOTE>."</Q> From these irresistible allurements his enemies endeavoured to give a plausi∣bility to their infamous charge of an incestuous connection. After his commitment to the Tower, his sister the queen, on being sent to the same place, asked the lieutenant, with a degree of eagerness, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! where is my sweet brother <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Strype, MEM. i. p. 280.</NOTE>?"</Q> Here was a specious confirmation of his imagined guilt: this stroke of natural tenderness was too readily interpreted into a licentious attachment. Bale mentions his RHYTHMI ELEGANTISSIMI <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">ii. 103.</NOTE>, which Wood calls, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Songs and Sonnets, with other things of the like nature <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ubi supr.</NOTE>."</Q> These are now lost, unless some, as I have insinuated, are contained in the present collection; a gar∣land, in which it appears to have been the fashion for every FLOWERY COURTIER to leave some of his blossoms. But Boleyn's poems cannot now be distinguished.</P>
<P>The lord Vaulx, whom I have supposed, and on surer proof, to be another contributor to this miscellany, could not be the Nicholas lord Vaux, whose gown of purple velvet, plated with gold, eclipsed all the company present at the marriage of prince Arthur; who shines as a statesman and a soldier with uncom∣mon lustre in the history of Henry the seventh, and continued
<PB N="44" REF="148"/>
to adorn the earlier annals of his successor, and who died in the year 1523. Lord Vaux the poet, was probably Thomas lord Vaux, the son of Nicholas, and who was summoned to parlia∣ment in 1531, and seems to have lived till the latter end of the reign of queen Mary <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See what I have said of his son lord William, in the LIFE OF SIR THOMAS POPE, p. 221. In 1558, sir Tho. Pope leaves him a legacy of one hundred pounds, by the name of lord Vaulx.</NOTE>. All our old writers mention the poetical lord Vaux, as rather posterior to Wyat and Surrey; neither of whom was known as a writer till many years after the death of lord Nicholas. George Gascoyne, who wrote in 1575, in his panegyric on the ENGLISH POETS, places Vaux after Surrey.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>And Chaucer's spreet was greate;</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>Puttenham, author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, having spoken of Surrey and Wyat, immediately adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the SAME TIME, or NOT LONG AFTER, was the lord Nicholas<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The christian name is a mistake, into which it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy to fall.</NOTE> Vaux, a man of much facilitie in vulgar making <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fol. 48.</NOTE>."</Q> Webbe, in his DISCOURSE OF ENGLISH POETRIE, published in 1586, has a similar arrangement. Great numbers of Vaux's poems are ex∣tant in the PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES; and, instead of the rudeness of Skelton, they have a smoothness and facility of manner, which does not belong to poetry written before the year 1523, in which lord Nicholas Vaux died an old man <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Percy's BALL. ii. 49. edit. 1775.</NOTE>. The PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES was published in 1578, and he is there simply styled <HI>Lord Vaulx the elder:</HI> this was to distinguish him from his son lord William, then living. If lord Nicholas was a writer of poetry, I will venture to assert, that none of his performances now remain; notwithstanding the
<PB N="45" REF="149"/>
testimony of Wood, who says, that Nicholas, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in his juvenile years was sent to Oxon, where by reading humane and ro∣mantic, rather than philosophical authors, he advanced his genius very much in poetry and history <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 19.</NOTE>."</Q> This may be true of his son Thomas, whom I suppose to be the poet. But such was the celebrity of lord Nicholas's public and political character, that he has been made to monopolise every merit which was the property of his successors. All these difficulties, how∣ever, are at once adjusted by a manuscript in the British Museum: in which we have a copy of Vaux's poem, beginning <HI>I lothe that I did love,</HI> with this title: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A dyttye or sonet made by the lord Vaus, in the time of the noble quene Marye, representing the image of Death <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 1703. 25.</NOTE>."</Q> This sonnet, or rather ode, entitled, <HI>The aged lover renounceth love,</HI> which was more remembered for its morality than its poetry, and which is idly conjectured to have been written on his death-bed <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">G. Gascoyne says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The L.

From this ditty are taken three of the stanzas, yet greatly disguised and corrupted, of the Grave-digger's Song in Shakespeare's HAMLET <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Act V.</NOTE>. Another of lord Vaux's poems in the volume before us, is the ASSAULT OF CUPIDE UPON THE FORT IN WHICH THE LOVER'S HEART LAY WOUNDED <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fol. 71.</NOTE>. These two are the only pieces in our col∣lection, of which there is undoubted evidence, although no name is prefixed to either, that they were written by lord Vaux. From palpable coincidencies of style, subject, and other circum∣stances, a slender share of critical sagacity is sufficient to point out many others.</P>
<P>These three writers were cotemporaries with Surrey and Wyat: but the subjects of some of the pieces will go far in ascertaining the date of the collection in general. There is one on the death
<PB N="46" REF="150"/>
of sir Thomas Wyat the elder, who died, as I have remarked, in 1541 <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fol. 89.</NOTE>.

<P>We are to recollect, that these compliments were penned at a time, when the graces of conversation between the sexes were unknown, and the dialogue of courtship was indelicate; when the monarch of England, in a style, which the meanest gen∣tleman would now be ashamed to use, pleaded the warmth of his affection, by drawing a coarse allusion from a present of venison, which he calls flesh, in a love-letter to his future queen, Anne Boleyn, a lady of distinguished breeding, beauty, and modesty <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Hearne's AVESBURY, APPEND. p. 354.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>These reflections, resulting from a retrospect of the vigorous and active part of life, destined for nobler pursuits, and unworthily wasted in the tedious and fruitless anxieties of unsuccessful love, are highly natural, and are painted from the heart: but their force is weakened by the poet's allusions.</P>

But they belong to an elegant little ode of ten stanzas in the col∣lection before us, in which a lover complains that he is caught by the snare which he once defied <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fol. 53.</NOTE>. The unfortunate queen only quoted a distich applicable to her situation, which she re∣membered in a fashionable sett of poems, perhaps the amusement of her youth.</P>
<P>The ode, which is the comparison of the author's <HI>faithful and painful</HI> passion with that of Troilus <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fol. 81.</NOTE>, is founded on Chaucer's
<PB N="57" REF="161"/>
poem, or Boccace's, on the same subject. This was the most favorite love-story of our old poetry, and from its popularity was wrought into a drama by Shakespeare. Troilus's sufferings for Cressida were a common topic for a lover's fidelity and assi∣duity. Shakespeare, in his MERCHANT OF VENICE, compares a night favorable to the stratagems or the meditation of a lover, to such a night as Troilus might have chosen, for stealing a view of the Grecian camp from the ramparts of Troy.</P>

<P>Among these poems is a short fragment of a translation into Alexandrines of Ovid's epistle from Penelope to Ulysses <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fol. 89.</NOTE>. This is the first attempt at a metrical translation of any part of Ovid into English, for Caxton's Ovid is a loose paraphrase in prose. Nor were the heroic epistles of Ovid translated into verse till the year 1582, by George Tuberville. It is a proof that the classics were studied, when they began to be translated.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and intricate to trace the particular imita∣tions of the Italian poets, with which these anonymous poems abound. Two of the sonnets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fol. 74.</NOTE> are panegyrics on Petrarch and Laura, names at that time familiar to every polite reader, and the patterns of poetry and beauty. The sonnet on <HI>The diverse and contrarie passions of the lover</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fol. 107.</NOTE>, is formed on one of Petrarch's sonnets, and which, as I have remarked before, was translated by sir Thomas Wyat <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Supr. p. 31.</NOTE>. So many of the nobility, and principal persons about the court, writing sonnets in the Italian style, is a circumstance which must have greatly contributed to circulate this mode of composition, and to encourage the study of the Italian poets. Beside lord Surrey, sir Thomas Wyat, lord Bo∣leyn, lord Vaux, and sir Francis Bryan, already mentioned, Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und

lord Sheffield, created a baron by king Edward the sixth, and killed by a butcher in the Norfolk insurrection, is said by Bale to have written sonnets in the Italian manner <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Tanner BIBL. p. 668. Dugd. BAR. iii. 386.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that Henry lord Berners translated some of Petrarch's sonnets <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">MSS. Oldys.</NOTE>. But this nobleman otherwise de∣served notice here, for his prose works, which co-operated with the romantic genius and the gallantry of the age. He translated, and by the king's command, Froissart's chronicle, which was printed by Pinson in 1523. Some of his other tran∣slations are professed romances. He translated from the Spanish, by desire of the lady of sir Nicholas Carew, THE CASTLE OF LOVE. From the French he translated, at the request of the earl of Huntingdon, SIR HUGH OF BOURDEAUX, which be∣came exceedingly popular. And from the same language, THE HISTORY OF ARTHUR an Armorican knight. Bale says <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cent. ix. p. 706.</NOTE>, that he wrote a comedy called <HI>Ite in vineam,</HI> or the PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD, which was frequently acted at Calais, where lord Berners resided, after vespers <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 33. It is not known, whether it was in Latin or English. Stowe says, that in 1528, at Greenwich, after a grand tournament and banquet, there was the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"most goodliest Disguising or Inter∣lude in Latine, &amp;c."</Q> CHRON. p. 539. edit. fol. 1615. But possibly this may be Stowe's way of naming and describing a comedy of Plautus. See supr. vol. ii. 363.</NOTE>. He died in 1532.</P>
<P>I have also been told, that the late lord Eglintoun had a genuine book of manuscript sonnets, written by king Henry the eighth. There is an old madrigal, set to music by William Bird, supposed to be written by Henry, when he first fell in love with Anne Boleyn <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I must not forget, that a song is ascribed to Anne Boleyn, but with little probability, called her COMPLAINT. See Hawkins, HIST. MUS. iii. 32. v. 480.</NOTE>. It begins,</P>

It appears in Bird's PSALMES, SONGS, AND SONNETS, printed with musical notes, in 1611 <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See also NUGAE ANTIQUAE, ii. 248.</NOTE>. Poetry and music are congenial; and it is certain, that Henry was skilled in musical composition. Erasmus attests, that he composed some church services <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See Hawkins, HIST. MUS. ii. 533.</NOTE>: and one of his anthems still continues to be performed in the choir of Christ-church at Oxford, of his foundation. It is in an ad∣mirable style, and is for four voices. Henry, although a scho∣lar, had little taste for the classical elegancies which now began to be known in England. His education seems to have been altogether theological: and, whether it best suited his taste or his interest, polemical divinity seems to have been his favorite science. He was a patron of learned men, when they humoured his vanities; and were wise enough, not to interrupt his plea∣sures, his convenience, or his ambition.</P>

G. we are to understand Nicholas Grimoald, a name which never appeared yet in the poetical bio∣graphy of England. But I have before mentioned him inciden∣tally <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. 342.</NOTE>. He was a native of Huntingdonshire, and received the first part of his academical institution at Christ's college in Cam∣bridge. Removing to Oxford in the year 1542, he was elected fellow of Merton College: but, about 1547, having opened a rhetorical lecture in the refectory of Christ-church, then newly founded, he was transplanted to that society, which gave the greatest encouragement to such students as were distinguished for their proficiency in criticism and philology. The same year, he wrote a Latin tragedy, which probably was acted in the college, entitled, ARCHIPROPHETA, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive</HI> JOHANNES BAPTISTA, TRA∣GAEDIA, That is, <HI>The Arch-prophet,</HI> or <HI>Saint John Baptist,</HI> a tragedy, and dedicated to the dean Richard Cox <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Printed, Colon. 1548. 8vo. [See supr. vol. ii. 379.]</NOTE>. In the year 1548 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">ii Edw. vi.</NOTE>, he explained all the four books of Virgil's Georgics in a regular prose Latin paraphrase, in the public hall of his college <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Printed at London in 1591. 8vo.</NOTE>. He wrote also explanatory commentaries or lectures on the An∣dria of Terence, the Epistles of Horace, and many pieces of Cicero, perhaps for the same auditory. He translated Tully's Offices into English. This translation, which is dedicated to the learned Thirlby bishop of Ely, was printed at London,
<PB N="61" REF="165"/>
1553 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">In octavo. Again, 1574.—1596.</NOTE>. He also familiarised some of the purest Greek classics by English versions, which I believe were never printed. Among others was the CYROPAEDIA. Bale the biographer and bishop of Ossory, says, that he turned Chaucer's TROILUS into a play: but whether this piece was in Latin or English, we are still to seek: and the word <HI>Comedia,</HI> which Bale uses on this occasion, is without precision or distinction. The same may be said of what Bale calls his FAME, <HI>a comedy.</HI> Bale also recites his System of Rhetoric for the use of Englishmen <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rhetorica in usum Britannorum.</NOTE>, which seems to be the course of the rhetorical lectures I have mentioned. It is to be wished, that Bale, who appears to have been his friend <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bale cites his comment, or paraphrase on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first Eclogue of Virgil, addressed <HI>ad Amicum Joannem Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> viii. 99.</NOTE>, and therefore possessed the opportunities of information, had given us a more exact and full detail, at least of such of Grimoald's works as are now lost, or, if remaining, are unprinted <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Titles of many others of his pieces may be seen in Bale, ubi supr.</NOTE>.

And GRINDAL, 8. Fox, edit. i. 1047. And Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 178.</NOTE>. In the ecclesiastical history of Mary's reign, he appears to have been imprisoned for heresy, and to have saved his life, if not his cre∣dit, by a recantation. But theology does not seem to have been his talent, nor the glories of martyrdom to have made any part of his ambition. One of his plans, but which never took effect, was to print a new edition of Josephus Iscanus's poem on the TROJAN WAR, with emendations from the most correct manu∣scripts <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bale, ubi supr.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have taken more pains to introduce this Nicholas Grimoald to the reader's acquaintance, because he is the second English poet after lord Surrey, who wrote in blank-verse. Nor is it his

only praise, that he was the first who followed in this new path of versification. To the style of blank-verse exhibited by Surrey, he added new strength, elegance, and modulation. In the dis∣position and conduct of his cadencies, he often approaches to the legitimate structure of the improved blank-verse: but we cannot suppose, that he is entirely free from those dissonancies and asp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rities, which still adhered to the general character and state of our diction.</P>

<P>I have a suspicion, that these two pieces in blank-verse, if not fragments of larger works, were finished in their present state, as prolusions, or illustrative practical specimens, for our author's course of lectures in rhetoric. In that case, they were written so early as the year 1547. There is positive proof, that they appeared not later than 1557, when they were first printed by Tottell.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned lord Surrey's Virgil: and for the sake of juxtaposition, will here produce a third specimen of early blank-verse, little known. In the year 1590, William Vallans published a blank-verse poem, entitled, A TALE OF TWO SWANNES, which, under a poetic fiction, describes the situation and antiquities of several towns in Hertfordshire. The author, a native or inhabitant of Hertfordshire, seems to have been connected
<PB N="66" REF="170"/>
with Camden and other ingenious antiquaries of his age. I cite the exordium.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>Vallans is probably the author of a piece much better known, a history, by many held to be a romance, but which proves the writer a diligent searcher into antient records, entitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The HONOURABLE PRENTICE, Shewed in the Life and Death of Sir JOHN HAWKEWOOD sometime Prentice of London, interlaced with the famous History of the noble FITZ∣WALTER Lord of Woodham in Essex <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The founder of Dunmowe Priory, af∣terwards mentioned, in the reign of Henry the third.</NOTE>, and ofthe poisoning of his faire daughter.

<P>The reader will observe, that what has been here said about early specimens of blank-verse, is to be restrained to poems not
<PB N="67" REF="171"/>
written for the stage. Long before Vallans's TWO SWANNES, many theatrical pieces in blank-verse had appeared; the first of which is, The TRAGEDY OF GORDOBUCKE, written in 1561. The second is George Gascoigne's JOCASTA, a tragedy, acted at Grays-inn, in 1566. George Peele had also published his tragedy in blank-verse of DAVID and BETHSABE, about the year 1579 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Shakespeare did not begin writing for the stage till 1591. Jonson, about 1598.</NOTE>. HIERONYMO, a tragedy also without rhyme, was acted before 1590. But this point, which is here only tran∣siently mentioned, will be more fully considered hereafter, in its proper place. We will now return to our author Grimoald.</P>
<P>Grimoald, as a writer of verses in rhyme, yields to none of his cotemporaries, for a masterly choice of chaste expression, and the concise elegancies of didactic versification. Some of the couplets, in his poem IN PRAISE OF MODERATION, have all the smartness which marks the modern style of sententious poetry, and would have done honour to Pope's ethic epistles.</P>

<P>It would be unpardonable to dismiss this valuable miscellany, without acknowledging our obligations to its original editor Richard Tottell: who deserves highly of English literature, for having collected at a critical period, and preserved in a printed volume, so many admirable specimens of antient genius, which would have mouldered in manuscript, or perhaps from their detached and fugitive state of existence, their want of length, the capriciousness of taste, the general depredations of time, in∣attention, and other accidents, would never have reached the present age. It seems to have given birth to two favorite and celebrated collections of the same kind, THE PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES, and ENGLAND'S HELICON, which ap∣peared in the reign of queen Elisabeth <SUP>•</SUP>. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>u</SUP> The reader will observe, that I have followed the paging and arrangement of Tottell's second edition in 1565. 12mo. In his edition of 1557, there is much con∣fusion. A poem is there given to Gri∣moald, on the death of lady Margaret Lee, in 1555. Also among Grimoald's is a poem on Sir James Wilford, mentioned above, who appears to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought under Henry the eighth in the the wars ef France and Scotland. This edition, of 1557, is not in quarto, as I have called it by an oversight, but in small duodecimo, and only with signatures. It is not mentioned by Ames, and I have seen it only among Tanner's printed books at Oxford. It has this colophon. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Imprinted at London in Flete strete within Temple barre, at the sygne of the hand and starre by Richard Tottel, the sifte day of June.

<P>IT will not be supposed, that all the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth were educated in the school of Petrarch. The graces of the Italian muse, which had been taught by Surrey and Wyat, were confined to a few. Nor were the beau∣ties of the classics yet become general objects of imitation. There are many writers of this period who still rhymed on, in the old prosaic track of their immediate predecessors, and never ventured to deviate into the modern improvements. The strain of romantic fiction was lost; in the place of which, they did not substitute the elegancies newly introduced.</P>
<P>I shall consider together, yet without an exact observation of chronological order, the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth who form this subordinate class, and who do not bear any mark of the character of the poetry which distinguishes this period. Yet some of these have their degree of merit; and, if they had not necessarily claimed a place in our series, deserve examination.</P>
<P>Andrew Borde, who writes himself ANDREAS PERFORATUS, with about as much propriety and as little pedantry as Bucha∣nan calls one Wisehart SOPHOCARDIUS, was educated at Win∣chester and Oxford <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See his INTRODUCTION TO KNOW∣LEDGE, ut infr. cap. xxxv.</NOTE>; and is said, I believe on very slender proof, to have been physician to king Henry the eighth. His BRE∣VIARY OF HEALTH, first printed in 1547 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Compyled by Andrewe Boorde of Physicke Doctoure an Englysshe man."</Q> It was reprinted by William Powell in 1552, and again in 1557.

The latest is by East in 1598, 4to.</NOTE>, is dedicated to the

college of physicians, into which he had been incorporated. The first book of this treatise is said to have been examined and approved by the University of Oxford in 1546 <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">At the end of which is this Note. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeth the first bok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Examined in Oxforde in the yere of our Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> MCCCCCXLVI, &amp;c."</Q></NOTE>. He chiefly practiced in Hampshire; and being popishly affected, was cen∣sured by Poynet, a Calvinistic bishop of Winchester, for keep∣ing three prostitutes in his house, which he proved to be his pa∣tients <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Against Mart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> &amp;c. p. 48.</NOTE>. He appears to have been a man of great superstition, and of a weak and whimsical head: and having been once a Carthusian, continued ever afterwards to profess celibacy, to drink water, and to wear a shirt of hair. His thirst of know∣ledge, dislike of the reformation, or rather his unsettled dispo∣sition, led him abroad into various parts of Europe, which he visited in the medical character. Wood says, that he was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"esteemed a noted poet, a witty and ingenious person, and an excellent physician."</Q> Hearne, who has plainly discovered the origin of Tom Thumb, is of opinion, that this facetious prac∣titioner in physic gave rise to the name of MERRY ANDREW, the Fool on the mountebank's stage. The reader will not per∣haps be displeased to see that antiquary's reasons for this conjec∣ture: which are at the same time a vindication of Borde's cha∣racter, afford some new anecdotes of his life, and shew that a Merry Andrew may be a scholar and an ingenious man. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is observable, that the author [Borde] was as fond of the word DOLENTYD, as of many other hard and uncooth words, as <HI>any Quack can be.</HI> He begins his BREVIARY OF HEALTH, <HI>Egregious doctours and Maysters of the eximious and archane science of Physicke, of your urbanite exasperate not your selve,</HI> &amp;c.

his travells and visits, he often appeared and spoke in public: and would often frequent markets and fairs where a conflux of people used to get together, to whom he prescribed; and to induce them to flock thither the more readily, he would make <HI>humorous</HI> speeches, couched in such language as <HI>caused mirth,</HI> and <HI>wonderfully</HI> propagated his fame: and 'twas for the same end that he made use of such expressions in his Books, as would otherwise (the <HI>circumstances</HI> not considered) be very justly pronounced <HI>bombast.</HI> As he was <HI>versed in antiquity,</HI> he had words at command from old writers with which to amuse his hearers, which could not fail of <HI>pleasing,</HI> provided he added at the same time some <HI>remarkable explication.</HI> For in∣stance, if he told them that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was an old brass medal among the Greeks, the <HI>oddness</HI> of the word, would, <HI>without doubt,</HI> gain <HI>attention;</HI> tho nothing <HI>near so much,</HI> as if <HI>withall</HI> he <HI>signified,</HI> that 'twas a brass medal a <HI>little bigger</HI> than an Obolus, that used to be put in the mouths of persons that were dead.—And withall, 'twould <HI>affect them the more,</HI> if when he spoke of such a brass medal, he signified to them, that brass was in old time looked upon as <HI>more honourable than other metals,</HI> which he might <HI>safely enough do,</HI> from <HI>Homer</HI> and his <HI>scholiast.</HI> Homer's words are &amp;c.

The first is a satire, as it appears, on the fickle nature of an Englishman: the symbolical print prefixed to this chapter, exhibiting a naked man, with a pair of sheers in one hand and a roll of cloth in the other, not determined what sort of a coat he shall order to be made, has more humour, than any of the verses which follow <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Harrison, in his DESCRIPTION OF ENGLAND, having mentioned this work by Borde, add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Suche is our mutabi∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, that to daie there is none [equal] to the <HI>Spanish</HI> guise, to morrow the <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch</HI> toies are most fine and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lectable, yer [ere] long no such apparel as that which is after the <HI>Almaine</HI> fashion: by and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Turkish maner otherwise the <HI>Morisc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> gowns, the <HI>Barbarian</HI> sleves, the mandilion worne to Collie Weston ward, and the shorte <HI>French</HI> breeches, &amp;c."</Q> B. ii. ch. 9. p. 172.</NOTE>. Nor is the poetry destitute of humour only; but of every em∣bellishment, both of metrical arrangement and of expression.

The following lines, part of the Englishman's speech, will not prejudice the reader in his favour.</P>

Beside the BREVIARY OF HEALTH, mentioned above, and which was approved by the university of Oxford, Borde has left the DIETARIE OF HEALTH, reprinted in 1576, the PROMPTUARIE OF MEDICINE, the DOCTRINE OF URINES, and the PRINCIPLES OF ASTRONOMICAL PROGNOSTICA∣TIONS <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Princyples of Astronamye th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whiche diligently perscrutyd is in a maner a prognosti∣cacyon to the worldes ende.</HI> In thirteen chap∣ters.

<P>Of Borde's numerous books, the only one that can afford any degree of entertainment to the modern reader, is the DIE∣TARIE OF HELTHE: where, giving directions as a physician, concerning the choice of houses, diet, and apparel, and not suspecting how little he should instruct, and how much he might amuse, a curious posterity, he has preserved many anecdotes of the private life, customs, and arts, of our ancestors <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">In his rules for building or planning a House, he supposes a quadrangle.

Borde must have had no small share of vanity, who could think thus highly of his own pleasantry.

<P>John Bale, a tolerable Latin classic, and an eminent biogra∣pher, before his conversion from popery, and his advancement to the bishoprick of Ossory by king Edward the sixth, com∣posed many scriptural interludes, chiefly from incidents of the New Testament.

The Passion of Christ. The <HI>Comedie</HI> of the three Laws of Nature, Moses, and Christ, corrupted by the Sodo∣mites, Pharisees, and Papists, printed by Nicholas Bamburgh in 1538: and so popular, that it was reprinted by Colwell in 1562 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Both in quarto.

What shall we think of the state, I will not say of the stage, but of common sense, when these deplorable dramas could be

endured? Of an age, when the Bible was profaned and ridiculed from a principle of piety? But the fashion of acting mysteries appears to have expired with this writer. He is said, by him∣self, to have written a book of Hymns, and another of jests and tales: and to have translated the tragedy of PAMMACHIUS <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">CENT. viii. 100. p. 702. And Ver∣heiden, p. 149.</NOTE>; the same perhaps which was acted at Christ's college in Cam∣bridge in 1544, and afterwards laid before the privy council as a libel on the reformation <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. p. 377. Bale says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pam∣machii tragoedias transtuli."</Q></NOTE>. A low vein of abusive burlesque, which had more virulence than humour, seems to have been one of Bale's talents: two of his pamphlets against the papists, all whom he considered as monks, are entitled the MASS OF THE GLUTTONS, and the ALCORAN OF THE PRELATES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Next to exposing the impostures of popery, literary history was his favorite pursuit: and his most celebrated performance is his account of the British writers. But this work, perhaps originally undertaken by Bale as a vehicle of his sentiments in religion, is not only full of misrepresentations and partialities, arising from his religious prejudices, but of general inaccuracies, proceeding from negligence or misinformation. Even those more antient Lives which he transcribes from Leland's commentary on the same subject, are often interpolated with false facts, and imper∣tinently marked with a misapplied zeal for reformation. He is angry with many authors, who flourished before the thirteenth century, for being catholics. He tells us, that lord Cromwell fre∣quently screened him from the fury of the more bigotted bishops, on account of the comedies he had published <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Ob editas COMAEDIAS."</Q> Ubi supr.</NOTE>.

<P>In the dispersed library of the late Mr. William Collins, I saw a thin folio of two sheets in black letter, containing a poem in the octave stanza, entitled, FABYL'S GHOSTE, printed by John Rastell in the year 1533. The piece is of no merit; and I should not perhaps have mentioned it, but as the subject serves to throw light on our early drama. Peter Fabell, whose appa∣rition speaks in this poem, was called The <HI>Merrie Devil of Ed∣monton,</HI> near London. He lived in the reign of Henry the seventh, and was buried in the church of Edmonton. Weever, in his ANTIENT FUNERAL MONUMENTS, published in 1631, says under Edmonton, that in the church <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lieth interred under a seemlie tombe without inscription, the body of Peter Fa∣bell, as the report goes, upon whom this fable was fathered, that he by his wittie devises beguiled the devill.

In the Pro∣logue, Fabell is introduced, reciting his own history.</P>

<P>The play is without absurdities, and the author was evidently an attentive reader of Shakespeare. It has nothing, except the machine of the chime, in common with FABYLL'S GHOSTE.

It was printed at London in 1573. Alliteration is here carried to the most ridiculous excess: and from the constraint of ad∣hering inviolably to an identity of initials, from an affectation of coining prolix words from the Latin, and from a total ignoranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of prosodical harmony, the author has produced one of the most obscure, rough, and unpleasing pieces of versification in our language. He seems to have been a disciple of Skelton. The poem, probably from its political reference, is mentioned by Hollinshed <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. iii. p. 978.</NOTE>.

While a monk of Bury, as I pre∣sume, he wrote a metrical chemical tract, entitled, BLOME∣FIELD'S BLOSSOMS, or the CAMPE OF PHILOSOPHY. It is a vision, and in the octava stanza. It was originally written in the year 1530, according to a manuscript that I have seen: but in the copy printed by Ashmole <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Stanz. 5.</NOTE>, which has some few improve∣ments and additional stanzas, our author says he began to dream in 1557 <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Ashmole's THEATRUM CH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>MI∣CUM, p. 305. 478.</NOTE>. He is admitted into the camp of philosophy by TIME, through a superb gate which has twelve locks. Just within the entrance were assembled all the true philosophers from Hermes and Aristotle, down to Roger Bacon, and the canon of Bridlington. Detached at some distance, appear those unskilful but specious pretenders to the transmutation of metals, lame, blind, and emaciated, by their own pernicious drugs and injudicious experiments, who defrauded king Henry the fourth of immense tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asures by a counterfeit elixir. Among other wonders of this mysterious region, he sees the tree of philoso∣phy, which has fifteen different buds, bearing fifteen different fruits. Afterwards Blomfield turning protestant, did not re∣nounce his chemistry with his religion, for he appears to have dedicated to queen Elisabeth another system of occult science, entitled, THE RULE OF LIFE, OR THE FIFTH ESSENCE, with which her majesty must have been highly edified <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">MSS.

<P>Although lord Surrey and some others so far deviated from the dullness of the times, as to copy the Italian poets, the same taste does not seem to have uniformly influenced all the nobility of the court of king Henry the eighth who were fond of wri∣ting verses. Henry Parker, lord Morley, who died an old man in the latter end of that reign, was educated in the best litera∣ture which our universities afforded. Bale mentions his TRA∣GEDIES and COMEDIES, which I suspect to be nothing more
<PB N="86" REF="190"/>
than grave mysteries and moralities, and which probably would not now have been lost, had they deserved to live. He mentions also his RHYMES, which I will not suppose to have been imi∣tations of Petrarch <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">SCRIPT. BRIT. par. p. st. 103.</NOTE>. Wood says, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his younger years were adorned with all kinds of <HI>superficial</HI> learning, especially with dramatic poetry, and his elder with that which was divine <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 52.</NOTE>."</Q> It is a stronger proof of his piety than his taste, that he sent, as a new year's gift to the princess Mary, HAM∣POLE'S COMMENTARY UPON SEVEN OF THE FIRST PENI∣TENTIAL PSALMS. The manuscript, with his epistle pre∣fixed, is in the royal manuscripts of the British Museum <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">MSS. 18 B. xxi.</NOTE>. Many of Morley's translations, being dedicated either to king Henry the eighth, or to the princess M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, are preserved in manuscript in the same royal repository <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">But see MSS. GR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SHAM. 8.</NOTE>. They are chiefly from Solomon, Seneca, Erasmus, Athanasius, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, and Paulus Jovius. The authors he translated shew his track of reading. But we should not forget his attention to the classics, and that he translated also Tully's DREAM OF SCIPIO, and three or four lives of Plutarch, although not immediately from the Greek <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See MSS.

His declaration, or paraphrase, on the ninety-fourth Psalm, was printed by Berthelette in 1539.

<P>JOHN HEYWOOD, commonly called the epigrammatist, was beloved and rewarded by Henry the eighth for his buffoone∣ries. At leaving the university, he commenced author, and was countenanced by sir Thomas More for his facetious disposition. To his talents of jocularity in conversation, he joined a skill in music, both vocal and instrumental. His merriments were so irresistible, that they moved even the rigid muscles of queen Mary; and her sullen solemnity was not proof against his songs, his rhymes, and his jests. He is said to have been often invited to exercise his arts of entertainment and pleasantry in her pre∣sence, and to have had the honour to be constantly admitted into her privy-chamber for this purpose <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding his professional dissipation, Heywood appears to have lived comfortably under the smiles of royal patronage. What the FAIRY QUEEN could not procure for Spenser from the penurious Elisabeth and her precise ministers, Heywood gained by puns and conceits.</P>
<P>His comedies, most of which appeared before the year 1534, are destitute of plot, humour, or character, and give us no very high opinion of the festivity of this agreeable companion. They consist of low incident, and the language of ribaldry. But per∣fection must not be expected before its time. He is called our first writer of comedies. But those who say this, speak without determinate ideas, and confound comedies with moralities and interludes. We will allow, that he is among the first of our

<P>The work has its value and curiosity as a repertory of proverbs made at so early a period. Nor was the plan totally void of in∣genuity, to exhibit these maxims in the course of a narrative, enlivened by facts and circumstances. It certainly was susceptible of humour and invention.</P>
<P>Heywood's largest and most laboured performance is the SPI∣DER AND THE FLIE, with wooden cuts, printed at London by Thomas Powell, in 1556 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In quarto.</NOTE>. It is a very long poem in the octave stanza, containing ninety-eight chapters. Perhaps there never was so dull, so tedious, and trifling an apologue: without fancy, meaning, or moral. A long tale of fictitious manners will always be tiresome, unless the design be burlesque: and then the ridiculous, arising from the contrast between the solemn and the light, must be ingeniously supported. Our author seems to have intended a fable on the burlesque construction: but we know not when he would be serious and when witty, whether he means to make the reader laugh, or to give him advice. We must indeed acknowledge, that the age was not yet sufficiently

An old Scotch poem called SIR PENNY has been formed from this, printed in AN∣TIENT SCOTTISH POEMS, p. 153. Edinb. 1770. [See supr. vol. i. 9.]</NOTE>. Har∣rison, the author of the DESCRIPTION OF BRITAINE, prefixed
<PB N="94" REF="198"/>
to Hollinshed's Chronicle, has left a sensible criticism on this poem. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One hath made a boke of the SPIDER AND
<PB N="95" REF="199"/>

BRIT. p. 226. Hollinsh. CHRON. tom. i.</NOTE>."</Q> It is a proof of the unpopularity of this poem, that it never was reprinted. Our author's EPIGRAMS, and the poem of PRO∣VERBS, were in high vogue, and had numerous editions within the year 1598. The most lively part of the SPIDER and FLIE is perhaps the mock-fight between the spiders and flies, an awk∣ward imitation of Homer's BATRACHOMUOMACHY. The pre∣parations for this bloody and eventful engagement, on the part of the spiders, in their cobweb-castle, are thus described.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Behold! the battilments in every loope:</L>

<L>My hart shaketh at the sight: behold it is hell <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cap. 57. Signat. B b.</NOTE>!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The beginning of all this confusion is owing to a fly entering the poet's window, not through a broken pane, as might be pre∣sumed, but through the lattice, where it is suddenly entangled in a cobweb <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cap. i.</NOTE>. The cobweb, however, will be allowed to be sufficiently

descriptive of the poet's apartment. But I mention this circumstance as a probable proof, that windows of lattice, and not of glass, were now the common fashion <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>See his EPIGRAMMES. Epig. 82. FIRST HUNDRED.

<P>In the CONCLUSION to the SPIDER and FLIE, Heywood mentions queen Mary and king Philip. But as most of his pieces seem to have been written some time be∣fore, I have placed him under Henry the eighth.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Heywood died at Mechlin in Brabant about the year 1565. He was inflexibly attached to the catholic cause, and on the death of queen Mary quitted the kingdom. Antony Wood remarks <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 150.</NOTE>, with his usual acrimony, that it was a matter of wonder with many, that, considering the great and usual want of principle in the profession, a poet should become a voluntary exile for the sake of religion.</P>

<P>I KNOW not if sir Thomas More may properly be considered as an English poet. He has, however, left a few obsolete poems, which although without any striking merit, yet, as pro∣ductions of the restorer of literature in England, seem to claim some notice here. One of these is, A MERY JEST <HI>how a</HI> SERGEANT <HI>would learne to play the</HI> FREERE. <HI>Written by Maister Thomas More in hys youth</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">WORKERS, Lond. 1557. in folio.

<P>In these lines, which are intended to illustrate by familiar ex∣amples, the absurdity of a serjeant at law assuming the business of a friar, perhaps the reader perceives but little of that festi∣vity, which is supposed to have marked the character and the conversation of sir Thomas More. The last two stanzas deserve to be transcribed, as they prove, that this tale was designed to be sung to music by a minstrel, for the entertainment of company.</P>

<P>Another of sir Thomas More's juvenile poems is, A RUFULL LAMENTATION on the death of queen Elisabeth, wife of Henry the seventh, and mother of Henry the eighth, who died in childbed, in 1503. It is evidently formed on the tragical soliloquies, which compose Lydgate's paraphrase of Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, and which gave birth to the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES, the origin of our historic dramas. These stanzas are part of the queen's complaint at the approach of death.</P>

<P><PB N="101" REF="205"/>
In the fourth stanza, she reproaches the astrologers for their falsity in having predicted, that this should be the happiest and most fortunate year of her whole life. This, while it is a natural reflection in the speaker, is a proof of More's contempt of a futile and frivolous science, then so much in esteem. I have been prolix in my citation from this forgotten poem: but I am of opinion, that some of the stanzas have strokes of nature and pathos, and deserved to be rescued from total oblivion.</P>
<P>More, when a young man, contrived in an apartment of his father's house a <HI>goodly hangyng of fyne painted clothe,</HI> exhibiting nine pageants, or allegoric representations, of the stages of man's life, together with the figures of Death, Fame, Time, and Eternity. Under each picture he wrote a stanza. The first is under CHILDHOODE, expressed by a boy whipping a top.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>I am called CHILDHOD, in play is all my mynde,</L>
<L>To cast a coyte <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">A quoit.</NOTE>, a cokstele <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">A stick for throwing at a cock. STELE is handl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Sax.</HI></NOTE>, or a ball;</L>

<L>Then myght I lede my lyfe alwayes in play,</L>
<L>Which lyfe God sende me to myne endyng day.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Next was pictured MANHOD, a comely young man mounted on a fleet horse, with a hawk on his fist, and followed by two grey∣hounds, with this stanza affixed.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>MANHOD I am, therefore I me delyght</L>
<L>To hunt and hawke, to nourishe up and fede</L>
<L>The grayhounde to the course, the hawke to th' flyght,</L>
<L>And to bestryde a good and lusty stede:</L>

The personification of FAME, like RUMOUR in the Chorus to Shakespeare's HENRY THE FIFTH, is surrounded with tongues <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Sign. C. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tapestry, with metrical legends illustrating the subject, was common in this age: and the public pageants in the streets were often exhibited with explanatory verses. I am of opinion, that the COMOEDIOLAE, or little interludes, which More is said to have written and acted in his father's house, were only these nine pageants <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See supr. Vol. ii. p. 387.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another juvenile exercise of More in the English stanza, is annexed to his prose translation of the LYFE of John Picus Mirandula, and entitled, TWELVE RULES OF JOHN PICUS MIRANDULA, <HI>partely exciting partely directing a man in</HI> SPIRI∣TUAL BATAILE <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">These pieces were written in the reign of Henry the seventh. But as Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flou∣rished in the succeeding reign, I have placed them accordingly.</NOTE>.

<P>It is not my design, by these specimens, to add to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame of sir Thomas More; who is reverenced by posterity, as the scho∣lar who taught that erudition which civilised his country, and as the philosopher who met the horrours of the block with that fortitude which was equally free from ostentation and enthu∣siasm: as the man, whose genius overthrew the fabric of false learning, and whose amiable tranquillity of temper triumphed over the malice and injustice of tyranny.</P>
<P>To some part of the reign of Henry the eighth I assign the TOURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM, or <HI>The wooeing, winning, and wedding of</HI> TIBBE <HI>the Reeves Daug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter there.</HI> I presume it will not be supposed to be later than that reign: and the sub∣stance of its phraseology, which I divest of its obvious innova∣tions, is not altogether obsolete enough for a highe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> period. I am aware, that in a manuscript of the British Museum it is referred to the time of Henry the sixth. But that manuscript
<PB N="103" REF="207"/>
affords no positive indication of that date <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 5396.</NOTE>. It was published from an antient manuscript in the year 1631, and reduced to a more modern style, by William Bedwell, rector of Tottenham, and one of the translators of the Bible. He says it was written by Gilbert Pilkington, supposed to have been rector of the same parish, and author of an unknown tract, called PASSIO DOMINI JESU. But Bedwell, without the least comprehension of the scope and spirit of the piece, imagines it to be a serious narra∣tive of a real event; and, with as little sagacity, believes it to have been written before the year 1330. Allowing that it might originate from a real event, and that there might be some pri∣vate and local abuse at the bottom, it is impossible that the poet could be serious. Undoubtedly the chief merit of this poem, although not destitute of humour, consists in the design rather than the execution. As Chaucer, in the RIME OF SIR THOPAS <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I take this opportunity of observing, that the stanza of one of Laurence Minot's poems on the wars of Edward the third, is the same as Chaucer's SIR TOPAS.

OF TOTTENHAM is a burlesque on the parade and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op∣peries of chivalry itself. In this light, it may be considered as a curiosity; and does honour to the good sense and discernment of the writer, who seeing through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly of these fashionable ex∣ercises, was sensible at the same time, that they were too popular to be attacked by the more solid weapons of reason and argument. Even on a supposition that here is an allusion to real facts and characters, and that it was intended to expose some popular story of the amours of the daughter of the Reve of Tottenham, we must acknowledge that the satire is conveyed in an ingenious mode. He has introduced a parcel of clowns and rustics, the inhabitants of Tottenham, Islington, Highgate, and Hackney, places then not quite so polished as at present, who imitate all
<PB N="105" REF="209"/>
the solemnities of the barriers. The whole is a mock-parody on the challenge, the various events of the encounter, the exhibi∣tion of the prize, the devices and escocheons, the display of arms, the triumphant procession of the conqueror, the oath before the combat, and the splendid feast which followed, with every other ceremony and circumstance which constituted the regular tournament.

<P>It appears to me, that the author, to give dignity to his nar∣rative, and to heighten the ridicule by stiffening the familiarity of his incidents and characters, has affected an antiquity of style. This I could prove from the cast of its fundamental diction and idiom, with which many of the old words do not agree. Perhaps another of the author's affectations is the alli∣terative manner. For although other specimens of alliteration, in smaller pieces, are now to be found, yet it was a singularity. To those which I have mentioned, of this reign, I take this opportunity of adding an alliterative poem, which may be called the FALCON AND THE PIE, who support a DYALOGUE DE∣SENSYVE FOR WOMEN AGAYNST MALICYOUS DETRAC∣TOURS, printed in 1542 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>Coloph. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus endeth the faucon and pie anno dni 1542.

<P>It is a piece of considerable length, and contains a variety of GESTS. Sir YWAIN is sir EWAINE, or OW<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>N, in MORTE ARTHUR. None of these adven∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res belong to that romance. But see B. iv. c. 17. 27. etc. The story of the lion and the dragon in this romance, is told of a Christian champion in the Holy War, by Berchorius, RE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>UCTOR. p. 661. See supr. DISS. p. lxxxvii. And GEST. ROMANOR. ch. civ. The lion being delivered from the dragon by sir YWAIN, ever after∣wards accompanies and defends him in the greatest dangers. Hence Spenser's Una attended by a lion. F. QU. i. iii. 7. See sir Percival's lion in MORTE ARTHUR, B. xiv. c. 6. The dark ages had many stories and traditions of the lion's grati∣tude and generosity to man. Hence in Shakespeare, Troilus says, TR.

There is a statute, made in 1337, prohi∣biting any under 100l. per annum, to wear fur. I suppose the richest fur was Ermine; which, before the manufactures of gold and silver, was the greatest article of finery in dress. But it continued in use long after∣wards, as appears by antient portraits. In the Statutes of Cardinal Wolsey's College at Oxford, given in the year 1525, the students are enjoned, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne magis pretiosis aut sumptuosis utantur PELLIBUS."</Q> De VESTITU, &amp;c. fol. 49. MSS. Cott. TIT. F. iii. This injunction is a proof that rich furs were at that time a luxury of the secular life. In an old poem written in the reign of Henry the sixth, about 1436, entitled the ENGLISH POLICIE, <HI>exhorting all England to keepe the sea,</HI> a curious and valuable record of the state of our traffick and mercantile navigation at that period, it appears that our trade with Ireland, for furs only, was then very considerable. Speaking of Ireland, the writer says,</P>

See more instances supr. vol. i. 60. That ALE is <HI>festival,</HI> appears from its sense in composition; as, among others, in the word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Leet-ale, Lamb-ale, Whitson-ale, Clerk∣ale, and Church-ale. LEET-ALE, in some parts of England, signifies the Dinner at a court-leet of a manor for the jury and cus∣tomary tenants. LAMB-ALE is still used at the village of Kirtlington in Oxfordshire, for an annual feast or celebrity at lamb∣shearing. WHITSON-ALE, is the common name in the midland counties, for the ru∣ral sports and feasting at Whit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontide. CLERK-ALE occurs in Aubrey's manu∣script History of WILTSHIRE. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the Easter holidays was the CLARKES-ALE, for his private benefit and the solace of the neighbourhood."</Q> MSS. Mus. ASHM. Oxon. CHURCH-ALE, was a feast esta∣blished for the repair of the church, or in honour of the church-saint, &amp;c. In Dods∣worth's Manuscripts, there is an old in∣denture, made before the Reformation, which not only shews the design of the Church-ale, but explains this particular use and application of the word Ale. The parishioners of Elveston and Okebrook, in Derbyshire, agree jointly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to brew four ALES, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd every ALE of one quar∣ter of malt, betwixt this and the feast of saint John Baptist next coming.

And the inhabi∣tants of Elveston shall brew eight ALES betwixt this and the feast of saint John Baptist, at the which ALES the inhabi∣tants of Okebrook shall come and pay as before rehersed.

The ap∣plication of what is here collected to the word BRIDALE, is obvious. But Mr. Astle has a curious record, about 1575, which proves the BRIDE-ALE synonimous with the WEDDYN-ALE. During the course of queen Elisabeth's entertainments at Kenilworth∣castle, in 1575, a BRYDE-ALE was cele∣brated with a great variety of shews and sports. Laneham's LETTER, dated the same year. fol. xxvi. seq. What was the nature of the merriment of the CHURCH∣ALE, we learn from the WITCHES-SONG in Jonson's MASQUE OF QUEENS at Whitehall in 1609, where one of the Witches boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts to have killed and stole the fat of an infant, begotten by a piper at a CHURCH-ALE.

<P>The writing of this manuscript of LAUN∣VAL seems about 1300. The composition is undoubtedly much earlier. There is another, MSS. HARL. 978. §. 112. This I have cited in the FIRST DISSERTATION.

<P>I presume this romance of YWAYN and GAWAYNE is translated from a French one of the same title, and in the reign of Henry the sixth; but not by Thomas Chestre, who translated, or rather para∣phrased, LAUNVAL, or Sir LAUNFALL, and who seems to have been master of a more copious and poetic style.

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>I FEAR I shall be pronounced a heretic to modern criticism, in retracting what I have said in a preceding page, and in placing the NOTBROWNE MAYDE under some part of this reign. Prior, who, about the year 1718, paraphrased this poem, without improving its native beauties, supposes it to have been three hundred years old. It appears from two letters preserved in the British Museum, written by Prior to Wanley, lord Oxford's librarian, that Prior consulted Wanley about this antient ballad <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 3777.</NOTE>. It is, however, certain, that Wanley, an antiquarian of unques∣tionable skill and judgement in these niceties, whatever directions and information he might have imparted to Prior on this subject, could never have communicated such a decision. He certainly in these letters gives no such opinion <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">These letters are printed in the AD∣DITIONS TO POPE'S WORKS, in two vo∣lumes, published about two years ago.</NOTE>. This is therefore the hasty conjecture of Prior; who thought that the curiosity which he was presenting to the world, would derive proportionable value from its antiquity, who was better employed than in the petty labour of ascertaining dates, and who knew much more of modern than antient poetry.</P>
<P>The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE first appeared in Arnolde's CHRONICLE, or CUSTOMS OF LONDON, which was first printed about the year 1521. This is perhaps the most heterogeneous and multifarious miscellany that ever existed. The collector sets out with a catalogue of the mayors and sheriffs, the customs and charters, of the city of London. Soon afterwards we have
<PB N="136" REF="240"/>
receipts to pickle sturgeon, to make vinegar, ink, and gun∣powder; how to raise parsley in an hour; the arts of brewery and soap-making; an estimate of the livings in London; an account of the last visitation of saint Magnus's church; the weight of Essex cheese, and a letter to cardinal Wolsey. The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE is introduced, between an estimate of some subsidies paid into the exchequer, and directions for buying goods in Flanders. In a word, it seems to have been this com∣piler's plan, by way of making up a volume, to print together all the notices and papers, whether antient or modern, which he could amass, of every sort and subject. It is supposed, that he intended an antiquarian repertory: but as many recent mate∣rials were admitted, that idea was not at least uniformly ob∣served; nor can any argument be drawn from that supposition, that this poem existed long before, and was inserted as a piece of antiquity.</P>
<P>The editor of the PROLUSIONS infers <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">PROLUSIONS, or <HI>select pieces of antient Poetry,</HI> Lond. 1760. 4to. Pref. p. vii.</NOTE>, from an identity of rhythmus and orthography, and an affinity of words and phrases, that this poem appeared after sir Thomas More's JEST OF THE SERJEANT AND FREER, which, as I have observed, was writ∣ten about the year 1500. This reasoning, were not other argu∣ments obvious, would be inconclusive, and might be turned to the opposite side of the question. But it is evident from the language of the NOTBROWNE MAYDE, that it was not written earlier than the beginning, at least, of the sixteenth century. There is hardly an obsolete word, or that requires a glossary, in the whole piece: and many parts of Surry and Wyat are much more difficult to be understood. Reduce any two stanzas to modern orthography, and they shall hardly wear the appearance of antient poetry. The reader shall try the experiment on the two following, which occur accidentally <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">V. 168.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>What degree of credit this poem maintained among our earlier ancestors, I cannot determine. I suspect the sentiment was too refined for the general taste. Yet it is enumerated among the popular tales and ballads by Laneham, in his narrative of queen Elisabeth's entertainment at Kenilworth-castle in 1575 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol. 34<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. I have never seen it in manuscript. I believe it was never reprinted from Arnolde's Chronicle, where it first appeared in 1521, till so late as the year 1707. It was that year revived in a collec∣tion called the MONTHLY MISCELLANY, or MEMO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RS FOR THE CURIOUS, and prefaced with a little essay on our antient poets and poetry, in which it is said to have been three hundred old. Fortunately for modern poetry, this republication suggested it to the notice of Prior, who perhaps from the same source might
<PB N="140" REF="244"/>
have adopted or confirmed his hypothesis, that it was coeval with the commencement of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>Whoever was the original inventor of this little dramatic dia∣logue, he has shewn no common skill in contriving a plan, which powerfully detains our attention, and interests the pas∣sions, by a constant succession of suspence and pleasure, of anxiety and satisfaction. Betwixt hopes perpetually disappointed, and solicitude perpetually relieved, we know not how to determine the event of a debate, in which new difficulties still continue to be raised, and are almost as soon removed. In the midst of this vicissitude of feelings, a striking contrast of character is artfully formed, and uniformly supported, between the seeming unkind∣ness and ingratitude of the man, and the unconquerable attach∣ment and fidelity of the woman, whose amiable compliance un∣expectedly defeats every objection, and continually furnishes new matter for our love and compassion. At length, our fears subside in the triumph of suffering innocence and patient sincerity. The Man, whose hard speeches had given us so much pain, suddenly surprises us with a change of sentiment, and becomes equally an object of our admiration and esteem. In the disentan∣glement of this distressful tale, we are happy to find, that all his cruelty was tenderness, and his inconstancy the most invari∣able truth; his levity an ingenious artifice, and his perversity the friendly disguise of the firmest affection. He is no longer an unfortunate exile, the profligate companion of the thieves and ruffians of the forest, but an opulent earl of Westmoreland; and promises, that the lady, who is a baron's daughter, and whose constancy he had proved by such a series of embarrassing proposals, shall instantly be made the partner of his riches and honours. Nor should we forget to commend the invention of the poet, in imagining the modes of trying the lady's patience, and in feigning so many new situations: which, at the same time, open a way to description, and to a variety of new scenes and images.</P>
<P>I cannot help observing here, by the way, that Prior has misconceived
<PB N="141" REF="245"/>
and essentially marred his poet's design, by softening the sternness of the Man, which could not be intended to admit of any degree of relaxation. Henry's hypocrisy is not charac∣teristically nor consistently sustained. He frequently talks in too respectful and complaisant a style. Sometimes he calls Emma my <HI>tender maid,</HI> and my <HI>beauteous Emma;</HI> he fondly dwells on the ambrosial plenty of her flowing ringlets gracefully wreathed with variegated ribbands, and expatiates with rapture on the charms of her snowy bosom, her slender waist, and harmony of shape. In the antient poem, the concealed lover never abates his affectation of rigour and reserve, nor ever drops an expres∣sion which may tend to betray any traces of tenderness. He retains his severity to the last, in order to give force to the conclusion of the piece, and to heighten the effect of the final declaration of his love. Thus, by diminishing the opposition of interests, and by giving too great a degree of uniformity to both characters, the distress is in some measure destroyed by Prior. For this reason, Henry, during the course of the dia∣logue, is less an object of our aversion, and Emma of our pity. But these are the unavoidable consequences of Prior's plan, who presupposes a long connection between the lovers, which is at∣tended with the warmest professions of a reciprocal passion. Yet this very plan suggested another reason, why Prior should have more closely copied the cast of his original. After so many mutual promises and protestations, to have made Henry more obdurate, would have enhanced the sufferings and the sincerity of the amiable Emma.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that the metrical romances of RICHARD CUER DE LYON, GUY EARL OF WARWICK, and SYR BEVYS OF SOUTHAMPTON, were modernised in this reign from more an∣tient and simple narrations.

<P>In the year 1540, Thomas lord Cromwell, during the short

interval which Henry's hasty passion for Catharine Howard per∣mitted between his commitment and execution, was insulted in a ballad written by a defender of the declining cause of popery, who certainly shewed more zeal than courage, in reproaching a disgraced minister and a dying man. This satire, however un∣seemly, gave rise to a religious controversy in verse, which is preserved in the archives of the antiquarian society.</P>
<P>I find a poem of thirty octave stanzas, printed in 1546, called the DOWFAL OF ANTICHRISTES MAS, or Mass, in which the nameless satirist is unjustly severe on the distresses of that inge∣nious class of mechanics who got their living by writing and or∣namenting service-books for the old papistic worship, now grow∣ing into decay and disuse; insinuating at the same time, in a strain of triumph, the great blow their <HI>craft</HI> had received, by the diminution of the number of churches in the dissolution of the monasteries <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">In a roll of John Morys, warden of Winchester college, an. xx Ric. ii.

<P>Many ample and authentic records of the royal houshold of France, of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, written on waxen tablets, are still preserved. Waxen tablets were constantly kept in the French reli∣gious houses, for the same purpose as at Winchester college. Thus in the Ordinary of the Priour of saint Lo at Rouen, printed at Rouen, written about the year 1250. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Qui, ad missam, lectiones aut tractus dicturi sunt, in tabula cerea primitus re∣citentur."</Q> pag. 261. Even to this day, several of the collegiate bodies in France, more especially the chapter of the cathe∣dral of Rouen, retain this usage of mark∣ing the successive rotation of the ministers of the choir. See the Sieur le Brun's VOYAGE LITURGIQUE, 1718. p. 275. The same mode of writing was used for registering the capitular acts of the monas∣teries in France. Du Cange, in reciting from an antient manuscript the <HI>Signs</HI> in∣joined to the monks of the order of saint Victor at Paris, where the rule of silence was rigorously observed, gives us, among others, the tacit signals by which they call∣ed for the style and tablet. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Pro</HI> SIGNO <HI>Grafii.</HI>—Signo metalli praemisso, extenso pollice cum indice simila [simula] scri∣bentem. <HI>Pro</HI> SIGNO <HI>Tabularum.</HI>—Manus ambas complica, et ita disjunge quasi aperiens Tabulas."</Q> GLOSS. ut supr.

These sta∣tutes were given in 1301. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Habeat ita∣que idem praecentor unam Tabulam semper in capella appensam, in qua scribat quolib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t die sabbati post pran∣dium, et ordinet, qualem Missam quis corum capellanorum in sequenti septi∣mana debeat celebrare; quis qualem lec∣tionem in crastino legere debeat; Et sic de caeteris divinis officiis in praedicta ca∣pella faciendis.

MONAST. tom. iii. ECCLES. COLL. i. 10. Nothing could have been a more convenient method of temporary notation, especially at a time when parchment and paper were neither cheap nor common commodities, and of carrying on an ac∣count, which was perpetually to be obli∣terated and renewed: for the written sur∣face of the wax being easily smoothed by the round or blunt end of the style, was soon again prepared for the admission of new characters. And among the Romans, the chief use of the style was for fugitive and occasional entries. In the same light, we must view the following parallel pas∣sage of the Ordination of bishop Wyke∣ham's sepulchral chantry, founded in Win∣chester cathedral, in the year 1404. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Die sabbati cujuslibet septimanae futurae, mo∣nachi prioratus nostri in ordine sacerdo∣tali constituti, valentes et dispositi ad celebrandum, ordinentur et intitulentur in Tabula seriatim ad celebrandum Mis∣sas praedictas cotidie per septimanam tunc sequentem, &amp;c."</Q> B.

will select an instance, among others, from the shews exhibited with great magnificence at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn, in the year 1533. The procession to Westminster abbey, began from the Tower; and the queen, in passing through Grace∣church street, was entertained with a representation of mount Parnassus. The fountain of Helicon, by a bold fiction unknown to the bards of antiquity, ran in four streams of Rhenish wine from a bason of white marble. On the summit of the moun∣tain sate Apollo, and at his feet Calliope. On either side of the declivity were arranged four of the Muses, playing on their respective
<PB N="153" REF="257"/>
musical instruments. Under them were written epi∣grams and poesies in golden letters, in which every Muse praised the queen, according to her character and office. At the Conduit in Cornhill appeared the three Graces; before whom, with no great propriety, was the spring of <HI>Grace</HI> perpetually running wine. But when a conduit came in the way, a religious allusion was too tempting and obvious to be omitted. Before the spring, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate a poet, describing in metre the properties or func∣tions of every Grace: and then each of these four Graces allotted
<PB N="154" REF="258"/>
in a short speech to the queen, the virtue or accomplish∣ment over which she severally presided. At the Conduit in Cheapside, as my chronicler says, she was saluted with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a rich pageaunt full of melodie and song."</Q> In this pageant were Pallas, Juno, and Venus: before them stood Mercury, who pre∣sented to her majesty, in the name of the three goddesses, a golden ball or globe divided into three parts, signifying wisdom, riches, and felicity. At entering saint Paul's <HI>gate,</HI> an antient portal leading into the church-yard on the east, and long since destroyed, three ladies richly attired showered on her head wafers, in which were contained Latin distichs. At the eastern side of saint Paul's Church-yard, two hundred scholars of saint Paul's School, addressed her in chosen and apposite passages from the Roman poets, translated into English rhymes. On the leads of saint Martin's church stood a choir of boys and men, who sung, not spiritual hymns, but <HI>new balads</HI> in praise of her ma∣jesty. On the conduit without Ludgate, where the arms and angels had been <HI>refreshed,</HI> was erected a tower with four turrets, within each of which was placed a Cardinal Virtue, symboli∣cally habited. Each of these personages in turn uttered an ora∣tion, promising to protect and accompany the queen on all occa∣sions <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hall's CHRONICLE, fol. ccxii. Among the Orations spoken to the Queen, is one too curious to be omitted. At Leaden∣hall sate saint Anne with her numerous progeny, and Mary Cleophas with her four children.

Here we see the pagan history and mythology predomi∣nating in those spectacles, which were once furnished from the Golden Legend. Instead of saints, prophets, apostles, and con∣fessors, we have Apollo, Mercury, and the Muses. Instead of religious canticles, and texts of scripture, which were usually introduced in the course of these ceremonies, we are entertained with profane poetry, translations from the classics, and occasional verses; with exhortations, not delivered by personified doctors of the church, but by the heathen divinities.</P>

It may not be foreign to our purpose, to give the reader some distinct idea of the polite amusements of this reign, among which, the Masque, already mentioned in general terms, seems to have held the first place. It chiefly consisted of music, dancing, gaming, a banquet, and a display of grotesque personages and fantastic dresses. The performers, as I have hinted, were often the king, and the chief of the nobility of both sexes, who under proper disguises executed some preconcerted strategem, which ended in mirth and good humour. With one of these shews, in 1530, the king formed a scheme to surprise cardinal Wolsey, while he was celebrating a splendid banquet at his palace of Whitehall <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">It th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n belonged to Wolsey.</NOTE>. At night his majesty in a masque, with twelve more masquers all richly but strangely dressed, privately landed from Westminster at Whitehall stairs. At landing, several small pieces of canon were fired, which the king had before ordered to be placed on the shore near the house. The cardinal, who was sepa∣rately seated at the banquet in the presence-chamber under the cloth of state, a great number of ladies and lords being seated at the side-tables, was alarmed at this sudden and unusual noise: and immediately ordered lord Sandys, the king's chamberlain, who was one of the guests, and in the secret, to enquire the reason. Lord Sandys brought answer, that thirteen foreign no∣blemen of distinction were just arrived, and were then waiting in the great hall below; having been drawn thither by the re∣port of the cardinal's magnificent banquet, and of the beautiful ladies which were present at it. The cardinal ordered them immediately into the banquetting-room, to which they were conducted from the hall with twenty new torches and a concert of drums and fifes. After a proper refreshment, they requested in the French language to dance with the ladies, whom they kissed, and to play with them at mum-chance <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">A game of hazard with dic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; producing at the same time a great golden cup filled with many hundred crowns. Having played for sometime with the ladies, they de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignedly
<PB N="156" REF="260"/>
lost all that remained in the cup to the cardinal; whose sagacity was not easily to be deceived, and who now began, from some circumstances, to suspect one of them to be the king. On finding their plot in danger, they answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If your grace can point him out, he will readily discover himself."</Q> The cardinal pointed to a masque with a black beard, but he was mistaken, for it was sir Edward Nevil. At this, the king could not forbear laughing aloud: and pulling off his own and sir Edward Nevil's masque, convinced the cardinal, with much arch complaisance, that he had for once guessed wrong. The king and the masquers then retired into another apartment to change their apparel: and in the meantime the banquet was re∣moved, and the table covered afresh with perfumed clothes. Soon afterwards the king, with his company, returned, and took his seat under the cardinal's canopy of state. Immediately two hundred dishes of the most costly cookery and confectionary were served up; the contrivance and success of the royal joke afforded much pleasant conversation, and the night was spent in dancing, dice-playing, <HI>banketting and other triumphs</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hollinsh. CHRON. iii. 921. seq.</NOTE>. The old chronicler Edward Hall, a cotemporary and a curious observer, acquaints us, that at Greenwich, in 1512, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"on the daie of the Epiphanie at night, the king with eleven others was disguised after the maner of Italie, called a Maske, a thing not seene before in England: they were apparalled in garments long and broad, wrought all with gold, with visors and caps of gold. And after the banket doone, these maskers came in, with six gentlemen disguised in silke, bearing staffe-torches and desired the ladies to danse; some were content, and some refused; and after they had dansed and communed togither, as the fashion of the maske is, they tooke their leave and de∣parted, and so did the queene and all the ladies <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">CHRON. fol. xv.

<P>I do not find that it was a part of their diversion in these en∣tertainments to display humour and character. Their chief aim
<PB N="157" REF="261"/>
seems to have been, to surprise, by the ridiculous and exag∣gerated oddity of the visors, and by the singularity and splendor of the dresses. Every thing was out of nature and propriety. Frequently the Masque was attended with an exhibition of some gorgeous machinery, resembling the wonders of a modern pan∣tomime. For instance, in the great hall of the palace, the usual place of performance, a vast mountain covered with tall trees arose suddenly, from whose opening caverns issued hermits, pilgrims, shepherds, knights, damsels, and gypsies, who being regaled with spices and wine danced a morisco, or morris-dance. They were then again received into the mountain, which with a symphony of rebecs and recorders closed its caverns; and tumbling to pieces, was replaced by a ship in full sail, or a castle besieged. To be more particular. The following device was shewn in the hall of the palace at Greenwich. A castle was reared, with numerous towers, gates, and battlements; and fur∣nished with every military preparation for sustaining a long siege. On the front was inscribed <HI>Le fortresse dangereux.</HI> From the windows looked out six ladies, cloathed in the richest russet sattin, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"laid all over with leaves of gold, and every one knit with laces of blew silk and gold, on their heads coi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and caps all of golde."</Q> This castle was moved about the hall; and when the queen had viewed it for a time, the king entered the hall with five knights, in embroidered vestments, spangled and plated with gold, of the most curious and costly workmanship. They assaulted the castle; and the six ladies, finding them to be champions of redoubted prowess, after a parley, yielded their perilous fortress, descended, and danced with their assailants. The ladies then led the knights into the castle, which imme∣diately vanished, and the company retired <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hollinsh. iii. 812<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. Here we see the representation of an action. But all these magnificent mum∣meries, which were their evening-amusements on festivals, not∣withstanding a parley, which my historian calls a <HI>communication,</HI>

See Hall, CHRON. fol. lxvi. This was in 1512. But in the year 1509, a more ra∣tional evening-amusement took place in the Hall of the old Westminster-palace, several foreign embassadors being present. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After supper, his grace [the king] with the queene, lords, and ladies, came into the White Hall, which was hanged richlie; the hall was scaffolded and rail∣ed on all parts.

<P>But towards the latter part of Henry's reign, much of the old cumbersome state began to be laid aside. This I collect from a set of new regulations given to the royal houshold about the year 1526, by cardinal Wolsey. In the Chapter <HI>For keeping the Hall and ordering of the Chapel,</HI> it is recited, that by the frequent intermission and disuse of the solemnities of dining and supping in the great hall of the palace, the proper officers had almost forgot their duty, and the manner of conducting that very long and intricate ceremonial. It is therefore ordered, that when his majesty is not at Westminster, and with regard to his palaces in the country, the formalities of the Hall, which ought not en∣tirely to fall into desuetude, shall be at least observed, when he is at Windsor, Beaulieu, or Newhall <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">A new house built by Henry the eighth. Hollinsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> CHRON. iii. 852.</NOTE>, in Essex, Richmond, Hamp∣ton-court, Greenwich, Eltham, and Woodstock. And that at these places only, the whole choir of the chapel shall attend. This attempt to revive that which had began to cease from the nature of things, and from the growth of new manners, per∣haps had but little or no lasting effect. And with respect to the Chapel, my record adds, that when the king is on journies or progresses, only six singing boys and six gentlemen of the choir shall make a part of the royal retinue; who <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"daylie in absence of <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esidue</HI> of the chapel shall have a Masse of our Ladie bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore noon, and on Sondaies and holidaies, masse of the day besides our Lady-masse, and an anthempne in the afternoone:

<P>The same connection subsists between the state of poetry and of the arts; to which we may now recall the reader's attention with as little violation of our general subject.</P>
<P>We are taught in the mythology of the antients, that the three Graces were produced at a birth. The meaning of the fable is, that the three most beautiful imitative arts were born and grew up together. Our poetry now beginning to be divested of its mo∣nastic barbarism, and to advance towards elegance, was accompa∣nied by proportionable improvements in Painting and Music. Henry employed many capital painters, and endeavoured to invite Raphael and Titian into England. Instead of allegorical tapestry, many of the royal apartments were adorned with historical pic∣tures. Our familiarity with the manners of Italy, and affecta∣tion of Italian accomplishments, influenced the tones and enriched
<PB N="160" REF="264"/>
the modulation of our musical composition. Those who could read the sonnets of Petrarch must have relished the airs of Palestrina. At the same time, Architecture, like Milton's lion <HI>pawing to get free,</HI> made frequent efforts to disentangle itself from the massy incumbrances of the Gothic manner; and began to catch the correct graces, and to copy the true mag∣nificence, of the Grecian and Roman models. Henry was himself a great builder; and his numerous edifices, although constructed altogether on the antient system, are sometimes in∣terspersed with chaste ornaments and graceful mouldings, and often marked with a legitimacy of proportion, and a purity of design, before unattempted. It was among the literary plans of Leland, one of the most classical scholars of this age, to write an account of Henry's palaces, in imitation of Procopius, who is said to have described the palaces of the emperor Justinian. Frequent symptoms appeared, that perfection in every work of taste was at no great distance. Those clouds of ignorance which yet remained, began now to be illuminated by the approach of the dawn of truth.</P>

<P>THE reformation of our church produced an alteration for a time in the general system of study, and changed the character and subjects of our poetry. Every mind, both learned and unlearned, was busied in religious speculation; and every pen was employed in recommending, illustrating, and familiari∣sing the Bible, which was now laid open to the people.</P>
<P>The poetical annals of king Edward the sixth, who removed those chains of bigottry which his brother Henry had only loosened, are marked with metrical translations of various parts of the sacred scripture. Of these the chief is the versification of the Psalter by Sternhold and Hopkins: a performance, which has acquired an importance, and consequently claims a place in our series, not so much from any merit of its own, as from the circumstances with which it is connected.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary, that the protestant churches should be in∣debted to a country in which the reformation had never begun to make any progress, and even to the indulgence of a society which remains to this day the grand bulwark of the catholic theology, for a very distinguishing and essential part of their ritual.</P>
<P>About the year 1540, Clement Marot, a valet of the bed∣chamber to king Francis the first, was the favorite poet of France. This writer, having attained an unusual elegance and facility of style, added many new embellishments to the rude state of the French poetry. It is not the least of his praises, that La Fontaine used to call him his master. He was the inventor
<PB N="162" REF="266"/>
of the rondeau, and the restorer of the madrigal: but he became chiefly eminent for his pastorals, ballads, fables, elegies, epi∣grams, and translations from Ovid and Petrarch. At length, being tired of the vanities of profane poetry, or rather privately tinctured with the principles of Lutheranism, he attempted, with the assistance of his friend Theodore Beza, and by the en∣couragement of the professor of Hebrew in the university of Paris, a version of David's Psalms into French rhymes. This translation, which did not aim at any innovation in the public worship, and which received the sanction of the Sorbonne as containing nothing contrary to sound doctrine, he dedicated to his master Francis the first, and to the Ladies of France. In the dedication to the Ladies or <HI>les Dames de France,</HI> whom he had often before addressed in the tenderest strains of passion or com∣pliment, he seems anxious to deprecate the raillery which the new tone of his versification was likely to incur, and is embar∣rassed how to find an apology for turning saint. Conscious of his apostacy from the levities of life, in a spirit of religious gallantry, he declares that his design is to add to the happiness of his fair readers, by substituting divine hymns in the place of <HI>chansons d' amour,</HI> to inspire their susceptible hearts with a passion in which there is no torment, to banish that fickle and fantastic deity CUPID from the world, and to fill their apartments with the praises, not of the <HI>little god,</HI> but of the true Jehovah.</P>

<P>He adds, that the golden age would now be restored, when we should see, the peasant at his plough, the carman in the streets, and the mechanic in his shop, solacing their toils with psalms and canticles: and the shepherd and sheperdess, reposing in the shade, and teaching the rocks to echo the name of the Creator.</P>

<P>Marot's Psalms soon eclipsed the brilliancy of his madrigals and sonnets. Not suspecting how prejudicial the predominant rage of psalm-singing might prove to the antient religion of Europe, the catholics themselves adopted these sacred songs as serious ballads, and as a more rational species of domestic merri∣ment. Thy were the common accompaniments of the fiddle. They were sold so rapidly, that the printers could not supply the public with copies. In the festive and splendid court of Francis the first, of a sudden nothing was heard but the psalms of Clement Marot. By each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court a psalm was chosen, and fitted to the ballad-tune which each liked best. The dauphin prince Henry, who delighted in hunting, was fond of <HI>Ainsi qu'on oit le cerf bruire,</HI> or, <HI>Like as the Hart desireth the water-brooks,</HI> which he constantly sung in going out to the chase. Madame de Valenti∣nois, between whom and the young prince there was an attach∣ment, took <HI>Du fond de ma pensée,</HI> or, <HI>From the depth of my heart, O Lord.</HI> The queen's favorite was, <HI>Ne uveilles pas, O Sire,</HI> that is, <HI>O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation,</HI> which she sung to a fashionable jig. Antony king of Navarre sung, <HI>Revenge moy, pren le querelle,</HI> or, <HI>Stand up, O Lord, to revenge my quarrel,</HI> to

the air of a dance of Poitou <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Bayle'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> DICT. V. MAROT.</NOTE>. It was on very different princi∣ples that psalmody flourished in the gloomy court of Cromwell. This fashion does not seem in the least to have diminished the gaiety and good humour of the court of Francis.</P>
<P>At this period John Calvin, in opposition to the discipline and doctrines of Rome, was framing his novel church at Ge∣neva: in which the whole substance and form of divine worship was reduced to praying, preaching, and singing. In the last of these three, he chose to depart widely from the catholic usage: and, either because he thought that novelty was sure to succeed, that the practice of antiphonal chanting was superstitious, or that the people were excluded from bearing a part in the more solemn and elaborate performance of ecclesiastical music, or that the old papistic hymns were unedifying, or that verse was better remembered than prose, he projected, with the advice of Luther, a species of religious song, consisting of portions of the psalms intelligibly translated into the vernacular language, and adapted to plain and easy melodies, which all might learn, and in which all might join. This scheme, either by design or acci∣dent, was luckily seconded by the publication of Marot's metri∣cal psalms at Paris, which Calvin immediately introduced into his congregation at Geneva. Being set to simple and almost mo∣notonous notes by Guillaume de Franc, they were soon estab∣lished as the principal branch in that reformer's new devotion, and became a characteristical mark or badge of the Calvinistic worship and profession. Nor were they sung only in his churches. They exhilarated the convivial assemblies of the Calvinists, were commonly heard in the streets, and accompanied the labours of the artificer. The weavers and woollen manufacturers of Flanders, many of whom left the loom and entered into the ministry, are said to have been the capital performers into this science. At length Marot's psalms formed an appendix to the catechism of Geneva, and were interdicted to the catholics under the most
<PB N="165" REF="269"/>
severe penalties. In the language of the orthodox, psalm-singing and heresy were synonimous terms.</P>
<P>It was Calvin's system of reformation, not only to strip reli∣gion of its superstitious and ostensible pageantries, of crucifixes, images, tapers, superb vestments, and splendid processions, but of all that was estimable in the sight of the people, and even of every simple ornament, every significant symbol, and decent ceremony; in a word, to banish every thing from his church which attracted or employed the senses, or which might tend to mar the purity of an abstracted adoration, and of a mental in∣tercourse with the deity. It is hard to determine, how Calvin could reconcile the use of singing, even when purged from the corruptions and abuses of popery, to so philosophical a plan of worship. On a parallel principle, and if any artificial aids to devotion were to be allowed, he might at least have retained the use of pictures in the church. But a new sect always draws its converts from the multitude and the meanest of the people, who can have no relish for the more elegant externals. Calvin well knew that the manufacturers of Germany were no judges of pictures. At the same time it was necessary that his congrega∣tion should be kept in good humour by some kind of pleasurable gratification and allurement, which might qualify and enliven the attendance on the more rigid duties of praying and preach∣ing. Calvin therefore, intent as he was to form a new church on a severe model, had yet too much sagacity to exclude every auxiliary to devotion. Under this idea, he permitted an exercise, which might engage the affections, without violating the simpli∣city of his worship: and sensible that his chief resources were in the rabble of a republic, and availing himself of that natural propensity which prompts even vulgar minds to express their more animated feelings in rhyme and music, he conceived a mode of universal psalmody, not too refined for common capa∣cities, and fitted to please the populace. The rapid propagation of Calvin's religion, and his numerous proselytes, are a strong proof of his address in planning such a sort of service. France
<PB N="166" REF="270"/>
and Germany were instantly infatuated with a love of psalm∣singing: which being admirably calculated to kindle and diffuse the flame of fanaticism, was peculiarly serviceable to the pur∣poses of faction, and frequently served as the trumpet to rebel∣lion. These energetic hymns of Geneva, under the conduct of the Calvinistic preachers, excited and supported a variety of po∣pular insurrections; they filled the most flourishing cities of the Low-countries with sedition and tumult, and fomented the fury which defaced many of the most beautiful and venerable churches of Flanders.</P>
<P>This infectious frenzy of sacred song soon reached England, at the very critical point of time, when it had just embraced the reformation: and the new psalmody was obtruded on the new English liturgy by some few officious zealots, who favoured the discipline of Geneva, and who wished to abolish, not only the choral mode of worship in general, but more particularly to suppress the TE DEUM, BENEDICTUS, MAGNIFICAT, JUBI∣LATE, NUNC DIMITTIS, and the rest of the liturgic hymns, which were supposed to be contaminated by their long and antient connection with the Roman missal, or at least in their prosaic form, to be unsuitable to the new system of worship.</P>
<P>Although Wyat and Surrey had before made translations of the Psalms into metre, Thomas Sternhold was the first whose metrical version of the Psalms was used in the church of Eng∣land. Sternhold was a native of Hampshire, and probably edu∣cated at Winchester college. Having passed some time at Oxford, he became groom of the robes to king Henry the eighth. In this department, either his diligent services or his knack at rhyming so pleased the king, that his majesty bequeathed him a legacy of one hundred marks. He continued in the same office under Edward the sixth, and is said to have acquired some degree of reputation about the court for his poetry. Being of a serious disposition, and an enthusiast to reformation, he was much of∣fended at the lascivious ballads which prevailed among the cour∣tiers: and, with a laudable design to check these indecencies, undertook
<PB N="167" REF="271"/>
a metrical version of the Psalter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thinking thereby, says Antony Wood, that the courtiers would sing them instead of their sonnets, <HI>but did not,</HI> only some few excepted <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">ATH. Oxon. i. 76.</NOTE>."</Q> Here was the zeal, if not the success, of his fellow labourer Clement Marot. A singular coincidence of circumstances is, notwith∣standing, to be remarked on this occasion. Vernacular versions for general use of the Psalter were first published both in France and England, by laymen, by court-poets, and by servants of the court. Nor were the respective translations entirely completed by themselves: and yet they translated nearly an equal number of psalms, Marot having versified fifty, and Sternhold fifty-one. Sternhold died in the year 1549. His fifty-one psalms were printed the same year by Edward Whitchurch, under the fol∣lowing title. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All such Psalms of David as Thomas Stern∣holde late grome of the kinges Maiestyes robes did in his ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e tyme drawe into Englysshe metre."</Q> They are without the musical notes, as is the second edition in 1552. He probably lived to prepare the first edition for the press, as it is dedicated by himself to king Edward the sixth.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with Sternhold, and his coadjutor, was John Hopkins: of whose life nothing more is known, than that he was a clergyman and a schoolmaster of Suffolk, and perhaps a graduate at Oxford about the year 1544. Of his abilities as a teacher of the classics, he has left a specimen in some Latin stanzas prefixed to FOX'S MARTYROLOGY. He is rather a better English poet than Sternhold; and translated fifty eight of the psalms, distinguished by the initials of his name.</P>
<P>Of the rest of the contributors to this undertaking, the chief, at least in point of rank and learning, was William Whytting∣ham, promoted by Robert earl of Leicester to the deanery of Durham, yet not without a strong reluctance to comply with the use of the canonical habiliments. Among our reli∣gious exiles in the reign of Mary, he was Calvin's principal
<PB N="168" REF="272"/>
favorite, from whom he received ordination. So pure was his faith, that he was thought worthy to succeed to the congrega∣tion of Geneva, superintended by Knox, the Scotch reformer; who, from a detestation of idols, proceeded to demolish the churches in which they were contained. It was one of the natural consequences of Whyttingham's translation from Knox's pastorship at Geneva to an English deanery, that he destroyed or removed many beautiful and harmless monuments of antient art in his cathedral. To a man, who had so highly spiritualised his religious conceptions, as to be convinced that a field, a street, or a barn, were fully sufficient for all the operations of chris∣tian worship, the venerable structures raised by the magnificent piety of our ancestors could convey no ideas of solemnity, and had no other charms than their ample endowments. Beside the psalms he translated <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Among them is the hundreth, and the hundred and nineteenth.</NOTE>, all which bear his initials, by way of in∣novating still further on our established formularly, he versified the Decalogue, the Nicene, Apostolic, and Athanasian Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the TE DEUM, the Song of the three Children, with other hymns which follow the book of psalmody. How the Ten Commandments and the Athanasian Creed, to say no∣thing of some of the rest, should become more edifying and better suited to common use, or how they could receive im∣provement in any respect or degree, by being reduced into rhym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it is not easy to perceive. But the real design was, to render that more tolerable which could not be entirely removed, to accommodate every part of the service to the psalmodic tone, and to clothe our whole liturgy in the garb of Geneva. All these, for he was a lover of music, were sung in Whytting∣ham's church of Durham under his own directions. Heylin says, that from vicinity of situation, he was enabled to lend con∣siderable assistance to his friend Knox in the introduction of the presbyterian hierarchy into Scotland. I must indulge the reader with a stanza or two of this dignified fanatic's divine poetry

<P>Twenty-seven of the psalms were turned into metre by Thomas Norton <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Marked N.</NOTE>, who perhaps was better employed, at least as a poet, in writing the tragedy of GORDOBUCKE in conjunction with lord Buckhurst. It is certain that in Norton's psalms we see none of those sublime strokes which sir Philip Sydney disco∣vered in that venerable drama. He was of Sharpenhoe in Bed∣fordshire, a barrister, and in the opinion and phraseology of the Oxford biographer, a bold and busy Calvinist about the begin∣ning of the reign of queen Elisabeth. He was patronised by the Protector Somerset; at whose desire he translated an epistle addressed by Peter Martyr to Somerset, into English, in 1550.

Robert Wisdome, a protestant fugitive in the calamitous reign of queen Mary, afterwards archdeacon of Ely, and who had been nominated to an Irish bishoprick by king Edward the sixth, rendered the twenty-fifth psalm of this version <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Strype's CRANMER, p. 274. 276. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>77.

But he is chiefly memorable for his metrical prayer, intended to be sung in the church, against the Pope and the Turk, of whom he seems to have conceived the most alarming apprehensions. It is probable, that he thought popery and mahometanism were equally dangerous to christianity, at least the most powerful and the sole enemies of our religion. This is the first stanza.</P>

<P>Happily we have hitherto survived these two formidable evils! Among other orthodox wits, the facetious bishop Corbet has ridiculed these lines. He supposes himself seized with a sudden impulse to hear or to pen a puritanical hymn, and invokes the ghost of Robert Wisdome, as the most skilful poet in this mode of composition, to come and assist. But he advises Wisdome to steal back again to his tomb, which was in Carfax church at Oxford, silent and unperceived, for fear of being detected and intercepted by the Pope or the Turk. But I will produce Cor∣bet's epigram, more especially as it contains a criticism written in the reign of Charles the first, on the style of this sort of poetry.</P>

<P>The entire version of the psalter was at length published by John Day, in 1562, attached for the first time to the common prayer, and entitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The whole Booke of Psalmes collected into English metre by T.

Hopkins, and others, conferred with the Ebrue, with apt Notes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them withall."</Q> Calvin's music was intended to correspond with the general par∣simonious spirit of his worship: not to captivate the passions, and seduce the mind, by a levity, a variety, or a richness of modulation, but to infuse the more sober and unravishing ecstasies. The music he permitted, although sometimes it had wonderful effects, was to be without grace, elegance, or ele∣vation. These apt notes were about forty tunes, of one part only, and in one unisonous key; remarkable for a certain uni∣form strain of sombrous gravity, and applicable to all the psalms in their turns, as the stanza and sense might allow. They also appear in the subsequent impressions, particularly of 1564, and 1577. They are believed to contain some of the original melo∣dies, composed by French and German musicians. Many of them, particularly the celebrated one of the hundredth psalm, are the tunes of Goudimel and Le Jeune, who are among the first composers of Marot's French psalms <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See this matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> traced with great skill and accuracy by Hawkins, HIST. MUS. iii. 518.</NOTE>. Not a few were probably
<PB N="172" REF="276"/>
imported by the protestant manufacturers of cloth, of Flanders, and the Low Countries, who fled into England from the perse∣cution of the Duke de Alva, and settled in those counties where their art now chiefly flourishes. It is not however un∣likely, that some of our own musicians, who lived about the year 1562, and who could always tune their harps to the reli∣gion of the times, such as Marbeck, Tallis, Tye, Parsons, and Munday, were employed on this occasion; yet under the restric∣tion of conforming to the jejune and unadorned movements of the foreign composers. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resume much of the primitive har∣mony of all these antient tunes is now lost, by additions, varia∣tions, and transpositions.</P>
<P>This version is said to be <HI>conferred with the Ebrue.</HI> But I am inclined to think, that the translation was altogether made from the vulgate text, either in Latin or English.</P>
<P>It is evident that the prose psalms of our liturgy were chiefly consulted and copied, by the perpetual assumption of their words and combinations: many of the stanza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are literally nothing more than the prose-verses put into rhyme.

<P>Whyttingham however, who had travelled to acquire the lite∣rature then taught in the foreign universities, and who joined in the translation of Coverdale's Bible, was undoubtedly a scholar, and an adept in the Hebrew language.</P>
<P>It is certain that every attempt to clothe the sacred Scripture in verse, will have the effect of misrepresenting and debasing the dignity of the original. But this general inconvenience, arising from the nature of things, was not the only difficulty which our versifiers of the psalter had to encounter, in common
<PB N="173" REF="277"/>
with all other writers employed in a similar task. Allowing for the state of our language in the middle of the sixteenth century, they appear to have been but little qualified either by genius or accomplishments for poetical composition. It is for this reason that they have produced a translation entirely destitute of ele∣gance, spirit, and propriety. The truth is, that they undertook this work, not so much from an ambition of literary fame, or a consciousness of abilities, as from motives of piety, and in compliance with the cast of the times. I presume I am com∣municating no very new criticism when I observe, that in every part of this translation we are disgusted with a languor of versifi∣cation, and a want of common prosody. The most exalted effusions of thanksgiving, and the most sublime imageries of the divine majesty, are lowered by a coldness of conception, weak∣ened by frigid interpolations, and disfigured by a poverty of phraseology. Thomas Hopkins expostulates with the deity in these ludicrous, at least trivial, expressions.</P>

<P>The psalmist says, that God has placed the sun in the heavens, <Q REND="inline">"which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber."</Q> Here is a comparison of the sun rising, to a bridegroom; who, according to the Jewish custom, was ushered from his chamber at midnight, with great state, preceded by torches and music.

<P>The translator had better have spared his epithet to the bride∣groom; which, even in the sense of <HI>ready-dressed,</HI> is derogatory to

the idea of the comparison. But <HI>ready-trimm'd,</HI> in the language of that time, was nothing more than <HI>fresh-shaved.</HI> Sternhold as often impairs a splendid description by an impotent redundancy, as by an omission or contraction of the most important circum∣stances.</P>
<P>The miraculous march of Jehovah before the Israelites through the wilderness in their departure from Egypt, with other marks of his omnipotence, is thus imaged by the inspired psalmist. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O God, when thou wentest forth before the people, when thou wentest through the wilderness: the earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.

<P>If there be here any merit, it arises solely from preserving the expressions of the prose version. And the translator would have done better had he preserved more, and had given us no feeble or foreign enlargements of his own. He has shewn no inde∣pendent skill or energy. When once he attempts to add or dilate, his weakness appears. It is this circumstance alone, which supports the two following well-known stanzas <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ps. xviii. 9. 10.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Almost the entire contexture of the prose is here literally transferred, unbroken and without transposition, allowing for the small deviations necessarily occasioned by the metre and rhyme. It may be said, that the translator has testified his judgment in retaining so much of the original, and proved he was sensible the passage needed not any adventitious ornament. But what may seem here to be judgment or even taste, I fear, was want of expression in himself. He only adopted what was almost ready done to his hand.</P>
<P>To the disgrace of sacred music, sacred poetry, and our established worship, these psalms still continue to be sung in

the church of England. It is certain, had they been more poetically translated, they would not have been acceptable to the common people. Yet however they may be allowed to serve the purposes of private edification, in administering spiri∣tual consolation to the manufacturer and mechanic, as they are extrinsic to the frame of our liturgy, and incompatible with the genius of our service, there is perhaps no im∣propriety in wishing, that they were remitted and restrained to that church in which they sprung, and with whose character and constitution they seem so aptly to correspond. Whatever estimation in point of composition they might have attracted at their first appearance in a ruder age, and however instrumental they might have been at the infancy of the refor∣mation in weaning the minds of men from the papistic ritual, all these considerations can now no longer support even a spe∣cious argument for their being retained. From the circum∣stances of the times, and the growing refinements of literature, of course they become obsolete and contemptible. A work grave, serious, and even respectable for its poetry, in the reign of Edward the sixth, at length in a cultivated age, has con∣tracted the air of an absolute travestie. Voltaire observes, that in proportion as good taste improved, the psalms of Clement Marot inspired only disgust: and that although they charmed the court of Francis the first, they seemed only to be calculated for the populace in the reign of Lewis the fourteenth <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">HIST. MOD. ch. ccvii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To obviate these objections, attempts have been made from time to time to modernise this antient metrical version, and to render it more tolerable and intelligible by the substitution of more familiar modes of diction. But, to say nothing of the unskilfulness with which these arbitrary corrections have been conducted, by changing obsolete for known words, the texture and integrity of the original style, such as it was, has been de∣stroyed: and many stanzas, before too naked and weak, like a
<PB N="178" REF="282"/>
plain old Gothic edifice stripped of its few signatures of anti∣quity, have lost that little and almost only strength and support which they derived from antient phrases. Such alterations, even if executed with prudence and judgment, only corrupt what they endeavour to explain; and exhibit a motley performance, belonging to no character of writing, and which contains more improprieties than those which it professes to remove. Hearne is highly offended at these unwarrantable and incongruous emen∣dations, which he pronounces to be <HI>abominable</HI> in any book, <Q REND="inline">"much more in a sacred work;"</Q> and is confident, that were Sternhold and Hopkins <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"now living, they would be so far from owning what is ascribed to them, that they would proceed against the innovators as CHEATS <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">GLOSS.

In con∣demning the practice of adulterating this primitive version, I would not be understood to recommend another in its place, en∣tirely new. I reprobate any version at all, more especially if in∣tended for the use of the church.</P>
<P>In the mean time, not to insist any longer on the incompati∣bility of these metrical psalms with the spirit of our liturgy, and the barbarism of their style, it should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remembered, that they were never admitted into our church by lawful authority.

laying apart all ungodly songs and ballads, which tend only to the nourishing of vice and the corrupting of youth."</Q> At the beginning of the reign of queen Elisabeth, when our eccle∣siastical reformation began to be placed on a solid and durable establishment, those English divines who had fled from the su∣perstitions of queen Mary to Franckfort and Geneva, where they had learned to embrace the opposite extreme, and where, from an abhorrence of catholic ceremonies, they had contracted a dislike to the decent appendages of divine worship, endea∣voured, in conjunction with some of the principal courtiers, to effect an abrogation of our solemn church service, which they pronounced to be antichristian and unevangelical. They con∣tended that the metrical psalms of David, set to plain and po∣pular music, were more suitable to the simplicity of the gospel, and abundantly adequate to all the purposes of edification: and this proposal they rested on the authority and practice of Calvin, between whom and the church of England the breach was not then so wide as at present. But the queen and those bishops to whom she had delegated the business of supervising the liturgy, among which was the learned and liberal archbishop Parker, objected, that too much attention had already been paid to the German theology. She declared, that the foreign reformers had before interpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imilar deliberations, with unbecoming forwardness: and that the Common Prayer of her brother Ed∣ward had been once altered, to quiet the scruples, and to gratify the cavils, of Calvin, Bucer, and Fagius. She was therefore invariably determined to make no more concessions to the im∣portunate partisans of Geneva, and peremptorily decreed that the choral formalities should still be continued in the celebration of the sacred offices <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See CANONS and INJUNCTIONS, A.

<P>THE spirit of versifying the psalms, and other parts of the Bible, at the beginning of the reformation, was almost as epidemic as psalm-singing. William Hunnis, a gentleman of the chapel under Edward the sixth, and afterwards chapel-master to queen Elisabeth, rendered into rhyme many select psalms, which had not the good fortune to be rescued from oblivion by being incorporated into Hopkins's collection, nor to be sung in the royal chapel. They were printed in 1550, with this title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Certayne Psalmes chosen out of the Psalter of David, and drawen furth into Englysh meter by William Hunnis servant to the ryght honourable syr William Harberd knight.

<P>Whatever might at first have been his design, it is certain that his version, although printed, was never published: and notwithstanding the formality of his metrical preface abovementioned,

which was professedly written to shew the spiritual efficacy or virtue of the psalms in metre, and in which he di∣rects a distinct and audible mode of congregational singing, he probably suppressed it, because he saw that the practice had been abused to the purposes of fanaticism, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dopted by the puri∣tans in contradiction to the national worship; or at least that such a publication, whatever his private sentiments might have been, would not have suited the nature and dignity of his high office in the church. Some of our musical antiquaries, however, have justly conjectured, that the archbishop, who was skilled in music, and had formerly founded a music-school in his college of Stoke Clare, intended these psalms, which are adapted to complicated tunes of four parts probably constructed by him∣self and here given in score, for the use of cathedrals; at a time, when compositions in counterpoint were uncommon in the church, and when that part of our choir-service called the motet or anthem, which admits a more artificial display of har∣mony, and which is recommended and allowed in queen Elisa∣beth's earliest ecclesiastical injunctions, was yet almost unknown, or but in a very imperfect state. Accordingly, although the di∣rection is not quite comprehensible, he orders many of them to be sung by the <HI>rector chori,</HI> or chantor, and the <HI>quier,</HI> or choir, alternately. That at least he had a taste for music, we may conclude from the following not inelegant scale of modulation, prefixed to his eight tunes abovementioned.</P>

OXON. i. 235.</NOTE>."</Q> In 1550 he printed the first edition of PIERCE PLOWMAN'S VISION, but with the ideas of a controversialist, and with the view of helping forward the reformation by the revival of a book which ex∣posed the absurdities of popery in strong satire, and which at present is only valuable or useful, as it serves to gratify the harm∣less researches of those peaceable philosophers who study the progression of antient literature. His pulpit and his press, those two prolific sources of faction, happily cooperated in propagating his principles of predestination: and his shop and his sermons were alike frequented. Possessed of those talents which qualified him for captivating the attention and moving the passions of the multitude, under queen Elisabeth he held many dignities in a church, whose doctrines and polity his un∣discerning zeal had a tendency to destroy. He translated into popular rhyme, not only the psalter, but the litany, with hymns, all which he printed together in 1549. In the same year, and in the same measure, he published <HI>The Voice of the last Trumpet blown by the seventh angel.</HI> This piece contains twelve several lessons, for the instruction or amendment of those who seemed at that time chiefly to need advice; and among whom he enu∣merates <HI>lewd</HI> priests, scholars, physicians, beggars, yeomen, gentlemen,
<PB N="188" REF="292"/>
magistrates, and women. He also attacked the abuses of his age in thirty-one EPIGRAMS, first printed in 1551. The subjects are placed alphabetically. In his first alphabet are <HI>Abbayes, Alehouses, Alleys,</HI> and <HI>Almeshouses.</HI> The second, <HI>Bailiffs, Bawds, Beggars, Bear-bayting,</HI> and <HI>Brawlers.</HI> They display, but without spirit or humour, the reprehensible prac∣tices and licentious manners which then prevailed. He pub∣lished in 1551, a kind of metrical sermon on Pleasure and Pain, Heaven and Hell. Many of these, to say nothing of his almost innumerable controversial tracts in prose, had repeated editions, and from his own press. But one of his treatises, to prove that Lent is a human invention and a superstitious institu∣tion, deserves notice for its plan: it is a Dialogue between Lent and Liberty. The personification of Lent is a bold and a per∣fectly new prosopopeia. In an old poem of this age against the papists, written by one doctor William Turner a physician, but afterwards dean of Wells, the Mass, or mistress MISSA, is perso∣nified, who, arrayed in all her meretricious trappings, must at least have been a more theatrical figure <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Strype, ECC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>BUT among the theological versifiers of these times, the most notable is Christopher Tye, a doctor of music at Cambridge in 1545, and musical preceptor to prince Edward, and probably to his sisters the princesses Mary and Elisabeth. In the reign of Elisabeth he was organist of the royal chapel, in which he had been educated. To his profession of music, he joined some knowledge of English literature: and having been taught to believe that rhyme and edification were closely con∣nected, and being persuaded that every part of the Scripture would be more instructive and better received if reduced into verse, he projected a translation of the ACTS OF THE APOS∣TLES into familiar metre. It appears that the BOOK OF KINGS had before been versified, which for many reasons was more capable of shining under the hands of a translator. But the most splendid historical book, I mean the most susceptible of poetic ornament, in the Old or New Testament, would have become ridiculous when clothed in the fashionable ecclesiastical stanza. Perhaps the plan of setting a narrative of this kind to music, was still more preposterous and exceptionable. How∣ever, he completed only the first fourteen chapters: and they were printed in 1553, by William Serres, with the following title, which by the reader, who is not acquainted with the pe∣culiar complexion of this period, will hardly be suspected to be serious. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The ACTES OF THE APOSTLES translated into Englyshe metre, and dedicated to the kinges most excellent maiestye by Cristofer Tye, doctor in musyke, and one of the

<P>Doctor Tye's ACTS OF THE APOSTLES were sung for a time in the royal chapel of Edward the sixth. But they never became popular. The impropriety of the design, and the im∣potency of the execution, seem to have been perceived even by his own prejudiced and undiscerning age. This circumstance, however, had probably the fortunate and seasonable effect, of
<PB N="194" REF="298"/>
turning Tye's musical studies to another and a more rational system: to the composition of words judiciously selected from the prose psalms in four or five parts. Before the middle of the reign of Elisabeth, at a time when the more ornamental and in∣tricate music was wanted in our service, he concurred with the celebrated Tallis and a few others in setting several anthems, which are not only justly supposed to retain much of the ori∣ginal strain of our antient choral melody before the reformation, but in respect of harmony, expression, contrivance, and general effect, are allowed to be perfect models of the genuine ecclesiastic style. Fuller informs us, that Tye was the chief restorer of the loss which the music of the church had sustained by the de∣struction of the monasteries <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">WORTHI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S, ii. 244. Tallis here mentioned, at the begin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of the reign of Elisabeth, and by proper authority, enriched the music of Marbeck's liturgy. He set to music the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> DEUM, BENEDIC∣TUS, MAGNIFICAT, NUNC DIMITTIS, and other offices, to which Marbeck had given only the <HI>canto fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mo,</HI> or plain chant. He composed a new Litany still in use; and improved the simpler modulation of Marbeck's Suffrages, Kyries after the Commandments, and other versicle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as they are sung at pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt. There are two chants of Tallis, one to the VENITE EX∣ULTEMUS, and another to the Athanasian Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE>.

<P>It is not my intention to pursue any farther the mob of reli∣gious rhymers, who, from principles of the most unfeigned piety, devoutly laboured to darken the lustre, and enervate the force, of the divine pages. And perhaps I have been already too prolix in examining a species of poetry, if it may be so called, which even impoverishes prose; or rather, by mixing the stile of prose with verse, and of verse with prose, destroys
<PB N="195" REF="299"/>
the character and effect of both. But in surveying the general course of a species of literature, absurdities as well as excellen∣cies, the weakness and the vigour of the human mind, must have their historian. Nor is it unpleasing to trace and to con∣template those strange incongruities, and false ideas of perfection, which at various times, either affectation, or caprice, or fashion, or opinion, or prejudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or ignorance, or enthusiasm, present to the conceptions of men, in the shape of truth.</P>
<P>I must not, however, forget, that king Edward the sixth is to be ranked among the religious poets of his own reign. Fox has published his metrical instructions concerning the eucharist, addressed to sir Antony Saint Leger. Bale also mentions his comedy called the WHORE OF BABYLON, which Holland the heroologist, who perhaps had never seen it, and knew not whether it was a play or a ballad, in verse or prose, pronounces to be a most elegant perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mance <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">HEROOLOG. p. 27.</NOTE>. Its elegance, with some, will not perhaps apologise or atone for its subject: and it may seem strange, that controversial ribaldry should have been suf∣fered to enter into the education of a great monarch. But the genius, habits, and situation; of his age should be considered. The reformation was the great political topic of Edward's court. Intricate discussions in divinity were no longer confined to the schools or the clergy. The new religion, from its novelty, as well as importance, interested every mind, and was almost the sole object of the general attention. Men emancipated from the severities of a spiritual tyranny, reflected with horror on the slavery they had so long suffered, and with exultation on the triumph they had obtained. These feelings were often expressed in a strain of enthusiasm. The spirit of innovation, which had seized the times, often transgressed the bounds of truth. Every change of religion is attended with those ebullitions, which growing more moderate by degrees, afterwards appear eccentric and ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="300"/>
We who live at a distance from this great and national strug∣gle between popery and protestantism, when our church has been long and peaceably established, and in an age of good sense, of politeness and philosophy, are apt to view these effusions of royal piety as weak and unworthy the character of a king. But an ostentation of zeal and example in the young Edward, as it was natural so it was necessary, while the reformation was yet immature. It was the duty of his preceptors, to impress on his tender years, an abhorrence of the principles of Rome, and a predilection to that happy system which now seemed likely to prevail. His early diligence, his inclination to letters, and his seriousness of disposition, seconded their active endeavours to cultivate and to bias his mind in favour of the new theology, which was now become the fashionable knowledge. These and other amiable virtues his cotemporaries have given young Ed∣ward in an eminent degree. But it may be presumed, that the partiality which youth always commands, the specious prospects excited by expectation, and the flattering promises of religious liberty secured to a distant posterity, have had some small share in dictating his panegyric.</P>
<P>The new settlement of religion, by counteracting inveterate prejudices of the most interesting nature, by throwing the clergy into a state of contention, and by disseminating theological opi∣nions among the people, excited so general a ferment, that even the popular ballads and the stage, were made the vehicles of the controversy between the papal and protestant communions <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See instances already given, before the Reformation had actually taken place, supr. p. 144.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ballad of LUTHER, the POPE, a CARDINAL, and a HUSBANDMAN, written in 1550, in defence of the reforma∣tion, has some spirit, and supports a degree of character in the speakers. There is another written about the same time, which is a lively satire on the English Bible, the vernacular liturgy, and the book of homilies <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See Percy BALL. ii. 102.</NOTE>.

PIERCE PLOWMAN, with the addition of rhyme: a sort of versification which now was not uncommon.</P>
<P>Strype has printed a poem called the PORE HELP, of the year 1550, which is a lampoon against the new preachers or gospellers, not very elegant in its allusions, and in Skelton's style. The anonymous satirist mentions with applause <HI>Mayster Huggarde,</HI> or Miles Hoggard, a shoemaker of London, and who wrote several virulent pamphlets against the reformation, which were made important by extorting laboured answers from several eminent divines <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">One of these pieces is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Confuta∣tion to the answer of a wicked ballad,"</Q> printed in 1550.

<P>In the year 1547, a proclamation was published to prohibit preaching. This was a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mporary expedient to suppress the turbulent harangues of the catholic ministers, who still com∣posed no small part of the parochial clergy: for the court of augmentations took care perpetually to supply the vacant bene∣fices with the disincorporated monks, in order to exonerate the exchequer from the payment of their annuities. These men, both from inclination and interest, and hoping to restore the church to its antient orthodoxy and opulence, exerted all their powers of declamation in combating the doctrines of protestantism
<PB N="198" REF="302"/>
and in alienating the minds of the people from the new doctrines and reformed rites of worship. Being silenced by au∣thority, they had recourse to the stage: and from the pulpit re∣moved their polemics to the play-house. Their farces became more successful than their sermons. The people flocked eagerly to the play-house, when deprived not only of their antient pagean∣tries, but of their pastoral discourses, in the church. Arch∣bishop Cranmer and the protector Somerset were the chief ob∣jects of these dramatic invectives <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fuller, CH. HIST. B. vii. Cent. xvi. p. 390.</NOTE>.

many of the impostures of popery, it became an object of the legislature to curb the bold and seditious spirit of popular poetry. No sooner were the Scriptures translated and permitted in English, than they were brought upon the stage: they were not only misinterpreted and misunderstood by the multitude, but profaned or burlesqued in comedies and mummeries. Ef∣fectually to restrain these abuses, Henry, who loved to create a subject for persecution, who commonly proceeded to disannul what he had just confirmed, and who found that a freedom of enquiry tended to shake his ecclesiastical supremacy, framed a law, that not only Tyndale's English Bible, and all the printed English commentaries, expositions, annotations, defences, replies, and sermons, whether orthodox or heretical, which it had occa∣sioned, should be utterly abolished; but that the kingdom should also be <HI>purged</HI> and <HI>cleansed</HI> of all religious plays, inter∣ludes, rhymes, ballads, and songs, which are equally <HI>pestiferou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and noysome</HI> to the peace of the church <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">STAT.

<P>Henry appears to have been piqued as an author and a theolo∣gist in adding the clause concerning his own INSTITUTION OF A CHRISTIAN MAN, which had been treated with the same sort of ridicule.

<P>I must add here, in reference to my general subject, that the translation of the Bible, which in the reign of Edward the sixth was admitted into the churches, is supposed to have fixed our language. It certainly has transmitted and perpetuated many antient words which would otherwise have been obsolete or un∣intelligible. I have never seen it remarked, that at the same time this translation contributed to enrich our native English at an early period, by importing and familiarising many Latin words <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>More particularly in the Latin deriva∣tive substantives, such as,</HI> divination, perdi∣tion, adoption, manifestatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, consolation, con∣tribution, administration, consummation, recon∣ciliation, operation, communication, retribution, preparation, immortality, principality, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. And in other words,</HI> frustrate, inexcusable, tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>figure, concupiscence, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These were suggested by the Latin vulgate, which was used as a medium by the translators. Some of these, however, now interwoven into our common speech, could not have been un∣derstood by many readers even above the rank of the vulgar, when the Bible first appeared in English. Bishop Gardiner had therefore much less reason than we now imagine, for complain∣ing of the too great clearness of the translation, when with an insidious view of keeping the people in their antient ignorance, he proposed, that instead of always using English phrases, many Latin words should still be preserved, because they contained an inherent significance and a genuine dignity, to which the com∣mon tongue afforded no correspondent expressions of sufficient energy <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Such as, <HI>Idololatria, contritus, holo∣causta, sacramentum, elementa, humilitas, sa∣tisfactio, ceremonia, absolutio, mysterium, peni∣tentia,</HI> &amp;c. See Gardiner's proposals in Burnet, HIST. REF. vol. i. B. iii. p. 315. And Fuller, CH. HI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T. B. v. Cent. xvi. p. 238.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the reign of Edward the sixth belongs Arthur Kelton, a native of Shropshire or Wales. He wrote the CRONICLE OF
<PB N="206" REF="310"/>
THE BRUTES in English verse. It is dedicated to the young king, who seems to have been the general patron; and was printed in 1547 <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Lond. Octavo. Pr. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the golden time when all things."</Q></NOTE>. Wood allows that he was an able antiquary; but laments, that he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"being withall poetically given, must for∣sooth write and publish his lucubrations in verse; whereby, for rhime's sake, many material matters, and the due timing of them, are omitted, and so consequently rejected by histo∣rians and antiquarians <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 73.</NOTE>."</Q> Yet he has not supplied his want of genealogical and historical precision with those strokes of poetry which his subject suggested; nor has his imagination been any impediment to his accuracy. At the end of his CRONICLE is the GENEALOGY OF THE BRUTES, in which the pedigree of king Edward the sixth is lineally drawn through thirty-two ge∣nerations, from Osiris the first king of Egypt. Here too Wood reproaches our author for his ignorance in genealogy. But in an heraldic enquiry, so difficult and so new, many mistakes are pardonable. It is extraordinary that a Welshman should have carried his genealogical researches into Egypt, or rather should have wished to prove that Edward was descended from Osiris: but this was with a design to shew, that the Egyptian monarch was the original progen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor of Brutus, the undoubted founder of Edward's family. Bale says that he wrote, and dedicated to sir William Herbert, afterwards earl of Pembroke, a most elegant poetical panegyric on the Cambro-Britons <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bale, xi. 97.</NOTE>.

<P>TRUE genius, unseduced by the cabals and unalarmed by the dangers of faction, defies or neglects those events which destroy the peace of mankind, and often exerts its opera∣tions amidst the most violent commotions of a state. Without patronage and without readers, I may add without models, the earlier Italian writers, while their country was shook by the in∣testine tumults of the Guelfes and Guibelines, continued to pro∣duce original compositions both in prose and verse, which yet stand unrivalled. The age of Pericles and of the Peloponnesian war was the same. Careless of those who governed or disturbed the world, and superior to the calamities of a quarrel in which two mighty leaders contended for the prize of universal domi∣nion, Lucretius wrote his sublime didactic poem on the system of nature, Virgil his bucolics, and Cicero his books of philoso∣phy. The proscriptions of Augustus did not prevent the pro∣gress of the Roman literature.</P>
<P>In the turbulent and unpropitious reign of queen Mary, when controversy was no longer confined to speculation, and a spiritual warfare polluted every part of England with murthers more atrocious than the slaughters of the most bloody civil contest, a poem was planned, although not fully completed, which illu∣minates with no common lustre that interval of darkness, which occupies the annals of English poetry from Surrey to Spenser, entitled, A MIRROUR FOR MAGISTRATES.</P>
<P>More writers than one were concerned in the execution of this piece: but its primary inventor, and most distinguished
<PB N="210" REF="314"/>
contributor, was Thomas Sackville the first lord Buckhurst, and first earl of Dorset. Much about the same period, the same author wrote the first genuine English tragedy, which I shall consider in its proper place.</P>
<P>Sackville was born at Buckhurst, a pricipal seat of his antient and illustrious family in the parish of Withiam in Sussex. His birth is placed, but with evident inaccuracy, under the year 1536 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Archbishop Abbot, in Sackville's Fu∣neral-sermon, says he was aged 72 when he died, in the year 1608. If so, he was not twenty years of age when h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrote GORDOBUCK.</NOTE>. At least it should be placed six years before. Disco∣vering a vigorous understanding in his childhood, from a do∣mestic tuition he was removed, as it may reasonably be conjec∣tured, to Hart-hall, now Hertford college, in Oxford. But he appears to have been a master of Arts at Cambridge <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 767.</NOTE>. At both universities he became celebrated as a Latin and English poet; and he carried his love of poetry, which he seems to have almost solely cultivated, to the Inner Temple. It was now fashionable for every young man of fortune, before he began his travels, or was admitted into parliament, to be initiated in the study of the law. But instead of pursuing a science, which could not be his profession, and which was unaccommodated to the bias of his genius, he betrayed his predilection to a more pleasing species of literature, by composing the tragedy just mentioned, for the entertainment and honour of his fellow-students. His high birth, however, and ample patrimony, soon advanced him to more important situations and employments. His eminent ac∣complishments and abilities having acquired the confidence and esteem of queen Elisabeth, the poet was soon lost in the states∣man, and negotiations and embassies extinguished the milder ambitions of the ingenuous Muse. Yet it should be remem∣bered, that he was uncorrupted amidst the intrigues of an artful court, that in the character of a first minister he preserved the integrity of a private man, and that his family refused the offer of an apology to his memory, when it was insulted by the malicious
<PB N="211" REF="315"/>
insinuations of a rival party. Nor is it foreign to our purpose to remark, that his original elegance and brilliancy of mind sometimes broke forth, in the exercise of his more formal political functions.

It was either because his mistress Elisabeth paid a sincere compli∣ment to his singular learning and fidelity, or because she was willing to indulge an affected fit of indignation against the ob∣ject of her capricious passion, that when Sackville, in 1591, was a candidate for the chancellorship of the university of Oxford, she condescended earnestly to sollicit the university in his favour, and in opposition to his competitor the earl of Essex. At least she appears to have approved the choice, for her majesty soon afterwards visited Oxford, where she was entertained by the new chancellor with splendid banquets and much solid erudition. It is neither my design nor my province, to develope the profound policy with which he conducted a peace with Spain, the address with which he penetrated or baffled the machinations of Essex, and the circumspection and success with which he managed the

treasury of two opulent sovereigns. I return to Sackville as a poet, and to the history of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Many of his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in the CA∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ALA.

<P>About the year 1557, he formed the plan of a poem, in which all the illustrious but unfortunate characters of the Eng∣lish history, from the conquest to the end of the fourteenth century, were to pass in review before the poet, who descends like Dante into the infernal region, and is conducted by SORROW. Although a descent into hell had been suggested by other poets, the application of such a fiction to the present design, is a conspicuous proof of genius and even of invention. Every personage was to recite his own misfortunes in a separate soliloquy. But Sackville had leisure only to finish a poetical preface called an INDUCTION, and one legend, which is the life of Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham. Relinquishing therefore the design abruptly, and hastily adapting the close of his INDUCTION to the appearance of Buckingham, the only story he had yet written, and which was to have been the last in his series, he recommended the completion of the whole to Richard Baldwyne and George Ferrers.</P>
<P>Baldwyne seems to have been graduated at Oxford about the year 1532. He was an ecclesiastic, and engaged in the education of youth. I have already mentioned his metrical version of SOLOMON'S SONG, dedicated to king Edward the sixth <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See supr. 181.</NOTE>.

<P>George Ferrers, a man of superior rank, was born at saint Albans, educated at Oxford, and a student of Lincolns-inn. Leland, who has given him a place in his ENCOMIA, informs us, that he was patronised by lord Cromwell <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fol. 66.</NOTE>. He was in parliament

He was a composer almost by profession of occasional interludes for the diversion of the court: and in 1553, being then a member of Lincolns-inn, he bore the office of LORD OF MISRULE at the royal palace of Green∣wich during the twelve days of Christmas. Stowe says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"George Ferrers gentleman of Lincolns-inn, being lord of the disportes all the 12 days of Christmas anno MDLIII <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hollinshead says 1552. fol. 1067.</NOTE>, at Greenwich: who so pleasantly and wisely behaved himself, that the king had great delight in his pastymes <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">CHRON. p. 608.

<P>Baldwyne and Ferrers, perhaps deterred by the greatness of the attempt, did not attend to the series prescribed by Sackville; but inviting some others to their assistance, among which are Churchyard and Phayer, chose such lives from the newly pub∣lished chronicles of Fabyan and Hall, as seemed to display the most affecting catastrophes, and which very probably were pointed out by Sackville. The civil wars of York and Lan∣caster, which Hall had compiled with a laborious investigation of the subject, appear to have been their chief resource.</P>

PRINCIPUM, a book translated, as we have seen, by Lyd∣gate, but which never was popular, because it had no English examples. But Baldwyne's scope and conduct, with respect to this and other circumstances, will best appear from his Preface, which cannot easily be found, and which I shall therefore insert at large. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When the printer had purposed with him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elfe to printe Lydgate's booke of the FALL OF PRINCES, and had made pryvye therto many both honourable and worshipfull, he was counsayled by dyvers of them, to procure to have the story contynewed from where as Bochas left, unto this pre∣sent time; chiefly of such as Fortune had dalyed with in this ylande.—Which advyse lyked him so well, that he re∣quyred me to take paines therin. But because it was a matter passyng my wit and skyll, and more thankles than gaineful to meddle in, I refused utterly to undertake it, except I might have the help of suche, as in wit were apte, in learnyng al∣lowed, and in judgement and estymacyon able to wield and furnysh so weighty an enterpryse, thinkyng even so to shift my handes. But he, earnest and diligent in his affayres, pro∣cured Atlas to set under his shoulder. For shortly after, divers learned men, whose manye giftes nede fewe prayses, consented to take upon them parte of the travayle. And when certaine of them, to the numbre of seven, were through a general assent at an appoynted tyme and place gathered to∣gether to devyse thereupon, I resorted unto them, bearing the booke of Bochas translated by Dan Lidgate, for the better observation of his order. Which although we liked wel, yet would it not cumly serve, seeing that both Bochas and Lid∣gate were dead; neither were there any alive that meddled with like argument, to whom the UNFORTUNATE might make make their mone. To make therefore a state mete for the matter, they all agreed that I should usurpe Bochas rowme, and the WRETCHED PRINCES complayne unto me: and take upon themselves every man for his parte to be sundry personages, and in their behalfes to bewaile unto ME their

greevous chances, heavye destinies, and wofull misfortunes. This done, we opened such bookes of Cronicles as we had there present. And maister Ferrers, after he had found where Bochas left, which was about the ende of kinge Edwarde the thirdes raigne, to begin the matter sayde thus."</Q></P>

Also king John his brother, as sum saye, poysoned. Are not their histories rufull, and of rare example? But as it should appeare, he being an Italian, minded most the Roman and Italike story, or els perhaps he wanted our countrey Croni∣cles. It were therefore a goodly and a notable matter, to search and discourse our whole story from the first beginning of the inhabiting of the yle. But seeing the printer's minde is, to have us folowe where Lidgate left, we will leave that great labour to other that may intend it, and (as blinde Bayard is alway boldest) I will begyn at the time of Rychard the second, a time as unfortunate as the ruler therein.

<P>Here we see that a company was feigned to be assembled, each of which, one excepted, by turns personates a character of one of the great Unfortunate: and that the stories were all con∣nected, by being related to the silent person of the assembly, who is like the chorus in the Greek tragedies, or the Host in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The whole was to form a sort of dramatic interlude, including a series of independent soliloquies. A continuity to this imagined representation is preserved by the introduction, after every soliloquy, of a prose epilogue, which also serves as a prologue to the succeeding piece, and has the air of a stage-direction. Boccace had done this before. We have this interposition, which I give as a specimen, and which ex∣plains the method of the recital, between the tragedies of king RICHARD THE SECOND and OWEN GLENDOUR. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whan he had ended this so wofull a tragedye, and to all PRINCES a right worthy instruction, we paused: having passed through a miserable tyme, full of pyteous tragedyes.

And fyndynge Owen Glendoure next one of For∣tune's owne whelpes, and the Percyes his confederates, I thought them unmete to be overpassed, and therefore sayd thus to the sylent cumpany, What, my maysters, is every one at once in a browne study, and hath no man affection to any of these storyes? You mynd so much some other belyke, that those do not move you. And to say the trouth, there is no special cause why they should. Howbeyt Owen Glendoure, becaus he was one of Fortune's darlynges, rather than he should be forgotten, I will tel his tale for him, under the privelidge of Martine hundred. Which OWEN, cuming out of the wilde mountains lyke the Image of Death in al pointes, (his darte onlie excepted,) so sore hath famyne and hunger consumed hym, may lament his folly after this maner."</Q> This process was a departure from Sackville's idea: who supposes, as I have hinted, the scene laid in hell, and that the unfortunate princes appeared to him in succession, and ut∣tered their respective complaints, at the gates of Elysium, under the guidance of SORROW.</P>

<Q><LG>
<L>And, first, within the porch and jaws of hell</L>
<L>Sat deep REMORSE OF CONSCIENCE, all besprent</L>
<L>With tears; and to herself oft would she tell</L>
<L>Her wretchedness, and, cursing, never stent</L>
<L>To sob and sigh, but ever thus lament</L>
<L>With thoughtful care; as she that, all in vain,</L>
<L>Would wear and waste continually in pain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="226" REF="330"/>
<L>Her eyes unstedfast, rolling here and there,</L>
<L>Whirl'd on each place, as place that vengeance brought,</L>
<L>So was her mind continually in fear,</L>
<L>Tost and tormented with the tedious thought</L>
<L>Of those detested crimes which she had wrought;</L>
<L>With dreadful cheer, and looks thrown to the sky,</L>
<L>Wishing for death, and yet she could not die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, saw we DREAD, all trembling how he shook,</L>
<L>With foot uncertain, profer'd here and there,;</L>
<L>Benumb'd with speech; and, with a gastly look,</L>
<L>Search'd every place, all pale and dead for fear,</L>
<L>His cap born up with with staring of his hair;</L>
<L>'Stoin'd and amazed at his own shade for dread,</L>
<L>And fearing greater dangers than was need.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, next, within the entry of this lake,</L>
<L>Sat fell REVENGE, gnashing her teeth for ire;</L>
<L>Devising means how she may vengeance take;</L>
<L>Never in rest, 'till she have her desire;</L>

<L>Had show'd herself, as next in order set,</L>
<L>With trembling limbs we softly parted thence,</L>
<L>'Till in our eyes another sight we met;</L>
<L>When fro my heart a sigh forthwith I fet,</L>
<L>Ruing, alas, upon the woeful plight</L>
<L>Of MISERY, that next appear'd in sight:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His face was lean, and some-deal pin'd away<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>And eke his hands consumed to the bone;</L>
<L>But, what his body was, I cannot say,</L>
<L><PB N="227" REF="331"/>
For on his carkass rayment had he none,</L>
<L>Save clouts and patches pieced one by one;</L>
<L>With staff in hand, and scrip on shoulders cast,</L>
<L>His chief defence against the winter's blast:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His food, for most, was wild fruits of the tree,</L>
<L>Unless sometime some crums fell to his share,</L>
<L>Which in his wallet long, God wot, kept he,</L>
<L>As on the which full daint'ly would he fare;</L>
<L>His drink, the running stream, his cup, the bare</L>
<L>Of his palm closed; his bed, the hard cold ground:</L>
<L>To this poor life was MISERY ybound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whose wretched state when we had well beheld,</L>
<L>With tender ruth on him, and on his feers,</L>
<L>In thoughtful cares forth then our pace we held;</L>
<L>And, by and by, another shape appears</L>
<L>Of greedy CARE, still brushing up the breers;</L>
<L>His knuckles knob'd, his flesh deep dinted in,</L>
<L>With tawed hands, and hard ytanned skin:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morrow grey no sooner hath begun</L>
<L>To spread his light, e'en peeping in our eyes,</L>
<L>But he is up, and to his work yrun;</L>
<L>But let the night's black misty mantles rise,</L>
<L>And with foul dark never so much disguise</L>
<L>The fair bright day, yet ceaseth he no while,</L>
<L>But hath his candles to prolong his toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By him lay heavy SLEEP, the cousin of Death,</L>
<L>Flat on the ground, and still as any stone,</L>
<L>A very corpse, save yielding forth a breath;</L>
<L>Small keep took he, whom fortune frowned on,</L>
<L>Or whom she lifted up into the throne</L>
<L>Of high renown, but, as a living death,</L>
<L>So, dead alive, of life he drew the breath:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="228" REF="332"/>
<L>The body's rest, the quiet of the heart,</L>
<L>The travel's ease, the still night's feer was he,</L>

<L>Things oft that chance and oft that never be;</L>
<L>Without respect, esteemed equally</L>
<L>King CROESUS' pomp and IRUS' poverty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And next, in order sad, OLD-AGE we found:</L>
<L>His beard all hoar, his eyes hollow and blind;</L>
<L>With drooping cheer still poring on the ground,</L>
<L>As on the place where nature him assign'd</L>
<L>To rest, when that the sisters had untwin'd</L>
<L>His vital th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad, and ended with their knife</L>
<L>The fleeting course of fast-declining life:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There heard we him with broken and hollow plaint</L>
<L>Rue with himself his end approaching fast,</L>
<L>And all for nought his wretched mind torment</L>
<L>With sweet remembrance of his pleasures past,</L>
<L>And fresh delights of lusty youth forewaste;</L>

<L>That, in such wither'd plight, and wretched pain,</L>
<L>As eld, accompany'd with her lothsome train,</L>
<L>Had brought on him, all were it woe and grief,</L>
<L>He might a while yet linger forth his lief,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And not so soon descend into the pit;</L>
<L>Where Death, when he the mortal corpse hath slain,</L>
<L>With rechless hand in grave doth cover it;</L>
<L><PB N="229" REF="333"/>
Thereafter never to enjoy again</L>
<L>The gladsome light, but, in the ground ylain,</L>
<L>In depth of darkness waste and wear to nought,</L>
<L>As he had ne'er into the world been brought:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who had seen him sobbing how he stood</L>
<L>Unto himself, and how he would bemoan</L>
<L>His youth forepast,—as though it wrought him good</L>
<L>To talk of youth, all were his youth foregone,—</L>
<L>He would have mus'd, and marvel'd much, whereon</L>
<L>This wretched Age should life desire so fain,</L>
<L>And knows full well life doth but length his pain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Crook-back'd he was, tooth-shaken, and blear-eyed;</L>
<L>Went on three feet, and, sometimes, crept on four;</L>
<L>With old lame bones, that rattled by his side;</L>
<L>His scalp all pil'd, and he with eld forelore,</L>
<L>His wither'd fist still knocking at death's door;</L>
<L>Fumbling, and driveling, as he draws his bread;</L>
<L>For brief, the shape and messenger of Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And fast by him pale MALADY was placed:</L>
<L>Sore sick in bed, her colour all foregone;</L>
<L>Bereft of stomach, savour, and of taste,</L>
<L>Ne could she brook no meat but broths alone;</L>
<L>Her breath corrupt; her keepers every one</L>
<L>Abhorring her; her sickness past recure,</L>
<L>Detesting physick, and all physick's cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, O, the doleful sight that then we see!</L>
<L>We turn'd our look, and on the other side</L>
<L>A grisly shape of FAMINE mought we see:</L>
<L>With greedy looks, and gaping mouth, that cry'd</L>
<L>And roar'd for meat, as she should there have dy'd;</L>
<L>Her body thin and bare as any bone,</L>
<L>Whereto was left nought but the case alone,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="230" REF="334"/>
<L>And that, alas, was gnaw'n on every where,</L>
<L>All full of holes; that I ne mought refrain</L>
<L>From tears, to see how she her arms could tear,</L>
<L>And with her teeth gnash on the bones in vain,</L>
<L>When, all for nought, she fain would so sustain</L>
<L>Her starven corpse, that rather seem'd a shade</L>

<L>Great was her force, whom stone-wall could not stay:</L>

<P>These shadowy inhabitants of hell-gate are conceived with the vigour of a creative imagination, and described with great force of expression. They are delineated with that fulness of pro∣portion, that invention of picturesqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tributes, distinctness, animation, and amplit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, of which Spenser is commonly sup∣posed to have given the first specimens in our language, and which are characteristical of his poetry. We may venture to pronounce that Spenser, at least, caught his manner of design∣ing allegorical personages from this model, which so greatly enlarged the former narrow bounds of our ideal imagery, as that it may justly be deemed an original in that style of painting. For we must not forget, that it is to this INDUCTION that Spenser alludes, in a sonnet prefixed to his Pastorals, in 1579, addressed <HI>To the right honourable</HI> THE LORD OF BUCKHURST, <HI>one of her maiesties priuie councell.</HI></P>

<P>Nothing more fully illustrates and ascertains the respective merits and genius of different poets, than a juxtaposition of their performances on similar subjects. Having examined at large Sackville's Descent into Hell, for the sake of throwing a still stronger light on his manner of treating a fiction which gives so large a scope to fancy, I shall employ the remainder of this Section in setting before my reader a general view of Dante's Italian poem, entitled COMMEDIA, containing a description of Hell, Paradise, and Purgatory, and written about the year 1310. In the mean time, I presume that most of my readers will re∣collect and apply the sixth Book of Virgil: to which, however, it may be necessary to refer occasionally.</P>
<P>Although I have before insinuated that Dante has in this poem used the ghost of Virgil for a mystagogue, in imitation of Tully, who in the SOMNIUM Scipionis supposes Scipio to have shewn the other world to his ancestor Africanus, yet at the same time in the invention of his introduction, he seems to have had an eye on the exordium of an old forgotten Florentine

poem called TESORETTO, written in <HI>Frottola,</HI> or a short irre∣gular measure, exhibiting a cyclopede of theoretic and practic philosophy, and composed by his preceptor Brunetto Latini about the year 1270 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. 219.</NOTE>. Brunetto supposes himself lost in a wood, at the foot of a mountain covered with animals, flowers, plants, and fruits of every species, and subject to the supreme command of a wonderful Lady, whom he thus de∣scribes. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Her head touched the heavens, which served at once for a veil and an ornament.

<P>In the middle of a vast solitude he perceives a spectre, of whom he implores pity and help. The spectre hastens to his cries: it was the shade of Virgil, whom Beatrix, Dante's mis∣tress, had sent, to give him courage, and to guide him into the regions of hell <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 219.</NOTE>. Virgil begins a long discourse with Dante; and expostulates with him for chusing to wander through the rough obscurities of a barren and dreary vale, when the top of the neighbouring mountain afforded every delight. The conver∣sation of Virgil, and the name of Beatrix, by degrees dissipate the fears of the poet, who explains his situation. He returns to himself, and compares this revival of his strength and spirits to a flower smitten by the frost of a night, which again lifts its shrinking head, and expands its vivid colours, at the first gleam∣ings of the morning-sun.</P>

<P>Dante, under the conduct of Virgil, penetrates hell. But he does not on this occasion always avail himself of Virgil's descriptions and mythologies. At least the formation of Dante's imageries are of another school. He feigns his hell to be a prodigious and almost bottomless abyss, which from its aperture to its lowest depth preserves a rotund shape: or rather, an immense

perpendicular cavern, which opening as it descends into different circles, forms so many distinct subterraneous regions. We are struck with horror at the commencement of this dread∣ful adventure.</P>

<P>There is a severe solemnity in these abrupt and comprehensive sentences, and they are a striking preparation to the scenes that ensue. But the idea of such an inscription on the brazen portal of hell, was suggested to Dante by books of chivalry; in which the gate of an impregnable enchanted castle, is often inscribed with words importing the dangers or wonders to be found within. Over the door of every chamber in Spenser's necromantic palace of Busyrane, was written a threat to the champions who pre∣sumed to attempt to enter <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">FAIR. QU. iii. xi. 54.</NOTE>. This total exclusion of hope from

<P>I have not time to follow Dante regularly through his dia∣logues and adventures with the crouds of ghosts, antient and modern, which he meets in the course of this infernal journey. In these interviews, there is often much of the party and poli∣tics of his own times, and of allusion to recent facts. Nor have I leisure particularly to display our author's punishments and phantoms. I observe in general, that the ground-work of his hell is classical, yet with many Gothic and extravagant innova∣tions. The burning lakes, the fosses, and fiery towers which surround the city of DIS, and the three Furies which wait at its entrance, are touched with new strokes <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See CANT. ix. vii.</NOTE>. The Gorgons, the Hydra, the Chimera, Cerberus, the serpent of Lerna, and the rest of Virgil's, or rather Homer's, infernal apparitions, are dilated with new touches of the terrible, and sometimes made ridiculous by the addition of comic or incongruous circum∣stances, yet without any intention of burlesque. Because Virgil had mentioned the Harpies in a single word only <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gorgones, HARPYIAEQUE. vi. 289.</NOTE>, in one of the lothsome groves which Dante passes, consisting of trees whose leaves are black, and whose knotted boughs are hard as iron, the Harpies build their nests <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">CANT. xiii.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Cacus, whom Virgil had called <HI>Semifer</HI> in his seventh book,
<PB N="241" REF="345"/>
appears in the shape of a Centaur covered with curling snakes, and on whose neck is perched a dragon hovering with ex∣panded wings <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">CANT. xxv.</NOTE>. It is supposed that Dante took the idea of his INFERNO from a magnificent nightly representation of hell, ex∣hibited by the pope in honour of the bishop of Ostia on the river Arno at Florence, in the year 1304. This is mentioned by the Italian critics in extenuation of Dante's choice of so strange a subject. But why should we attempt to excuse any absurdity in the writings or manners of the middle ages? Dante chose this subject as a reader of Virgil and Homer. The religious MYSTERY represented on the river Arno, however magnificent, was perhaps a spectacle purely orthodox, and perfectly conform∣able to the ideas of the church. And if we allow that it might hint the subject, with all its inconsistencies, it never could have furnished any considerable part of this wonderful compound of clas∣sical and romantic fancy, of pagan and christian theology, of real and fictitious history, of tragical and comic incidents, of fami∣liar and heroic manners, and of satirical and sublime poetry. But the grossest improprieties of this poem discover an origina∣lity of invention, and its absurdities often border on sublimity. We are surprised that a poet should write one hundred cantos on hell, paradise, and purgatory. But this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method: and is common to all early compositions, in which every thing is related circumstantially and without rejection, and not in those general terms which are used by modern writers.</P>
<P>Dante has beautifully enlarged Virgil's short comparison of the souls lingering on the banks of Lethe, to the numerous leaves falling from the trees in Autumn.</P>

<P>In the Fields inhabited by unhappy lovers he sees Semiramis, Achilles, Paris, and Tristan, or sir Tristram. One of the old Italian commentators on this poem says, that the last was an English knight born in <HI>Cornovaglio,</HI> or Cornwall, a city of England <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In the sixteenth Canto of the PARA∣DISO, king Arthur's queen GENEURA, who belongs to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Tristram's romance, is mentioned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among many others of his friends, he sees Francisca the daughter of Guido di Polenta, in whose palace Dante died at Ravenna, and Paulo one of the sons of Malatesta lord of Rimini. This lady fell in love with Paulo; the passion was mutual, and she was betrothed to him in marriage: but her family chose rather that she should be married to Lanciotto, Paulo's eldest brother. This match had the most fatal consequences. The injured lovers could not dissemble or stifle their affection: they were surprised, and both assassinated by Lanciotto. Dante finds the shades of these distinguished victims of an unfortunate attachment at a distance from the rest, in a region of his IN∣FERNO desolated by the most violent tempests. He accosts them both, and Francisca relates their history: yet the conversation is carried on with some difficulty, on account of the impetuosity of the storm which was perpetually raging. Dante, who from many circumstances of his own amours, appears to have possessed the most refined sensibilities about the delicacies of love, en∣quires in what manner, when in the other world, they first com∣municated their passion to each other. Francisca answers, that they were one day sitting together, and reading the romance of LANCELOT; where two lovers were represented in the same critical situation with themselves. Their changes of colour and countenance, while they were reading, often tacitly betrayed
<PB N="243" REF="347"/>
their yet undiscovered feelings. When they came to that passage in the romance, where the lovers, after many tender approaches, are gradually drawn by one uniform reciprocation of involuntary attraction to kiss each other, the book dropped from their hands. By a sudden impulse and an irresistible sympathy, they are tempted to do the same. Here was the commencement of their tragical history.</P>

The giant, says the poet, moved off with us like the mast of a ship <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Dante says, if I understand the pas∣sage right, that the face of one of the giants resembled the Cupola, shaped like a pine-apple, of saint Peter's church at Rome, ibid.

One cannot help observing, what has been indeed already hinted, how judi∣ciously Milton, in a similar argument, has retained the just beauties, and avoided the childish or l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicrous excesses of these bold inventions. At the same time we may remark, how Dante has sometimes heightened, and sometimes diminished by improper additions or misrepresentations, the legitimate descrip∣tions of Virgil.</P>
<P>One of the torments of the Damned in Dante's INFERNO, is the punishment of being eternally confined in lakes of ice.</P>
<Q><L>Eran l'ombre dolenti nell ghiaccia</L>
<L>Mettendo i denti in nota di cicogna <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">CANT. xxxii.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>The ice is described to be like that of the Danube or Tanais. This species of infernal torment, which is neither directly war∣ranted by scripture, nor suggested in the systems of the Platonic fabulists, and which has been adopted both by Shakespeare and
<PB N="248" REF="352"/>
Milton, has its origin in the legendary hell of the monks. The hint seems to have been taken from an obscure text in the Book of JOB, dilated by saint Jerom and the early commen∣tators <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">JOB, xxiv. 19.</NOTE>. The torments of hell, in which the punishment by cold is painted at large, had formed a visionary romance, under the name of saint Patrick's Purgatory or Cave, long before Dante wrote <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. 199. And ADD. EMEND. ibid.</NOTE>. The venerable Bede, who lived in the seventh century, has framed a future mansion of existence for departed souls with this mode of torture. In the hands of Dante it has assumed many fantastic and grotesque circumstances, which make us laugh and shudder at the same time.</P>
<P>In another department, Dante represents some of his crimi∣nals rolling themselves in human ordure. If his subject led him to such a description, he might at least have used decent expressions. But his diction is not here less sordid than his imagery. I am almost afraid to transcribe this gross passage, even in the disguise of the old Tuscan phraseology.</P>

<P>But Dante has displayed more true poetry in describing a real event than in the best of his fictions. This is in the story of Ugolino count of Pisa, the subject of a very capital picture by Reynolds. The poet, wandering through the depths of hell, sees two of the Damned gnawing the sculls of each other, which was their daily food. He enquires the meaning of this dreadful repast.</P>

<P>Ugolino quitting his companion's half-devoured scull, begins his tale to this effect. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We are Ugolin count of Pisa, and archbishop Ruggieri.

And I being seized with blindness began to crawl over them, <HI>sovra ciascuno,</HI> on hands and feet; and for three days after they were dead, continued calling them by their names. At length, famine finished my torments."</Q> Having said this, the poet adds, with distorted eyes he again fixed his teeth on the mangled scull <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. See supr. vol. i. 390. And ESSAY ON POPE, p. 254.</NOTE>. It is not improbable, that the shades of unfortunate men, who described under peculiar situations and with their proper attributes, are introduced relating at large their histories in hell to Dante, might have given the hint to Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, On the Misfortunes of Illustrious Personages, the original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES.</P>
<P>Dante's PURGATORY is not on the whole less fantastic than his HELL. As his hell was a vast perpendicular cavity in the earth, he supposes Purgatory to be a cylindric mass elevated to a prodigious height. At intervals are recesses projecting from the outside of the cylinder. In these recesses, some higher and some lower, the wicked expiate their crimes, according to the proportion of their guilt. From one department they pass to another by steps of stone exceedingly steep. On the top of the whole, or the summit of Purgatory, is a plat-form adorned with trees and vegetables of every kind. This is the Terrestrial Para∣dise, which has been transported hither we know not how, and which forms an avenue to the Paradise Celestial. It is extraor∣dinary that some of the Gothic painters should not have given us this subject.</P>
<P>Dante describes not disagreeably the first region which he traverses on leaving Hell. The heavens are tinged with sapphire, and the star of love, or the sun, makes all the orient laugh. He sees a venerable sage approach. This is Cato of Utica, who, astonished to see a living man in the mansion of ghosts, questions Dante and Virgil about the business which brought them hither. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>y</SUP> PURGAT. CANT. i.</NOTE>
<PB N="252" REF="356"/>
Virgil answers: and Cato advises Virgil to wash Dante's face, which was soiled with the smoak of hell, and to cover his head with one of the reeds which grew on the borders of the neigh∣bouring river. Virgil takes his advice; and having gathered one reed, sees another spring up in its place. This is the golden bough of the Eneid, <HI>uno avulso non deficit alter.</HI> The shades also, as in Virgil, croud to be ferried over Styx: but an angel performs the office of Charon, admitting some into the boat, and rejecting others. This confusion of fable and religion destroys the graces of the one and the majesty of the other.</P>
<P>Through adventures and scenes more strange and wild than any in the Pilgrim's Progress, we at length arrive at the twenty∣first Canto. A concussion of the earth announces the delive∣rance of a soul from Purgatory. This is the soul of Statius, the favorite poet of the dark ages. Although a very improper companion for Virgil, he immediately joins our adventurers, and accompanies them in their progress. It is difficult to discover what pagan or christian idea regulates Dante's dispensation of rewards and punishments. Statius passes from Purgatory to Pa∣radise, Cato remains in the place of expiation, and Virgil is condemned to eternal torments.</P>
<P>Dante meets his old acquaintance Forese, a debauchee of Flo∣rence. On finishing the conversation, Forese asks Dante when he shall have the pleasure of seeing him again. This question in Purgatory is diverting enough. Dante answers with much serious gravity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know not the time of death: but it cannot be too near. Look back on the troubles in which my country is involved <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">CANT. xxiv.</NOTE>!"</Q> The dispute between the pontificate and the empire, appears to have been the predominant topic of Dante's mind. This circumstance has filled Dante's poem with strokes of satire. Every reader of Voltaire must remember that lively writer's paraphrase from the INFERNO, of the story of count Guido, in which are these inimitable lines. A Franciscan friar abandoned to Beelzebub thus exclaims.</P>

<P>Dante thus translated would have had many more readers than at present. I take this opportunity of remarking, that our au∣thor's perpetual reference to recent facts and characters is in imi∣tation of Virgil, yet with this very material difference. The persons recognised in Virgil's sixth book, for instance the chiefs of the Trojan war, are the cotemporaries of the hero not of the poet. The truth is, Dante's poem is a satirical history of his own times.</P>
<P>Dante sees some of the ghosts of Purgatory advancing for∣ward, more meagre and emaciated than the rest. He asks how this could happen in a place where all live alike without nou∣rishment. Virgil quotes the example of Meleager, who wasted with a firebrand, on the gradual extinction of which his life de∣pended. He also produces the comparison of a mirror reflecting a figure. These obscure explications do not satisfy the doubts of Dante. Statius, for his better instruction, explains how a child grows in the womb of the mother, how it is enlarged, and by degrees receives life and intellect. The drift of our
<PB N="254" REF="358"/>
author is apparent in these profound illustrations. He means to shew his skill in a sort of metaphysical anatomy. We see some∣thing of this in the TESORETTO of Brunetto. Unintelligible solutions of a similar sort, drawn from a frivolous and mysterious philosophy, mark the writers of Dante's age.</P>
<P>The PARADISE of Dante, the third part of this poem, re∣sembles his PURGATORY. Its fictions, and its allegories which suffer by being explained, are all conceived in the same chimerical spirit. The poet successively views the glory of the saints, of angels, of the holy Virgin, and at last of God himself.</P>
<P>Heaven as well as hell, among the monks, had its legendary description; which it was heresy to disbelieve, and which was formed on perversions or misinterpretations of scripture. Our author's vision ends with the deity, and we know not by what miraculous assistance he returns to earth.</P>
<P>It must be allowed, that the scenes of Virgil's sixth book have many fine strokes of the terrible. But Dante's colouring is of a more gloomy temperature. There is a sombrous cast in his imagination: and he has given new shades of horror to the classical hell. We may say of Dante, that
<Q><L>—Hell</L>
<L>Grows DARKER at his FROWN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PAR. L. ii. 720.</NOTE>.—</L></Q>
The sensations of fear impressed by the Roman poet are less harrassing to the repose of the mind: they have a more equable and placid effect. The terror of Virgil's tremendous objects is diminished by correctness of composition and elegance of style. We are reconciled to his Gorgons and Hydras, by the grace of expression, and the charms of versification.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it may seem a matter of surprise, that the Italian poets of the thirteenth century who restored, ad∣mired, and studied the classics, did not imitate their beauties. But while they possessed the genuine models of antiquity, their
<PB N="255" REF="359"/>
unnatural and eccentric habits of mind and manners, their at∣tachments to system, their scholastic theology, superstition, ideal love, and above all their chivalry, had corrupted every true princi∣ple of life and literature, and consequently prevented the progress of taste and propriety. They could not conform to the practices and notions of their own age, and to the ideas of the antients, at the same time. They were dazzled with the imageries of Virgil and Homer, which they could not always understand or apply: or which they saw through the mist of prejudice and misconception. Their genius having once taken a false direc∣tion, when recalled to copy a just pattern, produced only con∣straint and affectation, a distorted and unpleasing resemblance. The early Italian poets disfigured, instead of adorning thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> works, by attempting to imitate the classics. The charms which we so much admire in Dante, do not belong to the Greeks and Romans. They are derived from another origin, and must be traced back to a different stock. Nor is it at the same time less surprising, that the later Italian poets, in more enlightened times, should have paid so respectful a compliment to Dante as to acknowledge no other model, and with his excellencies, to transcribe and perpetuate all his extravagancies.</P>

<P>I NOW return to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and to Sackville's Legend of Buckingham, which follows his INDUCTION.</P>
<P><HI>The Complaynt of</HI> HENRYE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, is writ∣ten with a force and even elegance of expression, a copiousness of phraseology, and an exactness of versification, not to be found in any other parts of the collection. On the whole, it may be thought tedious and languid. But that objection unavoidably results from the general plan of these pieces. It is impossible that soliloquies of such prolixity, and designed to include much his∣torical and even biographical matter, should every where sustain a proper degree of spirit, pathos, and interest. In the exor∣dium are these nervous and correct couplets.

<P>Many comparisons are introduced by the distressed speaker. But it is common for the best poets to forget that they are de∣scribing what is only related or spoken. The captive Proteus has his simile of the nightingale; and Eneas decorates his narrative of the disastrous conflagration of Troy with a variety of the most laboured comparisons.</P>
<P>Buckingham in his reproaches against the traiterous behaviour of his antient friend Banastre, utters this forcible exclamation, which breathes the genuine spirit of revenge, and is unloaded with poetical superfluities.</P>

<P>The ingenious writers of these times are perpetually deserting propriety for the sake of learned allusions. Buckingham exhorts the peers and princes to remember the fate of some of the most

renowned heroes of antiquity, whose lives and misfortunes he relates at large, and often in the most glowing colours of poetry. Alexander's murther of Clitus is thus described in stanzas, pro∣nounced by the poet and not by Buckingham.</P>

<P>The most poetical passage of Higgins's performance in this collection is in his Legend of QUEENE CORDILA, or Cordelia, king Lear's youngest daughter <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 36. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Being imprisoned in a dungeon, and <HI>coucht on strawe,</HI> she sees amid the darkness of the night a <HI>griesly ghost</HI> approach,
<Q><L>Eke nearer still with stealing steps shee drewe:</L>
<L>Shee was of colour pale and deadly hewe.</L></Q>
Her garment was figured with various sorts of imprisonment, and pictures of violent and premature death.
<Q><L>Her clothes resembled thousand kindes of thrall,</L>
<L>And pictures plaine of <HI>hastened deathes</HI> withall.</L></Q>
Cordelia, in extreme terror, asks,</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>If Death thou art, I pray thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake an end—</L>

DESPAIR then, throwing her robe aside, shews Cordelia a thousand instruments of death, knives, sharpe swordes, and ponyards, <HI>all bedyde with bloode and poysons.</HI> She presents the sword wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which queen Dido slew herself.</P>

<P>Cordelia takes this sword, <HI>but doubtfull yet to dye.</HI> DESPAIR then represents to her the state and power which she enjoyed in France, her troops of attendants, and the pleasures of the court she had left. She then points out her present melancholy con∣dition and dreary situation.</P>

<P>The three first books of the FAERIE QUEENE were published in 1590. Higgins's Legend of Cordelia in 1587.</P>

In the Legend of king Richard the Thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Niccols appears to have copied some passages from Shakespeare's Tragedy on that history. In the opening of the play Richard says,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Now are our brows bound with victorious w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaths,</L>
<L>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments:</L>

<L>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds,</L>

<L>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</L>
<L>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Act i. Sc. i.</NOTE>.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>These lines evidently gave rise to part of Richard's soliloquy in Niccols's Legend.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>—The battels fought in field before</L>
<L>Were turn'd to meetings of sweet amitie:</L>
<L>The war-god's thundring cannons dreadfull rore,</L>

<P>Part of the tent-scene in Shakespeare is also imitated by Niccols. Richard, starting from his horrid dream, says,</P>

<L>And gainst me gaue a iudgement full of feare <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Pag. 764.</NOTE>.</L>

<P>But some of the stanzas immediately following, which are formed on Shakespeare's ideas, yet with some original imagina∣tion, will give the reader the most favourable idea of Niccols as a contributor to this work.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>This dreadfull dreame my soule did so affray:</L>
<L>When wakt I was from sleepe, I for a space</L>
<L>Thought I had beene in some infernall place.</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>If internal evidence was not a proof, we are sure from other evidences that Shakespeare's tragedy preceded Niccols's legend. The tragedy was written about 1597. Niccols, at eighteen years of age, was admitted into Magdalene college in Oxford, in the year 1602 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Registr. Univ. Oxon. He retired to Magdalene Hall, where he was graduated in Arts, 1606. Ibid.</NOTE>. It is easy to point out other marks of imitation. Shakespeare has taken nothing from Seagars's Ri∣chard the third, printed in Baldwine's collection, or first edition, in the year 1559. Shakespeare, however, probably catched the idea of the royal shades, in the same scene of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tragedy be∣fore us, appearing in succession and speaking to Richard and

Richmond, from the general plan of the MIRROUR OF MA∣GISTRATES: more especially, as many of Shakespeare's ghosts there introduced, for instance, King Henry the sixth, Clarence, Rivers, Hastings, and Buckingham, are the personages of five of the legends belonging to this poem.</P>

<P>That it should have been the object even of an ingenious satirist, is so far from proving that it wanted either merit or popularity, that the contrary conclusion may be justly inferred.

<PB N="276" REF="380"/>
in a general criticism on the style of our most noted poets before the year 1600, places the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES in a high rank. It is under that head of his HYPERCRITICA, entitled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Prime Gardens for gathering English according to the true gage or standard of the tongue about fifteen or sixteen years ago."</Q> The extract is a curious piece of criticism, as writ∣ten by a judicious cotemporary. Having mentioned our prose writers, the chief of which are More, Sidney, queen Elisabeth, Hooker, Saville, cardinal Alan, Bacon, and Raleigh, he pro∣ceeds thus. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In verse there are Edmund Spenser's HYMNES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The pieces mentioned in this extract will be considered in their proper places.</NOTE>. I cannot advise the allowance of other his poems as for practick English, no more than I can Jeffrey Chaucer, Lydgate, Pierce Plowman, or LAUREATE Skelton. It was laid as a fault to the charge of Salust, that he used some old outworn words stoln out of Cato in his books de Originibus. And for an historian in our tongue to affect the like out of those our poets, would be accounted a foul oversight.—My judgement is nothing at all in poems or poesie, and therefore I dare not go far; but will simply deliver my mind concerning those authors among us, whose English hath in my conceit most propriety, and is nearest to the phrase of court, and to the speech used among the noble, and among the better sort in London: the two sovereign seats, and as it were parliament tribunals, to try the question in. Brave language are Chap∣man's Iliads.—The works of Samuel Daniel containe some∣what
<PB N="277" REF="381"/>
aflat, but yet withal a very pure and copious English<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and words as warrantable as any mans, and fitter perhaps for prose than measure. Michael Drayton's Heroical Epistles are well worth the reading also for the purpose of our subject, which is to furnish an English historian with choice and copy of tongue. Queen Elizabeth's verses, those which I have seen and read, some exstant in the elegant, witty, and artificial book of the ART OF ENGLISH POETRIE, the work, as the fame is, of one of her gentlemen-pensioners, Puttenham, are princely as her prose. Never must be forgotten St. PETER'S COMPLAINT, and those other serious poems said to be father Southwell's: the English whereof, as it is most proper, so the sharpness and light of wit is very rare in them. Noble Henry Constable was a great master in English tongue, nor had any gentleman of our nation a more pure, quick, or higher delivery of conceit, witness among all other that Sonnet of his before his Majesty's LEPANTO. I have not seen much of sir Edward Dyer's poetry. Among the lesser late poets, George Gascoigne's Works may be en∣dured. But the best of these times, if Albion's England be not preferred, for our business, is the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and in that MIRROUR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sackvil's INDUC∣TION, the work of Thomas afterward earl of Dorset and lord treasurer of England: whose also the famous Tragedy of GORDOBUC, was the best of that time, even in sir Philip Sidney's judgement; and all skillful Englishmen cannot but ascribe as much thereto, for his phrase and eloquence therein. But before in age, if not also in noble, courtly, and lustrous English, is that of the Songes and Sonnettes of Henry Howard earl of Surrey, (son of that victorious prince, the duke of Norfolk, and father of that learned Howard his most lively image Henry earl of Northampton,) written chiefly by him, and by sir Thomas Wiat, not the dangerous commotioner, but his worthy father. Nevertheless, they who commend those poems and exercises of honourable wit, if they have
<PB N="278" REF="382"/>
seen that incomparable earl of Surrey his English translation of Virgil's Eneids, which, for a book or two, he admirably rendreth, almost line for line, will bear me witness that those other were foils and sportives. The English poems of sir Walter Raleigh, of John Donne, of Hugh Holland, but especially of sir Foulk Grevile in his matchless MUSTAPHA, are not easily to be mended. I dare not presume to speak of his Majesty's exercises in this heroick kind. Because I see them all left out in that which Montague lord bishop of Win∣chester hath given us of his royal writings. But if I should declare mine own rudeness rudely, I should then confess, that I never tasted English more to my liking, nor more smart, and put to the height of use in poetry, than in that vital, judicious, and most practicable language of Benjamin Jonson's poems <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Bolton's HYPERCRITICA, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Or a Rule of Judgement for writing or read∣ing our Historys."</Q> ADDRESSE, iv.

<P>It is reasonable to suppose, that the publication of the MIR∣ROUR OF MAGISTRATES enriched the stores, and extended the limits, of our drama. These lives are so many tragical speeches in character. We have seen, that they suggested scenes to Shake∣speare. Some critics imagine, that HISTORICAL Plays owed their origin to this collection. At least it is certain, that the writers of this MIRROUR were the first who made a poetical use of the English chronicles recently compiled by Fabyan, Hall, and Hollinshed, which opened a new field of subjects and events; and, I may add, produced a great revolution in the state of popular knowledge. For before those elaborate and volumi∣nous compilations appeared, the History of England, which had been shut up in the Latin narratives of the monkish annalists, was unfamiliar and almost unknown to the general reader.</P>

<P>IN tracing the gradual accessions of the MIRROUR OF MA∣GISTRATES, an incidental departure from the general line of our chronologic series has been incurred. But such an anti∣cipation was unavoidable, in order to exhibit a full and uninter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upted view of that poem, which originated in the reign of Mary, and was not finally completed till the beginning of the seventeenth century. I now therefore return to the reign of queen Mary.</P>
<P>To this reign I assign Richard Edwards, a native of Somer∣setshire about the year 1523. He is said by Wood to have been a scholar of Corpus Christi college in Oxford: but in his early years, he was employed in some department about the court. This circumstance appears from one of his poems in the PARA∣DISE OF DAINTIE DEVISES, a miscellany which contains many of his pieces.</P>

<P>In the year 1547, he was appointed a senior student of Christ∣church in Oxford, then newly founded. In the British Museum

Hence we may conjecture, that he did not long remain at the university. About this time he was pro∣bably a member of Lincoln's-inn. In the year 1561, he was constituted a gentleman of the royal chapel by queen Elisabeth, and master of the singing boys there. He had received his musical education, while at Oxford, under George Etheridge <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">George Etheridge, born at Thame in Oxfordshire, was admitted Scholar of Cor∣pus Christi college Oxford, under the tui∣tion of the learned John Shepreve, in 1534.

In 1556, he was recommended by lord Wil∣liams of Thame, to Sir Thomas Pope founder of Trinity college in Oxford, to be admitted a fellow of his college at its first foundation. But Etheridge chusing to pursue the medical line, that scheme did not take effect. He was persecuted for popery by queen Elisabeth at her ac∣cession: but afterwards practised physic at Oxford with much reputation, and estab∣lished a private seminary there for the in∣struction of catholic youths in the classi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, music, and logic.

<P>When queen Elisabeth visited Oxford in 1566, she was at∣tended by Edwards, who was on this occasion employed to com∣pose a play called PALAMON AND ARCITE, which was acted before her majesty in Christ-church hall <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. 382.</NOTE>. I believe it was never printed. Another of his plays is DAMON AND PYTHIAS, which was acted at court.

He probably wrote many other dramatic pieces now lost. Puttenham having mentioned lord Buckhurst and Master Edward Ferrys, or Ferrers, as most eminent in tra∣gedy, gives the prize to Edwards for Comedy and Interlude <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">ARTE OF ENGLISH POETRY. fol. 51.</NOTE>. The word Interlude is here of wide extent. For Edwards, be∣sides that he was a writer of regular dramas, appears to have been a contriver of masques, and a composer of poetry for pa∣geants. In a word, he united all those arts and accomplish∣ments which minister to popular pleasantry: he was the first fiddle, the most fashionable sonnetteer, the readiest rhymer, and the most facetious mimic, of the court. In consequence of his love and his knowledge of the histrionic art, he taught the choristers over which he presided to act plays; and they were formed into a company of players, like those of saint Paul's cathedral, by the queen's licence, under the superintendency of Edwards <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. 393.</NOTE>.</P>

See supr. p. 213. I am now con∣vinced that they have been confounded, and that they are one and the same man. We have already seen, and from good au∣thority, that GEORGE Ferrers was Lord of Misrule to the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that is, among other things of a like kind, a writer of court interludes or plays; and that king Edward the sixth <HI>had great delight in his pastimes.</HI> See supr. vol. ii. 381. The confu∣sion appears to have originated from Putten∣ham, the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH PO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SIE, who has inadvertently given to GEORGE the christian name of EDWARD. But his account, or character, of this ED∣WARD Ferrers has served <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o lead us to the truth. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But the principall man in this profession [poetry] at the same time [of Edward the six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h] was maister ED∣WARD Ferrys, a man of no lesse mirth and felici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie that way, but of much more skil and magnificence in his meeter, and therefore wrate for the most part to the stage in Tragedie and sometimes in Co∣medie, or Enterlude, wherein he gave the king so much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewardes."</Q> Lib. i. ch. xxxi. pag. 49. edit. 1589. And again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For Tragedie the Lord Buck∣hurst, and maister Edward Ferrys, for such doinges as I have sene of theirs, deserve the highest price."</Q> Ibid. p. 51. His Tragedies, with the <HI>magnificent meeter,</HI> are perhaps nothing more than the stately monologues in the MIRROUR OF MAGIS∣TRATES; and he might have written o∣thers either for the stage in general, or the more private entertaiment of the court, now lost, and probably never printed. His Comedie and Enterlude are perhaps to be understood, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een, not so much re∣gular and professed dramas for a theatre, as little dramatic mumm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries for the court∣holidays, or other occasional festivities. The court-shows, like this at Kenilworth, were accompanied with personated dia∣logues in verse, and the whole pageantry was often styled an interlude. This rea∣soning also accounts for Puttenham's s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em∣ing omission, in not having enumerated the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, by name, among the shining poems of his age. I have before observed, what is much to our purpose, that no plays of an EDWARD Ferrers, (or Ferrys, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same,) in print or manuscript, are now known to exist, nor are mentioned by any writer of the times with which we are now concern∣ed. GEORGE Ferrers at least, from what actually remains of him, has some title to the dramatic character. Our GEORGE Ferrers, from the part he bore in the ex∣hibitions at Kenilworth, appears to have been employed as a writer of metrical speeches or dialogues to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoken in cha∣racter, long after he had left the office of lord of misrule.

<P>I also take this opportunity, the earliest which has occurred, of retracting ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her slight mistake. See supr. p. 272.

and persuaded him he was some great Duke. The poore fellow admiring how he came there, was served in state all day long: after supper he saw them dance, heard musicke, and all the rest of those court-like pleasures. But late at night, when he was well tipled, and againe faste asleepe, they put on his old robes, and so conveyed him to the place where they first found him. Now the fellowe had not made there so good sport the day before, as he did now when he returned to himselfe; all the jest was, to see how he looked upon it. In conclusion, after some little admiration, the poore man told his friends he had seene a vision, constantly believed it, would not otherwise be persuaded, and so the joke ended <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burton's ANATOMY OF MELANCHO∣LY.

<P>ABOUT the same time flourished Thomas Tusser, one of our earliest didactic poets, in a science of the highest uti∣lity, and which produced one of the most beautiful poems of antiquity. The vicissitudes of this man's life have uncommon variety and novelty for the life of an author, and his history conveys some curious traces of the times as well as of himself. He seems to have been alike the sport of fortune, and a dupe to his own discontented disposition and his perpetual propensity to change of situation.</P>
<P>He was born of an antient family, about the year 1523, at Rivenhall in Essex; and was placed as a chorister, or singing∣boy, in the collegiate chapel of the castle of Wallingford in Berkshire <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This chapel had a dean, six preben∣daries, six clerks, and four choris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers. It was dissolved in 1549.</NOTE>. Having a fine voice, he was impressed from Wal∣lingford college into the king's chapel. Soon afterwards he was admitted into the choir of saint Paul's cathedral in London; where he made great improvements under the instruction of John Redford the organist, a famous musician. He was next sent to Eton-school, where, at one chastisement, he received fifty-three stripes of the rod, from the severe but celebrated master Nicholas Udall <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Udall's English interludes, mentioned above, were perhaps written for his scho∣lars.

In this de∣partment he lived ten years: but being disgusted with the vices, and wearied with the quarrels of the courtiers, he retired into the country, and embraced the profession of a farmer, which he successively practised at Ratwood in Sussex, Ipswich in Suffolk, Fairstead in Essex, Norwich, and other places <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In Peacham's MINERVA, a book of emblems printed in 1612, there is the de∣vice of a whetstone and a scythe with these lines, fol. 61. edit. 4to.

Under the latter he procured the place of a singing-man in Norwich cathedral. At length, having perhaps too much philo∣sophy and too little experience to succeed in the business of agri∣culture, he returned to London: but the plague drove him away from town, and he took shelter at Trinity college in Cambridge. Without a tincture of careless imprudence, or vicious extragance, this desultory character seems to have thrived in no vocation. Fuller says, that his stone, <HI>which gathered no moss,</HI> was the stone of Sisyphus. His plough and his poetry were alike unprofitable. He was by turns a fiddler and a farmer, a grasier and a poet with equal success.

<P>Before I proceed, I must say a few words concerning the very remarkable practice implied in these stanzas, of seizing boys by a warrant for the service of the king's chapel. Strype has printed an abstract of an instrument, by which it appears, that emissaries were dispatched into various parts of England with full powers to take boys from any choir for the use of the chapel of king Edward the sixth. Under the year 1550, says Strype, there was a grant of a commission <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to Philip Van Wilder gen∣tleman of the Privy Chamber, in anie churches or chappells within England to take to the king's use, such and as many

ECCL. ii. p. 538.</NOTE>."</Q> And again, in the following year, the master of the king's chapel, that is, the master of the king's singing-boys, has licence <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to take up from time to time as many children [boys] to serve in the king's chapel as he shall think fit <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 539.

I presume this appointment was transmitted from pre∣ceding reigns.</NOTE>."</Q> Under the year 1454, there is a commission of the same sort from king Henry the sixth, <HI>De ministrallis propter solatium regis providendis,</HI> for procuring minstrels, even by force, for the solace or enter∣tainment of the king: and it is required, that the minstrels so procured, should be not only skilled <HI>in arte minstrallatus,</HI> in the art of minstrelsy, but <HI>membris naturalibus elegantes,</HI> handsome and elegantly shaped <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> FOED. xi. 375.</NOTE>. As the word Minstrel is of an extensive signification, and is applied as a general term to every character of that species of men whose business it was to entertain, either with oral recitation, music, gesticulation, and singing, or with a mixture of all these arts united, it is certainly difficult to de∣termine, whether singers only, more particularly singers for the royal chapel, were here intended. The last clause may perhaps more immediately seem to point out tumblers or posture-masters <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Even so late as the present reign of qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Mary, we find tumblers introduced for the diversion of the court.

<P>It must be acknowledged, that this old English georgic has much more of the simplicity of Hesiod, than of the elegance of Virgil: and a modern reader would suspect, that many of its salutary maxims originally decorated the margins, and illus∣trated the calendars, of an antient almanac. It is without in∣vocations, digressions, and descriptions: no pleasing pictures of rural imagery are drawn from meadows covered with flocks and fields waving with corn, nor are Pan and Ceres once named. Yet it is valuable, as a genuine picture of the agriculture, the rural arts, and the domestic economy and customs, of our industrious ancestors.</P>

<P>AMONG Antony Wood's manuscripts in the Bodleian library at Oxford, I find a poem of considerable length written by William Forrest, chaplain to queen Mary <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In folio. MSS. Cod. A. Wood. Num. 2. They were purchased by the univer∣sity after Wood's death.</NOTE>. It is entitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A true and most notable History of a right noble and famous Lady produced in Spayne entitled the second GRESIELD, practised not long out of this time in much part tragedous as delectable both to hearers and readers."</Q> This is a panegyrical history in octave rhyme, of the life of queen Catharine, the first queen of king Henry the eighth. The poet compares Catharine to patient Grisild, celebrated by Petrarch and Chaucer, and Henry to earl Walter her husband <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The affecting story of PATIENT GRI∣SILD seems to have long kept up its cele∣brity. In the books of the Stationers, in 1565, Owen Rogers has a licence to print <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a ballat intituled the songe of pacyent Gressell vnto hyr make."</Q> REGISTR. A. fol. 132. b.

Colwell ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a second edition of this history in 1568. Ibid. fol. 177. a. Instances occur much lower.</NOTE>. Catha∣rine had certainly the patience and conjugal compliance of Gri∣sild: but Henry's cruelty was not, like Walter's, only artificial and assumed. It is dedicated to queen Mary: and Wood's ma∣nuscript, which was once very superbly bound and embossed, and is elegantly written on vellum, evidently appears to have been the book presented by the author to her majesty. Much of its antient finery is tarnished: but on the brass bosses at each corner is still discernible AVE, MARIA GRATIA PLENA. At the end
<PB N="312" REF="416"/>
is this colophon. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here endeth the Historye of Grysilde the second, dulie meanyng Queene Catharine mother to our most dread soveraigne Lady queene Mary, fynysched the xxv day of June, the yeare of owre Lorde 1558.

Forrest was a student at Oxford, at the time when this notable and knotty point of casuistry prostituted the learning of all the universities of Europe, to the gratification of the capricious amours of a libidinous and implacable tyrant. He has recorded many particulars and local incidents of what passed in Oxford during that transaction <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In the first chapter, he thus speaks of the towardliness of the princess Catha∣rine's younger years.

He adds, that she was a pure virgin when married to the king: and that her first husband prince Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, on account of his tender years, never slept with her.</NOTE>. At the end of the poem is a metrical ORA∣TION CONSOLATORY, in six leaves, to queen Mary.</P>
<P>In the British Museum is another of Forrest's poems, written in two splendid folio volumes on vellum, called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The tragedious troubles of the most chast and innocent Joseph, son to the holy patriarch Jacob,"</Q> and dedicated to Thomas Howard duke of Norfolk <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">MSS.

To what I have before said of Robert Copland as a poet (supr. vol. ii. p. 300.) may be added, that he prefixed an English copy of verses to the <HI>Mirrour of the Church of saynt Austin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Abyngdon,</HI> &amp;c. Printed by himself, 1521. 4to. Another to Andrew Chertsey's PAS∣SIO DOMINI, ibid. 1521. 4to. (See supr. p. 80.) He and his brother William printed s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veral romances before 1530.</NOTE>. I ought to have observed before, that Forrest translated into English metre fifty of David's Psalms, in 1551, which are dedicated to the duke of Somerset, the Protector <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MSS. REG. 17 A. xxi.</NOTE>. Hence we are led to suspect, that our author could accommodate his faith to the reigning powers. Many more of his manuscript pieces both in prose and verse, all pro∣fessional and of the religious kind, were in the hands of Robert earl of Ailesbury <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 124. Fox says, that he paraphrased the PATER NOS∣TER in English verse, Pr. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our Father which in heaven doth sit."</Q> Also the TE DEUM, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thanksgiving hymn for queen Mary, Pr. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O God thy name we magnifie."</Q> Fox, MART. p. 1139. edit. vet.</NOTE>. Forrest, who must have been living at Ox∣ford, as appears from his poem on queen Catharine, so early as the year 1530, was in reception of an annual pension of six pounds from Christ-church in that university, in the year 1555 <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">MSS. Le Neve. From a long chapter in his KATHARINE, about the building of Christ-church and the regimen of it, he appears to have been of that college.</NOTE>. He was eminently skilled in music: and with much diligence and expence, he collected the works of the most excellent Eng∣lish composers, that were his cotemporaries. These, being the choicest compositions, of John Taverner of Boston, organist of Cardinal-college now Christ-church at Oxford, John Merbeck who first digested our present church-service from the notes of the Roman missal, Fairfax, Tye, Sheppard, Norman, and others, falling after Forrest's death into the possession of doctor Wil∣liam Hether, founder of the musical praxis and professorship at
<PB N="314" REF="418"/>
at Oxford in 1623, are now fortunately preserved at Oxford, in the archives of the music-school assigned to that institution.</P>
<P>In the year 1554, a poem of two sheets, in the spirit and stanza of Sternhold, was printed under the title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The VN∣GODLINESSE OF THE HETHNICKE GODDES, or <HI>The Down∣fall of Diana of the Ephe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians,</HI> by J.

The writer, whose arguments are as weak as his poetry, attempts to prove, that the customary mode of training youths in the Roman poets encouraged idolatry and pagan superstition. This was a topic much laboured by the puritans. Prynne, in that chapter of his HISTRIOMASTIX, where he exposes <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the obscenity, ribaldry, amorousnesse, HEA∣THENISHNESSE, and prophanesse, of most play-bookes, Ar∣cadias, and fained histories that are now so much in admira∣tion,"</Q> acquaints us, that the infallible leaders of the puritan persuasion in the reign of queen Elisabeth, among which are two bishops, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve solemnly prohibited all christians, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to pen, to print, to sell, to read, or school-masters and others to teach, any amorous wanton Play-bookes, Histories, or Heathen authors, especially Ovid's wanton Epistles and Bookes of love, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Martiall, the Comedies of Plautus, Terence, and other such amorous bookes, savoring either of Pagan Gods, of Ethnicke rites and ceremonies, of scurrility, amorousnesse, and prophanesse <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Pag 913. 916.</NOTE>."</Q> But the classics were at length condemned by a much higher authority. In the year 1582, one Christopher Ocland, a schoolmaster of Chelten∣ham, published two poems in Latin hexameters, one entitled ANGLORUM PRAELIA, the other ELIZABETHA <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Londini.

<P>Hollingshead mentions Lucas Shepherd of Colchester, as an eminent poet of queen Mary's reign <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">CHRON. vol. iii. p. 1168.</NOTE>. I do not pretend to any great talents for decyphering; but I presume, that this is the same person who is called by Bale, from a most injudicious affec∣tation of Latinity, Lucas OPILIO. Bale affirms, that his co∣temporary, Opilio, was a very facetious poet: and means to pay him a still higher compliment in pronouncing him not inferior even to Skelton for his rhimes <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Par. post. p. 109.</NOTE>. It is unlucky, that Bale, by disguising his name, should have contributed to conceal this writer so long from the notice of posterity, and even to coun∣teract his own partiality. Lucas Shepherd, however, appears to have been nothing more than a petty pamphleteer in the cause of Calvinism, and to have acquired the character of a poet from a metrical translation of some of David's Psalms about the year 1554. Bale's narrow prejudices are well known. The puritans never suspected that they were greater bigots than the papists. I believe one or two of Shepherd's pieces in prose are among bishop Tanner's books at Oxford.</P>
<P>Bale also mentions metrical English versions of ECCLE∣SIASTES, of the histories of ESTHER, SUSANNAH, JUDITH, and of the TESTAMENT OF THE TWELVE PATRIARCHS, printed and written about this period, by John Pullaine, one of the original students of Christ-church at Oxford, and at length archdeacon of Colchester.

<P>IT appears, however, that the cultivation of an English style began to be now regarded. At the general restoration of knowledge and taste, it was a great impediment to the progress of our language, that all the learned and ingenious, aiming at the character of erudition, wrote in Latin. English books were written only by the superficial and illiterate, at a time when judgment and genius should have been exerted in the nice and critical task of polishing a rude speech. Long after the inven∣tion of typography, our vernacular style, instead of being strengthened and refined by numerous compositions, was only corrupted with new barbarisms and affectations, for want of able and judicious writers in English. Unless we except sir Thomas More, whose DIALOGUE ON TRIBULATION, and HISTORY OF RICHARD THE THIRD, were esteemed standards of style so low as the reign of James the first, Roger Ascham was perhaps the first of our scholars who ventured to break the shackles of Latinity, by publishing his TOXOPHILUS in English; chiefly with a view of giving a pure and correct model of English composition, or rather of shewing how a subject might be treated with grace and propriety in En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lish as well as in Latin. His own vindication of his conduct in attempting this great innova∣tion is too sensible to be omitted, and reflects light on the revo∣lutions of our poetry. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for the Lattine or Greeke tongue, euerye thinge is so excellentlye done in Them, that none can do better.

part haue bene alwayes most redye to write. And they which had least hope in Lattine haue bene most bould in Englishe: when surelye euerye man that is most ready to talke, is not most able to write. He that will write well in any tongue, must folow this counsell of Aristotle; to speake as the com∣mon people do, to thinke as wise men do. And so shoulde euerye man vnderstand him, and the iudgement of wise men alowe him. Manye Englishe writers haue not done so; but vsinge straunge wordes, as Lattine, French, and Italian, do make all thinges darke and harde. Ones I communed with a man, which reasoned the Englishe tongue to be enriched and encreased thereby, sayinge, Who will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prayse that feast where a man shall drincke at a dinner both wyne, ale, and beere? Truly, quoth I, they be al good, euery one taken by himselfe alone; but if you put Malmesye and sacke, redde wyne and white, ale and beere, and al in one pot, you shall make a drinke neither easye to be knowen, nor yet holsome for the bodye. Cicero in folowing Isocrates, Plato, and De∣mosthenes, encreased the Lattine tongue after another sort. This way, because diuers men that write do not know, they can neyther folow it because of their ignoraunce, nor yet will prayse it for uery arrogancy: two faultes seldome the one out of the others companye. Englishe writers by diuersitie of tyme haue taken diuers matters in hand. In our fathers tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing was red, but bookes of fayned cheualrie, wherein a man by readinge should be led to none other ende but only to manslaughter and baudrye. If anye man suppose they were good enough to passe the time withall, he is deceiued. For surely vaine wordes do worke no smal thinge in vaine, ignorant, and yong mindes, specially if they be geuen any thing thervnto of their owne nature.

Leonarde Cox, a schoolmaster, patronised by Farringdon the last abbot of Reading, had published in 1530, as I have observed, an English tract on rhetoric, which is nothing more than a technical and elementary man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. Wilson's treatise is more liberal, and discursive; illus∣trating the arts of eloquence by example, and examining and ascertaining the beauties of composition with the speculative skill and sagacity of a critic.

<P>I must premise, that Wilson, one of the most accomplished scholars of his times, was originally a fellow of King's Col∣lege <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Admitted scholar in 1541. A native of Lincolnshire. MS. Hatcher.</NOTE>, where he was tutor to the two celebrated youths Henry and Charles Brandon dukes of Suffolk. Being a doctor of laws, he was afterwards one of the ordinary masters of requests, master of saint Katharine's hospital near the Tower, a frequent embas∣sador from queen Elisabeth to Mary queen of Scots, and into the Low countries, a secretary of state and a privy counsellor, and at length, in 1579, dean of Durham. He died in 1581. His remarkable diligence and dispatch in negotiation is said to have resulted from an uncommon strength of memory. It is another proof of his attention to the advancement of our English style, that he translated seven orations of Demosthenes, which, in 1570, he dedicated to sir William Cecill <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Which had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en also translated into Latin by Nicholas Carr.

In that year Thomas Sibilet published his <HI>Art poe∣tique</HI> at Paris, <HI>Veuve</HI> François Regnault <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In 16mo.</NOTE>. This piece preserves many valuable anecdotes of the old French poetry: and, among other particulars which develope the state of the old French drama, has the following sensible strictures. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The French farce contains little or nothing of the Latin comedy. It has neither acts nor scenes, which would only serve to introduce a tedious prolixity: for the true subject of the French farce, or SOTTIE, is every sort of foolery which has a tendency to provoke laughter.—The subject of the Greek and Latin comedy was totally different from every thing on the French stage. For it had more morality than drollery, and often as much truth as fiction. Our MORALITIES hold a place in∣differently between tragedy and comedy: but our farces are
<PB N="351" REF="453"/>
really what the Romans called mimes, or <HI>Priapées,</HI> the in∣tended end and effect of which was excessive laughter, and on that account they admitted all kinds of licentiousness, as our farces do at present. In the mean time, their pleasantry does not derive much advantage from rhymes, however flowing, of eight syllables <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. ii. ch. viii. At the end of Sibi∣let's work is a critical piece of Quintil against Ch. Fontaine, first printed sepa∣rately at Paris, 1538. 16mo.</NOTE>."</Q> Sibilet's work is chiefly founded on Horace. His definitions are clear and just, and his precepts well explained. The most curious part of it is the enumeration of the poets who in his time were of most repute. Jacques Pelletier du Mans, a physician, a mathematician, a poet, and a volumi∣nous writer on various subjects both in prose and verse, also pub∣lished an ART POETIQUE at Lyons, in 1555 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">By Jean de Tournes. 8vo.</NOTE>. This critic had sufficient penetration to perceive the false and corrupt taste of his cotemporaries. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Instead of the regular ode and sonnet, our language is sophisticated by <HI>ballads, roundeaux, lays,</HI> and <HI>triolets.</HI> But with these we must rest contented, till the farces which have so long infatuated our nation are converted into comedy, our martyr-plays into tragedy, and our romances into heroic poems <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ch. de L'ODE.</NOTE>."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have no pieces in our language written in the genuine comic form, except some affected and unnatural MORALITIES, and other plays of the same character, which do not deserve the name of comedy. The drama would appear to advantage, did it but resume its proper state and antient dignity.

<P>The Italian vernacular criticism began chiefly in commenta∣ries and discourses on the language and phraseology of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccace. I believe one of the first of that kind is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Le tre Fontane di Nicolò Liburnio sopra la grammatica, e l'eloquenza di Dante, del Petrarcha, e del Boccacio.

Immediately after the publication of their respective poems, Ariosto, whose ORLANDO FURIOSO was styled the <HI>nuova poesia,</HI> and Tasso, were illustrated or expounded by com∣mentators more intricate than their text.

But I resign this labyrinth of research to the superior opportunities and abilities of the French and Italian antiquaries in their native literature. To have said nothing on the subject might have been thought an omission, and to have said more, impertinent. I therefore return to our own poetical annals.</P>
<P>Our three great poets, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate, seem to have maintained their rank, and to have been in high repu∣tation, during the period of which we are now treating. Splen∣did impressions of large works were at this time great under∣takings. A sumptuous edition of Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS was published by Berthelette in 1554. On the same ample plan, in 1555, Robert Braham printed with great accuracy, and a dili∣gent investigation of the antient copies, the first correct edition of Lydgate's TROYBOKE <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more incorrect than the first edition in 1513.</NOTE>. I have before incidentally remarked <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. ii. p. 44.</NOTE>, that Nicholas Briggam, a polite scholar, a student at Oxford and at the Inns of Court, and a writer of poetry, in the year 1555, deposited the bones of Chaucer under a new tomb, erected at his own cost, and inscribed with a new epitaph, in the chapel of bishop Blase in Westminster abbey, which still remains <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Undoubtedly Chaucer was originally buried in this place. Leland <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites a Latin elegy, or NAENIA, of thirty-four lines, which he says was composed by Stephanus Surigonius of Milan, at the request of William Caxton the printer: and which, Leland adds, was written on a white tablet by Surigoniu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on a pillar near Chaucer's grave in the south ile at Westminster.

this must be restricted to the courtiers of Edward the sixth. And indeed there is a peculiar reason why Chaucer, exclusive of his real excellence, should have been the favorite of a court which laid the foundations of the reformation of religion. It was, that his poems abounded with satyrical strokes against the corruptions of the church, and the dissolute manners of the monks. And undoubtedly Chaucer long before, a lively and popular writer, greatly assisted the doctrines of his cotemporary Wickliffe, in opening the eyes of the people to the absur∣dities of popery, and exposing its impostures in a vein of hu∣mour and pleasantry. Fox the martyrologist, a weak and a cre∣dulous compiler, perhaps goes too far in affirming, that Chaucer has undeniably proved the pope to be the antichrist of the apocalypse <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Tom. ii. p. 42. edit. 1684.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the reign of queen Mary, we are accustomed to conceive every thing that is calamitous and disgusting. But when we turn our eyes from its political evils to the objects which its literary history presents, a fair and flourishing scene ap∣pears. In this prospect, the mind feels a repose from con∣templating the fates of those venerable prelates, who suf∣fered the most excruciating death for the purity and inflexi∣bility of their faith; and whose unburied bodies, dissipated in ashes, and undistinguished in the common mass, have ac∣quired a more glorious monument, than if they had been inter∣red in magnificent shrines, which might have been visited by pilgrims, loaded with superstitious gifts, and venerated with the pomp of mistaken devotion.</P>

<P>It is no part of my plan, accurately to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark the progress of our drama, much less to examine the merit of particular plays. But as this piece is perhaps the first specimen in our language of an heroic tale, written in blank verse, divided into acts and scenes, and cloathed in all the formalities of a regular tragedy,

it seems justly to deserve a more minute and a distinct discussion in this general view of our poetry.</P>
<P>It was first exhibited in the great Hall of the Inner Temple, by the students of that Society, as part of the entertainment of a grand Christmas, and afterwards before queen Elisabeth at Whitehall, on the eighteenth day of January in 1561.

I believe it was printed before that of 1571, for it retains all the errors of Griffith's first or spurious edition of 1565. In the Preface prefixed to the edition of 1571, is the following passage. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where [whereas] this tragedy was for furniture of part of the grand Christmasse in the Inner-temple, first written about nine years ago by the right honourable Thomas now lord Buck∣hurst, and by T.

Mr. Garrick had another old quarto edition, printed by Alde, in 1590.</P>
<P>These are the circumstances of the fable of this tragedy. Gordobuc, a king of Britain about six hundred years before Christ, made in his life-time a division of his kingdom to his sons Ferrex and Porrex. The two young princes within five years quarrelled for universal sovereignty. A civil was ensued, and Porrex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew his elder brother Ferrex. Their mother Viden, who loved Ferrex best, revenged his death by entering Porrex's chamber in the night, and murthering him in his sleep. The people, exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perated at the cruelty and treachery of this murther, rose in rebellion, and killed both Viden and Gordobuc. The nobility then assembled, collected an army, and destroyed the
<PB N="358" REF="460"/>
rebels. An intestine war commenced between the chief lords: the succession of the crown became uncertain and arbitrary, for want of the lineal royal issue: and the country, destitute of a king, and wasted by domestic slaughter, was reduced to a state of the most miserable desolation.</P>
<P>In the dramatic conduct of this tale, the unities of time and place are eminently and visibly violated: a defect which Shake∣speare so frequently commits, but which he covers by the magic of his poetry. The greater part of this long and eventful history is included in the representation. But in a story so fertile of bloodshed, no murther is committed on the stage. It is worthy of remark, that the death of Porrex in the bed-chamber is only related. Perhaps the players had not yet learned to die, nor was the ponyard so essential an article as at present among the im∣plements of the property-room. Nor is it improbable, that to kill a man on the stage was not now avoided as a spectacle shocking to humanity, but because it was difficult and incon∣venient to be represented. The writer has followed the series of facts related in the chronicles without any material varia∣tion, or fictitious embarrassments, and with the addition only of a few necessary and obvious characters.</P>
<P>There is a Chorus of Four Antient and Sage Men of Britain, who regularly close every Act, the last excepted, with an ode in long-lined stanzas, drawing back the attention of the au∣dience to the substance of what has just passed, and illustrating it by recapitulatory moral reflections, and poetical or historical allusions. Of these the best is that which terminates the fourth Act, in which prince Porrex is murthered by his mother Viden. These are the two first stanzas.</P>

<P>Every Act is introduced, as was the custom in our old plays, with a piece of machinery called the DUMB SHOW, shadowing by an allegorical exhibition the matter that was immediately to follow. In the construction of this spectacle and its personi∣fications, much poetry and imagination was often displayed. It is some apology for these prefigurations, that they were com∣monly too mysterious and obscure, to forestal the future events with any degree of clearness and precision. Not that this mute mimicry was always typical of the ensuing incidents. It some∣times served for a compendious introduction of such circum∣stances, as could not commodiously be comprehended within the bounds of the representation. It sometimes supplied deficien∣cies, and covered the want of business. Our ancestors were easily satified with this artificial supplement of one of the most important unities, which abundantly filled up the interval that was necessary to pass, while a hero was expected from the Holy Land, or a princess was imported, married, and brought to bed.
<PB N="361" REF="463"/>
mean time, the greater part of the audience were probably more pleased with the emblematical pageantry than the poetical dia∣logue, although both were alike unintelligible.</P>
<P>I will give a specimen in the DOMME SHEWE preceding the fourth act. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"First, the musick of howeboies began to plaie. Duringe whiche, there came forth from vnder the stage, as thoughe out of hell, three Furies, ALECTO, MEGERA, and CTESIPHONE <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tisiphone.</NOTE>, clad in blacke garments sprinkled with bloud and flames, their bodies girt with snakes, their heds spread with serpents instead of heare, the one bearing in her hande <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> snake the other a whip, and the thirde a burning firebrande: eche driuynge before them a kynge and a queene, which moued by Furies vnnaturally had slaine their owne children. The names of the kinges and queenes were these, TANTALUS, MEDEA, ATHAMAS, INO, CAMBISES, ALTHEA. After that the Furies, and these, had passed aboute the stage thrise, they departed, and then the musicke ceased. Hereby was signified the vnnaturall murders to followe, that is to saie, Porrex slaine by his owne mother. And of king Gordobuc and queene Viden killed by their owne subjectes."</Q> Here, by the way, the visionary procession of kings and queens long since dead, evidently resembles our author Sackville's original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES; and, for the same rea∣son, reminds us of a similar train of royal spectres in the tent∣scene of Shakespeare's KING RICHARD THE THIRD.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity of expressing my surprise, that this ostensible comment of the Dumb Shew should not regularly ap∣pear in the tragedies of Shakespeare. There are even proofs that he treated it with contempt and ridicule. Although some critics are of opinion, that because it is never described in form at the close or commencement of his acts, it was therefore never introduced. Shakespeare's aim was to collect an audience, and for this purpose all the common expedients were necessary. No
<PB N="362" REF="464"/>
dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>matic writer of his age has more battles or ghosts. His re∣presentations abound with the usual appendages of mechanical terror, and he adopts all the superstitions of the theatre. This problem can only be resolved into the activity or the superiority of a mind, which either would not be entangled by the forma∣lity, or which saw through the futility, of this unnatural and extrinsic ornament. It was not by declamation or by panto∣mime that Shakespeare was to fix his eternal dominion over the hearts of mankind.</P>
<P>To return to Sackville. That this tragedy was never a favo∣rite among our ancestors, and had long fallen into general obli∣vion, is to be attributed to the nakedness and uninteresting nature of the plot, the tedious length of the speeches, the want of a discrimination of character, and almost a total absence of pathetic or critical situations. It is true that a mother kills her own son. But this act of barbarous and unnatural impiety, to say nothing of its almost unexampled atrocity in the tender sex, proceeds only from a brutal principle of sudden and impetuous revenge. It is not the consequence of any deep machination, nor is it founded in a proper preparation of previous circum∣stances. She is never before introduced to our notice as a wicked or designing character. She murthers her son Porrex, because in the commotions of a civil dissension, in self-defence, after repeated provocations, and the strongest proofs of the basest in∣gratitude and treachery, he had slain his rival brother, not with∣out the deepest compunction and remorse for what he had done. A mother murthering a son is a fact which must be received with horror; but it required to be complicated with other mo∣tives, and prompted by a cooperation of other causes, to rouse our attention, and work upon our passions. I do not mean that any other motive could have been found, to palliate a murther of such a nature. Yet it was possible to heighten and to divide the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tress, by rendering this bloody mother, under the notions of human frailty, an object of our compassion as well as of our abhorrence. But perhaps these artifices were not yet known

or wanted. The general story of the play is great in its political consequences; and the leading incidents are important, but not sufficiently intricate to awaken our curiosity, and hold us in suspence. Nothing is perplexed and nothing unravelled. The opposition of interests is such as does not affect our nicer feel∣ings. In the plot of a play, our pleasure arises in proportion as our expectation is excited.</P>
<P>Yet it must be granted, that the language of GORDOBUC has great purity and perspicuity; and that it is entirely free from that tumid phraseology, which does not seem to have taken place till play-writing had become a trade, and our poets found it their int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest to captivate the multitude by the false sublime, and by those exaggerated imageries and pedantic metaphors, which are the chief blemishes of the scenes of Shakespeare, and which are at this day mistaken for his capital beauties by too many readers. Here also we perceive another and a strong reason why this play was never popular.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Sydney, in his admirable DEFENCE OF POESIE, remarks, that this tragedy is full of <HI>notable moralitie.</HI> But tra∣gedies are not to instruct us by the intermixture of moral sen∣tences, but by the force of example, and the effect of the story. In the first act, the three counsellors are introduced debating about the division of the kingdom in long and elaborate speeches, which are replete with political advice and maxims of civil prudence. But this stately sort of declamation, whatever elo∣quence it may display, and whatever policy it may teach, is undramatic, unanimated, and unaffecting. Sentiment and argu∣ment will never supply the place of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion upon the stage. Not to mention, that these grave harangues have some tincture of the formal modes of address, and the ceremonious oratory, which were then in fashion. But we must allow, that in the strain of dialogue in which they are professedly written, they have un∣common merit, even without drawing an apology in their fa∣vour from their antiquity: and that they contain much dignity, strength of reflection, and good sense, couched in clear expression

<P>The illustration from Brutus is here both apposite and poetical.</P>
<P>Spence, with a reference to the situation of the author lord Buckhurst in the court of queen Elisabeth, has observed in his preface to the modern edition of this tragedy, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis no wonder, if the language of kings and statesmen should be less happily imitated by a poet than a privy counsellor."</Q> This is an insinuation that Shakespeare, who has left many historical tragedies, was less able to conduct some parts of a royal story than the statesman lord Buckhurst. But I will venture to pro∣nounce, that whatever merit there is in this play, and particu∣larly in the speeches we have just been examining, it is more owing to the poet than the privy counsellor. If a first minister was to write a tragedy, I believe the piece will be the better, the less it has of the first minister. When a statesman turns poet, I should not wish him to fetch his ideas or his language from the canbinet. I know not why a king should be better qualified than a private man, to make kings talk in blank verse.</P>

<P>As the notions of subordination, of the royal authority, and the divine institution of kings, predominated in the reign of queen Elisabeth, it is extraordinary, that eight lines, inculcating in plain terms the doctrine of passive and unresisting obedience to the prince, which appeared in the fifth act of the first edition of this tragedy, should have been expunged in the edition of 1571, published under the immediate inspection of the authors <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Signat. D. V. edit. 1571.</NOTE>. It is well known, that the Calvinists carried their ideas of refor∣mation and refinement into government as well as religion: and it seems probable, that these eight verses were suppressed by Thomas Norton, Sackville's supposed assistant in the play, who was not only an active and I believe a sensible puritan, but a licencer of the publication of books under the commission of the bishop of London <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">For ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Seven steppes to heaven, also The seven p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>almes reduced into meter by W.

<P>As to Norton's assistance in this play, it is said on better au∣thority than that of Antony Wood, who supposes GORDOBUC to have been in old English rhime, that the three first acts were written by Thomas Norton, and the two last by Sackville. But the force of internal evidence often prevails over the authority of assertion, a testimony which is diminished by time, and may be rendered suspicious from a variety of other circumstances. Throughout the whole piece, there is an invariable uniformity of diction and versification. Sackville has two poems of considerable
<PB N="371" REF="475"/>
length in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, which fortunately furnish us with the means of comparison: and every scene of GORDOBUC is visibly marked with his characteristical manner, which consists in a perspicuity of style, and a com∣mand of numbers, superior to the tone of his times <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The same may be said of Sackville's SONNET prefixed to Thomas Hoby's Eng∣lish version of Castiglio's I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> CORTEGIANO, first printed in 1556. The third part, on <HI>the behaviour of Court-ladies,</HI> appears to have been translated in 1551, at the re∣quest of the marchioness of Northampton.</NOTE>. Thomas Norton's poetry is of a very different and a subordinate cast: and if we may judge from his share in our metrical psalmody, he seems to have been much more properly qualified to shine in the miserable mediocrity of Sternhold's stanza, and to write spi∣ritual rhymes for the solace of his illuminated brethren, than to reach the bold and impassioned elevations of tragedy.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS appearance of a regular tragedy, with the division of acts and scenes, and the accompaniment of the antient chorus, represented both at the Middle-temple and at Whitehall, and written by the most accomplished nobleman of the court of queen Elisabeth, seems to have directed the attention of our more learned poets to the study of the old classical drama, and in a short time to have produced vernacular versions of the JOCASTA of Euripides, as it is called, and of the ten Tragedies of Seneca. I do not find that it was speedily followed by any original compositions on the same legitimate model.</P>
<P>The JOCASTA of Euripides was translated by George Gas∣coigne and Francis Kinwelmersh, both students of Grays-inn, and acted in the refectory of that society, in the year 1566. Gascoigne translated the second, third, and fifth acts, and Kin∣welmersh the first, and fourth. It was printed in Gascoigne's poems, of which more will be said hereafter, in 1577, under the following title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"JOCASTA, a Tragedie written in Greeke by Euripides. Translated and digested into Acte, by George Gascoigne and Francis Kinwelmershe of Graies inn, and there by them presented, An. 1566."</Q> The Epilogue was written in quatraines by Christopher Yelverton, then one of their bro∣ther students. So strongly were our audiences still attached to spectacle, that the authors did not venture to present their play, without introducing a DUMB SHEW at the beginning of every act. For this, however, they had the example and authority of GORDOBUC. Some of the earliest specimens of Inigo Jones's Grecian architecture are marred by Gothic ornaments.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="477"/>
It must, however, be observed, that this is by no means a just or exact translation of the JOCASTA, that is the PHOENISSAE, of Euripides. It is partly a paraphrase, and partly an abridge∣ment, of the Greek tragedy. There are many omissions, re∣trenchments, and transpositions. The chorus, the characters, and the substance of the story, are entirely retained, and the tenor of the dialogue is often preserved through whole scenes. Some of the beautiful odes of the Greek chorus are neglected, and others substituted in their places, newly written by the tran∣slators. In the favorite address to Mars <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>See PHOENISS. pag. 140. edit. Barnes.</P>

<P>The constant practice of ending every act with a long ode sung by the chorus, seems to have been adopted from GORDOBUC <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It may be proper to observe here, that the tragedy of TANCRED and GISMUND, acted also before the queen at the Inner∣temple, in 1568, has the chorus.

But I will give a specimen of this performance as a transla∣tion, from that affecting scene, in which Oedipus, blind and exiled from the city, is led on by his daughter Antigone, the rival in filial fidelity of Lear's Cordelia, to touch the dead and murthered bodies of his queen Jocasta, and his sons Eteocles and Polynices. It appears to be the chief fault of the transla∣tors, that they have weakened the force of the original, which consists in a pathetic brevity, by needless dilatations, and the affectations of circumlocution. The whole dialogue in the ori∣ginal is carried on in single lines. Such, however, is the preg∣nant simplicity of the Greek language, that it would have been impossible to have rendered line for line in English.</P>

This must have been at the shop of Richard Tottel within Temple Bar.</NOTE>, afterwards reprinted in 1581 by Newton, he has taken greater liberties. At the end of the chorus after the first act, he has added about sixty verses of his own invention. In the be∣ginning of the second act, he has added a new scene, in which he introduces the spectre of Achilles raised from hell, and de∣manding the sacrifice of Polyxena. This scene, which is in the octave stanza, has much of the air of one of the legends in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES. To the chorus of this act, he has subjoined three stanzas. Instead of translating the chorus of the third act, which abounds with the hard names of the an∣tient geography, and which would both have puzzled the tran∣slator and tired the English reader, he has substituted a new ode. In his preface to the reader, from which he appears to be yet a fellow of All Souls college, he modestly apologises for these li∣centious innovations, and hopes to be pardoned for his seeming arrogance, in attempting <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to set forth in English this present piece of the flowre of all writers Seneca, among so many fine wittes, and towardly youth, with which England this day florisheth <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fol. 95. a.</NOTE>."</Q> Our translator Jasper Heywood has several poems extant in the <HI>Paradise of Daintie Deuises,</HI> published in 1573.

years of age, he was sent to Oxford, and in 1553 elected fellow of Merton college. But inheriting too large a share of his fa∣ther's facetious and free disposition, he sometimes in the early part of life indulged his festive vein in extravagancies and in∣discretions, for which being threatened with expulsion, he re∣signed his fellowship <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Harrington's Epigrams, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of old Haywood's sonnes."</Q> B. ii. 102.</NOTE>.

In the year 1558, he was recommended by cardinal Pole, as a polite scholar, an able disputant, and a steady catholic, to sir Thomas Pope founder of Trinity college in the same university, to be put in nomination for a fellowship of that college, then just founded. But this scheme did not take place <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MS. Collectan. Fr. Wise. See LIF<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> OF SIR T. POPE.</NOTE>. He was, how∣ever, appointed fellow of All Souls college the same year. Dis∣satisfied with the change of the national religion, within four years he left England, and became a catholic priest and a Jesuit at Rome, in 1562. Soon afterwards he was placed in the theo∣logical chair at Dilling in Switzerland, which he held for seven∣teen years. At length returning to England, in the capacity of a popish missionary, he was imprisoned, but released by the in∣terest of the earl of Warwick. For the deliverance from so pe∣rilous a situation, he complimented the earl in a copy of English verses, two of which, containing a most miserable paronomasy on his own name, almost bad enough to have condemned the writer to another imprisonment, are recorded in Harrington's Epigrams <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">EPIGR. lib. iii.

This is the THEBAIS, probably not written by Seneca, as it so essentially differs in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atastrophe from his OEDIPUS. Nor is it likely the same poet should have composed two tragedies on the same subject, even with a variation of incidents. It is without the chorus and a fifth act. Newton appears to have made his translation in 1581, and perhaps with a view only of completing the collection. He is more prosaic than most of his fellow-labourers, and seems to have paid the chief attention to perspicuity and fidelity. In the general EPISTLE DEDICATORY to sir Thomas Henneage, pre∣fixed to the volume, he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I durst not haue geuen the ad∣uenture to approch your presence, vpon trust of any singula∣rity, that in this Booke hath vnskilfully dropped out of myne owne penne, but that I hoped the perfection of others artifi∣ciall workmanship that haue trauayled herein, as well as my∣selfe, should somewhat couer my nakednesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and purchase my pardon.—Theirs I knowe to be deliuered with singular dexterity: myne, I confesse to be an vnflidge [unfledged] nestling, vnable to flye; an vnnatural abortion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and an vn∣perfect embryon: neyther throughlye laboured at Aristophanes and Cleanthes candle, neither yet exactly waighed in Crito∣laus his precise ballaunce.

<P>Of Thomas Newton, a slender contributor to this volume, yet perhaps the chief instrument of bringing about a general translation of Seneca, and otherwise deserving well of the litera∣ture of this period, some notices seem necessary.

In a copartment, towards the head, and under the semicircle, of the letter, are his initials, T. N. He was descended from a respectable family in Cheshire, and was sent while very young, about thirteen years of age, to Trinity college in Oxford <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">REGISTR. ibid.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards he went to Queen's college in Cambridge; but returned within a very few years to Oxford, where he was readmitted into Trinity college <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He quickly be∣came famous for the pure elegance of his Latin poetry. Of this he has left a specimen in his ILLUSTRIA ALIQUOT ANGLORUM

His chief patron was the unfortunate Robert earl of Essex. I have often incidentally mentioned some of Newton's recommendatory verses, both in English and Latin, prefixed to cotemporary books, according to the mode of that age.

<P>It is remarkable, that Shakespeare has borrowed nothing from the English Seneca. Perhaps a copy might not fall in his way. Shakespeare was only a reader by accident. Hollinshed and translated Italian novels supplied most of his plots or stories. His storehouse of learned history was North's Plutarch. The only poetical fable of antiquity, which he has worked into a play, is TROILUS. But this he borrowed from the romance of Troy. Modern fiction and English history were his principal resources. These perhaps were more suitable to his taste: at least he found that they produced the most popular subjects. Shakespeare was above the bondage of the classics.</P>

<P>BUT, as scholars began to direct their attention to our ver∣nacular poetry, many more of the antient poets now ap∣peared in English verse. Before the year 1600, Homer, Mu∣saeus, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Martial, were translated. In∣deed most of these versions were published before the year 1580. For the sake of presenting a connected display of these early translators, I am obliged to trespass, in a slight degree, on that chronological order which it has been my prescribed and con∣stant method to observe. In the mean time we must remember, that their versions, while they contributed to familiarise the ideas of the antient poets to English readers, improved our lan∣guage and versification; and that in a general view, they ought to be considered as valuable and important accessions to the stock of our poetical literature. These were the classics of Shakespeare.</P>
<P>I shall begin with those that were tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lated first in the reign of Elisabeth. But I must premise, that this inquiry will neces∣sarily draw with it many other notices much to our purpose, and which could not otherwise have been so conveniently disposed and displayed.</P>

Laurence, a fellow of All Souls and a civilian, and John Twyne, both THOMAS's brothers, have copies of verses prefixed to several cotemporary books, a∣bout the reign of queen Elisabeth. THO∣MAS wrote and translated many tracts, which it would be superfluous and tedious to enumerate here. To his BREVIARIE OF BRITAINE, a translation from the Latin of Humphrey Lhuyd, in 1573, are prefixed recommendatory verses, by Browne pre∣bendary, and Grant the learned school∣master, of Westminster, Llodowyke Lloyd a poet in the PARADISE OF DAINTIE DE∣VISES, and his two brothers, aforesaid, Lau∣rence and John.</P>

<P>The popular ear, from its familiarity, was tuned to this mea∣sure. It was now used in most works of length and gravity, but seems to have been consecrated to translation. Whatever absolute and original dignity it may boast, at present it is almost

ridiculous, from an unavoidable association of ideas, and because it necessarily recalls the tone of the versification of the puritans.

<P>I take this opportunity of observing, that I have seen an old bal∣lad called GADS-HILL by <HI>Faire,</HI> that is probably our translator Phaier.

<P>After the associated labours of Phaier and Twyne, it is hard to say what could induce Robert Stanyhurst, a native of Dublin, to translate the four first books of the Eneid into English hexa∣meters, which he printed at London, in 1583, and dedicated to his brother Peter Plunket, the learned baron of Dusanay in Ireland <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">In octavo.

<P>It will perhaps be sufficient barely to mention Spenser's CU∣LEX, which is a vague and arbitrary paraphrase, of a poem not properly belonging to Virgil. From the testimony of many early Latin writers it may be justly concluded, that Virgil wrote an elegant poem with this title. Nor is it improbable that in the CU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EX at present attributed to Virgil, some very few of the ori∣ginal phrases, and even verses, may remain, under the accumu∣lated incrustation of critics, imitators, interpolators, and para∣phrasts, which corrupts what it conceals. But the texture, the character, and substance, of the genuine poem is almost entirely lost. The CEIRIS, or the fable of Nisus and Scylla, which fol∣lows, although never mentioned by any writer of antiquity, has much fairer pretensions to genuineness. At least the CEIRIS, al∣lowing for uncommon depravations of time and transcription, ap∣pears in its present state to be a poem of the Augustan age, and is perhaps the identical piece dedicated to the Messala whose patronage it solicits. It has that rotundity of versification, which seems to have been studied after the Roman poetry emerged from barbarism.
<PB N="407" REF="511"/>
It has a general simplicity, and often a native strength, of colouring; nor is it tinctured, except by the casual innova∣tion of grammarians, with those sophistications both of senti∣ment and expression, which afterwards of course took place among the Roman poets, and which would have betrayed a re∣cent forgery. It seems to be the work of a young poet: but its digressions and descriptions which are often too prolix, are not only the marks of a young poet, but of early poetry. It is interspersed with many lines, now in the Eclogues, Georgics, and Eneid. Here is an argument which seems to assign it to Virgil. A cotemporary poet would not have ventured to steal from poems so well known. It was natural, at least allowable, for Virgil to steal from a performance of his youth, on which he did not set any great value, and which he did not scruple to rob of a few ornaments, deserving a better place. This consideration excludes Cornelius Gallus, to whom Fontanini, with much acute criti∣cism, has ascribed the CEIRIS. Nor, for the reason given, would Virgil have stolen from Gallus. The writer has at least the art of Virgil, in either suppressing, or throwing into shade, the trite and uninteresting incidents of the common fabulous history of Scylla, which were incapable of decoration, or had been preoccupied by other poets. The dialogue between the young princess Scylla, who is deeply in love, and her nurse, has much of the pathos of Virgil. There are some traces which discover an imitation of Lucretius: but on the whole, the struc∣ture of the verses, and the predominant cast and manner of the composition, exactly resemble the ARGONAUTICA of Catullus, or the EPITHALAMIUM of PELEUS AND THETIS. I will instance in the following passage, in which every thing is distinctly and circumstantially touched, and in an affected pomp of numbers. He is alluding to the stole of Minerva, interwoven with the battle of the giants, and exhibited at Athens in the magnificent Panathenaic festival. The classical reader will perceive one or two interpolations: and lament, that this rich piece of embroidery
<PB N="408" REF="512"/>
has suffered a little from being unskilfully darned by another and a more modern artificer.</P>

<P>The same stately march of hexameters is observable in Tibul∣lus's tedious panegyric on Messala: a poem, which, if it should not be believed to be of Tibullus's hand, may at least, from this reasoning be adjudged to his age. We are sure that Ca∣tullus could not have been the author of the CEIRIS, as Mes∣sala, to whom it is inscribed, was born but a very few years be∣fore the death of Catullus. One of the chief circumstances of the story is a purple lock of hair, which grew on the head of Nisus king of Megara, and on the preservation of which the safety of that city, now besieged by Minos, king of Crete, en∣tirely depended. Scylla, Nisus's daughter, falls in love with Minos, whom she sees from the walls of Megara: she finds means to cut off this sacred ringlet, the city is taken, and she is married to Minos. I am of opinion that Tibullus, in the fol∣lowing passage, alludes to the CEIRIS, then newly published,
<PB N="409" REF="513"/>
and which he points out by this leading and fundamental fiction of Nisus's purple lock.</P>

<P>Tibullus here, in recommending the study of the poets to the Roman youth, illustrates the power of poetry; and, for this purpose, with much address he selects a familiar instance from a piece recently written, perhaps by one of his friends.</P>
<P>Spenser seems to have shewn a particular regard to these two little poems, supposed to be the work of Virgil's younger years.

It was printed without a title page at the end of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"TEARES OF THE MUSES, by Ed. Sp.

<P>Coxeter says, that he had seen one of Ovid's Epistles transla∣ted by Robert earl of Essex. This I have never seen; and, if it could be recovered, I trust it would only be valued as a curio∣sity. A few of his sonnets are in the Ashmolean Museum, which have no marks of poetic genius. He is a vigorous and elegant writer of prose. But if Essex was no poet, few noblemen of his age were more courted by poets. From Spenser to the lowest rhymer he was the subject of numerous sonnets, or popular bal∣lads. I will not except Sydney. I could produce evidence to prove, that he scarce ever went out of England, or even left London, on the most frivolous enterprise, without a pastoral in his praise, or a panegyric in metre, which were sold and sung in
<PB N="422" REF="526"/>
the streets. Having interested himself in the fashionable poetry of the times, he was placed high in the ideal Arcadia now just established: and among other instances which might be brought, on his return from Portugal in 1589, he was complimented with a poem, called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An Egloge gratulatorie entituled to the right honorable and renowned shepherd of Albions Arcadie Robert earl of Essex and for his returne lately into England <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Licenced to R.

I know not if the queen's fatal partiality, or his own inherent attractions, his love of literature, his heroism, integrity, and generosity, qualities which abundantly overbalance his presumption, his vanity, and impetuosity, had the greater share in dictating these praises. If adulation were any where justifiable, it must be when paid to the man who endeavoured to save Spenser from starving in the streets of Dublin, and who buried him in West∣minster-abbey with becoming solemnity. Spenser was persecuted by Burleigh, because he was patronised by Essex.</P>

For in this favorite piece of superficial declamation, the specious orator, when he is led to a formal defence of the value and dignity of poetry, instead of illustrating his subject by insisting on the higher utilities of poetry, its political nature, and its importance to society, enlarges only on the immortality which the art confers, on the poetic faculty being communi∣cated by divine inspiration, on the public honours paid to Homer and Ennius, on the esteem with which poets were regarded by Alexander and Themistocles, on the wonderful phenomenon of an extemporaneous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffusion of a great number of verses, and even recurs to the trite and obvious topics of a school-boy in saying, that poems are a pleasant relief after fatigue of the mind, and that hard rocks and savage beasts have been moved by the power of song. A modern philosopher would have considered such a subject with more penetration, comprehension, and force of reflection. His excuse must be, that he was uttering a popular harangue.</P>

As Marlowe, being now considered as a translator, and other∣wise being generally ranked only as a dramatic poet, will not occur again, I take this opportunity of remarking here, that the delicate sonnet called the PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE, falsely attributed to Shakespeare, and which occurs in the third act of THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, followed by the nymph's Reply, was written by Marlowe <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Steevens's SHAKESP. vol. i. p. 297. edit. 1778.</NOTE>. Isaac Walton in his COMPLEAT ANGLER, a book perhaps composed about the year 1640, although not published till 1653, has inserted this sonnet, with the reply, under the character of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that smooth song which was made by Kit Marlowe, now at least fifty years ago: and—an Answer to it which was made by sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days: old fashioned poetry, but choicely good."</Q> In ENGLAND'S HELICON, a miscel∣lany of the year 1600, it is printed with Christopher Marlowe's name, and followed by the Reply, subscribed IGNOTO, Ra∣leigh's constant signature <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Signat.

I do not say that this is Chapman's fault: but he has by no means represented the dignity or the simplicity Homer. He is sometimes paraphrastic and redundant, but more frequently retrenches or impoverishes what he could not feel and express. In the mean time, he labours with the inconve∣nience of an aukward, inharmonious, and unheroic measure, imposed by custom, but disgustful to modern ears. Yet he is not always without strength or spirit. He has enriched our language with many compound epithets, so much in the manner

<P>My copy once belonged to Pope; in which he has noted many of Chapman's absolute interpolations, extending some∣times to the length of a paragraph of twelve lines. A diligent observer will easily discern, that Pope was no careless reader of his rude predecessor. Pope complains that Chapman took advan∣tage of an unmeasureable length of line. But in reality Pope's lines are longer than Chapman's. If Chapman affected the re∣putation of rendering line for line, the specious expedient of chusing a protracted measure which concatenated two lines toge∣ther, undoubtedly favoured his usual propensity to periphrasis.</P>
<P>Chapman's commentary is only incidental, contains but a small degree of critical excursion, and is for the most part a pe∣dantic compilation from Spondanus. He has the boldness severely to censure Scaliger's impertinence. It is remarkable that he has taken no illustrations from Eustathius, except through the cita∣tions of other commentators. But of Eustathius there was no Latin interpretation.</P>

<P>As an original writer, Chapman belongs to the class of dra∣matic poets, and will not therefore be considered again at the period in which he is placed by the biographers <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>But this is said not without some de∣gree of restriction.

therefore, which were begun before the year 1600, re∣quire that we should here acquaint the reader with some particu∣lars of his life. He wrote eighteen plays, which although now forgotten, must have contributed in no inconsiderable degree to enrich and advance the English stage. He was born in 1557, perhaps in Kent. He passed about two years at Trinity college in Oxford, with a contempt of philosophy, but in a close atten∣tion to the Greek and Roman classics <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">From the information of Mr. Wise, late Radcliffe's librarian, and keeper of the Archives, at Oxford.</NOTE>. Leaving the university about 1576, he seems to have been led to London in the cha∣racter of a poet; where he soon commenced a friendship with Spenser, Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Daniel, and attracted the notice of secretary Walsingham. He probably acquired some appointment in the court of king James the first; where un∣timely death, and unexpected disgrace, quickly deprived him of his liberal patrons Prince Henry and Carr. Jonson was com∣monly too proud, either to assist, or to be assisted; yet he en∣gaged with Chapman and Marston in writing the Comedy of EASTWARD HOE, which was performed by the children of the revels in 1605 <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The first of Chapman's plays, I mean with his name, which appears in the Stati∣oners Registers, is the Tragedy of CHARLES DUKE OF BYRON. Entered to T. Thorp, Jun. 5, 1608. REGISTR. C. fol. 168. b.</NOTE>. But this association gave Jonson an opportunity of throwing out many satirical parodies on Shakespeare with more security. All the three authors, however, were in danger of being pilloried for some reflections on the Scotch nation, which were too seriously understood by James the first. When the societies of Lincoln's-inn and the Middle-temple, in 1613, had resolved to exhibit a splendid masque at Whitehall in honour of the nuptials of the Palsgrave and the princess Elisabeth,
<PB N="448" REF="552"/>
Chapman was employed for the poetry, and Inigo Jones for the machinery. It is not clear, whether Dryden's resolution to burn annually one copy of Chapman's best tragedy BUSSY D'AM∣BOISE, to the memory of Jonson, was a censure or a compli∣ment <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Preface to SPANISH FRYER.</NOTE>. He says, however, that this play pleased only in the representation, like a star which glitters only while it shoots. The manes of Jonson perhaps required some reconciliatory rites: for Jonson being delivered from Shakespeare, began unexpectedly to be disturbed at the rising reputation of a new theatric rival. Wood says, that Chapman was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a person of most reverend aspect, re∣ligious and temperate, QUALITIES RARELY MEETING IN A POET <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 592.</NOTE>!"</Q> The truth is, he does not seem to have mingled in the dissipations and indiscretions, which then marked his profession. He died at the age of seventy-seven, in 1634, and was buried on the south side of saint Giles's church in the Fields. His friend Inigo Jones planned and erected a monument to his memory, in the style of the new architecture, which was unluckily destroyed with the old church <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Wood has preserved part of the epi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aph, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Georgius Chapmannus, poeta Ho∣mericus, philosophus verus (etsi chris∣tianus poeta) plusquam celebris, &amp;c."</Q> Ubi supr.</NOTE>.

<P>From the title of this work, ZODIACUS VITAE, written in Latin hexameters by Marcello Palingeni, an Italian, about the year 1531, the reader at least expects some astronomical allusions.

signs: just as Herodotus, but with less affectation and incon∣sistency, marked the nine books or divisions of his history with the names of the nine Muses. Yet so strange and pedantic a title is not totally without a conceit, as the author was born at Stellada, or Stellata, a province of Ferrara, and from whence he calls himself Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">It should have been STELLATENSIS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This poem is a general satire on life, yet without peevishness or malevolence; and with more of the solemnity of the censor, than the petulance of the satirist. Much of the morality is couched under allegorical personages and adventures. The Latinity is tolerably pure, but there is a mediocrity in the versi∣fication. Palingenius's transitions often discover more quickness of imagination, and fertility of reflection, than solidity of judg∣ment. Having started a topic, he pursues it through all its possible affinities, and deviates into the most distant and unneces∣sary digressions. Yet there is a facility in his manner, which is not always unpleasing: nor is the general conduct of the work void of art and method. He moralises with a boldness and a liberality of sentiment, which were then unusual; and his maxims and strictures are sometimes tinctured with a spirit of libertinism, which, without exposing the opinions, must have offended the gravity, of the more orthodox ecclesiastics. He fancies that a confident philosopher, who rashly presumes to scrutinise the remote mysteries of nature, is shewn in heaven like an ape, for the public diversion of the gods. A thought evidently borrowed by Pope <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See ESSAY ON POPE, p. 94.</NOTE>. Although he submits his per∣formance to the sentence of the church, he treats the authority of the popes, and the voluptuous lives of the monks, with the severest acrimony. It was the last circumstance that chiefly con∣tributed to give this poem almost the rank of a classic in the re∣formed countries, and probably produced an early English tran∣slation. After his death, he was pronounced an heretic; and his body was taken up, and committed to the flames. A measure

which only contributed to spread his book, and disseminate his doctrines.</P>

<P>There is some poetic imagination in SAGITTARIUS, or the ninth book, where a divine mystagogue opens to the poet's eyes an unknown region of infernal kings and inhabitants.

<P>One cannot but remark, that the conduct and machinery of the old visionary poems is commonly the same. A rural scene, generally a wilderness, is supposed. An imaginary being of con∣summate wisdom, a hermit, a goddess, or an angel, appears; and having purged the poet's eye with a few drops of some celestial elixir, conducts him to the top of an inaccessible moun∣tain, which commands an unbounded plain filled with all na∣tions. A cavern opens, and displays the torments of the damned: he next is introduced into heaven, by way of the moon, the

only planet which was thought big enough for a poetical visit. Although suddenly deserted by his mystic intelligencer, he finds himself weary and desolate, on the sea-shore, in an impassable forest, or a flowery meadow.</P>

<P>But it was not only to these later and degenerate classics, and to modern tracts, that Googe's industry was confined. He also translated into English what he called Aristotle's TABLE OF THE TEN CATEGORIES <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">MSS. Coxeter.</NOTE>, that capital example of ingenious but

useless subtlety, of method which cannot be applied to practice, and of that affectation of unnecessary deduction and frivolous in∣vestigation, which characterises the philosophy of the Greeks, and which is conspicuous not only in the demonstrations of Euclid, but in the Socratic disputations recorded by Xenophon. The solid simplicity of common sense would have been much less subject to circumlocution, embarrassment, and ambiguity. We do not want to be told by a chain of proofs, that two and two make four. This specific character of the schools of the Greeks, is perhaps to be traced backwards to the loquacity, the love of paradox, and the fondness for argumentative discourse, so peculiar to their nation. Even the good sense of Epictetus was not proof against this captious phrenzy. What patience can endure the solemn quibbles, which mark the stoical confe∣rences of that philosopher perserved by Arrian? It is to this spirit, not solely from a principle of invidious malignity, that Tully alludes, where he calls the Greeks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Homines conten∣tionis quam veritatis cupidiores <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">De ORATORE, Lib. i. §. xi.</NOTE>."</Q> And in another part of the same work he says, that it is a principal and even a national fault of this people, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Quocunque in loco, quoscunque inter homines visum est, de rebus aut DIFFICILLIMIS aut non NE∣CESSARIIS, ARGUTISSIME DISPUTARE <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

Beside these versions of the Greek and Roman poets, and of the antient writers in prose, incidentally mentioned in this re∣view, it will be sufficient to observe here in general, that almost all the Greek and Roman classics appeared in English before the year 1600. The effect and influence of these translations on our poetry, will be considered in a future section.</P>

<P>BUT the ardour of translation was not now circumscribed within the bounds of the classics, whether poets, histo∣rians, orators, or critics, of Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>I have before observed, that with our frequent tours through Italy, and our affectation of Italian manners, about the middle of the sixteenth century, the Italian poets became fashionable, and that this circumstance, for a time at least, gave a new turn to our poetry. The Italian poets, however, were but in few hands; and a practice of a more popular and general nature, yet still resulting from our communications with Italy, now began to prevail, which produced still greater revolutions. This was the translation of Italian books, chiefly on fictitious and nar∣rative subjects, into English.</P>
<P>The learned Ascham thought this novelty in our literature too important to be passed over without observation, in his reflec∣tions on the course of an ingenuous education. It will be much to our purpose to transcribe what he has said on this subject: although I think his arguments are more like the reasonings of a rigid puritan, than of a man of liberal views and true penetration; and that he endeavours to account for the origin, and to state the consequences, of these translations, more in the spirit of an early calvinistic preacher, than as a sensible critic or a polite scholar. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"These be the inchauntments of Circe, brought out of Italie to marre mens manners in England: much, by example of ill life, but more by precepts of fonde bookes, of late tran∣slated oute of Italian into English, solde in euery shop in London, commended by honest titles, the sooner to corrupt

In our forefathers time, when papistrie, as a standing poole, couered and ouerflowed all England, few bookes were red in our toong, sauyng cer∣tayne Bookes of Chiualrie, as they sayd for pastime and plea∣sure, which, as some say, were made in monasteries by idle monkes or wanton chanons: as one for example, MORTE ARTHUR, the whole pleasure of which booke standeth in two specyall poyntes, in open mans slaghter and bolde baw∣drie: in which booke those be counted the noble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t knights that doe kill most men without any quarrell, and commit fowlest aduoulteries by sutlest shifts: as, syr Launcelote with the wife of king Arthure his maister: syr Tristram with the wife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of king Marke his vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le: syr Lamerocke with the wife of king Lote that was his own aunte.

What toyes the dayly reading of such a booke may worke in the will of a yong ientleman, or a yong maide, that liueth welthely and idlely, wife men can iudge, and honest men doe pittie. And yet ten MORTE ARTHURES doe not the tenth part so much harme, as one of these bookes made in Italie, and translated in England. They open, not fond and common ways to vice, but such suttle, cunning, new and diuerse shifts, to carry yong willes to vanitie and yong wittes to mis∣chiefe, to teache old bawdes new schoole pointes, as the sim∣ple head of an Englishman is not hable to inuent, nor neuer was heard of in England before, yea when papistrie ouer∣flowed all.

<P>Ascham talkes here exactly in the style of Prynne's HISTRIO∣MASTIX. It must indeed be confessed, that by these books many pernicious obscenities were circulated, and perhaps the doctrine of intrigue more accurately taught and exemplified than before. But every advantage is attended with its inconveniencies and abuses. That to procure translations of Italian tales was a plot of the papists, either for the purpose of facilitating the pro∣pagation of their opinions, of polluting the minds of our youth, or of diffusing a spirit of scepticism, I am by no means con∣vinced. But I have nothing to do with the moral effects of these versions. I mean only to shew their influence on our literature, more particularly on our poetry, although I reserve the discussion of this point for a future section. At present, my design is to give the reader a full and uniform view of the chief of these translations from the Italian, which appeared in England before the year 1600.</P>
<P>I will begin with Boccace. The reader recollects Boccace's THESEID and TROILUS, many of his Tales, and large passages from Petrarch and Dante, translated by Chaucer. But the golden mine of Italian fiction opened by Chaucer, was soon closed and forgotten. I must however premise, that the Italian language now began to grow so fashionable, that it was explained in lexi∣cons and grammars, written in English, and with a view to the illustration of the three principal Italian poets. So early as 1550, were published, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Principal rules of the Italian grammar, with a dictionarie for the better vnderstanding of Boccase, Petrarche, and Dante, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thered into this tonge by William Thomas <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In quarto, for T.

<P>Before the year 1570, William Paynter, clerk of the Office of Arms within the Tower of London, and who seems to have been master of the school of Sevenoaks in Kent, printed a very considerable part of Boccace's novels.

<P>It is not suspected, that those affecting stories, the CYMON AND IPHIGENIA, and the THEODORE AND HONORIA, of Boccace, so beautifully paraphrased by Dryden, appeared in Eng∣lish verse, early in the reign of queen Elisabeth.</P>
<P>THEODORE AND HONORIA was translated, in 1569, by doc∣tor Christopher Tye, the musician, already mentioned as a volu∣minous versifier of scripture in the reign of Edward the sixth.

<P>It is not at all improbable, that these old translations now en∣tirely forgotten and obsolete, suggested these stories to Dryden's notice. To Dryden they were not more antient, than pieces are to us, written soon after the restoration of Charles the se∣cond: and they were then of sufficient antiquity not to be too commonly known, and of such mediocrity, as not to preclude a new translation. I think we may trace Dryden in some of the rhymes and expressions <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In 1569, Thomas Colwell has licence to print <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A ballet of two faythfull frynds beynge bothe in love with one lady."</Q> REGISTR.

<P>It must not be forgot, that Sachetti published tales before Boc∣cace. But the publication of Boccace's DECAMERON gave a stabi∣lity to this mode of composition, which had existed in a rude state before the revival of letters in Italy. Boccace collected the com∣mon tales of his country, and procured others of Grecian origin from his friends and preceptors the Constantinopolitan exiles, which he decorated with new circumstances, and delivered in the purest style. Some few perhaps are of his own invention. He was soon imitated, yet often unsuccessfully, by many of his countrymen, Poggio, Bandello, the anonymous author of LE CIENTO NOVELLE ANTIKE, Cinthio, Firenzuola, Malespini, and others. Even Machiavel, who united the liveliest wit with the profoundest reflection, and who composed two comedies while he was compiling a political history of his country, con∣descended to adorn this fashionable species of writing with his NOVELLA DI BELFEGOR, or the tale of Belphegor.</P>

B. fol. 193. a. See last Note.</NOTE>. But I believe there were two diffe∣rent translations in verse. It must be remembered here, that the original writer of this story was Luigi da Porto, a gentleman of Verona, who died in 1529. His narrative appeared at Venic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in 1535, under the title of LA GIULIETTA, and was soon after∣wards adopted by Bandello. Shakespeare, misled by the English
<PB N="472" REF="576"/>
poem, missed the opportunity of introducing a most affecting scene by the natural and obvious conclusion of the story. In Luigi's novel, Juliet awakes from her trance in the tomb before the death of Romeo. From Turberville's poems printed in 1567, we learn, that Arthur Brooke was drowned in his passage to New-haven, and that he was the author of this translation, which was the distinguished proof of his excellent poetical abilities.</P>

<P>Bishop Tanner, I think, in his correspondence with the learned and accurate Thomas Baker of Cambridge, mentions a prose English version of the NOVELLE of Bandello, who endeavoured to avoid the obscenities of Boccace and the improbabilities of Cinthio, in 1580, by W. W. Had I seen this performance, for which I have searched Tanner's library in vain, I would have informed the inquisitive reader, how far it accommodated Shakespeare in the conduct of the Tragedy of ROMEO AND JULIET.

I was informed by the late Mr. Collins of Chichester, that Shakespeare's TEMPEST, for which no origin is yet assigned, was formed on this favorite ro∣mance. But although this information has not proved true on examination, an useful conclusion may be drawn from it, that Shakespeare's story is somewhere to be found in an Italian novel, at least that the story preceded Shakespeare. Mr. Collins had searched this subject with no less fidelity, than judgment and industry: but his memory failing in his last calamitous indisposition, he probably gave me the name of one novel for another. I remem∣ber he added a circumstance, which may lead to a discovery, that the principal character of the romance, answering to Shake∣speare's Prospero, was a chemical necromancer, who had bound a spirit like Ariel to obey his call and perform his services. It was a common pretence of the dealers in the occult sciences to have a demon at command. At least Aurelio, or Orelio, was probably one of the names of this romance, the production and multipli∣cation of gold being the grand object of alchemy. Taken at large, the magical part of the TEMPEST is founded in that sort of philosophy which was practised by John Dee and his associates, and has been called the Rosicrusian. The name Ariel came from the Talmudistic mysteries with which the learned Jews had infected this science.</P>
<P>To this head must also be referred, the Collections which ap∣peared before 1600, of tales drawn indiscriminately from French and Spanish, as well as Italian authors, all perhaps originally of Italian growth, and recommended by the general love of fable and fiction which now prevailed.

<P>This enquiry might be much farther enlarged and extended.

<HEAD>SECT. XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>ENOUGH has been opened of the reign of queen Elisa∣beth, to afford us an opportunity of forming some general reflections, tending to establish a full estimate of the genius of the poetry of that reign; and which, by drawing conclusions from what has been said, and directing the reader to what he is to expect, will at once be recapitulatory and preparatory. Such a survey perhaps might have stood with more propriety as an in∣troduction to this reign. But it was first necessary to clear the way, by many circumstantial details, and the regular narration of those particulars, which lay the foundation of principles, and suggest matter for discursive observation. My sentiments on this subject shall therefore compose the concluding section of the present volume.</P>
<P>The age of queen Elisabeth is commonly called the golden age of English poetry. It certainly may not improperly be styled the most POETICAL age of these annals.</P>
<P>Among the great features which strike us in the poetry of this period, are the predominancy of fable, of fiction, and fancy, and a predilection for interesting adventures and pathetic events. I will endeavour to assign and explain the cause of this charac∣teristic distinction, which may chiefly be referred to the follow∣ing principles, sometimes blended, and sometimes operating singly: The revival and vernacular versions of the classics, the importation and translation of Italian novels, the visionary reve∣ries or refinements of false philosophy, a degree of super∣stition sufficient for the purpose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of poetry, the adoption of
<PB N="491" REF="595"/>
the machineries of romance, and the frequency and improve∣ments of allegoric exhibition in the popular spectacles.</P>
<P>When the corruptions and impostures of popery were abo∣lished, the fashion of cultivating the Greek and Roman learning became universal: and the literary character was no longer ap∣propriated to scholars by profession, but assumed by the nobility and gentry. The ecclesiastics had found it their interest to keep the languages of antiquity to themselves, and men were eager to know what had been so long injuriously concealed. Truth propagates truth, and the mantle of mystery was removed not only from religion but from literature. The laity, who had now been taught to assert their natural privileges, became impa∣tient of the old monopoly of knowledge, and demanded admit∣tance to the usurpations of the clergy. The general curiosity for new discoveries, heightened either by just or imaginary ideas of the treasures contained in the Greek and Roman writers, ex∣cited all persons of leisure and fortune to study the classics. The pedantry of the present age was the politeness of the last. An accurate comprehension of the phraseology and peculiarities of the antient poets, historians, and orators, which yet seldom went farther than a kind of technical erudition, was an indispensable and almost the principal object in the circle of a gentleman's education. Every young lady of fashion was carefully instituted in classical letters: and the daughter of a duchess was taught, not only to distil strong waters, but to construe Greek. Among the learned females of high distinction, queen Elisabeth herself was the most conspicuous. Roger Ascham, her preceptor, speaks with rapture of her astonishing progress in the Greek nouns; and declares with no small degree of triumph, that during a long residence at Windsor-castle, she was accustomed to read more Greek in a day, than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"some prebendary of that church did Latin, in one week <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">SCHOOLEMASTER. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 19. b. edit. 1589. 4to.</NOTE>."</Q> And although perhaps a princess looking out words in a lexicon, and writing down hard phrases
<PB N="492" REF="596"/>
from Plutarch's Lives, may be thought at present a more incom∣patible and extraordinary character, than a canon of Windsor understanding no Greek and but little Latin, yet Elisabeth's pas∣sion for these acquisitions was then natural, and resulted from the genius and habitudes of her age.</P>
<P>The books of antiquity being thus familiarised to the great, every thing was tinctured with antient history and mythology. The heathen gods, although discountenanced by the Calvinists on a suspicion of their tending to cherish and revive a spirit of idolatry, came into general vogue. When the queen paraded through a country-town, almost every pageant was a pantheon. When she paid a visit at the house of any of her nobility, at en∣tering the hall she was saluted by the Penates, and conducted to her privy-chamber by Mercury. Even the pastry-cooks were ex∣pert mythologists. At dinner, select transformations of Ovid's metamorphoses were exhibited in confectionary: and the splen∣did iceing of an immense historic plumb-cake, was embossed with a delicious basso-relievo of the destruction of Troy. In the afternoon, when she condescended to walk in the garden, the lake was covered with Tritons and Nereids: the pages of the family were converted into Wood-nymphs who peeped from every bower: and the footmen gamboled over the lawns in the figure of Satyrs. I speak it without designing to insinuate any unfavourable suspicions, but it seems difficult to say, why Elisa∣beth's virginity should have been made the theme of perpetual and excessive panegyric: nor does it immediately appear, that there is less merit or glory in a married than a maiden queen. Yet, the next morning, after sleeping in a room hung with the tapes∣try of the voyage of Eneas, when her majesty hunted in the Park, she was met by Diana, who pronouncing our royal prude to be the brightest paragon of unspotted chastity, invited her to groves free from the intrusions of Acteon. The truth is, she was so profusely flattered for this virtue, because it was esteemed the characteristical ornament of the heroines, as fantastic honour was the chief pride of the champions, of the old barbarous romance.

It was in conformity to the sentiments of chivalry, which still continued in vogue, that she was celebrated for chastity: the compliment, however, was paid in a classical allusion.</P>
<P>Queens must be ridiculous when they would appear as women. The softer attractions of sex vanish on the throne. Elisabeth sought all occasions of being extolled for her beauty, of which indeed in the prime of her youth she possessed but a small share, whatever might have been her pretensions to absolute virginity. Notwithstanding her exaggerated habits of dignity and cere∣mony, and a certain affectation of imperial severity, she did not perceive this ambition of being complimented for beauty, to be an idle and unpardonable levity, totally inconsistent with her high station and character. As she conquered all nations with her arms, it matters not what were the triumphs of her eyes. Of what consequence was the complexion of the mistress of the world? Not less vain of her person than her politics, this stately coquet, the guardian of the protestant faith, the terror of the sea, the mediatrix of the factions of France, and the scourge of Spain, was infinitely mortified, if an embassador, at the first audience, did not tell her she was the finest woman in Europe. No negociation succeeded unless she was addressed as a goddess. Encomiastic harangues drawn from this topic, even on the supposition of youth and beauty, were surely super∣fluous, unsuitable, and unworthy; and were offered and received with an equal impropriety. Yet when she rode through the streets of the city of Norwich, Cupid, at the command of the mayor and aldermen, advancing from a groupe of gods who had left Olympus to grace the procession, gave her a golden arrow, the most effective weapon of his well-furnished quiver, which under the influence of such irresistible charms was sure to wound the most obdurate heart. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A gift, says honest Hollinshed, which her majesty, now verging to her fiftieth year, received very thankfullie <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CHRON. iii. f. 1297.</NOTE>."</Q> In one of the fulsome interludes at
<PB N="494" REF="598"/>
court, where she was present, the singing-boys of her chapel presented the story of the three rival goddesses on mount Ida, to which her majesty was ingeniously added as a fourth: and Paris was arraigned in form for adjudging the golden apple to Venus, which was due to the queen alone.</P>
<P>This inundation of classical pedantry soon infected our poetry. Our writers, already trained in the school of fancy, were sud∣denly dazzled with these novel imaginations, and the divinities and heroes of pagan antiquity decorated every composition. The perpetual allusions to antient fable were often introduced without the least regard to propriety. Shakespeare's Mrs. Page, who is not intended in any degree to be a learned or an affected lady, laughing at the cumbersome courtship of her corpulent lover Falstaffe, says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had rather be a giantess and lie under mount Pelion <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">MERRY W. Act. ii. Sc. i.</NOTE>."</Q> This familiarity with the pagan story was not, however, so much owing to the prevailing study of the original authors, as to the numerous English versions of them, which were consequently made. The translations of the classics, which now employed every pen, gave a currency and a celebrity to these fancies, and had the effect of diffusing them among the people. No sooner were they delivered from the pale of the scholastic languages, than they acquired a general notoriety. Ovid's metamorphoses just translated by Golding, to instance no farther, disclosed a new world of fiction, even to the illiterate. As we had now all the antient fables in English, learned allu∣sions, whether in a poem or a pageant, were no longer obscure and unintelligible to common readers and common spectators. And here we are led to observe, that at this restoration of the classics, we were first struck only with their fabulous inventions. We did not attend to their regularity of design and justness of sentiment. A rude age, beginning to read these writers, imitated their extravagancies, not their natural beauties. And these, like other novelties, were pursued to a blameable excess.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="599"/>
I have before given a sketch of the introduction of classical stories, in the splendid show exhibited at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn. But that is a rare and a premature in∣stance: and the pagan fictions are there complicated with the barbarisms of the catholic worship, and the doctrines of scho∣lastic theology. Classical learning was not then so widely spread, either by study or translation, as to bring these learned specta∣cles into fashion, to frame them with sufficient skill, and to present them with propriety.</P>
<P>Another capital source of the poetry peculiar to this period, consisted in the numerous translations of Italian tales into Eng∣lish. These narratives, not dealing altogether in romantic in∣ventions, but in real life and manners, and in artful arrange∣ments of fictitious yet probable events, afforded a new gratifica∣tion to a people which yet retained their antient relish for tale∣telling, and became the fashionable amusement of all who pro∣fessed to read for pleasure. They gave rise to innumerable plays and poems, which would not otherwise have existed; and turned the thoughts of our writers to new inventions of the same kind. Before these books became common, affecting situations, the combination of incident, and the pathos of catastrophe, were almost unknown. Distress, especially that arising from the con∣flicts of the tender passion, had not yet been shewn in its most interesting forms. It was hence our poets, particularly the dra∣matic, borrowed ideas of a legitimate plot, and the complica∣tion of facts necessary to constitute a story either of the comic or tragic species. In proportion as knowledge encreased, genius had wanted subjects and materials. These pieces usurped the place of legends and chronicles. And although the old historical songs of the minstrels contained much bold adventure, heroic enterprise, and strong touches of rude delineation, yet they failed in that multiplication and disposition of circumstances, and in that description of characters and events approaching nearer to truth and reality, which were demanded by a more
<PB N="496" REF="600"/>
discerning and curious age. Even the rugged features of the original Gothic romance were softened by this sort of reading: and the Italian pastoral, yet with some mixture of the kind of incidents described in Heliodorus's Ethiopic history now newly translated, was engrafted on the feudal manners in Sydney's ARCADIA.</P>
<P>But the reformation had not yet destroyed every delusion, nor disinchanted all the strong holds of superstition. A few dim characters were yet legible in the mouldering creed of tradition. Every goblin of ignorance did not vanish at the first glimmer∣ings of the morning of science. Reason suffered a few demons still to linger, which she chose to retain in her service under the guidance of poetry. Men believed, or were willing to believe, that spirits were yet hovering around, who brought with them <HI>airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,</HI> that the ghost was duely released from his prison of torment at the sound of the curfue, and that fairies imprinted mysterious circles on the turf by moonlight. Much of this credulity was even consecrated by the name of science and profound speculation. Prospero had not yet <HI>broken and buried his staff,</HI> nor <HI>drowned his book deeper than did ever plummet sound.</HI> It was now that the alchymist, and the ju∣dicial astrologer, conducted his occult operations by the potent intercourse of some preternatural being, who came obsequious to his call, and was bound to accomplish his severest services, under certain conditions, and for a limited duration of time. It was actually one of the pretended feats of these fantastic philo∣sophers, to evoke the queen of the Fairies in the solitude of a gloomy grove, who, preceded by a sudden rustling of the leaves, appeared in robes of transcendent lustre <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lilly's LIFE, p. 151.</NOTE>. The Shakespeare of a more instructed and polished age, would not have given us a magician darkening the sun at noon, the sabbath of the witches, and the cauldron of incantation.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="601"/>
Undoubtedly most of these notions were credited and enter∣tained in a much higher degree, in the preceding periods. But the arts of composition had not then made a sufficient progress, nor would the poets of those periods have managed them with so much address and judgement. We were now arrived at that point, when the national credulity, chastened by reason, had produced a sort of civilized superstition, and left a set of tradi∣tions, fanciful enough for poetic decoration, and yet not too violent and chimerical for common sense. Hobbes, although no friend to this doctrine, observes happily, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a good poem both judgement and fancy are required; but the fancy must be more eminent, because they please for the EXTRAVA∣GANCY, but ought not to displease by INDISCRETION <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">LEVIATH. Part i. ch. viii.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time the Gothic romance, although somewhat shook by the classical fictions, and by the tales of Boccace and Bandello, still maintained its ground: and the daring machine∣ries of giants, dragons, and inchanted castles, borrowed from the magic storehouse of Boiardo, Ariosto, and Tasso, began to be em∣ployed by the epic muse. These ornaments have been censured by the bigotry of precise and servile critics, as abounding in whimsical absurdities, and as unwarrantable deviations from the practice of Homer and Virgil. The author of AN ENQUIRY INTO THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF HOMER is willing to allow a fertility of genius, and a felicity of expression, to Tasso and Ariosto; but at the same time complains, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"quitting life, they betook themselves to aerial beings and Utopian characters, and filled their works with Charms and Visions, the modern Supplements of the Marvellous and Sublime.

are turned into ships in the Orlando, nymphs are transformed into ships in the Eneid. Cacus is a more unnatural savage than Caliban. Nor am I convinced, that the imagery of Ismeno's necromantic forest in the Gierusalemme Liberata, guarded by walls and battlements of fire, is less marvellous and sublime, than the leap of Juno's horses in the Iliad, celebrated by Lon∣ginus for its singular magnificence and dignity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">IL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AD, V. 770. Longin. §. ix.</NOTE>. On the prin∣ciples of this critic, Voltaire's Henriad may be placed at the head of the modern epic. But I forbear to anticipate my opi∣nion of a system, which will more properly be considered, when I come to speak of Spenser. I must, however, observe here, that the Gothic and pagan fictions were now frequently blended and incorporated. The Lady of the Lake floated in the suite of Neptune before queen Elisabeth at Kenilworth; Ariel assumes the semblance of a sea-nymph, and Hecate, by an easy associa∣tion, conducts the rites of the weird sisters in Macbeth.</P>
<P>Allegory had been derived from the religious dramas into our civil spectacles. The masques and pageantries of the age of Elisabeth were not only furnished by the heathen divinities, but often by the virtues and vices impersonated, significantly deco∣rated, accurately distinguished by their proper types, and repre∣sented by living actors. The antient symbolical shews of this sort began now to lose their old barbarism and a mixture of re∣ligion, and to assume a degree of poetical elegance and precision. Nor was it only in the conformation of particular figures that much fancy was shewn, but in the contexture of some of the fables or devices presented by groupes of ideal personages. These exhibitions quickened creative invention, and reflected back on poetry what poetry had given. From their familiarity and public nature, they formed a national taste for allegory; and the allego∣rical poets were now writing to the people. Even romance was turned into this channel. In the Fairy Queen, allegory is wrought upon chivalry, and the feats and figments of Arthur's round table
<PB N="499" REF="603"/>
are moralised. The virtues of magnificence and chastity are here personified: but they are imaged with the forms, and under the agency, of romantic knights and damsels. What was an after∣thought in Tasso, appears to have been Spenser's premeditated and primary design. In the mean time, we must not confound these moral combatants of the Fairy Queen with some of its other embodied abstractions, which are purely and professedly allegorical.</P>
<P>It may here be added, that only a few critical treatises, and but one ART OF POETRY, were now written. Sentiments and images were not absolutely determined by the canons of compo∣sition: nor was genius awed by the consciousness of a future and final arraignment at the tribunal of taste. A certain dignity of inattention to niceties is now visible in our writers. Without too closely consulting a criterion of correctness, every man indulged his own capriciousness of invention. The poet's appeal was chiefly to his own voluntary feelings, his own immediate and peculiar mode of conception. And this freedom of thought was often expressed in an undisguised frankness of diction. A cir∣cumstance, by the way, that greatly contributed to give the flowing modulation which now marked the measures of our poets, and which soon degenerated into the opposite extreme of dissonance and asperity. Selection and discrimination were often overlooked. Shakespeare wandered in pursuit of universal nature. The glancings of his eye are from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. We behold him breaking the barriers of imaginary method. In the same scene, he descends from his meridian of the noblest tragic sublimity, to puns and quibbles, to the meanest merriments of a plebeian farce. In the midst of his dignity, he resembles his own Richard the second, the <HI>skipping king,</HI> who sometimes discarding the state of a monarch,
<Q><L>Mingled his royalty with carping fools <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">FIRST P. HENRY iv. Act iii. Sc. ii.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<PB N="500" REF="604"/>
He seems not to have seen any impropriety, in the most abrupt transitions, from dukes to buffoons, from senators to sailors, from counsellors to constables, and from kings to clowns. Like Virgil's majestic oak,

<P>No Satires, properly so called, were written till towards the latter end of the queen's reign, and then but a few. Pictures drawn at large of the vices of the times, did not suit readers who loved to wander in the regions of artificial manners. The Muse, like the people, was too solemn and reserved, too cere∣monious and pedantic, to stoop to common life. Satire is the poetry of a nation highly polished.</P>
<P>The importance of the female character was not yet acknow∣ledged, nor were women admitted into the general commerce of society. The effect of that intercourse had not imparted a comic air to poetry, nor softened the severer tone of our versification with the levities of gallantry, and the familiarities of compli∣ment, sometimes perhaps operating on serious subjects, and im∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceptibly spreading themselves in the general habits of style and thought. I do not mean to insinuate, that our poetry has suffered from the great change of manners, which this assumption of the gentler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex, or rather the improved state of female education, has produced, by giving elegance and variety to life, by enlarging the sphere of conversation, and by multiplying the topics and enriching the stores of wit and humour. But I am marking the peculiarities of composition: and my meaning was to suggest, that the absence of so important a circumstance from the modes and constitution of ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent life, must have influenced the cotem∣porary poetry. Of the state of manners among our ancestors respecting this point, many traces remain. Their style of court∣ship may be collected from the love-dialogues of Hamlet, young

Percy, Henry the fifth, and Master Fenton. Their tragic heroines, their Desdemonas and Ophelias, although of so much consequence in the piece, are degraded to the back-ground. In comedy, their ladies are nothing more than MERRY WIVES, plain and chearful matrons, who stand upon the <HI>chariness of their honesty.</HI> In the smaller poems, if a lover praises his mistress, she is com∣plimented in strains neither polite nor pathetic, without elegance and without affection: she is described, not in the address of intelligible yet artful panegyric, not in the real colours, and with the genuine accomplishments, of nature, but as an eccentric ideal being of another system, and as inspiring sentiments equally unmeaning, hyperbolical, and unnatural.</P>
<P>All or most of these circumstances, contributed to give a descriptive, a picturesque, and a figurative cast to the poetical language. This effect appears even in the prose compositions of the reign of Elisabeth. In the subsequent age, prose became the language of poetry.</P>
<P>In the mean time, general knowledge was encreasing with a wide diffusion and a hasty rapidity. Books began to be multi∣plied, and a variety of the most useful and rational topics had been discussed in our own language. But science had not made too great advances. On the whole, we were now arrived at that period, propitious to the operations of original and true poetry, when the coyness of fancy was not always proof against the approaches of reason, when genius was rather directed than go∣verned by judgement, and when taste and learning had so far only disciplined imagination, as to suffer its excesses to pass without censure or controul, for the sake of the beauties to which they were allied.</P>
