<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. <HI>Julian is declared Emperor by the Legions of Gaul.—His March and Success.—The Death of Constan∣tius.—Civil Administration of Julian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bishops, the praises of Julian were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The jea∣lousy of Constan∣tius against Julian.</NOTE> repeated with transport in every part of the empire, except in the palace of Constantius. The Barbarians of Germany had felt, and still dreaded, the arms of the young Caesar; his sol∣diers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favourites, who had opposed his elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long as the fame
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who were skilled in the language of sa∣tire, tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with success. They easily discovered, that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the dress and person of the phi∣losophic warrior; and his modest dispatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the academy <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Omnes qui plus poterant in palatio, adulandi professores jam docti, recte consulta, prospereque completa vertebant in deridicu∣lum: talia sine modo strepentes insulse; in odium venit cum vic∣toriis suis; capella, non homo; ut hirsutum Julianum carpentes, appellantesque loquacem talpam, et purpuratam simiam, et litterio∣nem Graecum: et his congruentia plurima atque vernacula principi resonantes, audire haec taliaque gestienti, virtutes ejus obruere verbis impudentibus conabantur, ut segnem incessentes et timidum et um∣bratilem, gestaque secus verbis comptioribus exornantem. Ammi∣anus, xvii. 11.</NOTE>. The voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory; the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours. In the letters crowned with laurel, which, according to ancient custom, were addressed to the provinces, the name of Julian was omitted. <Q>Constantius had made his dispositions in person; <HI>he</HI> had signalized his valour in the foremost ranks; <HI>his</HI> military
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
conduct had secured the victory; and the captive king of the Barbarians was presented to <HI>him</HI> on the field of battle,</Q> from which he was at that time distant above forty days jour∣ney <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 12. The orator Themistius (iv. p. 56, 57.) believed whatever was contained in the Imperial letters, which were addressed to the senate of Constantinople. Aurelius Victor, who published his Abridgment in the last year of Constantius, ascribes the German victories to the <HI>wisdom</HI> of the emperor, and the <HI>fortune</HI> of the Caesar. Yet the historian, soon afterwards, was indebted to the favour or esteem of Julian for the honour of a brass statue; and the important offices of consular of the second Pannonia, and praefect of the city. Ammian. xxi. 10.</NOTE>. So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor him∣self. Secretly conscious that the applause and favour of the Romans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants, who coloured their mischiev∣ous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candour <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Callido nocendi artificio, accusatoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant. . . Hae voces fuerunt ad inslammanda odia probris om∣nibus potentiores. See Mamertin. in Actione Gratiarum in Vet. Panegyr. xi. 5, 6.</NOTE>. Instead of depreciating the me∣rits of Julian, they acknowledged, and even ex∣aggerated, his popular fame, superior talents, and important services. But they darkly insi∣nuated, that the virtues of the Caesar might in∣stantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes; if the inconstant multitude should pre∣fer their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge, and independent greatness. The personal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fears and envy of Constan∣tius.</NOTE> a laudable anxiety for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps in his own breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear, the sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.</P>
<P>The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The le∣gions of Gaul are ordered to march into the East, A. D. 360, April.</NOTE> imminent danger of the eastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design which was art∣fully concerted by the Imperial ministers. They resolved to disarm the Caesar; to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dig∣nity; and to employ in a distant war against the Persian monarch, the hardy veterans who had vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of his winter-quarters at Paris in the administration of power, which, in his hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary; with positive orders from the emperor, which <HI>they</HI> were directed to execute, and <HI>he</HI> was commanded not to oppose. Constantius signified his pleasure, that four entire legions, the Celtae, and Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, should be separated from the standard of Julian, under which they had acquired their fame and discipline; that in each of the remaining bands, three hundred of the bravest youths should be
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
selected; and that this numerous detachment, the strength of the Gallic army, should instantly begin their march, and exert their utmost dili∣gence to arrive, before the opening of the cam∣paign, on the frontiers of Persia <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The minute interval, which may be interposed between the <HI>byeme adultâ</HI> and the <HI>primo vere</HI> of Ammianus (xx. 1. 4.), instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march of three thousand miles, would render the orders of Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust. The troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of Ammianus must have been inac∣curate, and his language incorrect.</NOTE>. The Caesar foresaw, and lamented, the consequences of this fatal mandate. Most of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated, that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps. The public faith of Rome, and the per∣sonal honour of Julian, had been pledged for the observance of this condition. Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence, and excite the resentment, of the independent warriors of Germany, who consi∣dered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions. The legionaries, who enjoyed the title and pri∣vileges of Romans, were enlisted for the general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the anti∣quated names of the republic and of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they despised, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the Persian arrows, and the burning de∣serts
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
of Asia. They claimed, as their own, the country which they had saved; and excused their want of spirit, by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends. The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength, the Germans would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears; and notwithstanding the abilities and valour of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed, must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a prisoner in the camp of the Barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had received, he subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people who deserved his affection. But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion, and a declaration of war. The in∣exorable jealousy of the emperor, the peremp∣tory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his com∣mands, left not any room for a fair apology, or candid interpretation; and the dependent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate. Solitude encreased the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the mi∣nisters, who would have been afraid, or ashamed,
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
to approve the ruin of Gaul. The moment had been chosen, when Lupicinus, <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xx. 1. The valour of Lupicinus, and his mili∣tary skill, are acknowledged by the historian, who, in his affected language, accuses the general of exalting the horns of his pride, bellowing in a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt, whether he was more cruel or avaricious. The danger from the Scots and Picts was so serious, that Julian himself had some thoughts of passing over into the island.</NOTE> the general of the cavalry, was dispatched into Britain, to re∣pulse the inroads of the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the assess∣ment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt statesman, declining to assume a respon∣sible part on this dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of Julian, who represented to him, that in every important mea∣sure, the presence of the praefect was indispen∣sable in the council of the prince. In the mean while the Caesar was oppressed by the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial messen∣gers, who presumed to suggest, that if he ex∣pected the return of his ministers, he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution. Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the most serious terms, his wish, and even his intention, of resigning the purple, which he could not preserve with honour, but which he could not abdicate with safety.</P>
<P>After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dis∣contents.</NOTE> to acknowledge, that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and that the sove∣reign
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He issued the necessary orders for car∣rying into execution the commands of Constan∣tius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the several garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly. They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials; who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair, or loud lamentations; while the wives of the soldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accused the desertion of their hus∣bands in the mixed language of grief, of ten∣derness, and of indignation. This scene of ge∣neral distress afflicted the humanity of the Caesar; he granted a sufficient number of post-waggons to transport the wives and families of the sol∣diers <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">He granted them the permission of the <HI>cursus clavularis,</HI> or <HI>clabu∣laris.</HI> These post-waggons are often mentioned in the Code, and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight.

The grief of an armed multitude is soon con∣verted into rage; their licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes, a sea∣sonable libel was secretly dispersed, which paint∣ed,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
in lively colours, the disgrace of the Caesar, the oppression of the Gallic army, and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia. The servants of Constantius were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit. They pressed the Caesar to hasten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian; who proposed that they should not march through Paris, and sug∣gested the danger and temptation of a last in∣terview.</P>
<P>As soon as the approach of the troops was <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pro∣claim Ju∣lian empo∣ror.</NOTE> announced, the Caesar went out to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city. After distinguishing the officers and soldiers, who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention, Julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude: he cele∣brated their exploits with grateful applause; en∣couraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honour of serving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admonished them, that the commands of Augustus required an in∣stant and cheerful obedience. The soldiers, who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamour, or of belying their senti∣ments by false and venal acclamations, main∣tained an obstinate silence; and, after a short pause, were dismissed to their quarters. The principal officers were entertained by the Caesar, who professed, in the warmest language of friend∣ship,
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
his desire and his inability to reward, ac∣cording to their deserts, the brave companions of his victories. They retired from the feast, full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hardship of their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native country. The only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved; the popular resentment was insensibly moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of complaint were heightened by passion, and their passions were inflamed by wine; as on the eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in licentious festivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous multitude, with swords, and bowls, and torches, in their hands, rushed into the suburbs; encompassed the palace <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>Most probably the palace of the baths <HI>(Thermarum),</HI> of which a solid and lofty hall still subsists in the <HI>rue de la Harpe.</HI> The buildings covered a considerable space of the modern quarter of the univer∣sity; and the gardens, under the Merovingian kings, communi∣cated with the abbey of St. Germain des Prez. By the injuries of time and the Normans, this ancient palace was reduced, in the twelfth century, to a maze of ruins; whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love.</P>

careless of future dangers, pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words, JULIAN AUGUSTUS! The prince, whose anxious suspence was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations, secured the doors against their intrusion; and, as long as it was in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day, the soldiers, whose zeal was irritated by opposition, forcibly entered the pa∣lace, seized, with respectful violence, the object of their choice, guarded Julian with drawn swords through the streets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal, and with repeated shouts sa∣luted him as their emperor. Prudence, as well as loyalty, inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs; and of preparing for his oppressed virtue, the excuse of violence. Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals, he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed his indignation; conjured them not to fully the fame of their im∣mortal victories; and ventured to promise, that if they would immediately return to their alle∣giance, he would undertake to obtain from the emperor, not only a free and gracious pardon, but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their resentment. But the soldiers, who were conscious of their guilt, chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian, than on the clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was in∣sensibly turned into impatience, and their im∣patience into rage. The inflexible Caesar sus∣tained
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
till the third hour of the day, their prayers, their reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he yield, till he had been repeatedly assured, that if he wished to live, he must con∣sent to reign. He was exalted on a shield in the presence, and amidst the unanimous acclama∣tions, of the troops; a rich military collar, which was offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Even in this tumultuous moment, Julian attended to the forms of superstitious ceremony; and obstinately refused the inauspicious use of a female necklace, or a horse-collar, which the impatient soldiers would have employed in the room of a diadem.</NOTE>; the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">An equal proportion of gold and silver, five pieces of the for∣mer, one pound of the latter; the whole amounting to about five pounds ten shillings of our money.</NOTE>; and the new emperor, overwhelmed with real or affected grief, retired into the most secret recesses of his apartment <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">For the whole narrative of this revolt, we may appeal to au∣thentic and original materials; Julian himself (ad S.

Graec. tom. vii. p. 269—273.), Ammianus (xx. 4.), and Zosimus (l. iii. p. 151, 152, 153.), who, in the reign of Julian, appears to follow the more respectable authority of Eunapius.

of princes. His lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge, of duty and of ambition, of the love of fame and of the fear of reproach. But it is impossible for us to cal∣culate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments; or to ascertain the principles of action, which might escape the observation, while they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian himself. The discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion; and if Julian had tried to con∣ceal a deep design under the appearances of chance, he must have employed the most con∣summate artifice without necessity, and probably without success. He solemnly declares, in the presence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that, till the close of the evening which preceded his ele∣vation, he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Julian. ad S.

Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the enemy, and that he himself was the favourite, of the gods, might prompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of

mankind. When Julian had received the intel∣ligence of the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short slumber; and afterwards related to his friends, that he had seen the Genius of the em∣pire waiting with some impatience at his door, pressing for admittance, and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xx. 5. with the note of Lindenbrogius on the Genius of the empire. Julian himself, in a confidential letter to his friend and physician, Oribasius (Epist. xvii. p. 384.), mentions another dream, to which, before the event, he gave credit; of a stately tree thrown to the ground, of a small plant striking a deep root into the earth. Even in his sleep, the mind of the Caesar must have been agitated by the hopes and fears of his fortune. Zosimus (l. iii. p. 155.) relates a subsequent dream.</NOTE>. Astonished and perplexed, he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter; who immediately signified, by a clear and manifest omen, that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the army. The conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason, excites our suspicion and eludes our enquiry. Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at once so credulous and so crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.</P>

But Otho had much more guilt, and much less abilities, than Julian.</NOTE>, to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against his life and dignity, were the cares which employed the first days of the reign of the new Emperor. Although he was firmly resolved to maintain the
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
station which he had assumed, he was still de∣sirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war, of declining a contest with the su∣perior forces of Constantius, and of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the ensigns of military and Imperial pomp, Julian shewed him∣self in the field of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil, their leader, and their friend. He recapitulated their victories, lamented their suf∣ferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and checked their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of the East would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views of con∣quest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the Gallic provinces. On this foun∣dation he composed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a specious and moderate epistle <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">To this ostensible epistle he added, says Ammianus, private letters, objurgatorias et mordaces, which the historian had not seen, and would not have published. Perhaps they never existed.</NOTE>, which was delivered to Pentadius, his master of the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius; two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer, and observe the disposi∣tions of Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation of Caesar; but Ju∣lian solicits in a peremptory, though respectful
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
manner, the confirmation of the title of Au∣gustus. He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while he justifies, in some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent. He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius; and engages to send him an annual present of Spanish horses, to recruit his army with a select number of Barbarian youths, and to accept from his choice a Praetorian praefect of approved discre∣tion and fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes the emperor to consult the dic∣tates of justice; to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers, who subsist only by the discord of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honourable treaty, equally advantageous to the republic, and to the house of Constantine. In this negociation Julian claimed no more than he already possessed. The delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was still obeyed under a name more independent and august. The sol∣diers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty. Florentius was a fugitive; Lupici∣nus a prisoner. The persons who were disaffected to the new government were disarmed and se∣cured; and the vacant offices were distributed, according to the recommendation of merit, by a

<P>The negociations of peace were accompanied <NOTE PLACE="marg">His fourth and fifth expedi∣tions be∣yond the Rhine, A. D. 360, 361.</NOTE> and supported by the most vigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held in rea∣diness for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the times. The cruel persecution of the faction of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers. They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could trust, submitted to the restraints of mili∣tary discipline, and retained only their impla∣cable hatred to the person and government of Constantius <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 50. p. 275, 276. A strange disorder, since it continued above seven years.

See Hume's Essays, tom. i. p. 426, 427.</NOTE>. As soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he ap∣peared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the At∣tuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that they might ravage, with impunity, the frontiers of a divided empire. The difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprize, consisted in a laborious march; and Julian had conquered, as soon as he could penetrate into a country, which former
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
princes had considered as inaccessible. After he had given peace to the Barbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the Rhine from Cleves to Basil; surveyed, with peculiar attention, the territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni, passed through Besançon <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Julian (Epist. xxxviii. p. 414.) gives a short description of Vesontio, or Besançon: a rocky peninsula almost encircled by the river Doux; once a magnificent city, filled with temples, &amp;c. now reduced to a small town, emerging however from its ruins.</NOTE>, which had severely suffered from their fury, and fixed his head-quarters at Vienna for the ensuing winter. The barrier of Gaul was improved and strengthened with additional fortifications; and Julian entertained some hopes, that the Germans, whom he had so often van∣quished, might, in his absence, be restrained, by the terror of his name. Vadomair <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Vadomair entered into the Roman service, and was promoted from a Barbarian kingdom to the military rank of duke of Phae∣nicia. He still retained the same artful character (Ammian. xxi. 4.); but, under the reign of Valens, he signalised his valour in the Armenian war (xxix. 1.).</NOTE> was the only prince of the Alemanni, whom he esteemed or feared; and while the subtle Barbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties, the progress of his arms threatened the state with an unseason∣able and dangerous war. The policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the Ale∣manni by his own arts; and Vadomair, who, in the character of a friend, had incautiously ac∣cepted an invitation from the Roman governors, was seized in the midst of the entertainment, and sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain.
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
Before the Barbarians were recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river, renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been already made by four preceding expeditions <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xx. 10. xxi. 3, 4.

<P>The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruitless treaty and declaration of war, A. D. 361.</NOTE> to execute, with the utmost diligence, their im∣portant commission. But, in their passage through Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial go∣vernors; they were conducted by slow journies from Constantinople to Caesarea in Cappadocia; and when at length they were admitted to the presence of Constantius, they found that he had already conceived, from the dispatches of his own officers, the most unfavourable opinion of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic army. The letters were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers were dismissed with indig∣nation and contempt; and the looks, the ges∣tures, the furious language of the monarch, ex∣pressed the disorder of his soul. The domestic connection, which might have reconciled the brother and the husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by the death of that princess, whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless, and was at last fatal to herself <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Her remains were sent to Rome, and interred near those of her sister Constantina, in the suburb of the <HI>Via Nomentana.</HI> Am∣mian. xxi. 1.

The empress Eu∣sebia
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
had preserved to the last moment of her life the warm, and even jealous, affection which she had conceived for Julian; and her mild in∣fluence might have moderated the resentment of a prince, who, since her death, was abandoned to his own passions, and to the arts of his eu∣nuchs. But the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a pri∣vate enemy; he continued his march towards the confines of Persia, and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign. He required, that the pre∣sumptuous Caesar should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus, which he had accepted from the rebels; that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent minister; that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court; and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic bishop, and one of the Arian favourites of Constantius. Several months were ineffec∣tually consumed in a treaty which was negociated at the distance of three thousand miles between
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as Julian per∣ceived that his moderate and respectful behaviour served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war. He gave a public and military audience to the quaestor Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constan∣tius was read to the attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most flattering defe∣rence, that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The saint proposal was impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of <Q>Julian Au∣gustus, continue to reign, by the authority of the army, of the people, of the republic, which you have saved,</Q> thundred at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius. A part of the letter was afterwards read, in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had invested with the honours of the purple; whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness; whom he had preserved in his in∣fancy, when he was left a helpless orphan; <Q>an orphan!</Q> interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by indulging his passions: <Q>Does the as∣sassin of my family reproach me that I was left an orphan? He urges me to revenge those injuries, which I have long studied to forget.</Q> The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas, who, with some difficulty, had been
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
protected from the popular fury, was sent back to his master, with an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of the most vehement elo∣quence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of resentment, which had been suppressed and embittered by the dissimulation of twenty years. After this message, which might be con∣sidered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some weeks before, had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany, <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Feriarum die quem celebrantes mense Januario, Christiani <HI>Epiphania</HI> dictitant, progressus in eorum ecclesiam, solemniter numine orato discessit. Ammian. xxi. 2. Zonaras observes, that it was on Christmas-day, and his assertion is not inconsistent; since the churches of Egypt, Asia, and perhaps Gaul, celebrated on the same day (the sixth of January), the nativity and the baptism of their Saviour. The Romans, as ignorant as their brethren of the real date of his birth, fixed the solemn festival to the 25th of De∣cember, the <HI>Brumalia,</HI> or winter solstice, when the Pagans annually celebrated the birth of the Sun. See Bingham's Antiquities of the Christian Church, l. xx. c. 4. and Beausobre Hist.

<P>The situation of Julian required a vigorous <NOTE PLACE="marg">Julian pre∣pares to attack Constan∣tius.</NOTE> and immediate resolution. He had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his adversary, sa∣crificing the interest of the state to that of the
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
monarch, had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West. The position of two magazines, one of them collected on the banks of the lake of Constance, the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to indi∣cate the march of two armies; and the size of those magazines, each of which consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Three hundred myriads, or three millions of <HI>medimni,</HI> a corn∣measure familiar to the Athenians, and which contained six Roman <HI>modii.</HI> Julian explains, like a soldier and a statesman, the danger of his situation, and the necessity and advantages of an offensive war (ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 286, 287.).</NOTE> was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the enemy, who prepared to surround him. But the Imperial legions were still in their distant quarters of Asia; the Da∣nube was feebly guarded; and if Julian could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his standard, and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute to the expences of the civil war. He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers; inspired them with a just confidence in their general, and in themselves; and exhort∣ed them to maintain their reputation, of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their fellow∣citizens, and obedient to their officers. His spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations, and the same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius, when he sum∣moned them to leave Gaul, now declared with
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
alacrity, that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or Asia. The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers, clashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their throats, devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul, and the conqueror of the Germans <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">See his oration, and the behaviour of the troops, in Am∣mian. xxi. 5.</NOTE>. This solemn engagement, which seemed to be dictated by affection, rather than by duty, was singly opposed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect. That faith∣ful minister, alone and unassisted, asserted the rights of Constantius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury he had almost fallen an honourable, but useless, sacrifice. After losing one of his hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended. Julian covered the praefect with his Imperial mantle, and protecting him from the zeal of his followers, dismissed him to his own house, with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">He sternly refused his hand to the suppliant praefect, whom he sent into Tuscany (Ammian. xxi. 5.). Libanius, with savage fury, insults Nebridius, applauds the soldiers, and almost censures the humanity of Julian (Orat. Parent. c. 53. p. 278.).</NOTE>. The high office of Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul, which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian, who was permitted to practise those
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxi. 8. In this promotion, Julian obeyed the law which he publicly imposed on himself. Neque civilis quisquam judex nec militaris rector, alio quodam praeter merita suffragante, ad potiorum veniat gradum (Ammian. xx. 5.). Absence did not weaken his regard for Sallust, with whose name (A. D. 363.) he honoured the consulship.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hopes of Julian depended much less on <NOTE PLACE="marg">His march from the Rhine into Illyricum.</NOTE> the number of his troops, than on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of a daring en∣terprise, he availed himself of every precaution, as far as prudence could suggest; and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps, he trusted the event to valour and to fortune. In the neighbourhood of Basil he assembled and divided his army <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxi. 8.) ascribes the same practice, and the same motive, to Alexander the Groat, and other skilful generals.</NOTE>. One body, which consisted of ten thousand men, was directed, under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum. A similar division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus, prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways, through the Alps and the northern confines of Italy. The instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and precision: to hasten their march in close and compact columns, which, according to the disposition of the ground, might readily be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards; to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
examination by their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of their strength, and the terror of his name; and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium. For himself, Julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part. He selected three thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like their leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat: at the head of this faithful band, he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian, or black forest, which conceals the sources of the Danube <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">This wood was a part of the great Hercynian forest, which, in the time of Caesar, stretched away from the country of the Rau∣raci (Basil) into the boundless regions of the North. See Cluver. Germania Antiqua, l. iii. c. 47.</NOTE>; and, for many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to the world. The secrecy of his march, his dili∣gence, and vigour, surmounted every obstacle; he forced his way over mountains and morasses, occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pur∣sued his direct course <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Compare Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 53. p. 278, 279, with Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. iii. p. 68. Even the saint admires the speed and secrecy of this march. A modern divine might apply to the progress of Julian, the lines which were originally designed for another apostate:

In the course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted the deputation of some cities, which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he passed before the hostile stations, which were placed along the river, without indulging the temptation of signalizing an useless and ill-timed valour. The banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators, who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the event, and diffused through the adjacent country the same of a young hero, who advanced with more
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the West. Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of the cavalry, commanded the military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor believe. He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops; when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forwards with some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life or death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the pre∣sence of Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupify his faculties. But Lu∣cilian had no sooner recovered his spirits, than he betrayed his want of discretion, by presuming to admonish his conqueror, that he had rashly ventured, with a handful of men, to expose his person in the midst of his enemies. <Q>Reserve for your master Constantius these timid remon∣strances, replied Julian, with a smile of con∣tempt; when I gave you my purple to kiss, I received you not as a counsellor, but as a suppliant.</Q> Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt, and that boldness only could command success, he instantly advanced, at the head of three thousand soldiers, to attack the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful accla∣mations of the army and people; who, crowned
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
with flowers, and holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were de∣voted to the public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the Circus; but, early on the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almost in the mid-way between Sirmium and Constantinople, separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia, by an abrupt descent towards the former, and a gentle decli∣vity on the side of the latter <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">The description of Ammianus, which might be supported by collateral evidence, ascertains the precise situation of the <HI>Angustiae Succorum,</HI> or passes of <HI>Succi.</HI> M. d'Anville, from the trifling resem∣blance of names, has placed them between Sardica and Naissus.

with precipitation to the court of Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of his temper, stigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of the Year, the epithet of <HI>fugitive</HI> to the names of the two consuls. The provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor, who, conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher, was equally admired in the camps of the Danube, and in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or, more properly, from his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he distri∣buted to the principal cities of the empire, a laboured apology for his own conduct; published the secret dispatches of Constantius; and solicited the judgment of mankind between two compe∣titors, the one of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the Barbarians <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Julian (ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 286.) positively asserts, that he intercepted the letters of Constantius to the Barbarians: and Liba∣nius as positively affirms, that he read them on his march to the troops and the cities.

He specifies, however, an intercepted letter from Vadomair to Con∣stantius, which supposes an intimate correspondence between them: "Caesar tuus disciplinam non habet."</NOTE>. Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude, aspired to maintain, by argument as well as by arms, the superior merits of his cause; and to excel, not only in the arts of war, but in those of composition. His epistle to the senate and people of Athens <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Zosimus mentions his epistles to the Athenians, the Corin∣thians, and the Lacedaemonians. The substance was probably the same, though the address was properly varied. The epistle to the Athenians is still extant (p. 268-287.), and has afforded much valuable information. It deserves the praises of the Abbé de la Bleterie. (Pref. à l'Histoire de Jovien, p. 24, 25.), and is one of the best manifestoes to be found in any language.</NOTE> seems to have been
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
dictated by an elegant enthusiasm; which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his own times, with the same humble deference, as if he had been plead∣ing, in the days of Aristides, before the tribunal of the Areopagus. His application to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted to bestow the titles of Imperial power, was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic. An assembly was summoned by Tertullus, praefect of the city; the epistle of Julian was read; and as he appeared to be master of Italy, his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice. His oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine, and his pas∣sionate invective against the vices of Constantius, were heard with less satisfaction; and the senate, as if Julian had been present, unanimously ex∣claimed, <Q>Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own fortune <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot"><HI>Auctori tuo reverentiam rogamus.</HI> Ammian. xxi. 10.

The intelligence of the march and rapid pro∣gress of Julian was speedily transmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostile preparati∣ons</NOTE> some respite from the Persian war. Disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt, Constantius professed his intention of returning into Europe, and of giving chace to Julian; for he never spoke of this military expe∣dition in any other light than that of a hunting party <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Tanquam venaticiam praedam caperet: hoc enim ad leniendum suorum metum subinde praedicabat. Ammian. xxi. 7.</NOTE>. In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this design to his army; slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Caesar; and ventured to assure them, that if the muti∣neers of Gaul presumed to meet them in the field, they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes, and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset. The speech of the emperor was received with military applause, and Theodotus, the president of the council of Hierapolis, re∣quested, with tears of adulation, that <HI>his</HI> city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">See the speech and preparations in Ammianus, xxi. 13.

<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
victories of Constantius inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of success. The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the subsistence of Rome was intercepted; and the distress of Julian was increased, by an unexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal consequences. Julian had received the submission of two legions and a cohort of archers, who were stationed at Sirmium; but he suspected, with reason, the fide∣lity of those troops, which had been distin∣guished by the emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from the most important scene of action. They ad∣vanced, with reluctance, as far as the confines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and the savage fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the instigation of one of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that im∣pregnable city. The vigilance of Julian per∣ceived at once the extent of the mischief, and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy; and the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence, and prosecuted with vigour. But the legionaries, who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline, conducted the defence of the place with skill and perseverance; invited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their cou∣rage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of

<P>But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative, which he pathetically la∣ments, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and death of Con∣stantius, A. D. 361, Nov. 3.</NOTE> of destroying, or of being himself destroy∣ed: and the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman empire from the calamities of civil war. The approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch; and his favou∣rites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge. A slight fever, which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits, was encreased by the fatigues of the journey; and Constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene, twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired, after a short illness, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">His death and character are faithfully delineated by Ammia∣nus (xxi. 14, 15, 16.); and we are authorised to despise and detest the foolish calumny of Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 68.), who accuses Julian of contriving the death of his benefactor. The private re∣pentance of the emperor, that he had spared and promoted Julian (p. 69. and Orat. xxi. p. 389.), is not improbable in itself, nor incompatible with the public verbal testament, which prudential considerations might dictate in the last moments of his life.</NOTE>. His genuine character, which was composed of pride and weakness, of super∣stition and cruelty, has been fully displayed in
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events. The long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his con∣temporaries; but as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity, the last of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world with the remark, that he inherited the defects, without the abilities, of his father. Be∣fore Constantius expired, he is said to have named Julian for his successor; nor does it seem impro∣bable, that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife, whom he left with child, may have prevailed, in his last moments, over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge. Eusebius, and his guilty associates, made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the election of another emperor: but their intrigues were rejected with disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil dis∣cord; and two officers of rank were instantly dispatched, to assure Julian, that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service. The military designs of that prince, who had formed three different attacks against Thrace, were pre∣vented by this fortunate event. Without shed∣ding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a complete victory. Impatient to visit the place of his birth, and the new capital of the empire, he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of Haemus, and the cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
distance of sixty miles, all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him; and he made his triumphal entry, amidst the dutiful acclamations <NOTE PLACE="marg">Julian en∣ters Con∣stantino∣ple, Dec. 11.</NOTE> of the soldiers, the people, and the senate. An innumerable multitude pressed around him with eager respect; and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small stature, and simple garb, of a hero, whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the Barbarians of Germany, and who had now traversed, in a successful career, the whole continent of Europe, from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus. <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">In describing the triumph of Julian, Ammianus (xxii. 1, 2.) assumes the lofty tone of an orator or poet; while Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 56. p. 281.) sinks to the grave simplicity of an historian.</NOTE> A few days afterwards, when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the harbour, the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected humanity of their sovereign. On foot, without his diadem, and clothed in a mourning habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the Holy Apostles, where the body was deposited: and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his Im∣perial kinsman, the tears of Julian professed to the world, that he had forgot the injuries, and remembered only the obligations, which he had received from Constantius. <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The funeral of Constantius is described by Ammianus (xxi. 16.), Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. iv. p. 119.), Mamertinus (in Pa∣negyr. Vet. xi. 27.), Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. lvi. p. 283.), and Philostorgius (l. vi. c. 6. with Godefroy's Dissertations, p. 265.).

legions of Aquileia were assured of the death of the emperor, they opened the gates of the city, and, by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders, ob∣tained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian; who, in the thirty-second year of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">and is ac∣knowledg∣ed by the whole em∣pire.</NOTE> age, acquired the undisputed possession of the Roman empire. <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">The day and year of the birth of Julian are not perfectly as∣certained. The day is probably the sixth of November, and the year must be either 331 or 332. Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 693. Ducange, Fam. Byzantin. p. 50.

<P>Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare <NOTE PLACE="marg">His civil govern∣ment, and private life.</NOTE> the advantages of action and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the accidents of his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice. He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy, and the society of Athens; but he was constrained, at first by the will, and afterwards by the injustice, of Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the dangers of Imperial greatness; and to make himself account∣able to the world, and to posterity, for the hap∣piness of millions. <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Julian himself (p. 253—267.) has expressed these philosophical ideas, with much eloquence, and some affectation, in a very elabo∣rate epistle to Themistius. The Abbé de la Bleterie (tom. ii. p. 146—193.), who has given an elegant translation, is inclined to believe that it was the celebrated Themistius, whose orations are still extant.</NOTE> Julian recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato, <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Julian ad Themist. p. 258. Petavius (not. p. 95.) observes, that this assage is taken from the fourth book de Legibus; but either Julian quoted from memory, or his MSS. were different from ours. Xenophon opens the Cyropaedia with a similar reflection.</NOTE> that the government of our flocks and herds is always
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
committed to beings of a superior species; and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the Gods or of the Genii. From this principle he justly concluded, that the man who presumes to reign, should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature; that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part; that he should extinguish his appetites, en∣lighten his understanding, regulate his passions, and subdue the wild beast, which, according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle, <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Aristot. ap Julian. p. 261. The MS. of Vossius, unsatisfied with a single beast, affords the stronger reading of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which the experience of despotism may warrant.</NOTE> seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot. The throne of Julian, which the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps of vanity. He despised the honours, renounced the pleasures, and dis∣charged with incessant diligence the duties, of his exalted station; and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had they been obliged to submit their time and their ac∣tions to the rigorous laws which their philosophic emperor imposed on himself. One of his most intimate friends, <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">Libanius (Orat. Parentalis, c. lxxxiv. lxxxv. p. 310, 311, 312.) has given this interesting detail of the private life of Julian. He himself (in Misopogon, p. 350.) mentions his vegetable diet, and upbraids the gross and sensual appetite of the people of Antioch.</NOTE> who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light and sparing diet (which was usually of
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
the vegetable kind) left his mind and body always free and active, for the various and important business of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a general, and a prince. In one and the same day, he gave audience to several ambassadors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of letters to his generals, his civil magistrates, his private friends, and the different cities of his dominions. He listened to the memorials which had been received, considered the subject of the petitions, and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in short-hand by the dili∣gence of his secretaries. He possessed such flex∣ibility of thought, and such firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once three several trains of ideas, without hesi∣tation, and without error. While his ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility from one labour to another, and, after a hasty dinner, retired into his library, till the public business, which he had appointed for the evening, sum∣moned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion; and, except in the short interval of a marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female companion. <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Lectulus . . . Vestalium toris purior, is the praise which Mamertinus (Panegyr. Vet. xi. 13.) addresses to Julian himself. Libanius affirms, in sober peremptory language, that Julian never knew a woman before his marriage, or after the death of his wife (Orat. Parent. c. lxxxviii. p. 313.). The chastity of Julian is confirmed by the impartial testimony of Ammianus (xxv. 4.), and the partial silence of the Christians. Yet Julian ironically urges the reproach of the people of Antioch, that he <HI>almost always</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in Misopogon. p. 345.) lay alone. This suspicious expression is explained by the Abbé de la Bleterie (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 103—109.) with candour and ingenuity.</NOTE> He was soon awakened by the
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
entrance of fresh secretaries, who had slept the preceding day; and his servants were obliged to wait alternately, while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupations. The predecessors of Julian, his uncle, his brother, and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for the games of the circus, under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day, as idle spectators, and as a part of the splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot"><P>See Salmasius ad Sueton. in Claud. c. xxi.

On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt and professed an un∣fashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements, condescended to appear in the circus; and after bestowing a careless glance on five or six of the races, he hastily withdrew, with the impatience of a philosopher, who considered every moment

By this avarice of time, he seemed to protract the short duration of his reign; and if the dates were less securely ascertained, we should refuse to believe, that only sixteen months elapsed between the death of Constantius and the de∣parture <NOTE PLACE="marg">December, A.

The actions of Julian can only be preserved by the care of the historian; but the portion of his vo∣luminous writings, which is still extant, remains as a monument of the application, as well as of the genius, of the emperor. The Misopogon, the Caesars, several of his orations, and his ela∣borate work against the Christian religion, were composed in the long nights of the two winters, the former of which he passed at Constantinople, and the latter at Antioch.</P>
<P>The reformation of the Imperial court was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reforma∣tion of the palace.</NOTE> one of the first and most necessary acts of the government of Julian <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">The reformation of the palace is described by Ammianus (xxii. 4.), Libanius (Orat.

Soon after his entrance into the palace of Constantinople, he had oc∣casion for the service of a barber. An officer, magnificently dressed, immediately presented him∣self. <Q>It is a barber, exclaimed the prince,

A thousand barbers, a thousand cup-bearers, a thousand cooks, were distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are the original words of Libanius, which I have faithfully quoted, lest I should be suspected of magnifying the abuses of the royal house∣hold.</NOTE>. The mo∣narch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue, was distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress, his table, his buildings, and his train. The stately palaces erected by Constantine and his sons, were deco∣rated with many coloured marbles, and orna∣ments of massy gold. The most exquisite dain∣ties were procured, to gratify their pride, rather than their taste; birds of the most distant cli∣mates, fish from the most remote seas, fruits out of their natural season, winter roses, and summer snows <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">The expressions of Mamertinus are lively and forcible.

The domestic crowd of the palace
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
surpassed the expence of the legions; yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subser∣vient to the use, or even to the splendor, of the throne. The monarch was disgraced, and the people was injured, by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure, and even titular employments; and the most worthless of man∣kind might purchase the privilege of being maintained, without the necessity of labour, from the public revenue. The waste of an enormous household, the encrease of fees and perquisites, which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity, or solicited their favour, suddenly enriched these haughty menials. They abused their fortune, without considering their past, or their future, condition; and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the ex∣travagance of their dissipations. Their silken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables were served with delicacy and profusion; the houses which they built for their own use, would have covered the farm of an ancient consul; and the most honourable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses, and respectfully to salute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian, who usually slept on the ground, who yielded with reluctance
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
to the indispensable calls of nature; and who placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in de∣spising, the pomp of royalty. By the total ex∣tirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent, he was impatient to re∣lieve the distress, and to appease the murmurs, of the people; who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes, if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state. But in the execution of this salutary work, Julian is accused of proceed∣ing with too much haste and inconsiderate seve∣rity. By a single edict, he reduced the palace of Constantinople to an immense desert, and dis∣missed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependents <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Yet Julian himself was accused of bestowing whole towns on the eunuchs (Orat. vii. against Polyclet. p. 117—127.). Libanius contents himself with a cold but positive denial of the fact, which seems indeed to belong more properly to Constantius.

Such indeed was the temper of Julian, who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices. The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and paint, the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so ri∣diculous in the person of Constantine, were con∣sistently rejected by his philosophic successor.

But with the sopperies, Julian affected to re∣nounce the decencies, of dress; and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of clean∣liness. In a satirical performance, which was designed for the public eye, the emperor descants with pleasure, and even with pride, on the length of his nails, and the inky blackness of his hands; protests, that although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair, the use of the razor was confined to his head alone; and celebrates, with visible complacency, the shaggy and <HI>popu∣lous</HI> <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">In the Misopogon (p. 338, 339.) he draws a very singular picture of himself, and the following words are strangely characteristic; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

I do not mean to apply that epithet to my brother Constantius. He is no more; may the earth lie light on his head!

It is not, however, my intention, that even those men should be oppressed: they are accused, and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial.</Q> To conduct this enquiry, Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army; and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence, without delay, and without appeal.

The rage of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indiscretion, was the cause and the excuse of his death; and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public, of∣fered some consolation to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution of his consiscated fortunes.

Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province; Gaudentius had long practised the arts of ca∣lumny against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the person of Julian himself. Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed, that these wicked men obtained, in the public opinion, the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of Constantius. The rest of his servants were protected by a ge∣neral act of oblivion; and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had ac∣cepted, either to defend the oppressed, or to oppress the friendless. This measure, which, on the soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne. Julian was tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently

Conscious of superior merit, he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare, to meet him in the field, to attempt his life, or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne. The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent; and the hero could despise the ambitious projects, which surpassed the for∣tune or the abilities of the rash conspirators.

The monarch, after mak∣ing some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival, dispatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers, to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards, who had resolved to assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch. Their intemperance revealed their guilt; and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured sovereign, who, after a lively re∣presentation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise, instead of a death of torture, which they deserved and expected, pronounced a sen∣tence of exile against the two principal offenders. The only instance in which Julian seemed to de∣part from his accustomed clemency, was the exe∣cution of a rash youth, who with a feeble hand had aspired to seize the reins of empire. But that youth was the son of Marcellus, the general of cavalry, who, in the first campaign of the

Gallic war, had deserted the standard of the Cae∣sar, and the republic.

But the behaviour of Julian was uni∣formly supported. During the games of the Circus, he had, imprudently or designedly, per∣formed the manumission of a slave in the pre∣sence of the consul.

Gre∣gory Nazianzen (Orat. iv. p. 120.), who suppresses the virtues, and exaggerates even the venial faults, of the apostate; triumphantly asks, Whether such a judge was fit to be seated between Minos and Rhadamanthus, in the Elysian fields?</NOTE>, which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe. The arts of persuasion, so diligently cultivated by the first Caesars, were neglected by the military ignorance and Asiatic pride of their successors; and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers, whom they feared, they treated with silent disdain the senators, whom they de∣spised. The assemblies of the senate, which Constantius had avoided, were considered by Ju∣lian as the place where he could exhibit, with the most propriety, the maxims of a republican,
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
and the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately practised, as in a school of declamation, the se∣veral modes of praise, of censure, of exhortation; and his friend Libanius has remarked, that the study of Homer taught him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menelaus, the copiousness of Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow, or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. The functions of a judge, which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince, were exercised by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amusement; and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian prefects, he often placed him∣self by their side on the seat of judgment. The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably oc∣cupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who laboured to disguise the truth of facts, and to pervert the sense of the laws. He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions, and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice, and the agitation of his body, the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges, the advocates, and their clients. But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends and ministers; and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions, the spectators could observe the shame, as well as the gratitude, of their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
the principles of justice; and he had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations, which assault the tribunal of a sovereign, under the specious forms of compassion and equity. He decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the poor, whom he wished to relieve, were con∣demned to satisfy the just demands of a noble and wealthy adversary. He carefully distin∣guished the judge from the legislator <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of sixteen months, fifty-four have been admitted into the Codes of Theodosius and Justinian.

<P>The generality of princes, if they were stripped <NOTE PLACE="marg">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> of their purple, and cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity. But the personal merit of Julian was, in some measure, independent of his fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life; by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and intense application, he would have obtained, or at least
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
he would have deserved, the highest honours of his profession; and Julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister, or general, of the state in which he was born a private citizen. If the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations; if he had prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the same talents in studious solitude, would have placed, beyond the reach of kings, his present happiness and his immortal fame. When we inspect, with minute, or perhaps malevolent at∣tention, the portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure. His genius was less powerful and sub∣lime than that of Caesar; nor did he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is more simple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness, and prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction be∣tween his duties and his pleasures; who laboured to relieve the distress, and to revive the spirit, of his subjects; and who endeavoured always to connect authority with merit, and happiness with virtue. Even faction, and religious faction, was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war; and to con∣fess, with a sigh, that the apostate Julian was a

<P>THE character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian; and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues, has exaggerated the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of Julian.</NOTE> real and apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance may represent him as a philo∣sophic monarch, who studied to protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the empire; and to allay the theological fever which had in∣flamed the minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile of Athanasius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct of Julian, will remove this favourable preposses∣sion for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest admirers, and his implacable enemies. The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid his∣torian, the impartial spectator of his life and death. The unanimous evidence of his contem∣poraries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself; and his
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments, which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect. A devout and sincere attachment for the gods of Athens and Rome, constituted the ruling passion of Julian <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I shall transcribe some of his own expressions from a short reli∣gious discourse which the Imperial pontiff composed to censure the bold impiety of a Cynic: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>The cause of his strange and fatal apostacy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His edu∣cation and apostacy.</NOTE> may be derived from the early period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family. The names of Christ and of Constantius, the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon associated in a youthful ima∣gination, which was susceptible of the most lively impressions. The care of his infancy was en∣trusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Nicomediae ab Eusebio educatus Episcopo, quem genere longius contingebat. (Ammian. xxii. 9.) Julian never expresses any gra∣titude towards that Arian prelate; but he celebrates his preceptor, the eunuch Mardonius, and describes his mode of education, which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration for the genius, and perhaps the religion, of Homer.

As the two princes advanced towards the years of manhood, they discovered, in their religious sentiments, the dif∣ference of their characters. The dull and ob∣stinate understanding of Gallus embraced, with implicit zeal, the doctrines of Christianity; which never influenced his conduct, or moderated his passions. The mild disposition of the younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the Gospel; and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a theological system, which explains the mysterious essence of the Deity; and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the passive and unresisting obe∣dience which was required, in the name of reli∣gion, by the haughty ministers of the church. Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed the rigid formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions of the young prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and severely checked the freedom of his enquiries, they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides.

The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops, the incessant alterations of their creeds, and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct, insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended. Instead of listening to the proofs of Christianity with that favourable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence, he heard with suspicion, and disputed with ob∣stinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion. Whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of the pre∣vailing controversies, Julian always declared him∣self the advocare of Paganism; under the spe∣cious excuse that, in the defence of the weaker cause, his learning and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed.</P>

Our familiar knowledge of their names and characters, their forms and attributes, <HI>seems</HI> to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence; and the pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those fables, which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience. In the age of Julian, every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion; the magnificent temples of Greece and Asia; the works of those artists who had expressed, in painting or in sculpture, the divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and sacrifices; the successful arts of divination; the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of two thou∣sand years.

<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind, the mythology of the Greeks was com∣posed of a thousand loose and flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree and measure of his religious faith. The creed which Julian adopted for his own use, was of the largest dimensions; and, by a strange contradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of the Gospel, whilst he made a voluntary offer∣ing of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo. One of the orations of Julian is con∣secrated to the honour of Cybele, the mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice, so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian boy. The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a blush, and without a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber; and the stupendous miracle, which convinced the senate and people of Rome that the lump of clay, which their ambassadors had transported over the seas, was endowed with life, and sentiment, and divine power <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">The Idaean mother landed in Italy about the end of the second Punic war.

<P>But the devout philosopher, who sincerely em∣braced, and warmly encouraged, the superstition of the people, reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation; and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple. The extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice, that the pious enquirer, instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense, should diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had been disguised, by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly and of fable <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">See the principles of allegory, in Julian (Orat. vii. p. 216. 222.). His reasoning is less absurd than that of some modern theo∣logians, who assert that an extravagant or contradictory doctrine <HI>must</HI> be divine; since no man alive could have thought of inventing it.</NOTE>. The philosophers of the Platonic school <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a partial and fanatical history: and the learned Brucker (Hist.

Julian himself, who was directed in the myste∣rious pursuit by Aedesius, the venerable successor
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
of Iamblichus, aspired to the possession of a treasure, which he esteemed, if we may credit his solemn asseverations, far above the empire of the world <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Julian, Orat. vii. p. 222. He swears with the most fervent and enthusiastic devotion; and trembles, lest he should betray too much of these holy mysteries, which the profane might deride with an impious Sardonic laugh.</NOTE>. It was indeed a treasure, which derived its value only from opinion; and every artist, who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross, claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry; but his labours served only to animate the pious industry of Julian, who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale. This freedom of interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platonists, exposed the vanity of their art. Without a tedious detail, the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions, the forced etymologies, the solemn trifling, and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who professed to reveal the system of the universe. As the traditions of pagan mythology were variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient cir∣cumstances; and as they translated an arbitrary cypher, they could extract from <HI>any</HI> fable <HI>any</HI> sense which was adapted to their favourite system of religion and philosophy. The lascivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
of some moral precept, or some physical truth; and the castration of Atys explained the revolu∣tion of the sun between the tropics, or the sepa∣ration of the human soul from vice and error <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">See the fifth oration of Julian. But all the allegories which ever issued from the Platonic school, are not worth the short poem of Catullus on the same extraordinary subject. The transition of Atys, from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint, for his irretrievable loss, must inspire a man with pity, an eunuch with despair.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime and important prin∣ciples <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theologi∣cal system of Julian.</NOTE> of natural religion. But as the faith, which is not founded on revelation, must remain destitute of any firm assurance, the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition; and the popular and philo∣sophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in the practice, the writings, and even in the mind of Julian <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">The true religion of Julian may be deduced from the Caesars, p. 308. with Spanheim's notes and illustrations, from the fragments in Cyril, l. ii. p. 57, 58. and especially from the theological oration in Solem Regem, p. 130—158. addressed, in the confidence of friendship, to the praefect Sallust.</NOTE>. The pious empe∣ror acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature, invisible to the eyes, and inaccessible to the understanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or rather, in the Platonic language, had gene∣rated, the gradual succession of dependent spirits, of gods, of daemons, of heroes, and of men; and every being which derived its existence imme∣diately from the First Cause, received the inhe∣rent
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
gift of immortality. That so precious an advantage might not be lavished upon unworthy objects, the Creator had entrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods, the office of forming the human body, and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of these divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower world; but their im∣perfect administration is not exempt from discord or error. The earth, and its inhabitants, are divided among them, and the characters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or Venus, may be dis∣tinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries. As long as our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to solicit the favour, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of heaven; whose pride is gratified by the devotion of man∣kind; and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Julian adopts this gross conception, by ascribing it to his fa∣vourite Marcus Antoninus (Caesares, p. 333.). The Stoics and Platonists hesitated between the analogy of bodies, and the purity of spirits; yet the gravest philosophers inclined to the whimsical fancy of Aristophanes and Lucian, that an unbelieving age might starve the immortal gods. See Observations de Spanheim, p. 284, 444, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues, and to inhabit the temples, which were dedicated to their ho∣nour. They might occasionally visit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and sym∣bol of their glory. The invariable order of the
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
sun, moon, and stars, was hastily admitted by Julian, as a proof of their <HI>eternal</HI> duration; and their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior deity, but of the Omnipotent King. In the system of the Platonists, the visible, was a type of the invisible, world. The celestial bodies, as they were informed by a divine spirit, might be con∣sidered as the objects the most worthy of religious worship. The SUN, whose genial influence per∣vades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the adoration of mankind, as the bright repre∣sentative of the LOGOS, the lively, the rational, the beneficent image of the intellectual Father <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>In every age, the absence of genuine inspira∣tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fanaticism of the phi∣losophers.</NOTE> is supplied by the strong illusions of enthu∣siasm, and the mimic arts of imposture. If, in the time of Julian, these arts had been practised only by the pagan priests, for the support of an expiring cause, some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sa∣cerdotal character. But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal, that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">The sophists of Eunapius perform as many miracles as the saints of the desert; and the only circumstance in their favour is, that they are of a less gloomy complexion.

<P>The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian <NOTE PLACE="marg">Initiation and fana∣ticism of Julian.</NOTE> tempted the philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest; which, from the situation of their young proselyte, might be productive of the most important consequences <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">The dexterous management of these sophists, who played their credulous pupil into each other's hands, is fairly told by Eunapius (p. 69—76.), with unsuspecting simplicity. The Abbé de la Ble∣terie understands, and neatly describes, the whole comedy (Vie de Julien, p. 61—67.).</NOTE>. Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the mouth of Aedesius, who had fixed at Perga∣mus his wandering and persecuted school. But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardour, the diligence, the rapid conception of his pupil, two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthes and Eusebius, sup∣plied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master. These philosophers seem to have pre∣pared and distributed their respective parts; and they artfully contrived, by dark hints, and af∣fected
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
disputes, to excite the impatient hopes of the <HI>aspirant,</HI> till they delivered him into the hands of their associate Maximus, the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic science. By his hands, Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age. His residence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alli∣ance of philosophy and superstition. He ob∣tained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis, which, amidst the ge∣neral decay of the Grecian worship, still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity; and such was the zeal of Julian, that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul, for the sole purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and sacrifices, the great work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies were per∣formed in the depth of caverns, and in the silence of the night; and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated, I shall not presume to describe the hor∣rid sounds, and fiery apparitions, which were presented to the senses, or the imagination, of the credulous aspirant <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">When Julian, in a momentary panic, made the sign of the cross, the daemons instantly disappeared (Greg. Naz. Orat. iii. p. 71.) Gregory supposes that they were frightened, but the priests declared that they were indignant.

In the caverns of Ephesus and
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
Eleusis, the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere, deep, and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which may be ob∣served, or at least suspected, in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics. From that mo∣ment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods; and while the occupations of war, of government, and of study, seemed to claim the whole measure of his time, a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion. The tem∣perance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher, was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious absti∣nence; and it was in honour of Pan or Mercury, of Hecate or Isis, that Julian, on particular days, denied himself the use of some particular food, which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities. By these voluntary fasts, he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honoured by the celestial powers. Notwith∣standing the modest silence of Julian himself, we may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses; that they descended upon earth, to enjoy the conversation of their favourite hero; that they gently interrupted his slumbers, by touching his hand or his hair; that
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
they warned him of every impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdom, in every action of his life; and that he had ac∣quired such an intimate knowledge of his hea∣venly guests, as readily to distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Julian's modesty confined him to obscure and occasional hints; but Libanius expatiates with pleasure on the fasts and visions of the religious hero (Legat. ad Julian. p. 157. and Orat. Parental. c. lxxxiii. p. 309, 310).</NOTE>. These sleeping or waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism, would almost de∣grade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian monk. But the useless lives of Antony or Pa∣chomius were consumed in these vain occupations. Julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle; and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired into his tent, to dictate the wise and salu∣tary laws of an empire, or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of literature and philo∣sophy.</P>
<P>The important secret of the apostacy of Julian <NOTE PLACE="marg">His reli∣gious dissi∣mulation.</NOTE> was entrusted to the fidelity of the <HI>initiated,</HI> with whom he was united by the sacred ties of friend∣ship and religion <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Libanius, Orat.

Gallus had some reason to suspect the secret apostacy of his brother; and in a letter, which may be received as genuine, he exhorts Julian to adhere to the religion of their <HI>ancestors;</HI> an argument, which, as it should seem, was not yet perfectly ripe. See Julian. Op. p. 454. and Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 141.</NOTE>. The pleasing rumour was cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship; and his future greatness became
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
the object of the hopes, the prayers, and the pre∣dictions of the pagans, in every province of the empire. From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte, they fondly expected the cure of every evil, and the restoration of every blessing; and instead of disapproving of the ardour of their pious wishes, Julian ingenuously confessed, that he was ambitious to attain a situation, in which he might be useful to his country, and to his religion. But this religion was viewed with an hostile eye by the successor of Constantine, whose capricious passions alternately saved and threat∣ened the life of Julian. The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a des∣potic government, which condescended to fear them; and if the pagans were reluctantly in∣dulged in the exercise of their superstition, the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration. The apostate soon be∣came the presumptive heir of the monarchy, and his death could alone have appeased the just ap∣prehensions of the Christians <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Gregory (iii. p. 50.), with inhuman zeal, censures Constan∣tius for sparing the infant apostate (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>).

But the young prince, who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr, consulted his safety by dissem∣bling his religion; and the easy temper of poly∣theism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised. Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject, not of censure, but of praise.

<Q>As the statues of the gods, says that orator, which have been defiled with filth, are again placed in a magnificent temple; so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian, after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education. His sentiments were changed; but as it would have been danger∣ous to have avowed his sentiments, his con∣duct still continued the same. Very different from the ass in Aesop, who disguised himself with a lion's hide, our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass; and, while he embraced the dictates of reason, to obey the laws of prudence and necessity <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Libanius Orat. Parental. c. ix. p. 233.</NOTE>.</Q> The dissimulation of Julian lasted above ten years, from his secret initiation at Ephesus, to the beginning of the civil war; when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of Constantius. This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assist∣ing, on solemn festivals, at the assemblies of the Christians, Julian returned, with the impatience of a lover, to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury. But as every act of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession of Chris∣tianity encreased the aversion of Julian for a religion, which oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature, sincerity and courage.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88"/>
The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of the Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes against Christiani∣ty.</NOTE> Roman empire; and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of baptism. But as a philosopher, it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from Christianity, which was supported by the number of its converts, by the chain of prophecy, the splendour of miracles, and the weight of evidence.

the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of Julian. The minds of the faithful were either seduced, or scandalized, or alarmed; and the pagans, who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute, derived, from the popular work of their Imperial missionary, an inexhausti∣ble supply of fallacious objections. But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies, the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation, to main∣tain and propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy, he was tempted to distrust the sin∣cerity, or to despise the understandings, of his antagonists, who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence.</P>
<P>The Christians, who beheld with horror and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Universal toleration.</NOTE> indignation the apostacy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his argu∣ments. The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps with impa∣tience, that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture, which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors. But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were apparently disappointed, by the
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
prudent humanity of a prince <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. lviii. p. 283, 284.) has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his Imperial friend. In a very remarkable epistle to the people of Bostra, Julian himself (epist. lii.) professes his moderation, and betrays his zeal; which is acknowledged by Ammianus, and exposed by Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 72.).</NOTE>, who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of mankind. Instructed by history and reflection, Julian was persuaded, that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither steel nor fire can era∣dicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand. Religious ob∣stinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression; and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who have yielded, are restored as penitents, and those who have resisted, are honoured as saints and martyrs. If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of tyrant, and add new glories to the Ca∣tholic church, which had derived strength and encrease from the severity of the pagan magi∣strates. Actuated by these motives, and appre∣hensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign, Julian surprised the world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a statesman, or a philosopher. He extended to all the inhabit∣ants of the Roman world, the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only hardship
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
which he inflicted on the Christians, was to de∣prive them of the power of tormenting their fellow-subjects, whom they stigmatised with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The Pagans received a gracious permission, or rather an express order, to open ALL their temples <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">In Greece, the temples of Minerva were opened by his express command, before the death of Constantius (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 55. p. 280.); and Julian declares himself a pagan in his public manifesto to the Athenians. This unquestionable evidence may correct the hasty assertion of Ammianus, who seems to suppose Con∣stantinople to be the place where he discovered his attachment to the gods.</NOTE>; and they were at once delivered from the op∣pressive laws, and arbitrary vexations, which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of his sons. At the same time, the bishops and clergy, who had been banished by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and restored to their respective churches; the Donatists, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the Eunomians, and those who, with a more prosperous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the council of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided their theo∣logical disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious encounters. The clamour of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim, <Q>Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the Alemanni;</Q> but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory to per∣suade them to live in concord, or at least in peace, he was perfectly satisfied, before he dis∣missed
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
them from his presence, that he had no∣thing to dread from the union of the Christians. The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this af∣fected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church; and the insi∣dious design of undermining the foundations of Christianity, was inseparably connected with the zeal, which Julian professed, to restore the an∣cient religion of the empire <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xxii. 5.

<P>As soon as he ascended the throne, he as∣sumed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal and devotion of Julian in the re∣storation of paganism.</NOTE> according to the custom of his prede∣cessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not only as the most honourable title of Imperial greatness, but as a sacred and important office; the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious diligence. As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects, he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace displayed the appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice; the blood of another victim was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon; and the Moon, the Stars, and the Genii of the night received their
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
respective and seasonable honours from the inde∣fatigable devotion of Julian. On solemn festi∣vals, he regularly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly con∣secrated, and endeavoured to excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal. Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch, distinguished by the splendor of his purple, and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards, Julian solicited, with re∣spectful eagerness, the meanest offices which con∣tributed to the worship of the gods. Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior ministers, and of female dancers, who were de∣dicated to the service of the temple, it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the con∣summate skill of an haruspex, the imaginary signs of future events. The wisest of the pagans cen∣sured this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who practised the rigid maxims of oeconomy, the expence of re∣ligious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue; a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods; an hundred oxen were frequently sacri∣ficed by Julian on one and the same day; and it soon became a popular jest, that if he should re∣turn
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
with conquest from the Persian war, the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extin∣guished. Yet this expence may appear inconsi∣derable, when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered, either by the hand, or by order, of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world; and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had suffered the silent decay of time, or the recent injuries of Christian rapine. Encouraged by the example, the ex∣hortations, the liberality, of their pious sove∣reign, the cities and families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies. <Q>Every part of the world, exclaims Libanius, with devout transport, displayed the triumph of religion; and the grateful prospect of flaming altars, bleeding victims, the smoke of incense, and a solemn train of priests and prophets, with∣out fear and without danger. The sound of prayer and of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains; and the same ox af∣forded a sacrifice for the gods, and a supper for their joyous votaries <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">The restoration of the Pagan worship is described by Julian (Misopogon, p. 346.), Libanius (Orat.

These writers agree in the essential, and even minute, facts: but the different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of Ju∣lian, are expressive of the gradations of self-applause, passionate ad∣miration, mild reproof, and partial invective.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

which was destitute of theological principles, of moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline; which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution, and was not susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation. The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity, comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers, whom he esteemed the best qualified to co-operate in the execution of his great design; and his pastoral letters <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">See Julian.

Their humility may be shewn in the plainness of their domestic garb; their dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar, they ought not, during the
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
appointed number of days, to depart from the precincts of the temple; nor should a single day be suffered to elapse, without the prayers and the sacrifice, which they are obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state, and of in∣dividuals. The exercise of their sacred func∣tions requires an immaculate purity, both of mind and body; and even when they are dis∣missed from the temple to the occupations of common life, it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of their fellow-citizens. The priest of the gods should never be seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should be chaste, his diet tem∣perate, his friends of honourable reputation; and, if he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy. His studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession. Licentious tales, or comedies, or satires, must be banished from his library; which ought solely to consist of historical and philosophical writings; of history which is founded in truth, and of phi∣losophy which is connected with religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and Sceptics deserve his abhorrence and con∣tempt <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">The exultation of Julian (p. 301.), that these impious sects, and even their writings, are extinguished, may be consistent enough with the sacerdotal character: but it is unworthy of a philosopher to wish that any opinions and arguments the most repugnant to his own should be concealed from the knowledge of mankind.</NOTE>; but he should diligently study the
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics, which unanimously teach that there <HI>are</HI> gods; that the world is governed by their providence; that their goodness is the source of every temporal blessing; and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of reward or punishment.</Q> The Imperial pontiff inculcates, in the most persuasive language, the duties of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues; promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury; and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city, where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of reli∣gion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and hu∣mane regulations of the church; and he very frankly confesses his intention to deprive the Christians of the applause, as well as advantage, which they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Yet he insinuates, that the Christians, under the pretence of charity, inveigled children from their religion and parents, con∣veyed them on shipboard, and devoted those victims to a life of poverty or servitude in a remote country (p. 305.).

consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor. The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia, displayed the triumph of philo∣sophic vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in the honourable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign. Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate, when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus. The emperor immediately inter∣rupted his discourse, advanced to meet him, and, after a tender embrace, conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly: where he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher.

If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred by their own scruples, or by those of their pa∣rents, from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time, relin∣quish the benefits of a liberal education. Julian had reason to expect that, in the space of a few years, the church would relapse into its primae∣val simplicity, and that the theologians, who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant fanatics, inca∣pable of defending the truth of their own prin∣ciples, or of exposing the various follies of Poly∣theism <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">They had recourse to the expedient of composing books for their own schools.

The hopes of future candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a prince, who maliciously reminded them, that it was unlawful for a Christian to use the sword, either, of justice, or, of war: and who studi∣ously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry. The powers of govern∣ment were entrusted to the Pagans, who pro∣fessed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors; and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules of divination, the favourites whom he preferred as the most agree∣able to the gods, did not always obtain the ap∣probation of mankind <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

But the provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less conspicuous station. In the exercise of arbitrary power, they consulted the wishes, rather than the commands, of their sove∣reign; and ventured to exercise a secret and vexati∣ous tyranny against the sectaries, on whom they were

not permitted to confer the honours of martyr∣dom.

<P>The most effectual instrument of oppression, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are condemn∣ed to re∣store the Pagan temples.</NOTE> with which they were armed, was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and ample satisfaction for the temples which they had de∣stroyed under the preceding reign. The zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the sanction of the public authority; and the bishops, who were secure of impunity, had often marched, at the head of their congregations, to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness. The consecrated lands, which had encreased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy, were clearly defined, and easily re∣stored. But on these lands, and on the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had frequently erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party, while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence <NOTE N="96" PLACE="foot">If we compare the gentle language of Libanius (Orat.

But the whole empire, and particu∣larly the East, was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan magistrates, inflamed by zeal and revenge, abused the rigor∣ous privilege of the Roman law; which substi∣tutes, in the place of his inadequate property, the person of the insolvent debtor.

A magnificent church was erected over his remains; a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the clergy, and for the burial of the Christians of Antioch, who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop; and the priests of Apollo retired, with their affrighted and indignant votaries. As soon

as another revolution seemed to restore the for∣tune of Paganism, the church of St. Babylas was demolished, and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings.

The lofty car, that transported the relics of Babylas, was followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innume∣rable multitude; who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David the most ex∣pressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return of the saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the religion of the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment. During the night which terminated
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
this indiscreet procession, the temple of Daphne was in flames; the statue of Apollo was con∣sumed; and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin. The Chris∣tians of Antioch asserted, with religious confi∣dence, that the powerful intercession of St. Ba∣bylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof: but as Julian was reduced to the alternative, of believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose, without hesitation, without evidence, but with some colour of probability, to impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans <NOTE N="113" PLACE="foot">Julian (in Misopogon, p. 361.) rather insinuates, than af∣firms, their guilt.

The Pagans, who had been flat∣tered with the hopes of freedom and toleration, excited his devout avarice; and the rich temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prelate, who exclaimed, in a loud and threatening tone, <Q>How long will these se∣pulchres be permitted to stand?</Q> Under the reign of Constantius, he was expelled by the fury, or rather by the justice, of the people; and it was not without a violent struggle, that the civil and military powers of the state could re∣store his authority, and gratify his revenge.

He main∣tained, that the Galilaeans, whom he had recalled from exile, were not restored, by that general indulgence, to the possession of their respective churches: and he expressed his astonishment, that a criminal, who had been repeatedly con∣demned by the judgment of the emperors, should dare to insult the majesty of the laws, and inso∣lently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alex∣andria, without expecting the orders of his so∣vereign. As a punishment for the imaginary offence, he again banished Athanasius from the city; and he was pleased to suppose, that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced him, that the majority of the Alexandrians were Christians; and that the greatest part of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of their oppressed primate. But the knowledge of their sentiments, instead of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the multitude ren∣dered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader; and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius. The execution of the sentence was still delayed, by the caution or
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
negligence of Ecdicius, praefect of Egypt, who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand. <Q>Though you neglect, says Julian, to write to me on any other subject, at least it is your duty to inform me of your conduct towards Athanasius, the enemy of the gods. My intentions have been long since communicated to you. I swear by the great Serapis, that unless, on the calends of De∣cember, Athanasius has departed from Alex∣andria, nay from Egypt, the officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of gold. You know my temper: I am slow to condemn, but I am still slower to forgive.</Q> This epistle was enforced by a short postscript, written with the emperor's own hand. <Q>The contempt that is shewn for all the gods fills me with grief and indignation. There is nothing that I should see, nothing that I should hear, with more pleasure, than the expulsion of Athanasius from all Egypt. The abominable wretch!

<P>I have endeavoured faithfully to represent the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal and impru∣dence of the Christ∣ians.</NOTE> artful system by which Julian proposed to obtain the effects, without incurring the guilt, or re∣proach, of persecution. But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism perverted the heart and understand∣ing of a virtuous prince, it must, at the same time, be confessed, that the <HI>real</HI> sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by hu∣man passions and religious enthusiasm. The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel, was the object of the applause, rather than of the imita∣tion, of their successors. The Christians, who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire, had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">See the fair confession of Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 61, 62.).</NOTE>, and the habit of believing, that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth. As soon as the
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the pri∣vileges which had been conferred by the favour of Constantine, they complained of the most cruel oppression; and the free toleration of ido∣laters and heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">Hear the furious and absurd complaint of Optatus (de Schis∣mat.

At Pessinus, the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor; and in the city of Caesarea in Cappa∣docia, the temple of Fortune, the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans, was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult. On these occasions, a prince, who felt for the honour of the gods, was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice; and his mind was still more deeply exasperated, when he found, that the fanatics, who had deserved and suffered the pu∣nishment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honours of martyrdom <NOTE N="137" PLACE="foot">Greg.

In the ordinary administration of the laws, the Christians, who formed so large a part of the people, must frequently be con∣demned: but their indulgent brethren, without examining the merits of the cause, presumed their innocence, allowed their claims, and im∣puted the severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious persecution <NOTE N="138" PLACE="foot">Julian determined a law-suit against the new Christian city at Maiuma, the port of Gaza; and his sentence, though it might be imputed to bigotry, was never reversed by his successors.

The Christians considered Julian as a cruel and crafty tyrant; who sus∣pended the execution of his revenge, till he should return victorious from the Persian war. They expected, that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome, he would lay aside the irksome mask of dissimulation; that the amphitheatres would stream with the blood of hermits and bishops; and that the Christians, who still persevered in the profession of the faith, would be deprived of the common benefits of nature and society <NOTE N="139" PLACE="foot">Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 93, 94, 95.

Yet <HI>contemporary</HI> malice could not impute to Julian the troops of martyrs, more especially in the West, which Baronius so greedily swallows, and Tillemont so faintly rejects (Mem.

<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
could wound the reputation of the Apostate, was credulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their indiscreet clamours provoked the temper of a sovereign, whom it was their duty to respect, and their interest to flatter. They still protested, that prayers and tears were their only weapons against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to the justice of offended Heaven. But they insinuated, with sullen resolution, that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness; and that, in the imperfect state of human virtue, the patience, which is founded on principle, may be exhausted by persecution. It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity: but, if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church, we shall be convinced, that, before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of Christ, he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war <NOTE N="141" PLACE="foot">The resignation of Gregory is truly edifying (Orat. iv. p. 123, 124.).

<P>THE philosophical fable which Julian com∣posed under the name of the CAESARS <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See this fable or, satire, p. 306—336. of the Leipsig edition of Julian's works. The French version of the learned Ezekiel Span∣heim (Paris, 1683.) is coarse, languid, and correct; and his notes, prooss, illustrations, &amp;c. are piled on each other till they form a mass of 557 close-printed quarto pages. The Abbé de la Bleterie (Vie de Jovien, tom. i. p. 241—393.) has more happily expressed the spirit, as well as the sense, of the original, which he illustrates with some concise and curious notes.</NOTE>, is one of the most agreeable and instructive pro∣ductions <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cae∣sars of Ju∣lian.</NOTE> of ancient wit <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Spanheim (in his preface) has most learnedly discussed the ety∣mology, origin, resemblance, and disagreement of the Greek <HI>satyrs,</HI> a dramatic piece, which was acted after the tragedy; and the Latin <HI>satires</HI> (from <HI>Satura),</HI> a <HI>miscellaneous</HI> composition, either in prose or verse. Eut the Caesars of Julian are of such an original cast, that the critic is perplexed to which class he should ascribe them.</NOTE>. During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia, Ro∣mulus prepared a feast for the deities of Olym∣pus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate, and for the Roman princes, who had reigned over his martial people, and the vanquished na∣tions of the earth. The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state, and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon,
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
in the upper region of the air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced the society of gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inex∣orable Nemesis, into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the Caesars successively advanced to their seats; and, as they passed, the vices, the defects, the blemishes of their respective characters, were maliciously noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who disguised the wisdom of a philoso∣pher under the mask of a Bacchanal <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in the sixth eclogue of Virgil.</NOTE>. As soon as the feast was ended, the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit. Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Antoninus, were selected as the most illustrious candidates; the effeminate Constantine <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the partiality of Julian against his uncle Constantine, and the Christian religion. On this occasion, the interpreters are compelled, by a more sacred interest, to renounce their allegiance, and to desert the cause of their author.</NOTE> was not excluded from this honourable competition, and the great Alexander was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits; but, in the judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals. When the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart, and to scrutinize the springs of action; the su∣periority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
more decisive and conspicuous <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a Roman. But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher, he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to Socrates than to Alexander (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.).</NOTE>. Alexander and Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and Constantine, ac∣knowledged with a blush, that fame, or power, or pleasure, had been the important object of <HI>their</HI> labours: but the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love, a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of philo∣sophy; and who, in a state of human imperfec∣tion, had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity. The value of this agreeable com∣position (the Caesars of Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the author. A prince, who deline∣ates with freedom the vices and virtues of his predecessors, subscribes, in every line, the cen∣sure or approbation of his own conduct.</P>
<P>In the cool moments of reflection, Julian pre∣ferred <NOTE PLACE="marg">He resolves to march against the Persians, A. D. 362.</NOTE> the useful and benevolent virtues of An∣toninus: but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal ardour, the esteem of the wise, and the applause of the multitude. In the season of life, when the powers of the mind and body en∣joy the most active vigour, the emperor, who was instructed by the experience, and animated by the success, of the German war, resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and memorable atchievement. The ambassadors of

the East, from the continent of India, and the isle of Ceylon <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Inde nationibus Indicis certatim cum donis optimates mitten∣tibus . . . ab usque Divis et <HI>Serendivis.</HI> Ammian. xx. 7. This island, to which the names of Taprobana, Serendib, and Ceylon, have been successively applied, manifests how imperfectly the seas and lands, to the east of cape Comorin, were known to the Romans. 1. Under the reign of Claudius, a freedman, who farmed the cus∣toms of the Red Sea, was accidentally driven by the winds upon this strange and undiscovered coast: he conversed six months with the natives; and the king of Ceylon, who heard, for the first time, of the power and justice of Rome, was persuaded to send an embassy to the emperor (Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 24.). 2. The geographers (and even Ptolemy) have magnified, above fifteen times, the real size of this new world, which they extended as far as the equator, and the neighbourhood of China.</NOTE>, had respectfully saluted the Ro∣man purple <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">These embassies had been sent to Constantius. Ammianus, who unwarily deviates into gross flattery, must have forgotten the length of the way, and the short duration of the reign of Julian.</NOTE>. The nations of the West esteemed and dreaded the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He despised the trophies of a Gothic victory <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Gothos saepe fallaces et perfidos; hostes quaerere se meliores aiebat: illis enim sufficere mercatores Galatas per quos ubique sine conditionis discrimine venumdantur.

The suc∣cessor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms; and he resolved, by the final conquest of Persia, to chastise the haughty nation, which had so long

resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Alexander reminds his rival Caesar, who depreciated the fame and merit of an Asiatic victory, that Crassus and Antony had felt the Persian arrows; and that the Romans, in a war of three hundred years, had not yet subdued the single province of Mesopotamia or Assyria (Caesares, p. 324.).</NOTE>. As soon as the Persian monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filled by a prince of a very different character, he condescended to make some artful, or perhaps sincere, overtures, towards a negociation of peace. But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Ju∣lian; who sternly declared, that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia; and who added, with a smile of contempt, that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia. The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations. The generals were named; a formidable army was destined for this important service; and Julian, marching from Constantinople through the pro∣vinces of Asia Minor, arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor. His ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia, was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire; by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his wisest friends; who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter-quarters, to restore the exhausted strength

<P>If Julian had flattered himself, that his per∣sonal connection with the capital of the East <NOTE PLACE="marg">Licentious manners of the people of Anti∣och.</NOTE> would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the prince and people, he made a very false estimate of his own character, and of the manners of Antioch <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">The Satire of Julian, and the Homilies of St. Chrysostom, ex∣hibit the same picture of Antioch.

The warmth of the climate dis∣posed the natives to the most intemperate en∣joyment of tranquillity and opulence; and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fa∣shion was the only law, pleasure the only pur∣suit, and the splendour of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of An∣tioch. The arts of luxury were honoured; the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule; and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age, announced the universal cor∣ruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the taste, or rather passion, of the Syrians: the most skilful artists were procured

The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory, and was insensible of such happiness, soon dis∣gusted the delicacy of his subjects; and the ef∣feminate Orientals could neither imitate, nor admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained, and sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated, by ancient custom, to the honour of the gods, were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity; and those festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the allure∣ments of pleasure. The majority of the people supported the glory of the Christian name, which had been first invented by their ancestors <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an apostate, the enemy and suc∣cessor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their aversion to Julian.</NOTE> of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St. Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian. His subjects complained, with superstitious indignation, that famine had pursued the emperor's steps from Constantinople to Antioch: and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious at∣tempt to relieve their distress. The inclemency <NOTE PLACE="marg">Scarcity of corn, and public dis∣content.</NOTE> of the season had affected the harvests of Syria; and the price of bread <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Julian states three different proportions of five, ten, or fifteen <HI>modii</HI> of wheat, for one piece of gold, according to the degrees of plenty and scarcity (in Misopogon, p. 369.). From this fact, and from some collateral examples, I conclude, that under the suc∣cessors of Constantine, the moderate price of wheat was about thirty-two shillings the English quarter, which is equal to the ave∣rage price of the sixty-four first years of the present century. See Arbuthnot's Tables of Coins, Weights, and Measures, p. 88, 89. Plin. Hist. Natur. xviii. 12. Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 718—721.

This last I am proud to quote, as the work of a sage and a friend.</NOTE>, in the markets of An∣tioch, had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
arts of monopoly. In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party, as his exclusive property; is used by an∣other as a lucrative object of trade; and is re∣quired by a third, for the daily and necessary support of life; all the profits of the interme∣diate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers. The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and encreased by their own impatience and anxiety; and the apprehen∣sion of a scarcity gradually produced the appear∣ances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poul∣try and fish, Julian publicly declared, that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknow∣ledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people. With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the value of corn. He enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his laws, he sent into the market four hundred and twenty-two thousand <HI>modii,</HI> or mea∣sures, which were drawn, by his order, from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt. The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
the city the accustomed supply; and the small quantities that appeared in the market, were se∣cretly sold at an advanced and illegal price. Ju∣lian still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch, that he had inherited the obstinacy, though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Nunquam a proposito declinabat, Galli similis fratris, licet incruentus. Ammian. xxii. 14. The ignorance of the most en∣lightened princes may claim some excuse; but we cannot be satisfied with Julian's own defence (in Misopogon, p. 368, 369), or the ela∣borate apology of Libanius (Orat. Parental. c. xcvii. p. 321.).</NOTE>. The re∣monstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind. He was per∣suaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands, or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed to the ca∣lamities of their country; and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed, to the sense, not of public duty, but of private interest.

During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the per∣sonal conduct, and even the <HI>beard</HI> of the empe∣ror; and the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates, and the applause of the multitude <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Libanius (ad Antiochenos de Imperatoris ira, c. 17, 18, 19. in Fabricius, Bibliot.

A tyrant might have proscribed, without distinc∣tion, the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust, the rapaciousness, and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul.

His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth; his disciples, who sometimes exceeded the num∣ber of eighty, celebrated their incomparable master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who per∣secuted him from one city to another, confirmed the favourable opinion which Libanius osten∣tatiously displayed of his superior merit. The praeceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance, that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary: the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed: he se∣cretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist, and gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of his style, the most laborious of his domestic pupils <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Libanius, Orat.

The emperor's prepossession was encreased and justified by the discreet pride of his favourite. Instead of pressing, with the foremost of the crowd, into

Julian might disdain the acclamations of a venal court, who adored the Imperial pur∣ple; but he was deeply flattered by the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent philosopher, who refused his favours, loved his person, celebrated his fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of Libanius still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator, who cultivated the science of words; the productions of a recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his contemporaries, was in∣cessantly fixed on the Trojan war, and the Athe∣nian commonwealth.

The son of one of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea, who had embraced, either from interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was disinherited by his angry parent. The father and the son were invited to the Imperial table. Julian, placing himself between them, attempted, without suc∣cess, to inculcate the lesson and example of tole∣ration; supported, with affected calmness, the indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian, who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature, and the duty of a subject; and, at length turning towards the afflicted youth, <Q>Since you have lost a father, said he, for my sake, it is incumbent on me to supply his place <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Julian alludes to this incident (epist. xxvii.), which is more distinctly related by Theodoret (l. iii. c. 22.).

In the hurry of military preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar corre∣spondence, the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform.

The emperor detached an army of thirty thou∣sand men, under the command of his kinsman Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy, be∣fore they attempted the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were left to the dis∣cretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene, they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon about the same time, that he himself, advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates, should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy. The success of this well-concerted plan depended, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Disaffec∣tion of the king of Armenia.</NOTE> a great measure, on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of Armenia, who, with∣out exposing the safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four thousand horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of the Romans <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">See Xenophon.

He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose hands he had received in marriage Olym∣pias, the daughter of the praefect Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of a Barbarian king <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xx. 11.

From thence the emperor pursued his march, above ninety miles, along the winding stream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered the towers of Cir∣cesium, the extreme limit of the Roman domi∣nions. The army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Per∣sia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces; and a just pre-eminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince.

The rest of the ships, partly constructed of tim∣ber, and partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and provisions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers, but he prohibited the indul∣gence of wine; and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army.

He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the Persians; and he exhorted them to imitate his firm reso∣lution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation, or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a do∣native of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly cut away, to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs.

He was a Persian prince, of the royal race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great Constantine. Hormisdas, at first, excited the compassion, and, at length, acquired the esteem, of his new mas∣ters; his valour and fidelity raised him to the military honours of the Roman service; and, though a Christian, he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country, that an oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy. Such was the disposition of the three principal columns. The front and
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
flanks of the army were covered by Lucillianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred light∣armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any hostile approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene, conducted the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage, securely, proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of use or osten∣tation, were formed in such open order, that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles. The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column; but as he preferred the du∣ties of a general to the state of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light ca∣valry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which they traversed from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Assyria, may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren waste, which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry. Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and which is described by one of the companions of his expedition, the sage and heroic Xenophon <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">See the first book of the Anabasis, p. 45, 46.

stop the march of a Roman emperor; till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of prince Hormisdas, and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army. They implored, and experienced, the clemency of Julian; who transplanted the people to an ad∣vantageous settlement, near Chalcis in Syria, and admitted Pusaeus, the governor, to an ho∣nourable rank in his service and friendship. But the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could scorn the menace of a siege; and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting pro∣mise, that when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia, Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the conqueror. The inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist, and unwilling to yield, fled with preci∣pitation; and their houses, filled with spoil and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Ju∣lian, who massacred, without remorse, and with∣out punishment, some defenceless women.

The uses of these artificial canals were various and important. They served to discharge the superfluous waters from one river into the other, at the season of their respec∣tive inundations. Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed the dry lands, and supplied the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the intercourse of peace and commerce; and, as the dams could be speedily broke down, they armed the despair of the Assy∣rians with the means of opposing a sudden de∣luge to the progress of an invading army.

three hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit, were skilfully applied. Several manufac∣tures, especially those of leather and linen, em∣ployed the industry of a numerous people, and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade; which appears, however, to have been conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylon had been converted into a royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had successively arisen, and the populousness of the country was displayed in the multitude of towns and villages, which were built of bricks, dried in the sun, and strongly cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian soil. While the successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia, the province of Assyria alone maintained, during a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great King. Four considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were con∣stantly kept, at the expence of the country, for the royal stables: and as the daily tribute, which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one English bushel of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Assyria yielded to the Persian satrap, an <HI>Artaba</HI> of silver each day. The well-known proportion of weights and measures (see Bishop Hooper's elaborate Inquiry), the specific gravity of water and silver, and the value of that metal, will afford, after a short process, the annual revenue which I have stated. Yet the Great King re∣ceived no more than 1000 Euboic, or Tyrian, talents (252,000l.) from Assyria. The comparison of two passages in Herodotus (l. i. c. 192. l. iii. c. 89-96.) reveals an important difference between the <HI>gross,</HI> and the <HI>net,</HI> revenue of Persia; the sums paid by the province, and the gold or silver deposited in the royal treasure.

The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war; and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine <NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Assyria, A. D. 363. May.</NOTE> and cruelty, which had been committed by their haughty master in the Roman provinces. The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their assistance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their country. The roads were ren∣dered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries, who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader. The damage was gradually repaired; the waters were restored to their proper channels; whole groves of palm-trees were cut down, and placed along the bro∣ken parts of the road; and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals, on bridges of float∣ing rafts, which were supported by the help of bladders. Two cities of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty miles from the royal resi∣dence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Perisabor,</NOTE> of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, or Anbar, held
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
the second rank in the province: a city, large, populous, and well fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the valour of a numerous garrison. The exhortations of Hor∣misdas were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country. The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well as vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram, having opened a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of the wall, they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town, and, after the full gratification of every military appetite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses. The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and cata∣pultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged. But as soon as an <HI>Helepolis</HI> had been constructed, which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of resistance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission; and the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first ap∣peared
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
under the walls of Perisabor. Two thou∣sand five hundred persons, of both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were per∣mitted to retire: the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the troops, and partly reserved for the public service: the useless stores were destroyed by fire, or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor.</P>
<P>The city, or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, <NOTE PLACE="marg">of Maoga∣malcha.</NOTE> which was defended by sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been con∣structed at the distance of eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of Persia. The emperor, apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear, immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was distri∣buted, for that purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head of the cavalry, and of a de∣tachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the country, as far as the banks of the Ti∣gris, and the suburbs of Ctesiphon. The con∣duct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself, who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls; while he secretly contrived a more effica∣cious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Ne∣vitta and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a considerable distance, and gradually pro∣longed as far as the edge of the ditch. The
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the incessant labour of the troops, a mine was car∣ried under the foundations of the walls, and sus∣tained, at sufficient intervals, by props of tim∣ber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a sin∣gle file, silently explored the dark and danger∣ous passage; till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence, that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city. Julian checked their ardour, that he might ensure their success; and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison, by the tumult and clamour of a general assault. The Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously beheld the pro∣gress of an impotent attack, celebrated, with songs of triumph, the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Mao∣gamalcha. The city was already taken. History has recorded the name of a private soldier, the first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower. The passage was widened by his com∣panions, who pressed forwards with impatient valour. Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city. The astonished gar∣rison abandoned the walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre. The governor, who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of hav∣ing uttered some disrespectful words against the honour of Prince Hormisdas. The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a vestige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The neighbourhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved, according to the Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and spa∣cious parks were inclosed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were main∣tained at a considerable expence for the pleasure of the royal chace. The park-walls were broke down, the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occasion, shewed him∣self ignorant, or careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have established between hostile princes. Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resent∣ment. A simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian artist, is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of Barbaric labour: and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace, than by the con∣flagration of a cottage, our humanity must have

With the same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love, he sustained the hard∣ships of war. When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country, their sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared their fa∣tigues, and animated their diligence. In every useful labour, the hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty, as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier. The two sieges allowed him some re∣markable opportunities of signalising his personal valour, which, in the improved state of the mi∣litary art, can seldom be exerted by a prudent general. The emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his extreme danger, and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron, till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons, and huge stones, that were directed against his person. As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha, two Persians, devoting themselves for their country, suddenly rushed upon him with drawn scimitars: the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield; and,
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
with a steady and well-aimed thrust, laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet. The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he ap∣proves, is the noblest recompence of a deserving subject; and the authority which Julian derived from his personal merit, enabled him to revive and enforce the rigour of ancient discipline.

His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language of a Roman. <Q>Riches are the object of your desires? those riches are in the hands of the Persians; and the spoils of this fruitful country are proposed as the prize of your valour and discipline.

For myself, the only inheritance that I have received from my royal ancestors, is a soul incapable of fear; and as long as I am convinced that every real advan∣tage is seated in the mind, I shall not blush to acknowledge an honourable poverty, which, in the days of ancient virtue, was considered as the glory of Fabricius.

<P>The successful valour of Julian had triumphed <NOTE PLACE="marg">He trans∣ports his fleet from the Eu∣phrates to the Ti∣gris.</NOTE> over all the obstacles that opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon.

He is a gentleman and a scholar, but intolerably vain and prolix.</NOTE>. Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad, and on the eastern bank of the Tigris, the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of the palaces of Ctesiphon, which, in the time of Julian, was a great and populous city. The name and glory of the ad∣jacent Seleucia were for ever extinguished; and the only remaining quarter of that Greek colony had resumed, with the Assyrian language and manners, the primitive appellation of Coche.
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
Coche was situate on the western side of the Ti∣gris; but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats. The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain, THE CITIES, which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of the Sassanides; and the whole cir∣cumference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by impracticable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was fixed; and secured, by a ditch and rampart, against the sal∣lies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and pleasant country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage: and several forts, which might have em∣barrassed the motions of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their valour. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an arti∣ficial derivation of that river, which pours a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris, at a small distance <HI>below</HI> the great city. If they had followed this royal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">The royal canal <HI>(Nahar-Malcha)</HI> might be successively restored, altered, divided, &amp;c. (Cellarius, Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 453.): and these changes may serve to explain the seeming con∣tradictions of antiquity. In the time of Julian, it must have fallen into the Euphrates <HI>below</HI> Ctesiphon.</NOTE>, the intermediate situ∣ation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris, and
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital, must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy. The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and pro∣vided the remedy. As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country, he soon recollected, that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal, which, leav∣ing Coche on the right-hand, conveyed the waters of the Nahar-Malcha into the river Ti∣gris, at some distance <HI>above</HI> the cities. From the information of the peasants, Julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design or accident. By the indefatigable labour of the soldiers, a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the recep∣tion of the Euphrates. A strong dike was con∣structed to interrupt the ordinary current of the Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters rushed impe∣tuously into their new bed; and the Roman fleet, steering their triumphant course into the Tigris, derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage.</P>
<P>As it became necessary to transport the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">Passage of the Tigris, and vic∣tory of the Romans.</NOTE> army over the Tigris, another labour presented itself, of less toil, but of more danger, than the preceding expedition. The stream was broad and rapid; the ascent steep and difficult; and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank, were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirassiers, dextrous
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
archers, and huge elephants; who (according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius) could trample, with the same ease, a field of corn, or a legion of Romans <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Rien n'est beau que le vrai; a maxim which should be inscribed on the desk of every rhetorician.</NOTE>. In the presence of such an enemy, the construction of a bridge was im∣practicable; and the intrepid prince, who instantly seized the only possible expedient, concealed his design, till the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the Barbarians, of his own troops, and even of his generals themselves. Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines, fourscore vessels were gradually un∣laden; and a select detachment, apparently des∣tined for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games, which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was past, the emperor summoned the generals to his tent; and acquainted them, that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris. They stood in silent and respectful astonishment; but, when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his pru∣dent

I have ventured to name <HI>Sallust.</HI> Ammianus says, of all the leaders, quòd aeri metû territi duces concordi precatû fieri prohibere tentarent.</NOTE>. Julian contented himself with observing, that conquest and safety depended on the attempt; that, instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies would be increased, by successive reinforcements; and that a longer de∣lay would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the height of the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed: the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank; and, as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they were lost, after a few moments, in the darkness of the night. A flame arose on the opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood that his fore∣most vessels, in attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory. <Q>Our fellow-soldiers, he eagerly exclaimed, are already masters of the bank; see—they make the appointed signal: let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage.</Q> The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames, and rescue their adventurous com∣panions. The difficulties of a sleep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armour, and the darkness of the night. A shower of stones, darts, and fire, was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants; who, after an
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
arduous struggle, climbed the bank, and stood victorious upon the rampart. As soon as they possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with his light-infantry, had led the attack <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Hinc Imperator . . .

The whole en∣gagement lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful ex∣ample was given by the principal leaders, and the Surenas himself.

While the Persians beheld

His expectations were disappointed by the trea∣chery of the Armenian king, who permitted, and most probably directed, the desertion of his auxi∣liary troops from the camp of the Romans <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Moses of Chorene (Hist.

When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this important reinforce∣ment, he condescended to hold a council of war, and approved, after a full debate, the sentiment of those generals, who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon, as a fruitless and pernicious under∣taking. It is not easy for us to conceive, by what arts of fortification, a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian, could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans, commanded by a brave and experienced general, and abundantly supplied
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
with ships, provisions, battering engines, and military stores. But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obsta∣cles <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Civitas inexpugnabilis, facinus audax et importunum.

Under the pretence of private busi∣ness, a minister of rank and confidence was se∣cretly dispatched to embrace the knees of Hor∣misdas, and to request, in the language of a sup∣pliant, that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor. The Sassanian prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or hu∣manity, whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or the duties of his situation, was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure, which would terminate the calamities of Persia, and secure the triumph of Rome. He was asto∣nished by the inflexible firmness of a hero, who remembered, most unfortunately for himself, and for his country, that Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius. But as Ju∣lian was sensible, that the hope of a safe and honourable peace might cool the ardour of his troops; he earnestly requested, that Hormisdas would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Libanius, Orat.

replied, that if he desired to exercise his valour, he might seek the army of the Great King. He felt the insult, and he accepted the advice. In∣stead of confining his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris, he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for the empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed, by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of his country, had generously sub∣mitted to act a part full of danger, of falsehood, and of shame <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">The arts of this new Zopyrus (Greg.

Parent. c. 134. p. 357.) and Ammianus (xxiv. 7.). The course of genuine history is interrupted by a most un∣seasonable chasm in the text of Ammianus,</NOTE>. With a train of faithful fol∣lowers, he deserted to the Imperial camp; ex∣posed, in a specious tale, the injuries which he had sustained; exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent of the people, and the weakness of the monarchy, and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational grounds of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and expe∣rience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor into his bosom, was per∣suaded to issue an hasty order, which, in the opi∣nion of mankind, appeared to arraign his pru∣dence, and to endanger his safety. He destroyed, in a single hour, the whole navy, which had been
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
transported above five hundred miles, at so great an expence of toil, of treasure, and of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two, small ves∣sels were saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the army, and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers. A supply of twenty days provisions was reserved for the use of the soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were abandoned to the flames, by the absolute command of the em∣peror. The Christian bishops, Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness of the apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the sentence of divine justice. Their authority, of less weight, perhaps, in a military question, is confirmed by the cool judgment of an experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant mur∣murs of the troops <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">See Ammianus (xxiv. 7.), Libanius (Orat.

The power of sails or oars was insufficient; it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river; the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labour; and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of the Tigris, they could only expect to return home without atchieving any enterprize worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader. If, on the contrary, it was adviseable to advance into the inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might sud∣denly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon.

Yet, in every age, the subsistence of sixty thousand men must have been one of the most important cares of a prudent general; and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the enemy's country.

The extensive region that lies between the river Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled with villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part, was in a very improved state of

cultivation. Julian might expect, that a con∣queror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily pro∣cure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or ava∣rice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, this rich and smiling prospect was in∣stantly blasted. Wherever they moved, the in∣habitants deserted the open villages, and took shelter in the fortified towns; the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were con∣sumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual me∣thod of defence, can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their inde∣pendence to their property; or by the rigour of an arbitrary government, which consults the pub∣lic safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice. On the present occasion, the zeal and obedience of the Persians seconded the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions, which continually wasted in his hands. Before they were entirely consumed, he might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ec∣batana, or Susa, by the effort of a rapid and well∣directed march <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">Isidore of Charax (Mansion.

The Romans wan∣dered several days in the country to the eastward of Bagdad: the Persian deserter, who had art∣fully led them into the snare, escaped from their resentment; and his followers, as soon as they were put to the torture, confessed the secret of the conspiracy. The visionary conquests of Hyr∣cania and India, which had so long amused, now tormented, the mind of Julian. Conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress, he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success, without obtaining a satis∣factory answer either from gods or men. At length, as the only practicable measure, he em∣braced the resolution of directing his steps to∣wards the banks of the Tigris, with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to the con∣fines of Corduene; a fertile and friendly pro∣vince, which acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.

<P>As long as the Romans seemed to advance <NOTE PLACE="marg">Retreat and distress of the Ro∣man army.</NOTE> into the country, their march was observed and insulted from a distance, by several bodies of Persian cavalry; who shewing themselves, some∣times in loose, and sometimes in closer, or∣der,

faintly skirmished with the advanced guards. These detachments were, however, supported by a much greater force; and the heads of the co∣lumns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris, than a cloud of dust arose on the plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves, that this formidable appear∣ance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole night in continual alarms; and discovered, at the dawn of day, that they were surrounded by an army of Persians. This army, which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarians, was soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers, archers, and ele∣phants, commanded by Meranes, a general of rank and reputation. He was accompanied by two of the king's sons, and many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself. As the Romans continued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend, or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, afforded frequent and favourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies. The Persians repeat∣edly charged with fury; they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness; and the action at Ma∣ronga, which almost deserved the name of a bat∣tle, was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes

of their monarch. These splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded; and the emperor himself, who, on all occasions of danger, inspired and guided the valour of his troops, was obliged to expose his person, and exert his abilities. The weight of offensive and defensive arms, which still constituted the strength and safety of the Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit; and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their javelins, and shoot their arrows, at full speed, and in every possible direction <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Chardin, the most judicious of modern travellers, describes (tom. iii. p. 57, 58, &amp;c. edit. in 4. to.) the education and dexterity of the Persian horsemen.

The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but he snatched a shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with a sufficient reinforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front; and, as he galloped between the columns, the centre of the left was attacked, and almost overpowered, by a furious charge of the Persian cavalry and elephants. This huge body was soon defeated, by the well-timed

evolution of the light infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, against the backs of the horsemen, and the legs of the elephants. The Barbarians fled; and Julian, who was foremost in every danger, animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures. His trem∣bling guards, scattered and oppressed by the dis∣orderly throng of friends and enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without ar∣mour; and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin. As they exclaimed <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot">Clamabant hinc inde <HI>candidati</HI> (see the note of Valesius) quos disjecerat terror, ut fugientium molem tanquam ruinam male com∣positi culminis declinaret.

Julian attempt∣ed to draw the deadly weapon from his side; but his fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel, and he fell senseless from his horse. His guards flew to his relief; and the wounded em∣peror was gently raised from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent.

But the royal race of Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the Ro∣mans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural presump∣tion of health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death left the empire without a mas∣ter, and without an heir, in a state of perplexity and danger, which, in the space of fourscore years, had never been experienced, since the elec∣tion of Diocletian. In a government, which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and no∣ble blood, the superiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank were acci∣dental and precarious; and the candidates, who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne, could be supported only by the consciousness of per∣sonal merit, or by the hopes of popular favour. But the situation of a famished army, encom∣passed
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
on all sides by an host of Barbarians, shortened the moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of terror and distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his own direc∣tions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals convened a military senate, at which the commanders of the legions, and the officers, both of cavalry and infantry, were in∣vited to assist. Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals; and when the election of an emperor was pro∣posed, the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected the remains of the court of Constantius; the friends of Julian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the dis∣cord of two factions, so opposite in their cha∣racter and interest, in their maxims of govern∣ment, and perhaps in their religious principles. The superior virtues of Sallust could alone recon∣cile their divisions, and unite their suffrages; and the venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the successor of Julian, if he him∣self, with sincere and modest firmness, had not alleged his age and infirmities, so unequal to the weight of the diadem. The generals, who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal, shewed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot">Honoratior aliquis miles; perhaps Ammianus himself.

The tumultuary acclamation was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the extremities of the line.

for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful tem∣per, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his fellow-soldiers; and the generals of both par∣ties acquiesced in a popular election, which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies. The pride of this unexpected elevation was mo∣derated by the just apprehension, that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor. The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay; and the first orders issued by Jovian, a few hours after his predecessor had expired, were to prosecute a march, which could alone extricate the Romans from their actual distress <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxx. 10.) has drawn from the life an impartial portrait of Jovian: to which the younger Victor has added some re∣markable strokes.

The battle was at length restored by the per∣severing valour of the Romans; the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants; and the army, after marching and fighting a long summer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara on the banks of the Tigris, about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">The obscure villages of the inland country are irrecoverably lost, nor can we name the field of battle where Julian fell: but M. d'Anville has demonstrated the precise situation of Sumere, Carche, and Dura, along the banks of the Tigris (Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 248. l'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 95. 97.).

The Tigris was still on their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves, that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their new sovereign, that they might be permitted to hazard the pas∣sage of the river. With the assistance of his wisest officers, Jovian endeavoured to check their rashness; by representing, that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigour to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream, they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Bar∣barians, who had occupied the opposite banks. Yielding at length to their clamorous importu∣nities, he consented, with reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the army. In the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris, sur∣prised an unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune.

The transient presumption of Sapor had vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his bravest troops, and the greatest part of his train of ele∣phants: and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire; which might soon advance to relieve, or to revenge, the successor of Julian.

The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council, and the cries of the soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; and the praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with the general Arinthaeus, to understand the pleasure of the Great King. The crafty Persian delayed, under various pre∣tences, the conclusion of the agreement; started difficulties, required explanations, suggested ex∣pedients, receded from his concessions, encreased his demands, and wasted four days in the arts of negociation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been capable of exe∣cuting a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued his march with unremitting dili∣gence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Cor∣duene, at the distance only of one hundred miles <NOTE N="110" PLACE="foot">It is presumptuous to controvert the opinion of Ammianus, a soldier and a spectator.

Singara, and the castle of the Moors one of the strongest places of Meso∣potamia, were likewise dismembered from the empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted, that the Romans should for ever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia.

If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia, the Orontes, the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus, flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid monarch, that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury <NOTE N="112" PLACE="foot">Libanius, Orat.

Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East; whose clemency had pardoned the in∣vaders of his country. The Saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march; but the generals and troops of Sapor respected the cessa∣tion of arms; and Jovian was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river. The small vessels, which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet, performed the most essential service. They first conveyed the emperor and his favourites; and afterwards tran∣sported, in many successive voyages, a great part of the army. But, as every man was anxious for his personal safety, and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hur∣dles, or inflated skins; and, drawing after them their horses, attempted, with various success, to swim across the river. Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice, or cruelty, of the wild Arabs: and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle.

They were obliged to traverse a sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a single blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water; and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friends or enemies.

<P>THE death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous situation. The Roman army was <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the church, A. D. 363.</NOTE> saved by an inglorious, perhaps a necessary, treaty <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The medals of Jovian adorn him with victories, laurel crowns, and prostrate captives. Ducange, Famil. Byzantin. p. 52. Flattery is a foolish suicide: she destroys herself with her own hands.</NOTE>; and the first moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic tranquillity of the church and state. The indiscretion of his predecessor, instead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious war: and the balance which he affected to pre∣serve between the hostile factions, served only to perpetuate the contest, by the vicissitudes of hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favour. The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the Gospel; and the Pa∣gans had imbibed the spirit of the church. In private families, the sentiments of nature were
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and re∣venge: the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the cities of the East were stained with blood; and the most implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their country. Jovian was educated in the profession of Chris∣tianity; and as he marched from Nisibis to An∣tioch, the banner of the Cross, the LABARUM of Constantine, which was again displayed at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of their new emperor. As soon as he as∣cended the throne, he transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces: in which he confessed the divine truth, and secured the legal establishment, of the Christian religion. The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished; the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged; and Jovian condescended to lament, that the distress of the times obliged him to di∣minish the measure of charitable distributions <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Jovian restored to the church <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; a forcible and comprehensive expression (Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 5. with Gode∣froy's Dissertations, p. 329. Sozomen, l. vi. c. 3.). The new law which condemned the rape or marriage of nuns (Cod. Theod. l. ix. tit. xxv. leg. 2.), is exaggerated by Sozomen; who supposes, that an amorous glance, the adultery of the heart, was punished with death by the evangelic legislator.</NOTE>. The Christians were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious successor of Julian. But they were still ignorant, what creed, or what synod, he would chuse for the standard of orthodoxy; and the peace of the church immediately revived those
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
eager disputes which had been suspended during the season of persecution. The episcopal leaders of the contending sects, convinced, from expe∣rience, how much their fate would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier, hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch. The highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and Semi-Arian, and Eunomian bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other in the holy race: the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamours; and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps astonished, by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Compare Socrates, l. iii. c. 25. and Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 6. with Godefroy's Dissertations, p. 330.</NOTE>. The moderation of Jovian, who recommended concord and charity, and referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council, was interpreted as a symptom of indif∣ference: but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at length discovered and declared, by the reverence which he expressed for the <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>caelestial</HI> faintly expresses the impious and extravagant slattery of the emperor to the archbishop, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

The venerable figure of Athanasius, his calm courage, and in∣sinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation which he had already acquired in the courts of four successive princes <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Athanasius, at the court of Antioch, is agreeably represented by La Bleterie (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 121—148.): he trans∣lates the singular and original conferences of the emperor, the pri∣mate of Egypt, and the Arian deputies. The Abbé is not satisfied with the coarse pleasantry of Jovian; but his partiality for Atha∣nasius assumes, in <HI>his</HI> eyes, the character of justice.</NOTE>.

The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the natural descent of its object, ope∣rates with irresistible weight; and Jovian had the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jovian proclaims universal toleration.</NOTE> good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were supported by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and numbers of the most powerful sect <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Athanasius (apud Theodoret, l. iv. c. 3.) magnifies the num∣ber of the orthodox, who composed the whole world, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

Under his reign, Christianity obtained an easy and lasting victory; and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn, the ge∣nius of paganism, which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts of Julian, sunk irre∣coverably in the dust. In many cities, the temples were shut or deserted; the philosophers, who had abused their transient favour, thought it prudent to shave their beards, and disguise their profes∣sion; and the Christians rejoiced, that they were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries which they had suffered under the pre∣ceding reign <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Socrates, l. iii. c. 24. Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. iv. p. 131.), and Libanius (Orat. Parentalis, c. 148. p. 369.), express the <HI>living</HI> sentiments of their respective factions.</NOTE>. The consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration; in which Jovian explicitly declar∣ed, that although he should severely punish the sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might exercise, with freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient worship. The memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius, who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
to express their loyal devotion for the new empe∣ror. Themistius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the rights of conscience, and the independence of the mind; and, with some eloquence, inculcates the principles of philosophical toleration; whose aid Superstition herself, in the hour of her distress, is not ashamed to implore. He justly observes, that, in the recent changes, both religions had been alternately disgraced by the seeming acqui∣sition of worthless proselytes, of those votaries of the reigning purple, who could pass, without a reason, and without a blush, from the church to the temple, and from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Themistius, Orat. v. p. 63—71. edit.

<P>In the space of seven months, the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">His pro∣gress from Antioch, A. D. 363.

He was impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople; and to prevent the ambition of some competitor, who might oc∣cupy the vacant allegiance of Europe. But he soon received the grateful intelligence, that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic ocean. By the first letters which he dispatched from the camp of Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks; and to his father-in-law, count Lucil∣lian, who had formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis. Mala∣rich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal; and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims, in an accidental mutiny of the Bata∣vian cohorts <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Compare Ammianus (xxv. 10.), who omits the name of the Batavians, with Zosimus (l. iii. p. 197.), who removes the scene of action from Rheims to Sirmium.</NOTE>.

Her disappointment and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness. Six weeks before the death of Jovian, his infant son had been placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of <HI>Nobilissimus,</HI> and the vain ensigns of the consulship. Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his grandfather, assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by the jealousy of the government, that he was the son of an emperor.

In a solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire, the diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust. He enjoyed the glory of a se∣cond refusal; and when the virtues of the father were alleged in favour of his son, the praefect, with the firmness of a disinterested patriot, de∣clared to the electors, that the feeble age of the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several candidates were proposed: and, after weighing the objections of character or situation, they were successively rejected: but, as soon as the name of Valentinian was pronoun∣ced, the merit of that officer united the suffrages
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
of the whole assembly, and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself. Valentinian <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxx. 7. 9.), and the younger Victor, have fur∣nished the portraits of Valentinian; which naturally precedes and illustrates the history of his reign.</NOTE> was the son of count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Election and cha∣racter of Valenti∣nian.</NOTE> in Pannonia, who, from an obscure condition, had raised himself, by matchless strength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and Britain; from which he retired, with an am∣ple fortune and suspicious integrity. The rank and services of Gratian contributed, however, to smooth the first steps of the promotion of his son; and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications, which raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers. The person of Va∣lentinian was tall, graceful, and majestic. His manly countenance, deeply marked with the im∣pression of sense and spirit, inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear: and, to second the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of Gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution. By the habits of chastity and temperance, which restrain the appetites, and invigorate the faculties, Valen∣tinian preserved his own, and the public, esteem. The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature; he was ignorant of the Greek language, and the arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion prompted him,
<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution. The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied; and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence, and inflexible severity, with which he discharged and inforced the duties of the camp. In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of dis∣grace, by the contempt which he publicly ex∣pressed for the reigning religion <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">At Antioch, where he was obliged to attend the emperor to the temple, he struck a priest, who had presumed to purify him with lustral water (Sozomen, l. vi. c. 6.

Such public defiance might become Valentinian; but it could leave no room for the unworthy delation of the philosopher Maximus, which supposes some more private offence (Zosimus, l. iv. p. 200, 201.).</NOTE>; and it should seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the in∣discreet and unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit, rather than of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Socrates, l. iv.

In the march from Antioch, he had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly summoned, without guilt, and without intrigue, to assume,

The aged Sallust, who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of popular assemblies, proposed, un∣der pain of death, that none of those persons, whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favour, should appear in public, on the day of the inauguration. Yet such was the preva∣lence of ancient superstition, that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous inter∣val, because it happened to be the intercalation of the Bissextile <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, in a long, because unseasonable, digression (xxvi. 1. and Valesius ad locum), rashly supposes that he understands an astronomical question, of which his readers are ignorant.

At length, when the hour was supposed to be propitious, Valentinian shew∣ed himself from a lofty tribunal: the judicious choice was applauded; and the new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the pur∣ple, amidst the acclamations of the troops, who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal. But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude, a busy whisper was acci∣dentally started in the ranks, and insensibly swell∣ed into a loud and imperious clamour, that he should name, without delay, a colleague in the

The intrepid calmness of Valentinian obtained silence, and commanded respect: and he thus addressed the assembly; <Q>A few mi∣nutes since it was in <HI>your</HI> power, fellow-sol∣diers, to have left me in the obscurity of a private station.

In the castle or palace of Mediana, only three miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xxvi. 5.</NOTE>.

The provincial administration remained on its former basis; but a double supply of gene∣rals and magistrates was required for two coun∣cils, and two courts: the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation, and seven master-generals were soon created, either of the cavalry or infantry. When this important business had been amicably transacted, Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time. The emperor of the West established his temporary residence at Milan; and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople, to assume

Pro∣copius had been hastily promoted from the ob∣scure station of a tribune, and a notary, to the joint command of the army of Mesopotamia; the public opinion already named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural heirs; and a vain rumour was propagated by his friends, or his enemies, that Julian, before the altar of the Moon, at Carrhae, had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxiii. 3. xxvi. 6.

of Cappadocia. These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer, with a band of soldiers, who, in the name of his new sovereigns, Valentinian and Va∣lens, was dispatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius, either to a perpetual prison, or an ignominious death. His presence of mind pro∣cured him a longer respite, and a more splendid fate. Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he requested the indulgence of a few moments, to embrace his weeping family; and, while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the sea-coast of the Euxine, from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus. In that sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to the hardships of exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes, and his mind agitated by the just apprehension, that, if any accident should discover his name, the faithless Barbarians would violate, without much scruple, the laws of ho∣spitality. In a moment of impatience and despair, Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel, which made sail for Constantinople; and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign, because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject. At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia, con∣tinually changing his habitation, and his dis∣guise <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">One of his retreats was a country-house of Eunomius, the he∣retic.

By degrees he ventured into the capi∣tal,
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a senator and an eunuch, and con∣ceived some hopes of success, from the intel∣ligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs. The body of the people was in∣fected with a spirit of discontent: they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East. They despised the character of Valens, which was rude without vigour, and feeble without mildness. They dreaded the in∣fluence of his father-in-law, the Patrician Pe∣tronius, a cruel and rapacious minister, who ri∣gorously exacted all the arrears of tribute, that might remain unpaid since the reign of the em∣peror Aurelian. The circumstances were pro∣pitious to the designs of an usurper. The hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens in Syria: from the Danube to the Eu∣phrates the troops were in motion; and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed, or repassed, the Thracian Bosphorus. Two cohorts of Gauls were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators; which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative; and, as they still revered the memory of Julian, they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple garment, more suitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared, as if he rose from the
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
dead, in the midst of Constantinople. The sol∣diers, who were prepared for his reception, saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy, and vows of fidelity. Their numbers were soon increased by a sturdy band of peasants, collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, shielded by the arms of his adherents, was suc∣cessively conducted to the tribunal, the senate, and the palace. During the first moments of his tumultuous reign, he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people; who were either ignorant of the cause, or apprehensive of the event. But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance: the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion; the poor were ex∣cited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage; and the ob∣stinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revo∣lution. The magistrates were seized; the prisons and arsenals broke open; the gates, and the entrance of the harbour, were diligently occupied; and, in a few hours, Procopius became the ab∣solute, though precarious, master of the Imperial city. The usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the most favourable to his interest; while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors of distant nations. The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace, and the fortresses of the Lower Danube, were gradually involved in the
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic princes con∣sented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries. His generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued, without an effort, the unarmed, but wealthy, provinces of Bithynia and Asia. After an honourable defence, the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculians embraced the cause of the usurper, whom they were order∣ed to crush; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he soon appeared at the head of an army, whose valour, as well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatness of the contest. The son of Hormisdas <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Hormisdae maturo juveni Hormisdae regalis illius filio, potes∣tatem Proconsulis detulit; et civilia, more veterum, et bella, rec∣turo. Ammian. xxvi. 8.

The alliance of Faustina, the widow of the emperor Constantius, who entrusted her∣self, and her daughter, to the hands of the usurper, added dignity and reputation to his cause. The princess Constantia, who was then about five years of age, accompanied, in a litter,

<P>In the mean while, Valentinian was alarmed <NOTE PLACE="marg">His defeat and death, A. D. 366. May 28.</NOTE> and perplexed, by the doubtful intelligence of the revolt of the East. The difficulties of a German war forced him to confine his imme∣diate care to the safety of his own dominions; and, as every channel of communication was stopt or corrupted, he listened, with a doubtful anxiety, to the rumours which were industriously spread; that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius sole master of the eastern pro∣vinces. Valens was not dead: but, on the news of the rebellion, which he received at Caesarea, he basely despaired of his life and fortune; pro∣posed to negociate with the usurper, and disco∣vered his secret inclination to abdicate the Im∣perial purple. The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon decided in his
<PB N="249" REF="256"/>
favour the event of the civil war. In a season of tranquillity, Sallust had resigned without a mur∣mur; but as soon as the public safety was at∣tacked, he ambitiously solicited the pre-eminence of toil and danger; and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the East, was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and satisfied the minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently support∣ed by powerful armies, and obedient provinces. But many of the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either by motives of duty or interest, to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene; or to watch the moment of betraying, and deserting, the cause of the usurper. Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens. Arin∣theus, who, in strength, beauty, and valour, ex∣celled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a superior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the soldiers who had served under his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice, to seize and deliver up their pre∣tended leader; and such was the ascendant of his genius, that this extraordinary order was in∣stantly obeyed <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Et dedignatus hominem superare certamine despicabilem, auc∣toritatis et celsi fiduciâ corporis, ipsis hostibus jussit, suum vincire rectorem: atque ita turmarum antesignanus umbratilis comprensus suorum manibus.

In the heat of action, calmly taking off his helmet, he shewed his grey hairs, and venerable countenance; sa∣luted the soldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of children and companions, and exhorted them, no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible tyrant; but to follow their old commander, who had so often led them to honour and victory.

After he be∣came master of the world, he unfortunately for∣got, that where no resistance can be made, no courage can be exerted; and instead of consult∣ing the dictates of reason and magnanimity, he in∣dulged the furious emotions of his temper, at a time when they were disgraceful to himself, and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure. In the government of his household, or of his empire, slight, or even imaginary, offences; a hasty word, a casual omission, an involuntary delay, were chastised by a sentence of immediate death. The expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were, "Strike off his head;" "burn him alive;" "let him be beaten with clubs till he expires" <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">He sometimes expressed a sentence of death with a tone of plea∣santry; <Q>Abi, Comes, et muta ei caput, qui sibi mutari provinciam cupit.</Q> A boy who had slipped too hastily a Spartan hound; an armourer, who had made a polished cuirass that wanted some grains of the legitimate weight, &amp;c. were the victims of his fury.</NOTE>; and his most favoured ministers soon understood, that, by a rash attempt, to dispute, or suspend, the execution of his san∣guinary commands, they might involve them∣selves in the guilt and punishment of disobe∣dience.

He could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death: he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose tem∣per was the most congenial to his own.

The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bed-chamber of Valen∣tinian, who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors, who were abandoned to their rage.

But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of Valens was not agitated by fear, or that of Valentinian by rage, the tyrant resumed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their laws and go∣vernment.</NOTE> the sentiments, or at least the conduct, of the fa∣ther of his country. The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive; and accurately pursue, his own and the public interest; and the sovereign of the East, who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother, was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust. Both princes invariably retained, in the purple, the chaste and tempe∣rate simplicity which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh. They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius; judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his successor; and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most fa∣vourable opinion of their character and govern∣ment. It is not from the master of <HI>Innocence,</HI> that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects, which prompted Valen∣tinian to condemn the exposition of new-born infants <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">See the Code of Justinian, l. viii. tit. lii. leg. 2.

The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly repre∣sent the school of Constantinople, which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations. That school consisted of thirty-one professors in different branches of learning. One philosopher, and two lawyers; five sophists, and ten gram∣marians for the Greek, and three orators, and ten grammarians for the Latin, tongue; besides seven scribes, or, as they were then styled, anti∣quarians, whose laborious pens supplied the pub∣lic library with fair and correct copies of the elassic writers.

The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts, or in the theatre; and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty. The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory, by stripes or expulsion; and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices, that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service. The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty: and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the <HI>Defen∣sors</HI> <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Cod.

The finances were dili∣gently administered by two princes, who had been so long accustomed to the rigid oeconomy of a private fortune; but in the receipt and ap∣plication of the revenue, a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West.

Under the reign of an apostate, he had signalized his zeal for the honour of Christianity: he allow∣ed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself; and they might accept, with gratitude and confidence, the general tole∣ration which was granted by a prince, addicted to passion, but incapable of fear or of disguise <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Testes sunt leges a me in exordio Imperii mei datae: quibus unicuique quod animo imbibisset colendi libera facultas tributa est.

The Pagans, the Jews, and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ, were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult; nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian, except those secret and criminal practices, which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder. The art of magic, as it was more cruelly punished, was more strictly proscribed; but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the senate, and exercised by the Tuscan haruspices. He had condemned, with the consent of the most rational Pagans, the licence of nocturnal sacrifices; but he imme∣ately admitted the petition of Praetextatus, pro∣consul

Philosophy alone can boast (and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy), that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the la∣tent and deadly principle of fanaticism. But this truce of twelve years, which was enforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valenti∣nian, by suspending the repetition of mutual in∣juries, contributed to soften the manners, and abate the prejudices, of the religious factions.</P>
<P>The friend of toleration was unfortunately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Valens professes Arianism, and perse∣cutes the catholics. A. D. 367—378.</NOTE> placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies. As soon as the Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini, they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy; and the small remains of the Arian party, that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan, might be considered, rather as objects of contempt than of resentment. But in the provinces of the East, from the Eux∣ine to the extremity of Thebais, the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced; and this equality, instead of recom∣mending the counsels of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war. The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives; and their invectives were some∣times followed by blows. Athanasius still reign∣ed at Alexandria; the thrones of Constantino∣ple
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates, and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult. The Homoousians were for∣tified by the reconciliation of fifty-nine Mace∣donian, or Semi-Arian, bishops; but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost, clouded the splendour of the triumph: and the declaration of Valens, who, in the first years of his reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother, was an important vic∣tory on the side of Arianism. The two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism, before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war. He naturally addressed himself to Eudox∣us <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Eudoxus was of a mild and timid disposition. When he baptized Valens (A. D. 367.), he must have been extremely old; since he had studied theology fifty-five years before, under Lucian, a learned and pious martyr.

Whatever had been the determination of the emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects; as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians be∣lieved, that, if they were not suffered to reign, they were most cruelly injured and oppressed.
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
After he had taken this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue, or the reputation, of impartiality. He never aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound theologian; but, as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Eudoxus, Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by the influence of his authority, the re-union of the <HI>Athanasian heretics</HI> to the body of the catholic church. At first, he pitied their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy; and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. xxv. p. 432.) insults the persecuting spirit of the Arians, as an infallible symptom of error and heresy.</NOTE>. The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favours the most readily granted in a despotic court. Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party; and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constan∣tinople, who, perhaps accidentally, were burnt on shipboard, was imputed to the cruel and pre∣meditated malice of the emperor, and his Arian ministers. In every contest, the catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults, and of those of their adversaries. In every election, the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and if they were opposed by the majority of the
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
people, he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors of a military force. The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his vene∣rable age; and his temporary retreat to his fa∣ther's sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile. But the zeal of a great people, who in∣stantly flew to arms, intimidated the praefect; and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of forty-seven years. The death of Athanasius was the signal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Athana∣sius, A. D. 373.

Damasus, bishop of Rome, was publicly read in the churches of the city. He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins; and menaced their dis∣obedience with the animadversion of the civil judge. The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his spiritual daughter: every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confis∣cated for the use of the treasury. By a subsequent regulation, it should seem, that the same pro∣visions were extended to nuns and bishops; and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts, and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance. As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue, Valentinian ap∣plied this severe remedy to the growing evil. In the capital of the empire, the females of no∣ble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property: and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity, not only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion. They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced, for the praise of chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal society. Some eccle∣siastic,
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
of real or apparent sanctity, was chosen to direct their timorous conscience, and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart: and the un∣bounded confidence, which they hastily bestowed, was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts; who hastened from the extremities of the East, to enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic profession. By their contempt of the world, they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages; the lively attachment, perhaps, of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an opulent household, and the respectful ho∣mage of the slaves, the freedmen, and the clients of a senatorial family. The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed, in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole place, in the testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed to declare, with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that <HI>he</HI> was only the instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor.

The eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague, was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs; and Valentinian himself was conscious, that the abilities of the most active
<PB N="277" REF="284"/>
mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy. As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the East, of the North, and of the South. Their inroads were often vexatious, and some∣times <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Perhaps the me∣thod of annals would more forcibly express the urgent and divided cares of the two emperors; but the attention of the reader, likewise, would be distracted by a tedious and desultory narrative.

national affront. The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of con∣tempt; and the martial youth crowded to their standard. Before Valentinian could pass the Alps, the villages of Gaul were in flames; before his general Dagalaiphus could encounter the Ale∣manni, they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of Germany. In the begin∣ning <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 366. January.</NOTE> of the ensuing year, the military force of the whole nation, in deep and solid columns, broke through the barrier of the Rhine, during the severity of a northern winter. Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded; and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors, who displayed, with insulting shouts and menaces, the trophy of their victory. The standard was recovered; but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge. It was the opinion of Valentinian, that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander, before they could cease to fear the enemy. The troops were solemnly assembled: and the trem∣bling Batavians were inclosed within the circle of the Imperial army. Valentinian then ascended his tribunal: and, as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death, he inflicted a stain of in∣delible ignominy on the officers, whose miscon∣duct and pusillanimity were found to be the first occasion of the defeat. The Batavians were de∣graded from their rank, stripped of their arms, and condemned to be sold for slaves to the
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
highest bidder. At this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground; deprecated the indignation of their sovereign; and protested, that, if he would indulge them in another trial, they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his soldiers. Valen∣tinian, with affected reluctance, yielded to their entreaties: the Batavians resumed their arms; and with their arms, the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxvii. 1.

Another division, or rather army, of the
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
enemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent country, reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle. Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general, made his silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans. Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were combing their long and flaxen hair; others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine. On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman trumpet; they saw the ene∣my in their camp. Astonishment produced dis∣order; disorder was followed by flight and dis∣may; and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and auxiliaries. The fugitives escaped to the third, and most considerable, camp, in the Catalaunian plains, near Chalons in Champagne: the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard; and the Bar∣barian chiefs, alarmed and admonished by the fate of their companions, prepared to encounter, in a decisive battle, the victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian. The bloody and ob∣stinate conflict lasted a whole summer's day, with equal valour, and with alternate success. The Romans at length prevailed, with the loss of about twelve hundred men. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four thousand were wound∣ed; and the brave Jovinus, after chacing the flying remnant of their host as far as the banks

<P>While the Alemanni appeared to be humbled by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Valentini∣an passes, and forti∣sies the Rhine, A.

In the unsuspicious moment of a Christian festival, Rando, a bold and artful chieftain, who had long meditated his attempt, suddenly passed the Rhine; entered the defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
captives of either sex. Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on the whole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, with the bands of Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, most probably on the side of Rhaetia. The emperor in person, accompanied by his son Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of a for∣midable army, which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus and Severus, the two masters∣general of the cavalry and infantry of the West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devastation of their villages, fixed their camp on a lofty, and almost inaccessible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and resolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The life of Valen∣tinian was exposed to imminent danger, by the intrepid curiosity with which he persisted to ex∣plore some secret and unguarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their ambuscade: and the emperor, who vigorously spurred his horse down a steep and slippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his armour-bearer, and his helmit, magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones. At the signal of the gene∣ral assault, the Roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium on three different sides. Every step which they gained, increased their ardour, and abated the resistance of the enemy: and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill, they impetu∣ously urged the Barbarians down the northern descent, where count Sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat.

An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine; and impatiently re∣quired the support and subsidies which Valentinian had promised: but they were amused with ex∣cuses and delays, till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they were compelled to retire. The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment; and their massacre of the captives served to embitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni. The inconstancy of a wise prince may, perhaps, be explained by some alteration of circumstances; and, perhaps, it was the ori∣ginal design of Valentinian to intimidate, rather than to destroy; as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation

Duchy of Sleswig, or perhaps of Holstein, was incapable of pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the ocean, who filled the British island with their language, their laws, and their colonies; and who so long defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">M. d'Anville (Etablissement des Etats de l'Europe, &amp;c. p. 19—26.) has marked the extensive limits of the Saxony of Char∣lemagne.</NOTE>. The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar man∣ners, and loose constitution, of the tribes of Ger∣many; which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship. The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates: and the success of their first adven∣tures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen, who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean, and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds. It should seem pro∣bable, however, that the most numerous auxili∣aries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic. They possessed arms and ships, the art of navigation, and the habits of naval war; but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercu∣les <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">The fleet of Drusus had failed in their attempt to pass, or even to approach, the <HI>Sound</HI> (styled, from an obvious resemblance, the co∣lumns of Hercules); and the naval enterprize was never resumed (Tacit. de Moribus German. c. 34.). The knowledge which the Romans acquired of the naval powers of the Baltic (c. 44, 45.), was obtained by their land journies in search of amber.</NOTE>
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
(which, during several months of the year, are obstructed with ice) confined their skill and courage within the limits of a spacious lake. The rumour of the successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe, would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sles∣wig, and to launch their vessels on the great sea. The various troops of pirates and adventurers, who fought under the same standard, were insen∣sibly united in a permanent society, at first of rapine, and afterward of government. A mi∣litary confederation was gradually moulded into a national body, by the gentle operation of mar∣riage and consanguinity; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the alliance, accepted the name and laws, of the Saxons. If the fact were not esta∣blished by the most unquestionable evidence, we should appear to abuse the credulity of our read∣ers, by the description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German Ocean, the British Channel, and the Bay of Biscay. The keel of their large flat∣bottomed boats was framed of light timber, but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot"><L>Qum et Aremoricus piratam <HI>Saxona</HI> tractus,—</L>

In the course of their slow and distant naviga∣tions, they must always have been exposed to the danger, and very frequently to the misfortune, of shipwreck; and the naval annals of the Sax∣ons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses, which they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul. But the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils, both of the sea, and of the shore: their skill was confirmed by the ha∣bits of enterprize; the meanest of their mariners was alike capable, of handling an oar, of rear∣ing a sail, or of conducting a vessel; and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which concealed their design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">The best original account of the Saxon pirates may be found in Sidonius Apollinaris (l. viii. epist. 6. p. 223. edit. Sirmond.), and the best commentary in the Abbé du Bos (Hist. Critique de la Monarchie Francoise, &amp;c. tom. i. l. i. c. 16. p. 148—155. See likewise p. 77, 78.).</NOTE>. After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the West, they extended the scene of their depredations, and the most sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security. The Saxon boats drew so little water, that they could easily proceed fourscore or an hundred miles up the great rivers; their weight was so inconsider∣able, that they were transported on waggons from one river to another; and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine, or of the
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
Rhine, might descend, with the rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterranean. Under the reign of Valentinian, the maritime provinces of Gaul were afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was stationed for the defence of the sea∣coast, or Armorican limit; and that officer, who found his strength, or his abilities, unequal to the task, implored the assistance of Severus, master-general of the infantry. The Saxons, surrounded and out-numbered, were forced to relinquish their spoil, and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies. They stipulated only a safe and honourable retreat: and the condition was readily granted by the Roman general; who me∣ditated an act of perfidy <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Ammian (xxviii. 5.) justifies this breach of faith to pirates and robbers; and Orosius (l. vii. c. 32.) more clearly expresses their real guilt; virtute atque agilitate terribiles.</NOTE>, imprudent as it was inhuman, while a Saxon remained alive, and in arms, to revenge the fate of his countrymen. The premature eagerness of the infantry, who were secretly posted in a deep valley, betrayed the ambuscade; and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery, if a large body of cuirassiers, alarmed by the noise of the combat, had not hastily advanced to extri∣cate their companions, and to overwhelm the undaunted valour of the Saxons. Some of the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword, to shed their blood in the amphitheatre: and the orator Symmachus complains, that twenty-nine of those desperate savages, by strangling them∣selves

former were the men of the hills, and the latter those of the plain. The eastern coast of Cale∣donia may be considered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a rude state of tillage, was capable of producing a considerable quantity of corn: and the epithet of <HI>cruitnich,</HI> or wheat∣eaters, expressed the contempt, or envy, of the carnivorous highlander. The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property, and the habits of a sedentary life; but the love of arms and rapine was still the rul∣ing passion of the Picts: and their warriors, who stripped themselves for a day of battle, were distinguished, in the eyes of the Romans, by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies, with gaudy colours and fantastic figures. The western part of Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills, which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle. The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters; and, as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired the ex∣pressive name of SCOTS, which, in the Celtic tongue, is said to be equivalent to that of <HI>wan∣derers,</HI> or <HI>vagrants.</HI> The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which in∣tersect their country, are plentifully stored with fish; and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean. The vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattered along the
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
western coast of Scotland, tempted their curiosity, and improved their skill; and they acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea, and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the well-known stars. The two bold headlands of Caledonia almost touch the shores of a spa∣cious island, which obtained, from its luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of <HI>Green;</HI> and has pre∣served, with a slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland. It is <HI>probable,</HI> that in some remote period of antiquity, the fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots; and that the strangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions, spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island. It is <HI>certain,</HI> that, in the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots; and that the kindred tribes, who were often associated in military enterprize, were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes. They long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin: and the missionaries of the Isle of Saints, who diffused the light of Christianity over North Bri∣tain, established the vain opinion, that their Irish countrymen were the natural, as well as spiritual, fathers of the Scottish race. The loose and ob∣scure tradition has been preserved by the vene∣rable Bede, who scattered some rays of light over the darkness of the eighth century. On this

slight foundation, an huge superstructure of fable was gradually reared, by the bards, and the monks; two orders of men, who equally abused the privilege of fiction. The Scottish nation, with mistaken pride, adopted their Irish genea∣logy: and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings have been adorned by the fancy of Boe∣thius, and the classic elegance of Buchanan <NOTE N="111" PLACE="foot">The Irish descent of the Scots has been revived, in the last moments of its decay, and strenuously supported, by the Rev.

<P>Every messenger who escaped across the British channel, conveyed the most melancholy and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Restora∣tion of Bri∣tain by Theodo∣sius, A.

Severus,
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
count of the domestics, was hastily dispatched, and as suddenly recalled, by the court of Treves. The representations of Jovinus served only to indicate the greatness of the evil; and, after a long and serious consultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of Britain, was entrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius. The ex∣ploits of that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age: but his real merit deserved their applause; and his no∣mination was received, by the army and province, as a sure presage of approaching victory. He seized the favourable moment of navigation, and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians and the Victors. In his march from Sandwich to Lon∣don, Theodosius defeated several parties of the Barbarians, released a multitude of captives, and, after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil, established the fame of disinterested justice, by the restitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors. The citizens of London, who had almost despaired of their safety, threw open their gates; and as soon as Theodosius had obtained from the court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant, and a civil governor, he executed, with wisdom and vigour, the labo∣rious task of the deliverance of Britain. The vagrant soldiers were recalled to their standard; an edict of amnesty dispelled the public appre∣hensions; and his cheerful example alleviated the
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
rigour of martial discipline. The scattered and desultory warfare of the Barbarians, who infested the land and sea, deprived him of the glory of a signal victory; but the prudent spirit, and con∣summate art, of the Roman general, were dis∣played in the operations of two campaigns, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The splendour of the cities, and the se∣curity of the fortifications, were diligently restor∣ed, by the paternal care of Theodosius: who with a strong hand confined the trembling Cale∣donians to the northern angle of the island; and perpetuated, by the name and settlement of the new province of <HI>Valentia,</HI> the glories of the reign of Valentinian <NOTE N="118" PLACE="foot">Ammianus has concisely represented (xx. 1. xxvi. 4. xxvii. 8. xxviii. 3.) the whole series of the British war.</NOTE>.

The military command of Africa had been long exercised by Count Romanus, and his abilities were not inadequate to his station: but as sordid interest was the sole motive of his conduct, he acted, on most occa∣sions, as if he had been the enemy of the pro∣vince, and the friend of the Barbarians of the desert. The three flourishing cities of Oea, Leptis, and Sabrata, which, under the name of Tripoli, had long constituted a foederal union <NOTE N="120" PLACE="foot">Ammianus frequently mentions their concilium annuum, legitimum, &amp;c.

<PB N="302" REF="309"/>
and the vines and fruit-trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious savages of Getulia. The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus; but they soon found that their military governor was not less cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians. As they were incapable of furnishing the four thousand camels, and the exorbitant present, which he required, before he would march to the assistance of Tri∣poli; his demand was equivalent to a refusal, and he might justly be accused as the author of the public calamity. In the annual assembly of the three cities, they nominated two deputies, to lay at the feet of Valentinian the customary offering of a gold victory; and to accompany this tribute, of duty, rather than of gratitude, with their humble complaint, that they were ruined by the enemy, and betrayed by their governor. If the severity of Valentinian had been rightly directed, it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus. But the Count, long exercised in the arts of corruption, had dispatched a swift and trusty messenger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius, master of the offices. The wisdom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice; and their honest indignation was cooled by delay. At length, when the repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public misfor∣tunes, the notary Palladius was sent from the court of Treves, to examine the state of Africa, and the conduct of Romanus. The rigid im∣partiality of Palladius was easily disarmed: he
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
was tempted to reserve for himself a part of the public treasure, which he brought with him for the payment of the troops; and from the moment that he was conscious of his own guilt, he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit of the Count. The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be false and frivolous; and Pal∣ladius himself was sent back from Treves to Africa, with a special commission, to discover and prosecute the authors of this impious con∣spiracy against the representatives of the sovereign. His enquiries were managed with so much dex∣terity and success, that he compelled the citizens of Leptis, who had sustained a recent siege of eight days, to contradict the truth of their own decrees, and to censure the behaviour of their own deputies. A bloody sentence was pronoun∣ced, without hesitation, by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valentinian. The president of Tri∣poli, who had presumed to pity the distress of the province, was publicly executed at Utica; four distinguished citizens were put to death, as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud; and the tongues of two others were cut out, by the ex∣press order of the emperor. Romanus, elated by impunity, and irritated by resistance, was still continued in the military command; till the Africans were provoked, by his avarice, to join the rebellious standard of Firmus, the Moor <NOTE N="121" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xviii. 6.

His father Nabal was one of the richest and most powerful of the Moorish princes, who ac∣knowledged the supremacy of Rome. But as he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Firmus, A.

The implacable zeal, with which Ro∣manus prosecuted the legal revenge of this mur∣der, could be ascribed only to a motive of ava∣rice, or personal hatred: but, on this occasion, his claims were just; his influence was weighty; and Firmus clearly understood, that he must either present his neck to the executioner, or ap∣peal from the sentence of the Imperial consistory, to his sword, and to the people <NOTE N="122" PLACE="foot">The chronology of Ammianus is loose and obscure: and Orosius (l. vii. c. 33. p. 551. edit.

He was received as the deliverer of his country; and, as soon as it appeared, that Romanus was formid∣able only to a submissive province, the tyrant of Africa became the object of universal contempt. The ruin of Caesarea, which was plundered and burnt by the licentious Barbarians, convinced the refractory cities of the danger of resistance; the power of Firmus was established, at least in the provinces of Mauritania and Numidia; and it seemed to be his only doubt, whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king, or the purple of a Roman emperor. But the imprudent
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>
and unhappy Africans soon discovered, that, in this rash insurrection, they had not sufficiently consulted their own strength, or the abilities of their leader. Before he could procure any cer∣tain intelligence, that the emperor of the West had fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of transports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone, he was suddenly informed, that the great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodo∣sius reco∣vers Afri∣ca, A. D. 375.</NOTE> Theodosius, with a small band of veterans, had landed near Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on the African coast; and the timid usurper sunk under the as∣cendant of virtue and military genius. Though Firmus possessed arms and treasures, his despair of victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts, which, in the same country, and in a similar situation, had formerly been practised by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an apparent submission, the vigilance of the Roman general; to seduce the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the duration of the war, by successively engaging the independent tribes of Africa to espouse his quarrel, or to protect his flight. Theodosius imitated the example, and obtained the success, of his predecessor Metel∣lus. When Firmus, in the character of a sup∣pliant, accused his own rashness, and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieu∣tenant of Valentinian received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace; but he diligently re∣quired the useful and substantial pledges of a sin∣cere repentance; nor could he be persuaded, by the assurances of peace, to suspend, for an
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
instant, the operations of an active war. A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodosius; and he satisfied, without much re∣luctance, the public indignation, which he had secretly excited. Several of the guilty accom∣plices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient custom, to the tumult of a military exe∣cution; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Ro∣man soldiers was mingled with respectful admi∣ration. Amidst the boundless plains of Getulia, and the innumerable vallies of Mount Atlas, it was impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus: and if the usurper could have tired the patience of his antagonist, he would have secured his per∣son in the depth of some remote solitude, and expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was subdued by the perseverance of Theodosius; who had formed an inflexible determination, that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant, and that every nation of Africa, which presumed to support his cause, should be involved in his ruin. At the head of a small body of troops, which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundred men, the Roman general advanced, with a steady prudence, devoid of rashness, or of fear, into the heart of a country, where he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors. The boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians; they were disconcerted
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
by his seasonable and orderly retreats; they were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military art; and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilised nation. When Theodosius entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen, king of the Isaflenses, the haughty savage required, in words of defiance, his name, and the object of his ex∣pedition. <Q>I am, replied the stern and disdain∣ful count, I am the general of Valentinian, the lord of the world; who has sent me hither to pursue and punish a desperate robber. Deli∣ver him instantly into my hands; and be as∣sured, that if thou dost not obey the commands of my invincible sovereign, thou, and the peo∣ple over whom thou reignest, shall be utterly extirpated.</Q> As soon as Igmazen was satisfied, that his enemy had strength and resolution to execute the fatal menace, he consented to pur∣chase a necessary peace by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive. The guards that were placed to secure the person of Firmus, deprived him of the hopes of escape; and the Moorish tyrant, after wine had extinguished the sense of danger, disappoint∣ed the insulting triumph of the Romans, by strangling himself in the night. His dead body, the only present which Igmazen could offer to the conqueror, was carelesly thrown upon a camel: and Theodosius, leading back his vic∣torious troops to Sitisi, was saluted by the warm∣est acclamations of joy and loyalty <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxix. 5.

But the partial and powerful favour of Mellobaudes en∣couraged him to challenge his legal judges, to obtain repeated delays for the purpose of pro∣curing a crowd of friendly witnesses, and, finally, to cover his guilty conduct, by the additional guilt of fraud and forgery. About the same time, the restorer of Britain and Africa, on a vague suspicion that his name and services were superior to the rank of a subject, was ignomini∣ously beheaded at Carthage. Valentinian no longer reigned; and the death of Theodosius, as well as the impunity of Romanus, may justly be imputed to the arts of the ministers who abused the confidence, and deceived the inexperienced youth, of his sons <NOTE N="124" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xxviii. 4.

Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors, the vast and inhospitable desert of the South extends above a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger.

Sapor entered the Arme∣nian
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
territories at the head of a formidable host of cuirassiers, of archers, and of mercenary foot; but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negociation, and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy. He affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unsuspicious Tiranus was persuaded, by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship, to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy. In the midst of a splendid enter∣tainment, he was bound in chains of silver, as an honour due to the blood of the Arsacides; and, after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana, he was released from the miseries of life, either by his own dagger, or by that of an assassin. The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a Persian province; the administration was shared between a distin∣guished satrap and a favourite eunuch; and Sa∣por marched, without delay, to subdue the mar∣tial spirit of the Iberians. Sauromaces, who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors, was expelled by a superior force; and, as an insult on the majesty of Rome, the King of kings placed a diadem on the head of his ab∣ject vassal Aspacuras.

<PB N="313" REF="320"/>
to resist the effort of his arms. The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the wife, or widow, of the Armenian king, ex∣cited the public compassion, and animated the desperate valour of her subjects and soldiers. The Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of Artogerassa, by a bold and well∣concerted sally of the besieged. But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased; the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhaust∣ed; the strength of the walls yielded to the assault; and the proud conqueror, after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword, led away captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more auspicious hour, had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 701.) proves, from chronology, that Olympias must have been the mother of Para.</NOTE>. Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms, he soon felt, that a country is unsub∣dued, as long as the minds of the people are actuated by an hostile and contumacious spirit. The satraps, whom he was obliged to trust, embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen, and of signalising their immortal hatred to the Persian name. Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians, those nations considered the Christians as the fa∣vourites, and the Magians as the adversaries, of the Supreme Being; the influence of the clergy, over a superstitious people, was uniformly exert∣ed
<PB N="314" REF="321"/>
in the cause of Rome; and as long as the suc∣cessors of Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces, the religious connexion always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire. A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the son of Tiranus, as the lawful sovereign of Armenia; and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years. By the unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his regard for his child∣ren, who were detained as hostages by the tyrant, was the only consideration, which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Persia. The emperor Valens, who respected the obliga∣tions of the treaty, and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war, ven∣tured, with slow and cautious measures, to sup∣port the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. Twelve legions established the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates was protected by the valour of Arintheus. A powerful army, under the command of count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia. But they were strictly en∣joined, not to commit the first hostilities, which might be understood as a breach of the treaty: and such was the implicit obedience of the Ro∣man
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
general, that they retreated, with exemplary patience, under a shower of Persian arrows, till they had clearly acquired a just title to an ho∣nourable and legitimate victory. Yet these ap∣pearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negociation. The contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it should seem, that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms, since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the two nations, who had assisted at the negociations <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxvii. 12. xxix. 1. xxx. 1, 2.) has described the events, without the dates, of the Persian war.

<P>In the general picture of the affairs of the East <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adven∣tures of Para, king of Arme∣nia.</NOTE> under the reign of Valens, the adventures of Para form one of the most striking and singular ob∣jects. The noble youth, by the persuasion of his mother Olympias, had escaped through the Per∣sian host that besieged Artogerassa, and implored the protection of the emperor of the East. By his timid councils, Para was alternately support∣ed, and recalled, and restored, and betrayed. The hopes of the Armenians were sometimes raised by the presence of their natural sovereign; and the ministers of Valens were satisfied, that they preserved the integrity of the public saith, if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title of King. But they soon repent∣ed of their own rashness. They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Persian mo∣narch. They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of Para himself: who
<PB N="317" REF="324"/>
sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the lives of his most faithful servants; and held a secret and disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father, and the enemy of his country. Under the specious pretence of consulting with the em∣peror on the subject of their common interest, Para was persuaded to descend from the moun∣tains of Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia, for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation, was received with due honours by the governors of the provinces through which he passed; but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progress was stopped under various pretences; his motions were watch∣ed with respectful vigilance; and he gradually discovered, that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans. Para suppressed his indignation, dissembled his fears, and, after secretly preparing his escape, mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful followers. The officer stationed at the door of his apartment imme∣diately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the suburbs, and endeavoured, without success, to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design. A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive; but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry; and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air, they retreated with precipitation to
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
the gates of Tarsus. After an incessant march of two days and two nights, Para and his Arme∣nians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the passage of the river, which they were obliged to swim, was attended with some delay and some loss. The country was alarmed; and the two roads, which were only separated by an interval of three miles, had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback, under the command of a count and a tribune. Para must have yielded to superior force, if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger, and the means of escape. A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune, while they pa∣tiently expected his approach along the public highways. They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or success: and seriously alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a skilful magician, had transformed himself and his followers, and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape. After his return to his native kingdom, Para still continued to profess himself the friend and ally of the Romans; but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince, that he might find an oppor∣tunity
<PB N="319" REF="326"/>
of stabbing him to the heart. Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East: the hall resounded with cheerful music, and the company was already heated with wine; when the count retired for an instant, drew his sword, and gave the signal of the murder. A robust and desperate Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia; and though he bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered to his hand, the table of the Imperial <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 374.</NOTE> general was stained with the royal blood of a guest, and an ally. Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman administration, that, to attain a doubtful object of political inte∣rest, the laws of nations, and the sacred rights of hospitality, were inhumanly violated in the face of the world <NOTE N="139" PLACE="foot">See in Ammianus (xxx. 1.) the adventures of Para.

the martial spirit of the Gothic hero, instead of being supported by the vigour of youth, was displayed with glory and success in the extreme period of human life; between the age of four∣score and one hundred and ten years. The in∣dependent tribes were persuaded, or compelled, to acknowledge the king of the Ostrogoths as the sovereign of the Gothic nation: the chiefs of the Visigoths, or Thervingi, renounced the royal title, and assumed the more humble ap∣pellation of <HI>Judges;</HI> and, among those judges, Athanaric, Fritigern, and Alavivus, were the most illustrious, by their personal merit, as well as by their vicinity to the Roman provinces. These domestic conquests, which increased the military power of Hermanric, enlarged his am∣bitious designs.

<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
perseverance of the Goths; and, after a bloody action, in which the king was slain, the remains of that warlike tribe became an useful accession to the camp of Hermanric. He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled in the use of arms, and formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern Poland. The victorious Goths, who were not inferior in numbers, prevailed in the contest, by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline. After the submission of the Venedi, the conqueror advanced, without resistance, as far as the con∣fines of the Aestii <NOTE N="142" PLACE="foot">The edition of Grotius (Jornandes, p. 642.) exhibits the name of <HI>Aestri.</HI> But reason, and the Ambrosian MS. have restored the <HI>Aestii,</HI> whose manners and situation are expressed by the pencil of Tacitus (Germania, c. 45.).</NOTE>; an ancient people, whose name is still preserved in the province of Estho∣nia. Those distant inhabitants of the Baltic coast were supported by the labours of agricul∣ture, enriched by the trade of amber, and con∣secrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of the Gods. But the scarcity of iron obliged the Aestian warriours to content themselves with wooden clubs; and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence, rather than to the arms, of Hermanric. His dominions, which extended from the Danube to the Baltic, included the native seats, and the recent acqui∣sitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the greatest part of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror, and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant. But he reigned over a
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its heroes. The name of Hermanric is almost buried in oblivion; his ex∣ploits are imperfectly known; and the Romans themselves appeared unconscious of the progress of an aspiring power, which threatened the liberty of the North, and the peace of the empire <NOTE N="143" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxxi. 3.) observes, in general terms: Ermen∣richi . . . . nobilissimi Regis, et, per multa variaque fortiter facta, vicinis gentibus formidati, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>

Their con∣tempt for two new and obscure princes, who had been raised to the throne by a popular election, inspired the Goths with bolder hopes; and, while they agitated some design of marching their con∣sederate force under the national standard <NOTE N="144" PLACE="foot">Valens . . . . docetur relationibus Ducum, gentem Gotho∣rum, eâ tempestate intactam ideoque saevissimam, conspirantem in unum, ad pervadendam parari collimitia Thraciarum.

The public treaty might stipulate no more than ten thousand auxiliaries: but the design was so zeal∣ously adopted by the chiefs of the Visigoths, that the army which passed the Danube amounted to
<PB N="323" REF="330"/>
the number of thirty thousand men <NOTE N="145" PLACE="foot">M. de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vi. p. 332.) has curiously ascertained the real number of these auxiliaries. The 3000 of Ammianus, and the 10,000 of Zosimus, were only the first divisions of the Gothic army.</NOTE>. They marched with the proud confidence, that their in∣vincible valour would decide the fate of the Roman empire; and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of the Barbarians, who displayed the insolence of masters, and the licen∣tiousness of enemies. But the intemperance which gratified their appetites, retarded their progress; and before the Goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius, they perceived, by the hostile state of the country, that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful rival. A chain of posts and fortifications, skilfully disposed by Va∣lens, or the generals of Valens, resisted their march, prevented their retreat, and intercepted their subsistence. The fierceness of the Barba∣rians was tamed and suspended by hunger: they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror, who offered them food and chains: the numerous captives were distributed in all the cities of the East; and the provincials, who were soon familiarized with their savage appearance, ventured, by degrees, to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries, whose name had so long been the object of their terror. The king of Scythia (and Hermanric alone could deserve so lofty a title) was grieved and exas∣perated by this national calamity. His ambas∣sadors
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
loudly complained, at the court of Valens, of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alli∣ance, which had so long subsisted between the Romans and the Goths. They alleged, that they had fulfilled the duty of allies, by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian; they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives; and they urged a very singular claim, that the Gothic generals, marching in arms, and in hostile array, were entitled to the sacred character and privileges of ambassadors. The decent, but peremptory, refusal of these extravagant demands, was signified to the Bar∣barians by Victor, master-general of the cavalry; who expressed, with force and dignity, the just complaints of the Emperor of the East <NOTE N="146" PLACE="foot">The march, and subsequent negociation, are described in the Fragments of Eunapius (Excerpt.

but the events scarcely deserve the at∣tention of posterity, except as the preliminary steps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire. Instead of leading the nations of Ger∣many and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or even to the gates of Constantinople, the aged monarch of the Goths resigned to the brave Atha∣naric the danger and glory of a defensive war, against an enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state. A bridge of boats was established upon the Danube; the presence of Valens animated his troops; and his ignorance of the art of war was compensated by personal bravery, and a wise deference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus, his masters-gene∣ral of the cavalry and infantry. The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience; but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from their strong posts in the mountains: and the devastation of the plains obliged the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter. The inces∣sant rains, which swelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit suspension of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole course of the ensuing summer, to his camp of Marciana∣polis. The third year of the war was more sa∣vourable to the Romans, and more pernicious to the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
the Barbarians of the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the necessaries of life; and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric was provoked, or compelled, to risk a battle, which he lost, in the plains; and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals, who had promised a large reward for the head of every Goth, that was brought into the Imperial camp. The submission of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens and his council; the em∣peror listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the senate of Con∣stantinople, which assumed, for the first time, a share in the public deliberations; and the same generals, Victor and Arintheus, who had suc∣cessfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace. The freedom of trade, which the Goths had hi∣therto enjoyed, was restricted to two cities on the Danube; the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated in favour of Athanaric alone, was more advan∣tageous than honourable to the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occasion, appears to have consulted his private interest, without expecting the orders of his sovereign, supported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens. He persisted in his de∣claration, that it was impossible for him, without
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more than probable, that his regard for the sanc∣tity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery. The Da∣nube, which separated the dominions of the two independent nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference. The Emperor of the East, and the Judge of the Visigoths, accompanied by an equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the stream. After the ratification of the treaty, and the delivery of hostages, Valens returned in tri∣umph to Constantinople; and the Goths remain∣ed in a state of tranquillity about six years; till they were violently impelled against the Roman empire, by an innumerable host of Scythians, who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the North <NOTE N="149" PLACE="foot">The Gothic war is described by Ammianus (xxvii. 5.), Zosi∣mus (l. iv. p. 211—214.), and Themistius (Orat. x. p. 129—141.).

<P>The Emperor of the West, who had resigned <NOTE PLACE="marg">War of the Quadi and Sarmati∣ans, A. D. 374.</NOTE> to his brother the command of the Lower Da∣nube, reserved for his immediate care the defence of the Rhaetian and Illyrian provinces, which spread so many hundred miles along the greatest of the European rivers. The active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the security of the frontier:
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
but the abuse of this policy provoked the just resentment of the Barbarians. The Quadi com∣plained, that the ground for an intended fortress had been marked out on their territories; and their complaints were urged with so much reason and moderation, that Equitius, master-general of Illyricum, consented to suspend the prosecu∣tion of the work, till he should be more clearly informed of the will of his sovereign. This fair occasion of injuring a rival, and of advancing the fortune of his son, was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin, the praefect, or rather ty∣rant, of Gaul. The passions of Valentinian were impatient of controul; and he credulously listen∣ed to the assurances of his favourite, that if the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were entrusted to the zeal of his son Mar∣cellinus, the emperor should no longer be im∣portuned with the audacious remonstrances of the Barbarians. The subjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany, were insulted by the arro∣gance of a young and worthless minister, who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior merit. He affected, how∣ever, to receive the modest application of Gabi∣nius, king of the Quadi, with some attention and regard: but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody design, and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of similar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the course of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire, the inhospitable table
<PB N="329" REF="336"/>
of two Imperial generals was stained with the royal blood of two guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their presence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was re∣sented in a very different manner by the servile temper of the Armenians, and the free and dar∣ing spirit of the Germans. The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power, which, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates of Rome. But they still possessed arms and courage; their courage was animated by despair, and they obtained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their Sar∣matian allies. So improvident was the assassin Marcellinus, that he chose the moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away, to sup∣press the revolt of Firmus; and the whole pro∣vince was exposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of the exasperated Barbarians. They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest; un∣mercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport; and either disregarded, or demolished, the empty fortifica∣tions. The princess Constantia, the daughter of the emperor Constantius, and the grand-daughter of the great Constantine, very narrowly escaped. That royal maid, who had innocently supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the destined wife of the heir of the Western empire. She traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train. Her person was saved from
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
danger, and the republic from disgrace, by the active zeal of Messala, governor of the provinces. As soon as he was informed that the village, where she stopped only to dine, was almost en∣compassed by the Barbarians, he hastily placed her in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium, which were at the distance of six and twenty miles. Even Sir∣mium might not have been secure, if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates and people. Their delay allowed Probus, the Prae∣torian praefect, sufficient time to recover his own spirits, and to revive the courage of the citizens. He skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortifications; and procured the seasonable and effectual assist∣ance of a company of archers, to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces. Disappointed in their attempts against the walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms against the master-general of the frontier, to whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions; but they contained the veteran strength of the Maesian and Pannonian bands. The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honours of rank and precedency, was the cause of their destruction; and, while they acted with separate forces and divided councils, they were surprised and slaughtered by the active vigour of the Sarmatian horse. The success of this inva∣sion
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes; and the province of Maesia would infal∣libly have been lost, if young Theodosius, the duke, or military commander, of the frontier, had not signalised, in the defeat of the public enemy, an intrepid genius, worthy of his illus∣trious father, and of his future greatness <NOTE N="150" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxix. 6.) and Zosimus (l. iv. p. 219, 220.) carefully mark the origin and progress of the Quadic and Sarmatian war.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mind of Valentinian, who then resided at <NOTE PLACE="marg">The expe∣dition,</NOTE> Treves, was deeply affected by the calamities of Illyricum; but the lateness of the season sus∣pended the execution of his designs till the en∣suing spring. He marched in person, with a <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 375.</NOTE> considerable part of the forces of Gaul, from the banks of the Moselle: and to the suppliant am∣bassadors of the Sarmatians, who met him on the way, he returned a doubtful answer, that, as soon as he reached the scene of action, he should examine, and pronounce. When he arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of the Illyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the auspicious govern∣ment of Probus, his Praetorian praefect <NOTE N="151" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxx. 5.), who acknowledges the merit, has cen∣sured, with becoming asperity, the oppressive administration of Pe∣tronius Probus. When Jerom translated, and continued, the Chro∣nicle of Eusebius (A. D. 380. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xii. p. 53. 626.), he expressed the truth, or at least the public opi∣nion of his country, in the following words: <Q>Probus P. P. Illy∣rici iniquissimis tributorum exactionibus, ante provincias quas re∣gebat, quam a Barbaris vastarentur, <HI>erasit.</HI></Q> (Chron. edit. Sca∣liger, p. 187. Animadvers. p. 259.).

A strict inquiry into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent. The severe condemnation of the murder of Gabinius, was the only mea∣sure which could restore the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honour of the Ro∣man name. But the haughty monarch was in∣capable of the magnanimity which dares to ac∣knowledge a fault. He forgot the provocation, remembered only the injury, and advanced into the country of the Quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge. The extreme devastation, and promiscuous massacre, of a savage war, were justified, in the eyes of the emperor, and per∣haps in those of the world, by the cruel equity of retaliation <NOTE N="153" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxx. 5.

<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
the Romans, and the consternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed the Danube without the loss of a single man. As he had resolved to complete the destruction of the Quadi by a second campaign, he fixed his winter-quarters at Bre∣getio, on the Danube, near the Hungarian city of Presburgh. While the operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather, the Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror; and, at the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne with bended bodies, and dejected countenances; and, without daring to complain of the murder of their king, they af∣firmed, with solemn oaths, that the late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred. The answer of the emperor left them but little to hope from his clemency or com∣passion. He reviled, in the most intemperate language, their baseness, their ingratitude, their insolence.—His eyes, his voice, his colour, his gestures, expressed the violence of his ungovern∣ed fury; and, while his whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion, a large blood-vessel sud∣denly burst in his body; and Valentinian fell speechless into the arms of his attendants. Their pious care immediately concealed his situation from the crowd: but, in a few minutes, the emperor of the West expired in an agony of pain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and death, of Valenti∣nian,</NOTE> retaining his senses till the last; and struggling,
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
without success, to declare his intentions to the generals and ministers, who surrounded the royal couch. Valentinian was about fifty-four years of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 375.

Bonamy (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxx. p. 394—405.). Yet I would preserve the natural circumstance of the bath; instead of fol∣lowing Zosimus, who represents Justina as an old woman, the wi∣dow of Magnentius.</NOTE>. <Q>The empress Severa (I relate the fable) admitted into her familiar society the lovely Justina, the daughter of an Italian governor: her ad∣miration of those naked charms, which she had often seen in the bath, was expressed with such lavish and imprudent praise, that the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his bed; and his public edict ex∣tended to all the subjects of the empire, the same domestic privilege, which he had assumed for himself.</Q> But we may be assured, from the evidence of reason, as well as history, that the two marriages of Valentinian, with Severa, and with Justina, were <HI>successively</HI> contracted; and that he used the ancient permission of divorce, which was still allowed by the laws, though it
<PB N="335" REF="342"/>
was condemned by the church. Severa was the mother of Gratian, who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the Western empire. He was the eldest son of a monarch, whose glorious reign had confirmed the free and honourable choice of his fellow-soldiers. Before he had attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem, with the title of Augustus: the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul <NOTE N="156" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxvii. 6.) describes the form of this military election, and <HI>august</HI> investiture. Valentinian does not appear to have consulted, or even informed, the senate of Rome.</NOTE>; and the name of Gratian was added to the names of Valentinian and Valens, in all the legal transactions of the Roman government. By his marriage with the grand-daughter of Constantine, the son of Valen∣tinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the Flavian family; which, in a series of three Im∣perial generations, were sanctified by time, reli∣gion, and the reverence of the people. At the death of his father, the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of his age; and his virtues al∣ready justified the favourable opinion of the army and people. But Gratian resided, without ap∣prehension, in the palace of Treves; whilst, at the distance of many hundred miles, Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio. The passions, which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master, immediately revived in the Imperial council; and the ambitious design
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
of reigning in the name of an infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius, who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands. They contrived the most honour∣able pretences to remove the popular leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the claims of the lawful successor: they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies, by a bold and decisive measure. The empress Justina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio, was respectfully invited to appear in the camp, with the son of the deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death of Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only four years old, was shewn, in the arms of his mother, to the legions; and solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the titles and en∣signs of supreme power. The impending dan∣gers of a civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian. He cheerfully accepted the choice of the army; declared, that he should always con∣sider the son of Justina as a brother, not as a rival; and advised the empress, with her son Valentinian, to fix their residence at Milan, in the fair and peaceful province of Italy; while he assumed the more arduous command of the coun∣tries beyond the Alps. Gratian dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish, or dis∣grace, the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he gradually confounded,

in the administration of the Western empire, the office of a guardian with the authority of a sove∣reign.

<P>IN the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the morning of the twenty∣first day of July, the greatest part of the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth∣quakes, A. D. 365, July 21st.</NOTE> world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake. The impression was communicated to the waters; the shores of the Mediterranean were left dry, by the sudden retreat of the sea; great quantities of fish were caught with the hand; large vessels were stranded on the mud; and a curious spectator <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Such is the bad taste of Ammianus (xxvi. 10.), that it is not easy to distinguish his facts from his metaphors.

But the tide soon returned, with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge, which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece, and of Egypt: large boats were trans∣ported, and lodged on the roofs of houses, or
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
at the distance of two miles from the shore; the people, with their habitations, were swept away by the waters; and the city of Alexandria an∣nually commemorated the fatal day, on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation. This calamity, the report of which was magnified from one province to another, astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil. They recol∣lected the preceding earthquakes, which had sub∣verted the cities of Palestine and Bithynia: they considered these alarming strokes as the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities, and their fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symp∣toms of a declining empire, and a sinking world <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The earthquakes and inundations are variously described by Libanius (Orat. de ulciscendâ Juliani nece, c. x. in Fabricius, Bibl. Graec. tom. vii. p. 158. with a learned note of Olearius), Zosimus (l. iv. p. 221.), Sozomen (l. vi. c. 2.), Cedrenus (p. 310. 314.), and Jerom (in Chron. p. 186. and tom. i. p. 250. in Vit. Hilarion.). Epidaurus must have been overwhelmed, had not the prudent citi∣zens placed St. Hilarion, an Egyptian monk, on the beach. He made the sign of the cross. The mountain wave stopped, bowed, and returned.</NOTE>. It was the fashion of the times, to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations of nature were con∣nected, by an invisible chain, with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the human mind; and the most sagacious divines could distinguish, according to the colour of their respective pre∣judices, that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake; or that a deluge was
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself with an observa∣tion, which seems to be justified by experience, that man has much more to fear from the pas∣sions of his fellow-creatures, than from the con∣vulsions of the elements <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Dicaearchus, the Peripatetic, composed a formal treatise, to prove this obvious truth; which is not the most honourable to the human species (Cicero, de Officiis, ii. 5.).</NOTE>. The mischievous effects of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very incon∣siderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war; as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amuse their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their subjects, in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier; and the peaceful citizen had seldom rea∣son to complain, that his life, or even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of war. In the disastrous period of the fall of the Roman empire, which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happiness and security of each individual were personally attacked; and the arts and labours of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Huns and Goths, A. D. 376.</NOTE> Huns precipitated on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which advanced, in less than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and opened a way, by the success of their arms,
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
to the inroads of so many hostile tribes, more sa∣vage than themselves. The original principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North; and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The original Scythians of Herodotus (l. iv. c. 47—57. 99—101.) were confined by the Danube and the Palus Maeotis, within a square of 4000 stadia (400 Roman miles). See d'Anville, (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxxv. p. 573—591.) Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. ii. p. 155. edit.

In the victorious armies of Zingis Khan, and his successors, the Tartars formed the vanguard; and the name, which first reached the ears of foreigners, was applied to the whole nation (Freret, in the Hist. de l'Academie, tom. xviii. p. 60.). In speaking of all, or any, of the northern shepherds of Europe, or Asia, I indifferently use the appellations of <HI>Scythians,</HI> or <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE>, will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations.</P>
<P>The different characters that mark the civilised <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pasto∣ral man∣ners of the Scythians, or Tartars.</NOTE> nations of the globe, may be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason; which so variously shapes, and so artificially composes, the manners and opinions of an European, or a Chinese. But the operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a quadruped, than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals, preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other. The uniform stability of their manners, is the natural consequence of the imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a similar situation, their
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
wants, their desires, their enjoyments, still con∣tinue the same: and the influence of food or climate, which, in a more improved state of society, is suspended, or subdued, by so many moral causes, most powerfully contributes to form, and to maintain, the national character of Bar∣barians. In every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary, have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life. In every age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their invincible courage, and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North; and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most fer∣tile and warlike countries of Europe <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Imperium Asiae <HI>ter</HI> quaesivere: ipsi perpetuo ab alieno Imperio, aut intacti, aut invicti, mansere. Since the time of Justin (ii. 2.) they have multiplied this account. Voltaire, in a few words (tom. x. p. 64. Hist. Generale, c. 156.), has abridged the Tartar conquests.
<L>Oft o'er the trembling nations from afar,</L>
<L>Has Scythia breath'd the living cloud of war.</L></NOTE>. On this occasion, as well as on many others, the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some reluctance, to confess, that the pastoral manners, which have been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life. To illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors,
<PB N="343" REF="350"/>
in the three important articles of, I. Their diet; II. Their habitation; and, III. Their exercises. The narratives of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The fourth book of Herodotus affords a curious, though im∣perfect, portrait of the Scythians. Among the moderns, who de∣scribe the uniform scene, the Khan of Khowaresm, Abulghazi Ba∣hadur, expresses his native feelings; and his Genealogical History of the <HI>Tatars</HI> has been copiously illustrated by the French and Eng∣lish editors. Carpin, Ascelin, and Rubruquis (in the Hist. des Voy∣ages, tom. vii.), represent the Moguls of the fourteenth century. To these guides I have added Gerbillon, and the other jesuits (De∣scription de la Chine, par du Halde, tom. iv.), who accurately sur∣veyed the Chinese Tartary; and that honest and intelligent traveller Bell, of Antermony (two volumes in 4to.

Some of the happy savages, who dwell between the tropics, are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds. The skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine (if they are able to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be affect∣ed by the use of animal, or of vegetable, food; and whether the common association of carnivo∣rous and cruel, deserves to be considered in any
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a salutary, prejudice of humanity <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes. Cette observation est de touts les lieux, et de touts les tems: la barbare Angloise est con∣nue, &amp;c. Emile de Rousseau, tom. i. p. 274. Whatever we may think of the general observation, <HI>we</HI> shall not easily allow the truth of his example. The good-natured complaints of Plutarch, and the pathetic lamentations of Ovid, seduce our reason, by exciting our sensibility.</NOTE>. Yet if it be true, that the sentiment of compassion is imper∣ceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe, that the hor∣rid objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement, are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity, in the tent of a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are served, with very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling mur∣derer. In the military profession, and especially in the conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages. Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity; and the large magazines, which are indispensably necessary for the subsist∣ence of our troops, must be slowly transported by the labour of men, or horses. But the flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a sure and encreasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far greater part of the uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
so extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find some tolerable pasture. The supply is multiplied and prolonged, by the un∣distinguishing appetite, and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table, or have died of disease. Horse-flesh, which in every age and country has been pro∣scribed by the civilised nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with peculiar greediness; and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scy∣thia is always followed, in their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate number of spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the resources of cou∣rage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almost consumed, they slaugh∣ter the greatest part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked, or dried in the sun. On the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese, or rather of hard curd, which they occasionally dissolve in water; and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many days, the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior. But this extraordinary abstinence, which the Stoic would approve, and the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate are the most grateful present,
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
or the most valuable commodity, that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their industry seems to consist in the art of ex∣tracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor, which possesses a very strong power of intoxica∣tion. Like the animals of prey, the savages, both of the old and new world, experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty; and their stomach is inured to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger and of intemperance.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Habita∣tions.</NOTE> a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated country; and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be assem∣bled under the same standard, either to defend their own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes. The progress of manufac∣tures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no longer soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society, cor∣rupt the habits of the military life. The pasto∣ral manners of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement. The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled, but they are assembled in a camp; and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation. The houses of the Tartars are no more than small tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and
<PB N="347" REF="354"/>
dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of both sexes. The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large waggons, and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the approach of night, within the protection of the camp. The necessity of preventing the most mischievous con∣fusion, in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals, must gradually introduce, in the distri∣bution, the order, and the guard, of the encamp∣ment, the rudiments of the military art. As soon as the forage of a certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of shepherds, makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pas∣toral lise, the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult operations of war. The choice of stations is regulated by the differ∣ence of the seasons: in the summer, the Tartars advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at least, in the neighbourhood of a running stream. But in the winter they return to the South, and shelter their camp, behind some convenient eminence, against the winds, which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse, among the wandering tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest. The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture, that it
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his property are always included; and, in the most distant marches, he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the fear, or the re∣sentment of injury, the impatience of servitude, have, in every age, been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence, or a less form∣idable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove, and been driven, from the confines of China to those of Germany <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">These Tartar emigrations have been discovered by M. de Guignes (Histoire des Huns, tom. i. ii.), a skilful and laborious interpreter of the Chinese language; who has thus laid open new and important scenes in the history of mankind.</NOTE>. These great emigrations, which have been sometimes executed with almost incre∣dible diligence, were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate. It is well known, that the cold of Tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected: this uncommon rigour is attributed to the height of the plains, which rise, especially towards the East, more than half a mile above the level of the sea; and to the quantity of saltpetre, with which the soil is deeply
<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
impregnated <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">A plain in the Chinese Tartary, only eighty leagues from the great wall, was found by the missionaries to be three thousand geo∣metrical paces above the level of the sea. Montesquieu, who has used, and abused, the relations of travellers, deduces the revolutions of Asia from this important circumstance, that heat and cold, weakness and strength, touch each other without any temperate zone (Esprit des Loix, l. xvii. c. 3.).</NOTE>. In the winter-season, the broad and rapid rivers, that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian, or the Icy Sea, are strongly frozen; the fields are covered with a bed of snow; and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may securely traverse, with their families, their waggons, and their cattle, the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain.</P>
<P N="3">III. The pastoral life, compared with the la∣bours <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercises.</NOTE> of agriculture and manufactures, is un∣doubtedly a life of idleness; and as the most honourable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares. But this leisure, instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is usefully spent in the vio∣lent and sanguinary exercise of the chace. The plains of Tartary are filled with a strong and ser∣viceable breed of horses, which are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scy∣thians of every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders: and constant practice had seated them so firmly on horseback, that they were supposed by strangers to perform the ordi∣nary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting from their
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
steeds. They excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the weighty arrow is direct∣ed to its object with unerring aim, and irresist∣ible force. These arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the desert, which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formid∣able enemy; the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the ante∣lope. The vigour and patience both of the men and horses are continually exercised by the fa∣tigues of the chace; and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts; they boldly encounter the angry wild-boar, when he turns against his pursuers, excite the sluggish courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tyger, as he slumbers in the thicket. Where there is danger there may be glory: and the mode of hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valour, may justly be con∣sidered as the image, and as the school, of war. The general hunting-matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes, compose an in∣structive exercise for their numerous cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumfe∣rence, to encompass the game of an extensive district; and the troops that form the circle re∣gularly advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, surrounded on every
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march, which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the val∣lies, without interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a remote object; of preserving their intervals; of suspending, or accelerating, their pace, according to the motions of the troops on their right and left; and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders. Their leaders study, in this practical school, the most important lesson of the military art; the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time. To employ against a human enemy the same patience and valour, the same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which is required in real war; and the amusements of the chace serve as a prelude to the conquest of an empire <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Petit de la Croix (Vie de Gengiscan, l. iii. c. 7.) represents the full glory and extent of the Mogul chace.

<P>The political society of the ancient Germans <NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment.</NOTE> has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of in∣dependent warriors. The tribes of Scythia, dis∣tinguished by the modern appellation of <HI>Hords,</HI> assume the form of a numerous and increasing family; which, in the course of successive gene∣rations,
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
has been propagated from the same ori∣ginal stock. The meanest, and most ignorant, of the Tartars, preserve, with conscious pride, the inestimable treasure of their genealogy; and whatever distinctions of rank may have been in∣troduced, by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth, they mutually respect themselves, and each other, as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The custom, which still prevails, of adopting the bravest, and most faithful, of the captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion, that this extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and fictitious. But the useful prejudice, which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion, produces the effects of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood; and their chief, or <HI>mursa,</HI> as the repre∣sentative of their great father, exercises the au∣thority of a judge, in peace, and of a leader, in war. In the original state of the pastoral world, each of the <HI>mursas</HI> (if we may continue to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family; and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed, by superior force, or mutual consent. But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities, under the command of a supreme head. The weak were desirous of support, and the strong were ambitious of domi∣nion; the power, which is the result of union, oppressed and collected the divided forces of the
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of vic∣tory, the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves, and their followers, under the for∣midable standard of a confederate nation. The most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command, to which he was entitled by the superiority, either of merit, or of power. He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals; and the title of <HI>Khan</HI> expresses, in the language of the North of Asia, the full ex∣tent of the regal dignity. The right of heredi∣tary succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy; and at this mo∣ment all the Khans, who reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">See the second volume of the Genealogical History of the Tar∣tars: and the lists of the Khans, at the end of the life of Gengis, or Zingis.

spoil. A Tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendor of his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most favoured, of his followers, and to obtain, from the gentle influence of corruption, the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern man∣dates of authority. The manners of his subjects, accustomed, like himself, to blood and rapine, might excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of tyranny, as would excite the horror of a civilised people; but the power of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The immediate jurisdiction of the Khan is con∣fined within the limits of his own tribe; and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been mode∣rated by the ancient institution of a national council.

may be discovered in the constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations; but the perpetual conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the establishment of a powerful and despotic empire. The victor, enriched by the tribute, and fortified by the arms, of dependent kings, has spread his conquests over Europe or Asia: the successful shepherds of the North have submitted to the confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and the introduction of luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people, has undermined the foundations of the throne <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Montesquieu labours to explain a difference, which has not existed, between the liberty of the Arabs, and the <HI>perpetual</HI> slavery of the Tartars (Esprit des Loix, l. xvii. c. 5. l. xviii. c. 19, &amp;c.).</NOTE>.</P>

These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and decisive success. The Chinese ge∣nerals

But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained, in their adverse fortune, the un∣daunted spirit of their ancestors. The western world was open to their valour; and they resolv∣ed, under the conduct of their hereditary chief∣tains, to discover and subdue some remote country, which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi, and to the laws of China <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">M. de Guignes has skilfully traced the footsteps of the Huns through the vast deserts of Tartary (tom. ii. p. 123. 277, &amp;c. 325, &amp;c.).</NOTE>.

Their lux∣ury was maintained by the labour of the Sog∣dians; and the only vestige of their ancient bar∣barism, was the custom which obliged all the companions, perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same grave <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Procopius de Bell.

Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of China, for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civilised life were obliterated; and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were compared, with some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert. Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous; and while each hord was governed by its peculiar Mursa, their tumultuary council di∣rected the public measures of the whole nation. As late as the thirteenth century, their transient residence on the Eastern banks of the Volga, was attested by the name of Great Hungary <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">In the thirteenth century, the monk Rubruquis (who tra∣versed the immense plain of Kipzak, in his journey to the court of the Great Khan) observed the remarkable name of <HI>Hungary,</HI> with the traces of a common language and origin (Hist. des Voyages, tom. vii. p. 269.).</NOTE>.

The Huns, with their flocks and herds, their wives and children, their dependents and allies, were transported to the West of the Volga: and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani, a pastoral peo∣ple who occupied, or wasted, an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia. The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their con∣quests; and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their vassals. Towards the North, they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the savages who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taste of human flesh: and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of Persia and India. The mixture of Sarmatic and
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani, to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a yel∣lowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tar∣tar race. They were less deformed in their per∣sons, less brutish in their manners, than the Huns; but they did not yield to those formidable Bar∣barians in their martial and independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the use of domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind. A naked scymetar, fixed in the ground, was the only object of their religious worship; the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses; and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the pusil∣lanimous warriors, who patiently expected the infirmities of age, and the tortures of lingering disease <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Utque hominibus quietis et placidis otium est voluptabile, ita illos pericula juvant et bella.

Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores of the Baltic; associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Ger∣many; and shared the spoil of the Roman pro∣vinces of Gaul and Spain. But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an honourable and advantageous union: and the Huns, who esteemed the valour of their less fortunate enemies, proceeded, with an increase of numbers and confidence, to invade the limits of the Gothic empire.</P>
<P>The great Hermanric, whose dominions ex∣tended <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their vic∣tories over the Goths. A.

they added, the surprise and abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth gestures, and the strange deformity of the Huns. These savages of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some resemblance) to the animals who walk very aukwardly on two legs; and to the mis-shapen figures, the <HI>Termini,</HI> which were often placed on the bridges of antiquity.

Against these enemies, Hermanric prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state; but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to second, than to repel, the invasion of the Huns.

The brothers of that unfor∣tunate woman seized the favourable moment of revenge. The aged king of the Goths languish∣ed some time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers: but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord. His death, which has been imputed to his own despair, left the reins of government in the hands of Withi∣mer, who, with the doubtful aid of some Scythian mercenaries, maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns and the Alani, till he was defeated and slain, in a decisive battle. The Ostrogoths submitted to their fate: and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila. But the per∣son of Witheric, the infant king, was saved by
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax; two war∣riors of approved valour and fidelity; who, by cautious marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus, or Niester; a considerable river, which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia. On the banks of the Ni∣ester, the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his own than to the general safety, had fixed the camp of the Visigoths; with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians, whom he thought it less advisable to provoke. The ordi∣nary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage, and the incumbrance of captives; but their military skill deceived, and almost de∣stroyed, the army of Athanaric. While the judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester, he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had passed the river in a fordable place; and, it was not without the utmost efforts of cou∣rage and conduct, that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country. The undaunt∣ed general had already formed a new and judi∣cious plan of defensive war; and the strong lines, which he was preparing to construct between the mountains, the Pruth and the Danube, would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia, from the destructive inroads of the Huns <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">The text of Ammianus seems to be imperfect, or corrupt; but the nature of the ground explains, and almost defines, the Go∣thic rampart.

hopes and measures of the judge of the Visigoths were soon disappointed, by the trembling impa∣tience of his dismayed countrymen; who were persuaded by their fears, that the interposition of the Danube was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit, and invincible va∣lour, of the Barbarians of Scythia.

But the atten∣tion of the emperor was most seriously engaged, by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were entrusted with the defence of the Danube. He was informed, that the North was agitated by a furious tempest; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and monstrous race of savages, had subverted the power of the Goths; and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the dust, covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river. With out-stretched arms, and pathetic lament∣ations, they loudly deplored their past misfor∣tunes and their present danger; acknowledged, that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government; and most solemnly protested, that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace, they should ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, who impatiently expected, from the mouth of Valens, an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother, whose death hap∣pened <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 375.

and as the distressful situation of the Goths re∣quired an instant and peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favourite resource of feeble and timid minds; who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long as the same passions and interests subsist among man∣kind, the questions of war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of Europe, has never been summoned to consider the propriety, or the danger, of admitting, or rejecting, an innume∣rable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilised nation. When that im∣portant proposition, so essentially connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favourable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign. The slaves, who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled or disregard∣ed the terrors of this national emigration; so extremely different from the partial and acci∣dental colonies, which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applaud∣ed the liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to defend the throne of Valens; who might now add
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
to the royal treasures, the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted, and their service was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were immediately dispatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese, to make the necessary preparations for the passage and sub∣sistence of a great people, till a proper and suf∣ficient territory could be allotted for their future residence. The liberality of the emperor was accompanied, however, with two harsh and ri∣gorous conditions, which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they passed the Danube, they were requir∣ed to deliver their arms: and it was insisted, that their children should be taken from them, and dispersed through the provinces of Asia; where they might be civilised by the arts of edu∣cation, and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents.</P>
<P>During this suspense of a doubtful and distant <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are transported over the Danube into the Roman empire.</NOTE> negociation, the impatient Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube, without the permission of the government, whose protection they had implored. Their motions were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river; and their fore∣most detachments were defeated with considerable slaughter: yet such were the timid councils of the reign of Valens, that the brave officers who
<PB N="382" REF="389"/>
had served their country in the execution of their duty, were punished by the loss of their employ∣ments, and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads. The Imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">The passage of the Danube is exposed by Ammianus (xxxi. 3, 4.), Zosimus (l. iv. p. 223, 224.), Eunapius in Excerpt.

A large fleet of vessels, of boats, and of canoes, was pro∣vided: many days and nights they passed and repassed with indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of Valens, that not a single Barbarian, of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be left on the opposite shore. It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers; but the persons who were employed soon desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the prosecution of the endless

A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men; and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves, the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration, must have amounted to near a million of persons, of both sexes, and of all ages. The children of the Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank, were separated from the multitude. They were conducted, without delay, to the distant seats assigned for their resi∣dence and education; and as the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities, their gay and splendid apparel, their robust and martial figure, excited the surprise and envy of the Provincials. But the stipulation, the most offensive to the Goths, and the most important to the Romans, was shamefully eluded. The Barbarians, who considered their arms as the en∣signs of honour, and the pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a price, which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to
<PB N="384" REF="391"/>
accept. To preserve their arms, the haughty warriors consented, with some reluctance, to prostitute their wives or their daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy, secured the connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Eunapius and Zosimus curiously specify these articles of Gothic wealth and luxury.

The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permitted to enter the boats; and, when their strength was collected on the other side of the river, the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia, assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect. The leaders of the Ostrogoths, Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king, appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube; and immediately dispatched their ambassadors to the court of An∣tioch, to solicit, with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude, the same favour which had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths. The absolute refusal of Valens suspended their progress, and discovered the repentance, the sus∣picions, and the fears, of the Imperial council.</P>

of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and skilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by mistake or accident. The insolence, or the indignation, of the Goths, if they conceived them∣selves to be the objects, either of fear, or of contempt, might urge them to the most desperate extremities; and the fortune of the state seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the inte∣grity, of the generals of Valens. At this im∣portant crisis, the military government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage; and whose guilt was only alle∣viated by their incapacity of discerning the per∣nicious effects of their rash and criminal admini∣stration. Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying, with decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an unge∣nerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vilest food was sold at an extravagant price; and, in the room of whol∣some and substantial provisions, the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs, and of unclean ani∣mals, who had died of disease. To obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread, the Goths resigned the possession of an expensive, though serviceable, slave; and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious, but useless, metal <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot"><HI>Decem libras;</HI> the word <HI>silver</HI> must be understood.

<PB N="386" REF="393"/>
property was exhausted, they continued this ne∣cessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daugh∣ters; and notwithstanding the love of freedom, which animated every Gothic breast, they sub∣mitted to the humiliating maxim, that it was better for their children to be maintained in a servile condition, than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless independence. The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by sub∣sequent injuries: a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians, who plead∣ed, without success, the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour; and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had re∣ceived from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial famine. But the means of relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands; since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left, to an injured people, the possession and the use of arms. The clamours of a multitude, un∣taught to disguise their sentiments, announced the first symptoms of resistance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Max∣imus. Those crafty ministers, who substituted
<PB N="387" REF="394"/>
the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire; and to disperse them, in separate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces. As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect, or con∣fidence, of the Barbarians, they diligently col∣lected, from every side, a military force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman subjects. But the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely direct∣ed to the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications, which constituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal oversight was observed, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who anxiously watched the favourable moment of escaping from the pur∣suit of the Huns. By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured, the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported, without opposition, their king and their army; and boldly fixed an hostile and independent camp on the territories of the empire <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Ammianus, xxxi. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under the name of judges, Alavivus and Fri∣tigern <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of the Goths in Maesia, and their first vic∣tories.</NOTE> were the leaders of the Visigoths in peace and war; and the authority which they derived from their birth, was ratified by the free consent of the nation. In a season of tranquillity, their power might have been equal, as well as their
<PB N="388" REF="395"/>
rank; but, as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppression, the supe∣rior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military command, which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare. He restrained the impa∣tient spirit of the Visigoths, till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation. Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers under the same standard, he secretly cultivated the friendship of the Ostrogoths; and while he professed an im∣plicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals, he proceeded by slow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maesia, about seventy miles from the banks of the Da∣nube. On that fatal spot, the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment; and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates of the city were strictly guarded; and the Barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision; and as their pa∣tience was now exhausted, the townsmen, the sol∣diers, and the Goths, were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry re∣proaches.
<PB N="389" REF="396"/>
A blow was imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn; and the first blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel, became the signal of a long and destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance, Lupi∣cinus was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his soldiers were slain, and despoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed by wine, and oppressed by sleep, he issued a rash command, that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus. The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme danger: and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero, he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him. <Q>A trifling dispute, said the Gothic leader, with a firm but gentle tone of voice, appears to have arisen between the two nations; but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences, unless the tu∣mult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our safety, and the authority of our pre∣sence.</Q> At these words, Fritigern and his companions drew their swords, opened their pas∣sage through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace, the streets, and the gates, of Marcia∣nopolis, and, mounting their horses, hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans. The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp: war was instantly resolved, and the resolution was
<PB N="390" REF="397"/>
executed without delay: the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors; and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the Barbarian trumpet <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Vexillis de <HI>more</HI> sublatis, auditisque <HI>triste sonautibus classicis.</HI> Am∣mian. xxxi. 5.

The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still presumed to despise, his formidable ene∣my, marched against the Goths, at the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops. The valour of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the ranks of the Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards, his tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader. <Q>That successful day put an end to the distress of the Barbarians, and the security of the Ro∣mans: from that day, the Goths, renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles, assumed the character of citizens and masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the pos∣sessors of land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces of the empire, which are bounded by the Danube.</Q> Such are the

But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine and de∣struction.

The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the Romans with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the forces of Fritigern, and the cala∣mities of the province.

They were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople: but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hel∣lespont, at a distance from the dangerous tempt∣ation which might so easily be communicated by the neighbourhood, and the success, of their countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allow∣ance of provisions, and of a delay of only two days, was expressed in the most dutiful terms. But the first magistrate of Hadrianople, incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his country-house, refused this indulgence; and arming against them the inhabitants and manu∣facturers of a populous city, he urged, with hos∣tile threats, their instant departure. The Bar∣barians stood silent and amazed, till they were exasperated by the insulting clamours, and missile weapons, of the populace: but when patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the undis∣ciplined multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armour <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">An Imperial manufacture of shields, &amp;c. was established at Hadrianople; and the populace were headed by the <HI>Fabricenses,</HI> or workmen (Vales. ad Ammian. xxxi. 6.).</NOTE>, which they were unworthy to bear.

Visigoths; the troops of Colias and Suerid ex∣pected the approach of the great Fritigern, ranged themselves under his standard, and signalised their ardour in the siege of Hadrianople. But the resistance of the garrison informed the Barbarians, that, in the attack of regular fortifications, the efforts of unskilful courage are seldom effectual. Their general acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that <Q>he was at peace with stone walls <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Pacem sibi esse cum parietibus memorans.

In the course of these depredations, a great number of the chil∣dren of the Goths, who had been sold into cap∣tivity, were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents; but these tender interviews, which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity, tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge. They listened, with eager attention, to the complaints of their captive children, who had suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters; and the same cruelties, the same indignities, were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Ro∣mans <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">See Ammianus, xxxi. 5, 6.

<P>The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations of the Go∣thic war. A.

These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the East: but, on this occasion alone, Valens was brave; and his unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects. He declared his intention of march∣ing from Antioch to Constantinople, to subdue this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not
<PB N="395" REF="402"/>
ignorant of the difficulties of the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of his nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the West. The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia; that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor; and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was entrusted, during the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus, two gene∣rals who indulged themselves in a very false and favourable opinion of their own abilities. On their arrival in Thrace, they were joined by Ri∣chomer, count of the domestics; and the auxili∣aries of the West, that marched under his ban∣ner, were composed of the Gallic legions, reduced indeed by a spirit of desertion to the vain appear∣ances of strength and numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride, rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and to en∣counter, the Barbarians; who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows, near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">The Itinerary of Antoninus (p. 226, 227. edit.

In the midst of riotous intemperance, the watchful Fritigern observed the motions, and penetrated the designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers of the enemy were continually increasing; and, as he understood their intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of forage should oblige him to remove his camp; he recalled to their standard his pre∣datory detachments, which covered the adjacent country. As soon as they descried the flaming beacons <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Statim ut accensi malleoli. I have used the literal sense of real torches or beacons: but I almost suspect, that it is only one of those turgid metaphors, those false ornaments, that perpetually dis∣figure the style of Ammianus.</NOTE>, they obeyed, with incredible speed, the signal of their leader; the camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians; their im∣patient clamours demanded the battle, and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs. The evening was al∣ready far advanced; and the two armies prepared themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only till the dawn of day. While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath; and as they advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which celebrated the glory of their forefathers, were mingled with their fierce and dissonant out∣cries; and opposed to the artificial harmony of
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
the Roman shout. Some military skill was dis∣played by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the light, was main∣tained, on either side, by the personal and ob∣stinate efforts of strength, valour, and agility. The legions of Armenia supported their fame in arms; but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude: the left wing of the Romans was thrown into disorder, and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses. This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial success; and when the two armies, at a late hour of the evening, retreated to their re∣spective camps, neither of them could claim the honours, or the effects, of a decisive victory. The real loss was more severely felt by the Ro∣mans, in proportion to the smallness of their numbers; but the Goths were so deeply con∣founded and dismayed by this vigorous, and per∣haps unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as the circumstances of time and place would admit, were piously discharged to some officers of distinguished rank; but the indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain. Their flesh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey, who, in that age, enjoyed very frequent and delicious feasts; and several years afterwards the white and naked bones, which covered the wide extent of the fields, presented

<P>The progress of the Goths had been checked <NOTE PLACE="marg">Union of the Goths with the Huns, A∣lani, &amp;c.</NOTE> by the doubtful event of that bloody day; and the Imperial generals, whose army would have been consumed by the repetition of such a con∣test, embraced the more rational plan, of destroy∣ing the Barbarians, by the wants and pressure of their own multitudes. They prepared to con∣fine the Visigoths in the narrow angle of land, between the Danube, the desert of Scythia, and the mountains of Haemus, till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevi∣table operation of famine. The design was pro∣secuted with some conduct and success; the Barbarians had almost exhausted their own ma∣gazines, and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve the strength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman for∣tifications. His labours were interrupted by the alarming intelligence, that new swarms of Bar∣barians had passed the unguarded Danube, either to support the cause, or to imitate the example, of Fritigern. The just apprehension, that he himself might be surrounded, and overwhelmed, by the arms of hostile and unknown nations,
<PB N="399" REF="406"/>
compelled Saturninus to relinquish the siege of the Gothic camp: and the indignant Visigoths, breaking from their confinement, satiated their hunger and revenge, by the repeated devastation of the fruitful country, which extends above three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the streights of the Hellespont <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxxi. 8.</NOTE>. The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed to the pas∣sions, as well as to the interest, of his Barbarian allies; and the love of rapine, and the hatred of Rome, seconded, or even prevented, the elo∣quence of his ambassadors. He cemented a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king: the long animosity of rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest; the independent part of the nation was associated under one stand∣ard; and the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior genius of the general of the Visigoths. He obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae, whose military renown was disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic manners. Every youth, on his entrance into the world, was united by the ties of honourable friendship, and brutal love, to some warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to be released from this unnatural connection, till he had approved his manhood, by slaying, in single combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the fo∣rest <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Hanc Taifalorum gentem turpem, et obscenae vitae flagitiis ita accipimus mersam; ut apud eos nefandi concubitûs foedere copulen∣tur mares puberes, aetatis viriditatem in eorum pollutis usibus con∣sumpturi.

But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of those ene∣mies who had expelled them from their native seats. The loose subordination, and extensive possessions, of the Huns and the Alani, delayed the conquests, and distracted the councils, of that victorious people. Several of the hords were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of Scythia, added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry.

<P>One of the most dangerous inconveniencies of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Victory of Gratian over the Alemanni, A. D. 378. May.</NOTE> the introduction of the Barbarians into the army and the palace, was sensibly felt in their cor∣respondence with their hostile countrymen; to whom they imprudently, or maliciously, revealed the weakness of the Roman empire. A soldier, of the life-guards of Gratian, was of the nation
<PB N="401" REF="408"/>
of the Alemanni, and of the tribe of the Len∣tienses, who dwelt beyond the lake of Constance. Some domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a short visit to his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious in∣quiries; and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate acquaint∣ance with the secrets of the state, and the designs of his master. The intelligence, that Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul, and of the West, to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointed out to the restless spirit of the Alemanni, the moment, and the mode, of a suc∣cesful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments, who, in the month of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice, was the prelude of a more important war. The boldest hopes of rapine, perhaps of conquest, outweighed the con∣siderations of timid prudence, or national faith. Every forest, and every village, poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of the Alemanni, which, on their approach, was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified to the number of seventy thousand, by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court. The legions, which had been ordered to march into Pannonia, were immediately recalled, or detained, for the defence of Gaul; the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the youthful emperor, though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the for∣mer,
<PB N="402" REF="409"/>
was much more inclined to admire, and to follow, the martial ardour of his colleague; who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domestics, and of king of the Franks. His rival Priarius, king of the Ale∣manni, was guided, or rather impelled; by the same headstrong valour; and as their troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders, they met, they saw, they encountered, each other, near the town of Argentaria, or Colmar <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">The field of battle, <HI>Argentaria,</HI> or <HI>Argentovaria,</HI> is accurately fixed by M. d'Anville (Notice de l'Ancienne Gaul, p. 96—99.) at twenty-three Gallic leagues, or thirty-four and a half Roman miles, to the south of Strasburgh. From its ruins the adjacent town of <HI>Colmar</HI> has arisen.</NOTE>, in the plains of Alsace. The glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons, and well-prac∣tised evolutions of the Roman soldiers: the Ale∣manni, who long maintained their ground, were slaughtered with unrelenting fury: five thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains; and the glorious death of their king on the field of battle, saved him from the re∣proaches of the people, who are always disposed to accuse the justice, or policy, of an unsuccess∣ful war. After this signal victory, which secured the peace of Gaul, and asserted the honour of the Roman arms, the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Ale∣manni, he suddenly inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected passage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their country.
<PB N="403" REF="410"/>
The Barbarians opposed to his progress the ob∣stacles of nature and of courage; and still con∣tinued to retreat, from one hill to another, till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of the power and perseverance of their enemies. Their submission was accepted, as a proof, not indeed of their sincere repentance, but of their actual distress; and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless na∣tion, as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation. The subjects of the empire, who had so often experienced, that the Alemanni could neither be subdued by arms, nor restrained by treaties, might not promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity: but they discovered, in the virtues of their young sovereign, the pro∣spect of a long and auspicious reign. When the legions climbed the mountains, and scaled the fortifications, of the Barbarians, the valour of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks; and the gilt and variegated armour of his guards was pierced and shattered by the blows, which they had received in their constant attachment to the person of their sovereign. At the age of nineteen, the son of Valentinian seemed to pos∣sess the talents of peace and war; and his per∣sonal success against the Alemanni was interpreted as a sure presage of his Gothic triumphs <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">The full and impartial narrative of Ammianus (xxxi. 10.) may derive some additional light from the Epitome of Victor, the Chronicle of Jerom, and the History of Orosius (l. vii. c. 33. p. 552. edit.

He obtained the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions; and this separate detach∣ment soon acquired the spirit of discipline, and the exercise of arms, which were almost forgot∣ten under the reign of Valens. By the vigour and conduct of Sebastian, a large body of the Goths was surprised in their camp: and the im∣mense spoil, which was recovered from their hands, filled the city of Hadrianople, and the ad∣jacent plain. The splendid narratives, which the general transmitted of his own exploits, alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit; and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war, his valour was praised, his advice was rejected; and Valens, who listened with pride and pleasure to the flat∣tering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and

assured conquest. His army was strengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans; and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so much military skill, that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and to intercept either the troops themselves, or their convoys of provisions. The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople, was fortified, according to the practice of the Ro∣mans, with a ditch and rampart; and a most important council was summoned, to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire. The party of reason and of delay was strenuously main∣tained by Victor, who had corrected, by the les∣sons of experience, the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character; while Sebastian, with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier, represented every precaution, and every measure, that implied a doubt of immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their in∣vincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was pre∣cipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern, and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West. The advantages of negociating in the midst of war, were perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians; and a Christian eccle∣siastic was dispatched, as the holy minister of peace, to penetrate, and to perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes, as well as the provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador; who
<PB N="407" REF="414"/>
protested, in the name of Fritigern, that he was still disposed to lay down his arms, or to employ them only in the defence of the empire; if he could secure, for his wandering countrymen, a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace, and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle. But he added, in a whisper of confidential friend∣ship, that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions; and, that Friti∣gern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty, unless he found him∣self supported by the presence, and terrors, of an Imperial army. About the same time, Count Richomer returned from the West, to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni, to inform Valens, that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul; and to request, in the name of Gratian, and of the republic, that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended, till the junction of the two emperors should ensure the success of the Gothic war. But the feeble sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy. He disdained the importunate advice; he rejected the humiliating aid; he secretly compared the ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his own reign, with the fame of a beardless youth; and Valens rushed into the field, to erect his ima∣ginary trophy, before the diligence of his col∣league could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.</P>

By some mistake of the orders, or some ignorance of the ground, the right wing, or column of cavalry, arrived in sight of the enemy, whilst the left was still at a considerable distance; the soldiers were com∣pelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to preci∣pitate their pace; and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion, and irregular delay. The Gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country; and Friti∣gern still continued to practise his customary arts. He dispatched messengers of peace, made pro∣posals, required hostages, and wasted the hours, till the Romans, exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun, were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and intolerable fatigue. The emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the Go∣thic camp; the zeal of Richomer, who alone had courage to accept the dangerous commission,
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
was applauded: and the count of the domestics, adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity, had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies, when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle. The hasty and imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian, who commanded a body of archers and targetteers; and as they advanced with rashness, they retreat∣ed with loss and disgrace. In the same moment, the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose return was anxiously expected by the ge∣neral of the Goths, descended like a whirlwind from the hills, swept across the plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous, but irresistible, charge of the Barbarian host. The event of the battle of Hadrianople, so fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be described in a few words: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The defeat of the Ro∣mans.</NOTE> the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry was aban∣doned, surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful evolutions, the firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot, encompassed, on an open plain, by superior numbers of horse: but the troops of Valens, oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a narrow space, where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords and javelins. In the midst of tumult, of slaugh∣ter, and of dismay, the emperor, deserted by his guards, and wounded, as it was supposed, with an arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii, who still maintained their
<PB N="410" REF="417"/>
ground with some appearance of order and firm∣ness. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who perceived his danger, loudly exclaimed, that all was lost, unless the person of the emperor could be saved. Some troops, animated by their exhortation, advanced to his relief: they found only a bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince, either among the living, or the dead. Their search could not indeed be successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the emperor. By the care <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the empe∣ror Valens.</NOTE> of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field of battle to a neighbouring cottage, where they attempted to dress his wound, and to pro∣vide for his future safety. But this humble retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy: they tried to force the door; they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof; till at length, impatient of delay, they set fire to a pile of dry faggots, and consumed the cottage, with the Roman emperor and his train. Valens pe∣rished in the flames; and a youth who dropt from the window, alone escaped, to attest the melan∣choly tale, and to inform the Goths of the in∣estimable prize which they had lost by their own rashness. A great number of brave and distin∣guished officers perished in the battle of Hadri∣anople, which equalled, in the actual loss, and far surpassed, in the fatal consequences, the mis∣fortune which Rome had formerly sustained in the

the prudence of the emperor, or who impute the public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in the troops. For my own part, I reverence the memory of their former ex∣ploits: I reverence the glorious death, which they bravely received, standing, and fighting in their ranks: I reverence the field of battle, stained with <HI>their</HI> blood, and the blood of the Barbarians. Those honourable marks have been already washed away by the rains; but the lofty monuments of their bones, the bones of generals, of centurions, and of valiant war∣riors, claim a longer period of duration. The king himself fought and fell in the foremost ranks of the battle. His attendants presented him with the fleetest horses of the Imperial stable, that would soon have carried him be∣yond the pursuit of the enemy. They vainly pressed him to reserve his important life for the future service of the republic. He still declar∣ed, that he was unworthy to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects; and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain. Let none, therefore, presume to ascribe the victory of the Barba∣rians to the fear, the weakness, or the impru∣dence, of the Roman troops. The chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their ancestors, whom they equalled in dis∣cipline, and the arts of war. Their generous emulation was supported by the love of glory, which prompted them to contend at the same

time with heat and thirst, with fire and the sword; and cheerfully to embrace an honour∣able death, as their refuge against flight and infamy. The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of the success of our enemies.</Q> The truth of history may disclaim some parts of this panegyric, which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character of Valens, or the circumstances of the battle: but the fairest commendation is due to the eloquence, and still more to the gene∣rosity, of the sophist of Antioch <NOTE N="95" PLACE="foot">Libanius de ulciscend.

<P>The pride of the Goths was elated by this me∣morable <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Goths besiege Ha∣drianople.</NOTE> victory; but their avarice was disap∣pointed by the mortifying discovery, that the richest part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople. They hastened to pos∣sess the reward of their valour; but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquished army, with an intrepid resolution, which was the effect of their despair, and the only hope of their safety. The walls of the city, and the rainparts of the adjacent camp, were lined with military engines, that threw stones of an enormous weight; and astonished the ignorant Barbarians by the noise, and velocity, still more than by the real effects, of the discharge. The soldiers, the citizens, the provincials, the domestics of the palace, were united in the danger, and in the defence: the surious assault of the Goths was repulsed; their secret arts of treachery and treason were discover∣ed;
<PB N="414" REF="421"/>
and, after an obstinate conflict of many hours, they retired to their tents; convinced, by expe∣rience, that it would be far more adviseable to observe the treaty, which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities. After the hasty and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters, an act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the Roman armies, the Goths indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople. The scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent soli∣tude: the multitude suddenly disappeared; the secret paths of the woods and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling fugi∣tives, who sought a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum and Macedonia: and the faithful officers of the household, and the treasury, cau∣tiously proceeded in search of the emperor, of whose death they were still ignorant. The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the suburbs of Constantinople. The Barbarians were surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East, the height and extent of the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who crowded the ram∣parts, and the various prospect of the sea and land. While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible beauties of Constantinople, a sally was made from one of the gates by a party of Saracens <NOTE N="96" PLACE="foot">Valens had gained, or rather purchased, the friendship of the Saracens, whose vexatious inroads were felt on the borders of Phoe∣nicia, Palestine, and Egypt.

But the Saint is surely transported beyond the limits of nature and history, when he affirms, <Q>that, in those desert countries, nothing was left except the sky and the earth; that, after the destruc∣tion of the cities, and the extirpation of the human race, the land was overgrown with thick forests, and inextricable brambles; and that the universal desolation, announced by the prophet Zephaniah, was accomplished, in the scarcity of the beasts, the birds, and even of the fish.</Q> These complaints were pronounced about twenty years after the death of Valens; and the Illyrian provinces, which were constantly ex∣posed to the invasion and passage of the Barba∣rians, still continued, after a calamitous period of ten centuries, to supply new materials for ra∣pine and destruction. Could it even be supposed, that a large tract of country had been left with∣out cultivation and without inhabitants, the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated nature.

of the forest, his enemies, or his victims, would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of their solitary domain. The various tribes that people the air, or the waters, are still less con∣nected with the fate of the human species; and it is highly probable, that the fish of the Danube would have felt more terror and distress, from the approach of a voracious pike, than from the hostile inroad of a Gothic army.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the just measure of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacre of the Gothic youth in Asia, A. D. 378.</NOTE> the calamities of Europe, there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia. The sons of the Goths had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the East; and the arts of education were employed, to polish, and subdue, the na∣tive fierceness of their temper. In the space of about twelve years, their numbers had continually increased; and the children, who, in the first emigration, were sent over the Hellespont, had attained, with rapid growth, the strength and spirit of perfect manhood <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">Eunapius (in Excorpt.

It was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation, they betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intention, to emulate the glorious example of their fathers. The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials;
<PB N="419" REF="426"/>
and these suspicions were admitted as unquestion∣able evidence, that the Goths of Asia had form∣ed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety. The death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign; and Julius, who filled the important station of master-general of the troops, with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople; which he considered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the repre∣sentative council of the nation. As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic, he assembled the principal officers; and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design. An order was immediately promulgated, that, on a stated day, the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces; and, as a report was industriously circulated, that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money, the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and perhaps suspended the mo∣tions of the conspiracy. On the appointed day, the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the square, or Forum: the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman troops; and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers. At the same hour, in all the cities of the East, the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the provinces of Asia were delivered, by the cruel prudence of

<P>The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The empe∣ror Gra∣tian invests Theodosius with the empire of the East, A. D. 379. Jan. 19.</NOTE> march towards the plains of Hadrianople, when he was informed, at first by the confused voice of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate reports of Victor and Richomer, that his impa∣tient colleague had been slain in battle, and that two-thirds of the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths. Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve, the resentment of a gene∣rous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion: and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic. Gratian was too late to assist, he was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world. A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst
<PB N="421" REF="428"/>
over the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was oppressed, and distracted, by the ad∣ministration of the Western Empire. In this important crisis, the government of the East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution, of con∣ferring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an insult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it is not easy for a prince, edu∣cated in the supreme rank, to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals. He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits and defects; and, whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition, he dis∣trusted the cautious wisdom, which despaired of the republic. As each moment of delay dimi∣nished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The choice of Gratian was soon declared in favour of an exile, whose father, only three years before, had suffered, under the sanction of <HI>his</HI> authority, an unjust and ignominious death. The great Theodosius, a name celebrated in history, and dear to the Catholic Church <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">A life of Theodosius the Great was composed in the last century (Paris 1679, in 4to; 1680, in 12mo), to inflame the mind of the young Dauphin with Catholic zeal.

They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honours by the active spirit of the elder Theo∣dosius, a general, whose exploits in Britain and Africa have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian.

His own merit, and the recom∣mendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon raised him to a separate command: and, in the station of Duke of Maesia, he vanquished an army of

His rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his illus∣trious father; and Theodosius obtained, as a favour, the permission of retiring to a private life, in his native province of Spain. He dis∣played a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he adapted himself to this new situa∣tion. His time was almost equally divided be∣tween the town and country: the spirit, which had animated his public conduct, was shewn in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty; and the diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony <NOTE N="111" PLACE="foot">Pacatus (in Panegyr.

similar example, of an elevation, at the same time, so pure, and so honourable. The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their fathers, claim and enjoy a legal right, the more secure, as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters. The subjects, who, in a monarchy, or a popular state, acquire the pos∣session of supreme power, may have raised them∣selves, by the superiority either of genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals: but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy, or civil war. Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague, or a successor, his partial choice, which may be influenced by the blindest passions, is often directed to an un∣worthy object. But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius, in his obscure soli∣tude of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the hopes, of an ambitious statesman; and the name of the Exile would long since have been forgot∣ten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the Imperial court. During the season of prosperity, he had been ne∣glected; but, in the public distress, his superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged. What confidence must have been reposed in his integrity, since Gratian could trust, that a pious son would forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of his father! What expectations must have been formed of his abilities, to encourage the hope, that a single man could save, and re∣store,

The vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face, and the graceful majesty of his person, which they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the em∣peror Trajan; whilst intelligent observers dis∣covered, in the qualities of his heart and under∣standing, a more important resemblance to the best and greatest of the Roman princes.</P>

of the reign of Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zosimus, by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles, by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical wri∣ters, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation. Conscious of these disadvantages, which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I shall proceed with doubtful and timo∣rous steps. Yet I may boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians; and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observa∣tion of the condition and circumstances of the times. The fabric of a mighty state, which has been reared by the labours of successive ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the cala∣mity. The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East, which contained so many millions of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest, and most common, quality of human nature; and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe, might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions. If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses,
<PB N="428" REF="435"/>
and equipped with the armour, of their vanquish∣ed enemies, the numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry; the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms; and the wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expences of the war. But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians, and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the lat∣ter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A Gothic chief was heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for his own part, he was fa∣tigued with slaughter; but that he was astonished how a people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could still presume to dispute the pos∣session of their treasures and provinces <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot">Chrysostom, tom. i. p. 344. edit.

success. But the <HI>great</HI> Theodosius, an epithet which he honourably deserved on this moment∣ous occasion, conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his head-quarters at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian diocese <NOTE N="117" PLACE="foot">See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws. Codex Theodos. tom. i. Prolegomen. p. xcix—civ.</NOTE>; from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians, and direct the operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic. The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened; and the troops, among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived, were insensibly emboldened by the con∣fidence of their own safety. From these secure stations, they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested the adja∣cent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage, without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of numbers, their enterprises were, for the most part, successful; and they were soon convinced, by their own experience, of the possibility of vanquishing their <HI>invincible</HI> enemies. The detachments of these separate garrisons were gradually united into small armies; the same cautious measures were pursued, accord∣ing to an extensive and well-concerted plan of operations; the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the most favourable reports of the success of the war,
<PB N="430" REF="437"/>
contributed to subdue the pride of the Barba∣rians, and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects. If, instead of this faint and imper∣fect outline, we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius, in four suc∣cessive campaigns, there is reason to believe, that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader. The republic had for∣merly been saved by the delays of Fabius: and, while the splendid trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity, the camps and marches of the Dictator among the hills of Campania, may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame, which the general is not compelled to share, either with fortune or with his troops. Such was likwise the merit of Theodosius; and the infirmities of his body, which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease, could not oppress the vigour of his mind, or divert his attention from the public service <NOTE N="118" PLACE="foot">Most writers insist on the illness, and long repose, of Theodosius, at Thessalonica: Zosimus, to diminish his glory; Jornandes, to favour the Goths; and the ecclesiastical writers, to introduce his baptism.</NOTE>.</P>

by fortune; and the emperor never failed to seize, and to improve, every favourable cir∣cumstance. As long as the superior genius of Fritigern preserved the union, and directed the motions, of the Barbarians, their power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire. The death of that hero, the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric, relieved an im∣patient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion. The Barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority, abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their passions were seldom uniform, or consistent. An army of conquerors was broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves, than to their enemies. Their mischievous disposition was shewn in the destruc∣tion of every object, which they wanted strength to remove, or taste to enjoy; and they often consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests, or the granaries, which soon afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence. A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations, which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance. The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally up∣braid the flight of the Goths; who were not dis∣posed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune: the ancient jealousy of the Ostro∣goths and the Visigoths could not long be sus∣pended; and the haughty chiefs still remembered
<PB N="432" REF="439"/>
the insults and injuries, which they had recipro∣cally offered, or sustained, while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube. The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity; and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to pur∣chase, with liberal gifts and promises, the retreat, or service, of the discontented party. The ac∣quisition of Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important command; surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed in wine and sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonish∣ed Goths, returned with an immense spoil, and four thousand waggons, to the Imperial camp <NOTE N="120" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. iv. p. 232.) styles him a Scythian, a name which the more recent Greeks seem to have appropriated to the Goths.</NOTE>.

He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part of the subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniencies of anarchy, were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their

But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric; and, instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he wisely listen∣ed to the fair proposal of an honourable and advantageous treaty. Theodosius, who was ac∣quainted with the merit and power of his new ally, condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople; and enter∣tained him in the Imperial city, with the con∣fidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch. <Q>The Barbarian prince observed, with curious attention, the variety of objects which attracted his notice, and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder. I now behold, said he, what I never could believe, the glories of this stupendous capital! and as he cast his eyes around, he viewed, and he admired, the commanding situ∣ation of the city, the strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices, the capacious harbour, crowded with innumerable vessels, the perpetual concourse of distant nations, and the arms and discipline of the troops.

But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death, than he could have ex∣pected from the most faithful services, of his ally. The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his memory; and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy, and decent grief, of Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire <NOTE N="122" PLACE="foot">Jornandes, c. xxviii. p. 650.

Their destructive course was pointed towards the West; but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures. The Ostrogoths impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul; concluded, and soon violated, a treaty with the emperor Gratian; advanced into the unknown countries of the North; and, after an interval of more than four years, returned, with accumulated force, to the banks of the Lower Danube.

The dexterity of the spies, whom he sent into the Gothic camp, allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare. They were per∣suaded, that, by a bold attempt, they might surprise, in the silence and darkness of the night, the sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes <NOTE N="125" PLACE="foot">I am justified, by reason and example, in applying this Indian name to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Barbarians, the single trees hollowed into the shape of a boat, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

The bravest of the Ostro∣goths led the van; the main body consisted of the remainder of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and children securely followed in the rear. One of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design; and they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube, in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing, and an unguarded camp. But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle; a triple line of vessels, strongly connected with each other, and which formed an impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of gallies, which
<PB N="437" REF="444"/>
were urged down the stream by the united im∣pulse of oars and of the tide. The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke, and sunk, and dispersed, the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians: their valour was ineffectual; and Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostro∣goths, perished, with his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or in the waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore: but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable, either of action or counsel; and they soon implored the clemency of the vic∣torious enemy. On this occasion, as well as on many others, it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius. The partial and malignant his∣torian, who misrepresents every action of his reign, affirms, that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valour and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus <NOTE N="126" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. iv. p. 252—255.

The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile, but uncul∣tivated land, for the use of those Barbarians, who might not disdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of the Visigoths was seated in Thrace: the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle; and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years. The Barbarians would have de∣served to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court, if they had suffered them∣selves to be dispersed through the provinces. They required, and they obtained, the sole pos∣session of the villages and districts assigned for their residence; they still cherished and propa∣gated their native manners and language; assert∣ed, in the bosom of despotism, the freedom of

The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war; but the royal dignity was abolished; and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor.

The advocates of Theodosius could affirm, with some appearance of truth and reason, that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes, who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country; and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen. The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect; but the experience of past times might encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits of industry and obe∣dience; that their manners would be polished by time, education, and the influence of Christianity; and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people <NOTE N="132" PLACE="foot">Themistius (Orat. xvi. p. 211, 212.) composes an elaborate and rational apology, which is not, however, exempt from the pue∣rilities of Greek rhetoric.

He tells a long and ridiculous story of the adventurous prince, who roved the country with only five horsemen, of a spy whom they detected, whipped, and killed in an old woman's cottage, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The public apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion, that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion, but the result of deep and premeditated design. It was ge∣nerally believed, that the Goths had signed the treaty of peace with an hostile and insidious spirit; and that their chiefs had previously bound them∣selves, by a solemn and secret oath, never to keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the fairest shew of loyalty and friendship, and to watch the favourable moment of rapine, of conquest,

and of revenge. But, as the minds of the Bar∣barians were not insensible to the power of gra∣titude, several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the emperor: the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions, and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute, to compare the obligations of their first, and second, engagements. The Goths, who considered themselves as the friends of peace, of justice, and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honourable youth, distinguished above the rest of his coun∣trymen, by the politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and the mild virtues of social life. But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf, who inflamed the passions, and asserted the independ∣ence, of his warlike followers. On one of the solemn festivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table, they were in∣sensibly heated by wine, till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect; and betrayed, in the presence of Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes. The emperor, who had been the reluctant witness of this extra∣ordinary controversy, dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon dismissed the tumultuous assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival, whose departure from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war, boldly followed him; and, drawing his

sword, laid Priulf dead at his feet. Their com∣panions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial guards <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Compare Eunapius (in Excerpt. Legat. p. 21, 22.) with Zosi∣mus (l. iv. p. 279.). The difference of circumstances and names must undoubtedly be applied to the same story. Fravitta, or Tra∣vitta, was afterwards consul (A. D. 401.), and still continued his faithful service to the eldest son of Theodosius (Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 467.).</NOTE>. Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage, which disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius, the public safety seem∣ed to depend on the life and abilities of a single man <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">Les Goths ravagerent tout depuis le Danube jusqu'au Bos∣phore; exterminerent Valens et son armée; et ne repasserent le Da∣nube, que pour abandonner l'affreuse solitude qu'ils avoient faite (Oeuvres de Montesquieu, tom. iii. p. 479; Considerations sur les <HI>Causes</HI> de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Romains, c. xvii.). The president Montesquieu seems ignorant, that the Goths, after the defeat of Valens, <HI>never</HI> abandoned the Roman territory. It is now thirty years, says Claudian (de Bello Getico, 166, &amp;c. A. D. 404.),
