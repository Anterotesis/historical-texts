<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following historical
Essays were written as a
Sequel to one bearing the same
Title, published some time
since in the <HI>Craftsman,</HI> and
communicated to that Author;
but he having neglected to give
them to the Publick, I have
thought fit to become the Edi∣tor
myself. Whether Mr. <HI>d'
Anvers</HI> esteems other Subjects
more seasonable at this time;
whether he has been intimida∣ted
with Prosecutions, or sof∣ten'd
with Applications, I do
not take upon me to determine.
<PB REF="4"/>
I have the Pleasure only to as∣sure
the Reader, that I have
faithfully collected the Facts
that are related in these little
Tracts, as they have fallen out
from time to time, and shall
continue to have a watchful
Eye over the Actions of our
Steward, and to record them
for the Benefit of Posterity, that
those who come after us at
least may be deterr'd by this
Example, from intrusting the
Management of their Estates
to bad Hands. The Memoria∣list
furnishes Materials for the
Historian, and so far he has a
right to share in his Fame. Per∣haps
the Character of this most
remarkable Steward may, by
my means, be preserved thus to
<PB REF="5"/>
future Times; the Indulgence
of this Vanity, and the Consci∣ousness
of having done what
was in my Power to expose a
corrupt Servant, is all the Re∣ward
I claim; as a Man has
some little Pretence to Merit
from the Publick, who only
crys out, <HI>Stop Thief.</HI></P>
<P>But before I take leave of my
Readers, I humbly intreat, as
they desire to be thought can∣did,
or courteous, or to be o∣bliged
with any other Epithets,
that the most complaisant Wri∣ter
ever gave them, That they
will be so good not to force the
Letters in the following Pages,
to convey to them any other
Meanings than what they stand
<PB REF="6"/>
for in the Order they are there
placed, it being the Nature of
the Twenty-four Letters in our
Alphabet, as I am inform'd,
when they are transposed, to
give to the Reader what Ideas
the Transposer pleases; so
large is the Field of Innuen∣do's:
This Caution might per∣haps
at any other Time or
Place than this appear ridicu∣lous;
but as some People are
very tender, and others very
censorious, I thought this not
an unnecessary Advertisement.</P>

<HEAD>TO

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE the Happiness to be
Tenant to Sir <HI>George English,</HI>
and there is not one among
them who has a more hearty
Affection for him and his
whole Family, than I have. When this Estate
(which he now enjoys, and which, Hea∣ven
grant, he and his may long enjoy) was
first left to him, by the general Attorn∣ment
of the Tenants, and the Consent
and Act of brave Sir <HI>William,</HI> his An∣cestor,
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
I had the pleasure, as a Witness and
a Tenant, to sign the Instrument my
self: I saw good Sir <HI>William</HI> ratify it, I be∣held
him soon after expire, and could
discern a pleasing Satisfaction in his Fea∣tures,
rising from the Comfort he received
in having finished what he believed must
make his Tenants the happiest and most
easy of any People in our whole County.
You will forgive me, Sir, that I thus
dwell on the Praise of my good old
Master Sir <HI>William:</HI> He was a Man who
loved his whole Species, who had a ge∣neral
Benevolence to Mankind; he did
not think any Man was born for himself
alone, nor could he bear to see any of his
neighbouring Landlords use their Te∣nants
ill, or rack them too high; and more
than once he has engaged himself in ex∣pensive
Law-suits, to deliver them from
the Hands of the Oppressor. Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI>
of whom I now complain to you, Sir,
was one of the Tenants; and tho' his lit∣tle
Copy-hold was then not much in re∣pair,
and a little incumbered with Debts,
however it has been since improved, he
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
professed himself very zealous, as well as
the rest of us, in the Interest of our Land∣lord,
and continued so some Years: But
Time proves every thing; and a very lit∣tle
while after he was appointed Steward
to our old Master, he began to shew
himself; and tho' the Affairs of Sir <HI>George</HI>
grew every day worse and worse under
his Management, the Affairs of Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> grew better and better every day.
He began to look plump and round; his
little Farm was clear of all Incum∣brances;
his Family, his Friends, his
Relations, his Acquaintance, all grew
plump likewise, and flourished under his
Influence: He had indeed been very libe∣ral
to them, not out of his own Money,
but his Master's; He put them into all
the Employments he could find in the
several Manors, and very frequently,
when there was no Employment rea∣dy,
or open, or unenjoy'd by any Re∣lation,
Friend, or Dependent of his, he
was ready to erect an Office, and to
give it a Name and an Appointment out
of his Master's Rents, without any Con∣sideration
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
how much his Master was in
debt, how detrimental it must prove to
his Estate, or how ungrateful it was to
the Tenants, who saw, and murmured to
see, that their Farms were racked to the
highest, to support the Family, and
other Self-Interests of Mr. <HI>Lyn.</HI> Well,
Sir, our Steward grew rich, he grew am∣bitious
and vain, and haughty, and
humorous; and now took it into his
Head, that he was as accomplish'd a
Gentleman even as Sir <HI>George</HI> himself,
and would needs be stiled his <HI>Compa∣nion:</HI>
He dress'd himself up in Blue,
and used to strut about in Pearl Co∣lour
Stockings, a Silk Doublet, and a
Cap and Feather, and fancy'd he had
enrolled himself among Heroes and
Gods, so hard it is for a Man in
Prosperity to check the Folly of a vain
Mind; some time before this whim
of bedecking himself in Taffaty and
Blue, he had a Fancy to appear in
Red; and accordingly one Morning
with a very solemn and grave Counte¦nance,
he told several of his Intimate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
that now he was grown rich, he was resol∣ved
to devote himself to the Service of
Religion, as a Knight-Errant; that he
would rescue Virgins, protect Orphans,
destroy Giants, and do every thing praise-worthy,
and becoming the great Office of
true Chivalry; he exhorted his Friends
likewise, who were very honest Men,
and meant well, to do the same, and told
them their Habiliments ought to be all a∣like.
viz. Red Taffaty, Spurs, Feathers,
Caps, Faulchions, &amp;c. So said, so done,
they dress'd themselves, they swore on the
Evangelists to be good and true Knights,
they march'd in an affected Stage-strut
round the Town, and made a Shew in their
whimsical Dresses that set all the Parish in
a Gape. Now one wou'd imagine that
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> was about to make amends for all
his Mismanagement, and that the World,
as it had been the worse for him, would
be the better too: But this was only a Joke
it seems; for as soon as ever he had persuad∣ed
his Companions to this, on a sudden he
whipt off his Red Taffaty Doublet, and
put on a blue one, as I have said, and
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
called himself his Master's Fellow, to the
great Surprize of every one. But these
Frolicks, you will say, might only take
Birth from the jocund Levities of a Head
a little giddy with Prosperity, the plaisom
Gaities, the <HI>dulce desipere</HI> of a Heart swol∣len
with Joy and Power. We will go on
then to consider him only in his Character
of Steward.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>LYN</HI> was no sooner got into the
Stewardship, but he with very great As∣surance
told his Master, that none of his
Tenants had any hearty Affection for him,
but himself and his Sons, his Brother
<HI>Townly</HI> and his Sons, with their Rela∣tions
and Intimates; that if it were not
for his and their Management, Sir <HI>George</HI>
would not be able to make any thing of
the Estate. And <HI>Isaac Tombrel,</HI> a Re∣lation
to a Relation of Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s by
Marriage, had the Assurance to affirm be∣fore
young Squire <HI>English,</HI> Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
eldest Son, at Dinner at the Mansion
House in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> that the Preser∣vation
of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s whole Estate
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
was owing to Mr. <HI>Lyn;</HI> for which, and
other unmannerly and indecent Expres∣sions,
he was rebuked, disgraced, and
sent back into <HI>Norfolk.</HI> Indeed Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>
used frequently in publick to applaud
himself for his good Management of the
Estate, and to pronounce himself with
great Authority, the only Man in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
who knew how to keep a Rental.
He went farther, and frequently declared
that was it not for him, and his great Art
and Skill, the Tenants would not pay their
Rents, that they would forget all Respect
and Duty to Sir <HI>George,</HI> or join with Squire
<HI>Welsh</HI> in the Law-suit against him. Tho'
Squire <HI>Welsh</HI> and his Law-suit and Prenten∣sions
were very low and despised, and al∣most
forgot by every body; yet Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> always endeavour'd to make his court
to his Master, by assuring him, that seve∣ral
of his Tenants, those I mean who held
the largest Farms, and whose Hearts were
always with Sir <HI>George,</HI> were secretly Fa∣vourers
of the Pretensions of Mr. <HI>Wel∣sh;</HI>
this, Sir, indeed appears to me one of Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<HI>Lyn</HI>'s greatest Iniquities, as I think a Pick-thank
in a Family is most odious Character.
But he was resolved to support his Power
at the Expence of every thing; and now
finding himself, as he imagin'd, at least in
Trust and Confidence with his Master,
(which we his poor Tenants hope is not real∣ly
the Case) he raised his Crest, and threw
out his natural Bronze. And as Insolence
is ever the Mark of a little Mind, tho'
conscious to himself of more Crimes than
any Man but himself can discover, he
slighted his Superiors and despised his Op∣ponents.
The Parish-Officers, the Asses∣sors
and Collectors of the Land-Tax, the
Constables, Portreve, and Jurymen, were
all his Creatures, Relations, Dependents
or Subdependents, such whose Corrup∣tion
and Consciences he could depend up∣on.
Thus furnished, thus guarded and
supported, he ventur'd on, he levy'd Mo∣ney
upon the Tenants on the most ridicu∣lous
Pretence: an old Bridge was to be re∣paired,
a new one to be built, the Parish
wanted a Set of Bells, a new Pair of
Stocks must be provided; he made them
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
contribute to the keeping several Packs
of Hounds; and sometimes Master <HI>Lyn</HI>
wou'd demand a round Sum of Money
for private Uses, and such as were by
no means proper to be known to the Te∣nants.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>George</HI> has a Park where his Te∣nants
have Time out of Mind been per∣mitted
to recreate and refresh at leisure
Hours, as often as they pleased; and
thro' this Park many of them are oblig'd
to pass every Day to their Grounds; Mr.
<HI>Lyn,</HI> who valued himself on his Genius for
raising Money, order'd his own Man to
stand before the Park-Gate, and levy a
Penny for the Passage of every Man, when
Business or Diversions oblig'd him to pass
that way; and this too under the Pretence
of setting up a pair of Gates only, tho' the
Money levy'd would new pale the whole
Park. And this I mention only to shew
you how ready he is at Undertakings of
this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
HOWEVER, notwithstanding all
the Discouragements that the Tenants lay
under, they might have thriven even under
the Stewardship of Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> if he had
not with the utmost Art and Application
laboured to prevent it. The two greatest
and known Enemies to Industry and Trade,
are Luxury and Gaming: these he careful∣ly
encouraged; and in order to this, he in∣vited
the Tenants to a large Gaming-table
which had been erected indeed in another
<HI>Robinocracy,</HI> in the very middle of the
Market-Place. To this Gaming-table the
Tenants, when they had disposed of their
Wooll, their Corn, &amp;c. all hurry'd; and
as there is in most Men a Lust after inordi∣dinate
Gain, many of them play'd, and
every Day left behind them the Labours of
their Industry. But Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> ever pro∣vident
for himself, took care that this should
turn to his Advantage; for (tho' he never
appeared there himself) he always employ'd
a few faithful Confidents to play for him,
and allow'd them to share in some Parts of
the Spoil. It was always his Method when
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
he play'd thus by Deputy, to use loaded
Dice, either high or low as he fancy'd; and
when some of the Tenants, who by dear
Experience were now grown very peery,
observ'd Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s Dice in play, they
would very artfully, as they imagin'd, set
their Dice accordingly; that is, if they ob∣served
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> used high Dice, they set
expecting them to run high, and so low,
when they saw his Dice run low; but when
the Stakes were deep enough to invite Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI>'s Acceptance, they were always invi∣sibly
changed upon them; and he was by
this ingenious Artifice Master of Part of
the Property of the Tenants. And as of∣ten
as he pleased, by this he amassed Wealth,
by this means the Manufactures of our
Country are very much hurt, and our Trade
decreases. This is at present the Case un∣der
our most righteous Steward; and they
tell me, there is nothing he delights in at
this Hour, so much as Gaming by Proxy,
and Fox-Hunting.</P>

<HEAD>TO

The HISTORY of the
NORFOLK STEWARD.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II. Containing a farther Account of Mr. Lyn's
Management; and also of his Method of
Stating and Ballancing Accounts.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe my <HI>last</HI> hath convinc'd you that
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s management of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
<HI>Domestick Affairs,</HI> was full as extraordina∣ry
as that of his <HI>Lawsuits</HI> with his <HI>Neigh∣bours.</HI>
But perhaps you will wonder that
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
he should be suffer'd to go on so long in
these Practices; that he hath not been con∣stantly
<HI>presented</HI> every <HI>Court-day</HI> for so ma∣ny
repeated Misdoings; or that even all the
<HI>Tenants</HI> of the <HI>Mannor</HI> do not unanimously
make it their request to Sir <HI>George</HI> (whose
Ears are always open to their Complaints)
that he would be pleased to remove a Stew∣ard
whose Mananagement is generally dis∣liked
and complained of by all the Tenants.
But your Surprize will vanish when you
recollect what I have told you in both my
former Letters; that all the <HI>Prime Officers</HI>
both of the <HI>Parish</HI> and the <HI>Mannor,</HI> as well
as most of the <HI>Jurymen,</HI> were his own <HI>Re∣lations</HI>
or <HI>Creatures;</HI> that a great number of
the <HI>principal Tenants</HI> were bribed into his In∣terest,
and that many others, who had ho∣nest
Intentions, were afraid to oppose a
Man, who had it in his Power to <HI>raise their
Rent, distrain their Goods,</HI> or <HI>turn them out of
their Farms</HI> at Pleasure, by representing them
as <HI>bad Tenants</HI> or <HI>Enemies to their Landlord;</HI>
tho' these very People were the best affect∣ed
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
to their Landlord, tho' they paid their
Rents punctually, and had no other deme∣rit,
but that they faithfully adhered to
what they conceived to be the true Interest
of Sir <HI>George.</HI> In short, it is the peculiar
Character of Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> That when he took
up a Prejudice, however unreasonable, a∣gainst
any of the <HI>Tenants,</HI> he always <HI>made
it a POINT</HI> (as he call'd it) to <HI>ruin</HI> them
with Sir <HI>George,</HI> and stuck at nothing to
compass his End.</P>
<P>YET notwithstanding all this Power,
and this extravagant Use of it, there are
many Persons of considerable Interest and
Figure in the <HI>Mannor,</HI> who have constant∣ly
opposed him in all these Proceedings, and
have, at present, the Pleasure to see a gene∣ral
Spirit of Resentment rising against him.
The Number of his <HI>Opponents</HI> increases dai∣ly;
whilst many, some even of <HI>those,</HI> who
are <HI>obliged</HI> to act with him, are frequently
heard to murmur against his Proceed∣ings,
in publick as well as private; and
others who eat his Bread, as he is inso∣lently
<PB N="I6" REF="21"/>
pleased to call it, Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Bread,
the Tenants Bread he means, hang down
their Heads; and conscious of their Crime
in not opposing his Measures, plead guilty
to the Charge against him in their Silence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Freemen</HI> of the Town, where
Sir <HI>George</HI> lives himself, are heartily, almost
universally, incensed against him, on <HI>divers
Accounts;</HI> particularly for having introdu∣ced
several <HI>New Customs</HI> amongst them;
for always interposing his Authority in their
<HI>Elections of Parish-Officers;</HI> for making
them pay more for their <HI>Fewel</HI> than the rest
of the Tenants; for refusing to read a
<HI>Letter</HI> written in their behalf, on this Ac∣count,
and replying with an insolent Air,
<HI>That he did not care a</HI> F—t <HI>for the whole
Town.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT Numbers of <HI>poor Trades∣men,</HI>
who supplied the late Sir <HI>George</HI>
with Necessaries, are ready to starve for
want of the Money, he died in arrear
to them on that Account; which is the
more extraordinary, because Sir <HI>George</HI>
had always a sufficient Income to keep
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
a noble Houfe, and pay every body, as
indeed he seem'd always inclinable to do;
from whence they conclude, That Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> embezzled great Sums himself, and
squandered away others, for his own Va∣nity
and Grandeur, amongst a <HI>worse kind
of TRADESMEN</HI> than they are.
Nay, what adds to the Provocation is,
That Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> will not satisfy them <HI>whe∣ther
they shall ever be paid or not.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>neighbouring Country Gentlemen</HI>
complain of him for <HI>engrossing the Game,</HI>
and forbidding them to hunt, or ride in Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s PARKS, as they used to do.</P>
<P>THE Clergy charging him with recom∣mending
Men of slow Parts for Preferment
in the Church to old Sir <HI>George,</HI> when any
<HI>Livings</HI> fell; of which there was a great
Number, during <HI>his Life</HI> and the <HI>Steward∣ship</HI>
of Mr. <HI>Lyn.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Yeomanry</HI> grumble for want of
Money, the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> for want of
Business, and the <HI>poor Labourers</HI> for want of
Bread; and all impute their Misfortunes, I
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
think, after what has been said, not very
unjustly, to Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> by engaging old Sir
<HI>George</HI> in a <HI>needless, expensive</HI> and <HI>chimerical
Law-suit,</HI> and thereby preventing the usual
<HI>Circulation</HI> of Money in Commerce, by di∣verting
it into other <HI>Channels.</HI></P>
<P>IN short, all Ranks of Men (except a
<HI>few particular Creatures</HI> of his own) seem
to have their respective Complaints against
him, and unite in their Wishes for a <HI>new
Steward.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, we have a current Report about
the Country, that our <HI>present Landlord</HI>
(who is a Gentleman of <HI>great Penetration,</HI>
and applies himself very much to <HI>Business</HI>)
hath been, for some time, of the same Opi∣nion
with his <HI>Tenants;</HI> and altho it may not
be convenient to discharge him at present, at
least till his Accounts, which are in the ut∣most
Confusion, are audited and settled, yet
it is certain that he hath already <HI>clipt his
Wings, and so short too,</HI> that he is unable to
take his <HI>former Flights.</HI></P>
<P>THIS hath a little sunk his Crest, and
soften'd his Behaviour to his <HI>Fellow-Tenants,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
tho' he still endeavours to keep up his usual
Spirit of <HI>Defiance;</HI> but we can easily ob∣serve,
from the frequent <HI>Tremulation of his
Voice, the faultring of his Accents, his Loss
of Temper and Confusion in his Sentences,</HI> that
he is inwardly very much <HI>chagrined</HI> and <HI>di∣sturb'd.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may remember, I told you, in my
<HI>first,</HI> that Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Estate (when he came
to it) was charged with an <HI>heavy Debt:</HI> And
that when Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> was call'd upon to give
an Account of the <HI>great Sums of Money,</HI>
which had passed thro' his Hands, he always
refused to do it, and endeavoured to make a
Jest of <HI>those</HI> who demanded it. But at length,
the general Clamour obliged him to consent
to <HI>some Examination;</HI> upon which it appears,
even by his <HI>own Account,</HI> that his Master's
Estate is so far from being the <HI>better</HI> for his
Management, according to his <HI>former re∣peated
Declarations,</HI> that it is <HI>several hundred
Pounds more in debt,</HI> than it was before he
came into the <HI>Stewardship,</HI> notwithstanding
the <HI>great Sums</HI> which ought to have been
<HI>yearly</HI> applied towards paying it off.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25"/>
BUT his <HI>manner of stating Accounts</HI> is
so very extraordinary, that I believe you
will think it worth relating.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> hath always boasted, that the
<HI>Family-Debt</HI> was very much <HI>diminished</HI>
within these <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>eleven Years</HI> past, and <HI>de∣fied</HI>
his Enemies to prove the contrary.
Now, in order to see whether this was true
or not, it was proposed, first, to state the
<HI>Debt,</HI> as it stood <HI>eleven</HI> Years ago, <HI>is all its
Branches.</HI> Then to deduct from it the se∣veral
<HI>yearly Sums,</HI> which have, or ought to
have been paid out of a certain <HI>strong Box,</HI>
where the Savings from the Rents, after the
Expences of the Family were paid, were
constantly laid up, to discharge part of the
Mortgage upon the Estate, as it was appoint∣ed
to do since <HI>that time;</HI> and afterwards to
compute the <HI>whole Debt, of every kind,</HI> which
the <HI>Family</HI> owes at <HI>present.</HI> It was agreed,
I think, that the <HI>Debt, eleven</HI> Years ago,
amounted to about 51000 <HI>l.</HI> The <HI>strong
Box</HI> was said to have produced, since <HI>that
time,</HI> about 7000 <HI>l.</HI> which reduces the Debt
(had no <HI>farther Debt</HI> been incurred, as the
Phrase in vogue is) to 44000; and, in what∣ever
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
degree the <HI>present Debt</HI> should appear to
be <HI>less than that Sum,</HI> so much, and no more,
ought to be allowed to be <HI>really diminished,</HI>
since <HI>that Time,</HI> by the Management of Mr.
<HI>Lyn;</HI> since he could not pretend to arrogate
to himself the Merit of <HI>paying any Sums,
which would have paid themselves</HI> had he let
them alone.</P>
<P>THIS seem'd to be a fair <HI>Proposal,</HI> as it
was generally esteemed; but fair as it was,
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> demurred to it. At first, indeed, he
crack'd, bluster'd, and defy'd, as usual; at
length, with much Difficulty, he agreed to
give in some Account. Accordingly he
gave in his <HI>own State of the Account;</HI> and a
Day was appointed for the <HI>Enquiry;</HI> when
that came, he made a <HI>considerable Alteration</HI>
in his own Account. And having after∣wards
acknowledged <HI>that he had quite forgot
several other considerable Sums of the Debt
contracted,</HI> he run his usual Circle; he as∣serted,
affirmed, deny'd, was positive, was
every thing but intelligible; he talk'd in
short till he had not only made himself but
many of his Hearers giddy. There is not,
perhaps, so great a Master in <HI>Europe</HI> of the

grand Art of Bambousle as Mr. <HI>Lyn:</HI> The
Debt (said he) is incurred, but not increa∣sed;
there are real Debts and nominal Debts;
there are real nominal Debts, and nominal
real Debts; there were real Debts and per∣sonal
Debts, which the Family must pay;
there are Debts never-stated tho 'incurred,
and Debts which tho' incurred and stated,
might never be paid; so that upon the whole
you see I have paid off a considerable part of
the Mortgage upon Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Estate: But
when he was told, that tho' it was true that
part of the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Mortgage was paid off,
yet Sir <HI>George</HI> was really now as much in
debt as before, because Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> to per∣form
this mighty Deed, had borrow'd just
as much upon Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Estate in <HI>Leicester∣shire,</HI>
as he had paid off in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> so that
the Ballance continued as before; he broke
into a loud Laugh, and told the Tenants they
knew nothing of Accounts, nor the diffe∣rence
between a Debt incurred and a Debt
increased.</P>
<P>BY the Help of these <HI>Distinctions,</HI> and
this Jumble of <HI>Sophistries,</HI> he struck off one
Article of <HI>above three thousand Pounds,</HI> which
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
he asserted to be a <HI>very good Bargain to the
Family;</HI> another of almost <HI>two thousand,</HI>
because it was owing to <HI>very bad Manage∣ment;</HI>
and a third of <HI>one thousand,</HI> for no o∣ther
Reason, that I could hear, than that he
did not know how to <HI>justify the contracting</HI>
of it, or in what manner to provide <HI>for its
Payment.</HI></P>
<P>HE had also the Modesty to place <HI>ano∣ther
considerable</HI> Sum amongst the <HI>Debts dis∣charged,</HI>
within <HI>that Time;</HI> which ought
really to have been placed amongst <HI>those in∣curred.</HI></P>
<P>IT is likewise worth observing, that Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> had previously taken care to puzzle and
perplex the <HI>Accounts</HI> as much as possible, in
order to secure himself from <HI>Detection,</HI> by
chopping and changing the <HI>Securities into
different Hands;</HI> borrowing of <HI>one</HI> to pay
off <HI>another;</HI> turning <HI>Interest</HI> into <HI>Principal,</HI>
and <HI>Principal</HI> into <HI>Interest;</HI> with a thousand
other <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Stratagems</HI> of the same kind;
so that he had a manifest Advantage over
<HI>Those</HI> who were not in the <HI>Secret.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29"/>
NAY, what is still more extraordinary,
he stated his Account of <HI>Debts contracted</HI> to
<HI>Christmas last only;</HI> whereas he calculated the
Sum of <HI>Debts discharged</HI> to <HI>Lady-day</HI> next;
a Method of <HI>stating</HI> and <HI>ballancing Accounts,</HI>
which was never before practised or heard of
in these Parts!</P>
<P>AND yet after all these <HI>Finesses</HI> and <HI>Fal∣lacies,</HI>
and <HI>arbitrary Postulata,</HI> the <HI>present
Family-Debt</HI> evidently appear'd to be, just
as it was <HI>eleven</HI> Years ago, <HI>fifty one thousand
Pounds,</HI> or thereabouts.</P>
<P>THO' it is generally believed here, that
this Affair will not redound much to the
Credit of Mr. <HI>Lyn;</HI> yet it must be con∣fessed,
that his <HI>Arithmetical Capacity</HI> is really
admirable, and that he hath proved him∣self,
beyond all Contradiction, to be a
complete Master of <HI>Addition,</HI> as well as
<HI>Substraction.</HI></P>
<P>To be continued as the Steward goes on.</P>
