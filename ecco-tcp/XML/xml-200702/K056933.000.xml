<HEAD>An Historical Account of the Bitter Sufferings
and Melancholly Circumstances of the Epis∣copal
Church in Scotland, under the Bar∣barous
Usage and Bloody Persecution of the
Presbyterian Church Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is neither to Answer the Clamours of those, who Rail
at the <HI>Scots</HI> in General, nor to Vindicate the Church
or Nation in that part of <HI>Britain,</HI> against the Out-Cries
and Complaints of the Episcopal Party, that
this Tract is at this time made publick.</P>
<P>The first of these deserves no Answer, being Noise with∣out
Ground, and Clamour without Fact, and will, as al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
such Furious Inconsistent Escapes generally do, die with
Time. The second needs no Answer, that Party being fully
Answer'd, and fairly Silenced already, partly by the Con∣viction
of their own Consciences, and compleatly by the late
Reverend and Worthy Doctor <HI>Rule</HI> Principal of the College
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in his Answer to five Pamphlets printed in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣half of the Episcopal Clergy.</P>
<P>But this Design seems to me equally necessary, both to the
Protestant Interest in this Island, and to the general Peace
which every good Man wishes and hopes for among us, and
which, by the late happy Union, seems nearer in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Ap∣proach
to us: And in order to which, I thought it a very
useful piece of Work, to state the Matter of Fact between the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Dissenters there, and enquire
into some things, in which the World has been not a little
imposed upon.</P>
<P>I do confess, when I came first into <HI>Scotland,</HI> I was in no∣thing
more surprized, than in the Matter of the Dissenters▪
I had, with the Generality of People in <HI>England,</HI> always be∣liev'd,
tho I had wisht it otherwise, that the Episcopal Cler∣gy
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
in <HI>Scotland</HI> were intirely deposed and supprest, persecuted,
and not permitted to keep up any Form of a Separation in
Religious Matters.</P>
<P>And I think my self oblig'd to enter into this Case, not
only to do the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> Justice, and defend her a∣gainst
her Enemies, but to defend her against her Friends:
If a Rake or a Scoundrel ill-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat me, I think it not worth
my notice, 'tis below my Concern, he does it because he is a
Rake and a Scoundrel, and the Slander goes but a little way;
But if a Man of Virtue, a Man of Sense, a Man of Religi∣on,
if a good man censures me; I am concerned at it on a
Twofold Account, 1. Because his Mistake will Wound me
with other Good Men, and make the Slander be believed. 2.
Because I am willing to undeceive him, and prevent his Ex∣posing
himself in his Reproaching me, of which, when it
shall appear I am Innocent, he will be Ashamed, and 'tis a
Friendship to him, to prevent his Blushes.</P>
<P>That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has carryed it with great Heat,
and rigid Severity (to put it now in the softest Terms I can)
towards the Episcopal Clergy Dissenting from them, and
Deposed by them at the Revolution, is the Charge I have al∣ways
met with against them: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d this is not only published
in Print, with Aggravations, Exclamations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by their
own Party, and that in several Pamphlets, and industri∣ously
spread over <HI>England,</HI> and which I esteem worst of all,
it has pass'd too much for granted, and been too much re∣ceived
and believed among the best sort of People in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
Friends to the Constitution, and Friends to the Esta∣blishment
of Religion in that Kingdom, who, tho they do
not take all for granted by whole Sale, which Noisy and
Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orous People have published, yet having never seen any
Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ick Vindication, or Direct Answer to these Charges,
are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ught to believe so much of it, as makes them enter∣tain
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ustly a too mean Opinion of their Brethren in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>To undeceive such, is worth any honest Mans while, and
tho I am perfectly a Volunteer in this Work on all sides, I
am perswaded the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Reverend the
Ministers of that Church, cannot think it a needless Under∣taking,
to let them right in the Judgment of those, with
whom they are now more nearly joyn'd, and cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sser al∣lyed
than ever, and to remove, as far as possible, all Causes
of Jealousy, Coldness, or Want of Charity between those,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
who are so nearly knit both in Religious Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, as Pro∣testants,
and also in Civil Interest, as to Safety, Liberty, and
Right.</P>
<P>The Honest, but pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iudiced People in <HI>England,</HI> who have
been imposed upon, by the publick Cryes of Sufferings,
Persecutions, Cruelties, and Merciless Usage of the Episcopal
Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will, I doubt not, be pleased to be unde∣ceived,
and be glad to restore the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to their
entire Charity and good Opinion, and to have that Damp
removed, which they had, on good Ground, as they supposed,
felt on their Thoughts, when they believed, that the Excesses
pretended to had Truth enough in them to merit real Blame,
and that the Warmth of Northern Zeal had carryed the <HI>Scots</HI>
beyond that Moderation, which is the Beauty and Glory of
the Protestant Religion, and which I doubt not to make
appear, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has given Reason to believe, she
at this time practises, <HI>and from the Revolution to this time has
done as much as any Church in the World.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis for these Reasons I write, 'tis for the sake of these this
Book is published, 'tis to undeceive the Friends to Truth and
the Lovers of Peace, to remove the Prejudices of those that
wou'd be inform'd, not of those that seek to be imposed up∣on,
and hunt about for Subject to Cavil and Debate: 'Tis to
clear up the Reputation of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> among her
Friends, not among her Enemies, among the Friends to Re∣ligion
in <HI>England,</HI> and among the Protestant Churches Abroad,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his is the Reason of this Work, and the Author professes to
have no other Design.</P>
<P>Not but that it may also serve to stop the Mouths of some
People, who, with an Uncharitable Zeal, have rais'd a Cloud,
and cast Dirt on the Establisht Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> on this Ac∣count,
and perhaps they may here find some Occasion to alter
their Measures, and, with respect to their own Reputation,
change their Note; For it always weakens the Reputation of
either Person or Party, to assert Falshoods, to raise Stories, that
must, if Examined into, appear to be forged, and contrived
only to Defame.</P>
<P>Slander always flyes back upon the Head of the Slanderer,
and first or last the Dirt he throws at others sticks upon him∣self,
at least leaves some of the Filth behind it, when Time,
Truth, and Innocence clears up the Reputation of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.</P>
<P>When therefore these Sheets are a little read and considered
in the World, I make no Question, but several sorts of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
People may find Occasion to Blush: And <HI>I</HI> cannot have so
little Charity, as not to hope they will suffer the Convictions
of Truth in Fact, so far to prevail upon their Reason and
Temper, as to cause them to detest the Practices of those, who
having not been able, by any legal fair Proceedings, to charge
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with any thing unbecoming her, as a
Christian, a National, or a Protestant Church, have thought
to supply that Defect with the Assistance of most abominable
Slanders, depending upon the Distance of Place and Dark∣ness
of Circumstances, as Difficulties which would obstruct
the Discovery, and at least concluding, it would serve a Turn
for a Time, delude the Ignorant and Uninquiring Part of
the World, and in general, help to make the Reformation
and Establishment in <HI>Scotland</HI> odious and contemptible; and
thereby fix a Prejudice in the People of this Island one against
another, a Temper they had so often Occasion to make use
of, and was so constantly subservient to their Mischievous
Designs, that they could not fail always to reap some Ad∣vantage
by it; Bad is that Cause, that flourishes only in Na∣tional
Confusion, and that is always best propagated by Mis∣chief
and Dissention.</P>
<P>Nor could the Promoters of these things find a better
Handle in the World to take hold of, in order to defame and
render contemptible the <HI>Scots</HI> Presbyterians, than the Charge
of Cruelty and Persecution—. Persecution is a Word par∣ticularly
hateful among Protestants, as what every Protestant
Church in the World has, first or last, been suffering under,
and the Churches of this Island in especial manner.—</P>
<P>When therefore they had gotten hold, as they thought, of
this Matter, they seem'd fully satisfied, that they had the Re∣putation
not of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but of Presbyte∣rians
and Dissenters in general, under Foot—. <HI>First,</HI> To
prove the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> were of persecuting Prin∣ciples,
Cruel and Tyrannical, was the ready way to ruine all
the Prospects of joyning Interests in <HI>England</HI> between them
and the Moderate Church Men, <HI>a thing the High Party foresaw
was coming forward, and which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y knew, if it ever come to pass,
would ruine the High-flying Interest.</HI> And, <HI>secondly,</HI> Nothing
could furnish them with a more plausible ground of Suggest∣ing
this upon the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> than first to charge
it upon the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> directly.</P>
<P>Thus the Charge upon the Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
of being Tyrannical, of a persecuting Spirit, and the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke, serv'd the High Church Cause in <HI>England</HI> a great many
ways; And if we were to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er into the secret History of it,
we should find, that most of this Scandal was both formed
in <HI>England,</HI> and calculated for purposes particular to that
part of <HI>Britain:</HI> The several Pamphlets printed on that Sub∣ject
were all printed in <HI>England,</HI> industriously spread ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and with as much Industry endeavour'd to be concealed in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Service they were to do was in <HI>England,</HI> and
they could in no wise be directly contradicted but from
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis with Regret <HI>I</HI> am oblig'd to acknowledge this Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
of the Party has had but too much Success, <HI>First,</HI> To im∣pose
upon the easy and credulous People of their own Party,
and possess them with a Belief of all the pretended Cruelti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and Violences practised by the Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
upon the Episcopal Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—And by con∣sequence
fill them with prejudice against the Dissenters in
their own Country, as of the same Principle, and only
wanting the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to Exercise it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> But this is not all, nor, <HI>had it been all,</HI> had
this Piece been ever wrote, since the Mischief had been but of
small consequence, and among themselves. But <HI>I</HI> cannot
help observing, in the several Occasions the World has had
of late to speak of <HI>Scotland</HI> more than usual; this has taken
too much root among even the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> and
these of them who have been the best Friends to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
they have been made to believe, there has been at least too
much Truth in the General Charge, and that really the Epis∣copal
Party have been persecuted and severely treated.</P>
<P>Nothing has been more common, than, in talking of these
things, to have the Honest People speak with concern about
it, and bring it out with an, <HI>I wish the</HI> Scots <HI>would use the
Episcopal Party more gently,</HI> and the like, when they have been
told it is otherwise, they would shake their Heads doubting▪
and return, <HI>I am afraid there is some Truth in it:</HI> And to this day,
<HI>I</HI> believe <HI>I</HI> may speak it without any Hesitation, the great∣est
part even of the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> are of this Opinion▪
that the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to really crush, op∣press,
persecute, and use hardly the Ministers of the Episco∣pal
Party.</P>
<P>And indeed, if we consider the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tile of the several Pamph∣lets
written on this Subject, the Assurance of the Authors,
how positively they have asserted things; their strange, yet
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
frequent descending to particulars, which nevertheless were
false in Fact, and how strangely they have imposed upon the
World—And withal, that not any Man, in <HI>England</HI> at
least, has ever formally taken up this Cause, it is no wonder,
that both Friend and Enemy have received Impressions, to the
prejudice of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and have taken up an
Opinion of the Truth of these things, as most certain, and
not to be denyed.</P>
<P>Before <HI>I</HI> enter into the Matter of Fact, as it now stands in
<HI>Scotland, I</HI> think it is very proper to quote a few of the parti∣culars,
which the People, of whom <HI>I</HI> have been speaking,
charge upon the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which they call
Persecution, which, first of all, cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e called Persecution,
if true: And, <HI>secondly,</HI> If they were to be called Persecuti∣on,
can, by no means, be lay'd to the Charge of the Church.</P>
<P>As, <HI>first,</HI> the Violences of the common People upon the
Revolution.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The Deposing the Ministers.</P>
<P>As to the Violences of the Mob, <HI>I</HI> would, by no means,
have <HI>English</HI> Men call that Persecution, because the Rabbles,
in the Affair of the Revolution, were equally Violent in
<HI>England,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and promiscuous in the persons, both
Church of <HI>England</HI> Rabble and Presbyterian Rabble, none
of which can be accused by one another, nor were ever, that
<HI>I</HI> remember, justifyed by either—But no Church Man
ought to Exclaim against a Presbyterian Rabble, lest the Pa∣pist
double it upon him, with a History of the Church
Rabbles upon them, and they should be distinguish'd by this
unhappy Circumstance, that, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Rabbles us∣ed
Violence with those, who had Murther'd their Fathers,
Mothers, and near Relations, who had dipped their Hands
in Blood, and had prompted and appear'd in the greatest
Barbarities, that any Age or Nation can parallel, and had
thereby provoked them to the highest Degree; Whereas, in
<HI>England,</HI> the Rabbles rifled, plundered, and insulted the
Houses, Parks, and Lands of peaceable Gentlemen, who had
been perfectly unconcerned in any of King <HI>James</HI>'s Malver∣sations,
and against whom they had no manner of Objecti∣on,
but that they were <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, or as they call'd it
in others, Disaffected.</P>
<P>For this Reason, <HI>I</HI> would Advise the Gentlemen, that talk
of this as part of the Persecutions they complain of, to leave
it out of the List—and let it ly as an Accident of the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Revolution, and an effect of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ked People, in which Religion had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut that power being given by the Circumstance of the Time, these shewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them the Re∣sentment
of their Bloody Treatment, in a manner, however
violent and unjustifyable, yet much short of what they had
really deserved; and still more short of what they might rea∣sonably
have expected.</P>
<P>Let all the Excesses of the Multitude therefore ly buried
under the same Charity, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that covers your former
Barbarous Treatment: And if they did not Pistol in cold
Blood; If they did not Ty the Women to Stakes in the Sea,
and let the Tide Flow over them; If they did not Drag you
out of your Houses, and Shoot you, without giving you Time
to Commend your Souls to GOD's Mercy; If these Things
were not done, you ought to believe, none of the Posterity
of these poor Innocents, that so Suffered, were Alive to Re∣venge
them; or that you had more Mercy from their Hands,
than you had Reason to expect.</P>
<P>These things therefore cannot be called Persecution, and
the Violences of the Rabbles of the Revolution should be
raz'd out of the Catalogue—. An <HI>English</HI> High-Church-Man
should not call it Persecution, because, at their Revolu∣tion,
it was practised by them at Home: A <HI>Scots</HI> Episcopal-Man
should not, because of the just Provocation his Party
had given the Poor People to Treat them more Violently.</P>
<P>Again, if, by nice Distinctions, they should chance to
say, they have proved this to be Persecution—. What's
this to the Church? It might be done by Presbyte∣rians
<HI>of the Church;</HI> but it can never be said, it was done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
<HI>THE PRESBYTERIANS as a Church:</HI> It was done by no Act
of the Church, no, nor of the Government; nor did either the
Church or the Government ever Approve, Justify, or Employ
any of the Persons—. 'Tis true, there was no publick
punishing the Actors; neither did the Government in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
punish, neither was it a time to punish those Excesses:
And particularly the Government in <HI>England</HI> thought fit, by
Parliament, so far to bear with them, as to stop all Process
against Trespasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is also another unhappy Circumstance, that so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f∣fectually
clears the Church of this Charge, that I cannot
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
but wonder, the Party could ever make use of it as an Ar∣gument,
or bring this Matter of Rabbling into the Charge:
And that is, That these Tumults, Plunderings, and Driving
away the Episcopal Ministers, were all done and over,
before there was any such thing as a Presbyterian Church, I
mean, establish'd, or in any Power to Act as a Judicatory,
or as a Body; So that, to charge the Church with this, is
like Indicting a Man for a Murder committed before he was
born.</P>
<P>I shall therefore take up none of my time here, to Vindi∣cate
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from any part of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harge; be∣ing
what can, with no colour of Reason, put the least Re∣flection
upon her; and if it could, can, by no means, ob∣tain
the Name of Persecution.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Deposing the Ministers</HI>—. This I think will hardly
come under the Name of Persecution, nor take up much of my
time—. What little I shall say, will be perfectly new to
what has been said before, <HI>viz.</HI> If this Debate be entered
upon, it will seem to me to depend upon the Original Con∣stitution
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Reformation,
and so it will only remain to inquire, whether Episcopacy
in <HI>Scotland</HI> was not an Usurpation, and a Persecution upon
the Rightful Establishment: And the Deposing it only a Re∣storing
the Presbyterian Church to its proper undoubted pos∣session:
And this being a <HI>Point remote to my present Debate,</HI>
I wave it here, not but that I shall readily enter upon that
Question too, as Occasion may present, or when ever those
complaining Gentlemen please to require it.</P>
<P>Besides, I think it is not so much the Deposing the Mini∣sters,
or E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecting Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is the present
Case in Debate, or which they complain of in the Word Per∣secution;
as the manner of doing it, and the Usage of the
Episcopal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy subsequent to it—. And that brings me
directly to Matter of Fact.—</P>
<P>In pursuing which, I shall not so much descend to the
particular Stories Affirmed in Print, the Falshood of most
of which are evidently detected by Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> as aforesaid:
And in speaking to which, I must be obliged to blacken a
Party of Men, whose Infirmities and ill Conduct, I do not
covet to expose to the World, unless otherwise forced to it.—</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Nor would it be to the purpose here, to trouble the Reader
with proving of <HI>Negatives,</HI> and Detecting the particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l∣sities
of the All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations, which in Print have been put upon
the World: And which will meet with their compleat An∣swer
in the Method I have now chosen, and must require
farther Documents or Vouchers to confirm them, than the
Authorities which yet have been produced.</P>
<P>My Method therefore shall be, to give an Impartial Ac∣count
of the general Proceedings of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in the Matter of Establishing the Presbyterian Discipline, and
Deposing Episcopacy, together with their Behaviour to the
Episcopal Clergy, thro' the whole Course of the present Esta∣blishment;
And tho the whole can be but an Abstract or
Abridgment, I mean as to Cases; yet I make no doubt, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fully, and to all Impartial Observers of things, intire∣ly
vindicate the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from all the Aspersions
of her Enemies; and prove, that the Circumstances consider∣ed,
her Sufferings before the Revolution, and the Behaviour
of the Episcopal Dissenters since, being put all into the Ac∣count,
the Consequence will show the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> the
most Moderate, the farthest from Persecution, and the
most Forbearing of any Establish'd church in the World.</P>
<P>It could not be expected, but that, upon the Revolution,
the Prelatic Tyranny would fall with the Regal; And,
were it worth Examining into, it would be easy to prove,
there was an Inevitable Necessity it should do so, they being
so effectually supported one by another, that they could not
but stand and fall together.</P>
<P>That the conjunct Tyranny of both Church and State had
Treated the Presbyterians with such an Impolitic Fury, as
must imply, they had not the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Apprehension of being
ever pull'd down again by them, would be very evident, if
I should enter here upon a particular of all that Treatment,
of all the Sufferings and Oppressions that People underwent;
The exact History of which, tho it be very much wanted in
the World, yet I cannot think of entring upon it here, un∣less
forced to it, in the just Defence of what is but hinted
at in these Papers.—</P>
<P>Indeed the remote <HI>Idea's</HI> I had of these things, were suf∣ficient
to have given me a Notion, that they had been h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd∣ly
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
used; but I confess my self amazed and surprized, when
at my enquiring into Particulars, I find all the Excesses of
Rapine, Violence, Blood, Cruelty, Torture and Barbarity,
that any Age can show for several hundred years past in the
World, till at last it came to down-right Massacre; and the
Souldiers had power given them, <HI>and frankly Executed it,</HI> to drag
innocent people in time of full Peace, out of their Houses,
and murder them at their discretion; terrible Instances of
which are to be given in several parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>If any man was to read the dismal Stories of that Time,
and making the Case his own, reflect upon what he should have
done in like case, when the Revolution put those very people,
into the power of such, whose Blood they had dipt their
Hands in, let him censure the enraged people if he can; <HI>in all
their Rabbles,</HI> they only drove their Curats away, and per∣haps
plundered some of them; and was it not rather to be
expected, when gotten together in a Tumultuary way, they
should have torn them to pieces, and sacrificed them <HI>lege talione,</HI>
to the Ghosts of their murdered Relations?</P>
<P>However therefore I avoid entring into the History of the
Persecutions and Butcheries, exercised by the people we are
speaking of, I cannot help saying here, that they are in their
general View, a most direct Testimony of the moderation of
the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that when Established, they
contented themselves with a bare Deposing the thing, with∣out
bringing to Justice the persons; among whom many of
the Clergy would have been found Principals, nay, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
even in some places Actors, in a most unusual and unac∣countable
manner.</P>
<P>But to come to particulars, I mean, as to Church Conduct,
let us go back to the Revolution.</P>
<P>The Bishops being Deposed, and the Presbyterian Govern∣ment
of the Church being Restored and Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
one of the first things which the Assembly did, was to con∣sider
of the planting Ministers in the Church; and in order
to this it was Debated,</P>
<P>1. Who were the people to be put out. And</P>
<P>2. Who to be put in.</P>
<P>As to the last, it is no part of the Subject here, nor at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to the purpose: But as to the first, the Ministers to be put ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were of two sorts.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
1. Scandalous, Ignorant, and Immoral persons.</P>
<P>2. Unqualified persons.</P>
<P>As to the Scandalous and Immoral, I hope no body will
call it Persecution, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought it her
Duty to have them removed; and that her Assemblies dili∣gently
applyed themselves to the Doing it; and yet even in
the doing this most necessary piece of Justice to the Church,
the Lenity, the space given for Reformation, the passing by
a great many, that in strict Justice might have been
Deposed; these are sufficient Testimonies that it was not a
Spirit of Persecution, Cruelty, or Severity, which acted the
Assemblies, or which acted the Commissioners deputed by
them, to Inspect the Churches at that time; but a necessary
Justice, a Debt due to the Churches Safety, and to the work of
Reformation, and which they could with no tollerable Rea∣son,
either in Duty or Polity, have omitted.</P>
<P>If in the Deposing of Ministers who appeared Scandalous
or Ignorant, the Party think fit to complain of Injustice and
Oppression, Partiality and Persecution; and think fit to de∣sire
me to Exhibit to the World, a List of the Names and
Circumstances of the several Ministers Deposed, and the
Charges against them; together with the Form how proved,
and how in most places confessed; I am content, and shall
on their first notice let the World see, who, and how many
Ministers have been Deposed by the Church, and for what;
&amp; the Article of Persecution, shall with all my heart turn upon
the Merits of it; but if they would take my Advice, it should
be to let this be one of the last things they do, lest it
give the World too plain a Demonstration of the absolute
Necessity the church was under to Reform the Ministry, and
tell a little too plainly, what a sort of Clergy they had to
deal with.</P>
<P>The Deposing Scandalous, Ignorant or Immoral persons,
therefore I believe will not be called Persecution.</P>
<P>The whole Question then must depend upon the second
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Deposing Ministers for not qualifying themselves
according to Law; and tho' this is a direct Act of the State,
and is the same in <HI>England,</HI> now practised by the very same
High Church-Men that make this complaint; and I could
be very merry with our High-flying Jacobit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clergy, who
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
have Qualified themselves in <HI>England,</HI> and yet retain their
Anti-Revolution-Principles—yet I wave that Advantage,
and I am content to call it, so far as the Church was the im∣mediate
Instrument, I say I am content to call it the Act
and Deed of the Church; because giving them all the Lati∣tude
in their own way of arguing, <HI>however unfair,</HI> their con∣futation
will be with the greater force, and the more Fatal to
them.</P>
<P>The Government was no sooner Establisht by the Revolu∣tion,
&amp; the Kirk Restor'd to her Judicatorial Authority, but her
several Courts, as Session, Presbytery, Synod, and Assembly
took their courses, and began to Act.</P>
<P>By the first Act of Parliament for settling these Matters, past
<HI>June</HI> 7. 1690, Intituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confession of Faith,
and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</HI> It is Ordained,
<HI>That the General Assembly the Ministers and Elders, should have
Power to try and purge out all Insufficient, Scandalous, and Errone∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Ministers, by due Course of Ecclesiastick Process and Censures;</HI>
But this Act no where Impower'd them to Censure any who
were not Insufficient, Scandalous, or Erroneous, tho they
would not take the Oaths to the Government—. So that,
by this Law, the Church could not be capable of Persecution.</P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be Episcopal, might be
adjudged Erroneous by this Judicatory, and so come under
the Church Censure, by Authority of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis Replyed—. First, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No Man was ever
since the Revolution, Deposed by the Church, meerly for be∣ing
Episcopal, nor was any Process ever commenc'd against
any Man on that Foundation.</P>
<P>And here by the way, if this be true, as I can challenge
the World to contradict it, I would humbly recommend it
to those Gentlemen, who are now in <HI>England</HI> raising Chari∣ties,
and obtaining Contributions, pretending it is for the
Relief of the poor Distressed Episcopal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
who are suffering Persecution, to tell the World, what it is
they are persecuted for.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gentlemen who bestow their Charity, would do
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> require some Documents or Certificates of them, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ the particulars; And especially one exceeding busy
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for those Charities, and who stiles himself a per∣secuted
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Episcopal Minister, whose Name may in time be
made more publick, would do well to tell them, whether
he was Deprived, which he calls Persecution, for his Con∣science,
or his Vice; for his Religion, or for his Morals; for
Episcopacy, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Relapse Fornication.</P>
<P>But, <HI>secondly,</HI> To put this out of Question, it was parti∣cularly
Declared by the First General Assembly after the Re∣volution,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the Sixth Session in the Year 1690, <HI>That
this Assembly will Depose no Incu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bents simply for their Judgment
anent the Government of the Church, nor Urge Re-ordination upon
them. Vid. Index</HI> of the Unprinted Acts of the Assembly,
<HI>Sess.</HI> 6. 1690.</P>
<P>In the same Assembly, in their Instructions given to their
Commission, which was to sit during their Recess, we have
these Words,</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiving Informations against the
late Conformists; And that they proceed in the Matter of Censure
very Deliberately, so as none may have Just Cause to Complain of
their Rigidity; And that they shall not proceed to Censure, but up∣on
Relevant Libels and Sufficient Probation, <HI>Act 15th. Sess. 26th,
Assembly 1690.</HI></P>
<P>Again, lest the Presbyteries should be Rash or Severe, the
Commission is Impowered as follows, <HI>That if they shall be in∣form'd
of any precipitant Procedure of the Presbyteries in such Pro∣cesses,
to Restrain them. Vid.</HI> the same Act as above.</P>
<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in Scandalous Things,
and Declared against proceeding in Cases meerly Episcopal,
where shall we find the Article of Persecution?</P>
<P>'Tis true, That, in the Year 1693, an Act of Parliament
was made to Deprive all such Ministers, as would not both
Swear to the Government, and Acknowledge the Church Go∣vernment
also, and the Confession of Faith—. But the
Occasion of this Act is Visible to all that know the Affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of that Time—, that it was past to satisfy the Minds
of the People, who were exceedingly Disturb'd▪ at the
Churches having been Insulted in the Assembly 1692,
by a general <HI>Formula</HI> procured by the Episcopal Clergy, toge∣ther
with their Appeal to the King on a Refusal: And the
Assembly being abruptly Dissolved, or Dismissed <HI>sine die,</HI>
which put the Nation into a very great Fermentation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Yet, upon this Act, I may challenge the Episcopal Clergy to
show me one Minister, that ever was Deposed for not acknow∣ledging
the Church, if at the same time he offered to ac∣knowledge
the Government, and take the Oaths, and they
have been often challenged on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice by a Law, that
Famous Act of Parliament was made in the Year 1695▪
wherein taking the Oaths to the Government is made the <HI>One∣ly</HI>
and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI> Qualification, and all Ministers that
would so <HI>Qualifie themselves</HI> are continued. As may be seen
at large by the Act, Intituled, <HI>Act Concerning the Church,
Anno</HI> 1695.</P>
<P>This very Act of Parliament, if I were to go no further,
effectually clears the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the charge of
Persecution; since 'tis plain there was no religious Tenet in
dispute, but a civil Question of owning or not owning the
Government.</P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken quite out of the
power of the Church, to Depose any Man meerly for being
Episcopal in principle, or for refusing to owne the Presbyte∣rian
Church; nay the Episcopal Clergy who, by virtue of this
Act, remain in their Livings, many of them to this day, re∣fuse
to acknowledge the Church, to submit to any of her
Judicatories, or to joyn, either in Discipline or Worship; and
yet in all their Affronts of the Establish'd Church, they con∣tinue
in their Paroches, preaching and using all their Forma∣lities;
however, contrary to the inclinations and desires of
the people, who in some places are fain to set up Meeting-Houses
in their Paroches, and be at the charge of Entertain∣ing
a Presbyterian Minister as a Dissenter, to preach to them,
because they cannot bear the Fopperies and Opposition of
their paroch Minister.</P>
<P>I would fain have those people that cry out of the persecu∣tion
of the Episcopal Clergy, go to some of these Paroches,
and see this uncouth Jest, where the persecuting establish'd
Church is fain to submit to a Meeting-house, and the perse∣cuted
Episcopal Clergy-man insults them from the parish-Church,
and keeps both the Pulpit and the Stipend, in spight
of them all.—Here is the establish'd Church turn'd Dis∣senter,
and the Dissenter made the Incumbent; the Persecutor
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
become the persecuted, and <HI>per contra</HI> the persecuted made
the persecutor. But of this more presently.</P>
<P>The Churches power to persecute, being thus limited by
Act of Parliament, it remains to Examine, in what manner
she has Exercised that Power she had; for in this Article must
ly the Matter of this Charge, or they must have more than a
spirit of Divination that can find it out.</P>
<P>In order to this, I must enquire what this Power they had
was, and that is a very short Question—Their Power, 'tis
plain, was only against such Ministers who were Scandalous,
&amp;c. as before, or would not take the Oaths to the Govern∣ment,
nor pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they were, or were not absolutely bound up to
Censure all such as would not thus qualifie themselves, is a
Question I shall speak to hereafter.</P>
<P>It follows to Examine how the Church has Executed this
Power; and whether Lenity or Severity has been her Temper
in the case; and to state this, as clearly as possible, I must
make the Gentlemen one fair proposal.</P>
<P>Before I entred upon this Work, I have not only searched
into all the publick Records of this Matter, which I could
have Access to, but have made as strict Enquiry, as possibly
I could, of the most Impartial and Unbyass'd Persons, for
any particular Case, wherein any Excursion might have been
beyond this Power, or wherein the Charge of Persecution
might ly—. And having done this with the utmost Im∣partiality,
and not being able to find any thing; and having
not the Honour to be Acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with any of the Deposed
Clergy, who might have furnish'd me with some of the
particulars; I cannot but earnestly intreat some of these Re∣verend
Gentlemen, who have suffered under these severe Per∣secutions,
to tell the World what they are, and wherein the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has, either exceeded her Limited Power,
or indeed fully exerted it in any Case, so, as to deserve the
black Charge of Persecution; Assuring them, that if I
could, by all my Search and Inquiry, <HI>tho now upon the Spot,</HI>
have found out but one Instance, in which the Church had
thus persecuted them, or any of them, I would never
have wrote one Line in her Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Perhaps, it may be alledged here, That Imposing Oaths up∣on
the Ministers, who, <HI>thinking themselves bound by former Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to their late King,</HI> could not in Conscience comply with
them, is Persecution; especially when it is considered, that
this Imposing the said Oaths was enforced, on pain of De∣privation;
And the Scruples of these Oaths, in many, who
could otherwise have complyed, being meerly conscientious, to
deprive them on that Account, is Persecution in the Abstract,
being Persecution purely for Conscience sake.</P>
<P>In Answering this, <HI>which is the most material thing can be said,</HI>
I must make several Remarks.</P>
<P>I. Really Gentlemen, speaking to the Complainers in
the South; those of the Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who are perse∣cuted
at all, are only persecuted on this Account: And
therein two things will follow:</P>
<P>1. That all the Dissenting Clergy in <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Ja∣cobites,</HI>
and suffer only for refusing to take the Oaths to
the Government.</P>
<P>2. That really the—<HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy in the North of
<HI>Britain,</HI> are much Honester Men than their Brethren in the
South; since those universally have suffered Deprivation
and Loss of their Livings for their Principle: But, in
the South, Hundreds retaining, <HI>in their Equivocating
Way,</HI> their Loyalty in Principle to their Abdicated King,
have Loaded themselves with Oaths, Abjurations, and
every thing the Government has thought fit to lay upon
them; And yet, on all Occasions, Act against that
very Government they Swear to—Publickly Pray
for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and now for Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>—And Privately for King <HI>James,</HI> both Father
and Son: Drink Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Health and King <HI>James</HI>
the VIIIth's Alternately, or Occasionally, as suites their
Company: These are a sort of Hypocrites equally De∣tested
by both Parties, and equally Dangerous to both.
But of this by the way.</P>
<P>II. If the putting these Gentlemen out of their Livings
be a Persecution, then the Church and Government in
<HI>England</HI> have been as guilty of Persecution, as the Church
and Government in <HI>Scotland;</HI> since all the Clergy in
one, as well as in the other, were deposed, and turned
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
out, who would not take the Oaths: And the High
Church-Men, who have joyn'd themselves to the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and consequently made themselves Parties to
that kind of Persecution, ought, by no means, to call
it so in <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless they are content to share the
Scandal.</P>
<P>III. The Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> even under all the Ad∣vantages
of Tolleration, are as much persecuted as the
Episcopal Clergy in <HI>Scotland;</HI> since not one of their Mi∣nisters
can Preach, (the <HI>Quakers</HI> excepted) without
taking the same Oaths; And not only so, but signing
the Confession of Faith of the Establish'd Church, a
few small <HI>Proviso's</HI> for their particular Principles only
excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> All this Persecution, if it can be called by
that Name, is the Act and Deed of the State; 'Tis a
Debt to the publick Peace, 'tis the necessary Consequence
of the Revolution, and of the Abolishing Episcopacy,
things wholly National, Antecedent to the Church
Settlement, and not at all the Act or Concern of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor can it be brought as part of a
Charge against them.</P>
<P>I come now to Examine, how the Church has Extended
and Exerted the real Power she has, and how far she has pro∣ceeded
in the very Execution of the Law; And if I do prove
here, That she has been so far from enforcing these Laws, or
putting forth her Power in Extremities or Severities, that she
has rather neglected her own Safety, suffered her self to be
imperfectly settled, her Power contemned, her Ministers in∣sulted,
her Acts of Assembly slighted, and her Discipline dis∣regarded▪
And this only, because she was loth to push
things to Extremities, loth to make Examples, loth to use Se∣verities,
and willing, as much as could consist with Govern∣ment
and Safety, to spare, bear with, and deal gently with
those, who, in their Power, shew'd her no Favour▪ and even,
under this Treatment, shew her no manner of Respect—, If▪
I say, I prove this, I think I shall effectually clear her of the
Slander, so industriously spread abroad, and so positively as∣serted,
of her being of persecuting Principles: And if I do
not prove this, I do nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
I confess, this will drive me to the Necessity of Exposing
some of the Names of these Gentlemen, who, by this Con∣nivance
and Lenity of the Church, peaceably enjoy, <HI>tho I
cannot say they gratefully acknowledge it,</HI> those Benefices and Liv∣ings
which they had, by their other Circumstance, Forfeited
to the Laws; But the necessary Defence of Truth obliging
me to it, those Gentlemen must blame their Friends, who
have made this unhappy Necessity, not me, who, I assure
them, have no personal Grudge either at them, or at the
Connivance granted them, and only wish they would, in a
more peaceable and respectful manner, enjoy it.</P>
<P>The List of Names contains two Ranks or sorts of People,
and either of them are Testimonies of the publick Moderati∣on,
one of the Government, and one of the Church in par∣ticular;
and both of them will serve to make the Complaint
of Persecution and Severities look very odly.</P>
<P>The Lists are twofold, and not to interrupt the Thread of
Discourse, I have plac'd one of them by way of <HI>Appendix</HI> at the
end of this Book; I have forborn abundance of Reflections, and
just Remarks on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ircumstances, and particular Conduct
of the Gentlemen named there: Not that I am ignorant of the
particulars, and shall, at any time gratify them with necessa∣ry
Comments upon them, if they desire it—, But to let
them see, that even, in this Account, I forbear to expose
them farther, than the necessary Defence of the Case before
me calls for; and I am very sorry they have done any thing
to bring this upon them.</P>
<P>By the first List which I have not printed, but in the pub∣lick
Registers any one may see it, it will appear, that there
are now Preaching, and possessing their respective Parish
Churches, above threescore Ministers, who were profestly
and openly Episcopal; but, on their submitting to, and ac∣knowledging
the Presbyterian Establishment, were received
to Ministerial Communion, and many of them are now
worthy Members of the present Church; by which one
thing will be unanswerably proved.</P>
<P><HI>viz.</HI> That not one Episcopal Minister, in the whole
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> has been Deposed for his Prin∣ciple;
That is, not for his being Episcopal, or for his
Non-conformity to the establish'd Presbyterian Church,
but meerly for <HI>Jacobitism,</HI> for his refusing to own
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
the Government, and acknowledge the Queen; since,
would he have taken the Oaths, and prayed for the
Sovereign, it was not in the Power of the General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣sembly,
which is the Representative of the Church,
to depose or persecute them at all.</P>
<P>I know this will be a surprizing thing to abundance of
Honest People in <HI>England,</HI> who hitherto have had other No∣tions;
and I cannot but desire them to consider,</P>
<P>1. How impossible it is to be true, that the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> should persecute the Episcopal Clergy for
their Non-conformity, when, by Act of Parliament, it
was not in their Power to molest or depose any Mini∣ster,
however Episcopal in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinciple or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ractice, if
he would but take the Oaths to the Government, and
pray for the King or Queen; and when it was in their
Power, they reponed all those that would come in.</P>
<P>2. This clears the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivil Government also, from be∣ing
any way cruel, severe, or persecuting to the Epis∣copal
Clergy; since all they required, was only Con∣formity
to the Civil Magistrate, and Complying with
the Laws of the Land—. And in this Case, it
would be worth notice also, how different the Terms of
this Conformity were in this Government, from the like
Terms of Conformity in the Times of Episcopal Go∣vernment
—. In this the Penalty of Refusing was
only Deprivation of their Benefices in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy, and
in the Laity nothing at all; in those Days, Banish∣ment,
Imprisonment, and Death at the Mercy of eve∣ry
Soldier, was the Lot not of the Clergy only, but of
every Person, and many have been murdered in cold
Blood, without Mercy, for refusing not only to swear
to the King, but only for refusing to say, <HI>GOD Save
the King.</HI></P>
<P>I know the poor People are branded here with Weakness
and Obstinacy—. But two things seem to be a present
Answer to that,</P>
<P>1. These were but a few, and those of the meanest
and weakest of the People.</P>
<P>2. The weaker the People, the more cruel and bar∣barous
the Severity of those times, that should put them
to Death for such Trifles, taking them by the Handle
of their mistaken Nicety.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
3. It is evident, it was only taking Advantage of
the Zeal of a People, which run beyond the Bounds of
Reason—. Since, if they had not had that Handle,
they would have sought some other: And it was plain,
that where they found the People complying with those
Demands, they 'scap'd not the better, but they always
found Pretences to murder them.</P>
<P>4. The poor People are not so much to be blam'd,
since they understood, <HI>GOD Save the King,</HI> was, to
pray GOD to prosper the King in the Persecution of
their Brethren.</P>
<P>'Tis farther confirm'd, That the Civil Government
has not persecuted, or been cruel or severe to these
Gentlemen; since not only they continued all the
Ministers, that would give but the Security of their
Oaths for their peaceable Behaviour, a thing no Govern∣ment
in the World would dispense with: <HI>But, since
that,</HI> the Treatment of those that have been Deposed has
been such, so Gentle, so Tender, and so Forbearing,
as I believe, all Circumstances considered, no Nation in
the World can parallel; Of which, and their Beha∣viour
to the Government, under that Lenity, I may
speak by it self.</P>
<P>And I cannot but recommend the Gentlemen, Who are
Complainers here, to Her Majesties Answer to the Depos∣ed
clergy, who Addressed, in the Beginning of Her Reign,
for their Liberty, <HI>viz.</HI> To behave themselves peaceably, and
subject themselves to the Government; Which, however
some of them were willing to construe as a Declaration of
Liberty, and to use it in a different way from Her Majesties
Intention, they might have found more Reason, had they
Judged Impartially, to have taken for a Reproof of their un∣peaceable
Behaviour, and ungrateful Temper to the Govern∣ment,
which had so Gently Treated them.</P>
<P>Again I observe, as this effectually clears the
Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Charge of Persecu∣tion;
So <HI>the Second List</HI> will, with much more Rea∣son,
and no doubt, to the Astonishment of a great part of
the <HI>English</HI> Nation, who shall read it, abundantly clear up
the Reputation of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Horrid
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Slander of Persecution▪ being an Account of 165 Episcopal
Ministers, must of whom have neither complyed with the
Church nor with the Government; have neither submitted to
the Presbyterian Establishment in Discipline or Church Go∣vernment,
nor qualified themselves as by Act of Parliament
is required, that owne neither Civil Government nor Eccle∣siastick;
that neither pray for the Queen, nor Swear to the
Queen, nor acknowledge either Queen or Church; and yet
by the meer forbearance of the Church, are now peaceably
enjoying their Benefices, Stipends, and Appurtenances,
preach publickly to the people, and live in the open profession
of the most opposite Principles to the Establishment.</P>
<P>Would any Man that knew all this, have the face to say,
this is a Persecuting Church? would any Church in the World
that had a legal and National Establishment, suffer, in de∣fyance
of her Authority, and in contempt of her Establish∣ment,
what this Church suffers, and what in meer back∣wardne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
to persecution she bears with?</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be ask'd here, What is it she bears
with? and I know great Noise is made, that the Episcopal
people here are not so different as in <HI>England</HI> from the Pres∣byterians,
having no Service-Book, Habits, or Ceremonies;
and therefore the things they bear with are but Trifles, and
the Moderation the less to be insisted on.</P>
<P>But this is not so easie to make good as to say, for 'tis not
the meer Articles of Ceremony &amp; Habits that make the wei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht
of the Difference in <HI>England,</HI> any more than here; and if the
Difference is but a Trifle, the Argument is stronger against
those who for Trifles divide from the establish'd Church,
than against the establish'd Church who expect their Confor∣mity.</P>
<P>But 'tis evident, let the differences in Religion be what
they will, the difference here lyes chiefly in Civil Matters▪ all
their Qualifications depending upon Swearing to the Go∣vernment;
so that it is not so much Presbytery and Episco∣pacy
which is the Dispute, as it is Liberty and Tyrrany.
King <HI>William</HI> and the Revolution, or King <HI>James</HI> and Ar∣bitrary
power, Queen <HI>Anne</HI> and the Protestant Succession,
or an abdicated Race, and <HI>French</HI> Tyranny.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>be sides this,</HI> these unqualified Ministers with whom
the Church thus behaves, and with whose Insolency she
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
bears in so many Articles—Differ in many Things, which
no established Church in the World that I have ever read
of, would allow or connive at.</P>
<P>And to descend a little to particulars, it may be observed,
that they, <HI>I mean generally speaking,</HI> in all, or most part of the
following particulars are constantly omitting.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They pray not for the Queen, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They refuse to sign the Confession of Faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They submit not to Church Censures, or acknow∣ledge
Church Judicatories.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They refuse to Lecture or Expound before Sermon,
which all other Ministers are obliged to, <HI>by an Act of As∣sembly,</HI>
every Morning.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They keep no Session, but the Presbytery are obliged
to appoint others to do it, to preserve Justice and Order in
the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. They Ordain no Elders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. They Examine not their Communicants before the Sa∣crament,
as all other Ministers do, and are obliged to do.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I do not say every one of them are guilty of all these Omis∣sions—.
But all are guilty of some of them; some of all of
them; and others of more than these—. And to this may
be added, that they are universally declar'd Jacobites, and
professed Enemies to the Protestant Succession.</P>
<P>Would any Man now imagine, that this hot, furious, per∣secuting
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> under whom such cruel Suffer∣ings
and barbarous things are complain'd of, should bear
with Ministers, and continue them in their Liv∣ings,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay and some of them very good Livings too, meerly
in Tenderness, and Backwardness to the thing called Severi∣ty?
Is this Persecution! Blush, Gentlemen of the Episcopal
Clergy, for these People, who have thus officiously exposed
you; and if you have any Honesty, and Gratitude, any
Sense of Kindness upon you, do Justice to those, who, in
spight of all your publick owning your own Principles, and
disowning theirs, forborn to obey even their known Constitu∣tion,
and have declined pushing things to Extremity upon
you, in hopes your Discretion would, one time or other,
bring you to owne their Government, or at least acknow∣ledge
their Civility, Charity and Compassion to you.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
I might here give a List of Ministers, who having been De∣posed
or suspended by respective Presbyteries, or by Com∣missioners
appointed to Inspect, have yet, by the Tender∣ness
of the Church in the Commission of the Assem∣bly,
been reponed, and placed in their Livings again, only
upon feigned Submissions, Promises of Conformity to Dis∣cipline,
Lecturing before Sermon, and the like; and yet, as
soon as re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plac'd, have renounced those Submissions in Prac∣tice,
return'd to their former Omissions, left off Lecturing,
re-assumed their little Formalities, and profess'd themselves
openly Episcopal, and yet the Church has taken no Advan∣tage
against them.</P>
<P>I might, as I hinted before, give a List of Ministers, whose
open Omission of Discipline, Lecturing, and all manner of
Church Order, together with their Slackness, Meanness, and
Formalities in their Performances, are so perfectly disagree∣able
to their People, that they are obliged to get Presbyte∣rian
Ministers to preach in Meeting-Houses like Dissenters
among them, and yet the Church bears with all this, rather
than persecute them—. But I omit these things, till I am
farther necessitated to expose them; but they that question
the Fact may inquire about Mr. <HI>Patrick Lyon</HI> at <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>John Anderson</HI> late at <HI>Dysert▪ &amp;c.</HI> and at several other
places, where they may be fully satisfyed of most of the
particulars.</P>
<P>I come now to the Treatment those really called Dissenters,
those who are actually Deposed meet with from the Church,
and this will almost force me to enter a little into a long and
black Account of the Treatment the Church meets with from
them, in which I shall however be very tender, being unwil∣ling
to expose any Bodies Frailties more than meer necessity
forces me to.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but if I should say, that these Dissenting,
Episcopal Ministers, who are thus Deposed, do, now and
then, take the Liberty very privately to preach, it would,
with some Wonder, and more Difficulty, be believed in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
where the general Opinion is, <HI>so strangely have People
been Imposed upon,</HI> that they are intirely supprest, that they
dare not meet or exercise any Religious Worship; that they
are dayly insulted by Mobs, and pursu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Session
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
and Presbyteries, meerly for serving GOD according to their
Consciences.</P>
<P>But how will these People behave themselves? How will
ye be amaz'd to think in what manner you have been im∣posed
upon? And how easily you have suffered your
selves to be abused? When I shall assure you, that not
one Word of all this is true; When I shall tell you, that
the Episcopal Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> enjoy at this time, and have
done for several Years, all the Liberty which the Dissenters
in <HI>England</HI> do now enjoy, and that with Conditions vastly
differing.</P>
<P>I<HI>st,</HI> They have their full Liberty by the meer Leni∣ty
and Forbearance of the Government, which in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
could never be obtained but in little Intervals, but
by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>2. They have the same Liberty, tho they not only re∣fuse
to take the Oaths, but refuse to sign the Doctrinal
Articles of the Confession of Faith, tho even the Church
of <HI>England</HI> owns them to be all Orthodox, a thing the
Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> are not permitted in, no not by
the Act of Tolleration.</P>
<P>3. They enjoy this Liberty, notwithstanding they
openly, and in their publick Assemblies, not only o∣mit
praying for the Queen, but some of them actually
and distinctly pray for their <HI>James</HI> the VIII, and for his
Restoration, which is not only praying for a Popish
Prince, but praying GOD to depose or cut off Her pre∣sent
Majesty, and Affront so horridly Impious, and so
Offensive to all Her Majesties Subjects, that one
would wonder the most Moderate Principle in the
World could bear with it.</P>
<P>And what will you say now Gentlemen of the High Church
in <HI>England?</HI> When I shall tell you, there are now fourteen or
sixteen of these Meeting-Houses in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> just
in the Face of the General Assembly of the Church, and in the
Eyes of the Government, and that in any Town or place in the
Kingdom, where they have Hearers, they have the same—.
That in some of these, they have newly set up the Com∣mon
Prayer Book, a thing in the Heighth of Episcopacy they
never attempted, and which even the Episcopal Party in ge∣neral
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
were never reconciled to—. And that, in not one
of these Meetings, that ever I heard of, the Queen is pray'd
for by Name, but in some directly they pray for the King,
which must mean their <HI>James</HI> the VIII, or worse, and in
others they pray in ambiguous Words, such as <HI>THE QUEEN,</HI>
or the <HI>ROYAL FAMILY,</HI> and if I am not misinformed, in
some for King <HI>James</HI> the eighth in so many Words.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in these open Insults both of Government
and Church, they have in their Turn, met with some few
Oppositions from the people who have been provoked at
such Indignities done to their Sovereign, and to the Go∣vernment
in the face of the Sun; and these little Rabbles
they would call Persecution—and yet even in these cases
the Government has carefully supprest the Tumult, and
voluntarly made Reparation to private Families, for the
Damnages they have pretended to have sustained, and that
often beyond the real Spoil, tho' at the same time their own
Imprudent and provoking Carriage has been the principal
Occasion of these Damnages; and this is evident in the City
of <HI>Glasgow</HI> in particular, the only time they can talk of, where
the Rabble assaulting a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conventicle, or Episcopal Meet∣ing,
<HI>For there is very little difference between them at any time,
and less there, than on most Occasions,</HI> the City payed the Ow∣ner
of the House several hundred pounds <HI>sterling,</HI> for the sup∣posed
Damnage he received; <HI>Which in all appearance so far
exceeded his Loss,</HI> that 'tis no breach of Charity to believe, he
would be pleased to have his House Rabbled once a Week at
the same price.</P>
<P>Nor would I have any High-flying Church of <HI>England</HI>
Man insist upon this sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersecution, I mean the com∣mon
people Rabbling the Meetings of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Dissenters,
since even in this kind also the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have
suffered Persecution from them, and lest I should send them
for the particulars to <HI>Ludlow</HI> in <HI>Wales, Pensans</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI>
and several other places, where the Meeting-Houses ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
been either pulled down when built, or the persons obliged
to convert the Building and the Ground to other uses.</P>
<P>Behold now, Gentlemen, in the South, the Cruelties and
Severities, the Persecutions, and furious Deasings of the
Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where is the Sufferings
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
of the Episcopal Clergy now? where are the Martyrs of that
number? what are the sufferings, of which one of our Pamphle∣teers
says, They exceed the Dragoonings in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But I am told, there is a remaining Objection yet behind,
<HI>viz.</HI> That even these Dissenting Ministers that have been
put out for not taking the Oaths, are persecuted, and pro∣secuted
for the private Exercise of their Function as Mini∣sters,
and for that, have been severely treated.</P>
<P>I am sorry to be driven to the Necessity of telling such un∣happy
Truths, which I wish were concealed; I mean of
such practices as will not reflect upon the Parties we speak of
only, but upon the whole Protestant Body of Christians in
the World; And therefore I entreat the Gentlemen not to
oblige me to publish the particulars in Vindication of the
Church, who would be unaccountably negligent, and even
their Enemies themselves would Reproach them with it. If
such things as are not fit to be Nam'd among Christians,
should have been suffered to be practised by Ministers of the
Gospel, and they that had a Power and Right of Judicatory,
should have been silent in it, for fear of the scandal of Per∣secution.</P>
<P>And should I here enter only into an Enquiry about the
Incestuous Marriages, the frequent marrying Men to other
Mens Wives, and Women to other Womens Husbands; or
in short, a general Joyning together persons as Man and
Wife, without either Publication in the Church, which is
the general Law of the Nation, or sufficient Information of
Circumstances, which in common prudence and Defence of
their own Reputation, they might be supposed to do—. If
these things I say, and the Mischiefs that have followed,
should be brought on the Stage, to justifie the legal Prosecu∣tions
the Church has made on that account, it would make
sad work in the Characters of the persons. The Gentlemen
therefore must not pretend to call it Persecution; the omission
of which would have been an In-let to all manner of Adul∣teries,
a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enc to the most scandalous Vices, and a general
Gate of Destruction to Families.</P>
<P>Excepting therefore such scandalous Practices, which the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means avoid pursuing, and
detecting; How often have these Gentlemen been challeng'd
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
to produce one Instance of any Minister, who has been per∣secuted
or prosecuted meerly for preaching in a Meeting, or
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r any part of his Ministerial Office, which he has Executed,
however contrary to Law, if not circumstanced also with
somethi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g scandalous and intollerable.</P>
<P>Their lawful Marriages are not at all controverted; and if
due Publication be made according to Law, that Incests and
Adulteries may be prevented, they have not been prohibited
to Marry; They Baptize, and that without the Parent subjecting
himself to necessary Examination, &amp; yet the Church bears with
it, and scruples none of their Baptisms, nor Re-baptizes any.</P>
<P>They Marry contrary both to the Civil and Ecclesiastick
Constitution, without publication of Bannes, Protestants to
Papists, and Papists to Protestants in the most Clandestine
manner, and some have been detected of those Practices, and
perhaps may call it Persecution; but I suppose they would be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath to have their Cases brought upon the Stage, to enquire
into the Circumstances, in order to the Churches Vindicati∣on;
Antidating Testimonials given to persons they have Mar∣ried,
to cover Adulteries and Fornications of the persous
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilty, thereby intending to keep them from Church cen∣sures,
as by Testifications acknowledged by themselves,
when called before the several Presbyteries, which Testimo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ials
I have ready to produce at their Service.</P>
<P>Also declaring in their Testimonials given to Persons mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
by them, they were free from Scandal, whilest mean
time they were under Censure for Trelapse Fornication,
and that in the Metropolitan City of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>By these things they have robbed some of the Noblest of the
Nation of their Daughters, and made strange Confusions in
families, innumerable Instances of which are ready to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roduced at their Demand.</P>
<P>Shall we next enquire into Matters of Discipline, and
what sad Truths might we tell here?</P>
<P>How, when Persons of Scandalous Lives, Fornicators,
who refuse to submit to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensures of the Law, or other
Persons, who for open Vices are refused Admittance to the Sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raments,
come to them, they receive them, and too frequently,
without Scruples or Examinations; Thus they dayly break all
manner of Order and Discipline in the Church, invade the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udicial Authority of the Session, weaken the Hands of Dis∣cipline
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
in the checking and reproving Immoralities, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stand
in the way of the general Reformation; and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
none of these things are they persecuted or molested—
Where then is the Persecution they talk of?</P>
<P>Now they are attempting a new Project, <HI>viz.</HI> To ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
themselves Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fecting this, they are setting up the Book of Common Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r
in their Meetings, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
oblig'd to own them, and concern themselves to obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
them a Tolleration; And since this brings me necessar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to speak of Tolleration particularly, as it respects <HI>Scotland,</HI>
shall give my Opinion freely, by way of Recommendation
to both Kirk and Dissenters.</P>
<P>I. To the Episcopal Dissenters, I would sincere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
advise them never to ask a Tolleration; For, if ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
it should be granted them, two things would happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
which would be their inevitable Destruction.</P>
<P>1. It is certain, this Tolleration would be clog
with the same Obligation to Law, and Establishmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as Tolleration of Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> now is; It c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦not be imagin'd any Government would Tollerate the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who would not own that Government, &amp; oblige the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣selves
to submit to it: I cannot suppose your Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
have the Face to ask for it on any other Terms, the To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>leration
in <HI>England</HI> had never been obtain'd with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
it. The Church of <HI>England,</HI> whose Principle is Loya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty,
and Subjection to Authority, cannot ask it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
upon any other Conditions, 'tis impossible they can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
it, they would fly in the Face of their own Practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and be obliged to restore all the Non-jurant Clergy▪
their Church, whom they have deposed on the ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
same Account.</P>
<P>If then the Church of <HI>England</HI> should interceed so far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
your behalf, or by their Interest in the Parliament of <HI>Brita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
obtain a Bill to be brought in for Tollerating all the Disse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters
in the North call'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and but this one Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
should be added, <HI>Provided they submit to take the Oaths to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Government,</HI> what will you do Gentlemen?</P>
<P>1. <HI>If you refuse,</HI> you are quite undone, all the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<HI>Church of</HI> England, <HI>and every Body,</HI> will be against y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you should desire Tolleration from a Government
you will not submit to, and all your Cries of Persecu∣tion
will be laught at; since 'twill be plain, 'tis not
Religion but Revolution you contend about, so you
will no more be called Dissenters, but <HI>Non-jurors,</HI> and
be universally sorted with your Brethren the <HI>Jacolites,</HI>
who are spued out by the Government, and cast out by
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as neither sit to be concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
with the one, or receiv'd into the other.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Well,</HI> but what if you comply? <HI>Why then you are
undone too;</HI> For first you will break and divide among
your selves, some will go one way, and some another,
and as you are weak enough already, you will then
lose all the Figure you make in the World, and no Bo∣dy
will trouble themselves about you, for all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nest
<HI>Jacobites</HI> will desert you.</P>
<P>Besides, in this you will act the unaccountablest part
that ever any People did, and will be <HI>fitter to go to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hospital</HI> than a Meeting-House; For why should you
take the Oaths to <HI>Preach in a Meeting-House,</HI> since had
you taken the Oaths, you had never been put out of the
Churches? and for <HI>the same Complyance</HI> may be supposed
to get in again; this would be doing and undoing,
and make you absolutely ridiculous.</P>
<P>If I may therefore offer my Opinion Gentlemen, my
humble Advice is, That <HI>if you will be Dissenters,</HI> stand just
where you are and be satisfied, for a Legal Tolleration will
be your Ruine—. I would offer one thing more, if you
can accept of Advice, <HI>and that is,</HI> that you would regulate
your Conduct so as Dissenters, and act so like Christians
and Ministers, that your Friends in the Church of <HI>England</HI>
may not be asham'd of you, or asham'd to interceed for
you—. That you would no more be the Refuge of the
Vitious, the Skreen of the Adulterer, the Protectors of Im∣moral
and Prophane Persons; If you would be thought Re∣ligious
Dissenters, let us see something of Religion among
you, something of Discipline and Order, that the Sacred Or∣dinances
of the Christian Church may not be abused and ex∣posed
by you—. And that the establish'd Church may
be encouraged to be easy with you, and may not be oblig'd,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
in her own Defence, and for the Support of common Con∣versation,
to prosecute you for unsufferable Irregularities, and
you be dayly complaining of those Proceedings under the
sham Name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersecution.</P>
<P>I know not whether you will please to accept of this Ad∣vice
or no; perhaps, be it never so good, you will reject it
for the sake of its disagreeable Author, <HI>but be that as you
please,</HI> I am sure the Caution is for your Advantage, use it
as you think fit.</P>
<P>If I was to turn the Discourse to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it
should be—Have no more Concern about this Matter
Gentlemen, be not afraid of the Mischiefs of Tolleration; if
the Episcopal Clergy, or any Body for them, complain, if
they desire a Tolleration, tell them, <HI>with all your Hearts,</HI> on
the same Terms the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have it, they shall
have it when they please: And since the Tolleration of Dis∣senters
in <HI>England</HI> is made the great Argument for Tollerati∣on
here, they cannot have the Face to desire better Conditi∣ons,
than those Dissenters are contented with—. And
fear not the Consequences, either they will accept it <HI>thus,</HI> or
they will not.</P>
<P><HI>If they will accept it,</HI> from that Moment you may Date the
Destruction of their Party, and the Abolishing the very
Name of Dissenting in <HI>Scotland, as before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If they will not accept it,</HI> you are for ever clear, either of the
Reproach of having denyed it to them, or of the Slander so
much Noise has been made of, I mean <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>But I cannot omit one <HI>Note</HI> here, and that turns the Ar∣gument
to a Third Party, <HI>viz.</HI> The Civil Magistrate, and
here I shall leave it only by way of Interrogation, and let
who will Answer the Question, I shall wait to see it Debat∣ed,
and may perhaps then say more to it.</P>
<P><HI>Are you sure the Tolleration desir'd is consistent with the Treaty
of Union?—That it does not Interfere with the</HI> Postulata <HI>of
the Union, and the Conjunction of both Kingdoms.</HI> And particu∣larly,
are you sure, <HI>That it makes no Invasion upon the</HI> Act of
Security, <HI>upon which the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> Scotland <HI>is now establish'd,
and which Act is made an Essential Indissolvible Branch of the
Treaty</HI>—? And as this merits very well to be enquir'd in∣to
on both sides, so give me leave to say, <HI>if it does,</HI> no Power
now constituted in <HI>Britain</HI> can grant it.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
The Words of the Act for S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curing the Presbyt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian Church
Government, and which are particularly Applicatory to
this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afe, are as follows; and I wish they were thorowly
considered.</P>
<P>—<HI>Therefore Her Majesty, with Advice and Consent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the said Estates of Parliament, Doth hereby Establish and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
the said True Protestant Religion, and the Worship, Discipline,
and Government of this Church, to Conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue without any Alterati∣on
to the People of this Land, in all Succeeding Generations.</HI></P>
<P>If this be an Inviolable, Unalterable Law, and that, <HI>as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
most certain,</HI> even the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> cannot Invade it,
we have nothing to do here, but to desire these Gentlemen
to instruct us, how to Answer this Question.</P>
<P>Whether if, either by Act of Parliament, Royal Preroga∣tive,
or any other way, <HI>except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Grant and Gift of the
Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>her self,</HI> the Episcopal Party should obtain
a Tolleration of Worship, <HI>The Government of the Church of</HI>
Scotland <HI>continues without any Alteration.</HI></P>
<P>I do not make an Exception for the Gift and Consent of
the Church here, as if that could Qualify such a Law—For
even the Grant and Consent of the Church could not now
make it Lawful; the Church cannot now give away her own
Rights, they are a Debt to Posterity, and she is bound equal∣ly
with the Government, <HI>in all Succeeding Generations,</HI> by the
Obligations of the Union.</P>
<P>But I grant the Church may, by their Moderation, Cha∣rity
and Tenderness, suffer and permit the Episcopal Dissen∣ters
to Exercise their separate way of Worship, without Exert∣ing
their Power of Government to their Disturbance, and
this I hope they will continue to do: And this leads me
naturally to two things, by way of Caution, to the Gentle∣men
on the other side.</P>
<P>1. This Lenity and Moderation is already practised
to you, and the Church does bear with you, even to
Excess, <HI>if that Word</HI> be suitable to Moderation, and it
cannot be grateful in you, to push your Complaints
to such Extremities, and to force the Friends of the
Church to defend themselves and her, by stating the
Case fairly in the Sight of the World; Since, in those
Defences, some things must necessarily appear to your
Disadvantage.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
2. It cannot but move you to behave so, as to me∣rit
the Continuance of that Moderation; For if it be
only in the Power of the Church, to make you easy,
as I believe will appear at last, you may despise it as
much as you please, but your only prudent way is to
deserve it, by a Modest, Peaceable, and Christian Be∣haviour;
and when you have tryed all other ways,
perhaps you may be the better convinc'd of the Seaso∣nableness
of such Advice, and this I leave to time to
open your Eyes in.</P>

</LIST>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
This is the List mentioned in <HI>Page 23d.</HI> of this Tract, many
of whom, to this day, behave themselves to the Establish'd
Church, much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e than the profest <HI>Jacobites</HI> and Non-ju∣rant
Dissenters, insulting the Church Judicatories, and bid∣ding
Defiance to their Authority—. Behaving them∣selves
with all manner of Rudeness and Indecency.</P>
<P>Intruding into Churches without the Call of the People,
or any Legal Proceeding, and keeping Possession against the
direct Authority of the Church, in Defiance of the respective
Presbyteries, and contrary to the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>These indeed are things which deserve a farther Discovery
to the World, and may in time have it done to their Satis∣faction;
But, mean time, the Matter of Fact is sufficient
to the present Case, and the Inquiry into particulars may
remain to another Occasion.—</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot conclude this Affair, without nothing something
to the several Parties.</P>
<P>1. To the Episcopal Dissenters, I do not say nor suggest,
that there are none of them, who are Religious, Conscienti∣ous
Dissenters, and Dissent meerly on Account of Consci∣ence;
tho I believe such are very few—. But to such, I say,
the Church is, <HI>and I would be sorry they were not,</HI> as Tender as
possible; They do not exclude them from even Ministerial
Communion, if they please to accept it; Nor do they ex∣clude
the Lay Dissenters from any Church Privileges, or
impose any Terms of Communion upon them.</P>
<P>2. To the Deposed Clergy, I would put them in Mind
to examine, whether the Clergy of the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch have
not behaved to them, with Humanity and Charity in their
private Capacities, as well as in their publick; Whether
they have not raised large Contributions among them, of
meer Tenderness to their Circumstances, and given them
considerable Sums for their Relief; Whether they have not
endeavoured to recover the Funds formerly raised, called the
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
<HI>Centesima,</HI> being a Provision for the Widows and Orphans
of the Clergy, and ordered it to be set apart for the Widows
and Orphans of the Episcopal Clergy only; And whether
they do not continue dayly to relieve the Dissenting Epis∣copal
Clergy by Collections, and giving themselves largely
to their Supply.</P>
<P>3. To those who may be forward to object, that I seem
to Invade the Churches Intrinsic Power, in saying, she had
her Power to Act in an Establish'd Method from an Act of
Parliament, <HI>P.</HI> To these I say, if they please to
compare it with other places of this Book, they will find no
Room for that Thought; Nor am I concerned to enter here
into that Debate, I take the Act in the Sense the Church ac∣cepted
it, <HI>viz,</HI> A Civil Sanction to their Power, which, if
it did not add to their Real Power, might however add
to the Publick Regard pay'd to that Power.</P>
<P>4. To these who object, that I here acknowlege the
Church has not done her Duty, and that if she had not per∣secuted,
she ought to have done it, I leave them to consi∣der
again a Declaration of the Church of <HI>England</HI> lately
made at the Head of the Occasional Bill, <HI>viz.</HI> That Perse∣cution
for Conscience is inconsistent with, and contrary to
the Principles of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> As to the List above-mentioned, I do not posi∣tively
say, none of the Persons there named, have never
taken the Oaths, tho I am told they have not, no not one▪
But that they are all openly and declaredly Episcopal, I be∣lieve
no Man will Debate with me.</P>
<P>I however make these Cautionary Hints, because I know
I am to expect all the Cavil Angry Men can raise at this
Book, which nevertheless I hope, tho in my absence it may
have no Defender, will stand upon its own Foundation
of Truth in Fact, and I am sure has been wrote with al
possible Caution as to personal Wrong.—</P>
