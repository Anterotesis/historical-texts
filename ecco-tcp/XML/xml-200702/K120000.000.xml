<HEAD>THE OLD WHIG. <HI>With</HI> REMARKS <HI>upon the</HI> PLEBEIAN, N<SUP>o</SUP> II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> to shew himself a per∣fect Master <HI>in the Vocation of Pamphlet Writing,</HI> begins like a Son of <HI>Grubstreet,</HI> with declaring the great Esteem he has for himself, and the Contempt he entertains for the Scribblers of the Age. One wou'd think, by his way of representing it, that the unexpected Appear∣ance of his Pamphlet was as great a Surprize upon the World as that of the late Meteor, or indeed something more terrible, if you will believe the Author's magnificent Description of his own Performance. <HI>The</HI> Plebeian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> says he, <HI>starting forth unexpectedly, they were forced like Peo∣ple in a Surprize, or on an Invasion, to March immediate∣ly any Troops they had.</HI> If Cardinal <HI>Alberoni</HI>'s Attempt, which furnishes the Allusion, succeeds no better than that of his Friend the Pamphleteer, he won't have much to boast of.</P>
<P>Our Author, in his triumphant Progress, first animad∣verts on a Writer, whom he says he never read, which being my own Case, I shall leave that Writer to defend himself. The second he mentions, considering the Strength of his Arguments, and the Closeness of his Reasoning, de∣served a little more regard from the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> who, it seems, <HI>with much ado went thro' the Performance.</HI> This
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
wou'd certainly have been true, had he gone through it with a design to Answer it.</P>
<P><HI>Having routed</HI> Baronius, <HI>and confounded</HI> Bellarmine, <HI>pass we on to the next,</HI> said the Country Curate to his admiring Audience. Our Author pursues his Conquests with the same Satisfaction and Intrepidity. In the first place he is angry with a Writer for assuming the Name of the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> who may more justly recriminate upon this Author for taking that of the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> a Title which he is by no means fond of retaining, if we may give Credit to many shrewd Guessers. But he tells the Old Whig, that he <HI>ex∣pected</HI> from that Title <HI>no less than the utmost Wrath and In∣dignation against the House of Lords.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>6</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> How does this agree with the Censure he passes upon him afterwards, for <HI>treat∣ing that Species in such a manner as he dares not venture to repeat!</HI> I must however remind this Author of the <HI>Milk</HI> with which he <HI>nurses our Nobles,</HI> not to omit his <HI>stagnated Pool</HI>; Passages of such a Nature, that in Imitation of the Author, I shall dispatch them with an <HI>Horresco refe∣rens!</HI></P>
<P>The Author, in the next Paragraph, gives us a Definition of the Point in Debate, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>it is a Jumble and a Hodge-Podge.</HI> A most clear, comprehensive, and elegant Account of the Matter!</P>
<P>The Author then continues his Animosities against the Ephori of <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>; but this Passage I shall wave for two Reasons, First, Because it is nothing to the Purpose. Secondly, Because I am informed there are two or three keen Disputants, who will return a proper Answer to it, when they have discover'd the Author.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> proceeds to detect an imaginary Mistake in the Old Whig, for having asserted that <HI>there has been as great an Alteration in one Branch of the Legislature, as is
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
now proposed to be made in another.</HI> A Fact immediately puts an end to a Dispute, and, in the Case before us, stands thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. added to the House of Commons</LABEL> 38 Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.</LABEL> 44</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>Queen <HI>Mary</HI></LABEL> 25</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI></LABEL> 62</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>James</HI> I.</LABEL> 27</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Question now is, whether the Restraining the Num∣ber of the House of Commons to what it is at present, was not as great an Alteration in that Branch of the Legislature, as the Restriction now proposed wou'd be to the other Branch of the Legislature, shou'd it take place in it. To which I shall add the following Question, Whether the In∣conveniencies arising from that continual Increase in the House of Commons, did not make the Restraint upon it prudent and necessary; and Whether if the like Inconve∣niencies arise from this perpetually increasing House of Lords, it is not as necessary and as prudent to put a stop to it? As for the little Towns of <HI>Watchet</HI> and <HI>Dunster,</HI> our Au∣thor can draw nothing from them to the Advantage of his Cause, if he can bestow Labour and Time enough, of which he finds it necessary to be very sparing in this Argument, to peruse the printed List of Counties and Boroughs, to whom the Privilege of sending Representatives to Parliament was granted or restored by the several Princes above-mention∣ed; and to Answer the short Query proposed to him at the end of it, with relation to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>After having proposed these Questions in plain Terms, I come in the next Place to one of the Plebeian's, which is carried on in Metaphor, till it ends in some∣thing that is past my Understanding. <HI>But these Retrench∣ments being now made. The Question,</HI> says he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>at present is, whether the Commons ought to go on stripping the Crown
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of every Jewel till it becomes less resplendent than the Doge of</HI> Venice<HI>'s Coronet, or less comfortable than the Sword-bearer's Cap of Maintenance?</HI> I shall only confront this metaphorical Query with one that is adapted to Men of or∣dinary Capacities. <Q>These Retrenchments being made, whether the Commons ought to accept the Offer of the Crown, to part with a Prerogative that is still exorbitant and dangerous to the Community?</Q></P>
<P>But our Author's chief Concern is for the poor House of Commons, whom he represents as naked and defence∣less,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> when the Crown, by losing this Prerogative, wou'd be <HI>less able to protect them against the Power of a House of Lords.</HI> Who forbears laughing, when the <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar represents little <HI>Dickey,</HI> under the Person of <HI>Gomez,</HI> in∣sulting the Colonel that was able to fright him out of his Wits with a single Frown? <HI>This Gomez,</HI> says he, <HI>flew up∣on him like a Dragon, got him down, the Devil being strong in him, and gave him Bastinado on Bastinado, and Buffet upon Buffet, which the poor meek Colonel being prostrate, suffer'd with a most Christian Patience.</HI> The Improbability of the Fact never fails to raise Mirth in the Audience; and one may venture to answer for a <HI>British</HI> House of Com∣mons, if we may guess from it's Conduct hitherto, that it will scarce be either so tame or so weak, as our Author supposes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian,</HI> to turn off the Force of the Remark upon a∣nother Paragraph, has Recourse to a Shift that is of great Use to controversial Writers, by affirming that his Antagonist mistakes his Meaning. Let the impartial Reader judge whether an Answer that proves this Alteration <HI>wou'd not be detrimental to the House of Peers,</HI> is not suited to an Objection which says in so many Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7.</NOTE> that <HI>it wou'd be detrimental to the House of Peers it self.</HI> But says the <HI>Plebeian</HI> in this his Reply to the <HI>Old Whig, It will not be detrimental to them in point of Power, but it will be
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
detrimental on Account of those Talents which ought to ac∣company Power, the Want of which the Commons will feel in their Judicature.</HI> Which is, in other Words, <Q>I do not mean when I say that it <HI>will be detrimental to the House of Peers it self,</HI> that it will be detrimental to the Peers, but that it will be detrimental to the Commons.</Q> I appeal to any Man, whether the <HI>Old Whig ignorantly mistook</HI> the natural Sense of those Words; or whether the <HI>Plebeian</HI> ignorantly exprest, that which he now says was his Meaning in those Words. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> having in his former Paper represented, that this old standing Body of Peers without receiving numerous Additions from Time to Time, wou'd <HI>become corrupt and offensive like a stagna∣ted Pool,</HI> tells us here in excuse for 'em,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7</NOTE> that <HI>they will be offensive to others but not perceive it themselves</HI>▪ If I cou'd suppose, with the Author, that they wou'd ever be in this Lamentable Pickle, I shou'd be of his Opinion that they ought to be <HI>sweetned by such wholsome, pure and fresh Streams as are continually passing into them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> next Objects to the <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Calcula∣tion of the probable Extinction of two Titles, taking one Year with another. <HI>By the Calculation generally received,</HI> says this Author, <HI>I suppose he means the List published by way of Prelude to this Project.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Old Whig</HI> cou'd not take that List for his Calculation, but formed his Cal∣culation from that List, and from the Nature of the Al∣teration which is proposed. This Objection will imme∣diately vanish upon discovering the Fallacy of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Argument. He supposes no greater Number of Extinctions wou'd happen among the <HI>English</HI> Lords, were their Num∣bers settled at 184, than happen'd in that Body when they were only 59.104.142.153, 162. or 168. At this rate of calculating, the <HI>Plebeian</HI> will be sure of gaining his Point, and affirms very truly that the Extinctions by a just Medi∣um amount to no more than a Peer and a half for every
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Year. But I appeal to honest Mr. <HI>Wingate,</HI> who was ne∣ver looked upon as a Party-Writer, whether my Calcula∣tion will not appear very just, if examined by his Golden Rule, and other curious Operations of Arithmetick, which are to be met with in his Works. Especially when the Bill, as it evidently tends to multiply Extinctions, by preventing the Peerage from running into Collateral Lines, or descending to Females, will more than answer my Com∣putation, if I should have the Misfortune to disagree with the <HI>Plebeian</HI> about some very minute Fraction of a Lord, that might happen in the Space of 116 Years. As for those contingent Vacancies which may be made by the Edge of the Law, our Author regards the Uncertainty of them as a very uncomfortable Prospect to the Candidates for Pa∣trician Honours, since they may have <HI>time enough to try all their Patience,</HI> if they live in Hopes of such a Expe∣dient for their Promotion. The ascertaining of this Point is indeed what I am not equal to, and must therefore leave it to the Masters of Political Calculation. But our Author is afraid, that if such lucky Opportunities of Extin∣ction shou'd happen, Lords may still sit with their Heads on, unless a seasonable Increase may be made to 'em in such critical Junctures. This, I must confess, is to me one very great Reason for the Alteration proposed; being fully of Opinion with the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> as exprest in the following Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whig. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Is this Inconvenience better pre∣vented in a House of Peers on the Bottom it now stands? Can any who has been a good Minister be se∣cure, if the Crown shou'd add a sufficient Number of his Enemies to those who sit in Judgment upon him? Or is a bad Minister in any Danger, when he may be shelter'd by the Addition of a sufficient Number of his Friends?</Q> The <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Answer to this Passage is high∣ly satisfactory:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>In either of these Cases,</HI> says he, <HI>the ut∣most Iniquity must be suppos'd in the Crown, which I must confess I cannot bring my self to do, and therefore my Argu∣ment remains entire.</HI> I very much approve of the Author's
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
dutiful and submissive Behaviour to the Crown, which puts one in mind of the worthy Alderman, who, upon hearing a Member of the Common-Council call the Emperor <HI>Nero a Monster of Cruelty,</HI> told him, <HI>he ought not to speak disre∣spectfully of a Crowned Head.</HI> But if the Author will only go such Lengths with me, as to allow there ever has been a bad Soveraign, or not to shock him with such a Suppositi∣on, that there has ever been a wicked Ministry, and that it is not utterly impossible but there may be such in Times to come, my Argument stands entire. God be thanked, we are now blest with a good King, and with the Pro∣spect of such for our Days, but cannot answer for those who are yet unborn, since they will still be Men, and therefore liable to Imperfection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> was hard set by the Answer of the <HI>Old Whig</HI> to his Arguments, That the <HI>Limitation of the Num∣ber of the Lords wou'd run the Constitution into an Aristo∣cracy,</HI> and has therefore very prudently shuffled the Consi∣deration of that Point under another Head, where he forgets the <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Reply to what was urged against his Opinion in that Case, so that he has visibly given up the Point which was most material in his first <HI>Plebeian.</HI> The <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Re∣mark therefore still stands out against him unanswer'd; and plainly turns his own ill Consequence upon him, by shewing there is a visible Tendency to an Aristocracy as the Con∣stitution now stands, which would be taken away by the Alteration proposed. But it is ungenerous to insult a baffled Adversary; I shall therefore proceed to the next Particular in dispute.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Whig</HI> affirms that <HI>the Power of giving Mo∣ney and raising Taxes is confined to the Body of the Com∣mons,</HI> and that <HI>all the Privileges together of the Lords are not equal to that One of commanding the Purse of the Community.</HI> The <HI>Plebeian</HI> allows the Consequence, but cavils at the Position, which is a received Maxim among the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> the Doctrine of the House
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
of Commons in particular, and established by the Practice of every Parliament in the Memory of Man. Let us now see what the <HI>Plebeian</HI> affirms in Contradiction to it, and by the way observe whether he personates his Part well, and speaks the Language of one who writes himself a <HI>Member of the House of Commons.</HI> The Author asserts, That <HI>whether a Money-Bill may not originally take its Rise in the House of Lords, is a Point never yet clearly given up by their Lordships, if he is not very much misin∣formed.</HI> This Point, if I am not very much misinformed, was never claimed by the House of Lords, and has not a single Precedent in the Practice of that Body in the Legis∣lature.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 13.</NOTE> He afterwards asserts that <HI>the Commons have no more Power over their Fellow-Subjects Estates than the Lords.</HI> Is not the Power of granting a Supply, fixing the Quantum of that Supply, appropriating every Part of it to particular Uses, and settling the Ways and Means for raising it; is not this Power over their Fellow-Subjects E∣states much greater than that of the Lords, who can neither add to, diminish, nor after any one of these Particulars? And if the Power of the Commons extends it self to all these Points, how can the Author further affirm, that <HI>all which is peculiar to the Commons in this Matter is, that they have hitherto been allow'd to chuse what Tax they judged easiest for the People!</HI> But what Shadow of Reason is there for him to proceed in asserting, that <HI>every Day's Experience shews us, that if the Lords differ in Opinion from the Com∣mons, their Power is at an end</HI>; since, on the contrary, Ex∣perience shews us, that whenever the Lords have pretend∣ed to such a Power, they have always been over-ruled by the Commons!<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE> Our Author tells us <HI>the Concurrence of the Lords is as necessary to a Money-Bill as to any other Bill.</HI> That is not deny'd; but he must allow that the Lords Concurrence to a Money-Bill is not of the same Nature with their Concurrence to any other Bill, which they may undoubtedly change, amend, and return upon the Hands of the House of Commons for their Concur∣rence in such Amendments as the Lords shall think proper.
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Besides, to shew the <HI>Plebeian</HI>▪ how much the Purse of the Community is at the Command of the Commons, let him consider the Case of a Vote of Credit, which is transact∣ed wholly between the Soveraign and the Lower House. To this we may add, that the Soveraign himself, in his Speeches to Parliament, applies that Part which relates to Money to the House of Commons, distinct from that of the Lords; by which Method it is plain the Crown sup∣poses those Privileges are vested in the House of Commons, to which every Member of that House has always pretend∣ed, excepting the present Author.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> in the next Paragraph makes use of a very sure and wise Method of confounding his Antagonist, by putting his own Sense upon a Passage in that Author's Pam∣phlet. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> represents how dangerous it would be to our Constitution, if the Crown, which is already pos∣sest of a certain Means to over-rule one Branch of the Le∣gislature, should ever be able to influence the Elections of a House of Commons, so as to gain one to its Measures; in which Case, if Liberty was endanger'd in the Lower House, it could not make a Stand in the other. The <HI>Ple∣beian</HI> perverts this Meaning after the following Manner; <HI>This Author,</HI> says he, <HI>assures us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>that the Crown has Power enough to gain a House of Commons of what Complexion it pleases</HI>; and after puzzling himself in his own voluntary Blunder, is displeased with the <HI>Old Whig</HI> for not proposing to cure an Inconvenience which he never affirmed to be in the House of Commons, as well as that which he proves to be in the House of Lords; so that he would have had him quit the Subject which he had undertaken, to speak of one which he had nothing to do with. But sup∣posing the <HI>Plebeian</HI> had rightly stated the Sense of the Au∣thor, the Inconvenience in the House of Lords is that which is woven into its very Constitution, and therefore at all times exposes us to its ill Consequences; whereas what the <HI>Plebeian</HI> suggests with regard to the House of
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Commons, is only extrinsick, and accidental to that Body, if it ever happens in it.</P>
<P>It is not probable that this Dispute between the <HI>Ple∣beian</HI> and the <HI>Old Whig</HI> will last many Weeks: But if there was time to discuss the whole Point, I think it may be shown to a Demonstration, that the Check of the Crown upon the House of Commons, which is the Power of <HI>Dissolution,</HI> is, by infinite Degrees, a weaker Check than that it has in the present Constitution upon the House of Lords, which is the Power of <HI>Adding</HI> to it what Num∣ber, at what Time, and for what Purpose it pleases: Nay, that the Power of Dissolution is also in its Nature a Check upon the House of Lords as it dissolves them in a Legislative Capacity, and may break the most dangerous Cabals against the Crown, which are such as may be formed between the Leaders of the Two Houses. These two Points, if drawn out into such Considerations as naturally rise from them, wou'd fully establish the Necessity of three Branches in a perfect Legislature, and demonstrate that they shou'd be so far separate and distinct from each other, as is essential to Legislative Bodies: Or, as the <HI>Old Whig</HI> has before ex∣plained it, <Q>If one Part of the Legislature may any ways be invested with a Power to force either of the other Two to concur with it, the Legislative Power is in Re∣ality, whatever it may pretend to, divided into no more than two Branches.</Q></P>
<P>I have hitherto followed the <HI>Plebeian</HI> in his own Me∣thod, by examining, <HI>First,</HI> his Replies to the Objections made by the <HI>Old Whig</HI>; and come now to his <HI>Second</HI> ge∣neral Head, wherein he formally proposes to <HI>consider the Argument as the Old Whig states it himself.</HI> And here I was not a little surprized to find, that instead of answering the several distinct Arguments urged by that Author, in Defence of the Bill: as drawn from the Nature of Govern∣ment in general; from the <HI>British</HI> Constitution; from its
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Effects on the Crown; on the House of Commons; on the whole Body of the <HI>English</HI> Commonalty; and from the ill Consequences it wou'd remedy in the present Consti∣tution; the <HI>Plebeian</HI> contents himself with attacking but one single Argument of his Antagonist. Till the <HI>Plebeian</HI> shall have answer'd those other Points, I shall take it for granted, that he gives them up. Not to multiply Words, I believe every Reader will allow me that an Author is not to be much regarded, who writes professedly in Answer to a Discourse which proceeds on many Arguments, when he singles out the Argument only which he thinks is the weakest; especially when he fails in his Answer even to that single Argument. A famous <HI>French</HI> Author compares the imaginary Triumphs of such a kind of Disputant, whom he was then dealing with, to those of <HI>Claudius,</HI> which, in∣stead of being represented by the strong Towns he had taken, and the Armies he had defeated, were testified to the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> by a Present of Cockle-Shells that he had gather'd up on the Sea-Shore.</P>
<P>But to come to the Matter before us. The <HI>Old Whig,</HI> after having considered it in several Views, examines it with Regard to the whole Bulk of the <HI>British</HI> Commons. Un∣der this Head he has the following Words. <Q>But the great Point, and which ought to carry the chief Weight with us in this Case, is, that the Alteration now propos'd, will give such a mighty Power to the Bulk of the <HI>English</HI> Commons, as can be never counterbalanc'd by the Body of the Nobility.</Q> Now what the <HI>Old Whig</HI> here calls the Great Point with Regard to the Commonalty of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Plebeian</HI> insinuates he calls the Great Point with Regard to the whole Controversy, and descants upon it accordingly. Whereas it is evident the Author insists upon many Points as Great as This in other Views of the Question. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> affirms, that the <HI>Commonalty</HI> has infinitely more Wealth than the <HI>Nobility,</HI> which was the proper Conside∣ration of this Place. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> returns for Answer,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
that the <HI>Commonalty</HI> is indeed much richer than the <HI>Nobi∣lity,</HI> but that the <HI>House of Commons</HI> is not so rich; which was not the proper Consideration of this Place. It is im∣possible for a Disputant to lose the Cause, who is a Master of such Distinctions. I remember I was once present at an University Disputation, which was managed on the one Side by a notable <HI>Peripatetick.</HI> The Question which he defended in the Negative was, <HI>Whether Comets are a∣bove the Moon?</HI> The Sophister being press'd very hard by the Force of Demonstration, very gravely extricated him∣self out of it by the following Distinction. <HI>Comets,</HI> said he, <HI>are Two-fold,</HI> Supra-lunar, <HI>and</HI> Sub-lunar. <HI>That</HI> Supra-lu∣nar <HI>Comets are above the Moon I do allow; but that</HI> Sub-lunar <HI>Comets are above the Moon I utterly deny. And it is of this latter kind of Comets that the Question is to be un∣derstood.</HI></P>
<P>The Fallacy of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Answer being thus far dis∣cover'd, all that he further adds in his own way of arguing will be easily confuted by unravelling the Matter which he has very artificially perplex'd. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> supposes that every Lord in the Legislature, taken one with another, may be worth 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, in which, for Argument's sake, every one knows his Concession has been vastly too liberal. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> values every Member of the House of Com∣mons at 800 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> one with another, in which 'tis plain he has been exceeding Scanty. Nay many are of Opinion that upon casting up the whole Sum of Property that now resides in the House of Lords, it wou'd not exceed that which is in the House of Commons. If this Particular ap∣proaches to the Truth, all the Arguments of a Superior Power arising from its greater Property fall to the Ground of themselves, as being raised on a false Foundation. To which I must further add, that if this increasing Power still continues in the Crown, the Property of the House of Peers will <HI>indisputably</HI> surmount that of the House of Com∣mons; and that on the contrary, if the Bill passes, it visi∣bly
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
tends to prevent the Impoverishment of the House of Commons in point of Property, and to fill it with Men of such Estates, as in a few Years will be more than a Counter∣balance to the House of Lords, even under this View.</P>
<P>But further to shew the Weakness of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Rea∣sonings upon this Head, I will allow that the House of Lords enjoy at present, and may still continue to enjoy, a greater Share of Property than the House of Commons. But not∣withstanding this Concession, to which the Nature of the Thing does not oblige me, it is still evident that the immense Property which subsists in the Bulk of the <HI>English</HI> Com∣mons, will render their Representatives more powerful than the Body of the Lords. This will plainly appear from considering the very Nature of Representatives; from those Junctures which can possibly give them an Occasion of ex∣erting their Power; and from Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>It is implied in the very Nature of Representatives, that they are back'd with the Power of those whom they represent: As the Demands of a Plenipotentiary, let his Personal Wealth or Power be as little as you please, have the same Weight with them as if they were made by the Person of his Principal. I will beg leave to borrow from the <HI>Plebeian</HI> an Example of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> which, as he makes use of it, has no manner of Analogy with the Subject of the Dispute. Is not the whole Stock of that nu∣merous Community under the Guidance of a few Directors? And will any one say, that these Directors have no other Influence on the Publick, than what arises to them from the Share which they personally enjoy in that Stock? The Author urges that the Peers are Principals, which in Reality is the reason why their Power is not to be apprehended in Oppo∣sition to that of the Commons; whereas were they only Representatives of a Body immensely rich and numerous, they wou'd beside their own Personal Property have such a Support, as wou'd make them truly formidable. The
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
whole Commons of <HI>England</HI> are the Principals on one side, as the Lords are the Principals on the other; and which of these Principals are arm'd with most Power and Pro∣perty?</P>
<P>To consider in the next place those Junctures that can possibly give them an Occasion of exerting their Power it is on both sides suppos'd to be in such Cases as will affect the Rights of the <HI>English</HI> Commonalty, in which Case every Commoner of <HI>England</HI> is as much concern'd as any of their Representatives. Thus if four <HI>London</HI> Citizens, to make the Case exactly parallel, were deputed to maintain the Rights of their Principals, as Citizens, who can imagine that they wou'd not be supported by the whole Power and Property of the City, and not be too hard for any two or three great Men, who had ten times their Personal Estates? Now as the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Supposition reduces things to the last Extremity, it can only take place in a Rupture, which is never likely to happen. And in that Case, as these two great Bo∣dies must act separately, there is no room for considering how far the Concurrence of the House of Lords is neces∣sary in a Money Bill, which entirely takes away the Author's Reasoning in his 13th Page.</P>
<P>But Matters of Fact are the best Arguments. We both agree that Power arises out of Property, and the Author himself has given an Instance of the Power of the House of Commons in having been able to effect the Ruin of the Monarchy and Peerage. Whence had the Commons this Power, but from being supported by their Principals?</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> thinks he strengthens his Point, by adding that the Lords are a fixt Body. To this I might reply, that the Principals of the House of Commons are as fixt a Body as the Lords; and therefore, however their Representa∣tives may vary, they will continue intent, from Age to Age, to assert and vindicate their peculiar Rights and Privileges,

unless we can believe that any Body of Men will act against those two strong Motives of Self-Interest and Self-Preser∣vation. I might further venture to say, that Men of the greatest Wealth and Weight in the House of Commons, are almost as sure of a Seat there, as if it came to 'em by Inhe∣ritance. But supposing the House of Lords never so much fix'd, and so manageable by two or three great Men (for which very reason Additions are very often made to 'em, which the Alteration wou'd prevent); we have seen that their United Power, if their Number is limited, can never be a Match for that of the House of Commons, supposing still such a Rupture, as the <HI>Plebeian</HI> all along imagines, in which each Body is to act separately for it self.</P>
<P>The Author, in the remaining part of his Pamphlet, ap∣pears like every Writer that is driven out of all his Holds. He endeavours to set the Crown, and the whole Body of Peers, upon his Adversary; accuses him in effect of <HI>Scan∣dalum Magnatum</HI>; nay, and gives very broad Intimations that he ought to be indicted for High-Treason.</P>
<P>I shou'd not have given my self, or the Publick, all this Trouble, had I not been so peremptorily call'd to it by the last <HI>Plebeian.</HI> I do assure him, my Silence hitherto was not the effect of Old Age, as it has made me <HI>Slow,</HI> but to tell him the Truth, as it has made me a little <HI>Testy,</HI> and consequently impatient of Contradiction, when I find my self in the right. I must own however, that the Writer of the <HI>Plebeian</HI> has made the most of a Weak Cause, and do be∣lieve that a good one wou'd shine in his Hands; for which reason I shall advise him, as a Friend, if he goes on in his <HI>new Vocation,</HI> to take care that he be as happy in the Choice of his Subject, as he is in the Talents of a Pamphleteer.</P>
