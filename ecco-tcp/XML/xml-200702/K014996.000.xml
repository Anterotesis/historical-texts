<HEAD>THE CASE OF ENGLAND, AND THE <HI>PROTESTANT INTEREST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce the present condition of the Kingdom, and the whole Prote∣stant Interest by the conjunction of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> abroad, and a a more horrid combination of several at home, must needs affect with the most melancholy Reflections all true English Hearts, such as have any real love or zeal for their Religion, or their native Country. I cannot think it amiss to present a short and impartial View <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o such as have not considered the same.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the last Age, the Protestant Interest in <HI>Europe</HI> was more than a Match for the Roman Catholick; the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was almost all Protestant; near half the Subjects of <HI>Hungary,</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Moravia,</HI> were Protestant (and did many times defend themselves by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Emperor himself, when oppress'd by him for the sake of their Religion.) That in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Houses of <HI>Newburgh</HI> were Protestant, the <HI>Palatinates</HI> for the most part of them Protestant, of the strictest sort; the <HI>Saxons</HI> entirely Protestant, and being hearty unanimous, and seated in the midst of <HI>Germany,</HI> were a Bulwark and Defence to the Protestants of many other lesser States as often as they were oppress'd for their Religion, by their own or their neighbouring Princes: That many of the Subjects of <HI>Bava∣ria, Bamburgh, Cologn, Wurtzburgh</HI> and <HI>Worms</HI> were Protestants. Besides these,
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
that the Protestants of <HI>France</HI> were so powerful, as to maintain 8 or 9 Civil Wars in defence of their Religion, and always came off with ad∣vantage. The <HI>Vaudois</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> were all of them Protestant, and great num∣bers of the Inhabitants of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Low Countries were of the Reform'd Religion. Besides, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Northern Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Dutchy of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> were entirely Prote∣stant. But now instead of this, is not the Protestant Power destroyed almost over <HI>Europe?</HI> The whole Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia</HI> entirely Popish? Are not the Protestants of <HI>Poland, Austria, Moravia</HI> utterly destroyed? Is not their destruction now carrying on, and almost finish'd in <HI>Hungary?</HI> In <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Newburghers</HI> of Protestants are become fierce Enemies of the Protestant Religion. The Protestants of <HI>Bavaria, Bamburgh, Cologn, Wurtz∣burgh</HI> and <HI>Worms</HI> are all destroyed. In <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Low Countries, <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Vaudois,</HI> after long and mighty Struggles, the Religion is utterly extinguished. Against the poor <HI>Palatinates</HI> the Persecution is now carrying on with its usual barbarity, and their Neighbours the <HI>Saxons</HI> are so far from being able to help them, that they are under the fearful Apprehensi∣ons of suffering the like from their own Prince (lately turned Roman Ca∣tholick to obtain the Kingdom of <HI>Poland)</HI> so soon as his Wars with <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> and other troubles created him by his Polish and Lithuanian Subjects will give him leave. Besides this, two Northern Princes have given great cause to suspect their conversion to the Romish Religion: That <HI>Sweden</HI> by its separation from the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> by the <HI>Baltick,</HI> is unable to give assistance to the Protestants in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> without the consent of the <HI>German</HI> Princes bordering on the Baltick, which will never be granted by Papists in favour of the Protestants.</P>
<P>Thus the Protestant Religion which had spread it self over almost all <HI>Europe,</HI> which had gain'd the entire possession of some Countrys, the greater part of others, and mighty Interest in most, has through the restless malice and endeavours of its Enemies, been subverted and destroyed in Country after County, till it is at last reduced to a little Corner of what it once possest <HI>(England</HI> and <HI>Holland)</HI> And do we think our Enemies will not accomplish (what they have thus prosperously carried on so far) our utter Destruction? Is it not high time then to think our selves in dan∣ger, to look about us to enquire what it is hath thus weakend us, brought us so near our ruin, what measures will certainly accomplish it, and what we must take for the prevention of it?</P>
<P>The Romish Methods of converting the Protestants have been in all Countries the same, <HI>viz.</HI> Confiscation of their Estates, Goals and Impri∣sonments, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, and Sword, dragooning and massacring, and inflicting the most inhuman torments that rage and fury cou'd invent upon such, whose resolution and zeal for their Religion cou'd not be moved by the former means.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
If this be the true case of <HI>England,</HI> and the Protestant Religion, then what is wanting to give the finishing stroke to our destruction, but only an ability in the King of <HI>France</HI> to break the Powers of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> And when we consider how in the year 1672. the King of <HI>France</HI> marched his Army through the midst of <HI>Flanders,</HI> fell directly upon <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> then unprovided, enter'd their strongest Towns like open Villages; some without defence, or almost denial, most of them without any blows at all, and all of them with very few, and made himself Master, of three parts of <HI>Holland</HI> in 2 months time; for which Sir <HI>W. T.</HI> K. <HI>C.</HI> II's Ambassador (then in <HI>Holland)</HI> tells us the reason was, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> then not suspecting such a thing, had no Field-Army sufficient to encounter their Enemies, or succour any Town: That walled Towns will not de∣fend the men within, unless the hearts of the Men will defend their Walls: That no Garison will make any resolute defence, without the prospect or hopes at least of relief. 'Tis true, that the <HI>French</HI> King having then all <HI>Flanders</HI> on his back, garison'd with <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops (then his implacable Enemies) a powerful Army of the <HI>German</HI> Princes matching upon him down the <HI>Rhine; Spain</HI> and <HI>England</HI> (alarm'd by his successes) preparing to attack him on all quarters, was glad to vomit up all again, and return home with as much precipitancy, as he had invaded them, least the Pro∣visions and retreat of his Army through <HI>Flanders</HI> should be cut off. But now the case is otherwise, he has possess'd himself of <HI>Flanders,</HI> extended his Dominion to the very Frontiers of <HI>Holland;</HI> Spain <HI>is all united to him, some</HI> German <HI>Princes (then his Enemies) are now become his Friends; others enter'd into conditions of Neutrality with him:</HI> And should he now by a fatal Battle (which God of his infinite mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) break the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, which they have with infinite Charge and matchless Vigour, gather'd up from <HI>Denmark, Brandenburgh,</HI> and other remote Countries of <HI>Germany,</HI> might he not enter the heart of their Country? And whence then can their strong Cities and Towns depend upon relief? May he not as former∣ly enter 'em like open Villages? May he not as formerly possess himself of their whole Country in less than one Campaign? It was the opinion of that great Statesman, Sir <HI>W.T.</HI> That <HI>Polland</HI> wou'd make a stout resi∣stance in any quarrel remote from their own doors; but that which ena∣bles them (their Wealth) to carry on a foreign War with Vigour, wou'd in a War at home render 'em defenceless Rich and populous Towns are not fit for Sieges, or were ever known to make any long and resolute de∣fence. If this be our case, if the whole power of the Protestant Religi∣on rests now in a manner in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> if the destruction of <HI>England,</HI> as well as of our holy Religion must inevitably follow the loss of <HI>Holland.</HI> If <HI>Holland</HI> by one unfortunate Battle might happen to be lost in one Campaign or less, Are we not in a most sad and deplorable Con∣dition?
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
and if some Men are without their Fears, Have we not the greater reason to fear for our selves, our Religion, and our Country. What shou'd we judg of those who tell us, 'tis too early yet for <HI>England</HI> to declare? The Enemy has raised his Armies, furnish'd his Magazines; and 'tis too early for us to think of raising a Man. The Enemy is before our Outworks, and 'tis too soon for us to prepare our selves to be on our guard: Will not those Men tell us, when <HI>Holland</HI> is lost, 'twill then be too late? To what purpose (will they say) now do you think of raising Forces? Is not the <HI>French</HI> King Master of <HI>Holland?</HI> Possess'd of all their Ports? Where will you land 'em? To what use will you put 'em? Does not such Language as this plainly shew the intention of the Authors? Is it not plainly to deliver us blindfold, bound hand and foot into the Ene∣mies hand? Is not their design now so visible as not to be disguised? Do not some of the Party begin to throw off the Mask, and tell us, 'Twill not be well with us till our old Master returns, till the Government returns to its natural Channel. And are not those that were the very Tools and In∣struments of Popery and Arbitrary Power in former Reigns, and that owe their Lives to Acts of Indempnity in this, industriously represented by some as the Patriots of their Country; and by a strange kind of Paradox those that have been always hearty for the Church, and were for defending of it when others were for pulling it down; that were hearty for the King's Accession to the Throne, and to his Person and Government ever since, are represented as betrayers of us, as having sold us to <HI>France:</HI> Would it not be a piece of rare refin'd Policy, if <HI>France</HI> could hang up her great∣est Enemies, under the Nation of her dearest Friends, and give Encou∣ragement to her antient Frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> under the Notion of being her Enemies.</P>
<P>Let us therefore while it is yet in our power (as we tender our Religion and our Country) use our utmost Endeavours by all legal ways to assu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Majesty and his Government, against all his and our Enemies both at home and abroad; and in the words of our Liturgy, let us offer up our most servent Prayers to God Amighty, <HI>Give peace in our time, O Lord, because there is none other that figureth for us but only thou, O God!</HI></P>
