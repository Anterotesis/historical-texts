<L>FAR off (no matter whether <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West,</HI></L>
<L>A real Country, or one made in jest)</L>
<L>Not yet by modern MANDEVILLES disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Nor by <HI>Map-jobbers</HI> wretchedly misplac'd,</L>
<L>There lies an <HI>Island,</HI> neither great nor small,</L>
<L>Which, for distinction sake, I GOTHAM call.</L>
</LG>

<L>The Man, who finds an unknown Country out,</L>

<L>The pious Christian thinks not worth his care.</L>
<L>Bar this pretence, and into air is hurl'd</L>
<L>The claim of EUROPE to the <HI>Western World.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cast by a tempest on the savage coast,</L>
<L>Some roving Buccaneer set up a Post;</L>
<L>A Beam, in proper form transversely laid,</L>
<L>Of his Redeemer's Cross the figure made,</L>
<L>Of that Redeemer, with whose laws his life,</L>
<L>From first to last, had been one scene of strife;</L>
<L>His royal master's name thereon engrav'd,</L>
<L>Without more process, the whole race enslav'd,</L>
<L>Cut off that Charter they from Nature drew,</L>
<L>And made them Slaves to men they never knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search antient histories, consult records,</L>
<L>Under this title the most Christian Lords</L>
<L>Hold (thanks to Conscience) more than half the Ball;</L>
<L>O'erthrow this title, they have none at all.</L>
<L>For never yet might any Monarch dare,</L>
<L>Who liv'd to Truth, and breath'd a Christian air,</L>
<L>Pretend that Christ (who came, we all agree,</L>
<L>To bless his people, and to set them free)</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>To make a Convert ever one law gave,</L>
<L>By which Converters made him first a slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Spite of the glosses of a canting Priest,</L>
<L>Who talks of Charity, but means a feast,</L>
<L>Who recommends it (whilst he seems to feel</L>
<L>The holy glowings of a real zeal)</L>
<L>To all his hearers, as a deed of worth,</L>
<L>To give them heav'n, whom they have robb'd of earth,</L>
<L>Never shall One, One truly honest man,</L>
<L>Who, blest with LIBERTY, reveres her plan,</L>
<L>Allow one moment, that a Savage sire</L>
<L>Could from his wretched race, for childish hire,</L>
<L>By a wild grant, their All, their Freedom pass,</L>
<L>And sell his Country for a bit of glass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or grant this barb'rous right, Let SPAIN and FRANCE,</L>
<L>In Slav'ry bred, as purchasers advance,</L>
<L>Let them, whilst Conscience is at distance hurl'd,</L>
<L>With some gay bawble buy a golden world;</L>
<L>An ENGLISHMAN, in <HI>charter'd</HI> FREEDOM born,</L>
<L>Shall spurn the slavish merchandize, shall scorn</L>

<L>Happy the Savage of those <HI>early</HI> times</L>
<L>'Ere EUROPE's sons were known, and EUROPE's crimes!</L>
<L>Gold, cursed Gold! slept in the womb of earth,</L>
<L>Unfelt its mischiefs, as unknown its worth;</L>
<L>In full Content he found the truest wealth;</L>
<L>In Toil he found Diversion, Food, and Health;</L>
<L>Strange to the ease and luxury of Courts,</L>
<L>His Sports were Labours, and his Labours Sports;</L>
<L>His Youth was hardy, and his Old Age green;</L>
<L>Life's Morn was vig'rous, and her Eve serene;</L>
<L>No rules he held, but what were made for use;</L>
<L>No Arts he learn'd, nor ills which Arts produce;</L>
<L>False Lights he follow'd, but believ'd them true;</L>
<L>He knew not much, but liv'd to what he knew.</L>

<L>Since EUROPE took their <HI>Gold,</HI> and gave them <HI>Grace!</HI></L>

<L>And, on sure grounds the Gospel Pile to rear,</L>
<L>Sends <HI>Missionary</HI> Felons ev'ry Year;</L>

<L>Her Want of Prudence means, and Arms supplies,</L>
<L>Whilst her brave rage, not satisfied with life,</L>
<L>Rising in blood, adopts the <HI>Scalping-Knife</HI>;</L>
<L>Knowledge She gives, enough to make them know</L>
<L>How abject is their State, how deep their Woe;</L>
<L>The Worth of Freedom strongly She explains,</L>
<L>Whilst She bows down, and loads their necks with Chains;</L>
<L>Faith too She plants, for her own ends imprest,</L>
<L>To make them bear the worst, and hope the best;</L>
<L>And whilst She teaches on vile int'rest's plan,</L>
<L>As Laws of God, the wild decrees of man,</L>
<L>Like PHARISERS, of whom the Scriptures tell,</L>
<L>She makes them ten times more the Sons of Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But whither do these grave reflexions tend?</L>
<L>Are they design'd for any, or no end?</L>
<L>Briefly but thisâ€”to prove, that by no act</L>
<L>Which Nature made, that by no equal pact</L>
<L>'Twixt Man and Man, which might, if Justice heard,</L>
<L>Stand good, that by no benefits conferr'd,</L>
<L>Or purchase made, EUROPE in chains can hold</L>
<L>The Sons of INDIA, and her mines of gold.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Chance led her there in an accursed hour,</L>
