<HEAD>To Her Royal Highness Princess <HI>AMELIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Addresses of this Sort are made to Persons of your Royal Highness's elevated State, it is, I believe usual, previously to supplicate Leave for their Reception—But here I pre∣sume, it would have been as equally needless for the author, to have implor∣ed your royal highness's name, for pro∣tectress in the Cause of Virtue, as it would be for the Master of the Mint, to petition in Form your royal Father, for Leave to stamp his Name on our coin to give Sanction to its Currency.</P>
<P>The Inducements, Madam, to throw this Piece, therefore, under your royal highness's protection, were solely from considering it as an act of duty, added to the Pride of having the high ho∣nour to subscribe myself,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by a Gentleman.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>AS in the airy Regions of Romance,</L>
<L>Th' adventrous Knight sets out with Shield and Lance,</L>
<L>Strait his disinterested Valour flies</L>
<L>To helpless Damsels, and to Beauty's Cries;</L>
<L>This only Motive rising in his Breast,</L>
<L>The Godlike Plea—of Innocence distress'd.</L>
<L>Thus dares our Author-Errant of To-Night,</L>
<L>In Virtue's Aid romantically fight;</L>
<L>Sacred to Her, the Champion Pen he draws,</L>
<L>Enough rewarded—to support her Cause.</L>
<L>To-Night his honest Labour means to prove,</L>
<L>A low-born Virtue worth a great Man's Love;</L>
<L>An honest Pride, where conscious Honour glows;</L>
<L>An artless Innocence—whence Truth still flows;</L>
<L>A Sense proceeding but from Nature's Light,</L>
<L>(For little Knowledge serves us to be right)</L>
<L>A Merit greatly poor, that far outshines</L>
<L>The Glare of Titles, or the Wealth of Mines.</L>
<L>Such stedfast Honesty should find Success</L>
<L>O'er the abandon'd Authors of Distress,</L>
<L>O'er those who glory to betray a Maid,</L>
<L>Who welcome Guilt, and make Deceit a Trade.</L>
<L>Yet some there are less liable to blame,</L>
<L>Who only want Reflection to reclaim,</L>
<L>Who bend unthinking to the Syren's Voice,</L>
<L>The Reprobates of Custom, not of Choice;</L>
<L>Who deaf to Precept, plead Example still,</L>
<L>And think the Mode indemnifies the Ill.</L>
<L>To such our Author offers this Address,</L>
<L>Not certain, nor despairing of Success;</L>
<L>Amongst this Cast of Men he hopes to find</L>
<L>Some Converts—for the Honour of Mankind;</L>
<L>On Minds like these his Morals may prevail,</L>
<L>And who escap'd a Sermon, feel this Tale.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>MERCY on us! why this House is going to be turn'd topsy-turvy, to be sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did not I tell thee some strange Combustion would happen from my Dream?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, to be sure, Dreams, Dreams are great Prognosticators.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry</SPEAKER>
<P>Prognosticators!—Ay, marry, be they; they never fair'd me yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Benj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor me—for ye all know the very next Day after I dream'd I fell into the Horse-pond, and <HI>Arthur</HI> here took me out half drown'd, and brought me to the Kitchen Fire, and, methought, being mortal weak, I fell out of the Chair, and was scorch'd most fearfully; and to be sure the next Day—ay—the very next Day—was I taken with the Ague and Fever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my Book of Dreams gives 'mazing Ac∣counts
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
of Robbers being taken, and Murders brought to light seven Years after they were done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—to be sure—But, prithee, <HI>Harry,</HI> tell us thy Dream.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Benj.<LB/>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Ay, let's hear it, let's hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why last Market-day I came home, as 'twere a little tipsy, and laid me down i'th' Stable, on a Truss of Straw, and fell fast asleep; and there, what should I dream, but that our House was turn'd into a Windmill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful, Sirs!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, a Windmill,—and that Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> Master's <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> House keeper, was the Miller's Man, and we four, to be sure, turn'd into Asses—and—murrain take her—nothing would serve her turn, but she would have us to draw in place o'th' Horses;—but methought we were plaguy resty—for, to be sure, never was the like heard of; and jirk us about she did most cruelly.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, they say she's a mortal cross Woman—Well, well, but so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So methought, at a little Distance from the Mill, was good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> our House-keeper here, and pretty Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> my late Lady's waiting Wo∣man, with each a Bundle under their Arms, as if so be they were going to seek their Fortunes—And is not all this now plainly made out—is not the whole House in a Quandary, and a terrible Uproar? Is not the 'Squire, as it were, turn'd to another sort of a Man, and mainly alter'd for the worse? And are not Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI> discharged out of their Service, and ordered to gather up their Things and provide them∣selves?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and does not Master <HI>Longman,</HI> the Ste∣ward, say the 'Squire talks of sending for that same Mrs. <HI>Jewkes?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Benj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and then comes our Share of this woeful Dream.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, my Lads, I have some sweet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bitter too—I overheard Master <HI>Longman</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y"/>
tell Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> the 'Squire was looking out for a Wife, and that will be a rare Time for Vails, for to be sure we shall have more Comers and Goers than a Beehive in a Summer's Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, marry, those wou'd be joyful Times, in∣deed, and I wish, with all my Heart, the poor dear Souls Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Pamela</HI> were to stay and take part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Benj.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a murrain makes the 'Squire in such a Fluster with them tho'?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you must know Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> they say, has been a little too bold, and given Master untoward Answers and you know he's deadly haughty and pas∣sionate but, poor Soul, I wonder how it should chance so, for to be sure I never heard her give any living Soul in the House a wry Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I—she's as gentle as a Lamb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Benj.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more Gall than a Pidgeon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> told Master, and talk'd a little roundly they say, which made his Honour in such a desperate Passion, that he ordered her to pro∣vide too—Odsheart, that same <HI>Pamela</HI>'s a dainty Girl—but deadly shy; I don't think a Ser∣vant in the House durst ever give her so much as a ci∣vil Salute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, no matter for that, she's a pre∣cious good-natur'd Soul—Odso, here's the Steward and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>—she's giving up her Charge,—and 'twon't become us to be seen loitering here.</P>

<STAGE>Enter Mr. LONGMRN and Mrs. JERVIS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> you find every Thing properly and justly accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>So justly, good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that I am under great Concern to find my Master's Warmth of Temper so little consistent with his Interest, to discharge a Person from his Family who has many Years with
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
such Prudence and Justice so well acquitted her Trust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Approbation of my Conduct, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> (next to that of our Master's) is its best Justification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have more than that, good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> the Approbation and good Wishes of the whole Family, which seldom go hand in hand with a Fruga∣lity like yours, for the good Opinion of the lower Ser∣vants in a Family is rarely obtain'd but by Indulgencies hurtful to the Interest of its Master—And I cou'd wish you'd give me Leave (for the Advantage and Plea∣sure of our's) to solicit Mr. <HI>Belvile</HI> for your Continu∣ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> there are many prevailing Reasons to accept with Pleasure your kind offer—And what I am apt to think may induce his Honour not to reject it, is the Removal of the dear, un∣happy, tho' innocent Occasion of his Resentment to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lovely <HI>Pamela</HI> you mean! Oh, Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI> there is I fear another Motive which your Discretion and Regard to my Master's Honour has con∣cealed, that renders his Resentment, as you call it, in∣excusable to both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But his complying with the good Girl's earnest Request to be sent home to her Father and Mo∣ther, is, I think, a sufficient Proof of his Resolution no longer to entertain such Thoughts that might (as you but too justly suspect) prove hurtful to dear <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Virtue and his own Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true—and I am heartily re∣joiced to find the Temptation will be remov'd from both, for 'twou'd be a hard Task, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> for poor <HI>Pamela,</HI> strong as she is in Virtue, to withstand the artful insinuating Snares of a handsome wealthy Man, like our Master, and I fear a much harder for him to overcome his too warm Desire for so tempting an Object, were they to have constant Opportunities of seeing each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd have few Fears of her Side, were I certain he would employ no other Power than Persuasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I think the young Creature's al∣most unequall'd, by any of her tender Years, in the Principles of Piety and Virtue—And it warms my very Heart, that one so young should so earnestly pre∣fer sharing the Poverty of her good Parents, with the Preservation of her Honesty, to all the enticing Baits of Finery and Grandeur, with the Loss of it—but, however, 'tis better as it is—But it is now pretty near the Time his Honour order'd me to attend him in his Closet with your Accounts, and then I'll make bold to tell him my Opinion, in relation to you. Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> a good Day to you.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<P>How weakly founded is the Opinion that Happiness is seated in large Possessions; tho' till lately I have had but little Reason to dissent from that Opinion, and have ever made my Fortune subservient to my Pleasures—and shall I now suffer a peevish low born Girl to inter∣rupt their Course, and with the musty Principles of Virtue preach me from my Purpose?—No! I am de∣termin'd not to sacrifice my Pursuits of Pleasure and substantial Joy to her wild imaginary Notions of Virtue and Honour.—'Tis certainly the first Time they ever took such deep Root in a Cottage, and I'll yet try if I have not Force enough to destroy these wondrous rural Battlements, and reduce the romantic Governor to capitulate.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> have you look'd over this insolent House-keeper's Accounts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and find them in every Article just to a Tittle—and I hope, Sir, you'll not be offended if
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
I presume to say, I fear 'twill be difficult for your Ho∣nour to meet with a Servant with less Insolence and so much Fidelity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thou imaginest the chief Merit of Ser∣vants consists in their Honesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, Sir, I think it is so in all Man∣kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a Sign thou hast convers'd but little with the gay World.—Amongst them the strongest Ce∣ment of Regard is the mutual Indulgence of each o∣thers Pleasures—and Morals make up no Part of their Friendships—but in Servants 'tis an absolute Duty, to conform to their Master's Foibles, and shew an implicit Obedience to all his Commands—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I take the Liberty, Sir, of giving my Opinion on this Head, tho' it differs from your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, were it possible, and I think it hardly so, that your Honour should impose any Com∣mands on me, which my little Portion of Reason inform∣ed me would prove prejudicial to your Morals, Cha∣racter, and Reputation, I should think myself as much bound in Duty to <HI>reject</HI> such Commands, and use my weak Endeavours to convince you of their Consequence, as I have thought myself bound to <HI>obey</HI> you in all you have hitherto been pleas'd to honour me with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure this old Fellow has no Suspicion of my Attempts on <HI>Pamela</HI> <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> But, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> do you think me capable of imposing any Commands on Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> that might prove pernicious to my Ho∣nour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, good Sir—You were pleased to mention an implicit Duty necessary in Servants, and that drew from me my Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I might—but as the Sentiments of others, not my own—and I am so well convinced of Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Regard both to my Honour and Inte∣rest, that now Passion has subsided, were she to make a Concession I would restore her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, she makes the humblest, and by me in∣treats your Goodness to replace her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she employ you for that Purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long</SPEAKER>
<P>She did, Sir; and I hope not in vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, she may continue—but I'll be sworn you have no such Commission from that obstinate Baggage <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir,—the poor young Creature is so much transported with the Thoughts of returning, and paying her Duty to her good Parents, she seems little employed about any other Concern, yet often expresses the most grateful Acknowledgments for the bountiful Favours bestowed on her by you, Sir, and my good Lady your Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake her, <HI>Longman</HI>—she's quite in∣sensible to all Gratitude, and looks upon 'em merely as due to her great Merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merit, Sir! With Submission, I have always observ'd in her the greatest Meekness and Humility, and that's the Character the whole Family gives her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, she's a very Idol with you all—but no more of her.—Order <HI>Robin,</HI> my <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> Coach∣man, to attend me an Hour hence.</P>

No, my heart should rather overflow with thankfulness at my happy, blest deliverance, and my Master's Resolution, in permitting me to return to my dear Parents, with that Blessing which will cheer their honest Minds, and make 'em shed Tears of Joy and Gladness over their innocent Child, tho' almost beat down with poverty and old Age. <STAGE>[Wiping her Eyes.</STAGE></P>

<P>What still disconsolate, my dear <HI>Pamela?</HI> I thought thy Heart had now been easy, and thou hadst done with Tears.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam</SPEAKER>
<P>With all that gave me pain, I hope I have; but these, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> fall from a quite different cause; the reflecting on the comfortable Joy, I shall both give and receive, in meeting my good old Parents.</P>

<P>Well thou art a miracle of innocence and duty, I shall never be able to bear the House when thou art gone—'twill break my Heart—but let me hear from thee, my dearest <HI>Pamela,</HI> and don't forget me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I should have little Title to that Goodness and merit you have often praised in me, cou'd I be capable of forgetting that tender, and even motherly affection you have always shewn me; and be assured, next the Love and Duty I owe my dear Parents, you have the largest share in the heart of poor <HI>Pamela,</HI> who can only testify her Gratitude by Words.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dearest Child, I want no other Proofs; but my good Girl, why dost thou keep on these Cloaths still? are you resolved to go in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, no doubt—they are the properest; these I can wear without reproach from my poor neigh∣bours or to myself, at the Fruit of innocence alone, and honest industry.</P>

<P>Why so you may many others, my good old Lady gave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they'll all appear too fine and flaunting for my humble Station; nor when they are gone can the circumstances of my poor Parents afford me any like 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a dear prudent Soul—Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> his honour has ordered the Travelling-Chariot to carry you, and <HI>Lincolnshire Robin</HI> to drive; but he directed me to tell you, he must see you before you go and that he has something particular to advise you about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam</SPEAKER>
<P>What! am I to undergo more persecution? I hoped he wou'd have suffered me to depart, with that Ease and Quietness of mind into which I had composed myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, my Dear—he seems quite changed, and reflected with great concern upon the injuries he had offered you; and I verily think you might even venture to stay, which with a very serious, grave Look, he ordered me to tell you, you might, if you thought fit, without the least apprehensions of his renewing his Attempts upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be true—and for his Sake, I hope it is; but staying, I am sure, would be a strong In∣ducement to the renewing his Attempts, since that would give him sufficient Reason to conclude, my re∣senting his Treatment was, (what I have heard it cal∣led) the little Artifice and Cunning of my Sex—and not a determined Resolution to preserve my Innocence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, thou art best able to distinguish, and I'll not pretend to give my Advice, where there's such Prudence and Understanding—but I think, however, 'twill be right to see him, since he has requested it in such a manner.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd he had not requested it, for notwith∣standing this Alteration of Behaviour, you describe, my Apprehensions of seeing him, bring back, to my Remembrance, all his pernicious Plots, and barbarous Usage of me—and yet, if I refuse it, he'll reproach

<P>If I can't prevail upon this little Baggage to stay, I shall have a rare ringing Lecture from my outrageous Sister; she'll conclude I have stormed the Fort, and not finding the Plunder answer my Expectation, have just carried off what I thought most valuable, and left the commanding Officer to dispose of what remains in the best Manner she can.—But 'tis a Question, faith, whether the Lady will think fit to do me the Honour of an Interview—and to confess the Truth, I have given her pretty substantial Reasons to be alarmed—O! here comes Mademoiselle <HI>la Governante.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be the highest Presumption, Sir, to consider myself in any other Character, and the Re∣membrance of it will always fill me with the most grateful, pleasing Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the bare Recollection can furnish such pleasing Ideas, I should conclude the Continuance of the Possession might be more desireable—and that—<HI>Pamela,</HI> wholly depends upon your own Choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persons in my humble State of Life, Sir, ought very seldom, if at all, to govern their Actions by their Choice; nay, sometimes even those of high Con∣dition, are apt to make very fatal Mistakes by a too blind Obedience to their Choice, in the Pursuit of what they call Pleasures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha; well said, my little Remembrancer—I assure you, canted forth with great Solemnity—Egad, I fancy the good old Lady my Mother, mistook both thy Sex and Genius, and instead of teaching thee to raise Paste, and make Cordials, thou shouldst have been instructed in administring spiritual Comforts—and a smart pretty <HI>Levite</HI> thou hadst been, S'death, you Baggage, what Havock you'd have made among the Maids?</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> informed me, Sir, you had some∣thing to say to me of a more serious Sort.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you little wicked Slut, can any thing be more serious than turning Parson; but I have some∣thing very serious to say to thee, 'tis upon Matrimony, and if that is not a serious Subject, I am at a Loss to furnish one. In short, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I have been thinking to make thee some Amends, for all the Rogues Tricks I have play'd thee, by getting thee a good Husband; I have a Chaplain in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> I have promised to provide for, one <HI>Williams,</HI> he's a likely young Fellow, if you'll stay, I'll send for him directly, the Parson has Taste, and I'm sure must be struck with all this Youth and Beauty. <STAGE>(kisses her)</STAGE>—S'death, I could almost marry thee myself.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Sir, I think the Subject in general of too solemn a kind, to be treated of, in the light man∣ner you are pleased to express yourself; and as to my particular Thoughts of it—I have never yet en∣tertain'd any, nor could I suppose you serious in what you say, have I a right to entertain such Thoughts, without first receiving the Approbation of those, who have an undoubted Power over my Mind and Person.</P>

<P>Sir, in an Act of such Importance, 'tis cer∣tainly my Duty first to make a personal Application, and 'twill be necessary I should myself have some longer Time to reflect upon an Act, on which the fu∣ture Happiness or Misery of my Life depends; there∣fore, Sir, I hope I have Leave to pursue my Resolu∣tion of returning home.</P>

<P>I humbly thank you, Sir; but let me intreat you not to think so hardly of the unhappy <HI>Pamela,</HI> low as she is, to interpret that ungrateful, which was the Effect of Duty, and a Desire to enjoy that Liberty which even Slaves are allow'd on such Occasions.</P>

<P>Upon my Word, my dear, this Resentment is most unreasonably founded—<HI>Pamela,</HI> who is returning to her Father, just before your Coach stop'd was come to pay her Compliment of Leave, and I was only just giving her a short Lesson of Instruction for her future Conduct, and—</P>

<SP>

<P>'Tis an Occasion, Madam, that to me affords a double Motive for Concern, the leaving a Family where I have rather been indulged like Child, than treated as a Servant, and the unhappy melancholy Cause that renders my leaving it unavoidable.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, fair One, if I'm deceiv'd—but in your looks, methinks, there seems a kind of doubtful Apprehension of some approaching Danger.—Emotions rather caused by Terror, than the soft Languishments describ'd from Lovesick Pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, too well you are acquainted, Sir, with the distress'd Condition of my Heart—indeed I am beset with Terrors, Terrors that wou'd bespeak a Breast endued but with the slightest Touches of Hu∣manity in my Behalf; a Grief more solid than the fantastick Lover's Pain creates, a Violation of the first, the tenderest Law great Nature from our Infan∣cy directs—I am divided, torn from my distres∣sed and most indulgent Parents, forc'd hither with an impious black Design to have my Innocence and Youth become the Sacrifice of brutal Violence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is an artless Fervour in your Grief, that might awake Compassion even in the cruel Au∣thors of your Woe—what then must be its power∣ful Influence on Minds that shrink with Horror at the hateful Deed? Minds enlarged by the engaging ge∣nerous Sentiments of soft Humanity, confirm'd and strongly rooted in those Sentiments, by the more binding Laws of Duty, and reverential Love for an all-good dispensing Providence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, that Providence, still watchful over injur'd Innocence, intends the Merit of its Rescue from your Hands; for I perceive there is an open ho∣nest tender Feeling in your Eyes at the unfolding of my Sorrows, which, when occasion suffers me more amply to relate, will cherish still, that Softness in your
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Soul, to undertake, if possible, my Flight from the approaching Misery that threatens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will require farther Time to deliberate on, than now we can afford; but be assured, I'm bound to you in every Wish that you can form for your Deliverance; but pray, is Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> concern'd as an Abettor in this detested Scheme?</P>

<P>On whom?—For what? Alas, Sir, turn your Revenge upon yourself, chastise your Heart, and call it to a strict Account, for having dar'd to entertain a Thought to your Dishonour; there your Revenge is due, and only there your Punishment is just.</P>

<P>The Innocent:</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be cautious, Sir,—nor let your Passion be the mad forerunner of Repentance; your Power I know can ruin me, but cannot strip my Mind of Honesty, which, while I wear, though in a loathsome Dungeon, sets me above that Wretch, who discontented stalks in Palaces, purused by Guilt, and its black Follower, re∣flection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can'st thou suppose this weak Pretence to ho∣nesty, this dull scholastick Pedantry, will save thee from my resentment? S'death; had I not seen thee break from thy Concealment, yet I had Proofs before, too strong to leave a Doubt, but that her mock inno∣cence deceiv'd me.—A Mistress—'faogh—'tis ful∣some, and a rank Satire on your Function.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Function, Sir, enjoins Protection to your Servant, and your Authority, which you have prosti∣tuted in undermining Innocence, had better, and with Justice, been employ'd in its Defence—As for me, I am griev'd at your Displeasure, but more at the un∣happy Cause.</P>

<P>Prithee no more; I am convinced those Vio∣lences of Temper, that so frequently break out, are more contracted by Habit and ill Example, than any natural Tendency in your Disposi ion; and be assured, my Dear, when you are thoroughly acquainted with <HI>Pamela</HI>'s great Worth and Merit, you will readily confess I have the fairest Prospect for a continual Se∣ries of social Happiness, the chief Blessing of the mar∣ried State.</P>

<L>HOLD, Critics, what's your Sentence e're you go?</L>
<L>Say, is our Bard pronounc'd an Ass or no?</L>
<L>Or do you wisely nod your Hods, and cry, So, so.</L>
<L>Well, entre nous, I think him strangely dull,</L>
<L>A senseless, stupid, antiquated Fool;</L>
<L>Was ever such another Blockhead seen?</L>
<L>To choose a Servant for his Heroine;</L>
<L>Gad, on our Sex, a general Satire's thrown,</L>
<L>Who love more cheap to part with—what's their own.</L>
<L>If this should pass, all Womankind must fear,</L>
<L>For none will purchase, if the Sale's so dear.</L>
<L>Unhappy <HI>Belvile,</HI> what a Wife, protect her,</L>

<L>Besides, a Girl, so over-fond of Grace,</L>
<L>Might be devout in an improper Place;</L>
<L>And pour forth Sermons from her fervent Mind,</L>
<L>When the poor Man's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uite otherwise inclin'd.</L>
<L>I promise you, I've try'd my utmost Art,</L>
<L>To wipe these musty Tenets from his Heart;</L>
<L>But he's resolv'd to give the World the Lye,</L>
<L>And like his <HI>Pammy,</HI> conquer Vice or die.</L>

<L>If then these well-meant Scenes have Pow'r t'impart</L>

<L>If humble Truth and Innocence can move</L>
