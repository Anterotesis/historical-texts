<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO William Hogarth.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mongst the sons of men how few are known</L>
<L>Who dare be just to merit not their own!</L>
<L>Superior virtue and superior sense</L>
<L>To knaves and fools will always give offence;</L>
<L>Nay, men of real worth can scarcely bear,</L>
<L>So nice is Jealousy, a rival there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BE wicked as thou wilt, do all that's base,</L>
<L>Proclaim thyself the monster of thy race;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Let Vice and Folly thy black Soul divide,</L>
<L>Be proud with meanness, and be mean with pride;</L>
<L>Deaf to the voice of Faith and Honour, fall</L>
<L>From side to side, yet be of none at all;</L>
<L>Spurn all those charities, those sacred ties,</L>
<L>Which Nature in her bounty, good as wise,</L>
<L>To work our safety, and ensure her plan,</L>
<L>Contriv'd to bind, and rivet man to man;</L>
<L>Lift against Virtue Pow'r's oppressive rod,</L>
<L>Betray thy Country, and deny thy God;</L>
<L>And, in one gen'ral comprehensive line,</L>
<L>To group, which volumes scarcely could define,</L>
<L>Whate'er of Sin and Dulness can be said,</L>
<L>Join to a F—'s heart a D—'s head,</L>
<L>Yet may'st thou pass unnotic'd in the throng,</L>
<L>And, free from Envy, safely sneak along.</L>
<L>The rigid Saint, by whom no mercy's shewn</L>
<L>To Saints whose lives are better than his own,</L>
<L>Shall spare thy crimes, and WIT, who never once</L>
<L>Forgave a Brother, shall forgive a Dunce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT should thy soul, form'd in some luckless hour;</L>
<L>Vile Int'rest scorn, nor madly grasp at Pow'r;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Should Love of Fame, in ev'ry noble mind</L>
<L>A brave disease, with love of Virtue join'd,</L>
<L>Spur thee to deeds of pith, where Courage tried</L>
<L>In Reason's court is amply justified;</L>
<L>Or, fond of knowledge and averse to strife,</L>
<L>Should'st Thou prefer the calmer walk of life;</L>
<L>Should'st Thou, by pale and sickly STUDY led,</L>
<L>Pursue coy Science to the Fountain head;</L>
<L>Virtue thy guide, and Public Good thy end,</L>
<L>Should ev'ry thought to our improvement tend,</L>
<L>To curb the passions, to enlarge the mind,</L>
<L>Purge the sick weal, and humanize mankind:</L>
<L>Rage in her eye, and Malice in her breast,</L>
<L>Redoubled Horror grinning on her crest,</L>
<L>Fiercer each snake, and sharper ev'ry dart,</L>
<L>Quick from her cell shall madd'ning ENVY start.</L>
<L>Then shalt Thou find, but find alas! too late,</L>
<L>How vain is worth! how short is Glory's date!</L>
<L>Then shalt Thou find, whilst Friends with Foes conspire</L>
<L>To give more proof than Virtue would desire,</L>
<L>Thy danger chiefly lies in acting well;</L>
<L>No crime's so great as daring to excell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>WHILST SATIRE thus, disdaining mean controul,</L>
<L>Urg'd the free dictates of an honest soul,</L>
<L>CANDOUR, who with the charity of <HI>Paul,</HI></L>
<L>Still thinks the best, whene'er she thinks at all,</L>
<L>With the sweet milk of human kindness bless'd,</L>
<L>The furious ardour of my zeal repress'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CANS'T Thou, with more than usual warmth, she cry'd,</L>
<L>Thy malice to indulge, and feed thy pride,</L>
<L>Can'st Thou, severe by Nature as Thou art,</L>
<L>With all that wond'rous rancour in thy heart,</L>
<L>Delight to torture Truth ten thousand ways,</L>
<L>To spin detraction forth from themes of praise,</L>
<L>To make VICE sit, for purposes of strife,</L>
<L>And draw the Hag much larger than the life,</L>
<L>To make the good seem bad, the bad seem worse,</L>
<L>And represent our Nature as our curse?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DOTH not humanity condemn that zeal</L>
<L>Which tends to aggravate and not to heal?</L>
<L>Doth not discretion warn thee of disgrace,</L>
<L>And danger grinning stare thee in the face?</L>
<L>Loud as the Drum, which spreading terrour round</L>
<L>From emptiness acquires the pow'r of sound,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Doth not the voice of NORTON strike thy ear,</L>
<L>And the pale MANSFIELD chill thy soul with fear?</L>
<L>Do'st Thou, fond man, believe thyself secure,</L>
<L>Because Thou'rt honest, and because Thou'rt poor?</L>
<L>Do'st Thou on Law and Liberty depend?</L>
<L>Turn, turn thy eyes, and view thy injur'd friend.</L>
<L>Art Thou beyond the ruffian gripe of Pow'r,</L>
<L>When WILKES, <HI>prejudg'd,</HI> is sentenc'd to the Tow'r?</L>
<L>Do'st Thou by Privilege exemption claim,</L>
<L>When Privilege is little more than name?</L>
<L>Or to Prerogative (that glorious ground</L>
<L>On which State-scoundrels oft have safety found)</L>
<L>Dost Thou pretend, and there a sanction find,</L>
<L>Unpunish'd, thus to Libel human kind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Poverty, the Poet's constant crime,</L>
<L>Compell'd thee, all unfit, to trade in rime,</L>
<L>Had not Romantic notions turn'd thy head,</L>
<L>Had'st Thou not valued Honour more than bread,</L>
<L>Had Int'rest, pliant Int'rest been thy guide,</L>
<L>And had not Prudence been debauch'd by Pride,</L>
<L>In flatt'ry's stream Thou would'st have dipp'd thy pen,</L>
<L>Applied to great, and not to honest men,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Nor should Conviction have seduc'd thy heart</L>
<L>To take the weaker, tho' the better part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT but rank Folly, for thy curse decreed,</L>
<L>Could into SATIRE's barren path mislead,</L>
<L>When, open to thy view, before thee lay</L>
<L>Soul-soothing PANEGYRIC's flow'ry way?</L>
<L>There might the Muse have saunter'd at her ease,</L>
<L>And, pleasing others, learn'd herself to please,</L>
<L><HI>Lords</HI> should have listen'd to the sugar'd treat,</L>
<L>And <HI>Ladies,</HI> simp'ring, own'd it vastly sweet;</L>
<L><HI>Rogues,</HI> in thy prudent verse with virtue grac'd,</L>
<L><HI>Fools,</HI> mark'd by thee as prodigies of Taste,</L>
<L>Must have forbid, pouring preferments down,</L>
<L>Such Wit, such Truth as thine to quit the gown.</L>
<L>Thy sacred Brethren too (for they, no less</L>
<L>Than Laymen, bring their off'rings to Success)</L>
<L>Had hail'd Thee good if great, and paid the vow</L>
<L>Sincere as that they pay to God, whilst Thou</L>
<L>In <HI>Lawn</HI> hadst whisper'd to a sleeping croud,</L>
<L>As dull as R—, and half as proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PEACE, CANDOUR—wisely had'st thou said, and well,</L>
<L>Could Int'rest in this breast one moment dwell,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Could she, with prospect of success, oppose</L>
<L>The firm resolves, which from Conviction rose.</L>
<L>I cannot truckle to a Fool of State,</L>
<L>Nor take a favour from the man I hate.</L>
<L>Free leave have others by such means to shine;</L>
<L>I scorn their practice, they may laugh at mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT in this charge, forgetful of thyself,</L>
<L>Thou hast assum'd the maxims of that Elf,</L>
<L>Whom God in wrath for man's dishonour fram'd,</L>
<L>CUNNING in Heav'n, amongst us PRUDENCE nam'd,</L>
<L>That <HI>servile</HI> PRUDENCE, which I leave to those</L>
<L>Who dare not be my Friends, can't be my Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAD I, with cruel and oppressive rimes,</L>
<L>Pursued, and turn'd misfortunes into crimes;</L>
<L>Had I, when Virtue gasping lay and low,</L>
<L>Join'd tyrant Vice, and added woe to woe;</L>
<L>Had I made Modesty in blushes speak,</L>
<L>And drawn the tear down Beauty's sacred cheek;</L>
<L>Had I (damn'd then) in thought debas'd my lays,</L>
<L>To wound that Sex, which Honour bids me praise;</L>
<L>Had I, from vengeance by base views betray'd,</L>
<L>In endless night sunk injur'd AYLIFF's shade;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Had I (which Satirists of mighty name,</L>
<L>Renown'd in rime, rever'd for <HI>moral</HI> fame,</L>
<L>Have done before, whom Justice shall pursue</L>
<L>In future verse) brought forth to public view</L>
<L>A Noble Friend, and made his foibles known,</L>
<L>Because his worth was greater than my own;</L>
<L>Had I spar'd those (so <HI>Prudence</HI> had decreed)</L>
<L>Whom, God so help me at my greatest need,</L>
<L>I ne'er will spare, those vipers to their King</L>
<L>Who smooth their looks, and flatter whilst they sting,</L>
<L>Or had I not taught patriot zeal to boast</L>
<L>Of Those, who flatter least, but love him most;</L>
<L>Had I thus sinn'd, my stubborn soul should bend</L>
<L>At CANDOUR's voice, and take, as from a friend,</L>
<L>The deep rebuke; Myself should be the first</L>
<L>To hate myself, and stamp my Muse accurs'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT shall my arm—forbid it manly Pride,</L>
<L>Forbid it Reason, warring on my side—</L>
<L>For vengeance lifted high, the stroke forbear,</L>
<L>And hang suspended in the desart air,</L>
<L>Or to my trembling side unnerv'd sink down,</L>
<L>Palsied, forsooth, by CANDOUR's half-made frown?</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>When Justice bids me on, shall I delay</L>
<L>Because insipid CANDOUR bars my way?</L>
<L>When she, of all alike the puling friend,</L>
<L>Would disappoint my Satire's noblest end,</L>
<L>When she to villains would a sanction give,</L>
<L>And shelter those who are not fit to live,</L>
<L>When she would screen the guilty from a blush,</L>
<L>And bids me spare whom Reason bids me crush,</L>
<L>All leagues with CANDOUR proudly I resign;</L>
<L>She cannot be for Honour's turn, nor mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET come, cold monitor, half foe, half friend,</L>
<L>Whom Vice can't fear, whom Virtue can't commend,</L>
<L>Come CANDOUR, by thy dull indiff'rence known,</L>
<L>Thou equal-blooded judge, Thou lukewarm drone,</L>
<L>Who, fashion'd without feelings, dost expect</L>
<L>We call that Virtue, which we know Defect,</L>
<L>Come, and observe the Nature of our crimes,</L>
<L>The gross and rank complexion of the times,</L>
<L>Observe it well, and then review my plan;</L>
<L>Praise if you will, or censure if you can.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILST Vice presumptuous lords it as in sport,</L>
<L>And Piety is only known at Court;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Whilst wretched LIBERTY expiring lies</L>
<L>Beneath the fatal burthen of EXCISE;</L>
<L>Whilst nobles act, without one touch of shame,</L>
<L>What men of humble rank would blush to name;</L>
<L>Whilst Honour's plac'd in highest point of view,</L>
<L>Worshipp'd by those, who Justice never knew;</L>
<L>Whilst Bubbles of Distinction waste in play</L>
<L>The hours of rest, and blunder thro' the day,</L>
<L>With dice and cards opprobrious vigils keep,</L>
<L>Then turn to ruin empires in their sleep;</L>
<L>Whilst Fathers, by relentless passion led,</L>
<L>Doom worthy injur'd sons to beg their bread,</L>
<L>Merely with ill-got, ill-sav'd wealth to grace</L>
<L>An alien, abject, poor, proud, upstart race;</L>
<L>Whilst MARTIN flatters only to betray,</L>
<L>And WEBB gives up his dirty soul for pay;</L>
<L>Whilst titles serve to hush a villain's fears;</L>
<L>Whilst Peers are Agents made, and Agents Peers;</L>
<L>Whilst base betrayers are themselves betray'd,</L>
<L>And makers ruin'd by the thing they made;</L>
<L>Whilst C—, false to God and man, for gold,</L>
<L>Like the old traitor who a Saviour sold,</L>
<L>To Shame his Master, Friend, and Father gives;</L>
<L>Whilst BUTE remains in pow'r, whilst HOLLAND lives;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>Can Satire want a subject, where Disdain</L>
<L>By Virtue fir'd may point her sharpest strain,</L>
<L>Where, cloath'd with thunder, Truth may roll along,</L>
<L>And CANDOUR justify the rage of song?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SUCH Things, such Men before Thee, such an Age,</L>
<L>Where Rancour, great as thine, may glut her rage,</L>
<L>And sicken e'en to surfeit, where the pride</L>
<L>Of Satire, pouring down in fullest tide,</L>
<L>May spread wide vengeance round, yet all the while</L>
<L>Justice behold the ruin with a smile,</L>
<L>Whilst I, thy foe misdeem'd, cannot condemn,</L>
<L>Nor disapprove that rage I wish to stem,</L>
<L>Wilt thou, degen'rate and corrupted, chuse</L>
<L>To soil the credit of thy haughty Muse.</L>
<L>With Fallacy, most infamous, to stain</L>
<L>Her Truth, and render all her anger vain?</L>
<L>When I beheld Thee incorrect but bold,</L>
<L>A various comment on the Stage unfold;</L>
<L>When Play'rs on Play'rs before thy satire fell,</L>
<L>And poor Reviews conspir'd thy wrath to swell;</L>
<L>When States and Statesmen next became thy care,</L>
<L>And only kings were safe if thou wast there;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>Thy ev'ry word I weigh'd in Judgment's scale,</L>
<L>And in thy ev'ry word found Truth prevail.</L>
<L>Why do'st Thou now to Falshood meanly fly?</L>
<L>Not even CANDOUR can forgive a lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BAD as Men are, why should thy frantic rimes</L>
<L>Traffick in Slander, and invent new crimes,</L>
<L>Crimes which, existing only in thy mind,</L>
<L>Weak Spleen brings forth to blacken all Mankind.</L>
<L>By pleasing hopes we lure the human heart</L>
<L>To practise Virtue, and improve in Art;</L>
<L>To thwart these ends (which proud of honest Fame</L>
<L>A noble Muse would cherish and inflame)</L>
<L>Thy <HI>Drudge</HI> contrives, and in our full career</L>
<L>Sicklies our hopes with the pale hue of Fear;</L>
<L>Tells us that all our labours are in vain,</L>
<L>That what we seek, we never can obtain,</L>
<L>That, dead to Virtue, lost to Nature's plan,</L>
<L>ENVY possesses the whole race of man,</L>
<L>That Worth is criminal, and Danger lies,</L>
<L>Danger extreme, in being good and wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS a rank falshood; search the world around,</L>
<L>There cannot be so vile a monster found</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>Not one so vile, on whom suspicions fall</L>
<L>Of that gross guilt, which you impute to all.</L>
<L>Approv'd by those who disobey her laws,</L>
<L>Virtue from Vice itself extorts applause.</L>
<L>Her very foes bear witness to her state;</L>
<L>They will not love her, but they cannot hate.</L>
<L>Hate Virtue for herself, with spite pursue</L>
<L>Merit for Merit's sake! might this be true,</L>
<L>I would renounce my Nature with disdain,</L>
<L>And with the beasts that perish graze the plain.</L>
<L>Might this be true, had we so far fill'd up</L>
<L>The measure of our crimes, and from the cup</L>
<L>Of guilt so deeply drank, as not to find,</L>
<L>Thirsting for sin, one drop, one dreg behind,</L>
<L>Quick ruin must involve this flaming ball,</L>
<L>And Providence in Justice crush us all.</L>
<L>None but the damn'd, and amongst them the worst,</L>
<L>Those who for double guilt are doubly curs'd,</L>
<L>Can be so lost; nor can the worst of all</L>
<L>At once into such deep damnation fall;</L>
<L>By painful slow degrees they reach this crime,</L>
<L>Which e'en in Hell must be a work of time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<L>Cease then thy guilty rage, thou wayward son,</L>
<L>With the foul gall of discontent o'er run,</L>
<L>List to my voice—be honest, if you can,</L>
<L>Nor slander Nature in her fav'rite man.</L>
<L>But if thy spirit, resolute in ill,</L>
<L>Once having err'd, persists in error still,</L>
<L>Go on at large, no longer worth my care,</L>
<L>And freely vent those blasphemies in air,</L>
<L>Which I would stamp as false, tho' on the tongue</L>
<L>Of Angels, the injurious slander hung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DUP'D by thy vanity (that cunning elf</L>
<L>Who snares the Coxcomb to deceive himself)</L>
<L>Or blinded by thy rage, did'st Thou believe</L>
<L>That We too, coolly, would ourselves deceive,</L>
<L>That We, as sterling, falshood would admit,</L>
<L>Because 'twas season'd with some little wit?</L>
<L>When Fiction rises pleasing to the eye,</L>
<L>Men will believe, because they love the lie;</L>
<L>But Truth herself, if clouded with a frown,</L>
<L>Must have some solemn proof to pass her down.</L>
<L>Hast Thou, maintaining that which must disgrace</L>
<L>And bring into contempt the human race,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>Hast Thou, or can'st Thou, in Truth's sacred court,</L>
<L>To save thy credit, and thy cause support,</L>
<L>Produce one proof, make out one real ground</L>
<L>On which so great, so gross a charge to found?</L>
<L>Nay, dost Thou know one man (let that appear,</L>
<L>From wilful falshood I'll proclaim thee clear)</L>
<L>One man so lost, to Nature so untrue,</L>
<L>From whom this gen'ral charge thy rashness drew?</L>
<L>On this foundation shalt thou stand or fall—</L>

<L>Accept thy proffer'd terms, and will be heard;</L>
<L>Thee have I heard with virulence declaim,</L>
<L>Nothing retain'd of Candour but the name;</L>
<L>By Thee have I been charg'd in angry strains</L>
<L>With that mean falshood which my soul disdains—</L>
<L>HOGARTH stand forth—Nay hang not thus aloof—</L>
<L>Now, CANDOUR, now Thou shall receive such proof,</L>
<L>Such damning proof, that henceforth Thou shalt fear</L>
<L>To tax my wrath, and own my conduct clear—</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>HOGARTH stand forth—I dare thee to be tried</L>
<L>In that great Court, where Conscience must preside;</L>
<L>At that most solemn bar hold up thy hand;</L>
<L>Think before whom on what account you stand—</L>
<L>Speak, but consider well—from first to last</L>
<L>Review thy life, weigh ev'ry action past—</L>
<L>Nay, you shall have no reason to complain—</L>
<L>Take longer time, and view them o'er again—</L>
<L>Canst Thou remember from thy earliest youth,</L>
<L>And as thy God must judge Thee, speak the truth,</L>
<L>A single instance where, <HI>Self</HI> laid aside,</L>
<L>And Justice taking place of fear and pride,</L>
<L>Thou with an equal eye did'st GENIUS view,</L>
<L>And give to Merit what was Merit's due?</L>
<L>Genius and Merit are a sure offence,</L>
<L>And thy Soul sickens at the name of Sense?</L>
<L>Is any one so foolish to succeed,</L>
<L>On ENVY's altar he is doom'd to bleed?</L>
<L>HOGARTH, a guilty pleasure in his eyes,</L>

<L>WHILST the weak Artist, to thy whims a slave,</L>

<L>Would suffer blank concealment to obscure</L>
<L>Those rays, thy Jealousy could not endure,</L>
<L>To feed thy vanity would rust unknown,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOULS of a tim'rous cast, of petty name</L>
<L>In ENVY's court, not yet quite dead to shame,</L>
<L>May some remorse, some qualms of Conscience feel,</L>
<L>And suffer Honour to abate their Zeal,</L>
<L>But the Man, truly and compleatly great,</L>
<L>Allows no rule of action but his hate;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>Thro' ev'ry bar he bravely breaks his way,</L>
<L>Passion his Principle, and Parts his prey.</L>
<L>Mediums in Vice and Virtue speak a mind</L>
<L>Within the pale of Temperance confin'd;</L>
<L>The daring Spirit scorns her narrow schemes,</L>
<L>And, good or bad, is always in extremes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MAN's practice duly weigh'd, thro' ev'ry age</L>
<L>On the same plan hath ENVY form'd her rage.</L>
<L>'Gainst those whom Fortune hath our rivals made</L>
<L>In way of Science, and in way of Trade,</L>
<L>Stung with mean Jealousy she arms her spite,</L>

<L>Our HOGARTH here a grand improver shines,</L>
<L>And nobly on the gen'ral plan refines;</L>
<L>He, like himself, o'erleaps the servile bound;</L>
<L>Worth is his mark, wherever Worth is found.</L>
<L>Should Painters only his vast wrath suffice?</L>

<L>Preys on herself, and, driven to the Stake,</L>
<L>Gives Virtue that revenge she scorns to take)</L>
<L>Had kill'd Thee, tott'ring on life's utmost verge,</L>
<L>Had WILKES and LIBERTY escap'd thy scourge.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN that GREAT CHARTER, which our Fathers bought</L>
<L>With their best blood, was into question brought;</L>
<L>When, big with ruin, o'er each English head</L>
<L>Vile Slav'ry hung suspended by a thread;</L>
<L>When LIBERTY, all trembling and aghast,</L>
<L>Fear'd for the future, knowing what was past;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>When ev'ry breast was chill'd with deep despair,</L>
<L>Till Reason pointed out that PRATT was there;</L>
<L>Lurking, most Ruffian-like, behind a screen,</L>
<L>So plac'd all things to see, himself unseen,</L>
<L>VIRTUE, with due contempt, saw HOGARTH stand,</L>
<L>The murd'rous pencil in his palsied hand.</L>
<L>What was the cause of Liberty to him,</L>
<L>Or what was Honour? let them sink or swim,</L>
<L>So he may gratify without controul</L>
<L>The mean resentments of his selfish soul.</L>
<L>Let Freedom perish, if, to Freedom true,</L>
<L>In the same ruin WILKES may perish too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH all the symptoms of assur'd decay,</L>
<L>With age and sickness pinch'd, and worn away,</L>
<L>Pale quiv'ring lips, lank cheeks, and falt'ring tongue,</L>
<L>The Spirits out of tune, the Nerves unstrung,</L>
<L>Thy Body shrivell'd up, thy dim eyes funk</L>
<L>Within their sockets deep, thy weak hams shrunk</L>
<L>The body's weight unable to sustain,</L>
<L>The stream of life scarce trembling thro' the vein,</L>
<L>More than half-kill'd by honest truths, which fell,</L>
<L>Thro' thy own fault, from men who wish'd thee well,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>Can'st thou, e'en thus, thy thoughts to vengeance give,</L>
<L>And, dead to all things else, to Malice live?</L>
<L>Hence, Dotard, to thy closet, shut thee in,</L>
<L>By deep repentance wash away thy sin,</L>
<L>From haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly;</L>
<L>And, on the verge of death, learn how to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VAIN exhortation! wash the Ethiop white,</L>
<L>Discharge the leopard's spots, turn day to night,</L>
<L>Controul the course of Nature, bid the deep</L>
<L>Hush at thy Pygmy voice her waves to sleep,</L>
<L>Perform things passing strange, yet own thy art</L>
<L>Too weak to work a change in such a heart.</L>
<L>That ENVY which was woven in the frame</L>
<L>At first, will to the last remain the same.</L>
<L>Reason may droop, may die, but Envy's rage</L>
<L>Improves by time, and gathers strength from age.</L>
<L>Some, and not few, vain triflers with the pen,</L>
<L>Unread, unpractis'd in the ways of men,</L>
<L>Tell us that ENVY, who with giant stride</L>
<L>Stalks thro' the vale of life by Virtue's side,</L>
<L>Retreats when she hath drawn her latest breath,</L>
<L>And calmly hears her praises after death.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>To such observers HOGARTH gives the lie;</L>
<L>Worth may be hears'd, but Envy cannot die;</L>
<L>Within the mansion of his gloomy breast,</L>
<L>A mansion suited well to such a guest;</L>
<L>Immortal, unimpair'd she rears her head,</L>
<L>And damns alike the living and the dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OFT have I known Thee, HOGARTH, weak and vain,</L>
<L>Thyself the idol of thy aukward strain,</L>
<L>Thro' the dull measure of a summer's day,</L>
<L>In phrase most vile, prate long long hours away,</L>
<L>Whilst Friends with Friends all gaping sit, and gaze,</L>
<L>To hear a HOGARTH babble HOGARTH's praise.</L>
<L>But if athwart thee Interruption came,</L>
<L>And mention'd with respect some Ancient's name,</L>
<L>Some Ancient's name, who in the days of yore</L>
<L>The crown of Art with greatest honour wore,</L>
<L>How have I seen thy coward cheek turn pale,</L>
<L>And blank confusion seize thy mangled tale?</L>
<L>How hath thy Jealousy to madness grown,</L>
<L>And deem'd his praise injurious to thy own?</L>
<L>Then without mercy did thy wrath make way,</L>
<L>And Arts and Artists all became thy prey;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>Then did'st Thou trample on establish'd rules,</L>
<L>And proudly levell'd all the antient schools,</L>
<L>Condemn'd those works, with praise thro' ages grac'd,</L>
<L>Which you had never seen, or could not taste.</L>
<L>"But would mankind have true Perfection shewn,</L>
<L>" It must be found in labours of my own.</L>
<L>" I dare to challenge in one single piece,</L>
<L>" Th' united force of ITALY and GREECE."</L>
<L>Thy eager hand the curtain then undrew,</L>
<L>And brought the boasted Master-piece to view.</L>
<L>Spare thy remarks—say not a single word—</L>
<L>The Picture seen, why is the Painter heard?</L>
<L>Call not up Shame and Anger in our cheeks;</L>
<L>Without a Comment SIGISMUNDA speaks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>POOR SIGISMUNDA! what a Fate is thine!</L>
<L>DRYDEN, the great High Priest of all the Nine,</L>
<L>Reviv'd thy name, gave what a Muse could give,</L>
<L>And in his Numbers bad thy Mem'ry live;</L>
<L>Gave thee those soft sensations, which might move</L>
<L>And warm the coldest Anchorite to Love;</L>
<L>Gave thee that Virtue, which could curb desire,</L>
<L>Refine and Consecrate Love's headstrong fire;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>Gave thee those griefs, which made the Stoic feel,</L>
<L>And call'd compassion forth from hearts of steel;</L>
<L>Gave thee that firmness, which our Sex may shame,</L>
<L>And made Man bow to Woman's juster claim,</L>
<L>So that our tears, which from Compassion flow,</L>
<L>Seem to debase thy dignity of woe.</L>
<L>But O, how much unlike! how fall'n! how chang'd!</L>
<L>How much from Nature, and herself estrang'd!</L>
<L>How totally depriv'd of all the pow'rs</L>
<L>To shew her feelings, and awaken our's,</L>
<L>Doth SIGISMUNDA now devoted stand,</L>
<L>The helpless victim of a Dauber's hand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why, <HI>my</HI> HOGARTH, such a progress made,</L>
<L>So rare a Pattern for the Sign-Post trade,</L>
<L>In the full force, and whirlwind of thy pride,</L>
<L>Why was <HI>Heroic</HI> Painting laid aside?</L>
<L>Why is It not resum'd? thy Friends at Court,</L>
<L>Men all in place and pow'r, crave thy support;</L>
<L>Be grateful then for once, and, thro' thy field</L>
<L>Of Politics, thy <HI>Epic</HI> Pencil wield,</L>
<L>Maintain the cause, which they, good lack! avow,</L>
<L>And would maintain too, but they know not how.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
<L>Thro' ev'ry <HI>Pannel</HI> let thy Virtue tell</L>
<L>How BUTE prevail'd, HOW PITT and TEMPLE fell!</L>
<L>How ENGLAND's sons (whom They conspir'd to bless</L>
<L>Against our Will, with insolent success)</L>
<L>Approve their fall, and with addresses run,</L>
<L>How got, God knows, to hail the SCOTTISH Sun;</L>
<L>Point out our fame in war, when vengeance, hurl'd</L>
<L>From the strong arm of Justice, shook the world;</L>
<L>Thine, and thy Country's honour to encrease</L>
<L>Point out the honours of succeeding Peace;</L>
<L>Our <HI>Moderation,</HI> Christian-like, display,</L>
<L>Shew, what we got, and what we gave away.</L>
<L>In Colours, dull and heavy as the tale,</L>
<L>Let a <HI>State</HI>-Chaos thro' the whole prevail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, of events regardless, whilst the Muse</L>
<L>Perhaps with too much heat her theme pursues;</L>
<L>While her quick Spirits rouze at FREEDOM's call,</L>
<L>And ev'ry drop of blood is turn'd to gall,</L>
<L>Whilst a dear Country, and an injur'd Friend,</L>
<L>Urge my strong anger to the bitt'rest end,</L>
<L>Whilst honest trophies to revenge are rais'd,</L>
<L>Let not One real Virtue pass unprais'd.</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>Justice with equal course bids Satire flow,</L>
<L>And loves the Virtue of her greatest foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! that I here could that rare Virtue mean</L>
<L>Which scorns the rule of Envy, Pride and Spleen,</L>
<L>Which springs not from the labour'd Works of Art,</L>
<L>But hath its rise from Nature in the heart,</L>
<L>Which in itself with happiness is crown'd,</L>
<L>And spreads with joy the blessing all around!</L>
<L>But Truth forbids, and in these simple lays,</L>
<L>Contented with a diff'rent kind of Praise,</L>
<L>Must HOGARTH stand; that Praise which GENIUS gives,</L>
<L>In Which to latest time the <HI>Artist</HI> lives,</L>
<L>But not the <HI>Man</HI>; which, rightly understood,</L>
<L>May make Us great, but cannot make us good.</L>
<L>That Praise be HOGARTH's; freely let him wear</L>
<L>That Wreath which GENIUS wove, and planted there.</L>
<L>Foe as I am, should Envy tear it down,</L>
<L>Myself would labour to replace the Crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN walks of Humor, in that cast of Style,</L>
<L>Which, probing to the quick, yet makes us smile;</L>
<L>In Comedy, thy nat'ral road to fame,</L>
<L>Nor let me call it by a meaner name,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="29"/>Where a beginning, middle, and an end</L>
<L>Are aptly joined; where parts on parts depend,</L>
<L>Each made for each, as bodies for their soul,</L>
<L>So as to form one true and perfect whole,</L>
<L>Where a plain story to the eye is told,</L>
<L>Which we conceive the moment we behold,</L>
<L>HOGARTH unrivall'd stands, and shall engage</L>
<L>Unrivall'd praise to the most distant age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How could'st Thou then to Shame perversely run,</L>
<L>And tread that path which Nature bad Thee shun,</L>
<L>Why did ambition overleap her rules,</L>
<L>And thy vast parts become the sport of Fools?</L>
<L>By diff'rent methods diff'rent Men excell,</L>
<L>But where is He, who can do all things well?</L>
<L>Humour thy Province, for some monstrous crime</L>
<L>Pride struck Thee with the frenzy of <HI>Sublime.</HI></L>
<L>But, when the work was finish'd, could thy mind</L>
<L>So partial be, and to herself so blind,</L>
<L>What with contempt All view'd, to view with awe,</L>
<L>Nor see those faults which ev'ry Blockhead saw?</L>
<L>Blush, Thou vain Man, and if desire of Fame,</L>
<L>Founded on real Art, thy thoughts inflame,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>To quick destruction SIGISMUNDA give,</L>
<L>And let her mem'ry die, that thine may live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT should fond Candour, for her Mercy sake,</L>
<L>With pity view, and pardon this mistake;</L>
<L>Or should Oblivion, to thy wish most kind,</L>
<L>Wipe off that stain, nor leave one trace behind;</L>
<L>Of ARTS <HI>despis'd,</HI> of ARTISTS by thy frown</L>
<L><HI>Aw'd from just hopes,</HI> of <HI>rising Worth kept down,</HI></L>
<L>Of all thy meanness thro' this mortal race,</L>
<L>Can'st Thou the living memory erase,</L>
<L>Or shall not Vengeance follow to the grave,</L>
<L>And give back just that measure which You gave?</L>
<L>With so much merit, and so much success,</L>
<L>With so much pow'r to curse, so much to bless,</L>
<L>Would He have been Man's friend, instead of foe,</L>
<L>HOGARTH had been a little God below.</L>
<L>Why then, like savage Giants, fam'd of old,</L>
<L>Of whom in Scripture Story we are told,</L>
<L>Dost Thou in cruelty that strength employ,</L>
<L>Which Nature meant to save, not to destroy,</L>
<L>Why dost Thou, all in horrid pomp array'd,</L>
<L>Sit grinning o'er the ruins Thou hast made?</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="31"/>Most rank Ill-nature must applaud thy art;</L>
<L>But even Candour must condemn thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR Me, who warm and zealous for my Friend,</L>
<L>In spite of railing thousands, will commend,</L>
<L>And, no less warm and zealous 'gainst my foes,</L>
<L>Spite of commending thousands, will oppose,</L>
<L>I dare thy worst, with scorn behold thy rage,</L>
<L>But with an eye of Pity view thy Age,</L>
<L>Thy feeble Age, in which, as in a glass,</L>
<L>We see how Men to dissolution pass.</L>
<L>Thou <HI>wretched Being,</HI> whom, on Reason's plan,</L>
<L>So chang'd, so lost, I cannot call a Man,</L>
<L>What could persuade Thee, at this time of life,</L>
<L>To launch afresh into the Sea of Strife?</L>
<L>Better for Thee, scarce crawling on the earth,</L>
<L>Almost as much a child as at thy birth,</L>
<L>To have resign'd in peace thy parting breath,</L>
<L>And sunk unnotic'd in the arms of Death.</L>
<L>Why would thy grey grey hairs resentment brave,</L>
<L>Thus to go down with sorrow to the grave?</L>
<L>Now, by my Soul, it makes me blush to know</L>
<L>My Spirits could descend to such a foe.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="32"/>Whatever cause the vengeance might provoke,</L>
<L>It seems rank Cowardice to give the stroke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SURE 'tis a curse which angry Fates impose,</L>
<L>To mortify man's arrogance, that Those</L>
<L>Who're fashion'd of some better sort of clay,</L>
<L>Much sooner than the common herd decay.</L>
<L>What bitter pangs must humbled GENIUS feel,</L>
<L>In their last hours, to view a SWIFT and STEELE?</L>
<L>How must ill-boding horrors fill her breast,</L>
<L>When She beholds Men, mark'd above the rest</L>
<L>For qualities most dear, plung'd from that height,</L>
<L>And sunk, deep sunk, in second Childhood's night?</L>
<L>Are Men, indeed, such things, and are the best</L>
<L>More subject to this evil, than the rest,</L>
<L>To drivel out whole years of Ideot breath,</L>
<L>And sit the Monuments of living Death?</L>
<L>O, galling circumstance to human pride!</L>
<L>Abasing Thought, but not to be denied!</L>
<L>With curious Art the Brain too finely wrought</L>
<L>Preys on herself, and is destroy'd by Thought.</L>
<L>Constant Attention wears the active mind,</L>
<L>Blots out her pow'rs, and leaves a blank behind.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="33"/>But let not Youth, to insolence allied,</L>
<L>In heat of blood, in full career of pride,</L>
<L>Possess'd of GENIUS, with unhallow'd rage</L>
<L>Mock the infirmities of rev'rend age.</L>
<L>The greatest GENIUS to this Fate may bow;</L>
<L>REYNOLDS, in time, may be like HOGARTH now.</L>
