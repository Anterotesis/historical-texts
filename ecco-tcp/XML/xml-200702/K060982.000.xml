<HEAD>AN
ESSAY,
At Removing National Prejudices, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAving wrote two Essays in <HI>England</HI> upon the Subject
of the Union, and particularly to remove National
and Party Prejudices against the Treaty then on foot. I
calculated those Essays principally for the <HI>English</HI> part,
where I always expected the difficulty would lye, and
where I met with certain radicated tho ill grounded Preju∣dices
against the <HI>Scots as a Nation,</HI> as well as against the
Union which I thought a general Happiness.</P>
<P>But I confess my self surpriz'd, when coming to <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
on some private Affairs of my own, I found my two
Essays Re-printed here, and forwardly handed about as
Arguments against that very Subject they were written to
Promote, I mean the Union; and that only upon this
weak Supposition, that because I had only insisted upon the
Advantages to <HI>England,</HI> in Union; that therefore I did
not pretend <HI>Scotland</HI> should any way be better'd by it.</P>
<P>To this my Answer is very short; that I had always too
great a respect for the <HI>Scots,</HI> to write a Satyr upon the Na∣tion:
And that thinking it impossible any <HI>Scotsman</HI> could be
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
to seek in the real, numerous, and so visible Advantages,
<HI>Scotland</HI> shall reap by the Treaty; I thought it would seem
to reflect too much upon the Gentlemen concern'd, to
presume to tell them, what it was much better manners
for me to presume they all knew already; and what by the
nature of the Thing became so visible, that to me it seem'd,
none but the willfully Blind, <HI>whom I do not pretend to Cure,</HI>
could be at a loss about.</P>
<P>But since it is my misfortune to be thus mistaken, and
that some People charge me with that Ignorance which
my respect for their Understanding, would not permitt me
to charge them with. I find my self oblig'd <HI>contrary to my
fixt resolution of not medling on either side,</HI> to make this
short Essay on the respective Advantages of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the
depending Treaty of Union; and this I shall do as concise∣ly
as I can, and carefully avoiding needless Digressions,
come immediately to the Matter in hand.</P>
<P>Only before I begin the attempt, give me leave in duty
to the Government, and in defference to her Majesty, to
note that the expressions of Advantages accruing to <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
by the Union, are so plain in her Majesty's Royal
Letter, and so asserted in the respective Speeches of his
Grace the Lord Commissioner, and the Lord Chancellor,
at the opening the present Session of Parliament, that one
would think no Man could read that Letter, and those
Speeches, and ask afterwards what the Advantages to
<HI>Scotland</HI> shall be by the Union.</P>
<P>When her Majesty tells her Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> She <Q REND="margQuotes">is
fully persuaded it will prove the greatest Happiness of her
People; that it will be the solid Foundation of lasting
Peace; it will secure your Religion, Liberty and Proper∣ty,
remove the Animosities amongst your selves, and
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
the Jealousies and Differences betwixt Our two King∣doms:
It must increase your Strength, Riches and
Trade; and by this Union the whole Island being joyn'd
in Affection, and free from all apprehension of different
Interests, will be enabled to resist all its Enemies, sup∣port
the Protestant Interest every where, and maintain
the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That to bring this Union to pass, is the only effectual
way to secure your present and future Happiness, and
disappoint the Designs of your and her Majesty's Ene∣mies.</Q></P>
<P>When his Grace her Majestie's high Commissioner has
inculcated these things and reminds you, <Q REND="margQuotes">That the
Queen esteems it as the greatest Glory of her Reign;
(not her glorious Successes abroad excepted) to have
this mighty Affair concluded.</Q></P>
<P>When my Lord Chancellor tells you, <Q REND="margQuotes">You have
now the opportunity of establishing for your selves and
Posterity, by this Union, all that concerns your Religi∣on
and Liberties, and the most valuable Privileges of
Trade.</Q></P>
<P>After all this has been said, is it not hard Gentlemen
you should ask a poor Stranger here, what <HI>Scotland</HI> shall
get by this Union; and why I did not go upon that in my
former Essays?</P>
<P>Really, Gentlemen, when I wrote those Essays, I con∣ceiv'd
them of use to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to convince some unbe∣lieving
<HI>Englishmen,</HI> that your great Advantages should be
no injury to them. It was a loud and continued Cry there,
<HI>Ay, ay, we know the</HI> Scots <HI>will gain by this Union;</HI> but what
SHALL WE, <HI>we in England,</HI> be the better for it: And I
was challeng'd often to make out, what the <HI>English</HI> should
Gain by it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Upon this I undertook that Subject, and really there
lies some unhappiness in the alternative of this Matter,
and an impartial Writer, <HI>as I hope I may pretend to be,</HI> has
a great difficulty before him in urging the Advantages of
either Nation; since the Arguments to prove the Advan∣tages
of one, seem to argue the Disadvantages of the other.</P>
<P>My remedy for this is, what I have undertaken in ano∣ther
place, <HI>viz.</HI> To convince both Parties, that their Ad∣vantages
are mutual, reciprocal and so equal, that 'tis
hard to determine which side shall be the greater Gainer.</P>
<P>And this happy conjunction of good Events, I must
confess, comes to pass from a thing many People have not
without plenty of Ignorance opposed; I mean, the Union's
being CENTERAL: And as to all the essential parts of
Constitution Universal; so that we are at liberty to give
that Word its full extent, UNION: And here I think it
can not be improper to explain how extensive I think <HI>the
word Union</HI> to be in this Case; and how <HI>even by the Treaty,</HI>
it ought to be understood. It is a word comprehensive of
every thing Good to both; exclusive of all manner of Pre∣ference
or Disparity of Parts, abhorring all things Injuri∣ous
or Diminishing to either; a full Coallition, a general
Incorporation of Nations, of Interests, of Power, and of
Safety:—A Sameness of Circumstances and of Sympa∣thies;
becoming one and the same Body, with one and the
same Head, Life, Soul, Nutriment, Point and Period.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen who talk much of this Union, and ha∣ving
known the Heads of it, yet pretend not to understand
it, would do very well to turn to their Books, and putting
together all the Etymologies, receiv'd Significations, cu∣stomary
Acceptations, and common readings of the words
<HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Incorporation,</HI> tell us what they understand by
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
them, and how the true meaning of the Words, and the
new suggestions of separate Existence in the Government
can Consist.</P>
<P>But if this be too nice, and the Thought too much sub∣limated
for them, let me recommend to them a course Si∣mily.</P>
<P>I
liken this Union to a Body receiving Food, as Flesh,
Fish, Fruit, Liquids, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which, being incorporated and
digested, concoct together, Unite their very Substance
and dissolve themselves into one and the same Nutriment,
to the health, life, vigour and growth of the whole Body,
proportionedly and universally.</P>
<P>If wrong Digestion, distemper of the Body, or defect of the
Food, produces corruption, contagion or improper fermen∣tation,
the most remote Member, and the nearest or more
immediate, equally feel their proportion'd want of Nou∣rishment,
decay of Strength, distemper and disorder; the
deficiency cannot be felt in the Head, and not in the
Foot, but weakness succeeds to all the Parts.</P>
<P>If our Union be Partial, Federal, Periodical or indeed
Notional, as most of those schemes have been; then the de∣fects
may be so also: One part may thrive, and another
decay; And <HI>Scotland</HI> would be but too sensible of that, in
those sorts of Union.</P>
<P>But if the Union be an Incorporation, a Union accor∣ding
to the extent of the Letter, it must then be a Union
of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its
Constitution, Customs, Trade and Manners, must be
blended together, digested and concocted, for the mutual
united, undistinguish't, good, growth and health of the one
whole united Body; and this I understand by Union
And no wonder, they who consider the Nations in a less
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
or more contracted Capacity of Union, are at a loss, to
find the Advantages of it.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, as thus United, would you know your
Advantages? They consist of four sorts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Trade,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Religion,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Civil Government,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Liberty and Soveraignty.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. In Trade, the united Riches, Stocks, Settlements,
Factories, and Dependencies of <HI>England,</HI> are concern'd
to promote yours; not as their Sister-<HI>Scotland,</HI> but as their
own Riches, Stocks in Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not in a separate but
an immediate Capacity, their Ports are yours, and you are
immediately Naturalized to, and Legitimated in their Cu∣stome-Houses,
Ports and Commerce; Your Manfuactures
are Carried to them, and what you want Imported from
them without Taxes, Tolls Distinction or Interruption.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Indies</HI> lyes at your Door, and you want Stock
to Grasp that Sea of wealth the Fishery, your Fish and
their Stocks will Unite to fall into that useful affair, by
which <HI>your People</HI> will be Employed, <HI>your Seamen</HI> kept at
home, <HI>your Provision</HI> consumed, <HI>your Lands</HI> Improved,
<HI>your Nation</HI> Enriched, they shareing with you in every one
of these, and you with them in every other Advantage.</P>
<P>'Twill be endless to Essay on the Freedom of your Linen
Manufacture into <HI>England,</HI> and it's prodigous Increass by the
taking off the Exorbitant Duty now laid upon it; the
Freedom of an Immediate Trade to all Our Colonies, de∣nied,
<HI>Even to the English Subjects Inhabiting Ireland,</HI> The
flush Stocks of <HI>English Men</HI> falling into Trade with you, and
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the Currency and Flux of <HI>English</HI> Bullion and Coin into all
parts of your Kingdom.</P>
<P>'Twould be worth your considering the advantages of
Introduceing <HI>English Improvements</HI> on your Estates, and per∣haps
<HI>English</HI> Farmers and Stocks on your Lands; the Ex∣portation
of your Corn and Coals to <HI>English</HI> Mercats, And
whether it will not be your own fault, if these things do
not in a few Years, double the Fee simple, and raise the
Value of your Estates <HI>Two for One.</HI></P>
<P>These are a few of the Advantages in Trade, which
would bear a higher enlargement, if it needed that I should
first prove, this would keep your People at home; and
then Examine the infinite Alterations and Consequences,
both to Land-Trade and ready Mony, which doubling
or trebbling the number of your People would produce.</P>
<P>'Tis a Slander upon your Country, to say, '<HI>tis a Barren
Land.</HI> Nature was commanded not to let Man have his
Bread out of her, but by the Sweat of his Brows; and
with that Sweat she never denys him.</P>
<P>'Tis want of Trade to whet Industry, Profit to whet
Trade, Vent of Goods and Stock to produce Profit;
These are the Barrennesses your Country Complains of, and
Declines for want of.</P>
<P>Your Lands Enclosed, Manured and Cultivated, would
be <HI>as Rich,</HI> your Cattel <HI>as Large,</HI> your Sheep <HI>as Fat,</HI> and
your Wool <HI>as Fine</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> your Barren Muirs would
yield Corn, the Hills Feed Flocks of Sheep, and your bet∣ter
Lands which you now wholly Imploy with the
Plough, would Feed Strong, and Valuable Cattel, from
hence would proceed <HI>Darys,</HI> Milk, Butter, Cheese, &amp;c.
which being plentiful, and Cheap would feed your Poor
in a better manner, and deliver them from the Misery and
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Hardship which now makes your People fly from their
Native Country, and makes you the Nurses of <HI>Europe,</HI>
that you have the trouble and expense of your Children till
they are grown up; and then other Nations reap the
Profit of their Labour.</P>
<P>But I can but touch these things here, perhaps I may
more largely Discourse of both the evil and its remedy on
another occasion: But to bring it to the present pur∣pose,
the immediate Remedy for them is an UNION,
and as it is the only Remedy, so it must be a Remedy, you
must partake of the general Improvement, both in Land,
Living and Trade; and I need say no more.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Powers must be your Defence, the whole
<HI>English</HI> Wealth must be Engaged to you; the <HI>English</HI>
Navys must be your Convo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and in all parts of the
World, your Ships have the Immediate Protection of their
Fleet, Ports, Forts▪ and Forces: And this by the natu∣ral
Consequences of the UNION, not as you are their
Friends, Neighbours and Confederates: But as you are
themselves, their own, it is become a Debt to you, their Sub∣jects
must Pay it, or be Traytors to their Soveraign, and
to their Native Country, which is yours and theirs Indefi∣nitely,
and Undistinguisht.</P>
<P>I know some Gentlemen will allow all this much rather than
be convinced of equal Advantages in another, yet more valu∣able
Case, viz. Religion which is the Second head of Discourse.</P>
<P>And here I must own, I am astonisht that any one can
help seeing the Safety, Settlement and Perpetuity of the
Establisht Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> entirely wrapt up in the UNI∣ON;
and indeed only to be secured by it.</P>
<P>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therto you have been jealous of <HI>England,</HI> putting upon
you Episcopacy, Tyrany, &amp;c. And I cannot say, 'tis
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
without cause, and in case of Ruptures, War, diferent So∣veraigns,
and a Thousand Casualties and uncertainties, to
which the Church as now Established is subject, both from
<HI>England</HI> without, as distinctly and disunitedly consider'd,
<HI>Which after the Queen no Body can answer for;</HI> and from a
numerous and doubly Disaffected Party at Home: Who, I
say, in case of those things, shall Answer, for what may or
may not befal the present Establisht Church▪ I dare say,
no Man, that has a true Zeal for it can say, he is easy in
the present condition of the Church, abstracted from this
Union.</P>
<P>Upon an Union, all these Fears vanish, 'Tis for ever
rendered impossible to Overthrow the Settlement of the
Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> But by Subverting the
constitution, by absolute Arbitrary Government, and the
openest Bare-Fac'd Tyranny. The Church, and the consti∣tution
the Spiritual and Temporal Liberty, have the
same Sanction, Subsist and Depend upon the same Securi∣ty,
are Defended by the same Power, Demanded by the
same Right, Twisted and Connected together, cannot
fall, but by the same Disaster, Nor stand, but by the
Support of one another.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Tyrannies may happen; and so they may, and
are much more likly to do under your present Unset∣tled
posture, as to Succession, than otherwise; And there∣fore
you will still be more Safe than you are now. And
with this addition, that then all <HI>Brittain</HI> will be concern'd
for your Liberty and you will demand it, as your un∣doubted
indisputable Right: Which Right the other can
never consent to Abrogate or make Null, without making
it lawful, by the same Majority, to lose their own, and so
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
should one day come to suffer, by the same experiment▪</P>
<P>And indeed, this is the only way, to reconcile that strange
absurdity, of which I have taken notice else where, now grow∣ing
up in both Nations, viz. <HI>The Danger of the Church,</HI>
that <HI>England</HI> should say, her Church will be in Danger;
and <HI>Scotland</HI> say, her Church will be in Danger: If both
these can be true, I confess, it has something very odd in
it. But, what is yet more absurd, is, that this should be
from a Union. Bless us! Union work this! How can
this be? 'Tis the nature of Union, to preserve, not di∣stroy;
to secure, not endanger; to confirm, not Under∣mine.
<HI>No, Gentlemen,</HI> if either of your Churches are in
Danger, it will be for want of the Union; So, and no
other way, the absurdity may be reconciled, and both
Churches be in Danger.</P>
<P><HI>In Union,</HI> Love, Peace, Charity and Mutual Assistance,
are natural consequences; And can those pull down any
Church? When-ever either party attempts upon the other,
the Union is Broke; 'Tis no more the thing, and can no
longer bear the Name. When the Union is Broke, the Con∣stitution
is Overthrown; For, one link of this Chain be∣ing
Broken, the whole Chain is rendred useless; the Force
of the one depending, upon the continuity of the rest. The
fundamental is distroy'd, the Government dissolves, and
the whole Island becomes a Mob, one Universal Rabble.
Just as in the case of a Tyrant, dispensing with the Laws
and Setting up Arbitrary Power, Property ceases, Au∣thority
Dissolves, Constitution suffocates, and the National
Capacity dyes.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Human Wisdom can make nothing Indissol∣vible.
This Union may be broke, so may <HI>Magna Carta;</HI> So
may the Constitution. But Gentlemen, you have the same
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Security for your Church Settlement, that you have for
your Lives, Liberties and Estates, and the same on one
side, that you have on another.</P>
<P>But says one, fill'd with jealousies of remote possibilities,
even The Legislature may be byast, and a Parliament may
come that shall Rescind the Settlement of the Church of
Scotland &amp;c.</P>
<P>Put this into English, <HI>A Parliament may come, that may
Dissolve the Constitution, that may Rescind the Union, that may
Sacrifice the whole Kingdom;</HI> it is absurd in it's nature, the
Union in it's being is the very Constitution, the Life and
Soul of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> as to Government: And to say, a Parlia∣ment
may come that can break the Constitution, is to say, a
Parliament may be mad, possest, and <HI>Felo de se;</HI> as a Parlia∣ment,
they can not do so, they cease from that moment to
be a Parliament, and become a House of Tyrants and a Den
of Robbers, nay, and of the worst sort of Robbers, Strip∣ping
those they come to Protect.</P>
<P>If they would do this therefore, they can not, without
Dissolving their own Being, Annihilating their own
Body, and committing all Imaginable Absurdities.</P>
<P>They may Dissolve themselves, but Original natural
Right must remain: if they dissolve the Form <HI>whether shall
it return?</HI>—To its primitive State it cannot, because
that is dissolv'd; to Confusion it must not, because Right
must be preserved: Whenever therefore a Parliament de∣stroys
the Constitution, by which a Nation is Form'd, that
Parliament ceases, and Power reverts to its original Source
to Form a new One.</P>
<P>Thus the Nature of the thing is its own Security, and
there needs no addition of other Force; if there does, the
Mouths of those Gentlemen must be stopt, in his Grace the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
high Commissioner's Speech, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">That his Grace is im∣powered
to Consent to what may be farther Neces∣sary.</Q></P>
<P>What can be made more Firm? Are there any liga∣ments
in the Law, qualified to bind the Church and the
Constitution together, so as that One cannot be hurt with∣out
the Other; <HI>they are offered you,</HI> take them and tie it as
fast as Laws or Oaths can bind, or the <HI>Sacra Imperii</HI> of any
Nation be made</P>
<P>After this what shall we say, is there any thing in the
Scruples of some in either of the Establisht Churches, which
goes beyond the real Security of the Church?</P>
<P>I wish those Gentlemen would examine, whether it be
any more than a Scruple? And whether all the Obligation
they think themselves under, is not limited by Possibilities?
Whether it can be understood they should be bound to do,
that which they cannot really wish, <HI>the Publick Good and pre∣sent
Circumstances considered,</HI> were in their power to do?</P>
<P>Let such Gentlemen consider how far their Sincerity as
well as Judgment will be called in question in this Case.</P>
<P>Whether really securing the Church, which they embrace
as truly and only Orthodox, be not the most effectual step
they can take to pull down all false Churches, and conse∣quently
a full Discharge of the sacred Obligation they think
themselves under.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, as things are, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is far
from Safe; and I should be excusable if I should say no∣thing
but Miracle or a Union, can make her so: He then
that effectually Establishes the true Church of Christ in the
World, effectually suppresses and pulls down all other
Churches in the language of his Capacity; as he assists to
place that Church in a posture of Victory over all her Ene∣mies,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
by a liberty of using all her spiritual Weapons, <HI>viz.</HI>
The superiour Doctrine and sanctity of her Ministry; and
I wish, there were no other Contention between the two
Churches.</P>
<P>If the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is now in a precarious, unsafe,
and unsettled Condition, and may be Secured by the Uni∣on,
then the Members of this Church, can no more ask
me what they Gain by the Union, nor answer it to their
Consciences, or their Posterity, that they should op∣pose
her Settlement in this the day of her Establish∣ment.</P>
<P>But,
say the Gentlemen, that in behalf of the Church ar∣gue
against the Union as now proposed; <HI>We in</HI> Scotland
<HI>are not safe by the Union,</HI> for we are deprived of our Parlia∣ment,
and <HI>delivered over</HI> to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and
<HI>we do not know,</HI> but such a Time may come, when the Par∣liament
of <HI>England whose Constitution is wholly Episcopal,</HI> may
Vote our Church down, and Erect the Episcopal Church of
<HI>England,</HI> as the Establishment of great <HI>Britain;</HI> putting us
off in <HI>Scotland</HI> with a Toleration, which also they may
by an occasional Bill, Reduce again to any thing they
please.</P>
<P>This I take to be the summ and state of the Question;
For really, what the other Party objects, in my opinion, car∣ries
with it no weight.</P>
<P>To argue what an <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Parliament may do,
and what they may not do, seems to me to be so conjectu∣ral,
that it leaves no room to call it an Argument. And
let Opinion go which way it will, or Probability byass
which way it will; this will follow, 'tis as possible, and I
must ask pardon for thinking, that 'tis more probable, a
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<HI>Scots</HI> Parliament may be obtain'd, to ruine Presbytery,
than an <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall turn the very same Arguments, which are
used against this Matter, upon the Gentlemen <HI>that use them,</HI>
thus;</P>
<P>The strong Reasons given, why an <HI>English</HI> Parliament
may do this, are such as these,</P>
<P>The great Interest of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and her in∣fluence
in the Parliament; Her having prevail'd to conti∣nue
the Test-Act impose it on the <HI>Irish</HI> Dissenters, and
attempt it on the Colonies; Her power to influence Electi∣ons,
in both Kingdoms; the nearness to carrying the oc∣casional
Bill; Her strong struggles for it the easiness to
Bribe or take off the 45 Members <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons why there is no danger from a <HI>Scots</HI> Par∣liament,
are such as these,</P>
<P>That the Act making it Treason to impugn any Article
of the Claim of Right, makes it dangerous to attempt it in
the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>That the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> are too sen∣sible
of the Calamities formerly brought upon the Nation,
have suffered too much by them to offer at Embroiling the
Nation again upon that account.</P>
<P>That the example of the Parliament chosen after King
<HI>William</HI>'s death is an Argument for this, in which an Au∣thor
says, there were more High-Church-men Elected than
in any Parliament since the Restoration—who were so
far from restoring Episcopacy, that they would not allow
the Episcopal Clergy the Toleration they Petitioned for.</P>
<P>This as the summ of the projected Disparity is what
is now offered upon this Head, which in short I abridge
thus '<HI>tis a Comparison of Probabilities.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
That 'tis probable from both Circumstances, and Ex∣amples,
that the <HI>English</HI> Parliament may Undo the Church
Settlement of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but 'tis not probable, the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Scotland</HI> can do it.</P>
<P>This I desire to speak briefly to; and if I should chance
to turn the scale of Probabilities against them, then I leave
it to it's Consequences; whether the World will not give it,
against these Gentlemen, who, with their Imperfect Union,
are for leaving us, just where they found us, or worse.</P>
<P>That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> is composed of Church
Men, is true; and that the Parsons, tho not near 10000
<HI>as is said,</HI> Vote, and the Church may Influence Elections ve∣ry
much is all true; and yet under all this, and under such
Reigns, as in which the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have been most
hated, they could never obtain any Effectual Law to sup∣press
them And at last the Poweer of Truth, and the Rea∣son
and Nature of things so prevailed, that the Dissenters
are not only Secur'd, but the whole Nation is come over to
them, in the Doctrines of Government, Right and Li∣berty.</P>
<P>The
Dissenters are not gone back an Inch, but the
Church asham'd of their Persecutions and Oppressions, <HI>which
like Excentrick motions always revolve of Course to regularities,
and more Natural Rules,</HI> return'd again by length of time to
her self, and own'd her Error, Declar'd Persecution against
her Principles; and freely fall in with Tolleration and Li∣berty.</P>
<P>They
see the Dissenters and the Church have but one
Civil Interest, and that Liberty is the Safety of both,
they're Convinc'd not Conquerd, reduc't not by Power or Par∣ty,
but by the nature of things, they come to their Senses a∣gain.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
After this, upon another Sally under a <HI>High-Church-Mini∣stry,</HI>
the Test was foisted upon the Dissenters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
some extravagancies Acted in <HI>England;</HI> but mark, how
soon did these Attempts in the Authors blow up the Mini∣stry,
and meer Nature bring all things to Rights again?</P>
<P>To instance, in the Attempt on the Colonies, which is the
story of <HI>Carolina,</HI> me thinks is very odd, since to read the
misfortune of my Lord <HI>Gr—lle</HI> on that Head, with what
contempt he has been treated, and how mortified for offe∣ring
such a thing, but on a poor handful of Planters, me
thinks, I say, it should strangely weaken the Arguments of
those, who seem to suggest these things.</P>
<P>These People seem to me a little Infatuated, and to Ar∣gue
against themselves, for, in order to Prove that such a cer∣tain
thing as attempting the Supression of Presbytry may
come to pass, they bring upon the Stage all the Instances
of these attempts, in which the People attempting, have
miscarried; and can tell but one in which they Succeeded,
viz. the putting the Test upon <HI>Ireland, which by the way,</HI>
had never past neither, had not the Dissenters in meer self de∣nial
for the Publick Good, rested under the hardship, rather
than venture to lose the Bill against the growth of Popery;
a thing these Gentlemen, I suppose, knew nothing of, and
a Generosity the other Party are but very little acquainted
with.</P>
<P>'Tis hard now Gentlemen, that because the High-flying-Church-Men
have always attempted the Dissenters in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and miscarried, to argue from thence that therefore
they shall insult the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement and succeed. I think
it had been a much stronger way of Arguing, to say, that
being unable with their united strength, ever to gain upon
the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> who, by their own Calculation,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
are not above one to twelve, they shall certainly be the
less able to prevail when in conjunction with the <HI>Scots</HI> In∣terest
and Members.</P>
<P>As to the occasional Bill and the nearness of its being
pass'd; 'tis plain it was a surprize, the snare was not seen at
first, but with what indignation the reserves and secret
designs against the Dissenters were treated when disco∣vered,
I leave to the Reader to find in the Journals of both
Houses.</P>
<P>From hence we come to the Probabilities on the other
hand, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no danger of the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament
being seduced; the same Author grants the new 45 and
16 may be bought by the <HI>English</HI> Court, but the whole
Parliament cannot be so;—and yet I believe most
People will join in this, that let the Court at any
time be sure to buy 45 and 16 in either Parliament they
shall generally speaking, carry any thing they desire; so
that this is absurd, and by no means a just way of Argu∣ing.</P>
<P>Another contradiction takes off very much of the Credit
of this kind of Arguing, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Act making it Trea∣son
to impugn any Article of the Claim of Right, makes
it dangerous to attempt this in the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but be surpriz'd to find any Man can say this
is not an Argument just the other way, that it is not as
lawful a Security to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the <HI>English</HI>
Parliament, or in the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> as in that of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Is not this Act to remain in Force after the Union, and
may it not be made a part of the Treaty, and can the Par∣liament
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
of <HI>Britain</HI> Vote what is declared by the Treaty to
be high Treason to attempt; 'tis certainly as great a
Security to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> as can be desir'd,
that 'tis declar'd high Treason to impugn her Settle∣ment.</P>
<P>Shall
it be objected, that the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> may
Repeal this; I answer, and so may the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
whenever they please, as it now stands, but if made a
Capitulation of the Treaty, according to my notion of the
Treaty, it can never be altered but by meer Tyranny, Per∣jury,
Violence and Usurpation.</P>
<P>This is the present Security of the Presbyterian Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> she is Establish't by Parliament, the Soveraign
is Sworn not to alter it, and 'tis high Treason in the Sub∣ject
to attempt it; and all this made a Stipulation previous
to the Treaty, which cannot be broken. If this be not
Security sufficient, I should be glad to see something bet∣ter
offered to the high Commissioner, that according
to his Grace's Speech, it may be past into such a Law,
as may make them fully easy.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, that the Gentlemen who argue on this
Head, will allow the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or the Court, or
both, may have an influence over the whole Parliament of
<HI>Britain;</HI> but cannot have an influence over the so much
smaller Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard it suggested by the Enemies of the Nation
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that they are Poor and Mercenary, and may
be all bought by the Court with 100000. <HI>l.</HI> If this slander
be true, 'tis first a sign that the present Government in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
does not Bribe them now. Secondly 'tis plain, that
they are not to be Brib'd into the Union, for that the Mo∣ney
has not produc'd the Effect yet, and the Court of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
or high-Church, have not on all occasions bought such
Bills as they have had occasion for.</P>
<P>On the other hand, these Gentlemen, put so little stress
on the 45 Votes in the House of Commons in <HI>Britain,</HI> that
they think they may be always out Voted, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
may have bad luck to have no Friends in the House of
Commons but their own 45.</P>
<P>Now, this is the very pretence on the other part of the
Question in <HI>England,</HI> where the Gentlemen put us in mind
how fatal 45 <HI>Scots</HI> Members may be to the Church, in con∣junction
with the Whigs there; and I am in some seeming
straight in pushing either part of the Argument, both sides
taking hold of it: If I say in <HI>England</HI> they are too few to
Hurt us, then say the <HI>Scots,</HI> they are to few to Secure us:
If I say in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are enough to Secure you, then say
they in <HI>England</HI> they are enough to Hurt us.</P>
<P>This is a very unhappy Case, and the Artifices of our
Writers on this Head seem very mean here; they are forc'd
to run counter against one another, and make such shifts,
turns and doubles, to bring things to bear, as I can not
but wonder at.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Court <HI>say they,</HI> may Bribe the 45 Members
and 16 Lords in the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> and they may
join with their Counties Enemies to betray <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But in the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament they pretend they are safe,
and the Church will be Secured by them, for <HI>they</HI> cannot
be Brib'd, Bought or Byasst.</P>
<P>Again, the Court may get all Episcopal Men to Represent
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Parliament of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But they can get none that will so much as agree to a
Toleration of Episcopacy, while they belong to the Parlia∣ment
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> so that to Day they may be Brib'd, to
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Morrow they can not; to Day they may be all Episcopal
Men, to Morrow they will be a Security against Episcopa∣cy.</P>
<P>Now,
take the high-Church-Men in <HI>England,</HI> and their
Absurdities are not fewer than these, to Day they tell us 45
<HI>Scots</HI> Men will bring Presbytery into <HI>England,</HI> and pull
down the Church; to Morrow the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI>
are not one to twelve, and we must force the <HI>Scots</HI> to re∣store
the Church. Thus, one way a thing is Great, and
another way Small; one way Secure, and another way in
Danger.</P>
<P>Now, let us place these People one against another in
each Kingdom. In <HI>England</HI> 45 <HI>Scots</HI> Commoners and
16 Lords, will certainly bring in Presbytery and pull down
the Church of <HI>England;</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> they will join to bring
in Episcopacy being brib'd and bought to pull down the
Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>To Day they are so many they will endanger the <HI>English</HI>
Church, to Morrow so few they can't defend their own.</P>
<P>To Day they will be so true to Presbytery, they will
never leave Caballing to pull down Episcopacy, to Mor∣row
so false they will sell their Country, join in voting
Episcopacy up in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and reduce the present Church
to a Toleration.</P>
<P>These things are very counfounding, and no Man can
be prepar'd to debate with Men that will thus go upon all
manner of Possibilities.</P>
<P>I confess, in my weak Observation, I think they come
all from the same Fountain, and are agitated by the same
Spirit: <HI>I mean</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> where a vigorous Party
struggles against the Union of the Kingdoms, as the only
mischief can befall their High-Church Cause, and effectual∣ly
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
deprive them of the opportunities of Embroiling both
Nations.</P>
<P>I wish this Kingdom a little better inform'd of the pra∣ctices
of those People, and entirely deliver'd from their In∣fluence.
I observe all or most part of the Pamphlets against
the Union, are form'd in <HI>England,</HI> and sent from thence, in
which the Authors suggest things falfe in Fact, presuming
upon the distance of the Place, and that they shall be taken
upon their words.</P>
<P>They represent the Union, as a thing which depends
wholly upon the Parliament in this Kingdom, and—the
<HI>English</HI> entirely acquiescing in the matter; nay some have
represented it as a thing the <HI>English</HI> are courting and wheed∣ling
this Kingdom to, in order to bring them under; and
that there is nothing to do, but to get the <HI>Scots</HI> to comply
with it.</P>
<P>In order to this, every <HI>Englishman</HI> here, whether by his
Curiosity, private Affairs, or by whatever other occasion
brought here, is rendred suspected as if sent from <HI>England</HI>
as an Emissary to officiate here, in preparing the <HI>Scots</HI> to
their purpose.</P>
<P>I do believe, that in <HI>England</HI> there is a general happy
disposition to this Union, especially in the wisest, best and
gteatest part of that Kingdom; and that this Temper is ex∣ceedingly
promoted and encreased by her Majestie's steady
adherence to it, as the only means to secure the Peace and
Happiness of both Nations, and as much as possible, cru∣shing,
checking and discouraging, the Party that are against
it: And I do acknowledge, to believe, that this happy
disposition is such at this time, that if the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> closes with it, and no unreasonable difficulties are
raised from hence, it will be compleated there.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
But I intreate the Gentlemen on this side, to bear with
me in telling them, this happy temper in <HI>England</HI> has not
been so easy a thing to procure. Abundance of visible
Providences have been remarkably Concurring, to bring
this Conjuncture to such a Crisis. Great havock has been
made, by their own follies, in the interest of a party, under
an administration, that would never have made the at∣tempt.</P>
<P>Victories,
of various sorts, have contributed to the
work, and a connexion of wonders have brought it to pass;
a conquest at home, superiour to <HI>Blenheim</HI> or <HI>Ramellies,</HI>
has been made over the dividing spirits of the high party.
Peace and Union has made large strides and rid over the
Bellies of her vanquisht Enemies, Envy, Malice, Jealousy
and party strife.</P>
<P>The Queen, nay the very Bishops too, have been called
a thousand Presbyterians, Deserters of the Church, and all
that is Scandalous. Every Moderate Church Man has
been a Confessor in this Cause, and gone thro' Scandal,
Reproach and all sorts of Opposition for Espousing it.</P>
<P>What Tacking, what Projecting, what Caballing have
the Party Attempted, as the Struggles of their Wicked
Cause; and with what Difficulty has this Juncture been
brought to pass.</P>
<P>Nor are the Party yet in Dispare, but with all Imaginable
Vigour and Artifice, they carry on their Dying Cause, and
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pute Inch by Inch every Step.—The last Game they
have to Play is the Union, if they can not Destroy that
they own the Union will Destroy them, and I am very sory
to see the Subtilty of their Proceeding extends hither.</P>
<P>They leave no Stone untur'nd, they Play Whiggs against
Whiggs, and Church against Church, Presbyterians a∣gainst
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Presbyterians; They amuse with Jealousies on one
hand, raise Scruples on the other; in <HI>England,</HI> they
Rail, Gibe and Banter, in <HI>Scotland</HI> they Plead those very
things for arguments, which they own their aversion to.</P>
<P>Now, I would humbly recommend to these Gentlemen, here
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who really are for secureing their Church; how
comes Church of <HI>England</HI> Men, High Church hot Episco∣parian
Disputants to talk of your security? Does the Fox
Preach, <HI>Garde les Poules,</HI> have a care of the Geese?</P>
<P>Why is it they talk so much of the security of the Church,
and fill your Heads with fear of the Church, whence must
this fear come? it must come from the <HI>English:</HI> Pray
Gentlemen, how comes it to pass, that in <HI>England</HI> all your
Friends are against you, and all your Enemies are for you;
By <HI>You,</HI> I mean, <HI>You</HI> Objectors.</P>
<P>All the High Church Men, all the Enemies of your Im∣provement,
the Enemies of your Trade, and the Enemies
of your Church, are Enemies of the Union, they throng
you with their Pamphlets, and Cant of Securities. Those very
Men who wish your Church and perhaps Nation too, at
the <HI>D—l</HI> are turn'd about, and talk of the Security of the
Church, the very <HI>Jure Divino</HI> Men talk of Liberty, the
very Instruments of former Tyrannys in <HI>England,</HI> talk of
Preserving your Laws, Parliaments and Judicatorys.</P>
<P>This is really so Mysterious, that I think it's worth your
Observation, and no doubt, but you will find good reason
from it, to quicken your Application to the Union.</P>
<P>I shall close this Essay with two thinges for I cannot
have room to enter upon the Civil Advantages.</P>
<P>His Grace the hihg Commissioner has Acquainted you, that
he is Impowred to pass Laws for the further Securing this
Matter in order as I suppose, to make you Easy, and remove the
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Scruples and Fears of those really concerned for the Church.</P>
<P>Now, in laying hold of her Majesties offer by His Grace
the High Commissioner here, and the like in <HI>England,</HI> there
seems to me, to be one ready Step to make both sides
easie, and to remove the Jealousies on either hand, as to
the Danger of the Church, whether Presbyterian or Epis∣copal;
and the Matter is very short, viz. That an Act of
Parliament be past in the respective Kingdoms, Contain∣ing
a Claim of Church Rights, a Declaration of the
State of either Church, its Constitution and Government,
with a formal Capitulation, or Clause of Establishment,
for either Church, and proper Provisions, Articles and Li∣mitations
between them, Declareing their Powers and Ex∣tent.
Which Acts being first Past in either Kingdom, be
afterwards Incorporated into, and made part of the Treaty
as an Essential Condition of the said Union, and this no
Doubt will be Granted.</P>
<P>To say, this may be Cass'd Annull'd, or afterwards
made Void, seems Invidious, and is to my Apprehension
Talking nothing at all, for no Subsequent Parliament can
make Null any Article of the Treaty,—it would be no
Treaty, if this could be. The Treaty is the Foundation
and Constituent Head of the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> and
gives it a Being, and therefore is so far Superiour in it's
Power, as not to be Destroyed by its own Substitute, and
as I have said elsewhere, to breake the Treaty, is to Dis∣solve
the Constitution and very Being of the Parliament,
and Overthrow the Union; and to think <HI>England</HI> will Con∣tribute
to Breaking the Treaty, is too hard a Suggestion,
and what I care not to enter upon the Discription of here.</P>
<P>How Preposterous is it to Judge, that a Parliament should
hereafter Annull and Abolish, in Prejudice of a whole King∣dom,
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
what, before the very Being of that Parliament was
Declar'd to be their Right, and Assented to, Granted and
Capitulated for, on both sides.</P>
<P>'Tis true, 'tis possible to be done, 'tis possible that after
this <HI>England</HI> may Raise an Army, and come and Destroy
<HI>Scotland;</HI> but it must be Contrary to Faith, Justice, Ho∣nour,
Right, Law and Liberty, and this must in its Na∣ture
Dissolve the Constitution, and return the whole Island
to its Divided State.</P>
<P>But still says an Objector, we can not help our selves, to
take up Arms will be Treason and Rebellion &amp;c. And
we shall be Treated as Perjur'd Rebells.</P>
<P>I Answer, it will be Treason and Rebellion in the Letter
of the Thing, but not in the Meaning of the Law; so the
taking up Arms to Joyn the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was Treason.
And had King <HI>James</HI> Defeated that Prince, and Frustrated
the Revolution, the Gentlemen at <HI>Notingham</HI> would soon
have found themselves Treated as Rebells, and the Conse∣quences
would have been Bloody enough.</P>
<P>But here would be no other Ground for it, than was there;
and should ever such an Infraction of the Treaty happen,
I make no Scruple to say, the whole Constitution would be
dissolved, Authority dye, and things would as before Revolve
either to their Divided State, or into all kinds of Confusions.</P>
<P>'Tis unkind, I confess, to offer such things, of a Body
of Gentlemen, Chosen out of the whole Island, and 't would
be endless, to give them Answers; 'tis Impossible there can
be Men enough found in a Parliament, to close with so
open a Breach of the very Constitution, upon which they
themselves stood. Nor is <HI>Scotland</HI> so Inconsiderable a Na∣tion,
that <HI>England</HI> should offer so foully to Break with them,
and with so little Reason; Since, in the Case Proposed,
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
there can be no pretence to use you so hardly, but what
must be meerly Tyrannical and an Original Violence: In
which, they could expect no Aid, from Heaven or Honest
Men. 'Tis a Prospect so Horrid, that I cannot look into
it without concern. No Party-Heats can run to such a
length; Not the Parliament in King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2ds time,
<HI>tho' Loaded with Pensions and Places,</HI> could be brought to
Part with any Branch of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, neither
can they here, for it will be all one whole Settlement, and
a Dissolution on one side, Dissolves the other of Course.</P>
<P>I think <HI>Scotland</HI> can have no Security like this Treaty, it
is back't with the Constitution, 'tis Fortified with Capi∣tulated
Reason, and when ever the Flood of Parties attacks
it, 'twill Run-Back and Drown its Contrivers.</P>
<P>If any Man talks of proposing more than can be had, it
gives good ground to suggest he shall be best pleased with
the denial.</P>
<P>I would censure no body in their proposing higher De∣mands
than are reasonable, and such as in their nature
must embarrass the Treaty, alarm <HI>England,</HI> and destroy
the hopes of an Union; but this I must say, 'tis just what
they are for, who wish the Treaty broke off: And 'tis
strange Friends and Enemies should both hit on the same
thing, and both propose <HI>for such vastly different reasons,</HI> the
same Conditions; tis to me a too visible discovery of the
Weakness on one hand, and the Policy on the other, and
that's all I shall say to it.</P>
<P>I hope the Gentlemen concern'd here, will be too wary
to offer any thing too hard for an <HI>English</HI> Parliament to
grant; and this is the thing with which I shall end this
Discourse. To impose something on the <HI>English,</HI> which
'tis known will not pass, or which Circumstances consider'd
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
can not; this would be to come to the Union, but not with
the Spirit of Union.</P>
<P>I frankly own, I see no disposition in the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation
to do so, and hope I shall not be construed to suggest it in
this Case; I have too much respect for the <HI>Scots</HI> Na∣tion
to imagine such a thing:—But I must own I
believe, that very thing is the top of the Party-Politicks
now on foot in <HI>England</HI> against the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and a∣gainst
the Union in general; to bring <HI>Scotland</HI> if possible, to
insist upon something which they know <HI>England</HI> cannot
grant; and for this reason we have all their Books against
the Union crowded with Queries about Guarantees, Secu∣rities,
separate Parliaments, partial and imperfect Unions,
and the like.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my self convinc'd, that the Union is the
general Safety of <HI>Britain,</HI> that it is the particular advan∣tage
of either Nation; and if I was to be askt, whether
Nation have greater advantages from it, I profess my self
nncapable of giving a direct answer; on this Head it is
that I Discourse, I am persuaded mutual Security, mutual
Improvement and mutual Prosperity, attends it on both
sides.</P>
<P>But there must be also mutual Confidences and mutual
Affections, or 'tis impossible to Unite; Jealousies, Feuds
and Suspicions, will rob the Nations of the fruit even
of the Union it self. There cannot be a flux of profitable
Trade, an easy, free and uninterrupted conjunction in
Circumstances and Families, a Coallition of Stocks, Under∣takings
and Improvements, is National prejudices are not
remov'd.</P>
<P>If a new Seal be made, or a new Armorial Ensign for
<HI>Britain</HI> directed, I wish the Motto might be, WE ARE
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
BRETHREN, and the Text will add the rest, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 8.
<HI>Let there be no strife between us.</HI></P>
<P>Let firm Articles, compleat Establishments, and full Calu∣ses
form the Union, and the faster the better; but let us
not Treat with embarrassing Suspicions, politick Jealousies,
and uncharitable cenforious Apprehensions of one another,
especially where the very Nature of things helps to make
them safe; and where both Nations seem to mean nothing
but what is sincere.</P>
<P>I confess when I consider this, I wonder to see <HI>some
Libels</HI> and Pamphlets appear here, in which they grant a
nearer Union of the Kingdoms necessary for their mutual
Service, and yet endeavour all along to foment Jealousies
between the Nations; particularly that <HI>England</HI> shall op∣press
<HI>Scotland</HI> after the League is Concluded, and that She
will not Perform the Conditions.</P>
<P>Nay, one Gentleman forgets himself so far, as to tell
you very positively, if you agree for an Equivalent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State of the Contro∣versy. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 22.</NOTE>The <HI>English</HI> will not Pay you the Money, and
the reason he gives for it is this.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">'Tis Incident to the Nature of Man, not to
perform Bargains, or Pay their Debts, unless
they are Compell'd to it, and if not Private Men, far less
Societys.</Q></P>
<P>In <HI>English,</HI> this is saying all Men are Born Knaves and
Cheats, and <HI>when in Societys</HI> they grow worse than they
were before, and that the <HI>English</HI> are Rogues and not to be
Trusted with the Money.</P>
<P>This is very Unkind Gentlemen, and very Severe Lan∣guage;
and were not the Government in <HI>England</HI> much
more Moderate, than your Humble Servant once found
them, I wonder that Gentleman is not yet Taught better
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Manners, if this Book be as Publick there, as 'tis here.</P>
<P>But the Principle on which these Gentlemen go, is not to
be Wondred at, since they so plainly discover their aim to
be, that you should Trust any Body rather than <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And least what I mean should be hard to guess at, the same
Gentleman explains it for me, when having first told you
<HI>England</HI> is not to be trusted, nor can give you any Security;
he proceeds to tell you, who can: <HI>P.</HI> 27 speaking of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
not making the <HI>Scots</HI> suitable returns, and their seeking
some where else, he adds,</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">This they can easily do, either by publick Treaties
or private Bargains with their Neighbours.—</Q></P>
<P>HOW SIR! private Bargains with Neighbours!
How can this be?—<Q REND="margQuotes">It is incident to the Nature of
Man, that neither private Men, far less Societies, will
perform their Bargains.</Q> <BIBL>State of the Contro. p. 22.</BIBL></P>
<P>Is not this a partiallity intolerable, and can I be censur'd
for saying, the plain meaning of this is, the <HI>English</HI> are
Knaves, and will keep no Bargain with you; but the <HI>French</HI>
are honest Fellows, and you may make a Bargain with
them.</P>
<P>To carry on this rudeness farther upon <HI>England,</HI> he ex∣plains
himself—<Q REND="margQuotes">if any Man does believe that 513
Men who have no power to answer to, will compel
themselves to pay a great Sum of Money—he has
more Faith than Experience or Judgment.</Q></P>
<P>This is not only Scurrilous and Indecent, but so contrary
to Truth and Experience, that I could fill this tract with
precedents, in the very Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which are
the People he reproaches, how they have retriv'd and sup∣ported
the publick Faith, and establisht the Credit of Par∣liaments,
in paying great Sums of Money which they were
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
under no Parliamentary obligation to Pay, and which they went
no farther for, than to examine the justice of the
Demand in general, not their own particular Engagement;
and let any Man examine the Payment and Debentures to
the Army in <HI>Ireland;</HI> to the transport Service; the de∣ficiencies
of Tallies on former Funds; and above all, the
payment of 600000 <HI>l.</HI> to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for so much advanc'd
on the Expedition of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which no Parli∣ament
was ever engaged for.</P>
<P>These are the Men that by this Book are born Knaves,
will keep no Bargains, pay no Debts, and consequently are
not fit to be trusted.</P>
<P>I leave all honest Men to judge, whether there is not
reason to persuade Men to come with a spirit of Union and
Confidence to a Treaty of this Nature, and whether these
sort of Writers do not while they pretend to object against
the particulars of the Union, really drive at having no
Union at all.</P>
<P>I shall descend but to one more Head of this learned Au∣thor's
Discourse, <HI>having not room for it here,</HI> and that is a
most wonderful new invented System of Politicks set down
in his 7th p. the last paragraph, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">By the Constitution of Parliaments, the Laws are to
have their rise from the Will and Humour of the People,
signifyed by the Lords and Commons.—</Q></P>
<P>This is a suggestion deserves some Mirth were not the
Subject too Serious; and I should be glad to see that Gentle∣man
or some body for him, shew me by what part of the
Constitution he will prove such a suggestion.</P>
<P>Then he says, this humour of the People is signifyed by
the Lords and Commons, by which he gives the Lords and
Commons a great deal of Honour, that their business
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
is only to signify the Will and Humour of the People</P>
<P>I hope their Lordships know their parliamentary Dignity
and the Commons their Office, better than this Gentle∣man,
and so I take no notice of that, but I hint it upon
this score, <HI>for 'tis in it self too ridiculous to deserve any
note:</HI> That the humours of the People, tho not the rise of
Laws, ought not to be raised by any Indiscretions against
the Laws, and that to possess their Minds with greater
Dangers and greater Apprehensions than are justly before
them, cannot consist with the care of their Quiet, any
more than with the Publick good.</P>
<P>The third and fourth Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> Civil Government
and Soveraignty remain, which I cannot enter upon here,
this Tract having run further on than I expected, if it
may be to the publick Service to Treat further on
the Subject, they may be Spoken to by themselves,
when the Objections of these popular Authors against
the possibility and security of a civil Coallition may meet
with some Reply; and perhaps there may not appear such
weight in them, as some People imagine.</P>
<P>These things I humbly recomend to the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation to
Consider of, I acknowledge, as a Stranger it may be Ob∣jected,
why I Engage in this Matter; but as I have al∣ways
Profest a more than Common Regard to this Nati∣on,
and am not come Hither without some thought of Set∣tling
amongst them, on the foot of Trade and Improve∣ment;
Especially if the Union follow this Treaty: So I
have presum'd with all the Calmness and Respect I can, to
recommend Impartially, not the Imaginary, but the real
Advantages and Securities of this Union, and I should be
very sory, if any Person should mistake me.</P>
<P>Nor am I affraid of being suspected here, the Treatment
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
I have met with from Parties and Power in my Native
Country, I think will Secure me from the Scandal
of being an Emissary; to a Party I have no Interest to Pur∣sue,
no Gain to make, no Party to Serve; I seek no Advan∣tages
from the Union, other than in Common with my Na∣tive
Country. I Contemn the Suggestion, as I Scorn the
Employment of an Emissary, a Spy, or a Mercenary; my
Bussiness is known here: Which tending to Trade, Settle∣ment
and general Improvement, I never purposed to
Meddle in this Affair, and I hope I have done it so as can
give no offence to any.</P>
<P>And as I take this occasion, to speak of my own design
of settling in this Kingdom, I desire to speak one word to
the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> I know, it is Suggested, that
this Union shall Prejudice this City, as it shall Prevent the
Concourse of your Nobility and Gentry, and consequently
the Trade of the City.</P>
<P>I have observed, that, in all the Books, Railling Pam∣phlets
and Voluminous Arguments against the Union, not
one has ever yet Spoke a Word, about your Trade; but all
allow, you shall be prodigious Gainers there.</P>
<P>Shall you then lose something of the Concourse of your
Gentry here? Tho I do not grant that neither, Be not con∣cern'd;
you will Gain it Ten fold, in the concourse of
Strangers. Not this Authors Family only, but Hundreds
of Familys in <HI>England</HI> have their Eyes this way, to Engage
in your Commerce, Embark their Stocks in your Trade,
Manufactures and Fishing, Encrease your Shipping, and
Improve your Lands.</P>
<P>It is Impossible, but your City must Encrease the Commo∣diousness
of your Harbour for Shipping, Qualify this City
only to be the Metropolis of this Kingdom in Trade, as well
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
as the Capital for Resort; and who ever lives 20 Years
here, will see you Encrease in Wealth and People, and in
Spight of an Unhappy Situation, Encrease in Buildings too—Trade
will, and must bring Inhabitants, and <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
and <HI>Leith</HI> will certainly be one City in a few Years.</P>
<P>Trades Men must be sensible of this, and 'tis plain to the
Meanest Capacity, a Fleet of Ships in your Road, and con∣stant
Import and Export, will bring another sort of Con∣course
to the City than Ten Parliaments; and 'tis too plain
to need Examination.</P>
<P>You will then fall to Importing Naval Stores, Building
of Ships, Exporting your own Growth, and Importing
Forreign Goods; And how many Familys will immedi∣ately
follow such Employments!</P>
<P>The Citizens and Common People of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> have
therefore the greatest Cause in the World to wish for this
Union, as the only way to Redeem them from the Poverty
and Misery, the present want of Trade has Reduc't them to.</P>
