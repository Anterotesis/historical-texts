<HEAD>TO THE GREAT ORIGINAL Of the Following PICTURE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT I decline the Honour of attending, with at least one <HI>honest Address,</HI> is from some Hazard there might be, of your mistaking the true Motive of it. Free from all Ambition to make One, among the Worshippers of your <HI>Fortune,</HI> I present you, and at Distance too, a bare Confession of your <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>TO know the Writer of this Piece, can be of no Importance to your Lordship. He lies too low to merit a great Minister's In∣quiry. It will please the Public better, that he knows YOU, rightly: and, that he does so, he appeals to the Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
HE is too well acquainted with the mo∣dern Turn of Sentiment, in some, (who, for a few Years, must be <HI>called)</HI> Great Men, to look for any present Consequence, from <HI>Poetry;</HI> where even the Best finds more Contempt than due <HI>Discernment.</HI> But, at the same time he knows, that this is One, among the Faults of bad Administration, which a Soul like Yours came qualified to think <HI>worth mending:</HI> And we might have had more Certainty, that you would do it, had you been as pleased with your own Pro∣fit, as the Public's; since the clearest Inte∣rest is <HI>His,</HI> in every Honour done the <HI>Muses,</HI> who is born for Actions, of a Pitch <HI>above the Spirit</HI> of cold Writers.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing more to trouble you with, except the warm and just good Wishes of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Your</HI> LORDSHIP<HI>'s</HI> quondam <HI>Schoolfellow, And One of your sincerest Humble Servants,</HI> IGNOTUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>RE these the Marks, then, of our promis'd <HI>Shame!</HI></L>
<L>Or did Detraction steal the Patriot's Name?</L>
<L>Weak, if we were, how rose we, now, so strong?</L>
<L>Or whence, if pow'rful, were we scorn'd, so long?</L>
<L>Burn, sooty Slander, burn, thy blotted Scroll:</L>
<L>Greatness is Greatness, spite of Faction's <HI>Soul.</HI></L>

<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>I GAZE, astonish'd Kingdom, o'er thy Face,</L>
<L>And each weigh'd Wonder to its Fountain trace.</L>
<L>Glory flows in, where Infamy was spread:</L>
<L>And long-lost Triumph lifts her tow'ry Head.</L>
<L>Warm, o'er the icy <HI>North,</HI> thy influent Awe</L>
<L>Bids hostile Leagues <HI>dissolve,</HI> in friendly Thaw.</L>
<L>Up <HI>Rhine's</HI> long Stream <HI>Britannic</HI> Thunders winde,</L>
<L>And <HI>Alpine</HI> Mountains shake—and States, behind.</L>
<L><HI>Austria's</HI> plum'd Eagle, beak'd and wing'd once more,</L>
<L>Sees baffled <HI>Bourbon</HI> driv'n, from Shore to Shore.</L>
<L>Sea-shook <HI>Ausonia,</HI> red with warring Hosts,</L>
<L>Starts, from her <HI>Adrian,</HI> to her <HI>Tyrrhene,</HI> Coasts.</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Rome's</HI> imperious <HI>Mitre</HI> learns to <HI>bow!</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Spain's</HI> THALESTRIS is, but, <HI>Woman,</HI> now!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHENCE this amazing Change?—'twas, late, all, <HI>Fear:</HI></L>
<L>No warring God, invok'd, inclin'd his Ear.</L>
<L>Tyrants, combin'd, found Freedom's Rights betray'd:</L>
<L>Faith, fast-expiring, saw the False invade,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Commerce cajol'd, Reluctance brib'd, Rage tame:</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Empire trod on—</HI>yet, untouch'd by Shame!</L>
<L>Then, was the <HI>Crisis;</HI> then, Fate's Hand appear'd:</L>
<L>Then might the World be deaf—for, <HI>Britain</HI> heard.</L>
<L>Wave-worship'd <HI>Britain!</HI> One, to All, oppos'd!</L>
<L>By Friends deserted, and by Foes inclos'd,</L>
<L>Fills the World's Eye; dispels the <HI>Doubter's</HI> Care;</L>
<L>Bids the Bold tremble, and the Backward dare:</L>
<L>High, to the Nations, points their <HI>Guardian's</HI> Throne,</L>
<L>And acts, and arbitrates, and shines, <HI>alone.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND have such Fires inflam'd a patient Reign?</L>
<L>Immortal Heav'n! and must we, still, <HI>complain?</HI></L>
<L>Still, must we rail, and blacken, and suspect?</L>
<L>At once, curb Vigilance, and <HI>goad</HI> Neglect?</L>
<L>Deep let my Soul detest th' <HI>adhesive</HI> Pride,</L>
<L>That, changing Sentiment, unchanges Side:</L>
<L>True, to Contempt of Truth, repents within—</L>
<L>Yet, screens Conviction; and <HI>strains hard,</HI> to sin.</L>

<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>SHAME on this Craft, to <HI>scare!—</HI>this Toil, to <HI>seem!</HI></L>
<L>O Heart, indignant, fly th'unmanly Scheme:</L>
<L>Blush, for thy past Injustice; shrink no more;</L>
<L>But wake—and wonder, thou wert dark, before!</L>
<L>Learn, from <HI>whose Hand</HI> th'unlook'd-for Effluence came:</L>
<L>And, in the Teeth of Insult, <HI>sound his Name.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT, tho' some Friend thou lov'st had narrower Sight?</L>
<L>Truth knows no <HI>Parties;</HI> and involves, like <HI>Light.</HI></L>
<L>Shadows and Names fright Cowards—but the Strong</L>
<L>Ne'er call That <HI>Lightness,</HI> which is <HI>Scorn</HI> of <HI>Wrong.</HI></L>
<L>Dare to be <HI>just:</HI> 'tis all that Brav'ry means▪</L>
<L>He stoops too basely, who to <HI>Flatt'ry</HI> leans:</L>
<L>But, whome pale <HI>Prejudice</HI> has taught his Part,</L>
<L>Born, for a Slave, wears Fetters, on his <HI>Heart;</HI></L>
<L>Sees, undiscerning; feels, without his Touch;</L>
<L>Judges, too little—and decides too much.</L>

<L>POETS have nobler Souls: Fame's Paths, they <HI>show:</HI></L>
<L>They glow themselves—and teach the <HI>World,</HI> to glow.</L>
<L><HI>Satire</HI>'s whole Pow'r their own—yet, <HI>Praise,</HI> they <HI>chuse:</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n of unconscious Kings, who <HI>slight</HI> the Muse.</L>
<L>Proud of neglected Force, each Heav'n-touch'd Mind,</L>
<L>Open, to Reason, is, to Int'rest, blind:</L>
<L>Self all un-thought of, can, for others, think:</L>
<L>Swim, till the State <HI>rides safe—</HI>then, smile, and <HI>sink;</HI></L>
<L>Lift, ev'n the Worth that hates him; love it <HI>shown;</HI></L>
<L>And, for his Country's Joys, <HI>exclude</HI> his own,</L>
<L><HI>This</HI> is to think, like <HI>Muses;</HI> act, like MAN:</L>
<L>This, <HI>Princes</HI> OUGHT to feel—and <HI>Poets</HI> CAN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE, once misguided! is Retraction <HI>vain?</HI></L>
<L>Trust the Brave injur'd: nor persist, to stain.</L>
<L>Why should <HI>Suspicion</HI> Penitence outlive?</L>
<L>None doubt Forgiveness, but who ne'er forgive.</L>
<L>HEAV'N has been <HI>wrong'd:</HI> yet, still, goes on to <HI>bless.</HI></L>
<L>For, Sins of Blindness err, <HI>beneath</HI> Distress.</L>
<L>So wrong'd, so pard'ning, <HI>Cart'ret</HI> heeds no Foe;</L>
<L>But <HI>saves—</HI>unangry at, the <HI>Rage below.</HI></L>
