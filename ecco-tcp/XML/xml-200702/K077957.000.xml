<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Madam, believe me; you know I am a Man of Integrity: I cannot dissemble. Let him write what he pleases, If he did not love you, do you think I'd tell you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he has Opportunity, I must confess, he says kind things to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take my Word, Madam, my Master is not like other Men—Unless he loves a Lady, and loves her passionately too, he never troubles himself to com∣pliment her much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never? Yes, <HI>Jeffry;</HI> sometimes, you know, he compliments my Aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a convincing Proof of his Love to you; you cannot think him reduc'd to the Necessity of making Love to an antiquated Piece, with design to know her otherwise, than to obtain the Happiness of seeing you? But I shall tell him, Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him I have receiv'd and read his Letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>All! Yes. Are you not content with that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any indifferent Person, that had Hands, and could but read, would have done, as much, as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; Tell him then, in time perhaps I may—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Master, Madam, can't endure to depend on a perhaps.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quick, quick, up to your Chamber, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the Matter? Is my Aunt coming hi∣ther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's at your Heels. Go up the Back-Stairs quickly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Farewel, <HI>Jeffry;</HI> Commend me to thy Ma∣ster. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Phil.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what, I beseech you? Is not my Master bewitc'd, to court a Lady a whole Year, and she hard∣ly tell him she loves him yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! She's but a Novice. Let me alone with her; I'll order the Business so, that if thy Master be discreet and passionate enough in his Expressions, he wins her Heart I'll warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can say nothing to her, but that damn'd Aunt of hers is harkning to't still. What Pleasure can she find in Love at Fifty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, <HI>Jeffry,</HI> you must say Five and twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder any Woman can have the Impu∣dence to live, and trouble Mankind after that Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>There never was a Woman so old, but she re∣tain'd a good Opinion of her self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she dresses her self so fantastically, that all may see she strives to appear Young in defiance of Nature. She is more gawdy in that she calls Half-Mourning, than a young Bride is on her Wedding-Night. The Devil's in her if she believes any one can love her: 'Tis jeering her, but to be commonly ci∣vil to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little Flattery fires her. She believes all, that is said to her: And he that does not make love to her, and compliment her, shall not be twice admit∣ted to her House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>O reverend Beauty! on my Conscience, if I would grease her Chops with a few Compliments, she'd mump and smile upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>When shall my Master have an Opportunity to speak freely to <HI>Philadelphia?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> is thy Master's Friend, and is better belov'd here, than he imagines You must per∣suade him to amuse the Aunt, that Mr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> may have Convenience to court the Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI>'s tir'd with playing that part so often; he is cloy'd with the Aunt, and swears he'll have no more of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure her Niece and I endure much more. Tell him, 'twill be Charity in him to relieve us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twill be hard to persuade him to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>This old Lady of mine has languish'd for a young Husband ever since Sir <HI>Oliver Laycock</HI> dy'd: She cares not what Estate he has, or what Religion he's of, so he be but young and lusty. Where is the great Viscount <HI>Sans Terre,</HI> thy Master told her of? Methinks he's long a coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some cross unlucky Business hinders him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has lately receiv'd some Letters, that have given a full Account of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse. What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say his Fortune is not very much, but he is greatly born, and very pleasant; and that he is so great a Lover of Musick, he has not a Servant but can Sing or Dance, or Play upon some Instrument. You may know when he's come by the Noise; the Fiddlers will welcome him to Town; for all from <HI>Westminster</HI> to <HI>Wapping</HI> pay him Homage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd he were but marry'd to her, <HI>Pru∣dence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether he marries her or not, is not our Business, <HI>Jeffry.</HI> Let him but fool with us till thy Master has gain'd her Niece, and then our Work is done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we have had enough of thy old Lady <HI>Laycock.</HI> Let us now talk of our own Affairs; speak, dost thou love me, <HI>Prudence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pleasant Question! Do you doubt it now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would have me credit you, swear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure you are jealous <HI>Jeffry?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're somewhat near the Matter. I know your Humour well enough; you love a bold audaci∣ous Fellow, that will say any thing, and such a one we have come to Town, one <HI>Merryman</HI> our Falconer; I fear you'll like him better than you do me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Fool! why should you think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have some Honour in me; but he's a Fellow that has eaten Shame, and drank after it. He is more impudent than a Court Page, and will take no De∣nial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your Tongue, here's my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Lady <HI>Laycock.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Business has <HI>Jeffry</HI> with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Master sent him to know, whether he might have leave to wait upon your Ladyship this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Tell him, I expect him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>He durst not come, because Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI>'s with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go tell 'em, if they please to come, they shall be welcome both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall, Madam. <STAGE><HI>(Exit</HI> Jeffrey.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see what Power your Beauty has. Nei∣ther can live a Moment without seeing you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they have other Business with me, <HI>Pru∣dence;</HI> they came from <HI>Paris</HI> lately, and brought me a Letter from my Brother; and I believe they come for my Answer now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not one of 'em love you, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have some Reason to believe he does; Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> has spar'd no Pains to persuade me to quit my Widow-hood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been told, Madam, that Widow-hood is a Gift, Heaven seldom bestows but on its Favou∣rites; you are rich, and know how troublesome Mar∣riage is. For my part, I believe the fairest Hair, the beautiful'st Curls do not become your Fore-head so well as <HI>Bando</HI> did; but every one, Madam, knows their own Necessities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, Widow-hood has its Conveniencies; but if Marriage be a Trouble to some, 'tis a Pleasure to others, <HI>Prudence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had the Experience of it thirty Years, how did you like it, Madam? They say, Sir <HI>Oliver Laycock</HI> lov'd your Ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all that he was jealous; and, what's worse, was Old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; therefore you resolve to have a young One now, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot blame me for that? Can you, <HI>Prudence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, 'tis well known Youth is comforta∣ble. But, methinks, you should take one a little near∣er your own Age, Madam. A very young Man may be too treacherous for you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is my Age so visible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; with a little Help of Art you have some Remains of Beauty still. You have some∣thing about your Eyes as pleasant now, as others have at Twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a very malicious World we live in, <HI>Pru∣dence;</HI> they are so apt to censure, and speak of any single Woman, that one ought to marry to avoid that Scandal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some that are young are forc'd to marry, to avoid Detraction; others wou'd rather all that's Ill should be said of them, than to have no Notice ta∣ken of 'em. I knew a young Lady that pin'd to a Consumption, because she liv'd three Years about the Court, and never had the Honour to be lampoon'd. The Truth is, none that are Beautiful and Young can avoid Envy, but few are so malicious, to speak against the Old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Age exempt from Scandal, <HI>Pru∣dence.</HI> When we are Young, they say we sell our selves; when Old, we are forc'd to hire, to buy our Lovers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know what they say, Madam, of the old Marchioness, your Friend, that was so admir'd, so courted in her Youth; who, when she found she was forsook by all, was forc'd to hire a Player by the Quarter: How soon rhe poor Fellow was tir'd too! How like a Sheep-biter he look'd after the first two Months!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>This <HI>London</HI> is a very wicked Place, 'tis im∣possible to live without Scandal here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid they'll say as much of you, Madam, if you bargain for a Husband. To covet one, that is both Young and Rich, is too much in Conscience, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'st, <HI>Prudence,</HI> Wealth is not the thing I seek.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, the Business is done; the Viscount <HI>Sans-Terre</HI> shall be your Husband, Ma∣dam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah <HI>Prudence!</HI> if he were but as handsome as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah Madam, that's too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why may not I wish for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider his Quality, Madam, and 'bate him something for that. One thing I must advise you; be not too prodigal of your Gold at first; to be li∣beral sometimes will be convenient, and make him kinder to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all this, I should think my self very happy, if I were certain of Mr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lovemore.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little Jealousy will inflame 'em. They'll be more pressing when the Viscount comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But yet methinks, <HI>Cuningham</HI> and my Neice—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are always whispering.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>He only compliments her, Madam. She's too young to make Love seriously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your Favour, there's no trusting to that. To my Knowledge, there are those younger, than she, that understand what Love is but too well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Madam; but <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is so innocent, that no Man can make Love to her, but to divert himself. Here she is, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Philadelphia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does she come for? I'll send her pack∣ing quickly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider what you do, Madam. How can Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> entertain your Ladyship, unless his Friend may divert himself the while with rallying with your Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all that I could wish—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray trouble not your self. Trust me, I'll watch her, Madam.</P>

<P>Will your Ladyship go to <HI>Eaton</HI>'s? The Coach is at the Door.</P>

<P>Good Lord! Why what must I call you then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You ought to say, Madam and Sir, when you speak to us; or when you speak of us, you should say, Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> and her Ladyship: For tho' you have married our Daughter, yet there is a great deal of distinction betwixt you and Persons of our Rank and Quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Peter.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Go to, it is enough for me to let him know his Duty, without your Instructions. Sure, I best know my self what to do. Son-in-law, you are an impudent Fellow to use us at this rate. How of∣ten must we put you in mind of your Duty and Re∣spect, e'er you'll know it? Hence-forward learn to behave your self as you ought, or you shall hear on't in other sort of Terms. You must not think because you've married our Daughter, that we will be satis∣fied with such indifferent Ceremonies and Duty you might have paid, had you married one equal with your self; nor ought you indeed to say, your Wife, when you speak of our Daughter.</P>

<P>I tell you, tho' she be your Wife, you must not call her so. When you speak of her, as be∣ing our Daughter, you must say, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Britt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, then since it must be Madam, I did not care if she were a Dutchess, so I were but fairly rid of her.</P>
<P>Here's such a stir about your Gentility, and your Ho∣nour: But I believe if I had not married your Daugh∣ter, and with my good Money redeem'd your Estate, your Gentility had been left in the Mud—for all your great Families, and your nice Honour.</P>

<P>Well, Madam, then: I always forget these fine Words. But, Madam, if you wou'd please, Ma∣dam, to hear me speak, you shall know, Madam, whether I have not Cause to wish, I never had seen my Wi—your Daughter, Madam, if I must call her nothing else.</P>

<P>Oh, dear Sir! Pray, why so?</P>

<SPEAKER>Widow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, why should you think so?</P>
<P>I'll vow 'tis an odd Thought, Sir, for one of your Un∣derstanding: Why, Sir, I'll tell you.</P>
<P>I have had Three Husbands, and yet I have no great Reason to complain: Tho' in my last Husband's time, I had not altogether that real Satisfaction, as I had with the other Two; for to deal freely with you, Sir, my Husband Sir <HI>Oliver Laycock,</HI> though he was a very well-bred Man, yet he had his Humours some∣times, and would be a little given to Jealousy, so that I seldom led a quiet Hour when the Fit was upon him. But in my first Husband's Days, sure never Woman liv'd so happy! I would not a-been unmarried to have had all the Riches of the Earth laid at my Feet: But when I married with Sir <HI>Oliver,</HI> and had once seen his Temper, nothing I had in the World but what I would a given to a been free a∣gain; and indeed in my Passion I often vow'd never (if please Heav'n Sir <HI>Oliver</HI> died) to marry any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cun.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas rashly done.</P>
<P>But no doubt, were there that Man fitting to merit your Favour, and equally deserving your Person and your Estate, and one whom your Ladyship could like, you might perhaps be persuaded to break your Vow, and venture once again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll swear I hardly think it, and yet one don't know how one may be tempted; tho' if I were to be persuaded, (and I will not forswear any thing) I know not any one, that can so soon persuade me to it as you, Mr. <HI>Cuningham.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Cun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft has he begg'd me to bear him Company in some lonely Place, where he wou'd sigh, and tell such things of his distressed Passion, as wou'd have mov'd the most obdurate Heart; and when I ask'd him, why he did not acquaint your Ladyship with his Love, he would sigh, with Arms a-cross, as if his Heart would force its way through his Breast, and cry, Oh that's my Grief, my Friend, I cannot—dare not tell her! for should I attempt it once, and meet her scorn, (for oh! thou know'st her Vow) I shou'd be for ever lost.</P>

<P>Why, you must know, Madam, my Master had the Misfortune to quarrel with a Gentleman, who urg'd him to fight; my Master kill'd him: Upon which he was forc'd to change his Habit and his Name—From <HI>Cuningham</HI> to <HI>Boutefeu.</HI> But think∣ing it not safe to stay here, fled; and in his Journey happen'd into a Viscount's Castle, but the Viscount was gone a Journey.

<P>Methinks she was very forward, <HI>Jeffrey.</HI></P>

<P>Oh, the impudent Creature! And thy Master was to blame, not to keep his Word, <HI>Jeffrey.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Madam, when you have heard all. You must know, my Master grew jealous of one of the Servants, as indeed he had Reason: And one Day pretended to ride out, and he shou'd not return that Night, but left me to let him in, when the Ser∣vants were all a-bed, which I did. Going up to this Lady's Bed-Chamber, and not being expected that Night, found the Servant in Bed with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unheard of Impudence!</P>
<P>At first I was going to condemn thy Master, for de∣ceiving a young Creature; but 'tis likely he was not the first, that had to do with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely so, Madam. Next Day my Ma∣ster was for packing up his Awls, and for going; she cry'd, and urg'd his stay, and his Vows to marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Widow.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had been more to blame to have done that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time the Viscount return'd, found his Sister in Tears, wou'd know the Reason, was told all.
