<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG></HI> Hope the Reader will forgive the Liberty I have taken in Translating these Verses somewhat at large, without which it would have been almost im∣possible to have given any kind of Turn in <HI>English</HI> Poetry to so dry a Subject. The Sense of the Author is, I hope, no where mistaken; and if there seems in some Places to be some Additions in the <HI>English</HI> Verses to the <HI>Greek</HI> Text, they are only such as may be justify'd from <HI>Hierocles</HI>'s Commentary, and deliver'd by him as the larger and explain'd Sense of the Author's short Precept. I have in some few
<PB REF="3"/>
Places ventur'd to differ from the Learned Mr. <HI>Dacier</HI>'s French Inter∣pretation, as those that shall give themselves the trouble of a strict Comparison will find. How far I am in the right, is left to the Reader to determine.</P>

<L>The greatest this, and first of Laws, obey:</L>
<L>Perform thy Vows, observe thy plighte Troth,</L>
<L>And let Religion bind thee to thy Oath.</L>
<L>The Heroes next demand thy just regard,</L>
<L>Renown'd on Earth, and the Stars preferr'd,</L>
<L>To Light and endless Life, their Virtues sure Reward.</L>
<L>Due Rights perform and Honours to the Dead,</L>
<L>To ev'ry Wise, to ev'ry Pious Shade.</L>
<L>With lowly Duty to thy Parents bow,</L>
<L>And Grace and Favour to thy Kindred show:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
For what concerns the rest of Humane kind.</L>
<L>Choose out the Man to Virtue best inclin'd,</L>
<L>Him to thy Arms receive, him to thy Bosom bind.</L>
<L>Possest of such a Friend, preserve him still;</L>
<L>Nor thwart his Counsels with thy stubborn Will▪</L>
<L>Pliant to all his Admonitions prove,</L>
<L>And yield to all his Offices of Love:</L>
<L>Him from thy Heart, so true, so justly dear,</L>
<L>Let no rash Word nor light Offences tear.</L>
<L>Bear all thou canst, still with his Failings strive,</L>
<L>And to the utmost still, and still forgive;</L>
<L>For strong Necessity alone explores</L>
<L>The secret Vigour of our latent Pow'rs,</L>
<L>Rouses and urges on the lazy Heart,</L>
<L>Force, to its self unknown before, t'exert.</L>
<L>By use thy stronger Appetites asswage,</L>
<L>Thy Gluttony, thy Sloth, thy Lust, thy Rage</L>
<L>From each dishonest Act of Shame forbear;</L>
<L>Of others, and thy self, alike beware.</L>
<L>Let Rev'rence of thy self thy Thoughts control,</L>
<L>And guard the sacred Temple of thy Soul.</L>
<L>Let Justice o'er thy Word and Deed preside,</L>
<L>And Reason ev'n thy meanest Actions guide:</L>
<L>For know that Death is Man's appointed Doom,</L>
<L>Know that the Day of great Account will come,</L>
<L>When thy past Life shall strictly be survey'd,</L>
<L>Each Word, each Deed be in the Balance laid,</L>
<L>And all the Good and all the Ill most justly be repaid.</L>
<L>For Wealth, the perishing, uncertain Good,</L>
<L>Ebbing and flowing like the sickle Flood,</L>
<L>That knows no sure, no fix'd abiding Place,</L>
<L>But wandring loves from Hand to Hand to pass;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Revolve the Getter's Joy and Loser's Pain,</L>
<L>And think if it be worth thy while to gain.</L>
<L>Of all those Sorrows that attend Mankind,</L>
<L>With Patience bear the Lot to thee assign'd;</L>
<L>Nor think it Chance, nor murmur at the Load;</L>
<L>For know what Man calls Fortune is from God.</L>
<L>In what thou may'st from Wisdom seek Relief,</L>
<L>And let her healing Hand asswage the Grief;</L>
<L>Yet still whate'er the Righteous Doom ordains,</L>
<L>What Cause soever multiplies thy Pains,</L>
<L>Let not those Pains as Ills be understood;</L>
<L>For God delights not to afflict the Good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Reas'ning Art to various Ends apply'd,</L>
<L>Is oft a sure, but oft an erring Guide.</L>
<L>Thy Judgment therefore sound and cool preserve,</L>
<L>Nor lightly from thy Resolution swerve;</L>
<L>The dazling Pomp of Words does oft deceive,</L>
<L>And sweet Persuasion wins the Easy to believe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Fools and Liars labour to persuade,</L>
<L>Be dumb, and let the Bablers vainly plead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This above all, this Precept chiefly learn,</L>
<L>This nearly does, and first, thy self concern▪</L>
<L>Let not Example, let no soothing Tongue,</L>
<L>Prevail upon thee with a <HI>Siren</HI>'s Song.</L>
<L>To do thy Soul's Immortal Essence wrong,</L>
<L>Of Good and Ill by Words or Deeds exprest,</L>
<L>Choose for thy self, and always choose the best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let wary Thought each Enterprize forerun,</L>
<L>And ponder on thy Task before begun,</L>
<L>Lest Folly shou'd the wretched Work deface,</L>
<L>And mock thy fruitless Labours with Disgrace.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Fools huddle on and always are in haste,</L>
<L>Act without Thought, and thoughtless Words they waste.</L>
<L>But, thou, in all thou dost, with early Cares</L>
<L>Strive to prevent at first a Fate like theirs;</L>
<L>That Sorrow on the End may never wait,</L>
<L>Nor sharp Repentance make thee Wise too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beware thy meddling Hand in ought to try,</L>
<L>That does beyond thy reach of Knowledge lie;</L>
<L>But seek to know, and bend thy serious Thought</L>
<L>To search the profitable Knowledge out.</L>
<L>So Joys on Joys for ever shall increase,</L>
<L>Wisdom shall crown thy Labours, and shall bless</L>
<L>Thy Life with Pleasure, and thy End with Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor let the Body want its Part, but share</L>
<L>A just Proportion of thy tender Care:</L>
<L>For Health and Welfare prudently provide,</L>
<L>And let its lawful Wants be all supply'd.</L>
<L>Let sober Draughts refresh, and wholsom Fare</L>
<L>Decaying Nature's wasted Force repair;</L>
<L>And sprightly Exercise the duller Spirits chear.</L>
<L>In all Things still which to this Care belong,</L>
<L>Observe this Rule, to guard thy Soul from Wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By virtuous Use thy Life and Manners frame,</L>
<L>Manly and simply pure, and free from Blame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Provoke not Envy's deadly Rage, but fly</L>
<L>The glancing Curse of her malicious Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seek not in needless Luxury to waste</L>
<L>Thy Wealth and Substance, with a Spendthrift's Haste;</L>
<L>Yet flying these, be watchful, lest thy Mind,</L>
<L>Prone to Extremes, an equal Danger find,</L>
<L>And be to sordid Avarice inclin'd.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Distant alike from each, to neither lean,</L>
<L>But ever keep the happy GOLDEN MEAN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be careful still to guard thy Soul from Wrong,</L>
<L>And let thy Thought prevent thy Hand and Tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not the stealing God of Sleep surprise,</L>
<L>Nor creep in Slumbers on thy weary Eyes,</L>
<L>Ere ev'ry Action of the former Day</L>
<L>Strictly thou dost and righteously survey.</L>
<L>With Rev'rence at thy own Tribunal stand,</L>
<L>And answer justly to thy own Demand.</L>
<L>Where have I been? In what have I transgress'd?</L>
<L>What Good or Ill has this Day's Life express'd?</L>
<L>Where have I fail'd in what I ought to do?</L>
<L>In what to God, to Man, or to my self I owe?</L>
<L>Inquire severe what-e'er from first to last,</L>
<L>From Morning's Dawn 'till Ev'ning's Gloom, has past.</L>
<L>If Evil were thy Deeds, repenting mourn,</L>
<L>And let thy Soul with strong Remorse be torn.</L>
<L>If Good, the Good with Peace of Mind repay,</L>
<L>And to thy secret Self with Pleasure say,</L>
<L>Rejoice, my Heart, for all went well to-day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These Thoughts and chiefly these thy Mind should move;</L>
<L>Employ thy Study, and engage thy Love.</L>
<L>These are the Rules which will to Virtue lead,</L>
<L>And teach thy Feet her heav'nly Paths to tread.</L>
<L>This by his Name I swear, whose sacred Lore</L>
<L>First to Mankind explain'd the Mystick FOUR,</L>
<L>Source of Eternal Nature and Almighty Pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In all thou dost first let thy Prayers ascend,</L>
<L>And to the Gods thy Labours first commend,</L>
<L>From them implore Success, and hope a prosp'rous End.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
So shall thy abler Mind be taught to soar,</L>
<L>And Wisdom in her secret Ways explore;</L>
<L>To range through Heav'n above and Earth below,</L>
<L>Immortal Gods and mortal Men to know.</L>
<L>So shalt thou learn what Pow'r does all control,</L>
<L>What bounds the Parts, and what unites the Whole:</L>
<L>And rightly judge, in all this wondrous Frame,</L>
<L>How universal Nature is the same;</L>
<L>So shalt thou ne'er thy vain Affections place</L>
<L>On Hopes of what shall never come to pass,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Man, wretched Man, thou shalt be taught to know,</L>
<L>Who bears within himself the inborn Cause of Woe.</L>
<L>Unhappy Race! that never yet could tell,</L>
<L>How near their Good and Happiness they dwell.</L>
<L>Depriv'd of Sense, they neither hear nor see;</L>
<L>Fetter'd in Vice▪ they seek not to be free,</L>
<L>But stupid, to their own sad Fate agree:</L>
<L>Like pond'rous Rolling-stones, oppress'd with Ill,</L>
<L>The Weight that loads 'em makes 'em roll on still,</L>
<L>Bereft of Choice and Freedom of the Will.</L>
<L>For native Strife in ev'ry Bosom reigns,</L>
<L>And secretly an impious War maintains:</L>
<L>Provoke not THIS, but let the Combat cease,</L>
<L>And ev'ry yielding Passion sue for Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wouldst thou, great <HI>Jave,</HI> thou Father of Mankind,</L>
<L>Reveal the <HI>Demon</HI> for that Task assign'd,</L>
<L>The wretched Race an End of Woes would find▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet be bold, O Man, Divine thou art,</L>
<L>And of the Gods Celestial Essence Part.</L>
<L>Nor sacred Nature is from thee conceal'd,</L>
<L>But to thy Race her mystick Rules reveal'd.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
These if to know thou happily attain,</L>
<L>Soon shalt thou perfect be in all that I ordain.</L>
<L>Thy wounded Soul to Health thou shalt restore,</L>
<L>And free from ev'ry Pain she felt before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Abstain, I warn, from Meats unclean and foul,</L>
<L>So keep thy Body pure, so free thy Soul;</L>
<L>So rightly judge; thy Reason, so, maintain;</L>
<L>Reason which Heav'n did for thy Guide ordain,</L>
<L>Let that best Reason ever hold the Rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then if this mortal Body thou forsake,</L>
<L>And thy glad Flight to the pure Aether take,</L>
<L>Among the Gods exalted shalt thou shine,</L>
<L>Immortal, Incorruptible, Divine:</L>
<L>The Tyrant Death securely shalt thou brave,</L>
<L>And scorn the dark Dominion of the Grave.</L>

<L>His youthful Veins with Hopes of Empire glow,</L>
<L>Swell his bold Heart, and urge him on the Foe:</L>

<L>While from below, old Ocean grones profound,</L>

<L>The welcome Train begins to move,</L>
<L>Hope leads Increase and chaste Connubial Love:</L>
<L><HI>Flora</HI> sweet her Bounty spreads,</L>
<L>Smelling Gardens, painted Meads;</L>
<L><HI>Ceres</HI> crowns the yellow Plain;</L>
<L><HI>Pan</HI> rewards the Shepherd's Pain;</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="33"/>
All is Plenty, all is Wealth,</L>
<L>And on the balmy▪ Air fits Rosy-colour'd Health.</L>
<L>I hear the Mirth, I hear the Land rejoice,</L>
<L>Like many Waters swells the pealing Noise,</L>
<L>While to their Monarch, thus, they raise the publick Voice.</L>
<L>Father of thy Country, hail!</L>
<L>Always, every where prevail;</L>
<L>Pious, Valiant, Just, and Wise,</L>
<L>Better Suns for thee arise,</L>
<L>Purer Breezes fan the Skies,</L>
<L>Earth in Fruits and Flowers is drest,</L>
<L>Joy abounds in ev'ry Breast,</L>
<L>For thee thy People all, for thee the Year is blest.</L>
