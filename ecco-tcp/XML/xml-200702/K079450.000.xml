<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>FAREWELL to Europe, and at once farewell</L>
<L>To all the follies which in Europe dwell,</L>
<L>To Eastern India now, a richer clime,</L>
<L>Richer alas in ev'ry thing but Rime,</L>
<L>The Muses steer their course, and, fond of change,</L>
<L>At large, in other Worlds, desire to range,</L>
<L>Resolv'd at least, since They the fool must play,</L>
<L>To do it in a diff'rent place, and way.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>What whim is this, what errour of the brain,</L>
<L>What madness worse than in the dog-star's reign?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Why into foreign countries would You roam,</L>
<L>Are there not knaves and fools enough at home?</L>
<L>If Satire be thy object, and thy lays</L>
<L>As yet have shewn no talents fit for praise,</L>
<L>If Satire be thy object, search all round,</L>
<L>Nor to thy purpose can one spot be found</L>
<L>Like England, where to rampant vigour grown</L>
<L>Vice choaks up ev'ry Virtue, where, self-sown,</L>
<L>The seeds of Folly shoot forth rank and bold,</L>
<L>And ev'ry seed brings forth a hundred fold.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>No more of this—tho' Truth (the more our shame,</L>
<L>The more our guilt) tho' Truth perhaps may claim,</L>
<L>And justify her part in this, yet here,</L>
<L>For the first time, e'en Truth offends my ear.</L>
<L>Declaim from morn to night, from night to morn,</L>
<L>Take up the theme anew, when day's new-born,</L>
<L>I hear, and hate—be England what She will,</L>
<L>With all her faults She is my Country still.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy Country, and what then? Is that mere word</L>
<L>Against the voice of Reason to be heard?</L>
<L>Are prejudices, deep imbib'd in youth,</L>
<L>To counter-act, and make thee hate the truth?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
'Tis the sure symptom of a narrow soul</L>
<L>To draw its grand attachment from the whole,</L>
<L>And take up with a part; Men, not confin'd</L>
<L>Within such paltry limits, Men design'd</L>
<L>Their nature to exalt; where'er they go,</L>
<L>Wherever waves can roll, and winds can blow,</L>
<L>Where'er the blessed Sun, plac'd in the sky</L>
<L>To watch this subject world, can dart his eye,</L>
<L>Are still the same, and, prejudice outgrown,</L>
<L>Consider ev'ry country as their own.</L>
<L>At one grand view They take in Nature's plan,</L>
<L>Not more at home in England, than Japan.</L>

<L>My good, grave Sir of Theory, whose wit,</L>
<L>Grasping at shadows, ne'er caught substance yet,</L>
<L>'Tis mighty easy o'er a glass of wine</L>
<L>On vain refinements vainly to refine,</L>
<L>To laugh at poverty in plenty's reign,</L>
<L>To boast of Apathy when out of pain,</L>
<L>And in each sentence, worthy of the Schools,</L>
<L>Varnish'd with sophistry, to deal out rules</L>
<L>Most fit for practice, but for one poor fault</L>
<L>That into practice they can ne'er be brought.</L>

<L>At home, and sitting in your elbow-chair</L>

<L>Would not your mind be chang'd, your Spirits fail,</L>
<L>Would you not cast one longing eye to shore,</L>
<L>And vow to deal in such wild schemes no more?</L>
<L>Howe'er our pride may tempt us to conceal</L>
<L>Those passions, which we cannot chuse but feel,</L>
<L>There's a strange Something, which without a brain</L>
<L>Fools feel, and with one wise men can't explain,</L>
<L>Planted in Man, to bind him to that earth,</L>
<L>In dearest ties, from whence he drew his birth.</L>

<LG>
<L>If Honour calls, where'er She points the way,</L>
<L>The Sons of Honour follow, and obey;</L>
<L>If Need compels, wherever we are sent,</L>
<L>'Tis want of courage not to be content;</L>
<L>But, if we have the liberty of choice,</L>
<L>And all depends on our own single voice,</L>
<L>To deem of ev'ry Country as the same</L>
<L>Is rank rebellion 'gainst the lawful claim</L>
<L>Of Nature, and such dull indifference</L>
<L>May be PHILOSOPHY, but can't be SENSE.</L>

<L>Weak and unjust Distinction, strange design,</L>
<L>Most peevish, most perverse, to undermine</L>
<L>PHILOSOPHY, and throw her empire down</L>
<L>By means of SENSE, from whom she holds her crown.</L>
<L>Divine PHILOSOPHY, to Thee we owe</L>
<L>All that is worth possessing here below;</L>
<L>Virtue and Wisdom consecrate thy reign,</L>
<L>Doubled each joy, and Pain no longer Pain.</L>

<L>And wholsome discipline, the rich, rank soil</L>
<L>Teems with incumbrances, where all around</L>
<L>Herbs noxious in their nature make the Ground,</L>
<L>Like the good Mother of a thankless Son,</L>
<L>Curse her own womb, by fruitfulness undone,</L>
<L>Like such a garden, when the human soul,</L>
<L>Uncultur'd, wild, impatient of controul,</L>
<L>Brings forth those passions of luxuriant race,</L>
<L>Which spread, and stifle ev'ry herb of grace,</L>
<L>Whilst Virtue, check'd by the cold hand of scorn,</L>
<L>Seems with'ring on the bed where she was born,</L>
<L>PHILOSOPHY steps in, with steady hand</L>
<L>She brings her aid, she clears th' encumber'd land,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
TOO virtuous, to spare vice one stroke, too wise</L>
<L>One moment to attend to Pity's cries,</L>

<L>She roots up ev'ry weed</L>

<SPEAKER>P. and ev'ry flow'r.</SPEAKER>

<L>PHILOSOPHY, a name of meek degree,</L>
<L>Embrac'd, in token of humility,</L>
<L>By the proud Sage, who, whilst he strove to hide,</L>
<L>In that vain artifice, reveal'd his pride.</L>
<L>PHILOSOPHY, whom Nature had design'd</L>
<L>To purge all errours from the human mind,</L>
<L>Herself misled by the Philosopher,</L>
<L>At once her Priest and Master, made us err;</L>
<L>Pride, Pride, like leaven in a mass of flour,</L>
<L>Tainted her laws, and made e'en Virtue sowre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had she, content within her proper sphere,</L>
<L>Taught lessons suited to the human ear,</L>
<L>Which might fair Virtue's genuine fruits produce,</L>
<L>Made not for ornament, but real use,</L>
<L>The heart of Man unrival'd she had sway'd;</L>
<L>Prais'd by the good, and by the bad obey'd.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
But when She, overturning Reason's throne,</L>
<L>Strove proudly in its place to plant her own,</L>
<L>When She with Apathy the breast would steel,</L>
<L>And teach us, deeply feeling, not to feel,</L>
<L>When She would wildly all her force employ,</L>
<L>Not to correct our passions, but destroy,</L>
<L>When, not content our Nature to restore,</L>
<L>As made by God, She made it all new o'er,</L>
<L>When, with a strange and criminal excess,</L>
<L>To make us more than Men, she made us less,</L>
<L>The Good her dwindled pow'r with pity saw,</L>
<L>The Bad with joy, and none but fools with awe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Truth, with a simple and unvarnish'd tale,</L>
<L>E'en from the mouth of N—might prevail,</L>
<L>Could She get there, but Falshood's sugar'd strain</L>
<L>Should pour her fatal blandishments in vain,</L>
<L>Nor make one convert, tho' the Siren hung,</L>
<L>Where she too often hangs, on M—tongue.</L>
<L>Should all the SOPHS, whom in his course the Sun</L>
<L>Hath seen, or past or present, rise in One,</L>
<L>Should He, whilst pleasure in each sentence flows,</L>
<L>Like PLATO, give us Poetry in Prose,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Should He, full Orator, at once impart</L>
<L>Th' ATHENIAN'S Genius, with the ROMAN'S Art,</L>
<L>Genius and Art should in this instance fail,</L>
<L>Nor Rome tho' join'd with Athens here prevail.</L>
<L>'Tis not in Man, 'tis not in more than man</L>
<L>To make me find one fault in Nature's plan.</L>
<L>Plac'd low ourselves, we censure those above,</L>
<L>And, wanting judgment, think that She wants love,</L>
<L>Blame, where we ought in reason to commend,</L>
<L>And think her most a foe, when most a friend.</L>
<L>Such be PHILOSOPHERS—their specious art,</L>
<L>Tho' Friendship pleads, shall never warp my heart;</L>
<L>Ne'er make me from this breast one passion tear,</L>
<L>Which Nature, my best friend, hath planted there.</L>

<L>Forgiving as a Friend, what, whilst I live,</L>
<L>As a Philosopher I can't forgive,</L>
<L>In this one point at last I join with You;</L>
<L>To Nature pay all that is Nature's due,</L>
<L>But let not clouded Reason sink so low,</L>
<L>To fancy debts she does not, cannot owe.</L>
<L>Bear, to full Manhood grown, those shackles bear,</L>
<L>Which Nature meant us for a time to wear,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
As we wear leading-strings</L>
<L>Are laid aside, when we can walk alone.</L>
<L>But on thyself, by peevish humour sway'd,</L>
<L>Wilt Thou lay burdens Nature never laid?</L>
<L>Wilt Thou make faults, whilst Judgment weakly errs,</L>
<L>And then defend, mistaking them for her's?</L>
<L>Dar'st Thou to say, in our enlight'ned age,</L>
<L>That this grand Master Passion, this brave rage,</L>
<L>Which flames out for thy country, was imprest,</L>
<L>And fix'd by Nature in the human breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you prefer the place where you was born,</L>
<L>And hold all others in contempt and scorn</L>
<L>On fair Comparison; If on that land</L>
<L>With lib'ral, and a more than equal hand</L>
<L>Her gifts, as in profusion, Plenty sends;</L>
<L>If Virtue meets with more and better friends;</L>
<L>If Science finds a Patron 'mongst the great;</L>
<L>If Honesty is Minister of State;</L>
<L>If Pow'r, the guardian of our rights design'd,</L>
<L>Is to that great, that only end confin'd;</L>
<L>If Riches are employ'd to bless the poor;</L>
<L>If Law is sacred, Liberty secure;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Let but these facts depend on proofs of weight,</L>
<L>Reason declares, thy Love can't be too great,</L>
<L>And, in this light could he our Country view,</L>
<L>A very HOTTENTOT must love it too.</L>

<L>But if, by Fate's decrees, you owe your birth</L>
<L>To some most barren and penurious earth,</L>
<L>Where, ev'ry comfort of this life denied,</L>
<L>Her real wants are scantily supplied,</L>
<L>Where Pow'r is Reason, Liberty a Joke,</L>
<L>Laws never made, or made but to be broke,</L>
<L>To fix thy love on such a wretched spot</L>
<L>Because, in lust's wild fever, there begot,</L>
<L>Because, thy weight no longer fit to bear,</L>
<L>By chance not choice, thy Mother dropt thee there,</L>
<L>Is Folly which admits not of defence;</L>
<L>It can't be Nature, for it is not Sense.</L>
<L>By the same argument which here you hold,</L>
<L>(When Falshood's insolent, let Truth be bold)</L>
<L>If Propagation can in torments dwell,</L>
<L>A Devil must, if born there, love his hell.</L>

<L>Had Fate, to whose decrees I lowly bend,</L>
<L>And e'en in punishment confess a friend,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Ordain'd my birth in some place yet untried,</L>
<L>On purpose made to mortify my pride,</L>
<L>Where the Sun never gave one glimpse of day,</L>
<L>Where Science never yet could dart one ray,</L>
<L>Had I been born on some bleak, blasted plain</L>
<L>Of barren Scotland, in a STUART'S reign,</L>
<L>Or in some kingdom, where Men, weak or worse,</L>
<L>Turn'd Nature's ev'ry blessing to a curse,</L>
<L>Where crowns of Freedom, by the Fathers won,</L>
<L>Dropp'd leaf by leaf from each degen'rate Son,</L>
<L>In spite of all the wisdom you display,</L>
<L>All you have said, and yet may have to say,</L>
<L>My weakness here, if weakness, I confess,</L>
<L>I, as my country, had not lov'd her less.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether strict Reason bears me out in this,</L>
<L>Let those who, always seeking, always miss</L>
<L>The ways of Reason, doubt with precious zeal;</L>
<L>Their's be the praise to argue, mine to feel.</L>
<L>Wish we to trace this passion to the root,</L>
<L>We, like a tree, may know it by its fruit,</L>
<L>From its rich stem ten thousand virtues spring,</L>
<L>Ten thousand blessings on its branches cling,</L>

Yet in the circle of revolving years,</L>
<L>Not one misfortune, not one vice appears.</L>
<L>Hence then, and what you Reason call adore;</L>
<L>This, if not Reason, must be something more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But (for I wish not others to confine,</L>
<L>Be their opinions unrestrain'd as mine)</L>
<L>Whether this Love's of good, or evil growth,</L>
<L>A Vice, a Virtue, or a spice of both,</L>
<L>Let men of nicer argument decide;</L>
<L>If it is virtuous, sooth an honest pride</L>
<L>With lib'ral praise; if vicious, be content,</L>
<L>It is a Vice I never can repent;</L>
<L>A Vice which, weigh'd in Heav'n, shall more avail</L>

<L>This wild, untemper'd zeal (which after all</L>
<L>We, Candour unimpeach'd, might madness call)</L>
<L>Is it a Virtue? that You scarce pretend;</L>
<L>Or can it be a Vice, like Virtue's friend,</L>
<L>Which draws us off from, and dissolves the force</L>
<L>Of private ties, nay, stops us in our course</L>
<L>To that grand object of the human soul,</L>
<L>That nobler Love which comprehends the whole.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Coop'd in the limits of this petty isle,</L>
<L>This nook, which scarce deserves a frown, or smile,</L>
<L>Weigh'd with Creation, You, by whim undone,</L>

<L>The gen'rous Soul, by Nature taught to soar,</L>

<L>Was it most sure, which yet a doubt endures,</L>

<L>Invented oft for purposes of Art,</L>

<L>On Shame's black roll, and stink thro' all the land.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>That might some Courage, but no Prudence be;</L>
<L>No hurt to them, and jeopardy to me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Leave out their names.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>For that kind caution thanks,</L>
<L>But may not Judges sometimes fill up blanks?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Country's laws in doubt then you reject:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Laws I love, the Lawyers I suspect:</L>
<L>Amongst twelve Judges may not One be found,</L>
<L>(On bare, bare possibility I ground</L>
<L>This wholesome doubt) who may Enlarge, Retrench,</L>
<L>Create, and Uncreate, and from the Bench,</L>
<L>With winks, smiles, nods, and such like paltry arts,</L>
<L>May work and worm into a jury's hearts,</L>
<L>Or, baffled there, may, turbulent of soul,</L>
<L>Cramp their high office, and their rights controul,</L>
<L>Who may, tho' Judge, turn Advocate at large,</L>
<L>And deal replies out by the way of charge,</L>
<L>Making Interpretation all the way,</L>
<L>In spite of Facts, his wicked will obey,</L>
<L>And, leaving Law without the least defence,</L>
<L>May damn his Conscience to approve his Sense.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whilst, the true guardians of this charter'd land,</L>
<L>In full and perfect vigour, Juries stand,</L>
<L>A Judge in vain shall awe, cajole, perplex.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>Suppose I should be tried in MIDDLESEX.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>To pack a Jury they will never dare.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>There's no occasion to pack Juries there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Gainst Prejudice all arguments are weak,</L>
<L>Reason herself without effect must speak.</L>
<L>Fly then thy Country, like a Coward fly,</L>
<L>Renounce her int'rest, and her laws defy.</L>
<L>But why, bewitch'd, to India turn thy eyes?</L>
<L>Cannot our Europe thy vast wrath suffice?</L>
<L>Cannot thy misbegotten Muse lay bare</L>
<L>Her brawny arm, and play the Butcher there?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy Counsel taken, what should Satire do?</L>
<L>Where could she find an object that is new?</L>
<L>Those travell'd Youths, whom tender Mothers wean,</L>
<L>And send abroad to see, and to be seen,</L>
<L>With whom, least they should fornicate, or worse,</L>
<L>A Tutor's sent by way of a dry nurse,</L>
<L>Each of whom just enough of Spirit bears,</L>
<L>To shew our follies, and to bring home their's,</L>
<L>Have made all Europe's vices so well known,</L>
<L>They seem almost as nat'ral as our own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Will India for thy purpose better do?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>In one respect at least—there's something New.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>A harmless People, in whom Nature speaks</L>
<L>Free and untainted, 'mongst whom Satire seeks,</L>
<L>But vainly seeks, so simply plain their hearts,</L>
<L>One bosom where to lodge her poison'd darts.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>From knowledge speak You this, or, doubt on doubt</L>
<L>Weigh'd and resolv'd, hath Reason found it out?</L>
<L>Neither from knowledge, nor by Reason taught,</L>
<L>You have Faith ev'ry where but where You ought.</L>
<L>India or Europe—What's there in a name?</L>
<L>Propensity to vice in both the same,</L>
<L>Nature alike in both works for Man's good,</L>
<L>Alike in both by Man himself withstood.</L>
<L>Nabobs, as well as those who hunt them down,</L>
<L>Deserve a cord much better than a crown,</L>
<L>And a Mogul can thrones as much debase</L>
<L>As any polish'd Prince of Christian race.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Could You, a task more hard than You suppose,</L>
<L>Could You, in ridicule whilst Satire glows,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Make all their follies to the life appear,</L>
<L>'Tis ten to one You gain no credit here.</L>
<L>Howe'er well-drawn, the Picture after all,</L>
<L>Because we know not the Original,</L>
<L>Would not find favour in the public eye.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>That, having your good leave, I mean to try.</L>
<L>And if Your observations sterling hold,</L>
<L>If the Piece should be heavy, tame, and cold,</L>
<L>To make it to the side of Nature lean,</L>
<L>And, meaning nothing, something seem to mean,</L>
<L>To make the whole in lively colours glow,</L>
<L>To bring before us something that we know,</L>
<L>And from all honest men applause to win,</L>
<L>I'll groupe the Company, and put them in.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be that ungen'rous thought by shame suppress'd,</L>
<L>Add not distress to those too much distress'd.</L>
<L>Have They not, by blind Zeal misled, laid bare</L>
<L>Those sores which never might endure the air?</L>
<L>Have They not brought their mysteries so low</L>
<L>That what the Wise suspected not; Fools know?</L>
<L>From their first rise e'en to the present hour</L>
<L>Have They not prov'd their own abuse of pow'r,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Made it impossible, if fairly view'd,</L>
<L>Ever to have that dang'rous pow'r renew'd,</L>
<L>Whilst, unseduc'd by Ministers, the throne</L>
<L>Regards our Interests, and knows its own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should ev'ry other subject chance to fail,</L>
<L>Those who have sail'd, and those who wish'd to sail</L>
<L>In the last Fleet, afford an ample field</L>
<L>Which must beyond my hopes a harvest yield.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<L>On such vile food Satire can never thrive,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<L>She cannot starve, if there was only CLIVE.</L>
