<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, LORD MARQUISS Of HARTINGTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVery Body is now so full of Business, that things of this kind, which are generally taken for the Entertainment of leisure Hours only, look like Impertinence and Interruption. I am sure it is a Reason why I ought to beg your Lordship's Pardon, for troubling you with this Tragedy; Not but that Poetry has always been, and will still be the En∣tertainment of all wise Men, that have any Delicacy in their Knowledge; Yet at so Critical a Juncture as this is, I must confess I think your Lordship ought to give intirely into those Publick Affairs, which at this time seem to Demand you. It is that happy Turn which your Lordship has to Business, that right Understand∣ing of your Country's Interest, and that constant Zeal to pursue it, that just Thinking, that strong and per
<PB REF="4"/>
suasive Elocution, that firm and generous Resolution, which upon all Occasions you have shewn in Parlia∣ments; and to add, that which is the crowning good Quality, your Lordship's continual Adherence and Un∣shaken Loyalty to His present Majesty, which make you at this time so necessary to the Publick. I must confess, (tho' there is no part in your Lordship's Cha∣racter, but what the World should be fond of) I can∣not help Distinguishing the last Instance very particular∣ly: It is doing (methinks) such a Justice to Goodness, to Greatness, and to Right Reason, that Posterity will believe there could be no Man of good Sense, but what must have agreed with your Lordship in it. When the next Age shall Read the History of this, What Ex∣cuse can they make for those who did not Admire a Prince whose Life has been a Series of good Offices done to Mankind? When they shall reckon up his La∣bours from the Battle of <HI>Seneff,</HI> to some Glorious Acti∣on, which shall be his Last, (and which I therefore hope is very far remov'd from the Present Time?) Will they ever believe that he could have been too well lov'd, or too faithfully serv'd and defended? The Great Things which he did before we had that immediate Interest in him, which we now happily have, is a noble and just Subject for Panegyrick; but as Benefits done to Others, can never touch us so sensibly as those we receive our selves, tho' the Actions may be equally great; so, methinks, I can hardly have patience to run back to his having sav'd his own Country, when I consider he has since done the same for Us; Let that be sufficient to Us, for all we can say of him or do for him. What Dangers and
<PB REF="5"/>
Difficulties has he not struggled through, for the Ho∣nour and Safety of these Kingdoms? 'Tis a common Praise, and what every one speaks, to say, He has con∣tinually expos'd his Life for his People; But there are some things more particular in his Character, some things rarely found amongst the Policies of Princes; a Zeal for Religion, moderated by Reason, without the Rage and Fire of Persecution; a charitable Compassion for those who cannot be convinc'd, and an unalterable Per∣severance in those Principles of whose Truth he is satis∣fy'd; a desire of War for the sake of Peace; and of Peace for the Good and Honour of his Subjects equal∣ly with his own; a pious Care for composing Factions, tho' to foment them might make him Arbitrary; and a generous Ambition that only aims at Pow'r, to en∣able him to do good to all the rest of the World. I might add here, that Inviolable and Religious Observance of his Royal Word, which the best part of the Pow'rs of <HI>Europe,</HI> have so frequently and so happily, for them∣selves, depended upon in the greatest Emergencies. But as this Virtue is generally reckon'd as no more than that common Honesty, which the meanest Man would blush to be without, so it can hardly claim a Place amongst the more particular Excellencies of a Great Prince. It were to be wish'd, indeed, that the World were honest to such a degree, and that there were not that scandalous defect of common Morality. Certainly nothing can be more shocking to Humanity, to the Peace and Order of the World; nothing can approach nearer to that Savage state of Nature, in which every Man is to eat
<PB REF="6"/>
his fellow if he can master him, than an avow'd Liber∣ty of breaking thro' all the most solemn Engagements of publick Faith. 'Tis something that brands a Man with an Infamy, which nothing can extenuate or wipe out; he may protest and pretend to explain his mean∣ing, but the World has generally too much indignati∣on for the Affront, to bear it at that easie rate. Mini∣sters and Secretaries of State, may display their own Parts in Memorials, with as much Pomp and Flourish as they please: I fancy the common answer upon such Occasions will always be, You have deceiv'd us grosly, and we neither can nor will trust you any more. When this Vice comes amongst Men of the first Rank, it is the more shocking, and I could wish there were none such, to whose charge it might be laid.</P>
<P>Some People (who do me a very great Honour in it) have fancy'd, that in the Person of <HI>Tamerlane</HI> I have alluded to the greatest Character of the present Age, I don't know, whether I ought not to apprehend a great deal of Danger from avowing a Design like that. It may be a Task indeed worthy the greatest Genius, which this, or any other Time has produc'd: But therefore I ought not to stand the shock of a Parallel, least it should be seen, to my Disadvantage, how far the <HI>Hero</HI> has <HI>transcended the Poet's Thought.</HI> There are many Features, 'tis true, in that Great Man's Life, not unlike His Ma∣jesty: His Courage, his Piety, his Moderation, his Justice, and his Fatherly Love of his People, but above all, his Hate of Tyranny and Oppression, and his zea lous Care for the Common Good of Mankind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="7"/>
large Resemblance of Him: Several Incidents are alike in their Stories; and there wants nothing to his Majesty but such a deciding Victory, as that by which <HI>Tamerlane</HI> gave Peace to the World. That is yet to come: But I hope we may reasonably expect it from the unanimi∣ty of the present Parliament, and so formidable a Force as that Unanimity will give Life and Vigour to.</P>
<P>If your Lordship can find any thing in this Poem like a Prince, who is so justly the Object of your Lordship's, and indeed of the World's Veneration, I persuade my self it will prevail with you to forgive every thing else that you find amiss. You will excuse the Faults in Writing, for the goodness of the Intention. I hope too, your Lordship will not be displeas'd, that I take this opportunity of renewing the Honour which I formerly had, to be known to your Lordship, and which gives me at once the Pleasure of expressing those Just and Dutiful Sentiments I have for his Majesty, and that strong Inclination which I have always had to be thought,</P>

<LG>
<L>OF all the Muses various Labours, none</L>
<L>Have lasted longer, or have higher flown,</L>
<L>Than those that tell the Fame by ancient Hero's won.</L>
<L>With Pleasure, <HI>Rome</HI> and Great <HI>Augustus,</HI> heard</L>
<L>Arms and the Man sung by the <HI>Mantuan</HI> Bard;</L>
<L>In spight of Time, the sacred Story lives,</L>
<L>And <HI>Caesar</HI> and his Empire still survives.</L>
<L>Like him, (tho' much unequal to his Flame)</L>
<L>Our Author makes a pious Prince his Theme,</L>
<L>High with the foremost Names in Arms he stood,</L>
<L>Had fought, and suffer'd for his Country's Good,</L>
<L>Yet sought not Fame, but Peace, in Fields of Blood.</L>
<L>Safe under him his happy People sate,</L>
<L>And griev'd at distance for their Neighbours Fate.</L>
<L>Whilst with Success, a <HI>Turkish</HI> Monarch Crown'd,</L>
<L>Like spreading Flame, deform'd the Nations round:</L>
<L>With Sword and Fire he forc'd his impious way</L>
<L>To Lawless Pow'r, and Universal Sway:</L>
<L>Some abject States for fear the Tyrant join;</L>
<L>Others for Gold their Liberties resign,</L>
<L>And venal Princes sold their Right Divine.</L>
<L>'Till Heav'n, the growing Evil to redress,</L>
<L>Sent <HI>Tamerlane</HI> to give the World a Peace.</L>
<L>The Hero rouz'd, asserts the Glorious Cause,</L>
<L>And to the Field the chearful Soldier draws:</L>
<L>Around in Crowds his valiant Leaders wait,</L>
<L>Anxious for Glory, and secure of Fate;</L>
<L>Well pleas'd, once more to venture on his side,</L>
<L>And prove that Faith again, which had so oft been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y'd.</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>
The peaceful Fathers, who in Senates meet,</L>
<L>Approve an Enterprize so Just, so Great;</L>
<L>While with their Prince's Arms, their Voice thus join'd,</L>
<L>Gains half the Praise of having sav'd Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n in a Circle, where, like this, the Fair</L>
<L>Were met, the bright Assembly did declare,</L>
<L>Their House with one consent were for the War.</L>
<L>Each urg'd her Lover to unsheath his Sword,</L>
<L>And never spare a Man who broke his Word.</L>
<L>Thus fir'd, the Brave on to the Danger press;</L>
<L>Their Arms were crown'd abroad, with just Success,</L>
<L>And blest at Home with Beauty and with Peace.</L>

<L>His Party, prest with Numbers, soon grew faint,</L>

<L>Bless'd to my wish, I was the Prince <HI>Moneses;</HI></L>
<L>Born and bred up to Greatness: Witness the Blood</L>

<L>Our Noble Houses, nay, her Sexe's Pride:</L>
<L>Nor think my Tongue too lavish, if I speak her</L>
<L>Fair as the Fame of Virtue, and yet chaste</L>
<L>As its cold Precepts, wise beyond her Sex</L>
<L>And blooming Youth, soft as forgiving Mercy,</L>
<L>Yet greatly brave, and jealous for her Honour:</L>
<L>Such as she was, to say I barely lov'd her,</L>
<L>Is poor to my Soul's meaning: From our Infancy</L>
<L>There grew a mutual Tenderness between us,</L>
<L>'Till not long since her Vows were kindly plighted</L>
<L>To a young Lord, the Equal of her Birth.</L>
<L>The happy Day was fix'd, and now approaching,</L>
<L>When faithless <HI>Bajazet</HI> (upon whose Honour,</L>

<L>(Which waited for her Naptials) were surpriz'd,</L>
<L>And made the Captives of the Tyrant's Power</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18"/>
Soon as we reach'd his Court, we found our Usage</L>
<L>Beyond what we expected, fair, and noble:</L>
<L>'Twas then the Storm of your victorious Arms</L>
<L>Look'd black, and seem'd to threaten, when he press'd me</L>
<L>(By oft repeated Instances) to draw</L>
<L>My Sword for him? But when he found my Soul</L>
<L>Disdain'd his Purpose, he more fiercely told me,</L>
<L>That my <HI>Arpasia,</HI> my lov'd Sister's Fate</L>
<L>Depended on my Courage shewn for him.</L>
<L>I had long learnt to hold my self at nothing,</L>
<L>But for her sake; to ward the Blow from her,</L>
<L>I bound my Service to the Man I hated.</L>
<L>Six Days are past, since by the Sultan's Order</L>

<L>Somewhat to Love, and to my Sexes tenderness,</L>
<L>This very Now, I could put off my Being,</L>

<L>Since thou art arm'd for all things, after Death.</L>

<L>Which Age, or Sickness brings, the least Disorder,</L>

<L>Threaten'd the Ruin of our sinking State;</L>
<L>'Till you, from whom our Being we receive,</L>
<L>In pity bid your own Creation live.</L>
<L>With moving Sounds you kindly drew the Fair,</L>
<L>And fix'd, once more, that shining Circle here.</L>
<L>The Lyre you bring is half <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Praise;</L>
<L>Be ours the Task to win and wear his Bays.</L>
<L>Thin Houses were before so frequent to us,</L>
<L>We wanted not a Project to undo us.</L>
<L>We seldom saw your Honours but by chance,</L>
<L>As some Folks meet their Friends of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI></L>
<L>'Twas Verse decay'd, or Politicks improv'd,</L>
<L>That had estrang'd you thus from what you lov'd.</L>
<L>Time was, when busie Faces were a Jest,</L>
<L>When Wit and Pleasure were in most request;</L>
<L>When chearful Theaters with Crowds were grac'd</L>
