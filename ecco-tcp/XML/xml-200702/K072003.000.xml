<P>TO your Censures I commit the following Piece, since you are all the proper Judges of my Tryal. If I am condemned, I shall receive my Sentence without Murmuring; and, if acquitted, with sincere Thanks: But as every Offender would find some Pretence to mitigate his Crime, I will only put
<PB REF="3"/>
you in mind that I have march'd under all your Banners in many Winter Colds and Summer Heats, and given Proofs of my <HI>Conduct,</HI> if not of my Courage, and have disciplin'd some of your Troops. <HI>Tho' my Enemies have beat me to the Pit</HI> (as <HI>Brutus</HI> said), yet, thank Heaven! some few Friends have interpos'd, and prevented my falling in: There is a Consolation in Innocence that is our best Shield.</P>
<P>I am bad at Compliments, but I wish you all the Success your Merits deserve; Copy the <HI>Roman Roscius</HI> (tho' a Hea∣then) while you live; and, when you die, it may be said of you as the noble <HI>Cicero</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Every Person may not know that <HI>Marcus Tullius Cicero</HI> and <HI>Roscius</HI> lived in the same Cen∣tury, and were Cotemporaries, though the <HI>Orator</HI> was much the younger, and was taught all that Energy in his Orations he was so much famed for, by <HI>Roscius. Tully</HI> survived him many Years. He derived his Line from <HI>Tullius Appius</HI> King of the <HI>Volsci,</HI> and took his Name from <HI>Cicer,</HI> a <HI>Chich-pea</HI> (or as we call them in <HI>England, Vech),</HI> by having a Wart on his Forehead which resembled that Pulse. These great Men <HI>(Cicero</HI> and <HI>Roscius)</HI> flourished about the Year of the World 3880, 60 Years before the Birth of Christ.</NOTE>said of that celebrated Actor:</P>

<Q>Which of us all would be so unpo∣lished and obdurate, as not to be sen∣sibly moved with the Death of RO∣SCIUS? Who, tho' dying in Old Age, yet his excellent Art, and sweet Manner of Deportment, influenced every one to wish him immortal.</Q>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A PREFACE</HI> is Part of the Habit to a <HI>Book,</HI> and no Author can appear full∣dress'd without it: 'Tis a <HI>Cockade</HI> to an Of∣ficer, a <HI>Nosegay</HI> to a Lawyer, a <HI>Patch</HI> or a <HI>Fan</HI> to a fine Lady, or, a <HI>Ribband</HI> to her Lap-Dog.</P>
<P>If I should tell my Readers, I am prevailed upon with great Intreaties from my Friends to publish this Piece, I should embark with a Fals∣hood (for it is my own Free-will, Act and Deed); and I would willingly have my Readers believe I publish nought but Truth. My Cargo is genu∣ine, and I have taken up but little on Credit.</P>
<P>If the good Reader should find better Scraps of Rhyme than my own (which I presume will not be over-difficult), I have given them di∣stinguishing Marks, that there may be no Doubts on that Account.</P>
<P>The numerous Notes I have squeezed in, are meant to divert; if I lose my Aim, I shall con∣tent myself with considering, I may be but one among ten thousand that have been mistaken.</P>
<P>I have unnumbered Thanks to many in this Kingdom, and in particular to a young Gentleman whose Good-nature has been indefatigable in my Interest. The other a Gentleman eminent in the
<PB REF="6"/>
Law, who has made my Cause his own. It gives me great Concern I am not permitted pub∣licly to own their unbounded Goodness and Generosity, since such <HI>Sterling</HI> Friends are but seldom met with by Wretches in Misfortune.</P>
<P>I am <HI>Unfortunate</HI> I own, but (as <HI>Oroonoko</HI> says) <HI>not ashamed of being so.</HI> I bear all with Patience and Chearfulness; which I find has occasion'd the following Flight of Poetry from a Friend. I know Authors often write to them∣selves; yet I'll assure you, on my Veracity, it is not the Case here; tho' I must allow a little Vanity in my Composition makes me willing to insert it.</P>

<HEAD>A General HISTORY OF THE STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE STAGE is almost as old as the sacred Inspiration of the Muse; ad∣mir'd, when at <HI>Nurse,</HI> and even in its Infant Prattle, pleasing: Born in <HI>Greece,</HI> and nourish'd at <HI>Athens.</HI> A merry Author says, in a Prologue,
<Q><L><HI>Thespis,</HI> the first Professor of our Art,</L>
<L>At Country Wakes sung Ballads in a Cart.</L></Q>
And tho' <HI>Bacchus</HI> is allowed to be the Father, yet all Nations, <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>modern,</HI> esteem'd it to be a <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>instructive</HI> Entertainment.</P>
<P>The early Stages were, indeed, no more than native Turf, or Sod; and what was first exhibited, of a Piece, simple Pastoral Songs, sometimes mix'd with Scandal or Abuse, and, may be, home Truths; like the <HI>Terrae Filius</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or the blazoning <HI>Peccadillos</HI> of two
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
opponent Members setting up for the same Borough. Yet, from these Seeds of Satire, we owe a <HI>Juvenal, Perseus, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Petro∣nius,</HI> and, indeed, the whole Race of <HI>Heroic, Epic, Dramatic,</HI> and <HI>Pastoral</HI> Poets and Po∣etry; your <HI>Spondees</HI> and <HI>Dactyls,</HI> the <HI>Buskin</HI> and <HI>Sock,</HI> the <HI>Laurel</HI> and <HI>Bays.</HI></P>
<P>From these Turf Stages, the Players, such as they were, mounted a Cart, or some such Vehicle, and began to travel Bag and Baggage, perhaps like the Picture of the Itinerants in <HI>Scarron</HI>'s comical Romance. Hear what <HI>Ho∣race</HI> says, in <HI>Latin:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ignotum Tragicae genus invenisse Camoenae</L>
<L>Dicitur, &amp; plaustris vexisse Poemata <HI>Thespis:</HI></L>
<L>Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora.</L>

<L>Aeschylus &amp; modicis implevit pulpita tignis;</L>
<L>Et docuit magnumquae loqui, nitique <HI>Cothurno.</HI></L></Q>

<L>With Tragedy, ne'er trod a decent Stage;</L>
<L>But in a Waggon drove his Plays about,</L>
<L>And shew'd mean antick Tricks to please the Rout:</L>
<L>His Songs uneven, rude, in ev'ry Part;</L>
<L>His Actors smutted, and the Stage a Cart.</L>

<L>Next <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aeschylus,</HI> a celebrated <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, an <HI>Athenian.</HI> There are several <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedies of his handed down to us, and, as <HI>Casaubon</HI> imagines, many more lost. By some Authors he is suppos'd to have been one of the Per∣formers in his own Dramatic Pieces The learned <HI>Tho∣mas Stanley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> has publish'd this an∣tient Author in <HI>Latin,</HI> with the original <HI>Greek</HI> on one Side, illustrated with elaborate Notes, in <HI>Folio.</HI></NOTE><HI>Aeschylus</HI> did greater Art express,</L>
<L>He built a Stage, and taught them how to dress;</L>
<L>In decent Motion he his Parts convey'd,</L>
<L>And made them look as great as those they play'd. </L><BIBL>CREECH.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The first Theatre in <HI>Athens</HI> was built, by the Directions of <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> at the public Charge. It was a wooden Pile, yet very spacious. But at the Representation of one of the Tragedies compos'd by <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> according to <HI>Suidas,</HI> the Building gave way, by the monstrous Weight of 20000 Spectators, and many were kill'd and maim'd. To prevent such fatal Ac∣cidents for the future, the City order'd one more magnificent to be erected, intirely built with Stone, capable of holding half the Inhabitants without the former Danger: Some Authors say of Marble, surpassing, in Elegance, the Temples of their Gods. It consisted of two Parts, the <HI>Scena,</HI> and <HI>Cavea:</HI> The <HI>Scena,</HI> that Part which form'd the Stage, and other Conveniencies be∣longing to it; the upper Part for their <HI>Scenes</HI> and <HI>Machinery,</HI> which were generally flat Cur∣tains, with all the Variety of Painting, let oc∣casionally down to vary the Prospect, and ma∣nage
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
the Machinery; as <HI>Lee</HI> intimates, in the Tragedy of <HI>Oedipus:</HI>
<Q><L>O! that, as oft I have at <HI>Athens</HI> seen</L>
<L>The Stage <HI>arise,</HI> and the big Clouds <HI>descend.</HI></L></Q>
The <HI>Cavea</HI> was the Place where the Spectators were seated: The under Part of the Stage was form'd for raising any thing particular for the different Performances, where were also placed the brazen Tubes for Thunder, and Utensils for Lightning, and many other Con∣veniencies, according to <HI>Graevius:</HI>
<Q><L>With brazen Thunder, forked Lightning hurl'd,</L>
<L>That blazing stream'd, to fright the mimic World.</L></Q>
They had also different Thunder, for good or bad Omens, according to <HI>Athenaeus:</HI>
<Q><L>Auspicious Omen rends the Womb of Night,</L>
<L>And forked Lightning flashes from the Right.</L></Q>
And again,
<Q><L>Ill-Omen'd Lightning has the Welkin cleft,</L>
<L>And rolling Thunder bellows from the Left.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may well be ask'd by Numbers, If these <HI>Theatres</HI> were so large and spacious, what sort of <HI>Theatrical</HI> Performers must those distant Ages produce? They must either have <HI>Stentro∣phon</HI> Voices, or their Auditors most delicate auricular Faculties. No; in my Opinion the
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
Senses of Hearing and Seeing were much the same as now: But as to the Voice, that, indeed, doubtless, wanted Assistance; which to help, they had Coverings to the whole Head and Face, and over the Face a <HI>Mask,</HI> with a Mouth only, to strengthen the Sound of the Voice; in my poor Opinion, wretched Assistance! Where were the <HI>Eyes</HI> and Muscles of the Countenance, to command, implore, exult, upbraid, consent, refuse, and all those different Passions that agitate the Mind, wherein the Eyes are the <HI>Index?</HI> These <HI>Masks</HI> were made to cover the Head, as was said before, adorn'd with Hair proper to the Character the Actor was to represent upon the Stage. Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI> has given an engrav'd Specimen of several Masks us'd on the <HI>Roman Theatre,</HI> in her Translation of <HI>Terence,</HI> which she procur'd in an ancient Manuscript of that Author's Works. The <HI>Romans</HI> follow'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> in their <HI>Drama;</HI> so, we may be assured, these Helps came from <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> But as the Voice was to be mo∣dell'd, so was the Person; therefore the <HI>Cothur∣nus,</HI> or <HI>Buskin,</HI> was invented, not like our mo∣dern <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Buskin, but an Elevation of Person, half a Yard, or so, to emulate the Size of Immortals, or earthly Giants, and He∣roes; like our waggish Boys, appearing upon Stilts. But the <HI>Cothurnus</HI> was only made use of in Tragedy to <HI>step stately;</HI> for if they had hurry'd, they might have been in some Danger of kissing the Ground: Neither could they, I suppose, pay Homage to their Monarch, or
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
their Mistress, tho' perhaps, in those Days, Kneeling was neither a Mark of Submission, or Adoration, at least among the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But thus are their Actors pictur'd out by many Au∣thors. <HI>Cornelius Nepos</HI> tells us, most of the Per∣formers on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Theatres were the chief of the Nobility, Persons of great Learning and Dignity, <HI>Poets, Orators,</HI> and <HI>Historians;</HI> even <HI>Kings</HI> did not disdain to appear on the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI> Stage. But, what is most surprising, these monstrous Piles of Buildings were so contriv'd, that two of these large Theatres could turn, join, and form an <HI>Amphitheatre</HI> for the hunting wild Beasts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Casaubon,</HI> in his Description of the Splendor of <HI>Rome,</HI> says, that <HI>Curio,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Knight, to entertain the People, built two spacious The∣atres in such a Manner, Back to Back (if it may be so term'd), first for the <HI>Histriones</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Histriones,</HI> or Actors, took their Name from <HI>Hister,</HI> in the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Language, a Player.</NOTE>, or Actors, to perform in the Morning; in the Afternoon they were mov'd, to meet each other, and form one spacious <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> where the Combats of Gladiators and Wild Beasts were perform'd. But when we consider the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Engines of War, the <HI>Turres</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Turres Mobiles,</HI> or moving Towers of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> are the same of those of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which they copied from them. They are used in besieging the Walls of a City, generally 150 Foot high, and 30 Foot square, containing many Rooms in Length, and Height, capable of holding a large Body of Soldiers, with Arms and other Engines, Ladders, Bridges to throw over the City-wall for the Sol∣diers to enter the Town; and all this mighty Bulk put together in three Hours, as <HI>Gronovius</HI> tells us, with Wheels that could move it forward or back by Men, to shove, or draw, to press on, or retreat; some of the Sto∣ries fill'd with Archers and Slingers, another with Fire∣balls, the rest with Spears and Darts, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and a whole Catalogue of others, the Wonder will cease.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14"/>
The <HI>Athenian</HI> Theatre was, beyond all doubt, the primal and eldest Child of the <HI>Drama;</HI> and, consequently, must have the earliest of the Dra∣matic Poets, and most in Number. We have not many more of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dramatic Bards, after naming <HI>Seneca</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The learned <HI>Seneca</HI> was born at <HI>Cordova</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI> This is not the Stoic Philosopher, whom, by his moral Writings, <HI>Hierome</HI> ranks among the List of sacred Authors; tho' both these great Men were born in <HI>Cor∣dova.</HI></NOTE>for Tragedy, and <HI>Plau∣tus</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plautus</HI> was born in <HI>Umbria,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> Notwithstanding his Reputation as a Comic Poet, thro' his extravagant Way of Living, he was, at last, reduced to get his Subsistence by turning a Baker's Hand∣mill: A <HI>Memento</HI> for Poets, as well as Players.</NOTE>, with <HI>Terence</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Terence</HI> was born at <HI>Carthage,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Africa,</HI> that so long contended with the <HI>Roman</HI> Republic.

The <HI>Socci</HI> is no more than we say in <HI>Eng∣lish (Seck),</HI> and used in Comedy only; For Tragedy, with the <HI>Chorus,</HI> and Comedy, were a long time the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Entertain∣ments. The Chorus might, indeed, be term'd <HI>Interludes,</HI> tho' their Substance were mostly relative to the Story, as Thoughts of the fore∣going
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
Subject of the Scene, by Standers-by, or Over-hearers. Yet these, by degrees, melted away, and <HI>Mimes</HI> or <HI>Pantomimes</HI> were instituted in their room. Some of our <HI>English</HI> Authors have their Chorus after the antient Manner, <HI>viz. Shakespear</HI> in his <HI>Henry</HI> V. and <HI>Winter's Tale; Milton</HI> in his <HI>Samson Agonistes; Sandys</HI> in his <HI>Christ's Passion;</HI> and the late Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in his two Tragedies from the <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> of our <HI>Shakespear,</HI> and others. The <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI> crept in, and shov'd out these antient Chorus's; some were loose and wanton <HI>Mimics,</HI> that the <HI>Roman</HI> Luxury too well lik'd; others were more de∣cent, who by Action and Gesture could de∣scribe a Story without speaking, in all its Va∣riety of Passions. One of these was so excellent, that when a foreign Prince came to <HI>Rome</HI> in the Time of <HI>Nero</HI> the Tyrant, at his Depar∣ture, he ask'd no other Favour of the Emperor, but that <HI>Mime,</HI> whom he had seen perform, for this Reason; that as he had many barba∣rous Nations bordering round him, of different Speech, this Man by his Action could be an excellent Interpreter, whose Meaning was so well understood without the Use of Speech. <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI> are generally the same thing; but to translate them Buffoons (as <HI>Coo∣per</HI> in his Dictionary) is something too low a Meaning. I shall leave the Antients to rest quietly in their Graves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Drama</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and all over <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> began as meanly as its first Original in
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
<HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> and our Poetry as crude. The first Play, at least that has appeared in Print, was with this Title, <HI>Gammer Gurton</HI>'s <HI>Needle,</HI> a Comedy, acted at <HI>Christ's-College, Cambridge.</HI> Writ by Mr. S. Master of Arts. And an art∣ful Piece it is. <HI>Gammer Gurton</HI> has lost her Needle, and truly great Hunt is made about it; her Boy is sent to blow the Embers in order to light a Candle to help the Search. The damn'd Witch of a Cat is got in the Chim∣ney, with her two fiery Eyes. The Boy cries, <HI>It is the Devil of a Fire;</HI> for when he puffs, it's out; and when he does not, it's in. <HI>Stir it</HI>! cries Gammer <HI>Gurton.</HI> The Boy does as he's bid. The Fire, or rather the Cat, flies among a Pile of Wood; the Boy cries, <HI>The House will be burnt</HI>! All Hands to work. The Cat is disco∣ver'd by a Priest (having a little more Cunning than the rest). This is the <HI>Episode.</HI> The main <HI>Plot</HI> and <HI>Catastrophe</HI> are full as good. Gammer <HI>Gurton,</HI> it seems, had the Day before been mend∣ing her Man <HI>Hodge</HI>'s Breeches. Now <HI>Hodge</HI> in some Game of Merriment was to be pu∣nish'd by three Slaps on the <HI>Bum,</HI> by the brawny open Hand of one of his Fellow Bumpkins. His Head is laid down in Gam∣mer <HI>Gurton</HI>'s Lap; the first Slap is given—<HI>Hodge,</HI> with great Exclamation, bellows out, <HI>Oh</HI>! He declares his Grief! and searching for the Cause of his Pain—O, happy! the Needle was found bury'd up to the Eye in the Posterior of poor <HI>Hodge</HI>! It was pull'd out with great Re∣joicing
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
by all but the Delinquent, who express'd some Pain; and so ends this excellent <HI>Comedy.</HI></P>
<P>But Time has polish'd this Rudeness, and true <HI>English Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> is allow'd to stand in the utmost Perfection. Yet Bunglers will still be dabbling. Every polite Nation delights in the <HI>Drama.</HI> The heavy <HI>Dutch</HI> have Plays in their own Language, but they are generally plann'd from the Old Testament. I had a De∣scription of one given me, from an <HI>English</HI> Spectator. It was the Story of <HI>Abraham</HI> sa∣crificing his Son <HI>Isaac.</HI> But <HI>Abraham</HI> was arm'd with a <HI>Gun</HI> instead of a sacrificing <HI>Knife.</HI> The Angel, to prevent the Gun from firing, sprinkled some warm Water, a Distillation of its own making. The <HI>Ram</HI> in the Brake (which was represented by Boughs of Laurel) was a plump fat <HI>Dutchman</HI> (marry'd I suppose) with fair brow-spread Antlers on his Head, fix'd very artificially; and all the Decorations were of a Piece. But they have a handsome regular <HI>Theatre</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> occupy'd by a <HI>French</HI> Troop of <HI>Comedians.</HI> Even the distant <HI>Chinese</HI> have very fine Theatres. I saw, in my Youth, a <HI>Chinese</HI> Performance at <HI>Canton,</HI> where the <HI>Scenes, Machines,</HI> and <HI>Habits,</HI> were sur∣prising and magnificent; but not understand∣ing the Language, <HI>the Glare growing familiar,</HI> as <HI>Addison</HI> says by Beauty,
<Q><L>Faded on the Eye, and pall'd upon the Sense.</L></Q>
<HI>Du Halde</HI> in his History of <HI>China</HI> has transla∣ted
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
into <HI>French</HI> several of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Drama∣tic Authors; but they seem plann'd mostly a∣like—A Prince secreted in his Youth by an evil Minister, and counterplotted by a good one: The Child at last brought from its Ob∣scurity, marry'd to a great Princess, and begins his happy Reign. But these illustrious Ladies have but little to say for themselves, no more than the lost Daughters in the <HI>Comedies</HI> of <HI>Te∣rence,</HI> found again by the Parents, and mar∣ry'd to the Son of a Friend. <HI>Tavernier</HI> in his Travels to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> informs us, that <HI>Theatres</HI> have been many Ages the Diversion of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and more magnificent than those of <HI>Europe.</HI> He relates a long Description of them; and the more to illustrate that Account, gives you the <HI>Plan</HI> and <HI>Picture</HI> of one en∣grav'd, with the <HI>Scenes</HI> and <HI>Machines.</HI> The People of <HI>America</HI> had their Theatre, accord∣ing to <HI>Acosta</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Acosta,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that wrote the History of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> before <HI>Cortez</HI> had conquer'd it, says, the <HI>Amantas,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Philosophers, were also Poets, and invented <HI>Comedies</HI> and <HI>Tragedies,</HI> which were acted on their Festivals before the King, the Royal Family, and the Court; the Actors being the Noblemen and great Officers of the Army. The Subject of their <HI>Tragedies</HI> were the Victories and great Actions of their Ancestors, which seem'd to be the best Means they had of preserv∣ing the Memory of what was past. In their <HI>Comedies,</HI> their Husbandry, their Houshold Affairs and Commerce were represented, and the most remarkable Follies in Life expos'd. The Poets taught them what they had to say, not by Writing, but by Memory; for Orthogra∣phy was not known among the <HI>Indians</HI> till after the Conquest.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Lopez de Vega,</HI> the Christian Religion was propagated among the <HI>Americans</HI> by the Theatre. Read in his own Words what he writes upon the Sub∣ject: <Q>Every Part of Gospel-history is thrown into a Play, and the <HI>Indians</HI> are the Actors (instructed by the <HI>Jesuits);</HI> one acts our <HI>Saviour,</HI> another St. <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> a third <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> a fourth <HI>Judas,</HI> and so on. This they look upon as the readiest Way of instruct∣ing the vulgar <HI>Indians</HI> in the Christian Religion, and to fix the Sacred History of it in their Memories.</Q></P></NOTE>. But what need we travel so far
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
from Home? 'Tis Time to come back to our own Country, with this Observation, that po∣lite Nations allow the <HI>Theatre</HI> a wise and instructive Amusement. Even the Apostles did not disapprove of Plays, and no doubt read them; for St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his First Epistle to the <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> quotes <HI>Menander</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Comic Poet, and sets down his own Phrase in his own Words, xvth Chapter, 33d Verse, <HI>Be not de∣ceiv'd—Evil Communication corrupts good Man∣ners.</HI> Arts, Sciences, and even Trade, gene∣rally flourish with the Theatre, and, I think, <HI>Religion</HI> and Politeness, and why may not the <HI>Drama</HI> be a great Mark of a civiliz'd Nation? The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> were in their highest Glory when the <HI>Stage</HI> flourish'd. I need not say, that the <HI>Theatre</HI> in <HI>England</HI> came in with the Reformation, and the long-reign'd <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> whose great Learning not only made her give it Encouragement, but Sir <HI>Roger Naunton</HI> tells us, that great Queen translated one of the Tragedies of <HI>Euripides</HI> from the
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
original <HI>Greek</HI> for her own Amusement. Our immortal <HI>Shakespear</HI> met Reward from that illustrious Princess, and her Influence brought forth his inimitable Genius to that high Lustre, where it will shine unrival'd to after Ages, never once clouded but in the Time of Fa∣naticism, and drear Darkness of <HI>Canting</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy. France</HI> was poring in the thick Mist, till <HI>Hardy</HI> their first Poet shewed Dra∣matic Light; then all Branches of Learning began to shine, and spread their Lustre, im∣prov'd their Arts and Arms, and warm'd their wide-spreading Nation to Glory, when Conquest waited on their Monarch, and Vic∣tory cover'd him with Laurels, till check'd by the <HI>British</HI> Lion. Ambition in great Minds stands rank'd in the Line of Virtue; but I think to bound it is more truly a Virtue, as sweet-tongu'd <HI>Waller</HI> writes:</P>
<LG>
<L>If the successful Troublers of Mankind,</L>
<L>With Laurel crown'd, so great Applause do find;</L>
<L>Shall the vex'd World less Honour yield to those,</L>
<L>That stop their Progress, and their Rage oppose?</L>
<L>Next to that Pow'r which does the Ocean awe,</L>
<L>Is to set Bounds, and give Ambition Law.</L>
</LG>
<P>But let me set Bounds to myself.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Stage</HI> flourish'd in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> the First, with such excellent Dramatic Poets, <HI>viz. Shakespear, Ben Johnson, Massenger,</HI> and many others, we may be well assur'd the <HI>Actors</HI> did not fall much
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
short of the <HI>Writers.</HI> Nature is the same in every Age. <HI>Taylor, Burbidge, Lowen, Hem∣mings, Condel, Allen, Mason, Field, Tarlton,</HI> and others that performed in the Plays of <HI>Shakespear, Johnson,</HI> &amp;c. have their public Praises in several cotemporary Authors. Mr. <HI>Marlow</HI> in his Preface to the <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Malta</HI> (a Play acted before King <HI>Charles</HI> the First and his Queen, at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> in the Year 1633.) writes, "that Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> and Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> perform'd their Parts with that Excellence, that it was beyond conceiving." Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> in his Chronicles of <HI>England,</HI> at the latter End of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> after giving an Account of the eminent Persons in that Reign, writes thus of three Actors: "Excellency in the meanest Things deserves Remembrance. <HI>Richard Burbidge,</HI> and <HI>Edward Allen,</HI> two such Ac∣tors, as no Age must ever look to see the like: And, to make their Comedies com∣plete, <HI>Richard Tarlton,</HI> for the <HI>Clown's</HI> Part, never had his Match, nor never will have." What this Writer calls the <HI>Clown's</HI> Part, were such as <HI>Launcelot</HI> in the <HI>Merchant of Venice, Touchstone</HI> in <HI>As you like it,</HI> the Fool in <HI>King Lear,</HI> and Parts of the Kind, which required Persons of infinite Humour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Heywood</HI> was not only an excel∣lent Actor, but a very great Author, and Dra∣matic Poet. I have read all his Works that are extant, and in my poor Judgment he may be accounted the first of the second-rank'd Poets in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and

BURBIDGE. Mr. <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> another great Actor, founded and endowed a College <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This College was first designed for the Relief and Support of six Men, six Women, with six Children, Persons thro' Indigence, Misfortunes, or old Age, be∣longing to the Theatres of <HI>London.</HI> But, when the Building was going forward, Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> having left off acting, he recommended a Door-keeper to his quondam Brother Actors; they absolutely refused him that small Favour, which so enraged him, that he turned his Bounty another Way. Both Parties, perhaps, to blame; but, I believe, few censured him <HI>out</HI> of the Theatres at that Time. He afterwards increased the Number of Children to twelve, from the Age of five Years, to be taught and maintained till 14 or 15. We may imagine the Founder no very great Friend to Matrimony, since he left Directions, that the Governor should continue a Batchelor, and one of his own Name; and to give place to another <HI>Allen,</HI> should he once change his Condition. The College is a noble Building, with a very handsome Chapel, the Altar-piece elegantly painted, with a well-ton'd Organ; and it is the Duty of the Organist to teach the Children to sing the proper Services of the Church. The decent Decorum is admired by all. There is also an elegant Pleasure-Garden, with a useful Orchard and Kitchen-Garden, all well-stock'd with the best Fruits, &amp;c. Fish-ponds, that yield large Quantities of <HI>Carp, Tench, Perch,</HI> and <HI>Eels.</HI> And, much to the Credit of the Managers of this Charity, the original Estate left by the Founder is more than trebled in Va∣lue, and they have Money in their Treasury ready for another Purchase. I shall end this Account with what Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> writes in his Chronicle of <HI>England</HI> where he closes the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the First: <Q>About this Time (1624.) <HI>Edward Allen,</HI> of <HI>Dulwich</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> founded a fair Hospital at <HI>Dulwich,</HI> for six poor Men, six poor Women, and twelve poor Chil∣dren from the Age of four to six Years, to be there maintained and taught till the Age of Fourteen or Sixteen, and to have a Schoolmaster, with Diet, and a convenient Stipend.

We have had great Generals, knowing Ad∣mirals, worthy Discoverers of new Worlds, as well as illustrious Poets, in the two last Ages; and why may not their cotemporary Theatrical Performers be as great in their Way? An Author, who wrote about Forty Years past, speaks thus of Mr. <HI>Betterton:</HI> <Q>In the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet</HI> Prince of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> performed the Part of young <HI>Hamlet.</HI> Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> was, by many, supposed the natural Son of <HI>Shakespear.</HI> He succeeded <HI>Ben Johnson</HI> as Poet-Laureat in 1637. and obtained a Patent for a Company of Comedians from King <HI>Charles,</HI> and was knighted by that Monarch. He was accounted a great Poet, in several Branches of that Science: His Poem of <HI>Gondibert</HI> is esteemed a noble Poem, which he wrote in <HI>France</HI> during his Exile with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. His Works are printed in Folio 1673, which contains 17 Dramatic Pieces, besides his Poems, with his Head crowned with Laurel. The Features seem to resemble the open Countenance of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> but the want of a Nose gives an odd Cast to the Face. I shall not inquire how he came Noseless, yet give you a stale Jest upon the Occasion. Sir <HI>William</HI> walking by <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> a Fishmonger's Boy, in watering his Fish upon the Stall, besprinkled the <HI>Laureat;</HI> who, snuffling, loudly com∣plained of the Abuse. The Master begged the Knight's Pardon, and was for chastising his Servant with some Expostulations, as well as a Cudgel. <HI>Zounds, Sir,</HI> cry'd the Boy, <HI>it's very hard I must be corrected for my Clean∣liness; the Gentleman blew his Nose upon my Fish, and I was washing it off, that's all.</HI> The Jest pleased Sir <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> so well, that he gave him a Piece of Money, and went away highly delighted. Since I have given you one old Jest upon the Nose of Sir <HI>William,</HI> I'll venture to throw in another. As he was walking along the <HI>Mews,</HI> an importunate Beggar-woman teiz'd him for Charity, with often repeating, <HI>Heaven bless your Eye-sight! God preserve your Worship's Eye sight—Why, what's the Mat∣ter with my Eye-sight, Woman?</HI> reply'd Sir <HI>William, I find no Defect there. Ah! good Sir, I wish you never may,</HI> return'd the Beggar; <HI>for should your Sight ever fail you, you must borrow a Nose of your Neighbour to hang your Spectacles on.</HI> His Play of the <HI>Law against Lovers</HI> is <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Measure for Measure,</HI> with a very little Alteration, and as <HI>little</HI> for the better. Sir <HI>William</HI> was the Contriver of painted Scenes in our <HI>English</HI> Theatres, as well as one of the first Introducers of singing Operas. There is a Work of this Kind, whose Title runs thus: <Q>The Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> expressed by Instrumental and Vocal Music, and by Art of Per∣spective in Scenes, at the <HI>Cock-Pit</HI> in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> at three in the Afternoon, 1658.</Q></NOTE>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
having seen Mr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> of the <HI>Black-Friers</HI> Playhouse, act this Part (who was instructed by the Author <HI>Shakespear),</HI> remembred him so well, that he taught Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> in every Article; which, by his exact Per∣formance, gained the Actor Esteem and Reputation superlative to all the other Players.</Q> This Account makes it plain <HI>Taylor</HI> must be very great in the Part, since <HI>Betterton,</HI> his Imitator, performed it so well. And <HI>Betterton,</HI> in the Memory of many, was
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
esteemed the greatest Actor of his Time. Read what the great <HI>Addison</HI> writes of him, who may be allowed a Judge of the Drama, as well as the Performers.</P>
<Q><P>Such an Actor as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ought to be recorded with the same Respect as <HI>Ro∣scius</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> The greatest Orator <HI>(Tully)</HI> has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <HI>Roscius</HI> was the Example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning Beha∣viour: His Action was so well adapted to the Sentiments he expressed, that the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <HI>Roscius.</HI> The Imagination took a lovely Impression of what was great and good; and they who never thought of setting up for the Art of Imitation, became themselves inimitable Characters. There is no human Invention so aptly calculated for the form∣ing a free-born People, as that of a <HI>Theatre. Tully</HI> reports, that the celebrated <HI>Roscius</HI> used frequently to say, the Perfection of an <HI>Actor</HI> is, only to become what he is doing. I have hardly a Notion, that any Performer of Antiquity could surpass the Action of Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> in any of the Occasions in which he has appeared on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he appeared in, when he examined the Circumstance of the Handkerchief in the Part of <HI>Othello;</HI> the Mixture of Love that intrudes upon his
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
Mind upon the innocent Answers <HI>Desdemona</HI> makes; betrayed in his Gesture such a Va∣riety, and Vicissitude of Passion, as would admonish a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, it is to stab it, to admit that worst of Daggers, <HI>Jealousy.</HI> Whoever reads in his Closet this admirable Scene will find, that he cannot (except he has as warm an Imagination as <HI>Shakespear</HI> himself) find any but dry, in∣coherent, and broken Sentences. But a Reader, that has seen <HI>Betterton</HI> act it, ob∣serves there could not be a Word added; that longer Speeches had been unnatural, nay, impossible, in <HI>Othello</HI>'s Circumstances. Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> the greatest Critic of the Age he lived in, in his Dissertation on Tragedy, speaks thus on Mr. <HI>Hart:</HI></P>
<P>The Eyes of the Audience are prepos∣sessed and charmed by his Action, before ought of the Poet can approach their Ears; and, to the most wretched of Characters, <HI>Hart</HI> gives a Lustre which dazzles the Sight, that the Deformities of the Poet cannot be perceived.</P></Q>
<P>Now, after the Opinions of two such emi∣nent Judges, why may we not suppose there were as great Stage Performers in Times past, as the present, without lessening the Merit of those that survive? If, in my simple Judg∣ment, I allow the present equal to the past, I cannot allow that they exceed them, no more, perhaps, than the next Race of <HI>Theatrical</HI> Per∣formers
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
will excel many that now grace the Stage. Excellency, in this Science, does not always run in the Blood, or, like Estates, fol∣low hereditary. They must be born <HI>Actors,</HI> as well as <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Painters:</HI> Yet there are many Dabblers in all three; but, alas! how few come to Perfection! We very rarely see Brothers or Sisters, Sons or Daughters. or any of the relative Line (though they sometimes take up the Calling, because one of the Race flourishes in the Theatrical Field) succeed in their Attempts. A Monarch may give Rib∣bands, Titles of Honour, or add to his Peers, but no Power but that immortal Goddess <HI>Na∣ture</HI> can form a perfect Actor: Yet some even of these forget their Instructress, and Faults invade them to sully their Perfections. Every Performer on the Stage ought to take Virtue for his Guide. Precepts from the Pulpit will not have all their Efficacy from a <HI>Monitor</HI> without <HI>Morals.</HI> A Discourse on Sobriety, on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> would lose something of its In∣tention from an Orator known to baste the Bottle about all the past <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening till the <HI>Noon of Night,</HI> as <HI>Shakespear</HI> says. The Blind may hear, the Dumb and Deaf see, but every Sense must be perfect to instruct, and be instructed. Performers, of both Sexes, ought to imitate those virtuous Characters they re∣present upon the Stage; the Dignity of the Theatre, then, might emulate that of <HI>Athens.</HI> 'Tis not the Business brings Scandal to the Performers, if they will take care to avoid

drawing it upon themselves. I have known the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and many of the rest of the Fraternity, meet Regard, and even Respect, from Persons of the first Rank, from their proper Behaviour; and I am con∣vinced every one, with the like Conduct would meet with the like Treatment from People of Sense and good Breeding; but the Two-legg'd Brutes of the Creation will be ever incorrigible: A decent Dress will become their Station; but Pride ought to be as far di∣stant from them, as the licensed Instructors of Divine Institution: For if Theatrical Perform∣ers are Servants to the Public (as an eminent Actor publicly declared), they should never attempt to out-dress their Masters. <HI>Veluti in Speculum (behold as in a Glass),</HI> the Motto over the Front of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, will serve both Auditors and Actors; and, I think, carries a more instructive Meaning than the other, of <HI>Vivitur Ingenio (we live by Wit),</HI> which only relates to the Stage. A bad Painter is seldom copy'd, and Excellence is only worth Imitation; Dress beyond Station is Pride, and Pride very often brings Self-punishment. I have known Fidlers and Dancing-masters wear lac'd Cloaths, but they seldom improv'd any thing but the Taylor's Bill, and as much laugh'd at as the Baboon I have often seen in a lac'd Coat and a Bag-wig in the Parade at <HI>Bartholomew-Fair</HI>—Yet I have seen gold Fringe on silk Vests, with white silk Stockens, worn by the Dancers on the Ropes at <HI>Sadlers-Wells,</HI>

that have bow'd and scrap'd in that rich Dress, picking up Halfpence thrown down by <HI>Coblers</HI> and <HI>Link-Boys.</HI> Such Sights put me in mind of the painted Eggs <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">It is the Custom of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> at <HI>Christmas, Easter,</HI> and many other stated Festivals, to send, as a friendly Present to their Acquaintance and Relations, painted Eggs, generally embellish'd with Flowers curi∣ously drawn, Fruits, &amp;c. that are very often so expen∣sive, that the Money laid out for the painting of one would purchase a hundred, as simple Nature produc'd them, and are of no farther Use than to be look'd upon. This Custom is kept up chiefly in the Holidays of <HI>Christ∣mas,</HI> in Commemoration of the <HI>Eastern</HI> wise Men, led by the Star to visit our <HI>Redeemer</HI> in the Manger at <HI>Beth∣lehem,</HI> where they made their Presents to the Divine In∣fant. These Eggs are sometimes eaten in those Days ordained, where Flesh is sorbidden, but not till the Sun is set, or, if no Sun appears, not till Candle-light.</NOTE>of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they don't relish the better for their Colour∣ing, and gaudy Outsides. Even <HI>Roscius</HI> a∣mong the <HI>Romans</HI> (though the Actors did not keep up their Reputations equal to those of <HI>Athens)</HI> was mark'd out as a Pattern for the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> to follow in Decency of Dress, and Morals. <HI>Tully</HI> says, <HI>Cum artifex ejusmodi sit, ut solus dignus videatur esse, qui in scena spectetur; tum vir ejusmodi est, ut solus dignus videatur qui eo non accedat.</HI>—<Q>So excel∣lent an Artist, that he seem'd the only Per∣son to adorn the Stage; and yet, in all other respects, so complete in every Grace and Virtue, that he seem'd the only Person that should not take up with such a Profession.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35"/>
Moral Virtue, and a decent Behaviour, will gain Esteem from People of every Rank, will add Weight to the Characters they represent, and even may atone for want of Excellency.</P>
<P>Lessons for the Stage may be convey'd, in one respect, stronger than from the Pulpit, if the Audience were attentive as they should be at Church: For a Play well wrote, and well perform'd, where Virtue suffers, or meets its just Reward, must have strong Force upon the Mind, where the Eye is suppos'd to view the very Persons in the real Circumstances of Histo∣ry. What then will add to this Imagination? Why, the Performers to be as blameless as hu∣man Nature will allow. I remember a virtuous Actress (or one reputed so) repeating two Lines in King <HI>Lear,</HI> at her Exit in the Third Act,
<Q><L>Arm'd in my <HI>Virgin Innocence</HI> I'll fly,</L>
<L>My Royal Father to relieve, or die,</L></Q>
receive a Plaudit from the Audience, more as a Reward for her reputable Character, than, perhaps, her Acting claim'd; when a different <HI>Actress</HI> in the same Part, more fam'd for her Stage-Performance than the other, at the Words <HI>Virgin Innocence,</HI> has created a Horse∣laugh (no Reflection on the Audience, since a Theatrical Term), and the Scene of generous Pity and Compassion at the Close turn'd to Ri∣dicule. Here the Audience are disconcerted, and the Reality of the Subject before them loses much of its Force, with the Imagination
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
debilitated, if not turn'd another Way. On the other hand, indeed, if a Person who acts <HI>Iago,</HI> be suspected to wear a Heart that way inclin'd, he appears stronger in <HI>that</HI> Character, and meets with an Applause that condemns him. We may find, by these Examples, Vir∣tue is of some Use upon the Stage, and would be more so, if more practis'd. To give In∣structions to an Actor, is a very difficult Task; for if much is wanting, it is not worth while to give any. A rough Diamond may be polish'd, but few Pebbles are worth cutting. After ma∣ny Requisites for the Stage, bad Action will even cause a good Figure to appear aukward; and tho' there may be Rules for Action, yet Nature is the best Teacher; and if an Actor of good Understanding is truly possessed with his Character, the true Action will involunta∣rily occur. I remember Mrs. <HI>Porter,</HI> to whom Nature had been niggard in Voice and Face, so great in many Parts, as Lady <HI>Macbeth, Alicia</HI> in <HI>Jane Shore, Hermione</HI> in the <HI>Distrest Mother,</HI> and many Parts of the Kind, that her just Action, Eloquence of Look and Gesture, mov'd Astonishment! and yet I have heard her declare, she left the Action to the Posses∣sion of the Sentiments in the Part she per∣form'd. I have known some tolerable Actors, as to Countenance and Elocution, that have mortify'd both by the Badness of Action, more especially the proper Use of their Hands: Had they worn each in a Scarf, they had been much more tolerable, as it is the most expres∣sive
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
Part in the Action of the Body, so as <HI>Shakespear</HI> says, <HI>like an ill-sheath'd Knife, it will most hurt its Master.</HI> I think <HI>Quintilian</HI> says, all the Parts of the Body assist the Speaker; but the Hands speak without a Tongue, supplicate, threaten, call, dismiss, provoke, shew every Passion of the Soul. The Hands are the ge∣neral Language of Mankind, and we need no Grammar but Nature to understand it. So by their aukward Use upon the Stage, we may turn the Serious into Ridicule. Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> would often regret the want of Opportunity for an Actor to continue in a graceful Attitude, which <HI>Nicolini</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Singer was so ma∣sterly familiar with, between the <HI>Retornels</HI> of a Song, and other Occasions: Yet when Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had the least Opportunity, he shew'd he only wanted it. I remember in the 5th Act of <HI>Othello,</HI> while he is listening to <HI>Emilia</HI>'s speak∣ing to <HI>Desdemona,</HI> after she is suppos'd to be strangled, he suited his Attitude and Coun∣tenance to the Circumstances of the Scene, that I have not Art to describe, but the treble re∣peated Applauses of the Audience, while he was silent, spoke such high Approbation, that Miss <HI>Santlow</HI> (afterwards Mrs. <HI>Booth)</HI> us'd to say, <HI>She thought the Audience were pleas'd poor</HI> Desdemona <HI>was strangled out of the Way</HI></P>
<P>Of all the various Passions of Grief, a manly Sorrow is the most difficult to express. And of all the Actors I have ever yet seen, I must be pardon'd if I give the Preference to
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
Mr. <HI>Wilks.</HI> No Heart, that was capable of being touch'd, but must have sympathiz'd at his Manner of speaking one Line in the <HI>Orphan</HI> to <HI>Monimia,</HI> in the Fifth Act.</P>
<P><Q><L>My fatal Love, alas! has ruin'd thee!</L></Q>
And yet I have heard it spoke when it has given me no more Concern, than if a Voice had pierced my Ear with
<Q><L>Kettles or Pots to mend! Old Brass to mend!</L></Q>
If moving the Passions is a great Art in Acting, I think Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was Master of that Art. There was no avoiding feeling <HI>his</HI> Distress in another Line, when he performed the Part of the <HI>Royal Merchant</HI> in the <HI>Beggars Bush,</HI> a Comedy of <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s. The Character is noted for beneficent Charity; and, when his flinty∣hearted Creditors had just press'd him for Pay∣ment, <HI>Clause</HI> his old Beadsman (tho' his Fa∣ther in Disguise) comes as if to beg his usual Charity, when the Merchant replies with such a Tone that sinks into the Soul:</P>
<P><HI>Clause,</HI> I pray thee leave me; for, by my Troth, I have nothing now to give thee.</P>
<P>Comparison is the true Touchstone of Excel∣lence, and brighten'd Brass by a false Light might be taken for Gold, if not try'd.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39"/>
In the 4th Act of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> when he is told by <HI>Lenox</HI> of the Loss of his Wife and Children, his Mixture of Sorrow and manly Grief at
<Q><L>He has no Children! Butcher! If he had,</L>
<L>The Thought of them would sure have stirr'd Remorse!</L></Q>
drew Tears from almost every Eye, when if he had blubber'd like a School-boy whipt, the touching Scene would have rais'd Laughter, in the place of Grief. And yet some particular People will not allow Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Excellence to stand in Tragedy. If, indeed, he had attempted the Parts of <HI>Cato, Lear, Macbeth, Henry</HI> the VIIIth, <HI>Melantius,</HI> and a countless Catalogue of others in the same Class, I might have join'd in their Opinion; but while there is a <HI>Juba,</HI> an <HI>Edgar, Macduff, Buckingham,</HI> and <HI>Amin∣tor,</HI> in the same Plays, I don't desire to see a better Performer in that Cast of Playing than Mr. <HI>Wilks:</HI> In <HI>Hamlet</HI> he pleas'd all the Au∣dience; and if the best Judges laugh'd at his Parts in Comedy, I can't conceive they have shed more Tears since his much-lamented Death, at any of the above-mentioned Plays. I remember a few Years ago a Dispute a∣rose between Two Theatrical Gentlemen upon <HI>this</HI> Stage, concerning the Propriety of a par∣ticular Speech; the one, to enforce his Argu∣ment, told the other, he never heard it spoke otherwise on the <HI>English</HI> Stage. <HI>Pho,</HI> reply'd the other Disputant, <HI>that was the old Way of</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
<HI>Acting</HI>! A truly great Actor, that stood by, reply'd, <HI>Learn the old Way first, and when you are perfect, then begin a new one, if you can find it out: Art may invent Fashions in our Dress; but Nature is the same as the Habits of the</HI> Turks, <HI>which they have never yet alter'd.</HI> The Cloaths of the first <HI>Ottoman</HI> Prince is the Model of the Emperor that now reigns, and, as the divine <HI>Pope</HI> paints the unalterable Goddess,</P>
<LG>
<L>Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,</L>
<L>One clear, unchang'd, and universal Light;</L>
<L>Life, Force, and Beauty, must to all impart,</L>
<L>At once, the Source, and End, and Test of Art.</L>

<P>I have known many Actors with excellent Voices; so I have often known common Bal∣lad-singers in the Streets with strong Lungs and Voices; but, for want of a Manner with Judgment, murder an excellent Song, and yet extort Praise from their Auditors. A Sow∣gelder's Horn will pierce the Ear, and alarm all the Dogs in the Parish; but I believe most People would rather hear a Trumpet. The Voice, like an Instrument of Music, must be put in Tune, and, if managed by a skilful Actor, whose Mind feels the Passions, will send out the proper Tone, when a Bungler in Music does but harshly grate upon the Ear. But who is ignorant of this? If this is the Disease of the Stage, where is the Remedy? It must cer∣tainly be in the Hands of the Manager, tho' no very easy Task. The Circumstances of a
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
Theatre very often oblige the Directors to thrust Persons into Characters too weak to sup∣port the Weight of them: Vanity is blended in most human Compositions, and the Stage is seldom free from it; therefore, when an Actor is once in Possession of a Part (Male or Female), they think it a very great Hardship to give it up to a better Performer. There are a much larger Number of common Soldiers in an Army than commanding Officers, and we have some few Instances of a Soldier rising to Preferment by Merit, whilst others grow grey with a Mus∣quet upon their Shoulders; and yet, at some Time or other, a Soldier may do the Duty of a Corporal, if he is indisposed, or out of the Way: But that Exigence does not give him a Title to the Post. I remember an Actor was taken into the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for playing the Part of <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> in a private Play; and when Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> was studying the Part, he thought it the greatest Oppression (as he call'd it) that could be thrown upon him: Nay, after Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had perform'd the Part, with universal Applause, several successive Nights, this Person said, nay, bound it with an Oath, that <HI>Booth did not know how to speak a single Line:</HI> Yet this Person was a Man of Sense and Learning. But there are more Requisites to make a fi∣nish'd Actor: Therefore, as they do not al∣ways judge candidly for themselves, it is requi∣site they should have one of unbyass'd and su∣perior Knowledge to judge for them. When such Actors above-mention'd take Parts, as they
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
thrust themselves into for their Benefits, as is too often the Case (and I think ought not to be al∣low'd), it proves, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> says,</P>
<LG>
<L>—Like a Player,</L>
<L>Bellowing his Passion, till he break the Spring,</L>
<L>And his rack'd Voice jar to the Audience.</L>
</LG>
<P>There are too many Performers, of both Sexes, that are fond of choosing capital Parts for their Benefits, that sit upon them
<Q><L>—Like a Giant's Robe</L>
<L>Upon a dwarfish Thief:</L></Q>
And, at the same Time, excuse themselves from Rehearsals (that should prepare them to act with some Decency, at least), to cultivate their Interest; and, when they come to perform at Night, only take Shame to themselves, tho' they oft disconcert others; and may truly say,</P>
<LG>
<L>Like a dull Actor, now I have forgot</L>
<L>My Part, and stop ev'n to a full Disgrace.</L>
<L>That's villainous, and shews a most pitiful Ambi∣tion in the Fool that uses it. <BIBL>SHAK.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>The noble Gift, of Playing well, is not given to all that play: Yet as, in building of Houses, there must be provided many Hands, even to the carrying the Morter; a <HI>Morter-carrier</HI> must be had, as well as the rest of the Hands in the Work: All are not equal to every Part in the Building, no more than every Actor is fit for
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
every Part. If they attempt to wade out of their Depths, they are in great Danger of drowning; and, as our immortal Poet writes,</P>
<LG>
<L>As in a Theatre the Eyes of Men,</L>
<L>After a well-grac'd Actor leaves the Stage,</L>
<L>Are idly bent on him that enters next;</L>
<L>Will think his Prattle to be tedious.</L>
</LG>
<P>Yet I have known many Persons belonging to a Theatre, not eminent in any superior Part, ne∣ver offend, through their private Characters in Life. A modest Behaviour is commendable in every Station, but much more observed in Per∣sons of a public Profession, where the Eyes of Thousands are upon them. Confidence, Pride, and Vanity, will draw down Contempt and Ri∣dicule from Superiours, with Disregard from all.</P>
<LG>
<L>Of all the Causes which conspire to blind</L>
<L>Man's erring Judgment, and misguide the Mind;</L>
<L>What the weak Heart, with strongest Byass, rules,</L>
<L>Is Pride, the never-failing Vice of Fools. <BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>Humility, Affability, and Good-nature, will claim Regard from all Ranks; and if any Stains are thrown upon the Profession, such Qualifica∣tions will wipe them off: Yet I think there are no Spots but what they themselves throw upon it. We are apt, even in strange Company, to out with some Theatrical Quotation, that sel∣dom fails of declaring what Business we follow. What need a <HI>Taylor</HI> talk of his <HI>Yard</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
<HI>Sheers,</HI> a <HI>Smith</HI> of his <HI>Forge,</HI> or a <HI>Brewer</HI> of his <HI>Grains?</HI> Let the <HI>Buskin</HI> and <HI>Sock</HI> be left in the Theatre. I know an eminent Actor, in∣vited to dine in a mix'd Company of both Sexes, of Condition: When the Dinner seem'd a little tedious, before it made its Entrance, a Gentleman, one of the Invited, starts up, and cry'd, <HI>Zounds, Mr.—, give us the</HI> Ghost <HI>in</HI> Hamlet, <HI>by way of Grace</HI>! The Master of the House reply'd, there was no Meat he could give him was worth one Speech; besides, <HI>he did not invite Mr.—to pay for his Dinner that Way. It was only in Retaliation for the Supper he gave him the Night before, on the Stage, where no Cook but himself could dress such a Dish of black Broth</HI> (meaning <HI>Othello). So, by your Rule of Courtesy, if I had invited</HI> Fausan, <HI>I should have desired him to dance the</HI> Buffoon <HI>before Dinner.</HI> This was the Height of Civility to one, and a sufficient Rebuke to the other. The Fop (for he was no less), to plead his Excuse, told the Company, he had been many Times with several Actors, who took as much Plea∣sure to speak Speeches, as he to hear them; and he did not doubt but they were People of great Judgment; for they generally own'd, other Performers did not act so well as them∣selves. <HI>Yes,</HI> reply'd the Master of the House, <HI>Self-praise is always to be believed; yet I have known a Sign-painter criticize upon</HI> Raphael. Wit will be often entertaining, but a small Por∣tion of one's own (if we had it) is better than a Cart-load of other Peoples: Yet Quotations
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
from the <HI>Drama</HI> may shew some Judgment, when properly apply'd, and not too often. The Author of a Comedy, call'd <HI>The Play's the Plot,</HI> shews the Strolling Players, not im∣properly, by their Style.</P>
<P>It is something surprising to me, that where Vice, in every Shape, with Folly, is expos'd daily to their View, Performers on the Stage should have any Faults, or, at least, Art enough to disguise them so well, that few should find them out. To hide the Passions Nature has sown in the Seeds of the human Race, will prevent their Growth, and, in Time, destroy them. May we not learn Virtue, and avoid Vice, by the instructive Lessons of the Drama? What premeditated Murderer would not feel Com∣punction, or, perhaps, Repentance, at the Speech of <HI>Torrismond</HI> to the <HI>Queen</HI> in the <HI>Spa∣nish Fryar,</HI> when she has given Commission to the Murder of the good <HI>King Sancho?</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Think, timely think, on the last dreadful Day!</L>
<L>How will you tremble there to stand expos'd,</L>
<L>And foremost in the Rank of guilty Ghosts,</L>
<L>That must be doom'd for Murder! Think on Murder!</L>
<L>That Troop is plac'd apart from common Crimes:</L>
<L>The Damn'd themselves start wide, and shun that Band,</L>
<L>As far more black, and more forlorn, than they.</L>

<P>The Queen's Answer.</P>

We might go through the sacred <HI>Decalogue,</HI> with the Assistance of those Flowers in the spa∣cious Fields of Poetry.</P>
<P><Q>The Stage (says the <HI>Female Spectator),</HI> by its Institution, is the School of Virtue, and the Scourge of Vice; and when either of these noble Purposes is defeated, it is no Wonder that Persons of true Sense and Honour choose to absent themselves, and oblige their Fami∣lies to do so too.</Q> So reasonable an Enter∣tainment, as the Drama in its Purity, must be, in some sort, a Promoter to Virtue; therefore every Manager of a Theatre should make it his Study to exhibit no other Pieces but what aim to that End; and, by Degrees, throw off the looser Drama, and constitute, in its place, those that the wisest, and most virtuous, need not be asham'd to partake of the innocent Amuse∣ment. I do not pretend to set up for a Monitor; but every Stage Performer would find his Ac∣count in reforming the Stage, as well as them∣selves. I do not mean this Admonition to any particular Theatre, but all in general, at Home and Abroad; for our Plantations in <HI>America</HI> have been voluntarily visited by some Itine∣rants; <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in particular. I had an Ac∣count, from a Gentleman who was possess'd of a large Estate in the Island, that a Company, in the Year 1733. came there, and clear'd a large Sum of Money; where they might have made moderate Fortunes, if they had not been too busy with the Growth of the Country. They receiv'd 370 Pistoles the first Night, to
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
the <HI>Beggars Opera;</HI> but within the Space of two Months they bury'd their third <HI>Polly,</HI> and two of their Men. The Gentlemen of the Island, for some Time, took their Turns upon the Stage, to keep up the Diversion; but this did not hold long; for, in two Months more, there were but one old Man, a Boy, and a Woman of the Company, left: The rest died, either with the Country-Distemper <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">The Country Distempers are, the Dry-gripes, and <HI>Tenesmus,</HI> which generally ends in a Sanguinary Flux: Most New-comers, for want of a proper Regimen, fall into it. The Dry-gripes brings a final Dissolution in two Days, if no Remedy keeps it back. The other Dis∣temper, indeed, is slower in its Execution and Cure. Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> tells us, the Badness of the Water contri∣buted to all these Distempers, which is brackish near the Sea-coasts: But swallowing large Draughts of Rum Punch, with the fatal Dew that falls in the Night, when the Body is carelesly exposed, heated with drinking, is the chief Cause. Place any woollen Garment expos'd to the noxious Vapours of the Night, and it will imbibe double its Weight of Dew before Sun-rise. Those that escape the Seasoning, as they term it, seldom feel the fatal Ef∣fects of it afterwards. This is more dangerous on the Sea-coasts of the Island; the mid Parts are much more salubrious, both as to Air and Water.</NOTE>, or the common Beve∣rage of the Place, the noble Spirit of Rum∣punch, which is generally fatal to New-comers. The shatter'd Remains, with upwards of 2000 Pistoles in Bank, embark'd for <HI>Carolina,</HI> to join another Company at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> but were cast away in the Voyage. Had the Company been more blest with the Virtue of Sobriety, &amp;c. they might, perhaps, have liv'd to carry home the Liberality of those generous Islanders.</P>

Even the Wicked have some Regard to Vir∣tue, are often aw'd by Persons that are reputed to wear that amiable Character. Persons on the Stage, which is too liable to Insults, escape them there, unless, as in a Crowd of Quarrel∣lers, where a Looker on may meet with an ac∣cidental Stroke. But these Theatrical Squabbles are too often ungenerous from the Audience, or, I should say, from a small Part of the Au∣dience; for a Dozen, when they are pleas'd to take it into their Heads, shall disturb the Whole, and disconcert the best Actors in the World. Is not this a gross Affront upon the rest? What Right have I to rob my Neigh∣bour of his Money, and Satisfaction? He pays the Price to be entertain'd for two or three Hours, and, perhaps, would be as well con∣tented with a well-acted Play, as a Dinner. Now, if I should come to you, Sir, be you who you will, while you are sat down to your Meal at a Tavern, turn the Drawers down Stairs, throw your Provision about, prevent your eat∣ing your Dinner with any Satisfaction; I should think you a very good-natur'd Gentleman, if you only thrust me out of your Room; because I should imagine I deserv'd worse Treatment.</P>
<P>I remember, above twenty Years past, I was one of the Audience, at a new Play: Before me sat a Sea-Officer, with whom I had some Acquaintance; on each Hand of him a Couple of Sparks, both prepar'd with their offensive Instruments vulgarly term'd <HI>Cat-calls,</HI> which they were often tuning, before the Play began.

The Officer did not take any Notice of them till the Curtain drew up; but when they conti∣nued their Sow-gelder's Music (as he unpolitely call'd it), he beg'd they would not prevent his hearing the Actors, tho' they might not care whether they heard, or no; but they took little Notice of his civil Request, which he repeated again and again, to no Purpose: But, at last, one of them condescended to tell him, <HI>If he did not like it, he might let it alone. Why, really,</HI> reply'd the Sailor, <HI>I do not like it, and would have you let your Noise alone; I have paid my Money to see and hear the Play, and your ridiculous Noise not only hinders me, but a great many other People that are here, I believe, with the same Design: Now if you prevent us, you rob us of our Money, and our Time; there∣fore I intreat you, as you look like Gentlemen, to behave as such.</HI> One of them seem'd mollified, and put his Whistle in his Pocket; but the other was incorrigible. The blunt <HI>Tar</HI> made him one Speech more. <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>I advise you, once more, to follow the Example of this Gen∣tleman, and put up your Pipe.</HI> But the <HI>Piper</HI> sneer'd in his Face, and clap'd his troublesome Instrument to his Mouth, with Cheeks swell'd out like a Trumpeter, to give it a redoubled, and louder Noise; but, like the broken Crow of a Cock in a Fright, the Squeak was stopt in the Middle by a Blow from the Officer, which he gave him with so strong a Will, that his Child's Trumpet was struck thro' his Cheek,

and his Companion led him out to a Surgeon; so that we had more Room, and less Noise; and not one that saw or heard the Affair, but what were well pleased with his Treatment; and, notwithstanding his great Blustering, he never thought it worth his while to call upon the Officer, tho' he knew where to find him. It is certainly a Mark of Cowardice to insult in public Company, or strike a Man who has his Hands bound; and yet I have known a poor Actor pelted by Puppies, that would run away at the Sight of a Stage-Foil, that has neither Edge or Point.</P>

<P><HI>Actors</HI> in <HI>France</HI> meet with Respect (I mean if they will endeavour to deserve it, which in my Opinion they may easily do); and are ac∣ceptable in the Company of Rank and Figure in that polite Nation; and tho' the Clergy scrupled to give <HI>Moliere</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moliere,</HI> the great Comic Poet of <HI>France,</HI> was es∣teem'd an excellent Actor.

The Archbishop of <HI>Paris</HI> would not allow his Body to be in∣hum'd in consecrated Ground, which the King being informed of, sent for the Archbishop, and expostulated with him; but he was an obstinate Churchman, and would not willingly condescend to his Majesty's Persua∣sions. The King, finding him unwilling to comply, de∣sired to know how many Feet deep the Holy Ground reach'd? The Bishop reply'd, <HI>About eight. Well,</HI> re∣ply'd the King, <HI>I find there is no getting the better of your Scruples; therefore let his Grave be dug twelve Feet, that's four below your consecrated Ground, and let them bury him there.</HI> The Archbishop was obliged to comply; for <HI>Lewis the XIVth</HI> would be obey'd. <HI>Moliere</HI> left be∣hind him thirty-two Dramatic Pieces, which are held by the <HI>French</HI> in the highest Esteem.

This Dramatic Piece was ac∣counted the best of its Kind at the Time it was wrote; it was first published under the Title of <HI>Ferrex</HI> and <HI>Porrex</HI> in 1582. and 1590. reprinted under the Title of <HI>Gorbo∣duc.</HI> This was a favourite Play of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s, as may be supposed by her seeing it twice acted; first, by the Gentlemen of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI> and afterwards by the Children of her Majesty's Revels. Mr. <HI>Spence,</HI> Pro∣fessor of Poetry in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> has reprint∣ed this Play about nine Years ago, and dedicated it to the Earl of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> Son to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Dorset,</HI> descended from this Author.</NOTE>Gorboduc <HI>done at the Castle, one-and-twenty Shillings and two Groats.</HI> But it is to be sup∣posed they were Gentlemen of the Court that were the Actors on this Occasion.</P>

Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and I believe the first that wore the last Title. This Theatre was built by his Directions in <HI>Warberg-Street,</HI> where the Company continued to act, till the unhap∣py Rebellion broke out in the Year 1641 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry Burnel,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Gentleman of <HI>Ireland,</HI> wrote a Play call'd <HI>Landgartha,</HI> a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the New <HI>Theatre</HI> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> 1641. with very great Applause (so says the Title); but there are no Actors Names print∣ed in the <HI>Drama.</HI> The Prologue was spoken by an <HI>Ama∣zon,</HI> arm'd with a Battle-ax, to bespeak the Favour of the Audience. The Plot is taken from the <HI>Danish</HI> History of <HI>Saxo Grammaticus.</HI> This Play was the last that was performed on the Theatre in <HI>Warberg-street</HI> before the Rebellion broke out, which was discovered by Mr. <HI>Owen O Connolly</HI> but the Night before the Execution, which prevented the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> being seiz'd on the 22d of <HI>October</HI> 1641. as intended; but it was too late to give Notice to the rest of the Kingdom, which felt the fatal Effect of the Rebellion.</NOTE>. The Theatre was then shut up, by Order of the Lords Justices, sign'd <HI>William Parsons,</HI> and <HI>John Borlace.</HI> We do not find any mention of a <HI>Theatre</HI> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> till the Year after the Restoration 1661. which was built on the Spot where the Theatre now stands in <HI>Orange-street,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Smock-alley;</HI> how it came by the last Name, may be easily guess'd.</P>

but neither of them play'd in <HI>England,</HI> till af∣ter her Death, which fell out in the Year 1664. in the 31st Year of her Age, of the Small-Pox.

<P>The Theatre in <HI>Smock-Alley</HI> was so badly built, that in the Year 1671. some Part of it sell down, when two were kill'd, and several sorely maimed.

Distinguished Characters in Bills were not in Fashion, at the Time these Plays were per∣form'd; they were printed in Order according to the Drama as they stood, not regarding the Merit of the Actor. As for Example, in <HI>Mac∣beth, Duncan</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> appear'd first in the Bill, tho' acted by an insignificant Person; and so every other Actor appear'd according to his Dramatic Dignity, all of the same-siz'd Letter. But latterly, I can assure my Readers, I have found it a difficult Task to please some <HI>Ladies,</HI> as well as <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> because I could not find Letters large enough to please them; and some were so very fond of Elbow-room, that they would have shoved every body out but themselves, as if one Person was to do all, and have the Merit of all, like Generals of an Ar∣my; such a Victory was gained by such a King, and such a Prince, while the other Offi∣cers and Soldiers are forgot. But as <HI>Trim</HI> tells us in the <HI>Funeral,</HI> or, <HI>Grief A-la-mode,</HI> 50,000 <HI>of such Rascals as these will make an</HI> Alexander.

<P>In the Year 1732. a Theatrical Booth was erected by Mrs. <HI>Violante</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Lady, cele∣brated for Strength and Agility, a Qualifica∣tion

that does not render the Fair-Sex the least more amiable; the Strength of the Limbs, which these Sort of Undertakers expose, in my Opinion, is shockingly indecent; but hers were masculinely indelicate, and were of a Piece with the Features of her Face. I am informed, the shewing her Limbs did not meet with the Suc∣cess in this Kingdom, as she had found in her elder Sister, <HI>England;</HI> that Lady's Children delight in such Entertainments: Bull-baiting, Boxing, Bear-garden, and Prize-fighting, will draw to them all Ranks of People, from the Peer to the Pedlar: Our late <HI>English</HI> Gladiator, Mr. <HI>Figg,</HI> of Cutting-slashing Memory, made much private Emolument by his public Va∣lour, more especially in Linen <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Figg</HI> informed me once, that he had not bought a Shirt for more than twenty Years, but had sold some Dozens. It was his Method, when he fought in his Amphitheatre (his Stage bearing that superb Title); he sent round to a select Number of his Scholars to bor∣row a Shirt for the ensuing Combat, and seldom failed of half a dozen of superfine Holland from his prime Pupils (most of the young Nobility and Gentry made it Part of their Education to march under his warlike Banner). This Champion was generally Conqueror, tho' his Shirt seldom failed of gaining a Cut from his Enemy, and sometimes his Flesh, tho' I think he never receiv'd any dangerous Wound. Most of his Scholars were at every Battle, and were sure to exult at their great Master's Victories, every Person supposing he saw the Wounds his Shirt received. Mr. <HI>Figg</HI> took his Opportunity to inform his Lenders of Linen, of the Chasms their Shirts received, with a Promise to send them home. <HI>But,</HI> said the ingenious, courageous <HI>Figg, I seldom received any other Answer, than, Damn you, keep it.</HI> I shall not enter into the Merits of this Method in pro∣curing Linen; but, if it was a Fraud (as he told me), he was never found Guilty.

But to Mademoiselle <HI>Violante.</HI> She, finding her Tumbling tiresome, fell into Playing and <HI>Pan∣tomime</HI> (another Disgrace to the Drama). Mr. <HI>Barrington,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Morris,</HI> and, I think, Mr. <HI>Beamsly,</HI> Miss <HI>Woffington,</HI> Miss <HI>Mackay</HI> (now Mrs. <HI>Mitchel),</HI> and many others, came under her Directions, and play'd several Dramatic Pieces with Grotesque Entertainments, till stopt by the Lord Mayor of the City of <HI>Dublin;</HI> Mrs. <HI>Violante</HI> having no Sanction, or proper Au∣thority, to exhibit such Entertainments. The <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">It is now an Hospital for indigent <HI>Lying-in Women,</HI> which is a generous, virtuous, and humane Charity, worthy the Imitation of every civilized Nation. The Director and Inventor of this useful Institution ought to be mentioned with great Respect. How many Subjects have been lost, for want of such a noble Charity! The Hospital was opened in <HI>March</HI> 1745. and, by the First of <HI>November</HI> 1747. there were 514 poor Women safely de∣livered of 281 Boys, and 241 Girls; 13 Women bearing Twins; the eminent Dr. <HI>Mosse</HI> (the first Promoter of this charitable Work) giving Attendance without Fee or Reward. I wish <HI>Iberia</HI>'s Elder Sister would follow the Example. 'Tis true, there are such in <HI>China,</HI> but not under such Regulation; the Women there are not receiv'd, till the Pangs of Child-birth attack them, ac∣cording to <HI>Mendez Pinto;</HI> and several Mothers, with their Infants, perish, before they can be conveyed to the Ho∣spital. In <HI>Paris</HI> there is one of this Kind; but the Wo∣men after the Month, if able, are obliged to attend those that lie in, and cannot be free of the Place till their Turn comes on, which must be one Month, at least: For, as I am informed, they are Nurses to each other. <HI>Rome,</HI> that has Hospitals almost without Number, has none such, tho' they have one for repenting Courtezans.

I shall take Leave of <HI>Violante,</HI> and her Po∣stures, and give it, as my own Opinion, that I think such Diversions are below the Dignity of the Stage, or Humanity. Where can be the Satisfaction, when Death and Danger attend it? I have the Fate of Lady <HI>Isabella</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The Lady <HI>Isabella</HI> was born in <HI>Italy,</HI> sprung from a noble Family in the City of <HI>Florence:</HI> She was put into a Nunnery at twelve Years of Age, in order to take the Veil; but a Posture-master unluckily came to that City, gained her Affections, and found Means to carry her off, and marry'd her; instructed her in his unseemly, dangerous Employment (if we may call it so), and brought her to <HI>England;</HI> where Lady <HI>Isabella</HI> was greatly admir'd, for her Postures, and Feats of Activity. The last, and fatal, Time of her Performance, she was eight Months gone with Child; but the covetous Husband loved Money so well (as it is reported), that he would not allow her the necessary Repose required in her Con∣dition; so that, in one of her Dances on a slack Rope, she fell on the Stage, where the Mother and Infant, newly born with the Force of the Fall, expired in a Moment, fatal Catastrophe! in the Twenty-first Year of her Age.

Lovers of the Drama could play Heroes and Heroines, without eating; Love for the Sub∣lime was enough for them: However, other People did not relish this Cameleon Diet, and hunger'd after something more substantial; therefore resolved upon Benefits, and gave the first to Miss <HI>Mackay,</HI> in order to break the Ice. The <HI>Fop's Fortune</HI> was the Play, and she then being a young promising Actress, several La∣dies, of the first Rank, espous'd her Cause, and brought upwards of Forty Pounds to her Benefit.

I never saw this <HI>Theatre,</HI> but have been in∣form'd, it was a very neat, compact Building, capable of containing an hundred Pounds, at common Prices, which they never raised, but at Benefits.</P>
<P>The Company performed here above a Year with tolerable Success, sometimes Neap, and sometimes Spring-tides; but when <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, with the pompous Coronation, was exhibited at the Theatre in <HI>Aungier-street,</HI> they were almost forsaken; good Sense with Shew, for once prevailed, which is not always the Case.</P>
<P>As Poverty is the Mother of Invention, all the Wit of the Company went to work, and, at last, produced a <HI>Mock</HI> Coronation, with less Expence than a Lady's Tail at <HI>Aungier-street Theatre.</HI> It was called the <HI>Beggars Coronation</HI> (and not unworthy that Title), in the Play of <HI>The Royal Merchant,</HI> or <HI>The Beggars Bush;</HI> with the following <HI>Prologue,</HI> on the solemn Occasion, ushered in by this Preamble, in Print:</P>
<P><HI>APROLOGUE</HI> spoke at <HI>Ransford-street</HI> Playhouse, on the Revival of <HI>The Royal Merchant,</HI> or <HI>The Beggars Bush;</HI> which was acted with the <HI>Mock Coronation,</HI> on the playing King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>VIII</HI>th and Coro∣nation in <HI>Aungier-street</HI> Playhouse.</P>
<LG>

<L><PB N="67" REF="74"/>
Here, then, you come, unwilling to be pleas'd,</L>
<L>Longer than just your dazzled Sight is eas'd.</L>
<L>The Sun, 'tis true, will dim the strongest Eye;</L>
<L>And Darkness, only, can new Force supply—</L>
<L>Yet you must own, that, had no Shew been there,</L>
<L>You'd been content to kill an Ev'ning here.</L>
<L>The <HI>Coronation</HI> made so great a Noise,</L>
<L>Had there been none, <HI>Harry</HI> had miss'd your Voice;</L>
<L>Buffoon—Jack-pudding—Jobson—Hob, <HI>con∣spir'd,</HI></L>
<L>In vain, to make the burlesque King admir'd.</L>
<L>He play'd it, tho', some say, with wond'rous Art!</L>
<L>His Belly—shook; and—that was all the Part.</L>

<Q><L>Yet, faith, 'tis odd—But we surprise you more</L>

<L>Tho' Tyrants threaten, and proud Churchmen frown!</L>
<L>Each willing Subject his small Tribute brings,</L>

<L><HI>Henry</HI>'s a Slave to Tyrants great as he.</L>

<L>They mourn in Pomp, and starve in pageant State.</L>
<L>Like petty Kings, who <HI>Rome</HI>'s Subjection own;</L>
<L>To feed its Pride, they hunger on a Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any here, with indigested Rage,</L>
<L>Will speak malignly of our sporting Stage,</L>
<L>As if, in Ridicule of Rites so known,</L>
<L>Sacred to <HI>Britain</HI>'s Fame, and <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Crown,</L>
<L>We thus our Mockery of State pursue,</L>
<L>Let others our Design with Candour view,</L>

And own, if any Disrespect appears,</L>
<L>'Tis them we mock; be, then, the Censure theirs.</L>

<P>As the World is fond of Novelty (and this Mock Coronation appearing new), the Stream of Success flowed upon them with a rapid Tor∣rent, swelled their Pockets till they overflow'd their Banks, and water'd the Fields of many a Publican! Debts were cleared, and every single Person might, fearless, look at the Dial on the <HI>Tholsel.</HI></P>
<P>Their Success went even beyond their Hopes, and <HI>Aungier-street</HI> suffered short Allowance (as they say at Sea), because the Current was turn'd another Way: Yet I find, by this Success, all do not think alike.</P>
<P><HI>King Henry the Eighth,</HI> with the Coronation, in the utmost Magnificence, was performed in the Year of his present Majesty's Accession to the Throne, at the Theatre Royal in <HI>Drury∣lane, London:</HI> The Success <HI>there</HI> was beyond the Bounds of Expectation; it was even added to every Play, as a <HI>Pantomime,</HI> &amp;c. and exhi∣bited, that one Season, 75 Times.</P>
<P>The Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</HI> got up a <HI>Mock Coronation,</HI> as a Burlesque upon that in <HI>Drury lane;</HI> but the Audience took a different Turn to that in <HI>Ransford-street;</HI> for the poor Mock Peers and Magistrates were pelted off the Stage, in the utmost Contempt, and all their Study and Labour came to nothing.</P>
<P>However, this <HI>Mock Coronation</HI> fill'd <HI>Rans∣ford-street</HI> Theatre, seventeen succeeding Nights:
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
But as Mountain-rivers soon overflow, they as soon sink, and rest in their natural Bed again: <HI>Ransford-street</HI> was too far out of the Way; therefore the Company, after three Years Occu∣pation, forsook it. However, I shall subjoin a Couple of poetical Pieces of Poetry, occasioned by the above <HI>Prologue:</HI> Wits are a Tribe like <HI>Jews,</HI> and one Production begets another. As every Line of Battle Ship has its own <HI>Chaplain,</HI> so every Theatre have their own <HI>Poets;</HI> and sometimes, like <HI>Ragotin</HI> in <HI>Scarron,</HI> they may be found in itinerant Troops. The opponent Theatre produced one, spoken by Mrs. <HI>Bellamy</HI> in Boy's Cloaths, at a Time when an epidemic Cold had reigned greatly in Town.</P>
<LG>
<L>Dear Ladies, may I perish, but I'm proud</L>
<L>To find you all recover'd, and so loud.</L>
<L>Not one sore Throat amongst you now remains,</L>
<L>Of that vile Cold of which the Town complains:</L>
<L>And, faith, you'll answer for me, I'm sincere,</L>
<L>When I profess I'm glad to see you here!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I found a Female Habit would not do,</L>
<L>And therefore try'd a Pair of Breeches too:</L>
<L>A spruce young Blade, well made, with such Ad∣dress,</L>
<L>Among you <HI>Belles</HI> may speak with some Success—</L>
<L>And I, who am a Woman—to my Cost,</L>
<L>Know, by myself, what please the Ladies most—</L>
<L>In vain we strive our Merit <HI>here</HI> to show,</L>
<L>For ev'ry Night to <HI>Ransford-street</HI> you go;</L>
<L>Where painted Scenes, and tinsell'd taudry Dress,</L>

<P>Two Venders of the same Commodity will be a little too apt to depreciate each other's Goods; therefore the Poet drew his Pen in their De∣fence, and furnished forth the following <HI>Pro∣logue,</HI> spoke by Miss <HI>Mackay,</HI> in the Character of <HI>Lady Townley,</HI> in the <HI>Provok'd Husband.</HI></P>

<P>We may see, this last Bard did not take the least Advantage of his Antagonist: Their Lines were exactly even, and eighteen Thrusts given on each Side, and therefore neither could claim the Conquest; tho', like Battles in <HI>Flanders,</HI> each Side claimed the Victory, and each Ge∣neral put on the Wreath of Conqueror.</P>
<P>The Theatre in <HI>Aungier-street</HI> was built by the voluntary Subscription of many of the illu∣strious Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom: The first Stone was laid by the Duke of <HI>Dorset,</HI> then Lord Lieutenant; but, I think, the Archi∣tect had more View to the Magnificent, than Theatrical. The Audience Part is ornamented with rich Embellishment, that gives it a su∣perb Countenance; but, no Disparagement to the Architect in other Buildings, this might have been more convenient, with less Cost. But I believe the Contriver had an Eye more to <HI>Ridottos,</HI> than the <HI>Drama:</HI> If so, indeed, his Intentions were answered; for, in that Shape, it may vie with that in the <HI>Hay-market</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> Thrusting my own Opinion, in this Man∣ner, might have the Air of Presumption, if my Employment and Observation had not

<P>THIS worthy Gentleman was born in <HI>London,</HI> the Year 1638. of an antient Family. His Father married a near Relation of that great <HI>Scholar</HI> and <HI>Soldier,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who was first Gentleman to that Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that was kill'd by Lieutenant <HI>Felton</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First.

<P>In the Year 1682. at the Death of the Master of the Revels, through Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI>'s Interest with the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> he was made Pa∣tentee, and Master of the Revels in this King∣dom.

<P>I Have no Pretence to ask a Favour of Mr. <HI>Ashbury,</HI> but that he has a thousand times oblig'd me. I take the Liberty, therefore, to recommend the Bearer, my Nephew <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>William Wilks,</HI> the Nephew mentioned in this Letter, came over here, and play'd several Parts in the Old <HI>Smock-alley</HI> Theatre; and, tho' young and genteel, he was only the Shadow of his Uncle, and his Name befriended him more than his Abilities. He return'd to <HI>England,</HI> after a Year's Probation here, and was en∣tered one of the Company in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> at thirty Shil∣lings a Week, and died before he had reached his 30th Year, or a higher Salary.

He was bred an Attorney, but is unhappily fallen in Love with that fickle Mistress the Stage, and no Arguments can dissuade him from it. I have refus'd to give him any Coun∣tenance, in Hopes that Time and Experience might cure him: But since I find him de∣termined to make an Attempt somewhere, no one, I am sure, is able to give him so just a Notion of the Business as Mr. <HI>Ashbury;</HI> and indeed I am proud to own, that all the Success I have met with, both with you, and in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> on the Stage, has been intirely owing to the early Impressions I received from <HI>You.</HI></P>
<P>If you find that my Nephew wants either Genius, or any other necessary Qualification, I beg, dear Sir, that you will freely tell him his Disabilities; and then it is possible, he may more easily be persuaded to return to his Friends and Business, which I am in∣form'd he understands perfectly well.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is only to let you know that I am safely arrived at <HI>Chester,</HI> where I had the good Fortune to meet with Sir <HI>John Stanley,</HI> who was well pleased to see me.

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> suceeded Mr. <HI>Darling</HI> as Stew∣ard of the <HI>King's-Inns,</HI> a Post of good Profit. I had not the Pleasure of knowing this great Man but till the latter Part of his Life; yet, notwithstanding his great Age, I have seen him perform several Parts with the utmost Satisfac∣tion; and tho' at his Years it could not be ex∣pected the Fire of Youth and Vigour should blaze out, yet Truth and Nature might be seen in a just Light. His Person was of an advantageous Height well-proportioned and manly; and, notwithstanding his great Age, erect; a Countenance that demanded a reve∣rential Awe, a full and meaning Eye, pier∣cing, tho' not in its full Lustre; and yet I have seen him read Letters, and printed Books, with∣out any Assistance from Art; a sweet-sound∣ing manly Voice, without any Symptoms of his Age in his Speech. I have seen him ac∣quit himself in the Part of <HI>Careless</HI> in the <HI>Com∣mittee</HI> so well, that his Years never struck upon Remembrance. And his Person, Figure, and Manner in <HI>Don Quixote</HI> were inimitable. The Use of a short Cloak in former Fashions on the Stage seem'd habitual to him, and in Comedy he seemed to wear it in Imagination, which
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
often produced Action, tho' not ungraceful, particular and odd to many of the Audience; yet in Tragedy those Actions were left off, and every Motion manly, great, and proper.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Ashbury,</HI> even in her noon-tide Sun, had an amiable Person, a sweet, innocent, mo∣dest, winning Countenance; and, having so great a Master in the Art, was ever just in Speech and Action, without climbing to the Summit of Perfection; yet I have seen her perform one Part that seem'd a finish'd Ori∣ginal, where all since have appeared to me but excellent Copies (if I may use the Term), that is, Mrs. <HI>Pinchwife</HI> in <HI>Wycherly</HI>'s Comedy of the <HI>Country Wife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Joseph Ashbury,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> died <HI>July</HI> 24. 1720. in the 82d Year of his Age, retaining his Judg∣ment to the last Moment of his Life. Mrs. <HI>Ash∣bury</HI> surviv'd him a few Years, bewailing his Loss till she follow'd him to the Grave. This great Man was Master of the Revels to Five Monarchs of <HI>England,</HI> viz. K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. K. <HI>James</HI> II. K. <HI>William,</HI> Q. <HI>Anne,</HI> and K. <HI>George</HI> the First. I shall lead him to his Grave, with the following Poem on his lamented Death.</P>
<LG>
<L>As distant Thunder in a rolling Cloud,</L>
<L>First murmurs inwardly, then roars aloud;</L>
<L>Till the dread Clap frights ev'ry mortal Ear,</L>
<L>And strikes them with a just and panic Fear:</L>
<L>Such was the sad distracted News which bore</L>
<L>The Tidings to us—<HI>Ashbury</HI>'s no more!</L>
<L>The Muses speechless to his Shrine repair,</L>
<L>Ev'n Art, and Wit, stand silent Mourners there;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="94"/>
Yet bolder Zeal will Bands of Duty break,</L>
<L>And Gratitude has Liberty to speak:</L>
<L>True Passion too can Inspiration bring:</L>
<L>'Twas Grief first taught the Nightingale to sing—</L>
<L>From his, as from some Hero's awful Tomb,</L>
<L>Ev'n my dead Muse shall vital Warmth resume.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first in Learning<HI>'s</HI> Orb his Lustreblaz'd,</L>
<L>The World look'd up, transported and amaz'd!</L>
<L>His Words, as if inspir'd, Impression made;</L>
<L><HI>Ulysses'</HI> Skill, without his Craft, display'd:</L>
<L>His Counsels ne'er were varnish'd o'er with Art,</L>
<L>With Policy he still did Truth impart,</L>
<L>Spoke Oracles, but always spoke his Heart.</L>
<L>By Judgment's Compass ev'ry Course he steer'd,</L>
<L>And watch'd the Signals ere the Storm appear'd.</L>
<L>His Prudence o'er the Surges did prevail,</L>
<L>With Ballast still proportion'd to his Sail—</L>
<L>Precipitately ne'er assum'd a Trust,</L>
<L>To promise, slow; but in Performance just:</L>
<L>By Grace instructed, and by Nature mild;</L>
<L>Nor relish'd Life, but when he reconcil'd.</L>
<L>His Life and Aspect did just Patterns give,</L>
<L>What Figures we should make, and how to live.</L>

<HEAD>Mr. ANTONY ASTON, commonly called TONY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Person was bred an Attorney in <HI>England;</HI> but, having a Smattering of Wit and Humour, he left the Study of the Law for Parts on the Stage. He strain'd sorth a Comedy which was acted on the Theatre in
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
<HI>Smock-alley,</HI> call'd <HI>Love in a Hurry,</HI> but with no Success. He play'd in all the Theatres in <HI>London,</HI> but never continued long in any; his Way of living was peculiar to himself and Fa∣mily, resorting to the principal Cities and Towns in <HI>England</HI> with his <HI>Medley,</HI> as he call'd it, which consisted of some capital Scenes o Humour out of the most celebrated Plays. His Company were generally compos'd of his own Family, himself, his Wife and Son; between every Scene, a Song or Dialogue of his own Compo∣sition, fill'd up the Chinks of the slender Meal. He pretended a Right to every Town he enter∣ed; and if a Company came to any Place where he exhibited his Compositions, he would use all his Art to evacuate the Place of these Interlo∣pers, as he called them. He was never out of his Way; or if he met with a sightly House when he was Itinerant, he would soon find the Name, Title, and Circumstances of the Fami∣ly, curry them over with his humorous Verse, and by that means get something to bear his Charges to his next Station. His <HI>Finances,</HI> like those of Kingdoms, were sometimes at the Tide of <HI>Flood,</HI> and as often at low <HI>Ebb.</HI> In one, where his Stream had left the Chanel dry, yet ready to launch out on a trading Voyage with∣out a Cargo, or Provision, he called up his Landlord, to whom there was something due, told him of his Losses in his present Voyage, and being sent for to another Place, desired he would lend him a small Sum upon his <HI>Wardrobe</HI> (which he shew'd him in a large Box) ten times
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
the Value of the Debt owing, or the Sum bor∣row'd. The honest Landlord, seeing a proper Security, easily comply'd, gave him the Sum demanded, lock'd up the Trunk, put the Key in his Pocket, and retired. But as no Vessel can make a Voyage without Sails, and other proper Materials, he had contriv'd a false Bot∣tom to this great Box, took out the Stuffing, and by Degrees, sent off his Wardrobe by his Emissaries, unperceiv'd. And that the Weight should not detect him, he filled up the Void with Cabbage-stalks, Bricks and Stones cloath'd in Rags to prevent moving, when the Vehicle was to be taken the next Morning into the Landlord's Custody. Every thing succeeded to his Wish, and away went <HI>Tony,</HI> but far wide of the Place he mentioned to mine Host. A Week was the stated Time of Redemption, which the Landlord saw elapse with infinite Sa∣tisfaction (for he had a Bill of Sale of the Con∣tents in the Trunk); he open'd it with great Pleasure; but when he saw the fine Lining! he was motionless, like a Statue carv'd by a bungling Hand. He had recourse to Re∣venge. A Bailiff with proper Directions was sent to the Place mentioned; but if he had discover'd the least Wit in his Anger, he might have thought <HI>Tony</HI> knew better than to tell him Truth. I only mention this little Story, to let the Reader know the Shifts the <HI>Itinerant</HI> Gentry are sometimes put to. For <HI>Tony,</HI> when his <HI>Finances</HI> were in Order, and cur'd of the Consump∣tion, honestly paid him. I have had this Tale
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
both from <HI>Tony</HI> and the Landlord, who then kept the <HI>Black-Boy</HI> Inn at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Tony</HI> by chance ever came to a Town where a Company of <HI>Showmen</HI> (as People oft call them) had got in before him, he present∣ly declar'd War with them; and his general Conditions of Peace were, that they should act a Play for his Benefit, that he might leave the Siege, and march with his small Troop to some other Place. And as he was a Person of Humour, and a proper Assurance, he ge∣nerally, like a Cat, skimm'd off the fat Cream, and left the lean Milk to those that stay'd behind. I believe he is Travelling still, and is as well known in every Town, as the Post-Horse that carries the Mail. He shall make his <HI>Exit</HI> with the two following Lines.</P>

<P>THIS excellent Tragedian was Son to <HI>John Booth,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of the County Palatine of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Warrington</HI> Fa∣mily. He was born in the Year 1681. in that County; but soon after his Birth his Father and Family removed to <HI>Westminster,</HI> and, at that celebrated School, the Son received his Education, under the Correction (as he call'd it) of the great Dr. <HI>Busby</HI> and Dr. <HI>Knipe.</HI> He
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
inform'd me, the first Look he cast towards the Theatre, was from the Applause he received in performing in the <HI>Andria</HI> of <HI>Terence</HI> in <HI>La∣tin</HI> at <HI>Westminster-School,</HI> which perverted his Thoughts from the Pulpit, for which his Fa∣ther intended him. At Seventeen he was chose out for the University, and had Orders to prepare for his Journey; but his Inclinations prevented the Designs of his Friends.</P>
<P>He first apply'd to Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> then to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Two celebrated Actors; but they decently refus'd him for Fear of the Resent∣ment of his Family: But this did not prevent his pursuing the Point in View; therefore he resolv'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and safely arrived in <HI>June</HI> 1698. His first Rudiments Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> taught him, and his first Appearance was in the Part of <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> where he acquitted himself so well to a crouded Audience, that Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> re∣warded him with a Present of Five Guineas, which was the more acceptable as his last Shil∣ling was reduced to Brass (as he inform'd me). But an odd Accident fell out upon this Occa∣sion. It being very warm Weather, in his last Scene of the Play, as he waited to go on, he inadvertently wiped his Face, that, when he enter'd, he had the Appearance of a Chimney-Sweeper (his own Words). At his Entrance, he was surpris'd at the Variety of Noises he heard in the Audience (for he knew not what he had done), that a little confounded him, till he received an extraordinary Clap of Applause, which settled his Mind. The Play was desir'd
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
for the next Night of Acting, when an Actress fitted a Crape to his Face, with an Opening proper for the Mouth, and shap'd in Form for the Nose; but, in the first Scene, one Part of the Crape slip'd off: <HI>And Zounds</HI>! said he (he was a little apt to swear), <HI>I look'd like a Mag∣pie! When I came off, they Lamp-black'd me for the rest of the Night</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Composition for blackening the Face are Ivory∣black and Pomatum, which is, with some Pains, clean'd with fresh Butter.</NOTE>, <HI>that I was flayed before it could be got off again.</HI></P>
<P>He remained here near Two Years, and, in that Time, by Letters, reconciled himself to his Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and return'd with great Theatrical Improvement, where he gra∣dually stept to Perfection. In 1704. he mar∣ry'd the Daughter of Sir <HI>Wm. Barkham,</HI> Bart. an antient Family in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who died without Issue in the Year 1711. <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> in the <HI>Distrest Mother</HI> plac'd him in the Seat of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> fix'd him there; and, to reward his Merit, he was join'd in the Patent, tho' great Interest was made against him by the other <HI>Patentees;</HI> who, to prevent his soliciting his Patrons at Court, then at <HI>Windsor,</HI> gave out Plays every Night, where Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had a principal Part. Notwith∣standing this Step, he had a Chariot and Six of a Nobleman's waiting for him at the End of every Play, that whipt him the Twenty Miles in three Hours, and brought him back to the Business of the Theatre the next Night.
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
He told me, not one Nobleman in the Kingdom had so many Sets of Horses at Command as he had at that Time, having no less than Eight; the first Set carrying him to <HI>Hounslow</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> Ten Miles; and the next Set ready waiting with another Chariot to carry him to <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>He had a vast Fund of Understanding as well as Good-nature, and a persuasive Elocu∣tion even in common Discourse, that would even compel you to believe him against your Judgment of Things. Notwithstanding his Exuberance of Fancy, he was untainted in his Morals. In his younger Years he admir'd none of the Heathen Deities so much as <HI>Jolly Bac∣chus;</HI> to him he was very devout; yet, if he drank ever so deep, it never marr'd his Study, or his Stomach. But, immediately after his Marriage with Miss <HI>Santlow,</HI> whose wise Con∣duct, Beauty, and winning Behaviour, so wrought upon him, that Home, and her Com∣pany, were his chief Happiness, he intirely contemn'd the Folly of Drinking out of Season, and from one Extreme fell, I think, into the other too suddenly; for his Appetite for Food had no Abatement. I have often known Mrs. <HI>Booth,</HI> out of extreme Tenderness to him, order the Table to be remov'd, for fear of over∣charging his Stomach.</P>
<P>His profound Learning was extraordinary, since he left School at Seventeen, took to the Stage at Eighteen, and, by his own Confession, that the Business of the Stage, joined with his
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
Devotion to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> had taken up most of his Time since, yet I have seen him take a Classic, and render it in such elegant <HI>English,</HI> that no Translator would hardly excel. I will set down his Character from a Paper call'd the <HI>Prompter,</HI> by <HI>Aaron Hill,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose Writings will be a living Monument of his own Merit.</P>
<Q>Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> was a Man of a strong, clear, and lively Imagination. His Conversation was lively and instructive: He had the Ad∣vantage of a finish'd Education to improve and illustrate the bountiful Gifts of Nature. Two Advantages distinguished him in the strongest Light, from the rest of the Frater∣nity. He had Learning to understand per∣fectly whatever it was his Part to speak, and Judgment to know how far it agreed or disagreed with his Character. Hence arose a peculiar Grace, which was visible to every Spectator, tho' few were at the Pains of ex∣amining into the Cause of their Pleasure. He could soften, or slide over, with a kind of elegant Negligence, the Improprieties in a Part he acted; while, on the contrary, he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties, as if he exerted a latent Spirit, which had been kept back for such an Occasion, that he might alarm, waken, and transport, in those Places only, where the Dignity of his own good Sense could be supported with that of his Author. A little Reflection up∣on this remarkable Quality, will teach us to account for that manifest Languor which has
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
sometimes been observed in his Action; and which was generally, tho', I think, falsly, imputed to the Indolence of his Temper. For the same Reason, tho' in the customary Round of his Business he would condescend to some Parts in Comedy, he seldom ap∣pear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character. The Passions which he found in Comedy, were not strong enough to excite his Fire; and what seem'd Want of Qualification, was only Absence of Im∣pression. He had a Talent of discovering the Passions where they lay hid in some ce∣lebrated Parts by the injudicious Practice of other Actors; when he had discover'd, he soon grew able to express them: And his Secret for attaining this great Lesson of the Theatre, was an Adaption of his Looks to his Voice, by which artful Imitation of Na∣ture, the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance: So that it was <HI>Booth</HI>'s Excellence to be heard and seen the same, whether as the pleas'd, the griev'd, the pi∣tying, the reproachful, or the angry. His Gesture, or, as it is commonly call'd, his Action, was but the Result and necessary Consequence of his Dominion over his Voice and Countenance; for having, by a Concur∣rence of Two such Causes, impressed his Ima∣gination with such a Stamp and Spirit of Passion, his Nerves obey'd the Impulse by a kind of natural Dependency, or relaxed
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
or braced successively into all that fine Ex∣pressiveness with which he painted what he spoke without Restraint, or Affectation.</Q>
<P>As a Proof of Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s Learning, I am desired to insert the <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription wrote by him on the Death of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> was zealously at∣tach'd to the Interest of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, and served in his Army as a Volunteer, with Two Servants. After the Abdication, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> return'd to the Thea∣tre, by the Persuasion of many Friends, and the Desire of the Town, who admired his Performance. The first Character he chose to appear in was that of <HI>Wilmore</HI> in the <HI>Rover,</HI> his original Part in that Comedy; but, being informed that he should be maltreated on account of his Principles, he gave Orders for the Curtain to drop, if any Disturbance should come from the Audience. Ac∣cordingly the Play began in the utmost Tranquillity; but when Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> entered in the First Act, the Storm began with the usual Noise upon such Occasions (an Up∣roar not unknown to all Frequenters of Theatres, and by Time mightily improved by a particular Set that de∣light in that agreeable Harmony, as pleasing to the Ear, as a Sow-gelder's Horn, that sets all the Village Curs to imitate the Sound); Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> gave the Signal, the Curtain dropp'd, and the Audience dismiss'd. No Per∣suasions could prevail upon him to appear on the Stage again, till that great Poet, Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> had wrote his Comedy of <HI>Love for Love,</HI> which was in the Year 1695. more than three Years void from the above Accident. This celebrated Author prevailed upon several Persons of the First Rank to move Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to appear in the Character of <HI>Scandal</HI> in that excellent Comedy: But he yielded more to the Persuasions of his sincere Friends, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Barry,</HI> and accepted the Part; and his inimitable Performance added one Grace to the Play. He took his Station in many Plays afterwards, for, I think, three Years. He died of a Cold, occa∣sino'd by a violent Fit of the Cramp; for when he was first seiz'd, he threw himself out of Bed, and remained so long before the Cramp left him (in that naked Con∣dition), that a Cold fell upon his Lungs, a Fever ensu'd, and Death releas'd him in three Days after.</NOTE>the <HI>Actor,</HI>

He immediately parted, sent to Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> (in the Name of a Gentleman) to a neighbouring Tavern; when he enter'd, <HI>Bowen</HI> shut the Door, clapt his Back against it, and drew his Sword. Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> mildly expostulated with him, but all to no Purpose. He threaten'd to pin him to the Wainscot, if he did not draw that Moment; which he did to defend his own Life, with an Intention to disarm him: But <HI>Bowen</HI> pressed so furiously upon him, that he receiv'd the Wound which occasion'd his Death three Days after. However, when the Loss of Blood had weakened his Rage, he confess'd his own Folly and Madness had justly drawn on his own Misfortune; and, at the Tryal, Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> was honourably acquitted. Mr. <HI>Bowen</HI> had several Children by his Wife, and a Boy illegitimate, who, tho' he bore his Name, had none of his Care; and therefore lived a dissolute Life, without the least Im∣provement from Education, and justly gain'd the Nick-name of <HI>Rugged-and-Tough.</HI> One Day a Clergyman in <HI>St. Clement Danes</HI> (a Church in the <HI>Strand)</HI> was catechizing the Chil∣dren of the Parish, where <HI>Rugged-and-Tough</HI>

<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>Spranger Barry,</HI> from a Friend in the Country.</HEAD>
<P>AS I lately heard you were determin'd for the Stage, my Affection for your Person, and Concern for your Misfortunes, gave Oc∣casion to some Reflections which may, pos∣sibly, be of Use to you in this new Scene of Life. In the Time of <HI>Athenian</HI> Elegance, when Learning was in Taste, when Liberty was the Blessing of the Public, and the Pa∣rent of Arts; which Excellence, alone, found Honour, Capacity, Employment, and Me∣rit, Rewards; the Stage grew suddenly from its Infancy to Maturity, and, from be∣ing encouraged, became itself the Encou∣rager of those Talents and Geniuses with which it was supply'd. It was there that each Spectator was taught his particular Conduct, by seeing his own Representation in the ge∣neral Picture of Life, where the Lights were thrown alone upon Virtue, and the Shades upon Vice; where Great and Eminent, of every Age, were set up for Imitation; where every noble, tender, and exalted Sentiment, was recorded, and daily inculcated; where Purity was invited, Obscenity exiled; and where the Heart was attached to Virtue, by affectingly walking through all its Scenes of Misfortunes; and, lastly, exulting in its fi∣nal Reward. No Institution, less than divine, could ever be of equal Efficacy, or Advan∣tage:
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
For when Instruction becomes our Entertainment, then, only, it is, that Vice grows detestable, and Virtue delightful, from the Pleasure it brings: And hence were the Sentiments of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Vulgar so exalted, that an immoral Expression, tho' naturally introduced in an immoral Character, has been hiss'd off the Stage. Shall we think, then, that where the Doctrine was so glo∣rious, the Preaching was dishonourable? No, sure. To be an Actor, then, was not to be a <HI>Mimic;</HI> no Trick of Gesture, or Tone of Voice, could avail: Those of Distinction were to be, by Nature, the very Persons they re∣presented; they were to have the same Ele∣vation of Soul, the same Delicacy of Thought, the same Morality of Life, the same Huma∣nity of Heart, and Sweetness of Affections, that could at once constitute the Patriot, the Hero, the Lover, and the Friend. The Words only belonged to the Author, the Sen∣timents were, by Nature, their own; and hence flowed that Aptness of Attitude, that Ease in Elocution, that expressive Look, that eloquent Silence, that Freedom of Action, and that Harmony of the Whole, which at once exalted, melted, and subdued a mighty Nation to Elegance and Virtue. Where such an Actor was found, he was justly esteem'd a Blessing to the Community. As his Talents were the Admiration, so his Per∣son was the Delight, of all People; in his Life he was honoured, and his Posterity provided
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
for. You will now, perhaps, be tempted to wish, that this was the Stage of the <HI>Athe∣nians;</HI> but Nature and Mankind are always the same; and even on the <HI>English</HI> Theatre I have known some, who gain'd more Encou∣ragement and Respect as Actors, than they deserv'd as Men: But if the Members of your new Province have brought a Scandal on their Profession, let it be your Study to re∣trieve it. If I have any Judgment, you are qualified to excel in this Way; nor would I have you imagine, that any will shun you in Private, merely because you give them Plea∣sure and Entertainment in Public. Let your Heart be the true Model of whatever is great, or good, in the Characters you re∣present: Take Instruction with Pleasure, and Applause with Humility; and then fear not to be received as the Man of Worth, and the Gentleman you have hitherto been esteemed.

There is nothing more mistaken than that Right which some People imagine they have in Theatres, and other publick Places; for, in Truth, their Right consists only in decently partaking of the Entertainment, and, where they think it deserves it, giving a proper and timely Applause. It is the same Right that a Man has in a Ferry-boat, that is (if he behaves himself properly), to be safe∣ly and pleasantly landed on the opposite Shore; but, if he disturbs the Passage, and en∣dangers the Boat, the Ferryman and Passen∣gers

A surly Swain at a Horse-race, fan∣sying he had a Right to any Part of the Sod, would needs ride directly in the Course; the first of the Racers threw him and his Horse twenty Yards on the Ground; and better had it been if he had died with his Horse on the Spot; for he received a Lash from every Whip in the Field. Every Gentleman, pro∣perly habited, has a Right to go to Court; but if a Person, having a Pique to a Battle-ax, should breed an Uproar in the Levee-room, he would certainly have a Halberd in his Guts, or be sent to the Black Hole. There can be no Excuse for doing an Injury to a Multitude.</P>
<P>I have often dined at a Two-dish Ordinary, where I had a Right to partake of each; but if I should have taken it into my Head to have thrown one Dish at the Waiter, and kick'd the other about the Floor, I do verily believe I should have been kick'd down Stairs. If a Gentleman (Heaven defend us!) should have a Quarrel on his Hands with a Porter, the Gentleman certainly has a Right to do himself Justice; but I should think it some∣what untimely, if he should knock the Fel∣low down when he had a Dozen of my Wine on his Back. <HI>Shakespear,</HI> who well under∣stood the Decorum of Theatres, gives strong Advice for proper Behaviour: He speaks it to the Players, but he meant it to the Spec∣tators likewise, tho', in his Modesty, he held

it not meet so to set it down. He directs them to be extremely careful not to create the least Noise or Disturbance in the House when the Play should be duly attended to. He concludes, that, to disturb the House, <HI>is villainous, and betrays a pitiful Ambition in the Fool that does it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman came into the World on the Day of the great and destructive Storm in 1703. whose Rage rang'd over the greatest Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> but, I think, most fatal to <HI>England.</HI> He is Son to <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> that excellent Comedian, the present Poet Lau∣reat, whose dramatic Works are so well known.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI> receiv'd his Education at <HI>Winchester</HI> School: His strong Genius for the <HI>Theatre</HI> brought him early upon the Stage, where he has appear'd in full Lustre in the va∣rious Branches of Comedy; and tho' he has
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
perform'd several Parts in Tragedy with Suc∣cess, in my Imagination the <HI>Sock</HI> sits easier up∣on him than the <HI>Buskin.</HI> His first Wife, men∣tion'd in the Account of Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> was Miss <HI>Johnson,</HI> by whom he had two Daughters. The eldest, I am inform'd, has appear'd on the Stage with great Prospect of excelling, first in the Part of <HI>Juliet,</HI> in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> by <HI>Shakespear.</HI> His second Wife, Miss <HI>Arne</HI> (by whom he has no living Issue), is arriv'd at the highest Pitch of Excellence in the amiable, soft, and tender.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI> has appear'd twice as a dramatic Author; <HI>viz.</HI> first, <HI>Henry the Sixth,</HI> alter'd from <HI>Shakespear,</HI> which was play'd in the Summer-season of 1721. without any Cri∣ticks laying hold of it: His second Perform∣ance in the Drama was, a Comedy call'd <HI>The Lover;</HI> but as the Criticks were always ready arm'd to attack the Father, they drew their Indignation on the Son, with the false Ima∣gination that the Father was the conceal'd Au∣thor. But I am positively convinced to the contrary; for that Gentleman to me refus'd the Sight of it before it appear'd on the Stage, for the very Reasons, he suspected, that fell out ac∣cordingly. However, he wrote an <HI>Epilogue,</HI> that was spoken by Mr. <HI>Theophilus</HI> and his Wife, that took away the Sting of the Revelrout, and the Play was perform'd six Nights in the Year 1731.

<P>Mr. <HI>William Raftor,</HI> the Father, was bred to the Law; however, when King <HI>James</HI> was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he enter'd into his Service; and, after the decisive Battle of the <HI>Boyne,</HI> in the Year 1690. he follow'd his Master's Fortune, and, by his Merit, obtain'd a Captain's Com∣mission in the Service of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Four∣teenth; but, gaining a Pardon, with many other Gentlemen in his Condition, he came to <HI>England,</HI> where he married Mrs. <HI>Daniel,</HI> Daughter to an eminent Citizen on <HI>Fishstreet∣hill,</HI> with whom he had a handsome Fortune: By her he had a numerous Issue.</P>

Miss <HI>Catharine</HI> was born in the Year 1711. She had an early Genius for the Stage; for she told me, when she was about twelve Years old, Miss <HI>Johnson</HI> (afterwards the first Wife of Mr. <HI>Theo. Cibber,</HI> another rising Genius, if Death had not overtaken her in her Prime of Youth) and she, used to tag after the celebrated Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> (her own Words) whenever they saw him in the Streets, and gape at him as a Wonder.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Raftor</HI> had a facetious Turn of Hu∣mour, and infinite Spirits, with a Voice and Manner in finging Songs of Pleasantry peculiar to herself. Those Talents Mr. <HI>Theo. Cibber</HI> and I (we all at that Time living together in one House) thought a sufficient Pasport to the <HI>Theatre.</HI> We recommended her to the <HI>Lau∣reat,</HI> whose infallible Judgment soon found out her Excellencies; and the Moment he heard her sing, put her down in the List of Perfor∣mers at twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week. But never any Person of her Age flew to Perfection with such Rapidity; and the old discerning Mana∣gers always distinguish'd Merit by Reward. Her first Appearance was in the Play of <HI>Mith∣ridates</HI> King of <HI>Pontus,</HI> in <HI>Ismenes</HI> the Page to <HI>Ziphares,</HI> in Boy's Cloaths, where a Song pro∣per to the Circumstances of the Scene was in∣troduced, which she performed with extraor∣dinary Applause. But after this, like a Bullet in the Air, there was no distinguishing the Track, till it came to its utmost Execution.</P>
<P>I remember the first Night of <HI>Love in a Rid∣dle</HI> (which was murdered in the same Year) a
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
Pastoral Opera wrote by the <HI>Laureat,</HI> which the Hydra-headed Multitude resolv'd to worry without hearing, a Custom with Authors of Merit, when Miss <HI>Raftor</HI> came on in the Part of <HI>Phillida,</HI> the monstrous Roar subsided. A Person in the Stage Box, next to my Post, called out to his Companion in the following elegant Stile—<Q>Zounds, <HI>Tom</HI>! take Care; or this charming little Devil will save all.</Q></P>
<P>In the Year 1732. she was marry'd to Mr. <HI>G. Clive,</HI> Son to Mr. Baron <HI>Clive.</HI> I shall be silent in conjugal Affairs; but in all my long Acquaintance with her, I could never ima∣gine she deserved ill Usage.</P>

<P>When I was instructing her in the Part of <HI>Polly,</HI> she told me, a Lady that Morning was surprised to hear from a Gentleman of her Ac∣quaintance, that she was taken for a Boy in Disguise.

<P>Since leaving this Kingdom she is marry'd to her supposed Father, Monsieur <HI>Chateauneuf;</HI> and now it is made her real Name.

<P>THIS excellent <HI>Actor</HI> was born in <HI>June</HI> 1688. in <HI>London.</HI> His Father having a numerous Issue, put his Son Apprentice to an Upholder in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> where I was first acquainted with him. He was early ad∣dicted to the Drama. I remember, when he was an Apprentice, we play'd in several private
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
Plays together: when we were preparing to act <HI>Sophonisba,</HI> or, <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s <HI>Overthrow,</HI> af∣ter I had wrote out my Part of <HI>Massiva,</HI> I car∣ried him the Book of the Play to study the Part of King <HI>Masinissa;</HI> I found him finishing a Velvet Cushion, and gave him the Book; but alas! before he could secrete it, his Master (a hot voluble <HI>Frenchman)</HI> came in upon us, and the Book was thrust under the Velvet of the Cushion. His Master, as usual, rated him for not working, with a <HI>Mortbleu! why a you not vark,</HI> Tom? and stood over him so long, that I saw, with some Mortification, the Book irrecoverably stitch'd up in the Cushion, ne∣ver to be retriev'd till the Cushion is worn to Pieces. Poor <HI>Tom</HI> cast many a desponding Look upon me when he was finishing the Fate of the Play, while every Stitch went to both our Hearts. His Master observing our Looks, turn'd to me, and with Words that broke their Necks over each other for Haste, abused both of us: The most intelligible of his great Num∣ber of Words, were <HI>Jack Pudenges,</HI> and the like Expressions of Contempt.</P>
<P>But our Play was gone for ever! Another time we were so bold to attempt <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where our 'Prentice <HI>Tom</HI> had the Part of the <HI>Ghost,</HI> Father to young <HI>Hamlet.</HI> His Armour was composed of Pasteboard, neatly painted. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> had Intelligence of what we were about, and to our great Surprize and Mortification, made one of our Audience. The Ghost in its first Appearance is dumb to
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
<HI>Horatio.</HI> While these Scenes past, the <HI>French∣man</HI> only muttered between his Teeth, and we were in Hopes his Passion would subside; but when our Ghost began his first Speech to <HI>Ham∣let, Mark me,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>Begar me vil marke you presently</HI>! and, without saying any more, beat our poor Ghost off the Stage through the Street, while every Stroke on the Pasteboard Armour grieved the Auditors (because they did not pay for their Seats) insomuch that three or four ran after the Ghost, and brought him back in Triumph, with the avenging <HI>French∣man</HI> at his Heels, who would not be appeas'd till our <HI>Ghost</HI> promised him never to commit the Offence of Acting again. A Promise made like many others, never intended to be kept. However, in the last Year of his Time, his rigid Master gave him a little more Liber∣ty, and our young Actor play'd different Parts, till he was taken Notice of by Mr. <HI>Keene,</HI> an excellent <HI>Player</HI> at that Time. He was intro∣duced upon the Stage in the Part of <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> where he met with a good Reception in the Year 1711.</P>
<P>The next Season he was invited over by <HI>Joseph Ashbury,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and in the Year 1713. wedded the Daughter of that worthy Gentle∣man, by whom he had a numerous Issue, par∣ticularly three Sons, who are now alive; the eldest, Mr. <HI>Joseph Elrington,</HI> who makes a con∣siderable Figure on the present Theatre here; Mr. <HI>Richard Elrington,</HI> now of a Country Com∣pany in <HI>England;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Elrington,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
the youngest, first an Ensign, now a Lieutenant in Colonel <HI>Flemming</HI>'s Regiment in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI> the Father was a true Copy of Mr. <HI>Verbruggen,</HI> a very great Actor in Tra∣gedy, and polite Parts in Comedy; but the former had an infinite Fund of (what is called Low) Humour upon the Stage. I have seen him perform Don <HI>Cholerick</HI> in the <HI>Fop's Fortune</HI> with infinite Pleasure; he entered into the true Humour of the Character, equal to the Ori∣ginal, Mr. <HI>William Penkethman.</HI> His Voice was manly, strong, and sweetly full-ton'd; his Figure tall and well-proportion'd. His eldest Son, Mr. <HI>Joseph Elrington,</HI> is most like him in Person and Countenance.</P>
<P>This excellent Player succeeded his Father-in-law, <HI>Joseph Ashbury,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the Place of Steward of the <HI>King's-Inns;</HI> and the more to establish him in the Kingdom, a Post was given him of fifty Pounds a Year in the <HI>Quit-Rent Office;</HI> also <HI>Gunner</HI> to the Train of Artillery, a Gift of the Lord <HI>Mountjoy,</HI> Father to the present Earl of <HI>Blessington,</HI> which at the Death of that noble Lord, he got Permission to dis∣pose of.

Since his elder Brother's Death he has under∣taken many of his Parts, which he copies as near as possible.</P>
<P>He was admired some Years ago as a good executing <HI>Harlequin,</HI> Agility and Strength be∣ing two main Ingredients in the Composition of that motly Gentleman, where <HI>Heels</HI> are of more Use than the <HI>Head.</HI> In one of his Feats of Activity he was much hurt, and was in some Danger of breaking his Neck to please the Spectators, the Ears having little to do in such Entertainments; yet this unlucky Spring met with universal Applause.</P>
<P>I remember a Tumbler in the <HI>Hay-market</HI> Theatre in <HI>London</HI> by such an Accident beat the Breath out of his Body, which raised such vociferous Applause, that lasted longer than the vent'rous Man's Life, for he never breathed more. Indeed his Wife had this Comfort,
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
when the Truth was known, Pity succeeded to the Roar of Applause.</P>
<P>Another Accident like this, fell out in Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> a Pantomime Entertainment in <HI>Lin∣coln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Theatre, where a Machine in the Working broke, threw the mock <HI>Pierrot</HI> down headlong with such Force, that the poor Man broke a Plank on the Stage with his Fall, and expired: Another was so sorely maimed, that he did not survive many Days; and a third, one of the softer Sex, broke her Thigh. But to prevent such Accidents for the future, those Persons are represented by inanimate Fi∣gures, so that if they break a Neck, a Leg, or an Arm, there needs no Surgeon.</P>
<P>Another Accident of the same Kind hap∣pened in <HI>Smock-alley,</HI> which gave me much Concern, as having a Hand in the Contrivance. The late Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> being to fly on the Back of a Witch, in the <HI>Lancashire Witches,</HI> thro' the Ignorance of the Workers in the Machine∣ry, the Fly broke, and they both fell toge∣ther, but thro' Providence they neither of them were much hurt; and such Care was taken afterwards, that no Accident of that Kind <HI>could</HI> happen.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. RICHARD ESTCOURT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent Comedian was born at <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> in the County of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in the Year 1668. where he received his Edu∣cation in the <HI>Latin</HI> School of that Town. He had an early Desire for the Stage; for, in the 15th Year of his Age, he stole from his Fa∣ther's House with a Country Company, and at <HI>Worcester,</HI> for fear of being known, set out with the Part of <HI>Roxana,</HI> in Woman's Appa∣rel (in <HI>Alexander the Great);</HI> but his Father, having Notice of it, sent to secure the Fugi∣tive, who made his Escape in a Suit of Wo∣man's Cloaths that he borrowed of one of the Itinerant Ladies, and trudg'd it to <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> a Corporation-town in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> twenty-five long Miles in one Day. When he came to the Inn, Beds were scarce, and he was obliged to take up with that of the Daughter's behind the Bar: The young Woman, going to Bed, found the wearied Traveller in a pro∣found Sleep; but, observing the Shirt instead of a Shift, she began to suspect her design'd Bed∣fellow; and, stooping to look on the Dress that lay upon the Ground, she saw a Pair of Man's Shoes under the Bed, that convinced her she might have been in an odd Situation, if she had gone to Bed in the Dark. She, upon the Dis∣covery, instantly called in the People of the House, and waked our drowsy Traveller. The
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
Landlord had designed to carry him decently to the Horse-pond, till <HI>Dick</HI> made a true Con∣fession of the whole Affair. By Accident, a Person of the Town of <HI>Tewksbury</HI> put up at the said Inn that Night, who knew our young disguised Wanderer; and that Knowlege signed his Pardon. In two Days afterwards his Cloaths were brought him from <HI>Worcester,</HI> ac∣companied with a Messenger from his Father, who led him the Road home again.</P>
<P>Soon after, the Father went with him to <HI>London,</HI> where he bound him fast to an Apo∣thecary in <HI>Hatton-garden.</HI> He was too impa∣tient to wait so long a Time for Liberty; there∣fore he stretched his Bonds till they broke, and, after an <HI>itinerant</HI> Life two Years in <HI>England,</HI> he went to try his Fortune in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he shone in an exalted theatrical Sphere for some Years, when he returned to <HI>London;</HI> where, by his Wit, and mimic Humour, his Conversation was taken up by Persons of the highest Rank, and Parts.</P>
<P>He was made Providore of the <HI>Beef-Stake-Club,</HI> and, for a Mark of Distinction, wore their Badge, which was a small Gridiron of Gold, hung about his Neck with a green silk Ribband. This Club was compos'd of the chief Wits and great Men of the Nation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Estcourt</HI> was the original Serjeant <HI>Kite,</HI> and every Night of Performance entertained the Audience with Variety of little Catches, and Flights of Humour, that pleased all but his <HI>Critics.</HI> He was a great Favourite with

He was Author of a Comedy called <HI>The Wife's Excuse; or, Cuckolds make them∣selves;</HI> and acted at the Theatre-Royal in the Year 1706. but, as I have been informed, with moderate Success.

<P>This celebrated Comedian paid his Debt to Nature in the Year 1733. after leaving the Stage some Years.

His Person was incline∣able to the Gross; therefore wanted Delicacy for the amiable Parts; he had an excellent har∣monious Voice, and just Delivery, but a little too indolent for much Study or Contemplation.</P>

In the last Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the Company of <HI>Dublin</HI> went down, in the Sum∣mer Season, to play at <HI>Corke:</HI> One Evening Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> was invited, by some Officers of a Regiment then on Duty in that City, to a Ta∣vern: Many Healths were propos'd, and went round, without Reluctance; when it came to Mr. <HI>Evans</HI>'s Turn, he proposed the Health of her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which so much dis∣gusted one of the Company (tho' cloath'd in the Livery of his Royal Mistress), that he ran down Stairs, and sent up a Drawer to whisper Mr. <HI>Evans;</HI> who immediately put on his Sword, and went after him, without taking the least Notice to the Company. He found his Anta∣gonist in a Room in the Passage of the Tavern, with the Door half open, who courageously made a Thrust at Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> which he put by with his left Hand; at this, Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> drew, thrust the Door wide open, enter'd, and soon drove his Opposer out to the Passage, where he disarmed the doughty Hero, before the Com∣pany above Stairs knew any thing of the Mat∣ter. The rest of the military Gentlemen ex∣pressed an Abhorrence to the Treatment Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> received, and, seemingly, reconciled them on the Spot; but, notwithstanding, when the Company return'd to <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Person who sent the Challenge up Stairs at <HI>Corke,</HI> being then returned also, told his own Story in such a Man∣ner, that several warm Gentlemen of the Army were made to believe, that Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> had af∣fronted the whole Body Military; and when the
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
poor suppos'd Culprit came to his Business of the Theatre, their Clamour, in the Audience, was so great, that the House was dismiss'd, and no Play to be acted till Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> had asked public Pardon upon the Stage. His high Spi∣rit was, with great Difficulty, brought to sub∣mit, but at last he consented. I remember the Play was, <HI>The Rival Queens; or, The Death of Alexander the Great;</HI> the Part of <HI>Alexander</HI> to be acted by the Delinquent. He came to ask Pardon before the Curtain: When he address'd the Audience, one Smart, from the Pit, cried out, <HI>Kneel, you Rascal! Evans,</HI> then collected in himself, replied, in the same Tone of Voice, <HI>No, you Rascal! I'll kneel to none but God, and my Queen</HI>! A dangerous Paroxysm, at such a Crisis. However, as there were many worthy Gentlemen of the Army who knew the whole Affair, the new-rais'd Clamour ceas'd, and the Play went through without any Molestation, and, by Degrees, Things return'd to their pro∣per Chanel. By this we may see, it is some Danger for an Actor to be in the right.</P>
<P>Three Years after this Affair, Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> went to the Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> and, in his Journey back to <HI>Ireland,</HI> was taken ill of a Fever, at the Town of <HI>Whitchurch</HI> in <HI>Shorpshire;</HI> from whence he was removed, for better Advice, to <HI>Chester,</HI> where he ended his Progress of Life, in the 41st Year of his Age; and was privately buried in the Cathedral, with∣out Monument, Stone, or Inscription.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GEORGE FARQUHAR.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this Gentleman owes his Birth to this Kingdom, and on the <HI>Irish</HI> Stage com∣menced Actor, I hope it will not be thought improper to give a short Account of him, which I shall take from his Life, that I col∣lected several Years past, to prefix to his Works. The Materials I received from Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> who approved of them before they went to the Pub∣lisher.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George Farquhar</HI> was born, in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> of Parents that held no mean Rank in that Part of the Country; who, having a nu∣merous Issue, could bestow on him no other Fortune than a genteel Education. As those who are bless'd with a poetical Genius always shew some Glimmerings of their Fancy in their Youth; so he, ere he arriv'd at his tenth Year, gave several Specimens of a peculiar Turn that Way. One of his juvenile Productions I shall here mention, in which he discovered a Way
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
of Thinking, as well as an Elegancy of Ex∣pression, far beyond his Years.</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">I took these Lines of Verse from the Mouth of Mr. <HI>Wilks.</HI></NOTE> The pliant Soul of erring Youth</L>

<L>And Manhood may to Virtue rise;</L>
<L>But he who, in his Youth, appears</L>
<L>A Fool, in Age will ne'er be wise.</L>
</LG>
<P>He was educated in the University of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where he acquired a considerable Reputation: He began very early to apply himself to the Stage as an <HI>Actor,</HI> following the Examples of <HI>Lee</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> with our great <HI>Shakespear,</HI> and with like Success; who, tho' all excellent dra∣matic Poets, made but indifferent Actors. However, Mr. <HI>Farquhar,</HI> having the Advantage of a very good Person, tho' with a weak Voice, was never repulsed by the Audience; but the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation: Playing the Part of <HI>Guyomar</HI> in the <HI>Indian Emperor,</HI> who is sup∣posed to kill <HI>Vasquez,</HI> one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gene∣rals; not remembring to change his Sword for a <HI>Foil</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foils</HI> are the Name of those Swords us'd in the <HI>The∣atre,</HI> with the Edges ground off, and a blunted Point.</NOTE>, in the Mock Engagement, he wounded the Person that represented <HI>Vasquez,</HI> tho' (as it
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
fell out) not dangerously; nevertheless, it put an End to his appearing on the Stage as an Actor.</P>
<P>He was very young when he wrote his first Comedy of <HI>Love and a Bottle,</HI> acted at the The∣atre Royal in <HI>Drury-lane</HI> 1698. He was pecu∣liarly happy in the Choice of his Subjects, which he took Care to adorn with Variety of Characters and Incidents. He lash'd the Vices of the Age, tho' with a merciful Hand. His Plays were wrote in the following Order:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Love and a Bottle, 1698.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Constant Couple, 1700. This Piece was play'd 53 Nights the first Season.</ITEM>

<ITEM>7. The Beaux Stratagem, 1710. 10 Nights.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(All acted at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane.)</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
His last Comedy he wrote in six Weeks, with a settled Illness all the Time. He perceived the Approaches of Death before he had finish'd the last Act, and (as he had often foretold) died before the Run of the Play was over. It was affirm'd, by some of his near Acquaintance, his unfortunate Marriage shorten'd his Days; for his Wife (by whom he had two Daughters), through the Reputation of a great Fortune, trick'd him into Matrimony. This was chiefly
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
the Fault of her Love, which was so violent, that she was resolv'd to use all Arts to gain him. Tho' some Husbands, in such a Case, would have proved mere Husbands; yet he was so much charm'd with her Love and Un∣derstanding, that he liv'd very happy with her. Therefore when I say an unfortunate Marriage, with other Circumstances, conduced to the shortening of his Days; I only mean, that his Fortune, being too slender to support a Family, led him into a great many Cares and Inconve∣niencies: For I have often heard him say <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s own Words.</NOTE>, <Q>That it was more Pain to him in imagining that his Family might want a needful Sup∣port, than the most violent Death that could be inflicted on him <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was a Person of infinite Humour, as I have been inform'd, even in his last Indisposition. He died in the Run of the <HI>Stratagem.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> often vi∣sited him in his Illness. In one of these Visits, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> told Mr. <HI>Farquhar,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs. <HI>Sullen,</HI> in giving her to <HI>Archer</HI> without a proper Divorce, which was not a Security for her Honour. <HI>To salve that,</HI> re∣ply'd the Author, <HI>I'll get a real Divorce—Marry her my∣self, and give her my Bond she shall be a real Widow in less than a Fortnight.</HI> While Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was in <HI>Tri∣nity</HI> College, <HI>Dublin,</HI> he sent to a Gentleman to borrow <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>History of the Reformation;</HI> but the Gentleman sent him Word he never lent any Book out of his Cham∣ber; but, if he would come there, he should make use of it as long as he pleas'd. A little While after, the Owner of the Book sent to borrow Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Bellows; he return'd him the Compliment—<HI>I never lend my Bellows out of my own Chamber; but if he pleas'd to come there, be should make use of them as long as he would.</HI> When he expir'd, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> took Care to bury him decently in <HI>St. Martin in the Fields.</HI> Among his Papers he found this short Note:</P>

<HEAD>Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I never had the Fortune to be present at this Gentleman's public Performance, I cannot pretend to be a competent Judge of his Merit; tho', I must own, I have heard him launch out into <HI>Mimicry,</HI> which might perhaps give Pleasure to others, but, I must own, very little to me.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="160"/>
I remember an Instance of this kind of <HI>Sa∣tire</HI> in my Youth, that gave Satisfaction to some light Hearts, but greater Disgust to the more judicious Sort of the Audience.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George Powell,</HI> a reputable Actor, with many Excellencies, gave out, that he would perform the Part of Sir <HI>John Falstaff</HI> in the Manner of that very excellent <HI>English Roscius,</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI> He certainly hit his Manner, and Tone of Voice; yet, to make the Picture more like, he mimick'd the Infirmities of Di∣stemper, old Age, and the afflicting Pains of the Gout, which that great Man was often seiz'd with. Certainly <HI>Mimicry</HI> is a Gift from Nature, and laudable, if made use of like the antient <HI>Mimes,</HI> who could dumbly describe every Passion of the Mind, and tell a <HI>Tale</HI> with∣out a <HI>Tongue:</HI> But to mimic the Infirmities of Nature, may well be term'd Incivility, Barba∣rity, and Inhumanity.</P>
<P>I remember <HI>D'Urfey,</HI> the late <HI>Lyric</HI> Poet, stuttered extremely when in a Passion, tho' he could speak an Oration, read a Scene in a Play, or sing any of his own Songs or Dialogues, without the least Hesitation. He came one Morning to the Rehearsal a little disturbed about a depending Benefit Play, and ask'd, in a Passion, <HI>Wh, wh, where wa, wa, was M, M, Mr.</HI> Wi, Wilks? The Drole <HI>Penkethman</HI> answered, <HI>H, h, he d, d, did n, n, not kn, kn, know.</HI> But the choleric Poet broke his Head for his Joke, and it was with great Difficulty the Bard was appeased.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161"/>
<HI>Mimicry,</HI> as it now stands with us, is like a Statue, larger than the Life, made for a cer∣tain Height and Distance; while upon the Level with you, its coarse Proportion seems monstrous, and overdone. Many excellent Comedians have had this natural Talent. Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> that great Critic, tells us, that Mr. <HI>Mountford</HI> was so excellently gifted that Way (if we may call it Excellence), that when he was Train-bearer to the late Chancellor <HI>Jefferies,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, at an Entertainment for the most eminent Lawyers, his Master ordered him to come before him, and plead a feigned Cause, which he perform'd with great Eloquence; and in his Pleadings, to the Admiration of all present, assum'd the Manner and Voice of several of the best Pleaders then at the <HI>Bar,</HI> even some of those that were pre∣sent at the Entertainment. As I said before, every thing of this kind must be over-done, to make it the more ridiculous; and Actors of great Merit, <HI>thus</HI> mimick'd, are liable to some little Disgrace, which is neither Justice nor Good-nature. I have seen Faces painted in a Scene of a Multitude, which is generally used in <HI>Drury lane</HI> Theatre at the Coronation of <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> that make most ridiculous Fi∣gures, so like to be known; and yet the Per∣sons they represent have nothing particularly faulty in their Countenance or Figures. But the Painter was a merry <HI>Italian</HI> Wag, and did it to shew his exuberant Fancy.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="162"/>
But to return to Mr. <HI>Foote.</HI> He is a Gen∣tleman of a good Family, and seems to have some Claim to the Estate of the <HI>Goodieres.</HI> One of that Family was, not many Years past, murdered by his own Brother at <HI>Bristol.</HI> I believe he has <HI>Merit,</HI> or a <HI>Wou'd-be-Wit</HI> would not have publish'd the following Lines in the News-papers: For, I have observed, those that have Merit, are generally liable to bespattering Defamation. However, here are the Lines.</P>

<P>I Cannot tell when Mrs. <HI>Furnival</HI> first com∣menced Actress; but I know her Reputa∣tion for a Stage-performer was so great, that a Person of high Birth and Station, who had seen her act several capital Parts at the Theatre in <HI>York,</HI> prevail'd on the Manager of <HI>Drury-lane</HI> to send for her in the Year 1737. Accordingly, I received a Commission for that Purpose, which she approved of. The first Part she acted, at her Arrival in <HI>London,</HI> was that of the <HI>Scornful Lady,</HI> in a Comedy of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s that bears the Title. I own it was a Character of my own choosing, and for no other Reason, but that the Play had slept since the Death of the inimitable Mrs. <HI>Oldfield.</HI> The Success did not intirely answer the Mean∣ing of my Intention, tho' she acquitted herself so well, that there was a very good Actress in Prospect.

<P>THIS complete Actor was born, in <HI>Staf∣fordshire,</HI> of an antient Family in that County; had a genteel Education, and was, by his Father, design'd for the Law. I doubt not, from his good Sense and Affability, if he had continued in that honourable Society in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> but he might have made a con∣siderable Figure at the Bar, and, by his Elo∣cution, walk'd in the foremost Rank of emi∣nent Orators.</P>
<P>His Genius led him early to study Nature, and leave the crabbed Tracts of the Law. His facetious good Humour gained him Entrance behind the Scenes, two or three Years, in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> before he commenced Actor; where his excellent Understanding could pro∣fit by the Faults of others, mend them, and improve the Beauties.</P>
<P>In the Year 1740. he set out, in full Lustre, at the Theatre in <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> with the Part of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third; and, by the Force of Attraction, drew even the Court to the
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
farthest Suburbs of <HI>London.</HI> After making that remote Part of the Town as familiar to Courtiers and Quality, as <HI>Wapping</HI> to Sailors; he came, with a Blaze of Light, to <HI>Drury-lane;</HI> where he began with an Act of Charity worthy of his Humanity and Goodness, by assisting the Widow of Mr. <HI>Harper</HI> with a Sum, that, by good Management, will make her Circumstances easy the rest of her Life.

<HEAD>THOMAS GRIFFITH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>IS descended from an antient Family in <HI>Wales.</HI> His Parents came to settle in <HI>Dublin,</HI> where this Son was born in the Year 1680. He was put 'Prentice to a Mathema∣tical Instrument-maker; but a lively-spirited Genius made him cast his Thoughts towards the Theatre, when he saw a young Actress that had sufficient Charms to engage his Heart. The Passion of Love is not to be controuled in Youth. He marry'd her before he had serv'd a Third Part of his Time, quitting his Ma∣thematical Master, and bent his Thoughts in∣tirely to the Drama. His Talent led him to Comedy, of the merry Cast, in which he gave great Pleasure to the Audience.</P>
<P>His Wit and facetious Humour gained him many Friends, of the best Sort, and superior Rank. In the Year 1710. the late Lord <HI>South∣well</HI> gave him a Post in the Revenue, which he enjoyed till Death, which fell out in <HI>January</HI> 24. 1743-4. in his grand Climacteric, two Days before the Night of his Benefit; which was performed for the Widow, his second Wife, who was Daughter to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Foxcroft,</HI> of <HI>Portarlington</HI> in the <HI>Queen's County,</HI> a Gen∣tlewoman of Merit and Virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Griffith</HI> was not only a good Actor, but a pleasing Poet, in what he attempted: His Person was well made, tho' low in Stature. I have seen a Bill of mock <HI>Alexander</HI> runs thus:</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">

<HEAD>The Part of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> to be per∣form'd by <HI>little Griffith.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He was an excellent Companion, and told a Story with a peculiar Grace; and would often tell little Histories of <HI>himself,</HI> even in Ridicule of <HI>himself.</HI> I shall mention one I had from his own Mouth.</P>
<P>After his commencing Actor, he contracted a Friendship with Mr. <HI>Wilks;</HI> which Chain re∣mained unbroke till the Death of that excel∣lent Comedian. Tho' Mr. <HI>Griffith</HI> was very young, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> took him with him to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and had him enter'd for that Season at a small Salary. The <HI>Indian Emperor</HI> being or∣dered on a sudden to be play'd, the Part of <HI>Pizarro,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was wanting, which Mr. <HI>Griffith</HI> procur'd, with some Difficulty. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> being a little indisposed, would not venture out to Rehearsal, for Fear of increasing his Indisposition, to the Disappointment of the Audience, who had not seen our young Stripling rehearse. But, when he came ready, at the Entrance, his Ears were pierc'd with a Voice not familiar to him: He cast his Eyes upon the Stage, where he beheld the diminutive <HI>Pizarro,</HI> with a Truncheon as long as him∣self (his own Words). He steps up to <HI>Downs</HI> the Prompter, and cry'd, <HI>Zounds,</HI> Downs! <HI>what sucking Scaramouch have you sent on there? Sir,</HI> reply'd <HI>Downs, He's good enough for a</HI> Spaniard; <HI>the Part is small. Betterton</HI> re∣turn'd,
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
<HI>If he had made his Eye-brows his Whiskers, and each Whisker a Line, the Part would have been two Lines too much for such a Monkey in Buskins.</HI> Poor <HI>Griffith</HI> stood on the Stage, near the Door, and heard every Syllable of the short Dialogue, and by his Fears, knew who was meant by it; but, happy for him, he had no more to speak that Scene. When the first Act was over (by the Advice of <HI>Downs)</HI> he went to make his Excuse, with—<HI>Indeed, Sir, I had not taken the Part, but there was only I alone out of the Play. I! I</HI>! (reply'd <HI>Betterton,</HI> with a Smile) <HI>Thou art but the Tittle of an I. Griffith</HI> seeing him in no ill Humour, told him, <HI>Indians</HI> ought to be the best Figures on the Stage, as Nature had made them. <HI>Very like,</HI> reply'd <HI>Betterton; but it would be a double Death to an</HI> Indian <HI>Cobler to be conquer'd by such a Weazle of a</HI> Spaniard <HI>as thou art! And, after this Night, let me never see a Truncheon in thy Hand again, unless to stir the Fire.</HI> This Story, as I said before, was of his own telling. However, he took his Advice, laid aside the <HI>Buskin,</HI> and stuck to the <HI>Sock,</HI> in which he made a Figure equal to most of his Cotemporaries.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. HENRY GIFFARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is descended from an antient Family, originally in <HI>Bucking∣hamshire.</HI> His Father had a numerous Issue, he being the last of Eight Sons. He was born in <HI>London,</HI> in 1699. In the Year 1716. he was made a Clerk to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; in which Post he remained Three Years. But having a strong Propensity to the Stage, he first appeared in Public on the Theatre in <HI>Bath,</HI> in 1719. and, in two Years Probation, he made such a Progress, that the Manager of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Theatre invited him to join his Company, where he continued two Years more: From thence he went to try his Fortune in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where his Merit soon brought him into the Management.</P>
<P>During his Stay there, he marry'd the Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Lydal,</HI> Persons that made very good Figures in the Theatre. This Gentlewoman died in Child-bed very young, leaving behind her one Son, born in his Fa∣ther's House on the <HI>North-Strand,</HI> who is now an Actor in this Kingdom. Some Years after Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> marry'd a second Wife, who is now alive. She has an amiable Person, and is a well-esteemed Actress, both in Tragedy and Comedy; born, if am not misinformed by her Mother, the Widow <HI>Lydal,</HI> in the Year 1711.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="174"/>
Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and Spouse, if I mistake not, came over to <HI>England</HI> 1730. where they sup∣ported a Company of Comedians, then under the Management of Mr. <HI>Odell,</HI> now Deputy-Licenser of Plays under the Lord Chamberlain his Grace the Duke of <HI>Grafton.</HI> Mr. <HI>Odell,</HI> from not understanding the Management of a Company (as, indeed, how should any one, that is not, in some sort, brought up to that Know∣lege?) soon left it to Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> that did; who, in the Year 1733. caused to be built an intire, new, beautiful, convenient Theatre, by the same Architect with that of <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> where Dramatic Pieces were performed with the utmost Elegance and Propriety. Some Years after he was obliged to quit that The∣atre (I may say by Oppression), and occupy'd the vacant Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields:</HI> But his Success did not answer his Merit. From thence he transplanted himself into the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>

full two Years, sighing, at great Expence, before he was suffered to declare his Passion publicly. Yet, certainly he possessed most of the Requisites that compound a good Actor, to assure Success. But the Managers of those Theatrical Days were very cautious in their Proceedings; no Persons were fit for <HI>their</HI> Stages, without a visible Appearance, at least, of not displeasing. And yet it was with some Difficulty he gained Permission to personate Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> in the <HI>Earl of Essex;</HI> but he came off so well, that, the following Pay-Day, he received a Week's Salary, the usual Stipend of young Actors (Ten Shillings a Week); but, unluckily, the Death of good Queen <HI>Mary</HI> put a Stop to their Acting for near Six Months. However, when Permis∣sion was given to open the Theatres again, Mr. <HI>Husband</HI> soon gained better Parts, and a larger Salary.</P>

A Character he bore with Justice. <HI>Jo,</HI> by the following Account of himself, must have been very young on the Stage. He entered a Volunteer on board the Ship where the Duke of <HI>York</HI> commanded in the Chanel, in that memorable Sea-Engagement with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, commanded (I think) by <HI>Van Tromp,</HI> in the Year 1673.

One Night, as he was repeating the Part of <HI>Alexander,</HI> with his wooden Repre∣sentative of <HI>Clytus</HI> (an old Elbow-Chair), and coming to the Speech where the old General is to be kill'd, this young mock <HI>Alexander</HI> snatch'd a <HI>Poker</HI> instead of a <HI>Javelin,</HI> and threw it with such Strength against poor <HI>Cly∣tus,</HI> that the Chair was kill'd upon the Spot, and lay mangled on the Floor. The Death of <HI>Clytus</HI> made a monstrous Noise, which disturbed the Master in the Parlour, who called out to know the Reason; and was an∣swered by the Cook below, <HI>Nothing, Sir, but that</HI> Alexander <HI>has kill'd</HI> Clytus.</P>
<P>His Master, Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> was a Person of extraordinary Talents, very pleasing in Conversation, and could extract Gold from Dirt.

<HEAD>Mr. WILLIAM MILWARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was born at <HI>Lichfield</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> the 29th of <HI>September</HI> in the Year 1702. His Great Grandfather Sir <HI>Thomas Milward</HI> was Chief Justice of <HI>West-Chester,</HI> and raised a Troop of Horse in De∣fence
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
of that unhappy Monarch King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and was then a County Palatine, which occasioned the <HI>Rump Parliament</HI> in the Year 1659. to vote their Charter void; and I do not find it ever restor'd. The Family were originally from <HI>Derbyshire.</HI> The Father of our Actor, a few Years after the Birth of his Son, removed to <HI>Uttoxeter</HI> (commonly called <HI>Tociter</HI>) in the County of <HI>Stafford,</HI> distant from <HI>London</HI> 126 measured Miles, formerly a Colony of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>He had his Education in a School of that Town, accounted one of the best in that Part of the Country. At fifteen his Father brought him to <HI>London,</HI> where he was put Apprentice to an eminent Apothecary in <HI>Norfolk-street</HI> in the <HI>Strand;</HI> but he has often declared, <HI>there were so many Dangers in the Employment,</HI> that he could never like it. The following Acci∣dent made him determine to leave it.</P>
<P><Q>He was ordered by his Master to carry his Prescriptions to a Gentleman and Lady ill of different Maladies at the same time; the Labels were wrong directed, but he did not discover this Mistake till the next Day, when he carried other Medicines to the same Persons, and by his Judgment in the O∣peration soon found out the Mistake. He was greatly terrified, but for fear of more, he let fall the Phial he had in his Hand, as by Accident, ran back to his Master, and told him what had been done. The Mas∣ter
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
ordered more proper Doses, the Pati∣ents recovered, and all was well</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milward</HI>'s first Essay in Acting was among young Gentlemen, privately, for their own Diversion. In a small time after he mixt with a Country Company of Comedians, where his Merit shone so bright, that it open'd the Eyes of the Manager in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> with whom he rose in that Theatre, and <HI>Co∣vent-Garden,</HI> to be placed in the foremost Rank of Perfection. He died in the 40th Year of his Age, in the very Meridian of an Actor, then belonging to the Theatre in <HI>Drury-lane.</HI></P>

I never knew him under∣take any Part, but, as in Painting, I found some Strokes of Nature that gave fresh Touches to the Picture he was drawing.</P>

He rose gradually in the Theatrical Corps, like the late Northern Star of <HI>Russia,</HI> till he came to be chief Leader; he regularly gained the Topmast Step, and now is seated in the Throne of Perfection, dispensing Laws to that Part of the Province where the SOCK is worn, where he reigns sole Monarch, and de∣servedly so, since with long laborious Pains he has found out the true Rule of Reigning. <HI>Shy∣lock</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> in the Merchant of <HI>Venice,</HI> is so immitably counterfeited, that we cannot say more than what a Gentleman said <HI>extempore</HI> on seeing him perform the Part:

<P>MAY (by her Judgment and Execution in the Parts she undertakes) be equally ranked with the first Class of Actresses, and, in some Articles, lead the Way.

<P>His first Trial of Skill was at the Theatre in the <HI>Hay-market</HI> (commonly called the <HI>French House),</HI> where he gave such Strokes of Judg∣ment that alarmed his best Antagonists. From his beginning Encouragement he was solicited to add a promising Member to the Company of <HI>Bath,</HI> where there is a regular Theatre, and an Audience as difficult to be pleas'd as that in <HI>London,</HI> being generally Persons of the highest Rank that frequent those Diversions in the Ca∣pital. He had the good Fortune to give Sa∣tisfaction there, insomuch that several Persons of Distinction and Taste promised to recom∣mend him to one of the establish'd Theatres in <HI>London:</HI> But a Company that Season set∣ting out for <HI>Ireland,</HI> he was resolv'd to ac∣company them, and cultivate his Genius in this Kingdom. His Knowlege in Music is some Addition to his Merit, and in his Walk of Acting he may keep Pace with the best on both Sides the Water.</P>
<P>I never saw Mrs. <HI>Mynitt</HI> perform any Part; but as she has an amiable Person, and excellent Voice, I have taken it upon Trust, that she is an agreeable Actress both in Tragedy and Comedy. But the Bulk of the Letters in the Bills are the distinguished Characteristics of

Merit.

<HEAD>Mr. HENRY NORRIS (alias JUBILEE DICKY).</HEAD>
<P>THIS natural Comedian was born in <HI>Sa∣lisbury Court</HI> in 1665. near the Spot where the Theatre was afterwards erected that went by the Name of <HI>Dorset-Garden</HI> Theatre, it being in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Days the Gar∣dens of the Palace belonging to the Earl of <HI>Dorset.</HI> He play'd on the <HI>Irish</HI> Stage in 1695 Tho' a diminutive Figure, there were many Parts that he excelled in, <HI>viz. Barnaby Brittle</HI> in the <HI>Wanton Wife,</HI> &amp;c. I remember when Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> was in his Decline, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made some Alterations in the Play, and per∣form'd the Part himself; Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> tha of Mrs. <HI>Brittle.</HI> But she complain'd she couk not perform it with that Spirit with him, as she did with little <HI>Norris</HI> (as she call'd him). When asked her the Reason, she reply'd, <HI>Cuckold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> did not sit so easy on</HI> Cibber<HI>'s Figure as it di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

<HI>upon that of</HI> Norris<HI>'s, who seem'd form'd by Nature to be one.</HI></P>
<P>The Mother of this little great <HI>Comedian</HI> was one of the first Women that came on the Stage as an Actress; for some Time after the Resto∣ration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second young smooth-fac'd Men perform'd the Womens Parts. That humourous Monarch, coming be∣fore his usual Time to <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Hamlet,</HI> sent the facetious Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> to know the Reason of their Delay; who brought Word back, That the <HI>Queen was not quite shav'd. Ods Fish</HI> (his usual Expression), <HI>I beg her Majesty's Pardon! we'll wait till her</HI> Barber <HI>has done with her.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> married Mrs. <HI>Knapton,</HI> the Sister of the late Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s first Wife, by whom he had several Children. The Females are since dead, and resembled the Mother in Sta∣ture, she being a very personable Woman; but the Sons copied the Father, our <HI>Jubilee Dicky,</HI> which Nickname came for his inimi∣table humourous Performance of a Part so called in <HI>The Constant Couple; or, A Trip to the Jubilee.</HI></P>
<P>He spoke Tragedy exceedingly knowing in the different Passions, tho' he never perform'd any Part of the serious Cast: for, notwith∣standing his Judgment, on the <HI>London</HI> Theatres his Figure must have made the Sentiments ri∣diculous. After the Death of that celebrated Author Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> the merry Mr. <HI>Penketh∣man,</HI>

at his Theatre at <HI>Richmond</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There are two <HI>Richmonds</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> one in <HI>York∣shire,</HI> that gives the Title to that illustrious Family; the other <HI>Richmond</HI> is Ten Miles from <HI>London.</HI> It may rank with some Cities in <HI>England</HI> for its Extent, but I know of none that can equal it in its fine Situation upon the noble River <HI>Thames,</HI> its healthful Air, beautiful va∣rious Prospects from the Hill, and its increasing noble Buildings.</NOTE>, play'd the Tragedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> or, rather, defil'd those no∣ble Sentiments of Liberty, out of such merry Mouths. <HI>Norris</HI> was ridiculously dressed for <HI>Cato, Penkethman Juba,</HI> low Comedians for the other Characters, and the two Ladies sup∣plied by Men of the same Cast: Yet a blind Man might have borne with <HI>Norris</HI> in the <HI>Ro∣man Patriot,</HI> for he spoke it with all the So∣lemnity of a suffering Hero; while <HI>Penketh∣man,</HI> and the rest of the motley Tribe, made it as ridiculous by Humour and Action: And yet some of the first Rank in the Kingdom seemed highly diverted, whilst others invoked the <HI>Manes</HI> of the dead <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Briton</HI> to rise, and avenge their own Cause. I remember the next Morning the following four Lines were pasted on the Door of the Playhouse:</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> died in the 69th Year of his Age.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE find, by the News-papers, you in∣tend to give us the <HI>History of the Stage.</HI> It is desir'd by several, that you would be pleased to add Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> to the Number (tho' we are all assured she never was in this Kingdom). We know the Task is in your Power; and you will oblige many that have a Regard for you.</P>

Every Art has its Origin, but, when brought to full Perfection, it is often in Danger of de∣caying, and, sometimes, of being quite lost in Oblivion. Painting on <HI>Glass,</HI> in this Age, is but a faint Copy of our Forefathers in that Art; and the perdurable Cement of our an∣tient <HI>Castles,</HI> &amp;c. is now unknown. The Sun sets to rise again, but <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Light is lost for ever.</P>
<P>I was too young to view her first Dawn on the Stage, but yet had the infinite Satisfaction of her Meridian Lustre, a Glow of Charms not to be beheld but with a trembling Eye! which held her Influence till set in Night.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> (as I have been informed by herself) brought her first to shine in Public. He accidentally, at a Tavern kept by a near Relation of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s, heard a Person reading a Comedy in a Room behind the Bar, with such a just Vivacity, and Humour of the Characters, as gave him infinite Surprize, and Satisfaction. His Curiosity was too prevalent to observe the Height of good Manners; therefore he made a Pretence to go into the Room, where he was struck dumb, for some Time, with her Figure, and blooming Beauty; but was more astonish'd at her Discourse, and sprightly Wit. Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> press'd her to pursue her Amusement, but was obliged to de∣part without that Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was, at that Time, in <HI>Ireland;</HI> therefore he took some Pains to acquaint Sir
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
<HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> (who had some Share in the Theatre) with the Jewel he had found thus by Accident. It was some Time before she would be prevailed upon; tho' she has merrily told me, <HI>I long'd to be at it, and only wanted a little decent Intreaties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alinda,</HI> in the <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> was the first Part she was taken Notice of in, which Sir <HI>John Van∣brugh</HI> alter'd and reviv'd upon her Account; which is a Character of different Species of Passions and Variety; where she charm'd the Play into a Run of many succeeding Nights.</P>
<P>I remember, in her full Round of Glory in Comedy, she used to slight Tragedy. She would often say, <HI>I hate to have a Page dragging my Tail about. Why do they not give</HI> Porter <HI>these Parts? She can put on a better Tragedy Face than I can.</HI> When <HI>Mithridates</HI> was re∣vived, it was with much Difficulty she was pre∣vail'd upon to take the Part; but she perform'd it to the utmost Length of Perfection, and, after that, she seem'd much better reconcil'd to Tragedy. What a majestical Dignity in <HI>Cleo∣patra</HI>! and, indeed, in every Part that required it: Such a finish'd Figure on the Stage, was never yet seen. In <HI>Calista,</HI> the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> she was inimitable, in the Third Act, with <HI>Ho∣ratio,</HI> when she tears the Letter, with</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>—To Atoms! thus!</L>
<L>Thus let me tear the vile detested Falshood,</L>
<L>The wicked lying Evidence of Shame!</L>

Her excellent clear Voice of Passion, her piercing flaming Eye, with Manner and Action suiting, us'd to make me shrink with Awe, and seem'd to put her Monitor <HI>Horatio</HI> into a Mouse-hole. I almost gave him up for a troublesome Puppy; and though Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> play'd the Part of <HI>Lothario,</HI> I could hardly lug him up to the Importance of triumphing over such a finish'd Piece of Perfection, that seemed to be too much dignified to lose her Virtue.</P>
<P>Even her Amours seemed to lose that Glare which appears round the Persons of the failing Fair; neither was it ever known, that she trou∣bled the Repose of any Lady's lawful Claim; and was far more constant than Millions in the conjugal Noose.</P>
<P>She was of a superior Height, but with a lovely Proportion; and the Dignity of her Soul, equal to her Form and Stature, made up of benevolent Charity, affable and good-natur'd to all that deserv'd it. Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> Son to the Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> when he was persecuted by his unnatural Mother, received from her ever∣giving bountiful Hand, Fifty Pounds a Year during her Life; and she was, with Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> a main Means in saving him from an ignomi∣nious End.</P>
<P>The Part of <HI>Sophonisba,</HI> a Tragedy (by Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> famed for many excellent Poems), was reputed the Cause of her Death; for, in her Execution, she went beyond Wonder, to Astonishment! From that Time her Decay
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
came slowly on, and never left her till it con∣ducted her to eternal Rest, the 23d of <HI>October</HI> 1730. She left several charitable Legacies, and very handsome Fortunes to her two Sons. But let us see what better Writers say of this Phoenix of the Stage. O! that we might have another from her Ashes!</P>
<P>You may read, if you please, what a <HI>French</HI> Author has wrote on this inimitable Actress, as well as some Touches on our <HI>English Drama.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Sir <HI>Roger Mostings,</HI> Baronet, was passion∣ately in Love with a famous Actress called Mrs. <HI>Oldfield;</HI> and, notwithstanding her In∣difference, and even bad Usage, could not be cur'd—He being at Supper with us when his Disgrace and Banishment were no∣tified to him, his greatest Concern was for his Mistress, whom he must abandon: His Grief and Love made him shed Tears. His Order bore, That he should retire to his Estate the next Day; and therefore, as the last Remedy for his Love, he proposed in∣stant Marriage to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> which pro∣duced no other Effect than a mortifying Re∣fusal <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">We may gather, from this Author, that the Passage mention'd was in the Year 1715. when the Rebel Lords suffer'd Death, and Lord <HI>Nithisdale</HI> made his Escape from the <HI>Tower,</HI> disguised by his Lady in her Habit. Sir <HI>Ro∣ger Mostings,</HI> then Commander in the Fourth Troop of Life-guards, spoke too freely in Favour of the imprison'd Noblemen that were concern'd in the Rebellion, and therefore was order'd to leave the Court, and retire to his Estate; as also the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Ailes∣ford,</HI> the Lords <HI>Finche</HI> and <HI>Guernsey,</HI> my Lord <HI>Portmore,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> Lord <HI>Windsor,</HI> and many others; all depriv'd of their Posts and Places, with the same Or∣ders to retire to their Estates. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was esteemed one of the handsomest Men in the Kingdom, witty, well∣bred, and had a great Estate; which proves that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> despised Interest, and would not give her Hand without her Heart.</NOTE>. This amiable Woman was admitted,
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
with Pleasure, into the Company of Ladies of the first Rank for Birth and Virtue; who seemed to take her Visits as an Honour done them. It must be owned, she is an incomparable sweet Girl! She reconciled me to the <HI>English</HI> Stage. Her Voice, her Shape, and all her Actions, so charm'd me, that I made the more Haste to learn the Language, that I might understand her.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> are passionately fond of Dra∣matic Entertainments, and I doubt if <HI>France</HI> can produce so many excellent Works of this kind as <HI>Britain;</HI> and I have seen some superior to <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI> They have their <HI>Shakespear, Dryden, Otway, Congreve, Cibber, Farquhar,</HI> and a numerous Train of excellent Tragic and Comic Poets; that have the Force of moving the Soul, with their Energy of Sentiments and Expression, far beyond the Antients.</P></Q>
<P>I shall conclude this Account with an Abs∣tract of a Copy of Verses wrote by Mr. <HI>Sa∣vage,</HI> illegitimate Son to Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> tho' the Author of that unfortunate Gentleman's Life seems to deny it; I suppose, because his

<P>IN the Remembrance of many, was once on the Stage in this Kingdom, to his no small Terror: For a Storm at Sea, he told me, frighten'd him so much, that the Anxiety of returning dwelt so strongly on his Mind, that he could not appear half himself to the Pub∣lic; and, to lessen his Sea-voyage back again, he went to <HI>Dunaghadee,</HI> in the North of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> and embark'd for <HI>Scotland;</HI> verifying the old Proverb, <HI>The farthest Way about, is the nearest Way home.</HI></P>

<P>THIS extraordinary Person was born in <HI>Wales,</HI> tho' he never knew one Word of his Mother-tongue; neither did I ever hear of the School-mistress that taught him <HI>English:</HI> Yet he got perfect in two Parts, and perform'd them both with Applause; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Welsh Col∣lier</HI> in the <HI>Recruiting Officer,</HI> and the <HI>Drunken Colonel</HI> in the <HI>Intriguing Chambermaid:</HI> But

his great Talent lay in the <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Panto∣mimes.</HI> Tho' the Art does not require much Rhetoric, yet they should have <HI>Heads,</HI> as well as <HI>Heels.</HI></P>
<P>He was taught Tumbling, and Slight of Hand, by that great Master of Arts, the stu∣pendous Mr. <HI>Faux,</HI> and out-did his Master in several Tricks; and was very happy at Inven∣tion, in escaping to <HI>Ireland</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">This great Man was taken up in <HI>London</HI> for Suspi∣cion of Debt, and dealt with the honest Officer in the following Manner: He first call'd for Liquor in abun∣dance, and treated all about him, to the no small Joy of the Bailiff, who was rejoiced to have a Calf that bled so well (as they term it). <HI>Harlequin</HI> made the honest Bailiff believe he had six Dozen of Wine ready pack'd up, which he would send for, to drink while in Custody, and like∣wise allow him Six-pence a Bottle for drinking it in his own Chamber. Shoulder-dab listen'd to the Proposal with Pleasure: The Bailiff went to the Place, as directed, and return'd with Joy, to hear that it should be sent in the Morning early. Accordingly, it came by a Porter, sweating under his Load: The Turnkey call'd to his Master, and told him, the Porter and Hamper were come in: <HI>Very well,</HI> says he, <HI>then let nothing but the Porter and Hamper out.</HI> The Porter perform'd his Part very well; came heavily in with an empty Hamper, and seem'd to go lightly out, with <HI>Philips</HI> on his Back. He was dis∣hamper'd at an Alehouse near the Water-side, cross'd the <HI>Thames,</HI> and, soon after, embark'd for <HI>Ireland.</HI> He was very fond of this Trick, and would take Pride in his Project, which was contriv'd long before he was taken, to be ready on such an Emergency. When this Scheme was concerted with the Porter, he made this threatening Speech to him; <HI>G—d strike me plump</HI> (his usual Speech)! <HI>if you are not as secret as the Sun at Noon-day, I'll broil you, and eat you alive, you Dog</HI>!

<HEAD>Mr. JAMES QUIN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great and just Actor was born in <HI>King-street, Covent-garden,</HI> the 24th of <HI>February,</HI> 1693. tho' Numbers believe he owes his Birth to <HI>Ireland.</HI> His Ancestors were of an antient Family in this Kingdom: His Grand∣father, Alderman <HI>Mark Quin,</HI> was Lord Mayor of the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> in the Year 1676. in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; the Father of our <HI>Roscius</HI> received a liberal Education in <HI>Trinity</HI> College, <HI>Dublin;</HI> from thence he went over to <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn,</HI> to finish his Studies, where he was called to the Bar; but, at the Death of his Father (who left him a plentiful Estate), he returned with his Son, then an In∣fant, to take Possession.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James Quin</HI> was educated under the Care of Dr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of <HI>Dublin</HI> (a Person emi∣nent for Learning), till the Death of his Father in the Year 1710. Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> was undoubted Heir to his Estate, but through his Youth, and Inexperience of the Courts, a Suit of Law hung so long in <HI>Chancery,</HI> till he, unenabled to carry the Cause farther, was obliged to drop it, for want of proper Assistance. I am inform'd, a powerful Guider of the Law was his Anta∣gonist; and a Person has but a bad Chance to fight a Duel with a Fencing-master.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221"/>
Our eminent Actor first appeared on the Stage in old <HI>Smock-alley,</HI> in the Part of <HI>Abel</HI> in the <HI>Committee.</HI> I must take some little Pride, when I declare I imagine myself the first that persuaded him not to smother his rising Genius in this Kingdom, where, at that Time, there was no great Encouragement for Merit, and try his Fortune in <HI>London;</HI> whither, by his kind and ever-to-be-remember'd Recommendation, I soon follow'd him.</P>
<P>It is, in some sort, a Hardship to a rising Genius, in the first Entrance to a regular esta∣blish'd Company: The Parts are all supplied, and, like Under-officers in an Army, they must wait for Preserment, or do something extraor∣dinary, before they can expect it. An Acci∣dent fell out, that gave our young Actor a happy Opportunity.</P>
<P>The Managers had an Order, from the <HI>Lord Chamberlain,</HI> to revive the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> for the 4th of <HI>November</HI> 1716. which was got up with the utmost Magnificence. The third Night the late Mr. <HI>Mills</HI> (who perform'd <HI>Ba∣jazet</HI>) was taken suddenly ill, and, with much Persuasion, Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> was prevailed upon to read the Part, which was thought a great Un∣dertaking for a young Actor of his Standing; but, to the Mortification of several Competi∣tors, he succeeded so well, that the Audience gave him their general Applause, through the whole Course of the Part. The next Night he made himself perfect, and performed it with redoubled Applauses of Approbation; and was
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
complimented by several Persons of Distinction, and dramatic Taste, upon his early rising Ge∣nius.</P>
<P>But as the Theatrical World is a Picture, in Miniature, of the Great, Envy will shake her snaky Locks; People of twice his Age thought his Progress a little too rapid for their Appro∣bation. His Temper took fire at the visible Depression; he bore it some Time with Tem∣per, but the first Opportunity he engag'd with Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> where, by just Degrees, he attained the highest Round of Perfection; and (not to take any Merit from other Performers) was certainly the chief Pillar that supported all the Theatres where-ever he has performed. I will not take upon me to point out his Excellencies in any particular Part, since he is excellent in all: Therefore I shall end, with the immortal <HI>Shakespear,</HI>
<Q><L>He is a Man, take him for all in all,</L>
<L>I ne'er shall look upon his Like again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The great Honour this Gentleman has re∣ceived from the second Illustrious Person in the Kingdom, in trusting the Royal Blood to his Care, will better speak his Excellence than my weak Skill can do.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. LACY RYAN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was once in <HI>Ireland</HI> with the celebrated Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> in the Year 1741. He was born in <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1694. The first Part he was taken Notice of in, was that of <HI>Marcus</HI> in <HI>Cato,</HI> which was first acted in 1712.</P>
<P>In the Run of that celebrated Tragedy he was accidentally brought into a Fray with some of our <HI>Tritons</HI> on the <HI>Thames;</HI> and, in the Scuffle, a Blow on the Nose was given him by one of these Water-bullies, who neither regard Men nor Manners: I remember, the same Night, as he was brought on the <HI>Bier,</HI> after his suppos'd Death in the Fourth Act of <HI>Cato,</HI> the Blood, from the real Wound in the Face, gush'd out with Violence; that Hurt had no other Effect than just turning his Nose a little, tho' not to Deformity; yet some People ima∣gine it gave a very small Alteration to the Tone of his Voice, tho' nothing disagreeable. He acquitted himself in many capital Parts, both in Tragedy and Comedy, to the Satis∣faction of his Auditors; and has been ever esteemed in the first Rank of Actors.</P>
<P>Some few Years ago another unfortunate Accident befel him: As he was going home to his House after his Night's Performance, he was attack'd by a Street robber; and, making Resistance, the Villain shot a Brace of Pistol-Bullets
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
into his Mouth, which broke some Part of his Jaw: By the Help of a Lamp the Rob∣ber knew Mr. <HI>Ryan,</HI> as I have been inform'd, begg'd his Pardon for his Mistake, and ran off. Of this Hurt, too, he recover'd, after a long Illness, and play'd with Success, as before, with∣out any seeming Alteration of Voice or Face. His Royal Highness, upon this Accident, sent him a handsome Present; and others, of the Nobility, copy'd the laudable Example of the second illustrious Person in the three King∣doms. I shall say no more of Mr. <HI>Ryan,</HI> but that he is genteel, and well-made.</P>
<P>This Gentleman has made several Excur∣sions in the Region of Poetry; particularly a Piece, of one Act, call'd <HI>The Coblers Opera,</HI> which has often been performed with good Success.</P>

<P>THIS excellent Actor was born in this Kingdom, Son to that very eminent the Reverend Dr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> a Gentleman whose Memory will never be forgot, while Learning holds the Reins to check the vicious Mind, and guide us in the Paths of Virtue. Men are but human Brutes, poring in the Dark, with∣out some Light of Education. Under such a Father, and at such a Fountain of Learning as this Nursery of Erudition <HI>(Trinity</HI> College), no Wonder for our young Actor to rise in Per∣fection. He was some Time in <HI>Westminster</HI> School, and as his Mind led him to look early towards the Drama, he had the Advantage of seeing the Regularity of the <HI>British</HI> Theatres, which he does not only copy, but many, who have seen both, find the Colours and Drapery so strong, that, at this Distance, it stands in equal Goodness to the Original.</P>
<P>To this Gentleman we owe the Decency that has been long wanting on the <HI>Hibernian</HI> Stage, a Difficulty no one Person could have surmounted but himself; and tho' Merit does
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
not always meet its proper Reward, yet the Seeds of Flowers and Roots he had planted and sown in this theatrical Garden, flourish sweet and amiable, and, like a Master in the Art, Reward follows his Pains and Judgment in Culture.</P>
<P>The Unmeritorious pass unobserved, while Merit is commonly the Butt for Envy to empty her whole Quiver of poison'd Arrows at; yet they generally fall short of their in∣tended Mark.

At last <HI>Winny</HI> the Wife (that is, <HI>Win∣nifrede</HI>) put on a compos'd Countenance (but, alas! with a troubled Heart); stepp'd to a neighbouring Tavern, and bespoke a very hot <HI>Negus,</HI> to comfort <HI>Johnny</HI> in the great Part he was to perform that Night, begging to have the Silver Tankard with the Lid, be∣cause, as she said, <HI>a Covering, and the Vehicle Silver, would retain Heat longer than any other Metal.</HI> The Request was comply'd with, the <HI>Negus</HI> carry'd to the Play-house piping hot—popp'd into a vile earthen Mug—the Tankard <HI>L'argent</HI> travelled <HI>Incog.</HI> under her Apron (like the <HI>Persian</HI> Ladies veil'd), popp'd into the Pawnbroker's Hands, in exchange for the Suit—put on, and play'd its Part, with the rest of the Wardrobe; when its Duty was over, carried back to remain in its old Depo∣sitory—the Tankard return'd the right Road; and, when the Tide flow'd with its Lunar In∣fluence, the stranded Suit was wasted into safe

<HEAD>ROBERT WILKS, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THE Ancestors of this most excellent Co∣median, were seated many Ages in an affluent Inheritance at <HI>Bromsgrove</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bromsgrove</HI> is one of the chief trading Towns in the County for the finest Broad Cloths, containing about 500 well-built Houses on the Brink of the River <HI>Sal∣warp,</HI> 93 measur'd Miles from <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>in <HI>Wor∣cestershire,</HI> where most of the chief Inhabit∣ants bear the Name of <HI>Wilks.</HI></P>
<P>The Grandfather of our excellent Comedian (Judge <HI>Wilks),</HI> in the Civil Wars, rais'd a Troop of Horse, at his own Expence, for the Service of the unfortunate King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, which was commanded by Col. <HI>Wilks,</HI> Brother to the Judge, and Great Uncle to our Comedian.</P>
<P>In that unnatural War, the Family suffered greatly by Rapine and Persecution; which was the main Motive that sent <HI>Edward Wilks,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with his Wife, and the shatter'd Remains of an ample Fortune, to <HI>Dublin,</HI> for the Security of his Person, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238"/>
Our great Comedian was born at <HI>Rathfarn∣ham</HI> near <HI>Dublin,</HI> in the Year 1670. His Fa∣ther gave him a genteel Education. He wrote an excellent fine masterly Hand, with such Celerity that was surprising. His Genius re∣commended him to Secretary <HI>Southwell,</HI> who confirm'd him one of his Clerks when Eighteen Years of Age.</P>
<P>His first Inclination to the <HI>Theatre</HI> proceed∣ed from the Praises of Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> then an Actor on the <HI>Dublin</HI> Stage. Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> lodg'd near Mr. <HI>Wilks;</HI> and, being intimate with each other, he used to hold the Book of the Play, to hear if <HI>Richards</HI> was perfect in the Part he was then studying. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> used to read the introductive Speeches, with such proper Emphasis, Cadence, and all the various Passions, that the Encomiums given by Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> began to fire his Mind for the <HI>Drama.</HI> It was with very little Persua∣sion he ventured to act privately the <HI>Colonel</HI> in the <HI>Spanish Fryar,</HI> at Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI>'s, the ensuing <HI>Christmas;</HI> where he received such Approbation from that great Master, as confirm'd his Intention.</P>
<P>The first Part he played on the Theatre was <HI>Othello,</HI> with the utmost Applause; and, as he told me, pleased all but himself. He went on with great Success, for Two Years, when his Friend Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> informed me, that Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> was a very good Actor, both in Tragedy and Comedy, but not over-happy in his personal Appearance.</NOTE>advised him to try his
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
Fortune in <HI>England,</HI> and gave him Letters of Recommendation to Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> who re∣ceiv'd him very kindly, and entered him at Fifteen Shillings a Week.</P>
<P>His first Appearance on the <HI>English</HI> Stage, was in the Part of the young Prince in the <HI>Maid's Tragedy,</HI> a very insignificant Character, requiring little more than an amiable Figure. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> performed <HI>Melantius;</HI> but when that veteran Actor came to address him on the Battlements, to excuse himself for the Death of the King in the Play, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> affirmed to me, that the Dignity of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> struck him with such an Awe, that he had much ado to utter the little he had to say. Mr. <HI>Bet∣terton,</HI> observing his Confusion, said to him, <HI>Young Man, this Fear does not ill become you; a Horse that sets out at the Strength of his Speed will soon be jaded.</HI></P>
<P>However, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> soon shook off his Apprehensions, and began to rise in the Esteem of the Audience, and better Parts gained him a better Salary.</P>
<P>He often assisted Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> (an eminent Dancing-master at that time) in teaching his Scholars; and, by his genteel Address, gained the Affection of a young Lady, Daughter to <HI>Ferdinand Knapton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Steward of the New Forest in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and by Consent of the Father they were joined in Wedlock. By this Gentlewoman he had one Son and Daughter; the Son died in his Youth; the Daughter was
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
married to Captain <HI>Price</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> did not survive her Marriage above a Twelvemonth. She expired childless in the Year 1712. the 20th Year of her Age.</NOTE>, to whom he made up a Fortune of a thousand Pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Finances not well answering the State of an increasing Family, he press'd for an Addition to his Salary, which every Per∣son but the <HI>Manager</HI> thought he deserved; but his Request was not complied with.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> hearing of his Dis∣content, came over on Purpose to engage him. He agreed with Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> for Sixty Pounds a Year, and a clear Benefit, which in those Times was much more than any other Actor ever had. When he went to take his Leave of Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> the <HI>Manager</HI> was with him. That great Actor expressed some Concern at his leaving the Company. "I fansy (said Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>) that Gentleman (pointing to the Manager), if he has not too much Ob∣stinacy to own it, will be the first that re∣pents your parting; for, if I foresee aright, you will be greatly wanted here."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> told me this Speech gave him infinite Pleasure; and made him resolve to search into himself, to find out what Mr. <HI>Bet∣terton</HI>'s known Judgment seemed to promise he might find. Praise from an Adept in any Science will excite Emulation, and, with some People, do more than Reward. From this Time Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> grew more assiduous, and thought every Moment lost, that was not laid 
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
out upon his Studies, till he arrived at that su∣preme Excellence, even now remembered by innumerable Judges of the <HI>Drama.</HI></P>
<P>It was not long before the prophetic Words of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> were fulfilled. For the unfor∣tunate Death of <HI>Mountford</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. <HI>William Mountford</HI> was accounted an excellent Comedian; and Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> often confess'd, he was the Glass that he ever adjusted himself by.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mountford</HI> was basely murder'd by a Thrust thro' the Back, while a false Friend held him in his Arms with a treacherous Embrace, in <HI>Norfolk-street</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> in the Year 1692. He was the Author of the following Plays.</P>
<P>1. Injur'd Love, or, The Ambitious Father. A Tragedy, 1688.</P>
<P>2. The Successful Strangers. A Comedy, 1690.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Greenwich</HI> Park. A Comedy, 1691.</P>
<P>4. The Life and Death of Dr. <HI>Faustus,</HI> 1691. with the Humours of <HI>Harlequin</HI> and <HI>Scaramouch.</HI> An Enter∣tainment of Three Acts.</P></NOTE>
was the Sickness of all their genteel Comedies, till his Parts could be supplied. Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> therefore, was immediately sent to, with Proposals of Four Pounds a Week; which was a Salary equal to Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI> This was too advantageous an Offer to be refused; therefore he prepared for his Journey privately. Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> was so unwilling to part with him, that he procured an Order from the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> (then Lord Lieutenant) to prevent his going; but a par∣ticular Friend giving him timely Notice there∣of, he went secretly to <HI>Hoath,</HI> where a Boat waited to convey him on board, and he landed safe in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242"/>
The first Part he performed of <HI>Mountford</HI>'s was <HI>Palamede</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> has, from this Play of <HI>Marriage Ala∣mode,</HI> and the Comedy Part of <HI>Secret Love,</HI> or the <HI>Mai∣den Queen,</HI> compounded (with some Ingredients of his own) an excellent Comedy called the <HI>Comical Lovers.</HI></NOTE>in <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Marriage Alamode,</HI> a Comedy, with such extraordinary Success, as he often said, it made him almost mad with Joy. I need say no more of his Progress in Success, than that he sailed in the full Tide of Fortune, till he arrived safely to reign un∣rivalled to his Death.</P>
<P>And, as a Reward for his great Merit, he was joined in the Patent granted by Queen <HI>Anne</HI> in the Year 1709. He was also Mana∣ger of the Whole; and I shall not take from the Merit of others, when I say, From his sole Directions the Stage gained new Life, and Reward followed the Industry. For a conti∣nued Course of the Three Managers, for more than Twenty Years, the Stage was in full Perfection; their Green-Rooms <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Green-Rooms are the Chambers where the princi∣pal Performers retire, till they are called to their En∣trances where they are to go on the Stage.</NOTE>were free from Indecencies of every Kind, and might justly be compared to the most elegant Draw∣ing-Rooms of the Prime Quality: No Fops or Coxcombs ever shew'd their Monkey Tricks there; but if they chanc'd to thrust in, were aw'd into Respect; even Persons of the First Rank and Taste, of both Sexes, would of∣ten mix with the Performers, without any
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
Stain to their Honour or Understanding: And, indeed, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was so genteelly elegant in his Fancy of Dress for the Stage, that he was often followed in his Fashion, tho', in the Street, his Plainness of Habit was re∣markable.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1713-14. Mrs. <HI>Wilks</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>Mrs. <HI>Wilks</HI> was interr'd in the Church of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> with the following Inscription on her Tomb, wrote by her Husband.</P>

left this World, to the inconsolable Sorrow of her wor∣thy Husband: He continued unmarried up∣wards of Seven Years. In the mean time he renewed his Acquaintance with Mrs. <HI>Fell,</HI> Re∣lict of <HI>Charles Fell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of an antient Fa∣mily in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and married her. This Gentlewoman's maiden Name was <HI>Brown,</HI> of a reputable Family in <HI>Sussex</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">I shall relate an unfortunate Accident concerning <HI>John Brown,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Father of Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Second Wife, which he informed me of. This Gentleman lived near <HI>Spelmonden</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> on a handsome Estate. He took great Delight in Shooting. One Day he went out with his Servant to his usual Diversion; they sprung some Game that flew over a neighbouring Hedge; he ordered his Servant to follow and observe them on the other Side, while he would take care on the Side where he was. The Hedge was of great Extent, and Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> went slowly by the Side, in Expectation of the Game; at last they came, and he fired. The Servant on the other Side of the Hedge did the same, and un∣fortunately shot his Master in the Face, only with Two Grains of Shot; but, alas! one in each Eye, that for ever deprived him of Sight! Yet Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> inform'd me, he was as chearful a Gentleman as ever he con∣versed with; and would lead him to every particular Fruit-tree in his large Garden, and nominate the Fruit they bore; and that very Servant, the <HI>Innocent Guilty,</HI> as he call'd him, lived with him at the Time I received this Account from Mr. <HI>Wilks.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244"/>
Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Excellence in Comedy was never once disputed, but the best Judges ex∣tol him for the different Parts in Tragedy; as <HI>Hamlet, Castalio</HI> in the <HI>Orphan, Ziphares</HI> in <HI>Mithridates, Edgar</HI> in King <HI>Lear, Norfolk</HI> in the <HI>Albion Queens, Piercy</HI> in <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex, Shore, Macduff, Moneses</HI> in <HI>Tamerlane, Jaffeir</HI> in <HI>Venice Preserv'd;</HI> and a countless Catalogue of other Parts in Tra∣gedy, which he was allowed to perform in their full Perfection.</P>
<P>He was not only perfect in every Part he acted, but in those that were concerned with him in every Scene, which often prevented Mistakes.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="245"/>
But let me have recourse to other Pens for his Excellencies. One writes thus:</P>
<P><Q>No sooner had Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> left the <HI>Hiber∣nian</HI> Stage, and appeared on the <HI>British,</HI> but that sinking Theatre raised its drooping Head; and what was reckoned almost a Scandal to belong to, has ever since been, by that great Man's Management and Ju∣stice, raised to the greatest Theatre in the Universe.</Q> <HI>Female Tatler.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Person and Behaviour of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> in the Part of <HI>Essex,</HI> has no small Share in conducing to the Popularity of the Play.</Q> <HI>Tatler,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 14. Vol. 1.</P>
<P><Q>This Performance <HI>(The Trip to the Ju∣bilee)</HI> is the greatest Instance that we can have of the irresistible Force of proper Action. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> enters into the Part with so much Skill, that the Gallantry, the Youth, and Gaiety, of a young Man of a plentiful Fortune, is looked upon with as much Indulgence on the Stage, as in real Life.</Q> <HI>Tatler,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 19.</P>
<P>In the Preface to the same Play the Au∣thor says: "Whenever the Stage has the Misfortune to lose Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> that <HI>Wildair</HI> may go to the <HI>Jubilee.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the Preface to the <HI>Stratagem,</HI> the Author ends thus: <Q>The Reader may find some Faults in this Play, which my Illness pre∣vented the amending of; but there is great Amends made in the Representation, which cannot be matched, no more than
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
the friendly and indefatigable Care of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> to whom I chiefly owe the Success of the Play.</Q></P>
<P>Here is enough said to illustrate the per∣sonal Qualifications of this Gentleman as an Actor; therefore let me attempt to delineate his Mind.</P>
<P>His Purse was ever open to proper Objects of Charity; and I have often seen Tears in his Eyes at the Relation of any Misfortune that befel others. He was ever the first Pro∣poser in any joint Charity from the Theatrical Stock, and, I am convinced, has often pre∣vailed upon their unwilling Liberality. His Care of the Orphan Daughters of Mr. <HI>Far∣quhar,</HI> by giving them several Benefit Plays, continued to the last of his Days; and, in losing him, they have in Reality lost a Father: But, I hope, his constant Stream of Bounty has placed them above Want. In short, his private Acts of Charity are numberless. I shall add one in particular.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, a Native of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose Name is <HI>Smith,</HI> who received a liberal Educa∣tion in <HI>Trinity-College, Dublin,</HI> brought a Tra∣gedy to the Managers of the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for their Approbation: The Play was read, and returned, with Desire to make some Alterations for the next Season. This postponing but ill agreed with our Author's Circumstances, that loudly called for a speedy Supply. Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> knowing the ill State of his Finances, bought a Night of his Bro∣ther
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
ther Managers, and gave it to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> for a Benefit. Yet he did not think that sus∣ficient, but used all his Interest to make it truly a Benefit, and put a Hundred Guineas clear in the Author's Pocket; with which he took Leave of his Benefactor, and the Muses; embarked for <HI>Holland,</HI> where he put himself under the Tuition of the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> at <HI>Leyden;</HI> and, in time, profited so well, that his great Master of Medicine sent him to <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> at the Request of the <HI>Czarina,</HI> where, at his first Arrival, a handsome Pen∣sion was settled upon him. I have seen several Letters from this Gentleman to Mr. <HI>Wilks;</HI> a Copy of one I procured from his Widow, which I shall give as a Note, for the Singu∣larity of it <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours with inexpressible Pleasure, by Cap∣tain <HI>Pawlet,</HI> with the Books. How shall I thank you? But no Matter. <HI>You desire I would give you an Account of myself.</HI> I am, at this Instant, alone in my Chamber, wrapt up to my Nose in Furs, before a Wood-fire, that might serve you in the Street for a Night of Rejoicing (for Stoves I do not use); on my Right of the Table, my Ink and Paper; on the Left, a Bottle of good <HI>Nantz,</HI> tho' I'm no Sot; and yet the Moon and Stars shine bright, without a Cloud large enough to cover a Tragedy Plume. When Day ap∣pears, I must see it with a Candle; for my Windows will be covered with a cold Coat of Frost, more of a thick <HI>Substance</HI> than the Glass; and yet it is not three to one, but To-morrow's Sun's short Progress will un∣cloath 'em, and leave 'em slark naked again. If I were to appear before you, fashionably dress'd, you would take me for a <HI>Russian</HI> Bear, I am so clumsily <HI>be∣furr'd,</HI> not only <HI>from Top to Toe</HI> (as <HI>Hamlet</HI> says), but Head and Feet.</P>
<P>I have Practice, more than I desire, this cold, cold Weather, and well paid: A Physician to the Crown here never wants Practice. I was sent for Yesterday to a Man that had been dead some Hours, a Nobleman's Servant, frozen to Death behind his Master's <HI>Sled;</HI> but I left him to be bury'd (first receiving my Fee, and a Pint Glass of Brandy); for I am not holy enough to work Miracles.</P>
<P>I have a good Stomach, and eat and drink well. Here is no want of any thing, but Warmth in our long Winter, and Coolness in our short Summer, be∣ing many Degrees different from you in both. How∣ever, we have our Winter Fires, and Summer shady Groves and Bowers. I have served my Time to the Language of the Country, and it is now become my Servant. My Royal Mistress is a good plump round∣fac'd Lady, and does me the Honour to ask me some Questions, now we understand each other. Were you here, you would have but a small Share in Amours; Love goes by Weight in <HI>Russia,</HI> and those that thrive in Flesh, succeed best. A native Painter would draw <HI>Venus</HI> like an overgrown Hostess, and <HI>Harper</HI> would make an excellent <HI>Mars</HI> in Picture, lolling at the Feet of the fat <HI>Cyprian</HI> Goddess: Were the well-grown Bear here, he would be <HI>Bojar</HI> (or Lord) at his first Landing. My greatest Task is to keep sober amongst a Nation of Drunkards. Captain <HI>Pawlet</HI> will bring you a few Furs, with a small Quantity of Ermin, the Product of <HI>Russia.</HI> Were I settled in <HI>Geeenland,</HI> I should do the same, and land you a <HI>Whale,</HI> or a <HI>White Bear.</HI> You will receive them without any other Weight but them∣selves. But who gave me these Furs? this Affluence? this Royal Mistress? this happy Situation? A Man just of your Age and Stature. If you can't find him out, ask my dear and worthy Friend Sir <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> and tell him at the same time the Grain was his; and the Reaper, with the Crop, shall ever be at his Com∣mand, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THIS Person was born at <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> in the Year 1708. where his Father and Mother, belonging to a Country Company, were then playing. He play'd, as he inform'd me, the Part of the <HI>Duke of York</HI> in <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> before he could speak plain; so that it may be said, he was born an Actor. He came with his Mother (who was a well-esteemed Actress at that Time) to <HI>Drury∣lane</HI> a Boy, where he shewed his rising Ge∣nius, first, in the Part of <HI>'Squire Richard</HI> in the <HI>Provok'd Husband;</HI> from thence he went to the Theatre in <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> where he marry'd the Sister of Mr. <HI>Denis Delane,</HI> then of that Theatre.</P>

a Passage in the Life of this truly good Comedian.</P>
<P>While he and his Family belong'd to the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> after the Com∣pany had finish'd the Season of Playing in <HI>London</HI> (which generally is at the End of <HI>May),</HI> he, with his Father and Mother, went, for the Summer-season, to play at several Towns in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> (the Custom of many of both established Theatres).

</LETTER>
<P>The Meaning why I mention this Letter is, that the Son, the very Night this Letter was wrote, in all Appearance, expir'd, was stripp'd and wash'd, the Bed taken away, and he laid stretch'd on a Mat, with a Bason of Salt (a common Custom in <HI>England</HI>) placed on his Sto∣mach, the inconsolable Parents remov'd to an∣other House, the Coffin brought to the Son's
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
Chamber, and the Windows all open. About Eight at Night a Person was sent with a Light to watch the Corpse: When she open'd the Door, the first Object she perceiv'd was poor <HI>Bob</HI> (as he was generally call'd by his Fami∣liars) sitting up, with his Teeth trembling in his Head (and well they might) with Cold. The Woman, in her Fright, dropp'd the Candle, and scream'd out, <HI>The Devil! the Devil</HI>! This Fright alarm'd another Woman below, who ran up-stairs to see what was the Matter: In the mean time <HI>Bob,</HI> with much ado, had made a Shift to get from the Bed; and, tak∣ing up the Candle, which lay upon the Floor unextinguish'd, was creeping to the Door to call for Assistance, as naked as from the Womb of his Mother; which the two Women per∣ceiving, with joint Voices repeated again, <HI>A Ghost! a Ghost! the Devil! the Devil</HI>! The Master of the House, hearing this Uproar, ran himself, to know the Reason; where poor <HI>Bob,</HI> the suppos'd Devil, and he, soon came to a right Understanding. He was put into a warm Bed, to the unspeakable Joy of his desponding Pa∣rents, and in ten Days after in <HI>London (viva voce)</HI> told me the whole Story of his Death.</P>
<P>This Accident, when real Death paid him a Visit, work'd so strongly upon his forlorn Pa∣rents, that they would not let his Corpse be coffin'd till five Days after he expir'd. Vain Hope! He died in 1743. in the 35th Year of his Age. Both his Parents died soon after him. I am sorry to end this Account with saying, his

<P>THIS Person was born in the Year 1700. In his Youth he was a very promising Actor. The Part of <HI>Charles</HI> in the <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> a Comedy founded upon <HI>Moliere</HI>'s <HI>Tartuff,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> which was perform'd at the The∣atre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane</HI> in the Year 1717. gave him the first Establishment as an Actor. The Applause he gain'd from performing the Part of <HI>Macheath</HI> in the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> was fatal to him: He follow'd <HI>Bacchus</HI> too ar∣dently, insomuch that his Credit was often drown'd upon the Stage, and, by Degrees, al∣most render'd him useless.</P>
<P>He was the suppos'd Author of two dramatic Pieces; <HI>viz. The Quakers Opera,</HI> and a Tra∣gedy call'd <HI>The Fate of Villainy.</HI> This Play he brought to <HI>Ireland</HI> in the Year 1744. and prevailed on the Proprietors to act it, under the Title of <HI>Love and Loyalty.</HI> The second Night was given out for his Benefit; but not being able to pay in Half the Charge of the common Expences, the Doors were order'd to be kept

<P>THIS Gentleman was born in the Year 1707. He is descended of a good Fa∣mily, and had a liberal Education. It is with some Concern I say he had <HI>once</HI> a good For∣tune.</P>
<P>His first Appearance as an Actor, in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> was with Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> at the Theatre in <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> from whence he removed with that Gentleman to <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Theatre; and from thence he was invited to the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane:</HI> But, receiv∣ing some ill Usage from Mr. <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> then Patentee, he came over to this Kingdom in the Year 1741. where he appeared to great Advantage in several capital Characters. He afterwards went out, with a Country Com∣pany, to several Parts of this Kingdom, and is now, as I am inform'd, Head of a Company of Players in <HI>England.</HI> In my Opinion, his De∣servings

might make him desirable in any re∣gular Theatre; he having a proper Person, pleasing Voice, and being always perfect in what he performs, joined to a good Under∣standing to <HI>feel</HI> what he speaks.</P>

<P>THIS facetious Person must not be forgot, whose Performance, as an Actor and a Poet, has often diverted the Town. He was taught the Use of the Pencil under that cele∣brated Painter Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller.</HI> I do not pretend to rescue him from the Lash of a Lady who has thought fit to correct him; but this I know, that I have been in his Company, when his quick Imagination has struck out several Pieces of Humour that have given great Plea∣sure, in his Manner of Singing. To give one Instance of it: He and I were together, with∣out any other Company; when, on the Back of a Play-bill, he struck out the following Song, for his little Opera call'd <HI>A Cure for a Scold.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>WHoe'er to a Wife</L>
<L>Is link'd for his Life,</L>
<L>Is plac'd in a wretched Condition;</L>
<L>Tho' plagu'd with her Tricks,</L>
<L>Like a Blister she sticks,</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="257"/>
And Death is his only Physician, Poor Man,</L>
<L>And Death, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So the Cur who possest</L>
<L>A Bone of the best,</L>
<L>Could lick it, or leave it, at Pleasure;</L>
<L>But if to his Tail</L>
<L>'Tis ty'd, without fail</L>
<L>He's harass'd and plagu'd, without Measure, Poor Cur,</L>
<L>He's harass'd, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Now what convinces me of the quick Coin∣age of this Song is, that the last Stanza was produced by the Accident of seeing a Dog run, at that Instant, by the Window, with a Bone ty'd to his Tail, follow'd by a hooting Mob.</P>
<P>This may certainly be said of him, that he had an inexhaustible Fund of Good-humour, Good-nature, and Generosity; and might have had a heavier Purse, if he had not been so light of Heart. I shall end with two Lines of his own, with very little Variation.</P>

<P>MUST not be forgot, since what he does, he does well; and, in my Judgment, were he put forward in some Parts in Low Comedy, his Execution would not lose him any Reputation.

<HEAD>Mrs. WOFFINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS amiable Actress was born in <HI>Dublin</HI> of reputable Parents, who gave her a genteel Education. Her sprightly Genius led her early to the Stage, where she made a rapid Progress: Her first Establishment was in the Character of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> in this King∣dom, which was the first Part she perform'd in <HI>Covent-garden</HI> Theatre, and had a successive Progress of upwards of twenty Nights, with universal Applause. The Manager of that Theatre having some Dispute with her re∣lating to Salary (as I am inform'd), she engag'd with the Manager of <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> where she has reign'd in full Perfection, unrival'd in the Parts she undertakes; till her late Re-establish∣ment at <HI>Covent-garden.</HI></P>
<P>As Merit too often creates Envy, the little World the Theatre is not free from it. This agreeable Actress, in the Part of Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> coming into the Green-Room, said, pleasantly, <HI>In my Conscience! I believe Half the Men in the House take me for one of their own Sex.</HI> An∣other Actress reply'd, <HI>It may be so; but, in my Conscience! the other Half can convince them to the contrary.</HI> As the Theatre is the Test of other Peoples. Wit, why may they not find a little among themselves?</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260"/>
I am informed, she now shines in several ca∣pital Parts in Tragedy; viz. <HI>Cleopatra</HI> in <HI>All for Love, Jane Shore, Monimia, Calista</HI> in the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>I shall mention, as my last Note, an Accident that fell out at this Play, the first Season it was perform'd, in the Year 1699. which I gather'd from that Stage Chro∣nicle, Mr. <HI>John Bowman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lothario,</HI> after he is kill'd by <HI>Altamont</HI> in the 4th Act, lies dead by Proxy in the 5th, raised on a Bier covered with Black by the <HI>Property-man,</HI> and the Face whitened by the Barber, the Coat and Perriwig generally filled by one of the Dressers. Most of the capital Actors in the establish'd Theatres have generally a Dresser to them∣selves, tho' they are paid by the Manager, to be ready, on all Occasions, for Stage-guards, Attendance, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> played <HI>Lothario,</HI> and one <HI>Warren,</HI> his Dresser, claimed a Right of lying for his Master, and performing the dead Part of <HI>Lothario,</HI> which he proposed to act to the best Advantage; tho' <HI>Powell</HI> was ignorant of the Matter. The Fifth Act began, and went on, as usual, with Applause; but, about the Middle of the dis∣tressful Scene, <HI>Powell</HI> called aloud for his Man <HI>Warren,</HI> who as loudly replied, from the Bier on the Stage, <HI>Here, Sir! Powell</HI> (who, as I said before, was ignorant of the Part his Man was doing) repeated, without Loss of Time, <HI>Come here this Moment, you Son of a Whore! or I'll break all the Bones in your Skin. Warren</HI> knew his hasty Tem∣per; therefore, without any Reply, jump'd off, with all his Sables about him, which, unfortunately, were tied fast to the Handles of the Bier, and dragg'd after him. But this was not all; the Laugh and Roar began in the Audience, till it frighten'd poor <HI>Warren</HI> so much, that, with the Bier at his Tail, he threw down <HI>Calista</HI> (Mrs. <HI>Barry),</HI> and overwhelm'd her with the Table, Lamp, Book, Bones, together with all the Lumber of the Char∣nel-house. He tugg'd, till he broke off his Trammels, and made his Escape; and the Play, at once, ended with immoderate Fits of Laughter: Even the grave Mr. <HI>Bet∣terton</HI>
<Q><L>Smil'd in the Tumult, and enjoy'd the Storm.</L></Q>
But he would not let the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> be play'd any more that Season, till poor <HI>Warren</HI>'s Misconduct was something forgot.</P></NOTE>.</P>

I shall leave this Lady to proceed in her Path of Merit where she still leads, with an <HI>Epi∣logue</HI> wrote purely for her Manner of Speaking: And as <HI>Prologues</HI> and <HI>Epilogues</HI> are the most difficult Tasks of both Sexes on the Stage, it is to be remark'd, but few, besides the capital Performers, are trusted with them; and a good Prologue and Epilogue have often help'd a bad Play out of the Mire, or, at least, sent the Audience home a little better humour'd.</P>
