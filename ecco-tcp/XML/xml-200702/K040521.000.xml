<L>With <HI>Pearl</HI> and <HI>Linnen</HI> hangs each thorn;</L>
<L>When happy Bards, who can regale</L>
<L>Their Muse with Country air and ale,</L>
<L>Ramble afield, to Brooks and Bow'rs,</L>
<L>To pick up <HI>Sentiments</HI> and <HI>Flow'rs</HI>;</L>
<L>When Dogs and Squires from kennel fly,</L>
<L>And Hogs and Farmers quit their stye;</L>
<L>When <HI>my Lord</HI> rises to the Chace,</L>
<L>And brawny Chaplain takes his place.</L>

<L>THESE Images, or bad or good,</L>
<L>If they are rightly understood,</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="3"/><HI>Sagacious</HI> Readers must allow</L>
<L>Proclaim us in the Country now.</L>
<L>For Observations mostly rise</L>
<L>From Objects just before our eyes,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Lord in Critic Wit</L>
<L>Can tell you where the piece was writ,</L>
<L>Can point out, as he goes along,</L>
<L>(And who shall dare to say he's wrong)</L>
<L>Whether the warmth (for Bards, we know,</L>
<L>At present never more than glow)</L>
<L>Was in the Town or Country caught,</L>
<L>By the peculiar turn of thought.</L>

<LG>
<L>IT WAS THE HOUR—tho' Critics frown</L>
<L>We now declare ourselves in Town,</L>
<L>Nor will a moment's pause allow</L>
<L>For finding when he came, or how.</L>
<L>The Man who deals in humble Prose,</L>
<L>Tied down by rule and method goes,</L>
<L>But they who court the vig'rous Muse</L>
<L>Their carriage have a right to chuse.</L>
<L>Free as the Air, and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Swift as the motions of the Mind,</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="4"/>The POET darts from place to place,</L>
<L>And instant bounds o'er Time and Space.</L>
<L>Nature (whilst blended fire and skill</L>
<L>Inflame our passions to his will)</L>
<L>Smiles at her violated Laws,</L>
<L>And crowns his daring with applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHOULD there be still some rigid few</L>
<L>Who keep <HI>propriety</HI> in view,</L>
<L>Whose heads turn round, and cannot bear</L>
<L>This whirling passage thro' the Air,</L>
<L>Free leave have such at home to sit,</L>
<L>And write a <HI>Regimen</HI> for Wit:</L>
<L>To clip our Pinions let them try,</L>
<L>Not having heart themselves to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IT WAS THE HOUR, when Devotees</L>
<L>Breathe <HI>pious curses</HI> on their knees,</L>
<L>When they with pray'rs the day begin</L>
<L>To sanctify a Night of Sin;</L>
<L>When Rogues of Modesty, who roam</L>
<L>Under the veil of Night, sneak home,</L>

<L>Just to the windward of the Law,</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="5"/>Less modest Rogues their tricks may play</L>
<L>And plunder in the face of day.</L>
</LG>

<L>BUT hold—whilst thus we play the fool,</L>
<L>In bold contempt of ev'ry rule,</L>
<L>Things of no consequence expressing,</L>
<L><HI>Describing</HI> now, and now <HI>digressing,</HI></L>
<L>To the discredit of our skill</L>

<L>IN <HI>Plays</HI> indeed, when storms of rage</L>

<L>With strict Propriety we hear</L>

<L>To <HI>thatch a cot,</HI> or <HI>paint a flow'r</HI>;</L>
<L>But in these <HI>serious</HI> works, design'd</L>
<L>To mend the morals of Mankind,</L>
<L>We must for ever be disgrac'd</L>

<L>Our Friends themselves cannot admit</L>
<L>This rambling, wild, digressive Wit,</L>
<L>No—not those very Friends, who found</L>
<L>Their Credit on the self-same ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PEACE, my good grumbling Sir—for once,</L>
<L>Sunk in the solemn, formal Dunce,</L>
<L>This Coxcomb shall your fears beguile—</L>
<L>We will be dull—that you may smile.</L>

<L>COME METHOD, come in all thy pride,</L>
<L>DULLNESS and WHITEHEAD by thy side,</L>
<L>DULLNESS and METHOD still are one,</L>
<L>And WHITEHEAD is their darling Son.</L>
<L>Not HE, whose pen above controul</L>

<L>To give such qualities and grace,</L>
<L>As may equip them for the place.)</L>

<LG>
<L>BUT HE—who measures, as he goes,</L>
<L>A mongril kind of tinkling prose,</L>
<L>And is too frugal to dispense</L>
<L>At once both Poetry and Sense,</L>
<L>Who, from amidst his <HI>slumb'ring</HI> guards,</L>
<L>Deals out a Charge to <HI>Subject Bards,</HI></L>
<L>Where Couplets after Couplets creep</L>
<L>Propitious to the reign of sleep,</L>
<L>Yet ev'ry word imprints an awe,</L>

<L>DULLMAN commands, and I obey.</L>
<L>Big with those throes which Patriots feel,</L>
<L>And lab'ring for the common weal,</L>
<L>Some secret, which forbids him rest,</L>
<L><HI>Tumbles</HI> and <HI>Tosses</HI> in his breast,</L>
<L><HI>Tumbles</HI> and <HI>Tosses</HI> to get free;</L>
<L>And thus the Chief commands by Me:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO-MORROW—if the Day appear</L>
<L>Likely to turn out fair and clear—</L>
<L>Proclaim a <HI>Grand Processionade</HI>—</L>
<L>Be all the City Pomp display'd—</L>
<L>Our Citizens to Council call—</L>
<L>Let <HI>All</HI> meet—'tis the Cause of <HI>All.</HI></L>
