<HEAD>A POLITICAL ROMANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N my last, for want of some∣thing better to write about, I told you what a World of Fending and Proving we have had of late, in this little Vil∣lage of ours, about an <HI>old-cast-Pair-of-black-Plush-Breeches,</HI> which <HI>John,</HI> our Pa∣rish-Clerk, about ten Years ago, it seems, had made a Promise of to one <HI>Trim,</HI> who is our Sexton and Dog-Whipper.—To this you write me Word, that you have had more than either one or two Occasions to know a good deal of the shifty Beha∣viour of this said Master <HI>Trim,</HI>—and that
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
you are astonished, nor can you for your Soul conceive, how so worthless a Fellow, and so worthless a Thing into the Bargain, could become the Occasion of such a Racket as I have represented.</P>
<P>Now, though you do not say expressly, you could wish to hear any more about it, yet I see plain enough that I have raised your Curiosity; and therefore, from the same Motive, that I slightly mentioned it at all in my last Letter, I will, in this, give you a full and very circumstantial Account of the whole Affair.</P>
<P>But, before I begin, I must first set you right in one very material Point, in which I have missled you, as to the true Cause of all this Uproar amongst us;—which does not take its Rise, as I then told you, from the Affair of the <HI>Breeches;</HI>—but, on the contrary, the whole Affair of the <HI>Breeches</HI> has taken its Rise from it:—To understand which, you must know, that the first Beginning of the Squabble was not between <HI>John</HI> the Parish-Clerk and <HI>Trim</HI> the Sexton, but betwixt the Par∣son of the Parish and the said Master <HI>Trim,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
about an old <HI>Watch-Coat,</HI> which had many Years hung up in the Church, which <HI>Trim</HI> had set his Heart upon; and nothing would serve <HI>Trim</HI> but he must take it home, in order to have it converted into a <HI>warm Under-Petticoat</HI> for his Wife, and a <HI>Jerkin</HI> for himself, against Winter; which, in a plaintive Tone, he most humbly begg'd his Reverence would consent to.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, Sir, who have so often felt it, that a Principle of strong Compassion transports a generous Mind sometimes beyond what is strictly right,—the Parson was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of this very Crime;—for no sooner did the distinct Words—<HI>Petticoat—poor Wife—warm—Winter</HI> strike upon his Ear,—but his Heart warmed,—and, before <HI>Trim</HI> had well got to the End of his Petition, (being a Gentle∣man of a frank and open Temper) he told him he was welcome to it, with all his Heart and Soul. But, <HI>Trim,</HI> says he, as you see I am but just got down to my Living, and am an utter Stranger to all Parish-Matters, know nothing about this old Watch-Coat you beg of me, having never seen it in my
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Life, and therefore cannot be a Judge whether 'tis fit for such a Purpose; or, if it is, in Truth, know not whether 'tis mine to bestow upon you or not;—you must have a Week or ten Days Patience, till I can make some Inquiries about it;—and, if I find it is in my Power, I tell you again, Man, your Wife is heartily welcome to an Under-Petticoat out of it, and you to a Jerkin, was the Thing as good again as you represent it.</P>
<P>It is necessary to inform you, Sir, in this Place, That the Parson was earnestly bent to serve <HI>Trim</HI> in this Affair, not only from the Motive of Generosity, which I have justly ascribed to him, but likewise from another Motive; and that was by way of making some Sort of Recompence for a Multitude of small Services which <HI>Trim</HI> had occasionally done, and indeed was continually doing, (as he was much about the House) when his own Man was out of the Way. For all these Reasons to∣gether, I say, the Parson of the Parish in∣tended to serve <HI>Trim</HI> in this Matter to the utmost of his Power: All that was want∣ing was previously to inquire, if any one
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
had a <HI>Claim</HI> to it;—or whether, as it had, Time immemorial, hung up in the Church, the taking it down might not raise a Clamour in the Parish. These In∣quiries were the very Thing that <HI>Trim</HI> dreaded in his Heart.—He knew very well that if the Parson should but say one Word to the Church-Wardens about it, there would be an End of the whole Af∣fair. For this, and some other Reasons not necessary to be told you, at present, <HI>Trim</HI> was for allowing no Time in this Mat∣ter;—but, on the contrary, doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the Vicarage-House;—plagued the whole Family to Death;—pressed his Suit Morning, Noon, and Night; and, to shorten my Story, teazed the poor Gentleman, who was but in an ill State of Health, almost out of his Life about it.</P>
<P>You will not wonder, when I tell you, that all this Hurry and Precipitation, on the Side of Master <HI>Trim,</HI> produced its na∣tural Effect on the Side of the Parson, and that was, a Suspicion that all was not right at the Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
He was one Evening sitting alone in his Study, weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind; and, after an Hour and a half's serious Deliberation up∣on the Affair, and running over <HI>Trim</HI>'s Be∣haviour throughout,—he was just saying to himself, <HI>It must be so;</HI>—when a sudden Rap at the Door put an End to his Solilo∣quy,—and, in a few Minutes, to his Doubts too; for a Labourer in the Town, who deem'd himself past his fifty-second Year, had been returned by the Constable in the Militia-List,—and he had come, with a Groat in his Hand, to search the Parish Register for his Age.—The Parson bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket, and go into the Kitchen:—Then shutting the Study Door, and taking down the Parish Register,—<HI>Who knows,</HI> says he, <HI>but I may find something here about this self∣same Watch-Coat?</HI>—He had scarce un∣clasped the Book, in saying this, when he popp'd upon the very Thing he wanted, fairly wrote on the first Page, pasted to the Inside of one of the Covers, whereon was a Memorandum about the very Thing in Question, in these express Words:</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/><Q REND="inline"><P><HI REND="blackletterType">MEMORANDUM.</HI></P>
<P><HI REND="blackletterType">The great Watch-Coat was purchased and given above two hundred Years ago, by the Lord of the Manor, to this Parish-Church, to the sole Use and Behoof of the poor Sextons thereof, and their Successors, for ever, to be worn up them respectively in winterly cold Nights, in ringing</HI> Com∣plines, Passing-Bells, &amp;c. <HI REND="blackletterType">which the said Lord of the Manor had done, in Piety, to keep the poor Wretches warm, and for the Good of his own Soul, for which they were di∣rected to pray,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>Just Hea∣ven!</HI> said the Parson to himself, looking upwards, <HI>What an Escape have I had I Give this for an Under-Petticoat to</HI> Trim<HI>'s Wife! I would not have consented to such a Desecration to be Primate of all</HI> Eng∣land; <HI>nay, I would not have disturb'd a single Button of it for half my Tythes!</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when in pops <HI>Trim</HI> with the whole Sub∣ject of the Exclamation under both his Arms.—I say, under both his Arms;—for he had actually got it ripp'd and cut out ready, his own Jerkin under one Arm, and the Petticoat under the other, in order to be carried to the Taylor to be made up,—
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
and had just stepp'd in, in high Spirits, to shew the Parson how cleverly it had held out.</P>
<P>There are many good Similies now sub∣sisting in the World, but which I have nei∣ther Time to recollect or look for, which would give you a strong Conception of the Astonishment and honest Indignation which this unexpected Stroke of <HI>Trim</HI>'s Impudence impress'd upon the Parson's Looks.—Let it suffice to say, That it ex∣ceeded all fair Description,—as well as all Power of proper Resentment,—except this, that <HI>Trim</HI> was ordered, in a stern Voice, to lay the Bundles down upon the Table,—to go about his Business, and wait upon him, at his Peril, the next Morning at Eleven precisely:—Against this Hour, like a wise Man, the Parson had sent to desire <HI>John</HI> the Parish-Clerk, who bore an exceeding good Character as a Man of Truth, and who having, moreover, a pretty Freehold of about eighteen Pounds a Year in the Township, was a leading Man in it; and, upon the whole, was such a one of whom it might be said,—That he rather did Honour to his Office,—than
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
that his Office did Honour to him.—Him he sends for, with the Church-Wardens, and one of the Sides-Men, a grave, know∣ing, old Man, to be present:—For as <HI>Trim</HI> had with-held the whole Truth from the Parson, touching the Watch-Coat, he thought it probable he would as certainly do the same Thing to others; though this, I said, was wise, the Trouble of the Precau∣tion might have been spared,—because the Parson's Character was unblemish'd,—and he had ever been held by the World in the Estimation of a Man of Honour and Inte∣grity.—<HI>Trim</HI>'s Character, on the contrary, was as well known, if not in the World, yet, at least, in all the Parish, to be that of a little, dirty, pimping, pettifogging, ambi∣dextrous Fellow,—who neither cared what he did or said of any, provided he could get a Penny by it.—This might, I say, have made any Precaution needless;—but you must know, as the Parson had in a Manner but just got down to his Living, he dreaded the Consequences of the least ill Impression on his first Entrance amongst his Parishioners, which would have disabled him from do∣ing them the Good he wished;—so that, out of Regard to his Flock, more than the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
necessary Care due to himself,—he was re∣solv'd not to lie at the Mercy of what Re∣sentment might vent, or Malice lend an Ear to.—Accordingly the whole Matter was rehearsed from first to last by the Parson, in the Manner I've told you, in the Hear∣ing of <HI>John</HI> the Parish-Clerk, and in the Presence of <HI>Trim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> had little to say for himself, ex∣cept <Q REND="inline">"That the Parson had absolutely pro∣mised to be friend him and his Wife in the Affair, to the utmost of his Power: That the Watch-Coat was certainly in his Power, and that he might still give it him if he pleased."</Q></P>
<P>To this, the Parson's Reply was short, but strong, <Q REND="inline">"That nothing was in his <HI>Power</HI> to do, but what he could do <HI>honest∣ly:</HI>—That in giving the Coat to him and his Wife, he should do a manifest Wrong to the <HI>next</HI> Sexton; the great Watch-Coat being the most comfortable Part of the Place:—That he should, moreover, injure the Right of his own Successor, who would be just so much a worse Patron, as the Worth of the Coat amounted to;—and, in
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
a Word, he declared, that his whole Intent in promising that Coat, was Charity to <HI>Trim;</HI> but <HI>Wrong</HI> to no Man; that was a Reserve, he said, made in all Cases of this Kind:—and he declared solemnly, <HI>in Verbo Sacerdotis,</HI> That this was his Meaning, and was so understood by <HI>Trim</HI> himself."</Q></P>
<P>With the Weight of this Truth, and the great good Sense and strong Reason which accompanied all the Parson said upon the Subject,—poor <HI>Trim</HI> was driven to his last Shift,—and begg'd he might be suffered to plead his Right and Title to the Watch-Coat, if not by <HI>Promise,</HI> at least by <HI>Servi∣ces.</HI>—It was well known how much he was entitled to it upon these Scores: That he had black'd the Parson's Shoes without Count, and greased his Boots above fifty Times:—That he had run for Eggs into the Town upon all Occasions;—whetted the Knives at all Hours;—catched his Horse and rubbed him down:—That for his Wife she had been ready upon all Occasions to charr for them;—and neither he nor she, to the best of his Remembrance, ever took a Farthing, or any thing beyond a Mug of Ale.—To this Account of his Services he
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
begg'd Leave to add those of his Wishes, which, he said, had been equally great.—He affirmed, and was ready, he said, to make it appear, by Numbers of Witnesses, <Q REND="inline">"He had drank his Reverence's Health a thousand Times, (by the bye, he did not add out of the Parson's own Ale): That he not only drank his Health, but wish'd it; and never came to the House, but ask'd his Man kindly how he did; that in par∣ticular, about half a Year ago, when his Reverence cut his Finger in paring an Ap∣ple, he went half a Mile to ask a cunning Woman, what was good to stanch Blood, and actually returned with a Cobweb in his Breeches Pocket:—Nay, says <HI>Trim,</HI> it was not a Fortnight ago, when your Reve∣rence took that violent Purge, that I went to the far End of the whole Town to bor∣row you a Close-stool,—and came back, as my Neighbours, who flouted me, will all bear witness, with the Pan upon my Head, and never thought it too much."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> concluded his pathetick Remon∣strance with saying, <Q REND="inline">"He hoped his Re∣verence's Heart would not suffer him to requite so many faithful Services by so un∣kind
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
a Return:—That if it was so, as he was the first, so he hoped he should be the last, Example of a Man of his Condition so treated."</Q>—This Plan of <HI>Trim</HI>'s De∣fence, which <HI>Trim</HI> had put himself upon,—could admit of no other Reply but a ge∣neral Smile.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, let me inform you, That all that could be said, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> on both Sides, being fairly heard, it was plain, That <HI>Trim,</HI> in every Part of this Affair, had behaved very ill;—and <HI>one</HI> Thing, which was never expected to be known of him, happening in the Course of this De∣bate to come out against him;—namely, That he had gone and told the Parson, be∣fore he had ever set Foot in his Parish, That <HI>John</HI> his Parish-Clerk,—his Church-Wardens, and some of the Heads of the Parish, were a Parcel of Scoundrels.—Up∣on the Upshot, <HI>Trim</HI> was kick'd out of Doors; and told, at his Peril, never to come there again.</P>
<P>At first <HI>Trim</HI> huff'd and bounced most terribly;—swore he would get a War∣rant;—then nothing would serve him but
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
he would call a Bye-Law, and tell the whole Parish how the Parson had misused him;—but cooling of that, as fearing the Parson might possibly bind him over to his good Behaviour, and, for aught he knew, might send him to the House of Correc∣tion,—he let the Parson alone; and, to re∣venge himself, falls foul upon his Clerk, who had no more to do in the Quarrel than you or I;—rips up the Promise of the old∣cast-Pair-of-black-Plush-Breeches, and raises an Uproar in the Town about it, not∣withstanding it had slept ten Years.—But all this, you must know, is look'd upon in no other Light, but as an artful Stroke of Generalship in <HI>Trim,</HI> to raise a Dust, and cover himself under the disgraceful Cha∣stisement he has undergone.</P>
<P>If your Curiosity is not yet satisfied,—I will now proceed to relate the <HI>Battle</HI> of the Breeches, in the same exact Manner I have done <HI>that</HI> of the Watch-Coat.</P>
<P>Be it known then, that, about ten Years ago, when <HI>John</HI> was appointed Pa∣rish-Clerk of this Church, this said Master <HI>Trim</HI> took no small Pains to get into <HI>John</HI>'s
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
good Graces; in order, as it afterwards appeared, to coax a Promise out of him of a Pair of Breeches, which <HI>John</HI> had then by him, of black Plush, not much the worse for wearing;—<HI>Trim</HI> only begging for God's Sake to have them bestowed up∣on him when <HI>John</HI> should think fit to cast them.</P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> was one of those kind of Men who loved a Bit of Finery in his Heart, and would rather have a tatter'd Rag of a Bet∣ter Body's, than the best plain whole Thing his Wife could spin him.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> who was naturally unsuspicious, made no more Difficulty of promising the Breeches, than the Parson had done in pro∣mising the Great Coat; and, indeed, with something less Reserve,—because the Breeches were <HI>John's own,</HI> and he could give them, without Wrong, to whom he thought fit.</P>
<P>It happened, I was going to say un∣luckily, but, I should rather say, most luckily, for <HI>Trim,</HI> for he was the only Gainer by it,—that a Quarrel, about some
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
six or eight Weeks after this, broke out between <HI>the late</HI> Parson of the Parish and <HI>John</HI> the Clerk. Somebody (and it was thought to be Nobody but <HI>Trim</HI>) had put it into the Parson's Head, "That <HI>John</HI>'s Desk in the Church was, at the least, four Inches higher than it should be:—That the Thing gave Offence, and was indecorous, inasmuch as it ap∣proach'd too near upon a Level with the Parson's Desk itself. This Hardship the Parson complained of loudly,—and told <HI>John</HI> one Day after Prayers,—<Q REND="inline">"He could bear it no longer:—And would have it al∣ter'd and brought down as it should be."</Q> <HI>John</HI> made no other Reply, but, <Q REND="inline">"That the Desk was not of his raising:—That 'twas not one Hair Breadth higher than he found it;—and that as he found it, so would he leave it:—In short, he would neither make an Encroachment, nor would he suffer one."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>late</HI> Parson might have his Virtues, but the leading Part of his Character was not <HI>Humility;</HI> so that <HI>John</HI>'s Stiffness in this Point was not likely to reconcile Mat∣ters.—This was <HI>Trim</HI>'s Harvest.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
After a friendly Hint to <HI>John</HI> to stand his Ground,—away hies <HI>Trim</HI> to make his Market at the Vicarage:—What pass'd there, I will not say, intending not to be uncharitable; so shall content myself with only guessing at it, from the sudden Change that appeared in <HI>Trim</HI>'s Dress for the bet∣ter;—for he had left his old ragged Coat, Hat and Wig, in the Stable, and was come forth strutting across the Church-yard, y'clad in a good creditable cast Coat, large Hat and Wig, which the Parson had just given him.—Ho! Ho! Hollo! <HI>John!</HI> cries <HI>Trim,</HI> in an insolent Bravo, as loud as ever he could bawl—See here, my Lad! how fine I am.—The more Shame for you, answered <HI>John,</HI> seriously.—Do you think, <HI>Trim,</HI> says he, such Finery, gain'd by such Services, becomes you, or can wear well?—Fye upon it, <HI>Trim;</HI>—I could not have expected this from you, consi∣dering what Friendship you pretended, and how kind I have ever been to you:—How many Shillings and Sixpences I have generously lent you in your Distres∣ses?—Nay, it was but t'other Day that I promised you these black Plush Breeches I have on.—Rot your Breeches, quoth
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
<HI>Trim;</HI> for <HI>Trim</HI>'s Brain was half turn'd with his new Finery:—Rot your Breeches, says he,—I would not take them up, were they laid at my Door;—give 'em, and be d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d to you, to whom you like;—I would have you to know I can have a bet∣ter Pair at the Parson's any Day in the Week:—<HI>John</HI> told him plainly, as his Word had once pass'd him, he had a Spi∣rit above taking Advantage of his Inso∣lence, in giving them away to another:—But, to tell him his Mind freely, he thought he had got so many Favours of that Kind, and was so likely to get many more for the same Services, of the Parson, that he had better give up the Breeches, with good Nature, to some one who would be more thankful for them.</P>
<P>Here <HI>John</HI> mentioned <HI>Mark Slender,</HI> (who, it seems, the Day before, had ask'd <HI>John</HI> for 'em) not knowing they were un∣der Promise to <HI>Trim.</HI>—<Q REND="inline">"Come, <HI>Trim,</HI> says he, let poor <HI>Mark</HI> have 'em,—You know he has not a Pair to his A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>: Besides, you see he is just of my Size, and they will fit him to a T; where∣as, if I give 'em to you,—look ye, they
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
are not worth much; and besides, you could not get your Backside into them, if you had them, without tearing them all to Pieces."</Q></P>
<P>Every Tittle of this was most undoubt∣edly true; for <HI>Trim,</HI> you must know, by soul Feeding, and playing the good Fel∣low at the Parson's, was grown somewhat gross about the lower Parts, <HI>if not higher:</HI> So that, as all <HI>John</HI> said upon the Occa∣sion was fact, <HI>Trim,</HI> with much ado, and after a hundred Hum's and Hah's, at last, out of mere Compassion to <HI>Mark, signs, seals, and delivers up <HI REND="blackletterType">all Right, Interest, and Pretensions whatsoever, in and to the said Breeches; thereby binding his Heirs, Erecutors, Administrators, and Assignes, never mere to call the said Claim in Que∣stion.</HI></HI></P>
<P>All this Renunciation was set forth in an ample Manner, to be in pure Pity to <HI>Mark</HI>'s Nakedness;—but the Secret was, <HI>Trim</HI> had an Eye to, and firmly expected in his own Mind, the great Green Pulpit-Cloth and old Velvet Cushion, which were that very Year to be taken down;—
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
which, by the Bye, could he have wheed∣led <HI>John</HI> a second Time out of 'em, as he hoped, he had made up the Loss of his Breeches Seven-fold.</P>
<P>Now, you must know, this Pulpit-Cloth and Cushion were not in <HI>John's</HI> Gift, but in the Church-Wardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—However, as I said above, that <HI>John</HI> was a leading Man in the Parish, <HI>Trim</HI> knew he could help him to them if he would:—But <HI>John</HI> had got a Surfeit of him;—so, when the Pulpit-Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ta∣ken down, they were immediately given (<HI>John</HI> having a great Say in it) to <HI>William Doe,</HI> who understood very well what Use to make of them.</P>
<P>As for the old Breeches, poor <HI>Mark Slender</HI> lived to wear them but a short Time, and they got into the Possession of <HI>Lorry Slim,</HI> an unlucky Wight, by whom they are still worn;—in Truth, as you will guess; they are very thin by this Time:—But <HI>Lorry</HI> has a light Heart; and what recommends them to him, is this, that, as thin as they are, he knows that <HI>Trim,</HI> let him say what he will to the con∣trary, still envies the <HI>Possessor</HI> of them,—
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and, with all his Pride, would be very glad to wear them after <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Footing have these Affairs slept quietly for near ten Years,—and would have slept for ever, but for the un∣lucky Kicking-Bout; which, as I said, has ripp'd this Squabble up afresh: So that it was no longer ago than last Week, that <HI>Trim</HI> met and insulted <HI>John</HI> in the public Town - Way, before a hundred People;—tax'd him with the Promise of the old-cast-Pair-of-black-Breeches, not∣withstanding <HI>Trim</HI>'s solemn Renunciation; twitted him with the Pulpit-Cloth and Velvet Cushion,—as good as told him, he was ignorant of the common Duties of his Clerkship; adding, very infolently, That he knew not so much as to give out a common Psalm in Tune.—</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> contented himself with giving a plain Answer to every Article that <HI>Trim</HI> had laid to his Charge, and appealed to his Neighbours who remembered the whole Affair;—and as he knew there was never any Thing to be got in wrestling with a
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Chimney-Sweeper,—he was going to take Leave of <HI>Trim</HI> for ever.—But, hold,—the Mob by this Time had got round them, and their High Mightinesses insisted upon having <HI>Trim</HI> tried upon the Spot.—<HI>Trim</HI> was accordingly tried; and, after a full Hearing, was convicted a second Time, and handled more roughly by one or more of them, than even at the Parson's.</P>
<P><HI>Trim,</HI> says one, are you not ashamed of yourself, to make all this Rout and Di∣sturbance in the Town, and set Neigh∣bours together by the Ears, about an old∣worn-out-Pair-of-cast-Breeches, not worth Half a Crown?—Is there a cast-Coat, or a Place in the whole Town, that will bring you in a Shilling, but what you have snapp'd up, like a greedy Hound as you are?</P>
<P>In the first Place, are you not Sexton and Dog-Whipper, worth Three Pounds a Year?—Then you begg'd the Church-Wardens to let your Wife have the Wash∣ing and Darning of the Surplice and Church-Linen, which brings you in Thir∣teen
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Shillings and Four Pence.—Then you have Six Shillings and Eight Pence for oiling and winding up the Clock, both paid you at <HI>Easter.</HI>—The Pinder's Place, which is worth Forty Shillings a Year,—you have got that too.-You are the Bailiff, which the late Parson got you, which brings you in Forty Shillings more.—Besides all this, you have Six Pounds a Year, paid you Quarter∣ly for being Mole-Catcher to the Parish.—Aye, says the luckless Wight above-men∣tioned, (who was standing close to him with his Plush Breeches on) <Q REND="inline">"You are not only Mole-Catcher, <HI>Trim,</HI> but you catch STRAY CONIES too in the <HI>Dark;</HI> and you pretend a <HI>Licence</HI> for it, which, I trow, will be look'd into at the next Quarter Ses∣sions."</Q> I maintain it, I have a Licence, says <HI>Trim,</HI> blushing as red as Scarlet:—I have a Licence,—and as I farm a War∣ren in the next Parish, I will catch Conies every Hour of the Night.—<HI>You catch Conies!</HI> cries a toothless old Woman, who was just passing by.—</P>
<P>This set the Mob a laughing, and sent every Man home in perfect good Humour,
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
except <HI>Trim,</HI> who waddled very slowly off with that Kind of inflexible Gravity only to be equalled by one Animal in the whole Creation,—and surpassed by none. I am,</P>

<P>When I finished the above Account, I thought (as did every Soul in the Parish) <HI>Trim</HI> had met with so thorough a Rebuff from <HI>John</HI> the Parish - Clerk and the Town's Folks, who all took against him, that <HI>Trim</HI> would be glad to be quiet, and let the Matter rest.</P>
<P>But, it seems, it is not half an Hour ago since <HI>Trim</HI> sallied forth again; and, having borrowed a Sow-Gelder's Horn, with hard Blowing he got the whole Town round him, and endeavoured to raise a Disturb∣ance,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
and fight the whole Battle over again:—That he had been used in the last Fray worse than a Dog;—not by <HI>John</HI> the Parish-Clerk,—for I shou'd not, quoth <HI>Trim,</HI> have valued him a Rush single Hands:—But all the Town sided with him, and twelve Men in <HI>Buckram</HI> set upon me all at once, and kept me in Play at Sword's Point for three Hours together.—Besides, quoth <HI>Trim,</HI> there were two misbegotten Knaves in <HI>Kendal Green,</HI> who lay all the while in Ambush in <HI>John</HI>'s own House, and they all <HI>sixteen</HI> came upon my Back, and let drive at me together.—A Plague, says <HI>Trim,</HI> of all Cowards!—<HI>Trim</HI> repeated this Story above a Dozen Times;—which made some of the Neighbours pity him, thinking the poor Fellow crack-brain'd, and that he actually believed what he said. After this <HI>Trim</HI> dropp'd the Affair of the <HI>Breeches,</HI> and begun a fresh Dispute about the <HI>Reading-Desk,</HI> which I told you had occasioned some small Dispute be∣tween the <HI>late</HI> Parson and <HI>John,</HI> some Years ago.</P>
<P>This <HI>Reading-Desk,</HI> as you will observe, was but an Episode wove into the main Story by the Bye;—for the main Affair
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
was the <HI>Battle of the Breeches</HI> and <HI>Great Watch-Coat.</HI>—However, <HI>Trim</HI> being at last driven out of these two Citadels,—he has seized hold, in his Retreat, of this <HI>Reading-Desk,</HI> with a View, as it seems, to take Shelter behind it.</P>
<P>I cannot say but the Man has fought it out obstinately enough;—and, had his Cause been good, I should have really pi∣tied him. For when he was driven out of the <HI>Great Watch-Coat,</HI>—you see, he did not run away;—no,—he retreated be∣hind the <HI>Breeches;</HI>—and, when he could make nothing of it behind the <HI>Breeches,</HI>—he got behind the <HI>Reading-Desk.</HI>—To what other Hold <HI>Trim</HI> will next retreat, the Politicians of this Village are not agreed.—Some think his next Move will be towards the Rear of the Parson's Boot;—but, as it is thought he cannot make a long Stand there,—others are of Opinion, That <HI>Trim</HI> will once more in his Life get hold of the Parson's Horse, and charge upon him, or perhaps behind him.—But as the Horse is not easy to be caught, the more general Opinion is, That, when he is driven out of the <HI>Reading-Desk,</HI> he will make his last Retreat in such a Manner as, if possible,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
to gain the <HI>Close-Stool,</HI> and defend him∣self behind it to the very last Drop. If <HI>Trim</HI> should make this Movement, by my Advice he should be left besides his Cita∣del, in full Possession of the Field of Battle;—where, 'tis certain, he will keep every Body a League off, and may pop by himself till he is weary: Besides, as <HI>Trim</HI> seems bent upon <HI>purging</HI> himself, and may have Abundance of foul Humours to work off, I think he cannot be better placed.</P>
<P>But this is all Matter of Speculation.—Let me carry you back to Matter of Fact, and tell you what Kind of a Stand <HI>Trim</HI> has actually made behind the said <HI>Desk.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neighbours and Townsmen all, I will be sworn before my Lord Mayor, That <HI>John</HI> and his nineteen Men in <HI>Buckram,</HI> have abused me worse than a Dog; for they told you that I play'd fast and go-loose with the <HI>late</HI> Parson and him, in that old Dispute of theirs about the <HI>Reading-Desk;</HI> and that I made Matters worse between them, and not better."</Q></P>
<P>Of this Charge, <HI>Trim</HI> declared he was as innocent as the Child that was unborn:
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
That he would be Book-sworn he had no Hand in it. He produced a strong Wit∣ness;—and, moreover, insinuated, that <HI>John</HI> himself, instead of being angry for what he had done in it, had actually thank'd him. Aye, <HI>Trim,</HI> says the Wight in the Plush Breeches, but that was, <HI>Trim,</HI> the Day before <HI>John</HI> found thee out.—Besides, <HI>Trim,</HI> there is nothing in that:—For, the very Year that thou wast made Town's Pinder, thou knowest well, that I both thank'd thee myself; and, moreover, gave thee a good warm Supper for turning <HI>John Lund</HI>'s Cows and Horses out of my Hard-Corn Close; which if thou had'st not done, (as thou told'st me) I should have lost my whole Crop: Whereas, <HI>John Lund</HI> and <HI>Thomas Patt,</HI> who are both here to testify, and will take their Oaths on't, That thou thyself wast the very Man who set the Gate open; and, after all,—it was not thee, <HI>Trim,</HI>—'twas the Blacksmith's poor Lad who turn'd them out: So that a Man may be thank'd and rewarded too for a good Turn which he never did, nor ever did intend.</P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> could not sustain this unexpected Stroke;—so <HI>Trim</HI> march'd off the Field,
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
without Colours flying, or his Horn sound∣ing, or any other Ensigns of Honour whatever.</P>
<P>Whether after this <HI>Trim</HI> intends to rally a second Time,—or whether <HI>Trim</HI> may not take it into his Head to claim the Vic∣tory,—no one but <HI>Trim</HI> himself can in∣form you:—However, the general Opi∣nion, upon the whole, is this,—That, in three several pitch'd Battles, <HI>Trim</HI> has been so <HI>trimm'd,</HI> as never disastrous Hero was trimm'd before him.</P>

<HEAD>THE KEY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Romance</HI> was, by some Mis∣chance or other, dropp'd in the <HI>Minster-Yard, York,</HI> and pick'd up by a Member of a small Political Club in that City; where it was carried, and publickly read to the Members the last Club Night.</P>
<P>It was instantly agreed to, by a great Majority, That it was a <HI>Political Romance;</HI> but concerning what State or Potentate, could not so easily be settled amongst them.</P>
<P>The President of the Night, who is thought to be as clear and quick-sighted as any one of the whole Club in Things of this Nature, discovered plainly, That the Disturbances therein set forth, related to those on the <HI>Continent:</HI>—That <HI>Trim</HI> could be Nobody but the King of <HI>France,</HI> by whose shifting and intriguing Behaviour, all <HI>Europe</HI> was set together by the Ears:—'That <HI>Trim</HI>'s Wife was certainly the <HI>Em∣press,</HI> who are as kind together, says he, as any Man and Wife can be for their

Lives.—The more Shame for 'em, says an Alderman, low to himself.—Agreeable to this Key, continues the President,—The <HI>Parson,</HI> who I think is a most excellent Character,—is His Most Excellent Ma∣jesty King <HI>Gearge;</HI>—<HI>John,</HI> the Parish-Clerk, is the King of <HI>Prussia;</HI> who, by the Manner of his first entering <HI>Saxony,</HI> shew'd the World most evidently,—That he did know how to lead out the Psalm, and in Tune and Time too, notwithstanding <HI>Trim</HI>'s vile Insult upon him in that Parti∣cular.—But who do you think, says a Sur∣geon and Man-Midwife, who sat next him, (whose Coat-Button the President, in the Earnestness of this Explanation, had got fast hold of, and had thereby partly drawn him over to his Opinion) Who do you think, Mr. President, says he, are meant by the <HI>Church-Wardens, Sides-Men, Mark Slender, Lorry Slim, &amp;c.</HI>—Who do I think? says he, Why,—Why, Sir, as I take the Thing,—the <HI>Church-Wardens</HI> and <HI>Sides-Men,</HI> are the <HI>Electors</HI> and the other <HI>Princes</HI> who form the <HI>Germanick Body.</HI>—And as for the other subordinate Characters of <HI>Mark Slim,</HI>—the <HI>unlucky Wight</HI> in the Plush Breeches,—the <HI>Parson</HI>'s
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
<HI>Man</HI> who was so often out of the Way, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>—these, to be sure, are the se∣veral <HI>Marshals</HI> and <HI>Generals,</HI> who fought, or should have fought, under them the last Campaign.—The Men in <HI>Buckram,</HI> con∣tinued the President, are the Gross of the King of <HI>Prussia</HI>'s Army, who are as <HI>stiff</HI> a Body of Men as are in the World:—And <HI>Trim</HI>'s saying they were twelve, and then nineteen, is a Wipe for the <HI>Brussels Gazet∣teer,</HI> who, to my Knowledge, was never two Weeks in the same Story, about that or any thing else.</P>
<P>As for the rest of the <HI>Romance,</HI> continu∣ed the President, it sufficiently explains it∣self,—The <HI>Old-cast-Pair-of-Black-Plush-Breeches</HI> must be <HI>Saxony,</HI> which the <HI>Elec∣tor,</HI> you see, <HI>has left off wearing:</HI>—And as for the <HI>Great Watch-Coat,</HI> which, you know, covers all, it signifies all <HI>Europe;</HI> comprehending, at least, so many of its different States and Dominions, as we have any Concern with in the present War.</P>
<P>I protest, says a Gentleman who sat next but one to the President, and who, it seems, was the Parson of the Parish, a
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
Member not only of the Political, but also of a Musical Club in the next Street;—I protest, says he, if this Explanation is right, which I think it is,—That the whole makes a very fine Symbol.—You have always some Musical Instrument or other in your Head, I think, says the Al∣derman.—Musical Instrument! replies the Parson, in Astonishment,—Mr. Alder∣man, I mean an Allegory; and I think the greedy Disposition of <HI>Trim</HI> and his Wife, in ripping the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> to Pieces, in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one, and a Jerkin for the other, is one of the most beautiful of the Kind I ever met with; and will shew all the World what have been the true Views and Inten∣tions of the Houses of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Au∣stria</HI> in this abominable Coalition,—I might have called it Whoredom:—Nay, says the Alderman, 'tis downright Adul∣terydom, or nothing.</P>
<P>This Hypothesis of the President's ex∣plain'd every Thing in the <HI>Romance</HI> ex∣treamly well; and, withall, was delivered with so much Readiness and Air of Cer∣tainty, as begot an Opinion in two Thirds of the Club, that Mr. President was actu∣ally
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
the Author of the <HI>Romance</HI> himself: But a Gentleman who sat on the opposite Side of the Table, who had come piping∣hot from reading the History of King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>'s and Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Wars, and who was thought, at the Bottom, to envy the President the Honour both of the <HI>Romance</HI> and Explanation too, gave an entire new Turn to it all. He acquainted the Club, That Mr. President was altogether wrong in every Supposition he had made, except that one, where the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> was said by him to represent <HI>Europe,</HI> or at least a great Part of it:—So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our His∣tory to come at the Truth. He then ac∣quainted them, that the dividing the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> did, and could, allude to no∣thing else in the World but the <HI>Partition-Treaty;</HI> which, by the Bye, he told them, was the most unhappy and scandalous Transaction in all King <HI>William</HI>'s Life: It was that false Step, and that only, says he, rising from his Chair, and striking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence; it was that false Step, says he, knitting his Brows
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground, that has laid the Foundation of all the Disturbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour; and as for <HI>Trim</HI>'s giving up the <HI>Breeches,</HI> look ye, it is al∣most Word for Word copied from the <HI>French</HI> King and <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Renunciation of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> which all the World knew (as was the very Case of the <HI>Breeches</HI>) were renounced by them on pur∣pose to be reclaim'd when Time should serve.</P>
<P>This Explanation had too much Inge∣nuity in it to be altogether slighted; and, in Truth, the worst Fault it had, seem'd to be the prodigious Heat of it; which (as an Apothecary, who sat next the Fire, ob∣serv'd, in a very low Whisper to his next Neighbour) was so much incorporated into every Particle of it, that it was impossible, under such Fermentation, it should work its desired Effect.</P>
<P>This, however, no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman, though he sat the very next Man, from giving an Opinion as diametrically opposite as <HI>East</HI> is from <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="42"/>
This Gentleman, who was by much the best Geographer in the whole Club, and, moreover, second Cousin to an Engineer, was positive the <HI>Breeches</HI> meant <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> for, if you remember, Gentlemen, says he, tho' possibly you don't, the Ichnography and Plan of that Town and Fortress, it exactly resembles a Pair of Trunk-Hose, the two Promontories forming the two Slops, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>—Now we all know, con∣tinued he, that King <HI>George</HI> the First made a Promise of that important Pass to the King of <HI>Spain:</HI>—So that the whole Drift of the <HI>Romance,</HI> according to my Sense of Things, is merely to vindicate the King and the Parliament in that Transaction, which made so much Noise in the World.</P>
<P>A Wholesale Taylor, who from the Beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the Debate,—was at last drawn into it, by something very unexpected in the last Person's Argument.</P>
<P>He told the Company, frankly, he did not understand what <HI>Ichnography</HI> meant:—But as for the Shape of a <HI>Pair of Breeches,</HI> as he had had the Advantage of cutting out so many hundred Pairs in his
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
Life-Time, he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the Matter as another Man.</P>
<P>Now, to my Mind, says he, there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe (a Map of which, it seems, hung up in his Work-Shop) so like a <HI>Pair of Breeches</HI> unmade up, as the Island of <HI>Sicily:</HI>—Nor is there any thing, if you go to that, quoth an honest Shoe-maker, who had the Ho∣nour to be a Member of the Club, so much like a <HI>Jack-Boot,</HI> to my Fancy, as the Kingdom of <HI>Italy.</HI>—What the Duce has either <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Sicily</HI> to do in the Affair? cries the President, who, by this Time, began to tremble for his Hypothesis,—What have they to do?—Why, answered the <HI>Partition-Treaty</HI> Gentleman, with great Spirit and Joy sparkling in his Eyes,—They have just so much, Sir, to do in the Debate as to overthrow your Suppositions, and to establish the Certainty of mine be∣yond the Possibility of a Doubt: For, says he, (with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over the President's Politicks)—By the <HI>Partition-Treaty,</HI> Sir, both <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> were the very Kingdoms made to
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
devolve upon the <HI>Dauphin;</HI>—and <HI>Trim</HI>'s <HI>greasing the Parson's Boots,</HI> is a Devilish Satyrical Stroke;—for it exposes the Cor∣ruption and Bribery made Use of at that Juncture, in bringing over the several States and Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> to use their In∣terests at <HI>Rome,</HI> to stop the Pope from gi∣ving the Investitures of those Kingdoms to any Body else.—The Pope has not the In∣vestiture of <HI>Sicily,</HI> cries another Gentle∣man.—I care not, says he, for that.</P>
<P>Almost every one apprehended the De∣bate to be now ended, and that no one Member would venture any new Conjec∣ture upon the <HI>Romance,</HI> after so many clear and decisive Interpretations had been given. But, hold,—Close to the Fire, and op∣posite to where the Apothecary sat, there sat also a Gentleman of the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Cause, seem'd no way satisfied in his Conscience with any one Proceeding in it. This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their several Evi∣dences on the other Side;—reserving him∣self, like an expert Practitioner, for the last Word in the Debate. When the
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
<HI>Partition-Treaty-</HI>Gentleman had finish'd what he had to say,—He got up,—and, advancing towards the Table, told them, That the Error they had all gone upon thus far, in making out the several Facts in the <HI>Romance,</HI>—was in looking too high; which, with great Candor, he said, was a very natural Thing, and very excusable withall, in such a Political Club as theirs: For Instance, continues he, you have been searching the <HI>Registers,</HI> and looking into the <HI>Deeds</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Emperors,</HI>—as if Nobody had any <HI>Deeds</HI> to shew or compare the <HI>Romance</HI> to but themselves.—This, continued the Attorney, is just as much out of the Way of good Practice, as if I should carry a Thing slap-dash into the House of Lords, which was under forty Shillings, and might be decided in the next County-Court for six Shillings and Eight∣pence.—He then took the <HI>Romance</HI> in his Left Hand, and pointing with the Fore-Finger of his Right towards the second Page, he humbly begg'd Leave to observe, (and, to do him Justice, he did it in some∣what of a <HI>forensic Air</HI>) That the <HI>Parson, John,</HI> and <HI>Sexton,</HI> shewed incontestably the Thing to be <HI>Tripartite;</HI> now, if you will take Notice, Gentlemen, says he,
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
these several Persons, who are Parties to this Instrument, are merely Ecclesiastical; that the <HI>Reading-Desk, Pulpit-Cloth,</HI> and <HI>Velvet Cushion,</HI> are tripartite too; and are, by Intendment of Law, Goods and Chat∣tles merely of an Ecclesiastick Nature, be∣longing and appertaining 'only unto them,' <HI>and to them only.</HI>—So that it appears very plain to me, That the <HI>Romance,</HI> neither directly nor indirectly, goes upon Tempo∣ral, but altogether upon Church-Matters.—And do not you think, says he, soften∣ing his Voice a little, and addressing him∣self to the Parson with a forced Smile,—Do not you think Doctor, says he, That the Dispute in the <HI>Romance,</HI> between the <HI>Parson</HI> of the Parish and <HI>John,</HI> about the Height of <HI>John</HI>'s Desk, is a very fine Pa∣negyrick upon the <HI>Humility</HI> of <HI>Church-Men?</HI>—I think, says the Parson, it is much of the same Fineness with that which your Profession is complimented with, in the pimping, dirty, pettyfogging Character of <HI>Trim,</HI>—which, in my Opinion, Sir, is just such another Panegyrick upon the <HI>Honesty</HI> of <HI>Attornies.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing whets the Spirits like an In∣sult:—Therefore the Parson went on with
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
a visible Superiority and an uncommon Acuteness.—As you are so happy, Sir, continues he, in making Applications,—pray turn over a Page or two to the black Law-Letters in the <HI>Romance.</HI>—What do you think of them, Sir?—Nay,—pray read the Grant of the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI>—and <HI>Trim</HI>'s Renunciation of the <HI>Breeches.</HI>—Why, there is downright <HI REND="blackletterType">Lease</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">Release</HI> for you,—'tis the very Thing, Man;—only with this small Difference,—and in which consists the whole Strength of the Panegyric,—That the Author of the <HI>Romance</HI> has convey'd and re-convey'd, in about ten Lines,—what you, with the glo∣rious Prolixity of the Law, could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parch∣ment.</P>
<P>The Apothecary, who had paid the At∣torney, the same Afternoon, a Demand of Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight-Pence, for much such another Jobb,—was so highly tickled with the Parson's Repartee in that particular Point,—that he rubb'd his Hands together most fer∣vently,—and laugh'd most triumphantly thereupon.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48"/>
This could not escape the Attorney's Notice, any more than the Cause of it did escape his Penetration.</P>
<P>I think, Sir, says he, (dropping his Voice a Third) you might well have spared this immoderate Mirth, since you and your Profession have the least Reason to tri∣umph here of any of us.—I beg, quoth he, that you would reflect a Moment up∣on the <HI>Cob-Web</HI> which <HI>Trim</HI> went so far for, and brought back with an Air of so much Importance, in his Breeches Pocket, to lay upon the Parson's cut Finger.—This said Cob-Web, Sir, is a fine-spun Satyre, upon the flimsy Nature of one Half of the Shop-Medicines, with which you make a Property of the Sick, the Ig∣norant, and the Unsuspecting.—And as for the Moral of the <HI>Close-Stool-Pan,</HI> Sir, 'tis too plain,—Does not nine Parts in ten of the whole Practice, and of all you vend under <HI>its Colours,</HI> pass into and con∣center in that one nasty Utensil?—And let me tell you, Sir, says he, raising his Voice,—had not your unseasonable Mirth blinded you, you might have seen that <HI>Trim</HI>'s carrying the Close-Stool-Pan upon his Head the whole Length of the Town,
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
without blushing, is a pointed Raillery,—and one of the sharpest Sarcasms, Sir, that ever was thrown out upon you;—for it unveils the solemn Impudence of the whole Profession, who, I see, are ashamed of no∣thing which brings in Money.</P>
<P>There were two Apothecaries in the Club, besides the Surgeon mentioned be∣fore, with a Chemist and an Undertaker, who all felt themselves equally hurt and aggrieved by this discourteous Retort:—And they were all five rising up together from their Chairs, with full Intent of Heart, as it was thought, to return the <HI>Reproof Va∣liant</HI> thereupon.—But the President, fear∣ing it would end in a general Engagement, he instantly call'd out, <HI>To Order;</HI>—and gave Notice, That if there was any Member in the Club, who had not yet spoke, and yet did desire to speak upon the main Sub∣ject of the Debate,—that he should im∣mediately be heard.</P>
<P>This was a happy Invitation for a stam∣mering Member, who, it seems, had but a weak Voice at the best; and having often attempted to speak in the Debate, but to
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
no Purpose, had sat down in utter Despair of an Opportunity.</P>
<P>This Member, you must know, had got a sad Crush upon his Hip, in the late <HI>Election,</HI> which gave him intolerable An∣guish;—so that, in short, he could think of nothing else:—For which Cause, and others, he was strongly of Opinion, That the whole <HI>Romance</HI> was a just Gird at the late <HI>York</HI> Election; and I think, says he, that the <HI>Promise</HI> of the <HI>Breeches</HI> broke, may well and truly signify <HI>Somebody's else Promise,</HI> which was broke, and occasion'd so much Disturbance amongst us.</P>
<P>—Thus every Man turn'd the Story to what was swimming uppermost in his own Brain;—so that, before all was over, there were full as many Satyres spun out of it,—and as great a Variety of Person∣ages, Opinions, Transactions, and Truths, found to lay hid under the dark Veil of its Allegory, as ever were discovered in the thrice-renowned History of the Acts of <HI>Gargantua</HI> and <HI>Pantagruel.</HI></P>
<P>At the Close of all, and just before the Club was going to break up,—Mr. Presi∣dent
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
rose from his Chair, and begg'd Leave to make the two following Motions, which were instantly agreed to, without any Division.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Gentlemen, says he, as <HI>Trim</HI>'s Character in the <HI>Romance,</HI> of a shuffling intriguing Fellow,—whoever it was drawn for, is, in Truth, as like the <HI>French King</HI> as it can stare,—I move, That the <HI>Ro∣mance</HI> be forthwith <HI>printed:</HI>—For, conti∣nues he, if we can but once turn the Laugh against him, and make him asham'd of what he has done, it may be a great Means, with the Blessing of God upon our Fleets and Armies, to save the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> Place, I move, That Mr. Attorney, our worthy Member, be desired to take Minutes, upon the Spot, of every Conjecture which has been made upon the <HI>Romance,</HI> by the several Mem∣bers who have spoke; which, I think, says he, will answer two good Ends:</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> It will establish the Political Know∣ledge of our Club for ever, and place it in a respectable Light to all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52"/>
In the <HI>next</HI> Place, it will furnish what will be wanted; that is, a <HI>Key</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣mance.</HI>—In troth you might have said a whole Bunch of <HI>Keys,</HI> quoth a White∣smith, who was the only Member in the Club who had not said something in the Debate: But let me tell you, Mr. Presi∣dent, says he, That the <HI>Right Key,</HI> if it could but be found, would be worth the whole Bunch put together.</P>
