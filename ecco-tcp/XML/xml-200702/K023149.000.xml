<HEAD>A
NARRATIVE
OF THE
METHOD by which Mr. Pope's
Private Letters were procured
and published by EDMUND CURL,
Bookseller.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been judg'd, that to clear an
Affair which seem'd at first sight a lit∣tle
mysterious, and which, tho' it con∣cern'd
only one Gentleman, is of such a
Consequence, as justly to alarm every Per∣son
in the Nation, would not only be ac∣ceptable
as a <HI>Curiosity,</HI> but useful as a
<HI>Warning,</HI> and perhaps flagrant enough as
an <HI>Example,</HI> to induce the LEGISLATURE
to prevent for the future, an Enormity so
prejudicial to every private Subject, and so
destructive of Society it self.</P>
<P>This will be made so plain by the en∣suing
Papers, that 'twill scarce be needful to
attend them with any Reflections, more
than what every Reader may make.</P>

In the Year 1727, <HI>Edmund Curl,</HI> Book∣seller,
published a Collection of several pri∣vate
Letters of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to <HI>Henry Crom∣well</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which he obtain'd in this Man∣ner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was acquainted with one
Mrs. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to whom he had the Indis∣cretion
to lend these Letters, and who fall∣ing
into Misfortunes, seven Years after,
sold them to Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> without the Con∣sent
either of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> or Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
as appears from the following Letters.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To <HI>HENRY CROMWELL,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
<DATE>June 27, 1727.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>AFTER so long a Silence, as the
many and great Oppressions I have
sigh'd under has occasion'd, one is at a
Loss how to begin a Letter to so kind a
Friend as your self. But as it was always
my Resolution, if I must sink to do it as
decently (that is as silently) as I could: So
when I found my self plung'd into unfore∣seen,
and unavoidable Ruin, I retreated
from the World, and in a manner buried
my self in a dismal Place, where I knew
none, nor none knew me. In this dull
unthinking Way, I have protracted a lin∣gering
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Death (for Life it cannot be called)
ever since you saw me, sequestered from
Company, deprived of my Books, and no∣thing
left to converse with but the Letters
of my dead, or absent Friends, amongst
which latter I always placed yours, and
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s in the first Rank. I lent some
of them indeed to an ingenious Person,
who was so delighted with the Specimen,
that he importun'd me for a Sight of the
rest, which having obtain'd, he conveyed
them to the Press, I must not say altoge∣ther
with my Consent, nor wholly without
it. I thought them too good to be lost in
Oblivion, and no Cause to apprehend the
disobliging of any. The Publick, <HI>viz.</HI>
All Persons of Taste and Judgment,
would be pleased with so agreeable an
Amusement; Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> could not be
angry, since it was but Justice to his Merit,
to publish the solemn and private Profes∣sions
of Love, Gratitude and Veneration,
made to him by so celebrated an Au∣thor;
and surely Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ought not to
resent the Publication, since the early Preg∣nancy
of his Genius was no dishonour to
his Character. And yet had either of you
been ask'd, common Modesty would have
oblig'd you to refuse what you would not
have been displeas'd with if done without
your Knowledge; and besides, to end all
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Dispute, you had been pleased to make me
a free Gift of them to do what I pleased
with them: And every one knows that a
Person to whom a Letter is address'd, has
the same Right to dispose of it, as he has
of Goods purchased with his Money. I
doubt not but your Generosity and Ho∣nour
will do me the Right of owning by a
Line that I came honestly by them. I flat∣ter
my self in a few Months I shall again
be visible to the World, and whenever thro'
good Providence that Turn shall happen,
I shall joyfully acquaint you with it, there
being none more truly your obliged Ser∣vant
than, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Epsom, <DATE>July 6. 1727.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN these Letters were first
printed, I wonder'd how <HI>Curl</HI> could
come by them, and could not but laugh
at the pompous Title; since whatever you
wrote to me was Humour and familiar
Raillery. As soon as I came from <HI>Epsom,</HI>
I heard you had been to see me, and I
writ you a short Letter from <HI>Will</HI>'s, that
I long'd to see you. Mr. <HI>D—s</HI> about
that time charg'd me with giving them to
a Mistress, which I positively denied; not
in the least, at that time, thinking of it:
But some time after finding in the News-Papers,
Letters from Lady <HI>Packington,</HI>
Lady <HI>Chudleigh,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> to the
same <HI>Sapho,</HI> or <HI>E. T.</HI> I began to fear that
I was guilty. I have never seen these Let∣ters
of <HI>Curl</HI>'s, nor would go to his Shop
about them; I have not seen this <HI>Sapho,</HI>
alias <HI>E. T.</HI> these seven Years;—her
writing, <HI>That I gave her them to do what she
would with them,</HI> was straining the Point
too far: I thought not of it; nor do I
think she did then: But severe Necessity,
which catches hold of a Twig, has pro∣duced
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
all this; which has lain hid, and for∣got
by me, so many Years. <HI>Curl</HI> sent me
a Letter last Week, desiring a positive An∣swer
about this Matter, but finding I would
give him none, he went to <HI>E. T.</HI> and writ
a Postscript, in her long romantick Letter,
to direct my Answer to his House, but
they not expecting an Answer, sent a young
Man to me, whose Name it seems is <HI>Pat∣tisson;</HI>
I told him I should not write any
thing, but I believed it might be so as she
writ in her Letter. I am extreamly con∣cern'd
that my former Indiscretion, in put∣ting
them into the Hands of this <HI>Preti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use,</HI>
should have given you so much Disturb∣ance;
for the last thing I should do would
be to disoblige you; for whom I have ever
preserved the greatest Esteem, and shall
ever be, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful Friend,
and most humble Servant,
HENRY CROMWELL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>August 1. 1727.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I writ my long Narrative from
<HI>Epsom</HI> till I was tired, yet was I not
satisfied; left any Doubt should rest upon
your Mind. I could not make Protestations
of my Innocence of a grievous Crime; but
I was impatient till I came to Town, that
I might send you those Letters, as a clear
Evidence, that I was a perfect Stranger to
all their Proceedings. Should I have pro∣tested
against it, after the Printing, it
might have been taken for an Attempt to
decry his Purchase; and as the little Ex∣ception
you have taken, has serv'd him to
play his Game upon us for these two Years;
a new Incident from me might enable him
to play it on for two more:—The great
Value she expresses for all you write, and
her Passion for having them, I believe was
what prevailed upon me to let her keep
them. By the Interval of twelve Years at
least, from her Possession to the Time of
printing them, 'tis manifest that I had not
the least Ground to apprehend such a De∣sign:
But as People in great Straits, bring
forth their Hoards of old Gold, and most
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
valuable Jewels, so <HI>Sapho</HI> had recourse to
her hid Treasure of Letters, and plaid off,
not only yours to me, but all those to
her self (as the Ladies last Stake) into the
Press.—As for me, I hope, when you
shall cooly consider the many thousand
Instances of our being deluded by Females,
since that great Original of <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>Eve,</HI>
you will have a more favourable Thought
of the undesigning Error of,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful Friend,
and humble Servant,
HENRY CROMWELL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Treatment being extreamly disagree∣able
to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> he was advised to recal
any Letters which might happen to be pre∣served
by any of his Friends, particularly
those written to Persons deceas'd, which
would be most subject to such an Accident.
Many of these were return'd him.</P>
<P>Some of his Friends advised him to print
a Collection himself, to prevent a worse;
but this he would by no means agree to.
However, as some of the Letters served to
revive several past Scenes of Friendship, and
others to clear the Truth of <HI>Facts</HI> in which
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
he had been misrepresented by the com∣mon
Scribblers, he was induced to preserve
a few of his own Letters, as well as of his
Friends. These, as I have been told, he
inserted in TWO BOOKS, some Originals,
others Copies, with a few Notes and Ex∣tracts
here and there added. In the same
Books he caused to be copied some small
Pieces in Verse and Prose, either of his own,
or his Correspondents; which, tho' not fi∣nish'd
enough for the Publick, were such
as the Partiality of any Friend would be
sorry to be depriv'd of.</P>
<P>To this Purpose, an Amanuensis or two
were employ'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> when the
Books were in the Country, and by the
Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when they were in Town.</P>
<P>It happen'd soon after, that the <HI>Post∣humous
Works</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI> were pub∣lish'd,
in such a Manner, as could no way
increase the Reputation of that Gentleman,
who had been Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s first Correspon∣dent
and Friend; And several of these
Letters so fully shew'd the State of that
Case, that it was thought but a Justice to
Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI>'s Memory to print a few, to
discredit that Imposition. These were ac∣cordingly
transcrib'd for the Press from the
<HI>Manuscript Books</HI> above-mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
They were no sooner printed, but <HI>Ed∣mund
Curl</HI> look'd on these too as his Pro∣perty;
for a Copy is extant, which he
corrected in order to another Impression,
interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to,
in his own Hand.</P>
<P>He then advertis'd anew the Letters to Mr.
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> with <HI>Additions,</HI> and promis'd In∣couragement
to all Persons who should send
him more.</P>
<P>This is a Practice frequent with Booksel∣lers,
to swell an Author's Works, in which
they have some Property, with any Trash
that can be got from any Hand; or where
they have no such Works, to procure some.
<HI>Curl</HI> has in the same manner since adver∣tiz'd
the <HI>Letters</HI> of Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Addison.</HI> A Practice highly deserving some
Check from the Legislature; since every
such Advertisement, is really a <HI>Watch-word</HI>
to every <HI>Scoundrel</HI> in the Nation, and to
every <HI>Domestick</HI> of a Family, to get a Pen∣ny,
by producing any Scrap of a Man's Wri∣ting,
(of what Nature soever) or by picking
his Master's Pocket of Letters and Papers.</P>
<P>A most flagrant Instance of this kind
was the Advertisement of an intended Book,
call'd <HI>Gulliveriana Secunda;</HI> where it was
promis'd <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>any Thing,</HI> which <HI>any Body</HI>
should send as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s or Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s,
should be printed and inserted <HI>as Theirs.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
By these honest means, Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> went on
encreasing his Collection; and finding (as
will be seen hereafter by No. 5.) a further
Prospect of doing so, he retarded his Edition
of Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Letters till the Twenty-Second
of March 1734-5. and then sent
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> the following Letter, the first he
ever receiv'd from him.</P>

Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Friends imagin'd that the

it as <HI>corrected</HI> and <HI>revis'd</HI> by him.
Or if there was any such Proposal from <HI>P. T.

pay for the Copy with the very Mony he

<P>UNderstanding you propose to write

inform you, I can send you diverse Me∣moirs
which may be serviceable, if your
Design be really to do him neither Injustice,
nor shew him Favour. I was well ac∣quainted
with his Father, and with the first
part of his own Life, tho' since he has
treated me as a Stranger. It is certain
some late Pamphlets are not fair in re∣spect
to his Father, who was of the youn∣ger
Branch of a Family in good Repute in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and related to the Lords <HI>Downe,</HI>
formerly of the same Name. He was (as
he hath told me himself, and he was [very
different from his Son] a modest and plain
honest Man) a Posthumous Son, and left
little provided for, his elder Brother having
what small Estate there was, who afterwards
Study'd and dy'd at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He was put
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
to a Merchant in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and acquir'd a
moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which
he quitted at the Revolution in very good
Circumstances, and retir'd to <HI>Windsor</HI> For∣rest,
where he purchas'd a small Estate, and
took great Delight in Husbandry and Gar∣dens.
His Mother was one of seventeen
Children of <HI>W. Turnor</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> formerly of
<HI>Burfit Hall</HI> in the—Riding of <HI>Yorkshire.</HI>
Two of her Brothers were kill'd in the
Civil Wars. This is a true Account of
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Family and Parentage. Of
his Manners I cannot give so good an one,
yet as I would not wrong any Man, both
ought to be True; and if such be your
Design, I may serve you in it, not enter∣ing
into any Thing in any wise Libellous.

Conduct towards me. <HI>A propos</HI> to his Life,
there have lately fall'n into my Hands a
large Collection of his <HI>Letters,</HI> from the
former Part of his Days to the Year 1727,
which being more considerable than any
yet seen, and opening very many Scenes
new to the World, will alone make
a Perfect and the most authentick <HI>Life</HI>

To shew you my Sincerity and determi∣nate
Resolution of assisting you herein, I
will give you an Advertisement, which
you may publish forthwith if you please,
and on your so doing the Letters shall be
sent you. They will make a Four or Five-Sheet

<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
the Originals may be preserved in mine or

I am of Opinion these alone will contain

<P>I have not ever met with any thing more

of your Letters. The First bearing Date
<HI>Oct. 11th</HI> 1733. gives some Particulars of
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Life,</HI> which I shall shortly make
a publick Use of, in his Life now going

<P>The Second of your Letters of <HI>Nov.

publish an Advertisement of a Collection
of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters in your Custody,
the Originals should be forthwith sent me,
and for which you would expect no more
than what would pay for a Transcript of 'em.</P>
<P>In your Third Letter of the Fourth In∣stant,
you groundlesly imagine I have at∣tempted
to betray you to Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> say
you have printed these Letters your self,
and now want to be handsomely allow'd
for the Copy, <HI>viz. 3 l.</HI> a Score, which is
2 <HI>l.</HI> more than they cost Printing; ap∣point
a Meeting at the <HI>Rose</HI> on the <HI>22d.</HI>

fearing a Surprize from Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> How

you gave him Notice? I fear no such
Besettings either of him or his Agents.
That the paying of <HI>seventy-five</HI> Pounds
would bring you to Town in a Fortnight,

is to be at my Door, at Eight this

<P>You want seventy-five Pounds for a Per∣son
you would serve; That Sum I can ea∣sily
pay, if I think the Purchase would be
of any Service to me. But in one Word,
Sir, I am engaged all this Evening, and
shall not give my self any further Trouble
about such jealous, groundless, and dark
Negociations. An HONOURABLE and
OPEN DEALING is what I have been always

to perfect the first fifty Books, and likewise
the remaining three hundred Books, and
pray be at the <HI>Standard</HI> Tavern this Even∣ing,

My Defence is right, I only told the Lords,
I did not know from whence the Books
came, and that my Wife receiv'd them.
This was strict Truth, and prevented all
further Enquiry. The <HI>Lords declar'd</HI> they
had been made <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Tool.</HI> I put my
self upon this single Point, and insisted, as
there was not any Peer's Letter in the Book,
I had not been guilty of any Breach of Pri∣vilege.

will be kept no longer in the Dark: <HI>P. T.</HI>
is <HI>Will o' the Wisp;</HI> all the Books I have
had are Imperfect; the First 50 had no
Titles nor Prefaces, the last 5 Bundles
seiz'd by the Lords contain'd but 38 in
each Bundle, which amounts to 190, and
50, is in all but 240 Books. 7. As to the
Loss of a Future Copy, I despise it, nor
will I be concern'd with any more such
dark suspicious Dealers. But now Sir I'll
tell you what I will do; when I have
the Books perfected which I have already
receiv'd, and the rest of the Impression
I will pay you for them. But what do
you call this Usage? First take a Note
for a Month and then want it to be chang'd
for one of Sir <HI>Richard Hoare</HI>'s—My
Note is as good, for any Sum I give it, as
the BANK, and shall be as punctually paid.
I always say, <HI>Gold is better than Paper,</HI>
and 20 <HI>l.</HI> I will pay, if the Books are per∣fected
to morrow Morning, and the rest
sent, or to Night is the same thing to me.

<HI>ever sent me,</HI> of which I have <HI>exact copies;</HI>

<P>We are Inform'd, that notwithstanding the
Pretences of <HI>Edmund Curl,</HI> the Original Let∣ters
of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> with the Post-Marks up∣on

whence they were copy'd, and that so many
Omissions and Interpolations have been made
in this Publication as to render it Impossible for
Mr. <HI>P.</HI> to own them in the Condition they
appear.</P>
