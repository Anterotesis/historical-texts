<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>LUTARCH,</HI> that justly admired philosopher, who has greatly ob∣liged the world by his writings, and, amongst these, by the many curious <HI>Apophthegms</HI> he has given us of the wise and good men of antiquity, tells us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Socrates, meeting one day with Menon, whom he considered as a man well exercised in all the varieties of conversa∣tion, as well as a great proficient in specu∣lative wisdom, ask'd him, WHAT IS VIR∣TUE? And that Menon answer'd, There were proper virtues for Youth and Old-age,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
for Man and Woman, for Magistrate and Private person, for Master and Servant. An answer, which (the writer says) excited the admiration and applause of Socrates."</Q></P>
<P>But, what would this wise heathen have said, and how much greater would have been his transport, had his friend Menon, by way of answer, presented him with writings, in which he had entered minutely into <HI>the nature of the Virtues</HI> proper for such different <HI>Ages, Sexes,</HI> and <HI>Stations;</HI> had he described these social ex∣cellencies, so <HI>affectingly,</HI> as to command atten∣tion, so <HI>accurately,</HI> as to prevent mistake, and so <HI>invitingly,</HI> as to engage imitation!</P>
<P>But a delineation of moral Virtue, like this, was beyond the powers of human <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> and the utmost efforts of antient <HI>Philoso∣phy.</HI> And it is to REVELATION (that <HI>greater light</HI> to rule the moral world) that we owe the more perfect knowledge, not only of <HI>Religion,</HI> in matters relative to GOD, but of <HI>Virtue</HI> also, in matters relative to <HI>ourselves, and one another.</HI> No wonder, therefore, that what Menon only mentioned in the general, and what even So∣crates could not have described justly in the particulars, should have been executed in these
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
latter times, with greater clearness and pre∣cision.</P>
<P>And yet, whatever improvements have been made by Christians in the system of Moral Duty; how powerfully soever men are now exhorted to act like <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> be∣ings; how strongly soever those exhortations are enforced by the surer and more animating sanctions of the Gospel; yet—is it not too visible, that immorality and irreligion still ob∣tain in the lives of <HI>many,</HI> and, perhaps, (dread∣ful thought!) of the <HI>majority?</HI> And shall not every man, who is convinced of the real im∣portance of virtuous principles and practices, and of the very frequent apostasy from them, stand forth, and prevent, as far as in him lies, this alarming degeneracy from growing more prevalent?</P>
<P>Many (it is acknowledged, with pleasure and with gratitude) have been the laudable at∣tempts of writers, in our own country, to ob∣tain this end; and these both from the <HI>clergy</HI> and <HI>laity.</HI> And a valuable accession has been made, within the last fourteen years, by an author modestly <HI>anonymous,</HI> in his Three Works called, PAMELA, CLARISSA, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Sir CHARLES GRANDISON! Works, which amiably illustrate, and strongly enforce, the proper Virtues of <HI>Man and Woman, Parent and Child, Old-age and Youth, Master and Ser∣vant!</HI> Each of them commuicated in <HI>a re∣gular collection of Familiar Letters,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"written to the moment, while the heart is agi∣tated by hopes and fears, on events un∣decided."</Q> A method which must engage more strongly, and prove far more interest∣ing to, the reader, than a cold, unanimating narrative of events long since determined.</P>
<P>With such a knowledge of life and manners, as is displayed in those Works; with a capa∣city to entertain with wit, and enliven with humour, as well as to correct with delicacy, and exhort with dignity; we cannot but greatly respect the man, who, in an age <HI>like this,</HI> has attempted to steal upon the world <HI>reformation,</HI> under the notion of <HI>amusement;</HI> who has found the expedient of engaging the <HI>private attention</HI> of those, who put themselves out of the reach of <HI>public exhortation;</HI> pur∣suing to their <HI>closets</HI> those who fly from the <HI>pulpit;</HI> and there, under the gay air, and captivating semblance of a <HI>Novel,</HI> tempting
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
them to the perusal of many a persuasive <HI>Sermon.</HI></P>
<P>In order to render these Letters more com∣pletely useful, in this volume are collected their various important <HI>Maxims,</HI> digested un∣der their general heads; with <HI>references</HI> from each Maxim to its proper volume and page. A work this, that has not been more pro∣ductive of trouble, than (I presume) it will be of entertainment and advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Sententious Maxims</HI> and <HI>Moral Aphorisms,</HI> col∣lecting into a point, and concisely, but strongly, expressing <HI>elevated thoughts, beautiful senti∣ments,</HI> or <HI>instructive lessons,</HI> have always been well received by the public. They have been considered as the first strokes of a picture, in which are seen the justness and beauty of the painter's design, though it has not the co∣louring.</P>
<P>The <HI>maxims of state,</HI> for instance, drawn up by Lord HALIFAX, have been greatly esteemed; as being the result of long expe∣rience, and sound policy. And the <HI>maxims</HI> of ROCHEFOUCAULT have met with a reception perhaps too favourable; as their tendency
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
seems to be, to <HI>disgrace human nature,</HI> and <HI>de∣stroy all the virtues.</HI> And indeed the translator of them says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I must confess, I have not read any thing in this age, that has given me a greater <HI>contempt</HI> for man."</Q></P>
<P>The very reverse of this, is the plan on which the following Maxims are grounded; namely, on <HI>the real</HI> dignity <HI>of human nature,</HI> in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatness. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It exhibits man, as he really is; a compound, probationary be∣ing: fallen indeed from the primitive <HI>per∣fection</HI> of his nature, yet still great and amiable in the <HI>sincerity</HI> of his virtues: fre∣quently rebelling against the sacred laws of reason and revelation, and then always an enemy to his own happiness, and the peace of society: But sometimes so worthily im∣proving the graces and the gifts of heaven, as to secure the blessing of others, and the applause of his own mind; and advancing, within his proper sphere of action, the sal∣vation of himself and his fellow-creatures, by a life exemplary in all the duties of a Man and of a Christian!"</Q></P>
<P>Such is the great plan, such the benevolent
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
scheme, of those three collections of <HI>Familiar Letters;</HI> which have been already translated into several foreign languages, and received in our own country with uncommon favour. But as the <HI>narrative</HI> part of those Letters was only meant as a vehicle for the <HI>instructive,</HI> no wonder that many readers, who are desirous of fixing in their minds those maxims which de∣serve notice distinct from the story that first introduced them, should have often wished and pressed to see them separate from that chain of engaging incidents that will sometimes steal the most fixed attention from its pursuit of serious truth.</P>
<P>For the use therefore of all such as are desirous of <HI>repeatedly inculcating</HI> on their own minds, and the minds of others, the import∣ant <HI>Maxims,</HI> which those three works con∣tain; and who would <HI>refer</HI> themselves oc∣casionally to the volumes for the illustration of these maxims; this <HI>General Index</HI> both of <HI>Maxims</HI> and of <HI>References</HI> is now offered to the public in one pocket volume.</P>
<P>I shall only remark farther, that the <HI>Histo∣ries</HI> may be considered as the LIVES of so ma∣ny eminent persons, and this collection of
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
<HI>Maxims,</HI> as the MORALS. And I presume, to add, with all due deference to the sentiments of others;—that <HI>These Lives and Morals</HI> will perhaps last as long, probably be as much ad∣mired, and certainly prove much more exten∣sively beneficial (as they describe persons ex∣emplary in <HI>private</HI> and <HI>common</HI> life), than the <HI>Lives and Morals</HI> of the HEROES of the truly illustrious philosopher mentioned in the be∣ginning of this Preface.</P>

<HEAD>Address <HI>to the Rich.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OW great will be the condemnation of the Rich, at the great Day of Account, when they shall be asked, What uses they made of the opportunities put into their hand to do good to their indigent fellow creatures; and are able only to say—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have lived but to ourselves: We heaped up treasures for those who came after us, tho' we knew not but <HI>they</HI> would make a still worse use of them, than we ourselves have done,"</Q> ii. 207, 208. [201, 202].</P>
<P>Little knows the narrow-minded man the pleasures that fill the heart of a beneficent person, on reflecting on the good he has been enabled to do to worthy objects, ii. 207. [201]. [<HI>See</HI> Beneficence. <HI>The</HI> Rich.</P>

<HEAD>Advantages <HI>of Men over Women, owing to Women
themselves.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE love of praise, and to be flattered and admired, which predominates in the sex, from sixteen to sixty, gives the men great advantages over them, iv. 465. [407].</P>
<P>The readiness with which women are apt to forgive the men who have deceived other women;</P>
<P>And that inconsiderate notion of too many of them, <HI>that a reformed rake makes the best husband,</HI> are great en∣couragements to vile men to continue their profligacy, iv. 466, &amp; seq. [407, &amp; seq].</P>
<P>Virtue and Sobriety are surely as beautiful parts of a man's character as of a woman's. The most abandon'd of men think these Graces indispensable in the women they hope to marry—Shall women of prudence dispense with them in the men they choose for partners for life? iv. 467. [408].</P>
<P>The foolish vanity which some women have in the hopes of reforming a wild young fellow, which others of their sex have in vain tried to do, has often cost them the happiness of their lives; and given, at the same time, great encouragement to men to continue in their guilt; and to add, to their other vices, that of hypocrisy, if they think the object a prize worth feigning for, iv. 467, 468. [409].</P>
<P>The cruelty of women to an unhappy creature, who has been betrayed by the perfidy of her Lover; while they scruple not to admit among them the vile seducer, is another great encouragement to base and artful men, iv. 468. [409].</P>

<P>PERSONS may the rather hope to be extricated from difficulties and distresses, if they have not involved them∣selves in them by their vanity and presumption, i. 266. [212].</P>
<P>In some apprehended evils, the very event we dread, often brings relief, i. 288. [229].</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
What we look upon as our greatest unhappiness in a difficulty we are involved in, may possibly be the evil hastening to its crisis, and happy days may ensue, i. 288. [230].</P>
<P>How knows a person, struggling with Calamity, what ends the Almighty has to bring about, by the trials he is exercised with? Was not <HI>Joseph</HI>'s exaltation owing to his unjust imprisonment? i. 288. [230].</P>
<P>Distresses, however heavy at the time, appear light, and even joyous, to the reflecting mind, when worthily overcome, ii. 57. [79].</P>
<P>In a deep distress, we are apt to engage every body in it; and to wonder that things animate and inanimate wear the same face they did while our hearts were free and easy, iv. 170. [154]. [<HI>See</HI> Beneficence. Resignation.</P>

<HEAD>Advice <HI>to young married Women.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUNG married Women who grow negligent in their dress, shew a slight to the husband, that they shewed not to the lover; and as good as declare, that they are indifferent about preserving the heart, which perhaps they took no small pains to engage, ii. 215. [207].</P>

<HEAD>Advice <HI>to Young Women.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Woman, of whatever degree, who keeps men at a modest distance, will be sure to be the more valued for it, even by those who had formed designs upon her honour, i. 9. [8].</P>
<P>A truly worthy and modest Young Woman will value herself more on being descended from honest parents, though poor, than if she were high-born, and her pa∣rents unworthy, i. 11. [9].</P>
<P>The Young Woman who, at the request of her pre∣tended lover, keeps secret the indecencies offered to her by him, encourages him to repeat them, i. 26, 27. [22].</P>
<P>The anger of a superior to a Young Woman, who has had the virtue to repulse him, is to be considered by her as her glory, i. 28. [23].</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"/>
She that is more ashamed of dishonesty than of po∣verty, will not be easily overcome, i. 29. 44, 45. [24. 54].</P>
<P>A Young Woman whose virtue has been once attempt∣ed, yet throws herself into the same person's company, or continues where he is, when she can avoid it, ought to charge herself with the consequences, if she receives new indignities, i. 50. 93. [41. 72, 73.] iii. 254. [201].</P>
<P>Those things disgrace not men, in the eye of the world, which ruin Women, i. 54. [44].</P>
<P>The man who is capable of rudeness to a Woman, to whom he professes honourable love, ought to be reject∣ed as an husband, by a Woman of virtue and spirit, for his sake, as well as for the sake of her own honour, i. 64. [52, 53].</P>
<P>How much better is it by good fame and integrity, to get every one's good word but one, than by pleasing that one, to incur the censure of every-body else! i. 70. [57].</P>
<P>A man professing honour to a Woman, has it gene∣rally in his power to convince her of his sincerity by more than words, i. 228. [181.]</P>
<P>Wicked men will stoop to the most degrading mean∣ness to obtain a favourite end, i. 338. [270].</P>
<P>If a Woman knows a man to be a libertine, yet will, without scruple, give him her company, he will think half the ceremony between them is over; and will pro∣bably only want an opportunity to make her repent of her confidence in him, iii. 230. [182].</P>
<P>When a man wishes a Young Woman of inferior cir∣cumstances to confide in his <HI>Honour,</HI> he ought to be ex∣plicite, and not leave it to her to explain, in her own perhaps <HI>too</HI> hopeful way, what he means by the word. In short, the word <HI>Marriage</HI> is as soon spoken as the word <HI>Honour,</HI> iii. 437. [345].</P>
<P>Men frequently take little liberties with Women; and as those are received, are encouraged or discouraged from greater; so that it is in a Woman's power, effectu∣ally to over-awe an audacious presumer; and obtain even such a one's good opinion and esteem, iii. 469 to 473. [371 to 375].</P>
<P>A Young Woman will be in less danger when she
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
rather fears an enemy in the acquaintance she favours of the other sex, than hopes a friend; especially as so much depends upon the issue either of her doubt, or of her confidence, iv. 446. [390].</P>
<P>A prudent Woman will not want to be reminded, with regard to her conduct to fops, coxcombs, and pretty fellows, that she is not always secure in their company, by her superior good sense; since good Generals trusting to their strength and skill, have been often defeated by a weak enemy, iv. 447. [391].</P>
<P>The wife of a self-admirer must expect a very cold and negligent husband, iv. 448. [392].</P>
<P>The Young Woman who will admit into her company any man who shall be of opinion, and know it to be <HI>hers,</HI> that it is his province to ask, hers to deny, will expose her reputation, if not her virtue, to great risques, iv. 449. [393].</P>
<P>Presuming men are always ready to construe every little civility in their own favour, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Men have generally more hardness of heart than Wo∣men; whence the latter, when they meet not with men of honour, engage upon very unequal terms, iv. 454. [397].</P>
<P>It is so customary with Men to make promises and vows, and to set light by them when made, that a Wo∣man ought not to regard any thing they either say or vow, that carries not demonstration with it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The difference in the education of men and Women, must give the former great advantages over the latter, even where genius's are equal, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A man who is worthy of the Woman he pretends to love, needs not, generally speaking, take indirect means to obtain her in marriage, iv. 455. [398].</P>
<P>Hope, in material cases, should never be unaccom∣panied by fear, iv. 458. [400].</P>
<P>When a Young Woman begins to find in her own heart an inclination to a man, pretending love to her; then, if he be not a man of undoubted honour, is her danger doubled, as ought to be her vigilance; since she has <HI>herself</HI> to guard against, as well as him; iv. 458. [401].</P>
<P>A prudent Woman will not trust to her lover's mercy
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
or honour, but to her own discretion; and the rather, as, if he mean well, he himself will value her the more for it; if not well, she will detect him the sooner, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The doubt which a Woman has of her lover's honour is needful, not only to preserve her own, but his. If she wrongs him, she can make him amends by instances of greater confidence, when she pleases: But if yesterday she granted him little favours, he will not allow her this day to recede; till at last, perhaps, she puts herself out of her own power into his, in order to manifest the in∣sisted-on generosity of her affection for him, iv. 460. [402.]</P>
<P>There have been cases, where a man himself, pursu∣ing the dictates of his encroaching passion, and finding a Woman conceding, has taken advantages, which pro∣bably at first he did not presume to think of, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>BASHFUL people frequently confound themselves by endeavouring to avoid confusion, i. 77. [59.].</P>
<P>Bashfulness, even to a fault, is always to be pre∣ferred to an undistinguishing and hardy confidence, iv. 383. [335].</P>
<P>Sheepishness is a damp upon merit, iv. 383. [335]. Yet it may be looked upon as an outward fence or in∣closure to virtue, which may keep off the lighter attacks of immorality, iv. 384. [335].</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16"/>
It may be expected that a sheepish youth is docile, humane, good-humoured, diffident; while a mind that never doubts itself is likely to be conceited, impetuous, over-bearing, incorrigible, iv. 384. [335].</P>

<P>VIRTUE only is the true Beauty, i. 18. [15].</P>

<P>The beneficent heart gives benignity to the counte∣nance, i. 14. [11, 12.]</P>
<P>Where the power of doing a beneficent action is wanting, there is nearly as much merit in the will to do it, as in the fact, ii. 163. [160].</P>
<P>The fortune of a person who has the blessing of a be∣neficent heart, is the more valuable to him, as it enables him to reward merit, where-ever he finds it, ii. 163. [160].</P>
<P>The pleasure of doing good to our not unworthy fel∣low-creatures, who stand in need of our relief, is of it∣self a sufficient reward for our Beneficence, were there to be no after-remuneration, ii. 207. [201]. iv. 369. [322].</P>

<P>A GOOD person will rather choose to be censured for doing his duty, than for a defect in it, iii. 300. [237.]</P>
<P>Were evil actions to pass uncensured, good ones would lose their reward; and vice, by being put on a foot with virtue in this life, would meet with general counte∣nance, iii. 342. [270.]</P>
<P>No one is exempt from Calumny. Words said, the occasion of saying them not known, however justly re∣ported, may bear a very different construction from what they would have done, had the occasion been told, iv. 211. [182].</P>

<HEAD>Cautions <HI>to young Female Servants.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE least freedoms of a master to his handsome Fe∣male Servant, and even his smiles, when he is alone with her, are to be apprehended by her, as meaning too much for her honesty, i. 6. 42. [5. 35].</P>
<P>She is then to be most apprehensive for her virtue, when she finds her heart elated with joy and gratitude for the distinction he pays her, i. 6. [5].</P>
<P>No riches, no favour of the great, can compensate for the loss of virtue, i. 6. [6].</P>
<P>The young woman who sacrifices her virtue to the distinction paid her by her master, may well be said to be too grateful, i. 6. [6].</P>
<P>A handsome Female Servant should not wish to live in the house of a single man, since she will be likely by it to suffer in her reputation in the world's eye; may be more subject to temptation: and if he marry, will not, most probably, be continued in her place by his wife, i. 10. [8].</P>
<P>Distance, regulated by civility, and a freedom from pride, will make a young woman in service respected by her equals, and valued by her superiors, i. 12. [10].</P>
<P>Great favour shewn to a handsome young woman of low fortune, by a man of high, is to be suspected, i. 17. [14].</P>

<HEAD>Children <HI>in their early Infancy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SLEEP is an admirable nourisher both to the once young, and the twice young, iv. 329. [285].</P>
<P>It is a most inconsiderate, foolish, and pernicious custom in nurses, to awaken the Child from its nourish∣ing sleep, for fear it should suffer from hunger, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Nurses, by cramming and stuffing the little bowels of Infants till they are ready to burst, occasion indigestions, which turn to bad humours, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Infants can have no corrupt taste to gratify. All in them is pure, as out of the hand of nature: the food therefore that is given them should be plain; all that is not so, must vitiate and offend:</P>
<P>How bad then is the custom which nurses have, to mix wine or spirituous liquors, however small in quan∣tity, in their liquid food, on pretence of breaking the wind generated in their bowels! iv. 328. [286.]</P>
<P>Children should not be used to physic. That given them by way of precaution, as it is called, introduces the necessity of physic. Would a parent beget a dis∣order where there is none? or, by frequent use, render the salutary force of medicine ineffectual when it was wanted? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>See Pamela's description of an Infant pinned down,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
<HI>and swathed round with a roller, ten or a dozen times; blanket upon blanket wrapt round it: Its head oppressed with covering upon covering: its arms pinioned close to its body: its legs hundled up as if to prevent those kindly stretchings which ought to be promoted as so many efforts for growth and enlargement; lying a miserable little captive on the nurse's lap: its head pinned by stays to the shoulders; goggling and staring with its eyes, the only organs it has at liberty, as if supplicating for freedom to its fettered limbs,</HI> iv. 328.

<HEAD>Children <HI>how to be treated in their Infantile State, with a View

<P>CHILDREN'S minds are sooner capable of cultiva∣tion, than is generally imagined, iv. 325. [284.]</P>
<P>May not the Child which can tell its wants, and make known its inclinations, be easily made sensible of what is expected from it, if proper methods be taken with it? iv. 326. [284].</P>
<P>For, sometimes signs and tokens, and even looks, uniformly practised, will do as well as words; as we see in such of the young of the Brute Creation as we are disposed to domesticate, and to teach to practise those little tricks of which the docility of their nature makes them capable, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>There is such a natural connexion and progression be∣tween the infantile and more adult state of Childrens minds, that those who would know how to account for their inclinations, should not be wholly inattentive to them in the former state, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Every creature has its natural or instinctive pointings, as they may be called, teaching it to choose its good, and to avoid what is hartful to it. In Infants, the de∣sire they have to be carried abroad, into the free air, is one of those, iv. 327. [285].</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="21"/>
The wisest ought not to be above attending to the first rules for the management of Infants. If the Child has not good health (and are not early rules the founda∣tion of that blessing?) its animal functions will play but poorly thro' weak and crazy organs, iv. 330. [287].</P>
<P>At two or three years old, or before, the Buds of Childrens minds will begin to open, a watchful Parent will then be employed, like a skilful gardener, in defend∣ing the flower from blights, and assisting it thro' its several stages to perfection, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>An unreasonable appetite is to be checked at its first appearance, iv. 331. [289].</P>
<P>But if small and innocent indulgences will lead the Child to an observance of its duty, it may be complied with in such, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Great vigilance should be exercised over the tempers of Children, when their notices of things and persons grow strong and significant, iv. 412. [360].</P>
<P>Childrens future tempers, as to benevolence, may be guessed at by their willingness to part with any thing they are fond of, iv. 413. [360].</P>
<P>Children should not be allowed to enter too early into discourse with grown people; nor to give their opinions on subjects, unless called upon to do so;</P>
<P>Since knowledge is obtained rather by hearing than speaking, iv. 417. [364].</P>
<P>Yet they ought to be encouraged to ask questions for their information, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

The principles of universal benevolence and kind∣ness, especially to inferiors, should be early inculcated in the minds of Children of birth and condition, iv. 361. [315].</P>
<P>No part of their superiority will be hereby lost, says Mr <HI>Locke;</HI> but the distinction increased, and their au∣thority strengthened, when love in inferiors is joined with outward respect, and an esteem of the person has a share in their submission, iv. 360. [314].</P>

[265].</P>
<P>A generous mind will choose to win youth to do its
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
duty, by mildness and good usage, rather than by seve∣rity, iv. 332. [289].</P>
<P>It must be painful to such a one to be always incul∣cating on his children or pupils, the doctrine of self-denial, in cases of an indifferent nature, by methods quite grievous to his own, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Encouragements given to children, should, however, be innocent ones; and not such as should lead to lux∣ury, either of food or apparel, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The Almighty, by rewards and punishments, makes it our interest, as well as our duty, to obey him; and can we propose to ourselves, for the government of our children, a better example? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>We must not expect from children, at an early age, that they should distinguish beyond facts, iv. 333. [290].</P>
<P><HI>Grown</HI> people have an eye to the reward for service performed; nor will deserve to be thought less good or virtuous, that they do a painful duty, and even that they submit to be servants, for the reward's sake, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Self-denial is indeed an excellent doctrine to be in∣culcated into children's minds; and it must be done early too; but we must not be too severe in enforcing it; for a duty too rigidly insisted on, will make it odious, iv. 334. [290].</P>
<P>A child should not be either compelled or induced by rewards, to endeavour to master a study or byass (that is not an indispensable requisite to his future life or morals) to which it shews a natural or riveted aver∣sion, iv. 335. [292].</P>
<P>If the Education and Studies of children were suited to their inclinations and capacities, many would be made useful members of society, that otherwise would make no figure in it, iv. 336. [292].</P>
<P>If, as the child grows up, its mind can be raised from the love of the reward, to the love of its duty for the duty's sake, it should by all means be done, iv. 336. [293].</P>
<P>The child which can be brought to prefer its duty to its appetites, (<HI>as Mr. Locke proposes it should</HI>) wants but little of the self-denial of the wisest philosopher, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If the child refuses obedience, the parent must insist
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
upon it: The necessity of using severity may be the issue: A wise parent will therefore make as few things as pos∣sible necessary parts of its duty, except they are likely to affect its future morals, iv. 337. [293].</P>
<P>Children, from their beginning to talk, <HI>Mr. Locke says,</HI> should have about them some sober, discreet per∣son, whose care it should be, to keep them from the in∣fection of bad company, iv. 338, 339. [295].</P>
<P>An acquaintance with the muses, in the Education of youth, contributes not a little to soften the manners. It gives a delicate turn to the imagination, and a kind of polish to the mind in severer studies, iv. 353. [308].</P>
<P>However, it is not to wished, that a youth should have such strong inclinations that way, as to make that delightful amusement his predominant passion; since we see very few poets whose warm imaginations do not run away with their judgments, iv. 354. [308].</P>
<P>And yet, in order to learn the dead languages in their purity, it will be necessary to study the antient poets; which cannot fail of giving youth a relish for poetry in general, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Latin and Language, <HI>in Mr. Locke's judgment,</HI> is the least part of Education, iv. 386. [337].</P>
<P><HI>See his method by which a mother may teach her son Latin, without her understanding it herself; and Pamela's reasonings upon it,</HI> iv. 385, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> [337, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI></P>
<P><HI>See also his method of instructing a child at once in Latin and French, Arithmetic, Geography, Chrono∣logy, History, and Geometry, with an instance in point, as quoted by Pamela,</HI> iv. 388, [340].</P>
<P>Languages and Sciences, and all other accomplish∣ments of Education, will be to no purpose, Mr. Locke observes, but to make the worse and more dangerous man, if the tutor makes it not his chief care to form the mind of his scholar, so as to keep out evil and vicious habits, iv. 386. [338].</P>
<P>On a <HI>Home</HI> and <HI>School</HI> EDUCATION.</P>
<P>MR. Locke, for several weighty reasons, prefers a <HI>Home</HI> to a <HI>School</HI> Education; but makes it next to im∣possible
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
to procure such a tutor, as he thinks necessary to direct it, iv. 338. [294]. [<HI>See</HI> TUTOR.</P>
<P>It is impossible, he says, that in a <HI>School</HI> Education, a master can have a great number of boys under his eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any longer than they are in School together, iv. 342. [338].</P>
<P><HI>Hence Pamela takes occasion humbly to propose it as a matter for her Mr. B's consideration and determina∣tion, Whether there cannot be found out,</HI></P>
<P><HI>A middle way of</HI> EDUCATION <HI>between both.</HI></P>
<P>CANNOT, <HI>asks she,</HI> some master be engaged, who shall be so well rewarded for his care of a few, as shall make it worth his while to be contented with those few? Suppose five, six, seven, or eight, at most, whose mo∣rals and good breeding he may attend to, as well as to their learning? iv. 343. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> [299, <HI>&amp; seq</HI>].</P>
<P>The further this master lives from the friends of the young gentleman, perhaps the better it will be, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>He should be a man of mild temper; but strict in his discipline;</P>
<P>One who makes it a rule not to give correction for small faults; or till every other method has been tried;</P>
<P>Who carries such a just dignity in his manner, with∣out the appearance of tyranny, that his looks may be of greater force than the chidings of some; and his chid∣ings than the stripes of others;</P>
<P>And who will rather endeavour to shame, than terrify a youth out of his faults:</P>
<P>She supposes, that this gentleman should allot a par∣ticular portion of time for the prosecuting of the more <HI>learned</HI> studies;</P>
<P>And before the youth was tired with them, she sup∣poses another portion should be allotted for writing and arithmetic;</P>
<P>And then, for a relief to his mind, that the dancing∣master should take his part;</P>
<P>Innocent recreations to fill up the rest, at his own choice; in which, diverted by such a rotation of em∣ployments (all rendered delightful by their successive variety), he would hardly wish to pass much time;</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="34"/>
Since the dancing itself will answer both parts; that of good breeding, and that of exercise;</P>
<P>And thus different Studies may at once be mastered.</P>
<P>Moreover, the emulation which will be raised where there are several young gentlemen, will greatly lessen the trouble of the tutor, and advance the learning of the pupils:</P>
<P>An emulation which cannot be obtained in a home education, where there is but a single youth to be taken care of;</P>
<P>Such a master, not having a great number of servants, will be better able to answer for their conduct and be∣haviour;</P>
<P>The young gentlemen will have young gentlemen for their companions; all under the influence of the same precepts and example;</P>
<P>And as little honours and distinctions must needs be very attractive to the minds of youth, suppose, as a re∣ward for some excellence, the excelling youth should be set to read at a little desk raised a step or two, to his master and schoolfellows, sometimes a little portion from the best translations of the Greek or Roman histories, at other times from the English histories;</P>
<P>The master explaining difficult passages and customs, as the youth proceeded;</P>
<P>Might not this, in a very engaging manner, initiate them into the knowlege of the history of past times, and of their own country; and lead them, in the master's absence, to pass some of their vacant hours in the like laudable manner?</P>
<P>Why may not like triumphs on excelling be as incen∣tive to engage children to conquer difficult tasks, as the Roman triumphs, their civic and mural crowns, were to the heroes of old; since men, as the poet observes, are but children of a larger growth? iv. 346. [301].</P>
<P><HI>But if a</HI> Home Education <HI>is chosen, to which Pa∣mela, as well as Mr. Locke inclines, she thus expa∣tiates upon the qualities of a tutor;</HI> iv. 349. [304].</P>
<P>He ought to be a man of free and generous principles; yet not tainted with sceptical or heterodox notions,</P>
<P>Who has travelled, and preserved his moral character unimpeached;</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="35"/>
Whose behaviour and carriage is easy, unaffected, gen∣teel;</P>
<P>Who is not, on one hand, dogmatical, positive, or over∣bearing; on the other, yielding, suppliant, fawning;</P>
<P>Who will study the child's natural bent, in order to direct his genius to the attainment which he is most likely to master:</P>
<P>In order to preserve the respect due to his own cha∣racter with every one, he must not be a tale-bearer, a whisperer, a busy-body in the family;</P>
<P>Must, on the contrary, have a benevolent turn of mind: Be ready, without officiousness, to compose dif∣ferences;</P>
<P>Who will avoid the foppishness in dress, by which the petit-maitres and French ushers at boarding-schools often distinguish themselves; since peculiarities of habit, and uncharacteristic appearance, generally denote a wrong head, iv. 350. [304, &amp; seq].</P>
<P><HI>As in a</HI> home education <HI>it will be very difficult to keep children, as Mr. Locke requires, from the con∣versation of servants;</HI></P>
<P>It will be a securer as well as more laudable method, for parents to insist upon the regular behaviour of the whole family, than to expect that the child and its tutor shall be the only good ones in it, iv. 355. [310].</P>
<P>Nor is this so difficult to be effected, as some may imagine. If, on the hiring of a new servant, sobriety of manners, and a virtuous conversation be insisted upon, as indispensible conditions of their continuing in their service; and if the principals take care to support their injunctions by their own example, it would be seen, that if their service did not find them good, it would make them so, iv. 356. [310].</P>
<P>And why should not this be thought a practicable scheme, when it is considered, that servants, when taken, are generally at years of discretion; and have the strong tie of interest, superadded to the duty we require of them, to influence them; and which they must needs know (let them have contracted habits ever so evil) are as right for them to discharge, as for us to exact from them? iv. 356, 357.

<P>The emulation so useful in a School Education to lead children on in their studies, and duties, would be obtained in an home one, if the child of some honest neighbour, of middling or low circumstances, of like years, and of an ingenuous and modest disposition, were taken into the family, and put under the care of the same tutor, and on a foot as to encouragement, as each excelled, iv. 367.

<HEAD>Female EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Education of a young lady of strong passions, it will be best to endeavour, till she can be taught to love virtue for its own sake, to conduct her spirit to pro∣per ends, rather than totally to subdue it, iv. 303. [263].</P>
<P>There may be a decent pride in humility, iv. 303. [264].</P>
<P>A young lady may behave with so much true dignity, as shall command respect by the turn of her eye, sooner than by assuming speech, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A young lady should be told, that it is no honour to be better born than servants, if she be not better behaved too, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>And that humility is a grace that shines in a high con∣dition; but cannot, equally in a low one; because a per∣son in the latter is already, perhaps, too much humbled, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Women in their education, <HI>Pamela says,</HI> are generally forced to struggle for knowlege like the poor feeble in∣fant who is pinioned, legs, arms, and head, on the nurse's lap, iv. 347. [302].</P>
<P>If its little arms happen, by great chance, to gain free∣dom, and expand, they are instantly seized, and fastened down to passive behaviour by the tyrannic nurse, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>So when a poor girl, in spite of her narrow education, breaks into notice, her genius is immediately tamed by trifling employments, and she is kept back, as if it were apprehended she would become the envy of her own sex, and raise the jealousy of the other, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<HEAD>High <HI>Life, a Picture of it, from Infancy to Maturity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>B's reasons given to his Pamela, why people of birth, and born to high fortune, are often more un∣happy in marriage, than those in middle life.</HI></P>
<P>We are generally educated wrong, <HI>says he.</HI> We are usually headstrong in our wills, and being unaccustomed to controul from our CRADLES, know not how to bear it, ii. 345. [314].</P>
<P>Humoured by our NURSES, thro' the fault of our pa∣rents, we practice first upon them, by an insolence that ought then to be restrained, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Next, we are to be indulged and favoured at SCHOOL. Our learning generally succeeds with us accordingly; and we reward our masters as we did our nurses, with greater instances of our insolence than observance, ii. 346. [314].</P>
<P>After our wise parents have <HI>bribed</HI> our way thro' the customary forms, we are brought home, very little im∣proved in our learning; and then our PARENTS take their deserved turn, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>After we have, perhaps, half broken their hearts, a WIFE is looked out for the young man. Family and for∣tune are the first motives; affection, if at all to be con∣sulted,
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
the last. And two people thus educated, thus from their infancy indulged (the woman, in her way no less humoured, and even more neglected in her educa∣tion than the man) are brought together; and what can be expected, but that they should most cordially join, when married, to plague each other? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Neither of them having ever been subject to controul, nor hardly to contradiction, the man cannot bear it from one, whose new relation to him, and vow of obedience, he thinks should oblige her to yield up her will entirely to his, ii. 347. [315].</P>
<P>The lady, well-read in nothing, perhaps, but romances, thinks it very ungallant, now, for the first time to be controuled, and that by the man from whom she ex∣pected nothing but tenderness, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>So great the difference between what they both ex∣pect <HI>from,</HI> and find <HI>in,</HI> each other, no wonder that mis∣understandings happen; that these ripen into quarrels; that acts of unkindness pass, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Appeals to parents and guardians often ensue. If by mediation of friends a reconciliation takes place, it hard∣ly ever holds; for why? The fault is in the <HI>minds</HI> of both, and neither of them thinks so;</P>
<P>Whence the wound, not permitted to be probed, is but skinned over; and, at last breaks out with more violence than before;</P>
<P>Separate beds are often the consequence: Perhaps elopements; guilty ones sometimes: If not an uncon∣querable indifference; possibly, aversion, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>Some Libertines make a merit of not attempting a married woman: This shews, that their passions are, so far as they adhere to this principle, in their own power; and it encreases the crime of those, who robbing a single woman of her honour, deprive her of that protection by marriage, which even such Rakes as themselves pretend to hold inviolable, iii. 287.

<P>WE are apt to expect more regard from relations, they more indulgence from us, than strangers can have reason for, iii. 25. [20].</P>
<P>If you bear with their faults, there will be no end of impositions; if you dismiss them, you will have their ill-will; they will impute to pride and unnaturalness, your very justice. Your prosperous lot will raise you enemies, who will believe them rather than you, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The world, moreover, will be apt to think, you are crouding upon our benefactor a numerous family of low and indigent people, tho' they should be ever so deserv∣ing, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>One would not therefore, for <HI>their</HI> sakes, accept of their services; especially as they may serve others with equal benefit to themselves, iii. 25. [21].</P>
<P>For I would not that any of them should be lifted out of his station, and made independent at Mr. B's expence, if their own industry would not make them so; tho' I would never scruple, reasonably, to reward their industry in the way of their callings, iii. 26. [21].</P>
<P>If you receive some of them, will not others expect to be equally favoured? And may not this sow the seeds of envy among <HI>them,</HI> and occasion ill will to <HI>you? ibid.</HI></P>

As for myself, believe me, I could sit down and re∣joice with the meanest and remotest relation I have: But to the world's eye, I must, if I have ever so much reluctance to appear superior in theirs, endeavour to be∣have so properly as not to give additional discredit to his choice, iii. 26.

<P>There are undoubtedly more happy persons in low than in high life; one would not, therefore, encourage in any of our relations, such a proud spirit, as should make them want to raise themselves by favour, rather than merit, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>A GENTLEWOMAN born, set at the head of the houshold-affairs of people of condition, will, if she is discreet, command the respect of the domestics of both sexes, i. 12. [10].</P>
<P><HI>Pamela, in view of her exaltation, resolves,</HI></P>
<P>That she will endeavour not to go too low in her gra∣titude to her master: Nor, to carry herself too high to the servants:</P>
<P>But yet will not seek to gain the good-will of the latter by meanness or debasement:</P>
<P>That she will aim at an uniform and regular conduct.</P>
<P>Willing, however, to conceal involuntary errors, as she would be to have her own forgiven;</P>
<P>And not to be too industrious to discover real ones, that might be of no bad consequence, and unlikely to be repeated;</P>
<P>Yet not to conceal such as might encourage bad hearts, or unclean hands, in cases where damage might ensue to
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
their principal; or where the morals of the transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt:</P>
<P>In short, <HI>says she,</HI> I will endeavour, as much as I can, that good servants, in me, shall find a kind encourager; indifferent ones be made better, by inspiring them with a laudable emulation; and bad ones, if not absolutely irreclaimable, reformed by kindness, expostulation; and, if those are ineffectual, by menaces; but most, by a good example;</P>
<P>All this, adds she, if God pleases, ii. 153. [157].</P>

<P>PERSONS travelling into countries where the religion established is different from their own, should be careful, on the one hand, not to give offence to the people they are among; on the other, not to make compliances hurt∣ful to conscience, and disgraceful to their own religion, iv. 412. [360].</P>
<P>The French politeness, and the English frankness of
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
heart, may make a mixture not disagreeable in the be∣haviour of travelled people, iv. 418. [365].</P>
<P>The honours paid abroad to English travellers, more than to those of any other nation, should be an incite∣ment to them, as well for their own credit, as for that of their country, to behave worthy of the distinction, iv. 420. [367].</P>
<P><HI>The subject of</HI> Travelling, <HI>or making the</HI> grand tour, <HI>entered upon in the following particulars.</HI></P>
<P>The age of young gentlemen, from sixteen to twenty-one, an improper one to set out upon their travels; and why, iv. 430. [376].</P>
<P>Mr. Locke thinks from seven to fourteen, a much more eligible one, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If the reasons he gives for this age determine not, he proposes, that the young man's Travelling be suspend∣ed, till that more sedate time of life, when he may travel without a tutor, and be able to make his own observa∣tions; and is thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fashions, the natural and moral advantages and defects, of his own country, iv. 431. [376, 377].</P>
<P>Pamela descants on the advantages a youth may reap by home travelling, before he enters upon a foreign tour; proposing the age of fourteen or fifteen for be∣ginning it, by excursions in the summer months, be∣tween his other studies, and as a diversion to him, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>She is of opinion, that these excursions might be made to most advantage in company of his father, as well as tutor, and gives her reason for it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If his father cannot accompany the youth, she pro∣poses what may be of the next greatest advantage in this scheme of home-travelling, to both son and tutor, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>That the young man visit the sea-coasts, as well as inland parts of Great Britain and Ireland, and the other principal circumjacent islands, iv. 432, 433. [378].</P>
<P>That he look into the art of navigation; the curious structure of a ship, as he is a native of the greatest ma∣ritime kingdom in the world: From which knowlege, tho' but in theory, he will be taught to love and value the British sailors, an useful and brave set of men, who
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
are the natural defence and safeguard of the realm, iv. 433. [378].</P>
<P>With the advantages which he will obtain by this knowlege of his own country, he will be qualified to go abroad, and be better able to judge of the different customs, manners, and forms of government of foreign countries, iv. 433. [379].</P>
<P>All his enquiries will be pertinent and manly: All occasions of that ignorant wonder, which exposes to ri∣dicule the raw young men sent abroad, would be taken away. He would make the best acquaintance, having something to inform them of in relation to his own coun∣try, in return for the information they give him of theirs.

<P>MR. <HI>B. acquaints his Pamela with what his expecta∣tions of his wife's behaviour to him, would have been, had she been a princess; as follows:</HI></P>
<P>I must have been morally sure, <HI>says he,</HI> that she pre∣ferred me to all other men. She must have borne with my imperfections. She must have studied my temper: And if ever she had any points to carry, any desire of overcoming, it must have been by sweetness and com∣plaisance:</P>
<P>And yet, <HI>says he,</HI> not such a slavish one, as should make her condescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility, than of her judgment and affection:</P>
<P>I should have thought I ought not to have desired any thing of her, that was not reasonable to be complied with; and that then she should have shewn no reluctance, uneasiness, or doubt, to oblige me, even at half a word;</P>
<P>Yet if I were not always in the right, I should expect that she should bear with me, if she saw me determined; and that she should expostulate with me on the right side of compliance;</P>
<P>This would have shewn me, that she differed from me, not for contradiction sake; but desired to convince me for my own; and that I should another time take fitter resolutions.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="90"/>
In all companies she must have shewn, that she had an high opinion of, and regard for me, whether altogether deserved, or not.</P>
<P>And this the rather, as such a regard would be not only a reputation, but a security to herself; since, if libertines ever attempt a married woman, their first in∣citement, next to their own vanity, arises from her known indifference to, or contempt of, her husband.</P>
<P>I should have expected, therefore, that she would draw a kind veil over my faults: That such as she could not hide, she would endeavour to extenuate; and shew to every one, that I had <HI>her</HI> good opinion, whatever liberties the world took with my character.</P>
<P>She must have valued my friends for my sake; been chearful and easy, whomsoever I brought home with me; and whatever faults she had observed in me, have never blamed me before company; much less, with such an air, as should have shewn, that she had a better opi∣nion of her own judgment than of mine.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>proceeds he,</HI> my own imperfections: They are many and great; yet I will not allow that they should excuse those of my Wife; or give her room to imagine I will bear faults in her, which she <HI>can</HI> rectify, because she sees greater in me.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I expect, <HI>adds he to his Pamela,</HI> that you will bear with me, till, and only till, you find me capable of returning insult for condescension; and till you think I shall be so mean, as to be the gentler for negligent or pertinacious treatment.</P>
<P>And then (your behaviour such) I should scorn my∣self, if there were one privilege of a Wife, that a princess, were she my Wife, might expect to be indulg∣ed in, that I would not allow to you, ii. 349, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> [316, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI>]</P>

The more obstinate a Child is in her opposition to a Parent's will, the more will a Parent be apt to think his authority concerned to carry his point, ii. 182. [267].</P>
<P>Harsh and cruel treatment humbles a Child, and makes her seem <HI>cheap</HI> in her own eyes, ii. 190. [277].</P>

<P>The Father and Mother who would secure to them∣selves the undivided love of their Children, should avoid such durable contentions with each other, as would distress their Children which side to take, when they would be glad to reverence both, iii. 46. [189].</P>
<P>A good Parent must have greater pain in the <HI>necessary</HI> restraint of a headstrong Daughter, than she can give to such a Daughter, iii. 56. [198]</P>
<P>At every age on this side matrimony it will be found, that a Parent's wings are the most effectual safeguards of Daughters, from the villainous birds of prey that hover round them, iii. 56. [198, 199].</P>
<P>A Parent, for a failure in her own duty, is <HI>not</HI> an∣swerable to her Child, iii. 57. [199].</P>

<P>It is as necessary to direct Daughters in the choice of their female companions, and to watch against the in∣trigues of women-servants, as it is to guard them against the designs of men, <HI>Lovel.</HI> v. 11, 12. [257, 258].</P>
<P>Parents the most indulgent in their own natures, often, from the errors of a Child, incur the censure of hard∣heartedness, v. 221. [vi. 128].</P>
<P>Doubly faulty is that Child, therefore, who, by a rash action, not only disgraces herself, but depreciates the most revered characters, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>What confusion of mind must attend the reflexions of a Child, who, from the most promising outsetting, has brought ruin on herself, and distress on her Friends! <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>The resentment which Children, and even the world, may ascribe to cruelty in an offended Parent, may be owing to excess of love, and disappointed hopes, vi. 26. [348].</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, <HI>says Miss Howe,</HI> that unforgiving Parents were always good, dutiful, and passive Children to <HI>their</HI> Parents, vi. 75. [407].</P>
<P>Parents who would cure a Child's impatience of spi∣rit, should not betray a want of temper in themselves, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Children, depending on the weakness of their Parents tempers, too ofen harden their own hearts, vi. 119. [vii. 33].</P>
<P>While Parents <HI>think</HI> a Child in fault, as they have a

<P>Good Children make <HI>both</HI> their Parents happy in <HI>each other,</HI> as well as in <HI>them;</HI> bad Children unhappy in both, vi. 126. [vii. 43, 44].</P>
<P>When the nearest Friends give up an unhappy Child, every one is ready to propagate slander against her, vi. 188. [vii. 107].</P>
<P>A good Child will be careful of making a party against even harsh and severe Parents, vi. 287. [vii. 212].</P>
<P>It requires a high degree of understanding and discre∣tion in a Daughter, when grown up, to let it be seen that she mingles reverence with her love to a Parent, who has talents visibly inferior to her own, vii. 245. [viii. 169].</P>
<P>Parents, in order to preserve their Children's venera∣tion for them, should take great care not to let them see any thing in their own conduct, behaviour, or principles, which they themselves would not approve of in others, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Such Parents as have a visible narrowness of heart, must needs weaken their own authority with Children of spirit, vii. 246. [viii. 170].</P>

<P>The <HI>smallest</HI> concession made by a woman, resenting an Outrage actually made upon her honour, is as much to the purpose of the Violator as the <HI>greatest,</HI> v. 173. [vi. 77].</P>

<P>FOR women to <HI>do</HI> and to <HI>love</HI> what they should not, is, <HI>according to old Ant. Harlowe,</HI> meat, drink, and ves∣ture to them, i. 211. [219].</P>
<P>The uselessness and expensiveness of modern women multiply Bachelors, i. 212. [220].</P>
<P>There is a tragedy-pride in the hearts of young wo∣men, that will make them risque every-thing to excite pity, <HI>James Harlowe,</HI> i. 253. [263].</P>
<P>Young creatures are often fond of a lover-like dis∣tress, <HI>Ja. Harl. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Women-cowards love men of spirit, and delight in subjects of false heroism, <HI>Miss Howe,</HI> i. 318. [ii. 9].</P>
<P>Women, <HI>according to Miss Howe</HI> [<HI>some only she must mean</HI>] are mere babies in matrimony; perverse fools, when too much indulged and humour'd; creeping slaves, when treated with harshness, i. 325. [ii. 16].</P>
<P>Women love to trade in surprises, i. 328. [ii. 20].</P>
<P>The man who can be sure of his wife's complaisance, tho' he has not her love, will be more happy than nine parts in ten of his married acquaintance, <HI>says Solmes,</HI> i. 371. [ii. 62].</P>
<P>If love and fear must be separated in matrimony, the man who makes himself feared, fares best, <HI>Solmes,</HI> i. 371. <HI>See also</HI> i. 270. [ii. 63. <HI>See also</HI> i. 280].</P>
<P>Women always prefer blustering men: They only
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>
wish to direct the bluster, and make it roar when and at whom they please, <HI>Miss Howe,</HI> ii. 37. [129].</P>
<P>Women, when they favour, will make the slightest, and even but a <HI>fansy'd</HI> merit, excuse the most glaring vice, ii. 51. [142].</P>
<P>Women who have the rougher manners of men, may be said to have the souls of men in the bodies of wo∣men, ii. 114. [201, 202].</P>
<P>Women love to engage in knight-errantry themselves, as well as to encourage it in men, ii. 155. [242].</P>
<P>A Rake, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> has no reason to be a hypo∣crite, when he has found his views better answered by his being known to be a Rake, ii. 318. iii. 185. [iii. 56. 320].</P>
<P>How greedily do the Sex swallow praise! <HI>Lovel.</HI> ii. 353. [iii. 61].</P>
<P>Lovelace calls upon the Female Sex to account for the preference given by many <HI>modest</HI> women, as they are accounted, to a <HI>Rake,</HI> when the most <HI>impudent</HI> of Rakes, <HI>says he,</HI> love <HI>modesty</HI> in a <HI>woman,</HI> ii. 372. [iii. 106].</P>
<P>It concerns every woman, <HI>instructively says Lovelace,</HI> to prove by her actions, that this preference is not owing to a <HI>likeness</HI> in <HI>nature, ibid.</HI></P>
<P>There is, <HI>Lovelace says,</HI> such a perverseness in the Sex, that when they ask your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they may oppose it, ii. 387. iii. 23. [iii. 120. 167].</P>
<P>Women, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> love to be called cruel, even when they are kindest, iii. 24. [168].</P>
<P>The best of the Sex, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> wish to have the credit of reforming a Rake; and so draw themselves in with a very little of our help, iii. 185. [320].</P>
<P>Rakes and Libertines are the men, <HI>Miss Howe says,</HI> that women do not naturally dislike, iii. 329 [iv. 113].</P>
<P>Opposition and contradiction give vigour to female spirit of a warm and romantic turn, iii. 399. [iv. 183].</P>
<P>Women love Rakes, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> because Rakes know how to direct their uncertain wills, and to manage them, iv. 57. [249].</P>
<P>Nothing on earth is so perverse as a woman, when
<PB N="191" REF="199"/>
she is set upon carrying a point, and has a meek man, or one who loves his peace, to deal with, <HI>Lovel.</HI> iv. 137. [335].</P>
<P>Had I found that a character for virtue had been ge∣nerally necessary to recommend me to the Sex, I would, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> have had a greater regard to my morals than I have had, iv. 162. [361].</P>
<P>When you would have a woman report a piece of intelligence, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> you must enjoin her to keep it as a secret, iv. 248. [v. 80].</P>
<P>Women love to have their Sex, and their favours, ap∣pear of importance to men, <HI>Lovel.</HI> iv. 275. [v. 109].</P>
<P>Most of the fair Romancers have, in their early wo∣manhood, chosen Love names, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> iv. 276. [v. 110].</P>
<P>Many a sweet dear, <HI>adds he,</HI> has answered me a Let∣ter, for the sake of owning a name which her god∣mother never gave her, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>An innocent woman, <HI>Lovelace says,</HI> who has been little in the world, knows not what strange stories every wo∣man living, who has had the least independence of will, could tell her, iv. 283. [v. 117].</P>
<P>The whole Sex love plotting, and plotters too, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> iv. 285. [v. 120].</P>
<P>Women like not novices, <HI>Lovel.</HI> iv. 302. [v. 137].</P>
<P>They are pleased with a love of the Sex that is found∣ed in the <HI>knowlege</HI> of it—Reason good—<HI>He proceeds to give the reasons in the same style, very little to the credit of the Sex,</HI> iv. 302, 303. [v. 137, 138].</P>
<P>Women are the greatest triflers in the creation, <HI>rudely says Lovelace,</HI> yet fansy themselves the most important beings in it! iv. 331. [v. 168].</P>
<P>These tender doves, <HI>says Lovelace, speaking of young Ladies,</HI> know not, till put to it, what they can bear, especially when engag'd in love affairs, iv. 333. [v. 170]</P>
<P>The Sex love busy scenes, <HI>Lovel. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A woman will create a storm, rather than be without one, <HI>Lovel. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Most unhappy is the woman, who is obliged to live in tumults, which she neither raised, nor can controul, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="200"/>
Women are used to cry without grief, and to laugh without reason, <HI>Lovel.</HI> iv. 339. [v. 176].</P>

<P>All women are born to intrigue, and practise it more or less, <HI>Lovel.</HI> iv. 404. [v. 244].</P>
<P>In love affairs women are naturally expert, and much more quick-witted than men, <HI>Lovel. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Friendship in women, when a man comes in between the pair of friends, is given up, like their music, and other maidenly amusements, <HI>Lovel.</HI> v. 8. [254].</P>
<P>The mother who would wish her daughter to have one man, would sometimes better succeed, if she proposed another, <HI>Lovel.</HI> v. 9. [254, 255].</P>
<P>It is a common fault of the Sex, <HI>according to Lovelace,</HI> to aim at being young too long, v. 32. [279].</P>
<P>Secrets of love, and secrets of intrigue, <HI>Lovelace says,</HI> are the strongest cements of womens friendships, v. 69. [318].</P>
<P>All women, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> are cowards at heart: They are only violent where they may, v. 178. [vi. 83].</P>
<P>Women, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> love those best (whether men, women, or children) who give them most pain, v. 363. [vi. 281].</P>
<P>Girls who are never out of temper but <HI>with</HI> reason, when that is given them, hardly ever pardon, or af∣ford another opportunity of offending, <HI>Lovel.</HI> v. 392. [vi. 311].</P>
<P>Vestals, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> have been often warmed by their own fires, vi. 9. [337].</P>
<P>Revenge and obstinacy will make the best of women do very unaccountable things, <HI>Lovel.</HI> vi. 11. [339].</P>
<P>Women, rather than not put out both the eyes of a man they are mortally offended with, will put out one of their own, <HI>Lovel. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Vile men owe much of their vileness even to women of character, who hardly ever scruple to accompany and converse with them, tho' they have been guilty of ever so much baseness to others, vi. 82. [414, 415].</P>
<P>Women being generally modest and bashful them∣selves,
<PB N="193" REF="201"/>
are too apt to consider that quality in the men, which is their own principal grace, as a defect; and <HI>finely</HI> do they judge, when they think of supplying that defect by chusing a man that cannot be ashamed, vi. 83. [415].</P>
<P>Ladies, <HI>Lovelace hints,</HI> often give denials, only to be persuaded to comply, in order to reconcile themselves to themselves, vi. 97. [vii. 10].</P>
<P>No woman is homely in her own opinion, vi. 219. [vii. 140].</P>

<HEAD>Reformation. Conviction. Conversion.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN can hardly be expected to reform, who re∣solves not to quit the evil company he has been accustom∣ed to delight in, i. 226. [234].</P>
<P>Pretences to instantaneous Convictions are to be suspect∣ed, i. 236. [245].</P>
<P>Conviction is half way to amendment, i. 260. [270].</P>
<P>To reform by an enemy's malevolence, is the noblest revenge in the world, i. 265. [275].</P>
<P>Very few Convictions arise from vehement debatings, i. 384. [ii. 75].</P>
<P>The first step to Reformation is to subdue sudden gusts of passion, and to be patient under disappointment, ii. 27. [120].</P>
<P>The most abandon'd of Libertines generally mean one day to reform, ii. 378. [iii. 111, 112]. <HI>Should they not therefore, even as Libertines, resolve against atrocious guilt, were it but to make their future compunction less pungent?</HI>]</P>
<P>Reformation cannot be a sudden work, ii. 378. 391. [iii. 112. 124].</P>
<P>There is more hope of the Reformation of a man of sense, than of a fool, ii. 393. <HI>See also</HI> i. 262. [iii. 126. <HI>See also</HI> i. 272].</P>
<P><HI>But this is a delusive hope, and has been the cause of great mischief; for who thinks not the man she loves a man of sense? The observations that follow are nearer the truth, and deserve to be well considered.</HI></P>
<P>A man who errs with his eyes open, and against Con∣viction, is the worse for what he knows, iii. 6. [151].</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="202"/>
The man of parts and abilities, who engages in a baseness, knowing it to be so, is less likely to be re∣claimed, than one who errs from want of knowlege, or due Conviction, v. 218. [vi. 125].</P>
<P>Women think, that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits, <HI>as Lovelace himself observes,</HI> is a much easier task than in the nature of things it can be, v. 299. [vi. 211].</P>
<P><HI>For Mr. Belford's scheme of Reformation see Vol.</HI> vii. 215 <HI>to</HI> 218. [viii. <HI>p.</HI> 138-141].</P>
<P>Little hope can there be of reclaiming a man, who is vile from premeditation, vi. 46. [376].</P>
<P>To what a bad choice is many a worthy woman be∣tray'd, by that false and inconsiderate notion, raised and propagated no doubt by the author of all delusion, <HI>That a reformed Rake makes the best Husband!</HI> Belf. vii. 141. [viii. 61].</P>
<P>Little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners, what a change of fixed habits, nay, what a conquest of a bad nature, and what a portion of divine grace, is required to make a profligate man a good husband, a worthy father, and a true friend, from PRINCIPLE, vii. 142. [viii. 62].</P>
<P>It is a high degree of presumption for a woman to suppose her own virtue so secure, as that she may marry a profligate in hopes to reclaim him, vii. 202. [viii. 125].</P>
<P>The sincerity of that man's Reformation is hardly to be doubted, who can patiently bear being reminded of his past follies, and when he can occasionally express an abhorrence of them, vii. 251. [viii. 175].</P>

<P><PB N="195" REF="203"/>
There are men who think themselves too <HI>wise</HI> to be religious, ii. 108. [196].</P>
<P>There is something beautifully solemn in Devotion, <HI>says even Lovelace,</HI> iii. 189. [324].</P>
<P>The Sabbath, <HI>says he,</HI> is a most excellent institution to keep the heart right, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>It is a fine sight, <HI>adds he,</HI> to see multitudes of well∣appearing people all joining in one reverent act! an ex∣ercise how worthy of a rational being! <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If, as religion teaches us, we shall be judged, in a great measure, by our benevolent or evil actions to one another, what must be the condemnation of those who have wilfully perpetrated acts of the most atrocious vio∣lence upon their innocent fellow-creatures? iv. 58. [v. 306].</P>
<P>Libertines are generally for making a Religion to their practices; <HI>a wickedness which nevertheless Lovelace disclaims,</HI> v. 310. [vi. 223].</P>
<P>Religion will teach us to bear inevitable evils with patience, v. 390. [vi. 309].</P>
<P>Altho' I wish not for life, <HI>says Clarissa,</HI> yet would I not, like a poor coward, desert my <HI>post,</HI> when I can maintain it, and when it is my duty to maintain it, vi. 48. [377, 378].</P>
<P>I will do every thing I can, <HI>continues she,</HI> to preserve my life, till God, in mercy to me, shall be pleased to call for it, vi. 48. [378].</P>
<P>Religious considerations, timely enforced, will prevent the heart from being seized with violent and fatal grief, vi. 49. [379].</P>
<P>Disappointments may bring on an indifference to this life; but a truly pious resignation to death requires a better and deeper root, vi. 55. [385].</P>
<P>Enthusiasts often depreciate the Scriptures they mean to extol, by abused and indiscriminate applications, vi. 95. [vii. 7].</P>
<P>Even a Lovelace disclaims, as ill manners, jesting upon religion, or religious men, vi. 97. [vii. 10].</P>
<P>A person of innate piety cannot think of shortening her own life (whatever her calamities may be) even by <HI>neglect,</HI> much less by <HI>violence,</HI> vi. 102. [vii. 14].</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="204"/>
Our best prayer in affliction in doubtful or critical situations, is, That God's will may be done, and that we may be resigned to it, vi. 116. [vii. 30].</P>
<P>Religion is the only refuge of a heart labouring un∣der heavy and unmerited calamities, vi. 175. [vii. 93].</P>
<P>Religion enjoins us not only to forgive injuries, but to return good for evil; and Clarissa blesses God for enabling her to obey its dictates, vi. 180. [vii. 98].</P>
<P>Persons of Piety cannot permit resentment, passion, or anger, to appear, or have place, in the last disposition of their secular affairs, vi. 403. [vii. 335].</P>
<P>God will have no rivals in the hearts which he sancti∣fies, vii. 31. [371].</P>
<P>Persons of Education and Piety will distinguish them∣selves as such, even in their anger, vii. 101. [viii. 19].</P>
<P>It is a great mistake to imagine, that Piety is not en∣tirely consistent with good nature and good manners, vii. 263. [viii. 188].</P>
<P>Religion, if it has taken proper hold of the heart, is, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> the most chearful countenance-maker in the world, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Repentance. Contrition.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is it that men propose, who put off Repent∣ance and Amendment, but to live to <HI>sense,</HI> as long as sense can relish, and to reform when they can sin no longer? iii. 107. [246].</P>
<P>That Contrition for a guilt, under which the guilty, till detected, was easy, is generally to be ascribed to the detection, and not to a due sense of the heinousness of the guilt, v. 155. [vi. 58].</P>
<P>Repentance, I have a notion, <HI>says Lovelace,</HI> should be set about while a man is is good health and spirits, v. 396. [vi. 315].</P>

<P>MEN, were women to give them importance with them, would be generally greater infringers of their natural liberty, than the most severe parents, i. 13. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>New faces are more sought after at public places, than fine faces constantly seen, i. 17. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Women should not in conversation make an ostentation of knowlege: But frankness and complaisance require, that when called upon, they should deliver their senti∣ments with freedom, i. 19. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>Women have more to lose with regard to reputation, than men, i. 26. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The Hyaena is both male and female. The male is the more dangerous, since he will come into the houses of women, fawn, cringe, lick their hands; while the den of the female is by the highway-side, and wretched youths must enter into it of their own accord, to put it into her power to devour them, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The chief strength of men lies in the weakness of women, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Women should not add to the triumph of those who make their weakness the general subject of their satire, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>Whose leavings are they, that a virtuous woman takes, who marries a profligate? i. 27. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The only merit a rake can have with a worthy wo∣man, is, that he holds out a warning to her against men of so bad a nature, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A woman who, with her eyes open, marries a profli∣gate man, generally, as to herself, defeats the good end of society, i. 28. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>When Girls begin to look out for admirers, their friends had better be aforehand with them, if possible, than to leave them to purvey for themselves, iv. 56. [228].</P>
<P>To give a Girl consequence with herself, and to seem to repose a confidence in her discretion, is often a pro∣per way to make her act discretely, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Or if she does doubt of her own perfections being so high as he seems to think them, she questions not his sincerity, and she has heard a thousand instances of the mighty power of love, transforming plainness into beauty, in the eye of a lover.</HI></P>
<P>If her parents are <HI>a</HI>-verse, the Girl is <HI>per</HI>-verse; and the more, the less discretion there is in her passion, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>She adopts the word <HI>constancy:</HI> She declaims against <HI>persecution:</HI> She calls her idle flame love, which only was a something she knew not what to make of, a cu∣pidity, that, like a wandering bee, had it not settled on this flower, would on the next, whether bitter or sweet, v. 185.

<P>Love, <HI>adds this lively lady,</HI> is a word very happily at hand, to help giddy creatures to talk with, and look without confusion of face on, a man, who, for the sake, perhaps, of her fortune only, tells her a thousand false∣hoods, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>THE man of the town, and the pedant, are two ex∣treme points in comparison with each other, i. 58. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Vast is the field of Science. The more a man knows, the more he will find he has to know, i. 60. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

Good-nature, a general philanthropy, but not a love of persons for their faults, mark the true satirist, i. 61. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The world is one great University, i. 62. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The knowlege that is to be obtained in the lesser Uni∣versity, should not make a man despise what is to be ac∣quired in the greater, in which, that knowlege was prin∣cipally intended to make him useful, i. 62. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Smatterers in Learning are the most opinionated, i. 64. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Learning consists not in the knowlege of Languages, i. 66. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The first great genius had not human example, and human precepts, to improve by, i. 66. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Language is but a vehicle to Science; it is not Science itself, i. 67. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Great respect should, however, be paid to Linguists; but ought that confusion of tongues, which was intend∣ed to punish presumption, to be thought our greatest glory now? i. 71. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>It were to be wished, that in all Nurseries of Learn∣ing, the manners of youth were proposed as the principal end, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Morals and good breeding are too generally obliged to give way to that Learning, which is of little moment, but as it inculcates and promotes those, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen says,</HI> that many of the young men at the Universities, in the present age, are in more danger of becoming fine gentlemen, than fine scholars, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>As it is said of the advantages of birth and degree, so may it be said of Learning, <HI>says Mr. Walden,</HI> no one that has pretensions to it, despises it, i. 72. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Too great a portion of life is bestowed in the learn∣ing of Languages, i. 72. 76. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>The <HI>reputation</HI> of Learning is often acquired by writers who treat on subjects that only serve to amuse inquisitive minds, and in themselves are of very little use to the greater purposes of life and knowlege, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>People who least know how to argue, are generally the most contentious, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Homer, Virgil, Milton, were learned men, yet wrote their immortal works in their respective native Lan∣guages, i. 73. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Milton's frequent recourses to the pagan mythology, in a work, that so greatly adorns a much nobler, the christian, thought by some to be a condescension to the taste of persons of his time, who had more reading than genius, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Much noble knowlege is to be had in the English and French Languages, <HI>(Bishop Burnet)</HI> i. 76. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Geography, history, the knowlege of nature, and the more practical parts of the mathematics, may make a person very knowing, without a word of Latin <HI>(Bishop Burnet) ibid.</HI></P>
<P>There is a fineness of thought, and a nobleness of ex∣pression in the Latin authors, that will make them the entertainment of a man's whole life, if he once under∣stands them, and reads them with delight: But if this cannot be attained, I would not <HI>(says the same Prelate)</HI> have it reckoned, that the education of an ill Latin scho∣lar is to be given up, i. 77. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>The Language of nature is one Language throughout the world, tho' there are different modes of speech to ex∣press it by, i. 260. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Every learned man is not a man of sense, i. 302. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>A man may be illiterate, yet not ignorant, ii. 209. [310].</P>
<P>The soliloquies and asides in a play, are generally unnatural expedients of authors to make their per∣formances intelligible to an audience, ii. 396. [iii. 140].</P>

<P>A LEARNED Woman, with her own sex, is as an owl among the lesser birds, i. 63. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Men generally are afraid of a wife who has more understanding than themselves, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Is it a necessary consequence, that that knowlege which shall make a man shine, must make a woman vain and pragmatical? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>May not a lettered wife, and a learned husband be flint and steel to each other? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Many men, like the Turks, think that empire safest, which is founded in ignorance, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>In what a situation are women, who, if they have ge∣nius, will be thought guilty of affectation, whether they appear desirous to conceal it, or submit to have it called forth, i. 66. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Women should not be ashamed either of their talents or acquirements, i. 77. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>They should only take care, not to give up their do∣mestic usefulness for Learning, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>They will then, by reason of their acquirements, be more suitable companions for men of sense and learn∣ing, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The man must have a narrow mind who is apprehen∣sive of his prerogative from a Learned Woman, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A woman who does not behave the better the more she knows, would make her husband uneasy, and think as well of herself, were she totally illiterate, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Do not men court for wives whom they please? A conceited, a vain mind in a woman, cannot be hidden, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

Young women who are writers, should not suffer their pen to run away with their needle, i. 140. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Nor their love of reading to interfere with that house∣wifery which is an indispensible in the character of a good woman, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' Learning should not be the principal distinction of a woman, yet, where talents are given, they should not be either uncultivated or unacknowleged, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>When no duty is neglected for the acquirement; when modesty, elegance, and a teachable spirit are preserved, it is not a disgrace to a woman to be supposed to know something, i. 141. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Why should women, in compliance with the petulance of narrow-minded men, forbear to use a word which indicates knowlege, when no other single word will so well express their sense? i. 245. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P><HI>Yet the confining themselves to the usually-known and familiar words in language, will always give them a simplicity and ease, that will make them shine in the true grace of expression above men, especially above the generality of scholastic men.</HI></P>
<P>A young woman will rather choose to distinguish her∣self by her discretion and prudence, than by her wit and poetry, ii. 206. [307].</P>
<P>Yet the easy productions of a fine fancy, not made the business of life or its boast, confer no denomination that is disgraceful; but very much the contrary, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>The man must have a very hard heart, as well as be a most abandoned man, who can pass from woman to woman, without remorse for a former, whom he has by solemn vows seduced, i. 27. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Of what a dreadful abuse of passions, given for the noblest purposes, are profligate men guilty! <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Libertines have all one dialect. They say nothing new, or deserving attention, i. 143. 320. [i. 143. ii. 5].</P>
<P>Libertines delight to sport with the healths and hap∣piness of credulous young creatures, whom they pretend to love, i. 223. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>A man who has insulted a woman, must have a high opinion of himself, and a low one of her, if he thinks marriage will be an atonement, or do her honour, i. 311. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Rakish men are generally suspicious tyrants: They live in continual fear of retribution, ii. 12. [113].</P>
<P>Men of strong health, and of a riotous turn, should not, in mere compassion, associate with men of weaker constitutions than their own, ii. 40. [141].</P>
<P>Neither should extravagant men, of high and low for∣tunes, associate; since the expences which will but shake the estate of the one, will demolish that of the other, ii. 40, 41. [141, 142].</P>
<P>Rakish men seldom make good husbands, good fa∣thers, good brothers, ii. 74. [175].</P>

<P>The notion that a reformed Rake makes the best husband, is equally vulgar and pernicious, and becomes only the mouth of an inconsiderate woman, ii. 75. [176].</P>
<P>Rakish men frequently endeavour to justify their vices by general reflexions on the sex [which so often prefers them to better men] ii. 83. [184].</P>

<P>A seducing Rake has more souls to answer for than his own, ii. 95. [196].</P>
<P>It is an high degree of confidence in a man of free principles, to think of approaching a woman of piety and prudence with any hope of success, ii. 142. [243].</P>
<P>Rakes often have contentions with themselves, which they own to one another, whether they shall <HI>vouchsafe</HI> to offer themselves in marriage to a lady, before they con∣clude to do her that favour, ii. 142, 143. [243, 244].</P>
<P>Those who pretend to know the sex best, think them∣selves intitled, among one another, to treat it with the least respect, ii. 178. [279].</P>

<P>Trifles are acceptable from those we love, i. 61. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Women ought not to be ashamed of owning a suscep∣tibility of a natural passion, when duty and prudence are their guides, and the object worthy, i. 87. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>Young women often given way to a passion, which they <HI>suppose</HI> unconquerable, because they will not take pains to subdue it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A prudent woman will shut the door of her heart against the blind deity, when she finds he has set his incroaching foot on the threshold, i. 88, 89. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Such a one will endeavour to keep her heart her own, till duty adds force to the lambent flame, i. 89. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P><HI>Making Love,</HI> as it is called, is an <HI>ungenerous</HI> abuse of the ears of a young woman; since a man can address whom he pleases, and a woman must wait his motions; and since we are all ready to believe what we wish, i. 113. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>A man who truly loves, cannot, without pain, allow himself to teaze, by importunity, the object of his pas∣sion, who favours him not, i. 122. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>One of the greatest pains that a grateful heart can know, is to be obliged to deny a worthy man, who ten∣derly loves her, i. 124. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Respectful Love is not the indication either of a weak head, or a faint heart, i. 143. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Violent Love is not likely to be lasting, i. 151. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>It is one of the sweetest pleasures imaginable, to hear a whole circle join in applauding the absent person who stands high in our opinion, i. 410. [ii. 95].</P>

Love is made a cover to baseness of heart, when the pretender to it seeks to gratify his own passion, at the expence of the happiness or duty of the object, ii. 60. [161].</P>
<P>In a pure flame Love and Friendship cannot be se∣parated, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Love is a word, that is often made a cover to the vilest cupidity, ii. 92. [193].</P>
<P>Love [however, dignified by romancers and poets] is a narrower of the heart; since, while its success is in sus∣pence, it is the parent of envy, jealousy, dissimulation, ii. 141. 283. iii. 32. [ii. 242. iii. 27. 192].</P>

<P>Women do not often with <HI>earnestness</HI> reject a man, who is not quite disagreeable, if they are not prejudiced in another's favour, ii. 160. [261].</P>
<P>It is no wonder that a man who is always worthily employ'd, is not in love; since Love is the child of lei∣sure and indolence, ii. 185, 186. iii. 218. [ii. 286, 287. iv. 4].</P>
<P>A woman who means not preferable favour to a man, will allow herself in saying civil and polite things to him, ii. 192. [293].</P>

<P>Love is a selfish deity: He puts two persons upon pre∣ferring their own interest, nay, often a gratification of their passion against their interest, to those of every-body else; and reason, discretion, duty, are frequently given up in a competition with it, ii. 240. [341].</P>

<P>The woman who has been disappointed in Love, will be able to play with another flame without burning her fingers, iii. 4. [163, 164].</P>
<P>A prudent man or woman will never leave MIND out of his or her notion of Love, iii. 12. [171].</P>
<P>Women often take pains to cheat themselves into a belief that they are not in Love; but detect themselves by the very pains they take to obviate such a charge, iii. 14. [173].</P>

<P>The tenderness, and even veneration which a worthy man shews to a deservedly-beloved object, is not a dero∣gation from his character, iii. 52. [212].</P>
<P>Love, like water, will work its way thro' the banks that are set up to confine it, if not watched, and dammed out in time, iii. 93. [253].</P>
<P>The poison of Love once taken in at the eye, will soon diffuse itself thro' the mass, iii. 125. [285].</P>
<P>Seldom, as the women suppose, is there that fervor in a second love, as in a first, iii. 153. [313].</P>
<P>Women, in Love-cases, see into each other's hearts from small openings, iii. 257. [iv. 43].</P>

<P>Love gilds every object that bears a relation to the object beloved, iv. 27. [199].</P>

Not a preference of that object absolutely, as in ex∣cellence superior to every imaginable being, iv. 246. [v. 117].</P>

<P>Disappoinment in Love may operate in different minds different ways, iv. 258. [v. 129].</P>

<P>A man of sense, in Love, will preserve his dignity; yet, for his own sake, will give consequence to the lady whom he one day hopes to call his wife, v. 133. [vi. 111].</P>
<P>Love will plead for its votary in a single breast, when consultation on the supposed fit and unfit (the object ab∣sent) will produce delay, v. 168. [vi. 146].</P>

<P>MEN in years, and labouring under infirmities, are far more excusable for marrying a young woman, than a woman in years is for marrying a young man, ii. 340. [iii. 84].</P>
<P>The difference arises from the tenderness and help∣fulness of women in their attendance on a sick or infirm husband: While male-nurses are unnatural characters, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The man in years, who has no children to repine at a mother-in-law, and to vex him by little jealousies arising from a contrariety of interests and views; who is weakly, and often indisposed; may marry without impeachment of his prudence, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Nor would his relations be worthy of his kindness, who, for selfish views, would wish to continue him in mean hands, rob him of the joys of confidence, and the comfort of tender help from an equal, or one deserving to be made so, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Such a man has only to take care so to marry, as not to defeat his own end; not with a gay woman who will be fluttering about in public, while he is g4oaning in his chamber, and wishing for her presence, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If he be a man of family and fortune; he should not aim at a fortune with her: She should be a gentlewoman by birth and education: Of a serious [but not melan∣choly] temper: Not a girl as to years; yet, if he has no children, <HI>not</HI> past the probability of bringing him an heir [which would add to their mutual good understand∣ing] ii. 341. [iii. 85].</P>
<P>She ought to be one who has been acquainted with affliction. Must consider her Marriage with him, as an act both of condescension in herself, and preferment, ii. 387. [iii. 131].</P>
<P>Her tenderness will, by this means, be engaged, and her dignity supported, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

A woman for her morality's sake, ought not to marry a man in years in hopes of his death, iii. 230. [iv. 16].</P>
<P>If a woman has but the shadow of a doubt, whether she can behave in Marriage with condescension and in∣dulgence to a man of unequal years, she ought not to be tempted, by the most advantageous proposals, to ac∣cept of him, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>MARRIAGE Settlements ought not to be made so large, as to make a wife independent of her husband, and to put it out of his power, with discretion, to engage her gratitude by his generosity, iv. 194. [v. 65].</P>
<P>The hearts of young women are apt, <HI>unjustly,</HI> to rise against the notions of bargain and sale, as some phrase it, in a Matrimonial Treaty, v. 62. [vi. 40].</P>

<P><HI>But should not the flagrant selfishness of such be pe∣netrated; since they can mean nothing but their own interest, at the very time they would have a young woman pay no regard to hers?</HI></P>

<P>A man, whose proposals of Marriage are unexception∣able, should be spared the indelicacy of asking questions as to fortune, v. 71. [vi. 49].</P>
<P>Generosity requires not, of even a generous man, that in a Treaty of Marriage, since the interest of himself and his wife will be one, that he should make a compli∣ment to his affection, by giving up her natural right; especially if there be no one of her family in low circum∣stances, v. 73, 74.

<P>Explicitness in every case becomes the proposer, iii. 230. [iv. 16].</P>
<P>A man of strict honour, proposing an advantageous alliance, will not seek strongly to attach the friends of the young lady in favour of his proposal, till he know her mind, lest he impose a difficulty upon her, that nei∣ther for her own sake, or the man's, ought to be laid, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A declared, and not unreasonable aversion, should not be attempted to be overcome, iii. 231. [iv. 17].</P>
<P>A generous proposer will, in case of a reasonable op∣position to his proposal, be an advocate for the person refusing, rather than the persuader, <HI>ibid</HI></P>
<P>It is an indelicacy hastily to urge a modest woman for an affirmative to a proposal of Marriage, when she has received it without giving a negative, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>If they are not capable of generous shame, and the fault be repeated, he will part with them; but with such kindness, as will cause their fellow-servants to blame them, and take warning:</P>

Women who have had no lovers, or, having had lovers, have not found a husband, have, perhaps, as men go, rather had a miss than a loss, i. 326. [ii. 11].</P>
<P>Those women who join with the men, in their ridicule of Old Maids, ought not to be forgiven, if the single state, and not the bad qualities of the person, is what they mean to expose, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>In the abusive sense of the word, there are Old Maids of twenty, and among widows and wives of all ages and complexions, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A single woman, tho' either disappointed, or not ad∣dressed to, has infinitely less cares, less anxieties to con∣tend with, than a married one, ii. 146. [247].</P>
<P>Bachelors and Maids, when long single, may be com∣pared to houses long empty, which nobody cares to take, ii. 202. [303].</P>
<P>As the house in time, by long disuse, will be thought, by the vulgar, haunted by evil spirits, so will the other, by the many, be thought possessed by no good ones, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Many an Old Maiden lady, <HI>says Lady G.</HI> has substan∣tial notions of ideal love, v. 7. [278].</P>
<P>Those notions, <HI>this lively Lady fancies,</HI> last a long time with those who have not had the opportunity of grati∣fying the silly passion, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Would a woman who ridicules Old Maids, have one think that she is over-joyed that she has put it out of any one's power to reproach <HI>her</HI> on that account? v. 13. [284].</P>
<P>If so, how thankful, on all occasions, ought she to be to the man who has so generously kept her from the odium! <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>It looks like a want of decency in women, to cast re∣flexions on others of their own sex (for what?) probably for their prundence and virtue, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Such reflecters consider not, how much they, by their ludicrous freedoms, exalt the men, and depreciate their own sex, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>It is no wonder that the men join in the ridicule: It is <HI>their</HI> interest to do so; and it augments their conse∣quence, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

Many of the foibles for which Old Maids are ridiculed, they would have been guilty of had they been old wives, v. 13. [284].</P>

<P>Women of sense should be above joining to hunt down a class of people of their own sex, whom they deem unfortunate, v. 13, 14. [284, 285].</P>
<P><HI>Multitudes of the sex owe their ruin to the odium so unmeritedly cast upon Old Maids, by both sexes.</HI></P>
<P>[Whereas this class of females rather merit compassion; since] a single woman is too generally an undefended, unsupported creature, vi. 202. [vii. 202].</P>
<P>Her early connexions, year by year, drop off: No new ones arise, and she remains solitary and unheeded in a busy bustling world, perhaps soured to it by her un∣connected state, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>But yet if no proper match offer to a single woman, must she make an improper one to avoid the ridicule of a mere name? vi. 209. [vii. 209].</P>
<P>An unsupported state is better than an oppressed, a miserable one, vi. 209. [vii. 209].</P>
<P>How many rashly-chosen husbands, and repentant wives, justify the women who having not had an offer they can with prudence accept of, choose to live single? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>May not the woman who makes a rash choice, be said to throw herself out of the protection and defence upon which every one may depend, in the state of life mark∣ed out to her by providence? vi. 218. [vii. 218].</P>
<P>Unsuitable matches cannot be called a support and de∣fence, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The single state may be said to be fitly marked out by providence, to those women who never have it in their power fitly to change it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>IT is lawful to repeat those things spoken in our own Praise, which are necessary to be known, and cannot otherwise be come at, i. 40. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>It will be easily discovered whether persons repeating their own Praises, are elated with them, or not, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The heart hardly deserves Praise, that is not fond of it from the worthy, i. 392. [ii. 77].</P>
<P>We are too apt to give Praise or Dispraise to the actions or sentiments of others, as they square with our own, ii. 224. [325].</P>
<P>It may be concluded, that nothing <HI>extraordinary</HI> can be said of a man whom his friends praise highly for the performance of those common duties, which, if he failed in, he would be justly deemed a bad man, ii. 318. [iii. 62].</P>

<P>A good man, looking upon himself only as the instru∣ment of Providence in the good he dispenses, will, with reluctance, receive the over-flowing thanks and Praises of grateful hearts, iii. 253. [iv. 39].</P>
<P>Modesty may look up, and be elated with the Praises of a good man, iii. 338. [iv. 124].</P>
<P>We are fond of standing high in the opinion of those we love, tho' we may be conscious of not deserving all the Praises they may give us, iv. 169. [v. 40].</P>
<P>We may allowably repeat the Praises given us by grate∣ful and benevolent spirits, when we cannot otherwise so well do justice to the generous warmth of their friend∣ship, iv. 212. [v. 83].</P>
<P>The Praises given to those we really love, are often more grateful to us, than those conferred on ourselves, iv. 251. v. 276. [v. 122. vi. 254].</P>
<P>The reason is, we doubt not perhaps our <HI>own</HI> merit; but may be afraid, that the favoured object will not be considered by others, as we are willing to consider him: But if he is, we take the Praises given him as a com∣pliment to our own judgment, iv. 251, 252. [v. 122, 123].</P>

<P>FORTUNE, in the choice of a wife, should be the least thing stood upon by the man who is in circum∣stances not uneasy: But Prudence will advise, <HI>says Sir Rowland Meredith,</HI> that she should have so much as would serve to shew, that the man was rather captivated by the understanding, than by the eye, i. 26.

<P>Where a woman is possessed of a moderate fortune, it will be an earnest, <HI>says the Knight,</HI> that the family she is of, wants not to lie under obligation to the man who marries her, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A Prudent person will resolve to amend by the faults found in her; and endeavour to confirm herself in the virtues ascribed to her, i. 40, 41. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>A young lady who speaks little, and hears what is said by her elders with attention, may be pronounced discreet, i. 325. [ii. 10].</P>

<P>There is a bright side in every event; a Wise man will not lose sight of it; and there is a dark oue, but he will endeavour only to see it with the eye of Prudence, that he may not be involved by it unawares, iii. 380. [iv. 166].</P>

<P>Modesty, under the name of Prudery, is in danger of becoming ignominious, and of being banished from the behaviour and conversations of all those who frequent public places; iii. 353. [iv. 139].</P>
<P>The word Prudery has two senses. As derived from Prudence, it were to be wished it were restored to its primitive signification, lest virtue should suffer by the abuse of it, as religion once did by that of the word Puritan, v. 170. [vi. 148].</P>

<P>Italians say, they suffer not often their finest voices, and finest composers, to turn strollers, i. 146. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Many persons of low genius among the gentry, have such a taste for foreign diversions, that they think not tolerably of those of their own country, however pre∣ferable, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Masquerades are not creditable places for young la∣dies to be known to be insulted at them, i. 99. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>They are diversions that fall not in with the genius of the English commonalty, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>They are said by those who speak most favourably of them, to be a diversion more silly than wicked, i. 165. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Prudent and good women may, with reason, be allow∣ed to say, that their lot is cast in an age of petit maitres and triflers of men, i. 253. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>Places of Diversion [or dissipation rather, as they should be called] become dreadfully general, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Young women should be indulged [once or twice in a season] at the innocent Public Diversions, that they may not add expectation (which runs very high in young minds, and is seldom answered) to the ideal scenes, ii. 267. [iii. 11].</P>

<P>A wretched effeminacy prevails among the men: Mar∣riage, the bond of civil society, is more and more de∣spised; and even women deemed virtuous, discourage not by their contempt the free-livers, ii. 271. [iii. 15].</P>
<P>Flippant women love to associate with empty men, because such keep their folly in countenance, iii. 353. [iv. 139].</P>
<P>They are afraid of wise men. But wise men should not turn fools to please them, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>They will despise the wise man's folly, more than the weak man's; and with reason, because being uncha∣racteristic, it must sit more awkwardly upon him, than the other's can do, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>How should modern fine gentlemen know any thing of delicacy, when the women they associate with, have forgot it? iv. 72. [244].</P>

<P>Joyful people are not always wise ones, iv. 198. [v. 69].</P>
<P>Women, <HI>Lady G. says,</HI> marry not now so much for love, as for the liberty of gadding abroad with less cen∣sure and less controul, iv. 255. [v. 126].</P>
<P>Yet the number of single women that croud to Rane∣lagh and Vaux-hall markets, to be <HI>cheapened,</HI> will con∣vince us, <HI>she says,</HI> that maids will be as soon above shame and controul, as wives, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>As for <HI>mothers, concludes this free-speaking Lady,</HI> many of them are for escorting their daughters to Public places, in order to take their share of the Racketing, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>It is the interest of gay and designing men, to promote this almost universal dissipation; yet, tho' women would not croud to market were there not men there, they find, that men worth a wish, rather <HI>cheapen</HI> than <HI>purchase</HI> at places of Public resort, v. 126. <HI>See also</HI> vol. v. 245.

<P>Women are not so soon tired of Public diversions, particularly of dancing, as men, vi. 35. [vii. 35].</P>
<P><HI>Their minds are generally more airy, more volatile, and more susceptible of joy and festivity: They should not therefore be too much indulged in them; and the less, as a decent and becoming reserve is an ornament of their sex, and one of the principal bulworks of virtue.</HI></P>

<P>Daughters often, in a beginning address, declare, that they will not marry without their parents consent; but they will frequently suffer their affections to be engaged, without letting them know a syllable of the matter: [and what then is the case, but that the child, who would have deemed a parent a tyrant, had he sought to compel her to break off her engagement, actually hopes to compel him to approve of her ingrateful rashness?] i. 391.

<P>VICE is a degrader even of high spirits, ii. 91. [192].</P>
<P>Wicked men are generally the severest punishers of those Wicked people, who minister not to their own par∣ticular gratifications, ii. 93. [195].</P>
<P>Habitual Wickedness debases, as habitual goodness ex∣alts, the human mind, and gives an actual superiority and inferiority respectively, to persons naturally of equal parts and abilities, ii. 327. [iii. 71].</P>

<P>The passion that can admit of raving on a disappoint∣ment, is temporary, and seldom dangerous, iv. 354. [v. 125].</P>
<P>If the head be safe, pride and supposed slight will in time harden the heart, and resentment, in a woman of spirit, will take place of Love, iv. 255. [v. 126].</P>
<P>The unexperienced virgin is to mistrust her heart, when she begins to meditate with pleasure the good qualities of an object, with whom she has frequent opportunities of conversing, iv. 340. [v. 211].</P>
<P>To suppose that kind of Love, which in its very be∣ginning is contrary to duty, difficult to be overcome, is to deny ourselves a title to virtue, as well as discretion, vi. 208. [vii. 208].</P>

<P>THE worthy Widow of a worthy man, will, in mate∣rial cases, determine by what she imagines her husband would have done, or wished her to do, were he living, ii. 22. [123].</P>
<P>The last refuge of battered rakes, and the chief hope of younger brothers, lie in the good-nature of Widows; and sometimes, of forward maids, v. 187. [vi. 165].</P>
<P><HI>Considerate</HI> women will not despise a diligent plain man for a first husband, since such a one is likely to raise a fortune, which, if he be so kind as to die in good time, may recommend her to the arms of a gayer second, v. 188. [vi. 166].</P>
<P>When such a worthy couple set out in taste, business, the good lady's first rise, will probably be despised, and

<P>Monuments for the dead should rather afford matter of instruction to the living, than panegyrics on the departed, [where those panegyrics are not in themselves instructive] ii. 102. [203].</P>

<P>A worthy successor will perform what he knows to have been the intentions, as well as the written injunctions of the deceased, ii. 118. [219].</P>

<P>A Witty Woman's vivacity may less become the wife, than the single woman, iii. 3. [163].</P>
<P>Vivacity should never carry us beyond the bounds of prudence and discretion, iii. 7. [167].</P>

<P>It is difficult for Young Persons of genius to rein-in their imaginations, i. 21. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>

<P>It is a great virtue in good-natured Youth to be able to say NO, i. 238. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Young Men of character and ability should not be put to difficulties at their entrance into the world. The greatest expences are then incurred; and in scanty be∣ginnings, scanty plans must be laid, and pursued, ii. 344. [iii. 88].</P>

<P>By avoiding intrigues, or giving offence to serious or pious people, a Young man travelling, will intitle him∣self to the respect of every worthy foreigner, as well as native, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Good-nature is the characteristic of Youth, iii. 185. [345].</P>
<P>Young people should consider, that they may often re∣joice in the company of one other, when they cannot have that of parents, and friends in years, iv. 248. [v. 119].</P>
<P>A good Young Man, not occasionally questioned in his conduct by a faithful monitor, will be diffident of the ground he stands upon, iv. 323. [v. 203].</P>
<P>It is a lovely sight to see blooming Youth fond of declining age, v. 242. [vi. 220].</P>
<P>Those who respect age, deserve to live to be old, and to be respected themselves, v. 349. [vi. 327].</P>
<P>Youth is rather to be pitied than envied by people in years; since it is doomed to toil thro' the rugged road of life, which the others have passed through, in search of happiness that is not to be met with; and which, at the highest, can only be compounded for, by a contented mind, vi. 11.

<HEAD>Copy of LETTER to a LADY, who was solicitous for an
additional volume to the HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON;
supposing it ended abruptly, and expressing herself desirous to
see Sir CHARLES in the Parental Cha∣racter; and to know if the Story
were intended to be carried further.</HEAD>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I Write to your commands sent me yesterday.</P>
<P>I have no intention of pursuing further the History of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON: And hope, when you consider the cir∣cumstances of the Story, you will be of opinion, that it ends very properly where it does; tho' at the first perusal it may seem, to a Lady who honours the piece with her approbation, to conclude a little abruptly; and the rather, as the necessary delay in publishing the last volume, occasioned by the treatment I met with from Dublin, made persons imagine that marvellous events, and violent catastrophes, were preparing; and but for which treatment the three last volumes would have been published together.</P>
<P>The Story of PAMELA was supposed to have taken place within thirty years, that of CLARISSA within twenty, of their respective publications. In either of those spaces of time, there was room to marry and bury half a generation of people.</P>
<P>That of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is supposed to be more recent. In his recital of what passed between himself and Clementina, long before the Story began, and before he had hopes of being allowed by his Father (then living) to return to England, he mentions the rebellion in 1745 and 1746; and that the exult∣ations made over him in Italy, on the reported success of the young Adventurer, obliged him to go to Vienna.</P>
<P>What passed between him and Clementina, and her Family, on his return from thence to Bologna, till he quitted Italy, and (on his Father's death) arrived in England, may be supposed to take up a considerable space of time.</P>
<P>He had been about fifteen months in England when the Story begins. That takes up a year and half.</P>
<P>All this may be supposed to bring it down pretty near to the present time.</P>
<P>EMILY, under the direction of so prudent a guardian, was not, for example sake, to be married till she was near twenty.</P>
<P>Lady GRANDISON'S circumstances and her lying-in, would not
<PB N="404" REF="412"/>
permit her to leave England for a voyage to Italy, so soon as might be hoped for by Clementina and her friends. Sir Charles had a view, I fansy, to those delicate circumstances, when he offered to make them judges of the reasons, should he and his Harriet be unable to attend them within the next year, why they could not.</P>
<P>Do you think Harriet would not be a Nurse as well as Lady G? It would be a desirable thing, we may suppose, to all their Italian friends, as well as suitable to the maternal fondness, for her to take her child with her: But would she do so, till it was at least a year old? There is no doubt but it would be a very fine and forward child: But the heir of Sir Charles Grandison must not be needlesly, or for a compliment, exposed to dangers and difficulties. Read again the passage by land over mount Cenis; acquaint your∣self with the Bay of Biscay, were they to go by sea.</P>
<P>As to the good JERONYMO, he is happy where he is. Lady G. makes him alive and merry: And have you not an intimation that he is to go to Bath? And do you think that those salutary springs will not, for the honour of our country, quite establish him?</P>
<P>CLEMENTINA, at the year's end, may either marry the Count of BELVEDERE, her malady not returning; or, as Sir Charles has engaged all her friends to promise, may, at her own request, be allowed more time. You have seen that the COUNT acquiesces entirely with whatever shall be her will, in this particular.</P>
<P>Do you think, Madam, I have not been very complaisant to my Readers to leave to them the decision of this important article? I am apt to think, from what I have already heard from several of them, of no small note, and great good sense, that a considerable time will pass before this point will be agreed upon among <HI>them:</HI> And some of my correspondents rejoice that Clementina is not married in the book; hoping that she will never marry; while others express their satisfaction in the time given her, and doubt not but she will. Some are pleased with the Count; others not. Some are of opinion, with Jeronymo, that her compliance with the silent wishes of her friends, when left entirely to her own will was the only duty wanting to complete her character; she having voluntarily renounced, so nobly as she did, the only man whom she preferred to <HI>him</HI> who was the choice of her parents, and given up her wishes to be allowed to take the veil.</P>
<P>Let us take a survey of what is done for the other characters.</P>
<P>No more need be said, than is, of EVERARD GRANDISON; or of Aunt ELEANOR.</P>
<P>Mr. DEANE, you see, is provided for, to his own, and every one's content.</P>
<P>So is good Dr. BARTLETT.</P>
<P>The skilful LOWTHER also.</P>
<P>Sir EDW. BEAUCHAMP and EMILY are in a way to be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="413"/>
Who can be more so than Mrs. SHIRLEY? Why, Madam, would you wish to have further time taken in, to conclude a life so valuable, so exemplary?</P>
<P>Sir ROWLAND and Mr. FOWLER are not unhappy. They are going to Caermarthen; and you remember, Sir Rowland says, there are fine girls in Caermarthenshire.</P>
<P>Mr. SELBY goes on at Selby-house crowing over his Wife, and his Nieces; and, tho' always defeated by their good-humoured arguments, and superior sense, crowing on, and making all around him pleasant.</P>
<P>Who can be happier than Mr. and Mrs. REEVES?</P>
<P>LUCY has already her PEER.</P>
<P>I could have given NANCY SELBY to Mr. ORME; but that it is not right to put together two persons who neither of them have entire health, till they are quite recovered; and that would take up time. He, accompanied by his Sister, is a second time gone to Lisbon, you know. And she, Emily hints, is not without her Lover.</P>
<P>Miss ORME is a good girl, and must be happy.</P>
<P>As for GREVILLE and FENWICK, who cares for them?</P>
<P>The fate of Sir HARGRAVE, of MERCEDA, of BAGENHALL, is absolutely, and exemplarily, decided.</P>
<P>JAMES SELBY is as good as provided for: But if he had not, it would not have been much matter.</P>
<P>Lady BETTY WILLIAMS indeed, and her forward Daughter, and Miss CANTILLON, are deservedly unhappy; and there are too many of such characters, in every-body's knowlege, to require <HI>theirs</HI> to be further dwelt upon.</P>
<P>Lady BEAUCHAMP, Lady MANSFIELD and her family, Lord and Lady W. Lord and Lady L. are all happy. Lord G. also. And his CHARLOTTE is as good as <HI>she</HI> can be. Her Lord wishes her not better than we leave her.</P>
<P>Sir CHARLES is the happiest of men. Plans of his beneficence, oeconomy, charity, have been actually laid down.</P>
<P>His LADY is, as she deserves to be, the happiest of women.</P>
<P>By what we have seen of <HI>both,</HI> we know how they will behave on every future call or occasion.</P>
<P>CLEMENTINA, let me add to the notice I have taken of her, is mistress of her own will. By the power Sir Charles, in the articles he drew, stipulated for her, we know she will make herself happy in acts of beneficence; and, as he has foretold, will see every-thing in a chearful light, that before appeared to her in a cloudy one. What will be the result?</P>
<P>LAURANA has been punished, in kind, as we may say.</P>
<P>Lady SFORZA also.</P>
<P>The MARQUIS, the MARCHIONESS, the GENERAL, the BISHOP, in short, the whole <HI>Porretta family,</HI> are happy to the extent of their wishes.</P>
<P>Mrs. BEAUMONT is highly so in the general felicity.</P>
<P>So is Father MARESCOTTI.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="414"/>
Should the story, which were it prolonged to do every-thing that seems to be expected, would take up more time, though not quantity of matter, than it has already taken up, be continued for the sake of OLIVIA? Surely, No.</P>
<P>Can it, then, be more happily concluded than it is?</P>
<P>As to what you are pleased to hint of the Hero's appearing to shine in the parental character, have I not in PAMELA entered into that subject pretty largely? And have I not in this history avoided touching upon the same topics that I have treated on in either of the two former?</P>
<P>But you will be apt to say, You expected more on these sub∣jects from Sir Charles's character, than from that of Mr. B. or even of his Pamela.</P>
<P>But (to say nothing of his care for the education of his Father's natural children by Mrs. Oldham) see we not, from his tenderness to Mrs. Reeves's little boy; from his goodness to Lady L's son; and to Lady G's little girl; from the observation of his Lady, that the Brave are always tender and humane; from his general prudence, as well as from his own duty to a blameable Father, whose failings he occasionally deplored with a piety worthy of himself; that he would have shone in every part of the parental character? [Who ever knew a dutiful Son that made not a good Father?] And where, and at what age of his children, had I entered into such par∣ticulars, should I have been allowed to stop; since, as they grew in years, they would have had larger demands on his cares?</P>
<P>I might indeed, in what <HI>is done,</HI> have introduced a conversa∣tion in which the Education of Children might have been touched upon, and his opinion given: But the lovers of Story would have found fault with me for it, as they have done with the few inde∣pendent conversations that appear in the book, however useful others have thought them: And besides, the occasion must have been forced in. Nor would the subject have appeared with the requisite advantage, handled by, or before, single men and women, or even by young married people, who had no opportunities to strengthen their opinions by experience.</P>
<P>Permit me further to observe, that the conclusion of a <HI>single story</HI> is indeed generally some great and decisive event; as a <HI>Death,</HI> or a <HI>Marriage:</HI> But in scenes of life carried down nearly to the present time, and in which a <HI>variety of interesting characters</HI> is introduced, all events cannot be decided, unless, as in the History of <HI>Tom Thumb the Great,</HI> all the actors are killed in the last scene; since persons presumed to be still living, must be supposed liable to the various turns of human affairs.</P>
<P>All that can be expected therefore in such a work, if its ending is proposed to afford the most complete scene of felicity of which human life is capable, must be to leave the principal characters happy, and the rest with fair prospects of being so.</P>
<P>I am, however, greatly obliged to you, Madam, for having so
<PB N="407" REF="415"/>
far interested yourself in the story, as to write to me upon it; and beg leave to subscribe myself</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obliged and most obedient Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ANSWER to a LETTER from a FRIEND, who had
objected to Sir CHARLES GRANDISON's Offer to allow his Daughters by
Lady CLEMENTINA, had his Marriage with her taken Effect, to be
educated Roman Catholics.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Mar. 25. 1754.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received, my dear friend, several anonymous Letters written on the same subject with your favour before me of the 19th; finding fault with Sir Charles Grandison for his offered compromise with the friends of Clementina, in the article of Re∣ligion; all of them expressing, as yours does, a laudable zeal for the interests of the Protestant cause.</P>
<P>One of the gentlemen desired an answer to what he wrote, di∣recting whither it was to be sent. I do not think myself at liberty to transcribe for you his Letter, though an anonymous one, and which would do credit to any writer: But as your Letter and his are in substance pretty much the same, you will allow me to hope for your attention to the extracts I shall make from my answer to his; and if they are not of sufficient weight with you to excuse the Hero in this important article, I shall be ready, at your com∣mand, to re-consider it.</P>
<P>This gentleman wishes, as you do, that I had gone further into the subject: That I had exposed the iniquity of such compromises, and shewn, that the souls of girls ought to be as much regarded as those of boys; and the rather, as such stipulations are now made a point in course, in the marriage-treaties of persons of dif∣ferent religions. He is so good as to call for my opinion on the subject. Thus I answered.</P>
<P>Give me leave, Sir, to say, I have shewn in the work, when the subject required it, that I have the honour to be of your opinion as to this compromise. I have, in Vol. iii. <HI>Octavo,</HI> p. 105, 106. made the Bishop (Clementina's Brother) thus say to Mr. Grandison, after a debate between them on the two religions; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You will call to mind, Chevalier, that <HI>your</HI> church allows of a possibility of salvation out of its pale—<HI>Ours</HI> does not."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lord," answers the Chevalier, "our church allows not of its members indulging themselves in capital errors, against conviction."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grandison was a young man: He pretended not to be di∣vested of passion. It was necessary to let the Porretta family, and the Reader, who it was supposed, would not be unconcerned in the destiny of Clementina, see, that he was willing to make some sacrifices, for those the family made, in consideration of so excel∣lent a creature, who had suffered so much, and was actually in a
<PB N="408" REF="416"/>
state of suffering, for her Love of him. What could he do <HI>more,</HI> he asks Dr. Bartlett, than to make such an offer? He considers it as a very great concession, though he must know, that it was, as you, Sir, observe, a too usual one: And he tells her warmest re∣lations, the General in particular, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he would not have come into such a compromise, no, not in favour of a princess, in a <HI>beginning</HI> address."</Q> And this he says in answer to the General's question, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, Chevalier, must the poor daughters have done, that <HI>they</HI> should have been left to perdition?"</Q> And this put by that haughty man, when he knew that Mr. Grandison was of a religion which inspires its professors with more charity, than does that which allows not salvation out of its own pale; and the souls of whose daughters therefore, in his opinion, could not be endanger'd merely by such an education.</P>
<P>Who that thinks the Porretta family bigotted, must not have allowed <HI>them</HI> to think Mr. Grandison so, had he not made some such sort of concession as he expected them to make? Nay, the, actually made a much greater than <HI>be</HI> offered [The SONS of the family]; and besides, were more apprehensive of their Daugh∣ter's change of religion, were the marriage to take place, than hopeful of his.</P>
<P>Some concessions are expected to be made in all marriage treaties; and (contrary to what was proposed in <HI>this</HI>) greater, fre∣quently, on the man's than on the woman's part; since it is under∣stood, that the wife is more the property of the husband, than he is hers; and he therefore in marriage makes an acquisition. Pecuniary sacrifices could not have affected Mr. Grandison: No∣thing but what touched his principles could. This was a severe trial to him. Clementina, at the time, was the only woman he could have loved. He knew not then Miss Byron: But we have reason to believe, from different parts of the story, that he thought himself not unhappy, that a marriage, to be entered into on such terms, took not effect; as well as that it was owing to Clementina herself, and not to him, that it did not; frequent as such compromises are in marriage-treaties between people of different persuasions.</P>
<P>That these observations lie scattered, as I may say, in different parts of the story, is owing, a good deal, to the manner of writing, (to the moment, as it may be called) as occasions arose in the pro∣gress of the story: A manner of writing that has its conveniencies and inconveniencies. The <HI>latter,</HI> in such cases as that before us; the <HI>former,</HI> in giving opportunities to describe the agitations that fill the heart, in the progress of a material and interesting subject, the event of which remains undecided.</P>
<P>You will be pleased to observe, that I had a very nice and dif∣ficult task to manage, to convince nice and delicate Ladies, who, it might be imagined, would sit in judgment upon the conduct of a man in a Love-case (who was presumed to be nearly perfect, and proposed as a pattern) that a Lady so excellent as Clementina; of
<PB N="409" REF="417"/>
so high a family and fortune; all her relations adoring her; so deeply in love with him; yet so delicate in her whole behaviour to him; was not slighted by <HI>him.</HI> What would the Ladies, and the men of gallantry, have said, had he not done all it was possible for him to do, to obtain so rich a prize?</P>
<P>Allow me to say, that if his distress, in different scenes of the story, were duly attended to (attacked as he was on the side of his Generosity, his Compassion, his Gratitude, his Love) together with his stedfastness in his own Religion, I presume, that, in the whole affair between him and Clementina, he would be rather thought a confessor for it, than a lukewarm man in it. Be pleased to reperuse what he says to Miss Byron on this subject, in the library at Colnebrook, <HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>Octavo, p.</HI> 29, 30. <HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 189, 190. <HI>Duodecimo.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What must be my grief, to be obliged to disappoint such ex∣pectations as were raised by persons who had so sincere a value for me! You cannot, madam, imagine my distress: So little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they supposed to be in an error that would inevitably cast him into perdition! But when the friendly Brother implored my compliance; when the excellent Mother, in effect, besought me to have pity on <HI>her</HI> heart, and on her <HI>child</HI>'s head; and when the tender, the amiable Clementina, putting <HI>herself</HI> out of the question, urged me, for my soul's sake, to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church—What, madam—But how I grieve you!'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'[He stopt, says Miss Byron—His handkerchief was of use to him, as mine was to me—What a distress was here!]'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And what, and what, Sir, sobbing, was the result? Could you, <HI>could</HI> you resist?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Satisfied in my own faith! Entirely satisfied! Having insu∣perable objections to that I was wished to embrace!—A Lover of my native country too—Were not my God and my Country to be the sacrifice, if I complied? But I <HI>laboured,</HI> I <HI>studied,</HI> for a compromise. I must have been unjust to Clementina's merit, and to my own character, had she not been dear to me. And indeed I beheld graces in her <HI>then,</HI> that I had before resolved to shut my eyes against; her Rank next to princely; her Fortune high as her rank; Religion; Country; all so many obstacles that had appeared to me insuperable, removed by <HI>themselves;</HI> and no ap∣prehension left of a breach of the laws of hospitality, which had, till now, made me struggle to behold one of the most amiable and noble-minded of women with indifference.'</Q>—Then he relates his offer of compromise.</P>
<P>And let me add here that noble apostrophe of his, when he had been contemplating the perfections of Clementina, the wor∣thiness of her family, and their great offers to him—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, O my Religion, and my Country! I cannot, cannot renounce you.
<PB N="410" REF="418"/>
What can this world give, what can it promise, to warrant such a sacrifice?"</Q></P>
<P>Nor are these the strongest instances that he gives of his at∣tachment to his Religion and Country in the course of the work; to say nothing of what might be supposed to pass between him and the Bishop, in their debate on the two Religions; in which he convinced the Prelate (who from that time forbore to attack him on that subject) that he had a great deal to say in behalf of his own.</P>
<P>In an omission in the Sixth Volume, Octavo, which is supplied p. 401, 402. Lucy Selby is made thus to express herself, with regard to this compromise, in order to weaken the danger to Reli∣gion that might be apprehended from the example—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How could Sir Charles, so thorough an Englishman, have been happy with an Italian wife? His heart indeed is generously open and bene∣volent to people of all countries. He is, in the noblest sense, a Citizen of the World: But see we not, that his long residence abroad has only the <HI>more</HI> endeared to him the Religion, the Government, the Manners, of England?"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How was this noble-minded man, proceeds she, entangled by delicacies of situation, by friendship, by compassion, that he should ever have been likely to be engaged in a family of Ro∣man Catholics, and lived half of his days out of his beloved country; and the other half to have set, as to the world's eye, such an example in it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know, adds Miss Selby, he would have made it his study to prevent any mischief to his neighbours from the active zeal of his Lady's confessor, had a certain compromise taken effect. I remember the hint he gave to Father Marescotti<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 122. Octave—Vol. v. p. 93. Duodecimo.</NOTE>: But would even that good man have thought himself bound to ob∣serve faith with heretics in such a case?"</Q></P>
<P>And in the Concluding Note to the work, I have further en∣deavoured to obviate the apprehended mischief, by declining to <HI>contend</HI> with such of my Readers, whose laudable zeal led them to consider this compromise as a fault.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Friend, you will see, that, however usual it may be for people of different Religions, when they intermarry, to enter into compromises of this kind, they are not countenanced by the <HI>judgment</HI> of Sir Charles Grandison; who considered, as the greatest misfortune that could have befallen him, the situation he was in; which in a manner <HI>compelled</HI> him to make some con∣cessions, in compassion to an excellent woman, who laboured under a disorder of mind on his account.</P>
<P>After all, if this concession of Sir Charles is to be deemed a blemish, it is rather a blemish in his conduct than in his character. Very few in <HI>his</HI> circumstances would have done better; few so well: And what he offered, in so <HI>peculiar</HI> a situation, is by no means a precedent to be pleaded in <HI>common</HI> cases.</P>
<P>Believe me to be, with equal truth and affection, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most obedient Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
