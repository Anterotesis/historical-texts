<L>YE True-Born <HI>Englishmen</HI> proceed,</L>
<L>Our trifling Crimes detect,</L>
<L>Let the Poor starve, Religion bleed,</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch</HI> be damn'd, the <HI>French</HI> succeed,</L>
<L>And all by your Neglect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>Your actions all the World disgust,</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> are only glad,</L>
<L>Your friends your honesty distrust,</L>
<L>And while you think you're wise and just,</L>
<L>The Nation thinks you mad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>Are these the ways your wisdom take,</L>
<L>To raise our reputation?</L>
<L>To quarrel at a few mistakes,</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>France</HI> their own advantage makes,</L>
<L>And Laughs at all the Nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>You are the People who of old</L>
<L>The Nations Troops disbanded,</L>
<L>And now you should your Friends uphold,</L>
<L>Your Friends and you are bought and sold,</L>
<L>As always was intended.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>There's none but Fools in time to come,</L>
<L>Will Trust the <HI>English</HI> Nation;</L>
<L>For if they do, they know their doome,</L>
<L>That we'l be falling out at home,</L>
<L>And baulk their Expectation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>You are the Nations grand defence,</L>
<L>Against Illegal power,</L>
<L>And yet against both Law and Sence,</L>
<L>And sometimes too without pretence,</L>
<L>You send folk to the <HI>Tower.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<L>Some Lords your anger have incurr'd,</L>
<L>For Treaty of Partition,</L>
<L>But if you'l take the Nations word,</L>
<L>Most People think it was absurd,</L>
<L>And empty of discretion.</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if that Treaty as 'tis fam'd,</L>
<L>Gave part of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Gaul,</HI></L>
<L>Why should those Gentlemen be blam'd,</L>
<L>When you your selves are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>To let them take it all.</L>

<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<L>Bribes and ill practices you found,</L>
<L>And some few felt your power,</L>
<L>But soon you run your selves aground,</L>
<L>For had you push'd the matter round,</L>
<L>You all had gone to th' <HI>Tower.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<L>Some Reformation hath from you,</L>
<L>In vain been long expected,</L>
<L>But when you shou'd the business do,</L>
<L>Your private quarrels you pursue,</L>
<L>And th' Nation lies neglelcted.</L>

<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<HEAD>11.</HEAD>
<L>Long has the Kingdom born the weight</L>
<L>Of your deficient Funds,</L>
<L>That Parliamentary publique cheat,</L>
<L>Pray where's the difference of that</L>
<L>And Plundering with Dragoons?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>12.</HEAD>
<L>Are you the People that complain</L>
<L>Of Arbitrary Power?</L>
<L>Then shew the Nation if you can,</L>
<L>Where Kings have been since Kings began,</L>
<L>Such Tyrants as you are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>13.</HEAD>
<L>When Kings with right and Law dispence,</L>
<L>And set up Power despotick,</L>
<L>It has been counted Law and sence</L>
<L>To take up Arms against our Prince,</L>
<L>And call in aids Exotick.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<L>But you, although your Powers depend</L>
<L>On every Plowman's Vote,</L>
<L>Beyond the Law that Power extend,</L>
<L>To ruine those you should defend,</L>
<L>And sell the Power you bought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>15.</HEAD>
<L>The King Religion did Commend</L>
<L>To you his <HI>Law-Explainors,</HI></L>
<L>We know not what you may intend,</L>
<L>Nor how you should Religion mend,</L>
<L>Unless you will your Manners.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<L>You are the Nations darling Sons,</L>
<L>The abstract of our Mobb,</L>
<L>For City Knights and Wealthy Clowns,</L>
<L>Stock Jobbers, Statesmen and Buffoons,</L>
<L>You may defye the Globe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>17.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Toland</HI> insults the Holy Ghost,</L>
<L>Brib'd <HI>S—r</HI> bribes accuses,</L>
<L>Good Manners and Religion's lost,</L>
<L>The King who was your Lord of Host,</L>
<L>The Raskal <HI>H—w</HI> abuses.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>18.</HEAD>
<L>Your Statesman <HI>G—lle</HI> with intent</L>
<L>To Cultivate with care,</L>
<L>The dignity of Parliament</L>
<L>Plyes closely at the Dancing tent,</L>
<L>And manages <HI>May</HI>-Fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>19.</HEAD>
<L>The True-Born Heroes diligence</L>
<L>For publique good appears,</L>
<L>There he refines his Wit and Sense,</L>
<L>That the next day in our defence</L>
<L>May fill Committee Chairs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>20.</HEAD>
<L>The limitation of the Crown</L>
<L>Is your Immediate care,</L>
<L>If your <HI>Wise Articles</HI> go down,</L>
<L>Your Power will be so Lawless grown,</L>
<L>'Tis no matter who's the Heir.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>21.</HEAD>
<L>Did we for this depose our Prince,</L>
<L>And Liberty assume,</L>
<L>That you should with our Laws dispense,</L>
<L>Commit Mankind without Offence,</L>
<L>And Govern in his room?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>22.</HEAD>
<L>You shou'd find out some other word</L>
<L>To give the Crowns <HI>Accepter,</HI></L>
<L>To call him King wou'd be absurd,</L>
<L>For tho' he'l seem to wear the Sword,</L>
<L>'Tis You have got the Scepter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>23.</HEAD>
<L>And now your wrath is smoaking hot</L>
<L>Against the <HI>Kent</HI> Petition,</L>
<L>No man alive can tell for what</L>
<L>But telling Truths which pleas'd you not,</L>
<L>And taxing your Discretion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>24.</HEAD>
<L>If you those Gentlemen detain</L>
<L>By your unbounded Power,</L>
<L>'Tis hop'd you'l never more complain</L>
<L>Of Bishops in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign,</L>
<L>Sent blindly to the <HI>Tower.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>25.</HEAD>
<L>A strange Memorial too there came,</L>
<L>Your Members to affront,</L>
<L>Which told you Truths you dare not name,</L>
<L>And so the Paper scap'd the Flame,</L>
<L>Or else it had been burnt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>26.</HEAD>
<L>Some said the Language was severe,</L>
<L>And into Passion flew,</L>
<L>Some too began to curse and swear,</L>
<L>And call'd the Author <HI>Mutineere,</HI></L>
<L>But all men said 'Twas True.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>27.</HEAD>
<L>But oh! the Consternation now</L>
<L>In which you all appear!</L>
<L>'Tis plain from whence your terrours flew,</L>
<L>For had your guilt been less you knew,</L>
<L>So would have been your fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>28.</HEAD>
<L>In Fifteen Articles you're told</L>
<L>You have our Rights betray'd,</L>
<L>Banter'd the Nation, bought and sold</L>
<L>The Liberties you shou'd uphold;</L>
<L>No wonder you're afraid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>29.</HEAD>
<L>And now to make your selves appear</L>
<L>The more Impertinent,</L>
<L>A wise Address you do prepare,</L>
<L>To have his Majesty take care</L>
<L><HI>Rebellion</HI> to prevent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>30.</HEAD>
<L>No doubt his Majesty will please</L>
<L>To take your Cause in hand,</L>
<L>Besides the work is done with ease,</L>
<L>Full <HI>Seven Thousand Men</HI> he has</L>
<L>The Nation to defend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>31.</HEAD>
<L>One hundred Thousand Heroes more</L>
<L>Do our Train'd Bands compose,</L>
<L>If foraign Forces shou'd come or're,</L>
<L>Plant them and you upon the Shoar,</L>
<L>How bravely you'l oppose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>32.</HEAD>
<L>Then blush ye Senators to see</L>
<L>How all men stand dismay'd,</L>
<L>The Nation shou'd so patient be,</L>
<L>To bear with all your Villany,</L>
<L>And see themselves betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>33.</HEAD>
<L>It was our Freedom to defend,</L>
<L>That <HI>We the People</HI> chose you,</L>
<L>And <HI>We the People</HI> do pretend</L>
<L>Our power of Choosing may extend</L>
<L>To punish and depose you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>34.</HEAD>
<L>For since in vain our Hopes and Fears,</L>
<L>Petitions too are vain,</L>
<L>No Remedy but this appears,</L>
<L>To pull the House about your Ears,</L>
<L>And send you home again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>35.</HEAD>
<L>These are the Nations Discontents,</L>
<L>The Causes are too true,</L>
<L>The Ploughman now his Choice repents,</L>
<L>For tho he values Parliaments,</L>
<L>He's out of Love with <HI>You.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>36.</HEAD>
<L>When to be chose with Caps in hand</L>
<L>You courted every Voice,</L>
<L>You were our Servants at command,</L>
<L>By which it seems you understand,</L>
<L>Untill we made our Choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>37.</HEAD>
<L>If that be True, we let you know</L>
<L>Upon that very score,</L>
<L>You'd best your present Hours bestow</L>
<L>In all the Mischiefs you can do,</L>
<L>For We'l ne're choose you more.</L>
