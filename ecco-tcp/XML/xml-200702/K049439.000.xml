<HEAD><HI>Dyers</HI> News Examined as to His <HI>Sweddish</HI> Memorial against the <HI>Review.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAD not the Town been allarm'd with my Name in Print, and all my Friends surpris'd with a prospect of something Fatal at∣tending it; I had not for a long time appeared in Print again in this part of <HI>Britain,</HI>—But I can not be so far wanting to the desires of those whom this has amused, as to forbear giving the World some Account of it.</P>
<P>'Tis sent down it seems in <HI>Dyers</HI> News from <HI>London,</HI> that the <HI>Sweddish</HI> Ambassador <HI>Monsieur Liencroon</HI> has delivered in a Memorial to this Court, complaining of the <HI>Review,</HI> as Reflecting on the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and de∣mands Satisfaction.</P>
<P>First, Gentlemen, I assure you I know nothing of this my self, neither from my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> nor from the Government, neither do I be∣lieve one Word of it. I have immediately on Notice of this Written to <HI>England,</HI> and desir'd some of my Friends to wait on the Secretaries of State to acquaint them where I am, and that if it be required, I will on the first Notice take Post for <HI>London,</HI> and put my self into their Hands, to Answer any thing the Law shall require.</P>
<P>In the next place, I have Revised what I have Writ of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and I profess I can see nothing in it in the least, that is or ought to be an Affront to His <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty.</P>
<P>And lastly, I thank GOD, I Live in a Land where the Liberty of the Subject is such, that should all this be true, I can receive no Hurt but by Law.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> indeed has carried it with so high a Hand in some parts of the World, that their Princes deliver up their Subjects bound Hand and Foot for him to use his Pleasure with them.—But GOD be Praised, the Queen of <HI>England</HI> is none of those: The Liberty of <HI>English</HI> Men is in a better Case, and no Man can be Punished in <HI>England</HI> at the will of the Prince, much less at the will of a Forreign Prince.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> even the Soveraign can not punish but by Law, the Subject must have a fair Tryal, and a Jury of his Equals must Determine the Fact: If the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> should demand the delivering up the meanest Subject the Queen has, even a meaner, <HI>if such can be,</HI> than the Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> Her Majesty would immediately Reply, That it is not in Her Power to deliver any of Her Subjects up, or to punish them any farther
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
than as the Law directs: And that the meanest and most despicable Subject in <HI>England</HI> may even say to his Soveraign, <HI>That he will not be delivered up.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I believe the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> can think he has an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> to deal with in the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that he can de∣mand a Count <HI>Zobor</HI> of Her Majesty.</P>
<P>I am content to be answerable to the Law, if I have offended him or any Body else; and it is no Arrogancy to say I am a Subject of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and of no other Mortal Power in the World.</P>
<P>This is to be a Subject to GOD and the Queen, for an Obedience to the Law is all the Subjection, <HI>speaking of Humane Affairs,</HI> that either GOD or the Queen requires.</P>
<P>But what is it you said of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> says the Enquirers, you must have said some ill thing of him, or else he would not have Complain∣ed of your Paper by his Ambassador?</P>
<P>Truly, Gentlemen, I'll tell you as near as I can what I said of him—and if I tell it again, you will say, 'Tis a sign I have not much fear upon me of his Resentment.</P>
<P N="1">1. I said, That the <HI>Swede</HI> lying in <HI>Saxony</HI> all this Summer with 50000 Men about him, and doing nothing, while he suffered his new King of <HI>Poland</HI> to be ruin'd, and the Countrey to be ravaged by the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> signified that he had some secret design in his Head, some project on Foot, which no Body knew of but himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. I said, If he had no Design, no Meaning, no Prospect, and yet lay still there, while his Subjects and his Allies were ruined by his Enemies, he was the most Impolitick, Nothing-doing Prince in the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. I said, That for a Prince to neglect the Defence of his own Subjects, and leave them Exposed to the Invasion of Cruel and Barbarous Neighbours, when he is at the same time pushing on the Conquests and Triumphs of Victory against their Neighbours, is all one with a Father who neglects to provide for his Family, of whom the Text says, he is worse than an Infidel.</P>
<P N="4">4. I said, That if the <HI>Swede</HI> should fall on the Emperor, and thereby oblige him to quitt the Confederacy, <HI>and make a separate Peace with France,</HI> we should have but little Cause to thank him for his Care of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. I said, That if the <HI>Swede</HI> should fall upon the Emperor, and oblige him to draw all his Troops from <HI>Hungaria, Naples, Provence</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> he would be beaten, and not be able to stand before him.</P>
<P>These and such as these is the utmost of the Matter, and if the <HI>Swedish</HI> Ambassador has made a Complaint of this, I shall always be ready to Answer it.</P>
<P>If I had really said any thing which was Unbecoming me of the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> or any Body else, I should be willing to acknowledge it, and make Satisfaction; But as what I have said are both known and useful Truths, with a great deal of Calmness and Satisfaction I say I am ready to Answer him or any Man else, as far as the Liberty and Laws of <HI>Britain</HI> require, and so much for the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Ambassador.</P>
<P>'Tis a Happy thing, Gentlemen, to live under the laws of <HI>England,</HI> I hope you are advancing apace to the same Liberty, you may be assured no <HI>Nation</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> enjoys the like Privileges, and I hope you will all partake of them, and learn to value them.</P>
<P>No Resentment of Forreign Princes can affect us, no Threatnings terrifie us, an <HI>English</HI> man is born a free man, no Power can insult him, no Supe∣rior Oppress him; The Law only is his Governour, no Magistrate, no Counsellor, no Authority, no not the Sovereign has the least illegal Power over him, he can have no Sentence pronounced against him, no pu∣nishment inflicted, no Fine levied, no not by the Queen Her Self, but according to Law.</P>
<P>This is the Confidence, the Peace and the Glory of this Island, and no Forreign Power can interpose in it; If the greatest King or Emperor in the World demands of the Queen of <HI>Britain</HI> the delivering up any one of Her Subjects to them, they may lawfully refuse to go,—if the Sovereign puts a Man in Prison by His Royal Authority,—the Man serves the Judge with a Writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and he will let him out again, even Her Majesty her self, <HI>asking Pardon for the Expression,</HI> cannot detain him.</P>
<P>He that will abandon this Liberty is not a Fool only but a Knave, a Knave to himself, and to his Family, a Knave to his Posterity, and a Knave to the Constitution of the Nation, for he gives up the Right of a Subject, and leaves an Example of wilful Bondage to his Countreymen.</P>
<P>If there be any such, I have only to say, I am sure, I am not the Man: <HI>Britains</HI> Gentlemen are none of the Tribe of <HI>Issachar,</HI> whose Coat of Arms is an Ass couchant; what Burden the Law puts upon us, we freely submit to, and never complain either of the Law or of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>But we always Kick at Oppression, and Resist Tyrrany, and it has hither∣to, GOD be praised, been found in vain to Enslave us.</P>
<P>Her Majesty, the best Queen that ever Governed us, has made it Her Glory to Reign over a Free People, the Queen despises Tyrrany as infinitely below Her; It's Her Pleasure to see the Laws Triumph, 'tis Her Glory to see Justice Uninterrupted, and 'tis Her Majesties peculiar Blessing that there are none of Her People complaining of Oppression.</P>
<P>Attempts enough have been made to surprise the Government into Tyr∣rany, but both the Attempts and their Authors have found their <HI>Quietus</HI> in Her Majesties Justice, and in Her Native Aversion to Cruelty and Ar∣bitrary Power.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
'Tis from hence, with satisfaction, any Subject may say, and I say it with a secret Joy, that I can not express, the Innocent Man may fly with Safety to the Law, if he has not Offended, he is sure he shall not be Op∣prest, if he has, he is sure to find Justice always mingled with the Princes Compassion.</P>
<P>Let none of my Friends be afraid for me, if I have broke the Law, they ought to abandon me to the Law, and I ask no Favour; If I have not, no King, no Power, no Threatning, no not all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> can make Her Majesty break in upon Her Peoples Liberties, or Deviat from Justice, in the Satisfaction of which all Her Subjects are easie and safe, and I among the rest.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Dyer's</HI> Letter, he was always Careful that it should not be seen in <HI>London,</HI> whether for Shame or Fear is not Material, and from thence he often takes the Liberty to Forge Stories that have not the least ground of Truth in them, and this is not the first time he has done so by me in particu∣lar, which Forgeries he spreads in the Countrey, and the Letter not being to be had in the City, he is not so easily contradicted.</P>
<P>I must say, however, <HI>Dyer,</HI> the News Writer, ought to have been the last Man in the World to have said this in his Paper, since Monsieur <HI>Liencroon</HI> never took notice what he wrote in his publick Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Marlborrow</HI> obtained his desire of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> by Bribing Count <HI>Piper.</HI></P>
