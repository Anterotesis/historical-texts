<SPEAKER>Freeman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Country boy! ha, ha, ha! How long has this scheme
been in your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some time.— I am now convinced of what you have
often been hinting to me, that I am confoundedly cheated by
my servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, are you satisfied at last, Mr. Lovel? I always told
you, that there is not a worse set of servants in the parish of
St. James's than in your kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis with some difficulty I believe it now, Mr. Free∣man;
though, I must own, my expences often make me
stare.— Phillip, I am sure▪ is an honest fellow; and I will
swear for my blacks— If there is a rogue among my folks, it
is that surly dog Tom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken in every one. Phillip is an hypro∣critical
rascal; Tom has a good deal of surly honesty about
him; and for your blacks, they are as bad as your whites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Freeman, how came you to be so well ac∣quainted
with my people? None of the wenches are handsome
enough to move the affections of a middle-aged gentleman as
you are—ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a young man, Mr. Lovel, and take a pride
in a number of idle unnecessary servants, who are the plague
and reproach of this kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles you are an old-fashion'd fellow. Servants a
plague and reproach! ha, ha, ha! I would have forty more, if
my house would hold them.—Why, man, in Jamaica, before I
was ten years old, I had a hundred blacks kissing my feet eve∣ry
day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gentry of the western isles are high-metled ones,
and love pomp and parade. I have seen it delight your soul,
when the people in the street have stared at your equipage;
especially if they wispered loud enough to be heard, "That
is squire Lovel, the great West-Indian"—ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry if we were splenetic as you northern
islanders, who are devoured with melancholy and fog—ha, ha,
ha! No, Sir, we are children of the sun, and are born to diffuse
the bounteous favour which our noble parent is pleased to be∣stow
on us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had more of your noble parent's regularity,
and less of his fire. As it is you consume so fast, that not one
in twenty of you live to be fifty years old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in that fifty we live two hundred, my dear; mark
that—But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> business—I am resolved upon my frolic—I
will know whether my servants are rogues or not. If they
are, I'll bastmado the rascals; if not, I think I ought to pay
<PB REF="4"/>
for my impertinence. Pray tell me, is not your Robert ac∣quainted
with my people? Perhaps he may give a little light
into the thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, Mr. Lovel, your servants are
so abandoned, that I have forbid him your house. However,
if you have a mind to ask him any question, he shall be forth∣coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall: But it is an hundred to one if you get
any thing out of him; for though he is a very honest fellow,
yet he is so much of a servant, that he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll never tell any thing to
the disadvantage of another.—Who waits?— <STAGE>[Enter ser∣vant.]</STAGE>
Send Robert to me. <STAGE>[Exit servant.]</STAGE> And what was it
determin'd you upon this project at last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>This letter. It is an anonymous one, and so ought
not to be regarded; but it has something honest in it, and put
me upon satisfying my curiosity—Read it.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER>To Peregrine Lovel, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
Please your honour,</OPENER>
<P>I take the liberty to acquaint your honour, that you are
sadly cheated by your servants—Your honour will find it as
I say—I am not willing to be known; whereof, if I am, it
may bring one into trouble.</P>
<CLOSER>So no more from <SIGNED>your honour's
Servant to command.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
—Odd and honest! Well—and now what are the steps you in∣tend
to take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall immediately apply to my friend the manager
for a disguise.—Under the form of a gawky country boy, I
will be an eye-witness of my servants behaviour. You must
assist me Mr. Freeman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how, Mr. Lovel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My plan is this—I gave it out that I was going to my
borough in Devonshire; and yesterday set out with my servant
in great form, and lay at Basingstoke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ordered the fellow to make the best of his way down
into the country, and told him that I would follow him; in∣stead
of that. I turn'd back, and am just come to town:—

<P>How will you get in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I am properly habited, you shall get me intro∣duced
to Philip as one of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enants sons, who wants to be
made a good servant of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will certainly discover you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear; I'll be so countryfied, that you shall not
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
know me. As they are throughly persuaded I am many miles
off, they'll be more easily imposed on. Ten to one but they
begin to celebrate my departure with a drinking bout, if they
are what you describe them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall you be able to play your part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprised, Mr. Freeman, that you, who have
known me from my infancy, should not remember my abili∣ties
in that way.—How I play'd Daniel in the Conscious Lo∣vers
at school, and afterwards arrived at the distinguished cha∣racter
of the mighty Mr. Scrub.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour order'd me to wait on you.</P>

<P>I did, Robert.—Robert—</P>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come here. You know, Robert, I have a good opi∣nion
of your integrity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always endeavoured that your honour should.</P>

<P>Pray, have not you some acquaintance among Mr. Lo∣vel's
people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little, please your honour.</P>

<P>How do they behave?—We have nobody but
friends—you may speak out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Robert, speak out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope your honours will not insist on my saying any
thing in an adair of this kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but we do insist—If you know any thing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am but a servant myself; and it would not be∣come
me to speak ill of a brother-servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! this is false honesty—speak out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't oblige me, good Sir. Consider, Sir, a servant's
bread depends upon his <HI>carackter.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if a servant uses me ill—</P>

<P>Alas, Sir! what is one man's poison is another man's meat.</P>

<P>You see how they trim for one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Service, Sir, is no inheritance.—A servant that is not
approved in one place, may give satisfaction in another. Every
body must live, your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like your heartiness as well as your caution; but in
my case, it is necessary that I should know the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The truth, Sir, is not to be spoken at all times: it may
bring one into trouble, whereof if—</P>

<P>He blushes.</P>

<P>I ask you if you were concerned in writing this letter?
You never told me a lie yet, and I expect the truth from you
now</P>

<P>Pray, your honour, don't ask me.</P>
</SP>

<P>I cannot deny it.</P>
<STAGE>[Bowing.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>What induced you to do it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell the truth. I have seen such waste and ex∣travagance,
and riot and drunkenness, in your kitchen, Sir, that
as my master's friend, I could not help discovering it to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to say it to your honour, but your honour is
not only imposed on, but laughed at by all your servants espe∣cially
by Philip, who is a very bad man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Philip? An ungrateful dog! well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not presume to speak to your honour; and
therefore I resolved, though but a poor scribe, to write your
honour a letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert, I am greatly indebted to you—Here—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Offers money.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>On any other account than this, I should be proud to
receive your honour's bounty; but now I beg to be excused.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Refuses the money.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast a noble heart, Robert, and I'll not forget
you. Freeman, he must be in the secret. Wait your master's
orders.</P>

<P>I will, your honour.</P>

<P>Well Sir, are you convinced now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Convinced? Yes; and I'll be among the scoundrels
before night. You or Robert must contrive some way or other
to get me introduced to Philip as one of your cottagers boys
out of Essex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! You'll make a fine figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>They shall make a fine figure.—It must be done
this afternoon:—Walk with me across the park, and I'll tell
you the whole.—My name shall be <HI>Jemmy;</HI> and I am come to
be a gentleman's servant—and will do my best, and hope to get
a good <HI>carackter.</HI></P>

<STAGE>SCENE, The Park. Duke's Servant.</STAGE>
<P>What wretches are ordinary servants, that go on in the
same vulgar track every day! eating, working, and sleeping,
—But we, who have the honour to serve the nobility, are of
another species. We are above the common forms—have ser∣vants
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
to wait upon us, and are are as lazy and luxurious as our
masters. Ha! my dear sir Harry.</P>
<STAGE>Enter sir Harry's Servant.</STAGE>
<P>How have you done these thousand years?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord duke! your grace's most obedient servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, baronet and where have you been?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>At Newmarket my lord. We have had dev'lish
fine sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a good appearance, I hear. Pox take it, I should
have been there; but our old Dutchess died, and we were ob∣liged
to keep house, for the decency of the thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I picked up fifteen pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! a trifle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The viscount's people, have been bloodily taken
in this meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Credit me, baronet, they knew nothing of the turf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, my lord, they lost every match; for
Crab was beat hollow, Caresess threw his rider, and miss Slam∣merkin
had the distemper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I'm glad on't. Taste this snuff, sir
Harry:</P>
<STAGE>[Offers his box.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis good rappee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Strasburgh, I assure you; and of my own
importing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>The city-people adulterate it so confoundedly that I
always import my own snuff—I wish my lord would do the
same; but he is so indolent—When did you see the girls? I
saw lady Bab this morning; but, 'fore Gad, whether it be
love or reading, she looked as pale as a penitent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just had this card from Lovel's people.—
<STAGE>[Reads.]</STAGE> "Philip and Mrs Kitty present their compliments to
Sir Harry, and desire the honour of his company this even∣ing,
to be of a small party, and eat a bit of supper."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the same invitation.—Their master it seems is gone to his borough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be with us, my lord?—Philip's a blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>A buck of the first head. I'll tell you a secret,—he's going to be married.</P>

<P>To whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>To Kitty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is; and I intend to cuckold him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we may depend upon your grace for certain
ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>If our house breaks up in a tolerable time, I'll be
with you.—Have you any thing for us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes a little bit of poetry.—I must be at the
Cocoa tree till eight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh-ho! I am quite out of spirits—I had a
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
damned debauch last night, baronet.—Lord Francis, Bob the
bishop, and I, tipt off four bottles of Burgundy a piece.—Ha!
there are two fine girls coming!—Faith—lady Bab—aye,
and lady Charlotte.</P>
<STAGE>[Takes out his glass.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll not join them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes—Bab is a fine wench, notwithstanding her
complexion; though I should be glad she would keep her
teeth cleaner.—Your English women are damned negligent
about their teeth.—How is your Charlotte in that particular?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Charlotte!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay the world says you are to have her.</P>

<P>I own I did keep her company; but we are off,
my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Between you and me, she has a plaguy thick pair
of legs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! damn it that's insufferable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, she's a fool, and miss'd her opportunity
with the old countess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid baronet, you love money. Rot it, I
never save a shilling. Indeed I am sure of a place in the ex∣cise.
Lady Charlottee is to be of the party to night; how do
you manage that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, we do meet at a third place; are very civil,
and look queer, and laugh, and abuse one another, and all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<P>A-la-mode, ha! Here they are.</P>
</SP>
