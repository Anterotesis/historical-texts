<P>OF the following Volume, we need only say, that it contains the Remainder of those Miscellaneous Pieces, which were in some sort pro∣mised in the Preface to the former Volumes, or which have been written since. The <HI>Verses</HI> are paged separately, that they may be added to that
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
Volume which wholly consists of Verse, and the Treatise of the <HI>Bathos</HI> placed in their stead in This. The Reader may be assured no other Edi∣tion is either Genuine or Com∣pleat, and that they are all the Things of this Kind which will ever be Printed by the same Hands.</P>
<P>There are in this Volume, as in the former, one or two small pieces by other Hands.</P>

<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE OF Dr. <HI>Robert Norris,</HI> CONCERNING The <HI>Strange</HI> and <HI>Deplorable</HI> FRENZY of Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>N D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>IS,</HI> an Officer of the Custom-house.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an acknowledg'd Truth, that nothing is so dear to an honest Man as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the just Vindication of his Character, when it is in∣juriously attack'd by any Man. The Person I have at present Cause to complain of, is indeed in very melancholy Circumstances, it having pleas'd God to deprive him of his Senses, which may extenuate the Crime in Him. But I should be wanting in my Duty, not only to my self, but also to my Fellow-Creatures, to whom my
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Talents may prove of benefit, shou'd I suffer my Profession or Honesty to be undeservedly as∣pers'd. I have therefore resolv'd to give the Publick an account of all that has past between that unhappy Gentleman and my self.</P>
<P>On the 20<HI>th</HI> instant, while I was in my Closet pondering the Case of one of my Patients, I heard a Knocking at my Door, upon opening of which enter'd an old Woman with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that without my As∣sistance her Master would be utterly ruin'd. I was forc'd to interrupt her Sorrow by enquiring her Master's Name and Place of Abode. She told me he was one Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI> an Officer of the Custom-house, who was taken ill of a violent Frenzy last <HI>April,</HI> and had continu'd in those melancholy Circumstances, with few or no In∣tervals. Upon this I ask'd her some Questions relating to his Humour and Extravagancies, that I might the better know under what Regi∣men to put him, when the Cause of his Distem∣per was found out. Alas, Sir, says she, this Day fortnight in the Morning a poor simple Child came to him from the Printer's; the Boy had no sooner enter'd the Room, but he cry'd out, <HI>the Devil was come.</HI> He often stares ghast∣fully, raves aloud, and mutters between his Teeth the Word <HI>Cator,</HI> or <HI>Cato,</HI> or some such thing. Now, Doctor, this <HI>Cator</HI> is certainly a <HI>Witch,</HI> and my poor Master is under an evil Tongue: for I have heard him say <HI>Cator</HI> has be∣witch'd the whole Nation. It pitied my very Heart, to think that a Man of my Master's Un∣derstanding and great Scholarship, (who, as the
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Child told me, had a Book of his own in Print,) should talk so outragiously. Upon this I went and laid out a Groat for a Horshoe, which is at this time nail'd on the Threshold of his Door; but I don't find my Master is at all the better for it; he prepetually starts and runs to the Win∣dow when any one knocks, crying out, <HI>S' death! a Messenger from the French King! I shall die in the</HI> Bastile.</P>
<P>Having said this, the Old Woman presented me with a Viol of his Urine; upon Examination of which I preceiv'd the whole Temperament of his Body to be exceeding <HI>hot.</HI> I therefore in∣stantly took my Cane and my Beaver, and re∣pair'd to the Place where he dwelt.</P>
<P>When I came to his Lodgings near <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> up <HI>three Pair</HI> of Stairs, (which I should not have publish'd in this manner, but that this Lunatick <HI>conceals</HI> the Place of his Residence on purpose to prevent the good Offices of those charitable <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Physicians,</HI> who might attempt his Cure) when I came into the Room, I found this unfortunate Gentleman seated on his Bed, with Mr. <HI>Bernard Lintott,</HI> Bookseller, on the one side of him, and a grave elderly Gen∣tleman on the other, who, as I have since learnt, calls himself a <HI>Grammarian;</HI> the Latitude of whose Countenance was not a little eclips'd by the Fullness of his Peruke. As I am a black lean Man, of a pale Visage, and hang my Clothes on somewhat slovenly, I no sooner went in but he frown'd upon me, and cry'd out with vio∣lence, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>S'Death,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman!</HI> I am betray'd to the Tyrant! who cou'd have thought the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Queen would have deliver'd me up to <HI>France</HI> in this Treaty, and least of all that you, my Friends, wou'd have been in a Conspiracy against me?'</Q>—Sir, said I, here is neither Plot nor Conspiracy, but for your advantage. The Recovery of your Senses requires my At∣tendance, and your Friends sent for me on no other account. I then took a particular Survey of his Person, and the Furniture and Disposition of his Apartment. His Aspect was furious, his Eyes were rather fiery than lively, which he roll'd about in an uncommon manner. He often o∣pen'd his Mouth, as if he wou'd have utter'd some Matter of Importance, but the Sound seem'd lost inwardly. His Beard was grown, which they told me he would not suffer to be shav'd, believing the modern Dramatick Poets had corrupted all the Barbers in the Town to take the first Opportunity of cutting his Throat. His Eye-brows were grey, long, and grown to∣gether, which he knit with Indignation when any thing was spoken, insomuch that he seem'd not to have smooth'd his Forehead for many Years. His Flannel Night Cap, which was ex∣ceedingly begrim'd with Sweat and Dirt, hung upon his Left Ear; the Flap of his Breeches dangled between his Legs, and the Rolls of his Stockings fell down to his Ankles.</P>
<P>I observ'd his Room was hung with <HI>old Tape∣stry,</HI> which had several Holes in it, caus'd, as the Old Woman inform'd me, by his having cut out of it the Heads of divers <HI>Tyrants,</HI> the Fierce∣ness of whose Visages had much provoked him. On all sides of his Room were pinned a great
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
many Sheets of a Tragedy called <HI>Cato,</HI> with Notes on the Margin with his own Hand. The Words <HI>Absurd, Monstrous, Execrable,</HI> were every where written in such large Characters, that I could read them without my Spectacles. By the Fre-side lay Three-farthings-worth of Small-coal in a <HI>Spectator,</HI> and behind the Door huge Heaps of Papers of the same Title, which his Nurse inform'd me she had convey'd thither out of his sight, believing they were Books of the Black Art; for her Master never read in them, but he was either quite <HI>mop'd,</HI> or in <HI>raving Fits;</HI> There was nothing neat in the whole Room, except some Books on his Shelves very well bound and gilded, whose Names I had ne∣ver before heard of, nor I believe are any where else to be found; such as <HI>Gibraltar, a Comedy; Remarks on Prince Arthur; the Grounds of Criticism in Poetry; an Essay on publick Spirit.</HI> The only one I had any Knowledge of was a <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> interleav'd. The whole Floor was cover'd with Manuscripts, as thick as a Past∣ry Cook's Shop on a Christmas Eve. On his Table were some Ends of Verse and of Candles; a Gallipot of Ink with a yellow Pen in it, and a Pot of half-dead Ale cover'd with a <HI>Longinus.</HI></P>
<P>As I was casting my Eyes round on all this odd Furniture with some Earnestness and Asto∣nishment, and in a profound Silence, I was on a sudden surpriz'd to hear the Man speak in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Beware, Doctor, that it fare not with you as with your Predecessor the famous <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> whom the mistaken Citizens of <HI>Abdera</HI> sent
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
for in this very manner to cure the Philoso∣pher <HI>Democritus;</HI> he return'd full of Admi∣ration at the Wisdom of that Person whom he had suppos'd a Lunatic. Behold, Doctor, it was thus <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself and all the great Antients spent their Days and Nights, wrapt up in Criticism, and beset all around with their own Writings. As for me, whom you see in the same manner, be assur'd I have none other Disease than a Swelling in my Legs, whereof I say no more, since your Art may further cer∣tify you."</Q></P>
<P>I began now to be in hopes that his Case had been misrepresented, and that he was not so far gone, but some timely Medicines might recover him. I therefore proceeded to the proper Que∣ries, which with the Answers made to me, I shall set down in Form of Dialogue, in the very Words they were spoken, because I would not omit the least Circumstance in this Narrative; and I call my Conscience to witness, as if upon Oath, that I shall tell the Truth without addi∣tion or diminution.</P>

<P>Sir, I shall order you the cold Bath to morrow—Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> you are a sensible Man; pray send for Mr. <HI>Verdier</HI>'s Servant, and as you are a friend to the Patient, be so kind as to stay this Evening whilst he is cupp'd on the Head. The Symptoms of his Madness seem to be desperate; for <HI>Avicen</HI> says, that if Learn∣ing be mix'd with a Brain that is not of a Con∣texture fit to receive it, the Brain ferments till it be totally exhausted.

See <HI>Longinus</HI> in my right Hand, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> in my left; I am the only Man among the Moderns that sup∣port them. Am I to be assassinated; and shall a Bookseller, who hath liv'd upon my Labours, take away that Life to which he owes his Sup∣port?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your Leave, Gentlemen, I appre∣hend you not. I must not see my Friend ill
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
treated; he is no more affected with Lunacy than my self: I am also of the same Opinion as to the <HI>Peripaetia</HI>—Sir, by the Gravity of your Countenance and Habit, I would conceive you to be a graduate Physician; but by your indecent and boisterous Treatment of this Man of Learning, I perceive you are a violent sort of <HI>Person,</HI> I am loath to say <HI>Quack,</HI> who rather than his Drugs should lie upon his own Hands, would get rid of them, by cramming them into the Mouths of others: The Gentleman is of good Condition, sound Intellectuals, and uner∣ring Judgment: I beg you will not oblige me to resent these Proceedings.</P>
</SP>
<P>THESE were all the Words that pass'd a∣mong us at this Time; nor was there need for more, it being necessary we should make use of Force in the Cure of my Patient.</P>
<P>I privately whisper'd the old Woman to go to Mr. <HI>Verdier</HI>'s in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> with Orders to come immediately with Cupping Glasses; in the mean time, by the Assistance of Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> we lock'd his Friend into a Closet, (who 'tis plain from his last Speech was likewise touch'd in his Intellects) after which we bound our Lunatick Hand and Foot down to the Bedsted, where he continued in violent Ravings, notwithstanding the most tender Expressions we could use to per∣swade him to submit to the Operation, till the Servant of <HI>Verdier</HI> arrived. He had no sooner clapp'd half a dozen Cupping Glasses on his Head, and behind his Ears, but the Gentleman above∣mention'd bursting open the Closet, ran furious∣ly
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
upon us, cut Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI>'s Bandages, and let drive at us with a vast Folio, which sorely bruis'd the Shin of Mr. <HI>Lintott;</HI> Mr. <HI>John D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI> also starting up with the Cupping Glasses on his Head, seized another Folio, and with the same dangerously wounded me in the Skull, just above my right Temple. The Truth of this Fact Mr. <HI>Verdier</HI>'s Servant is ready to attest upon Oath, who, taking an exact Survey of the Vo∣lumes, found that which wounded my Head to be <HI>Gruterus</HI>'s <HI>Lampas Critica,</HI> and that which broke Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s Shin was <HI>Scaliger's Poetices.</HI> After this, Mr. <HI>John D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI> strengthen'd at once by Rage and Madness, snatch'd up a Peruke-Block, that stood by the Bedside, and weilded it round in so furious a Manner, that he broke three of the Cupping Glasses from the Crown of his Head, so that much Blood trickled down his Visage—He look'd so ghastly, and his Passion was grown to such a prodigious Height, that my self, Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> and <HI>Verdier</HI>'s Servant were o∣blig'd to leave the Room in all the Expedition imaginable.</P>
<P>I took Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> home with me, in order to have our Wounds drest, and laid hold of that Opportunity of entering into Discourse with him about the Madness of this Person, of whom he gave me the following remarkable Relation:</P>
<P>That on the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> 1712, between the Hours of 10 and 11 in the Morning, Mr. <HI>John D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI> enter'd into his Shop, and opening one of the Volumes of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> in the large Paper, did suddenly, without the least Provocation, tear out that of No—where the Author treats
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
of Poetical Justice, and cast it into the Street. That the said Mr. <HI>John D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>is</HI> on the 27<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> 1712, finding on the said Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s Counter a Book called an <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> just then publish'd, he read a Page or two with much Frowning, till coming to these two Lines;
<Q><L>Some have at first for Wits, then Poets past,</L>
<L>Turn'd Ctiticks next, and prov'd plain Fools at last.</L></Q>
He flung down the Book in a terrible Fury, and cried out, <HI>By G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d he means Me.</HI></P>
<P>That being in his Company on a certain Time, when <HI>Shakespear</HI> was mention'd as of a contrary Opinion to Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> he swore the said <HI>Shake∣spear</HI> was a <HI>Rascal,</HI> with other defamatory Ex∣pressions, which gave Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> a very ill Opi∣nion of the said <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>
<P>That about two Months since, he came again into the Shop, and cast several suspicious Looks on a Gentleman that stood by him, after which he desired some Information concerning that Per∣son. He was no sooner acquainted that the Gen∣tleman was a new Author, and that his first Piece was to be publish'd in a few Days, but he drew his Sword upon him, and had not my Servant luckily catch'd him by the Sleeve, I might have lost one Author upon the spot, and another the next Sessions.</P>
<P>Upon recollecting all these Circumstances, Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> was entirely of Opinion, that he had been mad for some Time; and I doubt not but this whole Narrative must sufficiently con∣vince
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
the World of the excess of his Frenzy. It now remains, that I give the Reasons which obliged me in my own Vindication to publish this whole unfortunate Transaction.</P>

<HEAD>A full and true ACCOUNT OF A Horrid and Barbarous REVENGE by POISON, On the Body of Mr. <HI>EDMUND CURLL,</HI> Bookseller; With a faithful COPY of his Last WILL and TESTAMENT</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY furnishes us with Examples of many Satyrical <HI>Authors</HI> who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge, but not of any <HI>Booksellers</HI> that I know of, ex∣cept the unfortunate Subject of the following Paper; I mean Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> at the <HI>Bible</HI> and <HI>Dial</HI> in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> who was yesterday poi∣son'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> after having liv'd many Years
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
an Instance of the mild Temper of the <HI>British</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Every Body knows that the said Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th Instant, publish'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <HI>Court Poems,</HI> in the Preface whereof they were attributed to a Lady of Quality, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Gay;</HI> by which indis∣creet Method though he had escap'd one Revenge, there were still two behind in reserve.</P>
<P>Now on the <HI>Wednesday</HI> ensuing, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven, Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> a neigh∣b'ring Bookseller, desired a Conference with Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> about settling a <HI>Title-Page,</HI> inviting him at the same Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> (who is not the only Instance how Per∣sons of bright Parts may be carry'd away by the Instigation of the Devil) found Means to con∣vey himself into the same Room, under Pretence of Business with Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> who it seems is the Printer of his <HI>Homer.</HI> This Gentleman with a seeming Coolness, reprimanded Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> for wrongfully ascribing to him the aforesaid Poems: He excused himself by declaring that one of his Authors (Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> by Name) gave the Copies to the Press, and wrote the <HI>Pre∣face.</HI> Upon this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (being to all appea∣rance reconcil'd) very civily drank a Glass of Sack to Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> which he as civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taste diffe∣red not from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer felt soon after, that some poisonous Drug had been secretly in∣fused therein.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22"/>
About eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife observing his Colour chang'd, said, <HI>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Bloody Sick;</HI> and incontinently fell a vomiting and straining in an uncommon and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as green as Grass. His Wife had been just read∣ing a Book of her Husband's printing concern∣ing <HI>Jane Wenham,</HI> the famous Witch of <HI>Hert∣ford,</HI> and her Mind misgave her that he was <HI>be∣witch'd;</HI> but he soon let her know that he sus∣pected Poison, and recounted to her, between the Intervals of his Yawnings and Reachings, every Circumstance of his Interview with Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> in the mean time coming in, was extreamly affrighted at the sudden Alteration he observ'd in Him: <HI>Brother</HI> Curll, says he, <HI>I fear you have got the Vomiting Distemper; which (I have heard) kills in half an Hour. This comes from your not following my Advice, to drink old Hock in a Morning, as I do, and abstain from Sack,</HI> Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> reply'd in a moving Tone, <HI>Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Business, Z<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ds,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Lintott, my Author!—Why did not you drink old Hock?</HI> Notwithstanding which rough Remonstrance, he did in the most friendly Manner press him to take warm Water; but Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> did with great Obstinacy refuse it; which made Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> Infer, that he chose to die, as thinking to recover greater Damages.</P>
<P>All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd vio∣lently, with accute Pains in the lower Belly. <HI>Brother</HI> Lintott, says he, <HI>I perceive my last Hour</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
<HI>approaching; do me the friendly Office to call my Partner, Mr.</HI> Pemberton, <HI>that we may settle our Worldly Affairs.</HI> Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> like a kind Neigh∣bour was hastening out of the Room, while Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> rav'd aloud in this manner: <HI>If I survive this, I will be reveng'd on</HI> Tonson; <HI>it was he first detected me as the Printer of these Poems, and I will reprint these very Poems in his Name.</HI> His Wife admonish'd him not to think of Re∣venge, but to take care of his Stock and his Soul: And in the same Instant, Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> (whose Goodness can never be enough applauded) re∣turn'd with Mr. <HI>Pemberton.</HI> After some Tears jointly shed by these humane Booksellers, Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> being (as he said) in his perfect Senses though in great bodily Pain, immediately pro∣ceeded to make a verbal Will (Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI> having first put on his Night-Cap) in the following Ma nner.</P>
<P>GEntlemen, in the first Place, I do sincerely pray Forgiveness for those indirect Me∣thods I have pursued in inventing new Titles to old Books, putting Authors Names to things they never saw, publishing private Quarrels for pub∣lick Entertainment; all which, I hope will be pardoned, as being done to get an honest liveli∣hood.</P>
<P>I do also heartily beg Pardon of all Persons of Honour, Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Gentry, Burgesses, and Commonalty, to whose Abuse I have any or every way contributed by my Pub∣lications, particularly, I hope it will be con∣sider'd,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
that if I have vilify'd his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> I have likewise aspers'd the late Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> if I have abused the honourable Mr. <HI>Walpole,</HI> I have also libell'd the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke?</HI> so that I have preserv'd that <HI>Equality</HI> and <HI>Impartiality</HI> which becomes an <HI>honest Man</HI> in Times of Faction and Di∣vision.</P>
<P>I call my Conscience to witness, that many of these Things which may seem malicious were done out of <HI>Charity;</HI> I having made it wholly my business to print for poor disconsolate Authors, whom all other Booksellers refuse. Only God bless Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore!</HI> you know he takes no <HI>Copy-money.</HI></P>
<P>The second Collection of Poems, which I groundlesly call'd Mr. <HI>Prior</HI>'s, will sell for No∣thing, and hath not yet paid the Charge of the Advertisements, which I was obliged to publish <HI>against him:</HI> Therefore you may as well suppress the Edition, and beg that Gentleman's pardon in the name of a dying Christian.</P>
<P>The <HI>French Cato,</HI> with the Criticism showing how superior it is to Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s, (which I wickedly ascribed to Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>) may be suppress'd at a reasonable Rate, being damnably translated.</P>
<P>I protest I have no Animosity to Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI> having printed part of <HI>Callipaedia,</HI> and an incor∣rect Edition of his Poems without his Leave, in Quarto. Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI>'s <HI>Rehearsal</HI> or <HI>Bays the Younger,</HI> did more harm to me than to Mr. <HI>Rowe;</HI> though upon the Faith of an honest
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
Man, I paid him double, for abusing both him and Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven pardon me for publishing the <HI>Trials of Sodomy</HI> in an <HI>Elzevir</HI> Letter! but I humbly hope, my printing Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>'s <HI>Essays</HI> will attone for them. I beg that you will take what remains of these last, (which is near the whole Impression, Presents excepted) and let my poor Widow have in exchange the sole Propriety of the Copy of Madam <HI>Mascranny.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>Here Mr.</HI> Pemberton <HI>interrupted, and would by no means consent to this Article, about which some Dispute might have arisen unbecoming a dying Person, if Mr.</HI> Lintott <HI>had not interposed and Mr.</HI> Curll <HI>vomited.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>What this poor unfortunate Man spoke after∣wards, was so indistinct, and in such broken Ac∣cents, (being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings) that the Reader is intreated to excuse the Confusion and Imperfection of this Account.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> I beg you to beware of the Indictment at <HI>Hicks</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> for publishing <HI>Rochester</HI>'s bawdy Poems; that Copy will other∣wise be my best Legacy to my dear Wife, and helpless Child.</P>
<P><HI>The Case of Impotence</HI> was my best Support, all the last long Vacation.</P>
<P>[<HI>In this last Paragraph Mr.</HI> Curll<HI>'s Voice grew more free, for his Vomitings abated upon his Deje∣ctions, and he spoke what follows from his Close∣stool.</HI>]</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26"/>
For the Copies of Noblemen's and Bishop's <HI>Last Wills and Testaments,</HI> I solemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpose of Defama∣tion; but meerly as I thought those Copies law∣fully purchased from <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> at <HI>One Shilling</HI> a piece. Our Trade in Wills turning to small Account, we may divide them blind∣fold.</P>
<P>For Mr. <HI>Manwaring</HI>'s <HI>Life,</HI> I ask Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI>'s Pardon: Neither <HI>His</HI> nor my Lord <HI>Hali∣fax</HI>'s Lives, though they were of service to their Country, were of any to me: But I was resol∣ved since I could not print their Works while they liv'd, to print their Lives after they were dead.</P>
<P>While he was speaking these Words Mr. <HI>Old∣mixon</HI> enter'd. <HI>Ah! Mr.</HI> Oldmixon (said poor Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>) <HI>to what a Condition have your Works reduced me! I die a Martyr to that unlucky Pre∣face. However, in these my last Moments I will be just to all Men; you shall have your third Share of the</HI> Court Poems, <HI>as was stipulated. When I am dead, where will you find</HI> another Bookseller? <HI>Your</HI> Protestant Packet <HI>might have supported you, had you writ a little less scurrilously; there is a Mean in all things.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> interrupted. Why not find <HI>another Bookseller, Brother Curll?</HI> and then took Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> aside and whisper'd him: <HI>Sir, As soon as</HI> Curll <HI>is dead, I shall be glad to talk with you over a Pint at the</HI> Devil.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> now turning to Mr <HI>Pemberton,</HI> told him, he had several <HI>Taking Title-Pages</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
that only wanted Treatises to be wrote to them; and earnestly desired that when they were writ, his Heirs might have some Share of the Profit of them.</P>
<P>After he had said this, he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He desir'd his Wife to step into the Shop for a <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> and read it by the Help of a Candle with∣out Hesitation. He clos'd the Book, fetch'd a Groan, and recommended to Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI> to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of the Parish of St. <HI>Dunstan</HI>'s, and a <HI>Week</HI>'s <HI>Wages</HI> advance to each of his Gentlemen-Authors, with some small Gratuity in particular to Mrs. <HI>Centlivre.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Man continued for some Hours with all his disconsolate Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Dissolution; when of a sudden he was surprizingly relieved by a plen∣tiful foetid Stool, which obliged them all to re∣tire out of the Room. Notwithstanding, it is judged by Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> that the Poi∣son is still latent in his Body, and will infallibly destroy him by slow Degrees, in less than a Month. It is to be hoped, the other Enemies of this wretched Stationer will not further pur∣sue their Revenge, or shorten this small Period of his miserable Life.</P>

<HEAD>A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition OF Mr. <HI>EDMUND CURLL,</HI> Bookseller.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publick is already acquainted with the Manner of Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Impoison∣ment, by a faithful tho' unpolite Histo∣rian of <HI>Grubstreet.</HI> I am but the Continuer of his History; yet I hope a due Distinction will be made between an undignify'd Scribler of a Sheet and half, and the Author of a Three∣penny stitch'd Book, like my self.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackmore</HI>'s <HI>Essays,</HI> Vol. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Wit</HI> (saith Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>) <HI>proceeds from a Concurrence of regular and exalted Fer∣ments, and an Affluence of Animal Spirits recti∣fy'd and refin'd to a Degree of Purity.</HI> On the contrary, when the igneous Particles rise with the vital Liquor, they produce an abstra∣ction
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
of the rational Part of the Soul, which we commonly call <HI>Madness.</HI> The Verity of this Hypothesis, is justify'd by the Symptoms with which the unfortunate Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> Bookseller, hath been afficted ever since his swallowing the Poison at the <HI>Swan</HI> Tavern in <HI>Fleetstreet.</HI> For tho' the <HI>Neck</HI> of his <HI>Retort,</HI> which carries up the Animal Spirits to the Head, is of an extraordinary length; yet the said Ani∣mal Spirits rise muddy, being contaminated with the inflammable Particles of this uncommon Poison.</P>
<P>The Symptoms of his Departure from his usual Temper of Mind, were at first only <HI>speak∣ing civilly to his Customers, singeing a Pig with a new purchased Libel,</HI> and <HI>refusing Two-and-Nine-Pence for Sir</HI> Richard Blackmore<HI>'s Es∣says.</HI></P>
<P>As the poor Man's Frenzy encreas'd, he be∣gan to <HI>void his Excrements in his Bed, read</HI> Rochester<HI>'s bawdy Poems to his Wife,</HI> gave <HI>Old∣mixon</HI> a <HI>slap</HI> on the <HI>Chops,</HI> and wou'd have kiss'd Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>by Violence.</HI></P>
<P>But at last he came to such a pass, that he wou'd <HI>dine upon nothing but Copper-Plates,</HI> took a <HI>Clyster for a whipt Syllabub,</HI> and made Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> eat a <HI>Suppository</HI> for a <HI>Raddish</HI> with <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Butter.</HI></P>
<P>We leave it to every tender Wife to imagine, how sorely all this afflicted poor Mrs. <HI>Curll:</HI> At first she privately put a <HI>Bill</HI> into several Churches, desiring Prayers of the Congregation for a <HI>wretched Stationer</HI> distemper'd in Mind. But when she was sadly convinc'd that his Mis∣fortune
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
was publick to all the World, she writ the following Letter to her good Neighbour Mr. <HI>Lintott.</HI>

<P>YOU, and all the Neighbours know too well, the Frenzy with which my poor Man is visited.

Alas! this is the greatest Adversity that ever befel my poor Man, since he lost <HI>one Testicle</HI> at School by the bite of a black Boar. Good Lord! if he should die, where should I dis∣pose of the <HI>Stock?</HI> unless Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> or you would help a distressed Widow; for God knows he never publshed any Books that lasted above a Week, so that if we wanted <HI>daily Books,</HI> we wanted <HI>daily Bread.</HI> I can write no more, for I hear the Rap of Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s <HI>Ivory-headed Cane</HI> upon the Counter.—Pray recommend me to your <HI>Pastry-Cook,</HI> (who furnishes you yearly with Tarts in ex∣change for your Papers) for Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> has disoblig'd ours, since his Fits came upon him;—before that, we generally liv'd upon bak'd Meats.—He is coming in, and I have but just time to put his <HI>Son</HI> out of the way for

<P>All these Gentlemen appear'd at the Hour ap∣pointed, in Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Dining Room, two ex∣cepted; one of whom was the Gentleman in the Cockloft, his Landlady being out of the way, and the <HI>Gradus ad Parnassum</HI> taken down; the other happened to be too closely watch'd by the Bailiffs.</P>
<P>They no sooner enter'd the Room, but all of them shew'd in their Behaviour some <HI>Su∣spicion</HI> of each other; some turning away their Heads with an Air of Contempt; others squint∣ing with a Leer that shew'd at once <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Indignation,</HI> each with a haggard abstracted Mien, the lively Picture of <HI>Scorn, Solitude,</HI> and <HI>short Commons.</HI> So when a Keeper feeds his hungry Charge of Vultures, Panthers, and of <HI>Lybian</HI> Leopards, each eyes his Fellow with a siery Glare: High hung, the bloody Liver tempts their Maw.

Snow, for poor Grain of Oat, or Tare, or Bar∣ley. Such Looks shot through the Room trans∣verse, oblique, direct; such was the stir and din, 'till <HI>Curll</HI> thus spoke, (but without rising from his Close-stool.)</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>These Resolutions being taken, the Assembly was ready to break up, but they took so near apart in Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Afflictions, that none of them could leave him without giving him some Advice to reinstate him in his Health.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI> was of opinion, That in order to drive a <HI>Pope</HI> out of his <HI>Belly,</HI> he should get the Mummy of some deceas'd <HI>Moderator</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be taken inwardly as an effectual Antidote against <HI>Anti∣christ;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> did conceive that the <HI>Liver</HI> of the Person who administred the Poison, boil'd in Broth, would be a more certain Cure.</P>
<P>While the Company were expecting the Thanks of Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> for these demonstrations of their Zeal, a whole pile of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s <HI>Essays</HI> on a sudden fell on his Head; the Shock of which in an Instant brought back his Deliri∣um. He immediately rose up, over-turn'd the Close-stool, and besh-t the <HI>Essays</HI> (which may

probably occasion a <HI>second Edition</HI>) then with∣out putting up his Breeches, in a most furious Tone he thus broke out to his Books, which his distemper'd Imagination represented to him as alive, coming down from their Shelves flutter∣ring their Leaves, and flapping their Covers at him.</P>
<P>Now <HI>G-d damn all Folio's, Quarto's, Octa∣vo's</HI> and <HI>Duodecimo's!</HI> ungrateful Varlets that you are, who have so long taken up my House without paying for your Lodging?—Are you not the beggarly Brood of fumbling <HI>Journeymen;</HI> born in <HI>Garrets,</HI> among <HI>Lice</HI> and <HI>Cobwebs,</HI> nurs'd up on <HI>Grey Peas, Bullocks Liver,</HI> and <HI>Porters Ale?</HI>—Was not the first Light you saw, the <HI>Farthing</HI> candle I paid for?

<HEAD>A Strange but True RELATION HOW <HI>EDMUND CURLL,</HI> of <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> Stationer, Out of an extraordinary Desire of Lucre, went into <HI>Change-Alley,</HI> and was converted from the Christian Religion by cer∣tain Eminent <HI>Jews:</HI> And how he was circum∣cis'd and initiated into their Mysteries.</HEAD>
<P>AVARICE (as Sir <HI>Richard</HI> in the Third Page of his Essays hath elegantly observ'd) <HI>is an inordinate Impulse of the Soul towards the amassing or heaping together a Superfluity of Wealth without the least Regard of applying it to its proper Uses.</HI></P>
<P>And how the Mind of Man is possessed with this Vice, may be seen every Day both in the City and Suburbs thereof. It has been always esteemed by <HI>Plato, Puffendorf</HI> and <HI>Socrates,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
as the darling Vice of old Age: But now our young Men are turn'd Usurers and Stock-job∣bers; and, instead of lusting after the real Wives and Daughters of our rich Citizens, they covet nothing but their Money and Estates. Strange Change of Vice! when the Concupi∣scence of Youth is converted into the Covetous∣ness of Age, and those Appetites are now be∣come VENAL which should be VENEREAL.</P>
<P>In the first Place, let us shew you how many of the ancient Worthies and Heroes of Anti∣quity have been undone and ruin'd by this Deadly Sin of Avarice.</P>
<P>I shall take the Liberty to begin with <HI>Brutus,</HI> that noble <HI>Roman.</HI> Does not <HI>Aetian</HI> inform us that he received Fifty Broad Pieces for the Assassination of that renowned Emperor <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> who fell a Sacrifice to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as Sir <HI>Edmund Bury Godfrey</HI> did to the <HI>Pa∣pists?</HI></P>
<P>Did not <HI>Themistocles</HI> let in the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into <HI>Carthage</HI> for a Sum of Money, where they barbarously put out the other Eye of the famous <HI>Hannibal?</HI> As <HI>Herodotus</HI> hath it in his ninth Book upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Medals.</P>
<P>Even the great <HI>Cato</HI> (as the late Mr. <HI>Addi∣son</HI> hath very well observ'd) though otherwise a Gentleman of good Sense, was not unsully'd by this pecuniary Contagion: For he sold <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Artaxerxes Longimanus</HI> for a hundred <HI>Rix-Dollars,</HI> which in our Money will amount to two <HI>Talents</HI> and thirty <HI>Sestertii,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Demoiver</HI>'s Calculation. <HI>See</HI> Hesiod <HI>in his</HI> 7<HI>th Chapter of</HI> Feasts <HI>and</HI> Festivals.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42"/>
Actuated by the same Diabolical Spirit of Gain, <HI>Scylla</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Consul shot <HI>Alcibiades</HI> the Senator with a Pistol, and robb'd him of several <HI>Bank Bills</HI> and <HI>Chequer Notes</HI> to an immense Value; for which he came to an un∣timely End, and was deny'd <HI>Christian</HI> Burial. Hence comes the Proverb <HI>incidat in Scyllam.</HI></P>
<P>To come near to our own Times, and give you one modern Instance (tho' well known and often quoted by Historians, <HI>viz. Echard, Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Virgil, Horace,</HI> and others) 'Tis that, I mean, of the famous <HI>God∣frey</HI> of <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> one of the great Heroes of the Holy War, who robb'd <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queen of <HI>Egypt</HI> of a Diamond Necklace, Ear-Rings, and a <HI>Tompion</HI>'s Gold Watch (which was given her by <HI>Mark Antony</HI>) all these things were found in <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s Breeches Pocket, when he was kill'd at the Seige of <HI>Damascus.</HI></P>
<P>Who then can wonder after so many great and illustrious Examples that Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll</HI> the Stationer, should renounce the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> for the <HI>Mammon</HI> of Unrighteousness, and barter his precious Faith for the filthy Pros∣pect of Lucre in the present Fluctuation of <HI>Stocks.</HI></P>
<P>It having been observed to Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> by some of his ingenious Authors, (who I fear are not over-charg'd with any Religion) what im∣mense Sums the <HI>Jews</HI> had got by <HI>Bubbles,</HI> &amp;c. he immediately turned his Mind from the Business in which he was educated, but thriv'd little, and resolv'd to quit his Shop, for <HI>Change Alley.</HI> Whereupon falling into Com∣pany
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
with the <HI>Jews</HI> at their Club at the Sign of the <HI>Cross</HI> in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> they began to tamper with him upon the most important Points of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which he for some time zealously, and <HI>like a good Christian obstinately</HI> defended. They promised him <HI>Paradise,</HI> and many other Advantages <HI>here∣after,</HI> but he artfully insinuated that he was more inclinable to listen to <HI>present</HI> Gain. They took the Hint, and promis'd him that immedi∣ately upon his Conversion to their Persuasion he should become as rich as a <HI>Jew.</HI></P>
<P>They made use likewise of several other Ar∣guments, to wit,</P>
<P>That the wisest Man that ever was, and in∣asmuch the richest, beyond all peradventure, was a <HI>Jew,</HI> videlicet <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>David</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, was a <HI>Jew</HI> also. And most of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> are suspected for holding the same Doctrine.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> at first strenuously deny'd, for indeed he thought them <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and so far was he from giving way to their Temptations, that to convince them of his <HI>Christianity</HI> he call'd for a <HI>Pork Grisking.</HI></P>
<P>They now promis'd if he would poison his Wife and give up his <HI>Grisking,</HI> that he should marry the rich <HI>Ben Meymon</HI>'s only Daughter. This made some Impression on him.</P>
<P>They then talk'd to him in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, which he not understanding, it was observ'd had very great Weight with him.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44" MS="y"/>
They, now perceiving that his <HI>Godliness</HI> was only <HI>Gain,</HI> desisted from all other Arguments, and attack'd him on his weak side, namely that of <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which <HI>John Mendez</HI> offer'd him an Eighth of an advantagious Bargain for the <HI>A∣postles Creed,</HI> which he readily and wickedly renounced.</P>
<P>He then sold the <HI>Nine and thirty Articles</HI> for a <HI>Bull;</HI> but insisted hard upon <HI>Black-Pud∣dings,</HI> being a great Lover thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Joshua Parrara</HI> engag'd to let him share with him in his <HI>Bottomrye,</HI> upon this he was persuaded out of his <HI>Christian Name;</HI> but he still adher'd to <HI>Black-Puddings.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Gideon Lopez</HI> tempted him with <HI>Forty Pound</HI> Subscription in <HI>Ram</HI>'s <HI>Bubble;</HI> for which he was content to give up the <HI>Four Evangelists,</HI> and he was now compleated a perfect <HI>Jew,</HI> all but <HI>Black-Pudding</HI> and <HI>Cir∣cumcision;</HI> for both of which he would have been glad to have had a Dispensation.</P>
<P>But on the 17th of <HI>March,</HI> Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> (un∣known to his Wife) came to the Tavern asore∣said. At his Entrance into the Room he per∣ceived a meagre Man with a sallow Counte∣nance, a black forky Beard, and long Vestment. In his Right Hand he held a large Pair of Sheers, and in his Left a red hot Searing-Iron. At Sight of this, Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Heart trembled within him, and feign would he retire; but he was prevented by six Jews, who laid Hands upon him, and unbuttoning his Breeches
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
threw him upon the Table, a pale pitiful Spectacle.</P>
<P>He now intreated them in the most moving Tone of Voice to dispense with that <HI>unmanly</HI> Ceremonial, which if they would consent to, he faithfully promis'd that he would eat a Quarter of <HI>Paschal Lamb</HI> with them the next <HI>Sunday</HI> following.</P>
<P>All these Protestations availed him nothing, for they threatned him that all Contracts and Bargains should be void unless he would submit to bear all the <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>visible</HI> Signs of <HI>Judaism.</HI></P>
<P>Our Apostate hearing this, stretched himself upon his Back, spread his Legs, and waited for the Operation; but when he saw the High-Priest take up the <HI>Cleft Stick,</HI> he roared most unmercifully, and swore several Christian Oaths, for which the <HI>Jews</HI> rebuked him.</P>
<P>The Savour of the <HI>Effluvia</HI> that issued from him, convinced the Old <HI>Levite</HI> and all his Assistants that he needed no present <HI>Purgation,</HI> wherefore without farther <HI>anointing</HI> him he proceeded in his Office; when by an unfortunate Jerk upward of the impatient Victim, he lost five times as much as ever Jew did before,</P>
<P>They finding that he was too much circum∣cis'd, which by the <HI>Levitical Law</HI> is worse than not being circumcis'd at all, refused to stand to any of their Contracts: Wherefore they cast him forth from their Synagogue; and he now remains a most piteous, woful and misera∣ble Sight at the Sign of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and <HI>Dial</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> his Wife, (poor Woman)
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
is at this Hour lamenting over him, wringing her hands and tearing her Hair; for the bar∣barous Jews still keep, and expose at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s and <HI>Garraway</HI>'s, the Memorial of her Loss, and her Husband's Indignity.</P>

<HEAD>GOD's Revenge AGAINST PUNNING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the miserable Fates of Persons addicted to this Crying Sin, in Court and Town.</HEAD>
<P>MAnifold have been the Judgments which Heav'n from Time to Time, for the Chastisement of a Sinful People, has inflicted on whole Nations. For when the Degeneracy becomes Common, 'tis but Just the Punishment should be General: Of this kind, in our own unfortunate Country, was that destructive Pe∣stilence, whose Mortality was so fatal, as to sweep away, if Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> may be believ'd, Five Millions of Christian Souls, besides Women and Jews.</P>
<P>Such also was that dreadful Conflagration en∣suing, in this famous metropolis of <HI>London,</HI> which consumed, according to the Computation of Sir <HI>Samuel Morland,</HI> 100000 Houses, not to mention Churches and Stables.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48"/>
Scarce had this Unhappy Nation recover'd these Funest Disasters, when the Abomination of Play-houses rose up in this Land: From hence hath an Inundation of Obscenity flow'd from the Court and overspread the Kingdom: Even Infants disfigured the Walls of holy Tem∣ples with exorbitant Representations of the Mem∣bers of Generation; nay, no sooner had they learnt to Spell, but they had Wickedness enough to Write the Names thereof in large Capitals: an Enormity, observ'd by Travellers to be found in no Country but <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But when Whoring and Popery were driven hence by the Happy <HI>Revolution;</HI> still the Na∣tion so greatly offended, that <HI>Socinianism, Ari∣anism</HI> and <HI>Whistonism</HI> triumph'd in our Streets, and were in a manner become Universal.</P>
<P>And yet still, after all these Visitations, it has pleased Heaven to visit us with a Contagi∣on more Epidemical, and of consequence more Fatal: This was foretold to us, First, by that unparallel'd Eclipse in 1714: Secondly, By the dreadful Coruscation in the Air this present Year: And Thirdly, By the Nine Comets seen at once over <HI>Soho-Square,</HI> by Mrs. <HI>Katherine Wadlington,</HI> and Others; a Contagion that first crept in amongst the First Quality, descended to their Footman, and infused it self into their Ladies: I mean the woful Practice of PUN∣NING. This does occasion the Corruption of our Language, and therein of the Word of God translated into our Language, which cer∣tainly every sober Christian must Tremble at.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49"/>
Now such is the Enormity of this Abomina∣tion, that our very Nobles not only commit <HI>Punning</HI> over Tea, and in Taverns, but even on the <HI>Lord</HI>'s-<HI>Day,</HI> and in the King's Chappel: Therefore to deter Men from this evil Practice, I shall give some True and Dreadful Examples of God's Revenge against <HI>Punsters.</HI></P>
<P>The Right Honourable <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (but it is not safe to insert the Name of an eminent Nobleman in this Paper, yet I will venture to say that such a one has been <HI>seen;</HI> which is all we can say, considering the largeness of his Sleeves:) This young Nobleman was not only a flagitious <HI>Pun∣ster</HI> himself, but was accessary to the Punning of others, by Consent, by Provocation, by Conni∣vance, and by Defence of the Evil committed; for which the Lord mercifully spared his Neck, but as a Mark of Reprobation <HI>wryed his Nose.</HI></P>
<P>Another Nobleman of great Hopes, no less guilty of the same Crime, was made the Pu∣nisher of himself with his own Hand, in the Loss of 500 Pounds at Box and Dice; whereby this unfortunate young Gentleman incurr'd the heavy Displeasure of his aged Grand-mother.</P>
<P>A Third of no less illustrious Extraction, for the same Vice, was permitted to fall into the Arms of a <HI>Dalilah,</HI> who may one day cut off his curious Hair, and deliver him up to the <HI>Philistines.</HI></P>
<P>Colonel <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> an ancient Gentleman of grave Deportment, gave into this Sin so early in his Youth, that whenever his Tongue endea∣vours

<P>One <HI>Samuel</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> for his forward At∣tempt to <HI>Pun,</HI> was stunted in his Stature, and hath been visited all his Life after with Bulls and Blunders.</P>
<P><HI>George Simmons,</HI> Shoe-maker at <HI>Turnstile</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> was so given to this Custom, and did it with so much Success, that his Neighbours gave out he was a Wit.

<HEAD>THE WONDERFUL WONDER of WONDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a certain Person lately arrived at this City, whom it is very proper the World should be informed of. His Character may, perhaps, be thought very Inconsistent, Improbable, and Unnatural; however I in∣tend to draw it with the utmost Regard to Truth. This I am the better qualified to do, because he is a sort of <HI>Dependant</HI> upon our Family, and <HI>almost</HI> of the same <HI>Age;</HI> tho' I cannot directly say, I have ever <HI>secn</HI> him. He is a Native of this Country, and hath lived long among us, but what appears wonderful, and hardly credible, was never seen <HI>before,</HI> by any Mortal.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, he always chuses the <HI>lowest</HI> Place in Company, and contrives it so, to keep <HI>out of Sight.</HI> It is reported, however, that in his younger Days he was frequently <HI>exposed</HI> to <HI>View,</HI> but always against his Will, and was sure to <HI>smart</HI> for it.</P>
<P>As to his Family, he came into the World a Younger Brother, being of <HI>six</HI> Children, the
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
<HI>fourth</HI> in order of (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N1">1</REF>) Birth; of which the eldest is now <HI>Head</HI> of the House, the second and third carry <HI>Arms:</HI> but the two Youngest are only <HI>Footmen:</HI> Some indeed, add, that he hath like∣wise a Twin-Brother, who lives <HI>over-against</HI> him, and keeps a (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N2">2</REF>) <HI>Victualling-House:</HI> He has the Reputation to be a <HI>close, griping, squeezing</HI> Fellow; and that when his Bags are <HI>full,</HI> he is often <HI>Needy;</HI> yet, when the Fit takes him, as fast as he gets, he <HI>lets it fly.</HI></P>
<P>When in <HI>Office,</HI> no one <HI>dischargeth</HI> himself, or <HI>does his Business</HI> better. He hath some∣times <HI>strained hard</HI> for an Honest Livelihood, and never got a <HI>Bit,</HI> till every Body else had <HI>done.</HI></P>
<P>One Practice appears very blameable in him, that every Morning he privately frequents <HI>unclean Houses,</HI> where any modest Person would blush to be seen. And altho' this be generally known, yet the World, as Censorious as it is, is so kind to overlook this Infirmity in him. To deal Im∣partially, it must be granted, that he is too great a Lover of himself, and very often consults his own <HI>Ease</HI> at the Expence of his best Friends. But this is one of his <HI>blind-Sides;</HI> and the best of Men I fear are not without <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>He hath been constituted by the <HI>higher</HI> Pow∣ers in the Station of <HI>Receiver-General,</HI> in which Employment some have censured him for play∣ing <HI>fast</HI> and <HI>loose.</HI> He is likewise <HI>Overseer</HI> of the <HI>Golden Mines,</HI> which he daily inspects when his Health will permit him.</P>
<P>He was long bred under a (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N3">3</REF>) <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> who instilled good <HI>Principles</HI> in him, but these
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
were soon <HI>Corrupted.</HI> I know not whether this deserves mention, that he is so very Capricious, as to take it for an equal Affront to talk either of <HI>kissing</HI> or <HI>kicking</HI> him, which hath occasion'd a Thousand Quarrels: However no body was ever so great a Sufferer for Faults which he nei∣ther was, nor possibly could be guilty of.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Religion</HI> he has thus much of the Qua∣ker, that he stands <HI>always covered,</HI> even in the Presence of the King; in most other Points, a perfect (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P53N4">4</REF>) <HI>Idolater,</HI> altho' he endeavours to <HI>conceal</HI> it; for he is known to offer daily Sacri∣fices to certain <HI>Subterraneous Nymphs,</HI> whom he worships in an <HI>humble Posture, prone on his Face,</HI> and <HI>stript stark Naked,</HI> and so leaves his <HI>Offerings behind him,</HI> which the (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P53N5">5</REF>) <HI>Priests</HI> of those Goddesses are careful enough to remove upon certain Seasons, with the utmost Privacy at <HI>Midnight,</HI> and from thence maintain'd them∣selves and Families. In all <HI>urgent Necessities</HI> and <HI>Pressures</HI> he applies himself to these Deities, and sometimes even in the <HI>Streets</HI> and <HI>High-ways,</HI> from an <HI>Opinion</HI> that those Powers have an In∣fluence in all Places, altho' their peculiar Resi∣dence is in Caverns under Ground. Upon these <HI>Occasions</HI> the fairest Ladies will not refuse to <HI>lend</HI> their <HI>Hands</HI> to assist him: For, altho' they are asham'd to have him <HI>seen</HI> in their Company, or even so much as to hear him <HI>Named;</HI> yet it is well known, that he is one of their <HI>constant Followers.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Politicks,</HI> he always submits to what is <HI>uppermost,</HI> but he peruses Pamphlets <HI>on both</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
<HI>Sides</HI> with great Impartiality, tho' seldom till <HI>every Body else have done with them.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Learning</HI> is of a mixed kind, and he may properly be called a <HI>Helluo librorum,</HI> or another <HI>Jacobus de Voragine:</HI> tho' his Studies are chiefly confined to <HI>School-men, Commentators,</HI> and <HI>Ger∣man Divines,</HI> together with <HI>Modern Poetry</HI> and <HI>Criticks:</HI> And he is an <HI>Atomick</HI> Philosopher, strongly maintaining a <HI>Void</HI> in <HI>Nature,</HI> which he seems to have fairly proved by many <HI>Ex∣periments.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now proceed to describe some peculiar Qualities, which in several Instances seem to distinguish this Person from the common Race of other Mortals.</P>
<P>His <HI>Grandfather</HI> was a Member of the <HI>Rump</HI> Parliament, as the <HI>Grandson</HI> is of the <HI>Present,</HI> where he often <HI>rises,</HI> sometimes <HI>grumbles</HI> but never <HI>speaks.</HI> However, he lets nothing pass <HI>willingly,</HI> but what is <HI>well digested.</HI> His Cou∣rage is indisputable, for he will take the boldest Man alive <HI>by the Nose.</HI></P>
<P>He is generally the <HI>first a Bed</HI> in the Family, and the <HI>last up,</HI> which is to be lamented, because when he happens to <HI>rise before</HI> the rest, it hath been thought to forebode some <HI>good Fortune to his Superiors.</HI></P>
<P>As Wisdom is acquired by Age, so by every new (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P54N6">6</REF>) <HI>Wrinkle</HI> in his <HI>Face,</HI> he is reported to gain some <HI>new Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>In him we may observe the true Effects and Consequences of <HI>Tyranny</HI> in a State: For, as he is a great <HI>Oppressor</HI> of all <HI>below</HI> him, so there is no Body more <HI>oppressed</HI> by those <HI>above</HI> him:
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
Yet in this Time, he hath been so highly in Favour, that many <HI>Illustrious Persons</HI> have been entirely indebted to <HI>him</HI> for their <HI>Prefer∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>He hath discovered from his own Experience the true <HI>Point</HI> wherein all human Actions, Pro∣jects, and Designs do chiefly <HI>terminate;</HI> and how <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>sordid</HI> they are <HI>at the Bottom.</HI></P>
<P>It behoves the Publick to keep him <HI>quiet,</HI> for his <HI>frequent Murmurs</HI> are a certain Sign of <HI>intestine</HI> Tumults.</P>
<P>No Philosopher ever lamented more the Lu∣xury, for which these Nations are so justly taxed; it hath been known to cost him (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P55N7">7</REF>) <HI>Tears of Blood:</HI> For in his own Nature he is far from being <HI>Profuse,</HI> tho' indeed, he never stays a Night at a Gentleman's House without <HI>leaving something behind him.</HI></P>
<P>He receives with g eat Submission whatever his Patrons think fit to give him; and when they lay <HI>heavy Burthens</HI> upon him, which is fre∣quently enough, he gets rid of them as soon as he can; but not without <HI>some Labour</HI> and <HI>much Grumbling.</HI></P>
<P>He is a perpetual <HI>Hanger-on;</HI> yet no Body knows how to be <HI>without him.</HI> He patiently fuffers himself to be <HI>kept under,</HI> but loves to be well used, and in that Case will sacrifice his <HI>Vitals</HI> to give you <HI>Ease;</HI> and he has hardly one Aquaintance for whom he hath not been <HI>Bound;</HI> yet, as far as we can find, was never known to <HI>lose</HI> any thing by it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="56"/>
He is observ'd to be very (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P56N8">8</REF>) <HI>unquiet</HI> in the Company of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> in <HI>New Cloaths,</HI> or a young <HI>Coquett.</HI></P>
<P>He is, in short the Subject of much <HI>Mirth</HI> and <HI>Raillery,</HI> which he seems to take well enough, tho' it hath not been observ'd that ever any <HI>good Thing</HI> came from himself.</P>
<P>There is so general an Opinion of his Justice, that sometimes very <HI>hard Cases</HI> are left to his Decision: And while he <HI>sits</HI> upon them, he carries himself exactly <HI>even between both sides,</HI> except where some <HI>knotty Point</HI> arises, and then he is observed to <HI>lean</HI> a little to the <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Left</HI> as the <HI>Matter</HI> inclines him, but his Reasons for it are so manifest and convincing, that every Man approves them.</P>

<P>THO' I am not insensible how many Thousand Persons have been, and still are, with great Dexterity <HI>handling</HI> this Subject, and no less aware of what infinite Rheams of Paper have been <HI>laid out upon it;</HI> however in my Opinion, no Man living has <HI>touch'd</HI> it with greater Nicety, and more delicate Turns, than our Author. But be∣cause there is some intended Obscurity in this Re∣lation, and Curiosity, inquisitive of <HI>Secrets,</HI> may possibly not enter into the <HI>Bottom</HI> and <HI>Depth</HI> of the Subject, 'twas thought not improper to take off the Veil, and gain the Reader's Favour by in∣larging his <HI>Insight.

<HEAD>THE WONDER Of all the Wonders, that ever the World won∣der'd at.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For all Persons of Quality and Others.</HEAD>
<P>NEWLY arriv'd at this City the famous Artist <HI>John Emanuel Schoitz,</HI> who to the great Surprize and Satisfaction of all Spe∣ctators, is ready to do the following Wonderful Performances, the like before never seen in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>He will heat a Bar of Iron red hot, and thrust it into a barrel of Gunpowder before all the Company, and yet it shall not take fire.</P>
<P>He lets any Gentleman charge a Blunderbuss, with the same Gunpowder, and twelve Leaden Bullets, which Blunderbuss the said Artist dis∣charges full in the Face of the said Company, without the least hurt, the Bullets sticking in the Wall behind them.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
He takes any Gentleman's own Sword, and runs it through the said Gentleman's Body, so that the Point appears bloody at the back, to all the Spectators; then he takes out the Sword, wipes it clean, and returns it to the owner, who receives no manner of hurt.</P>
<P>He takes a Pot of Scalding Oyl, and throws it by great Ladles full directly at the Ladies, without spoiling their Cloaths or burning their Skins.</P>
<P>He takes any Person of Quality's Child from two Years Old to six, and lets the Child's own Father or Mother take a Pike in their Hands; then the Artist takes the Child in his Arms and tosses it upon the Point of the Pike, where it sticks to the great Satisfaction of all Spectators; and is then taken off without so much as a hole in his Coat.</P>
<P>He mounts upon a Scaffold just over the Spe∣ctators, and from thence throws down a great Quantity of large Tiles and Stones, which fall like so many Pillows, without so much as dis∣composing either Perukes or Head-dresses.</P>
<P>He takes any Person of Quality up to the said Scaffold, which Person pulls off his Shoes, and leaps nine Foot directly down on a Board prepar'd on Purpose full of sharp Spikes six Inches long, without hurting his Feet or Damaging his Stockings.</P>
<P>He places the said Board on a Chair, upon which a Lady sits down with another Lady in her Lap, while the Spikes instead of entring into the under Lady's flesh, will feel like a Velvet Cushion.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61"/>
He takes any Person of Quality's Footman, tyes a Rope about his bare Neck, and draws him up by Pullies to the Cieling, and these keeps him hanging as long as his Master or the Com∣pany pleases, the said Footman to the Wonder and Delight of all Beholders, with a Pot of Ale in one Hand and a Pipe in the other; and when he is let down, there will not appear the least Mark of the Cord about his Neck.</P>
<P>He bids a Lady's Maid put her finger into a Cup of clear Liquor like Water, upon which her Face and both her Hands are immediately wither'd, like an Old Woman of fourscore, her Belly swells as if she were in a Week of her Time, and her Legs are as thick as Mill-Posts; but upon putting her finger into another Cup, she becomes as Young and Handsome as she was before.</P>
<P>He gives any Gentleman leave to drive forty Twelve-penny Nails up to the Head in a Por∣ter's backside, and then places the said Porter on a Loadstone Chair, which draws out every Nail, and the Porter feels no Pain.</P>
<P>He likewise draws the Teeth of half a Dozen Gentlemen, mixes and jumbles them in a Hat, gives any Person leave to blindfold him, and raturns each their own, and fixes them as well as ever.</P>
<P>With his Fore-finger and Thumb he thrusts several Gentlemen's and Lady's Eyes out of their Heads, without the least Pain, at which time they see an unspeakable Number of beauti∣ful Colours, and after they are entertain'd to the
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
full, he places them again in their proper Sockets, without any Damage to the sight.</P>
<P>He lets any Gentleman drink a Quart of hot melted Lead, and by a Draught of prepared Liquor, of which he takes part himself, he makes the said Lead pass through the said Gen∣tleman before all the Spectators, without any Damage: After which it is produced in a Cake to the Company.</P>
<P>With many other Wonderful Performances of Art, too tedious here to mention.</P>
<P>The said Artist has perform'd before most Kings and Princes in <HI>Europe</HI> with great Ap∣plause.</P>
<P>He Performs every Day (except <HI>Sundays</HI>) from Ten of the Clock to One in the Forenoon; and from Four till Seven in the Evening, at the New Inn in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>The first Seat a <HI>British</HI> Crown, the second a <HI>British</HI> Half-Crown, and the lowest a <HI>British</HI> Shilling.</P>

<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The MAYOR and ALDERMEN of the City of LONDON: The Humble Petition Of the <HI>Colliers, Cooks, Cook-Maids, Blacksmiths, Jackmakers, Bra∣siers,</HI> and Others.</HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT whereas certain <HI>Virtuosi</HI> Disaffe∣cted to the Government, and to the Trade and Prosperity of this Kingdom, taking upon them the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS, have pre∣sumed, by Gathering, Breaking, Folding, and Bundling-up the <HI>Sun-Beams,</HI> by the help of cer∣tain <HI>Glasses,</HI> to Make, Produce, and Kindle up several New <HI>Focus</HI>'s or Fires within these His Majesty's Dominions, and thereby to Boil, Bake, Stew, Fry and Dress all sorts of Victuals and Provisions, to Brew, Distil Spirits, Smelt Oar, and in general, to perform all the Offices of Cu∣linary Fires; and are endeavouring to procure
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
to themselves the Monopoly of this their said Invention. We beg leave humbly to represent to your Honours.</P>
<P>That such Grant or Patent will utterly Ruin and reduce to Beggery your Petitioners, their Wives, Children, Servants, and Trades on them depending; there being nothing left to them, after the said Invention, but Warming of Cellars and Dressing of Suppers in the Win∣ter-time. That the abolishing so considerable a Branch of the Coasting Trade as that of the Colliers, will destroy the <HI>Navigation</HI> of this Kingdom. That whereas the said <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> talk of making use of the <HI>Moon</HI> by Night, as of the <HI>Sun</HI> by Day, they will utterly ruin the numerous Body of <HI>Tallow-Chandlers,</HI> and impair a very considerable branch of the <HI>Revenue</HI> which arises from the <HI>Tax</HI> upon Tal∣low and Candles.</P>
<P>That the said <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> do pro∣fane the Emanations of that Glorious Luminary the <HI>Sun,</HI> which is appointed to <HI>Rule the Day,</HI> and not to <HI>Roast Mutton.</HI> And we humbly conceive, it will be found contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom, to Confine, Forestall, and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun. And whereas the said <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> have undertaken by Burning-Glasses made of Ice, to Roast an Ox upon the <HI>Thames</HI> next Winter: We conceive all such Practices to be an En∣croachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the <HI>Company</HI> of <HI>Watermen.</HI></P>
<P>That the Diversity of Exposition of the several Kitchens in this great City, whereby
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
some receive the Rays of the Sun sooner, and others later, will occasion great Irregularity as to the <HI>Time of Dining</HI> of the several Inhabi∣tants, and consequently great Uncertainty and Confusion in the dispatch of Business: And to those who, by reason of their Northern Expo∣sition, will be still forced to be at the Expences of Culinary Fires, it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to such Inequality as is in∣consistent with common Justice: And the same Inconveniency will affect <HI>Landlords</HI> in the <HI>Value</HI> of their <HI>Rents.</HI></P>
<P>That the Use of the said Glasses will oblige Cooks and Cook-maids to study Opticks and Astronomy, in order to know the due Distances of the said <HI>Focus</HI>'s or Fires, and to adjust the Po∣sition of their Glasses to the several Altitudes of the Sun, varying according to the Hours of the Day, and the Seasons of the Year; which Stu∣dies, at these years, will be highly Troublesome to the said Cooks and Cook-Maids, not to say any thing of the utter Incapacity of some of them to go through with such difficult Arts; or (which is still a greater Inconvenience) it will throw the whole Art of <HI>Cookery</HI> into the Hands of Astronomers and Glass-Grinders, Persons ut∣terly unskill'd in other parts of that Profession, to the great Detriment of the <HI>Health</HI> of His Ma∣jesty's good Subjects.</P>
<P>That it is known by Experience, That Meat Roasted with Sun-Beams is extreamly unwhole∣some; witness several that have dy'd suddenly after eating the Provisions of the said <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers;</HI> forasmuch as the Sun-Beams taken
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
inwardly, render the Humours too Hot and Adust, occasion great Sweatings, and dry up the Rectual Moisture.</P>
<P>That Sun-beams taken <HI>inwardly,</HI> shed a Ma∣lignant Influence upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> by their na∣tural Tendency towards the <HI>Moon;</HI> and produce Madness and Distraction at the time of the Full Moon. That the constant use of so great Quan∣tities of this <HI>Inward Light,</HI> will occasion the Growth of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> to the Danger of the <HI>Church;</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> to the Danger of the State.</P>
<P>That the Influences of the Constellations, through which the Sun passes, will with his Beams, be convey'd into the <HI>Blood;</HI> and when the Sun is amongst the Horned Signs, may pro∣duce such a Spirit of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> as is dangerous to the Honour of your Worships Families.</P>
<P>That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other Parts of Plants, these being impregna∣ted with the Sun-Beams, may <HI>vegetate</HI> and <HI>grow</HI> in the Bowels, a Thing of more dangerous Con∣sequence to human Bodies than Breeding of Worms; and this will fall heaviest upon the Poor, who live upon Roots; and the Weak and Sickly, who live upon Barley and Rice-Gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which we are ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Physicians, That the Taste and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the worse by the said <HI>Solar Coo∣kery,</HI> the Fricasses being depriv'd of the <HI>Haut Gout</HI> they acquire by being dress'd over Char∣coal.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="67"/>
<HI>Lastly,</HI> Should it happen by an Eclipse of an extraordinary Length, that this City should be depriv'd of the Sun-Beams for several Months; how will His Majesty's Subjects subsist in the In∣terim, when common Cookery, with the Arts depending upon it, is totally lost?</P>
<P>In Consideration of these, and many other Inconveniencies, your Petitioners humbly pray, That your Honours would either to∣tally prohibit the Confining and Manufactu∣ring the <HI>Sun-Beams</HI> for any of the useful Purposes of Life, or in the ensuing Parlia∣ment procure a <HI>Tax to be laid</HI> upon them, which may answer both the Duty and Price of <HI>Coals,</HI> and which we humbly conceive cannot be less than Thirty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard Square, reserving the sole Right and Privi∣lege of the <HI>Catoptrical Cookery</HI> to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and to the Commanders and Crew of the Bomb-Vessels, under the Direction of Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI> for finding out the Lon∣gitude, who by Reason of the Remoteness of their Nations, may be reduc'd to Streights for want of Firing.</P>
<P>And we likewise beg that your Honours, as to the forementioned Points, would hear the Reverend Mr. <HI>Flamstead,</HI> who is the Legal Officer appointed by the Government to <HI>look after the Hea∣venly Luminaries,</HI> whom we have con∣stituted our Trusty and Learned Soli∣citor.</P>

<HEAD>REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of UPHOL∣DERS, against Part of the BILL, <HI>For the better Viewing, Searching and Examining Drugs, Medicines,</HI> &amp;c. 1724.</HEAD>
<P>BEING call'd upon by several Retailers and Dispensers of <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Medicines</HI> about Town, to use our Endeavours a∣gainst the Bill now depending, <HI>for Viewing,</HI> &amp;c. In regard of our common Interest, and in Gra∣titude to the said Retailers and Dispensers of Medicines (which we have always found to be very effectual) we presume to lay the following Reasons before the Publick, against the said Bill.</P>
<P>That the Company of Upholders <HI>are far from being averse to the giving of Drugs and Me∣dicines in general,</HI> provided they may be of such Qualities as we require, and administer'd by
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
such Persons in whom our Company justly repose the greatest Confidence: And provided they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and the Con∣sumption of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We beg Leave to observe, that <HI>there hath been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gentry and Citizens whom we have attended.</HI> Our Practice, which consists chiefly in outward Applications, having been always so effectual, that none of our Patients have been oblig'd to undergo a se∣cond Operation. Excepting one Gentlewoman; who, after her first Burial, having burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of posthumous Chil∣dren, her second Funeral was by us perform'd without any farther Charges to the said Husband of the deceas'd. And we humbly hope, that one single Instance of this Kind (a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be imputed to any Want of Skill, or Care, in our Company.</P>
<P>We humbly conceive, that the <HI>Power by this Bill lodged in the Censors of the College of Physi∣cians,</HI> to restrain any of His Majesty's Sub∣jects from dispensing, and well-disposed Persons from taking what Medicines they please, <HI>is a manifest Encroachment on the Liberty and Proper∣ty of the Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>As the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of Upholders, have an undisputed Right in and upon the <HI>Bodies</HI> of all and every the Sub∣jects of the Kingdom; we conceive the passing of this Bill, though not absolutely depriving them of their said Right, might keep them <HI>out</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
<HI>of Possession</HI> by unreasonable <HI>Delays,</HI> to the great Detriment of our Company and their numerous Families.</P>
<P>We hope it will be consider'd that there are Multitudes of necessitous Heirs and penurious Parents, Persons in pinching Circumstances, with numerous Families of Children, Wives that have lived long, many robust aged Women with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad Understandings, single Heirs of great Estates, whereby the Collateral Line are for ever ex∣cluded, Reversionary Patents, and Reversionary Promises of Preferments, Leases upon Single Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and that the Persons so aggrieved have no Hope of being speedily relieved any other Way, than by the dispensing of <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Medicines</HI> in the Manner they <HI>now are;</HI> Burying <HI>alive</HI> being judg'd re∣pugnant to the known Laws of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That there are many of the Deceased, who by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are carried about Town, who would have been put into our Hands long before this Time by any other well-order'd Government; By want of a due <HI>Police</HI> in this Particular, our Company have been great Sufferers.</P>
<P>That <HI>frequent Funerals</HI> contribute to preserve the Genealogies of Families and the Honours conferred by the Crown, (which are no where so well illustrated as on this solemn Occasion;) to maintain <HI>necessitous Clergy,</HI> to enable the <HI>Clerks</HI> to appear in decent Habits to officiate on <HI>Sundays,</HI> to feed the great Retinue of <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>melancholy Men</HI> who appear at the said Funerals, and who
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
must starve without constant and regular Em∣ployment. Moreover we desire it may be re∣member'd that by the passing of this Bill the No∣bility and Gentry will have their <HI>old Coaches</HI> lie upon their Hands, which are now employed by our Company.</P>
<P>And we further hope that frequent Funerals will not be discouraged (as is by this Bill pro∣posed) it being the only Method left of <HI>carrying</HI> some People to <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>We are afraid that by the Hardships of this Bill our Company will be reduced to leave their Business here, and <HI>practise at</HI> York <HI>and</HI> Bristol, <HI>where the free Use of bad Medicines will be still allowed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is therefore hoped that no specious Pretence whatsoever will be thought sufficient to introduce an Arbitrary and Unlimited Power for Peope to live</HI> (in Defiance of <HI>Art</HI>) as long as they can by the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> to the Prejudice of our Com∣pany, and the Decay of Trade.</P>
<P>That as our Company are like to suffer in some measure by the Power given to Physi∣cians to dissect the Bodies of Malefactors, we humbly hope that the Manufacture of Cases for Skeletons will be reserved solely to the Coffin∣makers.</P>
<P>We likewise humbly presume that the Inte∣rests of the several Trades and Prosessions which depend upon ours, may be regarded; such as that of Hearses, Coaches, Coffins, Epitaphs, and Bell-ropes, Stone-cutters, Feather-men and Bell∣ringers; and especially the Manusacturers of Crapes; and the Makers <HI>of Snuff,</HI> who use
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
great Quantities of old Coffins, and who, con∣sider'd in the Consumption of their Drugs, em∣ploy by far the greatest Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Annus Mirabilis:</HI> OR, The Wonderful Effects of the ap∣proaching Conjunction of the Planets <HI>Jupiter, Mars,</HI> and <HI>Saturn.</HI></HEAD>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas</L>
<L>Corpora—</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I SUPPOSE every Body is sufficiently ap∣priz'd of, and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the 29th of this Instant <HI>December,</HI> 1722, foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity, under the Name of the <HI>Annus Mirabilis,</HI> or the <HI>Metamorphostical</HI> Con∣junction; a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes, (the Effect of that Configuration of the Celestial Bodies) the human Males being to be turn'd into Females, and the human Females into Males.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74"/>
The <HI>Egyptians</HI> have represented this great Transformation by several significant Hierogly∣phicks, particularly one very remarkable. There are carv'd upon an Obelisk, a <HI>Barber</HI> and a <HI>Midwife;</HI> the Barber delivers his <HI>Ra∣zor</HI> to the Midwife, and she her <HI>Swadling Cloaths</HI> to the Barber. Accordingly <HI>Thales Milesius</HI> (who, like the rest of his Countrymen, borrow'd his Learning from the <HI>Egyptians</HI>) af∣ter having computed the Time of this famous Conjunction, <HI>Then,</HI> says he, <HI>shall Men and Wo∣men mutually exchange the Pangs of</HI> Shaving <HI>and</HI> Child-bearing.</P>
<P><HI>Anaximander</HI> modestly describes this Meta∣morphosis in mathematical Terms: <HI>Then,</HI> says he, <HI>shall the negative Quantity of the Women be turn'd into positive, their <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> into</HI> ✚; (i. e.) their <HI>Minus</HI> into <HI>Plus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> not only speaks of this great Change, but describes all the Preparations towards it. <Q REND="inline">"Long before the bodily Transformation (says he) Nature shall begin the most difficult Part of her Work, by changing the <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Inclinations</HI> of the two Sexes: Men shall turn effeminate, and Women manly; Wives shall domineer, and Husbands obey; Ladies shall <HI>ride a Horseback,</HI> dress'd like <HI>Cavaliers;</HI> Princes and Nobles appear in <HI>Night-rails</HI> and <HI>Petticoats;</HI> Men shall <HI>squeak</HI> upon Theatres with <HI>Female</HI> Voices, and Women <HI>corrupt Virgins;</HI> Men shall <HI>knot</HI> and <HI>cut Paper;</HI> and even the <HI>Northern</HI> People, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: A Phrase (which for Modesty's Sake
<PB N="75" REF="75"/>
I forbear to translate) which denotes a Vice too frequent amongst us."</Q> So far <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>That the Ministry foresaw this great Change, is plain from the Callico-Act; whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Women all over <HI>England,</HI> to convert their useless Female Habits into Beds, Window-Curtains, Chairs, and Joint-stools; <HI>undressing</HI> themselves (as it were) <HI>before their Transformation.</HI></P>
<P>The Philosophy of this Transformation will not seem surprising to People, who search into the <HI>Bottom</HI> of Things. Madam <HI>Bourignon,</HI> a devout <HI>French</HI> Lady, has shewn us, how Man was at first created Male and Female in one In∣dividual, having the Faculty of Propagation with∣in himself: A Circumstance necessary to the State of Innocence, wherein a Man's Happiness was not to depend upon the Caprice of another. It was not till after he had made a <HI>saux pas,</HI> that he had his Female Mate. Many such Trans∣formations of Individuals have been well attested; particularly one by <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and another by the late Bishop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> From all which it appears, that this System of Male and Female has already undergone, and may hereafter suffer several Alterations. Every Smatterer in Anato∣my knows, that a Woman is but an introverted Man; a new Fusion and <HI>Flatus</HI> will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity; but I forbear, (for the Sake of my <HI>Modest Men Rea∣ders,</HI> who are in a few Days to be Virgins.)</P>
<P>In some Subjects, the smallest Alterations will do: some Men are sufficiently spread about the Hips, and contriv'd with that Female Softness,

that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxom Wenches; and there are Women who are, as it were, already the <HI>Ebauche</HI> of a good sturdy Man. If Nature cou'd be puz∣zl'd, it will be how to bestow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now ap∣pear about Town, or how to roll out the short dapper Fellows into well-siz'd Women.</P>
<P>This great Conjunction will begin to operate on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 29th Instant. Accordingly, a∣bout Eight at Night, as <HI>Senezino</HI> shall begin at the Opera, <HI>Si videte, Did you but see?</HI> He shall be observed to make an <HI>unusual Motion;</HI> upon which the Audience will be affected with a <HI>red Suffusion</HI> over their Countenance: And because a strong Succession of the Muscles of the Belly is necessary towards performing this great Ope∣ration, both Sexes will be thrown into a <HI>profuse involuntary Laughter;</HI> Then (to use the modest Terms of <HI>Anaximander</HI>) <HI>shall negative Quantity be turn'd into positive,</HI> &amp;c. Time never beheld, nor will it ever assemble, such a Number of <HI>un∣touch'd Virgins</HI> within those Walls! but alas! such will be the Impatience and Curiosity of People to act in their new Capacity, that many of them will go to pot that <HI>very Night.</HI> To prevent the Disorders that may happen upon this Occasion, is the chief Design of this Paper.</P>
<P>Gentlemen have begun already to make use of this Conjunction to Compass their filthy Pur∣poses. They tell the Ladies forsooth, that it is only parting with a perishable Commodity; hard∣ly of so much Value as a Callico Under-petti∣coat,
<PB N="77" REF="77"/>
since, like its Mistress, it will be useless in the Form it is now in. If the Ladies have no Regard to the Dishonour and Immorality of the Action, I desire they will consider that Nature, who never destroys her own Productions, will exempt big-belly'd Women till the time of their Lying-in; so that not to be transform'd, will be the same as to be pregnant. If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortress that is to be demolish'd in a few Days, let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing Nine Months hence, to be brought to Bed of a Bastard; a posthumous Bastard as it were, to which the <HI>Quondam</HI> Father can be no more than a <HI>dry Nurse.</HI></P>
<P>This wonderful Transformation is the Instru∣ment of Nature, to balance Matters between the Sexes. The Cruelty of scornful Mistresses shall be return'd; The slighted Maid shall grow into an imperious Gallant, and reward her Undoer with a big Belly, and a Bastard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is hardly possible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occasion over the Face of the Earth. I long impatiently to see the Proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the Title of Succession to their Crown; this be∣ing a Case not provided for by the <HI>Salique</HI> Law. There will be no preventing Disorders amongst Friars and Monks; for certainly Vows of Cha∣stity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made. The same will hold good with Mar∣riages, tho' I think it will be a Scandal amongst Protestants for Husbands and Wives to part, since there remains still a possibility to perform the <HI>De∣bitum</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="78"/>
<HI>Conjugale</HI> by the Husbands being <HI>femme Cou∣verte.</HI> I submit it to the Judgment of the Gen∣tlemen of the Long Robe, whether this Transfor∣mation does not discharge all Suits of <HI>Rapes?</HI></P>
<P>The Pope must undergo a new groping; but the false Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> has contriv'd Matters well for his Successors; for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women, he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion.</P>
<P>These are surprizing Scenes, but I beg leave to affirm, that the solemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation, not of Ridicule; there∣fore I make it my earnest Request to the merry Fellows, and giggling Girls about Town, that they would not put themselves in a high Twitter, when they go to visit a <HI>General</HI> Lying in of his first Child; his <HI>Officers</HI> serving as Midwifes, Nur∣ses and Rockers dispensing Caudle; or if they be∣hold the <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> dressing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court, I beg they will re∣member that these Offices must be fill'd with Peo∣ple of the greatest Regularity, and best Characters. For the same Reason, I am sorry that a certain Prelate, who notwithstanding his Confinement, still preserves his healthy, chearful Countenance, cannot come in time to be a <HI>Nurse at Court,</HI></P>
<P>I likewise earnestly intreat the <HI>Maids of Ho∣nour,</HI> (then <HI>Ensigns</HI> and <HI>Captains</HI> of the <HI>Guards</HI>) that, at their first setting out, they have some Re∣gard to their former Station; and do not run wild through all the infamous Houses about Town. That the present <HI>Grooms of the Bed-Chamber</HI> (then Maids of Honour) would not eat Chalk and Lime
<PB N="79" REF="79"/>
in their Green-Sickness; and in general, that the Men would remember that they are become <HI>Re∣tremingent,</HI> and not by Inadvertency lift up against Walls and Post.</P>
<P>Petticoats will not be burdensome to the <HI>Cler∣gy;</HI> but Balls and Assemblies will be indecent for some Time.</P>
<P>As for you, Coquettes, Bawds, and Chamber∣maids, (the future <HI>Ministers, Plenipotentaries</HI> and <HI>Cabinet-Counsellors</HI> to the Princes of the Earth) manage the <HI>great Intrigues</HI> that will be committed to your Charge, with your usual Secrecy and Conduct; and the Affairs of your Master will go better than ever.</P>
<P>O ye <HI>Exchange</HI> Women! (our Right Wor∣shipful <HI>Representatives</HI> that are to be) be not so griping in the Sale of your Ware as your Predecessors, but consider that the Nation, like a spend-thrift Heir, has run out: Be likewise a little more continent in your <HI>Tongues</HI> than you are at present, else the Length of Debates will spoil your Dinners.</P>
<P>You Housewifely good Women, who now preside over the <HI>Confectionary,</HI> (henceforth <HI>Com∣missioners</HI> of the <HI>Treasury</HI>) be so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as to dis∣pence the <HI>Sugar-Plumbs</HI> of the Government with a more impartial and frugal Hand.</P>
<P>Ye Prudes and censorious old Maids, (the Hopes of the <HI>Bench</HI>) exert but your usual Talent of <HI>finding Faults,</HI> and the Laws will be strictly exe∣cuted; only I would not have you proceed upon such <HI>slender Evidences</HI> as you have done hitherto.</P>
<P>It is from you, eloquent Oyster-Merchants of <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> (just ready to be call'd to the <HI>Bar,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>
and quoif'd like your Sister-Serjeants,) that we expect the shortening the Time, and lessening the Expences of Law-Suits: For I think you are oblig'd to bring your Debates to a <HI>short Issue;</HI> and even custom will restrain you from taking the <HI>Oyster</HI> and leaving only the <HI>Shell</HI> to your Cli∣ents.</P>
<P>O ye Physicians, who in the Figure of old Wo∣men are to clean the <HI>Tripe</HI> in the Markets; scour it as effectually as you have done that of your Patients, and the Town will fare most deliciously on <HI>Saturdays.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but congratulate human Nature, up∣on this happy Transformation; the only Expedi∣ent left to restore the Liberties and Tranquility of Mankind; which is so evident, that it is al∣most an Affront to common Sense to insist upon the Proof of it. If there can be any such stupid Creature who doubts it, I desire he will make but the following obvious Reflection: There are in <HI>Europe</HI> alone, at present, about a Million of sturdy Fellows, under the Denomination of <HI>stan∣ding Forces,</HI> with Arms in their Hands: That those are Masters of the Lives, Liberties and For∣tunes of all the rest, I believe no body will deny. It is no less true in Fact, that Reams of Paper, and above a square Mile of Skins of Vel∣lum have been employ'd to no Purpose, to settle Peace amongst those Sons of Violence. Pray, who is he that will say unto them, <HI>Go and dis∣band your selves?</HI> But lo! by this Transformation it is done at once, and the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Days of pub∣lick Tranquility return. For neither the Military Temper nor Dicipline can taint the soft Sex for a
<PB N="81" REF="81"/>
whole Age to come. <HI>Bellaque matribus invisa' Wars odious now to Mothers,</HI> will not grow immediately palatable in their <HI>Paternal</HI> State.</P>
<P>Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be less in <HI>Family</HI>-Tranquility, than it is in <HI>Natio∣nal.</HI> Great Faults will be amended, and Frailties forgiven, on both Sides. A Wife who has been disturb'd with late Hours, and choak'd with the Haugoût of a Sot, will remember her Sufferings, and avoid the Temptation; and will, for the same Reason, indulge her Mate in his Female Capacity in some Passions, which she is sensible from Expe∣rience are natural to the Sex. Such as Vanity of fine Cloths, being admir'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And now tender∣ly must she use her Mate under the Breeding Qualms and Labour-Pains, which she hath felt her self? In short, all unreasonable Demands upon Husbands must cease, because they are al∣ready satisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impossible. That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World, and the Gentlemen those of their Houshold, better than either of them have hitherto done, is the hearty desire of,</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY Of the Learned MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS, Concerning the ORIGINE of SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written to the most Learned <HI>Dr.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> F. R. S. from the <HI>Deserts</HI> of <HI>NUBIA.D</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the Enquiries which have been pursu'd by the Curious and In∣quisitive, there is none more worthy the search of a Learned Head, than the Source from whence we derive those Arts and Sciences which raise us so far above the Vulgar, the Countries in which they rose, and the Channels by which they have been convey'd. As they who first brought them amongst us travell'd into the remo∣test Parts of the Earth to attain them, I may
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
boast of some advantages by the same means; since I write this from the Deserts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> from those Plains of Sand which have buried the Pride of Invading Armies, with my Foot perhaps at this instant ten Fathom over the Grave of <HI>Cambyses,</HI> a Solitude to which neither <HI>Pythagoras</HI> nor <HI>Apollonius</HI> ever penetrated.</P>
<P>It is universally agreed, that Arts and Sciences took their Rise among the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> but from whom <HI>they</HI> first receiv'd them, is yet a Secret. The highest Period of Time to which the Learned attempt to trace them, is from the be∣ginning of the <HI>Assyrian Monarchy,</HI> when their In∣ventors were worship'd as Gods. It is therefore necessary to go backward into Times even more remote, and to gain some knowledge of their Hi∣story, from whatever dark and broken Hints may any way be found in ancient Authors con∣cerning them.</P>
<P>Nor <HI>Troy</HI> nor <HI>Thebes</HI> were the first of Empires; we have mention, tho' not Histories, of an earlier warlike People call'd the <HI>Pygmaeans.</HI> I cannot but perswade my self, from those Accounts of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il.</HI> 3. Hom.</NOTE> <HI>Ho∣mer, Aristotle</HI> and others, that their History, Wars, and Revolutions were then a part of the Study of the Learned, from the very Air in which those Authors speak of them, as of things universally known. And tho' all we directly hear is of their Military Atchievements, in the brave defence of their Country from the annual Invasions of a Powerful Enemy, yet I cannot
<PB N="85" REF="85"/>
doubt but that they excell'd as much in the Arts of peaceful Government, tho' there remain no Traces of their Civil Institutions. Empires as great have been swallow'd up in the wreck of Time, and such certain Periods have been put to them, as occasion a Total Ignorance of their Story. And if I should conjecture that the like happen'd to this Nation, from a general extirpa∣tion of the People by those Flocks of Monstrous Birds, wherewith Antiquity agrees they were con∣tinually infested; it ought not to seem more in∣credible, than that one of the <HI>Baleares</HI> was wasted by Rabbits, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eustathius in Hom. <HI>II.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Smynthe</HI> by Mice, and of late <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Speede, in <HI>Bermudas.</HI></NOTE><HI>Ber∣mudas</HI> almost depopulated by Rats. Nothing is more natural to imagine, than that the few sur∣vivers of that Empire retired into the depths of their Deserts, where they liv'd undisturb'd, 'till they were found out by <HI>Osyris</HI> in his Travels to instruct Mankind.</P>
<P>He met, says <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">L. 1. ch. 18. Diod.</NOTE><HI>Diodorus,</HI> in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> a sort of <HI>little Satyrs,</HI> who were <HI>hairy one half of their Body,</HI> and whose leader <HI>Pan</HI> accompany'd him in his Expedition for the civilizing of Mankind. Now of this great Personage <HI>Pan,</HI> we have a very particular Description in the ancient Writers, who unanimously agree to represent him, <HI>shaggy Bearded, Hairy all over, half a Man,</HI> and <HI>half a Beast,</HI> and walking <HI>erect,</HI> with a <HI>Staff,</HI> (the Posture in which his race are to this Day shown among us). And since the chief thing to which he apply'd himself was the <HI>civilizing of Mankind,</HI> it should seem that the first Principles of Science
<PB N="86" REF="86"/>
must be receiv'd from this People, to whom the <HI>Gods</HI> were by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il.</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI></NOTE><HI>Homer</HI> said to resort <HI>twelve Days every Year,</HI> for the Conversation of its Wise and Just Inhabitants.</P>
<P>If from <HI>Aegypt</HI> we proceed to take a View of <HI>India,</HI> we shall find that their knowledge also de∣riv'd itself from the same Source. To that Coun∣try did these Noble Creatures accompany <HI>Bac∣chus</HI> in his Expedition, under the Conduct of <HI>Si∣lenus,</HI> who is also describ'd to us with the very same Marks and Qualifications. Mankind is ig∣norant, saith <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L. 3. ch. 69. Diod.</NOTE><HI>Diodorus,</HI> whence <HI>Silenus</HI> derived his Birth, through his great Antiquity; but he had a <HI>Tail on his Loins,</HI> as likewise had <HI>all his Progeny, in sign of their descent.</HI> Here then they settled a Colony, which to this Day subsists with the same Tails. From this time they seem to have communicated themselves only to those Men who retir'd from the Converse of their own Spe∣cies, to a more uninterrupted Life of Contempla∣tion. I am much inclin'd to believe that in the midst of those Solitudes they instituted the so much celebrated Order of <HI>Gymnosophists.</HI> For whoever observes the <HI>scene</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of their Life, will easily find them to have imitated with all exactness imaginable, the Manners and Cus∣toms of their Masters and Instructors. They are said to <HI>dwell in the thickest Woods,</HI> to <HI>go na∣ked,</HI> to suffer their Bodies to be <HI>over-run with Hair,</HI> and their <HI>Nails</HI> to grow to a <HI>prodigious length.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his first Orat. on <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Fortune.</NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> says, they eat what they could
<PB N="87" REF="87"/>
get <HI>in the Fields,</HI> their Drink was <HI>Water,</HI> and their <HI>Bed</HI> made of <HI>Leaves</HI> or <HI>Moss.</HI> And <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herod. L. 1.</NOTE><HI>He∣rodotus</HI> tells us, that they esteem'd it a great ex∣ploit to <HI>kill very many Ants, or creeping Things.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we see that the two Nations which contend for the Origine of Learning, are the same that have ever most abounded with this in∣genious Race. Tho' they have contested which was first blest with the rise of Science, yet have they conspir'd in being grateful to their common Masters. <HI>Aegypt</HI> is well known to have wor∣shipp'd them of old in their <HI>own Images:</HI> and <HI>India</HI> may be credibly suppos'd to have done the same, from that adoration which they paid in latter times to the <HI>Tooth</HI> of one of these hairy Philosophers, as it should seem in just Gratitude to the <HI>Mouth</HI> from which they receiv'd their Knowledge.</P>
<P>Pass we now over into <HI>Greece,</HI> where we find <HI>Orpheus</HI> returning out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> with the same intent as <HI>Osyris</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> made their Expedi∣tions. From this period it was, that <HI>Greece</HI> first heard the Name of <HI>Satyrs,</HI> or own'd them for <HI>Semi-dei.</HI> And hence it is surely reasonable to conclude, that he brought some of this wonderful Species along with him, who also had a leader of the line of <HI>Pan,</HI> of the same Name, and expressly call'd <HI>King</HI> by <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Theo. Id. 1<HI>st.</HI></NOTE><HI>Theocritus.</HI> If thus much be al∣low'd, we easily account for two of the strangest reports in all Antiquity. One, that the Tradi∣tion of <HI>Beasts</HI> following the Musick of <HI>Orpheus</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="88"/>
(which has been interpreted of his taming Savage Tempers) will thus have a <HI>literal Application.</HI> The other, which we most insist upon, is, that the Love which these Sages bear to the Females of our Kind affords a Solution of all those Fables of the <HI>Gods compressing Women</HI> in Woods under <HI>be∣stial appearances.</HI> I am sensible it may be obje∣cted, that they are said to have been compress'd in the Shape of different Animals; but to this we answer, that Women under such apprehen∣sions hardly know what shape they have to deal with.</P>
<P>From what has been last said, 'tis highly cre∣dible that to this ancient and generous Race the World is indebted, if not for the <HI>Heroes,</HI> at least for the acutest <HI>Wits</HI> of Antiquity. One of the most remarkable instances, is that great mimick Genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vit. Aesop. initio.</NOTE><HI>Aesop,</HI> for whose extraction from these <HI>Sylvestres Homines</HI> we may gather an Argument from <HI>Planudes,</HI> who says, that <HI>Aesop</HI> signifies the same thing as <HI>Aethiop,</HI> the Original Nation of our People. For a second Argument we may offer the description of his Person, which was <HI>short, deform'd,</HI> and almost <HI>Savage,</HI> insomuch that he might have liv'd in the Woods, had not the benevolence of his Temper made him rather adapt himself to our Manners, and come to Court in wearing Apparel. The third Proof is his a∣cute and satyrical Wit; and lastly, his great Knowledge in the <HI>Nature of Beasts,</HI> together with the natural Pleasure he took to speak of them upon all Occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89"/>
The next instance I shall produce is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Xenophon.</HI></NOTE><HI>Socrates.</HI> First, it was a Tradition that he was of an un∣common Birth from the rest of Men; Secondly, he had a Countenance confessing the Line he sprung from, being <HI>bald, flat-nos'd,</HI> with <HI>promi∣nent Eyes,</HI> and a <HI>downward look:</HI> Thirdly, he turn'd certain Fables of Aesop into Verse, proba∣bly out of his respect to Beasts in general, and love to his Family in particular.</P>
<P>In process of time, the Women, with whom these Sylvans would have lovingly cohabited, were either taught by Mankind, or induc'd by an abhorrence of their Shapes, to shun their em∣braces; so that our Sages were necessitated to mix with Beasts; This by degrees occasion'd the Hair of their Posterity to grow higher than their Mid∣dles; It arose in one Generation to their Arms, in the Second it invaded their Necks, in the Third it gain'd the ascendant of their Heads, 'till the degenerate Appearance in which the Species is now immers'd, became compleated. Tho' we must here observe, that there were a few who fell not under the common Calamity, there being some unprejudic'd Women in every Age, by vir∣tue of whom a Total extinction of the Original Race was prevented: And it is remarkable also, that even where they were mix'd, the Defection from their Nature was not intire; there still ap∣pear'd marvellous Qualities among them, as was manisest in those who follow'd <HI>Alexander</HI> in <HI>In∣dia.</HI> How did they attend his Army and survey his Order! How did they cast themselves into
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
the same forms for March or for Combat! W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> an imitation was there of all his Discipline! the ancient true remains of a warlike Disposition, and of that Constitution which they enjoy'd while they were a Monarchy.</P>
<P>To proceed to <HI>Italy:</HI> At the first Appearance of these wild Philosophers, there were some of the least mix'd, who vouchsafed to converse with Mankind; which is evident from the Name of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy.</NOTE><HI>Fauns,</HI> a <HI>fando,</HI> or <HI>speaking.</HI> Such was he who coming out of the Woods, in hatred to Tyran∣ny, encourag'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Army to proceed a∣gainst the <HI>Hetruscans</HI> who would have restor'd <HI>Tarquin.</HI> But here, as in all the Western Parts of the World, there was a great and memorable <HI>Aera</HI> in which they began to be <HI>Silent.</HI> This we may place something near the time of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> when the Number, Vanity and Folly of Human Philosophers encreas'd, by which Men's Heads became too much puzzled to receive the Wisdom of these ancient Sylvans; the Questions of that Academy were too numerous to be consistent with their ease to answer; and too intricate, ex∣travagant, idle, or pernicious, to be any other than a derision and scorn unto them. From this Period, if ever we hear of their giving Answers, it is only when <HI>caught, bound,</HI> and <HI>constrain'd,</HI> in like manner as was that Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Pro∣phet, <HI>Proteus.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly we read in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plutarch in Vit. Sylla.</NOTE><HI>Sylla</HI>'s Time, of such a Philosopher taken near <HI>Dyrrachium,</HI> who wou'd not be persuaded to give them a Lecture by all
<PB N="91" REF="91"/>
they cou'd say to him, and only shew'd his Pow∣er in <HI>Sounds</HI> by Neighing like a Horse.</P>
<P>But a more successful attempt was made in <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>'s reign by the Inquisitive Genius of the great <HI>Virgil,</HI> whom, together with <HI>Varus,</HI> the Commentators suppose to have been the true Per∣sons, who are related in the 6th Bucolick to have caught a Philosopher, and doubtless a genuine one, of the Race of the old <HI>Silenus.</HI> To prevail upon him to be communicative (of the impor∣tance of which <HI>Virgil</HI> was well aware) they not only ty'd him fast, but allur'd him likewise by making him a present of a comely Maiden call'd <HI>Aegle,</HI> which made him sing both merrily and in∣structively. In this Song we have their <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Creation,</HI> the same in all probability as was taught so many Ages before in the great <HI>Pyg∣maean</HI> Empire, and several Hieroglyphical Fables under which they couch'd or embellish'd their Morals. For which reason I look upon this Bu∣colick as an inestimable Treasure of the most an∣cient Science.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Constantine</HI> we hear of ano∣ther, taken in a Net, and brought to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> round whom the People flock'd to hear his Wis∣dom; but as <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> reporteth, he prov'd a dumb Philosopher, and only instructed by <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>The last we shall speak of who seemeth to be of the true Race, is said by St. <HI>Jerome</HI> to have met St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vit. St. Ant.</NOTE> <HI>Anthony</HI> in a Desert, who enquir∣ing the Way of him, he shew'd his under∣standing,
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
and Courtesy by pointing, but wou'd not answer, for he was a dumb Philosopher also.</P>
<P>These are all the Notices which I am at pre∣sent able to gather of the appearance of so great and learned a People in <HI>your side</HI> of the World. But if we return to their ancient native Seats, <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> we shall there find even in mo∣dern times, the Traces of their Original Conduct and Valour.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa</HI> (as we read among the indefatigable Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI>'s Collections) a Body of them whose Leader was inflam'd with Love for a Woman, by martial Powers and Stratagem won a Fort from the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>But I must leave all others at present to cele∣brate the Praise of two of their unparallel'd Mo∣narchs in <HI>India.</HI> The one was <HI>Perimal the Mag∣nificent,</HI> a Prince most Learned and Communica∣tive, to whom in <HI>Malabar</HI> their excess of Zeal dedicated a Temple, rais'd on Seven hundred Pil∣lars, not inferior in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maff. l. 1.</NOTE><HI>Maffaeus</HI>'s Opinion to those of <HI>Agrippa</HI> in the <HI>Pantheon.</HI> The other <HI>Ha∣nimant the Marvellous</HI> his Relation and Successor, whose Knowledge was so great, as made his fol∣lowers doubt if even that Wise Species cou'd ar∣rive at such Perfection; and therefore they ra∣ther imagin'd him and his Race a sort of <HI>Gods</HI> form'd into <HI>Apes.</HI> His was the <HI>Tooth</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> took in <HI>Bisnagar</HI> 1559, for which the <HI>Indians</HI> offer'd, according to <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linschot. ch. 44.</NOTE><HI>Linschotten,</HI> the immense Sum of Seven hundred thousand Ducats. Nor let me quit this Head without mentioning
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
with all due respect <HI>Oran Outang</HI> the Great, the last of this Line: whose unhappy Chance it was to fall into the Hands of <HI>Europeans. Oran Ou∣tang,</HI> whose Value was not known to us, for he was a mute Philosopher: <HI>Oran Outang,</HI> by whose dissection the Learned Dr. <HI>Tyson</HI> has added a Con∣firmation to this System, from the resemblance between the <HI>Homo Sylvestris</HI> and our <HI>Humane Bo∣dy,</HI> in those Organs by which the rational Soul is exerted.</P>
<P>We must now descend to consider this People, as sunk into the <HI>bruta Natura,</HI> by their continu∣al Commerce with Beasts. Yet even at this time, what Experiments do they not afford us of relieving some from the Spleen, and others from Imposthumes, by occasioning Laughter at pro∣per Seasons? With what readiness do they enter into the imitation of whatever is remarkable in Human Life? and what surprising Relations have <HI>Le Comte</HI> and others given of their Appe∣tites, Actions, Conceptions, Affections, Varie∣ties of Imaginations, and Abilities capable of pur∣suing them? If under their present low circum∣stances of <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Breeding,</HI> and in so short a Term of Life as is now allotted them, they so far exceed all Beasts, and equal many Men; what Prodigies may we not conceive of those, who were <HI>Nati melioribus annis,</HI> those Primitive <HI>Lon∣gaeval</HI> and <HI>Antideluvian Man-Tegers,</HI> who first taught Sciences to the World?</P>
<P>This Account, which is entirely my own, I am proud to imagine has traced Knowledge from a Fountain correspondent to several Opinions of the Ancients, tho' hitherto undiscover'd, both
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
by them and the Moderns. And now what shall I say to Mankind in the Thought of this great Discovery? What, but that they should abate of their Pride, and consider that the Authors of our Knowledge are among <HI>Beasts:</HI> That these, who were our elder Brothers by a Day in the Crea∣tion, whose Kingdom was like the Scheme of <HI>Plato</HI> govern'd by Philosophers, who flourish'd with Learning in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> are now un∣distinguish'd from, and known only by the same Appellation, as the <HI>Man-Teger,</HI> and the <HI>Monkey!</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Speech,</HI> I make no question that there are Remains of the First and less corrupted Race, in their Native Deserts, who yet have the Power of it. But the vulgar Reason given by the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that they will not speak for fear of be∣ing set to Work,"</Q> is alone a sufficient one, considering how exceedingly all other Learned Persons affect their <HI>Ease.</HI> A Second is, That these observant Creatures having been Eye-Wit∣nesses of the <HI>Cruelty</HI> with which that Nation trea∣ted their Brother <HI>Indians,</HI> find it necessary not to show themselves to be <HI>Men,</HI> that they may be protected not only from Work, but from Cruel∣ty also. Thirdly, They cou'd at best take no delight to converse with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whose <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>sullen</HI> Temper is so averse to that na∣tural and open <HI>Chearfulness,</HI> which is generally observ'd to accompany all true Knowledge.</P>
<P>But now were it possible, that any way cou'd be found out to draw forth their Latent Qualities, I cannot but think it wou'd be highly serviceable to the Learned World, both in respect of reco∣vering past Knowledge, and promoting the Fu∣ture.
<PB N="95" REF="95"/>
Might there not be found certain gentle artful Methods, whereby to endear us to them? Is there no Nation in the World, whose na∣tural turn is adapted to engage their Society, and win them by a <HI>sweet Similitude</HI> of <HI>Manners?</HI> Is there no Nation where the Men might allure them by a distingushing Civility, and in a man∣ner <HI>fascinate</HI> them by <HI>assimilated Motions?</HI> No Nation, where the Women with easy freedoms, and the gentlest Treatment, might oblige the loving Creatures to sensible returns of Humanity? The Love I bear my native Country, prompts me to wish this Nation might be <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but alas! in our present wretched divided Condi∣tion, how can we hope that <HI>Foreigners</HI> of so great Prudence, will <HI>freely declare</HI> their Sentiments, in the midst of violent <HI>Parties,</HI> and at so vast a di∣stance from their Friends, Relations, and Coun∣try? The Affection I bear our Neighbour-State, wou'd incline me to wish it were <HI>Holland—Sed laevâ in parte Mamillae Nil salit Arcadico.</HI> 'Tis from <HI>France</HI> then we must expect this Restora∣tion of Learning, whose late Monarch took the Sciences under his Protection, and rais'd them to so great a Height. May we not hope their Emis∣saries will some time or other have Instructions, not only to invite Learned Men into their Coun∣try, but Learned Beasts, the true ancient Man-Tegers, I mean of <HI>Aethopia</HI> and <HI>India?</HI> Might not the Talents of each Kind of these be adapted to the Improvement of the several Sciences? The Man-Tegers to instruct Heroes, Statesmen and Scholars? Baboons to teach the Courtiers, Cere∣mony and Address? Monkeys, the Art of plea∣sing
<PB N="96" REF="96"/>
in Conversation and agreeable Affectations, to Ladies and their Lovers? The Apes of less learning, Comedians and Dancing Masters? The Marmosets Court Pages, and young <HI>English</HI> Travellers.

<P>WE shall begin with a Description of <HI>Peter</HI> the Savage, deferring our other Curiosities to some following Papers.</P>
<P><HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> the two famous wild Men of Antiquity, and <HI>Orsin</HI> that of the Moderns, have been justly the Admiration of all Mankind: Nor can we presage less of this wild Youth, as may be gather'd from that famous and well known Prophecy of <HI>Lilly</HI>'s, which being now accomplish'd, is most easily interpreted.<Q><PB N="107" REF="107"/>
<L>When <HI>Rome</HI> shall wend to <HI>Benevento,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Espagne</HI> breaking the <HI>Assiento;</HI></L>
<L>When Eagle Split shall fly to <HI>China,</HI></L>
<L>And Christian Folks adore <HI>Faustina:</HI></L>
<L>Then shall an Oak be brought to Bed,</L>
<L>Of Creature neither taught nor fed;</L>
<L>Great Feats shall he atchieve—</L></Q></P>
<P>The Pope is now going to <HI>Benevento:</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having broke their Treaty; the Em∣peror Trades to <HI>China;</HI> and <HI>Lilly,</HI> were he alive, must be convinced, that it was not the Empress <HI>Faustina</HI> that was meant in the Pro∣phecy.</P>
<P>It is evident by several Tokens about this wild Gentleman, that he had a Father and Mo∣ther like one of us; but there being no Register of his Christening, his Age is only to be guessed at by his Stature and Countenance, and appeareth to be about Twelve or Thirteen. His being so young was the Occasion of the great Disappoint∣ment of the Ladies, who came to the Drawing Room in full Expectation of some Attempt upon their Chastity: So far is true, that he endeavour'd to Kiss the young Lady <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>le,</HI> who for that rea∣son is become the Envy of the Circle; this being a Declaration of Nature, in favour of her supe∣rior Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, That Man is the most Mimick of all Animals; which Opinion of that great Philosopher is strongly confirm'd by the Beha∣viour of this wild Gentleman, who is endow'd with that Quality to an extream Degree. He receiv'd his first Impressions at Court: His
<PB N="108" REF="108"/>
Maners are, first to lick People's Hands, and then turn his Breech upon them; to thurst his Hand into every body's <HI>Pocket;</HI> to climb over People's <HI>Heads;</HI> and even to make use of the <HI>Royal Hand,</HI> to <HI>take</HI> what he has a mind to. At his first Appearance he seiz'd on the Lord Cham∣berlain's Staff, and put on his Hat before the King; from whence some have conjectur'd, that he is either descended from a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Earls of <HI>Kingsale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> However, these are manifest Tokens of his innate Ambi∣tion; he is extreamly tenacious of his own Pro∣perty, and ready to invade that of other People. By this mimick Quality he discover'd what wild Beast had nurs'd him: Observing Children to ask Blessing of their Mothers, one Day he fell down upon his Knees to a Sow, and mutter'd some Sounds in that humble Posture.</P>
<P>It has been commonly thought, that he is <HI>Ulrick</HI>'s natural Brother, because of some resem∣blance of Manners, and the officious Care of <HI>Ul∣rick</HI> about him; but the Superiority of the Parts and Genius in <HI>Peter,</HI> demonstrates this to be impossible.</P>
<P>Though he is ignorant both of ancient and mo∣dern Languages, (that Care being left to the inge∣nious Physician, who is entrusted with his Educa∣tion) yet he distinguishes Objects by certain Sounds fram'd to himself, which Mr. <HI>Rotenberg,</HI> who brought him over, understands perfectly. Behold∣ing one day the Shambles with great Fear and Astonishment, ever since he calls Man by the same Sound which expresseth Wolf. A young Lady is a Peacock, old Women Mag-pyes and Owls; a
<PB N="109" REF="109"/>
Beau with a <HI>Toupee,</HI> a Monkey; Glass, Ice; Blue, Red, and Green Ribbons, he calls Rainbows; an Heap of Gold a Turd. The first Ship he saw, he took to be a great Beast swimming on her Back, and her Feet tied above her: The Men that came out of the Hold he took to be her Cubs, and won∣der'd they were so unlike their Dam. He under∣stands perfectly the Language of all Beasts and Birds, and is not, like them, confin'd to that of one Species. He can bring any Beast what he calls for, and no doubt is much miss'd now in his Na∣tive Woods, where he us'd to do good Offices among his Fellow Citizens, and serv'd as a Medi∣ator to reconcile their Differences. One Day he warn'd a Flock of Sheep that were driving to the Shambles, of their Danger, and upon uttering some Sounds, they all fled. He takes vast Pleasure in Conversation with Horses; and going to the <HI>Meuse</HI> to converse with two of his intimate Ac∣quaintances in the King's Stable, as he pass'd by, he Neighed to the horse at <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> being as it were surpriz'd to see him so high, he seem'd to take it ill that the Horse did not answer him; but I think no body can undervalue his Under∣standing for not being skill'd in Statuary.</P>
<P>He expresseth his Joy most commonly by Neighing; and whatever the Philosophers may talk of their Risibility, Neighing is a more No∣ble Expression of that Passion than Laughing, which seems to me to have something Silly in it; and besides, is often attended with Tears. Other Animals are sensible they debase themselves, by mimicking Laughter; and I take it to be a general Observation, that the top Felicity of Mankind is
<PB N="110" REF="110"/>

Love he expresseth by the Cooing of a Dove, and Anger by the Croaking of a Raven, and it is not doubted but that he will serve in Time as an Interpreter between us and other Animals.</P>
<P>Great Instruction is to be had from this wild Youth in the knowledge of Simples; and I am of Opinion, that he ought always to attend the Censors of the College in their Visitation of Apo∣thecaries Shops.</P>
<P>I am told that the new <HI>Sect</HI> of <HI>Herb-eaters</HI> in∣tend to follow him into the Fields, or to beg him for a Clerk of their Kitchen: And that there are many of them now thinking of turning their Chil∣dren into Woods to Graze with the Cattle, in hopes to raise a healthy and moral Race, refin'd from the Corruptions of this Luxurious World.</P>
<P>He sings naturally several pretty Tunes of his own Composing, and with equal Facility, in the <HI>Chromatick, Inharmonick,</HI> and <HI>Diatonick</HI> Stile, and consequently must be of infinite Use to the Academy, in judging of the Merits of their Com∣posers, and is the only Person that ought to decide betwixt <HI>Cuzzoni</HI> and <HI>Faustina.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit his first Notion of Cloaths, which he took to be the natural Skins of the Crea∣tures that wore them, and seem'd to be in great Pain for the pulling off a Stocking, thinking the poor Man was a Fleaing.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that there are disaffected Peo∣ple,
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
who say he is a <HI>Pretender,</HI> and no genuine wild Man. This Calumny proceeds from the false Notions they have of wild Men, which they frame from such as they see about the Town, whose Actions are rather absurd than wild; therefore it will be incumbent on all young Gentlemen, who are ambitious to excel in this Character, to Copy this true Original of Nature.</P>
<P>The Senses of this wild Man are vastly more acute than those of a tame One; he can follow the Track of a Man, or any other Beast of Prey. A Dog is an Ass to him for finding Troufles; his Hearing is more perfect, because his Ears not ha∣ving been confin'd by Bandages, he can move them like a Drill, and turn them towards the So∣norous Object.</P>
<P>Let us pray the Creator of all Beings, Wild and Tame, that as this wild Youth, by being brought to Court, has been made a Christian; so such as are at Court, and are no Christians, may lay aside their Savage and Rapacious Nature, and return to the Meekness of the Gospel.</P>

<HEAD>An INFALIBLE SCHEME To Pay the PUBLICK DEBT OF IRELAND in Six Months.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Distress of this unhappy <HI>Country,</HI> is too visible to all, except those who have Power to redress it.</P>
<P>We may observe thro' the whole Nation one universal Complaint of the Decay of Trade, the Oppression of Landlords, and the Deficiency of Money; and yet I cannot find among all the Schemes proposed to lessen these Evils, any one in particular, which seems likely to succeed.</P>
<P>But, what is still an Addition to this me∣lancholy Prospect of Affairs, is the unbounded <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Extravagance,</HI> both in Apparel and
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
Entertaiments, which Persons of all Ranks and Degrees run into at present, tho' in general we labour under such Hardships and Poverty.</P>
<P>We are affected in a quite different Manner from all the Nations upon Earth; for, with others, <HI>Wealth</HI> is the Mother of <HI>Luxury,</HI> but with us <HI>Poverty</HI> has the very same Effect: With others, <HI>Scarcity</HI> is the Parent of Industry, but with us it is the Nurse of <HI>Idleness</HI> and <HI>Vice.</HI></P>
<P>We labour to imitate our neighbouring King∣doms in nothing but their Extravagance, with∣out having the same plentiful Aids of <HI>Commerce,</HI> or applying ourselves to the Study of <HI>Fair-deal∣ing</HI> to maintain it. So that, in short, by our own ill Management, we are brought to so low an Ebb of Wealth and Credit, that our Condi∣tion seems incapable of any Relief.</P>
<P>But as I have the Interest of this misguided People very much at Heart, I do not intend this Essay as a Detection of their present Grievan∣ces, but as a Remedy against them. And for that Purpose I have labour'd to find out such a <HI>Scheme</HI> as will discharge our publick Debt with all possible Ease and Pleasure to the Subject, and in so short a Time, that we may neither com∣plain of being oppressed with long continued Taxes, (as some unreasonable People often pre∣sume to do) nor quite despair of being once more in a thriving Condition.</P>
<P>Let us consider what those <HI>Vices</HI> are, which at present prevail most among us; and I believe, upon Enquiry, they will be found <HI>Perjury, For∣nication, Drunkenness, Swearing, Slander, Infi∣delity, Fraud, Blasphemy,</HI> and many others.
<PB N="114" REF="114"/>
Would it not then be worthy of our Considerati∣on whether a moderate Tax upon every parti∣cular <HI>Vice,</HI> instead of laying an additional Duty upon <HI>Wine, Hops,</HI> and other Commodities, wou'd not supply us with a sufficient Sum in a very short Time? Such a Tax must of Necessity yield a vast Revenue, and prove the most infallible, and indeed the only Scheme for our Prosperi∣ty, if it shall be thought proper to be conti∣nued.</P>
<P>But, before I proceed to Particulars, it may not be amiss to premise, that this Tax is not designed for any one County or Province in this Kingdom, but to extend itself universally over the whole Nation; because different Vices may flourish in different Counties, as different Plants in their different Soils; as <HI>Perjury</HI> in one, <HI>Theft</HI> in another, <HI>Dissimulation</HI> and <HI>Flattery</HI> in an∣other, <HI>Rapine</HI> in another, and so of the rest: However, I take <HI>Theft</HI> to be our peculiar <HI>staple Vice.</HI></P>
<P>And least any Disputes may hereafter arise about the Nature of <HI>Perjury,</HI> the Intention of the <HI>Act</HI> in this particular, or what Persons are to be subject to this Tax, I must here also pre∣mise, that every <HI>Lie</HI> confirmed by an Oath, is undoubtedly <HI>Perjury,</HI> whether before a <HI>Ma∣gistrate,</HI> or behind a <HI>Counter.</HI> And, therefore, we do not doubt, but the Trading Part of our People, will be great Benefactors to the Pub∣lick, in this particular Article, as well as many others.</P>
<P>These two Things being premis'd, let us
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
suppose that in this large Country, 5000 Per∣sons are guilty of this Infirmity each Day-Which Computation must be allow'd very mo∣derate, if we recollect that this Number is not above a four-hundredth Part of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom, who are generally computed to amount to <HI>Two Millions.</HI> And if we further consider what strong Inducements our Natives have to practise it, from its being often so ex∣ceeding beneficial; if we consider the great Use made of it in all Sorts of <HI>Traffick;</HI> the great Demands for it in <HI>Law-suits;</HI> the great Advan∣tage of it in <HI>Elections,</HI> and the undeniable Profit of it in all <HI>Prosecutions,</HI> we shall think the Num∣ber of 5000 still more reasonable.</P>
<P>Let us then suppose every one of this Number to be perjur'd, only once every Day, (which is a very favourable Supposition) and subject only to a Tax of Sixpence for each Offence; for which Sum, perhaps, he may procure either the Death of an Enemy, an Estate for his Friend, or a Fortune for himself, (all which are esteem'd very desirable) the Tax will be too inconsidera∣ble to make any one murmur, and yet will yield the Sum of 125<HI>l. per Day,</HI> towards discharging our National Debt.</P>
<P>Besides, this Tax, tho' very low, may in Reality be very profitable for Mankind; for <HI>At∣tornies, Sollicitors, Usurers, Butchers,</HI> and other honest Traders, will scarce think it answerable to the Expence of Time, to forswear themselves for any Profit from One Penny to Six Pence in∣clusive, (as now customary) but will at least,
<PB N="116" REF="116"/>
for every Transgression, expect to gain sufficient to defray the Tax.</P>
<P>However, I would have all sworn <HI>Constables,</HI> and all <HI>Collectors</HI> of this and many other Taxes, entirely exempted from any Penalty as priviledg'd Persons; because by that Means they will be enabled to be very serviceable in their several Stations.</P>
<P>Fornication, as the World is at present, would furnish the Publick with a large Sum, even at a very moderate Tax; for it is now made an essential Part of the polite Gentleman's Chara∣cter, and he that has prevail'd on the greatest Number, proportionably rises in Reputation.</P>
<P>Let us then compute that in the several Parts of this Nation, 5000 <HI>per</HI> Day, were liable to be taxed for this general Vice, only at two Shillings: The Sum arising from this to the publick Good, will amount to 500<HI>l. per</HI> Day, and in Six Months to almost one Third of our National Debt.</P>
<P>I know it may be here objected, that I have computed upon too small a Number, and that I might justly account rather upon Twenty or Thirty Thousand <HI>per</HI> Day, in the several Coun∣ties of this Kingdom: But, tho' I own this Ob∣jection to be very strong, if we were to consider the Opportunities of <HI>Wakes, Patron-Days, Hay∣making</HI> Seasons, <HI>May-Days, Religious Pilgrima∣ges to Holy Wells, Balls</HI> publick and private, and many other commodious Scenes for that kind of Entertainment; yet I would rather chuse to err on the right Side in too small, than too great a Computation.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="117"/>
I know the <HI>Popish</HI> Clergy will make strong Remonstrances against this Tax; and plead, that it is design'd to oppress them; that all Nations of the Earth allow them a <HI>Toleration</HI> in this particular Point, as they are <HI>frail</HI> Mortals, and sworn to <HI>Celibacy;</HI> and what is still worse, that such a Tax would be the most effectual Means to drain them of their whole Revenues; but as I would not have such pious Persons justly complain of the least Rigour, I shall readily agree to their being exempted.</P>
<P>Drunkenness I would only Tax at Six Pence, because it might be prejudicial to <HI>His Majesty's Revenue,</HI> to discourage it, and consequently sub∣ject the Proposer to Penalties.</P>
<P>Let us then compute, that only Twenty Thousand Persons, (which is but one hundredth Part of the People in this Kingdom) were daily liable to be tax'd, the Amount would be 500<HI>l. per</HI> Day. And how extreamly moderate this Computation is, may appear to any one who considers, that besides the usual Opportunities of <HI>Taverns,</HI> and <HI>private Houses,</HI> there are <HI>Ele∣ctions, Fairs, Mayor</HI>'s <HI>Feasts, University Treats, Corporation Dinners, Christmas Regales, Wed∣dings</HI> and <HI>Christnings,</HI> both in Town and Coun∣try, and many other irresistible Inducements to this manly Vice, which would, perhaps, if nice∣ly calculated, daily furnish us with two Thirds more than our computed Number, and by that Means greatly conduce to the Publick Good.</P>
<P>But, however, I would by all Means exempt all Country <HI>Justices of the Peace,</HI> whether
<PB N="118" REF="118"/>
<HI>Squires</HI> or <HI>Parsons:</HI> because it would be unseem∣ly to see such honourable and reverend Persona∣ges insulted by meaner Officers, as often as they might be discover'd in such a Condition.</P>
<P>Swearing would be a most universal Benefit in this Case; because, at present, it serves to season the Discourse of all Ranks and Degrees of Men. It is the principal Ingredient and Decoration of all modern <HI>Jokes, Gibes, Quarrels, Love-Speeches, Disputes, Threats</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> and consequently capable of affording an incredible Revenue.</P>
<P>However, let us suppose 40000 Persons <HI>per</HI> Day, liable to the Tax of Six Pence only for each Offence of this Kind; which, considering the great Number of <HI>Markets, Coffee-Houses, Shambles, Barracks,</HI> and <HI>Gaming-Houses</HI> in this Kingdom, is a very inconsiderable Number; yet even this Article will furnish us with 1000<HI>l. per</HI> Day, which would amount to near two Thirds of the publick Debt.</P>
<P>Our Laws have amerced each Offence in this way at One Shilling, ordering one half to the Informer, and the other to the Poor, which, in my humble Opinion, was very ill concerted; for if the <HI>Legislature</HI> did really intend that this Law should be punctually enforced, they ought to have divided the whole <HI>Mulct</HI> between the <HI>In∣former</HI> and the <HI>Justice,</HI> without any regard to the Poor, and then, they might be assured, it would be vigorously executed.</P>
<P>I am already apprehensive, that all military Persons will expect an Exemption from Taxes on this Account; because they may plead Pre∣cedents
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
for many Generations, may alledge the Power of Custom, the Decency and Comliness of it, when properly mingled with other Dis∣course, or that the censorious World would per∣haps suspect they knew nothing of <HI>God</HI> at all, if they did not sometimes mention his Name; and many other Reasons of equal Weight: But though these Remonstrances are very just, yet as this is the only Means by which, some think a Standing Army can conduce to the national Good, it will be hard to exempt them.</P>
<P>However, as the military Power would infal∣libly be liable to this Tax in all its Branches, by which Means they might be utterly impove∣rish'd, I believe it may not be improper to al∣low all <HI>Foot-Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> all young <HI>Ensigns,</HI> spruce <HI>Cornets,</HI> naval <HI>Captains, Cabin-Boys</HI> and <HI>Quarter-Masters,</HI> forty or fifty Oaths a Day, entirely free from any Tax or Pe∣nalty.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Slander,</HI> supposing only twenty thou∣sand <HI>per</HI> Day, taxed at Six Pence for every Of∣fence, this Article would daily afford the Publick (at the lowest reasonable Computation) five hun∣dred Pounds.</P>
<P>And, as this is a favourite Talent, we might have ventur'd to tax it much higher; but I would not seem to discourage so charitable a Dis∣position, especially where it may promote the Interest of my Country.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> I have been always too great an Admirer of theirs, to desire any Re∣striction should be laid on their Pleasure, either private or publick; and therefore I would have
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
them tax'd only half as much as the Men for every little Error of this Kind; because <HI>Slan∣der,</HI> in Men, is a Talent unnatural and acquired, and generally practised to ingratiate themselves with the opposite Sex; whereas this genteel Fail∣ing in <HI>Females,</HI> is innate, and impossible to be restrain'd; which is a Case that demands our ut∣most Compassion.</P>
<P>I think all <HI>Drawing-Rooms, Assemblies,</HI> and all Places of publick Resort for Ladies, ought to be exempt from any Penalty, because it is so ma∣terial a Part of the Discourse and Amusement of those Places, that to tax them for each Offence, would be in Effect, to enjoin them perpetual Si∣lence; which, if it were possible, would be too great a Misfortune, both to themselves and the World, to be exacted from them.</P>
<P>Infidelity and <HI>Blasphemy</HI> would furnish us with a considerable Sum; and as they are not originally of our own Growth, but annually imported from neighbouring Kingdoms, they ought to be subject to some Duty, which in few Years would probably be a vast Addition to the publick Revenue. Yet as this Traffick is prin∣cipally carried on by young <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and <HI>tra∣velling Squires,</HI> any Attempt to tax it would certainly meet with too vigorous an Opposition. But on condition it might pass into a Law, I would gladly exempt both <HI>Lawyers</HI> of all Ages, <HI>Subaltern,</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers, young Heirs, Dan∣cing-Masters, Pick-Pockets,</HI> and <HI>Players,</HI></P>
<P>Let us now only consider the several Sums arising from the Tax on our <HI>Vices,</HI> as we have before computed them, and the Justness and
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
Infallibility of this Scheme must appear demon∣strably.

which in 182 Days or half a Year, will amount to 477,750<HI>l.</HI> which is considerably more than our National Debt.</P>
<P>But, left by the universal Poverty of our People, which is much to be fear'd, or by their growing more virtuous, which never can be reasonably ap∣prehended, this daily Income should fall short of what we have computed, I must humbly beg Leave to offer some other Improvements of this Scheme, which will undoubtedly answer all Defi∣ciencies.</P>
<P>And for this Purpose, what if a severe Tax was laid on all manner of Persons who presum'd to marry 'till they were full Forty Years old? If any should prove Fool-hardy enough to transgress a Law so calculated for the Happiness of Men, each Offence would be of signal Benefit to the Publick; and if providentially it should prove an effectual
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
Restraint, there must of Necessity be fewer Chil∣dren in each Family, and of Consequence the Number of Beggars and Wretches in this King∣dom must proportionably decrease. And what would still be more material, perhaps, in one Age, if this beneficial Act should be continued, the greatest part of this Country would require to be new peopled from <HI>E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d;</HI> a Circumstance greatly to be wish'd; because such an Accident would probably cure that Nation of its inveterate Antipathy to the Inhabitants of this, at least for some Generations.</P>
<P>As for the Scheme to tax Batchelors, which has lately been propos'd to the House by one of its Honourable Members, I must beg leave to think it highly improper; because batchelors, of all Ranks and Degrees, are real Benefactors to the Publick, by not furnishing it either with <HI>Beggars,</HI> or <HI>Oppres∣sors of Beggars,</HI> one of which must infallibly be the Consequence of Marriage in this Country.</P>
<P>I would also earnestly request, that all young <HI>Clergymen,</HI> who, with more Passion than Pru∣dence, shall dare to marry before they are bene∣fic'd, may be liable to a most severe Tax, equal to a Prohibition; because such Offenders must inevitably multiply <HI>Beggars,</HI> live in <HI>Contempt,</HI> and die in <HI>Poverty.</HI></P>
<P>These, and many other Expedients, might ea∣sily be found upon any Emergency to furnish con∣siderable Sums for the National Debt.</P>
<P>But as there will remain about 177,750<HI>l.</HI> over and above our publick Debt, I will allow One Hundred Thousand Pounds of it for Sallaries, to
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
such Persons as shall be appointed Collectors, and I hope this will be a reasonable Provision, tho' ge∣nerally above one half of every Tax is expended in paying proper Officers to collect it. The Overplus may be deposited in the Treasury for any other pious Use.</P>
<P>And if this Scheme should be so fortunate as to succeed, as I have no Reason to doubt from the present Disposition of the H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> of C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s, all those Noblemen who shall be appointed Commissi∣oners, will have excellent Opportunities of pro∣moting their <HI>Nephews, Cousins, Footmen, Foster∣ers, Valets,</HI> and other valuable Dependants, to good Incomes, and Places of Trust and Credit. But I would, by all Means, have none but <HI>En∣glishmen</HI> nominated to be Tax Gatherers; because we may rationally suppose, that they will be en∣tirely free from Prejudice, in Favour of the Na∣tives of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus would a moderate Tax upon our <HI>Vices</HI> ap∣parently contribute to save this Nation from utter Ruin. Many Persons who have not the least Ex∣cuse for their Irregularities at present, (except the commendable Publick-spirited Contempt for Reli∣gion) might then plead in their own Defence, that their Immoralities had preserved their Coun∣try. And by this Means we might be furnish'd with a Multitude of <HI>Patriots,</HI> who probably would never prove so in any other Respect.</P>
<P>But I must humbly beg leave to dissent from that religious Gentleman, the excellent Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees;</HI> though, perhaps, such a Particularity of Opinion may injure my Character
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
with several of my Lay-brethren of most Profes∣sions; and I must publickly declare, that there can be no other Method half so good as mine, to make <HI>Private Vices Publick Benefits.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR Preventing the Children of poor people in <HI>Ireland,</HI> from being a Burden to their Parents or Coun∣try, and for making them Bene∣ficial to the Publick.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a melancholy Object to those, who walk through this great Town or travel in the Coun∣try, when they see the <HI>Streets,</HI> the <HI>Roads</HI> and <HI>Cabbin-doors</HI> crowded with <HI>Beggars</HI> of the Female Sex, followed by three, four, or six Children, <HI>all in Rags,</HI> and importuning every Passenger for an Alms. These <HI>Mothers</HI> instead of being able to work for their honest livelyhood, are forced to employ all their time in Stroling to beg Sustenance for their <HI>helpless Infants,</HI> who, as they grow up, either turn <HI>Thieves</HI> for want of Work, or leave their <HI>dear Native Country, to fight for the Pretender in</HI> Spain, or sell themselves to the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="126"/>
I think it is agreed by all Parties, that this pro∣digious number of Children in the Arms, or on the Backs, or at the <HI>Heels</HI> of their <HI>Mothers,</HI> and fre∣quently of their <HI>Fathers,</HI> is <HI>in the present deplora∣ble state of the Kingdom,</HI> a very great additional Grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these Children sound and useful Members of the Com∣mon-wealth, would deserve so well of the Publick, as to have his Statue set up for a Preserver of the Nation.</P>
<P>But my Intention is very far from being confi∣ned to provide only for the Children of <HI>professed Beggars,</HI> it is of a much greater Extent, and shall take in the whole Number of Infants at a certain Age, who are born of Parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our Chari∣ty in the Streets.</P>
<P>As to my own Part, having turned my Thoughts, for many Years, upon this important Subject, and maturely weighed the several <HI>Schemes for no Projectors,</HI> I have always found them gross∣ly mistaken in their Computation. It is true, a Child <HI>just dropt from its Dam,</HI> may be supported by her Milk, for a Solar Year with little other Nou∣rishment, at most not above the Value of two Shil∣lings, which the Mother may certainly get, or the Value in <HI>Scraps,</HI> by her lawful Occupation of Begging; and it is exactly at one Year Old that I propose to provide for them in such a Manner, as, instead of being a Charge upon their <HI>Parents,</HI> or the <HI>Parish,</HI> or <HI>wanting Food and Raiment</HI> for the rest of their Lives, they shall, on the Contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
Cloathing of many Thousands.</P>
<P>There is likewise another great Advantage in my Scheme, that it will prevent those <HI>voluntary Abortions,</HI> and that horrid Practice of <HI>Women murdering their Bastard Children,</HI> alas! too fre∣quent among us, Sacrificing the <HI>poor innocent Babes,</HI> I doubt, more to avoid the Expence than the Shame, which would move Tears and Pity in the most savage and inhuman Breast.</P>
<P>The number of Souls in this Kingdom being usually reckoned one Million and a half. Of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thou∣sand Couple whose Wives are Breeders; from which number I substract thirty Thousand Cou∣ples, who are able to maintain their own Children, although I apprehend there cannot be so many, under <HI>the present Distresses of the Kingdom;</HI> but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and seventy Thousand Breeders. I again substract fifty Thousand, for those Women who miscarry, or whose Children die by accident, or disease within the Year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand Children of poor Parents an∣nually born: The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under the present Situation of Affairs, is utterly impossible by all the Methods hitherto proposed; for we can <HI>neither employ them in Handicraft</HI> or <HI>Agriculture;</HI> we neither build Houses, (I mean in the Country) nor cul∣tivate Land: They can very seldom pick up a Livelihood <HI>by Stealing</HI> 'till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly parts; although, I confess, they learn the Rudiments
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
much earlier; during which time they can how∣ever be properly looked upon only as <HI>Probationers;</HI> as I have been informed by a principal Gentleman in the County of <HI>Cavan,</HI> who protested to me, that he never knew above one or two Instances under the Age of six, even in a part of the King∣dom <HI>so renowned for the quickest Proficiency in that Art.</HI></P>
<P>I am assured by our Merchants, that a Boy or a Girl before twelve years old, is no saleable Commodity, and even when they come to this Age, they will not yield above three Pounds, or three Pounds and half a Crown at most, on the Exchange; which cannot turn to Account either to the Parents or Kingdom, the Charge of Nutriment and Rags having been at least four times that Value.</P>
<P>I shall now therefore humbly propose my own Thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least Objection.</P>
<P>I have been assured by a very knowing <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> of my Acquaintance in <HI>London,</HI> that a young healthy Child well Nursed, is, at a Year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome Food, whether <HI>Stewed, Roasted, Baked,</HI> or <HI>Boiled,</HI> and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a <HI>Fricasie,</HI> or a <HI>Ragoust.</HI></P>
<P>I do therefore humbly offer it to <HI>publick Con∣sideration,</HI> that of the Hundred and twenty thousand Children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for Breed, whereof only one fourth Part to be Males; which is more than we allow to <HI>Sheep, black Cattle,</HI> or <HI>Swine,</HI> and my Reason is, that these Children are seldom the Fruits of Marriage, <HI>a Circumstance not much</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
<HI>regarded by our Savages,</HI> therefore, <HI>one Male</HI> will be sufficient to serve four Females. That the remaining Hundred thousand may at a Year old, be offered in Sale to the Persons of <HI>Qua∣lity</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> through the Kingdom, al∣ways advising the Mother to let them Suck plen∣tifully in the last Month, so as to render them Plump, and Fat for a good Table. A Child will make two Dishes at an Entertainment for Friends, and when the Family dines alone, the fore or hind Quarter will make a reasonable Dish, and seasoned with a little Pepper or Salt will be very good Boiled on the fourth Day, especially in <HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>I have reckoned upon a Medium, that a Child just born will weigh 12 Pounds, and in a solar Year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 Pounds.</P>
<P>I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very <HI>proper for Landlords,</HI> who, as they have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title to the Children.</P>
<P>Infant's flesh will be in Season throughout the Year, but more plentiful in <HI>March,</HI> and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave Au∣thor, an eminent <HI>French</HI> Physician, that <HI>Fish being a prolifick Dyet,</HI> there are more Children born in <HI>Roman Catholick Countries</HI> about nine Months after <HI>Lent,</HI> than at any other Season; therefore reckoning a Year after <HI>Lent,</HI> the Mar∣kets will be more glutted than usual, because the Number of <HI>Popish Infants,</HI> is at least three to one in this Kingdom, and therefore it will have one other Collateral Advantage, by lessening the Number of <HI>Papists</HI> among us.</P>

I have already computed the Charge of nur∣sing a Beggar's Child (in which List I reckon all <HI>Cottagers, Labourers,</HI> and four-fifths of the <HI>Far∣mers</HI>) to be about two Shillings <HI>per Annum,</HI> Rags included; and I believe no Gentleman would repine to give Ten Shillings for the <HI>Carcass of a good fat Child,</HI> which, as I have said, will make four Dishes of excellent Nutritive Meat, when he hath only some particular Friend, or his own Family to dine with him. Thus the Squire will learn to be a good Landlord, and grow popular among his Tenants, the Mother will have Eight Shillings neat Profit, and be fit for Work 'till she produces another Child.</P>
<P>Those who are more thrifty <HI>(as I must confess the Times require)</HI> may flea the Carcass; the Skin of which, Artificially dressed, will make admirable <HI>Gloves, for Ladies,</HI> and <HI>Summer Boots</HI> for <HI>fine Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>As to our City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> Shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most conve∣nient Parts of it, and Butchers we may be assu∣red will not be wanting; although I rather re∣commend buying the Children alive, and dressing them hot from the Knife, as we do <HI>roasting Pigs.</HI></P>
<P>A very worthy Person, <HI>a true Lover of his Country,</HI> and whose Virtues I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this Matter, to offer a Refinement upon my Scheme. He said, that many Gentlemen of this Kingdom, having of late destroyed their Deer, he conceived that the Want of Venison might be well supply'd by the Bodies of young Lads and Maidens, not ex∣ceeding
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
fourteen Years of Age, nor under twelve; so great a Number of both Sexes in every Coun∣try being now ready to starve for want of Work and Service: And these to be disposed of by their Parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest Re∣lations. But with due deference to so excellent a Friend, and so deserving a Patriot, I cannot be altogether in his Sentiments; for as to the Males, my <HI>American</HI> Acquaintance assured me from frequent Experience, that their Flesh was generally Tough and Lean, like that of our School-boys, by continual Exercise, and their Taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the Charge. Then as to the Females, it would, I think, with humble Submission, <HI>be a Loss to the Publick,</HI> because they soon would become Breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous People might be apt to Censure such a Practice, (although in∣deed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon Cruelty, which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest Objection against any Pro∣ject, how well soever intended.</P>
<P>But in order to justify my Friend, he confes∣sed, that this Expedient was put into his Head by the famous <HI>Sallmanaazor,</HI> a Native of the Island <HI>Formosa,</HI> who came from thence to <HI>London,</HI> above twenty Years ago, and in Conversation told my Friend, that in his Country, when any young Person happened to be put to Death, the Executioner sold the Carcass to <HI>Persons of Qua∣lity,</HI> as a prime Dainty, and that, in his Time, the Body of a plump Girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an Attempt to poison the Emperor,
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
was sold to his Imperial <HI>Majesty's prime Minister of State,</HI> and other great <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Court, <HI>in Joints from the Gibbet,</HI> at four hundred Crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same Use were made of several plump young Girls in this Town, who without one single Groat to their Fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a Chair, and appear at a <HI>Play-house,</HI> and <HI>Assemblies</HI> in fo∣reign Fineries, which they never will pay for; the Kingdom would not be the worse.</P>
<P>Some Persons of a desponding Spirit are in great Concern about that vast Number of poor People, who are Aged, Diseased, or Maimed, and I have been desired to employ my Thoughts what Course may be taken, to ease the Nation of so grievous an Incumbrance. But I am not in the least Pain upon that Matter, because it is very well known, that they are every Day <HI>dy∣ing,</HI> and <HI>rotting,</HI> by <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Famine,</HI> and <HI>Filth,</HI> and <HI>Vermin,</HI> as fast as can be reasonably expect∣ed. And as to the young Labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a Condition. They cannot get Work, and consequently pine away for want of Nourishment, to a degree, that if at any Time they are accidentally hired to com∣mon Labour, they have not Strength to perform it, and thus the Country and themselves are hap∣pily delivered from the Evils to come.</P>
<P>I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my Subject, I think the Advantages by the Proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the highest Importance.</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> as I have already observed, it would
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
greatly lessen <HI>the Number of Papists,</HI> with whom we are Yearly over-run, being the principal Bree∣ders of the Nation, as well as our most dangerous Enemies, and who stay at home on purpose with a Design <HI>to deliver the Kingdom to the Pretender,</HI> hoping to take their Advantage by the Absence <HI>of so many good Protestants,</HI> who have chosen rather to leave their Country, than stay at home, and pay Tithes against their Conscience, to an <HI>Epis∣copal Curate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scecondly,</HI> The poorer Tenants will have some∣thing valuable of their own, which by Law may be made liable to Distress, and help to pay their Landlord's Rent, their Corn and Cattle being al∣ready seized, and <HI>Money a thing unknown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whereas the Maintainance of an hun∣dred thousand Children, from two Years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than Ten Shillings a piece <HI>per Annum,</HI> the Nation's Stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> besides the Profit of a new Dish, in∣troduced to the Tables of all <HI>Gentlemen of Fortune</HI> in the Kingdom, who have any Refinement in Taste, and the Money will circulate among our Selves, the Goods being entirely of our own Growth and Manufacture.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The constant Breeders, besides the Gain of eight Shillings <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> by the Sale of their Children, will be rid of the Charge of maintaining them after the first Year.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="134"/>
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> This Food would likewise bring great <HI>Custom to Taverns,</HI> where the Vintners will cer∣tainly be so prudent as to procure the best Receipts for dressing it to Perfection; and consequently have their Houses frequented by all the fine <HI>Gen∣tlemen,</HI> who justly value themselves upon their Knowledge in good Eating; and a skilful Cook, who understands how to oblige his Guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> This would be a great Inducement to Marriage, which all wise Nations have either en∣couraged by Rewards, or enforced by Laws and Penalties. It would encrease the Care and Tender∣ness of Mothers towards their Children, when they were sure of a Settlement for Life, to the poor Babes, provided in some Sort by the Publick, to their annual Profit instead of Expence; we should soon see an honest Emulation among the married Women, <HI>which of them could bring the fat∣test Child to the Market.</HI> Men would become as <HI>fond</HI> of their Wives, during the Time of their Pregnancy, as they are now of their <HI>Mares</HI> in Foal, their <HI>Cows</HI> in Calf, or <HI>Sows</HI> when they are ready to farrow, nor offer to beat or kick them (as is too <HI>frequent</HI> a Practice) for fear of a Miscar∣riage.</P>
<P>Many other advantages might be enumerated. For Instance, the Addition of some thousand Car∣casses in our exportation of Barrel'd Beef: The Pro∣pagation of <HI>Swines Flesh,</HI> and Improvement in the Art of making good <HI>Bacon,</HI> so much wanted among us by the great Destruction of <HI>Pigs,</HI> too frequent at our Tables, which are no way comparable in
<PB N="135" REF="135"/>
Taste, or Magnificence to a well grown, fat Yearly Child, which roasted whole will make a considerable Figure at a <HI>Lord Mayor's Feast,</HI> or any other Publick Entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of Brevity.</P>
<P>Supposing that one thousand Families in this City, would be constant Customers for Infants Flesh, besides others who might have it at <HI>merry Meetings,</HI> particularly at <HI>Weddings</HI> and <HI>Christen∣ings,</HI> I compute that <HI>Dublin</HI> would take off Annu∣ally about twenty thousand Carcasses and the rest of the Kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty Thou∣sand.</P>
<P>I can think of no one Objection, that will pos∣sibly be raised against this Proposal, unless it should be urged, that the Number of People will be thereby much lessened in the Kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas indeed one principal De∣sign in offering it to the World. I desire the Reader will observe, that I calculate my Remedy <HI>for this one individual Kingdom of</HI> IRELAND, <HI>and for no Other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon Earth.</HI> Therefore let no Man talk to me of other Expedients: <HI>Of taxing our Absentees at five Shillings a Pound: Of using neither Cloaths, nor Houshold Furniture, except what is of our own Growth and Manufacture: Of utterly re∣jecting the Materials and Instruments that promote Foreign Luxury: Of curing the Expensiveness of Pride, Vanity, Idleness, and Gameing in our Wo∣men: Of introducing a Vein of Parcimony, Prudence and Temperance: Of learning to love our Country, wherein we differ even from</HI> LAPLANDERS,
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
<HI>and the Inhabitants of</HI> TOPINAMBOO: <HI>Of quitting our Animosities, and Factions, nor act any longer like the</HI> Jews, <HI>who were murdering one an∣other at the very moment their City was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our Country and Con∣sciences for nothing: Of teaching Landlords to have at least one Degree of Mercy towards their Tenants,</HI> Lastly, <HI>Of putting a Spirit of Honesty, Industry, and Skill into our Shop-keepers, who, if a Resolution, could now be taken to buy only our Native Goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the Price, the Measure, and the Goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair Proposal of just Dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I repeat, let no Man talk to me of these and the like Expedients, 'till he hath at least some Glimpse of Hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere Attempt to put <HI>them in Practice.</HI></P>
<P>But, as to my self, having been wearied out for many Years with offering vain, idle, visionary Thoughts, and at length utterly desparing of Suc∣cess, I fortunately fell upon this Proposal, which, as it is wholly new, so it hath something Solid and Real, of no Expence and little Trouble, full in our own Power, and whereby we can incur no Danger in <HI>disobliging</HI> ENGLAND. For this kind of Commodity will not bear Exportation, the Flesh being of too tender a Consistence, to admit a long Continuance in Salt, <HI>although perhaps I could name a Country, which would be glad to eat up our whole Nation without it.</HI></P>
<P>After all, I am not so violently bent upon my
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
own Opinion, as to reject any Offer, proposed by wise Men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that Kind shall be advanced in Contradiction to my Scheme, and offering a better, I desire the Author or Authors, will be pleased maturely to consider two Points. <HI>First,</HI> As things now stand, how they will be able to find Food and Raiment for a hundred Thousand useless Mouths and Backs. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> There being a round Million of Crea∣tures in Humane Figure, throughout this King∣dom, whose whole subsistence put into a common Stock, would leave them in Debt two Millions of Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> adding those, who are Beggars by Profession, to the Bulk of Farmers, Cottagers and Labourers, with their Wives and Children, who are Beggars in effect; I desire those Politi∣cians, who dislike my Overture, and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an Answer, that they will first ask the Parents of these Mortals, Whether they would not at this Day think it a great Happiness to have been sold for Food at a Year old, in the man∣ner I prescribe, and thereby have avoided such a perpetual Scene of Misfortunes, as they have since gone through, by the <HI>Oppression of Landlords,</HI> the Impossibility of paying Rent without Money or Trade, the Want of common Sustenance, with neither House nor Cloaths to cover them from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and the most ine∣vitable Prospect of intailing the like, or greater Miseries upon their Breed for ever.</P>
<P>I prosess in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have not the least Personal Interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary Work, having no other
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
Motive than the <HI>Publick Good of my Country, by ad∣vancing our Trade, providing for Infants, relieving the Poor, and giving some pleasure to the Rich.</HI> I have no Children, by which I can propose to get a single Penny; the youngest being nine Years Old, and my Wife past Child-boaring.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> THE Lord <HI>CARTERET,</HI> From the CHARGE of favouring <HI>Tories, High-Church-Men,</HI> and <HI>Jacobites.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN order to treat this important Subject with the greatest Fairness and Impartiality, perhaps it may be convenient to give some Account of his Excellency, in whose Life and Character there are certain Particulars which might suggest a very just Suspicion of some Truth in the Accusation he lies under.</P>
<P>He is descended from two noble, ancient, and most loyal Families, the <HI>Carterets</HI> and the <HI>Gran∣villes,</HI> too much distinguished, I confess, for
<PB N="140" REF="140"/>
what they acted, and what they suffered in de∣fending the former Constitution in Church and State, under King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr; I mean that very Prince, on Account of whose Martyr∣dom <HI>a Form of Prayer with Fasting was enjoin'd by Act of Parliament, to be used on the Thirtieth Day of</HI> January <HI>every Year, to implore the Mercies of God, that the Guilt of that sacred and innocent Blood,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>might not be visited on us or our Poste∣rity,</HI> as we may read at large in our <HI>Common-Prayer-Books,</HI> which Day hath been solemnly kept, even within the Memory of many Men now alive.</P>
<P>His Excellency the present Lord, was educa∣ted in the University of <HI>Oxford;</HI> from thence, with a Singularity scarce to be justified, he carri∣ed away more <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and Philosophy, than properly became a Person of his Rank; in∣deed, much more of each, than most of those who are forc'd to live by their Learning, will be at the unnecessary Pains to load their Heads with.</P>
<P>This was the Rock he split on upon his first Appearance in the World, just got clear of his Guardians. For as soon as he came to Town, some Bishops and Clergymen, and other Persons most eminent for Learning and Parts, got him among them, from whom, though he were fortunately dragg'd by a Lady and the Court, yet he could never wipe off the Stain, nor wash out the Tincture of his University Acquirements and Disposition.</P>
<P>To this another Missortune was added, That it pleased God to endow him with great natural
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
Talents, Memory, Judgment, Comprehension, Eloquence, and Wit; and to finish the Work, all these were fortify'd, even in his Youth, with the advantages received by such Employments, as are best fitted, both to exercise and polish the Gifts of Nature and Education, having been Ambassador in several Courts, when his Age would hardly allow him to take a Degree, and made Principal Secretary of State at a Period, when, according to Custom, he ought to have been busied in losing his Money at a Chocolate∣house, or in other Amusements, equally laudable and epidemick among Persons of Honour.</P>
<P>I cannot omit another weak Side in his Excel∣lency, for it is known, and can be proved upon him, that <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Books might be found every Day in his Dressing-Room, if it were care∣fully searched; and there is Reason to suspect, that some of the said Books have been privately convey'd to him by <HI>Tory</HI> Hands. I am likewise assured, that he hath been taken in the very Fact of reading the said Books, even in the midst of a Session, to the great Neglect of publick Affairs.</P>
<P>I own, there may be some Grounds for this Charge, because I have it from good Hands, that when his Excellency is at Dinner with one or two Scholars at his Elbows, he grows a most insupport∣able and unintelligible Companion to all the sine Gentlemen round the table.</P>
<P>I cannot deny, that his Excellency lies under another great Disadvantage; for besides all the Accomplishments abovementioned, having that of a most comely and graceful Person, he hath, du∣ring the Prime of Youth, Spirits and Vigour, in
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
a most exemplary Manner led a regular, dome∣stick Life, discover'd a great Esteem, Friendship and Love for his Lady, as well as a true Affection for his Children: And when he is dispos'd to ad∣mit an entertaining Evening Companion, he doth not always enough reflect whether the Person may possibly in former Days have lain under the Impu∣tation of a <HI>Tory?</HI> Nor at such Times do the natu∣ral or affected Fears of <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender</HI> make any Part of the Conversation: I presume, because neither <HI>Homer, Plato, Aristotle,</HI> nor <HI>Ci∣cero,</HI> have made any mention of them.</P>
<P>These I freely acknowledge to be his Excellen∣cy's Failings; yet, I think, it is agreed by Phi∣losophers and Divines, that some Allowance ought to be given to human Infirmity, and the Prejudices of a wrong Education.</P>
<P>I am well aware how much my Sentiments differ from the orthodox Opinion of one or two principal Patriots; for these have decided the Matter directly against me, by declaring, that no Person, who was ever known to lie under the Sus∣picion of one single <HI>Tory</HI> Principle, or who had been once seen at a great Man's Levee in the <HI>worst of Times,</HI> should be allow'd to come within the Verge of the Castle; much less to bow in the Anti-Chamber, appear at the <HI>Assemblies,</HI> or dance at a Birth-Night. However, I dare assert, that this Maxim hath been often controul'd, and that, on the contrary, a considerable Number of <HI>early Penitents</HI> have been received into Grace, who are now an <HI>Ornament, Happiness,</HI> and <HI>Sup∣port</HI> to the Nation.</P>
<P>Neither do I find any Murmuring on some
<PB N="143" REF="143"/>
other Points of greater Importance, where this favourite Maxim is not so strictly observed.</P>
<P>To instance only in one. I have not heard that any Care hath hitherto been taken to discover whether <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A famous Rope-dancer.</NOTE>Madam <HI>Violante</HI> be a <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI> in her Principles, or even that she hath ever been <HI>offer'd the Oaths to the Governmem t;</HI> on the con∣trary, I am told, that she openly professeth her∣self to be a <HI>High-Flyer;</HI> and it is not improbable, but by her <HI>Outlandish</HI> Name she may also be a <HI>Pa∣pist</HI> in her Heart. Yet we see this illu strious and dangerous Female openly caress'd by principal Per∣sons of both Parties, who contribute to support her in a splendid Manner, without the least Ap∣prehensions from a <HI>Grand Jury.</HI> And as <HI>Hobbs</HI> wise∣ly observes, <HI>so much Money</HI> being equivalent to <HI>so much Power,</HI> it may deserve considering with what Safety such an Instrument of <HI>Power</HI> ought to be trusted in the Hands of an <HI>Alien,</HI> who hath not given any legal Security for her good Affection to the Government.</P>
<P>I confess there is one Evil, which I could wish our Friends would think proper to redress. There are many <HI>Whigs</HI> in this Kingdom of the <HI>old∣fashion'd Stamp,</HI> of whom we might make very good Use; they bear the same Loyalty with us. to the <HI>Hanoverian</HI> Family, in the Person of King <HI>George</HI> the Second; the same Abhorrence of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> with the Consequents of <HI>Popery</HI> and Slavery; and the same Indulgence to <HI>tender Con∣sciences;</HI> but having nothing to ask for them∣selves, and consequently the more Leisure to think for the Publick; they are often apt to en∣tertain
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
Fears and melancholy Prospects concer∣ning the State of their Country, the Decay of Trade, the Want of Money, the miserable Con∣dition of the People, with other Topicks of like Nature, all which do equally concern both <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> who, if they have any Thing to lose, must be equally Sufferers. Perhaps one or two of these melanchly Gentlemen will sometimes ven∣ture to publish their Thoughts in Print: Now, I can by no Means approve our usual Custom of cursing and railing at this Species of Thinkers, un∣der the Names of <HI>Tories, Jacobites, Papists, Li∣bellers, Rebels,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>This was the utter Ruin of that poor, angry, bustling, well-meaning Mortal <HI>Pistorides,</HI> who lies equally under the Contempt of both Parties, with no other Difference than a Mixture of <HI>Pity</HI> on one Side and of <HI>Aversion</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>How hath he been pelted, pester'd and pounded by one single Wag, who promiseth never to for∣sake him living or dead.</P>
<P>I was much pleased with the Humour of a <HI>Sur∣geon</HI> in this Town, who, having in his own Ap∣prehensions received some great Injustice from the Earl of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and desparing of Revenge, as well as Relief, declared to all his Friends, that he had set apart a hundred Guineas to purchase the Earl's Carcass from the Sexton, whenever I T should die, to make a Skeleton of the Bones, stuff the Hide, and shew them for three Pence; and thus get Vengeance for the Injuries he had suffer'd by the owner.</P>
<P>Of the like Spirit too often is that implacable Race of Wits, against whom there is no Defence
<PB N="145" REF="145"/>
but Innocence and Philosophy, neither of which is likely to be at Hand, and therefore the Wound∣ed have no where to fly for a Cure, but to down∣right Stupidity, a crazed Head, or a profligate Contempt of Guilt and Shame.</P>
<P>I am therefore sorry for that other miserable Creature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d V<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t</HI> A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n, who spoke against the Libel in the Privy Council, and likewise in the House of Lords.</NOTE><HI>Traulus,</HI> who altho' of somewhat a dif∣ferent Species, yet seems very far to out-do even the Genius of <HI>Pistorides</HI> in that miscarrying Talent of Railing without Consistency or Discretion, against the most innocent Persons, according to the present Situation of his Gall and Spleen. I do not blame an <HI>honest</HI> Gentleman for the bitterest Invectives against one to whom he professeth the greatest Friendship, provided he acts in the Dark, so as not to be discovered; but in the midst of <HI>Caresses, Visits,</HI> and <HI>Invitations,</HI> to run into the Streets, or to <HI>as publick a Place,</HI> and without the least pretended Incitement, sputter out the basest and falsest Accusations, then to wipe his Mouth, come up smiling to his Friend, shake him by the Hand, and tell him in a Whisper, it was <HI>all for his Service:</HI> This Proceeding I am bold to think a great Failure in Prudence, and I am afraid lest such a Practitioner, with a Body so <HI>open,</HI> so <HI>foul,</HI> and <HI>so full of Sores,</HI> may fall under the Resentmen of an incens'd political <HI>Surgeon,</HI> who is not in much Renown for his Mercy upon great Provocation, who without waiting for his Death, will flay and dissect him alive, and to the View of Mankind lay open all the disorder'd Cells of his Brain, the Vonom of his Tongue, the Corruption of his
<PB N="146" REF="146"/>
Heart, and Spots and Flatuses of his Spleen—and all this for three Pence.</P>
<P>In such a Case, what a Scene would be laid open? And to drop my Metaphor, what a Cha∣racter of our mistaken Friend might an angry Enemy draw and expose? Particularizing that unnatural Conjunction of Vices and Follies so in∣consistent with each other in the same Breast: Furious and fawning, scurrilous and flattering, cowardly and provoking, insolent and abject; most profligately salse, with the strongest Profes∣sions of Sincerity; positive and variable, tyran∣nical and slavish.</P>
<P>In vain would his Excusers endeavour to pal∣liate his Enormities, by imputing them to Mad∣ness, beause it is well knowm, that Madness on∣ly operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil Dispositions of the Mind; for the Curators of <HI>Bedlam</HI> assure us, that some Lunaticks are Persons of <HI>Honour, Truth, Benevolence,</HI> and ma∣ny other Virtues, which appear in their highest Ravings, although after a wild incoherent Man∣ner, while others on the contrary discover in every Word and action the utmost <HI>Baseness</HI> and Depravity of human Minds; which infallibly they possessed in the same Degree, although per∣haps under a better Regulation, before their En∣trance into that <HI>Academy.</HI></P>
<P>But it may be objected, that there is an Argu∣ment of much more Force to excuse the Over∣flowings of that zeal which our <HI>Friend</HI> shews or means for our Cause. And it must be confessed, that the <HI>easy and smooth Fluency of his Elocution bestowed on him by Nature, and cultivated by</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
<HI>continual Practice,</HI> added to the <HI>Comelyness of his Person, the Harmony of his Voice,</HI> the <HI>Graceful∣ness of his Manner,</HI> and the <HI>Decency of his Dress,</HI> are Temptations too strong for such a Genius to resist upon any publick Occasion of making them appear with <HI>universal Applause.</HI> And if good Men are sometimes accused of loving their <HI>Jest</HI> better than their <HI>Friend,</HI> surely to gain the Reputation of the first <HI>Orator</HI> in the Kingdom, no Man of Spirit would scruple to lose all the <HI>Friends</HI> he had in the World.</P>
<P>It is usual for Masters to make their Boys de∣claim on both Sides of an Argument; and as some kinds of Assemblies are called the <HI>Schools of Principles,</HI> I confess nothing can better improve political School-Boys, than the Art of making plausible or implausible Harangues against the very Opinion for which they resolve to determine.</P>
<P>So Cardinal <HI>Perron,</HI> after having spoke for an Hour to the Admiration of all his Hear∣ers, to prove the Existence of God, told some of his Intimates, that he could have spoken another Hour, and much better, to prove the contrary.</P>
<P>To return from this long Digression: If Persons in high Sations have been allow'd to chuse Mistresses, without Regard even to Dif∣ference in Religion, yet never incurred the least Reflection on their Loyalty or their Protestan∣tism; shall the chief Govenour of a great Kingdom be censured for chusing a <HI>Companion,</HI> who may formerly have been suspected for dif∣fering from the <HI>Orthodox</HI> in some speculative Opinions of Persons and Things, which cannot
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
affect the fundamental Principles of a sound <HI>Whig?</HI></P>
<P>But let me suppose a very possible Case. Here is a Person sent to govern <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose unfortunate weak Side it happens to be, for se∣veral Reasons abovemention'd, that he hath en∣couraged the Attendance of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> Gentle∣men distinguished for their Taste, their Wit, and their Learning; who have taken the Oaths to his Majesty, and pray heartily for him; yet, because they may perhaps be stigmatized as <HI>quondam</HI> Tories by <HI>Pistorides</HI> and his Gang, his Excellency must be forced to banish them under the Pain and Peril of displeasing the Zea∣lots of his own Party, and thereby, be put into a worse Condition than every common Good∣fellow; who may be a sincere <HI>Protestant,</HI> and a loyal Subject; and yet rather chuse to drink fine Ale at the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Head,</HI> than muddy at the <HI>King</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Let me then return to my Supposition. It is certain, the High-flown Loyalists in the <HI>pre∣sent</HI> Sense of the Word, have their Thoughts, and Studies, and Tongues, so entirely diverted by political Schemes, that the Zeal of their <HI>Principles</HI> hath <HI>eaten up</HI> their Understandings; neither have they Time from their Employ∣ments, their Hopes, and their hourly Labours, for acquiring new Additions of Merit; to amuse themselves with philological Converse, or Specu∣lations which are utterly ruinous to all Schemes of rising in the World: What must then a Great Man do, whose ill Stars have fatally per∣verted him to a Love, and Taste, and Posses∣sion
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
of Literature, Politeness and good Sense? Our thorough-sped Republick of <HI>Whigs,</HI> which contains the Bulk of all <HI>Hopers, Pretenders, Expectors</HI> and <HI>Possessors,</HI> are, beyond all Doubt, most <HI>highly useful</HI> to Princes, to Govenours, to great Ministers, and to their Country; but at the same Time, and by necessary Consequence, the most disagreable Companions to all who have that unfortunate Turn of Mind peculiar to his Excellency, and perhaps to five or six more in a Nation.</P>
<P>I do not deny it possible, that an Original or Proselyte Favourer of the Times might have been born to these useless Talents, which in for∣mer Ages qualified a Man to be a Poet, or a Philosopher. All I contend for is, that where the true Genius of Party once enters, it <HI>sweeps the House clean,</HI> and leaves Room for many <HI>other Spirits,</HI> to take joint Possession 'till the <HI>last State of that Man is exceedingly better than the first.</HI></P>
<P>I allow it a great Error in his Excellency, that he adheres so obstinately to his old unfa∣shionable academick Education: Yet so per∣verse is human Nature, that the usual Reme∣dies for this Evil in others, have produced a contrary Effect in him; to a Degree that I am credibly informed, he will, as I have already hinted, in the Middle of a Session, quote Pas∣sages out of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Pindar</HI> at his own Ta∣ble to some <HI>Book-learn'd</HI> Companion without Blushing, even when Persons of <HI>great Stations</HI> are by.</P>
<P>I will venture one Step farther, which is, freely to confess, that this mistaken Method of
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
educating Youth in the Knowledge of ancient Learning and Language, is too apt to spoil their <HI>Politicks</HI> and <HI>Principles?</HI> because, the Doctrine and Examples of the Books they read, teach them Lessons <HI>directly contrary in every Point</HI> to the <HI>present Practice</HI> of the World: And ac∣cordingly, <HI>Hobbes</HI> most judiciously observes, that the Writings of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> made young Men imbibe Opinions against <HI>ab∣solute Power</HI> in a <HI>Prince,</HI> or even in a first <HI>Mi∣nister,</HI> and to embrace Notions of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been therefore a great Felicity to these Kingdoms, that the Heirs to Titles and large Estates have a Weakness in their Eyes, and a Tenderness in their Constitutions, are not able to bear the Pain and Indignity of Whip∣ping, and, as the Mother rightly expresses it, could never take to their Books; yet are well enough qualified to sign a Receipt for half a Year's Rent, to put their Name <HI>(rightly spelt)</HI> to a Warrant, and to read Pamphlets against <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>High-Flying;</HI> whereby they fill their Niches, and carry themselves through the World with that Dignity which best becomes a Senator, and a <HI>Squire.</HI></P>
<P>I could heartily wish his Excellency would be more condescending to the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Kingdom he Governs, to the Condition of the Times, and to the Nature of the Station he sills. Yet if it be true, what I have read in old <HI>En∣glish</HI> Story-Books, that one <HI>Agesilaus</HI> (no Matter to the Bulk of my Readers whether I spell the Name right or wrong) was caught by the <HI>Parson</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
<HI>of the Parish,</HI> riding on a Hobby-Horse with his Children; that <HI>Socrates</HI> a <HI>Heathen</HI> Philosopher was found dancing by himself at Fourscore; that a King called <HI>Caesar Augustus</HI> (or some such Name) used to play with Boys, whereof some might possibly be Sons of <HI>Tories;</HI> and two great Men called <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius</HI> (I forget their <HI>Christian</HI> Names, and whether they were Poets or Generals,) often play'd at Duck and Drake with smooth Stones on a River: Now, I say, if these Facts be true, (and the Book where I found them is in Print) I cannot ima∣gine why our most zealous Patriots may not a little indulge his Excellency, in an Infirmity which is not mortally Evil, provided he gives no publick Scandal (which is by all Means to be avoided:) I say, why he may not be indulged twice a Week to converse with one or two par∣ticular Persons, and let him and them conn over their old <HI>exploded</HI> Readings together, after Mornings spent in hearing and prescribing Ways and Means from and to his <HI>most obedient</HI> Politicians for the Welfare of the Kingdom; although the said particular Person or Persons may not have made so publick a Declaration of their political Faith in all its Parts, as the Busi∣ness of the Nation requires; still submitting my Opinion to that <HI>happy Majority,</HI> which I am confident is <HI>always in the right;</HI> by whom the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Subject hath been so frequently, so strenuously, and so successfully asserted; who by their wise Councils have made <HI>Commerce</HI> to flourish, <HI>Money</HI> to abound, <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to in∣crease,
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
the <HI>Value</HI> of <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Rents</HI> to rise, and the whole Island put on a new Face of <HI>Plenty</HI> and Prosperity.</P>
<P>But in order to clear his Excellency more fully from this Accusation of shewing his Fa∣vours to <HI>High-flyers, Tories</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> it will be necessary to come to Particulars.</P>
<P>The first Person of a <HI>Tory</HI> Denomination, to whom his Excellency gave any Marks of his Fa∣vour, was Doctor <HI>Thomas Sheridan.</HI> It is to be observed, that this happened so early in his Exellency's Government, as it may be justly supposed he had not been informed of that Gentleman's Character upon so <HI>dangerous</HI> an Article. The Doctor being well known and di∣stinguish'd for his Skill and Success in the Edu∣cation of Youth, beyond most of his Profession for many Years past; was recommended to his Excellency on the Score of his Learning, and particularly for his Knowledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, whereof it seems his Excellency is a great Admirer, although for what Reasons I could never imagine. However it is agreed on all Hands, that his Lordship was too easily pre∣vail'd on by the Doctor's Request, or indeed rather from the Biass of his own Nature, to hear a Tragedy acted in that <HI>unknown</HI> Lan∣guage by the Doctor's Lads, which was written by some <HI>Heathen</HI> Author; but whether it con∣tained any <HI>Tory</HI> or <HI>High-Church</HI> Principles, must be left to the Consciences of the <HI>Boys,</HI> the <HI>Doctor,</HI> and his Excellency; the only Witnesses in this Case whose Testimonies can be depended upon.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="153"/>
It seems, his Excellency (a Thing never to be sufficiently wonder'd at) was so pleas'd with his entertainment, that some Time after he gave the Doctor a Church Living, to the Value al∣most of one Hundred Pounds a Year, and made him one of his Chaplains, from an <HI>antiquated</HI> Notion, that good Schoolmasters ought to be encouraged in every Nation professing Civility and Religion. Yet his Excellency did not ven∣ture to make this bold Step without strong Re∣commendations from Persons of undoubted Principles <HI>fitted to the Times;</HI> who thought themselves bound in Justice, Honour and Gra∣titude, to do the Doctor a good Office in Re∣turn for the Care he had taken of their Chil∣dren, or those of their Friends. Yet the Ca∣tastrophe was terrible; for the Doctor in the Height of his Felicity and Gratitude, going down to take Possession of his Parish, and fur∣nished with a few led Sermons, whereof, as it is to be supposed, the Number was very small, having never served a Cure in the Church; he stopp'd at <HI>Cork</HI> to attend on his Bishop, and going to Church on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, was, according to the usual Civility of Country Cler∣gymen, invited by the Minister of the Parish to supply the Pulpit. It happened to be the first of <HI>August;</HI> and the first of <HI>August</HI> happened that Year to light upon a <HI>Sunday:</HI> And it hap∣pened, that the Doctor's Text was in these Words; <HI>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> And lastly, it happened, that some one Person of the Congregation, whose Loyalty
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
made him watchful upon every Appearance of Danger to his Majesty's Person and Govern∣ment, when Service was over, gave the Alarm. Notice was immediately sent up to Town, and by the Zeal of one Man, of no large Di∣mensions of Body or Mind, such a clamour was raised, that we in <HI>Dublin</HI> could apprehend no less than an Invasion by the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who must be landed in the South. The Result was, that the Doctor must be struck out of the Chaplains List, and appear no more at the Castle. Yet, whether he were then, or be at this Day a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory,</HI> I think is a Secret; only it is manifest, that he is a zealous <HI>Hanoverian,</HI> at least in Poetry, and a great Adorer of the pre∣sent Royal Family thro' all its Branches; his Friends likewise assert, that he had preached this same Sermon often, under the same Text; that not having observed the Words 'till he was in the Pulpit, and had opened his Notes, as he is a Person a little abstracted, he wanted Pre∣sence of Mind to change them: And that in the whole Sermon there was not a Syllable relating to Government or Party, or to the Subject of the Day.</P>
<P>In this Incident there seems to have been an Union of Events that will probably never hap∣pen again to the End of the World, or at least, like the grand Conjunction in the Heavens, which, I think, they say can arrive but once in twenty Thousand Years.</P>
<P>The second Gentleman (if I am right in my Chronology) who under the Suspicion of a <HI>Tory</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
received some Favour from his Excellency, is Mr. <HI>James Stopford,</HI> very strongly recommend∣ed by the most eminent <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> on the Account of his Learning and Virtue, and other Accomplishments: He had pass'd the greatest Part of his Youth in close Study, or in travelling; and was either not at Home or not at Leisure to trouble his Thoughts about Party, which I allow to be a great Omission; tho' I cannot honestly place him in the List of <HI>Tories,</HI> and therefore think his Excellency may be fair∣ly acquitted for making him Vicar of <HI>Finglass,</HI> worth about one Hundred and fifty Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>The third is Doctor <HI>Patrick Delany;</HI> this Divine lies under some Disadvantage, having in his Youth received many Civilities from a certain Person<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps,</HI> Lord Chancellor of Ire∣land when Queen <HI>Anne</HI> died.</NOTE> then in a very high Station here, for which Reason I doubt the Doctor ne∣ver <HI>drunk his Confusion</HI> since; and what makes the Matter desperate, it is now too late; un∣less our Inquisitors will be content with drinking <HI>Confusion</HI> to his <HI>Memory.</HI> The aforesaid emi∣nent Person who was a Judge of all Merit but <HI>Party,</HI> distinguished the Doctor among other Juniors in our University, for his Learning, Virtue, Discretion, and good Sense; but the Doctor was then in too good a Situation at his College to hope or endeavour at a better Esta∣blishment from one who had no Power to give it him.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="156"/>
Upon the present Lord Lieutenant's coming over, the Doctor was named to his Exdellency by a Friend, among other Clergymen of Di∣stinction, as Persons whose Characters it was proper his Excellency should know: And by the Truth of which the Giver would be content to stand or fall in his Excellency's Opinion; since not one of those Persons were in particular Friendship with the Gentlemen who gave in their Names: By this and some other Incidents, particularly the Recommendation of the late Archbishop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Doctor became known to his Excellency, whose fatal Turn of Mind towards <HI>heathenish</HI> and <HI>outlandish</HI> Books and Languages, finding, as I conceive, a like Disposition in the Doctor, was the Cause of his becoming so domestick as we are told he is, at the Castle of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>Three or four Years ago, the Doctor, grown weary of an Academick Life, for some Rea∣sons best known to the Managers of the Disci∣pline in that learned Society (which it may not be for their Honour to mention) resolved to leave it, although by the Benefit of his Pupils, and his Senior-fellowship with all its Perquisites, he received every Year between nine Hundred and a Thousand Pounds. And a small Nor∣thern Living, in the University's Donation, of somewhat better than a hundred Pounds a Year, falling at the same Time with the Chancellor∣ship of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> to about equal Value, in the Gist of his Excellency, the Doctor ventured into the World in a very scanty Condition, ha∣ving
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
squander'd away all his annual Income in a manner, which although perhaps proper enough for a Clergyman without a Family, will not be for the Advantage of his Character to discover either on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or at a Bank∣er's Shop.</P>
<P>About two Months ago, his Excellency gave the Doctor a Prebend in St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cathe∣dral, which being of near the same Value with either of the two former will add a third Part to his Revenues, after he shall have paid the great Incumbrances upon it; so that he may now be said to possess of Church Preserments, in scattered Tythes, three hundred Pounds a Year, instead of the like Sum of infallible Rents from a senior Fellowship with the Offices annexed; besides the Advantage of a free Lodging, and some other Easements. But since the Doctor hath not in any of his Writings, his Sermons, his Actions, his Discourse, or his Company, discovered one single Principle of either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and that the Lord Lieu∣tenant still continues to admit him, I shall bold∣ly pronounce him <HI>one of us;</HI> but like a new <HI>Free-Mason,</HI> who hath not yet learned all the Dialect of the Mystery. Neither can he justly be accused of any <HI>Tory</HI> Doctrines, except per∣haps some among those few, with which that <HI>wicked Party</HI> was charged during the Height of their Power, but have been since transferred for the most <HI>solid Reasons</HI> to the <HI>whole Body</HI> of our firmest Friends. I have now done with the Clergy, and upon the strictest Examination,
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
have not been able to find above one of that Order, against whom any <HI>Party</HI> Suspicion can lie, which is the unfortunate Gentleman Dr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> who by mere Chance-medly shot his own Fortune dead with a single Text.</P>
<P>As to the Laity, I can hear of but one Per∣son of the <HI>Tory</HI> Stamp, who since the Beginning of his Excellency's Government, did ever re∣ceive any solid Mark of his Favour, I mean Sir <HI>Arthur Acheson,</HI> reported to be an acknow∣ledged <HI>Tory,</HI> and, what is almost as bad, a <HI>Scholar</HI> into the Bargain. It is whisper'd a∣bout as a certain Truth, that this Gentleman is to have a Grant of a certain Barrack upon his Estate within two Miles of his own House, for which the Crown is to be his Tenant, at the Rent of sixty Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> he being only at the Expence of about <HI>five hundred</HI> Pounds, to put the House in Repair, build Stables, and other Necessaries. I will place this <HI>invidious</HI> Mark of Beneficence, conferred on a <HI>Tory</HI> in a fair Light, by computing the Costs and necessary Defalcations; after which it may be seen how much <HI>Sir Arthur</HI> will be annually a clear Gainer by the Publick, not∣withstanding his <HI>unfortunate</HI> Principles, and his Knowledge in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI></P>

<P>Thus, if Sir <HI>Arthur Acheson</HI> shall have the good Fortune to obtain a Grant of this Barrack, he will receive neat Profit annually from the Crown Eleven Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to help him in entertaining the Officers, and making Provision for his younger Children.</P>
<P>It is true, there is another Advantage to be expected, which may fully compensate the Loss of Cattle and Poultry; by multiplying the Breed of Mankind; and particularly of <HI>good Prote∣stants</HI> in a Part of the Kingdom half depopula∣ted by the wild Humour among the Farmers thereof leaving their Country. But I am not so skilful in Arithmetick, as to compute the Value.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160"/>
I have reckoned one <HI>per Cent.</HI> below the le∣gal Interest for the Money that Sir <HI>Arthur</HI> must expend: And valued the Damage in the other Articles very moderately.

<P>Thus I have with the utmost Impartiality col∣lected every single Favour, (further than per∣sonal Civilities) conferred by his Excellency on <HI>Tories,</HI> and reputed <HI>Tories,</HI> since his first Arri∣val hither, to this present 13th Day of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1730, giving all Allow∣ance possible to the Arguments on the other Side of the Question.</P>

Value of the Favours done by his Excellency to the <HI>true Friends</HI> of their King and Country, and of the <HI>Protestant Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be remembered, that although his Excellency cannot be properly said to bestow Bishopricks, Commands in the Army, the Place of a Judge, or Commissioner in the Re∣venue, and some others; yet they are, for the most Part, disposed upon his Recommendation, except where the Persons are immediately sent from <HI>England</HI> by their Interest at Court, for which I have allowed large Defalcations in the following Accounts. And it is remarkable that the <HI>only</HI> considerable Station conferred on a re∣puted <HI>Tory</HI> since his present Excellency's Go∣vernment was of this <HI>latter</HI> Kind.</P>
<P>And indeed it is but too remarkable, that in a neighbouring Nation (where that dangerous Denomination of Men is incomparably more numerous, more powerful, and of Consequence more formidable) <HI>real Tories</HI> can often with much less Difficulty obtain very high Favours from the Government, than their <HI>reputed</HI> Bre∣thren can arrive to the lowest in ours. I observe this with all possible Submission to the Wisdom of their Policy, which, however, will not, I believe, dispute the Praise of Vigilance with ours.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE Fates of CLERGYMEN.</HEAD>
<P>THere is no <HI>Talent</HI> so useful towards rising in the World, or which puts Men more out of the Reach of Fortune, than that Quality ge∣nerally possessed by the dullest Sort of People, and is in common Speech called <HI>Discretion,</HI> a Species of lower Prudence, by the Assistance of which, People of the meanest Intellectuals, without any other Qualification, pass through the World in great Tranquility, and with uni∣versal good Treatment, neither giving nor ta∣king Offence. <HI>Courts</HI> are seldom unprovided of Persons under this Character, on whom, if they happen to be of great Quality, most Employ∣ments, even the Greatest naturally fall, when Competitors will not agree; and in such Promo∣tions, no Body rejoices or grieves. The Truth of this I could prove by several Instances, with∣in my own Memory (for I say nothing of the present Times.)</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="165"/>
And indeed, as Regularity and Forms are of great Use in carrying on the Business of the World, so it is very convenient, that Persons en∣dued with this Kind of Discretion, should have that Share which is proper to their Talents in the Conduct of Affairs, but by no means to meddle in Matters which require <HI>Genius, Learning, strong Comprehension, Quickness of Conception, Magnanimity, Generosity, Sagacity,</HI> or any other superior Gift of human Minds. Because this sort of <HI>Discretion,</HI> is usually attend∣ed with a strong Desire of Money, and few Scruples about the Way of obtaining it, with servile Flattery and Submission, with a Want of all publick Spirit or Principle, with a perpe∣tual wrong Judgment when the Owners come into Power and high Place, how to dispose of Favour and Preferment; having no Measure for Merit and Virtue in others, but those very Steps by which themselves ascended; nor the least Intention of doing Good or Hurt to the Publick, farther than either one or t'other, is likely to be subservient to their own Security or Interest. Thus being void of all Friendship and Enmity, they never complain nor find Fault with the Times, and indeed never have Reason to do so.</P>
<P>Men of eminent Parts and Abilities, as well as Virtues, do sometimes rise in the <HI>Courts,</HI> sometimes in the <HI>Law,</HI> and sometimes, even in the <HI>Church.</HI> Such were the Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and others in our own Times, whom I shall not name; but these, and
<PB N="166" REF="166"/>
many more, under different Princes, and in dif∣ferent Kingdoms, were <HI>Disgraced</HI> or <HI>Banished</HI> or <HI>suffered Death,</HI> merely in Envy to their Vir∣tues and superior <HI>Genius,</HI> which emboldened them in great Exigencies and Distresses of State (wanting a reasonable Infusion of this Aldermanly Discretion) to attempt the Service of their Prince and Country out of the common Forms.</P>
<P>This evil Fortune, which generally attends extraordinary Men in the Management of great Affairs, hath been imputed to divers Causes, that need not be here set down, when so obvious an One occurs; if what a certain Writer ob∣serves, be true, that <HI>when a great Genius appears in the World, the Dunces are all in Confederacy against him.</HI> And thus although he employs his <HI>Talents</HI> wholly in his Closet, without interfering with any Man's Ambition or Avarice; what must he expect when he ventures out to seek for Preferment in a Court, but universal Opposition when he is mounting the Ladder, and every Hand ready to turn him off, when he is at the Top? And in this Point Fortune generally acts directly contrary to Nature; for in Nature we find, that Bodies full of Life and Spirits mount easily, and are hard to fall, whereas heavy Bodies are hard to rise, and come down with greater Velocity, in Proportion to their Weight; but we find Fortune every day acting just the Reverse of this.</P>
<P>This Talent of <HI>Discretion,</HI> as I have described it in its several Adjuncts and Circumstances, is no where so serviceable as to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> to whose Preserment nothing is so fatal as the
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
Character of Wit, Politeness in Reading, or Manners, or that Kind of Behaviour which we contract by having too much conversed with Persons of high Stations and Eminency; these Qualifications being reckoned by the <HI>Vulgar</HI> of <HI>all Ranks,</HI> to be Marks of <HI>Levity,</HI> which is the last Crime the World will pardon in a <HI>Cler∣gyman:</HI> To this I may add a free Manner of Speaking in mixt Company, and too frequent an Appearance in Places of much Resort, which are equally noxious, to spiritual Promotions.</P>
<P>I have known indeed a few Exceptions to some Parts of these Regulations. I have seen some of the dullest Men alive aiming at Wit, and others with as little Pretensions affecting Politeness in Manners and Discourse; but never being able to persuade the World of their Guilt, they grew into considerable Stations, upon the firm Assurance which all People had of their <HI>Discretion,</HI> because they were a Size too low to deceive the World to their own Disadvantage. But this I confess is a Tryal too dangerous often to engage in.</P>
<P>There is a known Story of a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> who was recommended for a Preferment by some great Men at Court, to an Archbishop. His Grace, said he had heard that the <HI>Clergyman</HI> used to play at Whisk and Swobbers; that as to playing now and then a sober Game at Whisk for Pastime, it might be pardoned, but he could not digest those wicked Swobbers, and it was with some Pains that my Lord <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rs</HI> could undeceive him. I ask, by what Talents we may suppose that great Prelate ascend so

high, or what sort of Qualifications he would expect in those whom he took into his Patron∣age, or would probably recommend to Court for the Government of <HI>Distant Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Two <HI>Clergymen</HI> in my Memory stood Candi∣dates for a small <HI>Free-School</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>Shire,</HI> where a Gentleman of Quality and Interest in the Country, who happened to have a better Un∣derstanding than his Neighbours, procured the Place for him who was the better Scholar, and more gentlemanly Person of the two, very much to the Regret of all the Parish; the other being disappointed came up to <HI>London,</HI> where he became the greatest Pattern of this lower <HI>Discretion</HI> that I have known, and pos∣sessed with as heavy Intellectuals; which toge∣ther with the Coldness of his Temper, and Gravity of his Deportment, carried him safe through many Difficulties, and he lived and died in a great Station, while his Competitor is too obscure for Fame to tell us what become of him.</P>
<P>This Species of <HI>Discretion,</HI> which I so much celebrate, and do most heartily recommend, hath one Advantage not yet mentioned, that it will carry a Man safe through all the Malice and Variety of Parties, so far, that whatever Faction happens to be uppermost, his Claim is usually allowed for a Share of what is going. And the Thing seems to me highly reasonable: For in all great Changes, the prevailing Side is usually so tempestuous, that it wants the Ballast of those, whom the World calls <HI>Moderate Men,</HI> and I call <HI>Men of Discretion,</HI> whom People in
<PB N="169" REF="169"/>
Power may with little Ceremony load as heavy as they please, drive them through the hardest and deepest Roads without Danger of found'∣ring, or breaking their Backs, and will be sure to find them neither rusty nor vicious.</P>
<P>I will here give the Reader a short History of two <HI>Clergymen</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the Characters of each, and the Progress of their Fortunes in the World; by which the Force of worldly Discretion, and the bad Consequences from the Want of that Virtue will strongly appear.</P>
<P><HI>Corusodes,</HI> an <HI>Oxford</HI> Student, and a Farmer's Son, was never absent from Prayers or Lecture, nor once out of his <HI>College</HI> after <HI>Tom</HI> had toll'd. He spent every Day ten Hours in his Closet, in reading his Courses, Dozing, clipping Papers, or darning his Stockings, which last he per∣formed to Admiration. He could be soberly drunk at the Expence of others, with <HI>College</HI> Ale, and at those Seasons was always most de∣vout. He wore the same Gown five Years, without dragling or tearing. He never once look'd into a Play-book or a Poem. He read <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ramus</HI> in the same Cadence, but with a very different Taste. He never un∣derstood a Jest, or had the least Conception of Wit.</P>
<P>For one Saying he stands in Renown to this Day. Being with some other Students over a Pot of Ale, one of the Company said so many pleasant Things, that the rest were much di∣verted, only <HI>Corusodes</HI> was silent and unmoved. When they parted, he called this merry Com∣panion
<PB N="170" REF="170"/>
aside, and said, <HI>Sir, I preceive by your often speaking, and our Friends Laughing, that you spoke many Jests, and you could not but observe my Silence. But, Sir, this is my Ho∣mour, I never make a Jest myself, nor ever laugh at another Man's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Corusodes</HI> thus endowed got into Holy Orders, having by the most extreme Parsimony saved thirty four Pounds out of a very beggarly Fel∣lowship, went up to <HI>London,</HI> where his Sister was waiting Woman to a Lady, and so good a Sollicitor, that by her Means he was admitted to read Prayers in the Family twice a Day, at fourteen Shillings a Month. He had now ac∣quired a low, obsequious, awkward Bow, and a Talent of gross Flattery, both in and out of Season; he would shake the Butler by the Hand; he taught the Page his <HI>Catechism,</HI> and was sometimes admitted to dine at the Stew∣ard's Table. In short, he got the good Word of the whole Family, and was recommended by my Lady for Chaplain to some other Noble House, by which his Revenue (beside Vales) amounted to about thirty Pounds a Year; his Sister procured him a Scarf from my Lord (who had a small Design of Gallantry upon her;) and by his Lordship's Sollicitation he got a Lectureship in Town of sixty Pounds a Year; where he preached constantly in Person, in a grave Manner, with an audible Voice, a Style Ecclesiastick, and the Matter (such as it was) well suited to the Intellectuals of his Hearers. Some time after a Country Living fell in my Lord's Disposal, and his Lordship, who had
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
now some Encouragement given him of Success in his Amour, bestow'd the Living on <HI>Coru∣sodes,</HI> who still kept his Lectureship and Resi∣dence in Town, where he was a constant At∣tendant at all Meetings relating to Charity, without ever contributing further than his fre∣quent pious Exhortations. If any Women of better Fashion in the Parish happened to be absent from Church, they were sure of a Visit from him in a Day or two, to chide and to dine with them.</P>
<P>He had a select Number of Poor, constantly attending at the Street Door of his Lodgings, for whom he was a common Sollicitor to his for∣mer Patroness, dropping in his own Half-Crown among the Collections, and taking it out when he disposed of the Money. At a Person of Quality's House, he would never sit down 'till he was thrice bid, and then upon the Corner of the most distant Chair. His whole Demeanor was formal and starched, which adhered so close, that he could never Shake it off in his highest Promotion.</P>
<P>His Lord was now in high Employment at Court, and attended by him with the most ab∣ject Assiduity, and his Sister being gone off with Child to a private Lodging, my Lord continued his Graces to <HI>Corusodes,</HI> got him to be a Chap∣lain in Ordinary, and in due Time a Parish in Town, and a <HI>Dignity in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>He paid his <HI>Curates</HI> punctually, at the lowest Sallary, and partly out of the Communion-Money; but gave them good Advice in Abun∣dance. He married a Citizen's Widow, who
<PB N="172" REF="172"/>
taught him to put out small Sums at <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> and brought him acquainted with Jobbers in <HI>Change-Alley.</HI> By her Dexterity, he sold the Clarkship of his Parish, when it became vacant.</P>
<P>He kept a miserable House, but the Blame was laid wholly upon <HI>Madam;</HI> for the good Doctor was always at his <HI>Books,</HI> or visiting the Sick, or doing other Offices of Charity and Pi∣ety in his Parish.</P>
<P>He treated all his Inferiors of the Clergy with a most sanctified Pride; was rigorously and universally censorious upon all his Brethren of the Gown, on their first Appearance in the World, or while they continued meanly pre∣ferred; but gave large Allowance to the Laiety of high Rank, or great Riches, using neither Eyes nor Ears for their Faults: He was never sensible of the least Corruption in <HI>Courts, Par∣liaments</HI> or <HI>Ministries,</HI> but made the most fa∣vourable Constructions of all publick Proceed∣ings; and Power, in whatever Hands, or what∣ever Party, was always secure of his most cha∣ritable Opinion. He had many wholesome Maxims ready to excuse all Miscarriages of State; <HI>Men are but Men; Erunt vitia donee homines;</HI> and <HI>Quod supra nos, nil ad nos;</HI> with several others of equal Weight.</P>
<P>It would lengthen my Paper beyond Measure to trace out the whole System of his Conduct; his dreadful Apprehensions of <HI>Popery;</HI> his great Moderation towards Dissenters of all De∣nominations; with hearty Wishes, that by yielding somewhat on both Sides, there might
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
be a general Union among Protestants; his short, inoffensive Sermons in his Turns at Court, and the Matter exactly suited to the present Juncture of prevailing Opinions. The Arts he used to obtain a Mitre, by writing against Epis∣copacy, and the Proofs he gave of his Loyalty, by palliating or defending the Murder of a mar∣tyr'd Prince.</P>
<P>Endowed with all these Accomplishments, we leave him in the full Career of Success, mounting fast towards the Top of the Ladder Ecclesiastical, which he hath a fair Probability to reach, without the Merit of one single Vir∣tue, moderately stocked with the least valuable Parts of Erudition, utterly devoid of all <HI>Taste, Judgment,</HI> or <HI>Genius,</HI> and in his Grandeur na∣turally chusing to hawl up others after him, whose Accomplishments most resemble his own, except his beloved Sons, Nephews, or other Kindred, be not in Competition; or lastly, ex∣cept his Inclinations be diverted by those who have Power to mortify or further advance him.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio</HI> set out from the same University, and about the same Time with <HI>Corusodes;</HI> he had the Reputation of an arch Lad at School, and was unfortunately possessed with a <HI>Talent</HI> for <HI>Poetry,</HI> on which Account he received many chiding Letters from his Father, and grave Ad∣vice from his Tutor. He did not neglect his College Learning, but his chief Study was the Authors of Antiquity, with a perfect Know∣ledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman Tongues.</HI> He could never procure himself to be chosen Fel∣low; for it was objected against him, that he 
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
had written Verses, and particularly some, wherein he glanced at a certain Reverend Doc∣tor, famous for Dulness; That he had been seen bowing to Ladies as he met them in the Streets; and it was proved, that once he had been found dancing in a private Family with half a dozen of both Sexes.</P>
<P>He was the younger Son to a Gentleman of a good Birth, but small Fortune, and his Father dying, he was driven to <HI>London,</HI> to seek his Fortune: He got into Orders, and became Reader in a Parish-Church at twenty Pounds a Year, was carried by an <HI>Oxford</HI> Friend to <HI>Will</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-House,</HI> frequented in those Days by Men of Wit, where, in some Time, he had the bad Luck to be distinguished. His scanty Sal∣lery compelled him to run deep in Debt for a new Gown and Cassock, and now and then forced him to write some Paper of Wit or Humour, or preach a Sermon for ten Shillings, to supply his Necessities. He was a thousand Times récom∣mended by his Poetical Friends to great Persons, as a young Man of excellent Parts, who deserved Encouragement, and received a thousand Pro∣mises; but his Modesty, and a generous Spirit, which disdained the Slavery of continual Ap∣plication and Attendance, always disappointed him, making room for vigilant Dunces, who were sure to be never out of Sight.</P>
<P>He had an excellent Faculty in preaching, if he were not sometimes a little too refined, and apt to trust too much to his own Way of think∣ing and reasoning.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="175"/>
When upon the Vacancy of Preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon some promi∣sing Lord, he received the usual Answer, that he came too late, for it had been given to ano∣ther the very Day before. And he had only this Comfort left, that every Body said, it was a thousand Pities, something could not be done for poor Mr. <HI>Eugenio.</HI></P>
<P>The Remainder of his Story will be dis∣patched in a few Words: Wearied with weak Hopes, and weaker Pursuits, he accepted a Cu∣racy in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> of thirty Pounds a Year, and when he was five and forty, had the great Felicity to be prefered by a Friend of his Fa∣ther's, to a Vicaridge worth annually sixty Pound, in the most desert Parts of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where, his Spirit quite sunk with those Reflections that Solitude and Disappointments bring, he married a Farmer's Widow, and is still alive, utterly un∣distinguished and forgotten, only some of the Neighbours have accidentally heard, <HI>that he had been a notable Man in his Youth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON <HI>Modern Education.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM frequently reflecting upon the Course and Method of educating Youth in this and a neighbouring Kingdom, with the ge∣neral Success and Consequence thereof, I am come to this Determination, That Education is always the <HI>worse</HI> in Proportion to the <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Grandeur</HI> of the Parents; nor do I doubt in the least, that if the whole World were now under the Dominion of <HI>one Monarch</HI> (provided I might be allowed to chuse <HI>where</HI> he should fix the Seat of his Empire) the only Son and Heir of that Monarch, would be the worst edu∣cated Mortal, that ever was born since the Crea∣tion; and I doubt, the same Proportion will hold through all Degrees and Titles, from an Emperor downwards, to the common Gentry.</P>
<P>I do not say, that this hath been always the Case; for in better Times it was directly other∣wise, and a Scholar may fill half his <HI>Greek</HI> and
<PB N="177" REF="177"/>
<HI>Roman</HI> Shelves with Authors of the noblest Birth, as well as highest Virtue: Nor, do I tax all Nations at present with this Defect, for I know there are some to be excepted, and parti∣cularly <HI>Scotland,</HI> under all the Disadvantages of its Climate and Soil, if that Happiness be not rather owing even to those very Disadvan∣tages. What is then to be done, if this Re∣flection must fix on two Countries, which will be most ready to take Offence, and which of all others it will be least prudent or safe to offend?</P>
<P>But there is one Circumstance yet more dan∣gerous and lamentable: For if, according to the <HI>Postulatum</HI> already laid down, the highest Qua∣lity any Youth is of, he is in greater Likely∣hood to be worse educated; it behoves me to dread, and keep far from the Verge of <HI>Scan∣dalum Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>Retracting therefore that hazardous <HI>Postula∣tum,</HI> I shall venture no further at present than to say, that perhaps some additional Care in educating the Sons of Nobility and principal Gentry, might not be ill employed. If this be not delivered with Softness enough, I must for the future be silent.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, let me ask only two Que∣stions, which relate to <HI>England.</HI> I ask first, how it comes about, that for above sixty Years past, the chief Conduct of Affairs hath been generally placed in the Hands of <HI>New-men,</HI> with very few Exceptions? The Noblest Blood of <HI>England</HI> having been shed in the grand Re∣bellion, many great Families became extinct, or supported only by Minors. When the King
<PB N="178" REF="178"/>
was restored, very few of those Lords remained, who began, or at least had improved their Edu∣cation, under the happy Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> or King <HI>Charles</HI> I. of which Lords the two principal were the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> The Minors have, or had, during the Rebellion and Usurpation, either received too much Tincture of bad Prin∣ciples from those fanatick Times, or coming to Age at the Restoration, fell into the Vices of that dissolute Reign.</P>
<P>I date from this Aera, the corrupt Method of Education among us, and the Consequence thereof, in the Necessity the Crown lay under of introducing <HI>New-men</HI> into the chief Conduct of publick Affairs, or to the Office of what we now call Prime Ministers, Men of Art, Know∣ledge, Application and Insinuation, merely for Want of a Supply among the Nobility. They were generally (though not always) of good Birth, sometimes younger Brothers, at other Times such, who, although inheriting good Estates, yet happened to be well educated, and provided with Learning; such under that King, were <HI>Hyde, Bridgeman, Clifford, Osborn, Go∣dolphin, Ashley-Cooper:</HI> Few or none under the short Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. Under King <HI>William; Sommers, Mountague, Churchil, Vernon, Boyle,</HI> and many others: Under the Queen; <HI>Harley, St. John, Harcourt, Tre∣vor,</HI> who indeed were Persons of the best pri∣vate Families, but unadorn'd with Titles. So in the following Reign, Mr. <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> was for many Years Prime Minister, in which
<PB N="179" REF="179"/>
Post he still happily continues: His Brother <HI>Horace</HI> is Ambassador Extraordinary to <HI>France.</HI> Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> and Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> without the least Allowance to support them, have been Secre∣taries of State.</P>
<P>If the Facts have been thus for above sixty Years past (whereof I could with a little fur∣ther Recollection produce many more Instances) I would ask again, how it hath happened, that in a Nation plentifully abounding with Nobility, so great Share in the most competent Parts of publick Management, hath been for so long a Period chiefly entrusted to Commoners, unless some Omissions or Defects of the highest Im∣port, may be charged upon those, to whom the Care of educating our Noble Youth had been committed? For, if there be any Diffe∣rence between human Creatures in the Point of natural Parts, as we usually call them, it should seem, that the Advantage lies on the Side of Children, born from noble and wealthy Parents; the same traditional Sloth and Luxury which render their Body weak and effeminate, per∣haps refining and giving a freer Motion to the Spirits, beyond what can be expected from the gross, robust Issue of meaner Mortals. Add to this, the peculiar Advantages, which all young Noblemen possess, by the Privileges of their Birth. Such as a free Access to Courts, and a universal deference paid to their Persons.</P>
<P>But as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> chargeth it for a Fault on Princes, that they are impatient to compass <HI>Ends,</HI> without giving themselves the Trouble of consulting or executing the <HI>Means:</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="180"/>
So, perhaps, it may be the Disposition of young Nobles, either from the Indulgence of Parents, Tutors and Governors, or their own Inactivity, that they expect the <HI>Accomplishments</HI> of a good Education, without the least Expence of <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Study,</HI> to acquire them.</P>
<P>What I said last, I am ready to retract; for the Case is infinitely worse; and the very Max∣ims set up to direct modern Education, are enough to destroy all the Seeds of Knowledge, Honour, Wisdom and Virtue among us. The current Opinion prevails, that the Study of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> is Loss of Time; that publick Schools, by mingling the Sons of Noblemen with those of the Vulgar, engage the former in bad Company; that Whipping breaks the Spirits of Lads well born; that Universities make young Men Pedants; that to dance, fence, speak <HI>French,</HI> and know how to behave your∣self among great Persons of both Sexes, com∣prehends <HI>the whole Duty of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but think this wise System of Edu∣cation, hath been much cultivated among us by those Worthies of the Army, who during the last War, returning from <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Close of each Campaign, became the Dictators of Behaviour, Dress, and Politeness, to all those Youngsters, who frequent Chocolate-Coffee-Gaming-Houses, Drawing-Rooms, Opera's, Levees and Assemblies; where a Colonel by his Pay, Perquisites and Plunder, was qualified to outshine many Peers of the Realm; and by the Influence of an <HI>exotick</HI> Habit and Demea∣nor, added to other foreign Accomplishments,
<PB N="181" REF="181"/>
gave the Law to the whole Town, and was co∣pyed as the Standard-Pattern of whatever was refined in Dress, Equipage, Conversation, or Diversions.</P>
<P>I remember in those Times, an admired Original of that Vocation, sitting in a Coffee∣house near two Gentlemen, whereof one was of the Clergy, who were engaged in some Dis∣course that savoured of Learning; this Officer thought fit to interpose, and professing to deli∣ver the Sentiments of his Fraternity, as well as his own (and probably did so of too many among them) turning to the Clergy-Man, spoke in the following Manner, <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n me, Doctor, say what you will, the Army is the only School for Gentlemen. Do you think my Lord</HI> Marl∣borough <HI>beat the</HI> French <HI>with</HI> Greek <HI>and</HI> La∣tin. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n me, a Scholar when he comes into good Company, what is he but an Ass? D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n me, I would be glad by G-d, to see any of your Scholars with his Nouns, and his Verbs, and his Philosophy, and Trigonometry, what a Fi∣gure he would make at a Siege or Blockade, or rencountring—D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n me,</HI> &amp;c. After which he proceeded with a Volley of Military Terms, less significant, sounding worse, and harder to be understood than any that were ever coined by the Commentators upon <HI>Aristotle.</HI> I would not here be thought to charge the Soldiery with Ignorance and Contempt of Learning, without allowing Exceptions, of which I have known many; but however, the worse Example, espe∣cially in a great Majority, will certainly prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="182"/>
I have heard, that the late Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the Time of his Ministry, never pass'd by <HI>White</HI>'s <HI>Chocolate-House</HI> (the common Rendez∣vous of infamous Sharpers, and Noble Cullies) without bestowing a Curse upon that famous Academy, as the Bane of half the <HI>English No∣bility.</HI> I have likewise been told another Pas∣sage concerning that great Minister, which, be∣cause it gives a humorous Idea of one principal Ingredient in modern Education, take as fol∣loweth. <HI>Le Sack,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Dancing∣master, in great Admiration, asked a Friend, whether it were true, that Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was made an Earl and Lord Treasurer? And finding it confirmed, said; <HI>Well, I wonder what the De∣vil the Queen could see in him; for I attended him two Years, and he was the greatest Dunce that ever I taught.</HI></P>
<P>Another Hindrance to good Education, and I think the greatest of any, is that pernicious Cu∣stom in rich and noble Families, of entertaining <HI>French</HI> Tutors in their Houses. These wretch∣ed <HI>Pedagogues</HI> are enjoyned by the Father, to take special Care that the Boy shall be perfect in his <HI>French;</HI> by the Mother, that <HI>Master</HI> must not walk 'till he is hot, nor be suffered to play with other Boys, nor be wet in his Feet, nor daub his Cloaths, and to see the Dancing∣master attends constantly, and does his Duty; she further insists, that the Child be not kept too long poring on his Book, because he is sub∣ject to sore eyes, and of a weakly Constitution.</P>
<P>By these Methods, the young Gentleman is in every Article as fully accomplished at eight
<PB N="183" REF="183"/>
Years old as at eight and twenty, Age adding only to the Growth of his Person and his Vice; so that if you should look at him in his Boy∣hood through the magnifying End of a Perspec∣tive, and in his Manhood through the other, it would be impossible to spy any Difference; the same Airs, the same Strutt, the same Cock of his Hat, and Posture of his Sword, (as far as the Change of Fashions will allow) the same Understanding, the same Compass of Know∣ledge, with the very same Absurdity, Impudence and Impertinence of Tongue.</P>
<P>He is taught from the Nursery, that he must inherit a great Estate, and hath no need to mind his Book, which is a Lesson he never forgets to the End of his Life. His chief So∣lace is to steal down and play at Span-farthing with the Page, or young Black-a-moor, or little favourite Foot-Boy, one of which is his prin∣cipal Confident and Bosom-Friend.</P>
<P>There is one young Lord in this Town, who, by an unexampled Piece of good Fortune, was miraculously snatched out of the Gulph of Ig∣norance, confined to a publick School for a due Term of Years, well whipped when he deserved it, clad no better than his Comrades, and al∣ways their Play-Fellow on the same Foot, had no Precedence in the School, but what was given him by his Merit, and lost it whenever he was negligent. It is well known how many Mu∣tinies were bred at this unprecedented Treat∣ment, what Complaints among his <HI>Relations,</HI> and other <HI>Great Ones</HI> of both Sexes; that his Stockings with silver Clocks were ravish'd from
<PB N="184" REF="184"/>
him; that he wore his own Hair; that his Dress was undistinguished; that he was not fit to appear at a Ball or Assembly, nor suffered to go to either: And it was with the utmost Diffi∣culty, that he became qualified for his present Removal, where he may probably be farther persecuted, and possibly with Success, if the Firmness of a very worthy Governor, and his own good Dispositions will not preserve him. I confess, I cannot but wish he may go on in the Way he began, because I have a Curiosity to know by so singular an Experiment, whether Truth, Honour, Justice, Temperance, Cou∣rage, and good Sense, acquired by a <HI>School</HI> and <HI>College</HI> Education, may not produce a very tolerable Lad, although he should happen to fail in one or two of those Accomplishments, which in the general Vogue are held so impor∣tant to the finishing of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>It is true, I have known an Academical Edu∣cation to have been exploded in publick As∣semblies; and have heard more than one or two Persons of high Rank declare, they could learn nothing more at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> than to drink Ale and smoke Tobacco; where∣in I firmly believed them, and could have ad∣ded some hundred Examples from my own Ob∣servation in one of those Universities; but they all were of young Heirs sent thither, only for Form; either from Schools, where they were not suffered by their careful Parents to stay a∣bove three Months in the Year; or from under the Management of <HI>French</HI> Family-Tutors, who yet often attended them to their <HI>College,</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="185"/>
to prevent all Possibility of their Improvement: But, I never yet knew any one Person of Quali∣ty, who followed his Studies at the University, and carried away his just Proportion of Learn∣ing, that was not ready upon all Occasions to celebrate and defend that Course of Education, and to prove a Patron of learned Men.</P>
<P>There is one Circumstance in a learned Edu∣cation, which ought to have much Weight, even with those who have no Learning at all. The Books read at <HI>School</HI> and <HI>Colleges,</HI> are full of Incitements to Virtue, and Discouragements from Vice, drawn from the wisest Reasons, the strongest Motives, and the most influencing Ex∣amples. Thus, young Minds are filled early with an Inclination to Good, and an Abhorrence of Evil, both which encrease in them, accord∣ing to the Advances they make in Literature; and, although they may be, and too often are, drawn by the Temptations of Youth, and the Opportunities of a large Fortune, into some Ir∣regularities, when they come forward into the great World, it is ever with Reluctance and Compunction of Mind, because their Byass to Virtue still continues. They may stray some∣times out of Infirmity or Compliance, but they will soon return to the right Road, and keep it always in View. I speak only of those Excesses, which are too much the Attendants of Youth and warmer Blood; for, as to the Points of Ho∣nour, Truth, Justice, and other noble Gifts of the Mind, wherein the Temperature of the Body hath no Concern, they are seldom or ever known to be mild.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="186"/>
I have engaged my self very unwarily in too copious a Subject for so short a Paper. The pre∣sent Scope I would aim at is to prove, that some Proportion of human Knowledge appears re∣quisite to those, who, by their Birth or Fortune, are called to the making of Laws, and in a sub∣ordinate Way to the Execution of them; and that such Knowledge is not to be obtained without a Miracle, under the frequent, corrupt, and sottish Methods, of educating those, who are born to Wealth or Titles. For, I would have it remembered, that I do by no Means confine these Remarks to young Persons of Noble Birth; the same Errors running through all Families, where there is Wealth enough to afford, that their Sons (at least the Eldest) may be good for nothing. Why should my Son be a Scholar, when it is not intended that he should live by his Learning? By this Rule, if what is commonly said be true, that Money an∣swereth all Things, why should my Son be ho∣nest, temperate, just, or charitable, since he hath no Intention to depend upon any of these Qualities for a Maintenance?</P>
<P>When all is done, perhaps, upon the Whole, the Matter is not so bad as I would make it; and God, who worketh Good out of Evil, act∣ing only by the ordinary Cause and Rule of Na∣ture, permits this continual Circulation of hu∣man Things for his own unsearchable Ends. The Father grows rich by Avarice, Injustice, Oppression; he is a Tyrant in the Neighbour∣hood over Slaves and Beggars, whom he calls his Tenants. Why should he desire to have
<PB N="187" REF="187"/>
Qualities infused into his Son, which himself never possessed, or knew, or found the Want of in the Acquisition of his Wealth? The Son bred in Sloth and Idleness, becomes a Spend∣thrift, a Cully, a Profligate, and goes out of the World a Beggar, as his Father came in: Thus the former is punished for his own Sins, as well as for those of the latter. The Dung∣hill having raised a huge Mushroom of short Duration, is now spread to enrich other Mens Lands. It is indeed of worse Consequence, where noble Families are gone to Decay; be∣cause their Titles and Privileges outlive their Estates: And, Politicians tell us, that nothing is more dangerous to the Publick, than a nume∣rous Nobility without Merit or Fortune. But even here, God hath likewise prescribed some Remedy in the Order of Nature, so many great Families coming to an End by the Sloth, Luxury, and abandoned Lusts, which enervated their Breed through every Succession, produ∣cing gradually a more effeminate Race, wholly unfit for Propagation.</P>

a delighful Union in their Children, and be the most binding Cement, that could be thought of, to preserve their Affections; be∣cause an equal Dispensation of Favours would entirely remove all Cause of Murmuring, Re∣pining, or Envy; and, what is of the greatest Consequence, would secure the Love and Esteem of their Children; whereas a partial Behaviour in Parents must necessarily produce the contrary.</P>
<P>But to state my Case, in the best Manner I can, and with an unbiassed Regard to Truth, I think it first necessary to give you our Cha∣racters, with an Account of my <HI>Father</HI>'s Be∣haviour, that you may be the better able to give me your <HI>Advice.</HI></P>
<P>First then, to begin with my Brother <HI>George.</HI> He was ever a great Lover of his Belly, and formerly used to cram himself with <HI>Beef, Pud∣ding,</HI> and <HI>White-Pot;</HI> but for some Time past, he has taken more Delight in new fangled <HI>Toss∣ups,</HI> and <HI>French Keck-Shaws.</HI> This high Feeding does naturally dispose him to be haugh∣ty, stubborn, cholerick and rebellious, inso∣much, that besides his Insults towards others, he is ready upon all Occasions to fly in his owm <HI>Fa∣ther</HI>'s Face, and apt to despise every Body but himself.</P>
<P>He is so various in his Opinions, that he is of as many <HI>Religions,</HI> as there are and have been <HI>Sects,</HI> since the Beginning of <HI>Christianity;</HI> but the <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Reformed Church as by Law established,</HI> is what he chiefly frequents. He was once a great Admirer of ancient Learning, but he has long since quitted this, for the
<PB N="190" REF="190"/>
Reading of <HI>News-Papers, Pamphlets,</HI> and <HI>Modern Languages.</HI> In his younger Years, he was fond of manly Exercises, such as <HI>Fencing, Leaping, Boxing, pitching the Bar, Wrestling, Hurling, Foot-ball, Hunting,</HI> &amp;c. but of late he has fallen into a strange and unaccountable Effeminacy, and seems to take Delight in no∣thing but <HI>Masquerades, Plays,</HI> and <HI>Italian Opera</HI>'s. He is very fond of <HI>Italian</HI> magnifi∣cent Buildings, although entirely inconsistent with our Climate, extravagant in the highest Degree in purchasing fine Paintings and Statues, and no less expensive in vast extensive Parks and Gardens, by which Means he has almost run out all his Fortune.</P>
<P>My younger Brother, <HI>Andrew,</HI> who has Cun∣ning enough to outwit the <HI>Devil,</HI> joined with Brother <HI>George</HI> some Years ago, and they ma∣nage so dextrously together, that whatever they say, is a <HI>Law</HI> with my <HI>Father;</HI> however, they are not without their Quarrels now and then; but Brother <HI>Andrew</HI> still comes by the worst, although he is cautious enough to go always armed, for Brother <HI>George</HI> wears a longer Sword. Brother <HI>Andrew</HI> is not very nice in his Food, but loves fine Cloaths. This I sup∣pose he has learned abroad; for he is a great Traveller. His chief Studies are <HI>Mathema∣ticks</HI> and the <HI>Civil-Law,</HI> in both which he has made a considerable Progress. As for his <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> although he openly professes himself a most rigid <HI>Fanatick of the Kirk,</HI> yet he is shrewdly suspected to have a Hankering after <HI>Popery.</HI> He has one eminent bad Quality,
<PB N="191" REF="191"/>
which is, that he cannot easily forgive and for∣get. I remember I was once so unfortunate, as to tell a fair <HI>Lady,</HI> (a <HI>Mistress</HI> of mine) be∣fore his Face, that I would stand by her against him and all her other Adversaries, which he took heinously ill, and has not forgiven me to this Hour, but lies upon the Watch to do me all the ill Offices he can.</P>
<P>I come now to my own Character, in which I shall not conceal nor gloss over my Vices, Er∣rors, or Failings, but at the same Time, I shall not think it inconsistent with Modesty, to tell you my Virtues.</P>
<P>I have but a small Fortune, can hardly keep Soul and Body together, yet out of a Regard to my Family, which is very Ancient, I love to make what they call a Figure, upon extraordi∣nary Occasions. And now and then I furnish my Table with Victuals and Liquors of the best Kinds, which makes my <HI>Father</HI> and Brother <HI>George</HI> think I have got the World in a String. I am kind and hospitable to Strangers, although they frequently rob my House, and turn my Children to lye in the Barn.</P>
<P>I am so fond of Learning, that I put them to the best School in the Kingdom, and I plain∣ly see, they will be only the Wiser, but never the Richer for it; because my <HI>Father</HI> uses all his Interest for Brother <HI>George</HI>'s Sons, and the greatest <HI>Dunce</HI> among them shall be better provided for, than the most Ingenious of mine. And, I must say, I have some who are equal in Learning to the best of his. I had a Design once, to follow <HI>Merchandise,</HI> that I might the
<PB N="192" REF="192"/>
better be able to provide for my poor Children; but Brother <HI>George</HI> having a Mind to make a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> prevailed upon my <HI>Father</HI> to join against me; and so at last they contrived it, that I should sell nothing but a few of my <HI>Cattle,</HI> and some <HI>Linnen-Cloth,</HI> which is all the Support I have; whereas Brother <HI>George</HI> can sell every Thing he has, all the World over; and so cruel is he to me, that he will not let me have even a Bit of his Dirt, if he thinks it will be of any Advantage to me. My <HI>Religion</HI> is of three Sorts, the <HI>Established, Popish,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> but I have a greater Share of the first in me: I think it is best, because it encourages Obedience to my <HI>Father,</HI> more than either of the other two. It is not long, since Brother <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> were in a Confederacy against my <HI>Father,</HI> with an Intent to turn him out of his House, and give another the Possession; at which critical Juncture, I mustered up a great Number of my Sons and Servants, to his Assistance, and, for ought I know, saved both his Life and Fortune.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I had like to have been ru∣ined by a Project; for one of my Brother <HI>George</HI>'s Family endeavoured to persuade my <HI>Father,</HI> that <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> were of no Use to me, and desired Leave to furnish me with a few <HI>Counters,</HI> in Lieu thereof; and I fear, I should have been so weak, as to accept of them, had it not been for the seasonable Remon∣strances made by some of my own <HI>House.</HI></P>
<P>These are a few of the many Hardships I have suffered; notwithstanding all which, I am
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
willing to continue in <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> to my dear <HI>Father;</HI> for I have Reason to be∣lieve, that his Unkindness to me, is owing to ill Advisers, who have prejudiced him against me and my Children; but I hope before long he will be able to distinguish his most faithful Son. In the mean Time, I do humbly entreat the Favour of you to write a Letter to my <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> which he may see in Print, for I fear all my Letters to him hitherto have been inter∣cepted.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have not told me your <HI>Father</HI>'s Name, nor his Quality, and therefore I am at a Loss in what Manner I should address him. But in common Humanity (because I think your Case deplorable) I will give you what Comfort I am able, together with my best Advice.</P>
<P>You are not the only Instance of <HI>suffering Innocence,</HI> and therefore it ought not surprze you, that <HI>Providence</HI> (for Reasons unaccountable to us) has laid two great Tryals in your Way, <HI>Oppression</HI> from your <HI>Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Unkind∣ness</HI> from your <HI>Father,</HI> this too without any Fault on your Side. If you did not meet with these Afflictions, you would want an Opportu∣nity of shewing your Humility and Resigna∣tion, as I understand you do not by your Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="194"/>
Let me advise you to consider that your Condition is not quite so lamentable, as that of <HI>Joseph,</HI> who triumphed in GOD's own Time over all his Misfortunes and Sufferings, and at last had the Pleasure of doing Good even to his Persecutors; but indeed there is this Difference, that his Grievance was chiefly from his <HI>Brethren;</HI> for had his Father joined in the Cruelty, the Wounds would have pierced nearer to his Heart.</P>
<P>I do not in the least doubt but there are some about your Father, who do you ill Offices, (I hope some Time or other they will be de∣tected:) You may find a convenient Opportu∣nity of getting fairly at him. State your Case and expostulate with him concerning your own and your Childrens Sufferings. When he hears your Story, and beholds your Sincerity, you may be sure of his Compassion and a Redress; for there is no Heart so hard as not to sympa∣thize with Real Woe, no Advocate so power∣ful as Innocence. In the mean Time, let me con∣jure you not to turn aside to the Right or to the Left, from that indispensable Duty, which the express Laws of God enjoin you, for let me assure you that Ingratitude to a Parent is, no less than Rebellion, like the Sin of Witchcraft.</P>
<P>I commit you to his Care and Direction, who is best able to govern the unruly Af∣fections of Men, to turn the Hearts of the Malicious, and to relieve and support those who suffer for the Sake of Righteousness.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Intelligencer,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately, with great Candour and Impartiality, perused some of your <HI>Pa∣pers</HI> upon the Distress and Poverty of this <HI>Island,</HI> which you take Care to describe in the most pathetick Manner, you must forgive me if I differ from you, and think it one of the most flourishing and wealthy Kingdoms in the whole World. And to support my Opinion, I will venture to affirm, that there never was such Affluence in ready Cash as at this present Juncture: For have we not more <HI>Bankers</HI> than ever were known among us? And whether the
<PB N="196" REF="196"/>
<HI>Money</HI> circulates in <HI>Specie</HI> or <HI>Paper,</HI> it is the same Thing to us, since those who would ra∣ther have <HI>Cash</HI> than <HI>Paper,</HI> can (as is well known) have their Choice, whenever they please. It is to be presum'd that no <HI>Banker</HI> gives a NOTE before the <HI>Money</HI> is first laid down on his <HI>Counter;</HI> then of Consequence there is as much <HI>Money</HI> as there is <HI>Paper;</HI> and that we have a great deal of <HI>Paper</HI> is most certain, therefore a great deal of <HI>Money.</HI> But I will proceed farther, and prove that we have much more <HI>Money</HI> than <HI>Paper,</HI> because there are Multitudes who keep their own <HI>Mo∣ney.</HI> This appears from the great Number of <HI>Iron Chests</HI> imported from <HI>Holland</HI> within these last <HI>seven Years;</HI> for what Use can they be of, but to lodge <HI>Money?</HI> They are at least two hundred. We will suppose that these, one with another, may contain <HI>two thousand Pounds</HI> a piece, then the Sum total amounts to <HI>four hundred thousand Pounds,</HI> which is so much superfluous and unnecessary <HI>Cash.</HI></P>
<P>If this <HI>Island</HI> were not very wealthy, it is strongly to be presumed, that so many <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>able</HI> Heads, Men of great Learning and superior Talents, whose Reputations reach'd us from distant Regions long before they came among us, so well distinguished in their own <HI>Coun∣tries</HI> for their great Knowledge in their several Professions, and here more especially remarka∣ble for their speaking in publick, and their profound Skill in Religion, Politicks and Law: I say that Men of such Accomplishments would never quit their own Native Soil, where so
<PB N="197" REF="197"/>
many Estates are daily made, if they were not sure that this <HI>Island</HI> must, on account of its greater Wealth, afford them Opportunities of making larger Acquisitions than they could at home.</P>
<P>Have not almost all the Gentlemen thro' this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> for some Years past, <HI>declined</HI> all <HI>profitable Employments,</HI> and left them to be filled by others? Can there be a stronger Argument of their Wealth, than their chusing to live at their <HI>Ease, out of Office,</HI> rather than be at the small Trouble which attends the Dis∣charge of a beneficial Employment?</P>
<P>Could so many estated Gentlemen thro' the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> afford to keep so much of their <HI>Lands waste</HI> and <HI>untenanted,</HI> if they had not <HI>Money</HI> enough by them to live without Tenants; and would not the Tenants likewise be glad to take this waste Land to plow and sow, but that they have ready Money enough to buy <HI>Bread Corn</HI> and other Necessaries from all the World beside?</P>
<P>As another signal Mark of our Riches, there is scarce a Gentleman who does not educate his Sons at our UNIVERSITY (<HI>which as the World sees, wants not its due Encourage∣ment</HI>) where they live at vast Expences, take Degrees, return to their Fathers, who, with∣out ever troubling <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Gospel,</HI> maintain them afterwards at <HI>Home,</HI> like <HI>Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Do not many of our Nobility through Wan∣tonness and Superfluity, reside constantly in <HI>ano∣ther Kingdom,</HI> where it is well known they make a better Figure, as to <HI>Houses, Coaches,</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="198"/>
and <HI>Equipages,</HI> than their Neighbours? And do not our young <HI>Peers,</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> who go thither <HI>to see the World, Game, Race, Drink,</HI> &amp;c. beyond any in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> of the same Age and Quality? Which they could not pos∣sibly do, if their Agents here had not an <HI>un∣drainable Fund to supply them.</HI> For as the <HI>Philosopher</HI> says, <HI>Nemo dat quod non habet:</HI> Or as the <HI>Juglar</HI> very elegantly expresses it, <HI>Where nothing is, there nothing can come out.</HI></P>
<P>If it be true, (I know it is confidently report∣ed) that a great Number of <HI>English Robbers</HI> are come over; that likewise is a very strong Argument of our Wealth; for they would never quit the <HI>English Streets</HI> and <HI>Roads</HI> for ours, unless they were sure to find an Advantage by the Change. It is most certain we never had such a Number of <HI>Robbers</HI> as at this very Juncture; from whence we may conclude, that they could not possibly multiply thus, if they did not find Houses and People enough to rob, for all Professions and Trades encrease accord∣ing to the Encouragement they meet with.</P>
<P>Are not whole Streets adding every Day to our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> when one would think it large enough already? Some entire Streets and many Houses, I must confess, are waste and uninha∣bited. But does not this shew the Wealth and Wantonness of the Inhabitants, who, not content with their present Dwellings, change them for others more costly and expensive?</P>
<P>Do not great Numbers of our Inhabitants, daily go off to <HI>America?</HI> will any Man say, this can be done with empty Pockets? Can any
<PB N="199" REF="199"/>
Man think otherwise, but that it must be the Effect of vast Superfluity, when People wan∣tonly take such long Voyages, and Journeys, to go where they have no Business.</P>
<P>The last Argument I shall offer for the Wealth of this Kingdom, is the great Number of <HI>Beggars</HI> in which it abounds; for it is a com∣mon Observation, that Riches are the Parent of Idleness, Sloth, and Luxury; and are not these naturally productive of Want and Beg∣gary?</P>
<P>I could offer many more Arguments, but that I hope you and your Countrymen are sufficiently convinced, by what I have said, that <HI>Ireland</HI> is a Place of great Wealth, Afflu∣ence, and Plenty. Therefore let me advise you, the next Time you put Pen to Paper, not to dress up <HI>Hibernia</HI> in Rags and Dirt, but cloath her in <HI>Scarlet</HI> and <HI>fine Linnen;</HI> for she can very well afford them. Draw the <HI>God</HI> of Riches, hovering over your <HI>Island,</HI> shaking ten Thousand of Golden Feathers from his Wings, much more than the Inhabitants can gather. And thus will your Countrymen who have retrenched upon your last groundless Alarm, return to their former Hospitality, and we shall see <HI>Halcyon,</HI> that is <HI>Irish,</HI> Days once more.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> began by acquainting us, that (contrary to his Advertisement) he thought himfelf in duty and conscience, oblig'd to change the subject Matter of his intended discourse.—Here he paus'd, and seem'd for a short space as it were lost in Devotion and mental Prayer; after which, with great earnestness and vehe∣mence he spake as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Friends and Fellow Citizens, all speculative Science is at an end; the Period of all things is at Hand; on <HI>Friday</HI> next this World shall be no more. Put not your confidence in me Brethren, for to morrow Morning five
<PB N="202" REF="202"/>
Minutes after five the Truth will be Evi∣dent; in that instant the Comet shall appear, of which I have heretofore warn'd you. As ye have heard, believe. Go hence, and prepare your Wives, your Families and Friends, for the universal Change."</Q></P>
<P>At this solemn and dreadful Prediction, the whole Society appear'd in the utmost Astonish∣ment: but it would be unjust not to remember that Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> himself was in so calm a Temper, as to return a Shilling a piece to the Youths who had been disappointed of their Lec∣ture, which I thought from a Man of his In∣tegrity a convincing Proof of his own Faith in the Prediction.</P>
<P>As we thought it a Duty, in Charity to warn all Men; in two or three Hours the News had spread through the City. At first indeed, our report met with but little Credit, it being by our greatest dealers in Stocks, thought only a Court-Artifice to sink them, that some choice Favourites might purchase at a lower Rate; for the <HI>South Sea,</HI> that very Evening fell five <HI>per Cent.</HI> the <HI>India,</HI> eleven; and all the other Funds in Proportion. But at the Court-end of the Town, our Attestations were intirely disbe∣liev'd or turn'd into ridicule; yet nevertheless the News spread every where, and was the sub∣ject matter of all Conversation.</P>
<P>That very Night, (as I was credibly in∣form'd) Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> was sent for to a great Lady, who is very curious in the Learned Sciences, and addicted to all the Speculative Doubts of the most able Philosophers; but he
<PB N="203" REF="203"/>
was not now to be found: and since at other times, he has been known not to decline that Honour, I make no doubt he conceal'd himself to attend the great Business of his Soul: But whether it was the Lady's Faith, or Inquisitive∣ness, that ocasion'd her to send, is a Point I shall not presume to determine. As for his being sent for to the Secretary's Office by a Messenger, it is now known to be a Matter notoriously false, and indeed at first it had little credit with me, that so Zealous and Ho∣nest a Man should be <HI>ordered into Custody,</HI> as a <HI>Seditious Preacher,</HI> who is known to be so well affected to the <HI>present happy Establish∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas now I reflected with exceeding trouble and sorrow, that I had disus'd Family Prayers for above five Years, and (though it hath been a Custom of late intirely neglected by Men of any Business or Station) I determin'd within myself no longer to omit so reasonable and reli∣gious a Duty. I acquainted my Wife with my Intentions: But two or three Neighbours hav∣ing been engaged to Sup with us that Night, and many Hours being unwarily spent at Cards, I was prevail'd upon by her, to put it off till the next Day; she reasoning, that it would be time enough to take off the Servants from their Business (which this practice must infallibly oc∣casion for an Hour or two every Day) after the <HI>Comet</HI> had made its appearance.</P>
<P><HI>Zachary Bowen,</HI> a Quaker, and my next Neighbour, had no sooner heard of the Pro∣phecy but he made me a Visit. I informed
<PB N="204" REF="204"/>
him of every thing I had heard, but found him quite obstinate in his unbelieve; for, said he, be comforted, Friend, thy tidings are Impossibili∣ties, for were these things to happen, they must have been foreseen by some of our Bre∣thren. This indeed (as in all other spiritual Cases with this Sett of People) was his only rea∣son against believing me; and, as he was fully persuaded that the Prediction was erroneous, he in a very neighbourly Manner admonished me against <HI>selling my Stock,</HI> at the present low Price; which, he said, beyond dispute must have a Rise before <HI>Monday,</HI> when this unreaso∣nable Consternation should be over.</P>
<P>But on WEDNESDAY Morning (I believe to the exact Calculation of Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>) the <HI>Comet</HI> appear'd: For at three Minutes aster five by my own Watch, I saw it. He indeed, foretold that it would be seen at five Minutes after Five, but as the best Watches may be a Minute or two too slow, I am apt to think his Calculation just to a Minute.</P>
<P>In less than a quarter of an Hour, all <HI>Cheap∣side</HI> was crouded with a vast concourse of Peo∣ple, and notwithstanding it was so early, 'tis thought that through all that part of the Town, there was not Man, Woman or Child, except the Sick, or Infirm, left in their Beds. From my own Balcony, I am consident, I saw several Thousands in the Street, and counted at least seventeen who were upon their Knees, and seem'd in actual Devotion. Eleven of them indeed appear'd to be old Women of about Fourscore; The Six others, were Men in an
<PB N="205" REF="205"/>
advanc'd Life, but (as I could guess) two of them might be under Seventy.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that an event of this Nature, may be pass'd over by the greater Historians of our Times, as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep Schemes of Politicians and Mysteries of State; for which reason, I thought it might not be unacceptable to record the Facts, which in the Space of three Days came to my Knowledge, either as an Eye-witness, or from unquestionable Authorities; nor can I think this Narrative will be intirely without its Use, as it may enable us to form a more just Idea of our Countrymen in general, particularly in regard to their Faith, Religion, Morals and Politicks.</P>
<P>Before WEDNESDAY Noon, the Belief was universal that the Day of Judgment was at Hand, insomuch, that a Waterman of my accquaintance told me he counted no less than one hundred and twenty three Clergymen, who had been ferry'd over to <HI>Lambeth</HI> before twelve a-Clock: these, 'tis said, went thither, to Petition, that a <HI>short Prayer</HI> might be <HI>Penn'd</HI> and <HI>Order'd,</HI> there being none in the Service upon that occasion. But as in things of this Nature, it is necessary that the <HI>Council</HI> be consulted, their request was not immediately comply'd with; and this I affirm to be the true and only Reason that the Churches were not that Morning so well attended; and is in no ways to be imputed to the Fears and Con∣sternation of the Clergy, with which the Free∣thinkers
<PB N="206" REF="206"/>
have since very unjustly reproach'd them.</P>
<P>My Wife and I went to Church (where we had not been for many Years on a Week-day) and, with a very large Congregation, were dis∣appointed of the Service. But (what will be scarce credible) by the carelessness of a 'Prentice, in our absence, we had a Piece of fine <HI>Cambric</HI> carried off by a Shop-lifter, so little impression was yet made on the minds of those wicked Women!</P>
<P>I cannot omit the care of a particular <HI>Direc∣tor of the Bank;</HI> I hope the worthy and wealthy Knight will forgive me that I endeavour to do him Justice; for it was unquestionably owing to Sir <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> H</HI><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s sagacity that all the <HI>Fire-Offices</HI> were requir'd to have a particular Eye upon the <HI>Bank of England.</HI> Let it be recorded to his Praise that in the general hurry, this struck him as his nearest and tenderest concern; but the next day in the Evening, after having taken due care of all his Books, Bills and Bonds, I was inform'd, his mind was wholly turn'd upon Spiritual Matters; yet, ever and anon, he could not help expressing his resent∣ment against the <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> to whom he imputed that sudden <HI>Run upon the Bank</HI> which happen'd on this occasion.</P>
<P>A Great Man (whom at this time it may not be prudent to name) employ'd all the <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, to make up such an Account as might appear fair, in case he should be call'd upon to produce it on the <HI>Friday;</HI> but was forced to desist, after having
<PB N="207" REF="207"/>
for several Hours together attempted it, not be∣ing able to bring himself to a resolution to trust the many hundred Articles of his secret Transa∣ctions upon Paper.</P>
<P>Another seem'd to be very melancholy, which his flatterers imputed to his dread of losing his Power in a Day or two; but I rather take it, that his chief concern was, the Terror of be∣ing try'd in a Court that could not be influenc'd and where a Majority of Voices could avail him nothing. It was observ'd too, that he had few Visitors that Day; this added so much to his Mortification, that he read thro' the first Chap∣ter of the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and wept over it bitterly; in short, he seem'd a true Penitent in every thing but in Charity to his Neighbour. No business was that Day done in his <HI>Compting-House;</HI> 'tis said too, that he was advis'd to Restitution, but I never heard that he comply'd with it any farther than in giving half a Crown a piece to several craz'd, and starving Creditors, who attended in the outward Room.</P>
<P>Three of the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> sent to coun∣termand their Birth-day Cloaths; two of them burnt all their Collections of Novels and Ro∣mances, and sent to a Bookseller's <HI>in Pall-mall</HI> to buy each of them a Bible, and <HI>Taylor</HI>'s <HI>Holy Living and Dying.</HI> But I must do all of them the Justice to acknowledge, that they shew'd a very decent Behaviour in the drawing Room, and restrain'd themselves from those innocent Freedoms and little Levities so commonly inci∣dent to young Ladies of their Profession. So ma∣ny Birth-day Suits were countermanded the next

Day, that most of the Taylors and Mantua∣makers discharg'd all their Journeymen and Women. A grave elderly Lady of great Eru∣dition and Modesty who visits these young Ladies, seem'd to be extreamly shock'd, by the Apprehensions that She was to appear naked before the whole World; and no less so, that all Mankind was to appear naked before Her; which might so much divert her Thoughts, as to incapacitate her to give Ready and apt An∣swers to the Interrogatories that might be made her. The Maids of Honour who had both Modesty and Curiosity, could not imagine the Sight so disagreeable as was represented; nay, one of them went so far as to say, she perfectly long'd to see it; for it could not be so indecent, when every body was to be alike; and they had a Day or two to prepare them∣selves, to be seen in that condition. Upon this reflection, each of them order'd a Bathing-Tub to be got ready that Evening, and a Looking-Glass to be set by it. So much are these young Ladies both by Nature and Custom addicted to cleanly appearance.</P>
<P>A West-Country Gentleman told me, he got a Church-Lease fill'd up that Morning for the same Sum which had been refus'd for three Years successively. I must impute this meerly to accident; for I cannot imagine that any Divine could take the advantage of his Tenant, in so unhandsome a Manner; or that the short∣ness of the Life was in the least his Considera∣tion; though I have heard the same worthy
<PB N="209" REF="209"/>
Prelate aspers'd and malign'd since upon this very Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Term</HI> being so near, the alarm among the LAWYERS was inexpressible, though some of them, I was told, were so vain as to promise themselves some advantages in making their de∣fence, by being vers'd in the Practice of our earthly Courts. It is said too, that some of the chief Pleaders were heard to express great satis∣faction, that there had been but sew <HI>State-Tryals</HI> of late Years. Several Attornies de∣manded the <HI>return of Fees</HI> that had been given the Lawyers: but it was answered the Fee was undoubtedly charg'd to their Client, and that they could not connive at such Injustice, as to suffer it to be sunk in the Attorney's Pockets. Our sage and learned <HI>Judges</HI> had great consola∣tion, insomuch as they had not pleaded at the Bar for several Years; the <HI>Barristers</HI> rejoyced in that they were not <HI>Attornies,</HI> and the Attor∣nies felt no less satisfaction that they were not <HI>Petti-foggers, Scriveners,</HI> and other meaner Officers of the Law.</P>
<P>As to the ARMY, far be it from me to con∣ceal the Truth. Every Soldier's behaviour was as undismayed, and undaunted, as if nothing was to happen: I impute not this to their want of Faith, but to their martial Disposition; though I cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more <HI>Oaths</HI> than are requisite, of which there was no re∣markable diminution this Morning on the Pa∣rade in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park. But possibly it was by choice, and on consideration, that they
<PB N="210" REF="210"/>
continued this way of Expression, not to intimi∣date the common Soldiers, or give occasion to suspect that even the Fear of Damnation could make any impression upon their Superior Offi∣cers. A <HI>Duel</HI> was fought the same Morning between two Colonels, not occasion'd, (as was reported) because the one was put over the other's Head; that being a Point which might at such a Juncture have been accommodated by the Mediation of Friends; but as this was upon the account of a Lady, 'twas judg'd it could not be put off at this time, above all others, but demanded immediate Satisfaction. I am apt to believe that a young Officer who desir'd his Surgeon to defer putting him into a Salivation till <HI>Saturday,</HI> might make this request out of some Opinion he had of the truth of the Pro∣phecy; for the apprehensions of any danger in the Operation could not be his Motive, the Surgeon himself having assured me that he had before undergone three severe Operations of the like Nature, with great resignation and for∣titude.</P>
<P>There was an Order issued, that the <HI>Chap∣lains</HI> of the several <HI>Regiments</HI> should attend their Duty; but as they were dispers'd about in several parts of <HI>England,</HI> it was believ'd, that most of them could not be found, or so much as heard of, till the great Day was over.</P>
<P>Most of the considerable PHYSICIANS by their outward demeanor seem'd to be Unbelie∣vers; but at the same time, they every where insinuated, that there might be a <HI>Pestilential Malignancy</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> occasion'd by the <HI>Co∣met,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="211"/>
which might be arm'd against by proper and timely Medicines. This caution had but little effect; for as the time approach'd, the Christian Resignation of the People encreas'd, and most of them (which was never before known) had their Souls more at Heart, than their Bodies.</P>
<P>If the Reverend CLERGY show'd more Concern than others, I charitably impute it to their great <HI>charge of Souls;</HI> and what confirm'd me in this Opinion was, that the <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Apprehension</HI> and <HI>Terror</HI> could be distinguish'd to be greater or less, according to their <HI>Ranks</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> in the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>The like might be observ'd in all sorts of Ministers, though not of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> the higher their Rank, the more was their Fear.</P>
<P>I speak not of the COURT, for fear of of∣fence; and I forbear Inserting the <HI>Names</HI> of particular Persons, to avoid the imputation of Slander, so that the Reader will allow this Narrative must be deficient, and is therefore desir'd to accept hereof rather as a Sketch, than a regular circumstantial History.</P>
<P>I was not inform'd of any Persons who shew'd the least Joy, except three Malefactors who were to be executed the <HI>Monday</HI> following, and one Old Man, a constant Church-goer, who being at the point of Death, exprest some satis∣faction at the News.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning there was little or nothing transacted in <HI>Change-Alley;</HI> there were a Multitude of Sellers, but so few Buyers,
<PB N="212" REF="212"/>
that one cannot affirm the Stocks bore any cer∣tain Price except among the <HI>Jews;</HI> who this Day, reap'd great Profit by their Infidelity. There were many who call'd themselves <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> who offer'd to buy <HI>for time,</HI> but as these were People of <HI>great Distinction,</HI> I chuse not to mention them, because in effect it would seem to accuse them both of Avarice, and In∣fidelity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Run</HI> upon the <HI>Bank</HI> is too well known to need a particular Relation; for it never can be forgotten that no one Person whatever (ex∣cept the <HI>Directors</HI> themselves, and some of their particular Friends and Associates) could convert a <HI>Bill</HI> all that Day into <HI>Specie;</HI> all hands being imploy'd to serve <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>In the several Churches of the City and Suburbs, there were seven Thousand two Hun∣dred and Forty Five, who publickly and so∣lemnly declar'd before the Congregation, that they took to Wife their several <HI>kept Mistresses,</HI> which was allow'd as valid Marriage, the Priests not having time to pronounce the Ceremony in Form.</P>
<P>At St. <HI>Bride</HI>'s Church in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Woolston</HI> (who writ against the Miracles of our Saviour) in the utmost Terrors of Conscience, made a publick Recantation. Dr. <HI>Mandevil;</HI> (who had been groundlessly reported formerly to have done the same) did it now in good earnest at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Gate; as did also at the <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> Church several Gentlemen, who frequent <HI>Coffee-Houses</HI> near the Bar. So great was the Faith and Fear of two of them, that they
<PB N="213" REF="213"/>
dropt Dead on the Spot; but I will not record their Names, lest I should be thought invidi∣ously to lay an Odium on their Families and Posterity.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Players</HI> who had very little Faith before, were now desirous of having as much as they cou'd, and therefore embrac'd the <HI>Roman Catholick Religion;</HI> the same thing was observ'd of some <HI>Bawds,</HI> and <HI>Ladies of Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Irish</HI> Gentleman out of pure Friendship came to make me a Visit, and advis'd me to <HI>hire a Boat</HI> for the ensuing Day, and told me, that unless I gave earnest for one immediately, he fear'd it might be too late; for his Country∣men had secured almost every Boat upon the River, as judging that, in the <HI>general Conflagra∣tion</HI> to be upon the <HI>Water</HI> would be the <HI>safest Place.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>two Lords,</HI> and <HI>three Commoners,</HI> who, out of a scruple of Conscience, very ha∣stily threw up their Pensions, as imagining a Pen∣sion was only an annual <HI>retaining Bribe.</HI> All the other great Pensioners, I was told, had their Scruples quieted by a <HI>Clergyman</HI> or two of distin∣ction, whom they happily consulted.</P>
<P>It was remarkable that several of our very richest <HI>Tradesmen</HI> of the City, in common Cha∣rity, gave away Shillings and Six-pences to the Beggars, who ply'd about the Church Doors; and at a particular Church in the City, a Weal∣thy <HI>Church-warden</HI> with his own Hands distri∣buted Fifty twelve-penny Loaves to the Poor by way of Restitution for the many great and
<PB N="214" REF="214"/>
costly Feasts, which he had eaten of at their ex∣pence.</P>
<P>Three great Ladies, a <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> two Lords, a Custom-House Officer, five Half∣pay Captains, and a Baronet, (all noted <HI>Game∣sters</HI>) came publickly into a Church at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> and deposited a very considerable Sum of Money in the Minister's Hands; the Parties whom they had defrauded, being either out of Town, or not to be found. But so great is the Hardness of Heart of this Fraternity, that a∣mong either the Noble, or Vulgar Gamesters, (though the Profession is so general) I did not hear of any other restitution of this Sort. At the same time I must observe that (in compari∣son of these) through all parts of the Town, the Justice and Penitence of the <HI>Highway-Men, House-breakers,</HI> and common <HI>Pick-Pockets</HI> was very remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Directors</HI> of our <HI>Publick Companies</HI> were in such dreadful apprehensions, that one would have thought a <HI>Parliamentary Enquiry</HI> was at hand; yet so great was their presence of Mind, that all the <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning was taken up in <HI>private Transfers,</HI> which by malicious People was thought to be done with design to conceal their Effects.</P>
<P>I forbear mentioning the private Confessions of particular <HI>Ladies</HI> to their <HI>Husbands;</HI> for as their Children were born in Wedlock, and of conse∣quence are Legitimate, it would be an invidious Task to record them as Bastards; and particu∣larly after their several Husbands have so chari∣tably forgiven them.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="215"/>
The Evening and Night, through the whole Town, were spent in Devotions both Publick and Private; the Churches for this one Day, were so crowded by the Nobility and Gentry, that Thousands of common People were seen praying in the publick Streets. In short, one would have thought the whole Town had been really and seriously religious. But what was very remarkable, all the different Persuasions kept by themselves, for as each thought the other would be damned, not one would join in Prayer with the other.</P>
<P>At length FRIDAY came, and the People cover'd all the Streets; Expecting, Watching and Praying. But as the Day wore away, their Fears first began to abate, then lessen'd every hour, at Night they were almost extinct, till the total Darkness, that hitherto us'd to terrify, now comforted every <HI>Free-thinker</HI> and <HI>Atheist.</HI> Great numbers went together to the <HI>Taverns,</HI> bespoke <HI>Suppers,</HI> and broke up whole <HI>Hogs∣heads</HI> for joy. The subject of all Wit and Conversation was to ridicule the Prophecy, and railly each other. All the Quality and Gentry were <HI>perfectly asham'd,</HI> nay, some utterly dis∣own'd that they had manifested any Signs of Religion.</P>
<P>But the next Day, even the Common People, as well as their Betters, appear'd in their usual state of Indifference. They Drank, they Whor'd, they Swore, they Ly'd, they Cheated, they Plunder'd, they Gam'd, they Quarrell'd, they Murder'd. In short, the World went on in the old Channel.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="216"/>
I need not give any Instances of what will so easily be credited, but I cannot omit relating, that Mr. <HI>Woolston</HI> advertis'd, in that very <HI>Satur∣day</HI>'s <HI>Evening-Post,</HI> a new <HI>Treatise</HI> against the <HI>Miracles</HI> of our Saviour; and that the few, who had given up their Pensions the Day before, so∣licited to have them continued; which, as they had not been thrown up upon any Ministerial Point, I am inform'd was readily granted.</P>

<L>The modern Dame is wak'd by Noon,</L>

<L>Because, though sore against her Will,</L>
<L>She fat all Night up at <HI>Quadrill.</HI></L>

She stretches, gapes, unglues her Eyes,</L>
<L>And asks if it be time to rise;</L>
<L>Of Head-ach, and the Spleen complains;</L>
<L>And then to cool her heated Brains,</L>
<L>Her Night-gown and her Slippers brought her,</L>

<L>Then to her Glass; and "<HI>Betty,</HI> pray</L>

<L>She enters on her usual Theme;</L>

Her last Night's ill Success repeats,</L>

<L>You say you will eat Grass on his Grave: a Christian eat Grass!</L>

<L>But that's as much as to say, that my Master should die before ye,</L>
<L>Well, well, that's as God pleases, and I don't believe that's a true Story,</L>
<L>And so say I told you so, and you may go tell my Master; what care I?</L>
<L>And I don't care who knows it, 'tis all one to <HI>Mary.</HI></L>
<L>Every body knows, that I love to tell Truth and shame the Devil,</L>
<L>I am but a poor Servant, but I think Gentle∣folks should be civil.</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="242"/>
Besides, you found fault with our Vittles one Day that you was here,</L>

<L><HI>Mary</HI> said he (one Day, as I was mending my Master's Stocking,)</L>

<HEAD>A SOLDIER AND A SCHOLAR: OR, A Lady's Judgment on those two Characters.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THUS spoke to my Lady the Knight full of Care,</L>
<L>Let me have your Advice in a weighty Affair:</L>
<L>This <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Bawn, while it sticks on my Hand,</L>
<L>I lose by the House what I get by the Land;</L>
<L>But how to dispose of it to the best Bidder,</L>
<L>For a <HI>Barrack,</HI> or <HI>Malt-house,</HI> we now must consider:</L>
<L>First, let me suppose, I make it a Malt-house,</L>
<L>Here, I have computed the Profit will fall t'us;</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="271"/>
There's nine hundred Pounds for Labour and Grain;</L>
<L>I increase it to Twelve; so Three hundred re∣main;</L>
<L>A handsome Addition for Wine and good Cheer,</L>
<L>Three Dishes a Day, and ten Hogsheads a Year;</L>
<L>With a Dozen large Vessels my Vaules shall be stor'd;</L>
<L>No little scrub Joint shall e'er come on my Board;</L>
<L>And you, and the Dean, no more shall combine,</L>
<L>To stint me at Night to one Bottle of Wine:</L>
<L>Nor shall I, for his Humours, permit you to purloin</L>
<L>A Stone and a half of good Beef from my Surloin.</L>
<L>If I make it a <HI>Barrack,</HI> the Crown is my Tenant;</L>
<L>My Dear, I have ponder'd again, and again on't.</L>
<L>In Poundage and Drawback, I lose half my Rent,</L>
<L>Whatever they give me, I must be content,</L>
<L>Or join with the Court in every Debate;</L>
<L>And rather than that, I would lose my Estate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus ended the Knight: Thus began the meek Wife:</L>
<L>It must, and it shall be a Barrack, my Life:</L>
<L>I am grown a mere Mopus, no Company comes,</L>
<L>But a Rabble of Tenants, and rusty dull <HI>Rums;</HI></L>
<L>With Parsons, what Lady can keep her self clean?</L>
<L>I am all over dawb'd, when I sit by the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean of St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s</NOTE><HI>Dean.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="272"/>
But if you will give us a Barrack, my Dear,</L>
<L>The Captain, I'm sure, will always come here.</L>
<L>I then shall not value his Deanship a Straw;</L>
<L>For the Captain, I'll warrant, will keep him in Awe.</L>
<L>Or should he pretend to be brisk and alert,</L>
<L>We'll tell him that Chaplains should not be so pert;</L>
<L>That Men of his Coat should be minding their Prayers,</L>
<L>And not among Ladies to give themselves Airs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus argu'd my Lady, but argu'd in vain;</L>
<L>The Knight his Opinion resolv'd to maintain.</L>
<L>But <HI>Hannah,</HI> who listen'd to all that was past,</L>
<L>And could not endure so vulgar a Taste,</L>
<L>As soon as her Ladyship call'd to be drest,</L>
<L>Cry'd, Madam, why surely my Master's possest;</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Arthur</HI> the Malster! how fine it would Sound?</L>
<L>I'd rather the Bawn were funk under Ground:</L>

<L><PB N="57" REF="273"/>
And after, methought, I lost my new Shoes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Molly,</HI> she said, I should hear some ill News.</L>
<L>Dear Madam, had you but the Spirit to teaze,</L>
<L>You might have a Barrack whenever you please,</L>
<L>And, Madam, I always believ'd you so stout,</L>
<L>That for twenty Denials, you would not give out.</L>
<L>If I had a Husband like him, I protest,</L>
<L>Till he gave me my Will, I would give him no Rest,</L>
<L>And rather than come in the same Pair of Sheets</L>
<L>With such a cross Man, I wou'd lie in the Streets.</L>
<L>But, Madam, I beg, you'll contrive, and invent,</L>
<L>And worry him out, till he gives his Consent.</L>
<L>Dear Madam, whene'er on a Barrack I think,</L>

<L>Good-morrow, good Captain—I'll wait on you down.</L>

<L>For all the World, Captain, not half an Inch farther—</L>

Dub, dub, a dub, dub; the Trumpeters follow,</L>

<L>O law! the sweet Gentleman, look in his Face!</L>

<L>And his Horse, the dear <HI>Creature,</HI> it prances and rears,</L>

<LG>
<L>AS some raw Youth in Country bred,</L>
<L>To Arms by Thirst of Honour led,</L>
<L>When at a Skirmish first he hears</L>
<L>The Bullets whistling round his Ears,</L>
<L>Will duck his Head aside, will start,</L>
<L>And feel a trembling at his Heart:</L>
<L>Till, 'scaping oft' without a Wound</L>
<L>Lessens the Terror of the Sound:</L>
<L>Fly Bullets now as thick as Hops,</L>
<L>He runs into a Cannon's Chops.</L>
<L>An Author thus who pants for Fame</L>
<L>Begins the World with Fear and Shame,</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="282"/>
When first in Print, you see him dread</L>
<L>Each Pot-gun levell'd at his Head:</L>
<L>The Lead yon Critick's Quill contains,</L>
<L>Is destin'd to beat out his Brains.</L>
<L>As if he heard loud Thunders roll,</L>
<L>Cries, Lord have Mercy on his Soul,</L>
<L>Concluding, that another Shot</L>
<L>Will strike him dead upon the Spot.</L>
<L>But, when with squibbing, flashing, popping,</L>
<L>He cannot see one Creature dropping:</L>
<L>That, missing Fire, or missing Aim,</L>
<L>His Life is safe, I mean his Fame,</L>
<L>The Danger past, takes Heart of Grace,</L>
<L>And looks a Critick in the Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though Splendor gives the fairest Mark</L>
<L>To poison'd Arrows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Dark,</L>
<L>Yet, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In seipso totus teres atque rotundus.</NOTE><HI>in your self when smooth and round,</HI></L>
<L>They glance aside without a Wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis said the Gods try'd all their Art,</L>
<L>How, <HI>Pain</HI> they might from <HI>Pleasure</HI> part;</L>
<L>But little could their Strength avail,</L>
<L>Both still are fast'ned by the Tail.</L>
<L>Thus, <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Censure</HI> with a Tether</L>
<L>By Fate are always link'd together.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why will you aim to be preferr'd,</L>
<L>In Wit before the common Herd?</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="283"/>
And yet, grow mortify'd and vext,</L>
<L>To pay the Penalty annext.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis Eminence makes Envy rise,</L>
<L>As fairest Fruits attract the Flyes.</L>
<L>Shou'd stupid Libels grieve your Mind,</L>
<L>You soon a Remedy may find:</L>
<L>Lie down obscure like other Folks</L>
<L>Below the Lash of Snarlers Jokes.</L>
<L>Their Faction is five hundred odds,</L>
<L>For, ev'ry Coxcomb lends them Rods;</L>
<L>And sneers as learnedly as they,</L>
<L>Like Females o'er their Morning Tea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You say, the Muse will not contain,</L>
<L>And write you must, or break a Vein:</L>
<L>Then, if you find the Terms too hard,</L>
<L>No longer my Advice regard:</L>
<L>But raise your Fancy on the Wing;</L>
<L>The <HI>Irish Senate</HI>'s Praises sing:</L>
<L>How jealous of the Nation's Freedom,</L>
<L>And, for Corruptions, how they weed 'em;</L>
<L>How each the Publick Good pursues,</L>
<L>How far their Hearts from private Views;</L>
<L>Make all true Patriots up to Shoe-boys</L>
<L>Huzza their Brethren at the <HI>Blue-boys.</HI></L>
<L>And dread no more the Rage of Grub;</L>
<L>You then may soon be of the Club.</L>

<L>How oft' am I for Rhime to seek?</L>
<L>To dress a Thought, I toyl a Week:</L>
<L>And then, how thankful to the Town,</L>
<L>If all my Pains will earn a Crown.</L>
<L>Whilst, ev'ry Critick can devour</L>
<L>My Work and me in half an Hour.</L>
<L>Would Men of Genius cease to write,</L>
<L>The Rogues must die for Want of Spight,</L>
<L>Must die for Want of Food and Rayment,</L>
<L>If Scandal did not find them Payment.</L>
<L>How chearfully the Hawkers cry</L>
<L>A Satire, and the Gentry buy!</L>
<L>While my hard-labour'd Poem pines</L>
<L>Unsold upon the Printer's Lines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A <HI>Genius</HI> in the Rev'rend Gown</L>
<L>Must ever keep its Owner down:</L>
<L>'Tis an unnatural Conjunction,</L>
<L>And spoils the Credit of the Function.</L>
<L>Round all your Brethren cast your Eyes;</L>
<L>Point out the surest Men to rise:</L>
<L>That Club of Candidates in Black,</L>
<L>The least deserving of the Pack,</L>
<L>Aspiring, factious, fierce and loud,</L>
<L>With Grace and Learning unendow'd,</L>
<L>Will sooner coyn a Thousand Lyes</L>
<L>Than suffer Men of Parts to rise:</L>
<L>They croud about Preferment's Gate,</L>
<L>And press you down with all their Weight.</L>

For, as of old, Mathematicans</L>
<L>Were by the Vulgar thought Magicians;</L>
<L>So Academick dull Ale-drinkers</L>
<L>Pronounce all Men of Wit, Free-thinkers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wit, as the chief of Virtue's Friends,</L>
<L>Disdains to serve ignoble Ends.</L>
<L>Observe what Loads of stupid Rhimes</L>
<L>Oppress us in corrupted Times:</L>
<L>What Pamphlets in a Court's Defence</L>
<L>Shew Reason, Grammar, Truth, or Sense?</L>
<L>For, though the Muse delights in Fiction,</L>
<L>She ne'er inspires against Conviction.</L>
<L>Then keep your Virtue still unmixt,</L>
<L>And let not Faction come betwixt.</L>
<L>By Party steps no Grandeur clime at,</L>
<L>Tho' it would make you <HI>England</HI>'s Primate:</L>
<L>First learn the Science to be dull,</L>
<L>You then may soon your Conscience lull;</L>

<L>When <HI>Jove</HI> was, from his teeming Head,</L>
<L>Of Wit's fair Goodness brought to Bed,</L>
<L>There follow'd at his Lying-in</L>
<L>For After-birth a <HI>Sooterkin;</HI></L>
<L>Which, as the Nurse pursu'd to kill,</L>
<L>Attain'd by Flight the Muses Hill;</L>
<L>There in the Soil began to root,</L>
<L>And litter'd at <HI>Parnassus'</HI> Foot.</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="286"/>
From hence the Critick Vermin sprung</L>
<L>With Harpy Claws, and Pois'nous Tongue.</L>
<L>Who fatten on Poetick Scraps,</L>
<L>Too cunuing to be caught in Traps.</L>
<L>Dame Nature, as the Learned show,</L>
<L>Provides each Animal its Foe:</L>
<L>Hounds hunts the Hare, the wily Fox</L>
<L>Devours your Geese, the Wolf your Flocks;</L>
<L>Thus Envy pleads a nat'ral Claim</L>
<L>To persecute the Muses Fame;</L>
<L>On Poets in all Times abusive,</L>
<L>From <HI>Homer</HI> down to <HI>Pope</HI> inclusive.</L>

<LG>
<L>Yet, what avails it to complain?</L>
<L>You try to take Revenge in vain.</L>
<L>A Rat your utmost Rage defies</L>
<L>That safe behind the Wainscot lies:</L>
<L>Say, did you ever know by Sight</L>
<L>In Cheese an individual Mite?</L>
<L>Shew me the same numerick Flea,</L>
<L>That bit your Neck but yesterday.</L>
<L>You then may boldly go in Quest</L>
<L>To find the Grubstreet Poet's Nest.</L>
<L>What Spunging-House in dread of Jayl</L>
<L>Receives them while they wait for Bayl:</L>
<L>What Ally they are neftled in,</L>
<L>To flourish o'er a Cup of Ginn:</L>
<L>Find the last Garrat where they lay,</L>
<L>Or Cellar, where they starve to Day.</L>

Suppose you had them all trepann'd</L>
<L>With each a Libel in his Hand,</L>
<L>What Punishment would you inflict?</L>
<L>Or call 'em Rogues or get 'em kickt?</L>
<L>These they have often try'd before;</L>
<L>You but oblige 'em so much more:</L>
<L>Themselves would be the first to tell,</L>
<L>To make their Trash the better sell.</L>

<L>You have been Libel'd—Let us know</L>
<L>What senseless Coxcomb told you so.</L>
<L>Will you regard the Hawker's Cryes</L>
<L>Who in his Titles always lyes?</L>
<L>Whate'er the noisy Scoundrel says</L>
<L>It might be something in your Praise:</L>
<L>And, Praise bestow'd in Grub-street Rhimes,</L>
<L>Would vex one more a thousand Times.</L>
<L>Till Block-heads blame, and Judges praise,</L>
<L>The Poet cannot claim his Bays.</L>
<L>On me, when Dunces are satyrick,</L>
<L>I take it for a Penegyrick.</L>
