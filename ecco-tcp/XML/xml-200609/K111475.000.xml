<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING promis'd a Second Vo∣lume
of this History when I
publish'd the First, it is now
become a Debt of so many Years
standing, that I don't know whether the
bare discharging it will be thought suf∣ficient,
without saying something in Ex∣cuse
for my having deferr'd it so long.
And yet upon second Thoughts, I believe
I might easily have been forgiven, if I had
never discharg'd it: For the World is not
so rigid in demanding Debts of this kind,
as we Authors imagine. But to deal plainly,
I have been many Years employ'd in Busi∣ness
of another kind; tho' I must confess
it has been with very little Advantage to
the Publick, or Myself; and much less do
<PB REF="4"/>
I propose any great Benefit to arise to ei∣ther
from this Undertaking. However it
has serv'd to shift the Scene a little, and to
gratify my own Inclinations, in renewing
my Acquaintance with those Studies which
I have formerly pursu'd.</P>
<P>I have pleas'd myself with the Thoughts
of doing some sort of Justice to the Me∣mory
of a Race of Worthies, who may
be call'd the first Assertors of publick Li∣berty:
And if I have not succeeded so
well in it as I could wish, I hope it will
be imputed rather to the Nature of the
Subject, than to any want of my Endea∣vours.
In the former Part of this History,
I did not find it an easy Task to take off
that Veil of <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Fiction,</HI> which has
been thrown over the first Ages of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and to introduce, in the room of it, some∣thing
like the <HI>Colouring</HI> of History. And
even in the later Times, which are call'd
<HI>Historical,</HI> I have met with too much In∣tricacy
and Confusion, in the treating of
so many separate States, in unravelling
their different Interests, in describing their
different Manners and Customs, and Forms
<PB REF="5"/>
of Government, and in connecting the
Whole with the Body of the Story.</P>
<P>In the Progress of this Work, I have
found more Difficulties of this kind, than
I apprehended at my first Entrance upon
it; and it is that which, I believe, has
chiefly discourag'd others from undertaking
it. For I cannot otherwise conceive how
it should happen, that the History of a
Country, which has been the Scene of so
much Action within itself, and which has
given Birth to so many great Events in o∣ther
Parts of the World, should be so
much neglected. I do not mean, that it
has been wholly buried in the Rust and
Ruins of Antiquity; but it certainly has
not receiv'd a due Proportion of those Im∣provements,
which have been made of late
Years both in Ancient and Modern Histo∣ry,
as well as in other Arts and Sciences.
For tho' there have been many Parts of
the Affairs of the <HI>Grecians</HI> extracted from
their Historians, and Biographers, Poets,
Orators and Philosophers, with great Va∣riety
of Glosses and Comments upon 'em;
yet they are in such detach'd Pieces, and
<PB REF="6"/>
so unmethodiz'd, that they can only serve
as the Ground-work for a more regular
Composition; and as such I have made
use of them. There are some Collections
of this kind, which are more in the Form
of History: But the Facts contain'd in
them are related in so dry and lifeless a
manner, that there is nothing of the true
Spirit of <HI>Greece</HI> in them. And a further
Objection to them is, that they are inter∣mix'd
with the Affairs of other Nations,
which have no relation to them. This is
the Method observ'd by the Writers of
<HI>Universal History,</HI> whose chief Merit is
the preserving the Order of Time; but for
the sake of that, they invert the Order of
Place, and hurry you on from one Coun∣try
to another, without any natural Agree∣ment
or Connection. Such a confused Va∣riety
of Matter may do well enough, when
it is comprised in those short <HI>Compendiums</HI>
of <HI>Chronology,</HI> which are design'd to im∣print
on the Memory the Dates of the
most remarkable Events, as they have hap∣pen'd
in the World. But the relating
things at length in an Historical Way, and
<PB REF="7"/>
blending together Sacred Story and Pro∣fane,
Ancient and Modern, Foreign and
Domestick, as it distracts the Mind of the
Reader too much, so it is a Work of too
great Labour and Extent for the Writer,
to be throughly executed.</P>
<P>He who has succeeded best in this way,
is <HI>Monsieur Rollin,</HI> who has cull'd out the
Flowers of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Story, and inter∣spers'd
them in the Accounts, which he
has given of the other ancient Kingdoms
and Common-wealths. But besides the
relating things by Piece-meal in the con∣fus'd
manner before-mention'd, he has o∣mitted
several Particulars which are mate∣rial,
and in others which are not so, he is
too circumstantial. And his Reflections,
tho' they are generally just, are too fre∣quent
and too tedious, too trite and ob∣vious,
and too juvenile. However they
may be suited to the Design of his Pro∣vince
in the Institution of Youth, and may
serve as Lectures to instil into their Minds
Principles of Virtue and Morality, they
are not so agreeable as they should be to
the Laws of History, which will allow of
<PB REF="8"/>
very few Reflections, but such as naturally
arise to the Reader from a simple Relation
of Facts, or such at least, as are inter∣woven
in the Body of the Story, so as not
to break the Thread of it. I would not
be thought to detract from the Merit of a
Work, which has met with a pretty gene∣ral
Approbation, and is now in every Body's
Hands. The Author has certainly taken
great Care and Pains in it: He is copious
in his Matter, faithful in his Authorities,
and clear and easy in his Narration; and
there is a Spirit of Liberty throughout the
Whole, which is well suited to the Sub∣ject,
and which few of his Countrymen,
except <HI>Monsieur Tourreil,</HI> have attain'd to.
Wherefore, tho' I had compos'd the fol∣lowing
Sheets before his History appear'd
in the World, I will freely own, that it
has been of Service to me in the Revisal of
them.</P>
<P>I must likewise acknowledge the Lights
I have receiv'd in several Passages of this
History, from the <HI>Grecian Antiquities</HI> of
<HI>The most Reverend the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury,</HI> who is no less eminent for his
<PB REF="9"/>
extensive Knowledge in all Parts of Learn∣ing,
than for his other great Qualities.
And however this Work may have serv'd
as an Amusement to <HI>His Grace</HI> in the early
Course of his Studies, it cannot now be
thought unworthy of his more advanc'd
Age, nor unbecoming either his holy Pro∣fession,
or his high Station.</P>
<P>Just before I sent these Sheets to the
Press, I met with <HI>The History of</HI> Epami∣nondas,
lately publish'd at <HI>Paris</HI> by the
<HI>Abbé de la Tour,</HI> being intended to supply
the Loss of that Life of him, which was
wrote by <HI>Plutarch.</HI> I likewise receiv'd <HI>A
Discourse</HI> in Manuscript upon the same
Subject, which had been pronounc'd in the
<HI>Academy of the Belles Lettres and Inscrip∣tions,</HI>
by the <HI>Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eA Gedoyn,</HI> and which was
communicated to me in a very obliging
manner from <HI>Monsieur de Fontenelle.</HI> I was
desirous to see if any thing material had
escap'd me in my Account of the greatest
Man of <HI>Greece:</HI> And the Perusal of these
two Pieces has serv'd to clear up to me
some doubtful Passages concerning him,
and to confirm me in others.</P>
<P><PB REF="10"/>
As to this second Part of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Story, it contains the Transactions of sixty
eight Years, which is not a twentieth Part
of the Time compris'd in the first Volume:
But what it wants in the Number of Years,
is made up in the Variety of Events, and
the Fullness of the Materials. This Compass
of Time, together with the twenty-seven
preceding Years of the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War, was
the most active and bustling Age of the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> who, when they were freed from
the Danger of a Foreign Enemy, fell into
such Dissensions, as turn'd the Edge of the
Sword against themselves, and ended in
the Destruction of that Liberty, which
they had so gloriously defended. There
were still among them some true Patriots,
who aim'd at nothing further than the ge∣neral
Safety of <HI>Greece,</HI> and an equal Ba∣lance
among the several Common-wealths:
But it was the fixing and preserving this
Balance, which created so much Difficulty
and Disturbance. Among so many diffe∣rent
Governments and popular Assemblies,
it was hardly possible to avoid Confusion
and Discord: And the <HI>Demagogues,</HI> and
<PB REF="11"/>
other artful and designing Men, from
hence took occasion to perplex and inflame
Matters still more, in order to carry on
their own selfish Views at the Expence of
the Publick. There was one Part of the
Constitution of <HI>Greece</HI> well design'd to re∣medy
these Inconveniences, and that was
the <HI>Council of the Amphictyons,</HI> who were
in the nature of <HI>States General,</HI> and were
intended not only to provide for the com∣mon
Good and Safety of the Whole, but
to decide the Differences, and adjust the
Pretensions of each particular State; and
great Regard was paid to their Determina∣tions.
But tho' they were conven'd twice
a Year, it was mostly for form-sake; so
that, except upon some very extraordinary
Occasions, they seldom did any thing that
answer'd the End of their Institution.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had other specious Shews of
Liberty, and their publick Harangues were
full of it; but it was chiefly in Shew and
in Words, for the Spirit of it was in a
great measure lost. The Band of Amity,
which had united them against the <HI>Per∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians,</HI>
was dissolv'd. The open, generous
<PB REF="12"/>
and disinterested Valour, which they shew'd
upon that Occasion, began daily to dege∣nerate
into Sloth and Luxury, Faction and
Corruption, Fraud and Violence. The
Greater States devour'd the Lesser, and
then prey'd upon one another. In short,
the great Bone of Contention now among
them, was the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI>
which most of them aspir'd to in their
turns; and still, as one Competitor fail'd in
it, there started up another. Such was the
convulsive State of <HI>Greece</HI> at the time of
the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War; and so it continu∣ed
as long as it was a Nation. There were
indeed some quiet Intervals; but they
were short, and such as serv'd rather
to recover breath, than to settle any
course of Tranquillity.</P>
<P>In relating these Wars of the <HI>Grecians</HI> a∣mong
themselves, the Reader is not to expect
such great and surprising Incidents, as those
which happen'd in their Defence against
the <HI>Persians.</HI> He will not meet with such
numerous Armies, as those which came
with all the Power of the <HI>East,</HI> like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
Inundation, upon them; nor with such
<PB REF="13"/>
signal Victories, as those which have per∣petuated
the Names of <HI>Marathon, Sala∣mis,
Plataea</HI> and <HI>Mycale.</HI> The Efforts,
which were then made for the Publick
Liberty, had something more than human
in them, and are not to be accounted for
according to the ordinary course of Na∣ture.
But however the <HI>Eclat</HI> of these il∣lustrious
Actions may raise our Attention
and Admiration; yet an Account of the
intestine Quarrels which succeeded them,
will furnish us with more of that useful
Knowledge and Instruction, which is to
be drawn from History. There were few∣er
Numbers then brought into the Field,
and less Blood shed: But the Merit of
these later Victories consisted more in the
Skill and Conduct of the Generals, and
the Discipline of the Troops, than in
the Number of the slain. There were
more Feints and Stratagems, Marches and
Countermarches, Incampments and De∣campments,
more surprising of Garrisons,
intercepting of Convoys, debauching of
Allies, and cluding of Treaties. In short,
the <HI>Grecians</HI> were now become much more
<PB REF="14"/>
expert and refined in the Art of War, and
less prodigal of their Lives, than when
they had nothing but an hardy desperate
Valour to oppose to the Multitudes of the
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> and when by that glorious
Stand made at <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> one part of
them devoted themselves to certain death
for the Preservation of the rest. Hence it
was, that these civil Discords were pro∣tracted
to a greater Length, than could
otherwise have been imagin'd: For consi∣dering
the Heat and Rancour, with which
they were carried on, and that the Scene
of Action lay in so narrow a Compass as
<HI>Greece</HI> strictly so call'd, it might naturally
have been expected, that things would
sooner have been brought to some general
Issue, and that, by some decisive Stroke,
one of the principal Republicks would
have made an intire Conquest of the
Whole. Besides the Reasons already given
for the long Continuance, and the fatal
Issue of these Wars, another material one
may be assign'd, which is, that the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
were not content to decide their own
Quarrel, without interesting Foreign Pow∣ers
<PB REF="15"/>
in it. Most of them, to their eternal
Reproach, as they found themselves di∣stress'd,
made mean Applications to their
old Enemies the <HI>Persians,</HI> who had found
out the Secret of fomenting their Divi∣sions,
and supporting one State against an∣other,
in order to weaken the Whole.
<HI>Philip</HI> afterwards improv'd upon the Ex∣ample
the <HI>Persians</HI> had set him; and thus
in the end the <HI>Grecian</HI> Liberties were lost.
The Means by which this Change was
effected, and the Struggles, which were
now and then made by particular Persons
and States, for recovering the ancient Ho∣nour
of <HI>Greece,</HI> is chiefly the Subject of
this Volume.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to observe,
that notwithstanding these Commotions,
with which the whole Country was more
or less agitated, Arts and Sciences re∣ceiv'd
daily Improvement, and were car∣ried
on to a great degree of Perfection; and
there was more Politeness and Civility,
more Policy and Intrigue, more good
Writing and Speaking, and a greater Va∣riety
of Men eminent in all Professions,
<PB REF="16"/>
than in any other Period of time in
<HI>Greece,</HI> or in any other Country in that
Age of the World. And as a thorough
Knowledge of the Lives and Characters of
these famous Men, does very much conduce to
the Knowledge of the History of the Times
they liv'd in, I have therefore been the
more exact in describing them, so as to
distinguish their good and bad Qualities,
and to shew in what manner, and in what
degree, they have been beneficial, or hurt∣ful
to their Country. In the doing this,
I have found it difficult to reconcile the
different Accounts which have been given
of them by some of the Historians of
those Times, who often clash with one
another, and sometimes even with them∣selves.
All that I could do in this case,
was to compare them together, to supply
the Defects of one out of another, and
to extract out of the whole those Parti∣culars,
which appear'd to me the most ra∣tional
and probable, and most consistent with
the common known Character of the Per∣son
I was describing. I have observ'd the
same Method with regard to Facts, as well
<PB REF="17"/>
as Persons, throughout the Course of this
History; and where I have met with any
essential Difference, or manifest Contra∣diction,
I have taken notice of it as such
in the Body of the Story.</P>
<P>If we consider how many Volumes re∣lating
to the Affairs of the <HI>Grecians</HI> have
been lost, we might expect more Confusi∣on,
and greater Chasms in their Story, than
there really are: But it happens very for∣tunately,
that some of their best Writers,
and of the best Authority, are still re∣maining,
particularly <HI>Thucydides, Xenophon</HI>
and <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> who had a great Share
in the Transactions they relate, and were
otherwise most remarkable for their Pro∣bity
and Veracity. So that the <HI>Groecia
mendax</HI> of <HI>Juvenal</HI> cannot be thought ap∣plicable
to these Writers, or to the Times
in which they flourish'd, but must be un∣derstood
only of the <HI>Fabulous Age,</HI> which
undoubtedly is a fitter Subject for the Ex∣travagancies
of Poetry, than for the Gra∣vity
of an Historian. I have accordingly
consider'd it in that light, and have gone
no further into it than I found necessary, in
<PB REF="18"/>
order to make a beginning, and to intro∣duce
the more solid and authentick Parts
of the Story. And herein I am sufficiently
warranted by the Example of our own
Historians, who have not contented them∣selves
with the wild Accounts of the an∣cient
<HI>Britons,</HI> but have had recourse to
the <HI>Trojan Brute</HI> as our Founder: And the
<HI>Scottish</HI> Writers begin their Relations from
a Son of <HI>Cecrops</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> or of <HI>Ar∣gus,</HI>
who lived an hundred Years before
him. And tho' there is no great Stress laid
upon these early Accounts, they are sufficient
to shew, that we have grafted upon the
same Stock of <HI>Fable</HI> as the <HI>Grecians,</HI> or
rather carried it further, and grafted one
Fable upon another: And the same Vani∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
has prevail'd in several other Parts of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here I cannot help observing, how much
it is to the honour of <HI>Greece,</HI> that so many
Nations have laid claim to her as their
common Mother; and that they have in∣vented
so many Fictions and Forgeries to
be consider'd as <HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies, when
they might more naturally, and with more
<PB REF="19"/>
Credibility, have drawn their Descent from
some imaginary Heroes of their own. But
it was the establish'd Fame, and the real
Merit of <HI>Greece,</HI> that made them so fond
of being allied to her: It was the Learn∣ing,
Wit and Delicacy of <HI>Athens,</HI> the Laws
and Discipline of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and the Valour
and Love of Liberty throughout the whole
Country, which put them upon forming
these Pretensions, in hopes that, by calling
themselves <HI>Grecians,</HI> they should be thought
to inherit their Virtues, and to act upon
their Principles. And in some Respects
they have copied after them, particularly
in their Forms of Government, which
have serv'd as Models to several consider∣able
States in this Part of the World, but
with such Variations and Improvements,
as the Wisdom of the later ages has found
necessary. For tho' the general Plan of
Government in <HI>Greece</HI> was founded upon
Principles of Liberty, there were great Er∣rors
and Defects in it, which I have cur∣sorily
taken notice of, in relating the Tu∣mults
and Disorders that have been occa∣sion'd
by them. Some of these Imper∣fections
<PB REF="20"/>
are still retain'd in the Republicks
which are now subsisting in <HI>Europe;</HI>
and others have been added, by refining
too much, and aiming at more Perfection
than that sort of Government is capable of.
I know there have been several Attempts
to shew, that there may be such a thing as
a perfect Common-wealth: But how plau∣sible
soever the Arguments for it may ap∣pear
in Writing, they are not easily to be
reduc'd to Practice, so as to prevent the
Tyranny of <HI>The Few</HI> in an <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> or
the Licentiousness of <HI>The Many</HI> in a <HI>De∣mocracy.</HI>
This was the Case of the two
principal States of <HI>Greece,</HI> upon which most
of the others were founded.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sparta</HI> indeed, according to the Set∣tlement
of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> there was the Ap∣pearance
of a limited Monarchy; but it
was too limited, first by the Authority of
the Senate, and afterwards of the <HI>Ephori,</HI>
who, tho' they were originally instituted
only as a Barrier between the Senate and
the People, soon became the supreme Ma∣gistrates,
and were superior to the Kings
in every thing but the Name. However
<PB REF="21"/>
the Government subsisted long under this
Form; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth
was founded upon it, the <HI>Consuls</HI> Answer∣ing
to the two <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings, and the
<HI>Tribunes of the People</HI> to the <HI>Ephori.</HI> But
these <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrates had greater Power,
and made a worse use of it, especially the
<HI>Tribunes,</HI> who, under colour of protecting
the People in their just Rights, became
the Authors of most of the Seditions, Tu∣mults,
Murthers and civil Discord, which
happen'd in the most busy Times of the
Common-wealth. As in <HI>Sparta</HI> the Power
of the Kings was too much restrain'd, so
in <HI>Athens</HI> the Power of the People was too
excessive; and nothing but some middle
Scheme between these Extremes, can be
suppos'd to answer the true Ends of Go∣vernment.
I might from hence take occa∣sion
to extol the Happiness of our own
Constitution, which is so equally poiz'd by
a due Distribution of Power on the one
hand, and of Liberty on the other. But
perhaps some may think the Boundary
Lines between them are drawn so fine, as
not to be easily perceptible; at least this is
<PB REF="22"/>
the most plausible Pretence for the many
Party-Disputes among us, and the best way
of accounting for our frequent Alarms and
Jealousies, lest one Part of the Constitution
should break in, and make Encroachments
upon the other. These are bad Effects,
but they proceed from a good Cause; and
however some Particulars may be affected
by them, they have seldom gone so far,
as to endanger the Safety of the Whole:
So that notwithstanding these Inconveni∣ences,
we are in the main much happier
than any of our Neighbours, who reproach
us with them; and our Liberty is better
secured to us, than it could be in any of
the Republicks of <HI>Greece,</HI> or in any of
those Regal Governments in <HI>Europe,</HI> which,
tho' they were form'd upon the same Mo∣del
with ours, have now very little Re∣mains
of their original Institution. I have
made a further Digression from my Subject
than I intended: But in speaking of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Governments, and of those which
have been grafted upon them, I could not,
as an <HI>Englishman,</HI> resist the Temptation of
saying something in Preference of our own,
<PB REF="23"/>
which is certainly the nearest to Perfection,
and is attended with very few Evils, but
such as are of our own making.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> I have rather
chose to finish my Account of it with the
Death of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> than to carry
it on to his Successor. For the Affairs of
<HI>Alexander,</HI> besides that they are already
related by others in a fuller and more un∣broken
manner, than those of the prece∣ding
Times, are not, strictly speaking, to
be look'd upon as a Continuation of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Story, since they relate almost en∣tirely
to <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI> Some in∣deed
of the <HI>Grecians</HI> took occasion, from
the Absence of <HI>Alexander</HI> in his <HI>Eastern</HI>
Expedition, to attempt the Recovery of
their Liberty; but he soon return'd upon
them; and by the Destruction of <HI>Thebes,</HI>
and the Victory afterwards obtain'd over
the <HI>Peloponnesians</HI> by <HI>Antipater</HI> his Viceroy
in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> he struck such a Terror into
the whole Country, that he kept them in
a quiet Subjection; so that if he had liv'd
to return again into <HI>Grecce;</HI> he would have
found it very easy to annex it to his own
<PB REF="24"/>
Dominions, and to destroy the very Name
of it. However the <HI>Grecians</HI> still subsisted,
but in so low and lifeless a Condition, that
from the Time of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Captains, till
they were subdu'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> there
were very few among them, who were
distinguish'd for Arms and Counsels, and
not many for Arts and Learning: So that,
except the famous League of the <HI>Achaian</HI>
under <HI>Aratus</HI> and <HI>Philopoemen,</HI> and the En∣deavours
of <HI>Agis</HI> and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> to recover
the State of <HI>Sparta</HI> from the Encroach∣ments
of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> there is very little
worth recording.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Victory of <HI>Lysander</HI> was
so terrible a Shock to <HI>Athens,</HI>
that tho' she gather'd Strength
enough to survive it, she could
never perfectly recover it. From
a Prospect of bringing the War
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o an happy Issue, she found herself in one Hour
<PB N="2" REF="28"/>
reduced to the lowest ebb of Fortune, and lay
at the Mercy of those whom she had so lately in∣sulted:
For the Terms obtain'd by the las<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Treaty, amounted to little more than surrender∣ing
at Discretion. So that from hence we ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
date the <HI>Fall of the</HI> Athenian <HI>Empire,</HI> which be∣gan
soon after the Defeat of the <HI>Persians</HI> at <HI>My
cale,</HI> and continued about seventy three Years
However the Conquerors were so generous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not wholly to extinguish the Name of <HI>Athen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
They said, <HI>They would not be guilty of putting ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one of the Eyes of</HI> Greece. And this agrees wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what <HI>Plutarch</HI> relates of <HI>Lysander,</HI> That when h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sent word to <HI>Sparta, That the</HI> Athenians <HI>were ta∣ken,</HI>
the Magistrates wrote back to him, <HI>It is su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ficient to have taken them.</HI> But it is certain, they
imposed some further Marks of their Conque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on them: Of which the most particular was
that they obliged the People to break up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<HI>Democracy,</HI> and submit to the Government o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Thirty Men, who are commonly known by the
Name of <HI>The Thirty Tyrants.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Thirty Tyrants. A. M. 3601. Olymp. 94. 1.</NOTE> This Change wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
owing chiefly to <HI>Lysander,</HI> who about the same
time introduced the <HI>Oligarchy</HI> into <HI>Samos,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
other Places, which he took in as tributary t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Athens.</HI> In most of them he establish'd a <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
cemvirate,</HI> which was modell'd according to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Directions, and made up of his own Creature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
And thus he treated not only the Enemies, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Allies of <HI>Sparta;</HI> by which means he had in
manner engross'd to himself the whole Empire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="29"/>
Having settled his Conquests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lysander returns in triumph to Sparta.</NOTE> he returned in
triumph to <HI>Sparta</HI> with the <HI>Athenian</HI> and other
Gallies, and fifteen hundred Talents in Mony,
together with a great deal of rich Booty, besides
the Crowns of Gold and other Presents which had
been made him by the several Cities. He sent
the Mony to <HI>Sparta</HI> in sealed Bags by <HI>Gylippus,</HI>
who, ripping up the bottom of the Bags, took
out as much as he thought fit, and then sew'd
them up again. But there happen'd to be a
Note in each Bag, specifying the Sum contain'd
in it, which <HI>Gylippus</HI> not being appris'd of, the
Fraud by this means was detected: And there∣upon,
either to avoid Punishment, or out of
Shame for having been guilty of so mean an
Action, he banish'd himself, and never afterwards
appear'd in <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>There was a further Consideration in regard to
this Treasure, whether, according to the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Laws, it ought to be received into the City.
Many of the soberest and most discreet among
them oppos'd the introducing it; and they were
the more confirmed in their Opinion from this
Instance of <HI>Gylippus,</HI> who, they found, had been
so far influenc'd by Mony, as to give up every
thing else for it, and to sully all the Glory of his
past Actions: For he was otherwise a Man of
great Reputation, and had acquitted himself ex∣tremely
well in the War of <HI>Sicily,</HI> where he had
the Command of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Troops: And it
was owing chiefly to him, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> did
<PB N="4" REF="30"/>
not make themselves Masters of that Island.
Hereupon the <HI>Ephori</HI> were obliged to pass a De∣cree,
that none but the old Iron Mony of the
Country should be made current. But <HI>Lysander</HI>'s
Friends would not yet give it up: They resumed
the Debate, and got the Decree revers'd, or at least
so far qualified, that this Mony, tho' it was to be
admitted into the City, was to be employ'd
only on publick Occasions; and it was made
capital to convert it to any private use. But
this did not answer the Intent of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI>
which was, by prohibiting the use of Gold and
Silver, to restrain Covetousness and Luxury.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> observes upon this occasion, That the
ill Consequence of Riches was not so effectually
prevented, by forbidding the use of Mony in pri∣vate,
as it was encouraged, by allowing it in pub∣lick:
That therefore this sort of Prohibition on∣ly
heighten'd their Desires; and that, if their
Actions did not presently break out, at least thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Affections were tainted. Whatever was pretend∣ed
of laying in a Fund to supply the Exigencie
of the State, the use of Mony had now got foot∣ing
among them; they began to know the Valu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of it as well as their Neighbours, and rais'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
by more arbitrary and oppressive Methods. <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dorus
Siculus</HI> says, They exacted Tribute fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
all the Cities under their Jurisdiction, and tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sur'd up a thousand Talents every Year. Upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the whole, it is certain that the introducing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Treasure, was in effect a Change in the Constintion;
<PB N="5" REF="31"/>
it soften'd their Minds so as to prepare
them for Corruption; and in short, was the first
great Step towards their throwing off that rugged
Virtue, which distinguish'd them so much from
the rest of <HI>Greece.</HI> This Change was owing in∣tirely
to <HI>Lysander,</HI> who sacrificed every thing to
his Ostentation and Vanity, and stuck at no Ex∣pence
to gratify them. He erected his own, and
several of the chief Commanders Statues in Brass.
He was very liberal to those of his Retinue,
and gave such Encouragement to the Poets, that
they complimented him with Songs of Tri∣umph,
and employ'd all their Art in his Praises.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> in general were so aw'd with his
Merit, that they erected Altars to his Honour,
and sacrificed to him as a God.</P>
<P>In the mean time while <HI>The Thirty</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣ceedings of <HI>The Thir∣ty</HI></NOTE> 
instead of compiling and publishing a more per∣fect
Body of Laws, which was the Pretence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
their being chosen, began to exert their Power
of Life and Death: And tho' they constituted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Senate and other Magistrates, they made no
further use of them, than to confirm their Au∣thority,
and to see their Commands executed.
However they at first acted cautiously, and con∣demn'd
only the most detested and scandalous
part of the Citizens, such as lived by Eviden∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
and Informing. But this was only to give
a colour to their Proceedings; their Design was
to make themselves absolute; and knowing that
was not to be done without a Foreign Power,
<PB N="6" REF="32"/>
their next Step was to desire a Guard might be
sent them from <HI>Sparta,</HI> till such time as they
could clear the City of all disaffected Persons,
and throughly settle the Government. <HI>Lysander</HI>
accordingly procured them a Guard under the
Command of <HI>Callibius,</HI> whom by Bribes and Ar∣tifices
they work'd over to their Designs, and then
acted without Controul, filling the City with the
Blood of those, who, on account of their Riches,
Interest, or good Qualities, were most likely to
make head against them. The most violent a∣mong
them was <HI>Critias,</HI> who resolved to reek
his Revenge on the People, by whom he had
formerly been banished.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Therame∣nes</HI> protests against them.</NOTE> The first who protest∣ed
against these Proceedings was <HI>Theramenes,</HI> one
of their own Memhers: And lest he should joi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the Power, and by their Assistance disarmed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
rest. Being throughly embolden'd by such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Accession to their Party, they agreed to singl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
out every one his Man, to put them to death
and seize their Estates for the Maintenance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Garrison: Amongst whom was <HI>Nicerat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
the Son of <HI>Nicias,</HI> a Man of the greatest Esta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<PB N="7" REF="33"/>
Senate, of endeavouring to subvert the Govern∣ment.
From thence he took occasion to justify
their Proceedings in general; as, <HI>That it was ne∣cessary
to abridge the People in some measure of that
Liberty with which they had so long been pamper'd;
That all Changes of Government were attended
with Blood, and therefore it was no wonder that
they had so many Enemies: But that it was unpar∣donable
in one of their own Order to desert them,
and to betray that Power, which, by accepting a
Share of it, he had promised to maintain. Thera∣menes</HI>
made so full and handsom a Defence, that
the Senate were inclined to favour him: Which
<HI>Critias</HI> perceiving, and knowing that, as one of
<HI>The Three Thousand,</HI> he had a Privilege of be∣ing
tried in form, he struck his Name out of the
List, in order to subject him more immediate∣ly
to their Censure. It was justly urged by <HI>The∣ramenes,
That it was as easy to blot out any other
Man's Name as his; and that therefore they ought
to make his Case their own.</HI> But as they were un∣der
no present Apprehension of that kind, or
rather that they were aw'd by a Guard, which
<HI>Critias</HI> had placed before the Bar of the Court,
they durst not oppose the Tyrants, who taking
advantage of their Silence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is con∣demn'd and executed.</NOTE> immediately pass'd
Sentence of Death upon him; which he suffer'd
by the Juice of <HI>Hemlock.</HI> When he had drank
his Dose, he threw away what was left in the
Cup, and said, <HI>This to honest</HI> Critias. <HI>Socrates,</HI>
whose Disciple he had been, was the only one
<PB N="8" REF="34"/>
of the Senate, who ventur'd to appear in his De∣fence;
he made an Attempt to rescue him out
of the Hands of the Officer of Justice; and af∣ter
his Execution, went about, as it were, in de∣fiance
of <HI>The Thirty,</HI> exhorting and animating
the Senators and Citizens against them. <HI>Critias<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
who had likewise been his Scholar, was so alarm'd
and incens'd at his Behaviour, that he forba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him instructing the Youth. But he went o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the same Intrepidity, and without any re∣gard
to his Authority. The Tyrants, whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they were aw'd with his Merit, or his Resolu∣tion,
did not think fit to proceed against him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
But as he continued to use the same Freedom
with the Government, it soon after cost him his
Life, as in its proper Place will be more particu∣larly
related. As to <HI>Theramenes,</HI> the People ex∣press'd
a greater Concern for him, than could
have been expected for one of that Society. But
he was indeed the only one among them, from
whom they had any thing to hope for, as a Bar∣rier
between them and the Tyranny. When he
first engaged with them, he was upon the strict∣est
Terms of Friendship with <HI>Critias,</HI> and they
had always acted together in concert: But when
he sound what Measures the other was pursuing,
he oppos'd him, and broke with him.</P>
<P>He had appear'd in most of the late Contests
betwixt the Nobility and the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> and
was active, but not violent; endeavouring rather
to accommodate himself to both Parties, than to
<PB N="9" REF="35"/>
depress eithr: From whence his Enemies gave
him the Name of <HI>The Buskin,</HI> as it serves either
Foot. But his shifting Sides proceeded not so
much from the Unevenness of his Temper, as
from his Caution and Moderation, which made
him distinguish betwixt the Rule and the Ty∣ranny.
He had some time before shewn his In∣clination
to an <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> having been principal∣ly
concerned with <HI>Pisander</HI> and <HI>Antiphon</HI> in in∣troducing
the Government of <HI>The Four Hundred:</HI>
And in this latter Instance, he seems to have had
some Plan of that kind in his view: For he
thought <HI>The Thirty</HI> too few to carry on the Ad∣ministration,
and propos'd the adding some
competent number to them. On the other hand,
he was as much against the letting in <HI>The Three
Thousand,</HI> which he saw, was only arming one
part of the Citizens against the rest. He was,
according to the mildness of his Nature, for
some middle Scheme, whereby the Power of
the Multitude might be restrain'd, but not to∣tally
abolished. But whatever his Designs were,
he had not weight enough to put them in exe∣cution;
and therefore sell a Sacrifice to the ho∣nesty
of his Intentions. The greatest Blot upon
his Memory, is, his being instrumental in the
Condemnation of the Admirals, after the Fight
at <HI>Arginusae.</HI></P>
<P>The Tyrants having remov'd this Obstacle
out of their way, renew'd their Outrages with
more Security, taking off all whom they thought
<PB N="10" REF="36"/>
any way obnoxious, or in any capacity of ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>structing
their Designs. Whilst they were thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
destroying with Sword and Rapine, the wretch∣ed
Remainder of the Citizens cast their Thought
on <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and were struck with Remorse for
their last ill Usage of him. But as he had be∣fore
overlook'd their Peevishness, and reliev'd
them in their Extremities; so neither were they
now without hopes, that he might appear again
to rescue them. And the Tyrants themselves
were so apprehensive of it, that they were very
solicitous to get Intelligence of all his Designs
and Actions. <HI>Critias</HI> at last represented to <HI>Ly∣sander,</HI>
that either the Government, or <HI>Alcibiades</HI>
must fall; and, after many Solicitations, so far pre∣vail'd,
that Orders were given to dispatch him.
He resided at that time in a small Village in
<HI>Phrygia,</HI> where he was making an Interest with
<HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> to recommend him to his Master
<HI>Artaxerxes. Lysander</HI> made it a Request to
<HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> to deliver him up either alive or
dead; and laid such stress upon it, that he seem'd
to make it a Condition of the League between
the <HI>Spartans</HI> and the <HI>Persians.</HI> He consented to
it, and committed the Execution to his Brother
and his Uncle; who surrounding the House,
where he dwelt with his Mistress <HI>Timandra,</HI> set
fire to it. <HI>Alcibiades</HI> threw in great quantities of
Clothes and Furniture to choke the Flame; then
with his Robe on his left Arm, and his Sword
in the other hand, he made his way through it:
<PB N="11" REF="37"/>
Which the Assassins perceiving,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alcibiades</HI> murther'd.</NOTE> retreated, and
slew him at a distance with their Darts and Ar∣rows.
Some ascribe this Murther to <HI>Pharnaba∣zus</HI>
his own private Jealousy of him; others to
the Resentment of some young Noblemen whose
Sister he had debauch'd. And others say, he had
got into the Secret of the Levy, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> was
making for the Expedition against his Brother,
and was endeavouring, by the Discovery of it to
<HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> to ingratiate himself with that Prince,
and to procure his Assistance for re-establing the
Affairs of his Country; that therefore it became
necessary to take him off. But whatever Cause
they assign for his Death, they are generally a∣greed
as to the manner of it; which indeed
was suitable to that Extravagance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> with which
Fortune had all along treated him. And there∣in
she did but second the variety of Nature, who
seems in his Composition to have work'd up the
most jarring Contradictions, and to have tried
how far she could go, in reconciling the Ex∣tremes
of Vice and Virtue. But it is to be
doubted whether his Virtues ought, upon a strict
Examination, to bear that Name; and whether
they ought not rather to be call'd extraordinary
Talents and Endowments, and Ways of recom∣mending
himself. They had more of Artifice
and Design, of Popularity and Ostentation, than
of any real Principle of Honour and justice, or
Love of his Country. And therefore <HI>Valcrius
Maximus</HI> makes it a question, Whether his good
<PB N="12" REF="38"/>
or bad Qualities were most hurtful to the Pub∣lick:
<HI>By the former,</HI> says he, <HI>he deceived his Fel∣low-Citizens,
and by the latter he ruin'd them.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
first insinuated himself into their Confidence
and then put them upon fruitless and desperat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Projects; particularly that fatal Expedition against
<HI>Sicily,</HI> where their Fleets and Armies moulder'd
away, when they had need enough of them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
home; and this paved the way for their tota<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Overthrow by <HI>Lysander.</HI> His View in these En∣terprises,
was not only to procure Honour to
himself, but also to make himself necessary, and
to keep the People employ'd, so that they should
not be at leisure to inquire into his Conduct.
He likewise found his account in the Presents
that were made him abroad, and in that respect
he was both greedy and corrupt; and yet his ta∣king
them was not so much for the sake of the
Mony, as to support his Popularity and Luxu∣ry.
His natural bent was certainly Pleasure; and
yet as much as he lov'd it, he made it give way
to his Ambition: But he was so violent, and
withal so irregular and capricious in the Pursuit
of it, that there was no living with him upon
any equal sooting. He was any thing, and every
thing, by fits and starts, and just as it suited his
present purpose; one while for the <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> and
then as great a Stickler for the <HI>Democracy;</HI> one
while in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Interest, in order to re∣venge
himself of his Country, and then in the
<HI>Persian,</HI> in order to be reconcil'd to it. The
<PB N="13" REF="39"/>
People, it must be confes'd, were no less une∣qual
and inconstant in their behaviour to him;
from whence it happen'd, that, according to
the Temper they were in, or according to the
occasion they had for his Service, he was look'd
upon as the best or worst Member of the Com∣mon-wealth,
and was either caress'd and ador'd,
or detested and persecuted. And yet, upon the
whole, they had such an opinion of his Merit,
that tho' they were never easy with him, they
never thought themselves safe without him. <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>
makes a Remark, That his Enemies could
never get the better of him but in his Absence;
which must be attributed to his Subtilty and
Address, and more especially to the Amiableness
of his Person, and the Force of his Eloquence,
which <HI>Nepos</HI> says, No body could resist. But
tho' by these means he captivated the generality
of the Citizens; yet the gravest and most con∣siderable
among them saw further into the Dis∣guise,
and were more upon their guard against
him. Upon this occasion the Warning that was
given them by <HI>Timon</HI> the <HI>Man-hater,</HI> of what
they were to expect from him, may be worth re∣membring.
It happen'd one Day, that <HI>Alcibia∣des</HI>
having succeeded well in an Oration, the
whole Assembly attended to compliment him
upon it; and <HI>Timon,</HI> instead of avoiding him,
as he did others in the like Cases, put himself in
his way, and taking him by the Hand, said, <HI>Go
on boldly, my Son; may'st thou increase in Credit
<PB N="14" REF="40"/>
with the People; for thou wilt one Day bring them
Calamities enough.</HI> He was scarce above forty
Years old when he died; by which time he had
done enough to make himself by turns the Sup∣port
and Terror, not only of his own Country,
but of several other Parts both in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI>
And he had been still greater, if he had been as
careful to preserve the People's Love, as he was
to obtain it. But the Management of Prosperi∣ty
was not his Talent: And therefore the fairest
View of him is to be taken from his Suffer∣ings;
which, as they were often unjust, set off
his good Qualities to a greater Advantage, and
consequently made his Fall the more lamented,
especially at a time when he was so much wanted.
Having given a general Character of this great
Man, when I first mention'd him, I have here
only added such further Observations, as were
necessary to illustrate it, and which have natural∣ly
occur'd upon a more distinct Survey of his
Actions.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants not being able to bear the se∣vere
Treatment they met with from <HI>The Thirty,</HI>
fled daily in great numbers out of the City, by
which means all <HI>Greece</HI> was overspread with <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
Exiles; till at last the <HI>Spartans</HI> published an
Edict, forbidding any of their Cities to receive
them; so that they were forced to betake them∣selves
to <HI>Thebes</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> and such other Places,
where they could live in any tolerable Security.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="41"/>
The first who appear'd to stem this Torrent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thrasybu∣lus</HI> opposes <HI>The Thir∣ty.</HI></NOTE> 
was <HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> who had done good Service in
the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War; insomuch that <HI>Alcibiades</HI>
is said to owe most of his Success to his acting
in concert with him: But his Merit being not
of so glaring a kind, was in a great measure
eclips'd by that General, till it broke out upon
this occasion of exerting himself alone, and in
such a Cause as the Subversion of Tyranny. At
<HI>Thebes</HI> he fell into a Consultation with his Fel∣low-Citizens;
and the Result was, That some
vigorous Effort, tho' it carried never so much
Danger with it, ought to be made for the Re∣covery
of the publick Liberty: Accodingly,
with a Party of Thirty Men only, as <HI>Nepos</HI> says;
but, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> more probably says, of near Se∣venty,
he seized upon <HI>Phyle</HI> a strong Castle on
the Frontiers of <HI>Attica.</HI> This Enterprise gave
the Alarm to <HI>The Tyrants,</HI> who immediately
march'd out of the City with <HI>The Three Thou∣sand,</HI>
and their <HI>Spartan</HI> Guard, and attempted the
Recovery of the Place, but were repuls'd with
loss. Finding they could not carry it by a sud∣den
Assault, they resolved upon a Siege; but be∣ing
not sufficiently provided for that Service, and
a great Snow falling that Night, they were forced
to retire the next Day into the City, leaving on∣ly
part of their Guard, to prevent any further
Excursions into the Country.</P>
<P>By this first Success <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> had increas'd
his Followers to the number of Seven hundred;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc∣cess.</NOTE> 
<PB N="16" REF="42"/>
with which he made a Sally upon the Guards, and
dispers'd and routed them, with the Slaughter of
about an hundred and twenty. <HI>The Thirty</HI> in the
mean while, were under great Consternation;
and for sear of Treachery from those few who
were left in the City, they forced them to
quit it. Then they fortified <HI>Eleusis,</HI> to serve
them upon any sudden Exigency, as a Place of
Retreat. And, to free themselves from any Jea∣lousy
the Inhabitants might give them, they
caused all who were able to bear Arms, to
pass One by One, as it were upon a Re∣view,
in order to compute the Strength of
the Garrison, and murder'd them. At the
same time they attempted to corrupt <HI>Thrasy∣bulus,</HI>
and sent under colour of treating about
Prisoners, to make him a private Offer of
sharing with them in the Government, toge∣ther
with the Liberty of restoring any Ten of
the Exiles, whom he should name, upon Con∣dition
he would dismiss the rest, and come in∣to
their Measures. To which Proposal he ge∣nerously
answer'd, <HI>That he look'd upon his Ba∣nishment
to be far more honourable, than the whole
Power and Dominion of</HI> The Thirty; <HI>and that be
would never put up his Sword, till all the Citi∣zens
from every Part were receiv'd, and restor'd
to the Liberties derived to them from their An∣cestors.</HI></P>
<P>By
this time he had got together a Body of
a thousand Men; with which he march'd out of
<PB N="17" REF="43"/>
<HI>Phyle</HI> by Night, and seiz'd on the <HI>Piraeus. The
Thirty</HI> coming with their whole Strength to the
Relief of it, he took advantage of the Ground'
made the best Disposition of his Men, then re∣minded
them of the Cause they were engaged
in, and the Success they had hitherto met with,
and offer'd the Enemy Battle; wherein he easi∣ly
obtain'd the Victory; which indeed was more
remarkable for the Consequence of it, than the
Number of the Slain, wich were about Seven∣ty;
but among them were <HI>Critias</HI> and <HI>Hippoma∣cbus,</HI>
two of the chief of the Tyrants.</P>
<P>A Truce being granted for delivering up the
dead Bodies, both Sides came to a Parley; and
<HI>Thrasybulus</HI> took that occasion to expostalate with
them, asking them, <HI>Why they fled from a Con∣queror,
whom they ought rather to join as the As∣sertor
of the Publick Liberty;</HI> adding, <HI>That his
Army was compos'd of Citizens, and not of Ene∣mies;
that he came not to rob or plunder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>than, but
to restore them to their own;</HI> in short, <HI>That his
Quarrel was to the Tyrants, not to the City.</HI> Then
he reminded them. <HI>How they were tied to one ano∣ther
by all the Obligations of Religion, Laws and
Consanguinity; how they had served in the same
Camp, and sought under the same Colours.</HI> He
conjur'd them, <HI>That, if they themselves could pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iently
submit to the Yoke, they would at least have
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Pity for their Fellow-Citizens, who were ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ished
for no other Reason, but because they would
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot be Slaves;</HI> concluding, <HI>That if they would re∣store
<PB N="18" REF="44"/>
him to his Country, he would restore them to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Liberty.</HI> It is probable this Speech may be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
consounded with another to the same effect, by
some ascribed to <HI>Cleocritus;</HI> but it is certain, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

in these Outrages, that, upon their Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turn

that they ought not to let their Country b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sander,</HI> who represented it as a new Affront o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

fer'd to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> in revolting from them,
and dissolving the Form of Government, which
they had prescribed to them; and thereupon he
procured them from the State an hundred Ta∣lents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lysander</HI> sent to sup∣port them.</NOTE> with a Commission for himself to go Ge∣neral,
and his Brother <HI>Libys</HI> Admiral, in order
to block up the <HI>Piraeus</HI> by Sea and Land. Ac∣cordingly
he march'd with a strong Body of
<HI>Peloponnesians;</HI> and the Admiral suffer'd no Pro∣visions
to go in by Sea; by which means those
in the <HI>Piraeus</HI> were distress'd on all sides.</P>
<P>While things were in this Posture,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pausanias</HI> sent after him.</NOTE> <HI>Pausanias,</HI>
one of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings, got leave to follow
<HI>Lysander</HI> with another Body, to support him.
But his Design was not so much to assist, as to
watch him; he could not allow him the Glory
of conquering <HI>Athens</HI> a second time; and there∣fore
went rather to trifle, and perplex the War,
than to prosecute it to any real Advantage: So
that what some call his Commiseration of the
poor <HI>Athenians,</HI> was in reality the Envy he bore
to <HI>Lysander.</HI> It is also observable, that in ma∣king
his Levies for this Expedition out of the
Forces in Alliance with <HI>Spar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> the <HI>Boeotians</HI> and
<HI>Corinthians,</HI> who had all along been the most ac∣tive
and profess'd Enemies of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> re∣sused
now to serve against them, alledging, that
They could not salve their Oath in making War
upon those, who had not broke any one Article
of the League. But the truth is, they appre∣hended
the Power of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> concluding,
<PB N="20" REF="46"/>
They would make an entire Conquest of <HI>Athens,</HI>
and annex it to their own Dominions. This is
the first Instance of that Jealousy, which soon
after several other States of <HI>Greece</HI> conceived of
<HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pausanias,</HI> before any Act of Hostility on his
side, sent to those in the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> to depart every
one to his respective home; and, upon their
Refusal, having drawn up his Men, and made
a slight Attack, he went to view the Ground
for opening the Trenches: But the Enemy
made a Sally, and gall'd him so in his Retreat,
that from Skirmishing, he was forc'd to bring it
to a regular Action, which was fought obsti∣nately
enough on both sides, till at length the
<HI>Athenians</HI> were routed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Routs</HI> the Athenians</NOTE> with the loss of an hun∣dred
and fifty Men, and <HI>Pausanias</HI> erected a
Trophy.</P>
<P>But instead of pushing his Victory, he sent
privately to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that they should dis∣patch
Ambassadors to him, and the two <HI>Ephori</HI>
who attended him in the Field, to offer Terms
of Accommodation. Accordingly they sent
their Deputies both from the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and the Ci∣ty,
and a Peace was concluded upon these Con∣ditions;
<HI>That every Man should return home, ex∣cept</HI>
The Thirty, <HI>and</HI> The Ten, <HI>and Eleven mort
who had commanded in the</HI> Piraeus. <HI>And if any in
the City apprehended themselves to be obnoxious,
they should also be free to retire with them to</HI> Eleu∣sis.
After which <HI>Pausanias</HI> drew off the <HI>Spartan</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="47"/>
Army, and those in the <HI>Piraeus</HI> march'd with
their Arms into the City; where <HI>Thrasybulus</HI>
having, among other things, reproach'd the Ci∣tizens
with their calling the <HI>Spartans</HI> in to their
Assistance, told them, <HI>They had nothing further
to fear, provided they would be governed by their
ancient Laws;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The De∣mocracy <HI>restored.</HI></NOTE> and so far prevail'd upon them,
that they chose their Magistrates as formerly, and
restored the <HI>Democracy.</HI></P>
<P>But the City had no sooner began to recover
Breath, when the Remainder of the Faction at
<HI>Eleusis</HI> were hiring Foreign Troops, in order to
make another Attempt: Whereupon the whole
City went out against them; and having taken
their Commanders upon a Pretence of coming
to a Parley, cut them to pieces; after which the
rest were easily brought to an Accommodation.
And lest the Remembrance of former Trans∣actions
should create any new Disturbances, a
General <HI>Amnesty</HI> was pass'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general Amnesly.</NOTE> and every Man ob∣liged
himself by Oath, to bury what was pass'd
in Oblivion: Which being religiously observed,
the City was restored to its former Tranquillity,
and its Members were again united into one
Body.</P>
<P>Thus ended this Sedition in the third after
its breaking out upon the Change of the Go∣vernment;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 94. 3.</NOTE> during which time the State suffer'd
such Convulsions, as proved more fatal to it than
the War. There were fourteen hundred Citi∣zens
put to death without hearing, and those
<PB N="22" REF="48"/>
chiefly Men of Note and Condition. There
were above Five Thousand more forced to fly
into the <HI>Piraeus:</HI> And <HI>Xenophon</HI> observes, that
this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>stine Fury had consumed as many in
eight Months, as the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War did in
Ten Years. As the Flame was kindled by the
Tyranny of <HI>The Thirty,</HI> so it was all along fo∣mented
and kept alive by the Ambition of <HI>Ly∣sander:</HI>
And that it was at last extinguished, is
almost intirely owing to the Conduct and Reso∣lution
of <HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> who, after the share he had
in rescuing his Country from a Foreign Enemy,
had the peculiar Glory of suppressing its in∣testine
Foes, and, by that means, of restoring the
City to itself. And in effecting this, he shew'd the
greatest Temper and Moderation; which indeed
were necessary in such a Conjuncture, to appease
the Minds of the People, and to reconcile them
to one another. Hence it was, that this <HI>Act</HI>
of <HI>Oblivion</HI> became a Pattern to succeeding
Ages; and <HI>Cicero</HI> recommends it as such to the
People of <HI>Rome,</HI> when the City was divided into
Factions upon the Murther of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Re-establishment of Affairs in <HI>Athens,</HI>
the other States enjoyed the same Tranquillity,
or rather kept in a quiet Subjection to <HI>Sparta,</HI>
which now held the undoubted Sovereignty of
<HI>Greece.</HI> But it being a Maxim with the <HI>Spar∣tans,</HI>
that this Sovereignty was not to be main∣tain'd
but by a constant course of Action, they
were still seeking fresh Occasions of War: And

part of their Forces, together with another Bo∣dy
of <HI>Grecians,</HI> being at this time engaged in a
Quarrel between the <HI>Persian</HI> King and his Bro∣ther,
it will be necessary to pass over into <HI>Asia,</HI>
and relate so much of the <HI>Persian</HI> Affairs, as con∣cerns
<HI>The Expedition of</HI> Cyrus, wherein those
Forces were employ'd; especially since it is at∣tended
with Circumstances, which, if duly con∣sider'd,
will easily make it pass for one of the
greatest Actions of Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> upon his Death-bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 94. 4.</NOTE> 
for his two Sons, <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> and <HI>Cyrus;</HI> the
former whereof he declared his Successor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of the Expe∣dition of Cyrus.</NOTE> and
the other General of a part of his Troops; and
he had before appointed him Commander in
chief of the Maritime Provinces. The old King
being dead, <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> who went up with <HI>Cy∣rus</HI>
from his Government, accused him to his
Brother of Treason: But upon the Intercession
of his Mother <HI>Parisatis,</HI> not only his Life was
spared, but he was confirmed in his Govern∣ment.
And yet he was no sooner returned to
it, but he studied how to revenge this Affront,
and to dethrone his Brother. To this end, he
practised with the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and
made Levies of the best Soldiers of <HI>Peloponne∣sus,</HI>
in order to recruit his Garrisons; the Pre∣tence
for which was, his Distrust of <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI>
from whom he had taken all the Cities of <HI>Ionia,</HI>
except <HI>Miletus;</HI> and that he had block'd up by
Sea and Land, under colour of restoring some
<PB N="24" REF="50"/>
whom <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> had banished, upon a Suspi∣cion
of their betraying him. The King was
not much concerned at his Quarrel with <HI>Tissa∣phernes,</HI>
so long as he thought these Levies were
designed against him only; and he was the more
confirmed in this Opinion, because <HI>Cyrus</HI> con∣tinued
to send him up the Tribute due from those
Places, as before.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> in the mean while held Intelligence
with <HI>Clearchus, Aristippus</HI> and other <HI>Grecians,</HI>
who were either banish'd from their respective
Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His mak∣ing Levies.</NOTE> or disgusted in them; and by their
means got together, upon several different Pre∣tences,
One little Army in the <HI>Chersonese</HI> of
<HI>Thrace,</HI> a Second upon the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and a Third
in <HI>Thessaly.</HI> When his Designs were ripe, he
drain'd his Garrisons, and assembled all these scat∣ter'd
Forces together at <HI>Sardis,</HI> giving out, that his
Intent was to chastise the <HI>Pisidians,</HI> who infested
his Province.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Pre∣tence for it.</NOTE> But <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> judging right,
that these Preparations were too great for so in∣considerable

there were Four Thousand <HI>Grecians,</HI> who had

<PB N="25" REF="51"/>
Five hundred; and <HI>Phasion</HI> the <HI>Megarean,</HI> Seven
Hundred; in all to the number of Eight Thou∣sand
Two Hundred Men; with which <HI>Cyrus</HI>
march'd through <HI>Lydia</HI> to <HI>Colossus,</HI> a City of
<HI>Phrygia,</HI> where he was join'd by <HI>Menon</HI> the
<HI>Thessalian,</HI> who commanded in the room of
<HI>Aristippus,</HI> with Fifteen Hundred more. His
next March was to <HI>Celaene,</HI> another City of
<HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rygia,</HI> where <HI>Clearchus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> came in to
him with Two Thousand more; <HI>Sosias</HI> the <HI>Syra∣cusian</HI>
with One Thousand; and <HI>Socrates</HI> the <HI>Ar∣cadian</HI>
with Three Hundred; which made the
whole Number of <HI>Grecians</HI> Thirteen Thousand,
whereof Eleven Thousand were heavy-arm'd.</P>
<P>But when they were got as far as <HI>Tarsus,</HI> the
Capital of <HI>Cilicia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gre∣cians re∣fuse to fol∣low him.</NOTE> they began to perceive <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s
Intent of leading them into <HI>Persia</HI> against his
Brother, and refused to follow him; till by the
Artifice of <HI>Clearchus</HI> (who was the only <HI>Grecian</HI>
in the Secret of <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s Design) they being con∣vinced,
it was less hazardous to proceed, than
to retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But are prevailed upon by <HI>Clearchus.</HI></NOTE> began to be pacified; and upon a
Promise of having their Pay augmented to a
Third more, they agreed to march. At <HI>Issus,</HI>

Five <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Gallies, and Twenty Five
of <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s, which had been employ'd in the

which he had on board the Gallies. Four

deserted from him, and came in to <HI>Cyrus.</HI>
This <HI>Abrocomas</HI> commanded upon the <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
and march'd with Three Hundred Thousand
Men to join the King's Army, but did not ar∣rive
till after the Battle.</P>
<P>When they were arrived upon the Coasts of
<HI>Phaenicia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenias</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sion de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Xenias</HI> and <HI>Phasion</HI> deserted from them,
and made their Escape on board a Merchant
Ship; which <HI>Cyrus</HI> did not resent in such a man∣ner
as was expected. He only told the other
Captains, <HI>That no body should reproach him with
keeping them in his Service against their Will,
or with taking from them what they had got in it;
that it was in his Power to pursue and punish them,
but that he was so far from doing either, that he
would send to them their Wives and Children,
which be had as Hostages.</HI> By this generous Pro∣ceeding
he fix'd the Resolution of those, who be∣fore
had no great Inclination to proceed.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Thapsacus</HI> a City upon
the <HI>Euphrates, Cyrus</HI> told them plainly his De∣sign
of marching against the King; at which the
Soldiers murmur'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gre∣ciansagain</HI> refuse to march.</NOTE> and reproach'd their Offi∣cers
with having kept it so long secret, refusing
at the same time to march any further, till <HI>Cy∣rus</HI>
promis'd them a further Reward upon their
Arrival at <HI>Babylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But are a∣gain pre∣vail'd up∣on.</NOTE> together with their full Pay
to their Return into <HI>Ionia. Menon</HI> was also very
instrumental in persuading them; for which <HI>Cyrus</HI>
made him Presents to a considerable value.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="53"/>
<HI>From thence they march'd through</HI> Mesopota∣mia,
<HI>and at last advanc'd into the Province of</HI>
Bablyon; <HI>where</HI> Cyrus, <HI>upon the Return of those
who had been sent to reconnoitre the Enemy,
advis'd with the</HI> Grecian <HI>Captains, and then spoke
to them to this effect.</HI> It is not, my Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyrus's</HI> Speech to the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Cap∣tains.</NOTE> for
want of Troops, that I have made choice of you,
but because I have thought you were better to me
than a great Number of <HI>Barbarians.</HI> Don't let me
be deceived in my Opinion of you; but shew your
selves worthy of that Liberty which you enjoy, and
which I think preferable to all other Possessions.
Consider only who you have to do with, and no∣thing
can happen in the Engagement to dishearten
you. The Enemy indeed is very numerous, and will
rush upon you with great Shouts and Acclamations;
but if you can stand this first Eclat, you your selves
will be ashamed for them afterwards. If you behave
upon this Occasion like your selves, and any one shall
afterwards desire to return home, his Countrymen
shall have cause to look upon him with Admira∣tion
and Envy. But many of you, I believe, will
rather choose to stay with me, and accept the Of∣fers
that shall be made you. <HI>There was a certain</HI>
Samian, <HI>who took the Liberty of telling the
Prince,</HI> That his promises were very large, in pro∣portion
to the Danger of his Enterprise; but that,
after the Battle, he would forget them; or that, if
he did not, he would not have it in his Power to
perform them. <HI>To which</HI> Cyrus <HI>replied,</HI> This
Kingdom of my Father's is so extensive, that one
<PB N="28" REF="54"/>
part of it is not habitable by reason of the Heat,
nor the other by reason of the Cold. All that lies
between these Two Extremes, it will be in my
Power, if I am victorious, to bestow on my Friends.
Neither am I so much afraid of not having enough
to give, as of not having Men enough to give it to.
And as for you, <HI>Grecians,</HI> I promise to give every
Man of you a Crown of Gold. <HI>Upon which As∣surances,
they went away very well satisfied,</HI>
Clearchus <HI>afterwards ask'd him, if he thought
the King would give him Battle.</HI> Yes, undoubt∣edly,
<HI>said he;</HI> If he be the Son of <HI>Darius</HI> and <HI>Pa∣risatis,</HI>
and my Brother, he will not let me take pos∣session
of all this, without striking a Stroke for it.</P>
<P>Upon a general Review of his Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He</HI> re∣views his Army.</NOTE> he
found it composed of Ten Thousand and Four
Hundred heavy-arm'd <HI>Grecians,</HI> Two Thousand
Five Hundred others; and an Hundred Thou∣sand
of other Nations; and the Enemy, by the
Accounts they had from Deserters, amounted to
Twelve Hundred Thousand Men, besides a se∣lect
Body of Six Thousand Horse. He then
form'd his Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And forms it.</NOTE> giving to <HI>Clearchus</HI> the Com∣mand
of the right Wing of <HI>Grecians,</HI> and <HI>Me∣non</HI>
the lest, and march'd in order of Battle,
expecting every Hour to engage. But the Ene∣my
having left a Pass open to him, which he
thought they would have disputed, he pursued
his March with more Security, and less Order,
till at last being arrived at the Place where he
intended to encamp, he discover'd the King's
<PB N="29" REF="55"/>
Army by a thick Cloud of Dust, and prepar'd
to receive them. He order'd <HI>Clearchus</HI> to charge
directly into the Center, where the King was;
for that thereupon depended the whole Success of
the Battle: But the Enemy being so numerous,
that one of their Wings would cover the whole
Front of <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Army, he thought it not ad∣viseable
to abandon the River, for sear of being
surrounded by them; which <HI>Plutarch</HI> blames him
for, as having left that Service to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and
thereby occasion'd his Death. When he had let
the Enemy advance within four or five hundred
Paces of him, the <HI>Grecians</HI> began the Hymn to
Battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle.</NOTE> and march'd up to them with great Ac∣clamations.
But before they were got within
reach of their Javelins, the <HI>Barbarians</HI> fled, and
the <HI>Grecians</HI> after them, calling out to one ano∣ther,
not to break their Ranks in the Pursuit.
<HI>Cyrus</HI> perceiv'd the <HI>Grecians</HI> were victorious, yet
was not transported with it, tho' he was alrea∣dy
saluted King by those about him. At length
he discover'd the King his brother in the midst
of the Battle; and for fear he should fall upon
the <HI>Grecians</HI> in their Pursuit, and cut them off,
he made up directly to him with Six Hundred
Horse, and with his own Hand kill'd <HI>Artagerses,</HI>
who commanded the King's Six Thousand Horse
But when he had broke their Squadrons, all
his own People abandon'd him, except a few of
his Domesticks, with whom he charg'd on to
the King, and crying out, <HI>I see him,</HI> threw a Ja∣velin
<PB N="30" REF="56"/>
at him, and wounded him in the Stomach;
but at the same time receiv'd a Wound himself
under his Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyrus kill'd.</NOTE> and was kill'd upon the Spot,
with eight of his principal Attendants. The
King order's his Head and right Hand to be cut
off; and then push'd on to <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Camp, in pur∣suit
of <HI>Ariaeus,</HI> who commanded his Horse, and
had fled as soon as he had heard of his Master's
Death. The <HI>Grecians</HI> at the same time were in
pursuit of one part of the King's Army, whils<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the other part of it were plundering their Camp;
so that both sides thought themselves victorious.
The King return'd upon them in the same Or∣der
of Battle as at first; but the <HI>Barbarians</HI> fled
again on all sides upon the Approach of the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> who being very much fatigued, and
Night drawing on, returned to their Camp, not
knowing what was become of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but expect∣ing
his Orders the next Day to compleat their
Victory. When the News arrived to them the
next Morning of <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Death, it occasion'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
general Consternation; and they were now to de∣liberate,
not so much to annoy the Enemy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to provide for their own Safety.</P>
<P>This was the Success of the Battle, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fought at <HI>Cunaxa</HI> in <HI>Assyria,</HI> on the Banks o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> about an hundred League
from <HI>Babylon.</HI> And thus sell <HI>Cyrus</HI> in the pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suit
of his Ambition; which yet was attende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with so many good Qualities, that he deserved
better Fate; and it is very probable, from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="31" REF="57"/>
Circumstances of the Action, that if he had
been more cautious in exposing himself, he had
carried his Point. The Character of this Prince
is finely drawn by <HI>Xenophon.</HI> But not to enter
further into the <HI>Persian</HI> Affairs, than is necessary
to my present Purpose, I will only observe of
him in general from that Historian, that no bo∣dy
of his time, whether <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Barbarian,</HI>
was so universally beloved. He describes him
further, as a Prince born for Empire, and the
most worthy Successor of <HI>Cyrus the Great.</HI></P>
<P>Amidst the Confusion the <HI>Grecians</HI> were in af∣ter
the Battle, they sent to <HI>Ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us</HI> as Conqueror,
and Commander in chief upon <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Death, to
offer him the <HI>Persian</HI> Crown. In the mean time
the King, as Conqueror also on his side, sent
to them to surrender their Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Gre∣cians</HI> sum∣mon'd to surrender their Arms</NOTE> and implore
his Mercy; representing to them at the same
time, That as they were in the Heart of his
Dominions, surrounded with vast Rivers, and
numberless Nations, it would be impossible for
them to escape his Vengeance, and therefore they
had nothing to do, but to submit to the present
Necessity. Upon debating among themselves
what Answer they should return, <HI>Proxenus</HI> de∣sired
to know of the Heralds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But they refuse.</NOTE> upon what Terms
the King demanded their Arms. <HI>If as Conque∣ror,
it was in his Power to take them; if upon
any other foot, what would be give them in return?</HI>
He was seconded by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who said, <HI>They
had nothing left but their Arms, and their Liberty;
<PB N="32" REF="58"/>
and that they could not preserve the one without the
other. Clearchus</HI> said to the same effect, <HI>That if
the King was disposed to be their Friend, they should
be in a better Capacity of serving him with Arms,
than without; if their Enemy, they should have
need of them for their Defence.</HI> Some indeed
spoke in Terms more complying, <HI>That as they
had served</HI> Cyrus <HI>faithfully, they would also serve</HI>
Artaxerxes, <HI>if he would employ them, and provided
he would at the same time put them in possession of</HI>
Aegypt. At last it was agreed, that they should
remain in the Place where they were, and that
if they advanced further, or retreated back, it
should be look'd upon as a Declaration of War;
so that by the Issue of the Debate, it appear'd to
have been managed so, as to avoid giving a di∣rect
Answer, but only to amuse the King, and
gain time.</P>
<P>Whilst this Treaty was on foot, they received
<HI>Ariaeus's</HI> Answer, That there were too many
powerful Men in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsia,</HI> to let him possess the
Throne; wheresore he intended to set out early
the next Morning in his Return towards <HI>Greece;</HI>
and that if they had a mind to accompany him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they should join him that Night in his Camp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Which accordingly they all did,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Milthocy∣tus</HI> goes in to the Per∣sian King with 340 Horse. The rest decamp the next Day.</NOTE> except <HI>Milithocy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI>
a <HI>Thracian,</HI> who went with a Party of Thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hundred Men, and Forty Horse to the King
The rest, in conjunction with <HI>Ariaeus's</HI> Forces
decamp'd by break of Day, and continu'd then
March till Sun-set, when they discovered from
<PB N="33" REF="59"/>
the neighbouring Villages the King was in pur∣suit
of them: But this Alarm was over the next
Day, when he sent to treat with them. <HI>Clear∣chus</HI>
return'd Answer, <HI>That his Men were strait∣en'd
for want of Provisions; and that his Affairs
required him rather to fight, than to enter upon a
Treaty.</HI> Wherefore the King, to prevent their
being desperate, sent to conduct them to several
Villages, where they found plenty of every
thing; and after Three Days Stay there, <HI>Tissa∣phernes</HI>
came, and insinuated to them the good
Offices he had employ'd with the King, to give
him leave to conduct them safe into their Coun∣try;
that in return, they ought to acknowledge
this Favour, and not shew themselves averse to
such Terms, as he could obtain for them. <HI>Cle∣archus</HI>
urg'd in their Defence, That they had
been engag'd in this Expedition by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> with∣out
their Knowledge or Intention; that upon
his Death, they were now free'd from that En∣gagement,
and had no Design upon <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI>
or his Country, provided he did not oppose them
in their Return. Which <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> agree'd to
on the King's part, that he should not, and
promis'd further, That they should be furnish'd
with all necessary Provisions in their March, and
that he himself would return with them to his
Government.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in a few Days after, they set out
ander his Conduct: But in their March, the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> encamping at about a League's dis∣tance
<PB N="34" REF="60"/>
from the <HI>Grecians,</HI> created some little Dis∣trusts
and Jealousies on both sides. In about
fifty Days, being got to the Banks of the River
<HI>Zabatus, Clearchus,</HI> to prevent things coming
to an open Rupture, had a Conference with
<HI>Tissaphernes;</HI> wherein, among other things, he
assur'd him of their Fidelity, in regard to the
Truce between them, as likewise of their future
Service, whenever he should have occasion to
employ them, and that they would always look
upon him as the Author of their Safety and De∣liverance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea∣chery of <HI>Tissapher∣nes.</HI></NOTE> To which <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> answer'd, That
he was glad of this occasion of coming to a right
Understanding with him; That indeed it was in
their Power to have destroy'd the <HI>Grecia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
whenever they had pleas'd, but that he himself
had prevented it, out of a Desire to oblige them
by his good Offices, as <HI>Cyrus</HI> had done by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mony. The Result of their Discourse was
That they had been misrepresented to each other
by some of <HI>Clearchus</HI> his Officers, and that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
should bring them all to <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> in order to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
detect those who were guilty. He particularly
suspected <HI>Menon</HI> of a Design to supplant him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
his Command; and accordingly brought hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the next Day, with three other General Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<HI>Proxenus, Agias</HI> and <HI>Socrates,</HI> attended with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Guard of Twenty Captains, and about Two
Hundred Soldiers, upon a Pretence of buying
Provisions in the <HI>Persian</HI> Camp. The Five G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neral
Officers, upon a Signal given, were imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="35" REF="61"/>
diately admited into <HI>Tissaphernes</HI>'s Tent, and put
in Arrest; the others, who were without, were
at the same time cut in pieces, and some <HI>Persian</HI>
Horse scouring the Plain, kill'd all the <HI>Grecians</HI>
they met. Amidst this Scene of Slaughter and
Confusion, the <HI>Persians</HI> sent to them a second
time, in the King's Name, to lay down their
Arms, pretending that <HI>Clearchus</HI> was executed,
as having been accused by <HI>Proxenus</HI> and <HI>Menon</HI>
of perfidiously designing to break the Truce;
and that his Accusers were sent for to be reward∣ed
by the King for their Discovery. But <HI>Xeno∣phon</HI>
suspecting the Treachery, demanded, that
<HI>Proxenus</HI> and <HI>Menon,</HI> as being innocent, and com∣mon
Friends to both, might be restored to
them, as the properest Persons to advise them in
this Exigency. To which the <HI>Persians,</HI> not
knowing what to reply, went away. Immedi∣ately
after, <HI>Nicarchus,</HI> one of the Captains who
had attended the Generals, came, wounded in
the Belly, and holding up his Entrails with his
Hand, to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, and told them all
the Particulars of what had happen'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Five <HI>Grecian</HI> Generals executed.</NOTE> The five
Generals were sent back to the King, who caus'd
them all to be beheaded, except <HI>Menon,</HI> who
suffer'd some other way after a Year's Torture.
It does not appear, why he was distinguished in
this manner from the rest; tho' indeed there was
some Justice in it in regard to his Character,
which was as extraordinary as his Treatment.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="62"/>
He was by Birth a <HI>Thessalian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha∣racter of Menon.</NOTE> covetous and
ambitious; but who made his Ambition all along
subservient to his Avarice, and had no other
View in his Pursuit of Honour, but to get by it.
He sought the Friendship of Men in Power, on∣ly
to screen him from Punishment. He con∣cluded
the readiest way to obtain his Ends, was
by Perjury, Lying and Fraud; and took Can∣dor
and Openness for Stupidity. He loved no
body; and wherever he profess'd a Freindship,
it was in order to ensnare. He did not laugh at
his Enemies, but always made a Jest of his
Friends. So neither did he attempt to defraud
his Enemies of their Property, as knowing they
were too much upon their Guard against him:
But his Friends, who were not so, he fleec'd and
plunder'd. And he valued himself as much up∣on
his Injustice and Falshood, as others did upon
their Religion and Virtue: For he thought none
but Cheats were to be look'd upon as Men of
Address. He made his way to Great Men by
traducing their Favourites. His manner of sup∣porting
his Authority among the Troops, was
by committing the same Crimes with them. He
endeavour'd to make himself fear'd by the Mis∣chief
he could do you; and you were to take it
as an Obligation, that he did not do it, when it
was in his Power. He gain'd the Favour of
<HI>Ariaeus</HI> in his Youth, by abandoning himself to
his unnatural Passion; and he prevail'd the same
way with <HI>Aristippus</HI> for his Command in the
<PB N="37" REF="63"/>
Army. Some have imagin'd that he was par∣don'd
by <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> and conclude from thence,
that he was engag'd in a Design of betraying the
<HI>Grecians</HI> to him; which, according to his Prin∣ciples,
might easily be supposed: But however,
this Account of him does not appear to be well
founded.</P>
<P><HI>Clearchus</HI> was a <HI>Spartan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Clear∣chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> and esteem'd one of
the greatest Captains of his Time. He had done
good Servie to his Country in the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI>
War, and was intirely devoted to the Love of
Arms; insomuch that he laid out all his Mony
in War, and with the same Gust and Appetite,
with which others laid it out upon their Plea∣sures.
Hence it was, that upon the Peace, he
desir'd leave to go and chastise the <HI>Thracians,</HI>
who had committed some Insults upon the <HI>Cher∣sonese.</HI>
Soon after he was gone, the <HI>Ephori</HI>
changed their Minds, and recall'd him; and
tho' they pas'd Sentence of Death upon him
for disobeying their Orders, he proceeded on his
March, beat the <HI>Thracians</HI> in a pitch'd Battle,
ravaged their Country, and continued the War,
till he enter'd into <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Service; where he was
pitch'd upon as the properest Man to command
the <HI>Grecians</HI> in this Expedition: And he had Ta∣lents
suitable to so hardy an Undertaking. He
was severe in his Looks, and harsh in his Speech;
he always punish'd sharply, and sometimes in
Anger, but generally with Discretion. He was
very strict in his Discipline; and it was a Saying
<PB N="38" REF="64"/>
of his, <HI>That a Soldier ought to be more afraid of
his Officer, than of his Enemy.</HI> Upon Action,
his Men desir'd no other General; for he then
appear'd mild to them, and reserv'd all his
Fierceness for the Enemy: But when the Danger
was over, he resumed his Natural Roughness,
and many of them, as they found opportunity,
left him. None of them follow'd him out of
Inclination; but lived with him, as Boys do with
their School-masters. However, he did every
thing with them by dint of Punishment; and
the Sum of his Character is, that he was more fit
to command, than to obey.</P>
<P><HI>Proxenus</HI> was a <HI>Boeotian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Proxe∣nus.</HI></NOTE> and of an aspiring
Temper, which had engaged him in this Ser∣vice;
tho' he did nothing in the Pursuit of his
Ambition, but what was consistent with Honour
and Virtue. He was capable enough of Com∣mand,
but was too much the Reverse of <HI>Clear∣chus.</HI>
He had not the way of making himself
fear'd, where it was necessary: For he was more
afraid of being ill with the Soldiery, than the
Soldiery with him. He thought it sufficient to
commend good Actions, without punishing the
bad: For which reason he was beloved by those
who acted upon Principles of Honour; but bad
Men took advantage of his Easiness.</P>
<P><HI>Agias</HI> was an <HI>Arcadian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Agias</HI> and <HI>So∣crates.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Achaean;</HI>
they had both lived without Reproach, either as
to their Military, or their Civil Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="65"/>
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had, ever since the Battle of <HI>Cy∣rus,</HI>
been so upon their guard, and were withal
so bold and resolute, that the <HI>Persians</HI> despair'd
of subduing them by open Force, and therefore
had recourse to this treacherous Stratagem, which
had so far succeeded, that the Loss of the Gene∣rals
was very near breaking and dispersing the
whole Body. The News of it struck them with
the utmost Consternation: They expected every
Moment when they should be attacked in their
Camp: They consider'd that they were at the
very Gates of the King; surrounded with great
Rivers; in the midst of many Nations their
Enemies; six or seven hundred Leagues from
<HI>Greece;</HI> without Officers to lead them; in want
of all manner of Provisions, and of Means to
get any; besides that they had no Cavalry; and
therefore if they were victorious, could not pur∣sue
their Enemies; and if they should happen to
be defeated, must every Man of them be cut off.
In these perplexing Thoughts they pass'd the
Night without Sleep, despairing ever to see their
Native Country more.</P>
<P>It was upon this Occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenophon</HI> and others succeed in the Com∣mand.</NOTE> that <HI>Xenophon</HI> sig∣nalized
himself. He was an intimate Friend of
<HI>Proxenus,</HI> who had invited him into <HI>Asia,</HI> and
presented him to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who had also express'd a
particular Esteem for him; but hitherto he had
served only as a Voluntier in the Army. The
next Morning he assembled the Officers, and re∣presented
to them the Misery of their Condition;
<PB N="40" REF="66"/>
That they could expect no Mercy from the King,
if they fell into his Hands; to prevent which,
they had nothing to depend upon, but their own
Personal Bravery; and that no time ought to be
lost in providing for their Defence. He there∣fore
advised to choose new Officers in the Place
of those who were murther'd, and to resolve to
make their way home in the best manner they
could. Accordingly, they chose <HI>Timasion</HI> in the
room of <HI>Clearchus, Xanthicles</HI> in that of <HI>Socra∣tes,
Cleanor</HI> in that of <HI>Agias, Philesius</HI> in that of
<HI>Menon,</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI> in that of his Friend <HI>Proxe∣nus.</HI>
He having encourag'd the Army with a
long Harangue in praise of their Ancestors, pro∣pos'd
to them, for the Safety and Expedition of
their Return, to burn their Tents, Carriages,
and all unnecessary Baggage, and to march in
the form of a hollow Square, that, in case they
should be attack'd, they might be prepar'd to
receive the Enemy with a Front either way. All
which being approv'd of, <HI>Cherisophus</HI> the <HI>Spart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>
led the Van, and <HI>Timasion</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI> brought
up the Rear.</P>
<P>They bent their March towards the Heads of
the great Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gre∣chians</HI> pur∣sue their March.</NOTE> in order to pass them where
they were fordable: But they had made very lit∣tle
way before they were follow'd by a Party of
the Enemies Archers and Slingers, commanded
by <HI>Mithridates,</HI> which gall'd their Rear, and
wounded several of them, who being heavy∣arm'd,
and without Cavalry, could make no
<PB N="41" REF="67"/>
Resistance. To prevent the like Inconvenience,
<HI>Xenophon</HI> furnish'd two hundred <HI>Rhodians</HI> with
Slings, and mounted fifty more of his Men up∣on
Baggage-Horses; so that when <HI>Mithridates</HI>
came up with them a second time, and with a
much greater Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Barba∣rians</HI> re∣puls'd by them.</NOTE> he repuls'd them with this
Handful of Men, till he arrived near to the
City <HI>Larissa</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Tigris.</HI>
From thence they march'd to another desolate
City call'd <HI>Mepsila;</HI> and about four Leagues
from that Place, <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> came up to them
with his whole Army in Order of Battle; but,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter several Skirmishes, was forc'd to retire. In
a few Days after, he secured an Eminence, over
which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were obliged to make their
way: Which <HI>Xenophon</HI> perceiving, took a De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>achment
of the Army, and with great Dili∣gence
gain'd the Top of a Mountain which
commanded that Eminence, from whence he ea∣sily
dislodg'd the Enemy, and made good a Pas∣sage
for the rest of hsi Troops into the Plain,
where they found Plenty of Provisions, tho' <HI>Tis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aphernes</HI>
had done what he could before, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn and destroy the Country.</P>
<P>But still they were under as great Difficulties
as ever, being bounded on the one hand by the
<HI>Tigris,</HI> and on the other by inaccessible Moun∣tains,
inhabited by the <HI>Carduchi,</HI> a sierce and
warlike People, and who, <HI>Xenophon</HI> says, had cut
off an Army of Six Score Thousand <HI>Persians</HI> to
<PB N="42" REF="68"/>
a Man, by reason of the Difficulty of the Ways.
However, having no Boats to cross the River, and
the Passage through the Mountains opening into
the rich Plains of <HI>Armenia,</HI> they resolv'd to pur∣sue
their March that way. These <HI>Barbarians</HI>
soon took the Alarm; but not being prepar'd to
meet them in a Body, they possess'd themselves
of the Tops of the Rocks and Mountains, and
from thence annoy'd them with Darts and great
Stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are attack'd by the <HI>Cardu∣chi.</HI></NOTE> which they threw down into the Defiles
thro' which they pass'd; in which they were al∣so
attack'd by several other Parties; and thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Loss was not considerable, yet, what with
Storms and Famine, besides seven tedious Days
March, and being continually forc'd to fight
their way, they underwent more Fatigue and
Hardship, than they had suffer'd from the <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
during the whole Expedition.</P>
<P>They were now got to the Banks of the <HI>Cen∣trites,</HI>
which divides the Mountains from <HI>Arme∣nia:</HI>
And whilst the <HI>Carduchi</HI> were still in View
of them, and pouring down upon their Backs,
they had this deep River before them, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Body of Troops on the other side to dispute
their Passage. Notwithstanding which, they
forded it with all their Baggage, and fought
their way into <HI>Armenia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They fight their way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ar∣menia.</HI></NOTE> where <HI>Tyribazus</HI> the Go∣vernor
offer'd them free Passage and Provisions
upon condition they did not ravage the Coun∣try.
But his Design was to cut them off in the
Mountains; which they being appriz'd of, fell
<PB N="43" REF="69"/>
upon him first, defeated him, and took his
Tent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive at the <HI>Eu∣phrates.</HI></NOTE> Soon after they arrived at the <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
which they pass'd near the Source; and continued
their March through the Desart part of <HI>Arme∣nia;</HI>
where several of them were lost in the
deep Snows, and the rest suffer'd extremely by
Cold and Hunger. After a Stay of seven Days
to refresh themselves in the Villages, they pro∣ceeded
thro' the Countries of the <HI>Phasiani, Ta∣choi,</HI>
and <HI>Chalybes;</HI> which latter were reckon'd
the stoutest People of the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> But the
<HI>Grecians</HI> again forc'd the Passes they held in the
Mountains, and made good their Descent into the
Plain. After which they arriv'd at the River
<HI>Harpasus;</HI> and from thence at a rich populous
City call'd <HI>Gymnias.</HI> They were very well re∣ceiv'd
by the Governour of the Province, who
dismiss'd them with a Guide, that brought them
in five Days within Sight of the Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are within Sight of the Sea.</NOTE> at which
they burst out into Tears and Exclamations of
Joy, and embrac'd their Officers for having
brought them within reach of several <HI>Grecian</HI> Co∣lonies,
by which they might hope to be protected
the rest of their March. And of this they had
an Instance in the next Province belonging to the
<HI>Macrones,</HI> who at first appear'd in Arms against
them; but finding them to be their Countrymen,
brought them Provisions, and gave them free
Passage. From thence they advanc'd to the
Mountains of <HI>Colchis,</HI> where they met with some

upon the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>Here being almost beat out with the Fatigues
of their long March, they resolv'd to make the
rest of their Way by Sea, and deputed <HI>Cherisophus</HI>
to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Admiral for Ships for that Pur∣pose.
Whilst the Army waited his Return, they
subsisted themselves by their Incursions upon the
<HI>Barbarians;</HI> till at last, after thirty Days Stay,
hearing nothing of him, and the Country being
quite exhausted, they put their Women, old and
sick Men, and Part of their Baggage, on board
some Vessels which they had stopt at <HI>Trapezus,</HI>
whilst the rest renew'd their March by Land, and
in three Days reach'd <HI>Cerasus,</HI> another <HI>Greacian</HI>
Colony;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They re∣view their Forces at <HI>Cerasus.</HI></NOTE> where, upon a review of their Forces,
they were found to amount to Eight Thousand
Six Hundred, the rest of the Ten Thousand be∣ing

<P>Upon their Arrival on the Frontiers of the
<HI>Mosynaeci,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppos'd by the <HI>Mosy∣naeci,</HI> and repuls'd.</NOTE> they were vigorously oppos'd, and re∣puls'd
with Loss; but being encourag'd by <HI>Xe∣nophon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But rally, and are victorious.</NOTE> they rally'd, took the Metropolis, and
by that Means became Masters of the whole
Country, from thence they continu'd their March
along the Coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive at Cotyora.</NOTE> till they arriv'd at <HI>Cotyora.</HI> The
Distance from the Field of Battle to this Place is
computed at about Six Hundred and Twenty
Leagues; which from the Day of the Battle took
<PB N="45" REF="71"/>
them up Eight Months Time; of which they
march'd an Hundred and Twenty-two Days.
They had hitherto preserv'd themselves in an in∣tire
Body; but being a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwards broken and di∣minish'd
by their Divisions, and other Accidents,
<HI>Xenophon,</HI> for that Reason, seems to finish their
<HI>Retreat</HI> at this Place. But as he still prosecutes
his Account of them, it may be proper to see,
what further Difficulties they meet with, till they
arriv'd nearer home, and pass'd again into the
Service of their Country.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Place at first refusing
them Admittance, they ravag'd the Country, and
liv'd at Discretion, till, by the Interposition of
the <HI>Sinopeans,</HI> to whom <HI>Cotyora</HI> was tributary,
they were supply'd from the Town. During
their Stay here of Forty-five Days, there was a
general Enquiry made, in the Nature of a Court-Martial,
into all the Abuses and Offences that had
been committed in the Army, whether by Officers
or others, since the Death of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and Punish∣ments
allotted accordingly. Among others, <HI>Xe∣nophon</HI>
was accus'd of having treated several of the
Soldiers ill;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenophon</HI> accus'd,</NOTE> but he made it appear, he had done
nothing but what was necessary to preserve the
Discipline, and was acquitted with a general Ap∣plause.<NOTE PLACE="marg">but ac∣quitted.</NOTE> He had also form'd a Project of settling
them in these Parts, and sounding a <HI>Grecian</HI> Co∣lony;
which was approv'd by some; but his
Enemies representing it to the Army, only as a
more honourable way of abandoning them, and
<PB N="46" REF="72"/>
to the Inhabitants, as a Design to subdue and en∣slave
the Country, he was forc'd to give over that
Enterprize. However, the Noise of it had this
good Effect, that the Natives did what they could,
in a friendly Manner, to procure their Departure,
advising them to go by Sea, as the safest Way,
and furnish'd them with a sufficient Number of
Transports for that Purpose.</P>
<P>Accordingly they embark'd with a fair Wind,
and the next Day got into the Harbour of <HI>Sinope,</HI>
where <HI>Cherisophus</HI> met them with some Gallies;
but, instead of the Money they had also expected
from him, he only told them, they should be
paid their Arrears, assoon as they got out of the
<HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. But this Answer occasion'd a great
deal of murmuring and Discontent among them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army mutiny,</NOTE>
so that they resolved to put themselves under one
single General, desiring <HI>Xenophon</HI> in the most
pressing and affectionate Terms, to accept of that
Command; which he modestly declined, and
procur'd the Choice to fall upon <HI>Cherisophus.</HI> But
he enjoy'd it not above six or seven Days; for
no sooner were they arriv'd at <HI>Heraclea,</HI> than the
Army depos'd him for refusing to extort a Sum
of Money from the Inhabitants of that City;
which being a <HI>Grecian</HI> Colony, <HI>Xenophon</HI> likewise
refus'd to concern himself in that Affair; so that
the Army being disappointed in their Hopes of
Plunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and divide</NOTE> fell into a Mutiny, and divided into
three Bodies; of which the <HI>Achoeans</HI> and <HI>Arca∣dians</HI>
were the principal, consisting of Four
<PB N="47" REF="73"/>
Thousand Five Hundred Foot, and commanded
by ten of their own Officers. <HI>Cherisophus</HI> retain'd
another, of Two Thousand One Hundred; and
<HI>Xenophon</HI> the third, of about the same Number,
forty whereof were Horse; which indeed was all
the Cavalry they had.</P>
<P>The first Body having obtain'd Ships of the
<HI>Heracleotae,</HI> sail'd to <HI>Calpe,</HI> a Port of <HI>Bithynia.
Cherisophus</HI> led his Troops by Land, leaving
what Ships he had to <HI>Xenophon;</HI> who set sail,
and landing on the Confines of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> march'd
into the Country. The <HI>Arcadians</HI> landing in the
Night, had plunder'd the Villages; upon which
the Inhabitants appear'd in Arms, and almost
entirely cut off two Regiments, and surrounded
a Hill where the rest were encamp'd. <HI>Xenophon</HI>
in the mean time receiving Advice of their Con∣dition,
march'd to their Relief, setting on Fire
every thing in his Way that was combustible;
which struck such a Terror into the Enemy, that
they decamp'd by Night:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are re∣united.</NOTE> Upon which the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
were happily reunited, and encamp'd at the
Port of <HI>Calpe;</HI> where they settled the Command
as before, substituting <HI>Neon</HI> in the Room of <HI>Che∣risophus,</HI>
who died here; and making it Death
for any Man henceforward, to propose the di∣viding
of the Army. But being straiten'd for
Provisions, they were forc'd to spread themselves
in the Villages; where <HI>Pharnabazus</HI>'s Horse being
join'd by the Inhabitants, cut in Pieces Five
Hundred of them. The rest escaping to an Hill,
<PB N="48" REF="74"/>
were rescu'd and brought off by <HI>Xenophon;</HI> who
after this led them thro' a large Forest, where
<HI>Pharnabazus</HI> had posted his Troops to oppose
their Passage;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Defeat</HI> Pharnaba∣zus.</NOTE> but they entirely defeated him,
and pursu'd their March to <HI>Chrysopolis</HI> of <HI>Chalce∣don,</HI>
having got a great deal of Booty in their
Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive at <HI>Byzanti∣um.</HI></NOTE> and from thence to <HI>Byzantium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> who fear'd they would be strong
enough to dispossess him of his Government, had
been practising with <HI>Cleander,</HI> the Governor of
<HI>Byzantium,</HI> and <HI>Anaxibius,</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Admiral,
to use all possible Means to hasten their Depar∣ture.
Accordingly <HI>Anaxibius</HI> got them out of
the City Gate, under a pretence of reviewing
them, and told them, They would meet with
Plenty of Provisions in the <HI>Thracian</HI> Villages, and
that they should proceed to the <HI>Chersonese,</HI> where he
would take care they should be paid their Arrears.
But they were so ill satisfied with these Promises,
that they re-enter'd the Gates in a tumultuous
Manner, and put the City into the utmost Con∣fusion.
They address'd themselves to <HI>Xenopho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
telling him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propose to plunder the City,</NOTE> That now was the Time to make
himself great, and them rich, and that they ought
not to slip this Opportunity of furnishing them∣selves
with every thing they wanted. To appease
them, he seem'd at first to comply with their
Demands; then having drawn them up in a large
Square of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">but are re∣strain'd by <HI>Xenophon</HI></NOTE> he represented to them the
ill Consequence of plundering the City, and
thereby incensing the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who held the
<PB N="49" REF="75"/>
Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI> and had <HI>Athens</HI> in their
Alliance: That this would involve their Country
in a dangerous War, and themselves in inevitable
Ruin, since it was equally impracticable for them
to make their Retreat to the <HI>Persian,</HI> or any of
the Countries thro' which they had forc'd their
Passage, or to return home; to which he added,
how much it would sully the Glory of their <HI>Re∣treat,</HI>
That after having spared so many of the
<HI>Barbarian</HI> Cities, they had plunder'd the first they
came to in their own Country, and murder'd so
many of their Friends and Relations. This Ha∣rangue
had so good an effect, that they imme∣diately
chang'd their Resolution, and march'd
out of the City without committing the least Dis∣order;
which was intirely owing to <HI>Xenophon,</HI>
who to the Courage and Conduct he had shewn
in every Circumstance of the <HI>Retreat,</HI> had added
this extraordinary Instance of his Mildness and
Humanity, and the Force of his Eloquence. And
this was testified of him at large in a Letter from
<HI>Chio,</HI> a Philosopher then in the Town, to a Friend
of his, wherein he tells him, <HI>He had been an Eye∣witness
of the Skill and Temper, with which</HI> Xeno∣phon
<HI>had allay'd the Fury of the Soldiers; that he
could not forbear going to thank him as the Author
of his Deliverance, and was struck with the Sight of
a Man, who had nothing terrible or severe in his
Looks, but entertain'd him in the most meek and
agreeable Manner on several Subjects, and who knew
so well how to reduce Philosophy to Practice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="76"/>
The Troops being thus appeas'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenophon</HI> leaves the Army,</NOTE> <HI>Xenophon</HI>
took his Leave of them, and retir'd into the
City, with a Design to embark for <HI>Athens:</HI> But
as they proceeded to the neighbouring Villages,
they were divided in their Opinion as to what
Course they should take.<NOTE PLACE="marg">but is pre∣vail'd upon to return to it.</NOTE> In these Uncertainties,
he was prevail'd upon to return to the Army, and
was receiv'd with all imaginable Demonstrations
of Joy. At the same time there was an Overture
made to him from <HI>Seuthes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He assists</HI> Seuthes in Thrace.</NOTE> King of the <HI>Odrysians</HI>
in <HI>Thrace,</HI> with a Promise of great Rewards both
to the Officers and Soldiers, in case they would
enter into his Service. He accepted the Offer,
and led them into the Service of that Prince;
who, by their Assistance, gain'd great Advan∣tages
over his Enemies; insomuch that the whole
Country submitted to him.</P>
<P>They had no sooner re-establish'd him in his
Dominions, but <HI>Thimbron</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> General
sent them Word, he was order'd by the State to
declare War against <HI>Tissaphernes;</HI> and that they
should receive all fitting Encouragement, if they
would assist him. <HI>Seuthes</HI> not being able to pay
them their Arrears, and having no further Occa∣sion
for them, did what he could to encourage the
Proposal; tho' they were of themselves desirous
enough to serve again in the Cause of their Coun∣try;
besides that they were glad of such an Occa∣sion
of revenging the Treachery of <HI>Tissaphernes</HI>
to them in their Retreat: So that they easily gave
into it, and were so warm upon it, that an <HI>Arca∣dian</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="77"/>
accused <HI>Xenophon</HI> of having detain'd them so
long out of that Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is again accused by the Army,</NOTE> only to enrich himself
at the Expence of their Lives and Labours; and
added, That as to his part, what little he had, he
would freely give to see him stoned to death.
Another stood up, and seconded this Motion;
and a third spoke to the same Purpose. He made
it appear in his Answer to this Charge, that he
had acted in every thing for the Good and Safety
of the Army; that, as to his own particular, he
had not receiv'd the Rewards which were pro∣mised
him, nor even so much as several of the
other Captains; and appeal'd to <HI>Seuthes</HI> himself
for the Truth of it. He modestly hinted to them
his past Services, which they had promised never
to forget, when, in their Dangers and Fatigues,
they gave him no other Name, than that of <HI>Fa∣ther,
Saviour</HI> and <HI>Deliverer;</HI> and in the end re∣proach'd
them with the rankest Malice and In∣gratitude.
They were so well satisfied with his
Defence, that several spoke in his Favour, and
nothing more of a Complaint was urg'd against
him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">but is ac∣quitted.</NOTE> So that they prepar'd for their new Expe∣dition,
and he embark'd with them, and sail'd
to <HI>Lampsacus</HI> in <HI>Mysia.</HI> From thence they
march'd to <HI>Troas,</HI> and crossing Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> ar∣riv'd
at <HI>Antandros;</HI> whence coasting along, they
gain'd the Plain of <HI>Thebe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Success at <HI>Perga∣mus.</HI></NOTE> and arriv'd at <HI>Perga∣mus</HI>
in <HI>Lydia;</HI> where <HI>Xenophon,</HI> with a Detach∣ment

<PB N="52" REF="78"/>
Mony.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thimbron</HI> takes the Army un∣der his Command.</NOTE> The next Day <HI>Thimbron</HI> arriving there,
took them under his Command, and join'd them
to his own Troops, in order to carry on the War
in <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in the first Year of the Ninety-fifth <HI>O∣lympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A. M.</HI> 3625. Olym. 95. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> ended this memorable Expedition of this
Body of <HI>Grecians;</HI> who, notwithstanding the
many Adventures and Impediments they met
with, and which took up so much of their Time,
perform'd the whole Journey of between Four
and Five Thousand <HI>English</HI> Miles forwards and
backwards, in the Space of about Nineteen
Months, from their first setting out, till their Ar∣rival
at <HI>Pergamus.</HI> It is true indeed, that, upon
a Review of the Forces at <HI>Cerasus,</HI> there ap∣pear'd
to be but Eight Thousand Six Hundred
Men; and after their Service under <HI>Seuthes,</HI> there
is Mention made but of Six Thousand; which
last Diminution of them was owing to their Di∣visions,
and going in separate Bodies in Search of
Plunder, as they came nearer home. But yet,
that any such Number of them should escape, as
did actually reach the Confines of <HI>Greece,</HI> seems
almost incredible. That, after the Death of
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> which struck such a Damp into the rest
of his Forces, they alone should have Courage
enough to continue the War, to oblige the <HI>Per∣sian</HI>
to sue to them for Peace, and furnish them
with Provisions; That, after the treacherous
Murder of their Officers, they should be still
hardy enough to make their Way in Defiance
<PB N="53" REF="79"/>
of a numberless Army, that could neither take
them by Force, nor circumvent them by Strata∣gem;
That they should traverse the Body of that
vast Empire, with so many barbarous Nations on
all Sides, to dispute their Passage over Rocks and
Mountains almost inaccessible, and such Rivers as
the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates;</HI> and all this with the
Countenance rather of Conquerors, than of de∣spairing
successless Adventurers, exposed to the
Fury of a powerful incensed Monarch with a
victorious Army: these are Circumstances, which
would not easily gain Credit, if they had not been
describ'd and attested by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who has done
it with such Exactness and Fidelity, and at the
same time with such Modesty in regard to him∣self,
that the only Doubt remaining, is, whether
he gain'd more Honour by the Share he had in
the Expedition, or by the Account he has given
of it.</P>
<P>But it is time now to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> which
we left chiefly under the Direction of the <HI>Spar∣tans,</HI>
who contenting themselves with the Sub∣mission
of the several States to them at home,
were meditating other great Designs, and resolv'd
to push their Conquests abroad. The first Occa∣sion
that offer'd, was from the <HI>Ionians:</HI> They
were afraid of the Power of <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> who, as
a Reward for the Service he had done <HI>Artaxerxes</HI>
in the late War with his Brother <HI>Cyrus,</HI> had the
Government of all the Cities he had possessed in
those Parts, conferr'd on him; and therefore
<PB N="54" REF="80"/>
they begg'd Assistance from <HI>Sparta</HI> to support
them in their Liberties. Their Request was easily
granted; and a Body of Five Thousand Men,
with Three Hundred <HI>Athenian</HI> Horse, were sent
to them, under the Command of <HI>Thimbron,</HI> who
appear'd among them, but would not venture to
take the Field, till he was join'd by the Re∣mainder
of the <HI>Ten Thousand</HI> at <HI>Pergamus;</HI> with
which Forces he took that, and several other ill-fortified
Towns, and then laid Siege to <HI>Larissa.</HI>
But before he could take it, he was recall'd by
the <HI>Ephori,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thimbron</HI> recall'd, and ba∣nish'd.</NOTE> and banish'd, for having suffer'd the
Soldiers to pillage the Countries of their Allies;
and was succeeded in the Command by <HI>Dercyl∣lidas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Athens,</HI>
during the Time of <HI>the Expedition of
the Ten Thousand,</HI> and the breaking out of this
fresh War in <HI>Asia,</HI> was very quiet with its Neigh∣bours,
and endeavouring to recover itself from its
late Confusions in the Government at home. But
there were still some Seeds of Rancour and Ma∣lice
left among the Citizens, which, two Years
after the Expulsion of <HI>the Thirty,</HI> broke out upon
<HI>Socrates,</HI> and occasion'd his Death. The chief
Instrument in it was <HI>Anytus,</HI> who engag'd <HI>Melitus</HI>
and <HI>Lycon</HI> to join with him in accusing him to the
State. Accordingly <HI>Melitus</HI> drew up his Accusa∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates <HI>accus'd</HI></NOTE> containining in Substance, <HI>That he did not ac∣knowledge
the Gods of the Republick, but introduced
new Deities in their room;</HI> and further, <HI>That he
corrupted the Youth.</HI> He urg'd in his Defence,
<PB N="55" REF="81"/>
That he had assisted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His De∣fence.</NOTE> as others did, at the Sacri∣fices
and solemn Festivals, and appeal'd to <HI>Me∣litus</HI>
himself for the Truth of it. He denied his
endeavouring to establish any new Worship: He
own'd indeed, he had receiv'd frequent Admo∣nitions
from a <HI>Divine Voice,</HI> which he call'd his
<HI>Daemon,</HI> that constantly attended him, and dis∣cover'd
to him Things to come; that he had of∣ten
made use of this Divine Assistance for the Ser∣vice
of himself and his Friends: But that if he
had been thus particularly favour'd from Heaven,
it was owing chiefly to the Regularity of his Life
and Conduct; and that the Approbation of the
Gods, which was given him as the Reward of his
Virtue, ought not to be objected to him as his
Crime. Then as to the other Article, wherein
he was branded with a criminal Passion for young
Men, he said, He had no other View in his Con∣versation
with them, than to regulate their Mo∣rals;
that as he could not do this with any pub∣lick
Authority, he was therefore forc'd to insi∣nuate
himself into their Company, and to use in
a manner the same Methods to reclaim, that o∣thers
did to corrupt them.</P>
<P>How far the whole Charge affected him, is not
easy to determine. It is certain, that amidst so
much Zeal and Superstition as then reign'd in
<HI>Athens,</HI> he never durst openly oppose the receiv'd
Religion, and was therefore forc'd to preserve an
outward Shew of it: But it is very probable,
from the Discourses he frequently held with his
<PB N="56" REF="82"/>
Friends, that in his Heart he despis'd and laugh'd
at their monstrous Opinions, and ridiculous Mys∣teries,
as having no other Foundation, than the
Fables of the Poets; and that he had attain'd to
a Notion of the <HI>One, Only, True God;</HI> inso∣much
that, upon the account both of his Belief of
the Deity, and the Exemplariness of his Life,
some have thought fit to rank him with the
<HI>Christian Philosophers.</HI> And indeed his Behaviour
upon his Trial, was more like that of a <HI>Christian
Martyr,</HI> than of an <HI>Impious Pagan;</HI> where he
appear'd with such a compos'd Confidence, as
naturally results from Innocence, and rather, as
<HI>Cicero</HI> observes, as if he were to determine upon
his Judges, than to supplicate them as a Cri∣minal.</P>
<P>But
how slight soever the Proofs were against
him, the Faction was powerful enough to find
him guilty. There was the Form of a Process
against him, and his Irreligion was the Pretence
upon which it was grounded; but his Death was
certainly a concerted thing. His steady uninter∣rupted
Course of obstinate Virtue, which had
made him in many Cases appear singular, and
oppose whatever he thought illegal or unjust,
without any Regard to Times, or Persons, had
procur'd him a great deal of Envy and Ill-will:
Insomuch that he had, several Years before, been
publickly attack'd upon the Stage in the <HI>Play,</HI>
call'd <HI>The Clouds,</HI> where he is introduc'd as the
Author of many gross Impieties; which some
<PB N="57" REF="83"/>
say, <HI>Aristophanes</HI> wrote out of a personal Pique to
him; others, that he did it only according to the
Liberty then indulg'd to the Stage, and intended,
in the Person of <HI>Socrates,</HI> to expose and ridicule
the Philosophers in general. But most are of
Opinion, that it was at the Instigation of <HI>Anytus,</HI>
who look'd upon him as a dangerous Man, and
took that Method of preparing the People for his
Condemnation, whenever an Opportunity should
offer. This agrees with the Terms proposed to
him, even after the Accusation was given in, when
perhaps he was not sure of carrying his Point a∣gainst
him: He hinted to him, that if he would
talk less freely, and not take upon him to censure
and arraign the Administration, he would yet en∣deavour
to stifle the Affair, and save him. It
was upon the same Account, that he was forbid
conversing with the young Men: Those at the
Helm were jealous of his tampering with them in
relation to the Government; and this seems to be
the Grounds of that Part of his Accusation. But
he was not to be bought by Bribes, or deter'd by
Menaces; in short, he had more Plainness and
Integrity than the Times would bear; and there∣fore
fell a Sacrifice to the Corruption of those,
whom his Honesty had made his Enemies.</P>
<P>It was a Privilege in <HI>Athens,</HI> after Conviction,
to demand a Mitigation of the Punishment: But
that, he said, would be owning himself guilty;
and he chose rather to defy and incense his
Judges; so that they unanimously pass'd Sentence
<PB N="58" REF="84"/>
of Death upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con∣demn'd,</NOTE> by drinking the Juice of
Hemlock, which was not put in execution till
thirty Days after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and exe∣cuted.</NOTE> during which Time, he con∣versed
with his Friends with the same Evenness
and Serenity of Mind he had ever done: And
tho' they had bribed the Jailor for his Escape,
he refus'd it, as an ungenerous Violation of the
Laws. He was about seventy Years old when he
suffer'd; which made him say, he thought him∣self
happy to quit Life at a Time when it begin
to be troublesome; and that his Death was ra∣ther
a Deliverance, than a Punishment. This
agrees with his last Words to his Friend <HI>Crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
just before he expir'd; <HI>We owe a Cock,</HI> said he,
to Aesculapius, <HI>don't fail to pay it him;</HI> thereby

of the Republick to his unjust Condem∣nation;
and to avert the Vengeance of Heaven
thought themselves oblig'd to make suitable Ex∣pressions

and by condemning his Accusers

rose even to Veneration; insomuch tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>He was born in the fourth Year of the seventy

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could ground no certain Principles upon such
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Diversity of Opinions, he turn'd his Thoughts
wholly to the Nature of Man; and by diving

a Disposition to Vice; but he so far got the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter of himself, as to make Virtue habitual to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, and was therefore the better prepar'd to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>plant it in others: So that he was the first,
who settled the standing Rules of Good and Ill,

Philosophy.</HI> His Life and Doctrine were one con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nu'd

that, to please, was the surest Method to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersuade; and by this Means he took off that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gged and unsociable Dress that Philosophy then
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore. If he sometimes went out of his Cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acter,
it was in Opposition to the Sophists; he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not bear their deluding all the Youth of

their false Reasonings, and of mortifying

their Arrogance. As to his own way of reason∣ing,
it was very just, and yet uncommon. He
began with doubting, enquiring, and asking of
Questions, as if he sought rather to receive In∣struction,
than to give it; and from the An∣swers
which must be naturally made, his Infe∣rences
were undeniable. He had a way of lead∣ing
People insensibly from one Absurdity to an∣other,
till they came to the Point he aim'd at▪
and, by the most familiar Comparisons, mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Ephesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3609. Olymp. 96. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Tissaphernes</HI> amus'd

where he took several Towns, and met <HI>Pharna∣bazus</HI>'s
Forces; but, for want of Cavalry, did
not venture a Battle.</P>
<P>But having soon after procured a great num∣ber
of Horse, which he had demanded of the

<HI>TissapherneS</HI>'s Army, and gain'd a signal
Victory near the River <HI>Pactolus,</HI> where he
forced the Enemy's Camp, and found in it a

the King suspected his Fidelity, and looking up∣on

<P><PB N="66" REF="92"/>
The next Year he sent <HI>Tithraustes</HI> in his room;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 96. 2.</NOTE>
who endeavour'd to gain upon <HI>Agesilaus</HI> by
Treaty. He sent to let him know, that his
Predecessor had deservedly been punished with
Death, as being the Author of this War; that,
as to his own part, he would pursue other Mea∣sures,
and would allow the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Cities their
Liberty, provided they would pay the customary
Tribute, and that the Army withdrew. To
which the other answer'd, he could do nothing
in it, till he received Orders from <HI>Sparta.</HI> How∣ever,
<HI>Tithraustes</HI> prevail'd with him in the mean
time, to draw his Forces towards <HI>Phrygia,</HI> and
gave him Thirty Talents for their Subsistence.
Upon his March, he received Dispatches from
<HI>Sparta,</HI> to let him know, the State approved of
his Proceedings, and gave him a Power of ap∣pointing
an Admiral, to act in concert with him
by Sea. Accordingly he procured from the
Isles, and Maritime Towns, an Hundred and
Twenty Gallies, and gave the Command of
them to <HI>Pisander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He ap∣points Pi∣sander Ad∣miral.</NOTE> his Wife's Brother, a Man of

<P>However these great Preparations from <HI>Spar∣ta,</HI>

finding they could not prevail upon <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> ei∣ther
by Menaces, or Persuasions, to quit <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
resolved upon a more effectual Expedient, by
<PB N="67" REF="93"/>
making a Diversion, and removing the Seat of
the War. They knew how ill affected most of
the <HI>Grecian</HI> States were to that of <HI>Sparta,</HI> on ac∣count
of her late absolute and tyrannical Treat∣ment
of them, and thought this the most pro∣per
time to stir them up against her, and to
rouse in them a Sense of recovering their Li∣berty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Per∣sians</HI> in∣cense the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and other States, a∣gainst <HI>Sparta.</HI></NOTE> To which purpose <HI>Tithraustes</HI> sent over
<HI>Timocrates</HI> to practise with the Orators, and
other leading Men of the principal Cities; and,
to make his Commission more effectual, gave
him Fifty Talents to dispose of among them, as
he saw proper. It was upon this Occasion, that
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> afterwards, upon his Return Home,
said, <HI>He had been drove out of</HI> Asia <HI>by Thirty
Thousand Archers;</HI> by which he meant so many
Pieces of the <HI>Persian</HI> Coin, which was stamp'd
with the Figure of an Archer. <HI>Conon</HI> is by
some thought to have been the Author of this
Advice. He had, during his Retreat in <HI>Asia,</HI>
after the Defeat of the <HI>Athenians</HI> at <HI>Aegos-pota∣mos,</HI>
made it his Business to ingratiate himself
with the <HI>Persians,</HI> in hopes, by them, to gain
an Opportunity of retrieving the Misfortunes of
his Country. With that View, he took all Oc∣casions
to incense them against the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and
to traverse their Designs; insomuch that <HI>Nepos</HI>
ascribes it to him, that <HI>Agesilaus</HI> did not pene∣trate
further into <HI>Asia,</HI> and carry his Conquests
as far as Mount <HI>Taurus.</HI> And <HI>Justin</HI> makes
him signalize himself by many great Exploits
<PB N="68" REF="94"/>
against that King personally. But the Accounts
of both these Historians, in that Respect, are too
confused and inconsistent, to be reconciled with
others, or even with themselves: Neither can
we, with any Certainty, affirm that he appear'd
in Action, till after <HI>Agesilaus</HI> had quitted <HI>Asia.</HI>
We may however conclude, that he was before
that, making use of his Credit at the <HI>Persian</HI>
Court, to procure an Armament at Sea, and
that he was at least very instrumental, if not
principally concerned, in forming a Confederacy
of the other States of <HI>Greece</HI> against <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>The first whom <HI>Timocrates</HI> treated with upon
this Subject, were the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who easily heark∣en'd
to the Proposal, and received the Presents.
He met with the like Success at <HI>Argos,</HI> and <HI>Co∣rinth;</HI>
and these States work'd up several others
to accuse and murmur against the <HI>Spartans,</HI> in
order to their uniting against them. It is ob∣servable,
this is the first notorious Instance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the <HI>Grecians</HI> being corrupted with the <HI>Persian</HI>
Gold. So much did they now begin to sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from that zealous Spirit of Honour and Integri∣ty,
Concord and Unanimity, by which they
were animated in the first <HI>Persian</HI> Wars. I
does not indeed appear, that the <HI>Persians</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
before made them any such gross Overtures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
betray and sell their Country: But it might pro∣bably
be, because they thought it in vain. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
knew they were not Enemies to be tamper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with in such a manner; they sound them ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="69" REF="95"/>
where in earnest, when they moved against
them as one Soul and Body, when they laid aside
all domestick Dissensions, to pursue the com∣mon
Enemy; and, in short, acted upon no
other Principle than the Love of Liberty, and
the Defence of their Country. This was the
plain, hardy and untainted Age of <HI>Greece,</HI>
which might have been of a much longer Du∣ration,
if its Inhabitants had contented them∣selves
with the Glory they had acquired at home.
But these Successes soon fired them with an Am∣bition
of making themselves more formidable,
by enlarging their Bounds, and extending their
Conquests: So that by throwing themselves out
in Colonies, and carrying their Arms abroad,
they had a freer Converse with other Nations:
And as by this means they arrived to quicker
degrees of Knowledge and Politeness; so on the
other hand, they became more luxurious and ef∣feminate,
and more open to the Charms and
Temptations of Riches. They received the first
Impressions of this kind from the Footing they
got in <HI>Asia,</HI> where they were struck and dazzled
with the Pomp, Wealth and Magnificence of
the <HI>Persian</HI> Governors: And tho' in all the Ac∣tions
they had there, they still behaved like <HI>Gre∣cians,</HI>
and with a Sense of Glory; yet they ex∣press'd
too great an Eagerness to enrich them∣selves
with Plunder. In short, the Love of
Mony was now rooted in their Affections; and
it soon after visibly appeared in the Effects it
<PB N="70" REF="96"/>
produced. For as the <HI>Grecians</HI> had been bribed
to quit their Pretensions in <HI>Asia;</HI> so others af∣terwards
made use of the same Methods to in∣vade
<HI>Greece:</HI> And this will appear in the Sequel
of the Story, to be one of the principal Causes
of its total Subversion. As the <HI>Spartans</HI> kept
up longest to the Rigour of their Discipline,
and the Force of their Laws, they were a great
while proof against Corruption and Bribery;
but the Contagion still spreading, they at last
yielded to the Example of their Neighbours.
It was then <HI>Greece</HI> became so divided and irre∣solute,
as to admit of no means for its Preserva∣tion;
when not only each State, but also the
leading Men in that State, had separate Views
of their own, without any regard to the Good of

<P>The <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> en∣gage the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the Quarrel.</NOTE> as they were the first gain'd over
to the <HI>Persian</HI> Interest, so they were the most
active in promoting it. To strengthen their
Alliance, they sent Ambassadors to the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
with a long Representation of the pre∣sent
Posture of Affairs; wherein they artfully
insinuated their Zeal and Affection to their
State; from thence they took occasion to in∣veigh
against the Tyranny of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and con∣cluded
with telling them, That now was the
Time to throw off the Yoke, and to recover
their former Splendor and Authority. The <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
tho' they had no Share of the <HI>Persian</HI>
Mony, needed not many Arguments to engage
<PB N="71" REF="97"/>
them in a Rupture of this kind, for which they
had been so long waiting a fit Opportunity.</P>
<P>The first Act of Hostility broke out between
the <HI>Locri Opuntii,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostilities begun.</NOTE> and the <HI>Phocians,</HI> upon a
Dispute about a piece of Ground; and both
Sides appeal'd to their respective Confederates
for Justice and Protection. The <HI>Locri</HI> were the
Aggressors, at the Instigation of the <HI>Thebans;</HI>
and the <HI>Spartans</HI> espoused the latter, upon a
particular Pique they had to <HI>Thebes,</HI> which they
thought it necessary to resent at this time, when
they found several other States arming against
them. Accordingly, they ordered <HI>Pausanias</HI> to
march with the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> Forces, and sent
<HI>Lysander</HI> before to engage other Cities in <HI>Boeo∣tia;</HI>
where having got together a considerable
Army, he invested <HI>Haliartus.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI> im∣mediately
marched with their whole Strength;
and taking the Advantage of attacking him,
before <HI>Pausanias</HI> could come up to his Assis∣tance,
defeated his Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lysander</HI> kill'd.</NOTE> and he himself was
kill'd on the Spot.</P>
<P>Thus fell this great Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> after so many sig∣nal
Services to his Country, in giving <HI>Athens</HI> the
most fatal Blow she had ever received; and in
raising <HI>Sparta</HI> upon her Ruins, to a higher Pitch
of Power and Grandeur than she ever attain'd,
either before or after him. As it was by his
means, that <HI>Sparta</HI> did at this time, in a man∣ner,
give Law both to <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia;</HI> so he
himself became no less absolute in <HI>Sparta,</HI> than
<PB N="72" REF="98"/>
she was among her Enemies and Allies. The
Authority of her Kings was sufficiently abridged
by the Constitution: but by his working Ge∣nius,
and the Interest he had in the State upon
the Reputation of his Services, he made them
appear still less, and that in the Field too, where
they were least subject to be controuled. An In∣stance
of which we have in his going with <HI>Age∣silaus</HI>
into <HI>Asia,</HI> where all the Court and Applica∣tion
was made to him; and in every thing that
pass'd of moment, he had either the first hand,
or the finishing Stroke: Insomuch that the King
found himself obliged to take notice of it; and
that he might no longer appear a Cypher, sent
him upon other Service to the <HI>Hellespont.</HI> Nei∣ther
was it enough for him to eclipse the Power
of the Kings, and to impose his own Govern∣ment
of <HI>Ten Men</HI> upon all the <HI>Spartan</HI> Con∣quests;
but he was further endeavouring to al∣ter
the Succession of the <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> in order to
obtain the Sovereignty for himself. As a Con∣firmation
of this, there was found among his
Papers after his Death, <HI>A Discourse concerning the
Government,</HI> which <HI>Lacratidas</HI> generously sup∣press'd,
saying, <HI>It would be inhumane to dig</HI> Ly∣sander
<HI>out of his Grave.</HI> He was undoubtedly a
brave experienc'd Commander: But his Dissi∣mulation,
Craft and Treachery, his Ambition,
Arrogance and Ostentation, make up the great∣est
part of his Character; and therefore it may
seem pretty extraordinary, that he should support
<PB N="73" REF="99"/>
himself so long under so jealous and austere a
Government, as that of <HI>Sparta.</HI> But he had a
great deal of Artifice and Address; and notwith∣standing
the Imperiousness of his Temper, he
knew how to curb it upon occasion, and to suit
it to his Circumstances: So that where he found
it necessary to make his Court, he was, con∣trary
to the Manners of his Country, very mild
and tractable, patient and submissive, and had
all the little Arts of Flattery and Insinuation.
It was with regard to these supple Qualities, as
well as to the Badness of his Morals in general,
that the Character of his Countryman <HI>Callicrati∣das,</HI>
has been set up in opposition to his; and
indeed it was quite the Reverse of it, except in
the Military Part; and in that he was no way in∣ferior
to him: But he was otherwise open, can∣did
and generous, modest, temperate, sincere
and just, and was above making use of any Trick
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Subterfuge. <HI>Lysander</HI> was so jealous of his
Merit, that when he was order'd to give up the
Command of the Fleet to him, he did what he
could to lessen and distress him: He went so far
as to withold from him the Pay of the Seamen
that was remaining in his Hands; which, besides
the Meanness of the Action, was betraying the
Interest of his Country, and hazarding the Safety
of it in a very critical Conjuncture. Upon the
whole, notwithstanding his great Atchievements,
he is not to be look'd upon as a true Patriot.
For it seems chiefly owing to him, that the
<PB N="74" REF="100"/>
<HI>Spartans</HI> transgress'd the just Bounds of Power he
had put into their Hands. It was his Pride and
Insolence, his cruel and tyrannical Deportment,
and that under the Pretence of restoring Liberty,
which gave their Neighbours the first Impressions
of Rancour and Resentment against them. It
was this that made them conceive an ill Opinion
of their Government in general, and laid the
Seeds of those Alliances, which were form'd a∣gainst
them, and which at last prov'd fatal to
them. But they were not yet so sensible of the
Consequences; and therefore paid all due Respect
to his Memory. They went so far as to fine
some who were under a Contract of Marriage to
his Daughters, but finding, that their Father died
so poor as to leave them no Fortune, had de∣serted
them. It is certain, he had reserv'd no∣thing
to himself out of the Spoils of the <HI>Atti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
War; which to the <HI>Spartans</HI> was a sufficient Ar∣gument
of his Merit. A stronger Instance of the
Sense they had of his Loss, was, that they could
pitch upon nobody but <HI>Agesilaus</HI> to succeed him;
who, notwithstanding that he was carrying on the
War in <HI>Asia</HI> with good Success, was immediately
recall'd to the Defence of his Country.</P>
<P>After the Action <HI>Pausanias</HI> came up, but durst
not make another Attempt. He only demanded
the Bodies of the slain; and yet could not obtain
them upon any other Terms than quitting the
Country.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pausanias</HI> condemn'd</NOTE> The <HI>Spartans</HI> judg'd his Proceedings
very dishonourable, and condemn'd him to Death<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="75" REF="101"/>
upon which he made his Escape to <HI>Tegea,</HI> and
died there.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the Year <HI>Agesilaus</HI> ra∣vag'd
the Government of <HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> and at
<HI>Dascyllum,</HI> his Winter Quarters, took and plun∣der'd
his Tent. But that Governor some time
after manag'd an Interview with him, wherein
he remonstrated, That however he might be
oblig'd to act for his Master's Honour, and
Safety, he had not shew'd himself an Enemy to
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> but on the contrary had done them
many good Offices in their War against the <HI>A∣thenians;</HI>
and that he was now inclin'd to act no
otherwise against them, than as he should be ne∣cessitated
to it, in order to support himself in his
Command; by which Means he prevail'd with
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> to withdraw his Forces out of the Pro∣vince.
Thereupon he descended into the Plain
of <HI>Thebes;</HI> and as he was preparing to march
further into the Country, receiv'd News of the
War broke out in <HI>Greece,</HI> with Orders at the
same time for him to return home; with which
he readily comply'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agesilaus <HI>recall'd from</HI> Asia. Olymp. 96. 3.</NOTE> And the Regard he therein
paid to the Laws of his Country, is particularly
taken notice of, that when he was prosecuting
the War with great Increase of Honour and Ad∣vantage,
and had set his Heart upon the entire
Conquest of the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire, he had so much
Command of himself, as to stop in his full Ca∣reer,
and abandon all, out of a Deference to the
<HI>Ephori,</HI> who had recall'd him. However, he
<PB N="76" REF="102"/>
left Four Thousand Men in <HI>Asia,</HI> to maintain the
Footing he had got there, till such time as the
Affairs of <HI>Greece</HI> would permit him to return,
and pursue his Conquests.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spartans</HI> could not wait his Arrival;
they found the War thicken on their Hands, and
were ready to be attack'd on all Sides. <HI>Timolous</HI>
a <HI>Corinthian</HI> propos'd the advancing immediately
into their Territories, in order to crush them
singly, before they could be join'd by their Auxi∣liaries.
<HI>They set out,</HI> said he, <HI>by themselves only;
but in their March they gather Forces as they go,
till they grow too numerous to be withstood: Like
Rivers, which are small at their Source, and easily
to be forded; but as they continue their Course, the
Accession of other Waters makes the Stream too
rapid.</HI> This Advice was judg'd reasonable, and
a Resolution was taken to pursue it. But there
being too much Time spent in debating the
Command, and Order of the Battle, gave the
<HI>Spartans</HI> an Opportunity of being join'd by the
<HI>Eleans, Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Trezaenians</HI> and
others, to the Number of about Fourteen Thou∣sand
Men, and Thirteen Hundred Horse, under
the Command of <HI>Aristodemus,</HI> who was also ap∣pointed
Tutor to <HI>Agesipolis,</HI> the other <HI>Sparta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
King, during his Minority. On the other Side
were the <HI>Athenians, Argives, Boeotians, Corin∣thians</HI>
and <HI>Euboeans,</HI> who made up about Two
and twenty Thousand Men, and Two Thousand
Horse. Both Sides encamp'd near <HI>Sicyon,</HI> and
<PB N="77" REF="103"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so small a Distance from each other, that it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon came to a regular Battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> gain a Victory near <HI>Sicy∣on.</HI></NOTE> wherein the <HI>Spar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan</HI>
Allies were almost entirely routed; but they
themselves maintain'd their Ground, and bore
so hard upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were in the
left Wing, opposite to their right, that they
recover'd the Day, and gain'd the Victory by
their own single Valour, and with the Loss
of not above eight of their own Men, which
bore no Proportion to that of their Enemies, or
Allies.</P>
<P>The News of this Victory reaching <HI>Agesilaus</HI> at
<HI>Amphipolis,</HI> he sent back <HI>Dercyllidas</HI> with it into
<HI>Asia,</HI> to confirm the associated Cities there, and
pursu'd his March with all possible Diligence, but
not without some Opposition, particularly from
the <HI>Thralli</HI> in <HI>Thrace,</HI> who having formerly sold
the Passage thro' their Country to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> de∣manded
of him an hundred Talents, and as many
Women. He ask'd them, by way of Derision,
<HI>Why they did not come to receive their Demands?</HI>
And proceeding on his Journey, made great
Slaughter of them. Then demanding a Passage
thro' <HI>Macedonia,</HI> the King sent him Word, <HI>He
would consider of it. So let him,</HI> said <HI>Agesilaus;
and I'll go on in the mean time.</HI> The <HI>Macedonians</HI>
did not much relish this <HI>Laconick</HI> Answer; but
they were not as yet in a Condition to resent it,
and therefore gave him no Disturbance. Having
afterwards defeated a Body of <HI>Thessalian</HI> Horse,
which attack'd his Rear, he arriv'd in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> where
<PB N="78" REF="104"/>
he receiv'd Intelligence of a great Engagement at
Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Conon</HI> had prevail'd with <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> to fit out
a Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conon</HI>'s Victory at <HI>Cnidus.</HI></NOTE> and to give the Command of it to him
jointly with <HI>Pharnabazus.</HI> They lay in the <HI>Cher∣sonese</HI>
with about ninety Sail; where they had
Notice, that the <HI>Spartan</HI> Fleet, consisting of an
hundred and twenty Ships of their own and their
Allies, lay about <HI>Cnidus;</HI> from whence <HI>Pisander,</HI>
who commanded it, weigh'd Anchor, and bore
down directly upon the <HI>Persians.</HI> In the first
Attack he had the better of it; but one Part of
the <HI>Persian</HI> Gallies came up so seasonably to the
Relief of the other, that they turn'd the Fortune
of the Day; insomuch that the <HI>Spartan</HI> Confede∣rates
began to secure their Retreat. The Ad∣miral,
tho' he was so ill supported, charg'd with
his Ship in the Front of the Enemy, where he did
a good deal of Execution, but at length was
over-power'd, and kill'd. After which the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI>
retiring towards the Continent, <HI>Conon</HI> pur∣su'd
them, and took fifty of their Ships, the res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Courage of <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who, notwithsand∣ing
that he was dangerously wounded, push'd the
Enemy, till he gain'd a compleat and signal
Victory, but not decisive enough to put an End
to the Hostilities, which were still continu'd by
Incursions into each other's Territories.</P>
<P>The <HI>Corinthians</HI> complain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 96. 4.</NOTE> that the chief Seat
of the War being among them, they were in∣fested
on all Sides, being equally distress'd by
their Enemies, and burden'd by their Allies; for
which Reason they were inclinable to a Peace.
This was oppos'd by the Magistrates and other
Citizens, who had been corrupted with the <HI>Persian</HI>
Mony. And these Debates occasion'd a great
Dissension and Massacre in their City;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Massacre at Corinth.</NOTE> which the
<HI>Spartans</HI> easily improv'd to their Advantage,
making use of one of the discontented Parties to
attack the other: By which Means a Body of
their Troops, under the Command of <HI>Praxitas,</HI>
got within the Walls. He defeated a great Num∣ber
of the <HI>Argives,</HI> who came up to the Relief
of their Friends in the City, and put to the
Sword the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> who had got Possession of
the Port call'd <HI>Lechoeus.</HI> He broke down a great
Part of the Walls, which were afterwards repair'd
by the <HI>Atbenians;</HI> and the whilst he was pursuing his
Victory, <HI>Agesilaus</HI> ravag'd the Country of the
<HI>Argives;</HI> and his Brother <HI>Teleutias,</HI> the Admiral,
<PB N="80" REF="106"/>
scour'd the <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> taking their Ships
and demolishing their Arsenals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iphicrates sent with Recruits from A∣thens.</NOTE> to put a Stop to these Successes
sent a fresh Supply to their Army, under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>About the Time of his Arrival with a Rein¦forcement, Deputations were sent from <HI>Boeotia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and other Parts, to sound <HI>Agesilaus</HI> in relation t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Peace; but he rejected their Proposals with Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦dain, till hearing soon after, that the Forces h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>The War was continu'd by little Skirmishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Incursions, which chiefly affected the <HI>Ach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ans,</HI> as Confederates of <HI>Sparta.</HI> They were ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>In this manner the <HI>Spartans</HI> maintain'd them∣selves
and their Allies for some time without any
considerable Increase or Diminution of Power. But
their Affairs at Sea were in a more declining
Condition; and the Effects of their Defeat at
<HI>Cnidus</HI> began more visibly to appear. The Cities
in <HI>Asia,</HI> over which they claim'd a Jurisdiction,
finding them so disabled in their Shipping, and
that they had Work enough upon their Hands
at home, readily hearken'd to <HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> who
encourag'd them to revolt from the <HI>Spartans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Asia∣tick</HI> Cities revolt from <HI>Sparta.</HI></NOTE> and
expel their Governors; which they consented to,
upon Condition they might enjoy their own Laws.
He was assisted in this Work by <HI>Conon,</HI> who sug∣gested
to him, that the leaving them in the free
Enjoyment of their Liberty, would be the surest
Means to keep them in his Interest. The like
Attempts were made at <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydus;</HI> but

his Request, but gave him fifty Talents to be
employ'd in that Work, which was accordingly
effected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartans</HI> finding the War brought home
to their own Doors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overtures of Peace. <HI>Olymp.</HI> 97. 2.</NOTE> and that the <HI>Athenians</HI> reap∣ing
the Advantage of it, might soon wrest the
Sovereignty of <HI>Greece</HI> out of their Hands, sent
<HI>Antalcidas</HI> to treat with the <HI>Persians</HI> about a Peace.
He applied himself to <HI>Teribazus</HI> the Governor
of <HI>Sardis,</HI> and offer'd to give up the <HI>Grecian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Cities in <HI>Asia,</HI> provided the Islands, and the o∣ther
Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> might remain free. An Overture
of this Kind was easily hearken'd to:
But the <HI>Athenians</HI> and their Allies taking the
Alarm, sent Ambassadors on their Part likewise,
to join in the Negotiations, and to support the
Interests of their respective Principals. But there
were so many different Pretensions started, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they could not come to any Agreement among
themselves; and <HI>Teribazus</HI> did not think himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sufficiently authoriz'd by his present Instructions
to conclude with the <HI>Spartans</HI> separately. How∣ever,
he was so well affected to them, that, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Treaty was at a stand, he supply'd them it

a Fleet at Sea; wherein he had a further View<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that they might by that Means awe the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

suspected, and to inveigh against him as the chief
Incendiary of the War, and as having promoted
it with no other View, than to aggrandize the
<HI>Athenians</HI> at the Expence of the <HI>Persians.</HI> The
Charge in fact was true, and it was urg'd so
strongly against him, that as he was then at <HI>Sar∣dis</HI>
waiting the Event of the Negotiations, <HI>Teri∣bazus</HI>
thought it proper to seize him, and keep
him in Custody, till he should receive Orders
from his Master, how to dispose of him. Some
say, he sent him to <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> who put him to
death; others, that he escap'd out of Prison, with
the Consent or Connivance of <HI>Teribazus;</HI> the
latter whereof does not seem very probable, be∣cause
we find no further Mention made of him,
either in <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Persia.</HI> So that we may con∣clude
he died about this Time, and that he fell
a Sacrifice to his own ill-tim'd Zeal for the Ser∣vice
of his Country;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conon</HI>'s Death, and Character.</NOTE> which certainly carried him
further than was suitable to the Circumstances he
was under. He had lived as a voluntary Exile
among the <HI>Persians,</HI> who had given him their
Protection and Assistance; he had been favour'd
and trusted by them; he had, by interesting' em
in his Quarrel, broke the Power of <HI>Sparta</HI> at Sea,
and repair'd the Ruins of his own City, and both
at their Charge and Hazard. But not content
with this, he was at the same time practising a∣gainst
them, and endeavouring under-hand to
withdraw from them several Cities, and the whole
Provinces of <HI>Ionia</HI> and <HI>Aeolia,</HI> in order to annex
<PB N="84" REF="110"/>
them to the Dominions of <HI>Athens;</HI> and all this
under a Pretence of rescuing them from the Ty∣ranny
of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and securing them to the <HI>Per∣sians.</HI>
They could not, when they were let into
a Discovery of these Artifices, think he had made
a suitable Return for what he ow'd them; nor
indeed can this Part of his Character be otherwise
justified, than by that false Principle, which had
generally obtain'd among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> to give
up every thing that interfered with what they
call'd the Honour, or Advantage of their Coun∣try.
This was carried so far, as, in some Cases,
to destroy the common Distinctions of Right and
Wrong; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> themselves, notwith∣standing
their severe Justice in other Respects,
were so loose in this particular, that nothing was
esteem'd base, that was beneficial. Another
Motive for his exerting himself in so extraordi∣nary
a manner, might be in order to redeem his
own Honour, which does not seem to stand quite
clear in the Affair of <HI>Aegos-potamos. Nepos</HI> in∣deed
says, he was absent from his Command at
the Time of that Engagement; and assigns that
as the Cause of the Defeat. But the most na∣tural
and authentick Account is, that he was
present in the Action, but that being over∣power'd
by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sander,</HI> and seeing no Probability
of Success on his Side, made his Escape with
eight or nine Ships, and retir'd to <HI>Cyprus.</HI> This
agrees with what is further said of him, that
he was afraid and asham'd to return to <HI>Athens;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="111"/>
which it is plain he did not attempt till several
Years after, when he had done enough to wipe
off that Stain. The latter Part of his Life was
certainly without Reproach, either as to his
Courage, or Capacity; of both which he had
given sufficient Proofs, and had made himself so
formidable to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> that they were glad
upon any Terms to get rid of him; and it was
by the most abject Submission to the <HI>Persians,</HI>
that they compass'd it. The Dread they had
conceiv'd of him, seems to have been the Grounds
of that scandalous Peace, which they soon after∣wards
concluded: And as they began from that
Day forward to decline in their Reputation and
Power, we may look upon <HI>Conon</HI> as having more
remotely occasion'd their DownfaI.</P>
<P>Upon the Offers of Peace made to <HI>Teribazus,</HI>
he went up to <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> to give an Account
of his Proceedings, and to receive fresh Instru∣ctions.
In the mean time <HI>Struthas</HI> was sent to
command in the <HI>Lower Asia,</HI> and to take care
of the Sea-Coasts. He was not so well inclin'd
to the <HI>Spartans</HI> as his Predecessor, being more
exasperated at what had been done by <HI>Agesilaus.</HI>
Whereupon they sent <HI>Thimbron</HI> with a good Body
of Troops to keep him in Action; which he did
at first with good Success; but ranging about
with a separate Party in quest of Booty, was
surpriz'd by <HI>Struthas,</HI> and kill'd. He was suc∣ceeded
by <HI>Diphridas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thimbron</HI> kill'd. Succeeded by <HI>Diphri∣das.</HI></NOTE> who was a Man of better
Conduct, at least of more Caution; and he having
<PB N="86" REF="112"/>
gather'd up the Remains of the Army, main∣tain'd
his Ground in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aces which had sub∣mitted
to <HI>Thimbron.</HI></P>
<P>There were at this Time two contending Par∣ties
at <HI>Rhodes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commoti∣ons at</HI> Rhodes. Olymp. 97. 3.</NOTE> concerning the Form of Govern∣ment
there; and they were supported by their
respective Patrons, those for the <HI>Democracy</HI> by
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and the others for the <HI>Oligarchy</HI>
by the <HI>Spartans.</HI> The latter being over-power'd,
and forc'd off the Island, made their Complaints
at <HI>Sparta;</HI> and <HI>Ecdicus</HI> was dispatch'd with eight
Ships to their Relief. But finding himself too
weak to do any thing to the Purpose, <HI>Teleutias</HI>
the Admiral was sent with twenty-seven Sail,
with which he restor'd the Exiles, and the <HI>Oli∣garchy.</HI>
This was a Matter of too much Conse∣quence
to the <HI>Athenians</HI> to be given up. They
were sensible how much their Sovereignty in the
Island (which was truly the Point in Question)
depended on the Form of Government, which
should prevail in it; and therefore sent out <HI>Thra∣sybulus</HI>
to put Things upon the former footing.
Before he durst attempt any thing at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> he
went into <HI>Thrace,</HI> where he gain'd over two
<HI>Persian</HI> Princes to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Interest; he then
took in <HI>Byzantium, Chalcis,</HI> and several other
Cities upon the <HI>Hellespont;</HI> and from thence he
went to chastise the <HI>Lesbians,</HI> who were all of
them, except those of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> in the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Interest. Having succeeded thus far, he sail'd
towards <HI>Rhodes.</HI> He had in his Way levied a
<PB N="87" REF="113"/>
Sum of Mony for Contribution upon the Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Aspendus:</HI> But they being afterwards
ill treated by his Soldiers, rose in a great Fury,
and murder'd him in his Tent.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thrasybu∣lus</HI> mur∣der'd. His Cha∣racter.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the End of this great Patriot, to
whom <HI>Athens</HI> ow'd as signal a Deliverance, as
any she had receiv'd in the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars. We
need only consider her Condition under the Ty∣ranny
of <HI>The Thirty;</HI> when of those who had
escap'd the Fate of a long War, some had been
murder'd, others banish'd, and their Estates con∣fiscated;
when the City was one continu'd Scene
of Outrage and Violence; and when those few
good Men who still remain'd, and express'd a
Sense of recovering the publick Liberty, yet
chose rather to content themselves with talking
of it, than really to attempt it: Yet even then
did <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> rise in a manner singly against
the united Power of the Oppressors. It having
been already related with what Prudence, Zeal
and Intrepidity he conducted that Affair, I will
here only add an Observation which has been
made, that the Success of this Enterprize was
chiefly owing to its desperateness. For the Con∣tempt,
with which <HI>The Thirty</HI> treated it in the
Beginning, made them neglect the proper Means
of providing for their Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fety. <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> in the
mean time went on with his Design, and en∣creas'd
his Followers: And when they sound
him in a Condition to make head against them,
they thought fit to make him an Offer of sharing
<PB N="88" REF="114"/>
in the Tyranny with them, upon Condition he
would desist. But it was not to be suppos'd, that
one who had the Courage to project such an En∣terprize,
and who had advanc'd it so far, would
hearken to any other Terms, than the entirely
restoring the Freedom of his Country. His pub∣lick-spiritedness,
together with his Fidelity, Con∣stancy
and Magnanimity, made him at least
equal to the greatest Men of his Time. There
were several indeed, whose Atchievements hap∣pen'd
to make a greater Noise in the World:
But none of them had a more real Foundation
of Merit. And therefore <HI>Nepos</HI> says of him,
<HI>That if Virtue were to be consider'd abstractedly
from Fortune, he should be inclin'd to give</HI> Thra∣sybulus
<HI>the first Place in his Catalogue of War∣thies.</HI></P>
<P>The
<HI>Spartans</HI> at this Time sent <HI>Anaxibius</HI> with
a small Supply of Mony and Shipping, to re∣trieve
their Affairs in the <HI>Hellespont.</HI> And there∣upon
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to secure the Places recover'd
by <HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> order'd out <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> with eight
Gallies, and twelve hundred Men, being chiefly
those who serv'd under him in his <HI>Corinthian</HI> Ex∣pedition.
Before any considerable Action hap∣pen'd
on either Side, <HI>Iphicrates</HI> intercepted
<HI>Anaxibius</HI> in his Way to <HI>Abydus</HI> by an Ambus∣cade,
and rushing out upon him, <HI>Here,</HI> said the
<HI>Spartan</HI> General to his Men, <HI>must I die; take
care of yourselves.</HI> And accordingly he was kill'd,
with a good Number of those about him.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="115"/>
About the Time of these Transactions abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Aegi∣netans</HI> in∣fest the Coast of <HI>Attica. Olymp.</HI> 97. 4.</NOTE> 
the Coast of <HI>Attica</HI> was infested by the People of
<HI>Eegina.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> made a Descent upon
them, and had in some measure block'd them
up by Sea and Land; but they were soon after
repuls'd by them and the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who assisted
them, and who had fomented the Quarrel.
Thereupon the Islanders renew'd their Insults,
till at length they were humbled by a Victory
obtain'd against them by <HI>Chabrias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But are repuls'd by <HI>Chab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ias.</HI></NOTE> an <HI>Athenian</HI> of
good Reputation; and those Seas were clear'd
for the present.</P>
<P>But <HI>Chabrias</HI> being soon after sent to the As∣sistance
of <HI>Evagoras,</HI> King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and a
Friend to <HI>Athens,</HI> the <HI>Spartans</HI> took Advantage
of his Absence, and form'd a Design of surpri∣sing
the <HI>Athenians</HI> Ships in their Harbour. Ac∣cordingly
<HI>Teleutias</HI> enter'd the <HI>Piraeus</HI> by Night,
where most of the Men being on Shore, he took
several Merchant Ships, with three or four
Gallies, and sunk or disabled as many more as
the Time would allow; and having put the City
under a general Consternation, he return'd, and
prey'd upon the Coast, seizing the FishingVessels,
with such other Booty as sell in his
Way.</P>
<P>In this manner did these States for some
time carry on a kind of a pyratical War, with∣out
any regular Engagement, and without bring∣ing
things to any general Issue. But the <HI>Athe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI>
being so ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fass'd on all Sides, the <HI>Spartans</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="116"/>
having more Garrisons than they could maintain
and their Confederates revolting from them, and
the other States being drain'd and tir'd out, began by mutual Consent to think of a Peace with
the <HI>Persians;</HI> which <HI>Teribazus,</HI> being now re∣turn'd
from his Master, had full Power to con∣clude.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace of <HI>Antal∣cidas.</HI></NOTE> The Conditions were, <HI>That all the Cities
in</HI> Asia, <HI>with the Island<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of</HI> Clazomenae, <HI>should be
under the Jurisdiction of</HI> Persia; <HI>That the Islands

continue so;</HI> and, <HI>That all the other Cities of</HI>

were submitted to by all but the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who
refus'd to give up their Jurisdiction over the
Towns in <HI>Boeotia:</HI> But they were afterwards
over-aw'd, and forc'd into it.</P>
<P>This Peace was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3618. Olymp. 98. 2.</NOTE> according to the
most general Account, in the second Year of the

undoing all that had been done there by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

which the last War against <HI>Persia</HI> was founded.
Wherefore this Proceeding of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> in

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Peace of Antalcidas, to the

<P>THE Treaty, tho' it was principally between
<HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> was made to extend like∣wise
to the <HI>Grecians</HI> among themselves; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

was, took upon them the Execution of this Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Treaty, and, under the Notion of Gua∣rantees,
explain'd it as they thought fit, and ac∣cording
as they were sway'd by their Passion, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Interest.</P>
<P>They began with the <HI>Mantineans,</HI> and, the
Year after the Peace, sent their King <HI>Agesipoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
to throw down their Walls; which he effected
<PB N="93" REF="119"/>
by turning against them the Course of the River
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat ran thro' the City; by which Means the
Foundation being sapp'd and weaken'd, the In∣habitants
despair'd of making any Defence, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apitulated. This was the same Stratagem that
<HI>Cimon</HI> formerly made use of, when he took <HI>Eion,</HI>
situate upon the River <HI>Strymon.</HI> They were
oblig'd, by the Terms of their Surrender, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anton themselves into Villages. This Proceed∣ing
of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> was in Revenge for their
having taken Part against them in the late Wars;
and with a View to reduce them so, as that they
should not be in a Condition to unite against 'em.
Some other little States they treated less rigo∣rously,
but yet with such an Air of Superiority
and Controul, as plainly shew'd, they expected
to be obey'd. In order to keep them under their
Dependence, and at the same time to make them
a little sanguine in their Interest, they would, in
some Cases, redress their Grievances, restore their
Exiles, compose their Differences, and do such
other popular Acts of Justice, as to make them
think, they were executing the Treaty to their
Advantage, and that they were the Authors of
their Liberty. And among the greater States,
they had oblig'd the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to withdraw
their Garrison from <HI>Argos;</HI> which, with their
freeing the <HI>Boeotian</HI> Cities, and some other In∣stances
of that kind, had rais'd their Reputation
for the present, and taken off a good deal of the
<PB N="94" REF="120"/>
Odium, which they had contracted by the Treaty
in other Respects.</P>
<P>The People who gave them most Disturbance
at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They quar∣rel with the <HI>Olyn∣thians.</HI></NOTE> were the <HI>Olynthians,</HI> who were started
up on a sudden, and grown so powerful, that
they not only held the neighbouring Places in
Subjection, but had over-run a great Part of
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> and taken many Towns, with <HI>Pell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
the <HI>Metropolis;</HI> wherein they copied after the
Example of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and under a Pretence of de∣livering
those Places from the Tyranny of <HI>A∣myntas</HI>
their King, had in a manner drove him
out of his Dominions. the Inhabitants of <HI>A∣canthus</HI>
and <HI>Apollonia</HI> Finding themselves under a
Necessity of submitting to them, if they were
not supported against them, represented their
Case to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who looking upon the <HI>O∣lynthians</HI>
with a jealous Eye, made no Difficulty
of granting their Protection to those Cities, and
immediately dispatch'd Two Thousand Men,
under the Command of <HI>Eudamidas,</HI> who recover'd
<HI>Potidaea,</HI> and fortify'd several Parts of <HI>Thrace.</HI>
In the mean time his Brother <HI>Phaebidas</HI> was sent
to join him with a greater Body of Troops.</P>
<P>But an Incident happen'd in his March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phaebidas <HI>seizes</HI> the Cadmea <HI>at</HI> Thebes. Olymp. 99. 3.</NOTE> which
prov'd to be of more Consequence to the Affairs
of <HI>Greece,</HI> than was at first apprehended. When
he arriv'd at <HI>Thebes,</HI> he found the City divided
into Factions, one Party being headed by <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nias,</HI>
and the other by <HI>Leontiades.</HI> They were
<PB N="95" REF="121"/>
two of the Polemarchs, or Governors of the
City; and the latter being in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Inte∣rest,
and finding, that he could not otherwise get
the better of his Colleague, betray'd the Citadel,
call'd <HI>Cadmea,</HI> to <HI>Phaebidas;</HI> then seiz'd <HI>Ismenias,</HI>
and forc'd his Party, to the Number of Four
Hundred, to fly to <HI>Athens</HI> for Refuge. This
made a great Noise there, and in the other Parts
of <HI>Greece;</HI> and even at <HI>Sparta</HI> they were so
asham'd of it, that they pretended to resent it;
for they were sensible the <HI>Thebans</HI> had done no∣thing
in Violation of the Treaty, since they had
submitted to it; that their domestick Dissensions
did not concern the Publick; and that <HI>Phaebidas</HI>
had no Authority to intermeddle in them.
But this Action was excus'd by <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who
was suppos'd to be at the Bottom of the Design.
He consider'd it in no other Light, than as it was
of Advantage to the Common-wealth; and de∣clar'd
his Opinion, <HI>That if it answer'd in that Re∣spect,
it matter'd not by what Authority it was
done.</HI> He added further, in Behalf of <HI>Phaebidas,
That in an Enterprize of that Nature, Orders were
not to be expected.</HI> This way of reasoning so far
prevail'd with the <HI>Spartan</HI> Government, that they
avow'd and justify'd the Action, tho' at the same
time they punish'd the Actor; for they impos'd
a Fine of ten thousand <HI>Drachmas</HI> on <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bidas,</HI>
and depriv'd him of his Command: Which
<HI>Plutarch</HI> takes notice of as a ridiculous Incon∣sistency.
And <HI>Polybius,</HI> in condem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the <HI>Ae∣tolians,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="122"/>
for a Procedure of the like Kind, com∣pares
them to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who, when <HI>Phaebidas</HI>
had, contrary to all Faith and Treaties, seiz'd the
<HI>Cadmea,</HI> punish'd the Author of the Treachery,
but did not withdraw their Garrison; as if, says
he, that Punishment could wipe out the Injustice
of the Action, and give full Satisfaction to the
<HI>Thebans.</HI> He makes a further Remark applica∣ble
to the present Occasion, that, upon the Peace
they proclaim'd publickly, they would restore all
the Cities to their Liberties, and yet did not re∣call
any of the Governors, whom they had plac'd
in them. He then adds, <HI>That 'tis the Heighth of
Madness, join'd to the most consummate Wickedness,
to pretend, that a Man needs only shut his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Eyes, to hinder others from seeing him.</HI></P>
<P>However the <HI>Spartans</HI> kept Possession of the
Citadel, and confirm'd <HI>Leontiades</HI> in the Govern∣ment,
to whom <HI>Archias</HI> was join'd in Commis∣sion,
as having been an Accomplice with him
in the Treachery. In the next Place they pro∣cur'd
Articles to be exhibited against <HI>Ismenias,</HI>
for having taken Mony of the <HI>Persians,</HI> and

and Admiral. He was also rich and liberal, and
had endear'd himself so much to those who serv'd
under him, that upon his Return home in a for∣mer
Expedition, they flock'd about him, to crown
him with Wreaths and Garlands. And <HI>Xenophon
says, His manner of engaging the Affections of the Sol∣diers,
deserv'd more to be taken notice of, than the
Wealth he possess'd, or the Dangers he underwent.</HI>
But whatever his personal Merit was, he ow'd
a great deal to <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who was his half Bro∣ther,
and was chieFly instrumental in the raising
and supporting him.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="124"/>
The <HI>Spartans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succeeded By <HI>Agesi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olis</HI></NOTE>, as soon as they heard of his
Death, sent their King <HI>Agesipolis</HI> in his room.
He having collected the Forces, which were much
shatter'd and dispers'd by the last Action, took
<HI>Torone</HI> a Town in Alliance with the <HI>Olynthians,</HI>
and harass'd the Country; but the Fatigue and
extreme Heats of the Season threw him into a
Fever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">his Death.</NOTE> of which he died. <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who had
lived in good Friendship with him, lamented his
Loss. There had indeed, at his first setting out,
been a secret Emulation between them; which <HI>A∣gesilaus</HI>
perceiving, easily got the better of, and
moulded him to his Purpose. For being natu∣rally
modest and tractable, but indolent withal,
and averse to Business, his Colleague took care to
cultivate in him this mild Disposition; and in or∣der
to take off the Edge of his Ambition, enter∣tain'd
him with Dogs and Horses, and Love-af∣fairs,
and went so far as to recommend Boys to
him, and assist him in his Amours.</P>
<P>He was succeeded in the Command by <HI>Poly∣biades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polybiades takes <HI>O∣lynthus.</HI> Olym. 100. 1.</NOTE> who besieged <HI>Olynthus,</HI> and reduced it by
Famine. The Conditions imposed on the Inha∣bitants,
were, <HI>That they shou'd have the same
Friends and Foes with the</HI> Spartans; <HI>and that they
should join with them, as Confederates, in all their
Wars.</HI></P>
<P>This War continued near three Years;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> quar∣rel with the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siasi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> and it
was no sooner ended, but the <HI>Spartans</HI> were call'd
upon to chastise the <HI>Phliasians</HI> for having ill treat∣ed

their Interposition. They made their Complaints
at <HI>Sparta,</HI> and were fin'd for so doing: But upon
their repeated Instances for Protection, the <HI>Ephori</HI>
declared War; and <HI>Agesilaus</HI> was sent to do them
Justice. He required of them to deliver up their
Castle; which they refusing to do, he laid Siege
to the City. They made a very obstinate De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence,
even to the imprisoning such as did but
mention any thing of a Surrender; 'till at length,
their Provisions failing them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are reduc'd by <HI>Agesilaus.</HI></NOTE> they were reduced
to the last Extremity, and sent to <HI>Sparta</HI> to obtain
the best Terms they could. In the mean time,
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> leFt a Garrison in the Town, and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned
home, after he had spent above a Year
and an half in this Expedition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartans</HI> had by this time, under colour
of putting things upon that equal footing, which
was required by the Treaty, gain'd such an In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rease
of Power and Authority to themselves,
that there was no State in a Condition to make
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead against them. But in the midst of this
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecurity, they were alarmed from a Quarter,
where they least expected it. The <HI>Thebans</HI> had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or four Years, since the seizing of the Citadel,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubmitted to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Yoke;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> The∣bans <HI>reco∣ver the</HI> Cadm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a. Olymp. 100. 2.</NOTE> but they now
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook occasion, by a very desperate Attempt, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrow it off. For which purpose, there was a se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ret
Correspondence carried on between the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable of the Exiles at <HI>Athens,</HI> and those
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho were well affected to them in <HI>Thebes;</HI> and
Measures were concerted between them by <HI>Phylli∣das</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="126"/>
Secretary to the <HI>Theban</HI> Governors; by whose
Contrivan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a competent Number of the Exiles
were to get into the City; and <HI>Charon,</HI> a Man
of the first Rank there, offer'd his House for
their Reception. The Day being fix'd, they set
out from <HI>Athens;</HI> and Twelve of the most active
and resolute among them, were detached to en∣ter
the City, the rest remaining at a proper Di∣stance,
to wait the Event. The first who offer'd
himself, was <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> who was young and da∣ring,
and had been very zealous in encouraging
the Design; and by the Share he had in it, gave
a sufficient earnest of what might be further
expected from him in the Service of his Coun∣try.
The next Man of Consequence, was <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦lon,</HI> who by some is said to have first projected
the Affair with <HI>Phyllidas.</HI> These two, with their
ten Associates, dress'd themselves like Peasan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and beat about the Fields with Dogs and Hunt∣ing-poles,
as in search of Game. By which means
having pass'd unsuspected, and convey'd them¦selves 
into the City, they met at <HI>Charon</HI>'s House
as the general Rendezvous, where they were so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
after join'd by Thirty six more of their Confe¦derates.
It was concerted, that <HI>Phyllidas</HI> sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
on that Day give a great Entertainment to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

appointed by the <HI>Spartans;</HI> and, to make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
more compleat, he had engaged to provide so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the finest Women in the Town to give th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
a Meeting. Matters being thus prepar'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="101" REF="127"/>
Associates divided themselves into two Bands;
one of which, led by <HI>Charon</HI> and <HI>Mellon,</HI> were
to attack <HI>Archias,</HI> and his Company. And hav∣ing
put on Womens Cloaths over their Armour,
with Pine and Poplar over their Heads, to shade
their Faces, they took their Opportunity,
when the Guests were well heated with Wine,
to enter the Room, and immediately stabb'd
<HI>Archias</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> with such others of the
Company, as were pointed out to them by
<HI>Phyllidas.</HI> A little before this Execution, <HI>Ar∣chias</HI>
received an Express from <HI>Athens,</HI> with all
the Particulars of the Conspiracy; and the
Courier conjured him in the Name of the Per∣son
who wrote the Letters, that he should read
them forthwith; for that they contain'd Matter
of great Importance. But he laid them by un∣open'd,
and with a Smile said, <HI>Business to mor∣row;</HI>
which Words upon that Occasion grew
into a Proverb.</P>
<P>The other Band, headed by <HI>Pelopidas</HI> and
<HI>Damoclides,</HI> went to attack <HI>Leontiades,</HI> who was
at home, and in Bed. They rush'd into his
House by Surprise; but he soon taking the A∣larm,
leap'd up, and, with his Sword in his
Hand, received them at his Chamber-door, and
stabb'd <HI>Cephisodorus,</HI> who was the first Man
that attempted to enter. <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was the next
who encounter'd him, and after a long and
difficult Dispute, kill'd him. From thence they
went in pursuit of <HI>Hypates</HI> his Friend and Neigh∣bour,
<PB N="102" REF="128"/>
and dispatch'd him likewise. After which
they join'd the other Band, and sent to hasten the
Exiles they had left in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P>The whole City was by this time fill'd with
Terror and Confusion; the Houses full of Lights,
and the Inhabitants running to and fro in the
Streets in a wild distracted manner, and wait∣ing
impatiently for Day-light, that they might
distinguish their Friends from their Foes, and
determine what course to take. Early in the
Morning the Exiles came in arm'd; and <HI>Pe∣lopidas</HI>
appear'd with his Party in a General
Assembly of the People, encompass'd by the
Priests carrying Garlands in their Hands, pro∣claiming
Liberty to the <HI>Thebans</HI> in general, and
exhorting them to fight for their Gods and
their Country. For tho' they had made such a
prosperous Beginning, the most difficult Part still
remain'd, whilst the Citadel was in the Possessi∣on
of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> with a Garrison of fifteen
hundred Men, besides a great Number of Citi∣zens
and others, who had fled to them for Pro∣tection,
and declared themselves on their Side.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> who is very particular in the first Part
of this Transaction, which has been related chiefly
from him, passes over the taking the Citadel
too slightly. He only says, that <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> with
<HI>Charon</HI> and <HI>Mellon,</HI> block'd it up, attack'd it,
and got possession of it, before any Succours
could arrive from <HI>Sparta.</HI> But it is not probable,
that should be the Work of a Day, or that it
<PB N="103" REF="129"/>
should have been effected with so small a Force:
And therefore this Part is to be supplied from
<HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> who says, that the <HI>Athenians</HI>
early the next Morning after, sent five thousand
Foot, and two thousand Horse to <HI>Pelopidas</HI>'s
Assistance, and that several other Bodies of
Troops came in from all the Cities of <HI>Boeotia,</HI>
to the Number of seven thousand; that the
Castle being besieged by this Army held out for
several Days, but surrender'd at last for want of
Provisions. Others say, they capitulated more
out of Fear than Necessity, and that the Com∣mander,
at his Return to <HI>Sparta,</HI> was put to
death for it. However the Citadel, upon which
the whole depended, was recovered; and as the
gaining that restored the <HI>Thebans</HI> to their for∣mer
Liberty, so it was the Foundation of their
future Greatness.</P>
<P>This Action bore so near a Resemblance to
that of <HI>Thrasybulus,</HI> whether we consider the
Courage of the Actors, the Hazards and Diffi∣culties
of the Undertaking, the Manner in which
it was conducted, or the Success and Consequen∣ces
with which it was attended, that it was
called <HI>Its Sister.</HI> And <HI>Pelopidas</HI> proposed that
Enterprise as a Pattern to the Exiles, when he
exhorted them not to content themselves with
living in a lazy Dependence on the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and to fawn for fear upon every smooth∣tongu'd
Orator, but to exert themselves like
<HI>Thrasybulus;</HI> and that, as he had advanced from
<PB N="104" REF="130"/>
<HI>Thebes,</HI> to break the Power of the Tyrants at
<HI>Athens,</HI> they should in like manner march from
<HI>Athens,</HI> to set <HI>Thebes</HI> at Liberty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartans</HI> were so enraged, and so far
from giving up their usurped Dominion, that
they sent their King <HI>Cleombrotus</HI> in the Depth
of Winter to make War upon the <HI>Thebans.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> de∣clare War against them.</NOTE> But
after he had deseated some small straggling Par∣ties,
he left the Prosecution of his Designs to
<HI>Sphodrias,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Thespiae.</HI> The
<HI>Athenians</HI> were afraid, by entering into this
Quarrel, to draw the <HI>Spartans</HI> upon them; and
therefore withdrew their Protection and Assistance
from the <HI>Thebans.</HI> The <HI>Thebans,</HI> on the other
hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> create a Quarrel bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Spar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI></NOTE> not thinking themselves able singly to
cope with the <HI>Spartans,</HI> contrived to create a
Misunderstanding between these two States, in
order to bring over the <HI>Athenians</HI> to them. Ac∣cordingly
they practis'd under-hand with <HI>Spho∣drias,</HI>
and put him upon a Project of attacking
the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> as a thing that would redound to
his Honour, and be very advantageous and agreea∣ble
to his Principals. He was brave and ambi∣tious,
but rash withal, and indiscreet; and he
was work'd up to it, partly by flattering his
Vanity, and partly by Presents. It was concer∣ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp. 100. 4.</NOTE> that he should march in the dead of Night,
so as to be able to make his Attack upon the
Place by break of Day: But he fail'd in his
Time; and when he was got as far as <HI>Ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis,</HI>
the Design took Air, and miscarried. How∣ever
<PB N="105" REF="131"/>
he had done enough to alarm and incense
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who thereupon imprison'd the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Ambassadors. But the State disavow'd
this Proceeding of their Officer, and call'd him
to an Account for it. <HI>Agesilaus</HI> urg'd in his
Behalf, <HI>That he was an honest Man, and that the
Common-wealth stood in need of such Soldiers,</HI> and
got him acquitted; which he is said to have
done at the Intercession of his Son <HI>Archidamus,</HI>
who had a Love-Affair with <HI>Cleonymus</HI> the Son
of <HI>Sphodrias.</HI> This Attempt made in a profound
Peace, and without the least Provocation given,
was of the same kind with that of the <HI>Cad∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI>
tho' it had not the same Success; and it
was Matter of great Surprise, that the Author
of it should go unpunished. It is therefore to
be look'd upon as one of those glaring Instan∣ces
of the Partiality of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Government,
in Cases wherein their Interest was concerned:
And the <HI>Athenians</HI> resented it accordingly. For
they immediately declared themselves on the Side
of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and joining heartily with them,
drew to their Confederacy several of the Cities,
which were grown weary of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Ty∣ranny.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Spartans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 101. 1.</NOTE> in order to retain those Places
which had not yet revolted, abated of their usual
Severity to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spar∣tans in∣vade <HI>Boeo∣tia.</HI></NOTE> and sent <HI>Agesilaus</HI> and <HI>Cleom∣brotus</HI>
by turns, with a good Body of Troops,
into <HI>Boeotia;</HI> where they made several Cam∣paigns,
but did little more than shew them∣selves,
<PB N="106" REF="132"/>
and harass the Country, with the Loss of
many of their Men; among whom was <HI>Phae∣bidas,</HI>
who, since the Affair of the <HI>Cadmea,</HI> com∣manded
in the Garrison at <HI>Thespioe,</HI> and after∣wards
in the Army, upon the Absence of the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>The Man who signaliz'd himself most against
the <HI>Spartans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are op∣posed by <HI>Chabrias. Olymp.</HI> 101. 2.</NOTE> was <HI>Chabrias</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> who
had serv'd well at Sea and Land, and was now
pitch'd upon as the best Officer of his Time to
oppose to <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who had enter'd <HI>Boeotia</HI> with
eighteen thousand Foot, and fifteen hundred
Horse; and whose Name struck such a Terror
into the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they propos'd nothing more
than standing upon their Defence; and to that
end, possess'd themselves of an Hill near the
City. <HI>Agesilaus</HI> detach'd a Party of light-arm'd
Men to provoke them to come down, and give
him Battle; which they declining, he drew out
his whole Forces, in order to attack them. <HI>Cha∣brias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc∣cesses.</NOTE> who commanded the Mercenaries on the
Part of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> order'd his Men to present
themselves, and keep their Ranks in close Order,
with their Shields laid down at their Feet, and
their Spears advanc'd, and with one Leg put
forward, and the Knee upon the half-bent. <HI>Age∣silaus</HI>
finding them prepar'd in this manner to re∣ceive
him, and that they stood, as it were, in
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance of him, thought fit to withdraw his
Army, and contented himself with ravaging the
Country. This was look'd upon as an extraor∣dinary
<PB N="107" REF="133"/>
Stratagem; and <HI>Chabrias</HI> valu'd himself
so much upon it, that he procur'd his Statue to
be erected in that Posture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartans</HI> having done nothing consider∣able
enough to answer the Losses and Expence of
these Expeditions, resolv'd to try their Fortune
at Sea; and fitted out a Fleet of seventy Sail,
under the Command of <HI>Pollis,</HI> who endeavour'd
to intercept a great Quantity of Corn design'd
for <HI>Athens,</HI> and had in a manner block'd up
the City. But <HI>Chabrias</HI> having Notice of this
Design, came up with the <HI>Spartan</HI> Fleet, and
having defeated it, convoy'd the Transport Ships
safe into the <HI>Piraeus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chabrias</HI> acting offensively in his turn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Victory at <HI>Naxus.</HI></NOTE> sail'd
with the Fleet to <HI>Naxus,</HI> and laid Siege to it;
and <HI>Pollis</HI> coming up to the Relief of the Island,
a very sharp Engagement ensu'd, wherein the
<HI>Athenians</HI> dispers'd the whole <HI>Spartan</HI> Fleet, hav∣ing
destroy'd twenty-four of their Gallies, and
taken eight, with the Loss of eighteen of their
own. <HI>Chabrias</HI> return'd with his Spoils to <HI>Athens,</HI>
and was highly honour'd, this being the first
Victory at Sea, that had been obtain'd by the
<HI>Athenians</HI> singly, without the Assistance of the
<HI>Persian,</HI> since the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War: And this
had put them upon asserting their former Domi∣nion
at Sea.</P>
<P>For this purpose they order'd their Fleet to sail
round <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 101. 3.</NOTE> under the Conduct of <HI>Timo∣theus,</HI>
who was the Son of <HI>Conon,</HI> and inherited
<PB N="108" REF="134"/>
his Father's Virtues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suc∣cesses of <HI>Timotheus</HI></NOTE> He drew several Towns
and Places on the Coast, some by Force, and
others by Management and mild Treatment, into
the Alliance with <HI>Athens:</HI> Whereupon the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI>
sent out <HI>Nicolochus,</HI> with the Command of
their Fleet, to put a Stop to these Encroach∣ments.
He was hot and daring, and immedi∣ately
fell in with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> before his whole
Number of Ships could join him. But he was
defeated, and <HI>Timotheus</HI> erected a Trophy. This
Action happen'd near <HI>Leucas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> taking Advantage of these Diver∣sions
at Sea, recover'd all the Cities of <HI>Boeotia,</HI>
and invaded <HI>Phocis.</HI> The <HI>Spartans</HI> grew every
Day less terrible to them; so that they began
now to act offensively against them, and had
frequent Encounters with them. And though
they were not regular and decisive Battles, they
were such as serv'd to raise their Courage, and
gain them Experience, and were introductory to
those greater Actions which happen'd afterwards.
The Success of these little Engagements was ge∣nerally
on their Side, and was chiefly owing to
<HI>Pelopidas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and of <HI>Pe∣lopidas.</HI></NOTE> who signaliz'd himself in most of 'em.
In one of them, at a Place call'd <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agra,</HI> he
slew the <HI>Spartan</HI> Commander with his own Hand.
But that which happen'd about the same Time at
<HI>Tegyra,</HI> was more remarkable.</P>
<P>He had form'd a Design of surprising <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣menus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Tegyra.</HI></NOTE> which was garrison'd by the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and
march'd against it with three hundred Foot, and
<PB N="109" REF="135"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Horse: But receiving Intelligence, that a
great Body of <HI>Spartans</HI> were upon their March
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o reinforce the Garrison, he thought it adviseable
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o retire. In his Retreat, he met this Reinforce∣ment
near <HI>Tegyra,</HI> and being oppos'd by them,
he order'd his Horse, who were in the Rear, to
advance and engage them, relying on his Foot
for the main Stress of the Battle. The Attack
was very furious on both Sides: But <HI>Gorgoleon</HI>
and <HI>Theopompus,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
soon sell; and all who were near them, were ei∣ther
kill'd, or put to Flight; which struck such
a Terror into the rest of their Troops, that they
open'd a Passage for the <HI>Thebans</HI> to pursue their
March. But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> would not quit the Field,
till he had made a further Slaughter among 'em,
and thoroughly routed and dispers'd them. He
acquir'd more Reputation by this Retreat, than
he could have got by succeeding in his original
Design against <HI>Orchomenus:</HI> And it was a more
signal Disgrace to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> than they had
hitherto met with; for they had at least three
times as many Men in the Field. And it was
never known before, that in all their Wars, whe∣ther
against <HI>Grecians</HI> or <HI>Barbarians,</HI> they had
been beat by fewer Troops than their own, or
even by an equal Number. It must indeed be
allow'd, that these three hundred Foot were the
Flower of the <HI>Theban</HI> Army; and they were di∣stinguish'd
by the Name of <HI>The Sacred Battalion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sacred Battali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> 
They were as remarkable for their Fidelity and
<PB N="110" REF="136"/>
Affection to one another, as they were for their
Courage, and in that respect were likewise call'd,
<HI>The Band of Lovers.</HI> There are several fabulous
Accounts concerning them: But all that can be
reasonably collected from them, is, that they
were a brave determin'd Set of young Men, who
had vow'd perpetual Friendship, and sworn to
stand by one another to the last Drop of their
Blood. They were said to have been first rais'd
by <HI>Gorgidas,</HI> who was one of the Governors of
<HI>Boeotia,</HI> in Conjunction with <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> and had a
considerable Share in the Transactions of that
Time. He us'd them chiefly as a Guard to the
Citadel, but employ'd them occasionally in other
Services of the War; and upon an Engagement,
he chose to divide and mix them in the Ranks
with the other Troops, in order to animate them
by their Example. But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> found a better
Effect in keeping them in one entire Body; and
after the Proofs they had given him of their Be∣haviour
in this Action, he constantly charg'd at
the Head of them, in the same manner, without
breaking and dispersing them. They are said to
have remain'd invincible till the Battle of <HI>Che∣ronea,</HI>
which happen'd some Years after, when
they were every Man of them cut down by the
<HI>Macedonian Phalanx:</HI> And the next Day <HI>Philip</HI>
taking a View of the Field of Battle, look'd on
them with Surprise, as they lay all together a∣mong
the Slain, and extolling their Virtue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p
over them.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="137"/>
It was this Battle of <HI>Tegyra,</HI> says <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
which first convinc'd the <HI>Grecians,</HI> that the Breed
of martial Spirits is not confin'd to the Banks of
the <HI>Eurotas;</HI> but that true Courage and Bravery
are the Growth of every Country, where the In∣habitants
are brought up with a Sense of Honour
and Justice, and are more afraid of the least Dis∣grace,
than of the greatest Danger.</P>
<P>These Successes of the <HI>Thebans</HI> made the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
begin to think they gain'd Ground a little
too fast; and whatever Cause of Resentment they
had against <HI>Sparta,</HI> they did not care to carry it
so far, as to raise the Power of one State upon the
Destruction of the other: Which Consideration
inclin'd them towards an Accomodation. It hap∣pen'd
at the same time, that <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> wanting
a Supply of <HI>Grecian</HI> Troops to assist him in his
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> War, and which could not easily be
spar'd, without putting an end to these intestine
Broils, sent his Ambassadors into <HI>Greece</HI> to renew
the <HI>Peace of Antalcidas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace of Antalci∣das re∣new'd. <HI>Olymp.</HI> 102. 1.</NOTE> which in the present
Conjuncture met with very little Difficulty, ex∣cept
from the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who would not give up
their Jurisdiction over the Cities of <HI>Boeotia.</HI> The
general Tenor of the Treaty was as before, <HI>That
all the Cities for the future should be govern'd by
their own Laws;</HI> with an additional Provision,
<HI>That all the Garrisons should be withdrawn;</HI> which
was accordingly executed by Commissioners ap∣pointed
for that Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="138"/>
During the short Respite that was by this Means
given to the <HI>Grecians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Body of <HI>Grecians</HI> employ'd by the <HI>Persi∣ans</HI> against <HI>Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> engag'd twenty

Pharnabazus,</HI> who had the Charge of the War,
and had been two Years in making Preparations
for it, had got together an Army of two hun∣dred
thousand Men, besides this Body of <HI>Grecians,</HI>
with a proportionable Number of Shipping, to
act in concert with the Land Forces. He sent
to <HI>Athens</HI> to demand that <HI>Chabrias,</HI> who then
serv'd as a Voluntier with the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> might
be recall'd home,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iphicrates</HI> commands them.</NOTE> and that <HI>Iphicrates</HI> might be
sent to command the <HI>Grecians;</HI> both which Point<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were readily complied with. The general Ren∣dezvous
was at <HI>Ace,</HI> afterwards call'd <HI>Ptolemai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI>
where it was resolv'd to attack <HI>Pelusium,</HI> one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the <HI>Seven Mouths</HI> of the <HI>Nile,</HI> as the most con∣venient
Passage into the Country: But the <HI>Ae∣gyptians</HI>
had so long Notice given them to pro∣vide
for their Defence, that they had made that
Place inaccessible both by Sea and Land. Where,
upon <HI>Pharnabazus</HI> order'd the Fleet to <HI>Mende∣sium,</HI>
another <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and made a
Descent with three thousand Men, who, after a
vigorous Resistance, took the Place. <HI>Iphicrates</HI>
took the Fort likewise, with those who had retir'd
into it; and being flush'd with this Success, pro∣pos'd
to go, without Loss of Time, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ack
<HI>Memphis,</HI> the capital City of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> But <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣nabazus</HI>
chose rather to stay till his whole Forces

it. The other urg'd the Necessity of marching
immediately against it, and, in order to cut off
all further Pretences, offer'd to do it with only
his own Troops; which being likewise refus'd, it
was plainly seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pharnaba∣zus</HI> is jea∣lous of him.</NOTE> that <HI>Pharnabazus</HI> was jealous of
his having too great a Share in the Honour of the
Expedition. Whilst this Matter was in Debate
between them, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> put a strong Gar∣rison
into <HI>Memphis;</HI> and drawing down the rest
of their Forces against the <HI>Persians,</HI> maintain'd
their Ground, and harass'd them, till at length
the Inundation of the <HI>Nile</HI> oblig'd them to quit
the Country. By these Means they lost the Pro∣spect
of taking <HI>Memphis,</HI> the Consequence where∣of
must have been the Reduction of the whole
Kingdom. Such was the Fate of most of the
<HI>Persian</HI> Expeditions, which were generally ill
concerted, and worse conducted, and were al∣ways
attended with Delays, which were chiefly
occasion'd by their Generals Hands being tied
up, so that, upon any sudden Emergency, they
often waited for Instructions from their Court, till
the Occasion was over. And this was alledg'd
by <HI>Pharnabazus</HI> in his Excuse to <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> who
expostulating with him upon the Operations of
the War, ask'd him, <HI>How it came to pass, that
he who was so quick in proposing his Measures,
was so slow in the Execution? Because,</HI> said he,
<HI>I am Master of my Words; but the King is Master
of my Actions.</HI> But this was not so much the
Case of the present Miscarriage, which was chiefly
<PB N="114" REF="140"/>
owing to the Misunderstanding between the two
Generals. However <HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> upon his Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn 
into <HI>Asia,</HI> threw the whole Blame of it upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Iphicrates,</HI> who did not think it proper there to
justify himself. He took warning from wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had lately happen'd to <HI>Conon</HI> under the like
Circumstances; and therefore withdrew himself
privately to <HI>Athens. Pharnabazus</HI> sent his Com∣plaint
after him; and the <HI>Athenians</HI> promis'd to
punish him, according as they should find he had
deserv'd it. But they found reason to be very
well satisfied with his Behaviour, and were so far
from censuring it, that soon after, as a Mark of
their Approbation, they appointed him Admiral.</P>
<P>In the mean time the several Cities of <HI>Greece,</HI>
especially those in <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> were no sooner
put into a Condition of enjoying that Liberty,
which was now more fully restor'd to them, but
they fell into Tumults and Seditions among
themselves, with such Resentment of former In∣juries
upon those who had acted under the <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
Administration, that they banish'd their Per∣sons,
and confiscated their Estates, and created
such further Disorders, that the two States of
<HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> sound themselves oblig'd to in∣terpose
in Behalf of those who were best affected
towards'em, and whose Quarrels they had formerly
espoused:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace broke again in G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rerce.</NOTE> And this occasion'd another Rupture
the Year after the Peace was concluded; tho' it
was not so general a one as before, nor of so long
Continuance.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="141"/>
The first Contests were concerning <HI>Zacynthus</HI>
and <HI>Corcyra;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commotions at <HI>Zacyn∣thus</HI> and <HI>Corcyra.</HI></NOTE> which were occasion'd chiefly by
the <HI>Spartan</HI> Faction. In the former of these
Places, the People had expell'd their Magistrates;
who flying to <HI>Timotheus</HI> for Protection, he re∣ceiv'd
them on board his Fleet, and transported
them back to the Island; where, by his further
Assistance, they got Possession of a strong Castle,
and maintain'd themselves against the Inhabitants.
The like Divisions subsisting in <HI>Corcyra,</HI> the
<HI>Spartans</HI> sent out <HI>Mnasippus</HI> with a Fleet, under
colour of assisting their Friends there. But they
knew of what Importance that Island was to the
Recovery of their Dominion at Sea; and their
true Design was to secure it to themselves. The
Fraud being detected, the Inhabitants in general
united against them as their common Enemy, and
put themselves under the Protection of <HI>Athens.</HI>
But before they could receive any Relief from
thence, the <HI>Spartans</HI> had landed upon them, and
besieged them. And when they found them∣selves
straiten'd for want of Provisions, they made
a desperate sally, wherein they kill'd <HI>Mnasippus,</HI>
with a good Number of his Men. At length
<HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI> coming up with the <HI>A∣thenian</HI>
Fleet, took nine of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Gallies,
and put an end to these Commotions.</P>
<P>About the same time the Inhabitants of <HI>Plataêa</HI>
applying to their old Friends the <HI>Athenians,</HI> for
their Protection and Alliance, the <HI>Thebans</HI> took
Offence at it, and demolish'd the Town; and
<PB N="116" REF="142"/>
soon after did the same by <HI>Thespiae.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> de∣molish <HI>Pla∣taea</HI> and <HI>Thespiae.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he∣nians</HI>
were so highly incens'd at the Treatment of
those two Cities, which had deserv'd so well of
the common Cause in the <HI>Persian</HI> War, that they
would act no longer in Conjunction with them;
and upon their breaking with them, the Affairs
of <HI>Greece</HI> took a new and unexpected Turn.</P>
<P><HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> began now to think in
earnest of enjoying some Repose themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> incline to Peace.</NOTE> and
of giving it to the lesser States, whose Quarrels
had been promoted chiefly by them, and made
subservient to their Views of obtaining the Sove∣reignty
of <HI>Greece.</HI> This was undoubtedly the
true Grounds of their Enmity, tho' several other
pretended Causes were asign'd; of which the
most plausible was, the settling the other Cities
and Republicks in a State of Freedom and Inde∣pendency.
This was now in some measure ef∣fected;
and the <HI>Spartans</HI> having been forc'd to
give up a great Part of the Power they had un∣justly
obtain'd, the <HI>Athenians</HI> contented themselves
with this Mark of their Submission, especially
since they had recover'd a great Part of what
they had lost at Sea; which had brought things
to a pretty equal Balance. The Truth is, they
had been at almost all the Charge and Hazard of
the War, exclusive of their Allies; so that not∣withstanding
they had been successful in the main,
they had been sufficiently drain'd and harass'd,
and were therefore glad of so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avourable a Con∣juncture,
to renew the former Treaty. There
<PB N="117" REF="143"/>
being at the same time nothing to apprehend on
the Side of <HI>Asia,</HI> where <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was deeply
engag'd in his <HI>Aegyptian</HI> War, there was a ge∣neral
Disposition for Peace, and the Negotiations
were carried on successfully by the <HI>Athenians;</HI>
but it was rejected by the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> aver se to it.</NOTE> and in such a
manner, as plainly shew'd they were now setting
up for themselves, and would no longer be con∣sider'd
as a subordinate State.</P>
<P>They were naturally an hardy and robust Peo∣ple,
but had the Character of being heavy and
stupid, even to a Proverb: And yet such Gene∣rals
as <HI>Epaminondas</HI> and <HI>Pelopides,</HI> and such Wri∣ters
as <HI>Pindar</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> one would think,
should have vindicated them from that Reproach.
However it is certain, they had not hitherto ex∣erted
themselves in any Degree suitable to the
Fame of their Heroes and Founders, who by
their Exploits, partly Fabulous, and partly His∣torical,
had given a Promise of what might be
expected from their Descendants, especially in a
City of so great Antiquity and Renown, as to
have maintain'd a Siege, even before that of
<HI>Troy.</HI> But they were far from answering these
Expectations. The <HI>Thebans</HI> were divided in In∣terest
from the <HI>Boeotians</HI> during the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars;
which is assign'd as one Reason, why they were
so long kept under: They basely deserted the
common Cause of <HI>Greece</HI> at that Time, to join
with the <HI>Barbarians:</HI> And when, contrary to all
human Probability, that numerous Army was
<PB N="118" REF="144"/>
defeated, they apprehended the Power and Re∣sentment
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who, as being their
Neighbours, might, under a Pretence of punish∣ing
their Treachery, possess themselves of their
Country. This Necessity threw them under the
Protection of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who chose rather to
forgive the Friends of <HI>Persia,</HI> than sacrifice the
Enemies of <HI>Athens;</HI> and accordingly enter'd into
a League with them. The <HI>Thebans</HI> were not un∣grateful;
they did them very great Service in the
<HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War, and continu'd, during the
whole Course of it, their good and faithful
Allies. Upon what Occasion they afterwards
broke with them, and were thereupon oblig'd
to have Recourse to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> has already
been related. It was a constant Maxim with
them, as they were deserted by one of those two
States, to fall in with the other; and which Side
soever they inclin'd to, they were generally of
Weight enough to turn the Balance: However
they had hitherto made no further use of that
Weight, than to secure themselves. But they
had been so constantly engag'd of late Years on
one Side or the other, according to the Exigencies
of their Affairs, that it had brought them into
Discipline, and fir'd their Ambition; and the
<HI>Spartans</HI> had principally contributed to it, by
their late srequent Expeditions against them. It
was an establish'd Point of Policy in the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Government, to avoid engaging too often with
the same Enemy, for fear of instructing them in
<PB N="119" REF="145"/>
the Art of War: And <HI>Lycurgus</HI> had, for the
same Reason, expresly forbid it by his Laws.
But the Resentment of <HI>Agesilaus</HI> against the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
carried him on beyond any Consideration of
that kind; insomuch that finding his Colleague
<HI>Cleombrotus</HI> averse to the <HI>Theban</HI> War, he lead
the Army himself, notwithstanding that he had
before claim'd the Privilege of his Age to excuse
his Attendance: And an Action happening,
wherein he was wounded, <HI>Antalcidas</HI> reproach'd
him, <HI>That he was well requited by the</HI> Thebans,
<HI>for having taught them to fight.</HI> In short, they
began now to look about them, and enlarge their
Views; and finding themselves too much cramp'd
up within their ancient Limits, they laid hold of
the present Conjuncture, to extend their Domi∣nion,
beginning, as the other States had done,
by little Encroachments on their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The Spirit which now appear'd among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are encourag'd by <HI>Pelopi∣das</HI> and <HI>E∣paminon∣das.</HI></NOTE> 
had been rais'd by <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> their late Deliverer
from the <HI>Spartan</HI> Yoke, and was seconded and
supported by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who, tho' he had all the
Qualities necessary for the Service of the Publick,
yet chose to lead a private Life, in a constant
Course of Virtue, and the Study of Philosophy.
He had seldom appear'd in publick, but in order
to get himself excus'd from those Employments,
which were so eagerly courted by others. But
his extraordinary Merit no longer suffering him
to enjoy his Retirement, he was forc'd out of it,
and plac'd at the Head of the <HI>Theban</HI> Army.
<PB N="120" REF="146"/>
He had before this contracted an Intimacy with
<HI>Pelopidas,</HI> which was daily improv'd by the Cor∣respondence
of their Tempers and Principles, and
the ardent Zeal, which they both express'd, for the
Good of their Country. And they had upon
some Occasions before this Time appear'd toge∣ther
in Action: But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> having made a
more early Figure in the Army, the Success,
which the <HI>Thebans</HI> had hitherto met with, was
generally ascrib'd to him: However <HI>Epaminondas</HI>
had done enough to distinguish himself; and
they both now came to be consider'd in the same
Light, as Generals abroad, and as Governors at
home.</P>
<P>When the Treaty propos'd by the <HI>Athenians</HI>
was upon the Point of being executed, the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
demanded to be comprehended in it, under
the Name of the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> and to be expresly
stiled so. But the other contracting Powers
would not agree to it: <HI>Agesilaus</HI> particularly in∣sisted
upon their leaving <HI>Boeotia</HI> free and inde∣pendent.
He was answer'd by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI>
who was there as Ambassador on the Part of
the <HI>Thebans, That they, the</HI> Spartans <HI>would do
well to shew them the Example, by setting free the
Country of</HI> Laconia; <HI>for that the Pretensions of
the City of</HI> Thebes <HI>to the one, were as well founded,
as those of the City of</HI> Sparta, <HI>to the other.</HI> He
urg'd farther, not only in Behalf of the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
but of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, <HI>That</HI> Sparta <HI>had aggran∣diz'd
herself by War, at the Expence of her Neigh∣bours;
<PB N="121" REF="147"/>
That Peace might be obtain'd, and such a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne as might be solid and lasting; but that it could
not be otherwise so, than by reducing all to an E∣quality.</HI>
These Remonstrances, however just they
were, yet so incens'd <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> that he struck
the Name of the <HI>Thebans</HI> out of the Treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Agesilaus</HI> declares War a∣gainst the Thebans.</NOTE> and
declar'd War against them.</P>
<P>The entering into a War in this manner, was
thought, both by the <HI>Spartans</HI> and their Allies,
too hasty a Step; and when it was at last, and
with some Difficulty, decreed by the <HI>Ephori,</HI> it
was censur'd, as an Act more of Passion than
Judgment, and as owing to the particular Pique
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> had to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> on whose Account
he had been call'd out of <HI>Asia;</HI> and thereupon
he laid hold of all Opportunities of being re∣yeng'd
on them. However he took care at the
same time to conclude a Peace with the rest of
the <HI>Grecians;</HI> tho' it was couch'd in so loose and
general Terms, as if it were intended only to
serve the present Occasion, lest any of them should
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oin against him, and that he might afterwards
either observe, or break it, according as he should
find it most for his Purpose. This agrees with
what he said to the other Ambassadors upon his
dismissing them, <HI>That what could be amicably ad∣usted,
should; and that what was not otherwise to be
remedied, must be determin'd by the Sword, it being
too dissicult a Task to provide for every thing by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="148"/>
The <HI>Thebans</HI> were by this means left to them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves; and <HI>Cleombrotus</HI> lying then in <HI>Phocis</HI> wit
ten thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Ephori</HI> sent him Orders to march immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><HI>Cleombrotus</HI> in the mean time pursued h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

to a certain Victory. However, when he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>

<PB N="123" REF="149"/>
which they interpreted to portend ill Success to

repeated to them a Verse of <HI>Homer,</HI>
which implied,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>That there was one sure good
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men to those who fought for their Country.</HI>
One of these unlucky Auguries, was a sudden
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Clap of Thunder, which they look'd up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
as a Warning from Heav'n, and address'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves to their General, to know his Senti∣Ments
upon it. But he being more attentive
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Incampment of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Army, than
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Thunder, gave them no other Answer,

However, to prevent any further Ef∣fets
of this Superstition, or Fear, which was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong the Troops, he found it necessary to hu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our
them a little, and to take them in their own
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay. Accordingly he invented other Counter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mens
and Auguries, and made use of old

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oint in Debate, was among the Generals,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hether they should act defensively, or march

With this View, he strengthen'd his Wing w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

of <HI>Cleombrotus.</HI> Having drawn off so ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="125" REF="151"/>
from his other Wing, he order'd those who re∣main'd
in it, to fall back in a slanting Line,
as if they declin'd fighting, and were making
their Retreat; which he did, that they might
not be left too much expos'd, and that they might
cover his Flank on the Right, and be a Body
of Reserve to him in case of need.</P>
<P>He then advanc'd with his Wing, extending
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t obliquely, in order to draw off the Right
Wing of the <HI>Spartans</HI> from their main Body.
The Enemy perceiving his Design, chang'd
their Order of Battle, and began to extend their
Wing likewise, with an Intent to surround <HI>Epa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nondas.</HI>
But before they could open and close
their Divisions, he took advantage of their form∣ing
themselves, and began the Attack with the
Horse: And <HI>Pelopidas</HI> charging with him at
the same time, with incredible Speed and Bra∣very
at the Head of his <HI>Battalion,</HI> they follow'd
she Horse, and press'd so hard upon the <HI>Spar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans,</HI>
that tho' they were of all the <HI>Grecians,</HI>
the most expert in recovering any Surprise or
Disorder of that Kind, their Skill was now quite
passed. Their Horse being not able to stand
the Shock, were forc'd back upon their Infan∣try,
which, by this means, was broke, and
thrown into a good deal of Confusion. The
<HI>Thebans</HI> having made this Impression with their
Horse, push'd on to <HI>Cleombrotus,</HI> and open'd
their Way to him with great Slaughter; not∣withstanding
that the <HI>Spartans</HI> fought with their

he was kill'd, the Fight was renew'd with great∣er

Death, and to recover his Body. This la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was a point of Honour with the <HI>Spartan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
which they could not for shame give up; and
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> chose rather to gratify them in it
than to hazard the further Success of the Battle
Wherefore he left them in possession of their
dead King, and went on to their other Wing
which was commanded by <HI>Archidamus,</HI> and con∣sisted
chiefly of the Allies, who had not willing∣ly 
been engaged in this Quarrel, but were the
more easily persuaded to it from the Weak∣ness
of the <HI>Thebans;</HI> so that they thought they
had little more to do, than to take the Field,
and that they were to conquer without fight∣ing,
or, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> expresses it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> without Dust.
But they were so dishearten'd at the Death
of <HI>Cleombrotus,</HI> and the Defeat of his Wing,
that they soon betook themselves to Flight, and
were follow'd by the rest of the Army. <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣minondas</HI>
pursued them with great Slaughter,
'till having compleated his Victory, he remain'd
Master of the Field, and erected a Trophy.
There fell in the Battle four Thousand on the Side
of <HI>Sparta,</HI> whereof one Thousand were <HI>Laceda∣monians,</HI><PB N="127" REF="153"/> and the Flower of their Army; and
four Hundred of them were Citizens of <HI>Sparta.</HI>
The <HI>Thebans</HI> lost in the whole but three Hun∣dred
Men.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> had succeeded in every Part of
this Action, according to his Wish, and ac∣cording
to the manner in which he had pro∣jected
it. His Skill and Conduct in this Battle,
and in that which succeeded it at <HI>Manitinea,</HI> are
look'd upon as Master-pieces in their kind: And
they who are curious that way, may see the
exact Plans of them, as they are describ'd by
a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Chevalier de Folard.</NOTE> late Author in his Comments upon <HI>Poly∣bius.</HI></P>
<P>This Battle was fought within twenty Days
after the Conclusion of the Peace. And as it
was the sharpest of any that had happen'd du∣ring
the Wars of the <HI>Grecians</HI> among them∣selves,
so it was more remarkable for the Num∣ber
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slain; there having seldom been above
four or five hundred kill'd on the Side of the
vanquish'd, even in the Height of the Rivalship
between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> when they fought
with the most Rancour and Inveteracy. The
<HI>Thebans</HI> acquir'd more Glory by it, than any
of the Republicks had ever gain'd by any single
Victory in those Wars: And <HI>Epaminondas</HI> felt
such a sudden Excess of Joy upon it, that he
went out of his usual Character, and was hard∣ly
able to contain himself. But the next Day,
upon cooler Thoughts, he resum'd the Philo∣sopher;
<PB N="128" REF="154"/>
and appear'd so pensive and melancho∣ly,
that his Friends were very inquisitive to
know the Cause of it. He told them, <HI>He had
suffered himself to be too much transported upon
his Victory, and that he was now undergoing a
proper Chastisement for it.</HI> But his Command
of himself upon this Occasion, did not come up
to that of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> whose Behaviour after
the Battle, was so remarkably great, that I que∣stion
whether it can be parallel'd in the History
of any Age, or Country.</P>
<P>If happen'd, that when the News of the Defeat
came to <HI>Sparta,</HI> they were celebrating a Publick
Festival in the City, where there was a great Con∣course
of Strangers from several Parts of <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beha∣viour of the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI> after their De∣feat.</NOTE>
The <HI>Ephori,</HI> who from the Accounts they had al∣ready
received of the Battle, could not but be
sensible of the terrible Consequences of it, yet gave
Orders, that the Solemnity of the Day should not
be interrupted; but privately sending the Names
of the slain to each Family, out of which they
were lost, they went on with the Sports and
Ceremonies, as if nothing had happen'd. The
next Morning, when they were more fully in∣formed
of the Particulars, the Fathers and Re∣lations
of the slain came out rejoicing in the
Market-place, and saluting each other with a
kind of Exultation: On the contrary, the Fa∣thers
of those who survived the Battle, conceal'd
themselves in their Houses; and if any of them
were, upon any necessary Occasion, obliged to
<PB N="129" REF="155"/>
go abroad, it was easily discover'd by their
Looks, that they were asham'd to own their
Children. The Women carried it still further,
the Mothers of the slain openly rejoicing, chear∣fully
making Visits to each other, and assemb∣ling
in a triumphant manner in the Temples;
whilst they who expected their Children home,
sat silent and dejected.</P>
<P>But the Generality of the People were a∣waken'd
by this Misfortune, and consider'd it
as a Blow, that they should never be able to
recover. They began to despair, when they
found themselves without Troops, deserted by
their Allies, and, in a manner, at the Mercy
of the Conqueror; especially when they were
further informed, that he design'd to invade <HI>Pe∣loponnesus.</HI>
This occasion'd a general Murmu∣ring
and Repining: It brought to their Re∣membrance
the former Predictions of the Oracle,
<HI>That they should suffer under a lame King.</HI> They
consider'd further, that they had given the
Crown to this lame King, in prejudice to the
Right of <HI>Leotychidas</HI> his Nephew. But notwith∣standing
these Reflections, and that he had un∣doubtedly
been the sole Author of their present
Calamity, he had still so much Credit with
them, that they renew'd the Confidence they
they had formerly placed in him, and submitted
their Affairs entirely to his Determination, ei∣ther
as to Peace or War.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="156"/>
One great Point under their immediate Con∣sideration,
was concerning those who had fled
out of the Battle. They were by the Law in
that cafe, to be degraded from all Honours,
and render'd infamous, insomuch that it was a
Disgrace to intermarry with them: They were
to appear publickly in mean and dirty Habits,
with patch'd and party-colour'd Garments, and
to go half-shav'd; and whoever met them in
the Streets, might insult and beat them, and
they were not to make any Resistance. This
was so severe a Law, and such Numbers had
incurr'd the Penalties of it, many of whom
were of great Families and Interest, that they
apprehended the Execution of it might occasion
some publick Commotions; besides that these
Citizens, such as they were, could very ill be
spared at this time, when they wanted to re∣cruit
the Army. Under this Difficulty, they
gave <HI>Agesilaus</HI> a Power even over the Laws,
to dispense with them, or to abrogate them,
or to enact such new ones, as the present Exi∣gency
required. He would not abolish, or make
any Variation in the Law itself, but made a
publick Declarntion, That it should lie dormant
for that single Day, but revive and be in full
Force again on the morrow; and by that Ex∣pedient
he saved the Citizens from Infamy.</P>

<P>THE Fugitives being thus re-instated in the
Army, <HI>Agesilaus</HI> made an Inroad into <HI>Ar∣cadia,</HI>
where he took a small Town belonging
to the <HI>Mantineans,</HI> and wasted the Territory,
but avoided engaging in any hazardous Enter∣prise,
doing no more at present, than what was
barely necessary to keep his Men in Action,
and to revive their Spirits, and at the same
time to shew, that the Fortune of <HI>Sparta</HI> was
not quite desperate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> in the mean time were endea∣vouring
to improve their Victory; and sent an
Herald crown'd with a Garland, to communi∣cate
it in Form to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and to de∣mand
their Assistance. But they did not think
this a Time to break with <HI>Sparta;</HI> they found
it a fit Opportunity to make themselves more ab∣solutely
Masters at Sea; and if they could not
carry it further, so as to obtain the Sovereign∣ty
of <HI>Greece;</HI> at least they thought it better
to share in it with <HI>Sparta,</HI> than to endanger
the letting the '<HI>Thebans</HI> into the whole: Upon
<PB N="132" REF="158"/>
which Considerations they dismiss'd the Herald
without giving him Audience.</P>
<P>With these Views,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 102. 3. The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI> take advanta a of this O∣verthrow of the <HI>Spartans.</HI></NOTE> they gave the <HI>Spartans</HI>
to understand, That, as they had lost their Power,
it was expected, they should lay aside their
Haughtiness and Severity. At the same time
they took upon themselves to maintain the Peace,
which, by the Deputies of the several Cities as∣sembled
at <HI>Athens,</HI> they caused to be renew'd and
retified, in the Name of them, and their Con∣federates.
The <HI>Thebans</HI> stood out as before; and
the <HI>Eleans</HI> now followed their Example, object∣ing
against the Freedom of several Towns, which
they pretended to be immediately under their
Jurisdiction. And several other States afterwards
fell in with the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several States side with the <HI>Thebans.</HI></NOTE> some by Compulsion,
and more out of Inclination and Policy, as they
found they were most likely to be protected
by them. <HI>Thebes</HI> was now become the common
<HI>Asylum</HI> for those who apprehended the Power
of their Neighbours, and more particularly of
the <HI>Spartans.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mantineans</HI> about this time took occasi∣on
to rebuild their City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Man∣tineans</HI> re∣build their City.</NOTE> which, with the As∣sistance
of the <HI>Eleans,</HI> and some Part of the
<HI>Arcadians,</HI> they perfected, and wall'd in, as
before. And, according to <HI>Pausanias,</HI> the <HI>Ar∣cadians</HI>
in general, by the Persuasion of <HI>Epami∣nondas,</HI>
out of several small Towns, built one
common City by the Name of <HI>Megalopolis;</HI>
tho' <HI>Diodorus</HI> places it two years lower, upon
<PB N="133" REF="159"/>
their great Overthrow by the <HI>Spartans.</HI> Thus
far the <HI>Arcadians</HI> had made a right and reasona∣ble
use of <HI>Sparta</HI>'s being humbled: But they,
and some other States, when they found them∣selves
restored, according to the Treaty, to
the free Enjoyment of their own Laws, and
Forms of Government, grew wanton and ca∣pricious,
and fell into such Dissensions among
themselves, as prov'd of worse Consequence to
them, than the Dominion of <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Case of the <HI>Tegeans,</HI> who had
form'd a Scheme of uniting themselves, with
all the rest of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commoti∣ons in <HI>Ar∣cadia.</HI></NOTE> into one Body
of a Common-wealth, with a General Council,
consisting of ten Thousand; in whom there
was to be lodg'd an absolute Power, to deter∣mine
all Matters relating to Peace and War.
But this Project occasion'd such Factions and
Tumults among them, that great Numbers
were kill'd, and above fourteen Hundred ba∣nish'd;
and it ended in bringing the <HI>Spartans</HI>
again upon them, under the old Pretence of
restoring Exiles, and in making their Country
a Seat of War.</P>
<P><HI>Agesilaus</HI> immediately took occasion from these
intestine Divisions, to send a Body of fifteen
Hundred Men among them under the Com∣mand
of <HI>Polytropus.</HI> He possess'd himself of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was another City of this Name in Boeotia.</NOTE> <HI>Orchomenus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Battle at Orcho∣menus.</NOTE> which was well affected to <HI>Sparta,</HI>
and garrison'd it. <HI>Lycomedes</HI> the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Ge∣neral
<PB N="134" REF="160"/>
being about three to one stronger, march'd
up to him, and offer'd him Battle under the
Walls. <HI>Polytropus</HI> accepted it, and was kill'd,
with two hundred of his Men; and the rest
were forc'd back into the City. However <HI>Ly∣comedes,</HI>
not doubting but the <HI>Spartans</HI> would
come with a greater FoRce to revenge them∣selves,
did not think it adviseable to pursue
his Victory without some further Assistance.
Accordingly he applied to the <HI>Athenians;</HI> but
they refus'd to join with him, concluding, as
they had done before, with regard to the <HI>The∣bans,</HI>
that <HI>Sparta</HI> was low enough already, and
that it would be wrong Policy in them at this
time to support any other State against her.
Hereupon the <HI>Arcadians</HI> had recourse to the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> who receiv'd them with open Arms;
and this was a great Addition to the Confe∣deracy,
that was forming against <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>About the Time of the civil Discord among
the <HI>Arcadians</HI> concerning their new Form of
Government, there happen'd a more grievous
Instance of the same kind at <HI>Argos;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition at <HI>Argos.</HI></NOTE> where the
Government being in the People, the Orators,
or Demagogues, (as they were more properly
call'd) ftirt'd them up against the Nobility,
who, to secure themselves against the Insults
and Outrages to which they were expos'd, en∣ter'd
into Conspiracy to destroy the <HI>Democra∣cy.</HI>
Which being suspected by the Commons,
they put several to the Rack, and extorted
<PB N="135" REF="161"/>
from them a Confession of the whole Design.
Whereupon they murther'd Thirty of those
who were principally concern'd, without any
Form of Trial: And many false Accusations
against others, were dress'd up and aggravated
by these Orators; insomuch that there were
above sixteen hundred of the greatest and rich∣est
Men of the City executed, and their Estates
confiscated. At length the Orators, whether
they were struck with Remorse for the Cruel∣ties
they had oceasion'd, or that they were a∣fraid
of being at last involv'd in the general
Ruin, began to slacken in their Prosecutions;
and the People from thence concluding, that
they had deserted their Cause, murther'd such of
them as they could find remaining in the City.
This was the greatest Massacre that had hap∣pen'd
in any City of <HI>Greece;</HI> and it was di∣stinguished
by the Name of <HI>The Seytalism,</HI> from
the manner in which it was executed, by the
knocking on the Head with Clubs. And this
Sedition was a very unlucky Conjuncture for
that City, which was so rich and powerful,
that she was in a Condition to dispute the
Sovereignty of <HI>Greece.</HI> This Opinion was con∣firm'd
by <HI>Jason,</HI> who putting in his Claim
to it in behalf of the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> made use
of it as an Argument to them, that the <HI>Ar∣gives</HI>
were too much weaken'd with their in∣testine
Broils, to appear as Competitors.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="162"/>
This <HI>Jason</HI> had a little Principality at <HI>Pherae;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of <HI>Jason</HI> of Thessaly.</NOTE> 
and having ambitious Views, and extraordinary
Skill in Military Affairs, got himself to be de∣claR'd
General of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> with which Authority
he had gain'd many of the neighbouring Coun∣tries
into his Alliance; and the <HI>Thebans</HI> courted
him for his Assistance, when they found them∣selves
disappointed of it at <HI>Athens.</HI> He appear'd
ready to join them with a good Body of Troops;
but when it came to the Point, he diverted them
from pursuing their Victory, advising them to
use it with Moderation, and not to make the
<HI>Spartans</HI> desperate. The <HI>Spartans,</HI> on the other
hand, he persuaded to lie by a little, till they
had recover'd Breath, and could fight upon more
advantageous Temrs: So that he acted rather as
a Mediator, than an Ally; and there is Mention
made of a Truce concluded between them by
his Means; but the Account of it is so differently
related, that it does not appear, whether it were
before, or after the Battle of <HI>Leuctra. Jason's</HI>
Business was to manage so between those States,
that neither of them might grow too powerful,
and that he might make his Advantage of it in
bringing about his own Designs; which, by his
Mony, Art and Eloquence, he had in some mea∣sure
effected. But notwithstanding that he was
eager in the Pursuit of his Ambition, he endea∣vour'd
to save Appearances, and to preserve a
good Character; so that when he had injur'd or
molested any of his Neighbours, he would say,
<PB N="137" REF="163"/>
by way of Excuse, <HI>There is a Necessity for those
to be unjust in small Matters, who will act justly in
great Ones.</HI> He was at the Head of an Army of
ten thousand Horse, and twenty thousand heavy∣arm'd
Foot, without reckoning the light-arm'd
Soldiers: And with this Force, he might soon
have been capable of giving Law to the rest of
<HI>Greece.</HI> But before he could make any Attempt
towards it, he was suddenly assassinated at the
Instigation of his Brothers <HI>Polydore</HI> and <HI>Polyphron,</HI>
who jointly succeeded him: But the latter kill'd
the other, and was soon after kill'd himself by
his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some make him his Brother.</NOTE> Nephew <HI>Alexander,</HI> under the Pretence of
revenging the Death of his Father <HI>Polydore.</HI> By
this Means <HI>Alexander</HI> possess'd himself of <HI>Pherae,</HI>
and became very oppressive and tyrannical. But
as I shall have occasion to mention him more par∣ticularly,
I would here only observe, that from
the Time of <HI>Jason's</HI> Death, the <HI>Thessalians</HI> lost
the Influence they had in the Affairs of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and the Prospect of obtaining the Sovereignty of
it in their turn.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> in the mean time having, besides
the late Accession of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> got the <HI>Pho∣cians,
Locrians, Acarnanians, Euboeans,</HI> and other
neighbouring States, under their Dependence,
were preparing to act offensively against the
<HI>Spartans;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 102. 4. The <HI>Thebans</HI> act off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsiverly against <HI>Sparta.</HI></NOTE> and, under a Notion of assisting the

<PB N="138" REF="164"/>

forty, some say, fifty thousand Men, besides grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Numbers who follow'd the Camp for Plunde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
amounting, in the whole, to seventy thousand
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> having the Command
of the Army, divided it into four Bodies, who
broke into <HI>Laconia</HI> at four several Parts of it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the same Time; then made a general Rendezvou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
at <HI>Sellasia,</HI> and pursu'd their March with Fire an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Sword towards <HI>Sparta. Agesilous</HI> was at this time
in pursuit of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> after the Defeat of
<HI>Polytropus:</HI> But upon this Approach of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<HI>Thebans,</HI> he immediately return'd to <HI>Sparta,</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
where he found the Inhabitants under the utmost
Terror and Consternation; and the more so, be∣cause
no Enemy had appear'd there in the Course
of near six hundred Years, since the <HI>Dorians,</HI> as
Descendants of <HI>Hercules,</HI> first got Possession of
the Country. Hence it was, that <HI>Plato</HI> said, <HI>The
City of</HI> Sparta <HI>was like the</HI> Temple of the Furies,
<HI>which Nobody bad Courage enough to approach.</HI>
And it was a frequent Saying of <HI>Agesilaus him∣self,
That the Women of</HI> Sparta <HI>had never seen the
Smoke of the Enemies Fire;</HI> which was now re∣torted
upon him. There was another Saying of
<HI>Antalicidas</HI> to the same Purpose, who being in
Dispute with an <HI>Athenian</HI> about the Valour of the
two nations, the <HI>Athenian</HI> bragg'd, <HI>That his

never had Occasion to drive you from the Euro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="165"/>
But this was not the Case at present: For <HI>Epa∣minondas,</HI>
at the Head of his Infantry, pass'd
that River, tho' it was then swell'd to an unusual
Heighth, and tho' the <HI>Spartans</HI> taking that Op∣portunity
to fall upon him, cut off a good Num∣ber
of his Men. However he made good his
Passage, and march'd up to the Suburbs of the
City; where the Inhabitants were, with great
Difficulty, restrain'd from rushing out in a con∣fus'd
and desperate manner upon the Enemy.
But <HI>Agesilaus</HI> upon this Occasion shew'd more
Temper than ordinary; he found it necessary to
lay aside his Pride and Obstinacy, and to play a
saving Game. He endeavour'd to quiet the
Minds of the People, so as to keep them within
their Bounds, and made the best Disposition he
could of them, for the Defence of the City.
It was thought proper in this Extrernity to pro∣claim,
That as many of the <HI>Helots,</HI> as would en∣lift,
and form themselves into Companies, should
receive their Freedom; and a thousand of them
accepted the Offer; <HI>Xenophon</HI> says, six thousand;
which is not very improbable from the Circum∣stance
he adds, that when they were arm'd in a
Body, they made so formidable an Appearance,
that the <HI>Spartans</HI> themselves durst not trust them,
without placing a good Number of Mercenaries
and other Troops, as a Guard upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> being thus far advanc'd, made a
sort of Encampment near the City, and endea∣vour'd
to draw the <HI>Spartans</HI> out of it, in order to a
<PB N="140" REF="166"/>
pitch'd Battle: But <HI>Agesilaus</HI> had retir'd to an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
minence in the Heart of the Town, and intended
nothing more than the Defence of it. Hereupon
they resolv'd to attack it, and endeavour'd to tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
it by Storm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And attempt to take the City by Storm.</NOTE> but they found the Avenues so wel
secured, that they met with more Difficulty that
they expected. When at length they made at
Irruption with their Horse, the <HI>Spartan</HI> Horse
oppos'd them; and a Party of three hundred
Foot, who lay in Ambuscade, sallying out upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them at the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But are repuls'd.</NOTE> they were repuls'd with
considerable Loss, and discourag'd from making
a second Attempt. They contented themselves
with encamping again without the City, where
they bid Defiance to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and challeng'd
them to come out, and give them Battle; to
which they return'd a very cool Answer, <HI>That
they would not decline it, when they saw a prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Occasion.</HI> Then they reproach'd <HI>Agesilaus</HI> by
Name, as the Incendiary of the War, and the
Author of all the Mischief done to his Country.
But he resolv'd not to be provok'd; he over∣look'd
all these personal Insults and Reflections,
as the Effects of Rage and Disappointment, and
would not suffer himself to be diverted from the
only Point he had then in view, which was the
Security of the City; and the Preservation of it
at this Time, was no less owing to this Com∣mand
of himself, than to his good Conduct in
other Respects.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="167"/>
The Behaviour of Ischolas the <HI>Spartan</HI> upon
this Occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Behaviour of <HI>Ischolas.</HI></NOTE> deserves particular Notice. He
commanded one of the Detachments which were
order'd out to secure the most important Passes;
but finding it too weak to stand the Attack of
the Enemy, he pick'd out the youngest of the
Men, and sent them back as a Reserve for the
future Service of their Country; and with the
rest, devoting himself, after the Example of <HI>Leo∣nidas,</HI>
to the publick Good, he made a long and
obstinate Defence, and fought till they were all
kill'd to a Man. The <HI>Thebans</HI> proposing nothing
further to themselves there, decamp'd; and, after
having plunder'd and laid waste all the Country,
return'd into <HI>Arcadia.</HI></P>
<P>This Expedition had not answer'd the great
Preparations that were made for it:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epami∣nondas</HI> re∣soures the Messenians</NOTE> But <HI>Epami∣nondas,</HI>
to make it the more memorable, pro∣pos'd
the restoring the Posterity of the old <HI>Mes∣seniens,</HI>
who had near three hundred Years be∣fore
been driven out by the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and were
settled in <HI>Sicily, Italy,</HI> and other Parts; where
they retain'd their ancient Customs and Man∣ners,
and the <HI>Dorick</HI> Dialect. By a general Con∣sent
of his Allies, he invited them home to their
native Country; and their City was immediately
rebuilt and peopled; so that in a few Months it
recover'd its former State and Grandeur; and a
strong Garrison was lest for its Defence. The
Territory was likewise divided by Lot among
the new Inhabitants. The re-settling a People
<PB N="142" REF="168"/>
who had made so considerable a Figure in to
early Times of <HI>Greece,</HI> did highly redound to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Honour of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> and was a fresh Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>grace
to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> for having tamely suffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the Loss of a Country of as large Extent as the
own, and the most fertile of any in <HI>Greece;</HI> besides
that they had been so long in Possession
of it, and held it as a Barrier against any Inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion 
on that Side: And <HI>Agesilaus</HI> was so piqu'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it, that he made it the Grounds of continuing
the War with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> when they offer'd him
Peace; and the Consequence of his Refusal was
that it very near occasion'd the Loss of <HI>Spark</HI>
itself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans,</HI> in their Return home, met with
some Opposition from <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> who had been
sent with twelve thousand <HI>Athenians,</HI> to assist the
<HI>Spartans</HI> in their Extremity; but having loiter'd
at <HI>Corinth,</HI> he did not come up till the Business
was over: And afterwards he omitted to secure
an important Pass call'd <HI>Cenchreae,</HI> which would
have given them a great deal of Disturbance
in their Retreat. His Conduct throughout in
this Affair was blam'd; which was the more re∣markable
in him, because he never misbehav'd
upon any other Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> and <HI>Pelopidas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epami∣nondas</HI> and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> imprison'd at their Return.</NOTE> at their Return to
<HI>Thebes,</HI> instead of receiving the Acknowledge∣ments
due to their Services, were clap'd up as
State Prisoners, for having continu'd in their
Command four Months longer than the Time
<PB N="143" REF="169"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dimited by Law, which took in almost the Whole
of this Expedition, from their first Entrance into
<HI>Peloponnesus:</HI> And as the Crime was Capital, they
were tried for it. They had nothing to alledge
in their Excuse for so manifest a Violation of the
Law, but the Advantages they had obtain'd for
their Country; so that they confess'd the Charge,
and submitted themselves to their Judges. Their
Enemies had used great Art and Industry to in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cense
the People against them: Which <HI>Epami∣nondas</HI>
perceiving, and that they were ready to
pass Sentence of Death against him, reminded
them of the Battle of <HI>Leuctra,</HI> and his other Ex∣ploits,
by which he had saved his Country, and
restor'd the Liberty of <HI>Greece:</HI> And he made it
his Request to have it inscrib'd upon his Tomb∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stone,
<HI>That for those Services he was punish'd with
Death.</HI> This manner of reproaching them had
so good an Effect, that they were asham'd to
proceed any further against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are tried and acquitted.</NOTE> and he was ho∣nourably
acquitted; as was likewise <HI>Pelopidas,</HI>
who being of a warmer Temper, and spirited up
by his Friends, express'd his Resentment of this
Usage, and reveng'd himself upon <HI>Meneclides,</HI>
who was at the Bottom of this Prosecution, and
was a very able Speaker, but loose in his Man∣ners,
ill-natur'd, perverse and envious. he was
one of those who met at <HI>Charon</HI>'s House upon
the affair of the <HI>Cadmea;</HI> and not thinking
himself consider'd enough for his Share in that
<PB N="144" REF="170"/>
Enterprize, made it his Business, upon all Occa∣sions,
to accuse and calumniate his Superiors.
Even after the Trial, he prevail'd so far, as to
get <HI>Epaminondas</HI> excluded for a Year from the
Government of <HI>Boeotia:</HI> But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> being more
a Favourite with the People, he went another
way to work, and endeavour'd to supplant him,
by setting up <HI>Charon</HI> against him; which he
contriv'd in the following manner. There was a
famous Painter of <HI>Cyzicus</HI> employ'd at <HI>Thebes</HI> in
drawing a Battle, but was forc'd away by the
Revolt there, before he had put the last Hand
to it. However the Picture remaining in the
City, <HI>Meneclides</HI> propos'd the hanging it up in
some publick Place, with an Inscription to per∣petuate
the Memory of a Victory obtain'd by
<HI>Charon</HI> at <HI>Plataea,</HI> tho' it was in reality no
more than a Skirmish, wherein forty <HI>Spartan;</HI>
were kill'd. This Action happen'd a little be∣fore
the Battle of <HI>Leuctra;</HI> and the magnifying
it in this manner, was plainly with a Design to
eclipse the Glory of that Day, and to throw a Slurupon 
the two Generals who commanded. <HI>Pele∣pidas</HI>
therefore oppos'd the Motion; which yet
he did with great Art and Decency with regard
to <HI>Charon,</HI> to whom he gave all due Praise; but
at the same time he expos'd the Absurdity of the
Proposal, and the Malice and Impertinence of
the Author of it; which the People being sen∣sible
of, laid so heavy a Fine upon him, that
<PB N="145" REF="171"/>
he was not able to pay it; and from thence∣forward
he grew a common Disturber of the
Government.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> they had unex∣pectedly
got rid of a very formidable Enemy:
But the Terror and Confusion they had been in,
the Sense of the Losses they had sustain'd, and
their Apprehensions of what further might hap∣pen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals and Con∣spiracies in Sparta.</NOTE> had created a great deal of ill Blood a∣mong
them, and raised such a Spirit of mur∣muring,
and caballing against the Government,
that <HI>Agesilaus</HI> found it almost as difficult a Task
to manage the People in the City, as to keep
the Enemy out of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Means by which <HI>Agesilaus</HI> suppress'd them.</NOTE> There was an Instance
of this kind, wherein he shew'd extraordinary
Address, and Presence of Mind. Two hundred
Malecontents had got into a strong Part of the
Town, call'd <HI>Issorion,</HI> where they had seized
the Temple of <HI>Diana. Agesilaus</HI> would not
employ Force against them, not knowing
how deep the Plot might be laid, and how
far it might spread; but went muffled up
in his Cloak, with only one Servant; and be∣ing
come near the Rebels, call'd out, and told
them, <HI>You have mistaken my Orders; my Direc∣tions
were not that you should all go in a Body
to that Station, but some of you should plant
yourselves there, and others there;</HI> at the same
time pointing out to them different Parts of the
City. They went off accordingly, without the
least Suspicion, to the Places which he mark'd
<PB N="146" REF="172"/>
out to them; and immediately, upon their be∣ing
thus dispers'd, he order'd some of the
Troops to possess themselves of that Post, and
caused about fifteen of the Conspirators to be
apprehended; and they were put to death the
Night following. This Conspiracy was fol∣low'd
by another of more dangerous Conse∣quence,
wherein a great Number of the Citi∣zens
were engaged, and had private Consulta∣tions
every Night, how to introduce a Change
in the Government. They were so strong a
Party, that it was neither safe to prosecute them
publickly according to Law, nor to let them
go on, and connive at them. Wherefore <HI>Age∣silaus</HI>
took another course, and, with the Con∣sent
of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> put them to death private∣ly
without Process; which had never before been
practised in <HI>Sparta.</HI> But the present Exigency
of Affairs seem'd to make it necessary; for these
Seditions happen'd about the Time of the <HI>The∣ban</HI>
Expedition. And to add to the Conster∣nation
the City was then under, many of the
<HI>Helots</HI> and Mercenaries at the same time deserted
to the Enemy.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spartans</HI> having got over these do∣mestick
Difficulties, and repuls'd the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
began now to look abroad, and provide for
their future Security. They had got together
a good Body of Auxiliaries from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and
other Parts of <HI>Peloponnesus:</HI> But their chief De∣pendence
was on the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to whom they
<PB N="147" REF="173"/>
had formally given up the Command at Sea,
in order to fix them in their Interest; but they
were not so sanguine in it, as was expected;
so that what they did, was rather to keep the
<HI>Thebans</HI> under,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣mand di∣vided e∣qually be∣tween <HI>A∣thens</HI> and <HI>Sparta.</HI></NOTE> than to assist the <HI>Spartans.</HI> They
now insisted on being upon the same Foot∣ing
with them both at Sea and Land, which
they call'd, Treating upon equal Terms: And
since nothing less would content them, it was ac∣cordingly
agreed, that each State should com∣mand
five Days alternately.</P>
<P>This Agreement was no sooner made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arca∣dians</HI> re∣new the War.</NOTE> but the
<HI>Arcadians</HI> renew'd the War. They took <HI>Pallene</HI>
in <HI>Laconia</HI> by Storm, where they put above three
hundred <HI>Spartans</HI> in Garrison to the Sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 103. 1.</NOTE> and
ravag'd the Country. After which they were
join'd by the <HI>Argives</HI> and <HI>Eleans;</HI> and the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
sent <HI>Epaminodas</HI> again to them, with seven
thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> being now in earnest, sent <HI>Chabrias</HI> to
oppose his Passage. He join'd the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
with their Allies, at <HI>Corinth,</HI> where they made
up an Army of twenty thousand Men; to which
there was afterwards an Addition of two thou∣sand
from <HI>Sicily,</HI> who did good Service. <HI>Epa∣minondas</HI>
came up to force his Passage, as he had
done before, into <HI>Peloponnesus;</HI> but finding it
shut up with a Wall, and a deep Interechment
a-cross the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> as at the Time of the Inva∣sion
by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> he endeavour'd to draw the
Enemy out into the Field, which they declin'd,
<PB N="148" REF="174"/>
altho' they were near three times his number.
Whereupon he survey'd the Works, and finding
one Part, where the <HI>Spartans</HI> were posted, weaker
than the rest, he chose to make his main At∣tack
there;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epami∣nondas</HI> a∣gain in∣vades <HI>Pe∣loponnesus</HI></NOTE> which he did with such Resolution
and Bravery, that, after a very hot Dispute on
both Sides, he open'd the Passage, and harass'd the
Country. <HI>Sicyon,</HI> and some other Places having
submitted to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and as∣saults <HI>Co∣rinth.</HI></NOTE> he pursu'd his March to <HI>Co∣rinth;</HI>
where, after some skirmishing, he came
up with his whole Strength, and made so vigo∣rous
an Assault, that the Inhabitants were in the
utmost Despair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is re∣pulsed by <HI>Chabrias.</HI></NOTE> But <HI>Chabrias</HI> came out, and
stood the Shock, and by the Advantage of the
Ground, and the constant fresh Supplies which
he receiv'd from the City, repuls'd the Enemy
with great Loss; whereupon they not only re∣treated
from <HI>Corinth,</HI> but quitted <HI>Peloponnesus:</HI>
And the Honour of this Defence was almost en∣tirely
owing to <HI>Chabrias.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Epaminodas,</HI> by one Part of his Conduct in
this Expedition, incurr'd the Displeasure of the
State. For notwithstanding his Bravery in forcing
the Pass, that was defended by the <HI>Spartans,</HI> he
was suspected of Partiality towards them, for not
having pursu'd and slaughter'd them, when they
were judg'd to be in his Power. His Enemies
aggravating the Matter, and making it a Charge
of Treachery, got him turn'd out of the Go∣vernment
of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and reduc'd to the Condi∣tion
of a private Man. This Accusation was not
<PB N="149" REF="175"/>
thought to be well founded enough for so severe
a Censure: However an Occasion offer'd soon
after, wherein his Service was so seasonable, and
so important, that he easily wip'd off the Asper∣sion.</P>
<P>It
does not appear, what Effect the dividing
the Command between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> had
upon this Invasion; however it produc'd one
good Consequence, as it serv'd to weaken the
Confederacy against them. For it was now made
use of as a Precedent by the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> who were
grown so elated with their Successes, and put such
a Value upon their Services against <HI>Sparta,</HI> that
they disdain'd to act any longer in Subordination
to the <HI>Thebans.</HI> This Spirit was rais'd in them
by <HI>Lycomedes</HI> of <HI>Mantinea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arca∣dians</HI> spi∣rited up by <HI>Lycome∣des.</HI></NOTE> who had been their
General in most of their late Expeditions. He
was of great Birth and Fortune, and being am∣bitious
withal, represented to them, That the
whole Country of <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> belong'd properly
to them, as the first ancient Inhabitants; That
they were the most numerous of any People in
<HI>Greece,</HI> and so stout and powerful, that they had
always been consider'd in the first Rank of Auxi∣liaries;
insomuch that the <HI>Spartans</HI> had never
done any thing against <HI>Athens</HI> without them, nor
had the <HI>Thebans</HI> now appear'd against <HI>Sparta,</HI> if
they had not supported them: That as they had
formerly advanc'd the Affairs of the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
they were now doing the same for the <HI>Thebans;</HI>
and that in short, if they did not insist upon
<PB N="150" REF="176"/>
commanding in their Turn with them, they
might in the End find them <HI>Spartans</HI> too. He
had so inflam'd them with these Remonstrances,
and gain'd such an entire Credit with them, that
they easily agreed to every thing he propos'd;
and there was nothing so difficult that they were
not ready to undertake. This created a great
Coldness and Jealousy on the Part of the <HI>Thebans:</HI>
And the <HI>Eleans</HI> at the same time were inclin'd
to break with the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> for refusing to de∣liver
up to them some of their Towns, which
had been taken by the <HI>Spartans.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst these Disputes were on foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fresh Overtures of Peace.</NOTE> the King
of <HI>Persia</HI> sent to manage the Renewal of the
Peace among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> that they might be
able to spare him such Succours as he had occa∣sion
for. The chief Point in debate, was, the
restoring <HI>Messene</HI> to the <HI>Spartans;</HI> which the
<HI>Thebans</HI> not agreeing to, the Negotiations broke
off; and <HI>Philiscus</HI> of <HI>Abydus,</HI> who was employ'd
on the Part of the <HI>Persians,</HI> return'd into <HI>Asia,</HI>
having left behind him two thousand Merce∣naries,
with Mony to pay them, for the Service
of the <HI>Spartans.</HI> At the same time they receiv'd
a second Supply of two thousand Men from
<HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agesilaus,</HI> on account of his Age, got the Com∣mand
of the Army transferr'd to his Son <HI>Archi∣damus,</HI>
who march'd against the <HI>Arcadians;</HI> and,
in Return for what they had done the last Year
in <HI>Laconia,</HI> strom'd a Town call'd <HI>Caryae,</HI> and
<PB N="151" REF="177"/>
put the Garrison to the Sword; from whence he
proceeded to <HI>Parrhasia,</HI> and destroy'd the Coun∣try
about it. The <HI>Sicilian</HI> Troops being now
upon their Return home, were intercepted by
the <HI>Messenians;</HI> and <HI>Archidamus</HI> coming up to
their Relief, was oppos'd by the <HI>Arcadians</HI> and
<HI>Argives;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A signal Victory of the Spar∣tans.</NOTE> but he charge'd them so furiously, that
he broke them at once, and gain'd a Victory
not easily to be accounted for. It is said there
fell above ten thousand of the Enemy, without
the Loss of one single Man on the Side of the
<HI>Spartans;</HI> and hence it was distinguish'd by the
Name of <HI>The Tearless Battle.</HI> The Joy upon the
Arrival of the News at <HI>Sparta</HI> was so great, that
the People were not able to contain themselves.
This was the first remarkable Success they had
met with since their Defeat at <HI>Leuctra,</HI> which
had made such an Impression on them, that it is
said, <HI>The Men were ever since asham'd to look
their Wives in the Face.</HI> But this had given 'em
new Life; they went in Crouds to the Banks of
the <HI>Eurotas,</HI> full of Praise and Thanksgiving to
the Gods, as having wash'd off the Stain of that
Action, and restor'd their City to its ancient
Splendor. <HI>Plutarch</HI> remarks, That this Excess
of Joy too plainly discover'd the present Weakness 
of <HI>Sparta;</HI> for that Victory was formerly so
common to them, that it was look'd upon as a
thing of course: The Soldiers did not boast of
it, nor were the Citizens exalted upon it; so that
in the most extraordinary Case, they seldom sa∣crificed
<PB N="152" REF="178"/>
any thing more than a Cock; and the
Messenger who brought them the News of a sig∣nal
Victory at <HI>Mantinea</HI> in the time of the <HI>Pel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ponnesian</HI>
War, had no other Reward than a Piece
of Salt Meat. But this was re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
manner; insomuch that the old King himself
went out in Procession, to meet and embr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce his
Son, and was attended by the <HI>Epheri,</HI> and the
whole Senate, and all with Tears of Joy in their
Eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Eleans</HI> were far from being
displea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d at this Disaster, which the <HI>Arcadians</HI>
had brought upon themselves by their is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-tim'd
Vanity and Arrogance: And this Defeat of
them was follow'd by a further Train of Mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Thebens</HI> in the mean time were daily in∣creasing
in Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> in∣crease in Power.</NOTE> which gave them great Credit
and Influence among their Neighbours; and <HI>Pe∣lopidas</HI>
was chiesly instrumental in it. They were
become Modeators of the Quarrels about the
Succession in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> where they had com∣pos'd
the Differences in the Royal Family, and
taken as Hostages at one time thirty, and after∣wards
fifty young Men of the chief Families,
and with the former, the King's Brother, who
was afterwards known by the Name of <HI>Philip</HI>
of <HI>Macedon,</HI> and Father of <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI></P>
<P>They were likewise applied to by the <HI>Thessa∣lians</HI>
for Protection against the Tyranny of <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
the <HI>Pherean;</HI> whereupon <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was sent
<PB N="153" REF="179"/>
as Ambassador to expostulate with him, and
bring him to Reason. Upon his Return from
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> he went to <HI>Pharsalus</HI> in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> in
order to revenge the Treachery of some Merce∣nary
Troops, who had deserted him in that
Expedition. He was no sooner arriv'd there,
but <HI>Alexander</HI> appear'd before the Place with a
great Army. <HI>Pelopidas</HI> had but a few <HI>Thessalian</HI>
Troops with him; and imagining that <HI>Alexander</HI>
came thither to justify himself, and answer the
Complaints that were made against him, he and
<HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>menias,</HI> who was join'd in Commission with him,
went alone, and unarm'd to him, not doubting,
but the Power and Authority of <HI>Thebes,</HI> with
their own personal Reputation, and the publick
Character with which they were invested, would
protect them against any Violence. But the
Tyrant finding them in his Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lopidas</HI> and I sme∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impri∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n'd by <HI>Alexander</HI> of Pherae.</NOTE> seiz'd 'em,
and sent them Prisoners to <HI>Pherae. Polybius</HI> calls
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it an unpardonable Act of Imprudence and Rash∣ness
in <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> to trust himself so far to one
whom he knew to be so wicked and perfidious.
<HI>Alexander</HI> at first permitted every Body to see
him, with an Intent, by making him a publick
Spectacle, to break his Spirit, and humble him.
But it had a different Effect: He sent to tell
him in Defiance, <HI>That it was absurd in him, daily

The Tyrant, surpris'd at his Intrepidity, answer'd,
<HI>Why is</HI> Pelopidas <HI>in so much baste to die?</HI> Which
being reported to him, he sent him this Reply,
<HI>It is, that thou may'st perish so much the sooner,
by becoming still more hateful to Gods and Men.</HI>
From that time <HI>Alexander</HI> allow'd nobody to see
or discourse with him but <HI>Thebe</HI> his Wife, whose
Curiosity was rais'd by the Account his Keepers
had given her of his Behaviour. Assoon as she
was admitted to him, she fell a weeping, and
said, <HI>I pity your Wife. And I you,</HI> said he,
<HI>who can bear with</HI> Alexander, <HI>when you are not
his Prisoner.</HI> This Reply affected her nearly, and
rous'd in her such a Sense of her Husband's ill
Usge of her, that she repeated her Visits to
<HI>Pelopidas,</HI> and complain'd freely to him of the
many Outrages she had receiv'd. He was not
wanting, on his Part, to incense her still more
against him, till by Degrees he had work'd her
up to the highest pitch of Hatred and Resentment.
These frequent Interviews had very much the
Appearance of a Love Affair, which she had
chiefly promoted: But there is no real Foun∣dation
to say, that she went any further, than
to compassionate his Sufferings, and to commu∣nicate
her own, in order to revenge them;
which accordingly she some time after accom∣plish'd.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Thebans</HI> resenting this Insult upon the
Person of their Ambassador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The The∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans resent it.</NOTE> immediately sent an
Army into <HI>Thessaly;</HI> but the Generals, through
<PB N="155" REF="181"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill Fortune, or ill Conduct, being not able to
effect any thing, were forc'd to retire. <HI>Alexander</HI>
pursuing them, great Numbers of their Men
were kill'd; and it was owing to <HI>Epaminondas,</HI>
that the rest of them were not totally defeated.
He was at this time in Disgrace with the Govern∣ment,
the Reason whereof has before been re∣lated;
and therefore he had no Command in this
Expedition, but serv'd as a common Soldier.
However when the Troops found themselves un∣der
these Difficulties, which they attributed to
the Incapacity of their Officers, they oblig'd
him to take upon him the Command. He took
the Horse, and light-arm'd Foot, and posting
himself in the Rear, repell'd and charg'd the
Enemy by turns, till he made good the Retreat.
The <HI>Thebans,</HI> upon the Return of the Generals,
fin'd each of them ten thousand <HI>Drachmas;</HI> and
soon after sent <HI>Epaminondas</HI> in their room,
to repair this Dishonour, and prosecute their Re∣venge.
<HI>Alexander</HI> was very much terrified at his
second Arrival: But he preserring the Safety of
<HI>Pelopidas</HI> to all other Considerations, avoided
pushing things to an Extremity, for fear of
making him desperate, so as turn all his Fury
against his Prisoner; and therefore lay hovering
about with his Army, so as to keep him in awe,
and yet give him an Opportunity of offering Sa∣tisfaction;
which had the Effect he propos'd.
He thought it too dishonourable a Part to enter
into a Treaty of Alliance with one, who was
<PB N="156" REF="182"/>
look'd upon as a Monster of Mankind: But!
granted a Truce of thirty Days; in which tin
having recover'd <HI>Pelopidas</HI> and <HI>Ismenias</HI> out
his Hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pelopidas and Isme∣nias re∣leas'd by Epami∣nondas.</NOTE> he withdrew his Forces. He co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ducted

it intirely restor'd him to the Favour and goo

Behaviour, in over-looking their unjust Resent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment 
against him, was not the least Part of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Praise in it.</P>
<P><HI>Pelopidas,</HI> notwithstanding this Accident, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the main been very successful in these Foreign
Transactions; and he had rais'd such an Opini∣on
of the Justice and Integrity of the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
as well as of their Valour, that they were ea∣sily
tempted to pursue their Design of obtain∣ing
the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> pursue their De∣sign of ob∣taining the Sovereigu∣ty of Greece.</NOTE> But finding
they could not compass it by their Confede∣rates
at home, they had recourse to <HI>Persia.</HI> And
they had now a good Pretence for it; for the
<HI>Spartans</HI> had before sent one thither to treat
on their purt. Whereupon the <HI>Thebans</HI> propo∣sed
it to their Confederates as expedient, that
each of them should depute some proper Per∣son
to assist there likewise, in order to support
their respective Interests. Accordingly the <HI>Ar∣cadians,
Eleans</HI> and <HI>Argives</HI> consented to it;
and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was named on behalf of the <HI>The∣bans;</HI>
which the <HI>Athenians</HI> being inform'd of,
<PB N="157" REF="183"/>
appointed Two on their part also. But this
was a Proof how much they were degenerated
from the Virtue of their Ancestors: For what∣ever
mean Applications had before been made
to the <HI>Persians</HI> by particular Persons or States,
there had been no Instance of a of a Congress of
this kind, where, by a general Consent, all the
leading States of <HI>Greece</HI> were, by their Repre∣sentatives,
assembled in Form, to discuss and
settle their Demands on each other, at the
Court of <HI>Persia.</HI> But this was the Case at
present; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> had chiefly contribu∣ted
to it by the Peace of <HI>Antalcidas,</HI> which
had prepared the <HI>Grecians</HI> in general to receive
the Yoke, and to govern themselves according
to the Edicts of that King, whose Predecessors
had been so shamefully bafled in their At∣tempts
against them, and who himself was so
lately distress'd by those very <HI>Spartans,</HI> when
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> was ravaging in the Heart of his Em∣pire.</P>
<P><HI>Pelopidas</HI>
being arrived with the other Am∣bassadors
in <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiati ous in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> so far ingratiated himself
by his Address, and the Fame of his Exploits,
that he was particularly distinguish'd from the
rest of them, and the King received him with
most extraordinary Marks of Honour and E∣steem.
He represented to him at his Audience,
That the <HI>Thebans</HI> had constantly, from the Bat∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
of <HI>Plataea</HI> to this present time, adhered to
the Crown of <HI>Persia,</HI> and that the <HI>Spartans</HI> had
<PB N="158" REF="184"/>
broke with them, purely because they refused
to join with them against him. From thence
he took occasion to mention their success at
<HI>Leuctra,</HI> with their invading <HI>Laconia;</HI> and in∣timated,
that the late Overthrow of the <HI>Ar∣cadians</HI>
and <HI>Argives</HI> was owing to their not
having been assisted by them. The King was
so well pleased with his Person and Discourse,
and was so well affected to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> as the
People on whom he could best depend, that
he readily granted his Demands: The Sub∣stance
whereof was, <HI>That the Liberty formerly
granted to all the Towns, should be confirmed;
That</HI> Messene <HI>in particular should remain free
from the Jurisdiction of the</HI> Spartans; <HI>That the</HI>
Athenians <HI>should lay up their Fleet;</HI> and <HI>that
the</HI> Thebans <HI>should be look'd upon as the ancient
heredilary Friends and Allies of</HI> Persia.</P>
<P><HI>Pelopidas</HI> gain'd great Credit by this Nego∣tiation:
And the <HI>Thebans</HI> upon his return ex∣pecting
to receive the Benefit of it, caus'd the
Deputies of all the Towns to be assembled at
<HI>Thebes,</HI> in order to their ratifying the Treaty.
But when the Oath for confirming it was ten∣der'd
to them, they said, <HI>They came to hear
the Articles read, not to swear to them; which
they could not do without consulting their Prin∣cipals.</HI>
And <HI>Lycomedes</HI> objected, in behalf of
the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> to the Place of their Meeting,
which, he said, ought to be where the Seat
of the War was. This Method not taking
<PB N="159" REF="185"/>
effect, the Cities were applied to separtely,
in hopes by that means to awe them into a
Compliance. But the <HI>Corinthians</HI> said plainly,
<HI>They did not see any Occasion there was for the
Treaty;</HI> and others following their Example,
nothing further was done in it; so that the
<HI>Thebans</HI> were all at once disappointed in their
Views; and <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> left them as he found
them, without engaging himself any further in
their behalf; which indeed he could not do at
this time, without arming the rest of <HI>Greece</HI>
against him. For his Partiality to the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
was now no less visible, than the Designs of
the <HI>Thebans</HI> themselves, who had rais'd so much
Jealousy by what they had already done, that
there was a general Disposition to unite against
them, and to make it a <HI>Common Cause.</HI> The
<HI>Athenians</HI> were particularly disgusted by that
Article of the Treaty, which was to restrain
their Power at Sea; and they shew'd their
Resentment by putting to death <HI>Timagoras</HI>
one of their Ambassadors, upon his Return
from <HI>Persia.</HI> He was charged with having
taken part with <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> and not having act∣ed
in concert with his Colleague: And as he
was next to <HI>Pelopidas</HI> in favour with the King,
and had received rich Presents from him, it was
taken for granted, that he had betray'd the
Interests of his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> would not yet give over their
Designs; but finding they could not manage
<PB N="160" REF="186"/>
the <HI>Arcadians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 103. 2. the <HI>The∣ban</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>create fresh Di∣sturbances in Pelo∣ponnesus.</NOTE> and the other <HI>Pelopannesian</HI> A

<HI>Epaminondas</HI> appearing as an Enemy among
these latter, they easily submitted to him
and enter'd into an Engagement to act in Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liance
with him. By which means the <HI>Arca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dians</HI>
being distress'd on one Side by the <HI>Acha∣ans,</HI>
and on the other by the <HI>Spartans,</HI> made
their Complaints of this Usage at <HI>Thebes;</HI> and
from hence arose fresh Commotions and Ani∣mosities
in several Parts of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> but
not considerable enough to be particularly rela∣ted.
The most remarkable Effects of them
were at <HI>Sicyon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cyon.</NOTE> where <HI>Euphron</HI> a Man of great
Power took this Occasion to erect a Tyranny,
under colour of placing the Government in the
People. He had a natural Interest among the
<HI>Spartans,</HI> and cultivated the same with their
Enemies, and manag'd so on all Sides, by be∣traying
and sacrificing one Party to the other,
and by murthering and banishing the chief of
the Magistrates and Nobility, that he obtain'd
his Ends, and supported himself for some time,
'till the People were afterwards divided against
him, and he was murther'd at <HI>Thebes</HI> by a Par∣ty
of those whom he had banished.</P>
<P>They who suffer'd most by these Disturbances,
were the <HI>Phliasians,</HI> who were very much ex∣posed
by their Situation among the <HI>Theban</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="187"/>
Allies. <HI>Euphron</HI> not only attack'd them him∣self,
but drew the whole Body of <HI>Arcadians</HI>
and <HI>Argives</HI> upon them, by whom they must
have been swallow'd up, if they had not been
timely relieved by the <HI>Athenians</HI> under the Con∣duct
of <HI>Chares.</HI> But they had first undergone
a Siege, and made a vigorous Defence, far
beyond what could have been expected from
a small City, surrounded with so powerful Ene∣mies.
The chief Quarrel against them was
their steady Adherence to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> for
whose Sakes they had often been reduced to
the greatest Streights and Necessities, and yet
never could be prevail'd upon, from their first
engaging with them, to abandon their Inte∣rests;
insomuch that their Honour and Fide∣lity,
in this respect, is said to be without Pre∣cedent.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Athenians</HI> had drawn a good deal of
Work upon their Hands, in supporting this
little State; and being dissatisfied, that none
of their Allies had assisted them in it, the <HI>Ar∣cadians</HI>
took this Opportunity to propose an Al∣liance
with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A League between the Athe∣nians and Arcadians.</NOTE> It was debated among them,
whether the accepting it were consistent with
their Engagements to <HI>Sparta:</HI> But it being
consider'd as of equal Advantage to both States,
that the <HI>Arcadians</HI> should be drawn off from
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> the Treaty was concluded; how∣ever
it was so qualified, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were
to assist the <HI>Arcadians</HI> with a Body of Horse,
<PB N="162" REF="188"/>
in case they were invaded, without being obli∣ged
to join in the Invasion of <HI>Laconia.</HI> This
Treaty was set on foot and negotiated by <HI>Ly∣comedes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lycome∣des</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vr∣ther'd.</NOTE> who soon after, upon his Return from
<HI>Athens,</HI> was murther'd by a Party of Exiles.
He was a Man of great Designs, and good
Execution; but had engaged his Countrymen
in perpetual Quarrels, to support his own Am∣bition,
and was undoubtedly the Author of all
their late Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI> upon this new Accession, act∣ed
a treacherous Part against <HI>Corinth,</HI> which
they were endeavouring to possess themselves of,
even whilst they had garrison'd it with their
own Troops, as Protectors and Allies. But the
<HI>Corinthians</HI> having notice of their Design, im∣mediately
drew all the <HI>Athenians</HI> out of their
Garrisons, and discharg'd them. <HI>Chares</HI> at the
same time came up with his Fleet, under co∣lour
of assisting them to compose Matters in
the City: They thank'd him for the Offer of
his Service, but would not trust him so far as
to admit him into their Harbour. These Pro∣ceedings
dissolved the Alliance between the two
States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Alli∣ance dis∣solv'd be∣tween <HI>A∣thens</HI> and <HI>Corinth.</HI></NOTE> and were a kind of Declaration of War
on both Sides. Whereupon the <HI>Corinthians</HI>
thought it necessary to secure themselves by a
Peace with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and requested of the
<HI>Spartans</HI> to give their Consent to it; which
they readily granted not only to them, but
to all such others of their Consederates, as de∣sir'd
it; but declared at the same time, that, for
<PB N="163" REF="189"/>
their own Part, they would never lay down
their Arms, 'till <HI>Messenia</HI> should be restored to
them, in the Condition they received it from
their Ancestors. However the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> with
the <HI>Phliasians</HI> and some others, concluded a
Peace with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> upon Condition, <HI>That
every one should enjoy their own. Artaxerxes</HI> at
the same time sent, as a Mediator, to settle
once more the Tranquillity of <HI>Greece</HI> and pre∣vail'd
so far, that all Parties, and even the
<HI>Spartans</HI> themselves were quiet for the present:
And this was call'd putting an end to the <HI>La∣conick</HI>
or <HI>Boeotian</HI> War,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 103. 3. A general Peace.</NOTE> after it had continued
above five Years from the Battle of <HI>Leuctra.</HI>
There is a Disagreement among the Histori∣ans
of this time, concerning the Date of some
of the principal Events betwen the Battle of
<HI>Leuctra,</HI> and this Peace; but all the Occurren∣ces,
which have been here related, are general∣ly
allow'd to have happen'd within the Com∣pass
of these five Years.</P>
<P>This last Treaty had no more than the Name
and Appearance of a Peace; which, according to
the present Situation of Affairs, was not like∣ly
to be sincere, or of any long Continuance.
The growing Power of <HI>Thebes</HI> could not but
necessarily keep up the other Great States in
Arms against her; and the Lesser ones were so
involv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 103. 4. But is brole the next Year.</NOTE> either as Accessaries in their Quar∣rels,
or as Principals in their own, that the
very next Year fresh Disturbances broke out.
<PB N="164" REF="190"/>
The Flame was first kindled between the <HI>Ar∣cadians</HI>
and <HI>Eleans,</HI> who had long contested
their Right to <HI>Triphylia,</HI> which belong'd pro∣perly
to the latter; and both Sides, according
to the Fortune of their Arms, held possession
of it by turns. The <HI>Eleans</HI> being worsted up∣on
this Occasion, call'd upon the <HI>Spartans</HI> for
Assistance; and the <HI>Arcadians</HI> being supported
by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> harass'd the Country of <HI>Elis,</HI>
and took several Towns.</P>
<P>In the Year following,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 104. 1.</NOTE> they encourag'd the
<HI>Pisaeans,</HI> upon some old fabulous pretence, to
claim a right of presiding at the <HI>Olympick
Games;</HI> and they accordingly took upon them
to manage the Solemnity. The <HI>Eleans,</HI> to
whom this Honour did undoubtedly belong,
resolved not to give it up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Eleans</HI> defeat the <HI>Arcadians</HI> and <HI>Ar∣gives.</HI></NOTE> In the midst of
the Exercises they fell upon the <HI>Arcadians</HI> with
their whole Strength, and with such Fury and
Intrepidity, that they soon routed them, and
then deseated a Body of two thousand <HI>Argives;</HI>
but being at length overpower'd, retreated back
to their City, tho' with great Honour and
Applause from the People, who were conven'd
from all parts of <HI>Greece</HI> to the Festival, and,
during this Action, stood as Spectators with
their Crowns on their Heads. The Behaviour
of the <HI>Eleans</HI> upon this Occasion was the more
remarkable, because they had a very low Re∣putation
for Arms, and had done nothing like
it before. However the <HI>Pisaeans</HI> remaining
<PB N="165" REF="191"/>
Conquerors, went on with the Sports: But the
<HI>Eleans</HI> would not allow this <HI>Olympiad</HI> to have
been duly celebrated, or to be register'd in their
Annals.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminodas,</HI> during these Transactions, was
wholly intent upon advancing the Honour of
his Countrymen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt of <HI>Epami∣nondas</HI> to gain the Dominion at Sea for the <HI>The∣bans.</HI></NOTE> and proposed to them to try
for the Dominion at Sea, which he told them,
they might easily obtain, as they were Sove∣reigns
at Land: And as a Proof of it, he in∣stanced
in the Case of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who, in
the War with <HI>Xerxes,</HI> had but ten Ships at
Sea, and yet had the Command over the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI>
who had two hundred. The People
came into his Proposal; and having immediate∣ly
order'd Preparations to be made for fitting
out an hundred Gallies, sent him to <HI>Rhodes,
Chios</HI> and <HI>Byzantium,</HI> to solicite the Assistance
of those Places, and to fix them further in
their Interest: Which he easily effected, not∣withstanding
that the <HI>Athenians</HI> had sent out a
strong Squadron under the Command of <HI>La∣ches,</HI>
to oppose him. But whatever Schemes
of this kind they had formed, they were di∣verted
from pursuing them, by the Part they
took in the Quarrels among their Neighbours;
And the Death of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> happening soon
after, they lost the only Opportunity they ever
had of becoming powerful at Sea.</P>
<P>Whilst he was negotiating these Matters
abroad, some of the <HI>Theban</HI> Fugitives join'd
<PB N="166" REF="192"/>
with the <HI>Orchomenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Design to change the Govern∣ment of Thebes.</NOTE> in a Design to change the
Government of <HI>Thebes</HI> into an <HI>Aristocracy;</HI>
which being discover'd, three hundred <HI>Orcho∣menian</HI>
Horsemen, who were to have put it in
Execution, were seized by Order of the <HI>Theban</HI>
Magistrates, and condemn'd to death. They
then sent a sufficient Force against <HI>Orchomenus,</HI>
where the Men were all put to the Sword,
the Women and Children sold for Slaves, and
the City razed to the Ground. This was look'd
upon as an Act of Cruelty not common among
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and such as would not have hap∣pen'd,
if either <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> or <HI>Pelopidas</HI> had
been present. They had always shewn great
Humanity to those who were in their Power,
having never spilt the Blood of any Man they
had conquer'd, or deprived any City of its
Liberty, after they had taken it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thessalians</HI> still groaning under the Ty∣ranny
and Oppression of <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Pherean,</HI>
took up Arms against him; but being worsted
in several Battles, they begg'd Assistance of the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> who order'd seven thousand Men, un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
the Command of <HI>Pelopidas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pelopidas</HI> sent a∣gainst <HI>A∣lexander</HI> of <HI>Pherae.</HI></NOTE> to their Re∣lief.
But just as he was ready to march, there
happen'd a great Eclipse of the Sun, from
which the People, according to the Ignorance
and Superstition of the Times, apprehended
such strange Effects, that <HI>Pelopidas</HI> thought it
not adviseable to proceed with so great a Num∣ber
of his Countrymen, against the general
<PB N="167" REF="193"/>
Opinion, that the Expedition would prove fa∣tal.
As to himself, he was not at all moved
at this <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> altho' he was supposed to
be principally affected by it: For the <HI>Augurs</HI>
had made it portend his Death, considering
him as the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Thebes,</HI> that was to be eclip∣sed.
However he resolv'd to go on, and march'd
out with only three hundred Horsemen, who
attended him as Voluntiers; and having join'd
the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> he encamp'd in the Face of the
Enemy, who was far superior to him in Num∣bers,
having an Army of above twenty thou∣sand
Men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle at <HI>Cynos∣cephalae.</HI></NOTE> Near a Place call'd <HI>Cynos-cephalae,</HI>
there were two Hills opposite to each other
in the midst of the Plain; and both Sides
endeavour'd to get possession of them with their
Foot. <HI>Pelopidas</HI> at the same time order'd his
Cavalry to charge that of the Enemy, which
he soon routed, and pursued over the Plain.
But <HI>Alexander</HI> having gain'd the Hills, and do∣ing
great Execution upon the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> who
attempted to force those Ascents, <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was
obliged to give over his Pursuit, and march
up to their Relief; which so animated them,
that, after two or three Charges, the Enemy
began to fall into Disorder, and give way;
which <HI>Pelopidas</HI> perceiving, cast his Eyes about
in search of <HI>Alexander,</HI> and having at length
discover'd him in the right Wing, rallying and
encouraging his Men, he was so inflamed at
the Sight, that he advanced before his Soldiers,
<PB N="168" REF="194"/>
crying out, and challenging the Tyrant, who
retreated, and shelter'd himself in the Ranks.
<HI>Pelopidas</HI> there upon grew desperate, and charg'd
the Enemy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, great Numbers whereof, as
they advanc'd forwards, he cut down with his
own Hand: But others at a distance shot
through his Armour, and wounded him, and
then they stabb'd him in the Breast with their
Spears.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pelopidas</HI> kill'd.</NOTE> The <HI>Thessalians</HI> seeing him in this
Danger, hasten'd down from the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls to his
Assistance, but came too late to save him.
However, to revenge his Death, they attack'd
the Enemy so vigorously, both with their
Horse and Foot, that they intirely routed them,
and kill'd above three thousand in the Pursuit:
And yet did they not look upon it as a Vi∣ctory,
or think that any Success could compensate
the Loss of their General. The <HI>Thebans,</HI> who
were then present, lamented over him in the
tenderest and most affectionate manner, calling
him <HI>Their Father, Saviour,</HI> and <HI>Instructor in
every thing that was great and excellent.</HI> The
<HI>Thessalians,</HI> and other Allies not only sympa∣thiz'd,
but vy'd with them in expressing their
Concern, and doing Honour to his Memory:
And the whole Army was so affected, that
they neither put off their Armour, nor un∣bridled
their Horses, nor even dress'd their
Wounds; but ran to him, and heap'd up the
Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of the Enemy about his dead Body;
they cut off their Horses Manes, and their
<PB N="169" REF="195"/>
own Hair; and such as retired to their Tents,
neither kindled a Fire, nor took any kind of
Refreshment. In all the Cities through which
the Body pass'd, it was attended by the Ma∣gistrates,
with the Priests and Inhabitants, car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying
Trophies, Crowns and golden Armour.
After which the <HI>Thessalians</HI> begg'd it as a sin∣gular
Favour of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they might
bury him, and, in the most pathetick Terms, urg'd
it as a sort of Right due to them, as the greatest
Sufferers. <HI>You indeed,</HI> said they, <HI>have lost a
great General; and in that we share in common
with you: But we have likewise lost in him all
the Hopes of recovering our Liberty; and under
this heavy Misfortune, our paying the last Ho∣nours
to him, may be some small Alleviation of
our Sorrow.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI> granted their Re∣quest,
and they buried him with great Pomp
and Splendor. His Death, as to the Manner
of it, was rather to be pitied than commend∣ed:
For he certainly expos'd himself more than
he ought to have done. But besides the natu∣ral
Heat of his Temper, which was not easily
to be restrain'd, he was animated with a more
than ordinary Zeal in the Cause of Liber∣ty,
especially at this Juncture, when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was, in a manner, deserted by the other
Great States. For the <HI>Spartans,</HI> instead of
exerting themselves, as formerly, in behalf of
those who were injured, were making a servile
Court to <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Tyrant of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and
supplying him with Officers. The <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="170" REF="196"/>
were at the same time kept in Pay by this very
<HI>Alexander,</HI> and, in Honour to him, had erected
his Statue. This therefore <HI>Pelopidas</HI> thought
the fairest Occasion of advancing his own
and his Country's Honour, and of making it
appear to the rest of <HI>Greece,</HI> that the <HI>Thebans</HI>
were the only People, who waged War t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
succour the distress'd, and to destroy all arbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trary
and unjust Government: And this wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the principal Motive of his entering upon this
Expedition. But besides these Considerations
he was fired with Resentment against the Per∣son
of <HI>Alexander,</HI> by whom he had been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
injuriously treated, and could not forego such
an Opportunity of endeavouring as well to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venge
himself of the Tyrant, as to extirpa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the Tyranny.</P>
<P>He was of one of the best Families in <HI>Thebes,</HI>
and came early to the Possession of a large For∣tune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> which he employ'd chiefly in the Relief o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
such as wanted, and deserved his Assistance. Among
the rest, he pitch'd upon <HI>Epaminondas</HI> as:
proper Object of his Bounty, but could neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prevail with him to accept a Present from him
Which had such an Effect upon him, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
chose to conform himself, after his Example, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a plain, frugal and laborious way of living; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there was in his Apparel, and at his Table, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
open unaffected Simplicity, which he ever after
wards maintain'd in the highest Posts of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Government. But notwithstanding this Regula∣rity,
<PB N="171" REF="197"/>
and Appearance of Oeconomy, his constant
Attention to the Business of the Publick made
him neglect his private Affairs, and very much
impair'd his Estate; insomuch that having a
great Number of Children to provide for, his
Friends took Occasion one Day to tell him, <HI>That
Mony was a very necessary thing. It is so indeed,</HI>
said he; <HI>but it is for that Man yonder,</HI> pointing
to one <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who was lame and blind.
There was a great Conformity of Manners be∣tween
him and <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> except that he de∣lighted
most in the Exercises of the Body, and
the other in those of the Mind. But they had
the same general Disposition to Virtue, and the
Love of their Country; and this begat the strict∣est
Friendship between them. <HI>Plutarch</HI> dates
the Beginning of it from the Siege of <HI>Mantinea,</HI>
soon after the <HI>Peace of Antalcidas.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI>
acting then in Alliance with <HI>Sparta, Epaminondas</HI>
and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> were engag'd together, and their
Wing giving way, they kept their Ground, and
stood singly in each others Defence, till <HI>Pelopidas</HI>
being very much wounded, fell among the Slain.
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> concluded him dead, yet would not
leave his Body in the Power of the Enemy, but,
tho' he was wounded himself likewise, maintain'd
the Conflict, till at length <HI>Agesipolis</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI>
King came up from the other Wing of the
Army, and rescu'd them both, when to all Ap∣pearance
they were lost. This was an Ac∣tion
that must, in all Probability, have happen'd
<PB N="172" REF="198"/>
before the Town was besieg'd; and there is room
to collect from <HI>Pausanias,</HI> that it did so: But it
is not generally taken notice of, nor any where
particularly describ'd; neither does it elsewhere
appear, that either of these two Generals had
distinguish'd themselves so early in any En∣gagement.
However this Circumstance of their
Lives, in the manner it is attested, may
have its Weight, and it is too remarkable a
one to be omitted. But however their Friend∣ship
began, it was very sincere and lasting; and
the Success of their Atchievements was almost in∣tirely
owing to that perfect Union and good
Correspondence, that was always between them,
without any Jealousy of Command abroad, or
Rivalship in the Administration at home. This
good Agreement between them, has been ta∣ken
notice of, in opposition to that Spirit of Dis∣sension,
Envy and Rancour, which formerly
reign'd in <HI>Athens</HI> between <HI>Aristides</HI> and <HI>The∣mistocles,
Cimon</HI> and <HI>Pericles, Nicias</HI> and <HI>Alcibi∣ades,</HI>
who, great as they were in other respects,
were always endeavouring to supplant and ruin
one another; and their personal Enmity was
said to exceed that which they bore to the
Enemies of their Country. But yet it has been
shewn, that some of them knew how to sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le
their Jealousies upon Occasion, and to curb and
moderate their Resentment, when the Affairs
of the Publick requir'd it. But there was no
need of any Management of this kind, between
<PB N="173" REF="199"/>
the two Great Men we are now speaking of.
They had no private Views of their own;
they were above all Considerations of Mony;
and they had no Ambitions but for the Pub∣lick;
so that provided That were well served,
their Intention was answer'd; and each of them
look'd upon the others Success in it, as his own.
As to what relates further to <HI>Pelopidas</HI> singly,
he was very strong and active, and of indesa∣tigable
Industry; he was bold and enterprising,
and so successful withal, that he never lost one
Battle. He had so throughly established him∣self
in the Favour and Affections of the Peo∣ple,
that he was chose thirteen times Governor
of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> or (as <HI>Diodorus</HI> says) without Inter∣uption,
from the Time of the recovering the
<HI>Cadmêa.</HI> Upon the whole, he was at least the
second Man of <HI>Thebes,</HI> and in some respects
may be consider'd as the First, particularly
with regard to the Affair of the <HI>Cadmêa,</HI> which
was certainly the Foundation of the <HI>Theban</HI>
Greatness. He would indeed have persuaded
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> to bear a part with him in that
Undertaking; but he declin'd it, as an Action
of too much Blood and Outrage. He told
him, <HI>That if the rest who were concern'd in
it, were as moderate as their Chief, he should
make no Scruple of joining with them; but
that some of them he foresaw, would carry
their Passion and Revenge too far, and must ne∣cessarily
involve the Innocent with the Guilty.</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="200"/>
However, in the main he approv'd the De∣sign,
as the Cause of Liberty, and in some
measure contributed towards the Success, tho'
he did not care to be engaged in the despe∣rate
Part of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans,</HI> as well to revenge the Death
of <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> as to improve the Victory of the
<HI>Thessalians,</HI> which they were not able to do of
themselves, forthwith sent to their Assistance
seven thousand Foot, and seven hundred Horse,
who soon defeated, and broke to pieces the
Remainder of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Army.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alexander</HI> defeated, and redu∣ced to Terms.</NOTE> Whereupon
he was compell'd to restore the Towns he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
taken from the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> and to withdraw
his Garrisons out of all the other Places h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had unjustly seized; and he was further obli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged
by Oath, to take part with the <HI>Theban</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in their Wars, whenever they should requir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
it. Upon these Conditions, they permitted
him to return in peace to his own Domini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,
where he continued about seven Year
longer, till he was grown so insupportable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
every Body about him, that he was murther'd it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

kind though too much for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of his Cruel∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> who had been
wont to bury some alive, and to dress up other
in Bears and Boars Skins, to be baited an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="175" REF="201"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd massacred the Inhabitants of whole Cities,
which were in Friendship and Alliance with
him. But amidst these Cruelties, there is one
Instance recorded of him, wherein he discover'd
some little Sparks of Humanity and Remorse,
which yet he was far from valuing himself up∣on.
For seeing a famous Tragoedian act in
the <HI>Troades</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> he went abruptly
out of the Theatre, but sent to bid the Actor
go on with his Part; for that he did not go
out of any Dislike of his Performance, but be∣cause
he was asham'd, that he, who had never
shewn any Concern for those he had mur∣ther'd,
should be seen to weep for the Suffer∣ings
of <HI>Hecuba</HI> and <HI>Andromache.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> they were
still restlcss in their Pursuit of Power, and sought
all Opportunities of advancing themselves upon
the Weakness, or Divisions of the other States.
They who furnish'd them with the most plau∣sible
Pretence for stirring at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 104. 2. <HI>Divisions among the</HI> Arcadians.</NOTE> were
the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> who were quarrelling among
themselves about some consecrated Mony, which
they had taken out of the Temple of <HI>Olympia</HI>
during their Disputes with the <HI>Eleans,</HI> and ap∣plied
to the Payment of a select Body of their
Troops, call'd the <HI>Epariti.</HI> The <HI>Mantineans</HI>
protested against it as Sacrilege, and brought
over several of <HI>The Council of Ten Thousand,</HI>
who had at first consented to it, to retract
their Opinion, and to agree with them, that
<PB N="176" REF="202"/>
it was a wicked thing, which would sor ever
brand them with Infamy, and entail a Curs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon their Posterity. The debating this Mat∣ter
was principally between the <HI>Tegeans</HI> and
<HI>Mantineans;</HI> and it wrought such Confusion be∣tween
them, and the rest of the <HI>Arca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians,</HI>
that they thought it necessary, for the Peace
of the Community, to make it up as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they could, both with the <HI>Eleans,</HI> and among
themselves. But the leading Men, who had
touch'd the Mony, apprehending they might
be call'd to an Account for it, thought the
best way of preventing such an Enquity, would
be to embroil Matters still more; and there∣sore
sent to the <HI>Thebans</HI> to let them know, the
<HI>Arcadians</HI> were upon the point of revolting to
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> if they did not speedily come in,
and put a Stop to it. At the same time they
sent Directions to a <HI>Theban</HI> Officer in <HI>Tegea,</HI>
to seize some of their own People, as Distur∣bers
of the Peace: And accordingly great
Numbers were apprehended, and consin'd as Pri∣soners
of the State. But this occasion'd such a ge∣neral
Clamour, that they were soon after discharg'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Complaint was made of it at <HI>Thebes,</HI> as
a Matter of Impeachment against the Officer,
for intermeddling in their Affairs, and attempt∣ing
to interrupt the good Correspondence be∣tween
the Two States. The more moderate
among them, who saw the Consequence of cal∣ling
in a foreign Power to decide their Dif∣ferences,
<PB N="177" REF="203"/>
protested against the <HI>Thebans</HI> marching
their Troops into their Territories, and did
what they could to prevent it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the Thebans take ad∣vantage of.</NOTE> But the <HI>The∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI>
could not be prevail'd upon to let slip
such an Opportunity of getting once more a
footing in <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> which was their real
Design; and <HI>Epaminondas</HI> made no great Se∣cret
of it; but he told them at the same
time, by way of Justification, <HI>That the</HI> Thebans
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>had been drawn into the War on their Account;
that therefore they had acted treacherously with
them, in making Peace with</HI> Athens <HI>without their
Consent; however, that when he should march his
Army into</HI> Peloponnesus, <HI>to assist his Friends
there, he should see what Proofs they the</HI> Arca∣dians
<HI>would then give of their Fidelity.</HI> This
was deliver'd in so magisterial and menacing
a Stile, that they who were best afsected to
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> did not like it; and the <HI>Manti∣neans,</HI>
with such others, as were concerned for
the good of the Community, and the general
Safcty of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> concluded there was no
time to be lost, in providing against the worst
that could happen.</P>
<P>Accordingly they sent to the <HI>Athenians</HI> and
<HI>Spartans</HI> to apprise them of the Danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athens and Sparta <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to assist the Mantine∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> and
to ask their Assistance. They immediately took
the Alarm, and enter'd into a strict Consede∣racy
sor their common Defence. And to pre∣vent
all Disputes about the Command in the
Army, it was agreed to divide it in such man∣net,
<PB N="178" REF="204"/>
that each State was to have it within their
own Territories. This was a point the <HI>Arca∣dians</HI>
had very much at heart: But the <HI>Spar∣tans</HI>
being now so easily persuaded to give that
up to them, which they had so long contcst∣ed
with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> even till they were re∣duced
to the greatest Extremity, was a plain
Proof, how much they were terrified with
the Apprechensions of another Descent into <HI>Pe∣loponnesus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI>
in the mean time began his
March with all the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> some <HI>Euboean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and a Body of <HI>Thessalian</HI> Horse, expecting to
be join'd by the <HI>Argives, Messenions</HI> and many
others, upon his appearing among them. Up∣on
his first Arrival in <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> he lay for
some time at <HI>Nemea,</HI> a Town in the Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣tory
of <HI>Argos,</HI> where he might reasonably hope
to intercept the <HI>Athenians</HI> in their March to
join their Consederates; but receiving Intelli∣gence,
that they were to pass by Sea, he re∣moved
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; which City, with the great∣est
Part of <HI>Areadia,</HI> immediately declared for
him. The <HI>Spartans,</HI> with their Consederates,
had their general Rendezvous at <HI>Mant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
which they naturally imagin'd would be first
attack'd, as being the chief Seat of those who
had revolted from the <HI>Thebans.</HI></P>
<P>But whilst they were securing themselves on
this Side, <HI>Epaininondas</HI> considering, that the
City of <HI>Spar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> was in a manner drain'd for
<PB N="179" REF="205"/>
this Expedition, broke up privately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epami∣nondas en∣deavours to surprise Sparta.</NOTE> and march'd
all Night, in order to surprise it. But the De∣sign
being discover'd to <HI>Agesilaus</HI> as he was
upon his March to <HI>Mantinea,</HI> he sent imme∣diate
Notice of it to <HI>Sparta,</HI> with Orders to
put the Town in a Posture of Defence, 'till
he could come in to its Relief; which he did
with such Expedition, that <HI>Epaminondas</HI> found
him in the City ready to receive him. That
which is here related of <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> is by <HI>Diodo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us
Siculus</HI> ascribed to <HI>Agis</HI> the other <HI>Spartan</HI>
King. However that be, it is certain, that
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> had a principal Part in the Defence
of the City. The few Forces in it were post∣ed
to the best Advantage, that the Time and
other Circumstances would admit of; and the
old Men and Boys were placed on the Tops of
the Houses, to annoy the Enemy with Darts and
Stones. <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> tho' he found by this
Disposition, that his Design was discover'd, yet
made an Assault at several Parts of the City,
but met with the most vigorous Opposition.
<HI>Ages<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> saw there was now no room for that
Caution or Cunning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Agehlau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which had served him
upon other Occasions: Wherefore putting all
upon a desperate Push, he exerted himself far
beyond what could be expected from his Years,
and, by dint of Valour, repuls'd the Enemy.
But great Part of the Glory of this Action
was due to his Son <HI>Archidamus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> who having les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

He pass'd the River in open Defiance
of the <HI>Thebans;</HI> then march'd up an Eminence

so lately beat the <HI>Spartans,</HI> when they had the
Advantage both of the Ground, and the Num∣bers.
He who signaliz'd himself most as a pri∣vate
Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and of</HI> Isa∣das.</NOTE> was <HI>Isadas</HI> the Son of <HI>Phabidas.</HI>
He was a very beautiful, large and well-pro∣portion'd
Youth, scarce arrived at the Age of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Manhood. He had just anointed himself at
Home, when the Alarm being given, he rush'd
out without any Arms, and almost naked; then
snatching a Spear in one Hand, and a Sword
in the other, he broke into the thickest of his
Enemies, and bore down all before him. The
<HI>Ephori,</HI> after the Action was over, gave him a
Garland as the Reward of his Gallantry; but
then, to keep up the Rigour of their Disci∣pline,
fined him a thousand <HI>Drachmas,</HI> for go∣ing
into the Battle unarmed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartan</HI> Forces were now come up from
<HI>Mantinca,</HI> and were follow'd by most of the
Confederates;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> so that <HI>Epaminondas</HI> finding no∣thing
more to be done on that Side, drew of
his Army, and turn'd towards <HI>Mantinea,</HI> which
he judged to be now quite desenceless. For
besides that the Troops were drawn out of it,
the Inhabitants were scatter'd about in the Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
having taken that Opportunity, whilst the War
<PB N="181" REF="207"/>
was removed into another Quarter, to get in
their Harvest. Wheresore he resolved to attack
the Town; and first order'd the Horse thither,
who found the People dispers'd in the manner
they had been informed, and all things to Ap∣pearance,
as they expected. But it happen'd,
that six thousand <HI>Athenian</HI> Auxiliaries, who
coming by Sea, knew nothing of what had
pass'd at <HI>Sparta,</HI> and having pass'd the <HI>Isthmus,</HI>
in order to join the Confederates, as they sup∣posed,
in <HI>Mantinea,</HI> were just got into the Town;
and without staying to refresh themselves, or
their Horses, march'd out, and gave the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
Battle. After an obstinate Dispute, with
some Loss on both Sides, the <HI>Athenians</HI> got the
better,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantinea <HI>reliev'd by the</HI> A∣theniens.</NOTE> and took those, who were without the
Walls, under their Protection. This Action
was a very sharp one, but not decisive; and
is to be consider'd rather as a Skirmish, and
a Prelude to what happen'd afterwards, than
as a Victory. However it was of more im∣mediate
Consequence to the <HI>Mantineans,</HI> who,
without such a seasonable and miraculous Re∣lies,
must have been lost. And <HI>Hegelochus,</HI>
who commanded this Body of <HI>Athenians,</HI> ob∣tain'd
great Honour by making such a Stand
against the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who were much superior
in Numbers, and were also supported by the
<HI>Thessalian</HI> Horse.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> was very much piqu'd at the
ill Success of these two last Enterprises, which he
<PB N="182" REF="208"/>
was asraid would lessen him in the Opinion
of his Allies, and sully the Glory of his former
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chievements; and therefore thought himself
obliged to attempt something further, to sup∣port
his own and his Country's Honour, and
to keep up the Spirits of those, whom he had
taken under his Protection. And as the Time
allotted him for this Expedition was very near
expiring, he had no time to lose. Besides he
was got so far into the Enemies Country, and
they were so well prepared sor him, and watch'd
his Motions so narrowly, that he thought he
could not easily secure his Retreat without fight∣ing;
or that if he did, it would be abandoning
and sacrificing his Allies. These Considerati∣ons
determin'd him to proceed immediately
to Action, and, by one decisive Battle, either
to make himself Master of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> or to
fall honourably in the Attempt.</P>
<P>Accordingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> upon the <HI>Spartans</HI> coming to the
Relies of the <HI>Mantincans,</HI> he prepar'd to attack
them; and this drew on a general Engagement
of both the Armies, with their respective Con∣sederates.
That of the <HI>Thebans</HI> consisted of
thirty thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse;
which was more by a third Part, both of Horse
and Foot, than the <HI>Spartans</HI> had, with the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
and all the rest of their Associates. The
<HI>Mantineans,</HI> as the War was in their Territori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
were in the right Wing, with the <HI>Spartans</HI> next
to them; the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the lest, and the <HI>A∣chaans,
<PB N="183" REF="209"/>
Eleans,</HI> and others of less Note, made
up the main Body. The <HI>Thebans,</HI> with the <HI>Ar∣cadians,</HI>
chose the Left of their Army to oppose
the Right of the Enemy; the <HI>Argives</HI> were in
the right; and their main Body consisted of the
<HI>Euboeans, Locrians, Sicyonians, Messenians, Thes∣salians</HI>
and others: And both the Armies were
flank'd with their Horse.</P>
<P>But after this Disposition, <HI>Epaminondas</HI> took a
Compass, as if he declin'd fighting; and then
made his Troops halt, and lay down their Arms,
with a shew of encamping at a small Distance
from the Enemy, hoping, by this Feint, to allay
their Heat, and take off the first Impression of
their Fury, and then to fall upon them by Sur∣prise;
wich happen'd in a great measure as he
expected. For when he afterwards advanc'd to∣wards
them, they had quitted their Arms, and
their Horses, and were so dispers'd about, that
they had much ado to form themselves in time.
However they recover'd the Surprise, and stood
the Charge with great Resolution. <HI>Epaminondas</HI>
put the Issue of the Battle upon his left Wing, as
he did at <HI>Leuctra;</HI> and his Scheme of breaking
in upon the Enemy was much after the same
manner, by placing the best of his Men in Front,
then drawing them up close, and narrowing them
to a Point, so as to penetrate like the Beak of a
Gally, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> expresses it. The Engage∣ment
began with the Horse; and it was very hot
and obstinate, till at length the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
<PB N="184" REF="210"/>
bore the Brunt of it, were so gall'd with the Darts
and Slings of the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> and so over-power'd
with the Numbers of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they were
forc'd to give Way, and to leave their Foot ex∣pos'd;
but yet they kept themselves in a Body,
so as not to break in upon them. And in their
Retreat, meeting with a Detachment of the <HI>Eu∣boeans,</HI>
and other Mercenaries, whom <HI>Epaminondes</HI>
had sent round to attack their Rear, they fell in
among them, and cut them entirely to pieces.
The rest of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in that Wing, were
hard press'd by the <HI>Argives,</HI> and the <HI>Theben</HI>
Horse; but some <HI>Elean</HI> Horse, who had been
posted in the Rear as a Body of Reserve, coming
up to their Relief, they maintain'd their Ground.
Their Horse in the other Wing made the same
vigorous Resistance, but were forc'd at last to
throw themselves in among their Foot for Pro∣tection.</P>
<P>Upon
this the Foot join'd Battle, and sought
with incredible Fury, especially the <HI>Spartans</HI> and
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who were more immediately con∣cern'd
in the Event of the Action, and were
never more in Earnest. Their Lances being
broke with the Violence of the Charge, they
clos'd in with their Swords, and stood Foot to
Foot, neither Side abating of their Rage, or
giving back one Inch of Ground. Which <HI>Epa∣minondas</HI>
perceiving, form'd a Troop of the most
determin'd Men about him, and putting himself
at the Head of them, made a very vigorous
<PB N="185" REF="211"/>
Charge upon the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Phalanx, and
wounded their General with the first Javelin he
threw. And his Troop pushing on with the
same Ardour, he soon broke the Enemy to
pieces; and then made such Havock among
them, that the Ground about him was cover'd
with the Bodies of the Slain. But advancing
still forwards, in order to make a thorough Rout
of it, the <HI>Spartans</HI> rallied, and collected them∣selves
into a Body, pointing their whole Fury at
him, and throwing an infinite Number of Darts
at him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epami∣nondas kill'd.</NOTE> many of which he drew out of his Body,
and retorted at them; till at last he was mor∣tally
wounded by a Javelin, which was said to
be thrown by <HI>Gryllus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who
was afterwards kill'd himself in the same Battle.
But the Death of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> is by some ascrib'd
to <HI>Anticrates</HI> a <HI>Spartan,</HI> who, as a Reward for so
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minent a Piece of Service, was exempted from
all publick Offices and Taxes; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> says,
there was one of his Descendants remaining in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Time, who enjoy'd the same Immunities.
The <HI>Thebans,</HI> upon their General's falling, re∣new'd
the Attack, in order to rescue his Body,
and, after a very sharp Resistance on the Part of
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> carried it off. This Missortune
put an End to the Action; and both Sides parted,
as it were, by Consent. <HI>Xenophon</HI> makes it en∣tirely
a drawn Battle, and says, that each Party
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rected Trophies, and ask'd leave to bury their
Dead; that neither of them took any Town,
<PB N="186" REF="212"/>
nor gain'd any Accession of Territory, or any En∣crease
of Power, and that Things remain'd just in
the same Situation after the Battle, as they were
before. But however exact and faithful he may be
in the other Parts of his History, he is thought
upon this Occasion to have been a little pre∣judic'd,
and to have industriously avoided saying
too much to the Advantage of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who
had manifestly the Victory, though they were in
too much Concern and Confusion to pursue it;
and the only Grounds upon which the Enemy
disputed it with them, was on account of the
<HI>Euboeans</HI> and others, whom the <HI>Athenians,</HI> in their
Retreat, had cut to pieces.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> was carried alive into his Tent,
where, assoon as he recover'd his Speech, he ask'd
his Friends about him, <HI>Whether the Enemy had
taken his Shield from him:</HI> They told him, <HI>It
was safe;</HI> and it being brought to him, he kiss'd
it. He then ask'd, <HI>Which Side had the Victory:</HI>
They told him, <HI>The</HI> Thebans. <HI>All then,</HI> said he,
<HI>is well.</HI> And soon after, upon the drawing the
Head of the Javelin out of his Body, he sell, as
it were, in the Arms of Victory, and, congra∣mlating
the good Fortune of his Country, ex∣pired.</P>
<P>There
was something very great and solemn in
these Circumstances of his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> and suitable to
that just and deliberate Firmness and Composure
of Mind, which he had shewn in all the Actions
of his Life. To consider him in all Respects, as
<PB N="187" REF="213"/>
a Soldier, Statesman and Philosopher, he was not
only, as <HI>Cicero</HI> esteems him, the first Man of
<HI>Greece,</HI> but the greatest perhaps that any Age or
Country has produc'd. For all the several Vir∣tues,
which others posses'd singly, were united
in him, and in so perfect a Degree, as to be
without an Allay of any one Vice, or Failing.
Besides his natural good Disposition, he had all
the Advantages of Education, and was furnish'd
with the best Masters, not only for Eloquence
and Philosophy, but also for his Exercises, and
all the other lighter Accomplishments. Hence
it was, that <HI>Polymnis</HI> his Father's House was at
that time one of the best Schools in <HI>Greece,</HI> and
open to all the learned World. He was indeed
more liberal upon this Head of Expence, than
his Circumstancees would allow; for tho' he was
of one of the best Families in <HI>Thebes,</HI> he died so
poor, as to leave his Son no other Fortune, than
what he had bestow'd on him in this manner.
It happen'd however, that he neither wanted,
nor desired one: For he had such a thorough
Contempt of Riches, that he did not leave enough
to bury him. He was in this, as in many other
Respects, a Philosoper in Practice and Reality,
and was poor upon Choice; and yet without any
Affectation, he View of being applauded for it.
<HI>Jusian</HI> says, he was no more desirous of Fame,
than he was of Riches. He did not indeed af∣fc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Popularity, or Applause; he was so modest,
that all his great Offices were in a manner forc'd
<PB N="188" REF="214"/>
upon him; and his first Motive in all his Under∣takings,
was the Honour of his Country: But
yet he had not an Insensibility of Glory with re∣gard
to himself, as may appear from the Answer
he made to his Friends about him when he was
dying. Among other Expressions of their Grief
for the Loss of him, they lamented his leaving
no Children behind him: <HI>Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>I leave
two fair Daughters, the Victories of</HI> Leuctra <HI>and</HI>
Mantinea, <HI>to perpetuate my Memory.</HI> Upon
another Occasion, being ask'd, <HI>Whether he thought
himseif, or</HI> Chabrias, <HI>or</HI> Iphicrates, <HI>the better Ge∣neral?
'Tis hard,</HI> said he, <HI>to judge while we live.</HI>
There are other Instances to prove, that he knew
what was due to his Merit, and that he did not
decline Praise, tho' he did not covet it. He was
covetous of nothing but his Time, which he em∣ploy'd
wholly in the Improvement of his Mind,
or in what he thought might be useful to the
Publick; and he made even his Diversions sub∣servient
to that End. His Running, Wrestling,
and other Exercises of that Kind, were not used
by him, as they generally were by others, barely
for Amusement, or the Glory of excelling in
them, but as Lessons of Instruction in the Art of
War. For which Reason he had an Aversion to
sat Men in the Army, and disbanded one, <HI>who,</HI>
he said, <HI>would require three or four Shields to cover
his Belly.</HI> He had an extraordinary Genius for
War, and had thoroughly studied the Theory of
it, before he enter'd upon Action. It has ap∣pear'd
<PB N="189" REF="215"/>
from his Disposition, and his Manner of
attacking, both at <HI>Leuctra</HI> and <HI>Mantinea,</HI> that he
was particularly well skill'd in the <HI>Tacticks.</HI> That
which has set him in a Light above most of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Generals, is the Difficulties and Dis∣couragements,
which he met with upon his first
Appearance in the World. He had to do with
a People, who were sunk into a State of Sloth
and Idleness, and disposed to Slavery. They were
very low at that time in their Reputation for
Arms: And tho' they had taken some Part in
the late Wars, it was occasionally only, and ra∣ther
in order to support themselves by their At∣tachment
to those who were best able to protect
them, than with a Sense of gaining Honour, or
asserting their Freedom. They had but few
Troops, and those were without Spirit, or Dis∣cipline,
and without Officers to conduct them.
This was not the Case of the great Captains who
went before him, especially those of <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta,</HI> who had Troops ready form'd and dis∣ciplin'd,
inur'd to Dangers and Fatigue, sir'd
with Ambition, and the Love of their Country,
supported by their Fellow-Citizens, and flush'd
with Victory: So that their Commanders had
nothing more to do, than to pursue the Track of
Glory they were in, and to carry on the Service
in the Way they found it. <HI>Epaminondas</HI> had
none of these Advantages: But by his Courage
and Zeal, and the Force of his Genius, he sup∣ply'd
the want of them, and, in effect, created
<PB N="190" REF="216"/>
an Army; which being train'd up by his In∣structions,
and animated by his Example, soon
shew'd the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they were capable of
acting for themselves, and fighting their own
Battles. From hence it was, that from Auxill∣aries
and Dependents, they became Principals,
and put in for their Turn of Superiority in <HI>Grecce.</HI>
It must be allow'd, that <HI>Pelopidas</HI> had pav'd the
Way for him in effecting this Change, and that
he had been assisting to him in most of his great
Enterprizes. But without <HI>Epimanondas,</HI> the Work
had been left very imperfect. It was his bold
Defiance of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> that brought on the
Battle of <HI>Leuctra:</HI> And he afterwards went fur∣ther
towards the reducing them, than any one
Man, or than all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> together.
And tho' he did not throughly succeed in it,
he had so disabled and dispirited them, that they
never recover'd their former Reputation and Au∣thority.
Among other Marks of their being
humbled, he had brought them to <HI>lengthen their
Monosyllables,</HI> as he himself express'd it, in rally∣ing
them upon that assected and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I may be allow'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> But it seeme to be justified by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> which Taci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> despotick Bre∣vity,
with which they were wont to expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> m∣selves
in their Answers to those who o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er'd to
treat, or expostulate with them. His Military
Virtues were still inferior to those which regarded
either the Society, or himself. His Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣edness
was visible in every Circumstance of his
<PB N="191" REF="217"/>
Life: And nothing could ever shake his Inte∣grity,
or slacken his Zeal sor the Publick. The
<HI>Persians</HI> knowing of what Consequence it was to
fix him in their Interest, sent <HI>Diomedon</HI> of <HI>Cy∣zicus</HI>
to tempt him with a large Sum of Mony.
He first gain'd <HI>Micythus,</HI> a particular Favourite
of his, and gave him five Talents to sound him
upon it. But <HI>Epaminondas</HI> rejected the Offer with
Disdain and Indignation, declaring, That he
would not put the Riches of the Universe in Compe∣tition
with the Good of his Country. You, <HI>Dio∣medon,
said he,</HI> don't know me; and I am not
surprized, that you should form a Judgment of me
from yourself; for which Reason I forgive you;
but withal advise you to make the best of your Way
home, that you may not have an Opportunity of
corrupting others. As for you, <HI>said he, addressing
himself to</HI> Micythus, if you don't immediately re∣store
him his Mony, I'll deliver you up to the Ma∣gistracy.
His Generosity and Friendship have
sufficiently appear'd in his Behaviour to <HI>Pelopidas.</HI>
He was judicious and grave, but yet afsable; he
was continent, patient of Injuries, and very com∣passionate;
and, to crown all, he was strictly just,
and so sincere a Lover of Truth, that he would
not tell a Lye even in Jest. He was also a very
able Speaker, and had gone further in his Search
after Knowledge of all Kinds, than most of the
Pailosophers of his Time, who were so by Pro∣fession:
And yet he did not value himself upon
it, or make any Shew of it; and it was said of
<PB N="192" REF="218"/>
him in this Respect, <HI>That Nobody knew more than
he, and spoke less.</HI> Study was indeed his darling
Passion; and he was so devoted to it, that he
may be consider'd almost as a single Instance of
one, who acquitted himself so well to the Pub∣lick
against the natural Bent of his Inclination.
It was look'd upon as Matter of Astonishment,
that a Man who was so much hid from the World,
and buried, as it were, in Books, should break out
at once into so great, and so tumultuous a Scene
of Action; that he should negotiate the Interests
of his Country abroad, manage the Government
at home, and lead an Army with such Success
against the united Powers of <HI>Greece.</HI> But he had
a Capacity for every thing, and applied himself
to every thing; and when he was once roused
by a Sense of what the Publick expected from
him, he gave up his belov'd Retirement, and
was from thenceforwards in such continual Mo∣tion,
that Nobody every did so much in so short
a Time. When the <HI>Thebans</HI> were once brought
into Action, he resolv'd to keep them up to it:
If I am your General, <HI>said he,</HI> you must be Sol∣diers.
<HI>Boeotia,</HI> as being an open flat Country, <HI>he
told them,</HI> was the Stage of War; and that they
could keep it no longer than they had their Hands
<HI>upon their Shields.</HI> It was by these Maxims, and
this Conduct, that he became the Support of his
Country, and a Pattern to the greatest Captains
of the present, and succeeding Times. <HI>Philopae∣men,</HI>
who is call'd the last of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> made
<PB N="193" REF="219"/>
it his Study to imitate him; and is said to have
come very little short of him in his Valour and Con∣duct,
and his Integrity. But he was more rough
and cholerick, and had too much of the Soldier
in his common Deportment; whereas <HI>Epami∣nondas</HI>
was cool and gentle, and had nothing of
Fierceness, but in the Field. Upon the whole,
he rais'd the Glory of <HI>Thebes</HI> to an Heighth
beyond any of her Neighbours at that Time,
and that so suddenly, that it was said to be born
with him: And it will appear by the Sequel of
the Story, how far it may be likewise said to
have expir'd with him.</P>

the whole Strength of
the Country being drawn out,
and ranged according to their
different Interests. And it was fought with an
<PB N="195" REF="221"/>
Obstinacy equal to the Importance of it, which
was the fixing the Empire of <HI>Greece.</HI> And
this must of course have have been transferr'd
to the <HI>Thebans</HI> upon their Victory, if they had
not lost the Fruits of it by the Death of their
General, who was the Soul of all their Coun∣sels
and Designs. This blasted all their Hopes,
and put out their sudden Blaze of Power, al∣most
as soon as it was kindled. However They
did not presently give up their Pretensions;
They were still rank'd among the Leading
States, and made several further Struggles; but
they were faint and ineffectual, and such as
were rather for Life and Being, than for Su∣periority
and Dominion. They proposed no∣thing
further to themselves at present, than an
honourable Peace; and this was according to
the Opinion of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> himself, who, when
he lay wounded in his Tent, inquir'd after
those whom he judged most proper to suc∣ceed
him in the Command; and finding they
were kill'd in the Battle, advised them to make
Peace; which they easily concluded; for their
Enemies were as weary of the War, as them∣selves.
The Conditions were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace renew'd by all but the <HI>Spar∣tans.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That every one
should retain what they were now in possession of,
and hold it independent of any other Power.</HI>
Hereupon all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> enter'd in∣to
a League Offensive and Defensive, except∣ing
only the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who refus'd to ratify the
Treaty, because the <HI>Messenians</HI> were included
<PB N="196" REF="222"/>
in it. This Opposition was rais'd chiefly by
<HI>Agesilaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Agesilaus <HI>censur'd for it.</HI></NOTE> who was therefore look'd upon as
stubborn and refractory, and an unreasonable
Protracter of the War, especially as he had no
Mony to carry it on, but what he was to raise
by Loans and heavy Taxes. And his Stick∣ling
with so much Obstinacy at this Time for
the Country of <HI>Messenia,</HI> revived in the Minds
of the People, the great Extent of Territory,
and the great Dominion both by Sea and Land,
that he had lost since his Accession to the
Throne.</P>
<P>But whatever Censure he had incurr'd by
this Proceeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 104. 3. <HI>His Tran∣sactions in</HI> Aegypt.</NOTE> his next Enterprise, which
was the last Scene of his Life, was still more
blameable, at least with regard to himself, tho'
it did not so much affect the Interest of his
Country. <HI>Tachos,</HI> who had usurped the King∣dom
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> being at War with the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI>
engaged <HI>Agesilaus</HI> to assist him with a
Body of <HI>Spartans.</HI> Accordingly he enter'd in∣to
that Service, expecting to have the sole Com∣mand
of the Army. Upon his Arrival in
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> all the great Officers of the Crown
went to pay their Compliments to him; and
the whole Country flock'd down to the Shore
to see the Man, whose Reputation in Arms
had made so much Noise in the World. But
they were much disappointed, when, instead of
the great and awful Prince they look'd for,
they found a little old Man of a contemptible
<PB N="197" REF="223"/>
Presence, lying on the Grass, his Cloaths thread∣bare,
and his Hair uncomb'd, and rejecting
their rich Presents of Sweetmeats and Perfumes,
which he told them, they might give to his Slaves
the <HI>Helots.</HI> He join'd the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Army,
which consisted of eighty thousand Men, besides
ten thousand hired Troops, whereof one thou∣sand
were <HI>Spartans.</HI> But <HI>Tachos</HI> deceiv'd him
in his Expectations of being General, and would
allow him no other Command than that
of the <HI>Mercenaries</HI> at Land, committing to <HI>Cha∣brias,</HI>
who came in as a Voluntier from <HI>Athens,</HI>
the Charge of his Fleet, and reserving to him∣self
the chief Command over all. <HI>Agesilaus</HI> was
otherwise treated by him with so much Inso∣lence,
and in a manner so much below his
Spirit and Dignity, that he took an Opportu∣nity
to fall in with <HI>Nectanebus</HI> his Son, or ra∣ther
his Nephew, who had revolted from him,
and got himself to be proclaim'd King in his
stead. And the People being generally on his
Side, <HI>Agesilaus</HI> join'd with them, and drove <HI>Ta∣thos</HI>
out of his Kingdom. He had no sooner
withdrawn himself, but another Competitor
started up, and march'd against <HI>Nectanebus</HI> with
an Army of an hundred thousand Men, who
shut him up in one of his Towns, and laid
Siege to it. When the Works were pretty
well advanc'd, and the Lines of Circumvalla∣tion
drawn almost round the Place, <HI>Nectanebus</HI>
threw himself among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and sally∣ing
<PB N="198" REF="224"/>
out by Night at the Gap where the Lines
were unfinished, drew up his Forces, and easily
routed those of the Enemy, who were entang∣led
and encompassed by their own Works.
This was owing intirely to the Advice and
Conduct of <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who improved this Vi∣ctory
by several others, 'till he had settled
<HI>Nectanebus</HI> in full and quiet Possession of the
Throne. <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates this Part differently,
as if <HI>Agesilaus</HI> had reconcil'd himself to <HI>Tachos,</HI>
and reinstated him in the Kingdom. But this
rests singly upon his Authority; and the other
Account is more natural, as well as more ge∣neral.
<HI>Agesilaus</HI> acquitted himself extremely well
as to the military Part of this Expedition; but
it does not in other Respects redound much
to his Honour. One chief Motive of his un∣dertaking
it, was Gain; which he cover'd un∣der
a pretence of supplying the Necessities of
the State. But the letting himself out to hire
to a Barbarian, and serving under an <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Rebel, as a Captain only of a Band of <HI>Mer∣cenaries,</HI>
was thought very unbecoming a <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
King, especially of his Age and Character.
He first made a mean Figure by entering into
that Service, and then a scandalous one by de∣serting
it, and joining with the Enemy of him,
whom he came to as an Auxiliary. He en∣deavour'd
to justify himself by several false Pre∣tences;
and, according to the common Plea of
the <HI>Spartans</HI> in the like Cases, call'd it Acting
<PB N="199" REF="225"/>
for the Benefit of his Country. But whatever
Name he gave it, it was certainly a foul Ac∣tion,
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> calls it downright Treachery.
And it was more so in him, because it was
purely his own Act, without being tied down
by any express Orders from the Government
of <HI>Sparta.</HI> The Winter following <HI>Nectanebus</HI>
dismiss'd him, with great Marks of Civility
and Gratitude for the Services he had done
him, and gave him two hundred and thirty
Talents of Silver, with which he sail'd home∣ward,
but was drove by Stress of Weather up∣on
a desart Shore of <HI>Africa,</HI> call'd <HI>The Haven
of Menelaus;</HI> where he sicken'd and died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death.</NOTE> being
full eighty four Years old, of which he had
reigned forty one.</P>
<P>He was so extraordinary a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Cha∣racter.</NOTE> and had so
many mixt Qualities, that besides what has
been already observ'd of him in the course of
the History, it may be proper to take a more
distinct View of him. He set out in the World
with strong Prejudices against him, both as to
his Person and his Pretensions. The first of
them he overcame by the Sprightliness of his
Air, and his Good-humour, with a way he
had of jesting upon himself, which prevented
others using the same Freedom with him.
However he was so sensible of his Defects, that
he would not suffer any Picture or Statue to be
made of him in his Life-time, and utterly for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id
the doing it after his Death. His Way
<PB N="200" REF="226"/>
to the Throne was attended with greater Dif∣ficulties,
which yet he got over by his Spirit
and Address, and by the Assistance of his
Friends, particularly of <HI>Lysander,</HI> who in effect
put the Crown upon his Head. And in that
respect, it was made a Charge of Ingratitude
upon <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> that he had afterwards upon a
slight Pretence thrown him off. But he him∣self
was the Cause of it; he valued himself too
much upon his Services to him; and his Beha∣viour
to him in <HI>Asia</HI> has been shewn to be
so arrogant and assuming, that it might very
well justify his sending him away from him,
when he found he could no longer act with
him. <HI>Lysander,</HI> full of Resentment, upon his
Return form'd a powerful Party against him;
to break which, he singled out the Ring-lea∣ders,
some of whom he sent away upon foreign
Services; others he got to be accused of Ava∣rice
and Injustice in their Employments; and
then made it his Business to bring them off,
thereby obliging them to become his Friends;
and so by degrees he wore out the Faction.
As he was a younger Son, he was bred up with
more Severity and Subjection, than the imme∣diate
Heirs of the Crown; and by the Obe∣dience
he paid to the Laws as a private Man,
he was better fitted for the Government, when
he came to it. He made great court to the
<HI>Ephori,</HI> and the Senate, even to a Shew of
Reverence, and by the Deference he paid to
<PB N="201" REF="227"/>
their Power, he secretly advanc'd his own, and
by that Means carried the Prerogative higher
than any of his Predecessors. But his Popula∣rity
grew at last suspected; insomuch that he is
said to have been fined by the <HI>Ephori</HI> for <HI>mono∣polizing</HI>
the Citizens, who were look'd upon as the
common Goods of the Republick. He was re∣markable
for his Continency and Moderation;
and kept up the old <HI>Spartan</HI> Plainness and Fru∣gality
even to Affectation, not allowing his Wife
and Daghter to distinguish themselves by their
Dress, and living in the same House that be∣long'd
to <HI>Aristodemus</HI> his Predecessor above seven
hundred Years before, nor suffering so much as
the Door of it to be repair'd. Yet notwith∣standing
this rigid Appearance, there was no∣thing
of Stiffness or Moroseness in his Behaviour;
he treated every Body with Candour and Affa∣bility,
and had such a Complacency and Agree∣ableness
in his Conversation, as made him ami∣able
to the last. He was very sond of his Chil∣dren,
and would often enter into their little Sports
with them. Being one Day surpriz'd by a Friend,
as he was riding with them on an Hobby-horse,
<HI>Say nothing of it,</HI> said he, <HI>till you are a Father
yourself.</HI> He was generous to his Enemies, not
detracting any thing from their due Merit, easily
forgiving, and never taking any unjust Advan∣tage
against them. On the other hand he was
too partial to his Friends, whom, in all Cases,
right or wrong, he thought himself oblig'd to
<PB N="202" REF="228"/>
support: Of which there is an Instance in a
Letter of his to <HI>Idrieus,</HI> Prince of <HI>Caria,</HI> where∣in
he says, <HI>If</HI> Nicias <HI>be innocent, acquit him; if
he be guilty, acquit him upon my account; however
be sure to acquit him.</HI> Of the same Kind was his
interposing in Behalf of <HI>Phaebidas</HI> and <HI>Sphodrias;</HI>
and yet the Consequence of it was, in a great
measure, the engaging <HI>Sparta</HI> in the <HI>Leuctrian</HI>
War. It was a Saying of his, <HI>That to be strait∣laced
in Point of Justice when one's Friend is con∣cerned,
is only a Pretence for deserting him.</HI> Yet
Nobody talk'd more of Justice upon other Oc∣casions
than he did; insomuch that some about
him expatiating one Day upon the Grandeur of
the King of <HI>Persia, Wherein,</HI> said <HI>Agesilaus, does
his Grandeur consist? Or how is he greater than I
am, if he be not more just?</HI> By which he would
have it understood, that Justice was the Rule of
all his Actions. But he has not given many In∣stances
of it, especially in his publick Character;
wherein he was so different from what he was
in his private Life, that he may be consider'd
as two different Persons. His Failings in the
latter were few, and, generally speaking, good-natur'd
ones; but in his Regal and Military
Capacity, his Passions were much stronger, and
his Faults more unpardonable. The same as∣piring
Temper which he discover'd from his
Childhood, and by which he afterwards usurp'd
the Crown, carried him on to the last Stage of
his Life, and bore down all other Considerations,
<PB N="203" REF="229"/>
that stood in the Way of his Ambition. And
yet he manag'd so well, that he pass'd the first
thirty Years of his Reign in great Honour and
Esteem: But as he advanc'd further in Years,
he grew more perverse and arbitrary, and withal
more restless and impatient, continually forming
new Schemes of Action, and never easy but in
War; and indeed he had admirable Talents for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. He was brave, active and vigilant; he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nur'd himself to the Extremes of Heat and Cold,
and far'd as hard, in other Respects, as a private
Centinel. He was very careful to keep up the
Courage of his Soldiers; for which Purpose he
would conceal, or lessen the News of a Defeat
in other Parts, or sometimes substitute the Report
of a Victory in the room of it. He had a more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efin'd way of deceiving his Enemies, by pub∣lishing
his real Design of a March or an Attack,
so that they might take it for a Feint, and con∣sequently
be unprepar'd for him. Nobody knew
better how to use the Advantages of Time and
Place, or to effect by Stratagem, what he could
not obtain by Force. And notwithstanding his
natural Impetuosity, he could command himself
upon Occasion, and was either cool and tempe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate,
or daring and desperate, according as the
Case requir'd; of which he gave sufficient Proofs
in his Defence of the City of <HI>Sparta.</HI> His Be∣haviour
upon that Occasion, when the Whole
was at Stake, was great and glorious; tho' it
must be allow'd at the same time, that he did
<PB N="204" REF="230"/>
nothing more than what he ow'd to his Country
whose Interests he had sacrificed to his implacable
Hatred of the <HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Messenians,</HI> and his
insatiable Thirst of Revenge. The <HI>Spartans</HI> were
so sensible of his Abilities, that when he was in
<HI>Asia,</HI> they constituted him Admiral as well as
General, which was an Honour they had never
before conferr'd on one single Person. His
Power after that Expedition encreasing in Pro∣portion
to the Opinion they had of him, he did
what he would with them, and brought them
into such a Condition, that they were forc'd to
rely upon him, and to stand or fall with him.
And tho' he sav'd them from immediate De∣struction,
he had sufficiently drain'd and harass'd
them, and left them in a miserable declining
State. <HI>Lysander</HI> gave the first Shock to their
Power by his Pride, and <HI>Agesilaus</HI> quite broke
it by his Obstinacy; the first made them odious
to their Neighbours, and the latter made them
contemptible. And upon the Whole, it may be
said, that <HI>Sparta</HI> ow'd her Downfal to the two
greatest Men she ever bred.</P>
<P>The Death of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> and the Peace
which ensu'd upon it, had slacken'd the Zeal of
the principal Powers of <HI>Greece,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The indo∣lent State of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> and render'd 'em
too secure. The <HI>Athenians</HI> more particularly,
when they found themselves deliver'd from him
who kept up their Emulation, grew indolent
and remiss, and abandon'd themselves to their
Ease and Pleasure, being wholly taken up with
<PB N="205" REF="231"/>
Shews, Sports and Festivals. They were natu∣rally
too much addicted to these Sorts of Amuse∣ment,
and they had formerly been encourag'd in
them by <HI>Pericles,</HI> who knew how to lead them
by their Inclinations, and took this Method to
ingratiate himself with them, and to divert them
from inspecting too narrowly into his Admini∣stration.
But they now carried these Diversions
to a much higher Pitch of Extravagance. They
had such a Passion for the Stage, that it stifled
in them all other Thoughts, either of Business, or
of Glory. Poets and Players were become their
only Favourites, and receiv'd the Esteem and
Applause, that was due to the Captains who
had fought their Battles. The very victualling
of their Fleets and Armies was consum'd upon
the Stage. Their Singers and Dancers were
pamper'd up with Marrow and other luscious
Food, whilst the Admiral and the Captains of
the Ships had no other Provisions on board, but
Meal, Cheese and Onions. In short, the Deco∣rations,
and other Charges attending the Theatre,
were so excessive, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, <HI>It cost more
to represent some of the famous Pieces of</HI> Sophocles
<HI>and</HI> Euripides, <HI>than it had done to carry on the
War against the Barbarians.</HI> And in order to
support this Charge, they seiz'd upon the Fund
which had been set apart for the War, with a
Prohibition, upon Pain of Death, even to advise
the applying it to any other Purpose. They
not only revers'd this Decree, but went as far
<PB N="206" REF="232"/>
the other way, making it death to propose th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
restoring the Fund to the Uses, to which
had before been appropriated, under the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Penalties. By diverting the Course of the Sup∣plies
in so extraordinary a manner, and enter
taining the idle Citizen at the Expence of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Soldier and Mariner, they seem'd to have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Remains of that Spirit and Vigour, which they
had exerted in the <HI>Persian</HI> Wars, when they de∣molish'd
their Houses to furnish out a Navy, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
when the Women stoned a Man to death, who
propos'd to appease the <HI>Great King,</HI> (as he was
call'd) by paying Tribute, and doing Homag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to him.</P>
<P>But whilst they were wrapt up in this slothful
Security, and had nothing immediately to ap∣prehend
from their old Enemies, either in <HI>Greece</HI>
or <HI>Persia,</HI> they found themselves on a sudden
engag'd with a People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which the</HI> Macedoni∣ans <HI>take ad∣vantage of.</HI></NOTE> who were hitherto ob∣scure,
and in a manner barbarous. These were
the <HI>Macedonians;</HI> who, tho' they were hardy,
and warlike enough, had never yet presum'd to
intermeddle in the Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI> The Truth
is, they had enough to do at home, to adjust the
Quarrels about the Succession of their Kings, and
to defend themselves against the <HI>Illyrians, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o∣nians,</HI>
and other powerful Neighbours. But se∣veral
Circumstances concur'd at this Time to raise
them out of their Obscurity, and to bring them
into a new Scene of Action; which by Degrees
wrought such a thorough Change in the State of
<PB N="207" REF="233"/>
<HI>Greece,</HI> that it will be necessary to take a cursory
View of their Affairs, and to consider them con∣nectedly
with those of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> at least so
far as may serve to shew, by what Steps this
Change was effected.</P>
<P>They may also upon another Account seem to
require a Place in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Story;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How far they may be consider'd as Greci∣ans.</NOTE> for their
first Kings were of <HI>Grecian</HI> Extraction. But they
are not so much entitled to it from their Descent,
as from their Exploits, by which the very Name
of <HI>Greece</HI> was in a great measure lost, and swal∣low'd
up in that of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> Before their
later Atchievements, which brought about this
great Revolution, they were no otherwise consi∣der'd
as a Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> than many other Bor∣derers,
who were originally planted from thence,
but having afterwards little or no Intercourse with
their Mother-Country, contracted the Habits and
Manners of the Natives where they settled, and
from thence were look'd upon as one and the
same People with them, and in the same Degree
of Barbarism. This was the Case of most of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies: And therefore, tho' I have had
frequent occasion to mention them, I have not
enter'd further into their Story, than as it has
born relation to <HI>Greece,</HI> either on account of their
Wars or Alliances with it, or of their being pro∣tected
by it, or becoming tributary to it, or of
such other Engagements and Dependences, as
have blended their Affairs with those of the <HI>Gre
cians,</HI> and made the Relation of them a necessary
<PB N="208" REF="234"/>
Part of their History. Thus much may suffice
to account for my not having treated the most
remarkable of these Colonies so fully and distinct∣ly,
as might be expected from the Figure they
have made in the World; such as <HI>Sicily, Crete,</HI>
and some others of the Islands, with the <HI>Lesser
Asia,</HI> and several other Parts of the Continent.
But it ought to be consider'd, that where their
Fame and Grandeur has been owing more to
their Transactions with other People, than with
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> most of the Particulars concerning
them do not fall within the Compass of my De∣sign,
but belong more properly to a separate
History of their own, or to that of the Nation,
which they have had most to do with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were so call'd before the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
intermix'd with them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ori∣ginal.</NOTE> And they were some
time known by other Names, which they receiv'd
from the first Planters, or principal Men either
of the whole Country, or of some particular
Parts of it. But the Accounts we have of these
original Founders, like those of the <HI>Grecian</HI> States,
are very fabulous and imperfect. The first who
is mention'd, with any Degree of Certainty, to
have reign'd in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> was <HI>Caranus,</HI> by Birth
an <HI>Argive,</HI> and said to be the sixteenth in Descent
from <HI>Hercules.</HI> It was upon this Foundation,
that <HI>Philip</HI> grounded his Pretensions to be of the
Race of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and assum'd to himself Divine
Honours; wherein he carried his Vanity a great
way, tho' not so far as his Son did after him.
<PB N="209" REF="235"/>
<HI>Caranus</HI> therefore is commonly reputed to have
led forth a Body of his Countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Kings.</NOTE> by the Ad∣vice
of the Oracle, into these Parts, where he
settled, and made himself King. And yet <HI>He∣rodotus,</HI>
contrary to the Opinion of all the later
Writers, makes <HI>Perdiccas</HI> the first King. <HI>Sir
Isaac Newton</HI> reconciles this Difference by a very
probable Conjecture, that they were Joint-Found∣ers
of this Kingdom; that they were both con∣temporary,
and of the Royal Family of <HI>Argos,</HI>
from whence they fled about the same Time, and
at first erected small Principalities in <HI>Macedonia,</HI>
which, after the Death of <HI>Caranus,</HI> became one
under <HI>Perdiccas:</HI> and that this Kingdom was
founded about the 46th or 47th <HI>Olympiad.</HI> From
this Time the <HI>Macedonians</HI> were properly a <HI>Gre∣cian</HI>
Colony; and, among other Proofs of their
being so, it is observable, that <HI>Amyntas,</HI> which
was the Name of some of their succeeding Kings,
was also a common Name among the <HI>Argives.</HI>
Another of their Kings was, by virtue of their
<HI>Grecian</HI> Extraction, admitted to the <HI>Olympick</HI>
Games. But whatever Rights and Privileges this
Nation claim'd as <HI>Grecians,</HI> they were generally
treated as <HI>Barbarians,</HI> till such time as they car∣ried
their Arms into <HI>Asia,</HI> and had trampled upon
the Liberties of <HI>Greece. Caranus</HI> having, accord∣ing
to the general Account, reign'd twenty-eight
Years, the Succession was continu'd after him to
the Times we are now treating of. But there is
very little worth Notice recorded of these Kings,
<PB N="210" REF="236"/>
they being chiefly employ'd in defending them∣selves
against the Incursions of their Neighbours:
And as to their domestick Affairs, they were re∣markable
only for the frequent Murthers and U∣surpations,
which happen'd in the Royal Fa∣mily.</P>
<P><HI>Amynlas</HI> the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amyntas Father of Philip.</NOTE> who was the Sixteenth in
Descent from <HI>Caranus,</HI> and the Father of that
<HI>Philip</HI> whom we are now to treat of, had much
ado to support himself in the Throne; he left
it in a very tottering Condition, and entail'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
War with the <HI>Illyrians</HI> and <HI>Olynthians</HI> upon his
Children. By his Wife <HI>Eurydice</HI> he left three
Sons, who all in their turn succeeded to their Fa∣ther,
<HI>Alexander, Perdiccas</HI> and <HI>Philip;</HI> he had
also a natural Son, call'd <HI>Ptolemy Alorites.</HI> Some
say, he had a second Wife, call'd <HI>Gygaea,</HI> and by
her had three more Sons, <HI>Archelaus, Argaeus</HI> or
<HI>Archideus,</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who were murder'd by
<HI>Philip.</HI> But this does not seem probable, be∣cause
<HI>Eurydice</HI> appears to have surviv'd <HI>Amyntas,</HI>
and to have been very active in the succeeding
Reigns. The Succession of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Per∣diccas</HI>
was strongly oppos'd; first by <HI>Pausanias,</HI>
whose Father and himself had before usurp'd the
Crown, and then by their Brother <HI>Plolemy,</HI> who
is said to have murder'd <HI>Alexander,</HI> and to have
reign'd three Years upon his Death, till he was
afterwards slain himself by <HI>Perdiccas. Pausanias</HI>
was drove out by <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> who at this Time
happen'd to be sent by the <HI>Athenians</HI> with a small
<PB N="211" REF="237"/>
Fleet into those Parts, to make the necessary
Dispositions for the Siege of <HI>Amphipolis. Eury∣dice,</HI>
upon this Occasion, accosted him in a very
moving manner: She brought her two Sons <HI>Per∣diccas</HI>
and <HI>Philip</HI> to him, and putting one of 'em
between his Arms, and the other upon his Knee,
conjur'd him, by the mutual Friendship that had
pass'd between the two Nations, and by the per∣sonal
Kindness and Affection that her Husband
had born to him, that he would take these two
Orphans into his Protection, and defend them
against the Invader. But this Account of her
Maternal Affection is by no means consistent with
that which <HI>Justin</HI> gives of her, That being in
love with her Son-in-law, who is understood to
be <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> she caus'd her own two Sons <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
and <HI>Perdiccas</HI> to be murder'd, in order to
advance him to the Throne; and that she had
before attempted to destroy her Husband with
the same View. But the History of these two
Kings, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> is so confus'd,
that not only the Transactions of one Reign seem
to be ascrib'd to another, but the Transactions
themselves are also differently related. As to
<HI>Ptolemy,</HI> the most plausible Account given of him,
is, that upon his Competition with <HI>Perdiccas,</HI>
they referr'd themselves to <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> who ad∣judging
the Crown to the latter, the other quitted
his Pretensions: And <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> for the better
Observance of this Agreement, carried <HI>Philip</HI>
with him, among others, as Hostage to <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="238"/>
There are other Occasions mention'd of his being
given as an Hostage to the <HI>Illyrians,</HI> both by his
Father, and his Brother <HI>Alexander.</HI> However
that be, it is certain he was at <HI>Thebes</HI> at the Time
of the Death of his Brother <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> who, ac∣cording
to the most general Accounts, was kill'd
in a Battle with the <HI>Illyrians.</HI></P>
<P>This Accident brought him home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of Philip.</NOTE> and gave
him an Opportunity of exerting those Talents,
by which he not only surpass'd all his Prede∣cessors,
but eclips'd the Fame of all the <HI>Grecians</HI>
of his Time; tho' it must be confess'd, that he
receiv'd his first Impressions of Glory from 'em,
and that he ow'd a great deal to the Improve∣ments
he made under <HI>Epaminondas.</HI> But besides
these Advantages, he had great natural Endow∣ments,
and a Genius equal to the greatest De∣signs;
as may sussiciently appear from the Diffi∣culties
he had to encounter at his first setting out,
when he was scarce three and twenty Years old, and
the Means he us'd to overcome them. <HI>Perdiccas</HI>
had left a young Son to succeed him; so that
<HI>Philip</HI> had no immediate Prospect of coming to
the Crown. However, upon the News of his
Brother's Death, he stole home privately from
<HI>Thebes,</HI> and taking Advantage of the Consterna∣tion
the People were under, and the Dangers
they apprehended from an Insant-Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A M. 3645. Olymp. 105. 1. <HI>He is de∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d King</HI></NOTE> got
himself at first declar'd Protector to his Nephew,
and soon after King in his stead. And indeed
the present Condition of the <HI>Macedonians</HI> requir'd
<PB N="213" REF="239"/>
a Man of his Prudence and Activity: For they
were surrounded with as many Enemies, as they
had Neighbours. The <HI>Illyrians</HI> flush'd with their
late Victory, were preparing to march against
them with a strong Army; the <HI>Paeonians</HI> were
making daily Incursions upon them; and at the
same Time the Title to the Crown was contested
by <HI>Pausanias</HI> and <HI>Argaeus,</HI> the former whereof
was supported by the <HI>Thracians,</HI> and the latter
by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who for that Purpose had sent
out a good Fleet, and three thousand Land
Men.</P>
<P>Under these Circumstaces, with so many E∣nemies
on his Hands at once, and that before
he was settled in the Throne, his first Part was,
to make sure of his own People, to gain
their Affections, and to raise their Spirits; for they
were very much dishearten'd, having lost above
four thousand Men in the late Action with the
<HI>Illyrians.</HI> He succeeded in these Points by the
Artfulness of his Address, and the Force of his
Eloquence, of which he was a great Master.
His next Step was to train and exercise them, and
reform their Discipline; and it was at this Time,
that he instituted the famous <HI>Macedonian Phalanx,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He irsti∣tutes the <HI>Macedo∣nian</HI> Pha∣lanx.</NOTE> 
which did so much Execution. It was an Im∣provement
upon the ancient Manner of fighting
among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who generally drew up their
Foot so close, as to stand the Shock of the Ene∣my
without being broken. The compleat Pha∣lanx
was thought to contain above sixteen thou∣sand
<PB N="214" REF="240"/>
Men; tho' it was also taken in general for
any Company, or Party of Soldiers, and fre∣quently
for the whole Body of the Foot. But this
of <HI>Philip's</HI> Invention, is describ'd by <HI>Polybius</HI> to
be a long Square, consisting of eight thousand
Pikemen, sixteen deep, and five hundred in Front,
the Men standing so close together, that the Pikes
of the fifth Rank were extended three Foot be∣yond
the Line of the Front. The rest, whose
Distance from the Front made their Pikes useless,
rested them upon the Shoulders of those who
stood before them, and so locking them together
in File, press'd forwards to support and push on
the former Ranks, whereby the Asfault was ren∣der'd
more violent and irresistible.</P>
<P>In this Year died <HI>Xenophon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenophon his Death, and Cha∣racter.</NOTE> and in the nine∣tieth
Year of his Age. Notwithstanding the
Glory he had acquir'd by his <HI>Persian</HI> Expedition,
he was banish'd <HI>Athens</HI> for having been engag'd
in it: For <HI>Cyrus</HI> having been too great a Fa∣vourer
of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> did not
think he ought to receive any Countenance or
Assistance from them in the Quarrel with his
Brother <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI> Thereupon <HI>Xenophon</HI> chose
to return again into <HI>Persia,</HI> where he join'd <HI>Age∣silaus;</HI>
and there they contracted a strict Friend∣ship,
which continu'd as long as they liv'd. Up∣on
which of these two Expeditions it was, that
the Sentence of Banishment was pass'd against
him, is not determin'd: But he had by both of
them incurr'd the Displeasure of his Fellow∣Citizens,
<PB N="215" REF="241"/>
who look'd upon him as not being well
affected to the Interest of his Country. He has
not by his Actions given any Marks of his En∣mity
against it: But it is certain, that he was a
great Admirer of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Manners and Con∣stitution,
and had a very indifferent Opinion of
the <HI>Athenian Democracy.</HI> Upon his second Re∣turn
into <HI>Greece,</HI> he resided at <HI>Scillonte,</HI> a Town
in the <HI>Elean</HI> Territory, but at that Time under
the Dominion of <HI>Sparta.</HI> But upon the Inva∣sion
of <HI>Laconia</HI> by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> he quitted that
Neighbourhood, and retir'd to <HI>Corinth,</HI> where he
spent the Remainder of his Days. It is to the
Leisure he enjoy'd in these Places of Retreat,
that we owe most of his Historical and other
Writings; by which he appears to have possess'd
more different Talents, and to have been more
thoroughly accomplish'd, than any Man of his
Time, not only as a Captain, Philosopher, Ora∣tor
and Historian, but being likewise well skill'd
in Politicks, in Horsemanship and Hunting, in
Tillage and Planting. He had also the Advan∣tage
of a very beautiful Person, with a pleasing
Aspect, which bespoke that Candour and Sim∣plicity,
for which he was so remarkable, both in
his Manners and his Writings.</P>
<P>His Character as an Historian having already
been describ'd in the Account I have given of
the Authors, from whom this History is collected,
I will here only add an Observation, that he was
the first Philosopher in <HI>Greece,</HI> who wrote an
<PB N="216" REF="242"/>
History. And to this it may be ascrib'd,
that he has express'd Nature better than most
other Historians of his Time: His Conceptions
were clear, and that made his Diction so. This
regular way of thinking, and digesting his Mat∣ter,
he learnt of <HI>Socrates,</HI> under whom he studied.
Nothing is more to be admir'd in him, than the
Affection he bore to his Master. And in this
Part <HI>Plato</HI> agreed with him; but there was o∣therwise
no good Understanding between them:
Which is the more extraordinary, because they
were both equally of a mild and amiable Dis∣position,
and had no Enemies, but such as their
Virtue had created them. The Cause assign'd
by <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> for their Disagreement,
was a Rivalship in their Writings; and in sup∣prot
of this Opinion, it is said, that <HI>Xenophon</HI>
wrote his <HI>Cyripaedia,</HI> as the Picture of a just Mo∣narchy,
in Opposition to that which <HI>Plato</HI> had
drawn of a perfect Common-wealth. It is a
Question among the Learned, how far this Piece
of <HI>Xenophon</HI> will bear being examin'd according
to the strict Rules of History; and whether it
ought not rather to be look'd upon only as a
more modest and instructive Species of Romance.
There is likewise great Allowance to be made
for his Character of <HI>Ageslaus,</HI> which is too much
in the Stile of Panegyrick. But his close Inti∣macy
with that Prince, had made him partial
to his Failings. He extols his personal Bravery,
and his other private Virtues, and very justly:
<PB N="217" REF="243"/>
But he does not consider him enough in his pub∣lick
Capacity, as one, who, upon the Merit of
his Services, had got more Power into his Hands,
than was usually allow'd to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings,
and, by his Rashness and Obstinacy, had made
an ill use of it, almost to the Destruction of his
Country.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> had made some proper Regula∣tion
of his Affairs at home, he began to look
abroad, in order to divert the Storms which
threaten'd him from all Quarters. By Mony
and Promises he made up Matters, for the pre∣sent,
with such of his Enemies, as lay nearest
to him, and then turn'd his Forces against the
<HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip de∣feats the Athenians.</NOTE> who were march'd up to <HI>Methone,</HI> to
assist <HI>Argaeus.</HI> He gave them Battle, and de∣feated
them; and the Death of <HI>Argaeus,</HI> who
was kill'd in the Action, put an End to that
Dispute: For he permitted the <HI>Athenians,</HI> when
they were in his Power, to return home. This
Instance of his Moderation gain'd so far upon
them, that they soon after concluded a Peace
with him; which yet he observ'd no longer,
than it serv'd his Design of securing the other
Part of his Dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly he march'd Northward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 2. Subdues the Paeonians, and the Il∣lyrians.</NOTE> where
he broke with the <HI>Paeonians,</HI> and subdu'd them;
then fell upon the <HI>Illyrains,</HI> and having kill'd
above seven thousand of them in a pitch'd Battle,
oblig'd them to restore all their Conquests in
<HI>Macedonia.</HI> He had also shut up the Passage of
<PB N="218" REF="244"/>
the <HI>Thracians;</HI> but yet did not think it suffici∣ently
secur'd, without making himself Master of
<HI>Amphipolis,</HI> which was very commodiously situ∣ated
on the River <HI>Strymon,</HI> and was the <HI>Key</HI> of
that Side of his Dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seizes Am∣phipolis.</NOTE> He knew the Im∣portance
of it, and therefore possess'd himself of
it in the Beginning of his Reign. This was the
Grounds of his Quarrel with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
claim'd it as one of their Colonies, and made
such a Point of it, that their setting up <HI>Argaeus</HI>
against him, was not so much for his own Sake,
or for the Credit of imposing a King upon the
<HI>Macedonians,</HI> as it was with a View to get the
City restor'd to them by his Means, in case he
should have succeeded in his Pretensions. <HI>Philip</HI>
was sensible of their Drift; and finding it ne∣cessary
at that Time to keep some Measures with
them, would neither keep the Place himself, nor
let them have it, but took a middle Course, and
declar'd it a Free City, thereby leaving the In∣habitants
to throw off their Dependence on their
old Masters, and making it appear to be their
own Act. But the City continu'd no longer in
this State, than till he found himself at liberty to
make a more thorough Conquest of it; which at
this Time he easily effected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 3.</NOTE> thro' the Remissness
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who refus'd to send any Relief
to it, alledging in their Excuse, that it would be
a Breach of the Peace, which they had con∣cluded
with <HI>Philip</HI> the Year before. But the
Truth is, he trick'd them out of it, by a Pro∣mise
<PB N="219" REF="245"/>
of delivering it up to them: But instead of
keeping his Word with them, he made further
Encroachments, by seizing on <HI>Pydna</HI> and <HI>Poti∣dea;</HI>
the latter of which being garrison'd by <HI>A∣tbenians,</HI>
he drew them out, and sent them home;
but dismiss'd them with such Marks of Civility, as
shew'd, that he avoided coming to an open Rupture
with that State, at least till his Designs were more
ripe for it, tho' at the same time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his
Neighbourhood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pydna and Potidaea,</NOTE> <HI>Pydna,</HI> with the Territory be∣longing
to it, he gave up to the <HI>Olynthians,</HI> who
were his Father's inverterate Enemies. His Hands
were too full at this time to revive the Quarrel
against so rich and powerful a City, whcih, for
three Years together, had withstood the united
Forces of <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Macedonia;</HI> he therefore
chose to buy their Friendship for the present, and
to amuse them by the Delivery of this Town, as
he had done the <HI>Athenians</HI> by the Peace, till he
could attack them at more Advantage. In this
Step also he over-reach'd the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were
at the same time courting the Alliance of the
<HI>Olynthians,</HI> in order to maintain their sooting in
those Parts. Which Side soever the <HI>Olynthians</HI>
inclin'd to, they were strong enough to turn
the Balance; and therefore the gaining them
became a Matter of great Contention between
<HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Athenians.</HI></P>
<P>The next Place he took,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Creni∣dae, which be called Philippi.</NOTE> was <HI>Crenidae,</HI> which
he enlarg'd, and call'd, after his own Name,
<PB N="220" REF="246"/>
<HI>Philippi,</HI> and which afterwards was famous for
the defeat of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius.</HI> There were
near this Town some gold Mines, which he
work'd, and drew out of them an immense
Treasure. The yearly Produce of them amount∣ed
to a thousand Talents; which was reckon'd
at that time considerably more than the Re∣venue
of <HI>Athens;</HI> and yet that was thought
the richest State in <HI>Greece.</HI> This was a very
lucky Discovery for one, who knew the Va∣lue
and Use of Mony so well as he did. He
was by this means enabled to keep up a good
Body of mercenary Troops at home, with a
great Number of Spies and Pensioners abroad;
and it was to this Fund, that he ow'd a great
Part of the Successes of his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> in this Progress of his Affairs, met
with little Opposition from the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
had enough to do to support their Jurisdiction
in other Parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in Eubaea compos'd by the Athe∣nians.</NOTE> <HI>Euboea</HI> being at this time di∣vided
into Factions, one Party had recourse to
them, and the other to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who by this
means got footing in the Island. But the <HI>A∣thenians</HI>
thought it of too great Importance
to them to be given up: For, besides
other Advantages, they had formerly drawn a
large Revenue from it. However they did not
exert themselves so vigorously as the Case re∣quir'd,
'till they were spirited up by <HI>Timotheus.
What?</HI> said he, <HI>The</HI> Thebans <HI>in</HI> Eubaea, <HI>and
you still here! They are in Action, and you are
<PB N="221" REF="247"/>
deliberating. You have not spread the Seas with
your Shipping; you are not running down to the</HI>
Piraeus; <HI>you are not under Sail.</HI> This Manner
of haranguing had the Effect he propos'd: In
five Days time they made the necessary Prepa∣rations,
and put to Sea; forc'd the <HI>Thebans</HI>
off the Island; compos'd the Differences of the
Inhabitants, and brought them again under their
Dependence. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> takes particular no∣tice
of this Speech of <HI>Timotheus,</HI> and quotes this
Part of it, as an Incentive to the <HI>Athenians</HI>
upon a like Occasion, when <HI>Philip</HI> was over∣running
their Dominions in <HI>Thrace.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> had no sooner put an end to
these Disturbances, but <HI>Byzantium,</HI> with the
Islands of <HI>Chios, Cos</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Social War.</NOTE> revolted, and
confederated against them, and from thence
gave rise to that which was call'd <HI>The War of the
Allies,</HI> or <HI>The Social War.</HI> They forthwith sent out
<HI>Chares</HI> and <HI>Chabrias,</HI> with Men and Shipping, to
reduce them. Their first Attempt was upon
<HI>Chios;</HI> where <HI>Chabrias,</HI> who commanded at Sea,
forc'd his Entrance into the Harbour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon <HI>Chi∣os.</HI></NOTE> but being
deserted by the rest of the Fleet, which put
back to Sea, he was immediately surrounded
by the Enemy, who beat upon him on all
sides 'till his Ship was quite disabled, and pierc'd
through with the Enemies Beaks. Whereupon
the Men on board leap'd into the Sea to save
themselves by swimming: But he not thinking
<PB N="222" REF="248"/>
it consistent with his Honour and the Duty
of his Post, to quit his Ship, stood obstinately
in the Defence of it, 'till he was mortally
wounded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chabrias kill'd:</NOTE> <HI>Nepos</HI> says, contrary to the general
Account of this Expedition, that he served in
it only as a private Man; which, if it were
so, would be the best Excuse that could be
made for his Conduct in it: For considering
him as a Commander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> it was certainly too un∣concerted,
and too rash and desperate an Enter∣prise
to be justified. But it was agreeable to
a Maxim of his own, <HI>That an Army of Stags
led by a Lion, was more formidable than an Ar∣my
of Lions led by a Stag.</HI> He had another
Maxim, which shew'd more Prudence and Cir∣cumspection,
<HI>That He was the best Commander,
who knew best what his Enemies were doing.</HI>
However, the Spirit he shew'd upon this Oc∣casion,
with the many other Instances of his
Bravery and Zeal for the Service of his Coun∣try,
may be sufficient to rank him with the
Patriots of the best Ages of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chares,</HI> with the Land-Forces, had made
some slight Attacks upon the Island; but upon
the Death of his Colleague he drew them off,
and put an end to the Campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 4.</NOTE> But the
next Year great Preparations were made on both
Sides for prosecuting the War with Vigour.
And the Allies having got together a Fleet
of an hundred Sail, harass'd and plunder'd se∣veral
of the Islands under the Dominion of
<PB N="223" REF="249"/>
<HI>Athens,</HI> and then besieg'd <HI>Samos.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Samos be∣sieg'd by the Allies.</NOTE> The <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
sent out <HI>Chares</HI> again with sixty Gallies,
and then reinforc'd them with sixty more un∣der
the Command of <HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus,</HI>
who were join'd in Commission with him.
They united their Forces, and agreed to be∣siege
<HI>Byzantium;</HI> which drew the Allies from
Samos to relieve it. Hereupon the two Fleets
met in the <HI>Hellespont:</HI> But just as they were
ready to engage, there happen'd a violent Storm;
notwithstanding which, <HI>Chares</HI> propos'd to pro∣ceed
and join Battle, but could not prevail
with his Colleagues to come into it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chares ac∣cuses his Colleagues of Treache∣ry</NOTE>, whereupon
he wrote to <HI>Athens</HI> to accuse them of Trea∣chery;
and they were recall'd, and order'd to
answer it to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Chares</HI> was now at liberty to act without
Controul; but instead of pursuing his Designs
against the Islanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and goes into Foreign Service.</NOTE> he went over to <HI>Artaba∣zus</HI>
the <HI>Persian</HI> Governor of some of the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Asia minor,</HI> who had revolted from his
Master, and was reduced almost to the last
Extremity by an Army of seventy thousand
Men which was sent out against him. <HI>Chares,</HI>
upon a Promise of being well rewarded, enga∣ged
to assist him; and having accordingly join'd
their Forces, they deseated the <HI>Persians.</HI> But
the King was so incens'd at it, that he threat∣en'd
to fit out a Fleet of three hundred Sail
to support the Islanders in their War with the
<HI>Athenians;</HI> which so intimidated them, that they
<PB N="224" REF="250"/>
clapt up a Peace with the Allies upon their
own Terms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 106. 1. A Peace with the Allies.</NOTE> which were, <HI>That for the future
they should remain free and independent.</HI> This
put an end to the <HI>Social War,</HI> which had con∣tinued
three Years, tho' with very little Action
on either Side, at least not suitable to the Pre∣parations
that were made for it.</P>
<P>The News of this Expedition of <HI>Chares</HI> was
at first very well receiv'd by the Government
of <HI>Athens,</HI> in regard the Troops which were
employ'd in it, were paid by <HI>Artabazus;</HI> and
that indeed was the only pretence that could
be made for undertaking it: But when they
found in what manner the <HI>Persian</HI> King re∣sented
it, they made it a Charge of Treason
against <HI>Chares</HI> for having exceeded his Com∣mission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chares ac∣cus'd, but acquitted.</NOTE> and deserted the Service of his Coun∣try.
However he found means to secure a
Party among the People, who brought him
off.</P>
<P><HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI> were more hardly
dealt with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iphicrates and Ti∣motheus tried.</NOTE> and for that which had much les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Appearance of a Crime, in refusing to
join with him in rushing headlong upon the
Enemy in a Storm, and combating the Ele∣ments.
But this Matter was so aggravated by
<HI>Chares,</HI> that they underwent a formal Trial
for it, and, besides the revoking their Com∣missions,
had an heavy Fine impos'd on them.
This is the Account <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> gives of
it: But the Fact is by others related differently,
<PB N="225" REF="251"/>
and with more remarkable Circumstances;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timothe∣us fined.</NOTE> That
<HI>Timotheus</HI> was fined an hundred Talents; which
being unable to pay, he withdrew himself to
<HI>Chalcis,</HI> where he died. The People soon after
repenting of their Usage of him, (as it was
generally the Case with them, when it was too
late) remitted nine Parts of the Fine, but ex∣acted
the other ten Talents of his Son <HI>Conon</HI>
towards the Repair of their Walls. It was an
odd Circumstance, and a Reproach to <HI>Athens,</HI>
that those Walls, which had been rebuilt by
<HI>Conon</HI> the Grandfather, out of the Spoils l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had
taken from the Enemy, should now be re∣pair'd
by a Fine unjustly rais'd upon <HI>Conon</HI> the
Grandson.</P>
<P><HI>Iphicrates</HI> apprehending the same Fate with
<HI>Timotheus,</HI> had introduced a Number of young
Men into the Court, arm'd with Daggers,
which they every now and then, in the course
of the Trial, took care to expose to the View
of his Judges, in order to intimidate them.
This Menace had the Effect he propos'd, and
accordingly he was acquitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hicrates acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tted.</NOTE> Being after∣wards
reproach'd with so violent a Proceeding,
he said, <HI>It would have been a Madness in him,
if, after having succeeded in War for his Fel∣low-Citizens,
he should not have endeavour'd to
do the same for himself.</HI> And certainly, what∣ever
Insult it was upon the publick Justice, it
was owing to the People themselves, who, by
their capricious, jealous and ungratesul Behavi∣our
<PB N="226" REF="252"/>
towards their Generals, had forc'd them to
these Extremities. For whatever their Conduct
were, they never knew when they were safe. They
were no longer regarded, than they were want∣ed;
and when their Service was over, it was
approv'd or censur'd, according as the Faction
for or against them prevail'd: In short they
lay at the Mercy of every little designing <HI>De∣magogue,</HI>
who had Art enough to inflame the
Multitude. Under these Discouragements, it is
not to be wonder'd at, that many of them
engag'd themselves in Foreign Service, or went
into a voluntary Exile; insomuch that there
were scarce any left to command at home.
This is to be look'd upon as one principal
Cause of the Decay of the Power of <HI>Athens,</HI>
which began now too visibly to appear. <HI>Ne∣pos</HI>
seems to fix it to this Period of Time, and
observes, that <HI>Chabrias, Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timo∣theus</HI>
were the last of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Captains.
However, it must be confess'd, there were seve∣ral
considerable Men after them, who occasio∣nally
signaliz'd themselves in the Defence, or
other necessary Service of their Country: But
it is certain, there was not any Number, or
regular Succession of such, as were able to keep
up the ancient Spirit and Discipline of the
Troops, or the Grandeur of the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>As
to <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> whether, after his Trial, he
declined the Service, or was laid aside by the
<PB N="227" REF="253"/>
State, we hear no more of his being employ'd
either at home, or abroad; and yet he is said
to have liv'd to a good old Age. However
<HI>Diodorus</HI> says, he was dead, when the great
Battle of <HI>Cehronêa</HI> was fought in the hundred
and tenth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> but without mentioning
the Time and Circumstances of his Death;
and therefore we may reasonably suppose, that
he spent the Remainder of his Days in some
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bscure Retirement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Iphicra∣tes.</NOTE> But whatever became of
him, he was at this time a great Loss to the
Publick. He had served on many Occasions,
and generally with Success; which was chiefly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing to his Skill and Prudence; and his Ser∣vice
had been very useful and seasonable. He
was not so much noted for the Fame of his
Exploits, as for his Art and Improvements in
the military Discipline, wherein he was very
exact, and withal severe. He was always up∣on
his Guard, and left as little room for Ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idents
as possible. To this purpose, when one
ask'd him, why he fortify'd his Camp, which
he had pitch'd in a Country belonging to his
Confederates, he replied, <HI>The worst Speech a
General can make, is, I did not think.</HI> His Men
were so perfect in their Exercise, and so obe∣dient
to Command, that when the Word was
given to engage, they knew their Business,
and did it of themselves, as if every private
Man had been directed by the ablest Ossicer.
This was particularly experienc'd in the War
<PB N="228" REF="254"/>
at <HI>Corinth,</HI> where he put a stop to the Pro∣gress
of <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> who would otherwise have
over-run the States, which were then in Alli
ance with <HI>Athens.</HI> The Men who served un∣der
him, were known by the Name of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Iphicratensian Troops,</HI> and were in the same
degree of Esteem in <HI>Greece,</HI> as the <HI>Fabian</HI> Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
diers were in <HI>Rome.</HI> He compared the seve∣ral
Parts of an Army to those of an human
Body, making the light-arm'd Infantry answer
to the Hands, the Cavalry to the Feet, the
main Body to the Breast, and the General t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Head. He chang'd the Fashion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Arms and Accoutrements then in use, contri∣ving
them chiefly for Ease and Expedition
and after such a manner, as should most ef∣fectually
answer the Ends either of annoying
or guarding against the Enemy. But notwith
standing these Proofs of his Diligence and Ap∣plication,
he is said to have been naturally in
dolent and impatient; which does not seen
very consistent with the Character of a Man
who had work'd his way into the World, and
rais'd himself from nothing: For he was of
very mean Extraction; some say, a Shoema∣ker's
Son; and yet he carried it off with
good Air, when being reproach'd with it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one of his Adversaries who was descended fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Harmodius,</HI> 'Tis true, said he, <HI>The Lustre of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

you.</HI> The first thing that brought him in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="229" REF="255"/>
Repute, was, that in an Action wherein he
was wounded, he caught up one of his Enc∣mies,
and carried him alive, and in his Ar∣mour,
to his own Ship. Besides the Advance∣ment
he made by his personal Merit, he had
the good Fortune to obtain in Marriage a
Daughter of <HI>Cotys</HI> King of <HI>Thrace,</HI> by whom
he had a Son call'd <HI>Menestheus;</HI> who yet seem'd
to value himself more upon being the Son of
an <HI>Alhenian</HI> Captain, than of a <HI>Thracian</HI> Prin∣cess:
For being ask'd, <HI>To which of his Parents
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ow'd the greatest Obligation;</HI> he
answer'd, <HI>To my Mother, for that my Father
did what he could to make me a</HI> Thracian; <HI>but
my Mother's Part was to make me an</HI> Athe∣nian.
<HI>Iphicrates,</HI> in addition to his warlike
Talents, had the Reputation of a good Speaker:
But <HI>Plutarch</HI> blames him for going out of his
Province; and says, he made himself ridiculous
by getting Company to his House to declaim
to them. He likewise mentions an Instance of
his being quite overpower'd by the Eloquence
of his Antagonist: But <HI>Iphicrates</HI> would not
give it up; <HI>My Adversaries,</HI> said he, <HI>have the
better Actor, but mine is the better Play.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Timotheus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of <HI>Timo∣theus.</HI></NOTE> in a War against this <HI>Cotys,</HI> ob∣tain'd
great Booty to the Value of twelve hun∣dred
Talents, which he deliver'd into the pub∣lick
Treasury, without reserving any Part of
it to himself. This was afterwards remem∣ber'd
to the Shame of his Accusers, when he
<PB N="230" REF="256"/>
was fined an hundred Talents, and forc'd to
fly his Country, because he was not able to
pay it. He was the more sensibly affected
with this Misfortune, because he had hardly
known before what it was to suffer any. He
had generally succeeded in every thing he took
in hand; insomuch that some who envied him
on that Score, painted him asleep, with Fortune
by his Side, and casting Nets over Cities. He
did not understand Raillery upon this head,
but insisted seriously, That Fortune had no Share
with him in his Victories, but that they were
owing intirely to his Merit. <HI>Hereupon,</HI> says
Plutarch, <HI>The Goddess grew angry, and forsook him;</HI>
and adds, <HI>That from thenceforward nothing pros∣per'd
with him.</HI> However, in the main he was
so successful, that it is said, the <HI>Athenians</HI> ow'd
to him the Recovery of their Dominion at
Sea. He certainly contributed greatly towards
it; but his Father <HI>Conon</HI> had laid the Foun∣dation
of it by the Engagement at <HI>Cnidus;</HI>
after which, there were other Circumstances
concurr'd to the breaking the Power of the
<HI>Spartans;</HI> and it has been shewn, in what man∣ner
the <HI>Athenians</HI> took advantage of the Ne∣cessity
of their Affairs, even when they were
in Alliance with them against their common
Enemics. Besides the military Virtues of <HI>Ti∣motheus,</HI>
wherein he was equal to his Father,
he was better skill'd in the Civil Part of the
Administration. He had, by his Parts and In∣dustry,
<PB N="231" REF="257"/>
attain'd to a good Degree of Know∣ledge
of all kinds, and excell'd particularly in
the Art of speaking.</P>
<P>In this first Year of the 106th <HI>Olympiad,
Alexander the Great</HI> was born. On the same
Day that <HI>Philip</HI> receiv'd the News of it, he had
an Account of a great Victory obtain'd by <HI>Par∣menio</HI>
his General against the <HI>Illyrians,</HI> and like∣wise
of his having gain'd the Prize in the <HI>Olym∣pick</HI>
Games. Upon the Birth of his Son, he
wrote a Letter to <HI>Aristotle</HI> the Philosopher, to
acquint him with it, and to recommend to
him the Care of his Education, which he did
with the highest Compliment that could be
made. <HI>I return Thanks to the Gods,</HI> said he,

Religion; and, under that Pretence, <HI>Greece</HI> be
came by degrees universally involv'd in it
The first Occasion of it arose from the <HI>Pho∣cians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 106. 2. The Grounds of the Phoci∣an War.</NOTE> who having plough'd up a Piece of
Ground belonging to the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at
<HI>Delphi,</HI> their Neighbours exclaim'd against it as
Sacrilege; and it was adjudg'd so by the <HI>Am∣phictyons,</HI>
who were assembled, as the <HI>States
General</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> for that purpose; and an
heavy Fine was impos'd on them: Which be∣ing
unable to pay, they refus'd to submit to
the Sentence, alledging, that the Care and Pa∣tronage
of the Temple belong'd anciently to
them, and they quoted an Authority for it from
<HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>This Spirit of Opposition was rais'd by <HI>Phi∣lomelus</HI>
a principal Man among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philome∣lus the Phocian General.</NOTE> who en∣courag'd
them to take up Arms, and acted as
their General. He first applied himself to the
<HI>Spartans,</HI> who had likewise been fined by the
<HI>Amphictyons,</HI> at the Instance of the <HI>Thebans</HI> af∣ter
the Battle of <HI>Leuctra,</HI> for having seiz'd
the <HI>Cadmêa.</HI> For this reason they were very
well dispos'd to join with him, but did not
yet think it proper to declare themselves:
However they encourag'd his Design, and sup∣plied
him under-hand with Mony; by which
means he rais'd Troops, and, without much
Difficulty, got possession of the Temple. The
chief Resistance he met with in the Neighbour∣hood,
<PB N="233" REF="259"/>
was from the <HI>Locrians;</HI> but having worsted
them, he erased the Decree of the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI>
which was inscrib'd on the Pillars of the Temple.
However, to strengthen his Authority, and give
a Colour to his Proceedings, he thought it con∣venient
to consult the Oracle, and to procure an
Answer in his Favour: But when he applied to
the Priestess for that Purpose, she refus'd to offi∣ciate,
till being intimidated by his Threats, she
told him, <HI>The God left him at Liberty to act as
be pleas'd;</HI> which he look'd upon as a good An∣swer,
and as such, he took care to divulge it.</P>
<P>This occasion'd another Assembly of the <HI>Am∣phictyons,</HI>
the Result whereof was a formal De∣charation
of War against the <HI>Phocians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greece di∣vided in this War.</NOTE> And the
Quarrel being now become more general, the se∣veral
States took Part in it, according to their
different Interests and Inclinations. <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta,</HI> with some others of the <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI>
declar'd for the <HI>Phicians;</HI> and the <HI>Thebans, Thes∣salians,
Locrians,</HI> and other neighbouring States
against them. <HI>Philomelus,</HI> at his first setting out,
had made great Professions with regard to the
Riches of the Temple, which were immense, that
he would not touch any Part thereof, and that
he had no Design in making himself Master of
the Temple, but to restore the ancient Rights and
Privileges of his Country. But having now
form'd his Alliances, and being press'd for Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny
to support them, he grew less scrupulous;
he broke into the Treasure, and made it a Fund
<PB N="234" REF="260"/>
for carrying on the War. With this Supply he
encreas'd the Pay of his Men, and by that En∣couragement
got together a considerable Army
He march'd with above ten thousand Horse and
Foot against the <HI>Locrians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trans∣actions of the two first Years of it.</NOTE> and beat them, not
withstanding that they were supported by the
<HI>Thebans.</HI> He did the same by the <HI>Thessalians</HI>
who were likewise join'd by their Neighbours
But the <HI>Thebans</HI> at length coming up with thir¦teen thousand Men, put a Stop to his Progress
As they had been the most active in procuring
the Decree, both against the <HI>Spartans</HI> and <HI>Pho∣cians,</HI>
so they were now the most zealous and
inveterate against them, and pursu'd them wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the Rage and Rancour of a Religious War
insomuch that having surpris'd a great Party o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

and accurs'd: But the <HI>Phocians</HI> made Reprisal
upon them, and treating them in the same mar
ner, brought them to act more according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Law of Arms. However the However the <HI>Thebans</HI> asterwar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

in the Pursuit was forc'd up a Precipic
and drove to a Point of it, where, to avo
falling into the Enemies Hands, he threw him
self head-long down the Rock; tho' <HI>Justin</HI> say
he was kill'd in the Battle. But however the
were, he made so vigorous a Defence in tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="235" REF="261"/>
Action, and had throughout conducted his Af∣fairs
so well, that if his Cause had been better,
he might have been compar'd with the greatest
Men of his Time. But according to the Part
he acted, he was no otherwise look'd upon, than
as a bold and wicked Adventurer, who stood in
Defiance of Gods and Men, and had involv'd
his Country in a War, to support him in his
Impieties.</P>
<P>These were the Transactions of the two first
Years of the War; during which time <HI>Philip</HI>
was enlarging and securing his Frontier, by taking
in such Places as were either convenient for him,
or troublesome to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip takes Me∣thone, and other Places</NOTE> Of this latter kind was <HI>Me∣thone;</HI>
which serving as a Refuge to his Enemies,
he took it by Storm; and having demolish'd it,
annex'd the Lands to <HI>Macedonia.</HI> During the
Siege, one of his Eyes was struck out with an Ar∣row;
and the Circumstance of it affected him
more than the Wound itself. For one <HI>Aster</HI> of
<HI>Amphipolis</HI> having offer'd him his Service as an
extraordinary Marksman, who could take a Bird
down flying, <HI>Well,</HI> said Philip, <HI>when I wage War
with Sterlings, I'll employ you.</HI> The Man was so
nettled with this Answer, that he threw himself
into the Town, and shot an Arrow at him with
this Inscription on it, <HI>At</HI> Philip'<HI>s right Eye.
Philip</HI> return'd it to him with another Inscription,
<HI>That he would hang up</HI> After, <HI>if he took the Town;</HI>
and he was as good as his Word. However he
was so asham'd of this Accident, that he did not

afterwards care to talk of an Eye, and could no
bear the mention of the Word <HI>Cyclops.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> concluding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 106. 4. Onomar∣chus suc∣ceeds Phi∣lomelus.</NOTE> that the Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

was succeeded by <HI>Onomarchus,</HI> who was personally
interested in carrying it on: For the <HI>Amphictyon.</HI>
had laid several Fines upon him, which he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not able to discharge. He therefore gather'd up
the Remains of the Army, and recruited it. For
this Purpose he coin'd Mony; with which he also
confirm'd his Confederates, and bought off some
of his Enemies. The <HI>Thessalians,</HI> who were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
most formidable of them, he engag'd to stand
neuter: But <HI>Philip</HI> soon after fix'd them in his
Interest, by freeing them from their Tyrants
Their Case was, that <HI>Lycophron</HI> of <HI>Pherae,</HI> who
succeeded his Brother <HI>Alexander,</HI> after he had as∣sisted
in his Murther, set out at first as their
Deliverer, and govern'd with Moderation; bu∣soon
after treading in his Predecessors Steps, the
begg'd <HI>Philip</HI>'s Assistance against him. <HI>Lyce∣phron</HI>
at the same time had Recourse to the <HI>Pho∣cians:</HI>
And thus by their Quarrel among the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
selves, they were drawn again into the Gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one. <HI>Onomarchus</HI> therefore, as well in Behalf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

began the Hostilities. He took sever;

before sent five thousand Men, under the Com∣mand
of <HI>Pammenes,</HI> to the Assistance of <HI>Artaba∣zus</HI>
in <HI>Asia,</HI> where they had good Success, and
did Honour to their Country.</P>
<P><HI>Onomarchus</HI> in the mean time gain'd great Ad∣vantages
against <HI>Philip</HI> in two several Actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc∣cesses a∣gainst Phi∣lip.</NOTE> 
and struck such a Terror into his Men, that he
had much ado to bring them again into the
Field. However being reinforc'd, it came to a
general Battle, with twenty thousand Men on
each Side.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But at length is defeated. taken and executed.</NOTE> Six thousand on the Side of the <HI>Pho∣cians</HI>
were kill'd on the Spot, and three thousand
taken Prisoners. Among the former was <HI>Ono∣marchus,</HI>
whose Body <HI>Philip</HI> caus'd to be hang'd
up; and the Prisoners he order'd to be thrown
into the Sea, as guilty of the Sacrilege. This
rais'd an Opinion of his Zeal for Religion, which
he knew how to make a right use of: And it
pass'd likewise for a Mark of his Justice and Ge∣nerosity,
with respect to the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> who were
by this Means restor'd to their Liberty: For <HI>Ly∣cophron</HI>
went off upon the general Rout; and he
and his Brother <HI>Pitholaus</HI> quitted <HI>Pherae,</HI> tho'
afterwards they appear'd again in Arms, and en∣deavour'd
by Means of the <HI>Phocians,</HI> to be re∣instated.
The <HI>Thessalians</HI> very well deserv'd this
Piece of Service: For the Success of the Battle
was owing chiefly to their Horse; which <HI>Philip</HI>
was so sensible of, that he took care to maintain
a constant Friendship and Alliance with them;
<PB N="238" REF="264"/>
and they had a great Part in the successive Victo∣ries
of his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Onmarchus</HI> was succeede in the Command
by his Brother <HI>Phayllus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 107. 1. Succeeded by his Bro∣ther Phayl∣lus.</NOTE> who took the same Me∣thods
that his Predecessors had done to support
himself. He had a great Command of Mony,
which being distributed very liberally, he en∣creas'd
the Number of his Confederates, and
easily got a fresh Supply of Mercenaries; with
which he march'd into <HI>Boeotia,</HI> but was worsted
there in three several Engagements. From thence
he remov'd into <HI>Locris,</HI> where he had more equal
Success; and after he had taken some Towns, he
was seiz'd with a lingering Illness, of which he
died.</P>
<P>The Course of the War had like to have been
interrupted by a Quarrel between the <HI>Spartans</HI> and
the Inhabitants of <HI>Megalopolis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spar∣tans create fresh Dis∣turbances.</NOTE> The latter being
unable to defend themselves, call'd in the <HI>Argives,
Sicyonians</HI> and <HI>Messenians,</HI> to their Assistance;

became an over-match for the <HI>Spartans;</HI> who
thereupon borrow'd three thousand Foot of the
<HI>Phocians;</HI> and <HI>Lycophron,</HI> with his Brother <HI>Pi∣tholaus,</HI>
came in to them with a small Party of
Horse. But notwithstanding these Preparations,
after the taking a Town or two, which occa∣sion'd
some sharp Engagements, wherein the
<HI>Spartans</HI> at length had the better, a Truce was
agreed upon, and the Armies separated.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="265"/>
Upon the Death of <HI>Phayllus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phalecus succeeds Phayllus.</NOTE> the Command
was given to <HI>Phalecus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Onomarchus,</HI>
who being very young, <HI>Mnaseas</HI> was assign'd to
him as his Director, and was kill'd in the first
Action that happen'd. However the War was
continu'd by Skirmishes, and mutual Incursions
and Depredations. The <HI>Thebans</HI> had in this
piqueering way got a good deal of Plunder:
But as the Burthen of the War lay chiefly upon
them, they were so drain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 107. 2.</NOTE> that they were re∣duc'd

King of <HI>Persia</HI> for a Supply, he readily furnish'd

<P><HI>Philip</HI> had not as yet been directly engag'd
in this War. For what he had done against <HI>Ono∣marchus,</HI>
was only by Accident, and in Conse∣quence
of his protecting the <HI>Thessalians</HI> against
their Tyrants. However his Success in that
Action, and the general Esteem he had gain'd
by his other Exploits, had now enlarg'd his
Views, and put him upon endeavouring to gain
a footing in <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip pre∣vented in his Design upon Thermopylae</NOTE> In order to it, under a

his great and principal Design of invading
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>The stopping his Progress at <HI>Thermopylae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise and Cha∣racter of Demosthe∣nes.</NOTE> was
owing chiefly to <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> who had began to
distinguish himself soon after the Conclusion of
the <HI>Social War,</HI> when the <HI>Athenians</HI> were alarm'd
at the great Preparations which were making in
<HI>Persia.</HI> He afterwards appear'd in Behalf of the
<HI>Megalopolitans</HI> and <HI>Rhodians,</HI> that they might be
protected and supported against <HI>Sparta</HI> or <HI>Thebes;</HI>
or any other State, which might, by such an Ac∣cession,
give Umbrage to <HI>Athens,</HI> and destroy the
Balance of Power. But he began now to exert
himself in a more extraordinary manner; and
he had from this time forwards so great a Share
in the Affairs of the Publick, that a particular
Account of him, besides the doing Justice to the
Character of so wonderful a Man, may serve, in
a great measure, to explain and illustrate the His∣tory
of the Times he liv'd in. The chief Re∣gard
that has been paid to his Memory, has
generally been on account of his Eloquence. But
he was likewise a very able Statesman, and a good
Patriot; and considering the Embassies and Ex∣peditions,
the Treaties and Alliances, and other
various Negotiations wherein he was employ'd
together with the Zeal and Integrity with which
he acted in them, it may be question'd whether
he did not excel as much in those Capacities, a
<PB N="241" REF="267"/>
in that of an Orator; tho' it must be confess'd,
that his Art of Speaking was the Foundation of
his other Merit, or at least the Means of pro∣ducing
it to Advantage, and improving it. But
notwithstanding that he arriv'd to such a Per∣fection
in this Art, he set out under great Dis∣advantages:
For he had an Impediment in his
Speech, with a weak Voice, and a short Breath,
and a very uncouth and ungracious Manner;
however by Dint of Resolution, and infinite
Pains, he overcame all these Defects. He
would climb up steep and craggy Places to help
his Wind, and strengthen his Voice; he would
declaim with Pebbles in his Mouth, to remedy
the Imperfection in his Speech; he would place
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Looking-Glass before him, to correct the
Aukwardness of his Gesture; and he learn'd of
the best Players the proper Graces of Action and
Pronunciation, which he thought of so much
Consequence, that he made the whole Art of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ratory in a manner to consist of them. But
whatever Stress he laid upon the exterior Part of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peaking; he was also very careful about the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter, and the Stile; the latter of which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm'd upon the Model of <HI>Thucydides,</HI> whose
History, for that Purpose, he transcrib'd eight se∣eral
times. He was so intent upon his Study,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he would often retire in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a Cave of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth, and shave half his Head, so that he could
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot with Decency appear abroad, 'till his Hair
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s grown again. He also accustom'd himself
<PB N="242" REF="268"/>
to harangue at the Sea Shore, where the Agita
tion of the Waves form'd to him an Idea of the
Commotions in a popular Assembly, and serv'd
to prepare and fortify him against them.</P>
<P>From these several Kinds of Hardship, which
he impos'd upon himself, it is plain that he was not
born an Orator, but was rather an Instance how
far Parts and Application may go, towards the
forming a great Man in any Profession. To
add to which, he had a great deal of Ambition
to spur him on; and that which heighten'd it
or rather gave the first Rise to it, was a famous
Cause in a Matter of Dispute concerning <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
pus,</HI> whether that City belong'd to the <HI>Attick</HI> of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the <HI>Theban</HI> Frontier. <HI>Callistratus,</HI> who pleaded
in Behalf of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> succeeded well, and
receiv'd extraordinary Applause; which so af
fected <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> that from that Instant, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he was then but sixteen Years old, he fix'd hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Resolution, and turn'd his Thoughts wholly th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way. And indeed the Study of Oratory was a
that Time the readiest, and almost the only
Means of rising in the State. His first Essay
at the Bar, was two Years after this Incident
when he call'd his Guardians to account for im
bezzling his Patrimony, and recover'd some Par
of it. This encourag'd him some time after a
harangue before the People in their publick Assem
bly; but he acquitted himself so ill, that they
hiss'd him. However he ventur'd a second time
but with no better Success than before; so th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="243" REF="269"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he went away ashamed and confounded, and
quite in Despair. It was upon this Occasion that
<HI>Satyrus</HI> the Player accosted him, and in a friendly
way encourag'd him to proceed. With this
View, he ask'd him to repeat to him some
Verses of <HI>Sophocles or Euripides,</HI> which he ac∣cordingly
did; the other repeated them after
him, but with such a different Spirit and Ca∣dence,
as made him sensible, that he knew very
little of Elocution. But by his Instructions, and
his own Perseverance, he at length made himself
master of it; and by the Methods before-men∣tion'd,
he corrected the Imperfections which
were born with him, as well as the ill Habits
which he had contracted. It is not very clear,
wheter this Passage be rightly ascrib'd to <HI>Saty∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI>
who seems to be confounded with <HI>Neoptole∣mus</HI>
and <HI>Andronicus,</HI> who were likewise famous
Comedians; and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> is said to have been
instructed by all three of them.</P>
<P>With these Advantages and Improvements, he
appear'd again in publick, and succeeded so well,
that People flock'd from all Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> to
hear him. From hence he was look'd upon as
the Standard of true Eloquence; insomuch that
none of his Countrymen have been put in Com∣parison
with him; nor even among the <HI>Romans,</HI>
any but <HI>Cicero:</HI> And tho' it has been made a
Question by the ancient Writers, to which of
the two they should give the Preference, they
have not ventur'd to decide it, but have contented
<PB N="244" REF="270"/>
themselves with describing their different Beauties
and shewing that they were both perfect in their
kind. But to confine myself to <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> hi
kind of Eloquence was grave and austere, lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Temper, but withal masculine and sublime
bold, forcible and impetuous; abounding with
Metaphors, Apostrophes, and Interrogations
which, with his solemn way of invoking and ap∣pealing
to the Gods, the Planets, the Elements,
and the <HI>Manes</HI> of those who sell at <HI>Salamis</HI> and
<HI>Marathon,</HI> had such a wonderful Effect upon his
Hearers, that they thought him inspir'd. If he
had not so much Softness and Insinuation, as is
often requisite in an Orator, it was not that he
wanted Art and Delicacy, when the Cafe requir'd
it; he knew how to found the Inclinations of the
People, and to lead them to the Point he aim'd
at, and sometimes by seeming to propose that
which was directly contrary to it. But his chief
Characteristick was Vehemence, both in the Ac∣tion
and Expression; and indeed that was the
Qualification of all others most wanted at this
time. For the People were grown so insolent
and imperious, so factious and divided, so jealous
of the Power of the <HI>Democracy,</HI> and withal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n k into a State of Pleasure and Indolence, that
no Arts of Persuasion would have been so effectual.
as that Spirit and Resolution, that Force and E∣nergy
of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> to humble them, to unite
them, and to rouse them into a Sense of their
common Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="271"/>
But neither could <HI>Demosthenes</HI> himself have
made such Impressions on them, if his Talent of
speaking had not been supported by their Opi∣nion
of his Integrity. It was that which added
Weight and Emphasis to every thing he said,
and animated the Whole. It was that which
chiefly engag'd their Attention, and determin'd
their Counsels, when they were convinc'd that he
spoke from his Heart, and had no Interest to
manage, but that of the Community. And this
he gave the strongest Proofs of in his Zeal a∣gainst
<HI>Philip,</HI> who said, <HI>He was of more Weight
against him, than all the Fleets and Armies of the</HI>
Athenians; and that <HI>he had no Enemy but</HI> De∣mosthenes.
He was not wanting in his Endea∣vours
to corrupt him, as he had most of the leading
Men in <HI>Greece;</HI> but he withstood all his Offers,
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, <HI>all the Gold of</HI> Macedonia <HI>could
not bribe him.</HI> And yet as inflexible as he was to
<HI>Philip,</HI> he became more pliable in the Reign of
his Successor, and gave occasion to his Enemies
to accuse him of Bribery; for which he was
fin'd and imprison'd, and afterwards banish'd.
This Charge against him has by some been
thought a malicious and groundless Calumny,
and the rather, because he was not allow'd to
justify himself. But the Fact is so generally
related by others, and with so many Circum∣stances,
that it is not easily to be resuted. The
Case in short was, That <HI>Harpalus,</HI> an Officer of
<HI>Allexander's,</HI> having imbezzled a great Part of
<PB N="246" REF="272"/>
the Treasure that he had been entrusted with,
made up a Purse, and retir'd with it to <HI>Athens</HI>
for Protection. It was debated by the People,
whether they should admit him, for fear of in∣curring
his Master's Displeasure, and involving
themselves in a War; and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> consider∣ing
it in that Light, oppos'd it. <HI>Harpalus,</HI> to
remove all Difficulties, dispers'd his Mony pretty
liberally among the Orators; and as he was dis∣playing
his Wealth, <HI>Demosthenes</HI> happen'd to fix
his Eyes on a rich Gold Cup of the King's,
and admiring the Sculpture and Fashion, ask'd
the Price of it. <HI>Harpalus</HI> took the Hint, and
at Night sent it home to him, together with
twenty Talents in Mony. The next Day he
appear'd in the Assembly muffled up about his
Throat; and when he was expected to speak to
the Point in Question, he made Signs that he
had lost his Voice. But his Transaction with
<HI>Harpalus</HI> had taken Wind; and when he found
himself detected, he rose up to excuse it; but
the People were so enrag'd, that they would not
hear him: Whereupon a certain Wag stood up
and said, <HI>What, will ye not hear the King's Cup∣bearer?</HI>
Others said, <HI>Surely, the Orator had not
been seiz'd that Night with a Silver Squinzy;</HI> and
they had coin'd a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> Word on purpose to express
it. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> could not stand this Contempt
and Raillery of his Fellow-Citizens, who had
hitherto esteem'd and respected him, even to a
Sort of Reverence; and it affected him the more,
<PB N="247" REF="273"/>
because he had piqu'd himself so much more
than others upon the Rigidness of his Virtue,
which indeed was the chief Foundation of that
extraordinary Respect which had been paid him.
But the Itch of Mony had infected him; and
this was not the only instance of his receiving
Presents in a clandestine and unwarrantable man∣ner.
As a further Argument that he did not
despise Mony, he was reproach'd with dealing
in Bottomry, which in those Days was look'd
upon as a scandalous way of Traffick: And
therefore <HI>Zeno,</HI> who likewise practis'd it some
time after him, gave it up as a thing that would
hurt the Credit of his Philosophy. But however
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> was in some Degree tainted with the
general Corruption of the Times, he does not
seem to have lov'd Mony so much for its own
Sake, as to serve the Ends of his Ambition:
Wherein he copied after <HI>Pericles,</HI> whom he like∣wise
chose to imitate in his manner of speaking.
He had not the Command as the other had of
the publick Mony, and therefore was not in a
Capacity of doing so many great and popular
Acts: But he repair'd the City Walls, sitted out
Ships, ransom'd Slaves, married poor Maidens,
entertain'd the People with Shews and Sports,
and did such other things of that kind, as were
within the Compass of his private Fortune. And
this seems the most plausible way of accounting
for the Methods he took to get Mony, and to
improve it.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="274"/>
But whatever might be alledg'd in his Excuse
as to Mony Matters, he had another Failing,
which, by his own confession, he was guilty
of, and that was want of Courage, as will be
more particularly related in its proper Place. In
the mean time, I would only observe the strange
Inconsistency in the Composition of this Great
Man, who, with such Constancy and Intrepidity,
oppos'd all the Measures of the Foreign and
Domestick Enemies of his Country, and who so
often, at the Hazard of his Life, brav'd the
Madness of the People in their Assemblies, and
yet could not stand an Enemy in the Field. <HI>He
chose,</HI> says Plutarch, <HI>to swear by those who fell at</HI>
Maratnon, <HI>tho' he could not follow their Example.</HI>
And what is still more extraordinary, he after∣wards
refus'd Life when it was offer'd him; and
Nobody died with greater Fortitude. These
Frailties which I have mention'd, could not but
take off a great deal from the Lustre of his Cha∣acter;
insomuch that <HI>Phocion,</HI> who succeeded
him, tho' in several Respects he was not equal
to him, besides that he was suspected to favour
the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Interest, yet being more re∣markable
for his personal Justice and Valour, he
was therefore look'd upon as the greater Man.
However <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> such as he was, did more
Service to the State than any of his Contempo∣raries:
He was the chief Bulwark, not only of
<HI>Athens,</HI> but of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, and almost
the only Obstacle to <HI>Philip's</HI> Designs of enslaving
<PB N="249" REF="275"/>
it. Which leads us now into an Enquiry how
those Designs were laid, and how far they suc∣ceeded.</P>
<P>The
two next Years of the <HI>Phocian</HI> War pass'd
without any memorable Action, tho' it was still
continu'd by Skirmishes and mutual Depreda∣tions.
<HI>Philip</HI> had now no Part in it. But when
he found himself shut out of <HI>Greece</HI> by the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> he turn'd his Arms against those re∣mote
Places, which depended on them, either as
Colonies, or as Conquests: and particularly a∣gainst
the <HI>Olynthians,</HI> whom he had long look'd
upon with an evil Eye, but had courted and ca∣joled
them whilst he was otherwise employ'd.
But he came now resolv'd entirely to reduce 'em;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 108. 1. Philip's Design upon Olynthus.</NOTE> 
and advancing towards the City, only sent them
a short Message, to let them know, <HI>That one of
these two Points was become necessary, either that
they must quit</HI> Olynthus, <HI>or he</HI> Macedonia: Where∣upon
they sent immediately to <HI>Athens</HI> for Relief.
The Matter was debated there with great Solem∣nity;
and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> was very earnest in sup∣porting
their Demand:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demosthe∣nes presses the Athe∣nians to re∣lieve it:</NOTE> In the doing whereof,
he took occasion to lay open the Designs and
Practices of <HI>Philip,</HI> inveighing against him with
great Bitterness, and urging every thing that
might serve to incense the People against him.
He describ'd him as a proud tyrannical Usur∣per,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Desertbes Philip.</NOTE> and a common Disturber of Mankind;
without Faith or Confidence; without any Prin∣ciple
of Honour or Justice, or any Regard to
<PB N="250" REF="276"/>
Laws, Human or Divine. Then as to the Dan∣ger
they might apprehend from him, he repre∣sented
him likewise as politick, vigilant, inde∣fatigable,
intrepid and fortunate, who fought as
successfully with his Mony as his Sword, and
knew how to corrupt where he could not con∣quer.
But lest, from this Account of him, he
should appear so formidable to the People, that
they might be discourag'd from endeavouring to
stop his Progress, he shew'd him in another
Light, as vain, presumptuous, rash and impru∣dent,
forming Schemes without any Founda∣tion;
and measuring the Vastness of his Designs
only by the Standard of his Ambition. From
these different Views of him, which were varied
according to the different Impressions that were
to be made upon the People, we may collect al∣most
the whole of his Character: But the Orator,
in framing this Picture of him, must be said to
have drawn the Lines a little too strong, and to
have heighten'd the Colours too much by the
Warmth of his Zeal, and the Force of his Elo∣cution.
And yet these Exaggerations were ne∣cessary
at this Time, in order to inflame the
People: For <HI>Philip</HI> had his Partizans among the
Orators, who combated and oppos'd every thing
that was urg'd against him.</P>
<P>One of the ablest and most zealous of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Dema∣des.</NOTE> 
was <HI>Demades,</HI> who was very ready and acute,
and remarkable for speaking <HI>extempore,</HI> as any
Occasion offer'd. Herein he had manifestly the
<PB N="251" REF="277"/>
Advantage of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> whose Works were
said <HI>to smell of the Lamp.</HI> And hence it was,
that <HI>Theophrastus</HI> being ask'd his Opinion of the
two Orators, answer'd, <HI>That</HI> Demosthenes <HI>was
worthy of the City of</HI> Athens; <HI>but that</HI> Dema∣des
<HI>was above it.</HI> However <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had,
upon some very important Occasions, succeed∣ed
well in the unpremeditated way of haran∣guing;
but it being not his usual Method, nor
his natural Talent, he discouraged the Practice
of it. And therein he made use of an artful
Argument, That to speak before the People
in an abrupt manner, and without due Prepa∣ration,
was not treating them with Respect;
that it had somewhat of an <HI>Oligarchical</HI> Prin∣ciple
in it, and was rather bearing them down by
Force, than winning them by Persuasion. As
to <HI>Demades,</HI> whatever his Wit and Parts were,
he was very mercenary and corrupt: And when
he was charg'd with it, he said, <HI>He had often
spoke against himself, but never against his Coun∣try.</HI>
But there is an Instance recorded of him,
wherein he seem'd rather to value himself up∣on
it, than to excuse it: For meeting one day with
a Player, who had receiv'd a Talent as a Reward
for a Part that he had excell'd in, <HI>It is not so
extraodinary,</HI> said Demades, <HI>to have one Talent
given you for speaking; I had Ten given me for hold∣ing
my Tongue.</HI> His prostituting himself in this
manner, was chiefly to support his Luxury: For
he was naturally profuse and gluttonous; and
<PB N="252" REF="278"/>
hence it was, that when he was grown
old, <HI>Antipater</HI> compar'd him to a sacrificed
Beast, of which all the Parts were consum'd,
but the Tongue and the Paunch. He was some∣times
upon good Terms with <HI>Demosthenes</HI> ac∣cording
as it serv'd his present Purpose: but
the Rivaiship in their Profession, with the dif∣ferent
Cast of their Tempers and their Poli∣ticks,
made it impracticable for them to live
in any real Friendship. On the contrary, they
were generally at Variance; and at length it
came to an open Enmity, which in the Sequel
will appear to have cost <HI>Demosthenes</HI> his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>Another of the same Stamp with <HI>Demades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and of Hyperi∣des.</NOTE> 
was <HI>Hyperides,</HI> both as to his Parts and Prin∣ciples,
and his riotous Manner of living. He
had a more premeditated way of speaking; but
with the same kind of Wit and Acrimony, tho'
he was not so quick. He is generally rank'd
with <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and is mention'd as one of
the Ten Principal Orators of that Age, tho'
<HI>Plutarch</HI> does not reckon him in that Number.
He took a great deal of pains to ingratiate
himself with the People, and had no Ties of
Faith or Friendship, but as they serv'd that
End. However he was not much in the Ad∣ministration
of Affairs 'till the Reign of <HI>Alex∣ander:</HI>
And then he acted such a double Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
between the Patriot and the Traitor, that he
was at last ensnar'd by his own Politicks, and
sell a Sacrifice to the Resentment of <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pater</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="279"/>
Such were most of the leading Men in the
Assemblies, and such was generally their End.
To carry on their own private Views, they
inflamed the People, and deluded them with
false Colours, 'till they had drawn them either
into an unnecessary War, or a bad Peace: But
sooner or later they suffer'd for it, and were
either made particular Marks of Vengeance, or
involved in the common Ruin of their Coun∣try.
This was more remarkably the Case at
<HI>Athens,</HI> which had been always look'd upon
as the chief Seat of Eloquence, and never a∣bounded
with so many eminent Speakers as at
this time. But that which was the Glory
of this Common-wealth, must at the same time
be consider'd as one principal Cause that hast∣en'd
its Downfall, and drew along with it that
of the other <HI>Grecian</HI> States.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> his steady and
uniform Conduct supported him for many Years
against <HI>Demades,</HI> and the rest of his Antago∣nists;
and he got the better of them in the
present Case of the <HI>Olynthians;</HI> tho' he was
not able to obtain such seasonable and effectual
Relief for them, as the Necessity of their Af∣fairs
required, notwithstanding that he press'd
it with all the Skill and Arguments that he
was Master of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demost∣henes still presses the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef of Olynthus.</NOTE> He told the People how much
they were oblig'd in Justice and Honour to
support their Allies; and how much their own
Safety depended on it; for that if <HI>Olynthus</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="280"/>
should be taken, the next Attempt would be
upon <HI>Athens.</HI> He reproach'd them with their In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sensibility and Sloth, to which he chiefly ascrib'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all <HI>Philip's</HI> Greatness; and caution'd them agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Treachery and Enchantment of their Ora
tors. He advis'd them to reform Abuses; to
restore the Ancient Order and Discipline; to
serve in the Wars in person, as they had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
merly done; to lay aside their private Ani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mosities; to unite against <HI>Philip</HI> as their com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mon Enemy, and to furnish the necessary Sup∣plies.</P>
<P>But
this latter was the great Point in que∣stion,
and that which had occasion'd most of
their late Dissensions, the Fund for the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(as has before been observ'd) having been ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
plied to the Use of the Stage. The Mony
arising from this Fund was computed at a thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sand Talents a Year; and a certain Proportior
of it was allotted to the Citizens, to defra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Charge of their Admittance into the The
atre. This Distribution having been continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to them from the Time of <HI>Pericles,</HI> they claim'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it now as their Right, especially since they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lately obtain'd a Law, which made it capital t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
propose the restoring the Fund to the Uses so
which it was originally granted. Hence it was
that upon any pressing Emergency, extraordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nary Taxes were to be rais'd; and they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
laid so unequally, and collected with so muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Difficulty, that they seldom answer'd the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="255" REF="281"/>
vice for which they were intended. The wealthier
Sort complain'd, that the Burthen lay wholly
upon them, and that the Publick Mony was
squander'd away in Shews and Festivals, for
the Entertainment of the lower Rank of the
Citizens, who fat at their Ease, and contribu∣ted
nothing to the Support of the Publick,
either in their Purse, or their Persons. They
retorted upon the Rich, that they enjoy'd all
the Honours and great Offices of the State,
exclusive of the common People; and as they
had the Law on their Side, with Numbers to
support it, they gave little Attention to any
Remonstrances that were made upon this Head.
<HI>Demosthenes,</HI> who had nothing in view but the
General Good, thought it necessary to sound
the People upon this Subject, and enter'd as
far into it as he could with Safety; He pro∣pos'd,
that Commissioners should be appointed
to inspect the Laws in general, not in order
to make new Ones, for that there were already
too many; but that such of them, as should be
sound prejudicial to the Publick, might be a∣bolished.
At the same time he urg'd the pre∣sent
Necessity of raising Forces, and mention∣ed
the <HI>Theatrical Mony</HI> as the only proper
Fund for it. In Conclusion he told them plain∣ly,
that the Law relating to it ought to be
repeal'd. However he took care to deliver it
only as his Opinion, without proposing it in
form, so as to subject himself to the Penalty.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="282"/>
This was the Substance of the three famous
Orations of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> upon occasion of three
several Applications that the <HI>Olynthians</HI> made
to <HI>Athens</HI> for Succours. The first of them pro∣duced
no Effect in their behalf. Upon the se∣cond,
<HI>Chares</HI> was dispatch'd to them with thir∣ty
Gallies and two thousand Men. But these
being Hirelings and Strangers, did them very
little Service: Which occasion'd theird Ap∣plication,
wherein they desired true <HI>Athenian</HI>
Troops, whom they could better depend on.
And accordingly <HI>Chares</HI> was sent out again
with seventeen Gallies, and a Body of two
thousand Foot and three hundred Horse, com∣pos'd
intirely of the Citizens of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Olynthians</HI> continued block'd up;
and whatever Benefit they might have received
from this last Sapply, they were prevented by
<HI>Philip,</HI> who, by the Correspondence he held in
the Town, had corrupted <HI>Euthycrates</HI> and <HI>La∣sthenes</HI>
the two chief Magistrates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olynthus be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay'd to Philip.</NOTE> who betray'd
it into his hands. He enter'd and plunder'd
it, and sold the Inhabitants among the rest of
the Booty. He also found in it his two Ba∣stard
Brothers, whom he put to death, as he
formerly had the other of them, being jealous
of their supplanting him in the Throne. This
Circumstance of his Brothers is related only by
<HI>Justin,</HI> who also makes the harbouring them
in the Town, the Pretence for <HI>Philip's</HI> invest∣ing
it. He found in it Abundance of Trea∣sure,
<PB N="257" REF="283"/>
which he reserv'd as a Fund for the gain∣ing
other Places in the same manner. In the
mean time he shew'd extraordinary Marks of
Joy for the taking <HI>Olynthus,</HI> as a Place of the
greatest Importance: He celebrated publick
Games, gave Shews and Festivals, and made
Presents to those who assisted at them.</P>
<P>One of the remarkable Occurrences of this
first Year of the 108th <HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and Character of Plato.</NOTE> was the Death
of <HI>Plato,</HI> which happen'd suddenly in the midst
of an Entertainment, that he had made for his
Friends upon his Birth-day, which compleated
the Eighty first Year of his Age. By his Fa∣ther's
Side, he was of Royal Extraction, and
by his Mother he was descended from <HI>Solon:</HI>
But he is not so much taken notice of for
his high Birth, as for the Figure he made in
the World by his Philosophy. He was a Scho∣lar
of <HI>Socrates;</HI> but was more lively and fer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
in his Imagination, more sublime and flo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d

in his Matter. Instead of consining him∣self,
after his Example, to the Study of Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ality
only, he took in the whole Compass of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hilosophy, and had distinct Masters for each
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rticular Branch of it. To add to the Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovements
he made under them, he travell'd

<PB N="258" REF="284"/>
was, that <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> call'd him the
<HI>Attick Moses.</HI> And he appears, in several Part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his Works, to have had some distinct No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

chose, in the way of Dialogue, to couch hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

say, it was his extreme Modesty and Diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Garden. Notwithstanding his Application to
Study, he had none of that Gloominess and
Austerity in his Temper, which was common
to most of his Profession. On the contrary,
he was chearful and facetious, and sometimes
lov'd Raillery; but it was always inoffensive
and with good Manners, and only to enliven
the Conversation. He prescrib'd the same Rules

is said to be more than <HI>Alexander</HI> afterward

<P><HI>Philip</HI> had for the most part affected to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
serve a Neutrality in this Quarrel: But by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
small Part he had already acted in it, it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
easily seen that he intended to do more. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the mean time he left the contending Parties t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

most use to him; and the Case happen'd no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
according to his Expectations. For the <HI>Theban</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="287"/>
were so exhausted with the War, that they were
not able to carry it on to any Advantage, and
therefore had recose to him for his Assistance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The The∣bans call in Philip to their Assistance.</NOTE> 
which he made no Difficulty of granting them.
This was a very lucky Circumstance for the
promoting his Views; but it was the most fatal
Step the <HI>Thebans</HI> could have taken, both with re∣gard
to themselves, and the rest of <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Consequen∣ces of it.</NOTE> Their
calling in one who was as yet to be look'd
upon as a Foreigner, and who only waited such
an Opportunity, was sacrificing every thing to
their Obstinacy and Inveteracy against the <HI>Pho∣cians;</HI>
it was giving up all those Marks of Su∣periority,
which they pretended to upon the
Credit of their Victories under <HI>Epaminondas;</HI>
in short, it was consigning themselves over to
Slavery, and forging their own Chains. And
with regard to the Publick, the Consequences
will appear to be still worse. The <HI>Thessalians</HI>
who had been inveigled by <HI>Philip</HI> ever since
his Accession to the Throne, were prevail'd up∣on
to join in this new Confederacy. And af∣terwards
several other <HI>Grecian</HI> States, when they
sound themselves oppress'd by their Neighbours,
applicd to <HI>Philip</HI> for Relief, as to a common
Friend and Protector: But this was not 'till
he had a more immediate Influence in their
Affairs, by being admitted into the Assembly
of the <HI>Ampictyons;</HI> besides it was the <HI>Thebans</HI>
who set them the Example, and who are there∣fore
<PB N="262" REF="288"/>
to be look'd upon as the principal Be∣trayers
of the Liberties of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' <HI>Philip</HI> had enter'd into these En∣gagements
with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> he consider'd, that
the <HI>Phocians</HI> were supported both by <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta,</HI> and therefore proceeded with Caution
and Secrecy, and took time to form his Mea∣sures
accordingly. Amidst these Deliberations,
it happen'd just as he could have wish'd, that
the <HI>Athenians</HI> being grown weary of a War,
which was so far from turning to their ac∣count,
that it only gave <HI>Philip</HI> a better Op∣portunity
of wresting from them their Posses∣sion
in <HI>Thrace,</HI> had therefore sent to sound him
upon a Peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athens ne∣gotiates a Peacewith Philip,</NOTE> <HI>Ctesiphon</HI> and <HI>Phrynon,</HI> who
were employ'd in this Commission, made their
Report, that he was not at all averse to it; and
thereupon <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> with nine others, were
sent as Ambassadors to negotiate it. They went
as far in it as they were authoriz'd by their
Instructions, and return'd with <HI>Antipater, par∣menio</HI>
and <HI>Eurylochus</HI> on the Part of <HI>Philip.</HI>
Soon after, the Ten were dispatch'd back again
with full Powers to put the last Hand to the
Treaty. <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> in the first of these Em∣bassies,
had met with some <HI>Athenian</HI> Prisoners
in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> whom he had promis'd to re∣deem
at his own Expence; and he took the
present Opportunity for it. In the mean time
his Colleagues were to proceed with all Expe∣dition,
in order to conclude with <HI>Philip:</HI> but
<PB N="263" REF="289"/>
they loiter'd by the way, and were three
Months in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> before they had Access
to <HI>Philip,</HI> who was all that time ravaging the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Dominions in <HI>Thrace.</HI> When at last
they got up to him, he agreed to the Terms
of the Treaty; but still, upon one Pretence or
other, deferr'd the Execution of it, 'till at length
being advanc'd with his Troops into <HI>Thessaly,</HI>
in order to proceed against the <HI>Phocians,</HI> he
found it necessary to conclude with the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">which at last is concluded.</NOTE> and accordingly ratified the Treaty.</P>
<P>By these Delays, which he gain'd by bri∣bing
all the Ambassadors in general, except
<HI>Demosthenes,</HI> he had kept the <HI>Athenians</HI> in sus∣pence,
'till his other Designs were ripe for Exe∣cution.
However, as the Peace was at last
concluded, the Generality of the People were
well satisfy'd with it, and the Ambassadors, at
their Return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeschines vouches for Philip's Promises.</NOTE> valued themselves upon the Suc∣cess
of their Negotiations. <HI>Aeschines</HI> in parti∣cular,
who was one of them, and was intirely
devoted to <HI>Philip,</HI> expatiated largely upon his
Candour and Sincerity, and vouch'd for his
Performance of several things which he had
promis'd in behalf of the Republick, altho'
they were not stipulated by the Treaty; as
that <HI>Thespiae</HI> and <HI>Plataea</HI> should be repeopled;
that, in case he should subdue the <HI>Pho∣cians,</HI>
he would not destroy them; that he
would put the <HI>Thebans</HI> upon a reasonable foot∣ing;
that <HI>Oropus</HI> should be secured to the <HI>A∣thenians;</HI>
and that <HI>Euboea</HI> should be given up
<PB N="264" REF="290"/>
to them as an Equivalent for <HI>Amphipolis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demo∣sthenes gives no Credit to them.</NOTE> <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI>
endeavour'd, with his usual Frankness,
to convince the People how little Stress there
was to be laid upon these Promises of <HI>Philip,</HI>
which, he said, were made only to amuse them,
and to divert them from his real Design, which
was to make himself Master of <HI>Phocis;</HI> and
that their suffering him to succeed in that,
would be giving up every thing. But all that
he could say upon this Occasion had no weight
with them. They were willing to be deceiv'd;
and <HI>Aeschines</HI> knew how to work upon their
Credulity. He was in the first Rank of Ora∣tors,
and disputed the Prize even with <HI>Demo∣sthenes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Contest between him and Aeschines.</NOTE> of which there was a famous Instance in
the Contest concerning the Crown, wherein the
Abilities of these two great Men were display'd
in their highest Lustre, and engaged the
Attention of all the learned Men of <HI>Greece.</HI>
The Case in short was, That <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> among
other necessary Works that were committed to
his Charge, had the care of repairing the City
Walls, which he did partly at his own Expence;
and the People, in Testimony of their Gratitude,
decreed him a Crown of Gold. <HI>Aeschines</HI> being
jealous of his Rival's Glory, brought an Action
against <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> as being the Author of the De∣cree,
and founded it upon a Pretence, that <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI>
had not pass'd his Accounts to the Pub∣lick,
and therefore was not capable by Law of
receiving any Reward for his Services. This
<PB N="265" REF="291"/>
Fact happen'd in the hundred and tenth <HI>Olym∣paid,</HI>
about the Time of the Battle of <HI>Cheronêa,</HI>
and the Suit was commenc'd soon after; but it
was not heard till several Years after <HI>Philip</HI>'s
Death, when <HI>Aeschines</HI> taking Advantage of <HI>De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mosthenes,</HI>
whose Credit was then at a very low
Ebb, brought it on. However <HI>Demosthenes</HI> pre∣vail'd,
as well by the Justice of his Cause, as by
the Force of his Eloquence; and <HI>Aeschines</HI> was
so asham'd, that he spent the Remainder of his
Life in a voluntary Exile.</P>
<P>Another famous Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Isocrates</NOTE> who encourag'd the
People in this peaceable Disposition, and con∣firm'd
them in their good Opinion of <HI>Philip,</HI>
was <HI>Isocrates;</HI> who yet did it with an honest
Intention. He was a great Master of the Rules
of Oratory, and most of the great Men of his
Time had been instructed by him: But he de∣clin'd
speaking himself in publick, having a
weak Voice, and a natural Diffidence and Timi∣dity.
However he was not wholly unconcern'd
in the Affairs of the Publick; but his way of de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sivering
his Sentiments upon them, was in Wri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting,
and in the Form of an Oration. And in
this manner he now address'd himself to <HI>Philip,</HI>
with whom he was upon some Terms of Friend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip
and Confidence, but not otherwise than he
thought consistent with the Duty of a good Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zen.
He explain'd to him the several Advan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages
that might be drawn from the Peace he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd concluded with <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Ad∣vices to Philip.</NOTE> and told him, that
<PB N="266" REF="292"/>
in order to make a right use of it, he should
endeavour to compose the Differences still sub∣sisting
between the other States, and to restore
the general Tranquillity of <HI>Greece.</HI> That the re∣conciling
them to one another, and then leaving
them to the free Enjoyment of their Laws, and
their Liberty, would endear him to them, and
would redound infinitely more to his Honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
than all the Conquests he could make. He then
advis'd him to turn his Arms against <HI>Persia,</HI> as
the proper Object of his Ambition; intimating
to him, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> would readily act in
Conjunction with him against their common and
inveterate Enemy; and that in that Case, there
would be no room to doubt of the Success: For
Proof whereof he instanc'd to him the Expedi¦tion of <HI>The Ten Thousand,</HI> with the glorious Cir¦cumstances of their Retreat; and that of <HI>Ages<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
laus</HI> afterwards, who, with a Body of <HI>Spartan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
only, would have subdu'd the whole <HI>Persia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Empire, if he had not been diverted from it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Divisions of his Country. He told him fur¦ther, that many who were prejudic'd against him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gave him the Character of an artful and desig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n¦ing Prince, and were of Opinion, that whatever
specious Pretences he made use of, to disguise h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Approach towards them, his real Intention w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to make himself Master of <HI>Greece.</HI> He men¦tion'd these things only as Reports, and suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as were injurious, and without Foundation; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would not suffer himself to suppose, that a Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="267" REF="293"/>
who valu'd himself so much upon his being de∣scended
from <HI>Hercules,</HI> the Deliverer of <HI>Greece,</HI>
would ever make an Attempt to enslave it.
However he exhorted him, by a generous and
disinterested Proceeding, to contradict these Re∣ports;
to govern his Subjects with Justice and
Prudence, and to give Peace to his Neighbours;
in short, to set Bounds to his Ambition at home,
and to extend his Conquests in <HI>Persia.</HI> The
main Scope of this Oration, was to divert him
from attempting any thing that might give Um∣brage
to <HI>Greece;</HI> and <HI>Isocrates</HI> chose this way of
gaining upon him by Mildness and Complaisance;
but he was too easy and credulous. <HI>Demosthenes</HI>
was more a Man of Business, and knew the
World and <HI>Philip</HI> too well to imagine, that one
of his aspiring and intriguing Temper, who had,
during his whole Reign, fomented Divisions in
<HI>Greece,</HI> in order to reap the Benefit of it to
himself, would be prevail'd upon by any Rea∣soning
of this Kind, to give up his favourite
Design, which he had so long projected, and
which was now so near taking Effect. However
the Sincerity and long Experience of <HI>Isocrates,</HI> who
was now eighty-eight Years old, added great
Weight to his Opinion; which, with the Im∣pressions
that <HI>Aeschines,</HI> and the other Pensioners
had made upon the People, together with their
own natural Aversion to War, determin'd the
Point so far in favour of <HI>Philip,</HI> that he was suf∣fer'd
<PB N="268" REF="294"/>
quietly to pursue his March into <HI>Phocis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip suf∣fer'd to gain the Streights of Thermopylae.</NOTE> 
and to gain the Streights of <HI>Thermopylae.</HI></P>
<P>He did not immediately discover what use he
intended to make of his Entrance into <HI>Greece,</HI>
but went on, according to his Agreement with
the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3658. Olymp. 108. 3. He puts an End to the Phocian War.</NOTE> to put an End to the <HI>Phocian</HI> War,
which he easily effected. His Name and Ap∣pearance
struck such a Terror among the <HI>Pho∣cians,</HI>
that tho' they had lately receiv'd a Rein∣forcement
of a thousand heavy-arm'd <HI>Spartans,</HI>
under the Command of their King <HI>Archidamus,</HI>
they declin'd giving him Battle, and sent to
treat with him, or rather to submit themselves
to any Terms, that he would give them. He
allow'd <HI>Phalecus</HI> to retire with eight thousand
Men, being Mercenaries, into <HI>Peloponnesus;</HI> but
the rest, who were the Inhabitants of <HI>Phocis,</HI> were
left at his Mercy. As the disposing of them was
a Matter wherein <HI>Greece</HI> in general was concern'd,
he did not think fit to act in it by his own pri∣vate
Authority, but referr'd it to the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI>
whom he caus'd to be assembled for that Purpose.
But they were so much under his Influence, that
they serv'd only to give a Sanction to his Deter∣minations.
They decreed, <HI>That all the Cities of</HI>
Phocis <HI>should be demolish'd; That they who had
fled, as being principally concern'd in the Sacrilege
should be stigmatiz'd as accurs'd, and proscrib'd a
Out-laws; That they who remain'd as Inhabitants
should be dispers'd in Villages, and oblig'd to pay
<PB N="269" REF="295"/>
out of their Lands, a yearly Tribute of sixty Ta∣lents,
till the Whole of what had been taken out of
the Temple, should be restor'd.</HI> They were likewise
adjudg'd to lose their Seat in the Council of the
<HI>Amphictyons,</HI> wherein they had a double Voice.
This <HI>Philip</HI> got transferr'd to himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He obtains a Seat a∣mong the Amphic∣tyons,</NOTE> which
was a very material Point, and may be look'd
upon as the principal Step towards his gaining
that Authority, which he afterwards exercis'd in
the Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI> At the same time he
gain'd, in Conjunction with the <HI>Thebans</HI> and
<HI>Thessalians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and the Su∣perinten∣dency of the Pythian Games.</NOTE> the Superintendency of the <HI>Pythian</HI>
Games, which the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had forfeited for
their having taken Part with the <HI>Phocians.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did <HI>Philip,</HI> without striking a Stroke,
put an End to this War, after it had for ten
Years together divided <HI>Greece</HI> against itself. And
besides the other Advantages that he had drawn
from it, he gain'd an universal Esteem and Ap∣plause,
for having vindicated the Honour of
Religion. <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> who generally a∣bounds
with Sentiments of Piety towards the
Gods, but with a great Mixture of Credulity
and Superstition, ascribes all the Success of his
Affairs afterwards, to this single Instance of his
Zeal for Religion, which in reality was nothing
but Artifice and Hypocrisy. He goes on to de∣scribe
the several Judgments which befel those
who were concern'd in the Sacrilege, and de∣scends
even to their Wives, who, he says, were
made Examples of the Divine Vengeance, for

<P><HI>PHILIP</HI> having by these plausible Methods

And here it may be necessary to take a summary
<PB N="271" REF="297"/>
View of the State of that Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first In∣habitants.</NOTE> without enter∣ing
into the fabulous Accounts of the first Ages
of it: For <HI>Sicily,</HI> like most other Nations, had
its Giants and Monsters. Such were the <HI>Cyclopes</HI>
and <HI>Laestrigones,</HI> who are mention'd as the first
Inhabitants. To them succeeded the <HI>Sicani;</HI> but
whether they were Natives, or transplanted from
<HI>Spain,</HI> is not clearly determin'd. The next were
the <HI>Siculi,</HI> who being drove by the <HI>Pelasgi</HI> from
that Part of <HI>Latium</HI> whereon <HI>Rome</HI> was built,
and finding no proper Seat on the Continent,
transported themselves as Adventurers to this
Island, where they became so far Masters, as to
give the Name to it, which it has ever since re∣tain'd.</P>
<P>About
three hundred Years after they were in
Possession of the Island, a considerable Number
of <HI>Grecians</HI> settled themselves in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gre∣cians get footing three.</NOTE> These were
the <HI>Chalcidians</HI> of <HI>Euboea;</HI> and they were soon
followed by a Body of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> who possess'd
themselves of <HI>Syracuse;</HI> which, from the Extent
of its Buildings, and the Conveniency and Capa∣tiousness
of the Harbour, became the <HI>Metropolis</HI>
of the Island, tho' it was rivall'd by several other
great Cities, which were independent of That,
and of one another. These Cities were origi∣nally
govern'd by the People; but as the Power
of the leading Men among them encreas'd, they
fell by Degrees into <HI>Aristocracies,</HI> and were after∣wards
erected into little Principalities and Ty∣rannies,
under the Command of single Persons.
<PB N="272" REF="298"/>
And it frequently happen'd, that some one of
these Tyrants, of a more enterprising Genius
than the rest, aspir'd to the Conquest of the
Whole.</P>
<P>Such was the confus'd State of <HI>Sicily</HI> for several
Ages before and after the <HI>Grecians</HI> had any foot∣ing
in it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Summary Account of Syracuse.</NOTE> and the <HI>Syracusians</HI> underwent the same
Changes and Interruptions in the Course of its
Government, as the other Parts of the Island.
Their first Tyrant was <HI>Gelon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gelon the first Tyrant.</NOTE> who taking Ad∣vantage
of the Dissensions between the Magis∣trates
and the People, fell in with the former,
and, under a Pretence of restoring them to their
Dignities, obtain'd the Sovereignty for himself.
However he made no ill use of his Power. He
signaliz'd himself by many great Actions both in
Peace and War. He not only strengthen'd and
adorn'd the City, and enlarg'd the Territory,
but sav'd the whole Island from falling into the
Hands of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who had set their
Heart upon the Conquest of it, as lying so con∣venient
for their Shipping, and were further
tempted by the Fruitfulness of the Soil, and
the Riches of the Inhabitants. Accordingly,
under the common Pretence of assisting to com∣pose
the Differences among them, they threw a
vast Number of their own, and other <HI>African</HI>
Troops into the Island. But their Designs were
seen thro'; and the several Cities uniting in their
common Defence, the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were attack'd
and defeated, and are said to have lost an hun∣dred
<PB N="273" REF="299"/>
and fifty thousand Men in this Expedition.
The Honour of this Victory was ascrib'd chiefly
to <HI>Gelon,</HI> who had by this, and many other In∣stances,
so far endear'd himself to the People,
that they suffer'd his Brothers <HI>Hiero</HI> and <HI>Thrasy∣bulus</HI>
to succeed him in their turns as lawful
Princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is succeed∣ed by his Brothers Hiero and Thrasy bu∣lus.</NOTE> The former held it eleven Years, and
the latter ten Months: But their Government
became so odious to the People, that they forc'd
them to quit it; and by this Means they re∣cover'd
their former Liberty; which they en∣joy'd
near sixty Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another U∣surpation by Dionysius the elder.</NOTE> till the elder <HI>Dionysius</HI> by

which were vere very useful to the Publick. He
greatly increas'd the Naval Force, and was very

He had studied the Art of Speak∣ing,
and found his account in it, especially at
his first setting out upon the foot of a Patriot.
But that which he chiefly apply'd himself to, was
Poetry, which he affected to a Degree that made
him ridiculous. He was so full of his Perfor∣mances
of this kind, that he not only courted
Applause, but extorted it by Rewards and Pu∣nishments.
In short, he valu'd himself more
upon his writing bad Verses, than upon his
gaining a Victory against the Enemies of his
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="300"/>

Sensuality. The Consequence was, that <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
was disgrac'd and banish'd:<NOTE PLACE="marg">who drives Dionysius into Italy.</NOTE> But he return'd, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the <HI>Syracusians</HI> into a Condition of re-establis∣ing
themselves in their Freedom. But instead
improving this Opportunity, they quarrelled wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="275" REF="301"/>
their Deliverer, and, upon an ill-grounded Jea∣lousy
of his aspiring to the Government, treated
him with great Inhumanity and Ingratitude;
which he generously over-look'd, and endeavour'd
still to extricate them out of their Difficulties.
But he was soon after kill'd by means of <HI>Calippus</HI>
an <HI>Athenian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dion</HI> is killed by Calippus</NOTE>, who came over with him to assist
him against <HI>Dionysius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">who suc∣ceeds in the Tyranny.</NOTE> but began now to set up
for himself; and by getting rid of <HI>Dion,</HI> who
was the chief Obstacle in his way, succeeded in
the Tyranny, and held it about a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Dionysius,</HI> after ten Years Absence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionysius is restored.</NOTE> found Means
to reinstate himself in the Government; but he
did not hold it long: For his Sufferings, instead
of making him wiser and better, had harden'd
and exasperated him, and he became more fierce
and cruel than before. Hereupon the People
had Recourse to <HI>Icetes,</HI> who was a Native of <HI>Sy∣racuse,</HI>
but at that time govern'd the <HI>Leontines.</HI>
He readily espous'd their Quarrel against the
Tyrant, but it was in order to succeed him; and
with that View he enter'd into a secret League
with the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who lay hovering about
the Island with a numerous Fleet. This gave
the <HI>Syracusians</HI> a fresh Alarm; so that between
their Oppressions and Divisions at home, and
their Appehensions of an Invasion from abroad,
they knew not who to apply to, nor who to
trust; and they had brought themselves into
these Streights by their own ill Conduct. For
they did not distinguish between their Friends
<PB N="276" REF="302"/>
and their Foes; they had all the Capriciousness
and Insolence of a Free State, without the Power;
in short, they knew neither how to govern, nor
to obey.</P>
<P>In this distracted State of their Affairs, they
turn'd their Thoughts towards <HI>Greece,</HI> and ap∣plied
for Relief to <HI>Corinth,</HI> as being their Mo∣ther-Country,
and a common Patroness of Li∣berty.
The <HI>Corinthians</HI> sent them a favourable
Answer, and order'd a Body of Troops to be
dispatch'd to them under the Command of <HI>Timo∣leon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Timoleon</HI> ordered to the Relief of the <HI>Sy∣racusians.</HI></NOTE> who was of one of the best Families in
<HI>Corinth,</HI> and who, besides his many other great
Qualities, had given a very extraordinary In∣stance
of his Aversion to Tyranny.</P>
<P>He had an Elder Brother named <HI>Timopha∣nes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of his former Conduct.</NOTE> whom he lov'd passionately, and had res∣cued
him in an Engagement against the <HI>Ar∣gives</HI>
with the utmost Hazard of his own Life.
This Brother having afterwards the Command
of the City-Guards, made use of them to sub∣vert
the Government, and declared himself King
of <HI>Corinth. Timoleon</HI> endeavour'd by all possi∣ble
means to dissuade him from these violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Measures; and not being able of himself to bring
him to Reason, engag'd two of his Friends to
assist him in it. Upon their expostulating wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, he first laugh'd at them, and then, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they press'd him further, he grew angry; up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on which, <HI>Timoleon</HI> finding, that neither the
Prayers and Entreaties, nor their Arguments an
<PB N="277" REF="303"/>
Menaces had any effect upon him, retired at a
little distance from him, and stood weeping
with his Face cover'd, whilst the other Two
drew their Swords, and dispatch'd him. <HI>Dio∣dorus
Siculus</HI> says, <HI>Timoleon</HI> kill'd him with his
own Hands in the Market-place. He relates
this Story with several other different Circum∣stances:
But the Account which <HI>Plutarch</HI> gives
of it from the Historians, who liv'd at the
time when the Fact was committed, is more
probable, and more consistent and uniform, as
well as more to the Honour of <HI>Timoleon.</HI> This
Action was by some extoll'd and applauded as the
highest pitch of human Virtue, and by others
condemn'd as a base and unnatural Parricide.
And <HI>Timoleon</HI> himself, when he came to cool,
felt such a Remorse for it, that he abandon'd
himself to Despair, and resolv'd to starve him∣self
to death. His Friends with great Impor∣tunity,
and even by Force, prevail'd upon him
to take some Sustenance; and at length he
promis'd them he would live, but upon con∣dition
that he might quit the Service of the
Publick, and retire to some remote and desart
Corner of the Country; which he accordingly
did, and for near twelve Years together, wan∣der'd
up and down the Fields by himself in
this anxious and sorlorn Condition.</P>
<P>He was return'd to <HI>Corinth</HI> when he was
pitch'd upon for this Command; and as he
liv'd still in a retir'd way, he would gladly have
<PB N="278" REF="304"/>
declin'd it, but that he did not think it con∣sistent
with the Duty he ow'd to his Coun∣try.
Before he set out, he was told, <HI>That as
to the Affair of his Brother, the World would
judge of it according to his Behaviour in this
Expedition; That if he acquitted himself well in
it, he would be said to have freed his Country
from a Tyrant; if otherwise, he would be look'd
upon as his Brother's Murtherer.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst he was preparing to embark, there
came Letters from <HI>Icetes</HI> to dissuade him from
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Icetes en∣deavours to prevent his landing in Sicily.</NOTE> as a dangerous and fruitless Attempt; for
that he would be intercepted in his Passage
by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> whom, for want of re∣ceiving
Succours in due time from <HI>Corinth,</HI>
he had been forced to call in to his Assist∣ance
against the Tyrant: Whereupon <HI>Timoleon</HI>
was forthwith order'd away with ten Gallies.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd on the Coast of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 108. 4. He arrives on the Coast of <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> he re∣ceiv'd
advice, that <HI>Icetes</HI> had made himself
Master of the greatest Part of <HI>Syracuse;</HI> that
he had forced the Tyrant into the Citadel;
and that the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> had orders to
prevent his landing: And accordingly at <HI>Rhe∣gium</HI>
he found twenty Gallies, which had been
detach'd from their Fleet for that purpose.
They had likewise Deputies on board from <HI>Ice∣tes</HI>
to acquaint him, That the Affairs of <HI>Si∣cily</HI>
being in a manner settled, there would be
no Occasion for his Assistance; but how∣ever,
that, in case he would send home his
<PB N="279" REF="305"/>
Gallies, with the Troops, he might come up
himself to <HI>Syracuse,</HI> and share with him in his
Conquests. <HI>Timoleon</HI> had no Views of this kind;
but finding himself over-power'd, he seem'd to
hearken to their Proposal, and to submit to it
as a Case of Necessity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He lands in <HI>Sicily</HI> by a Stra∣tagem.</NOTE> However he desir'd
for Form sake, and in order to justify his
Conduct at his Return to <HI>Corinth,</HI> that what
had pass'd privately between them, might be
declared in a more open manner before the
People of <HI>Rhegium,</HI> as being common Friends
to both Parties. But the leading Men among
them were in his Interest; and this Demand
of his was a concerted thing between them, as
a Project for his escaping out of their Hands.
To carry on this Design, an Assembly was
call'd, and <HI>Timoleon,</HI> and the Ambassadors, to∣gether
with the Captains of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI>
Gallies, were admitted to it. But the People,
instead of entering upon the Business for which
they were conven'd, fell into tedious and tri∣fling
Debates about other Matters, and spun
out the Time, 'till nine of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gal∣lies
got clear of the Harbour, and put to Sea;
which <HI>Timoleon</HI> having secret notice of, found
means to slip unobserv'd through the Croud,
and having got on board the remaining Gal∣ly,
join'd the rest of his Squadron, and he land∣ed
at <HI>Tauromenium</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> where <HI>Andromachus</HI>
the Governor receiv'd him with open Arms,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with him in his Design of freeing the
<PB N="280" REF="306"/>
Island. But few of the other Towns as yet
came in to him. They had a general Distrust
of all Foreign Commanders, having found by
Experience, that they had been allured by them
with fair Promises, and afterwards been more
oppress'd by them, than by those from whom
they pretended to deliver them. The <HI>Syracu∣sians</HI>
had a better Opinion of him; at least they
had no body else to depend on: And yet they
had very little Hopes of Relief from him,
whilst <HI>Icetes</HI> was in possession of the Town,
<HI>Dionysius</HI> of the Citadel, and the <HI>Carthaginians</HI>
of the Harbour.</P>
<P>His first Scene of Action was at <HI>Adranum</HI> a
small City below Mount <HI>Aetna;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc∣cess at <HI>A∣dranum.</HI></NOTE> where the In∣habitants
being divided, one Party call'd in <HI>Ti∣moleon</HI>
to their Assistance, and the other, <HI>Icetes.</HI>
The former was glad to take this Opportunity
of advancing further into the Country; and
the latter thought it so necessary to prevent
him, that he immediately march'd thither with
a Detachment of five thousand Men. <HI>Timoleon</HI>
arriv'd there at the same time with his whole
Strength, which amounted to no more than
twelve Hundred. However taking advantage
of the Enemy, whilst they were fixing their
Tents, he fell upon them with great Fury, and
put them to flight, having kill'd three hundred
of them, and taken double that Number of Pri∣soners,
together with their Camp, and all their
Baggage.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="307"/>
This prosperous Beginning gave him great
Credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olym.</HI> 109. 1. Other Pla∣ces submit to him.</NOTE> and increas'd his Followers; so that not
only <HI>Adranum,</HI> but most of the other neigh∣bouring
Towns submitted to him. <HI>Mamercus</HI>
Tyrant of <HI>Catana,</HI> a Man of great Wealth and
Power, enter'd into Alliance with him; and
the City of <HI>Messina</HI> at the same time declared
for him. It likewise advanc'd his Affairs at
<HI>Syracuse;</HI> where <HI>Dionysius</HI> finding his Case des∣perate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dionysius</HI> surrenders himself.</NOTE> chose rather to give up himself and the
Citadel to him, as a Man of Honour and Bra∣very,
than to become a Prey to <HI>Icetes,</HI> whom
he despis'd for his Behaviour in the late Action.
Accordingly <HI>Timoleon</HI> sent four hundred Men
to take possession of the Citadel; and they
gain'd their Entrance by Stealth, and in small
Companies. They found there two thousand
Soldiers, whom <HI>Dionysius</HI> likewise gave up to
them, together with a vast Magazine of Stores,
and Arms for seventy thousand Men.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Dionysius</HI> himself, he was conducted
out privately,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 109. 2. and is sent to <HI>Co∣rinth.</HI></NOTE> and carried to <HI>Timoleon</HI>'s Camp;
from whence he was transported to <HI>Corinth,</HI>
where he became a publick Spectacle. People
flock'd from all Parts, to see the Man who
had made so much Noise in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and whose
Name was become formidable even to <HI>Greece.</HI>
But he appear'd very easy and composed, and
without any Marks either of Terror, or of
Dignity. Instead of endeavouring to retrieve
his Affairs, he fell into a mean way of Life,
<PB N="282" REF="308"/>
sauntering about in the Shops and the Shambles,
drinking in Taverns, or squabbling with lewd
Women in the Streets. And at length being
reduced to great Necessity, he is said to have
taught School for Bread.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> having met with such Success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timole∣on's fur∣ther Suc∣cesses.</NOTE> <HI>Ice∣tes</HI>
was so terrify'd, that he had sent for a
further Supply of Forces from <HI>Africa;</HI> and <HI>Ma∣gon</HI>
the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> came over to him, with
an hundred and fifty Sail of Ships, and sixty
thousand Men. Whereupon he block'd up the
Citadel, and march'd in order to besiege <HI>Ca∣tana</HI>
likewise, where <HI>Timoleon</HI> then lay. But be∣fore
he had made any Progress there, he re∣ceiv'd
advice, that <HI>Leon</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who com∣manded
in the Citadel at <HI>Syracuse,</HI> had made
a successful Sally, that he had kill'd one part
of the Besiegers, and put the rest to flight;
and that having taken <HI>Acradina,</HI> the strongest
Quarter of the Town, he had added Works
to secure it, and to join it to the Citadel. <HI>lce∣tes</HI>
immediately return'd to <HI>Syracuse;</HI> and <HI>Ti∣moleon</HI>
having lately receiv'd a Supply of two
thousand Foot and two hundred Horse from
<HI>Corinth,</HI> soon follow'd him.</P>
<P>However, he had as yet no more than four
thousand Men to oppose to a numerous Army:
But there happen'd a lucky Incident, which
gave him great Encouragement. Whilst he
lay before the Town, some of his <HI>Corinthians</HI>
falling into company with a Party of Mercenaries
<PB N="283" REF="309"/>
who serv'd under <HI>Icetes,</HI> took occasion
to expostulate with them upon their present
Alliance with the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI> They told
them, That as they were of the same <HI>Grecian</HI>
Extraction with themselves, they ought to
be engaged in the same Interest; and reproach'd
them with endeavouring to put <HI>Syracuse</HI> and all
Secily into the Hands of those, who were not
only <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but the vilest and most inhu∣man
Sort of them, and such as they ought to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nite against, as their common Enemy. The
Rumour of this Discourse was soon spread about
the Camp; and it had such an Effect upon
<HI>Magon,</HI> that, for fear of being betray'd and sa∣cificed,
he forthwith embark'd his Troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Car∣thaginians <HI>quit</HI> Sicily.</NOTE> and
was gone so suddenly, that <HI>Timoleon</HI>'s Men, in a
way of Pleasantry, caus'd Proclamation to be
made, offering a Reward to any who should bring
Tidings of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Fleet. <HI>Magon,</HI> at
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Return home, being conscious of his Mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehaviour,
kill'd himself; and the People were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o incens'd at him, that they nail'd his Body
upon a Cross.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon,</HI> to improve this Advantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timoleon <HI>attacks</HI> Syracuse,</NOTE> made
his Disposition for attacking the Town in three
several Parts of it; which he accordingly did
the next Day, and with such Vigour and Suc∣cess,
that <HI>Icetes</HI>'s Troops giving way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and gains it.</NOTE> he carried
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at the first Assault; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, there
was not one <HI>Corinthian</HI> either kill'd or wounded
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. The first thing he did upon this Victory,
<PB N="284" REF="310"/>
was to summon in the Inhabitants to demolist
the Citadel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demolish∣eth the Ci∣tadel,</NOTE> which he call'd, <HI>The Nest of Tyrants</HI>
They soon levell'd it with the Ground; and
from thence proceeded to pull down the Palace
of their Usurpers; to tear up their Tombs, and
to destroy every thing that might preserve an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Memorial of them. In the Place where the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
tadel stood, <HI>Timoleon</HI> order'd Courts of Justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be erected. But whilst he was thus endea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vouring to give free Scope to the Laws, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
put the Government upon the ancient footing
he found there were very few Inhabitants left t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
enjoy the Benefit of it. For what with the
Divisions among themselves, their Wars with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and the Oppression of their Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vernors, such Numbers of them had been de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
story'd and forc'd away, that the City was in
manner become a Desart, and the Grass grew i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Streets. And this was the Case of most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the great Towns in <HI>Sicily.</HI> But as to <HI>Syracus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

those few who remain'd there, re-peopled i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
They sent to all the publick Assemblies of <HI>Greec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and into <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">re-peoples the City.</NOTE> and the Islands, to notify, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Syracuse</HI> having recover'd its Liberty, all suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as were willing to go and settle there, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

sand; which, with those who had fled, and we
banish'd, and others who flock'd in from
<PB N="285" REF="311"/>
Parts to <HI>Timoleon,</HI> amounted in the whole to sixty
thousand. This generous Proceeding of the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI>
is taken particular notice of, that when
they had it in their Power to make themselves in∣tire
Masters of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> they contented themselves
with the Glory of saving and replenishing it, and
of being a second time the Founders of it.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> having thus far re-establish'd the Af∣fairs
of <HI>Syracuse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 109. 3. He proceeds to free the rest of the Island:</NOTE> march'd to the other Parts of

himself up to him, he spared his Life, but sent
him after <HI>Dionysius</HI> to <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>But before he could root out all the Remains
of arbitrary Government, the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> to
secure those Places which were still in their In∣terest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is opposed again by the <HI>Cartha∣ginians.</HI></NOTE> and to retrieve the Disgrace of their last
Expedition, sent an Army of seventy thousand
Men, with a Fleet of two hundred Sail, besides
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thousand Transport Ships, laden with Chariots,
Engines of Battery, and all kinds of Provisions.
These Forces landed at the Promontory of <HI>Lily∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aeum,</HI>
under the Command of <HI>Asdrubal</HI> and <HI>Ha∣milcar,</HI>
and occasion'd such a general Consterna∣tion,
that <HI>Timoleon</HI> could raise but twelve thou∣sand
Men to make head against them. <HI>Plutarch</HI>
reduces them to seven thousand; and says, that
<PB N="286" REF="312"/>
even of that Number, one thousand deserted him
in their March.</P>
<P>However he went on to give the enemy Battle
before they had got a thorough footing in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Island; and coming up with them in their Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

were well form'd. But they were so expos'd to
the Chariots which were plac'd in the Front, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Timoleon</HI> drew them off; and taking a side Com∣pass with his whole Strength, attack'd the Enemy in the Flank. After the first Onset, ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
happen'd a sudden Storm of Thunder and Lightning, Wind, Rain and Hail, which drove full i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Face of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and beat so fu∣riously
upon them, that they could neither se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Defeat.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Timoleon</HI> gains the Victory.</NOTE> There is some Variation in the Ac∣counts
that are given of this Action, but not in

likewise some Difference as to the Number of

the highest Accounts of them, there were above
ten thousand slain, besides three thousand who
were Natives of <HI>Carthage,</HI> of the best Families
and Fortunes, and of the most approv'd Valour:

But this Expedition had no better Success than
the former, and serv'd only to hasten the putting
an End to these Wars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">but defeat∣ed by <HI>Ti∣moleon.</HI></NOTE> For <HI>Icetes, Mamercus</HI>
and <HI>Hippo</HI> appearing again in Arms upon this
Reinforcement, <HI>Timoleon</HI> pursu'd them one after
another; and after he had kill'd several thou∣sands
of their Followers, they were all three
taken and executed. The Wives and Children
of <HI>Icetes</HI> were likewise condemn'd and executed
by the <HI>Syracusians;</HI> which was look'd upon as an
ungenerous Part in <HI>Timoleon,</HI> that he did not in∣terpose
in their Behalf. But it was the Act of
the People, and was said to be done by way of
Retaliation for the like Treatment of the Family
of <HI>Dion,</HI> whose Wife and Sister, and Infant Son
<HI>Icetes</HI> had caus'd to be thrown alive into the
Sea.</P>
<P>During these Transactions of <HI>Timoleon,</HI> the
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> sued to him for Peace, and agreed,
among other Conditions, to renounce all Leagues
and Associations with any of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Tyrants;
which he consider'd as the most effectual Means
of suppressing them; and it succeeded accord∣ingly.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 110. 2. The publick Liberty re∣stored.</NOTE> For soon after this Treaty, they were ut∣terly

<P><HI>Timoleon</HI>
having finish'd this great Work, di∣vested
himself of his Authority, and chose ra∣ther
<PB N="289" REF="315"/>
to live as a private Man at <HI>Syracuse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Timoleon</HI> retires, and lives pri∣vate in <HI>Syracuse.</HI></NOTE> with
the Pleasure of seeing so many thousands made
happy in the Enjoyment of the Blessings he had
procur'd for them, than to grasp at any fur∣ther
Power in <HI>Sicily,</HI> or to return in Triumph
to <HI>Greece.</HI> He was infinitely belov'd and ho∣nour'd
by the <HI>Syracusians,</HI> who, in Memory of
what he had done for them, made a Decree,
<HI>That in all their future Wars, they should have a</HI>
Corinthian <HI>Commander.</HI> And so long as <HI>Timoleon</HI>
liv'd, they made no Law or Treaty, nor did any
extraordinary Act of Government, wherein he
was not consulted. As to what remains to be
said concerning him, it will fall in more pro∣perly
with the Account of his Death, which
happen'd two Years later.</P>
<P>During the former Part of these Commotions
in <HI>Sicily, Philip</HI> was gaining Ground upon the
<HI>Illyrians,</HI> and settling his Conquests at home:
But before the re-establishment of Affairs in that
Island, he had carried his Arms into <HI>Thrace</HI> and
the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> among the <HI>Athenian</HI> Colonies and
Confederates, and thereby given occasion to fresh
Disturbances, which should have been related in
their due Order of Time; but I have chose ra∣ther
to do it now by way of Retrospect, than
to break into the Narration of what pass'd at <HI>Sy∣racuse.</HI>
In the first Year of the 109th <HI>Olympiad,</HI>
he march'd into <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and having clear'd out
the Remains of Tyranny in the several Cities
there, he not only confirm'd the <HI>Thessalians</HI> in
<PB N="290" REF="316"/>
his Interest, but gain'd over many of their Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>Having
strengthen'd himself in these Parts, he
went the next Year into <HI>Thrace,</HI> where he had form'd
a Design against the <HI>Chersonese.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip</HI>'s Design a∣gainst the <HI>Chersonese</HI> of <HI>Thrace.</HI></NOTE> This Peninsula
had, with some little Interruption, been for many
Years in the Hands of the <HI>Athenians:</HI> But <HI>Cotys,</HI>
as being King of the Country, had lately wrested
it from them, and left it in Succession to his Son
<HI>Chersobleptes.</HI> He not being able to defend him∣self
against <HI>Philip,</HI> gave it back to the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
reserving to himself only <HI>Cardia</HI> the capital City.
But <HI>Philip</HI> having soon after routed him of the
rest of his Dominions, the <HI>Cardians,</HI> for fear of
falling again under the Power of the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
threw themselves into his Protection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is op∣posed by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pithes,</NOTE> <HI>Diopithes,</HI>
who was the Chief of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Colony lately
sent to the <HI>Chersonese,</HI> consider'd this Proceeding
of <HI>Philip</HI> in supporting the <HI>Cardians,</HI> as an Act
of Hostility against <HI>Athens.</HI> Whereupon he in∣vaded
the Maritime Part of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and carried
away a great deal of Botty. <HI>Philip</HI> being at this
time in the upper Part of the Country, was not
in a Condition to do himself Justice: But he
wrote to complain of it at <HI>Athens,</HI> as an In∣fraction
of the Peace; and his Creatures there
were not wanting on their Part, to aggravate
the Charge against <HI>Diopithes,</HI> as having acted
without Orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and taken it upon himself to
renew the War. They likewise accus'd him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
committing Acts of Pyracy, and of laying their
<PB N="291" REF="317"/>
Allies under Contribution. But whatever Grounds
there were for this Part of the Accusation, the
Government of <HI>Athens</HI> was principally to blame
in it: For having no proper Fund for the War,
they sent out their Generals without Mony or
Provisions, and left them to shift for themselves,
and yet made them answerable for any Miscar∣riages
that should happen for want of their being
better supply'd. This was a great Discourage∣ment
to the Service, and put those who were
employ'd in it, upon pillaging and plundering
in such a manner, as they would otherwise have
been asham'd of. <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> in an Harangue
that he made upon the State of the <HI>Chersonese,</HI>
undertook the Defence of <HI>Diopithes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demosthe∣nes defends him,</NOTE> And altho'
that might be the principal Design of his Speech;
yet he enter'd into a great Variety of other Mat∣ter,
and laid open so much of the present Situa∣tion
of Affairs both in <HI>Athens,</HI> and several other
States of <HI>Greece,</HI> that it may be proper to give
the Reader a short Account of it; and the ra∣ther,
because it contains the Substance of what
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> has said in some of his other Ora∣tions,
in the same manner, and almost in the same
Terms, against <HI>Philip,</HI> and his Partizans in the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Assembly.</P>
<P>He urg'd to the People in Behalf of <HI>Diopithes,</HI>
that he had done nothing but what his Necessities
had forc'd him to, and that he had only follow'd
the Example of his Predecessors, who had con∣stantly
laid the Islanders, and other <HI>Asiatick</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="318"/>
Allies under Contribution; and that they who
paid it, found their Account in it, in having
Convoys to secure them from Pyrates, and o∣therwise
to protect their Trade. That instead
of being question'd, for using his Industry to
procure that Subsistence for the Troops, which
he could not obtain from the Government, they
ought forthwith to send him a Reinforcement,
and to provide better for their Pay. However
he told them, That whatever Exactions or Vio∣lences
he had been guilty of, he was their Offi∣cer,
and it was always in their Power to send
for him home, and to punish him, as they found
he deserv'd. But he told them at the same time,
that this Accusation was made use of only as an
Handle to divert them from inquiring into the
Motions and Designs of <HI>Philip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and in∣veighs a∣gainst <HI>Phi∣lip.</HI></NOTE> who, with a
powerful Army in <HI>Thrace,</HI> and upon the <HI>Helle∣spont,</HI>
was ravaging their Possessions, debauching
their Allies, and stirring up against them both
the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> That whilst he
was engag'd in these Practices, he was to be
look'd upon as the first Aggressor; and that
they were not to think themselves secure, because
he was not come up to the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> nor was at∣tacking
them in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Among other Arguments to induce them to
make head against him, he told them, they had
more to apprehend from him, than their Neigh∣bours
had; and he explain'd it to them by an
artful Piece of Flattery:</HI> You must not imagine,
<PB N="293" REF="319"/>
said <HI>he,</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> will treat you in the same
manner with the rest of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and that
he will content himself with barely making Slaves
of you. No; his Design is to destroy and extirpate
you. For he is sensible, that a People, who have
so long known what it is to command, will never
bear Servitude, and that you are incapable of doing
it, if you would: He knows, that you would be
always struggling to break your Chains, and that
you would give him more Disturbance than all the
rest of the World. And therefore you may look
upon it as an undoubted Maxim, that he can intend
nothing less than you total Ruin and Destruction.</P>
<P>From thence he proceeded to inveigh against
the Orators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and the Orators.</NOTE> for the treacherous Part they had
acted upon these Proceedings of <HI>Philip;</HI> and he
did it with great Boldness and Acrimony, by
exposing their false Reasoning, their false Zeal,
and their false Courage. He told the People, it
was in vain to think of their being victorious
abroad, so long as they nourish'd in their Bosom
these Pensioners and Creatures of their Enemy;
these domestick Foes, who were as so many hidden
Rocks and Shelves, upon which they must one
Day unavoidably suffer Shipwreck. He went on
to shew them, that the insolent Behaviour of
<HI>Philip</HI> towards them, was wholly owing to these
Haranguers, who sav'd him the trouble of ma∣naging
and undermining them, as he did the
other States, with an Appearance at least of
bearing them Good-will, and doing them good
<PB N="294" REF="320"/>
Offices. He instanc'd in the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> tha
tho' he had brought them under Subjection, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had taken some Pains to inveigle them into it
and had strow'd the Way to it with Flowers
by freeing them from their Tyrants, and by re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
storing them to their Seat among the <HI>Amphictyons</HI>
That he had drawn the poor <HI>Olynthians</HI> into hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Snare, by heaping his Favours upon them, and
had lull'd them asleep by his Cession of <HI>Potidae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
to them. That he had at present got the <HI>The∣bans</HI>
under his Dependence; but that he had
thought it proper to gild their Chains, by put∣ting
them in the Possession of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eotia,</HI> by laying
waste the Country of their Enemies the <HI>Phocians,</HI>
and by delivering them from a long and bur∣thensome
War. <HI>But why,</HI> says Demosthenes,
<HI>does he not think it worth his while to amuse you
with some such Marks of his Complaisance and his
Bounty? Why does he not endeavour to gain upon
you by some real or pretended Benefits? On the
contrary, he infringes your Treaties, breaks into
your Alliances, and seizes your Possessions; and does
it with an high Hand, without so much as at∣tempting
to excuse, or dissemble it.</HI> He tells them
the Reason of this Difference in <HI>Philip</HI>'s Conduct
with regard to them, was, because he had no need
of keeping any Measures with them, or of saving
Appearances: For that he knew he had a Party
among them, who were always ready to plead
his Cause, and to justify all his Proceedings.
<HI>Athens,</HI> says Demosthenes, <HI>is the only City of
<PB N="295" REF="321"/>
Greece,</HI> where a Man may, with Impunity, display
his Eloquence in Defence, and even in Praise of the
common Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>He expatiated further upon the base and un∣generous
Artifices of the Orators, in persecu∣ting
their Fellow-Citizens.</HI> They, <HI>said he,</HI> who
have no real Concern for the Welfare of the
Publick, may with Ease and Safety censure, ar∣raign
and condemn. They can always secure them∣selves
from Danger by their inexhaustible Fund of
Flattery and Dissimulation; by their daily shifting
and changing their Opinion, according to the dif∣ferent
Taste and Humour of the People; and by
disguising and concealing from them the weak and
disorderly State of their Affaris. <HI>The truly brave
and zealous Citizen he describes in another
manner:</HI> That the only thing he has in view, is
the Peoples Interest; that, in order to promote
it, he opposes their Inclinations, combats their Opi∣nion,
and makes no Concessions to them out of
Complaisance; that he delivers his Mind freely
and openly, according to the best of his Judg∣ment;
and makes himself accountable to them not
only for the Reasonableness of his Advice, but like∣wise
for the Success of it. Demosthenes <HI>does not
directly apply this Character to himself; but
it may be easily collected from what follows,
that he thought it belong'd to him.</HI> I know,
<HI>says he,</HI> Fellow-Citizens, as well as others, how
to flatter, to accuse, to proscribe, and to practise
all those other little Arts of gaining Credit with
<PB N="296" REF="322"/>
you; but I have a Soul above it. I have no
Avarice, nor Ambition; my chief Aim is to re∣peat
and inculcate those Truths, which, because
they are distasteful to you, must therefore give my
Rivals the Preference in your Favour; and yet
they are such, as, if you would hearken to them,
would give you the advantage over your Enemies.
It is to me a Part unworthy of a good Citizen,
to study ways of rising on a sudden to the highest
Rank of Men in <HI>Athens,</HI> when you are at the
same time sinking to the lowest Rank of Men in
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>When he had thus endeavour'd to open their
Eyes, and to free them from their Dependence
on the other Orators, he press'd them to pro∣ceed
forthwith to Action. <HI>It is my part,</HI> says
he, <HI>to propose; it is yours to resolve, and to exe∣cute.</HI>
He concludes with exhorting them to sup∣ply
the Necessities of the State; to keep their
Troops on foot, and in good Discipline; to
dispatch Ambassadors to all Parts, with Instru∣ctions
to communicate their Resolutions, and
to give notice of the common Danger that
threaten'd <HI>Greece;</HI> and thereupon to negotiate
and conclude whatever should be thought re∣quisite
for the Service of the Common-wealth.
And above all, he advis'd them to shew no
Mercy to those who prostituted themselves for
Gain to the Enemy of their Country.</P>
<P>Whatever effect these Remonstrances had for
the present, <HI>Philip</HI> was not discourag'd from
<PB N="297" REF="323"/>
making further Attempts:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip</HI> takes ad∣vantage of the Divisi∣ons in <HI>Pe∣loponne∣sus.</HI></NOTE> And he was fur∣nish'd
with a Pretence for it by the Divisions
which were now in <HI>Peloponnesus;</HI> and they were
owing chiefly to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who having lit∣tle
to do in the late Foreign Transactions, were
recovering their Strengh at home, and, accord∣ing
to their usual Practice, as they increas'd
in Power, made use of it to insult and op∣press
their Neighbours. The <HI>Argives</HI> and
<HI>Messenians</HI> being at this time persecuted by
them, put themselves under the Protection of
<HI>Philip;</HI> and the <HI>Thebans</HI> joining with them,
they all together form'd a powerful Confede∣racy.
The natural Balance against it, was an
Union between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> which the
<HI>Spartans</HI> press'd with great Earnestness, as the
only means for their common Security; and
<HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Thebans</HI> did all in their Power
to prevent it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demo∣sthenes</HI> spi∣rits up the <HI>Athenians</HI> against him.</NOTE> But <HI>Demosthenes</HI> exerting him∣self
upon this Occasion, rous'd up the <HI>Athe∣nians;</HI>
and put them so far upon their Guard,
that, without coming to an open Rupture with
<HI>Philip,</HI> they oblig'd him to desist.</P>
<P>This Storm in <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> was no sooner
blown over, but another happen'd, which fell
more immediately upon the <HI>Athenians;</HI> and that
was an Attempt upon <HI>Euboea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip's <HI>Attempt upon</HI> Eu∣boea.</NOTE> <HI>Philip</HI> had long
form'd a Design against this Island, as being
not only a rich Acquisition, but an easy Pas∣sage
into the Continent of <HI>Attica;</HI> and in or∣der
now to execute it, he had gain'd some of
<PB N="298" REF="324"/>
the principal Men, who suffer'd him to throw
in a Body of <HI>Macedonians;</HI> by means where∣of
he demolish'd some Places, and fortified
others, and erected several petty Tyrants, who
acted in his Name, and under his Authority.
<HI>Plutarchus</HI> of <HI>Eretria,</HI> or <HI>Clitarchus</HI> (as he is
otherwise call'd) sent to let the <HI>Athenians</HI> know,
That the Island must be lost, if it were not
immediately reliev'd: Whereupon they dispatch'd
some few Troops thither under the Command
of <HI>Phocion.</HI> This <HI>Plutarchus,</HI> upon their Arri∣val,
chang'd his Opinion, and made head against
them. However <HI>Phocion</HI> was not discourag'd;
he gave him battle, and routed him, and ha∣ving
gain'd a signal Victory, return'd home.
He was succeeded in the Command by one
<HI>Molossus,</HI> who was not equal to it, and suffer'd
himself to be taken Prisoner. But it does not
appear, that <HI>Philip</HI> prosecuted this War to any
further Advantage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island preserve'd by <HI>Phoci∣on.</HI></NOTE> so that the Recovery of the
Island may be ascrib'd to <HI>Phocion.</HI></P>
<P>He had, before this Action, given several.
Proos of his Courage and Capacity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha∣racter.</NOTE> but he
began now to distinguish himself as a General,
and to bear a principal Part in the Affairs of
the Government. As he had Talents very well
suited to both these Capacities, he did not ap∣prove
the modern Practice of allotting the Civil
Power to one Sett of Men, and the Military
to another, but was for having them united in
the same Persons, as they formerly were in <HI>Solon,
<PB N="299" REF="325"/>
Aristides</HI> and <HI>Pericles.</HI> He had studied Philoso∣phy
under <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Xenorates:</HI> and in Ora∣tory
he was upon a level with the best Speak∣ers
of his time. He was not so pompous and
diffuse as they; but was better heard than most
of them. His Manner was plain and concise,
strong and pointed, full of Matter and good
Sense, and always to the purpose. When he
was one Day in the Assembly observ'd to be
very pensive, and his Friends ask'd him the
Reason of it, <HI>I am considering,</HI> said he, <HI>how to
contract what I have to say.</HI> And <HI>Demosthenes,</HI>
who had a secret Jealousy of him, was wont
to call him, <HI>The Pruning-book of his Periods.</HI>
This Brevity and Simplicity in his Diction,
was of the <HI>Spartan</HI> kind; and he had still more
of the <HI>Spartan</HI> in his manner of Deportment.
He had such a settled Composure in his Coun∣tenance,
that he was never seen either to laugh
or cry. He was grave and austere even to
Moroseness; insomuch that they who were Stran∣gers
to him, did not care to accost him. But this
Severity was more in his Appearance than in
his Temper: For he was naturally very easy
and conversable; humane and beneficent; and a
great Patron of the distress'd, even of those
who had most oppos'd him. His Friends re∣proving
him for pleading in behalf of an ill
Man, He told them, <HI>The Innocent had no need
of an Advocate.</HI> In the Camp he went very
thinly clad, and generally barefoot; and he lived
<PB N="300" REF="326"/>
at home with his Family much in the same
coarse hardy way. There is upon this occasi∣on
a remarkable Saying of his Wife, who was
noted for her Virtue and good House-wifery;
and being visited by an <HI>Ionian</HI> Woman of Di∣stinction,
who shew'd her all her Jewels, Em∣broidery,
and other rich Ornaments, <HI>For my
part,</HI> said she to her, <HI>My only Ornament, is my
good Man</HI> Phocion, <HI>who has commanded the</HI> Athe∣nians
<HI>now these twenty Years.</HI> He was not so
happy in his Son, who being inclined to Luxu∣ry
and Excess, he sent him to <HI>Sparta</HI> to be put
into a stricter way of Education; and <HI>Demades</HI>
repoarch'd him with it publickly, as an Attempt
to introduce the <HI>Spartan</HI> Manners and Disci∣pline.
He certainly had a very bad Opinion
of the Manners of his Country, and would glad∣ly
have reform'd them; but he could not do
it otherwise than by his Example; and that was
of small Force against so general a Corruption.
However as to his own particular, it gain'd
him an Awe and Attention from those who
would not imitate him. It created such an Opi∣nion
of him, that he was chosen General up∣on
Forty five several Expeditions, and always
in his Absence: For tho' he did not decline
the Service when he was call'd to it, he never
put himself in the way of it. He was so far
from making a servile court to the People,
or soothing them in their Follies, that he took
all Occasions of thwarting and opposing them
<PB N="301" REF="327"/>
and he would never give up a point which he
thought necessary for the Good or Safety of the
Publick. The Oracle having, upon a certain
Occasion, told the <HI>Athenians,</HI> That there was
one Man in the City of a different Opinion
from the rest, and Enquiry being made who this
should be; <HI>I,</HI> said Phocion, <HI>am the Man; I am
pleas'd with nothing that the Common People say, or
do.</HI> Another time, when he had deliver'd his Opi∣nion
to them, and found that it was generally
approved, <HI>I wish,</HI> said he, turning to his Friend,
<HI>That what I have propos'd, be not wrong.</HI> He
was so tenacious in what he thought most
adviseable, that he would rather suffer himself
to be treated as a Coward, than enter into a
War, which did not appear to him to be just and
necessary. There is an Instance of this kind,
when being press'd to engage the Enemy at a
disadvantage, <HI>No,</HI> said he, <HI>You cannot at this
time make me valiant, nor I you wise.</HI> The truth
is, he was naturally inclin'd to Peace, and con∣sider'd
War no otherwise than as the means of
procuring it. He endeavour'd, by several pri∣vate
Negotiations, to put an end to the War
with the <HI>Macedonians;</HI> and herein he seem'd to
act the Part of a Mediator: But the Modera∣tion
and Complaisance, which he shew'd in this
Correspondence with the Enemies of his Coun∣try,
created a Suspicion of his being too well
affected to them; and at last it cost him his
Life. He certainly was upon good Terms with
<PB N="302" REF="328"/>
<HI>Philip, Alexander</HI> and <HI>Antipater,</HI> who all suc∣cessively
esteem'd and caress'd him, and would
have loaded him with Presents; but he could
not be prevail'd upon to accept any. Upon
this occasion <HI>Antipater</HI> was wont to say, <HI>I have
two Friends at</HI> Athens, Phocion <HI>and</HI> Demades;
<HI>of whom the former will not suffer me to gratify
him at all, and the other is never to be satisfy'd.
Phocion,</HI> upon the whole, was one of the wisest
and best sort of Men that <HI>Athens</HI> ever bred.
But the Steadiness of his Virtue, and the Sin∣gularity
of his Manners, would not let him drive
on with the Current of the Times he liv'd in;
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> mentions it as his Misfortune,
<HI>That he came to the Helm, when the Publick Bot∣tom
was just upon sinking.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> found his Affairs advance slow∣ly
in <HI>Euboea,</HI> he thought fit to retreat, and march'd
back to <HI>Thrace,</HI> in order to distress the <HI>Athenians</HI>
in those Parts, from whence they receiv'd a great
Part of their Provisions. With this View, in
the last Year of the 109th <HI>Olympiad,</HI> he laid
Siege to <HI>Perinthus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>be∣sieges</HI> Pe∣rinthus</NOTE>, and firmly attach'd to the <HI>Athenians.</HI> He
invested it with an Army of thirty thousand
Men; and having rais'd his Works to a great
heighth, so as to command those of the Enemy,
he made his Assault with all kinds of battering
Engines. The Inhabitants were no less active
and resolute on their Part; so that when <HI>Philip</HI>
had made a Breach in the Wall, which he thought
<PB N="303" REF="329"/>
sufficient to gain his Entrance into the Town, he
found they had run up another Wall within side;
by means whereof, together with the natural Ad∣vantage
of the Place, which rose up gradually in
the Form of a Theatre, they made a vigorous
Defence, and held out till they were reliev'd from
<HI>Byzantium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> to cut off this Communication, divided
his Army, and march'd with one half of it to
form the Siege of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> leaving the other
to carry on that of <HI>Perinthus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and</HI> Byzan∣tium.</NOTE> These violent
Proceedings gave a general Alarm both in <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Persia.</HI> The Lieutenants of the Provinces
near the Coasts, were order'd to assist the Be∣sieg'd
with what Forces they could spare. The
Islands of <HI>Chios, Cos</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> united in the
same Design; and the <HI>Athenians</HI> began now to
exert themselves in earnest. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had be∣fore
endeavour'd to awaken them out of their
Lethargy, and to convince them, that the first
Attack against <HI>Perinthus</HI> was an open Violation
of the Peace: And they so far gave Attention
to him, that <HI>Chares</HI> was sent out with a Fleet.
But he was a bad Man, and of a mean Capacity;
and as such, he was pitch'd upon by the Creatures
of <HI>Philip</HI> for this Service. He behav'd accord∣ing
to their Expectations, and had so little Credit
with the Allies of <HI>Athens</HI> upon the <HI>Hellespont,</HI>
that they did not care to admit him into their
Ports. But the People now being grown more
sensible of their Danger, thought it necessary to
<PB N="304" REF="330"/>
appoint some other Commander, on whom they
could better depend; and accordingly <HI>Phocion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
was order'd out with a fresh Supply of Forces.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> had hitherto endeavour'd, by many spe∣cious
Pretences, to cover his Designs, and to
keep Measures with the <HI>Athenians:</HI> But when he
found they had taken the Alarm, and were arm∣ing
so many others against him, he wrote them
an expostulatory Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He endea∣vours to justify his Proceedings</NOTE> wherein he charg'd them
with the Infraction of their Treaties, and with
many other Injuries, which he pretended to have
receiv'd from them. It was full of Complaints,
Reproaches and Menaces, and was drawn in a
very masterly manner, with so much Art and
Delicacy, with such a Variety of Facts, and such
plausible Reasoning upon them, and with such a
Spirit of Majesty throughout the Whole, that it
may be look'd upon as one of the finest Pieces
of Antiquity. It was calculated for the Use of
the Partizans at <HI>Athens,</HI> so as to furnish them
with Materials for pleading his Cause in the
Assembly; and the Intent of it was, to try if it
were yet too late to divert the People from push∣ing
things to an Extremity. The Point that he
laid the greatest Stress upon, was the engaging
the <HI>Persians</HI> against him; and this he imputed to
the <HI>Athenians.</HI> It does not clearly appear how
far they were concern'd in it: But it is certain,
that, in order to check the Growth of his Power.
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> had prepar'd the People for an Al∣liance
with <HI>Persia,</HI> and still press'd it; and <HI>Pau∣sanias</HI>
<PB N="305" REF="331"/>
says, that the <HI>Persian</HI> Troops, which were
employ'd on this occasion, were commanded by
<HI>Apollodorus</HI> an <HI>Athenian.</HI> From such Circum∣stances
as these, <HI>Philip</HI> thought himself suffici∣ently
warranted to remonstrate in the manner
he did to the <HI>Athenians.</HI> He told them, <HI>That
by this Instance of their calling in the</HI> Persians,
<HI>and that at a time when he was in peace with them,
they had shewn more Hatred and Rancour against
him, than in cases of the most open and declared En∣mity
between them; That they had acted in it
contrary to all the Rules of Prudence and Poli∣cy,
and to the constant Practice not only of their
Ancestors, but of themselves likewise.</HI> And to this
purpose, he reminded them, that they had some
time since pass'd a formal Resolution, to invite
him to act in conjunction with them and the
other <HI>Grecians,</HI> against the <HI>Persians,</HI> as <HI>Barbari∣ans,</HI>
and as their common Enemy. His ap∣plying
these Appellations of <HI>Barbarians</HI> and Fo∣reigners
to the <HI>Persians,</HI> was an artful way of
disclaiming them with regard to himself, and
of blending together the Interests of <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> as if they were inseparable. <HI>Demo∣sthenes,</HI>
to prevent the Impressions this Letter
might make upon the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demo∣sthenes</HI> re:futes him.</NOTE> endeavour'd, by
way of Answer, to expose the Fallacy of the
Arguments contain'd in it. They were found∣ed
wholly upon a Presumption, that the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI>
were the Aggressors: But it was noto∣rious,
that <HI>Philip</HI> was taking their Places, in∣tercepting
<PB N="306" REF="332"/>
their Provisions, attacking their Allies,
and making every Day fresh Incroachments upon
them, and that in a time of profound Peace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as he calls it, and before any Measures had
been taken by the <HI>Athenians</HI> to oppose him
This was the Truth of the Case; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which <HI>Demosthenes</HI> thought it more necessary to
convince the People of, than to go about to
justify, or to refute the Facts they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
charg'd with. He told them, <HI>The Lette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

long since made the same Declaration by his Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tions;
and that by the Peace he had conclude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

proceeded to his usual Topick of reproving
them for their Sloth, and for suffering them

him out of the <HI>Hellespont.</HI> It is said, that the
Siege of <HI>Perinthus</HI> was rais'd before by the <HI>Per∣sians;</HI>
but whatever hand they had in it, the Inha∣bitants
of that Place, as well as of <HI>Byzantium,</HI>
ascribed their Deliverance wholly to the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and testified it in the most solemn manner, giv∣ing
them liberty to settle among them, and in∣termarry
with them, and granting them great∣er
Privileges and Immunities, than their own
Citizens enjoy'd. They also consecrated Crowns,
and erected Statues to them. The Inhabitants
of the <HI>Chersonese,</HI> in token of the like Deliver∣ance,
rais'd Altars to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and decreed
to them a Crown of Gold. So terrible was
the Name of <HI>Philip</HI> grown to the People in
these Parts, that they thought they could ne∣ver
give sufficient Proofs of their Gratitude to
those who had freed them from him. And
as to himself, his Disappointment in this Ex∣pedition,
with the Loss of a good Number of
his Men, was the greatest Mortification he had
hitherto receiv'd. This reduced him to his old
Artifice, of endeavouring to renew the Peace
with <HI>Athens:</HI> And he kept up the Appearance
of negotiating it for the next two Years after
the Siege of <HI>Perinthus.</HI> But he was arming all
the while, and making new Infractions; and
<PB N="308" REF="334"/>
the subsequent Account of his Proceedings will
shew, that there was no way left of bringing
things to a Determination, but by the Sword.</P>
<P>Without waiting the Result of his last Over∣ture
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip's</HI> Expedition into Scy∣thia:</NOTE> he march'd against <HI>Atheas</HI>
King of <HI>Scythia,</HI> upon a pretence, that he had
not gratified him for the Assistance he had giv∣en
him in his Wars against the <HI>Istrians.</HI> The
<HI>Scythians</HI> gave him battle; but tho' they were
far superior in Number, he defeated them, and
carried off a great deal of Booty, which con∣sisted
chiefly of Women and Children, and
Cattle; and among the latter, there were twenty
thousand Mares for breeding. In his Return,
the <HI>Triballi</HI> of <HI>Moesia</HI> pretending to a Share of
the Spoil, disputed his Passage; and thereupon
ensued a sharp Conflict, wherein his Horse was
kill'd under him, and himself so wounded, that
he must have fallen into the Enemies hands,
if he had not been rescued by his Son <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI>
who was with him in this Expedition,
and gave this early token of what might one
Day be expected from him.</P>
<P>The Peace in the mean time was under consi∣deration
at <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Over∣tures of Peace re∣jected at <HI>Athens;</HI></NOTE> and the People were divided
concerning it, according to the different Senti∣ments
of their Leaders. <HI>Phocion</HI> was for ac∣cepting
it, but was strongly oppos'd by <HI>De∣mosthenes;</HI>
and his Advice for rejecting it pre∣vail'd. When <HI>Philip</HI> sound the <HI>Athenians</HI> would
not treat with him, and that they were acting
<PB N="309" REF="335"/>
offensively against him, especially at Sea, where
they block'd up his Ports, and put an intire
stop to his Commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">whereupon he forms new Alli∣ances,</NOTE> he began to form new
Alliances against them, particularly with the
<HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Thessalians,</HI> without whom he knew
he could not keep open his Passage into <HI>Greece.</HI>
At the same time he was sensible, that his en∣gaging
these Powers to act directly against <HI>A∣thens,</HI>
and in his own personal Quarrel, would
have so bad an Aspect, that they would not
easily come into it. For which reason, he en∣deavour'd
underhand to create new Disturban∣ces
in <HI>Greece,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and creates fresh Di∣visions in <HI>Greece.</HI></NOTE> that he might take such a part
in them, as would best answer his Views: And
when the Flame was kindled, his Point was to
appear rather to be call'd in as an Assistant,
than to act as a Principal.</P>
<P>These fresh Commotions took their Rise from
the <HI>Locri Ozolae,</HI> who border'd upon the <HI>Pho∣cians,</HI>
and were accus'd of the same Act of Pro∣fanation
which they had committed in breaking
up a piece of Ground belonging to the Temple
of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphi:</HI> And this Case was referr'd,
in the same manner as the former was, to the
<HI>Amphictyons,</HI> who, in order to form their Judg∣ment
upon the Matter in dispute, went to take
a view upon the Place, but were so insulted
and attack'd by the <HI>Locrians,</HI> that they were
forc'd to fly for it. Hereupon both Sides had
recourse to Arms, and there was all the Ap∣pearance
of a second <HI>Holy War.</HI> But it was
<PB N="310" REF="336"/>
not carried on with the same Zeal as the for∣mer;
it was ended almost as soon as it began
and serv'd only to advance <HI>Philip</HI>'s Authority
in <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His De∣signs pro∣moted by Aeschines.</NOTE> This was owing chiefly to <HI>Aeschines</HI>
who was secretly his Agent, and had, by his
means, got himself to be deputed on the part
of <HI>Athens,</HI> as one of the Members in the pre∣sent
Assembly of the <HI>Amphictyons.</HI> When he
found the War went on so heavily, and that
they, who were to contribute towards it, were very
backward in sending in their Quota's, he pro∣pos'd
to the rest of the Deputies, that the seve∣ral
States which they represented, should either
hire Foreign Troops, and tax themselves to pay
them, or that, in order to save that Trouble
and Expence, they should choose <HI>Philip</HI> for their
General. They readily swallow'd the Bait that
was laid for them, and agreed to the latter
of these Proposals. Hereupon a formal Em∣bassy
was sent to <HI>Philip,</HI> to demand his Assi∣stance
in avenging the Honour of the Deity;
and to notify to him, That the <HI>Grecians</HI> had,
by their Representatives in the Council of the
<HI>Amphictyons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip</HI> cho∣sen Gene∣ral against the <HI>Locri∣ans.</HI></NOTE> chosen him their General for that
purpose, with full Power to proceed in the man∣ner
he should judge most proper.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> did not want much Persuasion to ac∣cept
the Offer of that, which he had so
eagerly pursu'd, and which was, in effect,
the Completion of all his other Designs. He
unmediately got his Troops together, and began
<PB N="311" REF="337"/>
his March: But instead of going on to cha∣stise
the <HI>Lorcrians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He seizes upon Ela∣têa.</NOTE> he made a sudden turn, and
seiz'd upon <HI>Elatêa</HI> a capital City of <HI>Phocis,</HI>
which was very well situated for awing the <HI>The∣bans,</HI>
of whom he began to grow jealous, and
for preparing his way to <HI>Atheans.</HI> But by so
extraordinary a Step as this, he fairly threw off
the Mask, and bad defiance to the whole Body
of the <HI>Grecians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI> a∣larm'd at it.</NOTE></P>
<P>The News of it arriving at <HI>Athens</HI> in the
Evening, the Trumpets sounded the Alarm, and
the City was fill'd with Terror and Amazement.
The next Morning the Assembly met, and all
the Generals and Orators assisted at it: But
when it was expected, that some of the Mem∣bers
should rise to offer their Advice upon the
present Exigency, every body sat mute and con∣founded.
The Crier made Proclamation, and
demanded, according to the usual Form, <HI>Who
of them was dispos'd to speak?</HI> No body yet of∣fering,
the same Question was several times re∣peated;
but still to no purpose. At length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are animated by <HI>Demo∣sthenes.</HI></NOTE> in
this general dead Silence, <HI>Demosthenes</HI> rose up,
and endeavour'd to dispel their Fears, and to
animate them for their Defence. The most im∣mediate
Danger they apprehended from <HI>Philip,</HI>
was his late Alliance with the <HI>Thebans;</HI> and
this was the point that <HI>Demosthenes</HI> labour'd
chiefly to clear up to them, and to make
it appear, that the <HI>Thebans</HI> were not so strong∣ly
attach'd to him as they imagin'd. <HI>For
<PB N="312" REF="338"/>
if it were so,</HI> said he, <HI>we should not now have
heard of his being at</HI> Elatêa, <HI>but in</HI> Attica. To
which he added, <HI>That however the</HI> Thebans <HI>might
before have been deluded by him, this last Proceed∣ing
of his had more fully open'd their Eyes. It is
true,</HI> said he, <HI>some part of them he had gain'd by
Mony and Artifice; and he has drawn down his
Troops to keep them in heart, and to intimidate
the rest, who are the greatest Part, and who have
hitherto oppos'd him, and would still continue to
do so, if they had any Prospect of being supported.</HI>
Wherefore he propos'd, That all who were able
to bear Arms, should march out of the City,
and make a general Rendezvous at <HI>Eleusis,</HI> as
well to set an Example to the rest of <HI>Greece</HI> for
asserting the common Liberty, as to shew the
<HI>Thebans</HI> in particular, that they were ready to
protect and assist them. And in regard to that
inveterate Enmity and Rancour, which had so
long subsisted between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Thebes,</HI> he
advis'd the People to suppress it for the pre∣sent,
and not to revive the Memory of past In∣juries,
which, he told them, would only serve to
hinder, or retard that Union and good Corre∣spondence,
which were now become so necessary
for their mutual Preservation. He further pro∣pos'd,
That Ambassadors should be sent to the
several States of <HI>Greece,</HI> to make it a common
Cause; but especially, and in the first place to
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> as they were more immediately ex∣pos'd,
and as they were the Barrier to <HI>Athens.</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="339"/>
The Assembly readily agreed to this Advice
of <HI>Demosthenes;</HI> and pursuant thereto, a Decree
in form was drawn up, with an additional Clause,
That a Fleet of two hundred Sail should be
fitted out, to cruize near <HI>Thermopylae.</HI></P>
<P>There being no time to be lost in this Ne∣gotiation
with the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Nego∣tiation with the <HI>Thebans.</HI></NOTE> Ambassadors were
forthwith dispatch'd to them, with <HI>Demosthenes</HI>
at the head of them; and they were met by
others on the part of <HI>Philip.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Python</HI> op∣poses him.</NOTE> The principal of
them was <HI>Python,</HI> who was a <HI>Byzantine</HI> by Birth,
and had been made a free Citizen of <HI>Athens,</HI>
but was now in <HI>Philip</HI>'s Interest. He was a
very able and forcible Speaker, and therefore
was upon this occasion oppos'd to <HI>Demosthenes.</HI>
The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were heard first, the Prefe∣rence
being given to them as Friends and Allies.
They set out with large Encomiums upon <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI>
and after a long Recital of the many Bene∣fits
and Advantages the <HI>Thebans</HI> had receiv'd
from him, and the many Injuries and Provo∣cations
they had receiv'd from <HI>Athens,</HI> they
endeavour'd to excite their Gratitude on the
one hand, and to fire their Resentment on the
other. They also tempted them with the Hopes
of Booty, which, they told them, they should
find in great abundance in <HI>Attica,</HI> and that they
would at the same time prevent the ravaging
their own Country, and making it the Seat of
the War, which would be the necessary Conse∣quence
of their entering into an Alliance with
<PB N="314" REF="340"/>
<HI>Athens.</HI> Upon the whole, they propos'd to them
in the alternative, either that they should join
with <HI>Philip</HI> in the Invasion of <HI>Attica,</HI> or that
they should sit still, and give him a free Passage
thorugh <HI>Boeotia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Demosthenes,</HI> by way of Reply, used the
same king of Reasoning with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> as
he had done with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to convince
them of the Necessity of proceeding against
<HI>Philip</HI> as their common Enemy: For that
whatever Words or Pretences he made use of,
his Designs were too visible from his Actions.
He instanc'd particularly in the manner of his
seizing upon <HI>Elatêa.</HI> He told them, <HI>That in
case he should succeed so far as to conquer</HI> Attica,
Thebes <HI>would suffer in its Turn; That he would go
on from one City, and one Province to another, and
would never stop 'till he had made himself Master
of the whole.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> were not very inclinable to enter
into any Engagements on either side: They had
too lively a Sense of the Miseries they had un∣dergone,
especially whilst the Wounds they had
receiv'd in the <HI>Phocian</HI> War were still fresh up∣on
them. But <HI>Demosthenes</HI> fired them to such a
degree, that they were no longer Masters of
themselves. The Force of his Eloquence, upon
this Occasion, is said <HI>to have cast a Mist over their
Understanding, to have carried them away like a
Whirlwind, and to have work'd them up to a sort
of Enthusiasm:</HI> Insomuch that, laying aside all
<PB N="315" REF="341"/>
Fear and Gratitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The∣bans</HI> enter into an Alliance with <HI>A∣thens.</HI></NOTE> and other prudential Con∣siderations,
they declar'd themselves for the Al∣liance
with <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>That which animated <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> next to his
Zeal for the publick Safety, was his having to do
with a Man of <HI>Python</HI>'s Abilities; and he some
time after, took occasion to value himself upon
the Victory he had obtained over him. <HI>I did
not give way,</HI> said he, <HI>to the boasting</HI> Python, <HI>when
he would have bore me down with a Torrent of
Words.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demosthe∣nes</HI> values himself upon his Success.</NOTE> He gloried more in the Success of this
Negotiation, than of any other he had been
employ'd in, and spoke of it as his Master∣piece
in Politicks. It was certainly of the great∣est
Importance to <HI>Athens</HI> at this time, when
<HI>Philip</HI> seem'd fully bent on her Destruction, and
when she had no other immediate Prospect of
Relief, but from the gaining the <HI>Thebans. De∣mosthenes</HI>
therefore, to do himself Justice, put the
People in mind of the Danger they had escap'd.
He told them, <HI>It was he, who had dispersed that
Cloud which hung over the City, and that, by this
Instance of his unwearied Diligence and Zeal for
the Publick, he had exceeded all that had been done
by the greatest Orators of former Ages.</HI> He was
generally more modest than he appears to have
been in this Case: But it must be consider'd,
that what he said upon this Occasion, was some
time after, in his Defence against <HI>Aeschines,</HI> who,
by his artful and invidious insinuations, had put
him under a Necessity of enumerating his Ser∣vices
<PB N="316" REF="342"/>
to the Common-wealth, and of set∣ting
them in the strongest Light they would
bear.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> found himself thus disappointed
of the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip's Artifices to avoid fighting.</NOTE> he sued again to the <HI>Athenians</HI>
for Peace: but they saw his Drift too plainly
to trust him, and were too much exasperated
to hearken to any Terms of Accommodation.
However, he resolved to stand it out with them,
and both Sides prepared for Battle. But before
it came to Action, he try'd another Stratagem;
which was, by bribing the Oracle, to terrify them
with fatal Omens and predictions concerning the
Event of it. <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> to prevent these
Warnings making any deep Impression, treated
them with the utmost Contempt; and it was
upon this Occasion, that he charged the
Priestess with <HI>Philippizing.</HI> He put the <HI>Thebans</HI>
in mind of their <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> and the <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
of <HI>Pericles,</HI> who, he told them, were go∣vern'd
by Reason and good Sense, and would
not suffer themselves to be carried away by such
idle superstitious Fancies, which they look'd
upon only as a Cloak for Cowardice. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> were so eager for the War, that they
easily got the better of these frightful Appre∣hensions;
and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had, by his las<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Treaty, gain'd such an Ascendant both ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them and the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they submitted them¦selves intirely to his Directions.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="343"/>
Accordingly they took the Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 110. 3. The Battle at <HI>Chero∣nêa.</HI></NOTE> and en∣camp'd
together near <HI>Cheronêa</HI> in <HI>Boeotia;</HI> where
<HI>Philip</HI> met them with thirty thousand Foot,
and two thousand Horse. He was somewhat
superior to them in Numbers, and more so in
the Goodness of his Officers. He gave the Com∣mand
of the left Wing of his Army to his Son
<HI>Alexander,</HI> but, in regard to his Youth, he
placed the best of his Officers about him; and
the right Wing he took to himself. In the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Army, the <HI>Thebans</HI> were on the right,
and the <HI>Athenians</HI> on the left. At Sun-rising
the two Armies join'd Battle, and behav'd with
such equal Courage and Bravery, that it was
long before any Impression was made on either
side; till at length <HI>Alexander,</HI> exerting himself in
an extraordinary manner, broke in upon the
<HI>Sacred Band</HI> of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and cut them to
Pieces; after which, the rest of that Wing were
easily routed. <HI>Philip,</HI> who had to do with the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> forc'd them likewise to give way:
But they soon recover'd their Ground; and <HI>Ly∣sicles,</HI>
who, in Conjunction with <HI>Chares,</HI> com∣manded
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Troops, push'd forwards
into the Centre of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Army; where, ima∣gining
himself victorious, he cry'd out to his
Men, <HI>Come on, let us pursue them to</HI> Macedonia.
<HI>Philip,</HI> observing what pass'd, and that <HI>Lysicles,</HI>
instead of attacking his Phalanx in Flank, when
he had so fair an Opportunity, went on a
wild disorderly Pursuit, said cooly, <HI>The Athenians

drew up his Phalanx on a little Eminence, from

them. It was upon this Occasion, that <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

and the Loss, on the Part of the <HI>Thebans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
was much the same.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> was transported with this Victory beyond
measure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Beha∣viour upon it.</NOTE> and having drank to Excess at an En∣tertainment,
which he gave upon that Occa∣sion,
went into the Field of Battle, where he in∣sulted
over the Slain, and upbraided the Pri∣soners
with their Misfortunes. He leap'd and
danc'd about in a frantick manner, and with
an Air of Burlesque sung the Beginning of the
Decree, which <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had drawn up as a
Declaration of the War against him. <HI>Demades</HI>
who was in the Number of the Prisoners, had
the Courage to reproach him with this unge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nerous Behaviour, telling him, <HI>That Fortune ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
given him the Part of</HI> Agamemnon, <HI>but that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was acting that of</HI> Thersites. He was so struck
with the Justness of this Reproof, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
wrought a thorough Change in him; and he
<PB N="319" REF="345"/>
was so far from being offended at <HI>Demades,</HI> that
he immediately gave him his Liberty, and
shew'd him afterwards great Marks of Honour
and Friendship. He likewise releas'd all the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Captives, and without Ransom; and
when they found him so generously dispos'd to∣wards
them, they made a Demand of their Bag∣gage,
with every thing else that had been taken
from them; but to that <HI>Philip</HI> reply'd, <HI>Surely they
think I have not beat them.</HI> This Discharge of the
Prisoners was ascrib'd in a great measure to <HI>De∣mades,</HI>
who is said to have new modell'd <HI>Philip,</HI>
and to have soften'd his Temper with the <HI>Attick
Graces,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> expresses it: And <HI>Philip</HI> him∣self
acknowledg'd upon another Occasion, that
his frequent Converse with the <HI>Athenian</HI> Orators,
had been of great use to him in correcting his
Morals. <HI>Justin</HI> represents his Carriage after the
Battle in a very different Light; as that he took
abundance of Pains to dissemble his Joy; that
he affected great Modesty and Compassion, and
was not seen to laugh; that he would have no
Sacrifice, no Crowns nor Perfumes; that he for∣bad
all kind of Sports; and did nothing that
might make him appear to the Conquerors to be
elated, nor to the Conquer'd, to be insolent.
But this Account seems to have been confounded
with others, which were given of him after his
being reform'd by <HI>Demades.</HI> It is certain, that
after his first Transport was over, and that he
began to recollect himself, he shew'd great Hu∣manity
<PB N="320" REF="346"/>
to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and that, in order stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to keep measures with them, he renew'd the
Peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He renews the Peace with <HI>A∣thens.</HI></NOTE> But the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who had renounc'd
their Alliance with him, he treated in another
manner. He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Severi∣ty towards the <HI>The∣bans.</HI></NOTE> who affected to be as much Master
of his Allies, as of his Subjects, could not easily
pardon those who had deserted him in so critical
a Conjuncture. Wherefore he not only took
Ransom for their Prisoners, but made them pay
for leave to bury their Dead. It is further said,
that either by the Sword, or by Banishment, he
clear'd the City of the principal Men who had
stood in Opposition to him, and confiscated their
Goods; That he recall'd all such as had been
banish'd for espousing his Interest, and made 'em
Judges and Magistrates, with a Power of Life
and Death over those who had been the Authors
of their Exile. After these Severities, and after
having plac'd a strong Garrison over them, he
granted them a Peace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Battle of Cheronêa, to the
Death of Philip of Macedon. Containing the Space of above One Year.</HEAD>
<P>THE Generality of the <HI>Athenians</HI> were not
much dejected upon this Overthrow, espe∣cially
since <HI>Philip</HI> had shewn so much Moderation
<PB N="321" REF="347"/>
towards them: But they who saw further into
the Consequences of it, were not very easy in
their present Situation. <HI>Isocrates</HI> was more par∣ticularly
affected with the Loss and Disgrace they
had suffer'd; and was so apprehensive, that <HI>Philip</HI>
would make some further use of his Victory, that
he chose rather to starve himself to death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isocrates</HI> starves himself.</NOTE> than
to survive the Liberty of his Country: Which is
a sufficient Proof, that his Intimacy with <HI>Philip,</HI>
which has before been mention'd, was with an
Intent to serve the Common-wealth; and that
his End was good, tho' he was mistaken in the
Means of attaining it, and in the Man he had
to deal with. The Truth is, he was not con∣versant
enough in publick Affairs. His proper
Province was his School, wherein he succeeded
beyond any Man of his Time; and he got so much
Mony by it, that he was oblig'd to build a Gally,
and maintain it at his own Charge. <HI>Plutarch</HI>
condemns him for his unactive and recluse way of
Life, and sets him in a very pedantick Light:
That he sat poring at home in his Study, when
every Body else was in Arms: That, instead of
sharpening his Sword and his Spear, and bright∣ning
up his Helmet, he was adapting, ranging
and polishing his Words and Sentences; and
that he was three <HI>Olympiads</HI> in composing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Panegyrick.</NOTE> one
single Oration. <HI>How,</HI> says he, <HI>would that Man
have been terrified at the clattering of Weapons, or
the routing of a Phalanx, who was so afraid of
<PB N="322" REF="348"/>
suffering one Vowel to clash with another, or to
pronounce a Word where the Syllables were uneven?</HI>
But notwithstanding this Piece of Raillery, he
was generally respected and admir'd, not only as
a perfect Master in his Profession, but as a tho∣rough
Well-wisher to his Country.</P>
<P>The Enemies of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> were not wanting
on this Occasion, to accuse him as the Author of
their Misfortunes. But the Generality of the
People still retain'd their former good Opinion of
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con∣duct of <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI> approved.</NOTE> and not only acquitted him of all that had
been laid to his Charge, but restor'd him to the
Management of their Affairs, and put them∣selves
wholly under his Care and Guidance, to
provide for their future Security. As a further
Instance of their Regard for him, they pitch'd
upon him as the most proper Person to speak
the Funeral Oration upon the Interment of the
Slain. Nothing could be a stronger Mark of
their Approbation of his Services, than the ap∣pointing
him, who had advis'd the War, to ce∣lebrate
the Memory of those who were kill'd in
it. And it is mention'd to the Honour of the
People likewise, that, contrary to their usual
Practice, they had distinguish'd so rightly in the
present Case of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and judg'd of him
according to the Zeal and Intention of his Ser∣vice,
and not according to the Success.</P>
<P>This Defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill
Conduct of the Generals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lysicles put to death</NOTE> <HI>Lysicles</HI> and <HI>Chares;</HI>

Orators of the first Rank, and free from the ge∣neral
Corruption which then reign'd among them.
He manag'd the publick Treasure for twelve
Years with great Uprightness, and had all his
Life long the Reputation of a Man of Honour
and Virtue. He encreas'd the Shipping, supply'd
the Arsenal, drove the bad Men out of the City,
and fram'd several good Laws. He kept an ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct
Register of every thing he did during his
Administration; and when that was expir'd, he
caus'd it to be fix'd up to a Pillar, that every
Body might be at liberty to inspect it, and to
censure his Conduct. He carried this Point so
far, that, in his last Sickness, he order'd himslef
to be carried to the Senate-house, to give a pub∣lick
Account of all his Actions; and after he
had refuted one who accus'd him there, he went
home and died. Notwithstanding the Austerity
of his Temper, he was a great Encourager of
<PB N="324" REF="350"/>
the Stage; which, tho' it had been carried to a
Excess that was mainfestly hurtful to the Publick
he still look'd upon as the best School to instru
and polish the Minds of the People: And
this end, he kept up a Spirit to Emulation
mong the Writers of Tragedy, and erected t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Statues of <HI>Aeschylus, Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
left three Sons who were unworthy of him, an

but <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> out of regard to the Memory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
their Father, got them discharg'd.</P>
<P>It does not appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of</HI> Chares.</NOTE> that <HI>Chares</HI> underwent an
Prosecution for his Share in this Action; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
according to his general Character, he deserv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
as much or more than his Colleague. For he had
no Talents for Command, and was very little
different from a common Soldier. <HI>Timotheus</HI> sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of him, <HI>That instead of being a General, he was
fitter to carry the General's Baggage.</HI> His Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
indeed was of that robust kind of Make; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was that which serv'd in some measure to recom∣mend
him to the People: But he was more
Man of Pleasure, than Fatigue. In his Militar
Expeditions, he was wont to carry with him
Band of Musick; and he defray'd the Expenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of it out of the Soldiers Pay. Notwithstanding
his want of Abilities, he had a thorough goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Opinion of himself. He was vain and positiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bold and boisterous; a great Undertaker, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
always ready to warrant Success; but his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
formances seldom answer'd; and hence it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="325" REF="351"/>
that <HI>Chares</HI>'s <HI>Promises</HI> became a Proverb. And
yet as little as he was to be depended on, he had
his Partizans among the People, and among the
Orators, by whose Means he got himself to be
frequently employ'd, and others to be excluded
who were more capable. As he had no true
Merit of his own, he could the less bear it in
those who had: This was the Grounds of his ma∣licious
Charge against <HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus;</HI>
and the manner in which it was carried on, has
already been mention'd as a Reproach to the
Common-wealth. In short, he was a bad Man,
as well as a bad Officer, and did very little real
Service or Honour to his Country, either at home
or abroad.</P>
<P>This Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 110. 4. <HI>The Death and Cha∣racter</HI> of Timoleon</NOTE> being the last of the hundred and
tenth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> died <HI>Timoleon.</HI> He had some
time before lost his Sight, which he bore very
patiently; and the <HI>Syracusians,</HI> to alleviate his
Affliction, and to shew their Respect and Gra∣titude
to him, went in great Numbers to visit
him, and carried with them all the Strangers in
those Parts, to entertain them with the Sight of
their great Benefactor. Notwithstanding his
Blindness, he continu'd to the last to give his
Attention to the Publick. When any Matter of
Moment came before the Assembly, he was con∣ducted
to the Theatre in a Sort of Carr, and was
usher'd in with the joyful Acclamations and Be∣nedictions
of the People; and when he had de∣liver'd
his Opinion, they were always determin'd
<PB N="326" REF="352"/>
by it. He was buried at the Charge of the
Publick, with great Pomp, and with a general
Lamentation; and Anniversary Games were in
stituted to do Honour to his Memory. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which endear'd him so much to the <HI>Syracusians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
besides the great things he had done for them
was his living and dying among them as thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
common Father, and as a Native of <HI>Sicily,</HI> with∣out regard to the Honours and Applause, that
he might have receiv'd upon his return to <HI>Greece.</HI>
But he was a wise and moderate Man, as well as
valiant and fortunate; he knew where to stop,
and how to enjoy the Fruits of his Conquests.
There is hardly an Instance of any other <HI>Grecian,</HI>
who, after such Success, went quietly to his Grave,
without exposing himself further, so as to fall a
Sacrifice either to his own Ambition, or to the
Insolence and Ingratitude of his Countrymen.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> observes a remarkable Difference between
the Atchievements of <HI>Timoleon,</HI> and those of his
Contemporaries: That in those of <HI>Timotheus, A∣gesilaus,
Pelopidas,</HI> and even of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who
was the Pattern that <HI>Timoleon</HI> copied after, there
was a certain Stiffness, Labour and Struggling,
which took off from the Merit and Lustre of
them; but that those of <HI>Timolcon</HI> were like the
Poetry of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the Painting of <HI>Nicoma∣chus,</HI>
which, besides the Strength and Beauty,
that they had in common with others, were more
free and easy, more gracesul and more masterly.
We can never too much admire and extol the
<PB N="327" REF="353"/>
easy Progress that he made with an handful of
Men in <HI>Sicily,</HI> by driving out the Tyrants, dis∣persing
the numerous Fleets and Armies of the
<HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and taking <HI>Syracuse,</HI> one of the
strongest Cities of the World, and which had so
long withstood all the Power of <HI>Athens;</HI> tho' it
must be confess'd, that it was not so well forti∣fied,
nor so well defended now, as in the Time
of the <HI>Peloponnesian</HI> War. But tho' his Actions
were so generally applauded, it happen'd once,
that two of the <HI>Syracusians,</HI> who were popular
Speakers, brought a Charge against him for some
Part of his Conduct as General; and one of 'em
demanded, that he should give Security for his
Appearance; which the People were highly of∣fended
at, as thinking that, in his Case, the or∣dinary
Forms of Justice ought to be dispensed
with. But he would not suffer himself to be ex∣empted
from a due Observance of the Laws,
which he had taken so much Pains to enforce
against others. However, when the Matter
came to be heard, he treated it as a Piece of
Calumny, and instead of going about to refute
it, he only thank'd the Gods, that they had
granted his Request; for that he had liv'd to see
the <HI>Syracusians</HI> now at Liberty to say whatever
they thought fit. He lest them in full Possession
of the Liberty both of speaking and acting; and
they enjoy'd it about twenty Years, till the ill
use they made of it, gave Rise to the Tyranny
<PB N="328" REF="354"/>
of <HI>Agathocles,</HI> who brought them again into their
former Condition.</P>
<P>The Battle of <HI>Cheronêa</HI> was so decisive, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from thence we may date the Downfal of the
Liberties of <HI>Greece.</HI> For tho' <HI>Philip</HI> did not
pursue his Advantage so far as might naturally
have been expected; yet the Terror of his Arms
kept the whole Country in awe, and pav'd the
Way to its more intire Subjection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>pro∣poses an Ex∣pedition a∣gainst</HI> Per∣sia,</NOTE> The Point
which he had in view, and which he had long
form'd in his Thoughts, was an Expedition a∣gainst
<HI>Persia:</HI> And as this was not easily to be
carried on without the Assistance of the <HI>Grecians,</HI>
he engag'd them, under a Pretence of revenging
the Wrongs they had receiv'd from the <HI>Barba∣rians,</HI>
to join with him in it, and got himself
to be declar'd their Captain General;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and is de∣clared Cap∣tain Gene∣ral.</HI></NOTE> which
was a principal Motive with him in this Un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>But
whilst he was making the necessary Pre∣parations
for this war, he was diverted from
it by the Affairs of his Family. He suffer'd
great Uneasiness with his Wife <HI>Olympias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He divorces</HI> Olympias,</NOTE> who
was of a turbulent, jealous and revengeful Tem∣per,
and had also given him strong Suspicions of
her Chastity; insomuch that, tho' there was no

to divorce her,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marries</HI> Cleopatra.</NOTE> and married <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> a
very beautiful young Woman, and Niece to
<HI>Attalus,</HI> one of his principal Officers. <HI>Attalus</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="355"/>
was transported with the Honour done to his
Family, and being heated with Wine at the
Marriage Feast, said publickly, <HI>The</HI> Macedonians
<HI>ought now to invoke the Gods, that the new Queen
might bring</HI> Philip <HI>a lawful Successor. Alexander,</HI>
who was before disgusted at the Treatment his
Mother had met with, was now more thorougly
provok'd at that which so nearly concern'd him∣self.
<HI>What?</HI> said he, <HI>Do you then take me for a
Bastard?</HI> And in a Rage threw his Cup at him;
which <HI>Attalus</HI> return'd. <HI>Philip,</HI> who sat at ano∣ther
Table, was so incens'd at what had pass'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uarrels with his Son</HI> Alex∣ander.</NOTE> 
that he drew his Sword, and run at his Son as
the Disturber of the Feast; but being lame he
fell down, and gave the Company time to in∣terpose.
But <HI>Alexander</HI> was not to be pacified;
they had much ado to keep him from destroy∣ing
himself. He was so far from submitting
himself to his Father, that he rallied him upon
his Fall. <HI>In troth,</HI> said he, <HI>the</HI> Macedonians <HI>are
mighty well fitted with a General to conduct them
out of</HI> Europe <HI>into</HI> Asia, <HI>who is not able to go from
one Table to another without danger of breaking his
Neck.</HI> With this Sarcasm he quitted the Room,
and retir'd to <HI>Illyrium,</HI> having first carried his Mo∣ther
to <HI>Epirus.</HI> But this Affair was afterwards
made up by Means of <HI>Demaratus</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI>
who being in great Credit and Confidence with
<HI>Philip,</HI> made him sensible, that he had gone too
far in his Resentment against his Son, and there∣upon
was sent to bring him back.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="356"/>
<HI>Philip,</HI> soon after this Accident, met with ano∣ther
of the same kind, which prov'd more fatal
to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mar∣riage of his Daughter</HI> Cleopatra.</NOTE> This happen'd upon the Marriage of
his Daughter <HI>Cleopatra</HI> with <HI>Alexander</HI> King of
<HI>Epirus,</HI> and Brother of <HI>Olympias. Philip,</HI> to
add to the Solemnity of the Nuptials, and to
do himself Honour upon his intended Expedi∣tion,
which he had still very much at Heart,
made a most magnificent Entertainment, and in∣vited
all the most considerable Men of <HI>Greece,</HI>
taking this Opportunity to testify his Grati∣tude
for their having chosen him their General.
The several Cities, from whence they came,
were not wanting on their Part to compliment
him on the Occasion, and to flatter his Vanity:
They vy'd with one another in sending him
Crowns of Gold; and <HI>Athens</HI> was not less zea∣lous
and devoted to him than the rest. The
next Day after the Feast, there were publick
Shews to be exhibited, and <HI>Philip</HI> went in great
Pomp to assist at them, being dress'd in a white
Robe, and his Nobles and Guards attending
him in the form of a Procession. There were
carry'd before him twelve Images of the Gods
of exquisite sine Workmanship; and a thirteenth
was added, which was more splendid than the rest,
and was to represent himself as One among the
Number of the Deities. But in the Heighth
of the Solemnity, amidst the joyful Acclama∣tions
of a numberless Croud of Spectators from
all Parts, and just as his Statue enter'd the
<PB N="331" REF="357"/>
Theatre, the Ceremony was interrupted by <HI>Pau∣sanias</HI>
a young <HI>Macedonian</HI> Nobleman. He had
some time before been grosly affrnoted by <HI>Attalus,</HI>
who, after he had made him drunk, carnally
abused him, and then prostituted him to others.
<HI>Pausanias</HI> made his Complaint to the King,
and demanded Justice: But <HI>Philip</HI> did not care
to hearken to an Accusation against the Queen's
Uncle. The young Man renew'd his Suit, and
was so importunate for Redress, that at last
<HI>Philip,</HI> to pacify him, gave him a Commission
of the first Rank in his Guards. <HI>Pausanias</HI> did
not look upon this as a Satisfaction for the In∣jury
he had receiv'd; and tho' he stifled his
Revenge for some time, he took the present
Occasion of executing it in the most publick
manner upon the Person of the King. <HI>Philip</HI>
had order'd his Guards, both before and be∣hind,
to keep at a proper Distance from him,
so as to leave him room enough to appear more
conspicuously to the People; and as he march'd
alone in that intermediate Space, <HI>Pausanias</HI> made
up to him, drew his Dagger and stabb'd him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>kill'd</HI> by Pausanias.</NOTE> 
and left him dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P><HI>Pausanias</HI> had Horses ready for his Escape,
and had like to have succeeded in it; but one
of his Feet being hamper'd in a Vinc, he was
taken and cut to Pieces. <HI>Olympias</HI> is said to have
provided the Horses for this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olympias <HI>accessary to the Mur∣ther.</HI></NOTE> and was
look'd upon not only as privy to the Murther,
but as the chief Promoter of it. Neither was
<PB N="332" REF="358"/>
<HI>Alexander</HI> himself quite free from Suspicion. But
his Mother was so far from concealing the Part
she had in it, that she affected to make it pub∣lick,
and was only afraid lest the Proofs should
not appear strong enough against her. The very
Night she went to assist at the King's Funeral,
she caus'd a Crown of Gold to be put upon the
Head of <HI>Pausanias,</HI> whilst he was hanging up∣on
a Cross. Some Days after she buried him,
and erected a Tomb for him, and appointed an
Anniversary-day to be kept in Honour of his
Memory. She likewise consecrated the Dagger
with which he committed the Fact. Then she
turn'd her Rage against <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> for whom
she had been divorced; and having murther'd
her Infant Child at her Breast, caus'd her to
be hang'd. From these and several other In∣stances,
which might be given of her Cruelty
and Revenge, it may easily be believ'd, that
she was more than consenting to the Assassina∣tion
of the King, and that she made use of the
Resentment of <HI>Pausanias,</HI> to satisfy her own.</P>
<P>The News of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Death was a joyful
Surprise in <HI>Greece,</HI> and particularly in <HI>Athens,</HI>
where the People crown'd themselves with Gar∣lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The man∣ner in which the News of</HI> Philip'<HI>s Death was receiv'd at</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and decreed a Crown to <HI>Pausanias.</HI> They
sacrific'd to the Gods for their Deliverance, and
sung Songs of Triumph, as if <HI>Philip</HI> had been
slain by them in Battle. But this Excess of
Joy did ill become them: It was look'd upon
as an ungenerous and unmanly Insult upon the
<PB N="333" REF="359"/>
Ashes of a murther'd Prince, and of one whom
they just before had rever'd, and crouch'd to
in the most abject manner. These immode∣rate
Transports were rais'd in them by <HI>De∣mosthenes,</HI>
who having the first Intelligence of
<HI>Philip</HI>'s Death, went into the Assembly unusu∣ally
gay and chearful, with a Chaplet on his
Head, and in a rich Habit, tho' it were then
but the seventh Day after the Death of his
Daughter. From this Circumstance <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
at the same time that he condemns the Beha∣viour
of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in general upon this Oc∣casion,
takes an Handle to justify <HI>Demosthenes,</HI>
and extols him as a Patriot, for not suffering
his Domestick Afflictions to interfere with the
Good-fortune of the Common-wealth. But he
certainly might have acted the Part of a good
Citizen with more Decency and Composure,
and more to the Honour of himself and his
Country.</P>
<P>This Accident happen'd to <HI>Philip</HI> in the
forty seventh Year of his Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3668. Olymp. 111. 1.</NOTE> and the twenty
fifth of his Reign; during which time he was
constantly in Action, 'till by Degrees he chang'd
the whole Face of Affairs, both in <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia.</HI> The Steps by which he advanc'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> 
were firm and sure, but withal so slow and im∣perceptible,
that he seem'd to have no great
Share of Ambition; and yet in reality Nobody
had more; but Nobody had it so much under
Command, nor knew so well how to disguise it.
<PB N="334" REF="360"/>
It was varnish'd over, as as his Actions in ge∣neral
were, with false Colours; it had the Ap∣pearance
of Justice and Humanity, and Benefi∣cence
to Mankind, in protecting the Innocent,
redressing the Injur'd, and extirpating Tyranny:
But his Acts of this kind were only plausible
Methods of advancing his own Grandeur and
Authority, and of subverting the Publick Li∣berty,
under a Pretence of defending it.</P>
<P>He was admirably well qualified for the part
he acted. For he had an equal Mixture of
Fire and Phlegm, which serv'd to correct
each other: The first put him upon form∣ing
great Designs, and the latter conducted
him in the Execution of them; so that his Suc∣cess
was owing chiefly to this due Tempera∣ment,
which made him cautious without Fear,
and bold without Rashness. When he had ta∣ken
his point, he kept it always in view, and
conceal'd it from every body else. For he
trusted no body further than was necessary; he
had Favourites, but no Confidents. He was his
own Minister, his own General, and his own
Treasurer; and as he had all the Capacity, Vi∣gilance
and Activity, which these several Offi∣ces
requir'd, he was intirely Master of his own
Schemes, and of the Execution of them. Which
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> takes notice of, as a particular Advan∣tage
that he had over the <HI>Athenians,</HI> by being
so secret in his Deliberations, and so uncon∣troul'd
in his Actions. And the Case was much
<PB N="335" REF="361"/>
the same in the other Republicks, where Mat∣ters
of the most secret Importance were can∣vass'd
and debated in their popular Assemblies,
the Resolutions taken upon those Debates were
made publick, and the Hands of those who
were to executed them, were tied up; and by
these means they generally lost their Effect, es∣pecially
with regard to <HI>Philip,</HI> who knew so
well the Constitution of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Use
that was to be made of such a Method of pro∣ceeding.</P>
<P>He
look'd upon all means of attaining his
ends to be justifiable; and he had Expedients
of all kinds, and for all Occasions. He knew
all the different ways that were to lead him to
his Mark; but he generally chose that which was
most dark and intricate, and out of the common
Road. He lov'd Feints and Stratagems for the
Pleasure of deceiving; and he valued himself
less upon the Success of a Battle, than of a Ne∣gotiation:
For which reason he seldom employ'd
Force, 'till his Artifices fail'd him. And yet
when he found himself obliged to have recourse
to Arms, no body behaved with more Brave∣ry
and Intrepidity, nor with better Conduct.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> therefore bears too hard upon him,
when speaking of him by way of comparison
with <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> He says, He had none of
the principal Virtues of that Great Man, and,
among his other Defects, mentions his want of
Courage. But there does not appear to be the
<PB N="336" REF="362"/>
least Foundation for this Charge; and it has
been refuted by his greatest Enemy <HI>Demosthenes,</HI>
who describes him with his Eye out, his Col∣lar-bone
broke, his Hand and his Leg maim'd;
and then adds, That he had seen this <HI>Philip</HI>
thus wounded from Head to Foot, still ready
to throw himself into the midst of Dangers,
and to sacrifice the rest of his Body in the fur∣ther
Pursuit of Glory.</P>
<P>He infused the same Spirit into his Soldiers,
who were so animated by his Example, and
so inured to Action, that he could always de∣pend
on them. He had also a way of gain∣ing
their Affections: He would call them his
Comrades, and treat them otherwise with great
Familiarity; and he did it in such a manner,
as neither to lessen his Authority, nor relax the
Discipline. They were grown so hardy and ex∣pert
under him, that the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Troops
were reckon'd at this time almost as much su∣perior
to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> as the <HI>Grecians</HI> were to
the <HI>Persians.</HI> These were the Men whom <HI>Clytus</HI>
afterwards reproach'd <HI>Alexander</HI> with, when he
told him, <HI>It was his Father's Troops, by which
he had conquer'd. Alexander</HI> was too sensible of
the truth of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it cost the old Man his
Life.</P>
<P>If <HI>Philip</HI> had been equal in other respects to
what he was in the Field, he had made a glo∣rious
Figure: But his Tricks and Subterfuges
and deep Dissimulation, his gross Bribery, Trea
<PB N="337" REF="363"/>
chery and Breach of Faith, which make up the
main of his Character, have cast such a Shade
over his real good Qualities, that they are hardly
to be distinguish'd, and have given occasion to
call even his military Virtues in question. But
in that respect, he was undoubtedly superior to
all the Captains of his time: And he had other∣wise
great Talents. He had a fine Understand∣ing,
with a strong and clear Judgment; great
Prudence and Foresight; great Variety of Learn∣ing,
and other acquir'd Knowledge. He spoke
and wrote with great Ease, Propriety and Dig∣nity,
but with too much Art and Subtilty: For
there was Design and Insincerity in every thing
he said, whether he were in jest, or in earnest.
He always promis'd more than he intended to
perform; and he had as little regard to his Oath,
as to his Promise. To this purpose he had a
Saying, <HI>That Children were to be cheated with
Play-things, and Men with Oaths.</HI> And yet
notwithstanding this impious Maxim of his, he
made a great Shew of Religion, and it was that
which gain'd him his first footing in <HI>Greece</HI>
in the <HI>Phocian</HI> War. Among his other Arts
of Hypocrisy, by which he impos'd upon the
World, we may reckon that of his being at∣tended
every Morning by a Servant, to put
him in mind of his Mortality. His Friendships
were govern'd wholly by his Interest: They
were only mercenary Engagements, that he had
<PB N="338" REF="364"/>
enter'd into with bad Men, and for bad Ends
and when they had serv'd his Purpose, he had done
with them. This was the Case of most of his
Agents who sold their Country to him; he paid
them their Price, and then discarded them;
for he lov'd the Treason, but not the Traytor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Of which there was a memorable Instance in
his Treatment of the two Magistrates, who be∣tray'd
<HI>Olynthus</HI> to him. When they found them∣selves
universally scouted and contemn'd for that
Act of Treachery, and even by the common Sol∣diers
in his own Army, they applied to him for
Protection and Redress; but he gave them a very
short Answer, and a very cutting one; <HI>O!</HI> said
he, <HI>you must not mind what such blunt Fellows
say, who call every thing by its own Name.</HI> He
had a particular Faculty of setting two Friends
at variance, and by that means of getting in∣to
their Confidence. And this was his main
Artifice in the carrying on his Designs against
<HI>Greece,</HI> by sowing Jealousies, fomenting Quar∣rels,
and playing one State against another; and
when he had, by these Methods, broke into
their Alliances, and separated their Interests, the
remaining Part was not difficult. His hardest
Task was with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> with whom he was
continually either fighting, or treating: And
tho' they had, 'till his time, the Reputation of
a more resined Wit than their Neighbours, and
of more Sagacity, Penetration and Attention
<PB N="339" REF="365"/>
to their Interests; yet he found means to amuse
and confound them, to delude and insatuate
them, to corrupt and divide them.</P>
<P>He was not so taken up in the pursuit of
his Ambition, but that he found time for his
Pleasures, wherein he indulg'd himself in a very
dissolute and licentious manner; and in this part
of his Life, he acted openly, and without Re∣serve.
He lov'd Riot and Drunkenness, and
Intemperance of all kinds, and encourag'd them
so much in others, that he was surrounded with
a Set of lewd Parasites and Debauchees, Play∣ers,
Buffoons and Pantomimes, who engross'd
all his Favours, and shar'd all his Bounty; but
amidst these Excesses, he had, or affected to
have, some Sense of Shame; so that when he
had committed any Acts of Violence or In∣justice,
he would easily bear Reproof, and often
repair the Injury. There was a Woman who
put her self in his way, after he had been sitting
long at Table, and demanded justice of him.
He heard her Case, and determin'd against
her. <HI>Then,</HI> said she, <HI>I will appeal. What?
From your King?</HI> said <HI>Philip. And who is it you
would appeal to? To</HI> Philip, <HI>when he is sober,</HI>
she replied. Whereupon he examin'd the Af∣sair
over again, and finding he had given a
wrong Judgment, made a new one in her Fa∣vour.
Another Woman had long solicited an
Audience of him upon a like Occasion; and be∣ing
<PB N="340" REF="366"/>
put off from time to time, with a pretence
that he was not at leisure, she could bear no
longer, but said to him, <HI>If you have not time
to do me Justice, cease to be King.</HI> He was so
far from resenting her manner of reproaching
him, that he immediately redress'd her Griev∣ance;
and from thenceforwards he became more
exact in giving Audience to his Subjects. There
was another Instance of a good sort of Man,
whom he was advis'd to banish, for having spo∣ken
ill of him; <HI>No,</HI> said <HI>Philip, Let me consider
first, whether I have not given him Occasion for
it.</HI> And being afterwards inform'd, that he had
never given him any Mark of his Favour, and
that he was in bad Circumstances, he reliev'd
him. When the Man had tasted of his Boun∣ty,
he chang'd his Note, and spoke as much
in his Praise: which gave occasion to <HI>Philip</HI> to
make another Reflection, <HI>That Kings have it
in their own power to be belov'd or hated.</HI> He
has given several other Proofs of his <HI>swallowing
Injuries,</HI> as <HI>Longinus</HI> calls it; and some remar∣ka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
Instances of his Clemency and Forbear∣an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have been already mention'd in the Reci∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of his Actions.</P>
<P>Thus by a Mixture of some good Qualities,
with a great many bad ones, he accomplish'd
his Ends, so far at least, that he had throughly
open'd the Way to the Destruction of the Liber∣ties
of <HI>Greece,</HI> and laid the Foundation of all his
<PB N="341" REF="367"/>
Son's Glory. And if the Actions of each of them
be duly weigh'd, it will be found, that <HI>Philip</HI>'s
Part was the more difficult of the two. For it
was certainly easier to conquer <HI>Asia</HI> with the
Assistance of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> than to break the
Power of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who had so often beat
the <HI>Asiaticks.</HI> Wherefore we may venture to
pronounce, That tho' <HI>Alexander</HI> was the greater
Conqueror, <HI>Philip</HI> was the greater Man. How∣ever
they were both form'd for the Task they
undertook. If <HI>Philip</HI> had liv'd to pass over into
<HI>Asia,</HI> his artful and deliberate Valour would
not, in all Likelihood, have had so good
an Effect there, as the Heroick Ardour and
Impetuosity of his Son, which bore down
every thing that oppos'd him, and which
carried him on with such Rapidity through
the whole Body of the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire.
But however <HI>Philip</HI> might have succeeded in
that Expedition, it seems pretty extraordinary,
that he should think of entring upon it,
before he had made a more intire Conquest
of <HI>Greece,</HI> which was certainly his original
Plan, and the Point, in which all his other
Views center'd: And his Success at <HI>Cheronêa</HI>
had given him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airest Prospect he ever
had, of subduing the whole Country. It had
put the <HI>Athenians</HI> and the <HI>Thebans</HI> so far in
his Power, that they were expecting every
Hour to have his Yoke impos'd on them.
<PB N="342" REF="368"/>
As to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> tho' they had avoided en∣tering
into the Quarrel, it is hardly to be sup∣pos'd
they would tamely have submitted to him
After the Battle, he wrote them an haughty Let∣ter,
to try how they would relish his Authority<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
But in Answer to it, their King <HI>Archidamus</HI> the
Son of <HI>Agesilaus</HI> sent him word, <HI>That if he mea∣sur'd
his Shadow, he would find it no bigger after
his Victory, than it was before.</HI> The Answer they
sent him to another Letter of the same kind,
was, <HI>Dionysius to Corinth.</HI> However, they were
not in a Condition singly to make Head against
him; and the other subordinate States were so
weak and disunited, and withal so indolent and
remiss, that there was no immediate Appearance
of forming any considerable League against
him. But whether he thought the <HI>Grecians</HI> were
still too formidable for him, to act in open De∣fiance
of them; and that his Shew of Mode∣ration
and Humanity, and his Arts of Insinua∣tion,
were easier and safer Methods of gaining
further Ground upon them; or whether he
really contented himself with the having hum∣bled
them, and with the Honour of presiding
in their Great Council, and of leading them
forth to Battle under the Title of their General,
it is certain, that he did not pursue his first
Scheme of Conquest against them, nor make
use of the Advantages, that he had then in his
Hands. He had still lest them in a Condition
<PB N="343" REF="369"/>
to recover their former Liberty, if they had
had any Remains of their former Spirit: But
that was so broken and decay'd, that they be∣came
an easy Prey to his Successors.</P>
