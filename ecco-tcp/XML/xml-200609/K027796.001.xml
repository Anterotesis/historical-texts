<HEAD>A GENERAL VIEW of the
EPIC POEM,
And of the
<HI>ILIAD</HI> and <HI>ODYSSEY.</HI>
Extracted from <HI>BOSSU.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Epic Poetry</NOTE> <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Fables of Poets were originally em∣ploy'd
in representing the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI>
according to the notion then conceiv'd of
it. This sublime Subject occasion'd the
first Poets to be call'd Divines, and Poe∣try
<HI>the Language of the Gods.</HI> They divided
the divine Attributes into so many Per∣sons;
because the infirmity of a human
Mind cannot sufficiently conceive, or ex∣plain,
so much Power and Action in a Simplicity so great and in∣divisible
as that of God. And perhaps they were also jealous of
the advantages they reap'd from such excellent and exalted learn∣ing,
and of which they thought the vulgar part of mankind was
not worthy.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="12"/>
They could not describe the Operations of this Almighty
Cause, without speaking at the same time of its Effects: so that
to Divinity they added <HI>Physiology,</HI> and treated of both, without
quitting the umbrages of their Allegorical Expressions.</P>
<P>But <HI>Man</HI> being the chief and the most noble of all that
God produc'd, and nothing being so proper, or more useful to
Poets than this Subject; they added it to the former, and trea∣ted
of the doctrine of <HI>Morality</HI> after the same manner as they
did that of Divinity and Philosophy: And from Morality thus
treated, is form'd that kind of Poem and Fable which we call
<HI>Epic.</HI></P>
<P>The Poets did the same in Morality, that the Divines had done
in Divinity. But that infinite variety of the actions and opera∣tions
of the Divine Nature, (to which our understanding bears
so small a proportion) did as it were force them upon dividing
the single Idea of the Only One God into several Persons, under
the different names of <HI>Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,</HI> and the rest.</P>
<P>And on the other hand, the nature of Moral Philosophy being
such, as never to treat of things in particular, but in general; the
Epic Poets were oblig'd to unite in one single Idea, in one and
the same Person, and in an Action which appear'd singular, all
that look'd like it in different persons, and in various actions;
which might be thus contain'd as so many <HI>Species</HI> under their
<HI>Genus.</HI></P>
<P>The Presence of the Deity, and the Care such an august Cause
is to be suppos'd to take about any action, obliges the Poet
to represent this action as great, important, and manag'd by
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Res gestae re∣gumque ducum∣que.</HI> Hor. Art. Poet.</NOTE> Kings and Princes. It obliges him likewise to think and speak
in an elevated way above the vulgar, and in a style that may
in some fort keep up the character of the Divine Persons he in∣troduces. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cui mens di∣vinior atque os Magna sona∣turum, des No∣minis hujus ho∣norem.</HI> Horat.</NOTE> To this end serve the poetical and figurative Expres∣sion,
and the Majesty of the Heroick Verse.</P>
<P>But all this, being divine and surprising, may quite ruin all
Probability: Therefore the Poet should take a peculiar care as to
that point, since his chief aim is to instruct, and without Proba∣bility
any action is less likely to persuade.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="13"/>
Lastly, since Precepts ought to be <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg"><HI>Quicquid praecipies esto brevis, ut citò dicta Percipiant animi dociles, teneantque fide∣les.</HI> Hor. Poet.</NOTE> concise, to be the more ea∣sily
conceiv'd, and less oppress the memory; and since nothing
can be more effectual to this end than proposing one single Idea,
and collecting all things so well together, as to be present to
our minds all at once; therefore the Poets have reduc'd all to
one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat, &amp; unum.</HI> bid.</NOTE> single action, under one and the same design, and in a
body whose members and parts should be homogeneous.</P>
<P>What we have observ'd of the nature of the Epic Poem, gives
us a just Idea of it, and we may define it thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Epic Poem is a discourse invented by art, to form
the Manners, by such instructions as are disguis'd under the
allegories of some One important Action, which is related in
verse, after a probable, diverting, and surprizing manner."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE> IN every design which a man deliberately undertakes, the end
he proposes is the first thing in his mind, and that by which
he governs the whole work, and all its parts: Thus since the End
of the Epic Poem is to regulate the Manners, 'tis with this first
view the Poet ought to begin.</P>
<P>But there is a great difference between the Philosophical and
the Poetical doctrine of Manners. The Schoolmen content
themselves with treating of Virtues and Vices in general: the
instructions they give are proper for all States, People, and for
all Ages. But the Poet has a nearer regard to his own Coun∣try,
and the necessities of his own nation. With this design he
makes choice of some piece of morality, the most proper and
just he can imagin: And in order to press this home, he makes
less use of the force of Reasoning, than of the power of Insinua∣tion;
accommodating himself to the particular customs and inclina∣tions
of those, who are to be the subject, or the readers, of his work.</P>
<P>Let us now see how <HI>Homer</HI> has acquitted himself in all these
respects.</P>
<P>He saw the <HI>Grecians,</HI> for whom he design'd his Poem, were
divided into as many States as they had capital Cities. Each was
<PB N="iv" REF="14"/>
a Body Politick apart, and had its form of government indepen∣dent
from all the rest. And yet these distinct States were very
often oblig'd to unite together in one body against their com∣mon
Enemies. These were two very different sorts of Govern∣ment,
such as could not be comprehended in one maxim of
morality, and in one single Poem.</P>
<P>The Poet therefore has made two distinct Fables of them.
The one is for <HI>Greece</HI> in general, united into one body, but
compos'd of parts independent on each other; and the other
for each particular state, consider'd as they were in time of peace,
without the former circumstances and the necessity of being
united.</P>
<P>As for the first sort of government, in the Union or rather
in the Confederacy of many independent States; experience has
always made it appear, <Q REND="inline">"That nothing so much causes success
as a due subordination, and a right understanding among the
chief commanders. And on the other hand, the inevitable
ruin of such confederacies proceeds from the heats, jealousies
and ambition of the differerent leaders, and the discontents of
submitting to a single General."</Q> All sorts of States, and in
particular the <HI>Grecians,</HI> had dearly experienc'd this truth. So that
the most useful and necessary instruction that could be given
them, was, to lay before their eyes the loss which both the
People and the Princes must of necessity suffer, by the ambition,
discord, and obstinacy of the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> then has taken for the foundation of his Fable this
great Truth; That a Misunderstanding between Princes is the
Ruin of their own States. <Q REND="inline">"I sing (says he) the Anger of <HI>Achil∣les,</HI>
so pernicious to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and the cause of so many
Heroe's deaths, occasion'd by the Discord and Separation of <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI>
and that Prince."</Q></P>
<P>But that this truth may be compleatly and fully known, there is
need of a second to support it. 'Tis necessary in such a design, not only
to represent the Confederate States at first disagreeing among them∣selves,
and from thence unfortunate; but to show the same States
afterwards reconciled and united, and of consequence victorious.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="15"/>
Let us now see how he has joyn'd all these in one general
action.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Several Princes independent on one another were united a∣gainst
a common enemy. The person whom they had elected
their General, offers an affront to the most valiant of all the
Confederates. This offended Prince is so far provoked, as to
relinquish the Union, and obstinately refuse to fight for the
common cause. This Mis-understanding gives the enemy such
an advantage, that the Allies are very near quitting their de∣sign
with dishonour. He himself who made the separation is
not exempt from sharing the misfortune which he brought up∣on
his party. For having permitted his intimate friend to
succour them in a great necessity, this friend is kill'd by the
enemy's General. Thus the contending Princes being both
made wiser at their own cost, are reconcil'd, and unite again:
Then this valiant Prince not only obtains the victory in the
publick cause, but revenges his private wrongs by killing with
his own hands the author of the death of his friend."</Q></P>
<P>This is the first Platform of the Poem, and the Fiction, which
reduces into one important and universal Action all the particu∣lars
upon which it turns.</P>
<P>In the next place it must be render'd Probable by the circumstan∣ces
of times, places and persons; Some persons must be found
out, already known by History or otherwise, whom we may
with Probability make the actors and personages of this Fable.
<HI>Homer</HI> has made choice of the siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and feign'd that this
action happen'd there. To a Phantome of his brain, whom he
would paint valiant and cholerick, he has given the name of <HI>A∣chilles</HI>;
that of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to his General; that of <HI>Hector</HI> to the
Enemies Commander, and so to the rest.</P>
<P>Besides, he was oblig'd to accommodate himself to the manners,
customs, and genius of the <HI>Greeks</HI> his Auditors, the better to make
them attend to the instruction of his Poem; and to gain their
approbation by praising them: So that they might the better
forgive him the representation of their own faults in some of his
<PB N="vi" REF="16"/>
chief Personages. He admirably discharges all these duties, by
making these brave Princes and those victorious people all <HI>Greci∣ans,</HI>
and the fathers of those he had a mind to commend.</P>
<P>But not being content, in a work of such a length, to propose
only the principal point of the Moral, and to fill up the rest with
useless ornaments and foreign incidents, he extends this Moral by
all its necessary consequences. As for instance in the subject
before us, 'tis not enough to know, that a good understanding
ought always to be maintain'd among Confederates: 'Tis likewise
of equal importance, that if there happens any division, care must
be taken to keep it secret from the enemy, that their ignorance
of this advantage may prevent their making use of it. And in
the second place, when their concord is but counterfeit and
only in appearance, one should never press the enemy too close∣ly;
for this would discover the weakness which we ought to
conceal from them.</P>
<P>The Episode of <HI>Patroclus</HI> most admirably furnishes us with these
two instructions. For when he appear'd in the arms of <HI>Achilles,</HI>
the <HI>Trojans,</HI> who took him for that Prince now reconciled and
united to the Confederates, immediately gave ground, and quit∣ted
the advantages they had before over the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But <HI>Patro∣clus,</HI>
who should have been contented with this success, presses
upon <HI>Hector</HI> too boldly, and by obliging him to fight, soon dis∣covers
that it was not the true <HI>Achilles</HI> who was clad in his ar∣mour,
but a Heroe of much inferior prowess. So that <HI>Hector</HI>
kills him, and regains those advantages which the <HI>Trojans</HI> had lost,
on the opinion that <HI>Achilles</HI> was reconciled.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></NOTE> THE <HI>Odyssey</HI> was not design'd, like the <HI>Iliad,</HI> for the instru∣ction
of all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> join'd in one body, but for each
State in particular. As a State is compos'd of two parts; the
Head which commands, and the Members which obey; there are
instructions requisite for both, to teach the one to govern, and
the others to submit to Government.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="17"/>
There are two Virtues necessary to one in authority, Prudence
to order, and Care to see his orders put in execution. The Pru∣dence
of a Politician is not acquir'd but by a long experience in
all sorts of business, and by an acquaintance with all the diffe∣rent
forms of Governments and States. The Care of the Admi∣nistration
suffers not him that has the Government to rely upon
others, but requires his own presence: And Kings who are ab∣sent
from their States, are in danger of losing them, and give
occasion to great disorders and confusion.</P>
<P>These two points may be easily united in one and the same
man. <Q REND="inline">* "A King forsakes his Kingdom to visit the courts
of several Princes, where he learns the manners and customs
of different nations. From hence there naturally arises a vast
number of incidents, of dangers, and of adventures, very use∣ful
for a Political Institution. On the other side, this Absence
gives way to the disorders which happen in his own kingdom,
and which end not till his return, whose presence only can re∣establish
all things."</Q> Thus the Absence of a King has the same
effects in this Fable, as the Division of the Princes had in the
former.</P>
<P>The Subjects have scarce any need but of one general max∣im,
which is, To suffer themselves to be govern'd, and to obey
faithfully; whatever reason they may imagine against the orders
they receiv'd. It is easy to join this instruction with the other,
by bestowing on this wise and industrious Prince such Subjects,
as in his absence would rather follow their own judgment than
his commands: and by demonstrating the misfortunes which this
disobedience draws upon them, the evil consequences which al∣most
infallibly attend these particular notions, which are entirely
different from the general Idaea of him who ought to govern.</P>
<P>But as it was necessary that the Princes in the <HI>Iliad</HI> shou'd be
cholerick and quarrelsome, so it is necessary in the Fable of the
<HI>Odyssey</HI> that the chief person should be sage and prudent. This
raises a difficulty in the Fiction; because this person ought to be
absent for the two reasons aforemention'd, which are essential to
the Fable, and which constitute the principal aim of it: But
<PB N="viii" REF="18"/>
he cannot absent himself, without offending against another
maxim of equal importance; <HI>viz.</HI> That a King should upon no
account leave his Country.</P>
<P>It is true, there are sometimes such necessities as sufficiently
excuse the Prudence of a Politician in this point. But such a
necessity is a thing important enough of it self to supply matter
for another Poem, and this multiplication of the action would
be vicious. To prevent which in the first place, this Necessity
and the departure of the Hero must be disjoin'd from the Poem;
and in the second place, the Hero having been oblig'd to ab∣sent
himself, for a reason antecedent to the action and plac'd
distinct from the Fable, he ought not so far to embrace this oppor∣nity
of instructing himself, as to absent himself voluntarily from
his own Government. For at this rate, his Absence would be
meerly Voluntary, and one might with reason lay to his charge
all the disorders which might arrive.</P>
<P>Thus in the constitution of the Fable, he ought not to take
for his action, and for the foundation of his Poem, the Depar∣ture
of a Prince from his own country, nor his voluntary stay
in any other place; but his Return, and this return retarded a∣gainst
his will. This is the first Idea <HI>Homer</HI> gives us of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Odyss. 5.</NOTE>
His Hero appears at first in a desolate Island, sitting upon the
side of the Sea, which with tears in his eyes he looks upon as
the obstacle that had so long oppos'd his Return, and detain'd
him from revisiting his own dear Country.</P>
<P>And lastly, since this forc'd delay might more naturally and
usually happen to such as make voyages by sea; <HI>Homer</HI> has ju∣diciously
made choice of a Prince whose Kingdom was in an
Island.</P>
<P>Let us see then how he has feign'd all this Action, making
his Hero a person in years, because Years are requisite to instruct
a man in Prudence and Policy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A Prince had been oblig'd to forsake his native Country,
and to head an Army of his Subjects in a foreign expedition.
Having gloriously perform'd this enterprise, he was marching
home again, and conducting his Subjects to his own State.
<PB N="ix" REF="19"/>
But spite of all the attempts, with which his eagerness to re∣turn
had inspir'd him, he was stopp'd by the way by tempests
for several years, and cast upon several countries differing from
each other in Manners and Government. In these dangers
his Companions, not always following his orders, perish'd
through their own fault. The Grandees of his country strange∣ly
abuse his absence, and raise no small disorders at home.
They consume his estate, conspire to destroy his son, would
constrain his Queen to accept of one of them for her Hus∣band;
and indulge themselves in all violence, so much the
more, because they were persuaded he would never return.
But at last he returns, and discovering himself only to his
son and some others, who had continu'd firm to him, he is an
eye-witness of the insolence of his enemies, punishes them ac∣cording
to their deserts, and restores to his Island that tran∣quility
and repose to which they had been strangers during
his absence."</Q></P>
<P>As the Truth, which serves for foundation to this fiction
is, that the Absence of a person from his own home, or
his neglect of his own affairs, is the cause of great disorders:
So the Principal point of the Action, and the most Essential
one, is the Absence of the Heroe. This fills almost all the
Poem: For not only this real absence lasted several years, but
even when the Heroe return'd, he does not discover himself;
and this prudent disguise, from whence he reap'd so much ad∣vantage,
has the same effect upon the Authors of the disor∣ders,
and all others who knew him not, as his real absence
had before, so that he is absent as to them, 'till the very mo∣ment
of their punishment.</P>
<P>After the Poet had thus compos'd his Fable, and join'd the Fi∣ction
to the Truth, he then makes choice of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> the King of
the Isle of <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to maintain the character of his chief Personage,
and bestow'd the rest upon <HI>Telemachus, Penelope, Antinous,</HI> and
others, whom he calls by what names he pleases.</P>
<P>I shall not here insist upon the many excellent advices, which
are so many parts, and natural consequences of the fundamental
<PB N="x" REF="20"/>
Truth; and which the Poet very dextrously lays down in those
fictions, which are the Episodes and Members of the entire Acti∣on.
Such for instance are these advices: Not to intrude one's
self into the Mysteries of Government, which the Prince keeps
secret: This is represented to us by the winds shut up in a bull∣hide,
which the miserable Companions of <HI>Ulysses</HI> would needs be
so foolish as to pry into. Not to suffer ones self to be led away
by the seeming Charms of an idle and inactive life, to which the
<HI>Sirens Songs</HI> invited.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Improba Si∣ren desidia.</HI> Horat.</NOTE> Not to suffer ones self to be sensualiz'd by
pleasures, like those who were chang'd into brutes by <HI>Circe:</HI>
And a great many other points of Morality necessary for all
sorts of people.</P>
<P>This Poem is more useful to the People than the <HI>Iliad,</HI> where
the Subjects suffer rather by the ill conduct of their Princes, than
through their own miscarriages. But in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> 'tis not the
fault of <HI>Ulysses</HI> that is the ruin of his Subjects. This wise
Prince leaves untry'd no method to make them partakers of the
benefit of his return. Thus the Poet in the <HI>Iliad</HI> says, <Q REND="inline">"He
sings the anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which had caused the death of so
many <HI>Grecians</HI>;"</Q> and on the contrary, in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Odyss. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Odyssey</HI> he tells
his Readers, <Q REND="inline">"That the Subjects perished through their own
fault."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Uni∣ty of the Fable.</NOTE> <HI>ARISTOTLE</HI> bestows great Encomiums on <HI>Homer</HI> for the
Simplicity of his design, because he has included in one single
part all that happen'd at the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> And to this he op∣poses
the ignorance of some Poets who imagin'd that the Unity
of the Fable or Action was sufficiently preserved by the Unity
of the Heroe: and who compos'd their <HI>Theseids, Heracleids,</HI> and
the like, wherein they only heap'd up in one Poem every thing
that happen'd to one Personage.</P>
<P>He finds fault with those Poets who were for reducing the U∣nity
of the <HI>Fable</HI> into the Unity of the <HI>Heroe,</HI> because one man
may have performed several adventures, which 'tis impossible to
<PB N="xi" REF="21"/>
reduce under any one and simple head. This reducing of all
things to Unity and Simplicity is what <HI>Horace</HI> likewise makes his
first Rule. <HI>Denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat, &amp; unum.</HI></P>
<P>According to these Rules, it will be allowable to make use of
several Fables; or (to speak more correctly) of several Incidents
which may be divided into several Fables; provided they are so
ordered, that the Unity of the Fable be not spoil'd. This liber∣ty
is still greater in the Epic Poem, because 'tis of a larger extent,
and ought to be entire and compleat.</P>
<P>I will explain my self more distinctly by the Practice of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt but one might make four distinct Fables out of
these four following Instructions.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Division between those of the same Party exposes them entirely
to their enemies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Conceal your Weakness, and you will be dreaded as much, as if
you had none of those imperfections, of which they are ignorant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When your strength is only feign'd, and founded only in the O∣pinion
of others; never venture so far as if your strength was real.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The more you agree together, the less hurt can your Enemies
do you.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>'Tis plain, I say, that each of these particular Maxims might
serve for the Ground-work of a Fiction, and one might make
four distinct Fables out of them. May one not then put all these
into one single <HI>Epopea?</HI> Not unless one single Fable can be made
out of all. The Poet indeed may have so much skill as to unite
all into one Body, as Members and Parts, each of which taken
asunder would be imperfect; and if he joins them so, as that
this Conjunction shall be no hindrance at all to the Unity and
the regular Simplicity of the Fable. This is what <HI>Homer</HI> has done
with such success in the composition of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>The Division between</HI> Achilles <HI>and his Allies tended to the ruin
of their Designs.</HI> 2. Patroclus <HI>comes to their relief in the Armour
of this Heroe, and</HI> Hector <HI>retreats.</HI> 3. <HI>But this young Man pushing
the advantage, which his disguize gave him, too far, ventures to en∣gage
with</HI> Hector <HI>himself; but not being master of</HI> Achilles<HI>'s strength
(whom he only represented in outward appearance) he is killed, and by</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="22"/>
<HI>this means leaves the</HI> Grecian <HI>Affairs in the same disorder, from
which in that disguise he came to free them.</HI> 4. Achilles <HI>provok'd
at the death of his Friend, is reconciled, and revenges his loss by the
death of</HI> Hector. These various incidents being thus united, do
not make different Actions and Fables, but are only the uncom∣pleat
and unfinish'd parts of one and the same Action and Fable,
which alone can be said to be compleat and entire: And all these
Maxims of the Moral, are easily reduc'd into these two parts,
which in my opinion cannot be separated without enervating the
force of both. The two parts are these, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Concordiâ res∣parvae crescunt: discordiâ mag∣nae dilabuntur.</HI> Salust. de bello Jug.</NOTE> That a right Under∣standing
is the preservation, and Discord the destruction of States.</P>
<P>Tho' then the Poet has made use of two parts in his Poems,
each of which might have serv'd for a Fable, as we have ob∣serv'd:
Yet this Multiplication cannot be call'd a vicious and ir∣regular
<HI>Polymythia,</HI> contrary to the necessary Unity and Simplicity
of the Fable; but it gives the Fable another qualification, alto∣gether
necessary and regular, namely its Perfection and finishing
stroke.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Acti∣on</HI> of the Epic Poem.</NOTE> THE Action of a Poem is the Subject which the Poet un∣dertakes,
proposes, and builds upon. So that the Moral and the
Instructions which are the End of the Epic Poem are not the
Matter of it. Those the Poets leave in their Allegorical and fi∣gurative
obscurity. They only give notice at the <HI>Exordium,</HI> that
they sing some <HI>Action.</HI> The <HI>Revenge of</HI> Achilles, the <HI>Return of</HI>
Ulysses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Since then the Action is the Matter of a Fable, it is evident
that whatever incidents are essential to the Fable, or consti∣tute
a part of it, are necessary also to the Action, and are parts
of the Epic Matter, none of which ought to be omitted. Such
for instance, are the contention of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> the
slaughter <HI>Hector</HI> makes in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army, the Re union of
the <HI>Greek</HI> Princes; and lastly, the Re-settlement and Victory
which was the consequence of that Re-union.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="23"/>
There are four qualifications in the Epic Action: the first is
its <HI>Unity,</HI> the second its <HI>Integrity,</HI> the third its <HI>Importance,</HI> the fourth
its <HI>Duration.</HI></P>
<P>The Unity of the Epic Action, as well as the Unity of the
Fable, does not consist either in the Unity of the Heroe, or in
the Unity of Time: Three things I suppose are necessary to it.
The first is, to make use of no Episode but what arises from the
very platform and foundation of the Action, and is as it were a
natural member of the body. The second is, exactly to Unite
these Episodes and these Members with one another. And the
third is, never to finish any Episode so as it may seem to be an
entire Action; but to let each Episode still appear in its own
particular nature, as the member of a body, and as a part of it
self not compleat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Be∣ginning, Mid∣dle, and End of the Action.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI> not only says that the Epic Action should be One,
but adds, that it should be entire, perfect, and compleat, and for
this purpose ought to have a <HI>Beginning,</HI> a <HI>Middle,</HI> and an <HI>End.</HI> These
three parts of a whole are too generally and universally denoted
by the words, Beginning, Middle, and End; we may interpret
them more precisely, and say, That the Causes and Designs of
an Action are the Beginning: That the Effects of these Causes,
and the Difficulties that are met with in the execution of these
designs, are the Middle; and that the Unravelling and Resolution
of these difficulties are the End.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI>'s design in the <HI>Iliad</HI> is to relate the Anger and Re∣venge
of <HI>Achilles.</HI> The Beginning of this Action is the Change
of <HI>Achilles</HI> from a calm to a passionate temper. The Middle
is the Effects of his Passion, and all the illustrious Deaths it is
the Cause of. The End of this same Action is the Return of <HI>A∣chilles</HI>
to his Calmness of temper again. All was quiet in the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, when <HI>Agamemnon</HI> their General provokes <HI>Apollo</HI>
against them, whom he was willing to appease afterwards at the
cost and prejudice of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who had no part in his fault.
This then is an exact Beginning: It supposes nothing before,
and requires after it the Effects of this Anger. <HI>Achilles</HI> revenges
himself, and that is an exact Middle; it supposes before it the
Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> this Revenge is the Effect of it. Then this
<PB N="xiv" REF="24"/>
Middle requires after it the Effects of this Revenge, which is
the Satisfaction of <HI>Achilles:</HI> for the Revenge had not been com∣pleat,
unless <HI>Achilles</HI> had been satisfied. By this means the Poet
makes his Heroe, after he was glutted by the Mischief he had
done to <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> by the death of <HI>Hector,</HI> and the Honour he
did his Friend, by insulting o'er his Murderer; he makes him, I
say, to be moved by the Tears and Misfortunes of King <HI>Priam.</HI>
We see him as calm at the End of the Poem, during the Fune∣ral
of <HI>Hector,</HI> as he was at the Beginning of the Poem, whilst
the Plague raged among the <HI>Grecians.</HI> This End is just, since the
Calmness of temper <HI>Achilles</HI> re enjoy'd, is only an Effect of the
Revenge which ought to have preceded: And after this no Body
expects any more of his Anger. Thus has <HI>Homer</HI> been very exact
in the Beginning, Middle and End of the Action he made
choice of for the Subject of his <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></NOTE> His Design in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> was to describe the Return of <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
from the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and his Arrival at <HI>Ithaca.</HI> He opens
this Poem with the complaints of <HI>Minerva</HI> against <HI>Neptune,</HI> who
opposed the Return of this Heroe, and against <HI>Calypso</HI> who de∣tain'd
him in an Island from <HI>Ithaca.</HI> Is this a Beginning? No;
doubtless, the Reader would know why <HI>Neptune</HI> is displeas'd with
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> and how this Prince came to be with <HI>Calypso</HI>? He would know
how he came from <HI>Troy</HI> thither? The Poet answers his Demands
out of the Mouth of <HI>Ulysses</HI> himself, who relates these things,
and begins the Action, by the Recital of his Travels from the
City of <HI>Troy.</HI> It signifies little whether the Beginning of the Ac∣tion
be the Beginning of the Poem. The Beginning of this
Action is that which happens to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> when upon his leaving
<HI>Troy</HI> he bends his Course for <HI>Ithaca.</HI> The Middle comprehends
all the Misfortunes he endured, and all the Disorders of his own
Government. The End is the re-instating of this Hero in the
peaceable possession of his Kingdom, where he was acknowledg'd
by his Son, his Wife, his Father, and several others. The Poet
was sensible he should have ended ill had he gone no farther than
the death of these Princes, who were the Rivals and Enemies of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> because the Reader might have look'd for some Revenge
<PB N="xv" REF="25"/>
which the Subjects of these Princes might have taken, on him
who had kill'd their Sovereigns: But this Danger over, and the
People vanquished and quieted, there was nothing more to be
expected. The Poem and the Action have all their Parts, and
no more.</P>
<P>But the Order of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> differs from that of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> in
that the <HI>Poem</HI> does not begin with the Beginning of the <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Causes and Beginning of the Action.</NOTE> The <HI>Causes of the Action</HI> are also what the Poet is oblig'd to
give an Account of. There are three sorts of Causes, the Hu∣mours,
the Interests, and the Designs of Men; and these different
Causes of an Action are likewise often the Causes of one ano∣ther,
every Man taking up those Interests in which his Humour
ingages him, and forming those Designs to which his Humour
and Interest incline him. Of all these the Poet ought to inform
his Readers, and render them conspicuous in his principal Perso∣nages.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> has ingeniously begun his <HI>Odyssey</HI> with the Transactions
at <HI>Ithaca,</HI> during the absence of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> If he had begun with
the Travels of his Heroe, he would scarce have spoken of any one
else, and a Man might have read a great deal of the Poem, without
conceiving the least Idea of <HI>Telemachus, Penelope,</HI> or her Suitors,
who had so great a share in the Action; but in the beginning
he has pitch'd upon, besides these Personages, whom he disco∣vers,
he represents <HI>Ulysses</HI> in his full Length, and from the very
first opening one sees the Interest which the Gods take in the
Action.</P>
<P>The Skill and Care of the same Poet may be seen likewise in in∣ducing
his Personages in the first Book of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> where he
discovers the Humours, the Interests, and the Designs of <HI>Agamem∣non,</HI>
<HI>Achilles, Hector, Ulysses,</HI> and several others, and even of the
Deities. And in his Second he makes a Review of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
and <HI>Trojan</HI> Armies; which is full Evidence, that all we have here
said is very necessary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Middle or Intrigue of the Action.</NOTE> As these <HI>Causes</HI> are the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Action, the opposite
Designs against that of the Hero are the <HI>Middle</HI> of it, and form
that Difficulty or <HI>Intrigue,</HI> which makes up the greatest part of
<PB N="xvi" REF="26"/>
the Poem; the Solution or <HI>Unravelling</HI> commences when the
Reader begins to see that difficulty remov'd, and the doubts
clear'd up. <HI>Homer</HI> has divided each of his Poems into two Parts,
and has put a particular Intrigue, and the Solution of it, into
each Part.</P>
<P>The first Part of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who is for
revenging himself upon <HI>Agamemnon</HI> by the means of <HI>Hector</HI> and
the <HI>Trojans.</HI> The <HI>Intrigue</HI> comprehends the three days Fight,
which happen'd in the Absence of <HI>Achilles</HI>: and it consists on
one side in the resistance of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and the <HI>Grecians</HI>; and on
the other in the revengeful and inexorable Humour of <HI>Achilles,</HI>
which would not suffer him to be reconcil'd. The Loss of the
<HI>Grecians</HI> and the Despair of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> prepare for a solution by
the satisfaction which the incens'd Heroe receiv'd from it. The
death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> join'd to the Offers of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> which of it
self had prov'd ineffectual, remove this Difficulty, and make the
untravelling of the first part.</P>
<P>This death is likewise the Beginning of the second Part; since
it puts <HI>Achilles</HI> upon the design of revenging himself on <HI>Hector.</HI>
But the design of <HI>Hector</HI> is opposite to that of <HI>Achilles</HI>; This
<HI>Trojan</HI> is valiant, and resolv'd to stand on his own defence. This
Valour and Resolution of <HI>Hector,</HI> are on his part the cause of the
Intrigue. All the Endeavours <HI>Achilles</HI> us'd, to meet with <HI>Hector</HI>
and be the death of him; and the contrary Endeavours of the
<HI>Trojan</HI> to keep out of his Reach, and defend himself; are the in∣trigue;
which comprehends the battle of the last day. The un∣ravelling
begins at the death of <HI>Hector</HI>; and besides that, it
contains the insulting of <HI>Achilles</HI> over his Body, the Honours
he paid to <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and the Intreaties of King <HI>Priam.</HI> The re∣grets
of this King and the other <HI>Trojans,</HI> in the sorrowful Obse∣quies
they paid to <HI>Hector</HI>'s body, end the unravelling; they ju∣stifie
the satisfaction of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and demonstrate his Tranquil∣lity.</P>
<P>The first part of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is the return of <HI>Ulysses</HI> into <HI>Itha∣ca.
Neptune</HI> opposes it by raising tempests, and this makes the
Intrigue. The unravelling is the arrival of <HI>Ulysses</HI> upon his own
<PB N="xvii" REF="27"/>
Island, where <HI>Neptune</HI> could offer him no farther injury. The
second Part is the re-instating this Heroe in his own Govern∣ment.
The Princes that are his Rivals, oppose him, and this is
a fresh Intrigue: The Solution of it begins at their deaths,
and is compleated as soon as the <HI>Ithacans</HI> were appeas'd.</P>
<P>These two Parts in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> have not one common In∣trigue.
The Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> forms both the Intrigues in the
<HI>Iliad</HI>; and it is so far the Matter of this <HI>Epopéa,</HI> that the very
Beginning and End of this Poem depend on the Beginning and
End of this Anger. But let the Desire <HI>Achilles</HI> had to revenge
himself, and the Desire <HI>Ulysses</HI> had to return to his own Coun∣try,
be never so near ally'd, yet we cannot place them under
one and the same Notion: For that Desire of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is not a
Passion that Begins and Ends in the Poem with the Action; 'tis
a natural Habit; nor does the Poet propose it for his Subject as
he does the Anger of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>We have already observ'd what is meant by the <HI>Intrigue,</HI> and
the <HI>Unravelling</HI> thereof; let us now say something of the Man∣ner
of forming both. These two should arise naturally out of the
very Essence and Subject of the Poem, and are to be deduced
from thence. Their Conduct is so exact and natural, that it seems
as if their Action had presented them with whatever they in∣serted,
without putting themselves to the Trouble of a farther In∣quiry.</P>
<P>What is more usual and natural to Warriors, than Anger,
Heat, Passion, and Impatience of bearing the least Affront or
Disrespect? This is what forms the Intrigue of the <HI>Iliad</HI>; and
every thing we read there is nothing else but the Effect of this
Humour and these Passions.</P>
<P>What more natural and usual Obstacle to those who take
Voyages, than the Sea, the Winds, and the Storms? <HI>Homer</HI>
makes this the Intrigue of the first Part of the <HI>Odyssey</HI>: And
for the second, he makes use of almost the infallible effect of the
long Absence of a Master, whose return is quite despair'd of, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Insolence of his Servants and Neighbours, the Danger of his
Son and Wife, and the Sequestration of his Estate. Besides an Ab∣sence
of almost twenty Years, and the insupportable Fatigues
<PB N="xviii" REF="28"/>
joyn'd to the Age of which <HI>Ulysses</HI> then was, might induce him
to believe that he should not be own'd by those who thought him
dead, and whose Interest it was to have him really so. There∣fore
if he had presently declar'd who he was, and had call'd him∣self
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> they would easily have destroy'd him as an Impostor,
before he had an Opportunity to make himself known.</P>
<P>There could be nothing more natural nor more necessary
than this ingenious Disguise, to which the advantages his Ene∣mies
had taken of his Absence had reduc'd him, and to which
his long Misfortunes had enur'd him. This allow'd him an op∣portunity,
without hazarding any thing, of taking the best mea∣sures
he could, against those persons who could not so much as
mistrust any harm from him. This way was afforded him by
the very Nature of his Action, to execute his Designs, and over∣come
the Obstacles it cast before him. And 'tis this con∣test
between the Prudence and the Dissimulation of a single Man
on one hand, and the ungovernable Insolence of so many Ri∣vals
on the other, which constitutes the Intrigue of the second
Part of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the End or Unravelling of the Action.</NOTE> If the <HI>Plot</HI> or <HI>Intrigue</HI> must be natural, and such as springs from
the very Subject, as has been already urg'd: Then the <HI>Winding up</HI>
of the Plot, by a more sure claim, must have this Qualification,
and be a probable consequence of all that went before. As this
is what the Readers regard more than the rest, so should the Poet
be more exact in it. This is the End of the Poem, and the last
Impression that is to be stamp'd upon them.</P>
<P>We shall find this in the <HI>Odyssey. Ulysses</HI> by a Tempest is cast
upon the Island of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> to whom he discovers him∣self,
and desires they would favor his Return to his own Coun∣try
which was not very far distant. One cannot see any reason
why the King of this Island should refuse such a reasonable Re∣quest,
to a Heroe whom he seem'd to have in great esteem. The
<HI>Phaeacians</HI> indeed had heard him tell the Story of his Adventures;
and in this fabulous recital consisted all the advantage they could
derive from his Presence; for the Art of War which they
admir'd in him, his Undauntedness under Dangers, his indefati∣gable
Patience, and other Virtues, were such as these Islanders
<PB N="xix" REF="29"/>
were not used to. All their Talent lay in singing and dan∣cing,
and whatsoever was charming in a quiet life. And here
we see how dextrously <HI>Homer</HI> prepares the Incidents he makes use
of. These People could do no less, for the Account with which
<HI>Ulysses</HI> had so much entertain'd them, than afford him a Ship
and a safe Convoy, which was of little expence or trouble to them.</P>
<P>When he arriv'd, his long Absence, and the Travels which had
disfigur'd him, made him altogether unknown; and the Danger
he would have incurr'd had he discover'd himself too soon,
forced him to a Disguise: Lastly, this Disguise gave him an Op∣portunity
of surprizing those young Suitors, who for several years
together had been accustomed to nothing but to sleep well, and
fare daintily.</P>
<P>It was from these Examples that <HI>Aristotle</HI> drew this Rule,
<Q REND="inline">"that Whatever concludes the Poem should so spring from the
very constitution of the Fable, as if it were a <HI>necessary,</HI> or
at least a <HI>probable</HI> consequence."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT VI.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Time of the Action.</NOTE> THE <HI>Time</HI> of the Epic Action is not fix'd, like that of the
Dramatic Poem: It is much longer, for an uninterrupted Dura∣tion
is much more necessary in an Action which one sees and is
present at, than in one which we only read or hear repeated.
Besides, Tragedy is fuller of Passion, and consequently of such a
Violence as cannot admit of so long a Duration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iliad</HI> containing an Action of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Violence,</HI> the
Poet allows it but a short time, about <HI>forty days.</HI> The De∣sign
of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> required another Conduct; the Character of
the Hero is <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Long-suffering</HI>; therefore the Time
of its Duration is much longer, above <HI>eight Years.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Passions of the Epic Poem.</NOTE> The <HI>Passions</HI> of Tragedy are different from those of the Epic
Poem. In the former, <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> have the chief place; the
Passion that seems most peculiar to Epic Poetry, is <HI>Admiration.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this <HI>Admiration,</HI> which in general distinguishes the E∣pic
Poem from the Dramatic; each Epic Poem has likewise some
<HI>peculiar Passion,</HI> which distinguishes it in particular from other Epic
Poems, and constitutes a kind of singular and individual diffe∣rence
<PB N="xx" REF="30"/>
between these Poems of the same Species. These singular
Passions correspond to the <HI>Character</HI> of the <HI>Hero. Anger</HI> and <HI>Ter∣ror</HI>
reign throughout the <HI>Iliad,</HI> because <HI>Achilles</HI> is angry, and the
most Terrible of all Men. The <HI>Aeneid</HI> has all <HI>soft</HI> and <HI>tender
Passions,</HI> because that is the Character of <HI>Aeneas.</HI> The Prudence,
Wisdom, and Constancy of <HI>Ulysses</HI> do not allow him either of
these Extremes, therefore the Poet does not permit one of them
to be predominant in the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> He confines himself to <HI>Ad∣miration</HI>
only, which he carries to an higher pitch than in the
<HI>Iliad</HI>: And 'tis upon this account that he introduces a great ma∣ny
more Machines in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> into the Body of the Action,
than are to be seen in the Actions of the other two Poems.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Manners.</NOTE> The <HI>Manners</HI> of the Epic Poem ought to be <HI>poetically good,</HI>
but it is not necessary they be always <HI>morally</HI> so. They are poe∣tically
good, when one may discover the Virtue or Vice, the
good or ill Inclinations, of every one who speaks or acts: They
are poetically bad, when Persons are made to speak or act out of
Character, or inconsistently, or unequally. The Manners of <HI>Ae∣neas</HI>
and of <HI>Mezentius</HI> are equally good, consider'd poetically,
because they equally demonstrate the Piety of the one, and the
Impiety of the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Heroe.</NOTE> 'Tis requisite to make the same distinction between a Heroe
in Morality and a Heroe in Poetry, as between moral and poe∣tical
Goodness. <HI>Achilles</HI> had as much right to the latter as
<HI>Aeneas. Aristotle</HI> says, that the Heroe of a Poem should be nei∣ther
good nor bad; neither advanc'd above the rest of mankind
by his Virtues, or sunk beneath 'em by his Vices; that he may
be the properer and fuller Example to others, both what to imi∣tate
and what to decline.</P>
<P>The other Qualifications of the <HI>Manners,</HI> are, that they be
<HI>suitable</HI> to the Causes which either raise or discover them in the
Persons; that they have an exact <HI>Resemblance</HI> to what History or
Fable have delivered of those persons to whom they are ascrib'd;
and that there be an <HI>Equality</HI> in them, so that no man is made
to act or speak out of his character.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unity of the Character.</NOTE> But this Equality is not sufficient for the <HI>Unity of the Character</HI>:
'tis further necessary that the same Spirit appear in all sort of
<PB N="xxi" REF="31"/>
Encounters. Thus <HI>Aeneas</HI> acting with great <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Mildness</HI>
in the first part of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which requires no other Cha∣racter;
and afterwards appearing illustrious in Heroic valour
in the wars of the second part, but there without any ap∣pearance
either of a hard or a soft disposition, would doubtless
be far from offending against the <HI>Equality</HI> of the Manners:
But yet there would be no <HI>Simplicity</HI> or <HI>Unity</HI> in the Character.
So that besides the Qualities that claim their particular place up∣on
different occasions, there must be One appearing throughout,
which commands over all the rest: And without this we may af∣firm
'tis no Character.</P>
<P>One may indeed make a Heroe as valiant as <HI>Achilles,</HI> as
pious as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and as prudent as <HI>Ulysses.</HI> But 'tis a meer
Chimaera to imagine a Heroe that has the Valour of <HI>Achil∣les,</HI>
the Piety of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and the Prudence of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> at one and
the same time. This Vision might happen to an Author, who
would suit the character of a Heroe to whatever each part of
the Action might naturally require, without regarding the Essence
of the Fable, or the Unity of the Character in the same person
upon all sorts of occasions: This Heroe would be the mildest,
best-natur'd Prince in the world, and also the most cholerick, hard-hearted,
and implacable creature imaginable; he would be ex∣treamly
tender like <HI>Aeneas,</HI> extreamly violent like <HI>Achilles,</HI> and
yet have the indifference of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that is incapable of the
two extremes. Would it not be in vain for the Poet to call this
Person by the same name throughout?</P>
<P>Let us reflect on the effects it would produce in several Poems,
whose Authors were of opinion, that the chief character of a
Heroe is that of an accomplish'd Man. They would be all a∣like,
all valiant in Battle, prudent in Council, pious in the acts
of Religion, courteous, civil, magnificent; and lastly endued
with all the prodigious Virtues any Poet could invent. All this
would be independent from the Action and the Subject of the
Poem; and upon seeing each Heroe separated from the rest of the
work, we should not easily guess, to what Action and to what
Poem the Heroe belong'd? So that we should see that none of those
would have a Character, since the Character is that which makes
<PB N="xxii" REF="32"/>
a person discernable, and which distinguishes him from all others.</P>
<P>This commanding Quality in <HI>Achilles</HI> is his Anger, in <HI>Ulysses</HI>
the art of Dissimulation, in <HI>Aeneas</HI> Meekness. Each of these may
be stil'd, by way of eminence, the Character in these Heroes.</P>
<P>But these Characters cannot be alone. 'Tis absolutely neces∣sary
that some other should give them a lustre, and embellish
them as far as they are capable: Either by hiding the defects that
are in each, by some noble and shining Qualities; as the Poet has
done the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> by shading it with an extraordinary
Valour: Or by making them entirely of the nature of a true
and solid Virtue, as is to be observ'd in the two others. The Dissi∣mulation
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is a part of his Prudence; and the Meekness
of <HI>Aeneas</HI> is wholly employ'd in submitting his Will to the Gods.
For the making up this Union, our Poets have joyn'd together
such Qualities as are by nature the most compatible; <HI>Valour</HI> with
<HI>Anger, Meekness</HI> with <HI>Piety,</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> with <HI>Dissimulation.</HI> This
last Union was necessary for the Goodness of <HI>Ulysses</HI>; for without
that, his Dissimulation might have degenerated into Wickedness
and Double-dealing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Machi∣nery.</NOTE> WE come now to the <HI>Machines</HI> of the Epic Poem. The chief
Passion which it aims to excite being <HI>Admiration,</HI> nothing is so
conducive to that as the <HI>Marvellous</HI>; and the importance and dig∣nity
of the Action is by nothing so greatly elevated as by the
<HI>Care and Interposition of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>These Machines are of three sorts. Some are <HI>Theological,</HI> and
were invented to explain the nature of God. Others are <HI>Physical,</HI>
and represent things of Nature. The last are <HI>Moral,</HI> and are the
Images of Virtues and Vices.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> and the Ancients have given to their Deities the Man∣ners,
Passions and Vices of Men. Their Poems are wholly Alle∣gorical;
and in this view it is easier to defend <HI>Homer</HI> than to blame
him. We cannot accuse him for making mention of many Gods,
for his bestowing Passions upon them, or even introducing them
fighting against men. The Scripture uses the like figures and
expressions.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="33"/>
If it be allowable to speak thus of the Gods in <HI>Theology,</HI> much
more in the Fictions of <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI> where if a Poet de∣scribes
the Deities, he must give them such Manners, Speeches,
and Actions as are conformable to the nature of the things they
represent under those Divinities. The case is the same in <HI>Moral</HI>
Deities: <HI>Minerva</HI> is wise, because she represents Prudence; <HI>Venus</HI>
is both good or bad, because the Passion of Love is capable of
these contrary qualities.</P>
<P>Since among the Gods of a Poem some are good, some bad,
and some indifferently either; and since of our Passions we make
so many allegorical Deities; one may attribute to the <HI>Gods</HI> all that
is done in the Poem, whether good or evil. But these Deities do
not act constantly in one and the same manner.</P>
<P>Sometimes they act invisibly, and by meer Inspiration; which
has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous: being no more
than what we say every day, <Q REND="inline">"That some God has assisted us,
or some Daemon has instigated us."</Q></P>
<P>At other times they appear visibly, and manifest themselves to
men, in a manner altogether miraculous and praeternatural.</P>
<P>The third way has something of both the others: It is in truth
a miracle, but is not commonly so accounted: This includes
Dreams, Oracles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All these ways must be <HI>Probable</HI>; for so necessary as the Mar∣vellous
is to the Epic Action, as nothing is so conducive to Ad∣miration;
yet we can on the other hand admire nothing that we
think impossible. Tho' the Probability of these Machines be of
a very large extent, (since 'tis founded upon Divine Power) it
is not without limitations. There are numerous Instances of al∣lowable
and probable Machines in the Epic Poems, where the
Gods are no less Actors than the Men. But the less credible sort,
such as <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> &amp;c. are far more rare.</P>
<P>This suggests a Reflection on the Method of rendring those
Machines probable, which in their own nature are hardly so.
Those which require only <HI>Divine Probability,</HI> should be so disengag'd
from the Action, that one might substract them from it with∣out
destroying the Action. But those which are essential and
necessary, should be grounded upon <HI>Human Probability,</HI> and not
<PB N="xxiv" REF="34"/>
on the sole Power of God. Thus the Episodes of <HI>Circe,</HI> the <HI>Sy∣rens,</HI>
<HI>Polyphemus,</HI> &amp;c. are necessary to the Action of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
and yet not humanly probable: Yet <HI>Homer</HI> has artificially re∣duc'd
them to human Probability, by the Simplicity and Igno∣rance
of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> before whom he causes those recitals to
be made.</P>
<P>The next Question is, Where, and on what occasions Ma∣chines
may be used? It is certain <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> make use of
them every where, and scarce suffer any Action to be perform'd
without them. <HI>Petronius</HI> makes this a Precept: <HI>Per ambages, de∣orumque
ministeria</HI> &amp;c. The Gods are mention'd in the very <HI>Pro∣position</HI>
of their Works, the <HI>Invocation</HI> is addrest to them, and
the whole <HI>Narration</HI> is full of them. The Gods are the <HI>Causes</HI>
of the Action, they form the <HI>Intrigue,</HI> and bring about the <HI>So∣lution.</HI>
The precept of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> that the unravelling
of the Plot should not proceed from a Miracle or the appear∣ance
of a God, has place only in Dramatic Poetry, not in the
Epic. For it is plain that both in the Solution of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Odyssey</HI> the Gods are concern'd: In the former, the Deities meet
to appease the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI>: <HI>Iris</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> are sent to
that purpose, and <HI>Minerva</HI> eminently assists <HI>Achilles</HI> in the deci∣sive
combate with <HI>Hector.</HI> In the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> the same Goddess fights
close by <HI>Ulysses</HI> against the Suitors, and concludes that Peace be∣twixt
him and the <HI>Ithacensians,</HI> which compleats the Poem.</P>
<P>We may therefore determine, that a Machine is not an In∣vention
to extricate the Poet out of any difficulty which embarras∣ses
him: But that the Presence of a Divinity, and some Action sur∣prizing
and extraordinary, are inserted into almost all the parts of his
work, in order to render it more Majestic and more Admirable.
But this mixture ought to be so made, that the Machines might be
retrench'd without taking any thing from the Action. At the
same time it gives the Readers a lesson of Piety and Virtue; and
teaches them, that the most brave and the most wise can do no∣thing,
and attain nothing great and glorious, without the assistance
of Heaven. Thus the Machinery crowns the whole work, and
renders it at once, <HI>Marvellous, Probable,</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>

ON THE
FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E shall proceed in the same method thro' the
course of these Annotations upon the <HI>O∣dyssey,</HI>
as in those upon the <HI>Iliad</HI>; considering
<HI>Homer</HI> chiefly as a Poet, endeavouring to
make his beauties <HI>understood,</HI> and not to
praise without a reason given. It is equally
an extreme, on the one hand to think <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
has no human defects; and on the other
to dwell so much upon those defects, as to depreciate his beauties.
The greater part of Criticks form a general character, from the
observation of particular errors, taken in their own oblique or im∣perfect
views; which is as unjust, as to make a judgment of the
beauty of a man's body from the shadow it happens to cast, in
such or such a position. To convince the Reader of this intend∣ed
impartiality, we readily allow the <HI>Odyssey</HI> to be inferior to the
<HI>Iliad</HI> in many respects. It has not that sublimity of spirit, or
that enthusiasm of poetry; but then it must be allow'd, if it be
less noble, it is more instructive: The other abounds with
more Heroism, this with more Morality. The <HI>Iliad</HI> gives us a
draught of Gods and Heroes, of discord, of contentions, and
<PB N="36" REF="68"/>
scenes of slaughter; the <HI>Odyssey</HI> sets before us a scene more amia∣ble,
the landschapes of nature, the pleasures of private life, the du∣ties
of every station, the hospitality of ancient times; a less busy,
but more agreeable portrait. The <HI>Iliad</HI> concludes with the ruin,
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> with the happiness of a nation. <HI>Horace</HI> was of the
same opinion, as is evident from the epistle to <HI>Lollius.</HI><Q><L><HI>Seditione, dolis, scelere, libidine, &amp; ira,</HI></L>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 1. <L><HI>The Man, for Wisdom,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> <HI>Homer</HI> opens his Poem
with the utmost simplicity and modesty; he continually grows
upon the reader,
<Q><L><HI>Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat.</HI></L></Q>
<HI>Cicero</HI> lays this down as a rule for the Orator, <HI>principia vere∣cunda,
non elatis intensa verbis</HI>; and <HI>Horace</HI> for the Poet, <HI>Nec sic
incipies, &amp;c.</HI> He proposes the beginning of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> as a pattern
for all future poems, and has translated them in his Art of poetry.
<Q><L><HI>Dic mihi, Musa, virum, captae post tempora Trojae,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes.</HI></L></Q>
May I be forgiven the arrogance, if I should offer a criticism
upon this translation? The <HI>sufferings</HI> of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are the subject of
the whole <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and yet <HI>Horace</HI> has omitted the mention of
those sufferings: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. There is another
word also which seems essential, that is, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, this is
likewise omitted. For the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and the wisdom
by which he extricated himself from them, enter into the very
<PB N="37" REF="69"/>
design of the Poem. But indeed in another place he has plainly
had regard to all these circumstances,
<Q><L><HI>Qui</HI> domitor Trojae, <HI>multorum</HI> providus <HI>urbes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dum</HI> sibi<HI>, dum</HI> sociis<HI>, reditum parat,</HI> aspera multa</L>
<L>Pertulit—</L><BIBL><HI>Epist. ad Loll.</HI></BIBL></Q>
I must also refute a criticism of <HI>Rapin,</HI> who will have it that the
word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> includes a character of craft and low cun∣ning,
unworthy of a brave spirit: But <HI>Eustathius</HI> admirably vin∣dicates
the Poet in this respect, he shews us that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> no
where in <HI>Homer</HI> signifies (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) or Morals; and that it implies
a man who could accommodate himself to every condition of
life; one who in the worst estate had still a reserve to free him∣self
from it; it therefore, says he, signifies a man that thro' expe∣rience
has learn'd wisdom. I have likewise the authority of <HI>Ho∣race</HI>
for this sense, in the above-cited passage,
<Q><HI>Qui domitor Trojae multorum</HI> providus <HI>urbes.</HI></Q>
I take <HI>providus</HI> in this place to signify not only a man who noted
the manners of various nations with care, but also one who
in calamity could foresee methods to extricate himself from it.
And surely nothing can be more unjust than what <HI>Rapin</HI> objects
against <HI>Ulysses,</HI> in employing his wisdom only in his own preser∣vation,
while all his companions were lost: <HI>Homer</HI> himself suffi∣ciently
refutes this objection, and directly tells us, that he em∣ployed
his wisdom in the care of their safety, but that they thro'
their folly defeated his wisdom. The words of <HI>Homer,</HI> says <HI>Eu∣stathius,</HI>
shew that a wise man neglects not his friends in adversi∣ty.
But, says <HI>Rapin,</HI> what could oblige <HI>Homer</HI> to begin with so
dishonourable an action, and place the greatest weakness of his
Heroe in the very frontispiece of his Poem? and invoke his Muse
to sing the man who with difficulty saved himself, and suffer'd his
companions to be destroy'd? There had been some weight in this
<PB N="38" REF="70"/>
objection, if <HI>Ulysses</HI> had saved his own, with the loss of their lives;
but I cannot see any dishonour, in his preserving himself by wis∣dom,
when they destroy'd themselves by folly: It was chiefly by
storms that they perish'd; it can be no imputation to his
character, not to be able to restrain the effects of a tempest:
he did all that a wise man cou'd do, he gave them such admoniti∣ons
upon every emergency, that if they had pursued them, they
had been preserved as well as <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE I. <L><HI>For Wisdom's various arts renown'd.</HI>]</L></Q> <HI>Bossu</HI>'s obser∣vation
in relation to this Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, given to <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
is worth transcribing. The Fable of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> (says he) is whol∣ly
for the conduct and policy of a State: Therefore the quality
it requires is <HI>Wisdom,</HI> but this virtue is of too large an extent
for the simplicity which a just and precise <HI>character</HI> requires; it
is therefore requisite it should be limited. The great art of Kings
is the mystery of <HI>Dissimulation.</HI> 'Tis well known, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the
eleventh, for the instruction of his Son, reduc'd all the <HI>Latin lan∣guage</HI>
to these words only, <HI>viz. Qui nescit dissimulare nescit reg∣nare.</HI>
'Twas likewise by this practice that <HI>Saul</HI> began his reign,
when he was first elected and as yet full of the spirit of God.
The first thing we read of him in holy Writ is, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ille vero dissimulabat se audire.</HI> Reg. lib. 1.</NOTE> that he made as
if he did not hear the words which seditious people spoke against
him.</P>
<P>This then is the <HI>character</HI> which the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet gives his <HI>Ulysses</HI>
in the Proposition of his Poem, he calls him <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
to denote this prudent dissimulation, which disguised him
so many ways, and put him upon taking so many shapes.</P>
<P>Without mentioning any thing of <HI>Circe,</HI> who detain'd him
with her a whole year, and who was famous for the transforma∣tions
she made of all sorts of persons; the reader finds him at
first with <HI>Calypso</HI> the daughter of wise <HI>Atlas,</HI> who bore up the
vast pillars that reach'd from Earth to Heaven, and whose know∣ledge
penetrated into the depths of the unfathomable Ocean: that
<PB N="39" REF="71"/>
is to say, who was ignorant of nothing in Heaven, Earth,
or Sea. And as the first product and principal part of so
high, so solid, and so profound a knowledge was to know
how to conceal ones self; this wise man call'd his daughter by a
name that signified a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE><HI>secret.</HI> The Poet makes his Heroe, whom
he designed for a Politician, to stay seven whole years with this
Nymph. She taught him so well, that afterwards he lost no op∣portunity
of putting her lessons in practice: for he does nothing
without a disguise. At his parting from <HI>Ogygia</HI> he is cast upon
the Isle of <HI>Phaeaca:</HI> as kind as his reception was, yet he stays 'till
the night before he went off ere he wou'd discover himself. From
thence he goes to <HI>Ithaca:</HI> the first adventure that happen'd to
him there was with <HI>Minerva,</HI> the most prudent among the Dei∣ties,
as <HI>Ulysses</HI> was the most prudent among men. She says so
expressly in that very passage. Nor did they fail to disguise them∣selves.
<HI>Minerva</HI> takes upon her the shape of a shepherd, and <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
tells her he was oblig'd to fly from <HI>Crete,</HI> because he had
murder'd the son of King <HI>Idomeneus.</HI> The Goddess discovers her
self first, and commends him particularly, because these artifices
were so easie and natural to him, that they seem'd to be born
with him. Afterwards the Heroe under the form of a beggar de∣ceives
first of all <HI>Eumeus,</HI> then his son, and last of all his wife,
and every body else, till he found an opportunity of punishing
his Enemies, to whom he discover'd not himself 'till he kill'd them,
namely on the last night. After his discovering himself in the
Palace, he goes the next day to deceive his father, appearing at
first under a borrow'd name; before he wou'd give him joy of
his return. Thus he takes upon him all manner of shapes, and
dissembles to the very last. But the Poet joins to this character
a valour and a constancy which render him invincible in the
most daring and desperate adventures</P>

Whence is it that <HI>Ulysses</HI> is said to have overthrown <HI>Troy?</HI> and
not <HI>Achilles,</HI> who was of more remarkable courage than <HI>Ulysses?
Eustathius</HI> tells us, that the destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> ought to be ascri∣bed
chiefly to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> as he not only took away the <HI>Palladium,</HI> but
was the inventor of the stratagem of the wooden horse, by which
that city was conquer'd. <HI>Virgil</HI> in his second book of the <HI>Aeneis</HI>
gives a noble description of its destruction, by which we find
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was not only the contriver of its ruin, but bore a

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 13. <L><HI>Oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate.</HI>]</L></Q>
It may be ask'd why the Poet invokes the Muse to recount only
Part of the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses?</HI> and why those words, <HI>To Us also,</HI>
are inserted? To the first it may be answer'd, that an heroic Po∣em
dwells chiefly upon incidents of importance, and passes over
every thing that does not contribute to raise our idea of the He∣roe,
or to the main design of the Poem: To the other <HI>Eustathi∣us</HI>
answers several ways; either, says he, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is to be taken as an expletive, as it is in a thousand places in <HI>Homer</HI>; or it means that
this is a subject so considerable, that it will be a theme to many
<PB N="41" REF="73"/>
Poets; or that being a true History it had spread over many
nations of the world, and that <HI>Homer</HI> himself received the
story of the Poem from <HI>Aegypt</HI>; and then the meaning will
be, <Q REND="inline">"Sing, oh Muse, to the <HI>Greeks</HI> as well as to other nations, the
sufferings of <HI>Ulysses.</HI>"</Q> I should prefer the first as being the
most natural: the rest seem forced, and consequently improper
for the opening of a Poem, where the utmost plainness is neces∣sary;
especially, if we consider that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was a <HI>Grecian,</HI> and it
is not probable that the <HI>Grecians</HI> should be the least acquainted
with the story, or the latest to celebrate the actions, of a <HI>Grecian.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 15. <L><HI>Now at their native realms the</HI> Greeks <HI>arriv'd.</HI>]</L></Q>
It is necessary for the better understanding of the Poem, to fix
the period of Time from which it takes its beginning: <HI>Homer,</HI>
as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, does not begin with the wandrings of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>
he steps at once into the latter end of his actions, and
leaves the preceding story to be told by way of narration. Thus
in his <HI>Iliad,</HI> he dates his Poem from the anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which
happen'd almost at the conclusion of the <HI>Trojan</HI> war. From hence
<HI>Horace</HI> drew his observation in his <HI>Arte Poet.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Semper ad eventum festinat; &amp; in medias res,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Non secus ac notas, auditorem rapit.</HI></L></Q>
There are but forty eight days from the departure of <HI>Ulysses</HI> from
<HI>Calypso,</HI> to his discovery in <HI>Ithaca</HI>; he had been one year with
<HI>Circe,</HI> and seven with <HI>Calypso,</HI> when the Gods dispatched <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
to that Goddess; from which point of Time we are to date
the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P>This observation gives a reason why the Poet invokes the Muse
to recount the wandrings of this Heroe in part only; for <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
as appears from the beginning of the ninth book, after he left
the shores of <HI>Troy,</HI> was driven to <HI>Ismarus</HI> of the <HI>Ciconians.</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="74"/>
An Historian must have begun from the fall of <HI>Troy,</HI> and related
his wandrings with truth and order; for History is chiefly for
instruction: But a Poet takes another method, and disposes every
circumstance arbitrarily; he chuses or rejects, as suits best with his
principal design, and in such a manner as to give at once de∣light
and instruction.</P>

<HI>Calypso,</HI> may be added this of the Abbè <HI>Fraguier</HI>: that his resi∣ding
seven years in the caves of <HI>Calypso,</HI> (the Goddess of Secrecy)

<HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and taken his life away; especially in that very instant

says, that <HI>Homer,</HI> an enemy to censure and invective, introduces
that God as having respect only to his good qualities, and com∣mending
him for his general character; and adds that it had been
an indecency in the Poet to have given countenance to that base
custom by the authority of <HI>Jupiter. Dacier</HI> is not satisfy'd with
this reason, and tells us, that <HI>Homer</HI> gives <HI>Aegysthus</HI> this title, to
vindicate <HI>Jupiter</HI> from the imputation of his crimes: He gives
us to understand that Heaven is not the cause of man's failings;
that he is by Creation able to act virtuously, and that it is thro'
his own misconduct that he deviates into evil; and therefore the
<PB N="44" REF="76"/>
meaning is this; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Jupiter</HI> calling to mind <HI>Aegysthus,</HI> that <HI>Aegysthus</HI>
whom he had created wise and virtuous, and made capable to su∣stain
that character."</Q> And this agrees admirably with the begin∣ning
of the speech of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who there vindicates his own
Divinity.</P>
<P>But if this shou'd seem too refin'd, it may be sufficient to take
the word in that good sense which <HI>Aegysthus</HI> might have deserved
for many good qualities: Thus <HI>Achilles</HI> is call'd the <HI>swift of foot,</HI>
even while he stands, or sleeps; the first being his general character.
It may be further confirm'd by a passage something resembling it
in the holy Scriptures: The <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Midwives were guilty of a
lye to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and yet God pardons it, and blesses them: He
blesses them not because they lyed, but because they preserv'd the

It may be ask'd what is this <HI>Mercury</HI> whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> sends?
It is the light of Nature, which Heaven implants in the breast of
every man: and which, as <HI>Cicero</HI> says, is not only more ancient than
the world, but co-eval with the Master of the world himself. He
writes to this effect. <HI>There was from the beginning such a thing as
Reason, a direct emanation from Nature it self, which prompted to
good, and averted from evil. A Reason which did not then become
a law, when it was first reduced to writing, but was so even from
the moment it existed, and it existed from ever, of an equal date with the
divine Intelligence: It is the true and primordial Law, proper to com∣mand
and to forbid, it is the Reason of the great</HI> Jupiter.</P>
<P>That Reason of the supreme Being, is here call'd <HI>Mercury</HI>; that
Reason flowing from God, which is constantly dictating to the
most corrupted hearts, <HI>this is good,</HI> or, <HI>this is evil.</HI> Hence arose
an ancient Proverb, recorded by <HI>Simplicius, Reason is a</HI> Mercury

Laius <HI>would not obey his Oracle.</HI> Apollo <HI>nevertheless did not ne∣glect
to prophecy to</HI> Laius <HI>those evils that threaten'd him. The good∣ness

the Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> apply'd to him, has two different signi∣fications.
It implies either, <HI>one whose thoughts are full of terrible

of the ancient tradition which makes <HI>Atlas</HI> the same person with
<HI>Enoch,</HI> and represents him as a great Astronomer, who prophe∣cy'd
of the universal deluge, and exhorted mankind to repentance?
Therefore he nam'd his son <HI>Methuselah,</HI> to show that after his
death the waters shou'd overspread the face of the earth. His
continual lamentations on this occasion caus'd him to be call'd the
<HI>Weeper,</HI> for the world is always an enemy to melancholy pre∣dictions.
Thus <HI>Homer</HI> upon the credit of this Tradition might ve∣ry
well call <HI>Atlas, one whose thoughts ran upon dismal things,</HI> or
<HI>one whose views and cares were vastly extended.</HI></P>
<P>I insist no otherwise upon this but as a conjecture, yet it is fur∣ther
strengthen'd by what follows in the next lines: <HI>That</HI> Atlas
<PB N="47" REF="79"/>
<HI>sustains those Columns which being fixed upon the earth support the
Heavens.</HI> This is generally interpreted of his great skill in A∣stronomy
and Geography. But may not the reason be more par∣ticular?
Since <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Enoch</HI> had prophecy'd of the Deluge, and
since that prediction was looked upon as the effect of his skill in
Astronomy; might it not be said he knew the abysses of the Sea,
and sustain'd the pillars of Heaven, to express that he knew how
the fountains of the deep and the waters above the Heavens shou'd
unite to drown the earth?</P>

<HI>Rapin</HI> has rais'd several objections against this piece of conduct in
<HI>Homer</HI>: He tells us that the action of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is imperfect,
that it begins with the voyages of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and ends with those
<PB N="49" REF="81"/>
of <HI>Ulysses</HI>: That the four first books are all concerning <HI>Tele∣machus:</HI>
That his voyage bears no proportion to that of <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
that it contributes nothing to his return, which is brought about
by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the assistance of the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>; that this gave
occasion to <HI>Beni</HI> in his <HI>academical discourses</HI> to assert, that the
Fable of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is double, that the four first books of it are
neither Episode, nor part of an action, nor have any connexion
with the rest of the work.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that these objections are made with too
great severity; The destruction of the Suitors is the chief hinge
upon which the Poem turns, as it contributes chiefly to the re-establishment
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in his country and regality; and whatever
contributes to this end, contributes to the principal action, and
is of a piece with the rest of the Poem; and that this voyage
does so is evident, in that it gives a defeat to the Suitors, and
controuls their insolence; it preserves <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s throne and bed invi∣olate,
in that it gives <HI>Telemachus</HI> courage to resist their attempts:
It sets his character in a fair point of light, who is the second
personage of the Poem, and is to have a great share in the future
actions of it.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> judiciously observes, that <HI>Homer</HI> here prepares the
way for the defeat of the Suitors, the chief design of his Poem;
and lays the ground-work of probability on which he intends to
build his Poem, and reconcile it to the rules of credibility.</P>
<P>If it be ask'd for what end this voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> is made;
the answer is, to enquire after <HI>Ulysses</HI>: So that whatever Episodes
are interwoven, <HI>Ulysses</HI> is still in view; and whatever <HI>Telemachus</HI>
acts, is undertaken solely upon his account; and consequently,
whatever is acted, contributes to the principal design, the resto∣ration
of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> So that the Fable is entire, and the Action not
double.</P>
<P>'Tis to be remember'd also, that the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are
the subject of the Poem; his personal calamities are not only in∣tended,
but his domestic misfortunes; and by this conduct <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
shews us the extent of his misfortunes: His Queen is at∣tempted,

says he, is to search for his father in the Courts of <HI>Greece,</HI> he
cannot make the least progress without <HI>Minerva</HI>; 'tis she who in∣spires
his thoughts, and assists in the execution. Could not ho∣nour,
duty, or nature, have moved his heart toward an absent fa∣ther?
The Machine, adds he, has not the least appearance of
probability, inasmuch as the Goddess conducts him to every
place, except only where <HI>Ulysses</HI> resides; of which she ought by no
means to be ignorant, upon the account of her Divinity.</P>
<P>But surely nothing can be be more natural, than for a son, in
order to gain intelligence of an absent father, to enquire in those
places, and of those persons, where and from whom he is most
likely to have information. Such is the conduct of <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
And Poetry, which delights in the Wonderful, because this conduct
agrees with wisdom, ascribes it to <HI>Minerva</HI> the Goddess of it.
No doubt but <HI>Minerva</HI> knew where <HI>Ulysses</HI> resided: but men
must act as men: such an immediate interposition as <HI>Rapin</HI> re∣quires,
had stopp'd at once the fountain of the Poet's invention.

acts an unmanly part, he forgets that he is a King, and reduces
himself unworthily into the condition of a servant. <HI>Eustathius</HI> gives

the first is, that he could not endure to see the outrage and inso∣lence

him abandon society, and prefer his vineyard to his Court. This
is undoubtedly the picture of human nature under affliction; for
sorrow loves solitude. Thus it is, as <HI>Dacier</HI> well observes, that

It is necessary to reconcile the conduct of the Suitors to proba∣bility,

It is necessary to explain this passage. It seems at first view, as
if <HI>Ulysses</HI> had requested what a good man could not grant. <HI>Ilus,</HI>
says <HI>Mentes,</HI> deny'd the Poison, because he fear'd the anger of the
Gods; and the poison it self is call'd by <HI>Homer</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as
if it were design'd against mankind. <HI>Eustathius</HI> defends <HI>Ulysses</HI> va∣riously:
He intended, says he, to employ it against beasts only,
that infested his country, or in hunting. He assigns another
reason, and says that the Poet is preparing the way to give an
air of probability to the destruction of the Suitors. He poisons his
arrows, that every wound may be mortal; on this account the
poison may be call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; for it is certain in the wars of
<HI>Troy,</HI> poison'd arrows were not in use, for many persons who
were wounded recover'd; so that of necessity they must be re∣serv'd
for domestic occasions. From what has been said we may
collect the reason why <HI>Anchialus</HI> granted the poison to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and
<HI>Ilus</HI> deny'd it; <HI>Anchialus</HI> was the friend of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and knew

will lay before the reader literally what <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes upon
these words. There is a Soloecism, says he, in these verses or words,
that cannot be reduc'd to the rules of construction. It should be
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. How then comes the accusative case
to be used instead of the nominative? <HI>Mentes,</HI> adds he, may be
suppos'd to have intended to have said <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (send thy Mo∣ther
away;) but considering, in the midst of the Sentence, that
such advice was not suitable to be given to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> he checks
himself, and suppresses <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and no other word immedi∣ately
<PB N="60" REF="92"/>
occurring, that requir'd an accusative case, he falls into a
Soloecism.</P>
<P>But perhaps this is more ingenious than true; tho' <HI>Mentes</HI> was
in haste when he spoke it, <HI>Homer</HI> was not when he compos'd it.
Might not an errour creep into the original by the negligence
of a Transcriber, who might write <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>? This is
the more probable, because the one stands in the Verse in every
respect as well as the other.</P>
<P>What <HI>Eustathius</HI> adds is very absurd: he says that <HI>Telemachus</HI>
must observe both the interpretations, either send thy Mother a∣way,
or let thy Mother retire. So that the advice was double,
send thy Mother away if thou dost not love her; but if thou art
unwilling to grieve her, let her recess be voluntary.</P>

may be two reasons why this is inserted; either the Suitors were

they sate attentive to hear the death of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> in the process
of his story. This gives us a reason why immediately <HI>Penelope</HI>
descended to stop the song; she fear'd lest he might touch
upon the story of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and say that he dy'd in his return. This
would have reduc'd her to the utmost necessity, and she could
not have deferr'd to marry. <HI>Phemius</HI> would have certainly found
credit, for Poets were believ'd to be inspir'd by the Gods; they
were look'd upon as Prophets, and to have something of divinity
in them, as appears from <HI>Demodocus</HI> in the 8th book of the
<HI>Odyssey.</HI> Besides there was a further necessity to put a stop to the
song. If <HI>Phemius</HI> had declar'd him to be dead, <HI>Penelope</HI> could not
have avoided marriage; if alive, the Suitors might have desisted,
<PB N="62" REF="94"/>
or arm'd themselves against <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and then their Deaths, one
of the principal incidents of the Poem, could not have follow'd;
neither could <HI>Telemachus</HI> have gone in search of his father, if he
had foreknown his death, or sudden return. It is therefore art∣ful
in the Poet to cut the song short, he reserves the story of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> for future narration, and brings all this about by a very
probable method, by the interposition of <HI>Penelope,</HI> who requests
that some other story may be chosen, a story that she can hear

that the Gods hold a debate before the descent of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Council of <HI>Ithaca.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> in the assembly of the Lords of <HI>Ithaca,</HI> complains of
the injustice done him by the Suitors, and insists upon their depar∣ture
from his Palace; appealing to the Princes, and exciting the
people to declare against them. The Suitors endeavour to justify
their stay, at least till he shall send the Queen to the Court of
<HI>Icarius</HI> her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of
two Eagles in the sky, which an Augur expounds to the ruin of
the Suitors. <HI>Telemachus</HI> then demands a vessel, to carry him to
<HI>Pylos</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> there to enquire of his father's fortunes. <HI>Pal∣las</HI>
in the shape of <HI>Mentor</HI> (an ancient friend of <HI>Ulysses</HI>) helps
him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage,
and embarks with him that night; which concludes the <HI>second</HI>
day from the Opening of the Poem.</P>
<P>The SCENE continues in the Palace of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in <HI>Ithaca.</HI></P>

<L>Thus, shall I thus repay a mother's cares,</L>
<L N="150">Who gave me life, and nurs'd my infant years?</L>
<L>While sad on foreign shores <HI>Ulysses</HI> treads,</L>
<L>Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades.</L>

<L>Abhorr'd by all, accurs'd my name would grow,</L>
<L N="160">The earth's disgrace, and Humankind my foe.</L>
<L>If this displease, why urge ye here your stay?</L>
<L>Haste from the court, ye spoilers, haste away:</L>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS book opens with the first appearance
of <HI>Telemachus</HI> upon the stage of action. And
<HI>Bossu</HI> observes the great judgment of the
Poet, in beginning with the transactions of
<HI>Ithaca</HI> in the absence of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> By this
method he sets the conduct of <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
<HI>Penelope,</HI> and the Suitors, in a strong point
of light; they all have a large share in the
story of the Poem, and consequently ought to have distinguish∣ing
characters. It is as necessary in Epic Poetry, as it is on the
Theatre, to let us immediately into the character of every person
whom the Poet introduces: This adds perspicuity to the story,
and we immediately grow acquainted with each personage, and
interest our selves in the good or ill fortune that attends them
thro' the whole relation.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus</HI> is now about twenty years of age: In the eleventh
book, the Poet tells us, he was an infant in the arms of his mo∣ther
when <HI>Ulysses</HI> sail'd to <HI>Troy</HI>; that Heroe was absent near twenty
<PB N="98" REF="127"/>
years, and from hence we may gather the exact age of <HI>Telema∣chus.</HI>
He is every where describ'd as a person of piety to the Gods,
of duty to his parents, and as a lover of his country: he is pru∣dent,
temperate, and valiant: and the Poet well sets off the im∣portance
of this young Heroe, by giving him the Goddess of
War and Wisdom for his constant attendant.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 13.— <L><HI>In his hand a pond'rous javelin shin'd.</HI>]</L></Q> The
Poet describes <HI>Telemachus</HI> as if he were marching against an ene∣my,
or going to a council of war, rather than to an assembly
of Peers in his own country: Two reasons are assign'd for this
conduct; either this was the common usage of Princes in those
times, or <HI>Telemachus</HI> might look upon the Suitors as enemies,
and consequently go to council in arms as against enemies. <BIBL><HI>Eustathius.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 14. <L><HI>Two Dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind.</HI>]</L></Q> This
passage has not escap'd the raillery of the Critics; they look upon
it as a mean description of a Heroe and a Prince, to give him a
brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants: But such was
the simplicity of ancient Princes, that except in war they had
rarely any attendants or equipage. And we may be confident,
<HI>Homer</HI> copies after the custom of the time, unless we can be so
absurd as to suppose, he would feign low circumstances unnecessa∣rily,
thro' a want of judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> judg'd otherwise, and thought this circumstance worthy
of his imitation.<Q><L><HI>Quin etiam gemini custodes limine ab alto</HI></L>

<P>Poetry, observes <HI>Dacier,</HI> is like Painting, which draws the
greatest beauties from the simplest customs: and even in history,
we receive a sensible pleasure from the least circumstance that de∣notes
the customs of ancient times. It may be added, that
the Poet, as well as the Painter, is obliged to follow the customs
of the age of which he writes, or paints: a modern dress would
ill become <HI>Achilles</HI> or <HI>Ulysses,</HI> such a conduct would be condemned
as an absurdity in painting, and ought to be so in poetry.</P>

says <HI>Eustathius,</HI> inserts these particularities concerning the fa∣mily
of <HI>Aegyptius,</HI> to give an air of truth to his story. It does
not appear that <HI>Aegyptius</HI> knew the certainty of the death of
<HI>Antiphus</HI>; (for it is the Poet who relates it, and not the father;)
whence, as <HI>Dacier</HI> observes, should he learn it? he only laments him,
according to the prevailing opinion that all the companions of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> were lost with <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 33. <L><HI>Since great</HI> Ulysses<HI>, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> We are here told,
that there never had been any council conven'd in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> since
the departure of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> The general design and moral of the
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> is to inform us of the mischievous effects which the Ab∣sence
of a King and Father of a family produces: We deprive, as
<HI>Bossu</HI> observes, the Poem of its very soul, and spoil the Fable,
if we retrench from it the disorders which the Suitors create in
the absence of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> both in his family and dominions. No∣thing
can give us a greater image of those disorders, than what
<PB N="100" REF="129"/>
is here related: What must a kingdom suffer in twenty years,
without a Ruler, without a Council to make Laws or punish
enormities? Such is the condition of <HI>Ithaca: Laertes</HI> is superan∣nuated;
<HI>Penelope</HI> oppress'd by the violence of the Suitors; and
<HI>Telemachus</HI> to this time, in his minority.</P>
<P>It is very artful in the Poet to open the assembly by <HI>Aegyptius:
Telemachus</HI> was the person who conven'd it; and being the great∣est
personage present, it might be expected that he should open
the design of it: But to give <HI>Telemachus</HI> courage, who was young
and inexperienc'd, <HI>Aegyptius</HI> first rises, and by praising the person
who had summon'd them (of whom he seems ignorant) gives <HI>Te∣lemachus</HI>
to understand he has friends among the assembly: This
he could no other way so safely have done, considering the
power of the Suitors. By this means, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is encouraged
to speak boldly, and arraign the disorders of the Suitors with
the utmost freedom.</P>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 54. <L><HI>Your Father, and your King.</HI>]</L></Q> <HI>Telemachus</HI> here sets
the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> as a King, in the most agreeable point of
light: He rul'd his people with the same mildness as a father rules
his children. This must needs have a very happy effect upon
the audience; not only as it shews <HI>Ulysses</HI> to have been a good
Governour; but as it recalls the memory of the happiness they
receiv'd from that mild government, and obliquely condemns them
of ingratitude who had forgot it. By this method also the Poet
interests us deeply in the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses</HI>; we cannot see
a good man and good King in distress, without the most tender
emotions.</P>

<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 55. <L><HI>Yet more—our house,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> What <HI>Telemachus</HI>
here says has given offence to the Critics; they think it in∣decent
for a son to say, that he bears with more regret
<PB N="101" REF="130"/>
the disorder of his family than the loss of his father; yet this
objection will vanish if we weigh <HI>Penelope, Telemachus,</HI> and his
whole posterity, against the single person of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>But what chiefly takes away this objection is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> was
still in hopes of his father's return: for <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does not im∣ply
necessarily his death, but absence: and then both with justice
and decency, <HI>Telemachus</HI> may say that he grieves more for the
destruction of his family, than for the absence of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 63. <L><HI>Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice.</HI>]</L></Q> This
passage is ridicul'd by the Critics; they set it in a wrong light,
and then grow very pleasant upon it: <HI>Telemachus</HI> makes a sad
outcry because the Suitors eat his sheep, his beeves, and fatted
goats; and at last falls into tears. The truth is, the riches of
Kings and Princes, in those early ages, consisted chiefly in flocks
and cattle; thus <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> are describ'd as tending
their flocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> in the scriptures, as abounding
in this kind of wealth.</P>
<P>These Critics would form a different idea of the state and
condition of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> if they consider'd that he had been capa∣ble
to maintain no fewer than an hundred and eight persons in a
manner very expensive for many years; for so many (with their
attendants) were the Suitors, as appears from the 16th book;
and at the same time he kept up the dignity of his own court,
and liv'd with great hospitality.</P>
<P>But it is a sufficient answer to the objections against this
passage, to observe, that it is not the expence, but manner of
it, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> laments: This he expresly declares by the
word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and surely a sober man may complain against
luxury, without being arraigned of meanness; and against pro∣fusion,
without being condemned for parsimony.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 75.
<L>Themis<HI>, who gives to Councils, or denies</HI></L>
<L><HI>Success.</HI>]</L></Q>
<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, that there was a custom to carry the statue of <HI>Themis</HI>
to the assemblies in former ages, and carry it back again when those
assemblies were dissolv'd; and thus <HI>Themis</HI> may be said to form,
and dissolve an assembly. <HI>Dacier</HI> dislikes this assertion, as having
no foundation in antiquity; she thinks that the assertion of <HI>Tele∣machus</HI>
is general, that he intimates it is Justice alone that
establishes the councils of mankind, and that Injustice confounds
and brings the wicked designs of men to confusion.</P>
<P>I have follow'd this interpretation, not only as it suits best
with the usual morality of <HI>Homer,</HI> but also as <HI>Jupiter</HI> is mention'd
with <HI>Themis</HI>; and no such custom is pretended concerning his
statue. He is expresly stil'd by the ancients <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In
<HI>Sicily</HI> there was an Altar of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or of <HI>Jupiter who

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 84. <L><HI>Be You the spoilers, and our wealth consume.</HI>]</L></Q> To
understand this passage, we must remember, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks,
that <HI>Telemachus</HI> is pleading his cause before the <HI>Ithacensians</HI>; them
he constitutes the Judges of his cause: He therefore prevents an
answer which they might make, <HI>viz. We are not the men that are
guilty of these outrages</HI>; <HI>Telemachus</HI> rejoins, <Q REND="inline">"It were better for me

passage is not one of those, where the Poet can be blam'd for causing

a Heroe to weep. If we consider the youth of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> to∣gether
with the tenderness agreeable to that time of life; the sub∣jects
that demand his concern; the apprehension of the loss of
a father; and the desolate state of his mother and kingdom: All
these make his readiness to burst into tears an argument, not of
any want of spirit in him, but of true sense, and goodness of na∣ture:
and is a great propriety, which shews the right judgment

the treachery of the female servant of <HI>Penelope,</HI> prepares the
way for the punishment <HI>Ulysses</HI> inflicts on some of the maids in

It will be necessary to vindicate the character of <HI>Penelope</HI> the He∣roine
of the Poem, from the aspersions of <HI>Antinous.</HI> It must be
confest that she has a very hard game to play, she neither dares
consent, nor deny, if she consents, she injures <HI>Ulysses</HI> whom she
still expects to return: if she denies, she endangers the Throne,
and the life of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> from the violence of the Suitors; so
that no other method is left but to elude their addresses.</P>
<P>I must not conceal, what <HI>Eustathius</HI> has mention'd from some Au∣thors,

had a son, named <HI>Pan,</HI> by <HI>Hermes</HI>; but the Bishop declares it is
all a scandal; and every body must conclude the same, from her
conduct, as describ'd in <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>To vindicate her in this place, we must consider who it is that
speaks: <HI>Antinous,</HI> an unsuccessful Lover: and what he blames as
a crime, is really her glory; he blames her because she does not
comply with their desires; and it had been an act of guilt to
have comply'd. He himself sufficiently vindicates her in the con∣clusion
of his speech, where he extols her above all the race of
womankind: so that the seeming inconsistence of <HI>Penelope</HI> must
be imputed to the necessity of her affairs: she is artful, but not
criminal.</P>
<P>The original says, she deceiv'd the Suitors by her messages; a
plain intimation, that she us'd no extraordinary familiarities with
her Admirers; and thro' the whole course of the Poem she sel∣dom

It was an ancient custom to dedicate the finest pieces of Weaving

dismission of <HI>Penelope,</HI> says it would be an offence against Heaven

<P>The Critics have found fault with one part of the speech, as
betraying a spirit of avarice and meanness in <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>How to</HI> Icarius <HI>in the bridal hour</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dow'r?</HI></L></Q>
They think it unworthy of <HI>Telemachus</HI> to make the Dower of
<HI>Penelope</HI> an argument against her dismission, and consequently
ascribe his detention of her, not to duty, but to covetousness. To
take away this objection they point the verses in a different man∣ner,
and place a stop after <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and then the sense runs
thus; <Q REND="inline">"I cannot consent to dismiss her who bore me, and nurs'd

<P><PB N="106" REF="135"/>
<HI>Dacier</HI> dislikes this solution, and appeals to the customs of
those Ages, to justify her opinion: If a son forc'd away his mo∣ther
from his house, he was obliged to restore her dower, and all
she brought in marriage to her husband: But if she retir'd volun∣tarily
to engage in a second marriage, the dower remain'd with
the son as lawful heir. This opinion of <HI>Dacier</HI> may be con∣firm'd
from <HI>Demosthenes</HI> in his orations, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
<HI>Afterwards upon the decease of her husband, leaving his family, and
receiving back her portion,</HI> &amp;c. The same Author adds, that the
reason why the Suitors are so urgent to send away <HI>Penelope,</HI> is
that she may chuse to marry some one of them, rather than re∣turn
to <HI>Icarius</HI>; so that <HI>Telemachus</HI> only takes hold of their argu∣ment
for her dismission, in order to detain her. They address'd
<HI>Penelope</HI> more for the sake of her riches than her beauty, (for she
must be about forty years old) and he tells them, that if he sends
her away against her consent, he must restore those riches, which
they covet more than the person of <HI>Penelope.</HI> This I confess is
very refin'd; and perhaps it may be sufficient to take off the objection
of covetousness in <HI>Telemachus,</HI> to understand no more than what
the words at the first view seem to imply, <HI>viz.</HI> an abhorrence of
their riots, describ'd by <HI>Telemachus</HI> to have risen to such a degree
as to have almost ruin'd his kingdom, and made their demands
impossible. I see nothing unnatural or mean in this interpreta∣tion,
especially if we remember that the prodigious disorders of

The design of this speech is to deter the people of <HI>Ithaca</HI>

insolently: <HI>Mentor</HI> sets before them the worth of <HI>Ulysses</HI>;
<HI>Leocritus</HI> the power of the Suitors: <HI>Mentor</HI> speaks like a brave

true courage flies to the assistance of wine to raise a false one.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be objected, that there is not a sufficient distin∣ction
in the characters of the several Suitors; they are all describ'd
as insolent voluptuaries. But tho' they agree in this general cha∣racter,
yet there is something distinguishing in the particular per∣sons:
Thus <HI>Antinous</HI> derides, <HI>Eurymachus</HI> covers villany with
mildness; <HI>Antinous</HI> is ever the foremost in outrage, <HI>Eurymachus</HI>
generally his second: A greater distinction is neither necessary,
nor possible to be represented. What the Poet is to describe, is
the insolence of the Suitors, and the disorders they create in
his family and kingdom; he is oblig'd to dwell upon these cir∣cumstances,
because they are essential to his design: and conse∣quently
that general resemblance of their characters, is not a fault
in the Poet.</P>

they must be so in the mouths of these Suitors; persons of

absurdities, they act suitably to their characters. <HI>Milton,</HI> the best

It is a true observation, that the <HI>Iliad</HI> is chiefly suitable to the

circumstances in which the greatest part of mankind can have

It may be ask'd how <HI>Minerva</HI> can be said to occasion this drow∣ziness

<HI>Eustathius</HI> replies, that the person who furnish'd the wine supply'd
it in greater quantities than ordinary, thro' which wine they con∣tracted
a drowziness: In this sense <HI>Minerva,</HI> or Wisdom, may
be said to assist the designs of <HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>

This custom of libations was frequent upon all solemn occasions,
before meat, before sleep, voyages, journies; and in all religious

pure and unmix'd, whence <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is a word frequent in

but <HI>Eustathius</HI> says, that this mixture was of wine with wine, and
not of wine with water; hence came the distinction of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the unlawful and lawful libation; wine unmix'd

or <HI>Goblets crown'd with wine</HI>; that is, fill'd
'till the wine stood above the brim of the Goblet: they esteem'd
it an irreverence to the Gods not to fill the cups full, for then

<DIV3 TYPE="note">
<P>This Book takes up the space of one day and one night: it
opens with the morning; the speeches in the Council, with
the preparations for the voyage of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> are the subject of
the day; and the voyage is finish'd by the next morning. By
this last circumstance we may learn that <HI>Ithaca</HI> was distant from
<HI>Pylos</HI> but one night's voyage, nay something less, there being
some time spent after the setting of the Sun, in carrying the pro∣visions
from the Palace to the vessel.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="147"/>
The book consists chiefly in the speeches of <HI>Telemachus</HI> and
his friends, against those of the Suitors. It shews the great
judgment of the Poet in chusing this method: hence we see the
causes preceding the effects; and know from what spring every
action flow'd: we are never at a loss for a reason for every inci∣dent;
the speeches are as it were the ground-work upon which
he builds all that relates to the adventures of <HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Iliad,</HI> after the dissolution of the Council in the first book,
and the dissension between <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> we immediately
see upon what hinge the fable turns. So in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> after the
Poet has laid before us the warm debates between the Suitors
and <HI>Telemachus,</HI> we immediately expect them to act as enemies:
The war is declar'd, and we become judges as well as spectators
of the scenes of action. Thus <HI>Homer</HI> adds the perspicuity of
History to the ornaments of Poetry.</P>

<HEAD>The Interview of <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Nestor.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> guided by <HI>Pallas</HI> in the shape of <HI>Mentor,</HI> arrives in
the morning at <HI>Pylos</HI>; where <HI>Nestor</HI> and his sons are sacrificing
on the sea-shore to <HI>Neptune. Telemachus</HI> declares the occasion
of his coming, and <HI>Nestor</HI> relates what past in their return from
<HI>Troy,</HI> how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard
of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon,
the revenge of <HI>Orestes,</HI> and the injuries of the Suitors. <HI>Nestor</HI>
advises him to go to <HI>Sparta</HI> and enquire further of <HI>Menelaus.</HI>
The sacrifice ending with the night, <HI>Minerva</HI> vanishes from them
in the form of an Eagle: <HI>Telemachus</HI> is lodged in the Palace.
The next morning they sacrifice a Bullock to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and <HI>Tele∣machus</HI>
proceeds on his journey to <HI>Sparta,</HI> attended by <HI>Pisistratus.</HI></P>

Howe'er, my friend, indulge one labour more,</L>

<L>He, wand'ring long, a wider circle made,</L>
<L>And many-languag'd nations has survey'd;</L>

Now immolate the Tongues, and mix the wine,</L>

Thus from my walls the much-lov'd son to send</L>

<L>Me would ye leave, who boast imperial sway,</L>

<L>No—long as life this mortal shall inspire,</L>
<L>Or as my children imitate their sire,</L>
<L>Here shall the wand'ring stranger find his home,</L>

<L>For I alone sustain their naval cares,</L>

<L>All Youths the rest, whom to this journey move</L>
<L N="465">Like years, like tempers, and their Prince's love.</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="174"/>
There in the vessel shall I pass the night;</L>
<L>And soon as morning paints the fields of light,</L>

To <HI>Pallas</HI> high the foaming bowl he crown'd,</L>

<L N="510">Deep in a rich Alcove the Prince was laid,</L>

length. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore, to satisfie our curiosity, gives an
account of the fortunes of those great men, who made so
noble a figure at the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> This conduct also
shews his art: Variety gives life and delight; and it is
much more necessary in Epic than in Comic or Tragic Poetry
sometimes to shift the Scenes, to diversify and embellish the story.
But as on the stage the Poet ought not to step at once from one
part of the world to a too remote country, (for this destroys credi∣bility,
and the auditor cannot fancy himself this minute here, and
the next a thousand miles distant) so in Epic Poetry, every re∣moval
<PB N="158" REF="185"/>
must be within the degrees of probability. We have here
a very easy transition; the Poet carries his Heroe no further than
he really might sail in the compass of time he allots for his voyage.
If he had still dwelt upon the disorders of the Suitors without inter∣ruption,
he must grow tiresome; but he artfully breaks the thread
of their History with beautiful incidents and Episodes, and re∣serves
the further recital of their disorders for the end of his Po∣em:
By this method we sit down with fresh appetite to the en∣tertainment,
and rise at last not cloy'd, but satisfied.</P>

It may be added, that the very nature of Epic Poetry, and of

<HI>Aeneas</HI> is painted after the same manner by <HI>Virgil</HI>; the one kills
<HI>Hector,</HI> the other <HI>Turnus,</HI> both which are the decisive actions: It
was equally necessary to exalt the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> by bringing
him into difficulties from which he is personally to extricate him∣self:
This the Poet sufficiently brings about by refusing all the
easy methods for his re-establishment, because the more difficult
ways are most conducive to the honour of his Heroe: Thus as
<HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> kill <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Turnus</HI> with their own hands, so
the Suitors fall chiefly by the hand of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> It is necessary for
the Heroe of the Poem to execute the decisive action, for by this
method the Poet compleats his character, his own greatness sur∣mounts
all difficulties, and he goes off the stage with the utmost

It may be ask'd how an expression so near blasphemy, as <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
observes, could escape a person of such piety as <HI>Telemachus?</HI>
'Tis true, the Poet makes <HI>Minerva</HI> herself correct it; but yet the
objection remains, <HI>viz.</HI> how could <HI>Telemachus</HI> speak it? I think
since the Poet himself condemns it, we may give it up as an in∣decency
in <HI>Telemachus</HI>; it is natural for men in despair (and that
was the condition of <HI>Telemachus</HI>) to use a vehemence of expressi∣on,
and this might transport <HI>Telemachus</HI> beyond the bounds of
prudence. The only possible way that occurs to me to take off
the impiety is to have recourse to Destiny: It was the opinion
of the Antients, that the Gods could not alter Destiny: and then
<HI>Telemachus</HI> may mean no more, than that it was decreed by the
Destinies that <HI>Ulysses</HI> shall return no more, so the Gods themselves
could not restore him.</P>

<HEAD>XLIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 481. <L><HI>Distinguish'd care of guardian deities.</HI>]</L></Q> I will
take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made
against all interposition of the Gods in assisting the Heroes of the
<HI>Odyssey:</HI> It has been thought by some Critics a disparagement to
them to stand in continual need of such supernatural succour: If
two persons were engaged in combat, and a third person should
immediately step in to the assistance of one of the parties and
kill the adversary, would it not reflect upon the valour of his
friend who was so weak as to want such assistance? Why, for in∣stance,
should <HI>Jupiter</HI> help <HI>Aeneas</HI> to kill <HI>Turnus?</HI> Was not he brave
enough to fight, and strong enough to conquer his enemy by his
own prowess? and would not <HI>Turnus</HI> have kill'd <HI>Aeneas</HI> with the same
assistance? It is therefore a disparagement to the actors, thus con∣tinually
to supply the defects of a Heroe, by the power of a Deity.</P>
<P>But this is a false way of arguing, and from hence it might
be infer'd that the love and favour of a Deity serves only to make
those whom he assists, and those who depend upon such assistance,
appear weak, impotent, cowardly, and unworthy to be conque∣rors.
Can any doubt arise whether the love and favour of a God
be a disparagement or honour to those whom he favours? Ac∣cording
to these Critics, we should find the character of a per∣fect
Heroe in an impious <HI>Mezentius,</HI> who acknowledges no God
but his own arm and his own sword: 'Tis true, the objection
would be just if the Heroe himself perform'd nothing of the
action; or if when he were almost conquer'd by the superior va∣lour
of his enemy, he ow'd his life and victory to Gods
<PB N="179" REF="206"/>
and Miracles: But the Heroe always behaves himself in all his
actions, as if he were to gain success without the assistance of
the Deity; and the presence of the Gods is so order'd, that we
may retrench every thing that is miraculous, without making
any alteration in the action or character of the human persona∣ges.
Thus in the instance of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> tho' <HI>Jupiter</HI> fa∣vours
<HI>Aeneas,</HI> yet <HI>Aeneas</HI> is painted in stronger colours of forti∣tude,
he appears superior, as a man unassisted, and able to conquer
<HI>Turnus</HI>; and consequently the favour of <HI>Jupiter</HI> makes no altera∣tion
in the action or character of <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>There is likewise a wide difference between the assistance of a
Man, and of a God: The actions of men belong only to the
performers of those actions, but when a Deity assists us by in∣spiring
us with strength and courage, the actions we perform are
really our own, and the more he favours us the more glory he
gives us: so that the assistance of man eclipses, but the assistance of
a God exalts, our glory. Thus for instance, when <HI>Achilles</HI> is
pursuing <HI>Hector,</HI> he charges the <HI>Greeks</HI> to keep off from <HI>Hector</HI>;
their assistance might lessen his glory: but when <HI>Pallas</HI> offers her
assistance he immediately embraces it as an honour, and boasts of it
as such to <HI>Hector.</HI> I have been large upon this objection, because
the Reader ought to carry it in his memory thro' the whole Po∣em,
and apply it to every action, in which any share is ascribed
to any Deity. See <HI>Bossu</HI> more at large concerning this objection.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 519. <L><HI>And sate On polish'd stone before his Palace gate.</HI>]</L></Q>
We have here an ancient custom recorded by the Poet; a King
places himself before the gate of his Palace upon a seat of marble,
worn smooth by long use, says <HI>Eustathius,</HI> or perhaps smooth'd
exquisitely by the hand of the workman. What I would
chiefly observe is, that they placed themselves thus in public for
the dispatch of justice: We read in the scripture of Judges <HI>sitting
in the gate</HI>; and that this procedure of <HI>Nestor</HI> was for that purpose
is probable from the expression, <HI>He sate in the seat where</HI> Ne∣leus

wisdom in the discharge of justice.) <HI>Nestor</HI> is also describ'd as
bearing his sceptre in his hand, which was never used but upon
some act of regality, in the dispatch of justice, or other solemn
occasions. Perhaps, says <HI>Dacier,</HI> these seats or thrones might be
consecrated with oil, to draw a reverence to the seats of Justice,
as by an act of religion; but I rather judge (adds she) that no
more is meant than to express the shining of these thrones, they
being undoubtedly made of marble.</P>

Herodotus</HI> informs us, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, that all the <HI>Pisistrati</HI>

his anvil and hammer; but what occasion has he for an anvil
and hammer in the art of a Gilder? <HI>Boileau</HI> has excellently vindi∣cated
<HI>Homer</HI> from this objection, in his reflections upon <HI>Longinus</HI>;
this Gilder was a gold-beater; <HI>Nestor</HI> we see furnish'd the gold,
and he beat it into leaves, so that he had occasion to make use of
his anvil and hammer; the anvil was portable, because the work
was not laborious. Our modern travellers assure us, that it is at
this day the practice in the eastern regions, as in <HI>Persia,</HI> &amp;c. for
the artists in metals to carry about with them the whole imple∣ments
of trade, to the house of the persons where they find em∣ployment;

in what sense <HI>Minerva</HI> can be said to come to the sacrifice? <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
answers, that the Ancients finding the inclinations of men to
be bent incontinently upon pleasures, to oblige them to use them
moderately, distinguish'd times, ordain'd sacrifices, and repre∣senting
the Gods in the forms of men, brought them to use
those pleasures with discretion; they taught them that the Gods
came down to their libations and sacrifices, to induce them to
govern their conversation with reverence and modesty: Thus <HI>Ju∣piter</HI>

<P>If I might be pardon'd a conjecture, I would suppose, that
<HI>Minerva</HI> may in another sense be said to come to the sacrifice; I
mean by her Image or statue: and what may seem to confirm
this opinion, is what <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates in his third book concerning
the above-mention'd <HI>Aethiopians</HI>; they carry'd about the statues
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the other Gods twelve days, during which time
the Gods were said to be gone to the <HI>Aethiopians:</HI> and if the
Gods may be said to come to the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> by their statues; why
may not the same be said of <HI>Minerva,</HI> from the introduction of

It is very necessary to say something about this practice of wo∣men
bathing and anointing men; it frequently occurs thro' the
whole <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and is so contrary to the usage of the moderns as
to give offence to modesty; neither is this done by women of in∣ferior
quality, but we have here a young Princess, bathing, anoint∣ing,
and cloathing the naked <HI>Telemachus. Eustathius</HI> indeed tells us,
it was undoubtedly by her father's command: but if it was a
piece of immodesty, it does not solve the objection, whoever com∣manded
it. I confess it would be immodest in these ages of the
world, and the only excuse that occurs to me is, to say that Cu∣stom
establish'd it. It is in manners, in some degree, as in dress;
if a fashion never so indecent prevails, yet no person is ridi∣culous,
because it is fashionable; so in manners, if a practice pre∣vails
universally, tho' not reconcilable to real modesty, yet no per∣son
can be said to be immodest who comes into it, because it is
agreeable to the custom of the times and countries.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 610. &amp;c. <L><HI>The conclusion of the book.</HI>]</L></Q> I shall lay together
what I have further to observe on the conclusion of this book:
It is remarkable that the Poet does not amuse himself in descri∣bing
the present he receiv'd from <HI>Nestor,</HI> or the provisions for the
journey, or even the journey it self at large; he dispatches the
whole in a few lines very judiciously; he carries his Heroe directly
to <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who is to furnish many incidents that contribute to
the design of the Poem, and passes over other matters as unnecessary.</P>
<P>We have here likewise a piece of poetical Geography, and learn
that it is exactly two days journey from <HI>Pyle</HI> to <HI>Lacedaemon.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="note">
<P>This book takes up three days; the first is spent in the enquiries
<HI>Telemachus</HI> makes of <HI>Nestor</HI> concerning <HI>Ulysses</HI>; the two last in the
morning sacrifice at <HI>Pylos,</HI> and in the journey of <HI>Telemachus</HI> to
<HI>Lacedaemon</HI>; so that five days have now pass'd since the opening
<PB N="184" REF="211"/>
of the Poem. I have said nothing about the sacrifice, tho' it be
the most exact description of the sacrifices as practis'd by the An∣cients,
perhaps extant in any Author; I refer to the observations
upon the first book of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>I would here remark that the three first books are writ∣ten
with the utmost simplicity, there has been no room for such
exalted strokes of Poetry as are to be found in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or
in the future parts of the <HI>Odyssey</HI>: But this is not owing to the
decay of genius in <HI>Homer,</HI> as some Critics have affirm'd, (who
look upon the <HI>Odyssey</HI> as bearing marks of his declining years,)
but to the nature of the subject. The characters of <HI>Achilles</HI> and
<HI>Ulysses</HI> are both very great, but very different. The <HI>Iliad</HI> con∣sists
of battles, and a continual commotion; the <HI>Odyssey</HI> in Pati∣ence
and Wisdom: and consequently the style of the two Poems
must be as different as the characters of the two Heroes. A no∣ble
fountain of Poetry opens in the next book, and flows with
an uninterrupted course almost through the whole <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 5.— <L><HI>invoking</HI> Hymen<HI>'s pow'r.</HI>]</L></Q> <HI>Athenaeus</HI> has
been very severe upon this passage, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, and
<HI>Dacier</HI> from <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristarchus,</HI> says <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> misguides us, the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
led him into an error; whereas the marriage is com∣pleated,
the wedded couples gone away from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and he
and <HI>Helen</HI> are alone at <HI>Lacedaemon.</HI> The five verses, continues he,
<PB N="248" REF="275"/>
(the fifteenth to the twentieth inclusively) are taken from the 18th
book of the <HI>Iliads,</HI> and inserted very improperly in this place by
<HI>Aristarchus. Athenaeus</HI> gives several reasons for his opinion, as that
music and dancing were very contrary to the severe manners of
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>; besides the dance was a <HI>Cretan</HI> dance, how
then could it be practis'd among the <HI>Spartans?</HI> The Poet men∣tions
neither the name of the Bard, nor one word of the sub∣ject
of the songs: neither can the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
be apply'd at all to the Dancers, but to the Musicians; and last∣ly,
it is not to be imagin'd that <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Pisistratus</HI> should
be so unpolite, as not to be at all affected with the music, had
there been any, and yet break out into such wonder at the sight
of the beauty of the Palace of <HI>Menelaus. Aristarchus,</HI> adds he,
thought the description of the wedding of the son and daughter
of a King was too meanly and concisely describ'd, and therefore
made this addition.</P>
<P>But it is easy to refute <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> and vindicate <HI>Aristarchus. A∣thenaeus</HI>
understood <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the wrong sense, they
are of the imperfect, <HI>he was sending,</HI> or <HI>about to send,</HI> and
not <HI>had sent,</HI> &amp;c. If the marriage had been absolutely finish'd,
why should <HI>Minerva</HI> absent her self from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> when the ce∣lebration
of the nuptials is the only reason of the absence of
that Goddess? and as for music and dancing being contrary to
the severe manners of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> this is all conjecture:
<HI>Menelaus</HI> lived more than three hundred years before <HI>Lycurgus</HI>;
and because such diversions were forbid in <HI>Sparta</HI> in the days of
<HI>Lycurgus,</HI> must it follow that they were not used in those of <HI>Me∣nelaus?</HI>
And should it be granted that music and dancing were
not used in his times, might he not relax a little from the se∣verity
of his times, upon such an occasion of joy as the marriage
of a son and daughter? I am sure these diversions are not more
contrary to the severity of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> than the magnificence of
the Palace of <HI>Menelaus</HI> was to their simplicity. <Q REND="inline">"But he does
not name the Bard, or the subject of his songs":</Q> But is this
a reason why the verses are spurious? we should rather admire
the judgment of the Poet, who having so fair an opportunity to
<PB N="249" REF="276"/>
describe these nuptials, yet rejects the temptation, dismisses the whole
in a few lines, and follows where his subject leads him. The obje∣ction
about the dance being <HI>Cretan</HI> is not more valid: <HI>Menelaus</HI>
(as we learn from the preceding book) had been in <HI>Crete,</HI> and
might bring it thence to <HI>Lacedaemon.</HI> And as for the Criticism
upon <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> it is but a fallacy; <HI>Casaubon</HI> has shewn beyond
contradiction, that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is apply'd indifferently to all those
who give example to others; and consequently may be apply'd to
Dancers as well as Musicians. It may be further added, that al∣though
it should be allow'd that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is only pro∣perly
apply'd to music, yet in this place the word would not be
improperly apply'd to dancers; for the dancers, without usurping
upon the province of the singer, might <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or chuse those songs, to which they desired to dance; as is the
usage at this day.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus</HI> is of opinion, that the whole twelve lines after the
second to the fifteenth are not genuine; but what has been said
of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> may be apply'd to <HI>Diodorus.</HI></P>

his felicity with his misfortunes: And <HI>Telemachus</HI> coming into

These sheep, as describ'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> may be thought the creation
of the Poet, and not the production of nature: But <HI>Herodotus,</HI>
says <HI>Eustathius,</HI> writes, that in <HI>Scythia</HI> the oxen have no horns
thro' the extremity of the cold: He quotes this very verse, right∣ly
intimating, adds <HI>Herodotus,</HI> that in hot regions the horns of
cattle shoot very speedily. <HI>Aristotle</HI> directly asserts, that in <HI>Libya</HI>
the young ones of horned cattle have horns immediately after
they are brought into the world. So that <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI>
vindicate <HI>Homer.</HI> The Poet adds, that the sheep breed three times
in the year; these words may have a different interpretation, and
imply that they breed in three seasons of the year, and not only
in the spring as in other countries; or that the sheep have at
once three lambs; but the first is the better interpretation. <HI>Athe∣naeus</HI>

Thus in <HI>Lusitania</HI> a country of <HI>Spain,</HI> now <HI>Portugal,</HI> there

<HI>Menelaus</HI> neither mentions <HI>Agamemnon, Clytemnestra,</HI> nor <HI>Aegy∣sthus</HI>

the whole <HI>Iliad Menelaus</HI> is describ'd as a very affectionate bro∣ther,
and the love he bears <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is the reason why he pas∣ses

conquest of <HI>Troy</HI>; but he throws the destruction of so many
brave men who fell before it, in the contrary scale; and it so far
outweighs both his wealth and his glory, that they both are
joyless to him. Either of these interpretations shew an excellent tem∣per
of humanity in <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who thinks the effusion of blood
too dear a price for glory. At the same time the Poet gives
an admirable picture of human nature, which is restless in the
pursuit of what it miscalls happiness, and when in possession of
it, neglects it. But the disquiet of <HI>Menelaus</HI> arises not from incon∣stancy
of temper, but wisdom; it shews that all happiness is un∣satisfactory.</P>

been false to him, and receives her into a full degree of favour.
But perhaps the Reader might have been shock'd at it, and pre∣judiced
against <HI>Helen</HI> as a person that ought to be forgot, or
have her name only mention'd to disgrace it: The Poet there∣fore,

condemning her own infidelity in very strong expressions; she

The conjectures about this cordial of <HI>Helen</HI> have been almost in∣finite.
Some take <HI>Nepenthes</HI> allegorically, to signify History, Mu∣sic,
or Philosophy. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the first of the <HI>Symposiacs</HI> af∣firms

<HI>Delinimentum illud quod Helena vino miscuit, non herba fuit,
non ex Indiâ succus, sed narrandi opportunitas, quae hospitem maero∣ris
oblitum flexit ad gaudium.</HI> What gave a foundation to this
fiction of <HI>Homer,</HI> as <HI>Dacier</HI> observes, might be this. <HI>Diodorus</HI>
writes that in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> the same with
<HI>Thebes</HI> where <HI>Menelaus</HI> sojourn'd, as has been already observ'd, there
lived women who boasted of certain potions which not only
made the unfortunate forget all their calamities, but drove away
the most violent sallies of grief or anger. <HI>Eusebius</HI> directly af∣firms,
that even in his time the women of <HI>Diospolis</HI> were able to
calm the rage of grief or anger by certain potions. Now whe∣ther
this be truth or fiction, it fully vindicates <HI>Homer,</HI> since a
Poet may make use of a prevailing, tho' false, opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Milton</HI> mentions this <HI>Nepenthes</HI> in his excellent Masque of <HI>Comus.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>—Behold this cordial Julep here,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Is of such pow'r as this to stir up joy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.</HI></L></Q>
But that there may be something more than fiction in this is very
probable, since the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> were so notoriously skill'd in phy∣sick;
and particularly since this very <HI>Thon,</HI> or <HI>Thonis,</HI> or <HI>Thoon,</HI> is
reported by the ancients to have been the inventor of physic a∣mong
the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI> The description of this <HI>Nepenthes</HI> agrees
admirably with what we know of the qualities and effects of
<HI>Opium.</HI></P>
<P>It is further said of <HI>Thon,</HI> that he was King of <HI>Canopus,</HI> and
entertain'd <HI>Menelaus</HI> hospitably before he had seen <HI>Helen</HI>; but after∣wards
falling in love with her, and offering violence, he was slain
by <HI>Menelaus.</HI> From his name the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> gave the name of
<HI>Thoth</HI> to the first month of their year, and also to a city the
name of <HI>Thonis. Aelian</HI> writes that <HI>Menelaus</HI> when he travell'd
<PB N="258" REF="285"/>
to the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> committed <HI>Helen</HI> to the protection of <HI>Thonis</HI>;
that she fell in love with him, that <HI>Polydamna</HI> growing jealous
confin'd her to the Island <HI>Pharos,</HI> but gave her an herb to pre∣serve
her from the poison of serpents there frequent, which from
<HI>Helen</HI> was call'd <HI>Helenium. Strabo</HI> writes, that at <HI>Canopus</HI> on the
mouth of <HI>Nile</HI> there stands a city named <HI>Thonies,</HI> from King
<HI>Thonis,</HI> who receiv'd <HI>Helen</HI> and <HI>Menelaus. Herodotus</HI> relates, that
<HI>Thonis</HI> was Governor of <HI>Canopus,</HI> that he represented the injury

<P>This last remark from <HI>Herodotus</HI> is sufficient to shew, that <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>

a King named <HI>Proteus,</HI> that the Poet builds his fables upon truth,

reality, yet it bears the resemblance of it; and <HI>Megabysus</HI> the
<HI>Persian</HI> (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes) practis'd it, as we learn from
history. We may reasonably conjecture that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was commit∣ted
to <HI>Helen,</HI> in hopes that he would discover the affairs of the
army more freely to her than any other person: for what could
be more agreeable to a <HI>Greek,</HI> than to be committed to the care

Poet raises the character of <HI>Helen,</HI> by making her shew her re∣pentance
by an act of generosity to her countryman. The origi∣nal
says she gave an oath to <HI>Ulysses</HI> not to discover him before
he was in Safety in the <HI>Grecian</HI> army: Now this does not imply
that she ever discover'd to the <HI>Trojans</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had enter'd
<HI>Troy:</HI> the contrary opinion is most probable; for it cannot be
imagin'd but all <HI>Troy</HI> must have been incens'd greatly against
her, had they known that she had conceal'd one of their mor∣tal
enemies, and dismiss'd him in safety: It was sufficient for <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
to take her oath that she would not discover him, 'till he was
in security: he left her future conduct to her own discretion. It
is probable that she furnish'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> with a sword, for in his re∣turn
he slew many <HI>Trojans:</HI> He came to <HI>Troy,</HI> observes <HI>Eustathius,</HI>
in rags, and like a slave; and to have conceal'd a sword, would
have endanger'd his life upon a discovery of it, and given strong

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 375. <L><HI>Some Daemon anxious for the</HI> Trojan <HI>doom.</HI>]</L></Q> It
is the observation of <HI>Eustathius,</HI> that these words are very artful∣ly
introduced to vindicate <HI>Helen</HI>; They imply that what she acted
was by compulsion, and to evidence this more clearly, <HI>Deiphobus</HI> is
given her for an attendant as a spy upon her actions, that she might
not conceal any thing that should happen, but act her part well
by endeavouring to deceive the <HI>Greeks</HI> in favour of <HI>Troy.</HI> It is
the Daemon, not <HI>Helen,</HI> that is in fault; this, continues <HI>Eustathius,</HI>
answers many objections that lye against <HI>Helen</HI>; for if she was a
real penitent, as she her self affirms, how comes she to endeavour
to deceive the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by the disguise of her voice, into more mi∣sery
than had yet arisen from a ten years war? Or indeed is it
credible that any person could modulate her voice so artfully as
to resemble so many voices? And how could the <HI>Greeks</HI> enclosed
in the wooden horse believe that their wives who were in <HI>Greece,</HI>
could be arriv'd in so short a space as they had been conceal'd
there, from the various regions of <HI>Greece,</HI> and meet together in
<HI>Troy?</HI> Would the wives of these Heroes come into an enemy's
country, when the whole army, except these latent Heroes, were
retir'd from it? this is ridiculous and impossible. I must confess
there is great weight in these objections: But <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers
all by the interposition of the Daemon; and by an idle tradition
that <HI>Helen</HI> had the name of <HI>Echo,</HI> from the faculty of mimicking
sounds; and that this gift was bestow'd upon her by <HI>Venus</HI> when
she married <HI>Menelaus,</HI> that she might be able to detect him if he
should prove false to her bed, by imitating the voice of the suspected
person: (but <HI>Menelaus</HI> had more occasion for this faculty than <HI>Helen.</HI>)
As for the excuse of the Daemon, it equally excuses all crimes: For
instance, was <HI>Helen</HI> false to <HI>Menelaus?</HI> The Daemon occasion'd it:
Does she act an imposture to destroy all her <HI>Grecian</HI> friends, and even
<HI>Menelaus?</HI> The Daemon compells her to it: The Daemon compells
her to go with <HI>Deiphobus,</HI> to surround the horse thrice, to sound the
<PB N="262" REF="289"/>
sides of it, to endeavour to surprize the latent <HI>Greeks</HI> by an imi∣tion
of the voices of their wives, and in short, to act like a per∣son
that was very sincere in mischief.</P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> takes another course, and gives up <HI>Helen,</HI> but remarks
the great address of <HI>Menelaus. Helen</HI> had, said she, long de∣sired
nothing so much as to return to <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>; and her
heart had long been wholly turn'd to <HI>Menelaus: Menelaus</HI> is not
at all convinc'd of this pretended sincerity; but it would have
been too gross, after he had taken her again to his bed, to con∣vict
her of falshood: He therefore contents himself barely to re∣ply
that some Daemon, an enemy to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> had forc'd her to
a conduct disagreeable to her sincerity. This (continues <HI>Dacier</HI>)
is an artful, but severe Irony.</P>
<P>As for the objection concerning the impossibility of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
believing their wives could be in <HI>Troy</HI>; she answers, that the Au∣thors
of this objection have not sufficiently consider'd human na∣ture.
The voice of a belov'd person might of a sudden, and by
surprize, draw from any person a word involuntary, before he has
time to make reflection. This undoubtedly is true, where cir∣cumstances
make an imposture probable; but here is an impossi∣bility;
it is utterly impossible to believe the wives of these He∣roes
could be in <HI>Troy.</HI> Besides, <HI>Menelaus</HI> himself tells us, that
even he had fallen into the snare, but <HI>Ulysses</HI> prevented it; this
adds to the incredibility of the story, for if this faculty of mi∣mickry
was given upon his marriage with <HI>Helen,</HI> it was nothing
new to him, he must be suppos'd to be acquainted with it, and
consequently be the less liable to surprize: Nay it is not impos∣sible,
but the experiment might have been made upon him be∣fore
<HI>Helen</HI> fled away with <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In short, I think this passage wants a further vindication: the
circumstances are low, if not incredible. <HI>Virgil,</HI> the great imitator
of <HI>Homer,</HI> has given us a very different and more noble descri∣ption
of the destruction of <HI>Troy:</HI> he has not thought fit to imi∣tate
him in this description.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="290"/>
If we allow <HI>Helen</HI> to act by compulsion, to have fear'd the
<HI>Trojans,</HI> and that <HI>Deiphobus</HI> was sent as a spy upon her actions;
yet this is no vindication of her conduct: she still acts a mean
part, and thro' fear becomes an accomplice in endeavouring to
betray and ruin the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>I shall just add, that after the death of <HI>Paris, Helen</HI> married
<HI>Deiphobus</HI>; that the story of the wooden horse is probably foun∣ded

answers, that <HI>Homer</HI> might have heard that the <HI>Nile,</HI> continu∣ally
bringing down much earthy substance, had enlarg'd the con∣tinent:
and knowing it not to be so distant in his time, took
the liberty of a Poet, and describ'd it as still more distant in the
days of <HI>Menelaus.</HI> But <HI>Dacier</HI> never sees a mistake in <HI>Homer.</HI> Had
his Poetry been worse if he had describ'd the real distance of <HI>Pha∣ros?</HI>
It is allowable in a Poet to disguise the truth, to adorn his
story; but what ornament has he given his Poetry by this enlarge∣ment?
<HI>Bochart</HI> has fully prov'd that there is no accession to the
Continent from any substance that the <HI>Nile</HI> brings down with it:
<PB N="265" REF="292"/>
the violent agitation of the seas prohibit it from lodging, and
forming it self into solidity. <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
was ignorant of the mouths of <HI>Nile</HI>: but <HI>Strabo</HI> answers, that
his silence about them is not an argument of his ignorance, for
neither has he ever mention'd where he was born. But <HI>Strabo</HI>
does not enter fully into the meaning of <HI>Eratosthenes</HI>: <HI>Eratost∣henes</HI>
does not mean that <HI>Homer</HI> was ignorant of the mouths of
<HI>Nile</HI> from his silence, but because he places <HI>Pharos</HI> at the distance
of a whole day's sail from the Continent. The only way to u∣nite
this inconsistence is to suppose, that the Poet intended to spe∣cify
the <HI>Pelusiac</HI> mouth of <HI>Nile,</HI> from which <HI>Pharos</HI> stands about
a day's sail: but this is submitted to the Critics.</P>
<P>I can't tell whether one should venture to make use of the
word <HI>Nile</HI> in the translation, it is doubtless an Anachronism;
that name being unknown in the times of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI>

country makes him prefer it to places of a more happy situati∣on.

that this depended upon the uncertainty they were yet

transitions. There is some obscurity in the <HI>Greek,</HI> this ari∣ses
from the warmth with which she speaks, she has not leisure to
explain her self fully, a circumstance natural to a person in
anger.</P>
<P><HI>Penelope</HI> gives a very beautiful picture of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"The best
of Princes are allow'd to have their favourites, and give
a greater share of affection than ordinary to particular
persons. But <HI>Ulysses</HI> was a father to all his people alike,
and loved them all as his children; a father, tho' he
bears a more tender affection to one child than to another,
yet shews them all an equal treatment; thus also a good King
is not sway'd by inclination, but justice, towards all his subjects." <BIBL><HI>Dacier.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>One circumstance is very remarkable, and gives us a full view
of a person in anger; at the very sight of <HI>Medon Penelope</HI>
flies out into passion, she gives him not time to speak one sylla∣ble,
but speaks her self as if all the Suitors were present, and re∣proaches
them in the person of <HI>Medon,</HI> tho' <HI>Medon</HI> is just to her
and <HI>Ulysses</HI>; but anger is an undistinguishing passion. What she
says of ingratitude, recalls to my memory what is to be found in

It may be ask'd whence this conjecture of the Suitors arises? <HI>Pe∣nelope</HI>
is describ'd as weeping grievously, and fainting away, and
yet immediately the Suitors conclude she is preparing for the
Nuptials. <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that undoubtedly the Suitors un∣derstood
the Queen had purify'd her self with water, and
supplicated the Goddess <HI>Minerva,</HI> tho' the Poet omits the rela∣tion
of such little particularities. But whence is it that the Po∣et
gives a greater share of wisdom to <HI>Euryclea</HI> than to <HI>Penelope?
Penelope</HI> commands a servant to fly with the news of the absence
of <HI>Telemachus</HI> to <HI>Laertes,</HI> which could not at all advantage <HI>Tele∣machus,</HI>
and only grieve <HI>Laertes: Euryclea</HI> immediately diverts her
from that vain intention, advises her to have recourse to heaven, and
not add misery to the already miserable <HI>Laertes:</HI> This is Wisdom
in <HI>Euryclea.</HI> But it must be confess'd that the other is Nature in
<HI>Penelope: Euryclea</HI> is calm, <HI>Penelope</HI> in a passion: and <HI>Homer</HI>
would have been a very bad painter of human Nature, if he
had drawn <HI>Penelope</HI> thus heated with passion in the mild temper

the Lioness not as exerting any dreadful act of violence, (for such

by her enemies; which at once shews both her danger and

We have here an imaginary Being introduc'd by the Poet: The
whole is manag'd with great judgment; It is short, because it has
not a direct and immediate relation to the progress of the Poem,
and because such imaginary entercourses have ever been looked
upon as sudden in appearance, and as sudden in vanishing away.
The use the Poet makes of it, is to relieve <HI>Penelope</HI> from the ex∣tremity
of despair, that she may act her part in the future scenes
with courage and constancy. We see it is <HI>Minerva</HI> who sends this
phantom to <HI>Penelope</HI> to comfort her: Now this is an allegory to
express that as soon as the violence of sorrow was over,
the mind of <HI>Penelope</HI> return'd to some degree of tranquilli∣ty:
<HI>Minerva</HI> is no more than the result of her own refle∣ction
and wisdom, which banish'd from her breast those me∣lancholy
apprehensions. The manner likewise of its intro∣duction
is not less judicious; the mind is apt to dwell upon
those objects in sleep which make a deep impression when
awake: This is the foundation of the Poet's fiction; it is
<PB N="278" REF="305"/>
no more than a dream which he here describes, but he cloaths it
with a body, gives it a momentary existence, and by this method
exalts a low circumstance into dignity and Poetry.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 1073. <L><HI>And with consummate woe,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> In the ori∣ginal,
<HI>Penelope</HI> says plainly, she is more concern'd for her son than
her husband. I shall translate <HI>Dacier</HI>'s observation upon this pas∣sage.
We ought not to reproach <HI>Penelope</HI> for this seemingly shock∣ing
declaration, in preferring a son to an husband: Her senti∣ment
is natural and just; she had all the reason in the world to
believe that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was dead, so that all her hopes, all her
affection was entirely placed upon <HI>Telemachus:</HI> His loss therefore
must unavoidably touch her with the highest degree of sensibili∣ty;
if he is lost, she can have recourse to no second comfort. But
why may we not allow the reason which <HI>Penelope</HI> her self gives
for this superiority of sorrow for <HI>Telemachus?</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Telemachus,</HI> says
she, is unexperienc'd in the world, and unable to contend with
difficulties; whereas <HI>Ulysses</HI> knew how to extricate himself up∣on
all emergencies."</Q> This is a sufficient reason why she should
fear more for <HI>Telemachus</HI> than <HI>Ulysses:</HI> Her affection might be
greater for <HI>Ulysses</HI> than <HI>Telemachus,</HI> yet her fears might be strong∣er
for the son than the husband, <HI>Ulysses</HI> being capable to sur∣mount
dangers by experience, <HI>Telemachus</HI> being new to all diffi∣culties.</P>

ask'd what is the reason of this conduct, and why should the
Phantom refuse to relate any thing concerning the condition of
<HI>Ulysses? Eustathius</HI> answers, that if the Phantom had related the
full truth of the story, the Poem had been at an end; the very
constitution of it requires that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should arrive unknown to
all, but chiefly to his wife, as will appear in the prosecution of
<PB N="279" REF="306"/>
the story: The question is very natural for an affectionate wife
to make concerning an absent husband; but this being an im∣proper
place for the discovery, the Poet defers the solution of it,
'till the unravelling of the whole in the conclusion of the Poem.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="note">
<P>The action of this book takes up the space of two nights and
one day, so that from the opening of the Poem to the introdu∣ction
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are six days compleated.</P>
<P>But how long a time <HI>Telemachus</HI> afterwards stay'd with <HI>Mene∣laus,</HI>
is a question which has employ'd some modern <HI>French</HI> Cri∣tics;
one of which maintains, that he stay'd no longer than these
two nights at <HI>Lacedaemon:</HI> But it is evident from the sequel of the
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> that <HI>Telemachus</HI> arriv'd again at <HI>Ithaca</HI> two days after <HI>U∣lysses</HI>;
but <HI>Ulysses</HI> was twenty nine days in passing from <HI>Ogygia</HI> to
<HI>Ithaca,</HI> and consequently during that whole time <HI>Telemachus</HI> must
have been absent from <HI>Ithaca.</HI> The ground of that Critick's mi∣stake
was from the silence of <HI>Homer</HI> as to the exact time of his
stay, which was of no importance, being distinguish'd by no
action, and only in an Episodical part. The same thing led me
into the like error in the 33d Note on the second book, where
it is said that <HI>Telemachus</HI> return'd to <HI>Ithaca</HI> in less than twelve
days.</P>
