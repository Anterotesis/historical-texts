<HEAD>A Short View OF The present State OF THE Protestant Religion in
<HI>BRITAIN,</HI> &amp;c,</HEAD>
<P>I Always observed in such Cases as this, the only
way to come at a Clear Understanding of Par∣ticulars,
was to go back to their Generals,
to search the Original of things, and see from
thence not how they are represented, but how they
really are in their meer Nature, and Native Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>In doing this, I shall study as much as in me lies,
to give no Offence to any body, nor concern my self
with any thing, however warmly said on that Head,
but to my utmost, keep closs to impartial Truth in
Fact, and give my own thoughts as calmly as I
can.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Historical part may be counted super∣ficial,
and I am content it be so; no body can expect
a succinct History of Religion in three Sheets of Paper,
nor shall I, <HI>remote as I am from Books, Vouchers, and
Persons,</HI> enter into many Quotations, designing no
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
other History of these Affairs; but what every Mans
Memory may reflect on, or by very short reading, be
informed about.</P>
<P>I have no room to spare for Apologies; As I in∣tend
no Offence to any one, so I hope, no Man will
take Offence at me, misconstrue my Meaning, or cavil
at Mistakes in the manner—. If they do, if they
will raise Strife from what is design'd for Peace, the
Strife shall be theirs, the Peace shall be mine; and to
all false or railing Accusations, I answer in the words
of the Text, in the 9<HI>th.</HI> Verse of the Epistle of <HI>Jude,</HI>
and no more.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, this whole
Island was under the intire absolute Dominion of Po∣pery;
Rulers and People too much united in following
after Vanity and Idols, and very small faint Gli∣merings
of the Glorious Resurrection of Truth were
then only to be seen.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> VII. reigning in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> IV. in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> had nothing in them inclining to an Altera∣tion
of Religion, but supinely slept—under the in∣vincible
Operation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Opiat: Priest Craft,
and the Pomp of Religion had dozvd Man-kind, and
that Glorious Light which the Spirit of GOD, by the
Preaching of the Apostles, had spread thro' the World,
seem'd so overclouded with the Universal Vail of Su∣perstition,
and vile Traditional Performances, that it
look'd as if the General Dispensation was at End, the
Church of GOD compleated, and the World given up to
Original Blindness.</P>
<P>I would not be misunderstood here, as if there were
no Appearances in Particular Places and Persons of a
true Light; For God has never left the Church quite de∣solate:
And I know what has been alledged of the <HI>Wal∣denses,
Albigenses,</HI> and other suffering Christians—.
But I desire to be taken as I mean, that a General and
dreadful Darkness had at that Time overspread the
World, all the Potentates of <HI>Europe</HI> bowed at the Feet
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
of <HI>Baal;</HI> and the <HI>Romish</HI> Pontiff executed a Tyran∣nick
Power without Controul, if there were any Pro∣fessors
of Truth, they behooved to be Confessors also;
and what Light appear'd, tho it was received
with Love, it was a Guest that brought certain
Death with it—: Indeed the wonderful Power of
the invisible irresistable Grace of GOD was in nothing
more conspicuous, than in furnishing almost all to
whom he revealed his Truth, with such a Love to it,
Zeal for it, and Resolution in it, that Persecution and
Martyrdom were but meer Agents in the Propagation
of Truth; and <HI>Sanguis Martyrum</HI> was at that time more
than ever prov'd to be <HI>Semen Ecclesiae.</HI></P>
<P>In this suffering posture the Affairs of the Church stood
at the coming of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI>
the first part of his Reign gave little Hopes to any that a
Reformation could have its Rise in a Prince who com∣mitted
the Famous <HI>John Lambert</HI> to the Fire, and appear∣ed
qualified to be the most Famous Persecutor of Gods
Church that ever was in the World, being in his Conduct
Politick, in his Nature cholerick and cruel, in his Go∣vernment
Tyrannical, and in his Religion nothing at
all, but—what was guided by his Ambition and In∣terest.</P>
<P>But
behold how the Divine <HI>Power</HI> is magnified, in
making his Enemies destroy themselves; Pride, Am∣bition,
Covetousness, and the Wrath of Man in this
day, brought to pass the Glorious and determined Designs
of God, and the Consusions and Extravagancies of the
World assisted to open the Eyes of such whose Hearts
God at the same time had touch't with His Grace; and
now the Great Light of Truth began to break out be∣tween
the Clouds, and by wonderful and various steps
of Providence, too long to relate, All the Mists of Dark∣ness,
Ignorance and Superstition fled away, and Truth
in its Native Lustre shone over these Parts of the World.</P>
<P>For now <HI>Luther</HI> had broke in upon Error in <HI>Gorma∣ny;</HI>
like a Torrent the Kings of the Earth began to hate
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the Whore; and all the Northern Part of <HI>Europe</HI> fell off
from Idolatry, both Princes and People.</P>
<P>The various Turns in <HI>England</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. a∣bout
the Article of Divorce, the Regale, and other things,
widned a Breach between him and the Pope;
and those lucid Intervals gave such breathings to the
Reformed Religion, that it advanc't exceedingly, till
even in his Reign, it crept into, first his Cabinet, and
then his bed.</P>
<P>In this Crisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he strook the two great Preliminary
Strokes at the Root of Popery, in which, tho I see no
Ground to suggest, he had any Religious aim, yet Pro∣vidence,
who acted him as the Instrument, without
giving him the Principle, brought to pass the End by the
involuntary Agency of what Means he thought sit.</P>
<P>These two Blows at Popery, which I call prelimina∣rys,
were casting off the Popes Supremacy, and over∣turning
these Seminaries of Filthiness and. Superstition,
the Abbeys and Monasteries.</P>
<P>And here any Body may see the Reason of my
going thus far back in this Account, and which per∣haps
they might begin to think impertinent to my
purpose. But the Case is this, Had King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Zeal
been for Retormation indeed, or rather had he not
been acted by Pride in one, and Avarice in the other,
that Step had been taken another way, which if it had,
the Snares that have follow'd, had been perhaps pre∣vented.
I explain my self thus.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. been Enlightned by a true Know∣ledge,
in proportion to his Circumstance, had his Fury
been a Religious Zeal—, had he been acted by the Chri∣stian,
not the Monarch, when he pull'd down the Su∣premacy
of the Pope, he had erected the true Gospel
Supremacy of Christ Jesus, and in this unhappy Mi∣stake,
has been found all the brooding Snakes of Eccle∣siastick
Tyranny, which this part of the World has been
plagued with ever since.</P>
<P>I'll repeat it another way yet plainer, I hope I shall
be excused the Tautology.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII, A meer Tyrant, a Man of no Religion
in his inside, and but very little in the outside; for
the Tyrant was too rampant in him, to suffer him to
be a Hypocrite, when he pull'd down the Supremacy
of the Pope, immediately set up his own; this was,
I say, only dethroning one Devil to set up another;
however, the Church was yet Popish, the Reformation
young, and the Heads of the Reformers were glad to
lay hold of this Handle to pull down what they really
struggled with, as Tyrannical; not foreseeing
that the Tyranny still remained, tho the Masters
were chang'd, or that this Monster call'd the temporal
Supremacy, was big with future Mischiefs, which ge∣nerating
from one another, would still bring the Church
of God into, at least, unscriptural Bondage.</P>
<P>But let no Man read this with Prejudice at the Good
Men who were the Agents, who in the simplicity of
their Souls, did this, and by it laid the Ax effectually
to the Root of Religious Subjection; and the impious
Ambition of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> If God Almighty for
our Sins, and partly for Punishment, suffered yet this
<HI>Canaanite</HI> to remain in the Bowels of the Reformati∣on,
without doubt he had his Divine Ends in it, which
I shall not presume to enquire into.</P>
<P>On this Foundation has however been built, that un∣happy
Structure of Division, which has made such
Chasms in Gods Church, broke in so much upon
our Charity, and fatally upon our more perfect Re∣formation,
even to this Day.</P>
<P>For the Supremacy in Matters Ecclesiastical, being
resolved in the King, began to produce strange Effects,
and some Martyrs, as they call them, on the <HI>Romish</HI>
side died for denying it, such as Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI>
Bishop <HI>Fisher</HI> and others, as in <HI>Burnets</HI> History of the
Reformation, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. may be seen at large.</P>
<P>I shall touch at some of the Evils, that setting this
Dignity on the head of the Temporal Prince brought
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
with it, and these were two. <HI>First,</HI> That in Matters
indifferent in themselves, the Command of the Civil
Magistrate, has Power to determine us, and make
those indifferent things necessary, and hereon is built
all our Ceremonial, that has since caused such Divisi∣on
in the Protestant Churches here. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI>
This I give as the Reason, or rather the Occasion, that
our <HI>English</HI> Church reformed into Episcopacy, and a
Pompous Hierarchy, rather than a <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Pa∣rity.</P>
<P>This
is what we mean by the <HI>Regale,</HI> which of
course brought the Pontificate along with it, and in
this <HI>Scotland</HI> had the Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> for that
the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> being not in the Direction
of the Prince, but rather in Opposition to the Regent the
Queen Mother, the Pomp, the Magnificence, and the
outside of the Matter lost all the Reverence it had in
the Court of Princes, where it seem'd to be Carress't
from some suitableness between them in Matters of
Dominion.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> resign'd this Authority to the
Pope, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was not very hasty in re∣suming
it again, as 'tis plain from <HI>Burnet's</HI> History of
the Reformation.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' first Reform'd, being under
the Reign of a Young King, he was easily prevail'd with
to form the Model of Church Government in this man∣ner,
as having his Eye more at the main Point, <HI>viz.</HI>
The rooting out of Idolatry and Superstition, but had
not yet had the Episcopal Hierarchy debated, or its
Scriptural Authority call'd in Question.</P>
<P>As to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> she rather went back in the
Reformation of Ceremonies, than foreward in destroy∣ing
them; for which two Reasons are assign'd by the
Writers of that Age.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> Policy, That by the preserving some sunilitude
to the old Rites, she might, if possible, bring the Papists
to comply with her way, and so prevent a Division.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
2. Her natural Gayness of Temper, which enclin'd
her to be much in Love with the Pomp and Shows of
Religion.</P>
<P>In King <HI>James</HI> the first, a new and unheard of Do∣ctrine
started into the World, found first in the Heads of
his Flatterers, That Kings were immediatly clothed with
their Power from above, that they Governed <HI>Jure Di∣vino,</HI>
and consequently must be obeyed as Gods Ordi∣nance,
and without any Controul.</P>
<P>I shall not run into the dark Particulars of that
wretched Doctrine, nor the Mischiefs it brought upon
both Nations; but having assign'd the proper Original,
both of Prelacy and Ceremonies, the two great things
now debated, I shall proceed to examine what has been
the Consequence of these things in these Kingdoms.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> I must own they brought immediat Con∣tention
into the Reformed Churches, and afterwards
all the Divisions, Schisms some call them, and Debates
that have been in the World, since their Foundation.</P>
<P>There were indeed early Differences in the Refor∣med
Churches in <HI>England,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hooper,</HI> and
Bishop <HI>Ridly</HI> cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded a little too warmly on both
sides, till Affliction and Suffering taught both of them
more Charity; and when they came both to die for the
Essentials of Religion, it taught them to own, the Root
of Religion might be sound, where the Blossom had
not the same flagrance; that the Faith, Hope, Love,
and other Christian Graces might be preserved, where
they differed in the Circumstances.</P>
<P>However, I believe no man will Dispute with me,
that the very Bishops themselves in those Times
were Good Men; of Holy and Blameless Lives,
sound and wholsome Doctrine; constant and Labo∣rious
in Preaching, of firm and unshaken <HI>Faith,</HI> of
invincible Fortitude in the Cause of Christ, and sealed
the Reformation with their Blood; and tho I am as far
from Episcopacy in my Opinion as any man in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
yet I must do Justice; these were Bishops, of whom
five besides Arch-Deacon <HI>Philpot,</HI> past the Fiery Trial,
and laid down their Lives in the Glorious Cause of Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>These
were not dumb Dogs, but Zealous Teachers
of the Good People, and having taught Christ first, they
died for him afterwards: A thing easier to talk of
than to do.</P>
<P>In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, the <HI>Regale</HI> and <HI>Pontificat</HI>
continuing still in the Church, Bishops and Ceremonies,
reserv'd their Legal Sanction or Confirmation rather; but
as the World began to encrease in Knowledge, and Light
spread it self further than usual; so People began to
be much out of Love with the Pomp of Service, as with
a thing remote from the true Institution of the Gospel;
and tho several Acts of Parliament were made against
them, yet their Number increased every Day; the
Queen indeed proceeded very severely with them, to
reclaim them: And King <HI>James,</HI> tho bred up under
another kind of Church Government himself, carryed it
yet higher.</P>
<P>But as force never yet could be effectual over Religi∣on;
so all these Proceedings serv'd but to make the
persecuted People encrease.</P>
<P>Their Original, and I must own, I think a most just Ob∣jection
was, that the Church required a yet farther Refor∣mation,
that it was their Duty to serve God in the way
which was most agreeable to the Scriptures, and they
having disliked several things in the Ceremonies and
Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> pressed for a greater
Purity of Worship: Hence they were called PURI∣TANS.</P>
<P>The
Holiness and Blamelessness of their Lives, the
inoffensiveness of their Behaviour to all Persons, and the
General Character they had, was such, that the
Name first given them in Derision, was afterwards in
great Honour, both at home, and especially among
the Protestant Churches Abroad; and <HI>Erasmus,</HI> who
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
was in <HI>England</HI> at that time, and converst with them;
gave his Opinion of them in this noble Expression,
<HI>Sit anima mea cum Puritannis Anglicanis.</HI></P>
<P>Yet even these Puritans, than whom Europe never
shew'd better Christians, remain'd in the Communion of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in Subjection to <HI>Episcopacy.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason they gave for it was, that tho they
could not join in many things of their Worship, yet they
thought it their Duty not to separate, and make a
Breach or Schism in the Church.</P>
<P>Note, for I desire to be rightly understood, I do
not say it was their Duty not to separate, but they
were convinc't of its being their Duty, and so it
might become a Duty to them.</P>
<P>And that it was apparently thus, appear'd afterward,
even that when their Kings put that abominable Book
of Sports upon then, for which all the most Godly and
Pious Ministers were deprived; yet they did not ga∣ther
separate Churches, they went about Preaching,
Catechizing, and Instructing Private Families; but
they neither Baptized nor administraed the Lords
Supper, but their People Conform'd in that to the e∣stablish't
Church.</P>
<P>If 'tis enquir'd why I observe this, 'tis because,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I would note with what Force and unwillingness
the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have been driven to
be Dissenters, and as it were, thrust out of the
Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Because of alike backwardness to separate, which
appeared at the last juncture in 1661, which some
Censure the Dissenters, I think too severely for.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But to return to the Puritans:</P>
<P>The Government being resolved to push them upon
all extremities, and put every thing upon them that
they knew they would not comply with, an Opportuni∣ty
offered to try whether it was meerly for the sake
of Persecution and Oppression, that they were thus
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
used, or whether being really affraid of them, their
General Absence would ha' been grateful to them.</P>
<P>For the Discovery of a Planting in the North part
of <HI>America,</HI> called <HI>New England,</HI> happening about this
time, they Petition King <HI>James</HI> for Leave to go over
and plant themselves there—, which not to enter
here into the Circumstances of their Address, or its Re∣ception,
tho the History of it is very diverting, was
granted them.</P>
<P>Immediately the whole Kingdom was in motion,
and nothing was to be seen, but hiring Ships, packing
up Goods, selling Estates, Jewels, Houshold Stuff,
and Equippages, as if the whole Nation was going to
transplant.</P>
<P>The first Families that went, met with Terrible se∣verity
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, Famine, and Want of all things, particu∣larly
of Habitations in a barren uncultivated Wilder∣ness;
but what will not People suffer for the Liberty of
their Consciences? not discouraged by the Distresses they
went thro', they went on, and were followed by such
Multitudes, and with such Wealth, that if I remember
right above 19000 People were found to have gone over
in a very few Years; and so generally were they bent u∣pon
it, that the Council had it several times under de∣bate
to stop them.</P>
<P>But King James dying, and the Confusions of the
next Reign coming on, the Civil Wars broke out,
and the Power of the Parliament prevailing, the Princi∣ple
before mentioned, of Purity in Worship, obtained
on the Nation, Episcopacy was wholly supprest, and a
New form of Church Government erected.</P>
<P>This not only establish't Liberty to all the Puritans,
and put a stop to their flying Abroad, but the Scriptures
with the Pattern of the Primitive Churches, being the
Rule of their Establishment, a General Assembly of
Divines was call'd, who sat at <HI>Westminster</HI>—, what
their proceedings were, how they entertain'd a Bro∣therly
Correspondence with the Assembly in this Coun∣trey,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
how they unhappily divided again into different
Opinions, the Contests about the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of
Church Government, and of their manner in particu∣lar;
these are things too long to enter upon here, and
something Foreign to my Purpose also.</P>
<P>But to come as fast as possible to the present Times,
at the Restoration of the Monarchy in King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
this whole Fabrick, so it seem'd good to the Almigh∣ty,
fell at once, and the Episcopal Hierarchy, Liturgy,
Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were restored.</P>
<P>The King, whether sincerely desirous to unite his
Subjects, in possible, or not, is needless to determine
here, the Consequence best explain'd his Meaning; but
however, in pretence and outside he called it, appoints
a Conference at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and granted a Commission
to certain on both sides, to treat of an Accommodati∣on
of Differences.</P>
<P>The Ministers gladly accept of this Conference, and
principally being made to believe that Concessions be∣ing
made on their side, like Concessions would be made
on the other, and it might be possible to prevent a
Breach in the whole.</P>
<P>They then had several Meetings among themselves,
to consider how far they might comply, and as they
all thought it their Duty to go as far as possible: So
the Latitude of some People went farther than others.</P>
<P>I shall not Justifie or condemn here, it is not my
present Business; I shall readily own some Men went
farther than any Body of the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI>
would go now, and farther than they themselves would
ever after have gone again.</P>
<P>They offered to submit to a Superintendency; or
call it what you will, a moderate Episcopacy, and I
shall not dispute with any Man, whether they did not
offer to go higher than is consistent with a Presby terian
Parity.</P>
<P>They saw that whole Body going to be rent in Pieces;
they saw themselves going to be depriv'd of their Mi∣nisterial
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Function, and rendred uncapable of doing the
Good they were dedicated to, and they thought it their
Duty to go as far as possible to avoid the greater Evils
they saw before them, to themselves, the Church of
God, and the Power of Religion in general.</P>
<P>Let those that please to condemn their Latitude,
take it in what Sense they think fit, I readily grant all
that is Matter of Fact in their Concession, and which
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> has at large given an account of in the Hi∣story
of his Life.</P>
<P>I shall not examine how far the present Body of the
Dissenters are affected by it, or are to be censur'd for it,
or are any way concern'd in it, and I wave it here for
that Reason.</P>
<P>The Concessions of the Dissenters being delivered in,
the King told them, <HI>He was well pleased they agreed to
the Essence of Episcopacy;</HI> and renew'd his Assurances
to them of his earnest Desire of an Accommodation.</P>
<P>What the Treatment they met with from the Church
Party upon these Concessions was, is very remarkable,
and might put it out of any bodys thought ever to ap∣prehend
a Conjunction.</P>
<P>Their Concessions being rejected, the Ministers were
immediatly put to the Test of their Fidelity, and 'tis
remarkable; that of all these that offered their Con∣cessions,
very few, if any, conform'd; above 3000 of
the best, most Learned, and Pious of the Ministers,
and who enjoy'd the largest Benefices rejected the Of∣fers
of Bishopricks and Preferment, and quitted their
Livings; because they could not comply.</P>
<P>And thus the Episcopal Hierarchy was again re-esta∣blished
in <HI>England</HI>—, several Persecutions of the Dis∣senters
followed in the times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Ri∣gour
and Cruelty of which are standing Testimonies
that they are very far from being Episcopally enclin∣ed.</P>
<P>Several
Acts of Parliament have been since made
to render them as uneasy as possible, as the Act of uni∣formity,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
I mean the Amendments to it, the five Mile
Act, the <HI>et cactera</HI> Oath, the Sacramental Test, and
others.</P>
<P>But the Gentlemen on that side have seen their Er∣ror,
and even these we call High-Church Men, are now
forewardest to make Concessions to the Dissenters, in
order to bring them in to the Church—, what their
Design is, he must be blinder than I will suppose any
of my Readers to be, that does not see; but they do
the Dissenters this Service in it, to testifie for them, that
no Concessions will now bring them in, but such as shall
bring the Worship and Discipline of the Church down to
the Test of the Scriptures—, and this farther clears
them of all Suspicion of being Episcopally inclin'd.</P>
<P>And thus I have brought the Church of <HI>England</HI> part
of this Discourse down to the latter Times of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>At his Death the Successor was a Papist, and the first
Step he took, was to face about to the Dissenters, and
by the Gloss of Charity, and General Justice, court
them to his Party, giving them Liberty, but on
the foot of his Prerogative, not the Laws, to draw
them into the Snares, of, at least, a tacit Acknowledg∣ing
his Right to do so.</P>
<P>The Generality of the Dissenters saw the hook thro'
this Bait, and tho they accepted their Liberty, and
carryed it dutifully to their Sovereign; yet they pro∣fessed
their Dissatisfaction at having it given in an un∣parliamentary
manner.</P>
<P>Upon which these Famous Lines were made which
every Body had in their Prints and Discourse.
<Q><L>The Declaration's but a <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse,</L>
<L>The Form's illegal, and the Matter's worse.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some indeed were drawn into the Snares of Addres∣sing,
tho they were generally Opposed by the best and
greatest part of the Dissenters, and those that did it,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
thank't him for the Liberty indeed, yet were ignorant
both in the Design, and unbelieving in the Conse∣quences,
as appear'd in that as soon as their Eyes were
opened, they started back, and testified their Concern
for having been drawn in so far, of which presently.</P>
<P>This also farther appear'd in that, when the King,
who thought he had gain'd one Point, was for pushing
at another, <HI>vlz.</HI> the taking off the Penal Laws and Test;
the Dissenters, tho they had suffered so deeply, and
these Penal Laws were both wicked in their Nature,
and particularly pointed at them; yet they generally
rejected it, and declared they had rather be opprest by
the Church of <HI>E.</HI> than have both the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and themselves too, torn to Pieces by Popery or
those Laws invaded by the dispensing Power of the
Prince; nor could all King <HI>James</HI> his Booted Apostles
bring them off from this.</P>
<P>In the Sense of this the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Dissenters made that famous Capitulation, on which the
inviting over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterwards the Glo∣rious
Restorer of Britains Liberty was built, and which
is exprest in the Eighth Article of the Memorial to that
Prince, on the Performance of which Treaty, the E∣stablishment
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Tolle∣ration
of the Dissenters are equally built, and suppor∣ted
by Right, Truth, and Fundamental Law, and thus
they both stand at this Day.</P>
<P>I come now to the Reformation of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
which beginning later than that of <HI>England,</HI> by a∣bout
twelve Years, and having no Bonds of Tyranny
upon them, which as I have noted, drew <HI>England</HI> into the
Snare of the Regale; but their Reformation being made
by the People themselves, and Mr. <HI>Jobn Knox</HI> being their
<HI>Calvin,</HI> and who sent or went to <HI>Geneva</HI> on purpose to
concert the best Grounds of a National Settlement,
they had nothing imposed upon them, nor any body
to impose it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
The Lords which headed them, referr'd the whole
Settlement of Religion to the Ministers, they had the
Mischiefs <HI>England</HI> was fallen into by a partial and
pompous Reformation before their Eyes, and thus they
reform'd at once into the compleat Model, both as
to Discipline and Worship, which we find at this day.</P>
<P>Nor were they so dark in their Foresight, as not
to expect all the Rage and Opposition the Enemies of
such a Reformation could be guilty of, and to secure
the People therefore as far as possible in the strict Ad∣herence
to the mighty Work they were engag'd in,
they contrived the most Solemn, Awful and Tremen∣dous
Obligation, that I believe, any Nation ever
bound themselves in, since the Oath of God, which <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>
made the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> take at Mount <HI>Ho∣reb.</HI></P>
<P>This
is what they call the National Covenant, in
which the People bind themselves and their Posterity,
in the most solemn manner to God Almighty, to ad∣here
to, maintain and defend to the utmost of their Pow∣er
the Reformation they had settled, the Doctrine,
Discipline and Government of the Church, as exprest
in their confession of Faith, and several other Articles
both of Civil and Ecclesiastical Constitution therein
exprest, needless, and too long to be repeated here.</P>
<P>This Covenant was made first in the Year, 1581. the
new Reformation being then threatned with many E∣nemies,
as well Foreign as Domestick—, and it was
renewed again, in the Year 1590.</P>
<P>I am far from raising the least Scruple at, or making
any Reflection upon the Nature, the Canse, the Man∣ner,
or Obligation of this Covenant, or any Branch
of it; they that construe me so, do it to cover the
Shame of the other ill Treatment which I have dayly
from them.</P>
<P>I frankly own it a solemn, and almost just Obligation,
and declare I never meant in any thing I said, or printed,
the least Reflection against it; and 'tis very just I should
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
have the explaining my own words.</P>
<P>If what I have said any where, gives a seeming Re∣flection,
I should be very sorry, for the sake of them
that may ignorantly mistake me; as for those that
maliciously and wilfully mistake me, they are worth
no Honest Mans Notice, nor is it on their account in
the least, that I take notice of it here; but to disabuse
those who are imposed upon by such.</P>
<P>I freely recognize the National Covenant, and what
I said in the sixth Essay of our Fathers eating these
sowre Grapes, and us their Children's Teeth set on
edge by them. I wonder any Man should be so unjust
as to turn my words to a Meaning, That the Covenant
is a sowre Grape that sets the Childrens Teeth on Edge.
I therefore declare it to be only brought as an Allusion to
those People who load themselves with more Obligati∣ons
in their Notions of the Covenant, than the Cove∣nant
really imposes upon them—, and the Sense of
the place in which 'tis brought, will allow me this to
any impartial Person.</P>
<P>I was proving that the National Covenant is not at
all concern'd in the Union; I acknowledge first, that
the Covenant is binding to Posterity, and I add, that
for Argument sake, I'll grant; <HI>whether I believe it or
no,</HI> it has all that Obligation they alledge, <HI>let that be
what it will</HI>—, signifying thereby, they do reckon
greater Obligations than really are in the Cove∣nant,
and this I call eating sowre Grapes, 6<HI>th.</HI> Essay,
<HI>P.</HI> 20. and this I leave to any impartial Censure.</P>
<P>If this be not Satisfaction to any Honest Man, that I
have not the least Disrespect for the National Cove∣nant,
I shall on any Reasonable Sentence of indiffe∣rent
Judges, make such more solemn Declaration or
Acknowledgment as they can desire.</P>
<P>But to go on with my History of the Reformation in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> there was a great Difference in it from what
had been in <HI>England,</HI> for here it was made perfectly,
without the Assistance, <HI>and contrary to the Intention</HI> of
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
the Sovereign—, and the Regale therefore found no
body to espouse it, but the Reformers had opportuni∣ty
to make their Model as compleat as they could.</P>
<P>I know it has been objected, that in the Infancy of the
Reformation, they found the very Essence of Episcopa∣cy
necessary, and that was in the Superintendents na∣med
in the <HI>Church Policy,</HI> one of the first Instruments of
settlement devised for their Church, the Model of which
had been brought from <HI>Geneva</HI> by Mr. <HI>John Knox,</HI> and
some have raised Pleas from hence for the Prelatick
Power, as the most Original Institution, and the like
of the Common Prayers.</P>
<P>But the Bishops would be ill pleased to be
no other kind of Bishops than those were, who tho they
had a Diocess indeed, yet were subject to be deposed
by the ordinary Ministers of their own Bounds, and
therefore I do not bring this to justify Prelacy, but to
relate as near as I can, the Fact as it lies, and the Use
of it shall appear presently,</P>
<P>The Superintendents indeed had their Diocesses pre∣scribed,
<HI>and 'tis call'd by that very name,</HI> and they had
power to plant Ministers, settle Churches, and do se∣veral
things, which at that time could not be done
without them; but I must always insist upon their sub∣jection
as a Clause that Chocks all the Efforts to prove
the first Reformation Episcopal.</P>
<P>However, they were Superintendents, and there∣fore
some kind of Superintendency may not be incon∣sistent
with Presbyterian Parity, and thats all the use
I shall make of it.</P>
<P>I find another instance of this, which serves the pre∣sent
Occasion, and that is a Letter written in the
Year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> from the Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
to the Bishops in <HI>England,</HI> and in a differing
Stile from what we write here now; the letter begins
thus.</P>
<Q>The Superintendents, Ministers and Commissioners of the Church within
the Realm of <HI>Scotland</HI> to their <PB N="20" REF="19"/> Brethren the
Bishops and Pastors in <HI>England,</HI> who have renounced the <HI>Roman
Antichrist,</HI> and have professed with us <HI>the Lord Jesus</HI></Q>
<P>Here is something very remarkable, and worth
nothing.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> esteem'd, <HI>even the
Bishops</HI> and Pastors in those days, as Brethren pro∣felling
with them the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> a quite different
Language from those who stile them <HI>Dumb Dogs,</HI>
poor <HI>Rogues,</HI> &amp;c. Indecencys, which must be of∣fensive
to modest Ears, were the case much worse
than it is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was as far from owning
Episcopacy it self then as now, and in the very
Letter, they exclaim against the Pomp and
Ceremonies of Worship; but it did not at all
break off their Charity from the Persons of the
Bishops and Pastors, whom they still call'd Bre∣thren,
and own'd they profess't with them the <HI>Lord
Jesus.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Appellation of Brethren <HI>was most just,</HI> for
that the</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Bishops in those days, tho Prelats, vested with Civil
Power, wearing the Habit, and every way practising
their Church Power as now, yet were Holy and worthy
Christians, and of the same Class with <HI>Cranmer, Ridly,
Latimer, Farrar,</HI> and Blessed <HI>Hooper,</HI> who all of them
sealed the Reformed Religion with their Blood, and
durst pass to the Stake, and the Flames in maintaining
the true Protestant Faith, against that <HI>Roman Anti∣christ</HI>
here mentioned.</P>
<P>Let no Man suspect me here of favouring Episcopacy;
for tho of late Years, the very Men have been a Scandal
to the Office; yet I profess were the Bishops <HI>Now</HI> all <HI>Hoo∣pers</HI>
and <HI>ranmers;</HI> I could not agree to their Church Go∣vernment:
However, I cannot call it a damning Er∣ror;
certainly a Bishop may go to Heaven, or else our
want of Charity must be great for the Martyrs; I am
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
therefore for letting them alone, so far, I mean as respects
Civil Treatment, and fair Usage—; 'tis enough the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is fenced against them by Law, and
the Debt of common Civility is due to all the World.</P>
<P>In like manner we find the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> using
a Liturgy in former Times—, I shall not infer that
she ought to be distrusted on that Score, as likely to re∣lapfe
to it.</P>
<P>But this I shall observe, that Liturgies unimposed,
have always been in use in the Church, even from the
first 300 Years, and therefore are not so Frightful as
some people make them, and the Directory is a Li∣turgy
in its kind; all the Reformed Churches have Li∣turgies,
and all that could be desired in that case, by
the Dissenters in 1661 was, 1. That they be reformed.
And, 2<HI>dly.</HI> That they be not imposed.</P>
<P>To prove that a Liturgy and Common Prayer were
used in <HI>Scotland,</HI> take the following Instances.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the Church Policy mentioned before, we have these words, <HI>In
great Towns, we think it expedient, that every day there be either Sermon
or</HI> Common Prayer. And again, <HI>On the day of the Publick Sermon, we do
not think the</HI> Common Prayer <HI>needful to be used.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the Directory for the publick Worship in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> we
have this Introduction or Preface;
<Q>"In the beginning of this Blessed Reformation, our wise and Pious
Ancestors took care to set forth an Order for redress of many things,
which they then, by the word, discovered to be vain, erroneous
Superstitions and Idolatrous in the publick Worship of God—. <HI>This
occasioned many Godly and Learned Men to rejoice much in the Book of</HI>
Common Prayer <HI>at that time set forth.</HI>"</Q></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Summ of all this is, not at all to favour either Epis∣copacy
or Liturgy in their Attempts to be either justified
or restored in <HI>Britain:</HI> let no Man mistake me, but to do Ju∣stice
against furious Censures, who at the same time, that
the Nations professing both sorts, are going to unite,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
your to represent them as meer Popery or Heathen∣ism,
that the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> may be the easier
Censured for offers of Complyance with them, and
this I profess to be my single Reason for giving these
Instances; as for those who will have me mean what I
never intend, I leave them to their own ways, and
contemn their want of Candour.</P>
<P>'Tis enough the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is reform'd from
this, all the burthens of Ceremony, Forms and Hie∣rarchys
are taken away, and Purity in both Worship
and Discipline obtained; but there is a Christian Tem∣per
and Charity towards the Church of <HI>England</HI> certain∣ly
due, who, tho not so far reformed, are yet our Bre∣thren,
and of whom we yet hope, and ought to pray
that they shall one day be effectually Illuminated;
this Temper and Charity, I hope, shall now encrease
on an Union, and that all the Contention shall be to
out-preach, out-live, and out-practise one another, e∣mulating,
and thereby provoking one another to Love
and to Good Works.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the seve∣ral
Convulsions she has felt by the Interposition of Ty∣ranny,
Conquest, and sometimes Episcopacy, are to be
seen at large in the Historys of both Kingdoms, and I
shall not enter upon them.</P>
<P>The Persecutions of the Honest suffering Inhabitants
are a melancholly Testiwmony of the Assaults the Devil
and his Agents have made upon the Reformation here,
the Courage, Constancy, and vigorous Opposition of
the Zealous Confessors of Christ and his Church in this
Nation deserve a better Historian, and one less a Stran∣ger
to <HI>Scotland</HI> than I am, to record, and call for more
leisure, and more room than I have in this small Tract,
and I therefore leave them with this Remark, That no
Nation in the World has with more Zeal and Fidelity
opposed all the Impositions, Innovations and Barba∣rities
of the Enemies of Truth; than this Nation, and
more I cannot say here.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Under these suffering Circumstances, they continued,
with some short Intervals, till their being incorporated
with <HI>England</HI> in the time of <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> when tho
they seemed to be under a Military Government; yet
they had their Representatives in Parliament, were
Taxed but in Proportion to the Representative; and as
I am inform'd here, their Subjection, such as it was,
was attended with an Encrease of Wealth, Trade and
Property.</P>
<P>At the Restoration, they had Episcopacy, Tranny
and Superstition restored just as in <HI>England;</HI> Mini∣sters
that could not conform, turn'd out, silenced, per∣secuted,
fin'd, banished, imprisoned <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI>
just as in <HI>England,</HI> except only that their Cruelties
and Inhumanities here went farther than they did
there.</P>
<P>Thus they continued till the Revolution, at the
happy coming of the Great Deliverer of the whole
Island, King <HI>WIlliam;</HI> when Tyranny fled, and Guilt
drew in her blushing Countenance; Law, Truth,
Justice and Liberty reviving, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
obtained a Resurrection from a Hundred Years of Mi∣sery,
Uncertainty, and Distress.</P>
<P>Then Episcopay again vanish't in its turn, and its
Elder Sister Tyranny, abdicated with her; the Presby∣terian
Government of the Church was restored to its
Primitive Freedom, and to the full Exercise and Ex∣tent
of all its Legal Rights, as it is this day, and thus
far relates to the History of both Churches.</P>
<P>I come Now to the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> as the
third Class of People, I am to enter upon.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Dissenters in England.</HEAD>
<P>I left them ejected, contemn'd, persecuted, and op∣prest
during the Reign of the late King <HI>Charles;</HI> wheed∣led
and amused, under his Brother King <HI>James,</HI> restored
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
and tolerated under King <HI>William;</HI> and yet farther se∣cured
of that Liberty, tho under several Invasions, by
the Vigilance of the Honse of Lords, and the Honour, Ju∣stice
and special Favour of her present Majesty, whose
Concern for them, Clemency and Justice to them, and
free Adherence to their compleat Toleration, I hope
they wlll never forget.</P>
<P>Here I desire to speak something to the Matter of
dissenting from the Church of <HI>England</HI> in general, and
then to the Endeavours of Reconciliation on both sides;
and I hope that true stating the Matter of Fact, will
clear up all the Doubts People may entertain on both
sides without invectives, personal Reproaches, Railery,
or ill Treatment of the Parties, with which I shall no
ways concern my self.</P>
<P>I have deduc't the Dissenters from the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> from them they came out, the Reason of
their dissenting, I have confin'd to one Main Head,
<HI>viz. Purity of Worship,</HI> which was the first; subsequent
Scruples followed indeed, which were levelled at,
what I call the <HI>Regale and Pontificate,</HI> the Supremacy
of Civil Power, and the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy.</P>
<P>These drove them out of the Church, <HI>and these only;</HI>
for as to Doctrinal Articles, they are allow'd to be Or∣thodox,
and all the Dissenters frankly subscribe them,
the Quakers excepted, and the last Clause of the 27<HI>th.</HI>
Article to the Anabaptists.</P>
<P>It being objected by some, That <HI>Offers have been
made by the Dissenters to come into the Church,</HI> I desire
to speak directly to it, only to premise something
which I think necessary in this place, relating to the
Church of <HI>England</HI> her self.</P>
<P>1. The Dissenters, in their separating from the Church
of <HI>England;</HI> do by no means disown her being a true
Church, they charge her with no <HI>Doctrinal Error,</HI>
nothing Heretical or Antichristian, I mean <HI>as a Church.</HI></P>
<P>2. No Man can be so void of Charity as to judge that
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
a Man adhering to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>whose
Conscience is not farther enlightned,</HI> cannot be saved.</P>
<P>3. No Man then can deny, but that the Dissenters in
<HI>England</HI> would <HI>gladly come into</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and become one Body with them again, and ought to
do so, would they abate, alter, or remove all those
things in which they differ from them, which do not
appear warranted by the Word of God.</P>
<P>This being laid down, it will follow.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That a simple offer of complying with the Church,
can be no matter of Charge against the Dissen∣ters,
if the Conditions on which they offer it are
thus qualified.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Those that have offered more, are not to be ju∣stified,
nor shall not by me; and those that have
not, ought not to be condemned for the Mistakes
of their Brethren, and a just Distinction shall be
the Work before me.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I come then to speak to the Matter of Fact, as some
have alledged it, that the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have
made Offers to conform to the Church of <HI>England</HI>—;
<HI>I readily grant it is true,</HI> and I think I may as readi∣ly
grant all that has been said upon that Head, which
amounts to this, and no more, That some of the Dis∣senting
Ministers at the Conference at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and
before at <HI>Breda,</HI> willing, if possible, to avoid a Breach,
and keep the Office of their Ministry, did offer to
submit to a moderate Episcopacy, or as the King him∣self
call'd it, <HI>owned the Essence of Episcopacy.</HI></P>
<P>I'll grant, that the latitude of some of their Princi∣ples,
and the particular extensive Charity of others, and
the Circumstances of the whole at that time, carryed
them farther than would consist with the Presbyterian
Parity now insisted on by both Churches.</P>
<P>Nay, I'll grant more than is asked, <HI>and I perceive,
more than some People desire I should grant,</HI> viz. That
they went farther than themselves, when they saw far∣ther
into it, would afterwards agree to, and a great
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
deal more than others of their Brethren, even, at that
time, would comply with.</P>
<P>But I make no question to prove here, that there
can be no just Argument drawn from hence, to prove
that the Dissenters now in <HI>England,</HI> should be charged
with the same Complyance, or distrusted on the Ac∣count
of what then past—. But on the contrary, that
there are very good Demonstrations to prove they
would by no means comply with any such thing; and
that the dissenting in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is on the
same Foundation with one another, and no other.</P>
<P>The Debate therefore of the Complyance in 1661, I
take to be at an end here; <HI>Because I grant all that can
be alledged on that head,</HI> I neither Justifie nor approve
the Concessions offered, tho at the same time the other
Party alledged they were no Concessions at all, but
what were destructive to Episcopacy, and, as they
call'd it, a Plot against it.</P>
<P>I must own, I think, That suppose the Comply∣ance
of those Men as sinful as we please, they were
Great and Good Men, they are dead, and gone to their
Rest, and their Works follow them; their Labours
remain standing Monuments of their Worth and Excellence,
and seem to merit that their Infirmities
should be buried in the Grave with them.</P>
<P>Let any Minister in <HI>Britain</HI> first make it appear,
that he has been blest with being made the Instrument
of the Conversion, restoring and comforting as many
Souls, as Mr. <HI>Baxters Call to the Unconverted,</HI> his <HI>Saints
everlasting Rest,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hows Blessedness of the Righte∣ous,</HI>
and he shall pass with me for the greatest Blessing
of his kind, that God has left us in this Day.</P>
<P>Works of this Value deserve their Savour in the
Hearts of all good Christians, and if some Opinions of
these Men do not agree with ours; yet Charity ought
to restrain our Censures of such Men, as God has made
eminently useful in his Church, at least let us abstract
the Good, and let the Bad sleep, that what we Dislike
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
may not prejudge the Minds of those who may receive
Good from the other.</P>
<P>This I think is a Christian way of dealing with
them, and they that reflect most upon their own miscar∣riages
and failings will be aptest to allow for other
people, the rest is all cavil and indecent.</P>
<P>Having yielded thus to the utmost, I am now to
prove that the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> are not of the same
Mind now, and would on no account go the same
length, the Consequence of which will be plain, that they
are not to be Censur'd or distrusted for what was then
done.</P>
<P>I confess my Absence from Books and Vouchers in
<HI>England,</HI> deprives me of some Helps; but I must
work with such Tools as I have; and tho my perfor∣mance
may not be so perfect as otherwise it would
be; yet I hope it shall be convincing, and any mode∣rate
Person will allow for the Disadvantage of meer
Memory.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I have living Testimony now in this place,
who have heard most, if not all the Dissenting Mini∣sters
of <HI>England</HI> that have been here, declare in their
own Names, and on account of their Brethren in
<HI>England,</HI> that it is the general Opinion of the Dissen∣ters
in <HI>England,</HI> That if the Church of <HI>England</HI> would
abate their whole Liturgy, Habits, Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
yet that they could not conform meerly on account of
Episcopacy; and if it shall be of any weight to add my
own Testimony, I declare I have heard them univer∣sally
profess the same thing in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to come farther, lets take the Testimony of their
Enemies, which is no ill way of coming at a charge;
the Author of the <HI>Regale and Pontificate,</HI> an Eminent
Advocate for the Episcopal Hierarchy in <HI>England,</HI>
charging the Dissenters with their rejecting all offers of
Complyance made from the Church, concludes thus,
<HI>'tis impossible that any Union can be made between the
Church and them; because they refuse the REGALE</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
and <HI>PONTIFICATE,</HI> and on this he charges them with
<HI>incurable Schism.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Wolff stript,</HI> one of this Countrey
Men, and a great Schollar, inviting, or rather chal∣lenging
the Dissenters to the stating their Scruples be∣fore
the Convocation, in order to a Reconciliation, has
these words—. <HI>We should have little Quarrel with
the Dissenters about all the Objections they make as to
Habit, Ceremonies, Liturgy, and even the grand Point of
Ordination by Presbyters, if it was not for their Schism,
and gathering separate Congregations, in Opposition to the
true Episcopal Authority of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>Here's Liturgy, Ceremonies, Habits, and almost e∣very
thing sacrifiz'd to the Dissenters, BUT EPIS∣COPACY,
and why did they not accept the Chal∣lenge;
but because the <HI>Main and Material thing</HI> was
behind, without which there could be no Complyance,
<HI>viz.</HI> Episcopal Hierarchy.</P>
<P>What is the Complyance of Mr. <HI>Baxter, &amp;c.</HI> to
these things? what was then done, is near 50 Years ago,
and the State of things is somewhat altered since that
time; for 'tis otherways now.</P>
<P>And here I think it will be proper to remind the
Dissenters Enemies, or those that <HI>distrust them</HI> on this
account, with that many headed Monster call'd A
COMPREHENSION, which some People—, <HI>in the
abundance of their Ignorance,</HI> have charg'd the Dissen∣ters
with contriving.</P>
<P>I believe the Challenge may very modestly be made
in the Name of all the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> to any Man,
to prove that a Comprehension had ever its Rise a∣mong
them, or that any Dissenter ever closed with it.</P>
<P>I know Bishop <HI>Usher</HI>'s <HI>Model</HI> was the famous Founda∣tion,
and several Dissenters, I believe, at that time,
might have come into that.</P>
<P>But even that Model was far from <HI>a Comprehension,</HI>
and when ever the Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omprehension came to be
considered, and brought down to <HI>the Edge of Practice,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
it was always found impracticable, and therefore the
aforesaid Author of the <HI>Regale and Pontificate</HI> declares
an Union between the Church and the Dissenters im∣possible;
because the Dissenters will not come up to E∣piscopacy.</P>
<P>I know some People are foreward to tell us there is
a project in <HI>England</HI> now, of making Abatements to
the Dissenters to bring them in, I shall give a short an∣swer
to it, if it be to take away the <HI>Regale</HI> and <HI>Ponti∣ficate,</HI>
they will accept it, for that is not coming in
to the Church, but receiving the Church in to us; if it
be only as formerly, to abate Rigorous Exacting of
Conformity, I pledge the Value of all I have said u∣pon
it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That 'tis a high Church Project.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Dissenters reject it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now, I would fain ask those Gentlemen that fear
the Dissenters and the Church of <HI>England</HI> should unite,
who of the Church, the Dissenters should be most like∣ly
to join with, <HI>the High Church</HI> or <HI>the Low Church;</HI>
the Low Church-men do not seek it, for they are wil∣ling
to give the Dissenters all the Liberty and Tole∣ration
they desire, knowing they cannot come in; as
to the high Church, I believe no body will suspect the
Dissenters of coming over to them.</P>
<P>But here's another Question will be harder to decide
still; How comes it to pass, that the High-Church
Men quarrel the Low-Church-Men on this Head, and
charge them with shifting the Cause of the Schism off
from themselves, telling them, they are not so willing
to yield in indifferent things to the Dissenters, as
they are; to prove this the same Author quoted before,
inviting the Dissenters to offer their Demands to the
Convocation, and telling them indifferent things will be
given up to them, has these words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And if they will do this, it will soon appear whe∣ther
the High or Low Church will go farthest to pur∣chase
the desir'd Reconciliation, and which of them
do in most earnest wish for it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<Q REND="inline">'Next says the same Author, Let those of the
Low Church, who make such Boasts of their Project for
Reconciliation, produce the Terms of it, that it may
appear they were none but indifferent things that were
to be given up, otherways let them too, cease their rail∣ing
at the High Church Men for suspecting them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The High Church desire that they and the Low
Ohurch may be tryed by their Actions—</Q>, thus you
see an Alternative, the Low Church are suspected by
the High Church of giving up all, or giving up none,
and Comprehensions, Abatements, <HI>&amp;c</HI> are all offe∣red
on the High Church Mens side.</P>
<P>The Reason is plain, they see an effectual Gate,
to the Ruine of the Dissenters in making Division a∣mong
them, by yielding in part—, but are mortally
averse to giving up the Substantial and effectual Arti∣cles,
which once removed, would bring an Universal
Conjunction.</P>
<P>If I am ask't here in General, whether we would on
any terms joyn at all with them. I answer. and be∣lieve
all good Christians will answer, <HI>Yes, with all our
Hearts</HI>—, and so will the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> too.</P>
<P>And as 'tis natural to say in the next Question, What
are the Conditions, Truely such as on the Foundation
of which, we would all join with the Papists, or any
Church in the World, and I hope, no body will take
Offence at the General way of expressing it; for 'tis not
stepping foreward, but receiving those that step for∣ward
to us.</P>
<P>If any Christian Church will abate what is either in
their Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline, not warranted
by the Word of God, I'll readily say, we shall all join
with that Church. <HI>But to come to Particulars,</HI> as this is
not the first time that Question has been ask't and an∣swer'd,
I'll give five Heads which have been offered
to the Church in this Case by the Dissenters, and on
which, I believe; the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dissenters, should soon be one
united Body, and these are long since made publick
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
in several Tracts, particularly in an Answer to the
High Church Challenge printed in the Year 1704.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That as to Liturgies, they may suffer such amend∣ment
and Alterations as are justifiable by Scrip∣ture
and the Practice of the Primitive Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That when they are so amended, they may not be
imposed, or the Minister tyed up, and prescrib'd
by the Letter of the Book, but be at liberty to
enlarge or abridge as his own abilities may sup∣ply,
or the Case require.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That Ordination of Ministers be establish't in
the Presbyters, and no re-ordination or unreason∣able
Oaths imposed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That Habits and Ceremonies, such as kneeling
at the Sacrament, bowing at the name of Jesus,
the Cross in Baptism, the Surplice, Vestments,
and all the rest, scrupled by the Dissenters, and
own'd to be indifferent, may be wholly left out,
or left at the Discretion of the People, as that they
may not be imposed upon them without their
Consent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That Church Government be reduced to such a
pitch of Authority, and vested in such Persons as
may be justified by the Scriptures, and no other.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In all these Offers, I do not see the least Tendency
towards a Complyance with any thing, either in Dis∣cipline
or Worship, which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
would not agree to, or that can render the Dissenters
suspected; I do not say these are all the things to be in∣sisted
on, and let no Man take that weak hold by the
Barrenness of Expression to suggest a corrupt Meaning;
but I think there is nothing the Church of <HI>England</HI> can
be ask't, but what is contained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airly in these Generals.</P>
<P>On the Conceding therefore these five Heads, the
Dissenters, yea, and the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> too, might
very easily close with the General Union, and become
one great Protestant, and purely reformed Church,
for it would be one Presbyterian Church.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Upon the whole, the Matter of Fact I think is plain,
that the grand Difference between the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and the Dissenters, at this time, is just the same
as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and no other, I mean Church Govern∣ment,
or, in the High Church Language, <HI>the Regale
and Pontificate,</HI> and all the Dispute in both may be
said to turn upon two Points.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Episcopal Hierarchy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Supremacy of the Civil Magistrate, or his
Power to Impose Indifferent Things, and thereby to
make them necessary.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is the Sum of the Matter, and most of it lyes in
the first Head too; For, were the Hierarchy reduced,
'tis plain, the Church would soon give up the rest:
And, as the Author before Quoted observes, <HI>Would
have little Dispute about Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgies
and Ordination;</HI> They are indeed but the Pomp and
Jingle of the other, and the Scripture Rule would soon
reduce them to Primitive Plainness.</P>
<P>I know the Nicety of the Subject I am writing up∣on,
and the want of Charity with which some will
read, and this forces me to frequent and otherwise
needless Excursions.</P>
<P>I hope I retain an Air of Integrity in my Meaning,
and for Misconstructions, <HI>especially wilful ones,</HI> I despise
them: I see nothing in my Discourse, that should
make me be suspected of being Episcopally inclin'd—Tho
I cannot be for Sealing all that are of an Episcopal
Church to Reprobation.—Nor Treating them as
Antichristian: I believe the Hierarchy Unscriptural,
and enter my publick Protest against both <HI>Regale</HI> and
<HI>Ponitificate.</HI>—And I think this is as much as any
Christian can be requir'd.—But I cannot call the
Church of <HI>England</HI> Antichristian, because neither <HI>Re∣gale</HI>
or <HI>Pontificate</HI> are Essentials of Doctrine, and when
ever they shall be quitted by them, they are from
that time the same individual Reform'd Presbyterian
Church with this in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Some have taken pains to prove, that the Dissenters
in <HI>England, I desire to be understood of the Dissenters,
the Presbyterian Dissenters, except where I explain it o∣therways,</HI>
declare themselves <HI>now</HI> for moderate Epis∣copacy—. But this can never be prov'd upon them;
Nor does Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI> any where suggest i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that I re∣member,
if he says <HI>No Body Questioned the Lawfulness
of it at the Conference at the Savoy,</HI> it does not amount
to a Proof, that they allowed the Lawfulness of
it, much less that they do so now.</P>
<P>But then I find 'tis objected, That they Sign the
37<HI>th</HI> Article of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which Recog∣nizes
the <HI>Regale,</HI> or Power of the Civil Authority:
But he that Quotes the Words of that Article, and
leaves out the Explanation with which they Sign it,
does not Act the most candid part of a Reconciler,
nor Treat them fairly.</P>
<P>'Tis known, That the Explication is made part of
that Article, and with that Explication the Dissenters
are satisfied; and satisfied, that they do not own the
Supremacy of the Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Mat∣ters,
<HI>farther than all the Protestant Churches in</HI> Europe <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> this cannot be brought as a single Argument
to distrust the Presbyterian Dissenters, <HI>if it be any
Proof at all, 'tis against the whole Body;</HI> For even
the Anabaptists Sign that Article, as well as the Presby∣terians,
and no Man ever suspected them of owning the
Supremacy.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly, And which is more than all the rest,</HI> the Church
her self is come off from the <HI>Regale</HI> in General, and the
Oath of Supremacy formerly imposed was one of the
first things left out of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution at the Re∣volution,
the Act for it repealed, and has never been
imposed upon any Bo-dy since.</P>
<P>So that I think no Complyance can be charg'd on
the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> upon that Foundation.</P>
<P>I have met with but one thing more, in which the
Dissenters are attack't, relating to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
is, that they set up for a Toleration of Dissenters
there.</P>
<P>I must own, I have not the same formidable Opi∣nion
of a Toleration here, as some Gentlemen have:
And as to the Episcopal Dissenters here, I firmly be∣lieve,
'tis the true method to dissolve and reduce them
to nothing, of which hereafter <HI>but this is nothing to
the case;</HI> For I see no Proof, that the Dissenters in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
have, one way or other, concern'd themselves in
it: And therefore, if any Man charges them on that
Head, it ought to be prov'd; For to say 'tis so, <HI>as
far as we know,</HI> is only to make it appear, we know but
little or nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>But to offer at something relating to their Principles
in that case, <HI>it may be noted,</HI> 1. that when Essays at
Universal Toleration have been made in <HI>England,</HI> the
Dissenters have always opposed them; particularly as
in taking off the Penal Laws against Papists, when they
chose rather to bear the Unreasonable Burden of those
Laws themselves, than to tolerate what was destructive
to the General Constitution of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>2. Another later Instance is, in a Famous Letter lately
written by Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> to the respective Heads of the
Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> pressing them to declare their
Opinions of the Universal Liberty of Christians, and
the Toleration of all Opinions <HI>meerly Religious:</HI> The
Original of which Letter I have here with me, <HI>for it
was never printed,</HI> and shall freely show to any Body
that desires it.</P>
<P>Upon this Application, back't with Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI>
and several others—the Dissenters meeting and
consulting about it, unanimously resolved, not to give
any Answer at all to it, or to make any Declaration
of their Opinion on that Head—. Now if they
have thus refused to declare their Opinion in <HI>England</HI>
where accepting Toleration themselves, 'tis most like∣ly
they should be for giving it to others, 'tis very un∣likely
they should officiously declare themselves for it
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have nothing at all to do
with it.</P>
<P>However to such Objectors I refer them to my Opi∣nion
of that Matter stated in the Preface to <HI>Jure Di∣vino,</HI>
now to be seen in this Town, and which I shall
take the Freedom to appeal to.</P>
<P>I think therefore they are free from any of the Re∣proaches
thrown on them on that score.</P>
<P>I find but one thing more objected against them
and that is about their prompting the Dispensing
Power of the late King in <HI>England,</HI> by their Addresses
of Thanks for an Illegal Indulgence.</P>
<P>This has been directly answer'd already, and is
briefly sum'd up thus,
<Q>Some few Dissenters did Address and Thank
the King for their Liberty, which, <HI>tho' I do
not, nor ever did approve, because that Liber∣ty
was their Native Right,</HI> yet as Ignorance,
Good Manners, and Wilingness to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ultivate
the Benefit which they had many Ages
mourn'd for want of, moved some, and the
prevailing Arts of Court Flatteries others, yet
none of those Addresses being a real owning
the Dispensing Power, they cannot be di∣rectly
charged. And it was plain, they
were not design'd as such by the Addressers,
since, as soon as they discover'd the Fraud,
they all started back, and acknowledg'd the
Mistake.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nor can it be argued, as is weakly insinuated,</HI> That
Thanking him for an Indulgence, is a Thanking him for
a Dispensing Power, as that Indulgence was a breaking
in upon the Laws by a Dispensing Power, <HI>because the one
was apparent, the other concealed.</HI></P>
<P>That some were drawn in I owne, <HI>but to what?</HI>—To
Thank the King—Well, <HI>what did they Thank him
for?</HI>—For what was <HI>THE EFFECT</HI> of a Dis∣pensing
Power. <HI>Note again,</HI> not for the Dispensing
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
Power it self, for they did not foresee it—. The <HI>HOOK</HI>
Tyranny, was cover'd with the <HI>BAIT</HI> Liberty, <HI>as
in all Ages of the World it has been</HI>—. And 'tis Dis∣ingenuous
to charge that Ignorance as a Sin against
Knowlege, and the more so, because as soon as their
Eyes were opened, they corrected the Mistake.</P>
<P>Suppose a Man, with a Villainous Design to Mur∣der
me, makes me a Present of a Poisoned Nosegay,
I accept his Present, and ignorantly Thank him for
it—. But I Thank him for the Flowers, I do not
Thank him for the Poison; But, as soon as I discover
the Treachery, I throw away the Gift, and prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
the Murderer.</P>
<P>Again, these People that were thus drawn in, were
but a few, not One to Twenty, <HI>some say,</HI> not One
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fifty, and to charge this on the whole Body, looks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
if the Enemy had a great Barrenness of Fact, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
wants Charity more than it wants Malice.</P>
<P>But I am told very Scholastically, That speaking
indefinitly does not imply the whole, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>THE DISSENTERS</HI> may mean but a few, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cause in School Logic, <HI>an Indefinite in a Matter Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦gent is taken but for a part.</HI></P>
<P>I forbear any Reflection on the Sophistry of this,
the Case before us is too honest to need such Equivo∣cations,
and plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reason with the help of Fact will
clear it up all.</P>
<P>If, to say <HI>THE</HI> Dissenters <HI>did so,</HI> may signifie <HI>but
some of them,</HI> then, if ten Dissenters did it, it may be
said, <HI>The Dissenters</HI> did it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, by the same Rule, if ten th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦sand
did not do it, it may be as truly said, <HI>The Dissen∣ters</HI>
did not do it.</P>
<P>So by this blessed sort of School Reasoning, it may
be true, and very proper to say, the Dissenters <HI>did it,</HI>
and the Dissenters <HI>did not do it,</HI> both at the same time.</P>
<P>This is the Art of Reasoning which I confess my self
untaught in and when I handle a Cause that wants it,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
I'll go to School to learn it, but I thank GOD I am
defending a Cause and a People, who want nothing
but Truth in the plainest Dress to defend them, and
a plain Fellow is therefore the fitter to plead for
them.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Christian, it makes his
Life all of a piece with his Profession, this is the Glo∣ry
of the Cause of the Dissenters, which is like the
People, plain and sincere, if they have slipt in any
thing, <HI>Humanum est Errare,</HI> but they have fallen like
Christians to rise again: And what People in the World
has done it less? in Thirty Years Oppression, they have
stood their Ground, they have upheld the Justice of
their Non-conformity, till tyred with persecuting
them, the very Church that opposed them has yielded
to Truth, and complyed with their most reasonable
Demands.</P>
<P>To charge the Body for the Mistake of a few, is unjust
and unfair, and yet I dare say, that the Fact is not
right neither, <HI>viz. That they really own'd the Dispen∣sing
Power in any one Address,</HI> or any other way coun∣tenanc'd
it than tacitly, and by consequence without
Design</P>
<P>I could say a great deal to defend their General Be∣haviour
towards the Church.</P>
<P>They have always behaved decently and respectful∣ly,
as to a Body of <HI>Fellow Christians,</HI> with whom, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
they cannot Conform to their Ecclesiastical Constitution,</HI>
they desir'd no Difference in Matters Civil and Neigh∣bourly,
I cannot think any Body will censure them for
this—.</P>
<P>They have defended themselves <HI>against their Argu∣ment,</HI>
but not against their Persons, they have kept
their Consciences, but submitted <HI>every thing else</HI> to
the Civil Government: Nay, they have gone further,
they have not only acquiesc'd in the Civil Government
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Magistracy, but, on all oc∣casions,
when Popery and Tyranny have invaded the
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
Church of <HI>England,</HI> they have joyn'd with them <HI>as
their Brethren,</HI> and as Persons embark'd in the same
Bottom with them, both as to Civil and Religious In∣terests.</P>
<P>When the late King <HI>Caress'd the Dissenters,</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
he used all possible Artifice to draw them in to
side with him against the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he found
it impossible; But the Church of <HI>England being the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommission Court,</HI> and several Gentlemen applying to
the Dissenters to joyn in calling over <HI>the Prince of
Orange,</HI> they readily laid aside all their Resentments
at their former ill Usage, and not distinguishing the

<P>If any Man will undertake to censure the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>
of the Dissenters in this Case, and say, they Acted
with less Policy than Charity, or with more <HI>Good Na∣ture</HI>
than <HI>Discretion,</HI> I must desire them to remember,
the Dissenters and the Church in <HI>England</HI> ought to be
considered in several and separate Capacities.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>As a Nation,</HI> and respecting their Civil Policy as
<HI>English-Men,</HI> they stand all upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Foundation, <HI>viz. Of Law,
Liberty</HI> and <HI>Rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/></HI> when ever they separate, they are both
de∣stroy'd and both undone, and therefore, when ever the Dispute comes to
be <HI>between</HI> Liber∣ty and Tyranny, <HI>between</HI> Law and
Dispen∣sing Power, Property and Arbitrary Govern∣ment, the Church of
<HI>England</HI> and Dissenter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were <HI>ever together,</HI> as one Body of
<HI>Free-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> English-Men,</HI> United in Opposition to Slavery 
<PB N="39" REF="38"/> and Bondage, and they must both have been distracted,
if it had been otherwise.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>As Protestants,</HI> respecting Reformation in general, they
are still one United Body of Christians, in Doctrine, Charity and
Interest the same, and therefore, when ever the Dispute comes to be
<HI>between</HI> the Papist and the Protestant, <HI>between</HI> Idolatry
and true Worship, <HI>between</HI> the Purity of Religion and the
<HI>Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</HI> they are still one
Body of Prote∣stants, Detesting and Renouncing the Errors of <HI>Rome,</HI>
Espousing heartily the true Refor∣mation, and Professing together the
same <HI>Lord JESUS.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But if you respect them as <HI>Particular Church∣es,</HI> then
indeed you find them differing in Judgement and Opinion about the
Circum∣stantials of Religion, such as <HI>Habits, Cere∣monies,
Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline;</HI> yet this Dif∣ference, as it is not
essential to Religion; so it does not, or, at least, ought not to
break in upon their Mutual Charity, or National Interest; much less upon
their Civility and good Manners, and therefore all <HI>Revilings</HI> and
<HI>Reproaches</HI> are to be carefully avoided between the Lovers of Peace on
both sides, and 'tis what the Dissenters have always pleaded for,
<HI>having suffered most by that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣sage;</HI> and I hope, shall be the
last that re∣turn upon the Church, what they have so long complained
of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In speaking of them <HI>as regarding the Church of Scotland,</HI>
this Distinction also ought to be made, <HI>viz.</HI> That the
Dissenters were once a part of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and have
<HI>only separated from them</HI> for Purity of Wor∣ship, Church
Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis there∣fore <PB N="40" REF="39"/> quite another
thing for them, to desire to be restored to their National Union, than for
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who never were a part of their Body; And
since yet they do not offer to comply, but on Terms justi∣fyable by the
Word of GOD, there remains no Censure due to them, <HI>but such as do blame
them,</HI> show their want of Judgment and want of Charity both together; Nor
is it any sufficient Exception, to say they <HI>did not declare against
the Compliances of any,</HI> since they have always in Practice done it, and
'tis known they have no Power of Cen∣sure—.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thro' infinit Persecutions, Fines, Jails, and harras∣sing
of several kinds, they are <HI>at last</HI> arrived to a le∣gal
Liberty, a true Foundation Right which is called
<HI>a Toleration;</HI> on this Foot they now stand.</P>
<P>On all Occasions they have declar'd they cannot
comply with the Church in the Article of Bishops—,
<HI>Comprehensions</HI> have been projected; but they <HI>have al∣ways
been concluded</HI> impracticable, and the Presbyte∣rian
declares himself not able to conform.</P>
<P>Their Difference are <HI>meerly consciencious,</HI> they have
suffered all Severities for their Consciences, and can∣nor
without great want of Charity, <HI>be distrusted</HI> or suspected
as Episcopally inclined.</P>

<P>IT remains to say someting here to the present Cir∣cumstances

<P>I cannot but think every Obstruction to this Do∣ctrine,

<P>It cannot but be <HI>out of Season,</HI> to talk of the sinful∣ness

<P>It cannot but <HI>be out of Season</HI> to rip up the Follies
and Mistakes of Men who are dead, and cannot answer

Patterns deserve better Treatment.</P>
<P>It cannot but <HI>be out of Season,</HI> to Preach up distrust
between a Society of Brethren at a time, when they

<P>It cannot but <HI>be out of Season,</HI> to fill the Heads of the

Divisions, where General Charity, and mutual Assi∣stance

<P>In the present Circumstances of these Kingdoms, I
know nothing so essential to the Felicity of both, as mu∣tual
Confidence in, and Affection to one another.</P>
<P>The want of this is the only thing that can make all

either side can apprehend.</P>
<P>'Twill defeat all the Endeavours either side can ex∣ert,
to convince one another of their Sincerity; every

from Encroachments Abroad? If we cannot trust
one another.</P>
<P>'Tis mutual Distrust has kept these Nations so long
divided, and been the Occasion of such Seas of Blood
being shed between them; all the widowed Families,
the helpless Orphans, the distrest Provinces in either
Kingdom, for these 300 Years bypast, have been prin∣cipally
produc'd by this Monster—. This Child of
Hell has been in every Mischief, in every Plot, in e∣very
War between the two Nations.</P>
<P>To destroy this Devil, this present Union is con∣trived;
'tis for this all the Councils of both Kingdoms
have been imployed; 'Tis to prevent this all the Ene∣mies
of our Peace have struggled: And if after all the
Hazards run, all the Tumults, Rabbles and Mischiefs
threatned, all the Endeavours of the Queen and her
wisest Counsellors, <HI>this part should not be obtained,</HI> all
the Attempts of a politick Union will be in vain.</P>
<P>What shall we say to an Endeavour <HI>after an Union,
is as it were concluded between the Nations,</HI> to render the
best People in both Nations, and perhaps in the World
suspected to one another—. Shall I, thro' Favour, or
Fear of Reproach, say '<HI>tis Honest,</HI> or <HI>Fair,</HI> or <HI>Christian,</HI>
or <HI>Seasonable:</HI> God forbid I should dare to approve,
what the Scripture says himself hates, <HI>Prov.</HI> 6. 19.
<HI>Him that soweth Discord among Brethren.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the Church of</HI> Scotland, If the Dissenters
in <HI>England</HI> are not to be trusted; whither will ye seek?
what shall your Temporal Peace depend upon? what up∣holds
the Interest of Religion in <HI>Britain;</HI> but that Glori∣ous
Body of Protestants, that from a few Years of the
first Reformation, have been dayly Confessors for that
Purity of Worship, which they always profest, and <HI>which
you enjoy?</HI></P>
<P>Why should they be distrusted that never abandon'd
their Cause, that never deserted the strong Foundati∣on
of Truth and Liberty, that have defended it, and
are at last built upon it <HI>in common with your selves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
The Laws of <HI>Britain</HI> are their Safety now, and yours
also; the Civil Capacity is the Foundation Security
now of your Religious Capacity; <HI>Magna charta</HI> is yours
by the Union <HI>as well as theirs;</HI> the Great Liberties
of <HI>England</HI> are now laid open in common with you—, a
Foundation <HI>so</HI> strong, <HI>so</HI> certain, <HI>so</HI> sure, that should
the greatest Monarchs that ever reign'd in <HI>Britain</HI> in∣vade
it, <HI>even the Persecutors themselves</HI> would join with
you, to pull them down.</P>
<P>You are all built upon Law and Liberty, that is the
Rock that supports you all, and you have now nothing
to do, but <HI>like your Stones in an Arch,</HI> by shouldering up
one another, make your Strength invincible; thus united
like the same Arch, the more weight is laid on you, the
stronger you grow; but dislocate one Stone only, and
it falls by its own weight, into a heap of meer Rubbish
and Disorder.</P>
<P>Suffer a Stranger to exhort you to what your
own Interest ought to guide you to, and to what your
Experience will bless him for hereafter, <HI>unless by your
unbelief, your Careasses fall in this wilderness of Strife,</HI>
and if that should happen, your Posterity will acknow∣ledge
it.</P>
<P>Study Peace, Study to be Quiet, and mark such as
sow Divisions among you—; for where there is
Strife and Contention, there is Every evil Work.</P>
<P>For my self, I shall say little, I have quitted the just
Resentment at unsufferable Insolencies, that I might
with the utmost Calmness of Mind, move <HI>Scotland</HI> to
Peace, and practise the thing I exhort to—; the Gen∣tleman
that opposes me in this, shall not rally me on∣ly
in Print, but he shall trample me under his Feet;
I am content to be all that is contemptible and vile in
his Eyes, and in every Mans else, if I can but be in∣strumental
in the least to this blessed healing Tem∣per.</P>
<P>I
can hear him and his Platterers go about defaming
my Morals to lessen my Argument, reproaching
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
the Man, to weaken his Discourse, a certain Token of
the sterility of better Answers—. It moves me not—.
It shall all be in vain—. Slander and Backbiting
shall do me no Injury—. I have been an open Re∣prover
of other Mens Vices at the extremest Hazard—.
<HI>If my own Practice had been scandalous,</HI> as these Men
suggest, I should, long since, have had it Printed in
my Forehead; for this is not the first time it has been
attempted. I am sorry they force me to say any thing
in my own Defence, <HI>a most insignificant Triffle to what
I am upon:</HI> But as 'tis done with a Design to lessen the
Esteem of what I say in this Cause, I am oblig'd to
speak. They report me a Drunkard, a Swearer, a
Sabbath-breaker, and what not—. Impotent Slan∣ders!
what Shift is Malice driven to? The Issue is short
and plain, and their Honesty shall be tryed by
it. I challenge them to bring the Man either
here, or in <HI>England,</HI> that ever saw me drink to Excess,
that ever heard me swear; or in short, can charge my
Conversation with the least Vice or Immorality, with
Indecency, Immodesty, Passion, Prophaneness, or a∣ny
thing else that deserves Reproach; when they can
do this, I'll burn this Book at the Mercat Cross, and
desire all the World to regard no more what I say, and
till they can do it, all Honest Men will abhor the Pra∣ctice.</P>
<P>'Tis
hard, Gentlemen, to force any Man to say
thus much of his own Character, and so far, as it looks
like Ostentation, I ask Pardon for it; I am far from
valuing my self upon negative Vertue; yet I thank
God that I am able to say thus much, and thought my
self oblig'd to convince the World how they are im∣posed
upon, and how a Stranger is treated here; and
I beg the Gentlemen that use me thus, not to oblige me
to recriminate upon their Morals, which I could do
with too much Advantage.</P>
<P>It wounds every Honest Man to the Soul, to see a
Spirit of Bitterness and Slander gone out among you,
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
biting and devouring, and distrusting one another, at a
time, and in a very Debate of National Union.</P>
<P>I verily believe God in his Providence has determi∣ned
the Blessed Union of these two Nations; I foresee
all the Malice of Hell cannot oppose it; the strange
concurrence of Circumstances points out the Finger of
Providence in every Point of it, 'thas been made up
of Miracle, and unaccountable Junctures in its Periods.
I beseech you Gentlemen, let not your unbelieving
rob you of the Blessing of it, and adjourn the Comforts
so, that like the Elders at <HI>Samaria,</HI> you should see it,
but not taste of it.</P>
<P>I see nothing objected but Chimeras, Maybe's, supposes,
Suggestions—, what-ifs, and the like; one convin∣cing
Demonstration of the sincerity of your Brethren <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>England</HI> will crush them all, and how will you be a∣sham'd
of your Suspicions and Jealousies, how will you
regret the unkind Treatment of your Friends, who
will thus requit you Good for Evil, and heap Coals of
Fire on your Heads,</P>
<P>If you would compare the certain Evils you have a∣voided
by it, with the suggested Evils that they say
are in prospect, there can be no rational Comparison
drawn, Jacobitism. Popish Succession, <HI>French</HI> Tyran∣ny,
Popery and War—, these are avoided, and must
have followed, what can there be before you to equal
these.</P>
<P>If therefore you have any regard to Justice, to Truth,
to your Interest, to your Religion, Liberty or Poste∣rity,
calm your Minds, and fortify your Souls with
peaceable Ideas, leave Jealousies and Suspicions to ly
asleep in the misty heads of the Ignorant; For distrust
is the Product of a Barren Understanding, if your Eyes
are open, you cannot but see your Safety and Prospe∣rity
in an hearty Affection, an Union of Love, an U∣nion
of Intrests, and an Union of Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>
Without it, all's an empty Shadow, and must in
time tend either to the Ruine of the General Peace, or
of the particular opposers of it.</P>
<P>My Friends tell me I lay my self too low in this and
that the Adverse Party have Ingenuity little enough to
insult me upon this head; indeed I find little Ingenui∣ty
enough in the Party: But when I consider who they
are, how mean in Character, how seandalously few in
Number, how empty their Malice, and how ridicu∣lous
their Methods with me, 'tis a compleat Satisfacti∣on,
and I am perfectly unconcern'd for the rest.</P>
<P>Most of the Persons, whose ill treatment I complain
of are realy contemptible in every part of them; their
Principles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are opposite to mine, are so to all Ho∣nest
Men, their Reproaches I value not enough to grati∣fie
so much as their meanest Expectations; for with me it
shall ever be calm without, when it is clear within;
and for just Matters of Scandal, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airly defyed
them.</P>
<P>As they are Enemies to God, so they are to the Go∣vernment,
to the Reformation; and to Good Men,
and by Consequence to the Union, which is plainly the
Work of the first, and the desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the last, and it is
the Glory of her Majesties Government, that it aims
at nothing but what concurrs both with the Glory of
one, and the Wishes of the other, I mean Piery and Peace.</P>
<P>If there was any thing else in the Design, I bless
God, I was never a Slave to any Government in the
World; I was never frighted by Power, when I was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and I could never be brib'd by its
Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, when in the most proper circumstances to want
them, I would not write a word, no, nor for the
Queen her self, if my Conference and Principles did
not say Amen to the Subject; and I challenge the
World to say, when ever I acted otherwise.</P>
<P>The Party therefore in nothing more mistake me,
than in thinking, that when, for Peace sake, I avoid
Reflecting on their Follies, 'tis for any Value or Fear
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
of their Resentment, they must be little acquainted
with the Scenes I have acted in the World, who know
me no better than that, and I refer them to the Re∣sentments
of Men much more Capital than their Am∣bitious
Thoughts can pretend to, and let them see the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Influence their Anger has had on me.</P>
<P>But all this Humility of mine is for the sake of a
few, <HI>a very few indeed,</HI> who, tho' Passion and Prejudice
may over-rule them; and run them to Inconvenien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>,
tho' they may go a little out of themselves, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

that fatal Principle that would ruine us all, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Tenderness to their Characters and Office, <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
other Account,</HI> I behave calmly and carefully to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
hoping, that in due time, they shall be bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r inform¦ed,
and then, I doubt not, they will do me Justice—</P>
<P>For the rest, their Principles are Abominable, their
Ways of Propagating them are Unchristian and Irra¦tional,
their Methods are Detested by all honest Men,
and to me they merit the utmost Contempt.</P>
<P>Very few also are the Number of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ceiv'd
Proselites they have made, not one in twenty,
even of the Ministers that I have known, are of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

that I can, <HI>with the utmost Peace,</HI> bear the Reproa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>

<P>May the God of Peace move this Nation to thoughts
