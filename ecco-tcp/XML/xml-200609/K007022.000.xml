<HEAD>ON THE
MARRIAGE
Of His SERENE HIGHNESS the
PRINCE of <HI>ORANGE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>LLustrious Prince, forgive the feeble Lay,</L>
<L>That now aspires to hail your Nuptial-day;</L>
<L>Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Muse, the meanest of the Nine,</L>
<L>Who brings her humble Off'ring to your Shrine.</L>
<L>And You Imperial Nymph, whose lovely Face</L>
<L>Invites the Hero to your chaste Embrace,</L>
<L>Vouchsafe a Spark of your Coelestial Fire,</L>
<L>Harmonious Words, and pleasing Thoughts inspire,</L>
<L>Soft as your Love, and tuneful as your Lyre;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
So shall my Numbers charm the list'ning Ear,</L>
<L>And ev'n the glad NASSAU delighted hear.</L>
<L>NASSAU has long enrich'd the Book of Fame.</L>
<L>And ANNA now adorns the Noble Name.</L>
<L>Nations who saw the Light of ORANGE rise,</L>
<L>With awful Splendor, in the <HI>Belgian</HI> Skies;</L>
<L>Shall soon behold it with new Lustre shine,</L>
<L>Join'd to a glorious Star of BRUNSWICK's Line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So where the flowing <HI>Sambre</HI> gently glides,</L>
<L>The Swain delights to view the beauteous Tides;</L>
<L>But when his more-extended Eye surveys</L>
<L>The shining Torrent join the spacious <HI>Maese,</HI></L>
<L>Both Rivers thus, with friendly Union flow,</L>
<L>And to the Sight superior Beauty show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er the Gods a noble Race intend,</L>
<L>They suit the Causes to their destin'd End:</L>
<L>Nor yoke unequal Hearts in Nuptial Love,</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI>'s valiant Bird disdains the fearful Dove.</L>
<L>Great Minds by native Sympathy combine,</L>
<L>As golden Particles the closest join;</L>
<L>Paternal Virtues in their Bosom roll,</L>
<L>Ally'd in Love by Nobleness of Soul;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Hence, Thrones and Scepters shine neglected Things,</L>
<L>Hence Royal ANN prefers NASSAU to Kings;</L>
<L>While <HI>Britons</HI> with united Hearts rejoice,</L>
<L>And willing Senators applaud the Choice,</L>
<L>To see their King (to Honour ever true)</L>
<L>Discharge the Debt to sacred WILLIAM due.</L>
<L>Immortal WILLIAM! by whose prudent Cares,</L>
<L>We yet enjoy the Fruits of all our Wars;</L>
<L>Our Laws, Religion, Liberty, and Peace,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Blessings of the BRUNSWICK Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor Thou, Illustrious ORANGE, blush to own</L>
<L>Thy Honour, thus ally'd to <HI>Albion</HI>'s Crown;</L>
<L>Blest with a Princess, in whose Form we trace</L>
<L>Her Fathers Majesty, and Mother's Grace:</L>
<L>Bright Orbs of Pow'r, that with propitious Ray,</L>
<L>Dispel our Clouds, and beautify our Day.</L>
<L>Not as the Comet, raging thro' the Air,</L>
<L>Infects the World with Pestilence and War:</L>
<L>But like the Sun, their Beams of Goodness glow,</L>
<L>Inspiring Life, and chearing All below.</L>
<L>Such are the glorious SIRE, and gracious DAME,</L>
<L>From whence the beauteous Bride of ORANGE came.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
And shall unerring Nature change her Kind?</L>
<L>What Lion e'er produc'd a tim'rous Hind?</L>
<L>The Royal Eagles, Royal Eagles breed,</L>
<L>And Heroes from Heroic Sires proceed;</L>
<L><HI>Rome</HI>'s Founder thus, confest his Race Divine;</L>
<L>Thus NASSAU copies the NASSOVIAN Line;</L>
<L>Thus, ANNA's noble Stream of Virtue flows,</L>
<L>High as the Regal Spring from whence it rose.</L>
<L>Thrice happy Nymph, with ev'ry grace supply'd,</L>
<L>Thrice happy Prince, with such a heav'nly Bride;</L>
<L>In whom superior Sense, with Judgment joins,</L>
<L>Her Beauty much, but more her Merit shines.</L>
<L>How glorious! when such Worth adorns the Great,</L>
<L>We hear, we see, admire and imitate,</L>
<L>Virtue in Them, attracts remotest Eyes,</L>
<L>But in the Vulgar Soul unheeded lies.</L>
<L>As radiant <HI>Phoebus</HI> darts superior Light,</L>
<L>While smaller Planets shun the watchful Sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Accomplish'd thus, let her Example fire</L>
<L>The drooping Muse, and wake the sounding Lyre;</L>
<L>To aid Religion be her chiefest Care,</L>
<L>(Heav'n justly claims the Soul it made so fair)</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
To stem the Torrent of licentious Rage,</L>
<L>And prop the Virtues of a sinking Age;</L>
<L>Exalting Science to her ancient Height,</L>
<L>To raise declining Arts, and make the rude Polite.</L>
<L>While Great NASSAU, whom native Glory warms,</L>
<L>Whene'er his Country calls him forth to Arms,</L>
<L>May fire the <HI>Belgians</HI> in the Field of <HI>Mars,</HI></L>
<L>Consult their Peace, or animate their Wars;</L>
<L>Paint his Forefathers to their wond'ring Eye,</L>
<L>And teach 'em how to conquer, or to die;</L>
<L>Like him, who bravely dar'd to break their Chain,</L>
<L>Tho' held by all the Force and Fraud' of <HI>Spain</HI>;</L>
<L>For injur'd Liberty the Sword he draws,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to gain, or perish in the Cause;</L>
<L>And having long the doubtful Combat try'd,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Caesar</HI> vanquish'd, and like <HI>Caesar</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King <HI>William</HI>'s Great Grandfather, the first Great Assertor of the <HI>Belgian</HI>
Liberties, Assassinated at <HI>Delph.</HI></NOTE> dy'd.</L>
<L>Tho' diff'rent far the Motives of their Mind,</L>
<L>That, fought to Conquer, This to Save Mankind;</L>
<L>Till prais'd, lamented, envied, and admir'd,</L>
<L>The Hero, Patriot, and the Prince expir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>Oh! where did then the guardian Angels hide?</L>
<L>Nor watch'd to turn the guilty Ball aside;</L>
<L>When he, whom armed Hosts cou'd not withstand,</L>
<L>Now falls a Victim to one Villain's hand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But rise ye Muses, quit the pensive Lay,</L>
<L>Nor damp the Joys of this auspicious Day,</L>
<L>Since yet the glorious Name of ORANGE stands,</L>
<L>Since Royal ANNA seals the Nuptial-bands,</L>
<L>Soon may Imperial ADOLPHS rise again,</L>
<L>Again new FREDERICKS thunder on the Main,</L>
<L>Rousing the Martial Youth to War's alarms,</L>
<L>(If proud <HI>Ierians</HI> shine again in Arms)</L>
<L>To guard their Country from tyrannic Pow'r,</L>
<L>And be what glorious WILLIAM was before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor shall the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>states invading Forces fear,</L>
<L>'Ere pregnant Time the promis'd Heroes bear;</L>
<L>Nor want Allies their Freedom to defend,</L>
<L>Since BRUNSWICK reigns, and ALBION is their Friend.</L>
<L>As branching Oaks protect the rural Swain,</L>
<L>Secure from Summer-heat, and Winter-rain;</L>
<L>So shall our Monarch, with Paternal Aid,</L>
<L>His Regal Shelter o'er <HI>Batavia</HI> spread,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Long as the Sceptre fills his Royal Hand,</L>
<L>A true <HI>Palladium</HI> shall Insure the Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And if the praescient Muses guide my Lay,</L>
<L>Or, future Secrets, <HI>Phoebus</HI> can display,</L>
<L>The Day shall shine distinguish'd from the rest,</L>
<L>That ANNA dignify'd, and <HI>Hymen</HI> blest;</L>
<L>In which AUGUSTUS fortifies his Throne,</L>
<L>And plans a Scheme of Union for his Son;</L>
<L>Bespeaks Allies for Princes yet to come,</L>
<L>New Friends to <HI>Britain,</HI> and new Foes to <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed Great MONARCH, new Allies to gain,</L>
<L>And with new Nuptial-leagues our Peace maintain;</L>
<L>So shall thy beauteous Nymphs secure with Charms</L>
<L>That safety, other Kings defend with Arms;</L>
<L>They, <HI>Venus</HI> like, cou'd <HI>Mars</HI> himself surprize,</L>
<L>And awe stern Tyrants with their conqu'ring Eyes.</L>
