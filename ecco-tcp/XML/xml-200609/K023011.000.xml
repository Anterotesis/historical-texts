<HEAD>LETTER I. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE little Thing which you take so kindly, is but
a very small Part of what I owe you; and
whatever my Studies, or (to use a properer Word)
Idleness, are capable of producing, ought to be re∣turned
you in mere Gratitude for the Pleasure I have
received from your own Writings: In which give me
Leave to say, your good Will to me in particular, is
as distinguishable, as the Obligation you lay on the
Publick in general. I am very happy in the Envy and
silly Attacks of such People, as have awakened the
Generosity of so powerful a Defender. Nor am I
ashamed of those Weaknesses of mine, which they have
exposed in Print (the greatest of which was my
thinking too candidly of them, to whom I wrote my
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Letters with so much unguarded Friendliness, and
Freedom), since you have found a Way to turn those
Weaknesses into Virtue, by your partial Regard of
them. The Eye of Candour, like the Sun, makes
all the Beauties which it sees; it gives Colour and
Brightness to the meanest Objects purely by looking
on them. I agree with you, that there is a Pleasure
in seeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the
plainest Undress; but few Men are of Consequence
enough to deserve, or reward, that Curiosity. I
shall indeed (and so will all Mankind) be highly
pleased to see the Great Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> in this Light,
drawn by himself, like an antient Master, in rough
Strokes, without heightening, or shadowing: What
a Satisfaction to behold that perfect Likeness, with∣out
Art, Affectation, or even the Gloss of Colour∣ing,
with a noble Neglect of all that Finishing and
Smoothing, which any other Hand would have been
obliged to bestow on so principal a Figure? I write
this to a Man whose Judgment I am certain of, and
therefore am as certain you will give the World this
great Depositum, just as you have received it: There
will be no Danger of your dressing this <HI>Mars</HI> too
finely, whose Armour is not Gold, but Adamant,
and whose Stile in all Probability is much more strong,
than it is polish'd. I congratulate you, that this great
Treasure is fallen into your Hands; and I congratu∣late
all <HI>Europe,</HI> that it is to be delivered to them.
through the Hands of one, who will think it Sacrilege
to touch upon, much less to alter, any great Lines of
such an Original.</P>
<P>I can make you no better Return for your great
Compliment upon me (which it would be Arro∣gance
in me to shew to any other, and dangerous
even to remember myself) but by telling you, that
it is Honour enough to reward all my Studies, to find
my Character and Reputation is Part of the Care of
that Person, to whom the Fame and Glory of <HI>Peter
Alexiowitz</HI> was committed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
SIR,</P>
<P>I am forced to make use of another Hand than my
own in this Letter, having received a Wound cross
all the Veins of my right Hand, by which the Ten∣dons
of two Fingers are separated; however, it was
a Fine paid for my Life, which has been very nar∣rowly
saved, and which may now continue me some
Years longer,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 5, 1730-1.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I WAS unwilling to answer your too obliging Let∣ter
(which puts much too great a Stress upon my
Opinion) till I had read your Play with the Attention
it deserves; I mean, not once, but several times
over. In a Word, to comply with my Judgment
will cost you no Trouble, except to your Modesty;
which is, <HI>to act it as soon as possible.</HI> Nothing but
Trifles have I to object, and which were such as did
not once stop me at the first Reading; the Spirit,
Design, and Characters, carrying me on, without
Stop, Check, or even Intermission. You certainly
are Master of the Art of the Stage, in the manner of
forming and conducting the Design, which I think
impossible to be mended; of that Great Part, and of
the other, the raising the Passions, I will say nothing
to you, who know them so much better than my∣self.
I would only point out a few Particularities in
Thought or Expression, as material as excepting to a
Button on your Coat, or a loose Hair. Two or three
Lines I have with great Timorousness written on one
of your blank Leaves, in Black Lead, half afraid to
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
be legible, and not without some Hope that before
you see them, they may be vanished: So may per∣haps
my Objections, every one of them. Shall I see
you soon, to tell you these Nothings? Whenever I
shall see you, I hope to find, we can employ the
Time better, than I, in telling, or you, in hearing
them. Or must I return you the Play now? Your
Orders will be obey'd as soon as you give them.—I
really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery: I would have
her and you think, the Air of <HI>Richmond</HI> is particularly
good to re-establish her. Pray let Miss <HI>Hill</HI> know,
I am ready to believe all the good Things her own
Father can see in her: I can safely trust both his
<HI>Judgments,</HI> and his <HI>Affections.</HI> I am, truly,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 5. 1730-1.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I MADE a strong Essay to have told you in Per∣son
how very kindly I took your two last Letters.
The only Hours I had in my Power from a necessary
Care that brought me back immediately, I would
have imposed on you. It will please you to know
the poor Woman is rather better, tho' it may be but
like the Improvement of a Light on the End of a
dying Taper, which brightens a little before it ex∣pires.—Your
Hint about my Title <HI>Of false Taste,</HI>
you'll see, is made use of in the Second Edition.
Your Opinion also of my giving some publick Dis∣sent
or Protest against the silly malicious Miscon∣struction
of the Town, I agree to; but I think no
one Step should be taken in it, but <HI>in Concert</HI> with
the Duke whom they injure. It will be a Pleasure
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"/>
felt by you, to tell you, his Grace has written to me
the strongest Assurance imaginable of the Rectitude
of his Opinion, and of his Resentment of that Re∣port,
which to <HI>Him</HI> is an <HI>Impertinence,</HI> to <HI>me</HI> a <HI>Vil∣lainy.</HI></P>
<P>I am afraid of tiring you, and (what is your best
Security) I have not Time to do it. I'll only just
tell you, that many Circumstances you have heard, as
Resemblances to the Picture of <HI>Timon,</HI> are utterly
Inventions of Lyars; the Number of Servants never
was an Hundred, the Paintings not of <HI>Venio</HI> or <HI>La
Guerre,</HI> but <HI>Bellucci</HI> and <HI>Zaman</HI>; no such Buffet,
Manner of Reception at the Study, Terras, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all
which, and many more, they have not scrupled to
forge, to gain some Credit to the Application: And
(which is worse) belyed Testimonies of Noblemen,
and of my particular Friends, to condemn me. In
a word, the Malice is as great as the Dulness, of my
Calumniators: The one I forgive, the other I pity,
and I despise both. Adieu; the first Day I am near
you I will find you out, and shew you something you
will like. My best good Wishes are yours, and Miss
<HI>Urania</HI>'s</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <DATELINE>Parsons Green, <DATE>Feb. 5. 173<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I am fully satisfy'd we are each of us
sincerely and affectionately Servants to the other,
I desire we may be no further mis-led by the Warmth
of writing on this Subject. If you think I have
shewn too much <HI>Weakness,</HI> or if I think you have
shewn too much <HI>Warmth,</HI> let us forgive one another's
Temper. I told you I thought my Letter a filly one;
but the more I thought so, the more in sending it I
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
shew'd my Trust in your good Disposition toward me.
I am sorry you took it to have an Air of <HI>Neglect,</HI> or
<HI>Superiority:</HI> Because I know in my Heart, I had not
the least Thought of being any way superior to Mr.
<HI>Hill</HI>; and, far from the least Design to shew Neglect
to a Gentleman who was shewing me Civility, I meant
in Return to shew him a better Thing, Sincerity;
which I'm sorry should be so ill express'd as to seem
Rudeness. I meant but to complain as frankly as you,
that all Complaints on both Sides might be out, and at
a Period for ever: I meant by this to have laid a surer
Foundation for your Opinion of me for the future,
that it might no more be shaken by Mistakes or
Whispers.</P>
<P>I am sure, Sir, you have a higher Opinion of my
Poetry than I myself. But I am so desirous you
should have a just one of me every way, that I wish
you understood both my Temper in general, and my
Justice to you in particular, better than I find my
Letter represented them. I wish it the more, since
you tell me how ill a Picture my Enemies take upon
'em to give, of the Mind of a Man they are utter
Strangers to. However, you will observe, that much
<HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Emotion</HI> are a little inconsistent with <HI>Ne∣glect,</HI>
and an Opinion of <HI>Superiority.</HI> Towards Them,
God knows, I never felt any Emotions, but what bad
Writers raise in all Men, those gentle ones of Laughter
or Pity: That I was so open, concern'd, and serious,
with respect to you only, is sure a Proof of Regard,
not Neglect. For in Truth, nothing ever vex'd me,
till I saw your Epigram against Dr. S. and me come
out in their Papers: And this, indeed, did vex me, to
see <HI>One Swan among the Geese.</HI></P>
<P>That the Letters <HI>A. H.</HI> were apply'd to you in the
Papers, I did not know (for I seldom read them); I
heard it only from Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> as from yourself, and
seat my Assurances to the contrary. But I don't see
how the Annotator on the <HI>D.</HI> could have rectify'd
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
that Mistake, <HI>publickly,</HI> without particularizing <HI>your
Name,</HI> in a Book where I thought it too good to be
inserted. No doubt he has apply'd that Passage in the
<HI>D.</HI> to you, by the Story he tells; but his Mention of
<HI>Bombast, only</HI> in some of your <HI>Juvenile Pieces,</HI> I think,
was meant to shew, that Passage hinted only at that
<HI>allegorical Muddiness,</HI> and not at any <HI>worse sort of
Dirt,</HI> with which some other Writers were charged.
I hate to say what will not be believ'd: Yet when I
told you, <Q REND="inline">"Many ask'd me to <HI>whom</HI> that Oblique
Praise was meant?"</Q> I did not tell you I answer'd,
it was <HI>you.</HI> Has it escap'd your Observation, that the
Name is a Syllable too long? Or (if you will have it
a Christian Name) is there any other in the whole
Book? Is there no Author of two Syllables whom it
will better fit, not only as getting out of the allego∣rical
Muddiness, but as having been <HI>dipt in the Dirt
of Party-writing,</HI> and recovering from it betimes? I
know such a Man, who would take it for a Compli∣ment,
and so would his Patrons too—But I ask you
not to believe this, except you are vastly inclin'd to it.
I will come closer to the Point: Would you have the
Note <HI>left out?</HI> It shall. Would you have it expresly
said, <HI>you were not meant?</HI> It shall, if I have any In∣fluence
on the Editors.</P>
<P>I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Re∣buke,
and friendlily: I understood very well the <HI>Ca∣veat</HI>
on your Part to be the same; and complain'd
(you see) of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting
on my <HI>Behaviour</HI> and <HI>Temper to other Writers</HI>; be∣cause
I knew they were not true, and you could not
know they were.</P>
<P>You cannot in your cool Judgment think it fair to
fix a Man's Character on a Point, of which you do
not give one Instance? Name but the Man, or Men,
to whom I have unjustly omitted Approbation or En∣couragement,
and I'll be ready to do them Justice. I
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
think I have <HI>publickly</HI> prais'd all the best Writers of my
Time, except yourself, and such as I have had no fair
Opportunity to praise. As to the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Popular,</HI>
I've prais'd but few, and those at the Times when
they were <HI>least popular.</HI> Many of those Writers have
done nothing else but flatter'd the Great and Popular,
or been worse employ'd by 'em in Party-stuff. I do
indeed think it <HI>no great Pride</HI> in me, to speak about
<HI>them</HI> with some Air of Superiority; and this, Sir, must
be the Cause (and no other) that made me address <HI>that
Declaration</HI> of my Temper towards <HI>them,</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> who
had accus'd me of the contrary; not, I assure you,
from the least Imagination of any Resemblance be∣tween
you and them, either in Merit or Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>I nam'd Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> because you distinguish him
from the rest: So do I. But, moreover, he was up∣permost
in my Thoughts, from having endeavour'd
(<HI>before</HI> your Admonition) to promote his Affair, with
Lord <HI>Wilmington,</HI> Lord <HI>Lansdown,</HI> Lord <HI>Blandford,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Pulteney,</HI> &amp;c. who promis'd me to favour
it. But it would be unjust to measure my Good-will
by the Effects of it on the Great, many of whom are
the last Men in the World who will pay Tributes of
this sort, from their own un-giving Nature; and many
of whom laugh at me when I seriously petition for
Mr. <HI>Dennis.</HI> After this, I must not name the many
whom I have fruitlesly sollicited: I hope yet to be
more successful. But, Sir, you seem too iniquitous
in your Conceptions of me, when you fansy I call'd
such Things <HI>Services.</HI> I call'd 'em but <HI>humane Of∣fices:</HI>
Services I said I <HI>would</HI> render him, <HI>if I could.</HI>
I <HI>would</HI> ask a Place for Life for him; and I <HI>have</HI>;
but that is not in my Power: If it was, it would be
a <HI>Service,</HI> and I wish it.</P>
<P>I mention'd the <HI>Possibility</HI> of Mr. <HI>D.</HI>'s abusing
me for forgiving him, because he actually did, in
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Print, lately represent my poor, undesigning, Sub∣scriptions
to him, to be the Effect of Fear and Desire,
to stop his Critiques upon me. I wish Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> would
(for once) think so candidly of me, as to believe me
sincere in one Declaration, that <Q REND="inline">"I desire no Man
to belye his own Judgment in my Favour."</Q>
Therefore, tho' I acknowledge your generous Offer
to give <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Imperfections</HI> rather out of your
own Works than mine, in your intended Book; I
consent, with all my Heart, to your confining them
to <HI>mine</HI>; for two Reasons: The one, that I fear your
Sensibility that way is greater than my own (by ob∣serving
you seem too concern'd at that Hint given by
the Notes on the <HI>D.</HI> of a little Fault in the Works
of your <HI>Youth</HI> only): The other is a better, namely,
that I intend to amend by your Remarks, and correct
the Faults you find, if they are such as I expect from
Mr. <HI>Hill</HI>'s cool Judgment.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that my <HI>Poetical</HI> Talent is all
that may (I say not, will) make me <HI>remember'd:</HI> But
it is my <HI>Morality</HI> only that must make me <HI>Beloved,</HI> or
<HI>Happy:</HI> And if it be any Deviation from <HI>Greatness of
Mind,</HI> to prefer Friendships to Fame, or the honest
Enjoyments of Life to noisy Praises; I fairly confess
that Meanness. Therefore it is, Sir, that I much
more resent any Attempt against my moral Character
(which I know to be unjust) than any to lessen
my poetical one (which, for all I know, may be very
just).</P>
<P>Pray then, Sir, excuse my weak Letter, as I do your
warm one. I end as I begun. You guess'd right,
that I was sick when I wrote it: Yours are very well
written, but I have neither Health nor Time to make
mine so. I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of
my Writings (which would greatly improve your Cri∣ticisms
on my Errors), but of my Life and Manners
I do not yet repent one Jott, especially when I find
in my Heart I continue to be, without the least Acri∣mony
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
(even as little as I desire you should bear to
myself), sincerely, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours affectionately,
A. POPE.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>If I did not acknowledge as I ought, both the Fa∣ther's
agreeable Present, and the Daughter's
pretty one, which you sent me, I very ill ex∣press'd
myself. If Miss <HI>Urania Hill</HI> has not my
4<HI>to</HI> Edition of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> I beg your Leave to
send it her. You had sooner heard from me,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>EVER since I return'd Home, I have been in
almost roaring Pain, with a violent Rheumatism
in my Shoulder, so that all I am able to do is to re∣turn
you Thanks for yours. The Satisfaction it gave
me is proportion'd to the Regard I have for you. I
will not praise your Poem further than to say, the Ge∣nerosity
of its Sentiments must charm every Man:
Its other Merit you know well. You'll pardon the
few Doubts I start in the Interlinings; they are such
as you can efface as easily as they may deserve. I wish
to tell my Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> (who has so long ho∣nour'd
me with so particular and familiar an Ac∣quaintance)
the Honour done him.</P>
<P>I am very desirous to leave out that <HI>Note,</HI> if you
like so. The two Lords, and one Gentleman, who
really took and printed that Edition, I can (I doubt
not) bring easily to it.</P>
<P>The chief Objection I have to what you say of
myself in this Poem, is, that the Praise is too strong.
I may well compound for the rest.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely pleas'd with the Favour you have
done me in sending me your Poem, and the
more, as it gives me the Opportunity of assuring you
I never did, or meant you, the least Injury; in which
I should have fully satisfy'd you long since, had you
ask'd me the Question. I remember, Mr. <HI>Lintot</HI>
shew'd me a Piece of yours, of which (he said) you
desir'd my Opinion: I was just then in a great Hurry,
going a Journey out of Town upon Business for a few
Days; and therefore told him I would call for it in a
Day or two, to read carefully: However, I cast my
Eye on some Parts of it, which I lik'd, and told him
so. This was all, to the best of my Memory, that
pass'd between us; and you may imagine it was some
Surprize to me when I saw your Preface a very short
time after. I think it incumbent on any well-mean∣ing
Man, to acquit himself of an ill-grounded Suspi∣cion
in another, who perhaps means equally well, and
is only too credulous. I am sincerely so far from re∣senting
this Mistake, that I am more displeas'd, at
your thinking it necessary to treat me so much in a
Style of Compliment as you do in your Letter. I
will say nothing of the Poem you favour me with, for
fear of being in the wrong; but I am sure, the Per∣son

judge it. I am, with all Respect,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I AM not more happy, nor feel a greater Ease in
comparison of my former Pain, in the Recovery
from my Rheumatism, than in that from your Dis∣pleasure.
Be assur'd, no little Offenders ever shall

pleases me almost equally with the Poem; our Hearts
beat just together, in regard to Men of Power and
Quality: But a Series of Infirmities (for my whole
Life has been but one long Disease) has hinder'd me
from following your Advices. I this Day have writ
to Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> a Letter with your Poem. The
Familiarity in which we have liv'd some Years, makes
it not unusual, in either him or me, to tell each other

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Twickenham, <DATE>April 4. 1731.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IT is a serious Pleasure to me to find you con∣cern'd,
that I should do your good Sense and Dis∣cernment
the Justice it deserves. It is impossible for
me not to think just what you would have me on this
Head; the whole <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of your Poem
shews all little Thoughts to be Strangers to your Soul.
I happen to know many Particulars relating to the
Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s Conduct, and just Glory, in
that Scene you draw so well: But no Man ought (I
think) to attempt what you hint at, or can pretend to
do him more Honour than what you yourself here
have done, except himself: I have long press'd him
to put together many Papers lying by him, to that
End. On this late Occasion he told me you had for∣merly
endeavour'd the same, and it comes into my
Mind, that, on many of those Papers, I've seen an En∣dorsement
<HI>A. H.</HI> which I fansy might be those you
overlook'd. My Lord spoke of you with great Re∣gard,
and told me how narrowly you both miss'd of
going together on an adventurous Expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On an Expedition to the <HI>West Indies.</HI></NOTE>. The
real Reason I carry'd him your Poem was, that I
imagin'd you would never send it him, of all Man∣kind;
and that I was truly pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>I am troubled to reflect, how unequal a Corre∣spondent
I am to you, partly thro' want of Health (for
I have since had a Fever), partly thro' want of Spirits,
and want of Solitude; for the last Thing we Poets
care to own, is the other Want; that of Abilities.</P>
<P>But I am sensibly pleas'd with your Letter, not
only with that which seem'd to prompt it, but with
the Things said in it: And I thank you for both—Believe me desirous to see you: When, and where,
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>August 30. 1731.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE very Moment I receive yours, I dispatch
this, to tell you with Sincerity both my
Guest's and my own Concern to have no Hopes of
seeing you; as well as, what is unfeignedly a yet
greater Concern, our Sorrow at what you express to
be the Occasion of it. He wishes, now, for Power,
for no other Reason, than to be able to elevate Merit
above that Fortune it commonly finds, from Power.
And I can truly add, for my own Part, who never
tasted Power, that I never felt any Uneasiness in a
low Fortune, but that which it causes when I find it
cannot prove the Regard and Love I bear to true
Worth in any afflictive Circumstance.</P>
<P>Excuse my pretending to say a Word on that Sub∣ject;
all I meant to say (but the Overflowings of my
Heart vented thus much) was, to beg you to think
too favourably of us both, to imagine we should not
be unhappy as much as dissatisfy'd, if we did not read
once or twice more your Tragedy, after what you
tell us of your having alter'd it on our Suggestions.
We have a conscientious Fear, that you may have
comply'd too implicitly with those <HI>Marks,</HI> rather of
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
our scrupulous Sincerity, than of any certain Judg∣ment;
and have quench'd sometimes a Flame we
admire, tho' we may fear; or sometimes heighten'd
what may be natural, tho' we might think it low.
Pray ease us, by favouring us with a second View
of it.</P>
<P>And whenever you send me that Essay, you may
be assur'd of my sincere Answer; tho' upon that
Head I could rather wish it were given you personally.
I hope a little Time will bring us together. Know
me, most affectionately, dear Sir,</P>

A. POPE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>I COULD not persuade myself to write to you
since your great Loss, till I hop'd you had re∣ceiv'd
some Alleviation to it, from the only Hand
which can give any, that of Time. Not to have
mention'd it, however fashionable it may be, I think
unnatural, and in some Sense inhuman; and I fear
the contrary Custom is too much an Excuse, in
reality, for that Indifference we too usually have for
the Concern of another: In truth, that was not my
Case: I know the Reason of one Man is of little
Effect toward the Resignation of another; and when
I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine, I doubted
not which had the Advantage, even tho' in your own
Concern. 'Tis hard, that in these tender Afflictions
the Greatness of the Mind and the Goodness are op∣posite
to each other; and that while Reason, and the
Consideration upon what Conditions we receive all
the Goods of this Life, operate towards our Quiet;
even the best of our Passions (which are the same
Things with the softest of our Virtues) refuse us that
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Comfort. But I'll say no more on this melancholy
Subject. The whole Intent of this Letter is to tell you
how much I wish you capable of Consolation, and
how much I wish to know when you find yourself
so. I would hope you begin to seek it, to amuse
your Mind with those Studies of which <HI>Tully</HI> says,
<HI>Adversis perfugium &amp; solatium praebent,</HI> and to tran∣scribe
(if I may so express it) your own Softnesses
and generous Passions into the Hearts of others who
more want them. I do not flatter you in saying, I
think your Tragedy will do this effectually (to which
I had Occasion, the other Day, to do Justice to Mr.
<HI>Wilks</HI>), or whatever else you chuse to divert your own
Passion with, and to raise that of your Readers.—I
wish the Change of Place, or the Views of Nature
in the Country, made a Part of your Scheme.—You
once thought of <HI>Richmond</HI>—I wish you were there, or
nearer. I have thrice miss'd of you in Town, the
only Times I have been there: My last Month was
pass'd at my Lord <HI>Cobham</HI>'s, and in a Journey thro'
<HI>Oxfordshire:</HI> I wish you as susceptible, at this Time,
of these Pleasures as I am. I have been truly con∣cern'd
for you, and for your Daughter, who I believe
is a <HI>true Part</HI> of you. I will trouble you no farther,

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been, and yet am, totally confin'd by
my Mother's Relapse, if that can be call'd so,
which is rather a constant and regular Decay. She is
now on her last Bed, in all Probability, from whence
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
she has not risen in some Weeks, yet in no direct
Pain, but a perpetual Languor. I suffer for her, for
myself, and for you, in the Reflection of what you
have felt at the Side of a sick Bed which I now feel,
and of what I probably soon shall suffer which you
now suffer, in the Loss of one's best Friend. I have
wish'd (ever since I saw your Letter) to ask you, since
you find your own House a Scene of Sorrows, to pass
some Days in mine; which I begin to think I shall
soon have the same melancholy Reason to shun. In
the mean time, I make a sort of Amusement of this
melancholy Situation itself, and try to derive a Com∣fort
in imagining I give some to her. I am seldom
prompted to Poetry in these Circumstances; yet I'll
send you a few Lines I sent t' other Day from her
Bed-side to a particular Friend. Indeed I want Spi∣rits
and Matter, to send you any thing else, or on
any other Subject. These too are spirit-less, and
incorrect.</P>
<LG>
<L>While ev'ry Joy, successful Youth! is thine,</L>
<L>Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine.</L>
<L>Me long, ah long! may these soft Cares engage;</L>
<L>To rock the Cradle of reposing Age,</L>
<L>With lenient Arts prolong a Parent's Breath,</L>
<L>Make Languor smile, and smooth the Bed of Death.</L>

all Success. You will, I am sure, be so candid,

writing your Epilogue on any but a just Reason, and
indeed (to me) an invariable Maxim, which I have
held these Twenty Years. Every poetical Friend I

think nothing more easy. In Truth, all this is doing

<P>I Thank you for your Tragedy, which I have now
read over a sixth Time, and of which I not only
preserve, but increase, my Esteem. You have been
kind to this Age, in not telling the next, in your Pre∣face,
the ill Taste of the Town, of which the Re∣ception
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
you describe it to have given of your Play
(worse, indeed, than I had heard, or could have ima∣gin'd),
is a more flagrant Instance than any of those
Trifles mention'd in my Epistle; which yet, I hear,
the sore Vanity of our Pretenders to Taste flinches at
extremely—The Title you mention had been a pro∣perer
to that Epistle—I have heard no Criticisms about
it, nor do I listen after 'em; <HI>Nos haec novimus esse
nihil</HI> (I mean, I think the Verses to be so): But as
you are a Man of tender Sentiments of Honour, I
know it will grieve you to hear another undeservedly
charg'd with a Crime his Heart is free from: For, if
there be Truth in the World, I declare to you, I
never imagin'd the least Application of what I said of
<HI>Timon</HI> could be made to the D. of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s,</HI> than whom
there is scarce a more blameless, worthy and gene∣rous,
beneficent Character, among all our Nobility:
And if I have not lost my Senses, the Town has lost
'em, by what I heard so late, as but two Days ago,
of the Uproar on this Head. I am certain, if you
calmly read every Particular of that Description,
you'll find almost all of 'em point-blank the Reverse
of that Person's <HI>Villa.</HI> It's an aukward Thing for a
Man to print, in Defence of his own Work, against
a Chimaera: You know not who, or what, you fight
against: The Objections start up in a new Shape,
like the Armies and Phantoms of Magicians, and no
Weapon can cut a Mist, or a Shadow. Yet it would
have been a Pleasure to me, to have found some
Friend saying a Word in my Justification, against a
most malicious Falshood. I speak of such, as have
known by their own Experience, these twenty Years,
that I always took up their Defence, when any
Stream of Calumny ran upon 'em. If it gives the
Duke one Moment's Uneasiness, I should think my∣self
ill paid, if the whole Earth admir'd the Poetry;
and believe me, would rather never have written a
Verse in my Life, than that any one of 'em should
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
trouble a truly good Man. It was once my Case be∣fore,
but happily reconcil'd; and among generous
Minds nothing so endears Friends, as the having of∣fended
one another.</P>
<P>I lament the Malice of the Age, that studies to see
its own Likeness in every thing; I lament the Dulness
of it, that cannot see an Excellence: The first is my
Unhappiness, the second yours. I look upon the
Fate of your Piece, like that of a great Treasure,
which is bury'd as soon as brought to Light; but it is
sure to be dug up the next Age, and enrich Posterity.</P>
<P>I have been very sensible, on these two Occasions,
to feel them (as I have done) at a Time, when I daily
fear'd the Loss of (what is, and ought to be dearer
to me than any Reputation, <HI>but that of a Friend,</HI> or

<P>YOUR very kind Letter came hither in my
Absence, which occasion'd my Delay till now
in acknowledging it. Your Partiality to me, both
as a Poet, and as a Man, is great; the former I de∣serve
not, but the latter I will never forfeit. It
would be wronging your Modesty to say much of the
Verses you inclose, but it would be wronging Sense
and Poetry, not to say they are fine ones, and such as
I could not forget, having once seen them.</P>
<P>I have almost forgot what I told you of the Patent;
but at the Time I told it, I could not well be mis∣taken,
having just then had the Account from Mr.
<HI>Davenant</HI> the Envoy: Indeed I fansy it was only of
his Ancestors Patent that he spoke (unless Sir <HI>William
Davenant</HI> bought up <HI>Killigrew</HI>'s); I know no Way
of coming to the Knowledge of this Affair, Mr.
<HI>Davenant</HI> being now abroad, and I know not where.
But if you would have me write about it, I will learn
his Direction.</P>
<P>I am at all Times glad to hear of you, on any
Occasion. I would willingly wait on you in the
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
Park, if I knew your Times: I have call'd twice or
thrice there in vain, without being heard. I guess'd
you were in the Country. My sincere good Wishes
attend you; and your agreeable Family, as far as I
have seen of it, I cannot but wish well to. I am,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I SENT you as honest an Answer as I could, to
the Letter you favour'd me with; and am sorry
you imagine any <HI>civil Reproach,</HI> or <HI>latent Meaning,</HI>
where I meant to express myself with the utmost
Openness. I would assure you, if you please, by
my Oath, as well as my Word, that I am in no De∣gree
displeas'd at any Freedom you can take with me
in a private Letter, or with my Writings in publick.
I again insist, that you alter or soften no one Criticism
of yours in my Favour; nor deprive yourself of the
Liberty, nor the World of the Profit, of your freest
Remarks on my Errors.</P>
<P>In what I said, I gave you a true Picture of my
own Heart, as far as I know it myself. It is true, I
have shewn a <HI>Scorn</HI> of some <HI>Writers</HI>; but it proceeded
from an Experience that they were bad Men, or bad
Friends, or vile Hirelings; in which Case, their being
Authors did not make them, to me, either more re∣spectable,
or more formidable. As for any other
Pique, my Mind is not so susceptible of it as you
have seem'd, on each Occasion, too much inclin'd
(I think) to believe. What may have sometimes
seem'd a <HI>Neglect</HI> of others, was rather a <HI>Laziness</HI> to
cultivate or contract new Friends, when I was satis∣fied
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
with those I had; or when I apprehended their
Demands were too high for me to answer.</P>
<P>I thank you for the Confidence you shew you have
in me, in telling me what you judge amiss in my
<HI>Nature.</HI> If it be (as you too partially say) my only
Fault, I might soon be a perfect Character: For I
would endeavour to correct this Fault in myself, and
intreat you to correct all those in my Writings; I
see, by the Specimen you generously gave me in your
late Letter, you are able to do it; and I would rather
owe (and <HI>own</HI> I owe) that Correction to your Friend∣ship,
than to my own Industry.</P>
<P>For the last Paragraph of yours, I shall be ex∣tremely
ready to convey what you promise to send
me, to my Lord <HI>B.</HI> I am in Hopes very speedily to
see him myself, and will, in that Case, be the Bearer;
if not, I shall send it, by the first safe Hand, to him.
I am truly glad of any Occasion of proving myself,
with all the Respect that is consistent with Sincerity,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 9. 1738.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE Favour of yours of <HI>May</HI> the 11th, had
not been unacknowledged so long, but it
reached me not till my Return from a Journey, which
had carried me from Scene to Scene, <HI>where Gods
might wander with Delight.</HI> I am sorry yours was
attended with any Thoughts less pleasing, either from
the Conduct towards you of the World in general, or
of any one else, in particular. As to the Subject-matter
of the Letter, I found what I have often done
in receiving Letters from those I most esteemed, and
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
most wished to be esteemed by; a great Pleasure in
reading it, and a great Inability to answer it. I can
only say, you oblige me, in seeming so well to know
me again; as one extremely willing that the free
Exercise of Criticism should extend over my own
Writings, as well as those of others, whenever the
Public may receive the least Benefit from it; as I
question not they will a great deal, when exerted by
you. I am sensible of the Honour you do me, in
proposing to send me your Work before it appears:
If you do, I must insist, that no Use in my Favour
be made of that Distinction, by the Alteration or
softening of any Censure of yours on any Line of
mine.</P>
<P>What you have observed in your Letter I think
just; only I would acquit myself in one Point: I
could not have the least <HI>Pique</HI> to Mr. <HI>Th.</HI> in what is
cited in the Treatise of the <HI>Bathos</HI> from the Play
which I never supposed to be his: He gave it as
<HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, and I take it to be of that Age: And
indeed the Collection of those, and many more of
the Thoughts censured there, was not made by me,
but Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot.</HI>—I have had two or three Occa∣sions
to lament, that you seem to know me much
better as a <HI>Poet,</HI> than as a <HI>Man.</HI> You can hardly
conceive how little either Pique or Contempt I bear
to any Creature, unless for immoral or dirty Actions:
Any Mortal is at full Liberty, unanswer'd, to
write and print of me as a Poet, to praise me one
Year, and blame me another; only I desire him to
spare my Character as an honest Man, over which he
can have no private, much less any public, Right,
without some personal Knowledge of my Heart, or
the Motives of my Conduct: Nor is it a sufficient
Excuse, to alledge he was <HI>so</HI> or <HI>so informed,</HI> which
was the Case with those Men.</P>
<P>I am sincere in all I say to you, and have no Va∣nity
in saying it. You really over-value me greatly
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
in my Poetical Capacity; and I am sure your Work
would do me infinitely too much Honour, even if it
blamed me oftener than it commended: For the first
you will do with Lenity, the last with Excess. But
I could be glad to part with some Share of any good
Man's Admiration, for some of his Affection, and
his Belief that I am not wholly undeserving to be
thought, what I am to you,</P>

<P>I NEED not assure you in many Words, that I join
my Suffrage intirely with Lord <HI>B.</HI>'s in general,
after a fourth reading your Tragedy of <HI>Caesar.</HI> I
think no Characters were ever more nobly sustained
than those of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> in particular: You
excel throughout in the Greatness of Sentiment;
and I add, that I never met with more striking Sen∣tences,
or lively short Reprizes. There is almost
every-where such a Dignity in the Scenes, that in∣stead
of pointing out any one Scene, I can scarce
point out any that wants it, in any Degree (except
you would a little raise that of the <HI>Plebeians</HI> in the last
Act). That Dignity is admirably reconciled with
Softness, in the Scenes between <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Calpur∣nia:</HI>
And all those between <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> are a
noble Strife between Greatness and Humanity. The
Management of the Whole is as artful as it is noble.
Whatever particular Remarks we have made further,
will be rather the Subject of Conversation than a Let∣ter,
of which we shall both be glad of an Opportu∣nity,
either here at <HI>Twickenham,</HI> or in Town, as
shall best suit your Conveniency. Pray, Sir, let

justly, entertain of the Wish I feel (and ever

<P>I AM forced to say but little to you, tho' my Spirit
has been warm'd by the kind (and let me add, the
just) Manner, in which you took our last Letter.
My Lord (who has not only resolved to make him∣self
my Guest, but an Inhabitant of this Place during
all his Stay in this Kingdom) is at this Time fixed to
this Place too closely, by a Fever, which has con∣fined
him to his Bed and Chamber some Days. I am
but just now satisfied that he is out of Danger; and I
am as sure, as that he <HI>lives,</HI> that he will be glad to
see you <HI>here.</HI> And I think it certain (if you can get
those Affairs over which you mention, as soon as I
wish you at Ease), that you may find him here this
Fortnight: That I shall take a warm Part in bringing
you together, my own Heart knows: And let me
tell you, when you know that Heart as well, as I
hope Fortune will not long hinder you from doing
(tho' many unlucky Strokes of her Influence have
been too strong upon us both, who <HI>must</HI> else have na∣turally
united, as we mutually love and hate the same
Things), I believe, trust, and pray, we shall per∣fectly
understand one another. Believe me till then,

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 12. 1738.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now little to say of your Tragedy, which
I return with my Thanks for your Indulgence to
my Opinion, which I see so absolutely defer'd to,
that I wish I had cross'd less frequently. I cannot
find another Thing I think a Fault in you.</P>
<P>But my Lord thinks, three Things may yet be re∣consider'd.
<HI>Brutus,</HI> on Sight of the Warrant sign'd
for his Death, takes at once the Resolution of mur∣dering
<HI>Caesar,</HI> as none of his Father. Quere, Whe∣ther
in the Scene that follows between him and <HI>Caesar,</HI>
all Tenderness on the Side of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and all beyond
the Point of Honour that Friendship exacted, should
not rather be avoided than heightened?</P>
<P>Another Quere is, Whether it would not beget
more Indignation in the Audience against <HI>Cassius,</HI> and
more Compassion for <HI>Caesar,</HI> to shew that <HI>Cassius</HI> su∣spected
<HI>Brutus</HI> to be <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Son, and therefore ex∣acted
from <HI>Brutus</HI> the Oath of sparing neither <HI>Father</HI>;
Relation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The third Thing is, Whether the Efforts made by
<HI>Caesar</HI> to prevent the Civil War, not only by the
equal Offer he made, while the Matter was under
Debate in the Senate (and which the Consuls <HI>Len∣tulus</HI>
and <HI>Marcellus</HI> refused to report to the Senate),
but by the Message he sent to <HI>Pompey,</HI> when he was at
<HI>Brundusium,</HI> to desire a Meeting, to settle the Matter,
and avoid the Civil War.—<HI>Vid. Caes. Comm. de bell,</HI>
<HI>Civili, lib.</HI> 1. The Mention of these somewhere in
the Play might help to remove the Prepossession against
<HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>After our little Cavils (for so we will rather call
minute and verbal Points of Criticism) we owe you
the Justice to extol highly, what we highly approve,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
and you need not desire us to speak as we think: 'Tis
what we have (in different Ways) done all our Lives,
where it was to our Prejudice, and cannot but do
here, where it is to our Honour. I only wish you a
Stage, Actors, and an Audience worthy of you, and
It.—I have often wished to live to see the Day when
Prologues and Epilogues should be no more. I
wish a great Genius would break thro' the silly,
useless, Formality. But at least I would have one
try, to leave the Audience <HI>full</HI> of the <HI>Effects</HI> of a
good Tragedy, without an Epilogue. Let me add
another Hint, concerning the Apparatus and Circum∣stantials
of your Play (since I have nothing left more
to wish in the Play itself); that you would intitle it
barely, <HI>The Tragedy of Caesar,</HI> and give no Intima∣tion
of his being a <HI>Patriot</HI>; for I fear, instead of
preparing the Audience, it might revolt them, and
put all the little Criticks upon carping previously at
the very Design and Character; which would appear
by Degrees, and with the proper Preparations, in
the Piece on the Stage. Another thing was a Thought
of my Lord's, that it should be printed before acting,
a Day or two; for the Sentiments are so thick-sown,
and the Sense so deep sometimes, that they require
more Attention and Thought than the Hearer may be
apt to give on the first Representation. I am not
positive, either as to his, or my Thought, but sub∣mit
them to your Consideration.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add, but to lament our Unhappi∣ness,
that we cannot see you personally to confirm
what these Letters tell you, of our real Opinion of
your Work, Esteem of its Author, and Wishes for
your Success, in this, and every thing. I am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THIS is quite a Letter of Business, and therefore
excuse it; I will not mix in it a Word of Af∣fection,
which I have not a Moment's time to ex∣press,
and will not prejudice the sacred Idea of
Friendship.</P>
<P>It is near a Month ago that I try'd to see Mr.
<HI>Thomson,</HI> to know the Time of his Tragedy: He was
not within my Reach; and therefore at last I wrote
to him, and also to Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> to let them both
know the Deference you paid them, and the heroic
(I will not call it less) Disinterestedness you express'd
in regard to them. I have not yet been able to hear
where they are, or any way to have an Answer fur∣ther,
than I have learn'd it will be impossible for ei∣ther
of them to bring on their Plays early (a Friend
of theirs telling me they are in no Forwardness) till
the Middle or End of the Winter; therefore you
may have room. I wish from my Soul you may get
yours first, as well acted as it deserves. A better,
that may eclipse it, or even worthily follow it, I
hardly expect to see.—But upon this Notice, I
believe you may safely advance it, the sooner the
better.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>B.</HI> is yet with me, more properly I yet
belong to him, Body as well as Mind (for my Mind
is every-where his). I would to God you had any
Opportunity of seeing us before we part; my House
should be yours, as much of it as is not his. I be∣lieve
I shall soon go with him on a little Journey be∣fore
he quits <HI>England.</HI> You'll forgive the abrupt

<P>I HAVE been confirmed by Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> as to the
Retardment of his Play, of which he has written
but two Acts. I have since seen Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> who
has finished his, but is very willing yours should be
first brought on, in <HI>January</HI> as you propose, or after
his in <HI>February,</HI> whichsoever may be most agreeable
to you. He farther offers any Assistance he can give
you, in case of your own Absence, as to treating
with Mr. <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> (with whom he thinks you can∣not
be too careful or explicit), or attending the Re∣hearsals
for you, which he promises to undertake with
all Diligence, if you are not provided with another
Friend in that Case. He has heard of some Imperti∣nence,
which may be apprehended from one Person's
Refusal or Unwillingness to act, and believes he can
employ some proper Influence to bring him to a
right Behaviour. These, with any other Services in
which you may please to employ him, he bids me
assure you, it will be a high Satisfaction to him to
engage in.</P>
<P>I must express, on my own Part, a real Regret to
be so little useful to you. I can do no more than
join with Lord <HI>B.</HI> in paying due Praises to so merito∣rious
a Work; our Suffrage is an airy Tribute, from
whence no solid Good redounds to you; and I find
myself still more inclined to the <HI>Man,</HI> than the <HI>Au∣thor,</HI>
if I could be any way instrumental to the Hap∣piness
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
or Ease of so generous an one. I could almost
wish myself a Minister to patronize such a Genius,
and I could almost wish my Lord one again, for no
other Reason; even tho' his Country wants such an
one, as well as his Friends.</P>
<P>I have never once been able to see Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> in
Person; when I do (and it shall be soon) he shall
know how much he is obliged to you for that Plan of
an Alteration of his Tragedy, which is too good for
me, with any Honesty, to put upon him as my own.

<P>I HAVE felt an Uneasiness of Mind (occasioned by
a conscious Sense, how unequally I have express'd
my Anger and Contempt, at the Treatment of your
<HI>Caesar</HI> by the Man of the Stage) ever since I last
wrote to you; and a hundred Interruptions from Day
to Day (for I have lived in the World, and a busy
and idle World both, it is) have ever since hindered
me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought.
Yet I am the less concerned, since, by my Delay, I
can now tell you I have last Night seen Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI>'s
Play, the fifth Act of which I had not before read,
thro' those Interruptions I have mention'd. It suc∣ceeded
(hitherto at least; for Yesterday was the first
Day) as well as I could expect: But so vilely acted
in the Womens Parts and the Mens (except two) that
I wonder it could succeed. Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> after many
shameful Tricks from the Manager, is determined to
act his Play at the other Theatre, where the Ad∣vantage
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
lies as to the Women, and the Success of <HI>his</HI>
will depend upon them (I heartily wish you would
follow his Example, that we might not be deprived
of <HI>Caesar</HI>). I have yet seen but three Acts of Mr.
<HI>Thomson</HI>'s, but I am told, and believe by what I have
seen, that it excels in the Pathetic. The Dignity
of Sentiment, and Grandeur of Character, will still be
<HI>Caesar</HI>'s, as in his History, so in your Poetry, supe∣rior
to any.</P>
<P>The Person to whom you intended so great a Com∣pliment
as to address that Piece to his Name, is very
sensible of your delicate Manner of Thinking: He
bids me assure you, his own Knowledge of your In∣tention
is sufficient Pleasure to him, and desires you
would not think of doing him either Favour or Justice,
till the World knows better how to do itself the for∣mer,
in doing you the latter. He is still detained
here by the Perverseness of his Affairs; and wishes,
as I most heartily do also, that Fortune did not treat
you so much alike. The Stage is as ungrateful to
you, as his Country to him: You are both sure of
Posterity, and may say in the mean time with <HI>Scipio,</HI>

<P>I AM oblig'd to you for your Compliment, and
can truly say, I never gave you just Cause of
Complaint. You once mistook on a Bookseller's
idle Report, and publickly express'd your Mistake;
yet you mistook a second time, that two initial Let∣ters,
only, were meant of you, tho' every Letter in
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
the Alphabet was put in the same manner: And, in
Truth (except some few), those Letters were set at
Random to occasion what they did occasion, the Su∣spicion
of bad and jealous Writers, of which Num∣ber
I could never reckon Mr. <HI>Hill.</HI> and most of whose
Names I did not know.</P>
<P>Upon this Mistake you were too ready to attack
me, in a Paper of very pretty Verses, in some publick
Journal.—I should imagine the <HI>Dunciad</HI> meant you
a real Compliment, and so it has been thought by
many, who have ask'd, to whom that Passage made
that oblique <HI>Panegyrick?</HI> As to the Notes, I am
weary of telling a great Truth, which is, that I am
not Author of 'em; tho' I love Truth so well, as
fairly to tell you, Sir, I think even that Note a Com∣mendation,
and should think myself not ill us'd <HI>to
have the same Words said of me:</HI> Therefore, believe
me, I never was other than friendly to you, in my
own Mind.</P>
<P>Have I not much more Reason to complain of <HI>The
Caveat?</HI> Where give me Leave, Sir, to tell you,
with the same Love of Truth, and with the Frank∣ness
it inspir'd (which, I hope, you will see, thro'
this whole Letter), I am falsly abus'd, in being repre∣sented
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>sneakingly to approve, and want the Worth to
cherish, or befriend Men of Merit.</HI>"</Q> It is, indeed,
Sir, a very great Error: I am sorry the Author of
that Reflection knew me no better, and happen'd to
be unknown to those who could have better inform'd
him: For I have the Charity to think, he was misled
only by his Ignorance of me, and the Benevolence to
forgive the worst Thing that ever (in my Opinion)
was said of me, on that Supposition.</P>
<P>I do faithfully assure you, I never was angry at any
Criticism, made on my Poetry, by whomsoever: If
I could do Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> any humane Office, I would,
tho' I were sure he would abuse me personally To∣morrow;
therefore it is no great Merit in me, to
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
find, at my Heart, I am your Servant. I am very
sorry you ever was of another Opinion.—I see, by
many Marks, you distinguish'd me from my cotem∣porary
Writers: Had we known one another, you
had distinguish'd me from others, as a <HI>Man,</HI> and no
ill, or ill-natur'd one. I only wish you knew, as well
as I do, how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to
those of the Head: I vow to God, I never thought
any great Matters of my poetical Capacity; I only
thought it a little better, comparatively, than that of
some very mean Writers, who are too proud.—But,
I do know <HI>certainly,</HI> my moral Life is <HI>superior</HI> to that
of most of the <HI>Wits</HI> of these Days. This is a silly
Letter, but it will shew you my Mind honestly, and,
I hope, convince you, I can be, and am,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 28. 1730-1.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>YOUR Answer, regarding no Part of mine, but
the Conclusion, you must pardon my Compli∣ment
to the Close of yours, in return; if I agree
with you, that your Letter is <HI>weaker,</HI> than one would
have expected.</P>
<P>You assure me, that I did not know you so well,
as I might, had I happened to be known to others,
who could have instructed my Ignorance; and I begin
to find, indeed, that I was less acquainted with you,
than I imagined: But your last Letter has enlighten'd
me, and I can never be in Danger of mistaking you,
for the future.</P>
<P>Your Enemies have often told me, that your <HI>Spleen</HI>
was, at least, as distinguishable, as your <HI>Genius:</HI>
And it will be kinder, I think, to believe them, than
impute to Rudeness, or ill Manners, the Return you
were pleased to make, for the Civility, with which I
addressed you.</P>
<P>I will, therefore, suppose you to have been <HI>peevish,</HI>
or in <HI>Pain,</HI> while you were writing me this Letter:
And, upon that Supposition, shall endeavour to un∣deceive
you.—If I did not love you, as a good <HI>Man,</HI>
while I esteem you, as a good <HI>Writer,</HI> I should read
you without Reflection: And it were doing too much
Honour to <HI>your</HI> Friends, and too little to my <HI>own
Discernment,</HI> to go to <HI>them</HI> for a Character of your
Mind, which I was able enough to extract from your
Writings.</P>
<P>But, to imitate your Love of Truth, with the
Frankness you have taught me, I wish the <HI>Great</HI>
Qualities of your Heart were as strong in you as the
<HI>Good</HI> ones: You would then have been above that
Emotion and Bitterness, wherewith you remember
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Things which want Weight to deserve your An∣guish.</P>
<P>Since you were not the Writer of the Notes to the
<HI>Dunciad,</HI> it would be impertinent to trouble you
with the Complaint I intended:—I will only observe,
that the Author was in the <HI>Right,</HI> to believe me ca∣pable
of a second <HI>Repentance</HI>; but, I hope, I was
incapable of that second <HI>Sin,</HI> which should have
been previous to his Supposition.—If the initial Let∣ters
<HI>A. H.</HI> were not <HI>meant</HI> to stand for my Name,
yet, they were, every-where, read so, as you might
have seen in <HI>Mist</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> and other publick Pa∣pers;
and I had shewn Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> an Example, how
reasonable I thought it to clear a Mistake, publickly,
which had been publickly propagated.—One Note,
among so many, would have done me this Justice:
And the Generosity of such a Proceeding could have
left no Room, for that offensive <HI>Sneakingly,</HI> which,
though, perhaps, too harsh a Word, was the pro∣perest
a Man could chuse, who was satirizing an
Approbation, that he had never observed warm
enough to declare itself to the World, but in De∣fence
of the <HI>Great,</HI> or the <HI>Popular.</HI></P>
<P>Again, if the Author of the Notes knew, that
<HI>A. H.</HI> related not to me, what Reason had he to al∣lude
to that Character, as mine, by observing, that
I had published Pieces bordering upon <HI>Bombast</HI>—A Circumstance so independent on any other Purpose
of the Note, that I should forget to <HI>whom</HI> I am
writing, if I thought it wanted Explanation.</P>
<P>As to your oblique Panegyrick, I am not under so
blind an Attachment to the <HI>Goddess</HI> I was devoted
to in the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> but that I knew it was a <HI>Com∣mendation</HI>;
tho' a dirtier one than I wished for; who
am, neither fond of some of the Company, in which
I was listed—the noble Reward, for which I was to
become a Diver;—the allegoric Muddiness, in
which I was to try my Skill;—nor the Institutor
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
of the Games, you were so kind to allow me a
Share in.</P>
<P>Since, however, you could see, so clearly, that I
ought to be satisfied with the Praise, and forgive the
Dirt it was mixed with, I am sorry, it seemed not
as reasonable, that you should pardon me for return∣ing
your Compliment, with more, and opener, Praise,
mixed with less of that Dirtiness, which we have,
both, the good Taste to complain of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caveat,</HI> Sir, was mine.—It would have been
ridiculous to suppose you ignorant of it: I cannot
think, you need be told, that it meant you no
Harm;—and it had scorn'd to appear under the bor∣row'd
Name, it carries, but that the whimsical Turn
of the Preface, would have made my own a Contra∣diction.—I promise you, however, that, for the fu∣ture,
I will publish nothing, without my Name, that
concerns you, or your Writings. I have, now,
almost finished, <HI>An Essay on Propriety, and Impro∣priety,
in Design, Thought, and Expression, illustrated,
by Examples, in both Kinds, from the Writings of Mr.
Pope</HI>; and, to convince you how much more Pleasure
it gives me, to distinguish your <HI>Lights,</HI> than your
<HI>Shades</HI>;—and that I am as willing as I ought to be,
to see, and acknowledge my Faults; I am ready,
with all my Heart, to let it run thus, if it would,
otherwise, create the least Pain in you:—<HI>An Essay
on Propriety, and Impropriety,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>illustrated by Ex∣amples,
of the first, from the Writings of Mr.</HI> Pope,
<HI>and of the last, from those of the Author.</HI></P>
<P>I am sorry to hear you say, you never thought any
great Matters of your <HI>Poetry.</HI>—It is, in my Opinion,
the Characteristic you are to hope your <HI>Distinction</HI>
from: To be <HI>Honest</HI> is the Duty of every <HI>plain Man!</HI>
Nor, since the <HI>Soul</HI> of Poetry is Sentiment, can a
<HI>Great Poet</HI> want <HI>Morality.</HI> But your <HI>Honesty</HI> you
possess in common with a <HI>Million,</HI> who will never be
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
<HI>remembered</HI>; whereas your <HI>Poetry</HI> is a Peculiar, that
will make it impossible, you should be forgotten.</P>
<P>If you had not been in the <HI>Spleen,</HI> when you
wrote me this Letter, I persuade myself, you would
not, immediately after censuring the <HI>Pride</HI> of Writers,
have asserted, that you, <HI>certainly, know</HI> your moral
Life, above that of most of the Wits of these Days:
At any other Time, you would have remembered,
that <HI>Humility</HI> is a moral Virtue. It was a bold De∣claration;
and the <HI>Certainty</HI> with which you know
it, stands in need of a better <HI>Acquaintance</HI> than you
seem to have had with the <HI>Tribe</HI>; since you tell me,
in the same Letter, that many of their <HI>Names</HI> were
<HI>unknown</HI> to you.</P>
<P>Neither would it appear, to your own Reason, at
a cooler Juncture, over-consistent with the Morality
you are so sure of, to scatter the Letters of the whole
Alphabet, annexed, at Random, to Characters of a
light and ridiculous Cast, confusedly, with Intent to
provoke jealous Writers, into Resentment, that you
might take Occasion, from that Resentment, to ex∣pose
and depreciate their Characters.</P>
<P>The Services, you tell me, you would do Mr.
<HI>Dennis,</HI> even tho' he should abuse you, in Return, will,
I hope, give him some Title to expect an Exertion
of your recommendatory Influence in his Behalf: A
Man, so <HI>popular,</HI> as you, might secure him a great
Subscription: This would merit to be called a
<HI>Service</HI>; and, the more the World should find
you abused in the Works you had recommended,
so much the more glorious Proof would they see,
that your Morals were, in Truth, as superior, as
you represent them, to those of your Cotempora∣ries.
Tho' you will pardon me the <HI>Pride</HI> of won∣dering,
a little, how this Declaration came to be
made to <HI>me,</HI> whose Condition not standing in need
of such Services, it was not, I think, so necessary,
<PB N="45" REF="48" MS="y"/>
you should have taken the Trouble to talk of
them.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, Sir, I find, I am so sincerely your
<HI>Friend,</HI> that it is not, in your own Power, to make
me your <HI>Enemy:</HI> Else, that unnecessary Air, of
Neglect, and Superiority, which is so remarkable,
in the Turn of your Letter, would have nettled me
to the Quick; and I must triumph, in my Turn, at
the Strength of my own Heart, who can, after it,
still find, and profess myself, most affectionately and
sincerely,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your humble Servant,
A. HILL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. From Mr. HILL, To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 10. 1731-32.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I AM oblig'd to you for your Letter from <HI>Parsons
Green,</HI> and come heartily into the Proposal, it
begins with: A mutual Resolution to forget in each
other, the Appearance of every Thing, that has been
distasteful to either, agrees, I am sure, with the Af∣fection,
I feel for you, at my Heart, where it is
founded on a natural Strength, both of <HI>Reason,</HI> and
<HI>Inclination.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caveat</HI> began, originally, with the Vision: I
added not, till after it was finish'd, those Lines,
among which are the unlucky Ones, that displeas'd
you. I was scarful, lest, without something of that
kind, by way of Introduction, the Reader might
think himself push'd, too abruptly, into the Alle∣gory:
But, I confess, it was unreasonable in me to
cover your <HI>Praise,</HI> which I delighted in, under the
Veil of an Allegory; and explain my <HI>Censure,</HI> too
openly, in which I could take no Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I lov'd you so well, and thought
of you so often, that it was not easy for me, in any
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
Humour, to write Verse, and not dwell upon you.—Have you never been <HI>jealous</HI> of a favourite <HI>Mistress?</HI>—Have you never, under a <HI>Pique,</HI> at her suppos'd
<HI>Neglect,</HI> said, what she could no more deserve, than
you could think she did, upon cooler Reflection?—And have you not found, after all, that you was
never the less her <HI>Lover?</HI></P>
<P>Your Offer is very kind, to prevail on the Editor
of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to leave out the Note, or declare,
that I was not meant in it; But I am satisfied:—It is over;—and deserves no more of your Appli∣cation.</P>
<P>I agree with you, It is <HI>Morality</HI> makes us belov'd:
I know it, from the Effect of your Writings; where
I <HI>but admire</HI> the Harmony, and the Elegance, while
I <HI>love</HI> the Generosity, and the Candor of the Senti∣ments.
I prefer too, as you do, <HI>Friendships,</HI> and
the honest Enjoyments of Life, to <HI>Fame,</HI> and noisy
<HI>Praises</HI>; but I am glad you are happier, than you wish
to be, who enjoy both Benefits, together.</P>
<P>Yet, if there was nothing desirable in <HI>Fame,</HI> there
could be nothing detestable in <HI>Slander</HI>; and your
honest Uneasiness, at being <HI>thought</HI> worse than you
<HI>are,</HI> would, in that Case, be in Danger of passing for
a <HI>Weakness.</HI></P>
<P>I know, however, that you consider <HI>Praise</HI> in a
nobler Light than <HI>Vanity.</HI>—There is, in Fame, the
Promulgation of a good Man's Example, which his
natural Life being too short to extend so far as he
wishes, <HI>That</HI> Defect is supplied by the second Life,
he receives, from his <HI>Memory.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen, and been asham'd of that low Turn,
which Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> gave, to your Good-nature.—Where a Man's <HI>Passions</HI> are too strong for his <HI>Vir∣tues,</HI>
his <HI>Suspicion</HI> will be too hard for his <HI>Prudence:</HI>
He has often been weak enough to treat you in a
Manner that moves too much Indignation against
Himself, not to leave it unnecessary for you, also, to
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
punish him.—Neither of us would chuse him for a
<HI>Friend</HI>; but none of the <HI>Frailties</HI> of his <HI>Temper,</HI> any
more than the heavy <HI>Formalities</HI> of his <HI>Style,</HI> can pre∣vent
your acknowledging, there is often <HI>Weight,</HI> in
his <HI>Arguments</HI>; and <HI>Matter,</HI> that deserves Encourage∣ment,
to be met with, in his <HI>Writings.</HI></P>
<P>I will soon, Sir, convince you, that my Sensibility
is not so tender, as you suppose it to be: I am so far
from an Inclination to defend some <HI>Pieces,</HI> which I
was too much a Boy, when I publish'd, that I em∣brace
all Occasions of exposing 'em, myself, to the
Contempt they have merited.</P>
<P>I am already too much oblig'd, not to blush at your
Mention of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> with a View of sending it to
my Daughter; and <HI>She</HI> is too inquifitive a Lover of
what gives her <HI>Instruction</HI> with <HI>Delight,</HI> to have been
satisfied without finding, in her Closet, whatever she
had heard <HI>you</HI> had publish'd.</P>
<P>As a Proof, how determin'd I am, to throw no∣thing
upon the World, that may give you Cause of
Complaint, I will send you, in Manuscript, the <HI>Essay
on Propriety,</HI> as soon as it is finish'd: I do the same,
now, by a smaller Piece, I am about to publish, be∣cause
you will find yourself concern'd in some Part of
it.—I am, Sir, with great Truth,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most humble,
and most obedient Servant,

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. From Mr. HILL, To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 17. 1738.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE Pleasure, I was sure to receive with your
Letter, brought an unexpected Chagrin in its
Company, from a Vein of civil Reproach, that runs
thro' it; which I can better discern, than account
for; since I must not suspect, without wronging my
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
Ideas of your Equity, that you could be displeas'd at
the Freedom I took in my Sentiments. If I believ'd
they had given you the smallest Offence, I would ra∣ther
commit my Essay, in its present rough State, to
the Flames, than transcribe it, either for yourself, or
the Publick.</P>
<P>Indeed it was with a kind of foreboding Reluctance
that I censur'd any Passage of <HI>yours</HI>; and to confess
the Truth, frankly, I had only one Reason for doing
it. After I had convinc'd myself, thoroughly, that
<HI>Propriety,</HI> in some of the Lights I was considering it
under, had been universally neglected, in Poetry, I
foresaw, it would be impossible to establish the Belief
of a Fact so unlikely, without citing the strongest
<HI>Examples:</HI>—To do this, from the Works of our
<HI>dead</HI> Authors only, carry'd the Face of a <HI>Meanness,</HI>
I could not tell how to submit to.—To draw formal
Citations from any Pieces that had appear'd of my
own (tho' full enough, God knows, of Absurdities,
to have furnish'd more Proofs than I wanted), would
have look'd too assuming, and silly:—To borrow such
Instances out of other, less faulty, Cotemporaries, not
however reputed among the sparkling great Lumi∣naries
of Wit, would have induc'd a mistaken Con∣clusion,
that, in the Works of more masterly Writers,
there were no such <HI>Examples</HI> to be met with.—And
now,—Is there a good Judge in <HI>England</HI> (except one)
who will not see, and acknowledge, the Necessity
that threw me, unavoidably, upon <HI>your</HI> Writings?</P>
<P>However, I am glad, at my Heart, it was Dr.
<HI>A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t</HI> who made that Collection you mention; for
I am almost unwilling to be found in the <HI>Right,</HI> when
I disapprove what <HI>your</HI> Name has been stamp'd on;
yet your own honest Argument (that it is not enough
to excuse a Reporter of Falshoods, that he was told,
and believ'd, what he publish'd) must defend me
against its Advancer: For neither is it a sufficient
Excuse, that a <HI>Writer,</HI> whose Name, in the Front of
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
a Book, has given Weight to the Censures it propa∣gates,
was not <HI>Author</HI> of some of those Censures;
since whatever a Man sets his <HI>Hand</HI> to, he ought, first,
to examine the <HI>Truth</HI> of.</P>
<P>I am charm'd, while I hear you disclaim that Pro∣pensity
to <HI>Pique</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> which, to speak with
the Soul of a Friend, seems, to me, the only <HI>Spot</HI> on
your Character.—We are, All of us, in some Lights,
or other, the <HI>Dupes</HI> of our natural Frailties: And
when Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with the Warmth that becomes a
great Mind, tells me how far he is from despising De∣fects
in Men's <HI>Genius,</HI>—never feeling any Contempt
but for the Dirt of their <HI>Actions</HI>; I am sure he says
nothing but what he firmly believes to be true. And
yet there are Pieces, well known to be <HI>his,</HI> many
Passages whereof no Man, less appris'd than himself
of his Heart's secret Views and Intentions, can read,
without being strongly convinc'd of a Scorn, that re∣gards
<HI>Genius</HI> only: Tho', if he loves you but half so
sincerely as I do, you have no sooner disavow'd the
Design, than he concludes, the Imputation was
groundless.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, 'tis Pity that a Thinker, so
humane and benevolent, should indulge an Ambi∣guity,
in the Turn of his Expression, that scatters
Gall, which his Heart never licens'd; since I believe
it a general Truth, that Men, of the openest and ho∣nestest
Natures, sooner catch Fire at <HI>Contempt,</HI> than
<HI>Oppression.</HI>—And, as to any <HI>Dirtiness</HI> in Actions
which take Birth from Effect of such Influence, we
may conclude, from those irresistible little Sallies of
<HI>Fury,</HI> whereby, even among undesigning and innocent
Infants, we see <HI>Brother</HI> precipitated into Outrage
against <HI>Brother,</HI> immediately upon any cold Provo∣cation
of <HI>Scorn,</HI> that there is nothing <HI>immoral</HI> in
what may be done, or declar'd, too offensively, under
Impressions so violent, so involuntary, and natural.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53"/>
After all this grave Face of Apology, I am an ab∣solute
Stranger to the <HI>Grounds</HI> upon which those
Men, you refer to, proceeded.—Nay, I am so, for
the most part, even to the <HI>Measures</HI> by which they
provok'd you: All the Reason, indeed, that I have
for giving you any of <HI>my</HI> Thoughts on the Subject, is
deriv'd from your own starting into it (a little di∣gressively)
immediately after hinting some Occasions
you had to lament, that I knew you less justly, as a
<HI>Man,</HI> than a <HI>Poet.</HI>—I will appeal to impartial Poste∣rity,
whether I do not know you much better, in
both Lights, than ten thousand of those pretending
<HI>Esteemers,</HI> of whose Affection you think yourself
surer. It will never be in my <HI>Will,</HI> nor my <HI>Power,</HI>
to transmit such a <HI>Picture,</HI> as yours, without its best,
and most beautiful <HI>Likeness:</HI> I shall leave to duller
<HI>Dutch</HI> Painters in Criticism, their unenvied Delight,
to draw <HI>Monsters.</HI> And know very well, for my own
Part, that I should but <HI>disgrace</HI> the desir'd Reputation
of my <HI>Pencil,</HI> if I miss'd the <HI>Resemblance,</HI> too widely,
in a Piece which must expect to be compar'd with
Originals of the same, by many different <HI>Masters.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I acquit you of any further Allusion to <HI>me,</HI>
than by that retrospect Glance, <HI>en passant,</HI> I have,
<HI>affectionately,</HI> caught the Occasion of pointing out, to
one of the least intentionally guilty among Men, a
seeming <HI>Tartness</HI> of Spirit in himself, which he will
easily <HI>find,</HI> when he looks for; and which, whenever
he does find, and guard against, by submitting his
<HI>Wit</HI> to his <HI>Philosophy,</HI> he will become the most <HI>un∣natural</HI>
good Man in the World; for he will leave
himself not a <HI>Fault,</HI> to be blam'd for!</P>
<P>As to myself, who was born to mix Sin with Re∣pentance,
I plead guilty to all such Indictments as
you, in that Place, <HI>present</HI> to my Memory.—I was
always too perceptibly quick, in my Apprehension of
<HI>Contempts,</HI> or <HI>Indignities:</HI>—A Temper, which would
have been as <HI>unpardonable,</HI> as I confess it to be <HI>weak,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
and <HI>self-mortifying</HI>; but that the Fault, tho' of too
swelling a Nature, leaves no Voids for Admission of
<HI>Malice.</HI>—It is an offensive, indeed, but reconcileable
Imbecillity of Mind: <HI>Shakespear</HI> felt, and understood
it, very finely.<Q><L>" It carries <HI>Anger,</HI> as the Flint does <HI>Fire!</HI></L>
<L>" Which, being struck, throws out a hasty <HI>Spark,</HI></L>
<L>" And then, grows cold again.—"</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet I will endeavour to redress this wrong Bent in
my Temper, and make Way for the Rectification
you are so good as to shew me my WANT OF.—And
thus, in the Commerce of <HI>Friendship,</HI> as in Traffick,
less generous, there is offer'd a mutual Exchange
of Advantages:—Something, always, to <HI>give</HI> and to
<HI>gain:</HI> And this makes <HI>both Sides</HI> more rich, and more
satisfy'd.—What a Loss, then, have unsocial and
vain Dispositions, which, by a sullen Seclusion from
these Rights of Reproof, and Plain-dealing, cut off
all the kind Use of Correction!—<HI>Human Nature,</HI> let
it be as susceptible of <HI>Grace</HI> as it can, never yet
wanted <HI>Pride</HI> enough to make Mortifications, of this
Kind, a <HI>Requisite.</HI> Far from hating our <HI>Friends</HI>
for a little faithful, tho' unwelcome, <HI>Asperity,</HI> let us
think <HI>him,</HI> of all Men, <HI>unhappiest,</HI> who has never
been bless'd with an <HI>Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>And now, let me ask you (with a Transition very
fashionably abrupt and uncritical)—How is your
good and great Friend, Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> to be reach'd?—You will scarce think I mean,—to be <HI>emulated!</HI>
Ours is an Age that exposes such an old-fashion'd Po∣litician,
as HE is, to any <HI>Fear,</HI> sooner than that of a
<HI>Rival.</HI> I have a Packet to send him, a little too
large for the <HI>Post.</HI> It is a manuscript Piece, which I
purpose to <HI>dedicate</HI> to him, when publish'd. But it
would be Prudence, and Decency, as Affairs stand at
present, to wait his Permission, after reading it: Not
that there is any thing nice, or exceptionable, in the
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
Subject; and, I am sure, I have no need to add, tho'
I speak of a <HI>Dedication,</HI> that mine has no <HI>Views</HI> like
a <HI>modern</HI> one. If you will be so kind as to think
how it may reach my Lord's Hands, I shall, in a few
Days, send it open, to yours; begging you, first, to
peruse, and then give it a Seal, and a Forwarding.
If you will have the Goodness to authorize such a
Trouble, please to do it under a Direction, like your
last, to</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. From Mr. HILL, To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 25. 1738.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IT is Time to relieve you from Subjects, and
Lengths, like my last; yet you will hardly suspect
such a Blindness, in my bad Understanding, as to
think, I distinguish not the true <HI>Cast</HI> of some Colours
which you need not have held quite so near me.—Notwithstanding all which, if I had not more Cause to
distrust it, on <HI>your</HI> Side, than my <HI>own,</HI> I should flatter
myself, we were born to be <HI>Lovers</HI>; we are so often,
and so unaccountably, mistaking one another into <HI>Re∣serves,</HI>
and <HI>Resentments!</HI> Yet I am sorry, whenever
this happens, because the most <HI>lost</HI> Time, in Mens
Lives, is <HI>that</HI> which they waste in <HI>Expostulation.</HI>
They, who are <HI>Friends,</HI> find it <HI>selfish,</HI> and <HI>diffident</HI>—and
between <HI>Enemies 'tis inflaming,</HI> and <HI>fruitless.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there would be no End of such—what must
I call 'em?—<HI>Eclaircissements</HI> is an affected <HI>French</HI>
Word, and I am heartily sorry I <HI>want</HI> it.—In plain
<HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> I always did, and I still do, most
affectionately <HI>esteem</HI> you, both as <HI>Man,</HI> and as <HI>Poet:</HI>
And if now-and-then, for a Start, I have been put
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
out of Humour with <HI>either,</HI> I would fain have you
think, it was no less your <HI>own</HI> Fault, than <HI>mine:</HI> At
least, I am sure, I believ'd so. And if, whenever
you suppos'd me to have acted inconsistently with my∣self,
on that Principle, you had only been so kind, as
to have declar'd <HI>why</HI> you thought so, I would openly,
and immediately, either have demonstrated the <HI>Mis∣take</HI>
to be <HI>yours,</HI> or confess'd, and abhorr'd, my <HI>own
Error.</HI>—I will always stand <HI>bound</HI> to give, if not a
<HI>rational,</HI> yet a <HI>moral,</HI> Account of my <HI>Actions:</HI> Not
alone, as they regard Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but <HI>Men,</HI> in the re∣motest

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>HAVING seen a Letter you wrote to my
Friend Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, tho' I
cannot boast the Honour and Happiness of your Ac∣quaintance,
and ought with the utmost Deference
and Veneration to approach so supreme a Genius;
yet my full Heart is not to be repress'd by Forma∣lities;
and you must allow me the Pleasure of pour∣ing
forth my best Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>I will not affect a moderate Joy at your Appro∣bation,
your Praise: It pleases, it delights, it ravishes
me! Forgive me for the Lowness of the Truth,
when I vow, I'd rather have it than the Acclama∣tions
of Thousands: 'Tis so sincere, so delicate, so
distinguishing, so glowing, and, what peculiarly marks
and endears it, so beautifully generous.</P>
<P>That great Mind, and transcendent Humanity,
that appear in the Testimony you have been pleas'd
to give my first Attempt, would have utterly con∣founded
me, if I had not been prepar'd for such an
Entertainment, by your well-known Character;
which the Voice of Fame, and your own masterly
Writings, loudly proclaim.</P>
<P>It would both be disingenuous, and rudely unjust,
in me, after what you have observ'd, to dissemble my
Satisfaction at several Passages in the Poem: This let
me say, that your Reflections have enter'd into the
very Soul of my Purpose, and, even to myself, cast a
Light over the Whole.</P>
<P>How rare, how happy, is it to find a Judge whose
discerning Goodness overlooks the Faults of what is
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
well meant, at the same Time that his fine enthusi∣astic
Taste improves the Beauties!</P>
<P>To you, alone, it belongs, to write so inimitably,
and to read so indulgently.</P>
<P>If I wrote all that my Admiration of your Per∣fections,
and my Gratitude, dictate, I should never
have done; but, left I tire you, I'll for the present
rather put a Violence on myself: Only let me che∣rish
one Hope further—of being, some time or other,
admitted into the most instructive and entertaining
Company in the World. I am, with the greatest
Devotion,</P>

<P>I Receiv'd yours with a Soul awaken'd all to Joy,
Gratitude, and Ambition. There is such a noble
Excellence of Mind, so much uncommon Goodness,
and Generosity of Heart, in every thing you say, as
at once charms and astonishes me.</P>
<P>As you think, imagine, and write, with a diviner
Warmth, superior to the rest of Mankind; so the
very Praises, you bestow, bear the Stamp of Emi∣nence,
and reflect stronger on yourself.</P>
<P>While I meditate your encouraging Lines, for a
while, I forget the Selfishness, Degeneracy, and
Cruelty of Men, and seem to be associated with
better and more exalted Beings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Social Love,</HI> of which you are so bright an
Example, tho' it be the distinguishing Ornament of
Humanity, yet there are some ill-natur'd enough to
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
degrade it into a Modification of Self-love, according
to them, its Original.</P>
<P>Those Gentlemen, I am afraid, mingle their
Tempers too much with their Speculations.</P>
<P>Self-love is, indeed, indispensably necessary for the
Well-being of every Individual, but carries not along
with it an Idea of moral Beauty and Perfection;
whereas Social Love is of quite another Nature; the
just and free Exercise of which, in a particular man∣ner,
renders one amiable, and divine. The accom∣plish'd
Man I admire, the honest Man I trust; but
'tis only the truly-generous Man I intirely love. Hu∣manity
is the very Smile and Consummation of Vir∣tue;
'tis the Image of that fair Perfection, in the Su∣preme
Being, which, while he was infinitely happy
in himself, mov'd him to create a World of Beings to
make them so.</P>
<P>The Excellent ones of the Earth, in the Exercise
of Social Love, feel it as much to be an original Im∣pulse,
as the low World that blind Affection, they
bear themselves; nor are they, in the least, conscious
of that forc'd, cold Reasoning, by which it is deduc'd
from so mean an Original.</P>
<P>How many deathless Heroes, Patriots, and Mar∣tyrs,
have been so gloriously concern'd for the Good
of Mankind, and so strongly actuated by Social Love,
as frequently to act in direct Contradiction to that of
Self?</P>
<P>A great many more Arguments might be adduced
to prove, that Social Love is a nobler, independent
Principle, by itself, were not the secret Sense, that
every good Man has of the Matter, instead of a
thousand.</P>
<P>Your Writings, while they glow with innumerable
Instances of strong Thinking, and sublime Imagina∣tion,
are peculiarly mark'd with this beautiful Bene∣volence
of Mind; and 'tis that which, at this time,
has awaken'd, in me, these Reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61"/>
I am ravish'd with the Hope, you give me, of your
nearer Acquaintance; and that it should ever prove
unprofitable, is as impossible, as that it should not be,
in the highest Degree, delightful to,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>April 27. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>WHEN I reflect how truly happy I was,
Yesterday, in your Company, it is impos∣sible
for me to restrain my Sense of it, from breaking
out into this Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>There is, in your Conversation, such a Beauty,
Truth, Force, and Elegance of Thought, and Ex∣pression;
such animated, fine Sense, and chastis'd
Fancy; so much Dignity and Condescension, Subli∣mity
and Sweetness; in a Word, such a Variety of
Entertainment and Instruction, as is beyond all Ad∣miration.</P>
<P>Your Smiles have all the encouraging Power of
Humanity in them: What one says, is receiv'd with
great Taste, and Indulgence; and to listen to you,
gives one a secret, and more ravishing Pleasure, than
to be Author of the best Things in other Company.</P>
<P>There is downright Inspiration in your Society: It
enlarges and exalts all the Powers of the Soul, chases
every low Thought, throws the Passions into the most
agreeable Agitations, and gives the Heart the most
affecting Sentiments—'Tis moral Harmony!</P>
<P>It gives me an additional Pleasure, to reflect how
justly pleas'd, too, Mr. <HI>Savage</HI> was.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
Nothing is, to me, a stronger Instance of the un∣improvable
Nature of that unhappy Creature of whom
you speak so compassionately, notwithstanding of the
barbarous Provocation he has given you, than his re∣maining
bleak, and wither'd, under the Influences of
your Conversation—a certain Sign of a Field that the
Lord has curs'd.</P>
<P>There is none that renders human Nature more
amiable than you; and, at the same time, none that
renders the greatest Part of it more contemptible:
And to descend from your Company, and mingle
with the Herd of Mankind, is like <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s
descending from a Throne, to graze with the Beasts of
the Field.</P>
<P>Now I feast on Reflection—and am like a poor
Man, that has brought as much from a rich Enter∣tainment
with him, as must sustain him for many Days
afterwards.</P>
<P>What charms and amuses me, in a particular
Manner, is, the Account you gave us of that little
Seraph, the young <HI>Urania!</HI> Her elegant Turn of
Mind; her Innocence, and Goodness, in the Choice
of her Subjects; her Fancy, Judgment, and Ambi∣tion,
above her Years; and the beautiful Struggle of
the last ('tis unfair to call it Vanity), occasion'd by
the rude Stupidity of the <HI>School-Boy,</HI> are most agree∣ably
surprising.</P>
<P>What you, obligingly, observ'd of good Com∣pany's
being <HI>Ariosto</HI>'s Fountain of Thirst, is remark∣ably
true of yours—I shall long impatiently for the
farther Refreshment of it, and am, with the most
intire Regard,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Oldman's Coffee-house, <DATE>May 24. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HOPE that your uncommon Goodness will
forgive me, what I scarcely can forgive myself,
my not having, hitherto, answer'd the last encou∣raging
Letter, and Copy of Verses, you honour'd me
with.</P>
<P>The Approbation which, out of the Fulness of a
beneficent Heart, you are pleas'd to give me, I am
fond and ambitious of, next to that of <HI>Heaven:</HI> 'Tis
my best Reward for what I have done, and a noble
Incitement to go on. When <HI>you</HI> approve, my whole
Soul is awak'd, and charm'd.</P>
<P>Pleasing is your Praise, but severe is your Satire:
'Tis particularly mark'd with exalted Sentiment, and
generous Contempt. There is a Force in it, that
strikes thro' the Heart; and a Majesty, not to be ex∣press'd.
In a Word, it is the unaffected Resentment
of a great Mind.</P>
<P>It is impossible for me, in the Compass of this Let∣ter,
to say how much I admire every particular Line;
yet 'tis as impossible for me to restrain myself from
dwelling on some.
<Q><L>" Smile at your vanish'd Hope—convinc'd, too
late,</L>
<L>" That Greatness dwells not, always, with the
Great."</L></Q>
I feel the first Line, too sensibly; and the last finely
insinuates the Absurdity of vulgar and hereditary
Greatness.</P>
<P>Your sinking of the Lord's unlasting Name in the
Depth of Time, is pleasingly and nobly just: Sir <HI>John
Falstaff</HI> sunk not with greater Alacrity, in a literal
Sense, than they and all their Fopperies do in a meta∣phorical.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/>
I never read any thing more glorious, than the four
following Lines.
<Q><L>" Patrons are <HI>Nature</HI>'s Nobles, not the <HI>State</HI>'s;</L>
<L>" And Wit's a Title, no <HI>Broad Seal</HI> creates.</L>
<L>" Kings, from whose Bounty Wealth's chief Cur∣rents
flow,</L>
<L>" Are <HI>poor</HI> in Pow'r, when they would <HI>Souls</HI>
bestow."</L></Q>
They are the most divine Triumph of Merit, and
Virtue, that was ever writ. The best way of dis∣playing
all their Beauties is, to read them a thousand
and a thousand Times over.</P>
<P>Your Description of the Court-haunting, Wink∣observing
Bard, is so natural, that, if I am not mis∣taken,
it may be found a Picture of some living Ori∣ginals.</P>
<P>The last Paragraph is very strongly and delicately
wrought off; but so favourable to me, as obliges me
to suppress all Sentiments, save such as flow from
Gratitude; with which my Heart is as full, as yours
is with Goodness and Perfection.</P>
<P>You have given me <HI>Fame</HI>; and what have I to
return you, but the Acknowledgment of a grateful
Soul?</P>
<P>How powerfully was I charm'd with the four Acts
of <HI>Elfrid,</HI> you were so condescendingly good as to
read us! There is in them such a rich Assemblage of
all the Excellencies of the best Poetry, as is not any∣where
to be found. I never met, before, with such
a Force, and Dignity of Passion. My Heart trembles,
yet, when I reflect. But I will not cramp my Ad∣miration
into the small Space this Letter allows.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI> is now gone into the Country, where
he justly expects to be vastly entertain'd, and in∣structed,
by your Correspondence. I have been some∣what
melancholy since his Departure, touch'd with
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
these pensive Emotions, parting with such a Friend
gives.</P>
<Q><L>Bounteous Creator of the tender Heart!</L>
<L>Is there no World, where Friends shall never part?</L>
<L>Be that our future Lot, and of such Bliss</L>
<L>Grant us an Earnest, ere we die, in this.</L></Q>
<P>I go, on <HI>Saturday</HI> next, to reside at Mr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s
Academy in <HI>Little Tower-street,</HI> in Quality of Tutor
to a young Gentleman there.</P>
<P>Since you have been pleas'd to raise me, in some
measure, to the new Life of your Favour, let me
never fall from it, but frequently be allow'd the Ho∣nour
of subscribing myself, dear Sir,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 7. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>ENcourag'd by that most divine of all Virtues,
your charming Goodness, I frequently, you see,
take the Liberty to address you.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> last I wrote to you, from a Coffee-house
in <HI>Westminster,</HI> but had the Misfortune to hear
you were gone out, only Half an Hour, before the
Letter was sent.</P>
<P>Flattering myself, then, with some Hopes of your
Company, I did not mention a Copy of Verses I re∣ceiv'd,
on <HI>Friday</HI> last, from Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> to be pre∣fix'd
to the Second Edition of <HI>Winter</HI>; and which I
send you inclos'd. That you should read them, was
his particular Desire, in the following Terms:—<Q REND="inline">"Offer my Verses to Mr. <HI>Hill</HI>'s Perusal, and tell
him, that I will not determine their Fate, till I first
learn his Opinion of them: For I know him too
nobly sincere, to indulge <HI>my</HI> Vanity, at the Expence
of <HI>your</HI> Credit. Say, likewise, that I will shortly
venture to make use of that Permission he so ge∣nerously
granted me, of writing to him, as often as
my Fear of becoming troublesome will let me."—</Q>
All that I shall observe concerning them, to such a
finish'd Judge as you are, is, that their only glo∣rious
Fault, if they have any, is, an Excess of that
beautiful Benevolence of Mind, which, among a
thousand other Things, make you and him so greatly
amiable.</P>
<P>I hinted to you in my last, that, on <HI>Saturday</HI>
Morning, I was with Sir <HI>Spencer Compton.</HI> A certain
Gentleman, without my Desire, spoke to him con∣cerning
me; his Answer was, that I had never come
near him: Then the Gentleman put the Question, if
he desir'd that I should wait on him; he return'd, he
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
did: On this, the Gentleman gave me an introductory
Letter to him. He receiv'd me in what they com∣monly
call a civil Manner, ask'd me some Common∣place
Questions, and made me a Present of Twenty
Guineas. I am very ready to own, that the Present
was larger than my Performance deserv'd; and shall
ascribe it to his Generosity, or any other Cause, ra∣ther
than the Merit of the Address.</P>
<P>As the Case now is, one of your infinite Delicacy
will be the best Judge, whether it will be proper to
print these two inimitable Copies of Verses I have
from you, and Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> without such little Alter∣ations
as shall clear Sir <HI>Spencer</HI> of that best Satire I
ever read. I shall say no more on that Head; for if
there be any Reasons for such Alterations, you will,
of Necessity, at one Glance, see them in the strongest
and finest Light. Only this let me add, should you
find that the Case requir'd some small Alterations,
and yet not indulge me with them, I shall reckon
what my Patron gave me, a fatal Present.—'Tis a
Thought too shocking to be born—to lose the Ap∣plause
of the great Genius of the Age, my Charter of
Fame! for—I will not name it!—But you are too
good to plague me so severely.—I expect this Favour
from Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> next Post.</P>
<P>When you honour me with an Answer, for which
I shall be anxious, please to direct for me at Mr.
<HI>Watts</HI>'s Academy, in <HI>Little Tower-street.</HI> I am, dear

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>June 11. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been, for some Days last past, in the
Country, else the inclos'd Sheets, to which you
yourself have given the greatest Sanction and Value,
should have waited on you ere now.</P>
<P>It was your Approbation that gave me, formerly,
an equally just and noble Satisfaction; and the Con∣tinuance
of it is my inviolable Ambition.</P>
<P>Since I put you to the Trouble of altering your
Verses, I ought to give you an Account why Mr.
<HI>Mallet</HI>'s were not alter'd, likewise.—The Truth is,
he promis'd me to alter them, as I wrote to you;
but, in a following Letter, told me, that, after se∣veral
Attempts, he found it absolutely out of his
Power; and, rather than lose them, I resolv'd to
print them, as they at first were. To this Resolution
your last favourable Letter, in a great measure, rais'd
me: And who, that has a Soul in him, could forbear
to follow the Advice you give me, in those generous
Lines?<Q><L>Heedless of Fortune, then look down on State,</L>
<L>Balanc'd, within, by Reason's conscious Weight:</L>
<L>Divinely proud of independent Will,</L>
<L>Prince of your Passions, live their Sov'reign still.</L></Q></P>
<P>I wish, that the Declaration, from my Heart, with
regard to you, in the Preface, may not be disagreeable.
These Sentiments I could not suppress; and they are
but a faint Expression of the full Esteem and Admi∣ration,
I shall ever bear you.</P>
<P>May I hope that one of the inclos'd Copies of my
Poem can be acceptable to a Lady of Mrs. <HI>Hill</HI>'s fine
Taste, and the young Darling of the Muses, <HI>Urania,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
who, in such a tender Age, has encounter'd with all
the Horrors of so rough a Description?</P>
<P>Shall I languish out a whole Summer, in the same
City with you, and not once be re-inspir'd with your
Company? Such a Happiness would much brighten
my Description of that Season; from which, to fill
out this Letter, I venture to transcribe the following
Lines.<Q><L>Oft in this Season, too, the <HI>Horse,</HI> provok'd,</L>
<L>While his big Sinews, full of Spirits, swell,</L>
<L>Trembling with Vigour, in the Heat of Blood,</L>
<L>Springs the high Fence; and o'er the Field effus'd,</L>
<L>Darts on the gloomy Flood, with steady Eye,</L>
<L>And Heart estrang'd to Fear; his nervous Chest,</L>
<L>The Seat of Strength! bears down th'opposing Stream,</L>
<L>Luxuriant, and arrect: Quenchless his Thirst,</L>
<L>He takes the River, at redoubled Draughts,</L>
<L>And, with wide Nostrils, snorting, skims the Wave.</L></Q></P>
<P>In your last you were pleas'd to threaten me, as
you term it, with a long Letter. I beg you would
be as exact, in the Execution of your Threatenings,
as you always are, in the Performance of your Pro∣mises;
which shall be submitted to, with the most

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been almost intirely in the Country, since
I had the Honour of yours, and of the inclos'd
Papers, you were so good, as to send me. The two or
three Days since my Return to Town have been ra∣ther
hurry'd than employ'd in solliciting for the Be∣nefit
of old <HI>Dennis.</HI> Your well-known and for∣merly-experienc'd
Goodness will, I hope, forgive
me for having been so selfish as to keep your Papers so
long. Tho' I would have had some Objections to
your undertaking the Translation of <HI>Zaire</HI>; now
that it is so affectingly done, I should be very un∣grateful,
for the great Pleasure it has given me, to
think of them any more. In reading of <HI>Zara,</HI> I
forget what it was that I objected to <HI>Zaire.</HI> You have
heighten'd it with mere Imagination, but such a
chastis'd one, as accords perfectly well with the nobler
Fervency of the Heart. The Sentiments and Re∣flections,
too, rise in the Translation, and glow
stronger, as well as the Touches of the poetical Pen∣cil.
Allow me to say, that, in these Respects, I
deeply feel the Difference betwixt Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Hill.</HI> The more generous Warmth of your
Heart more animates the Scene, raises the dear Tu∣mult
in the Breast, and moves me much more. I
observ'd nothing that I wish'd alter'd but a Word
here and there, which are mere Trifles, and not
worth Regard. One, however, I will take the Li∣berty
to mention: It is in a Speech of the first Scene,
which marks the Civility and Gallantry of <HI>France</HI>—<Q REND="inline">"Where
Men adore <HI>their Wives</HI>"</Q>—The two last
Words I would change into—<HI>the Fair.</HI>—I imagine
you smiling at my important Criticism, and ready to
reply—that tho' the present <HI>French</HI> are not famous
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
for adoring their Wives, yet those in the good old
unrefin'd Days of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> might. If they do not
now adore their Wives, they perhaps do better, they
make them easy.</P>
<P>I shall long to renew the Pleasure your Play has
given me at its Representation. What Attention I
can contribute to the promoting of that, will greatly
be its own Reward. Mr. <HI>Dodington</HI> is expected, in a
few Days, from <HI>Ireland:</HI> He, I dare say, will warmly
favour it, from a double Cause—both the Love of the
fine Arts, and his own Pleasure. Had you but Players
equal to those <HI>Voltaire</HI> had, I would not doubt, in this
Instance, the Taste of our Countrymen—Almighty
Nature is every-where the same.</P>
<P>Soon I propose to fix in Town for the Winter,
during which time I hope to pass several happy Even∣ings
in your Company: Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> earnestly wishes
the same. Believe me to be, most affectionately and
sincerely,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Aug. 23. 1735.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>UPON my Return to Town, from Mr. <HI>Do∣dington</HI>'s
Seat in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> where I had for
some time been, I found your Letter, about a Month
after its Date: Had it been sent me in the Country,
I could not have neglected, till now, acknowledging
the Pleasure it, and the Packet of Prompters you sent
along with it, gave me. Tho' very happy in the
Company where I then was, yet cannot I help sin∣cerely
regretting the Loss of that Entertainment to
which you was so good as to give me an Invitation.
With the greatest Pleasure would I have beheld, and
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
with the greatest Zeal would I have countenanc'd, to
the utmost of my little Power, the Revival of <HI>Action,</HI>
which seems on all our Theatres to be now both dead
and rotten. A Friend of mine, who was there, did
not, by what he told me, soften my Loss.</P>
<P>I was very much enlighten'd and warm'd by the
Prompters upon <HI>Action:</HI> They present no less a
strong and beautiful Idea of what <HI>Actors</HI> ought to be,
than a mortifying one of what they are. As the
Stage is a powerful School of humane polite Morality,
so nothing can contribute more to barbarize the Age
than the present Condition of ours. There, human
Nature is represented in as aukward, false, and mon∣strous
a Manner, as the human Form was in antient
<HI>Gothic</HI> Sculpture and Painting. If that were all, it
might be laugh'd at, and contemn'd: But since it
tends, at the same time, to confound the Head, and
corrupt the Heart; since Crouds grow stupid, or
barbarous, as they gaze; who can consider it in that
View, without feeling an honest Indignation? And
what crowns the Misfortune is, that there is no Hope
of its ever being otherwise: The Root of the Evil
lies too deep to be pluck'd up. Was there ever an
equal Absurdity heard of, among a civiliz'd People?
That such an important public Diversion, the School
which forms the Manners of the Age, should be made
the Property of private Persons; who, did they hap∣pen
in the first Instance, by an infinite Chance, to be
Judges of the Matter, yet may transfer that Property
to the most profligate, tasteless, and ignorant of Man∣kind!
But this, alas! is only one of the Pillars of
that vast Temple of <HI>Corruption,</HI> under which this Ge∣neration,
more than any other that ever boasted
Freedom, worships the dirty, low-minded, insa∣tiable
Idol of Self-interest. Even to this Idol is
every public Work, which we have the Soul to at∣tempt,
made an immediate Sacrifice.—You see how
much your <HI>Prompters</HI> have inflam'd me; and the
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
melancholy Conclusion I draw from all is, that I
never hope to see Gentlemen of equal Genius, Taste,
Judgment, and Generosity of Heart, to the Author
of these Prompters, at the Head of our Theatres. I
may, however, very well live to see all Poetry re∣duced
to Magazine-Miscellanies, all Plays to Mum∣mery
Entertainments, and, in short, all Learning
absorb'd into the Sink of hireling scurrilous News-Papers.
Pardon this Supposition in a Letter to one,
who, while he I ves, will never suffer it wholly to
take Place: In the mean time, go on to stem the
Torrent of Barbarism. I wish you could find an
Assistant, tho' never so weak a one, in,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>May 11. 1736.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IT is far from being the want of a due Sense of
the Honour, your two last Letters did me, that has
prevented my thanking you for them before now:
The Truth is, they plung'd me so deep into your
Debt, that I was dispirited, thro' mere Despair, of
clearing it. But now I am rather willing to declare
myself an irrecoverable Bankrupt, than any longer
neglect to acknowledge the refin'd Pleasure, which
your generous Approbation of my late Performance
gives me—I call it generous, that Epithet having a
peculiar Relation to whatever you do; besides, I can∣not
help being afraid that it must, in a great measure,
proceed from so humane a Cause. In the mean time,
however that be, I will avow, that I am justly proud
of, charm'd with, and most agreeably rewarded by,
your good Opinion of my Poem. Allow me here,
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
by the bye, to remark, that tho' Poets have been
long us'd to this truly-spiritual and almost only Emo∣lument
arising from their Works; yet I doubt much,
if Booksellers have any manner of Relish for it: I
think, therefore (notwithstanding that the Ghosts of
many Authors walk unreveng'd), of annulling the
Bargain I made with mine, who would else be a con∣siderable
Loser, by the Paper, Printing, and Publi∣cation,
of <HI>Liberty.</HI> As I shall, in this Case, be pos∣sess'd
of the intire Property of it again, I propose, in
a Year or two hence, to give a new Edition of it;
and beg that you would, ere then, enrich me with
some Criticisms, which I hope I shall have the Grace
to relish as well as Praises.</P>
<P>Your Observation, with regard to political Cor∣ruption,
like natural, when come to a Crisis, pro∣ducing
more exalted Scenes of Animation, is fine,
and pleases by the future Prospect it opens; but it
awakens, at the same time, a Sentiment no less mor∣tifying,
should we find our Lot cast in the Times of
Putrefaction; should we find ourselves devoted, in
an anti-heroic Manner, for the Good of Posterity. I
wish, heartily, that I could refute what you likewise
observe with regard to the Cause of this Corruption.
Certainly the kind Exchanger of the Super-abundance
for the Sweets and Elegancies of Life, is itself cor∣rupted,
and its Gifts abus'd, from the want of Taste:
For whence is it, save the Want of Taste, that the
continual Tides of Riches, pour'd in upon this Na∣tion
by Commerce, have been lost again in a Gulph
of ungraceful, inelegant, inglorious Luxury? But
whence, you will say, this want of Taste? Whence
this sordid Turn to cautious Time-serving, Money-making,
sneaking Prudence, instead of regardless,
unfetter'd Virtue? To private Jobs, instead of public
Works? To profitable, instead of fine Arts? To
Gain, instead of Glory? In a Word, to the whole
venal System of modern Administration? And to
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
those gross perishing Luxuries, that reconcile, at once,
Avarice and Profusion, centering all in Self, and even
in the meanest, the material Part of Self. This
Disquisition, I am afraid, would very near lead me
back again to your Observation. It must be own'd,
however, that the better Genius of this Nation has
often nobly exerted itself, and will struggle hard be∣fore
it expire. With regard to Arts and Learning,
one may venture to say, that they might yet stand
their Ground, were they but merely protected. In
lieu of all Patrons that have been, are, or will be, in
<HI>England,</HI> I wish we had one good Act of Parliament
for securing to Authors the Property of their own
Works; and that the Stage were put upon the Foot∣ing
of common Sense and Humanity. And can it
be, that those who impress Paper with what consti∣tutes
the best and everlasting Riches of all civiliz'd
Nations, and of all Ages, should have less Property
in the Paper, so enrich'd, than those who deal in the
Rags, which make that Paper? Can it be, that the
great, the delightful School of Manners, should be
abandon'd to common Sale, and become the Pro∣perty
of any one, who can purchase it, to be, per∣haps,
the School of Folly, and Corruption?—A Si∣mony
this, in <HI>Virtue</HI>; which, if not so wicked, yet
is as pernicious as that in <HI>Religion.</HI> What would
<HI>Athenians</HI> have said to this! what Laughter, what
Contempt, what Indignation, would it have rais'd
among them!</P>
<P>Now that I mention the Stage, I must still insist
upon my Copy of that only humane new Entertain∣ment
I have seen upon it of late. I know not what
<HI>Gothic</HI> Devil possess'd the Maid at my Lodgings, but
my few Books must not be so robb'd of the Honour
of boasting <HI>Zara</HI> among them from its Author.
Having been tantaliz'd lately by seeing you at a Di∣stance,
I wish you would be so good as to make me
Amends some Evening, and let me know of it a few

same time, engage him. Poor Mr. <HI>Savage</HI> would be
happy to pass an Evening with you; his Heart burns

how to find him, requires more Intelligence than is

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Morning.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAD answer'd yours last Night, but it came to
my Hands as I was dressing, about Half an Hour
before the Play began.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82"/>
I confess I am under some Difficulty, how to ac∣count
for the Failure of so good a Play. But not∣withstanding
its present Reception, I am positively,
and absolutely of Opinion, that after it has slept some
time, it will appear again upon the Stage, with a
much better Grace, and continue in the Stock in the
first Form of Tragedy for ever. My Reasons for this
are, as follow:</P>
<P>If you please to remember, I hinted to you, that
(as the Town has been lately led, and manag'd) there
was a kind of Necessity to form and prepare a strong
Body to support even its real Merit in the first Run
of it; and I have often thought the best Tragedy not
supported by this necessary, scandalous Artifice, would
naturally sink in five or six Days, at most: The Fate
of <HI>K. H.</HI> has sufficiently confirm'd that Opinion.</P>
<P>However, tho' there is a good deal in what is
above-mention'd, I take the main Cause of its Fail∣ure
to proceed from what follows.</P>
<P>I find by some few Persons, who are highly pleas'd
with that noble Simplicity, and Decency, that runs
quite through the Play, that the Multitude in general
look on it, not as a <HI>new</HI> Play, but as a Play <HI>alter'd</HI>
from <HI>Shakespear:</HI> The many Beauties you have im∣prov'd
from him, and some noted Speeches, you have
made use of with no very material Alterations (which
was certainly well judg'd), have possess'd the gross
Imaginations of the Audience, that most of the fine
Passages of your own, are his too; the two Speeches
of <HI>Justice,</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> at the Council-Table, and
<HI>Harry</HI>'s Reflection, when he first hears of the Trea∣son,
are universally mistaken for <HI>Shakespear:</HI> This I
have found from some, whose Education, Under∣standing,
and Acquaintance with <HI>Shakespear,</HI> I ima∣gin'd,
might have taught 'em better: And yet their
knowing his Manner of Writing so well, perhaps,
might the sooner lead 'em into the Mistake.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83"/>
Add to this, that some Understrappers of <HI>Parnassus,</HI>
and the Partizans of t'other House, have improv'd
this Notion of its being a Play of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s not
<HI>very much</HI> alter'd. Now, Sir, allowing what I have
observ'd above to be certainly the Game play'd upon
K. <HI>H.</HI> I can no longer wonder, that his Success is
little more, than what a good reviv'd Play commonly
meets with.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to profane K. <HI>H.</HI> with
odious Comparisons; but give me Leave to observe
to you, that <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r</HI> once brought the <HI>Double Gallant</HI>
upon the Stage, which was made up of Hints stolen
from a Play of <HI>Burnaby</HI>'s, and another of <HI>Centlivre</HI>'s,
both heartily damn'd the first Night, many Years be∣fore;
as soon as the good-natur'd Town found him
out, they resented his calling it a new Play, and
hounded it in the most outrageous Manner. Two
Years after we reviv'd it, it met with most extra∣vagant
Success, and it has continu'd in the Stock ever
since, and never fails of a great Audience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kind Impostor,</HI> tho' taken (I mean the Hints
only) from a Translation of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Play acted
about Thirty Years ago, was damn'd, at its first Ap∣pearance,
only because it was call'd a new Play; but
was reviv'd some time after, and met with universal
Approbation, like the former, and is generally acted
twice every Year.</P>
<P><HI>King Lear,</HI> and <HI>Timon of Athens,</HI> met with the
same Fate, from the same Reasons, at their first Ap∣pearance;
but have both prov'd excellent Stock-Plays
upon their being reviv'd.</P>
<P>Thus, if it can be artfully insinuated to the Town,
that the Managers, or an Author, would pass an <HI>alter'd</HI>
Play upon 'em for a <HI>new</HI> one, <HI>That</HI> alone would
make 'em outrageous after three or four Days, and
give the Multitude an Opportunity (which they never
let slip) of exerting their proper Qualities. Audiences
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
are never guided by Reason, but always by Prepos∣session.</P>
<P>I believe, when you fairly consider what I have said
to you, the present Disappointment will give you less
Surprize. I assure you, the Play was more applauded
the second Night, than the first; because it was infi∣nitely
better acted. As to my own Part, the Con∣cern
I was under for the Success of it, the first Night,
threw me into the utmost Confusion. I should be
extremely pleas'd, if you would give yourself the
Trouble of seeing it acted To-morrow Night. Come
but behind the Scenes, and we will place you in some
Corner, where you shall be invisible to the Audience.
Dear Sir, let me prevail upon you to come. I like
your Preface; there is a very decent Scorn, and a
mettled Contempt of the Town, in it. You have
hinder'd me from going to Church this Morning, and
I have tir'd your Patience, to be reveng'd of you.

and was infinitely more applauded and follow'd
for many Years.—We know what Reception <HI>Pa∣radise
Lost</HI> met with in the Author's Life-time.—In
short, <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> were full as partial, or rather
heedless, in observing the Merit of living Authors, as
<HI>London.</HI>—In the former City, <HI>Fannius</HI> had more
Hearers than <HI>Horace.</HI>—In the latter City, <HI>Euripides,</HI>
so justly admir'd by all Posterity, could not stand the
Ridicule of <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> but chose to die in volun∣tary
Banishment, to avoid the Flouts of the People;
and we may conclude, that <HI>Sophocles</HI> himself escap'd
the Burlesque of that Buffoon Comic (for such he
was, notwithstanding his Merit in other Respects),
only because he was a Man of Quality and Fortune.—So that, upon the Whole, I may venture to affirm,
that Posterity only will do Justice to Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> who
was ever above the low Artifice of forming Cabals to
support his Reputation.—Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was so sensible
of this Truth, that he took <HI>whole Years</HI> to bespeak
and court Friends, in order to secure the Success of
<HI>Cato.</HI>—And is it not thus with Preferments in ge∣neral,
both civil and ecclesiastical? Do not the Me∣ritorious
fail, while the industrious Levée-Haunter
runs away with the Prize?</P>

I take the Liberty of saying thus much to you
upon this Subject, because I have been told, you are
determin'd to write no more for the Stage: I con∣fess,
I would a little soften that Resolution, if I could,
in regard to Mr. <HI>V<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r,</HI> and hope to prevail upon
you to touch up his Tragedy, and make it fit for the
Stage: And when I assure you, that your Assistance
in this Affair may be a Means to make him easy, and
happy in his Circumstances, I flatter myself, that
your generous Disposition will need no other Motive
to engage you in so good an Office—I am, dear Sir,

<P>I AM every way oblig'd to you, and shall ever

<P>As to the Affairs of the Playhouse, Half a Dozen
such Farces, as <HI>The Devil in the Wine-Cellar,</HI> and
one Pantomime, would restore <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>—But
where shall we find them? I long to talk with you
on this Subject, and upon another of much greater
Consequence to me, I mean my Health. I have not
forgot the Drops you brought me, but I durst not
take them at that Time, because I dreaded the Colic,
which has now left me.—You are sensible, Sir, to
what little Purpose it is to talk of Jaundices, over∣heated
Blood, Obstructions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unless it be with
the Unhappy, who have felt those Distempers.—Till
I was sick myself, I had as confus'd a Notion of the
Disorders occasion'd by a Fever, as the <HI>Deaf</HI> have of

I know Mr. <HI>V<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r fancies,</HI> I could <HI>act,</HI> I pleas'd;
but he is mistaken—at least he thinks, I could <HI>speak</HI> a
<HI>Prologue</HI>; but he is mistaken in <HI>that</HI> too.—I have
often told him, I am not able—and that I am so un∣happy,
at this Time, is a double Affliction to me; be∣cause
Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> seems to <HI>wish</HI> I would do it, in so en∣gaging
a Manner, that all Excuses, but that of Inca∣pacity,
would be unpardonable.</P>
<P>I had answer'd yours sooner, had I not been pre∣vented
from writing by this open, warm Weather,
which is too apt to discompose me. A hard Frost
agrees best with me.</P>
<P>I have a thousand Things to say to you. You will

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>FROM the Observations you have been pleas'd
to make of the Conduct, Sentiments, and
Diction, of <HI>Eurydice</HI>; permit me to say, that, with∣out
Exception, I think you the best Judge of Dra∣matic
Performance, in all its Branches, I have ever
known. It were to be wish'd, that every Spectator
had your Penetration, and could so justly distinguish
the different Passions, and the Manner of working
'em.—No Actor, then, could hope for a favourable
Reception, but from his Endeavours, upon all Occa∣sions,
to copy Nature: But, alas! the Taste, in ge∣neral,
is so deprav'd, that there is little or no Ap∣plause
to be gain'd, in Tragedy, but at the Expence
of <HI>Lungs.</HI> I am, therefore, the less concern'd, that
(by the Course of Years) I have Reason to think my∣self
so near my <HI>Exit.</HI> I should be proud, however,
of an Opportunity to tell you how much I am,</P>

<P>I HAVE read your Play with vast Pleasure, and
Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> highly approves of it; but, if <HI>Athel∣wold</HI>
be the Part you design for me, I have too much
Reason to fear, that 'tis next to impossible, at my
Time of Day, to do it common Justice; and if I
decline it, from a thorough Conviction of my own
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
Insufficiency (which is truly the Case), I am sure, I
may depend upon your Justice, and Good-nature, to
excuse me.</P>
<P>I should be very sorry, after some little Success in
my Business, to run the Hazard of falling under your
Censure, by a very weak Performance of so capital a
Part, which requires not only more Youth and Vigour,
than I am Master of; but all the Requisites, that are
necessary to form a complete Actor.</P>
<P>If you will be pleas'd to let me know, in what
Manner you design to cast it, I will order the Parts to
be writ out immediately, that it may be ready for
acting, about the Time you mention. I am,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bow-str. <DATE>Oct. 10. 1731.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IF I said any thing about the Part of <HI>Athelwold,</HI>
that amounted to a Promise, it was from the
strong Desire which I had to appear in a Play, so
highly, and so deservedly recommended; but, to <HI>my
greater Mortification,</HI> I find, that the Affair of Tra∣gedy
(at least for any Continuance) is over with me:
I may, perhaps, rub thro' my Parts in Comedy; but
daily Experience teaches me, that it is absolutely out
of my Power to support the Weight of such a Cha∣racter
as <HI>Athelwold,</HI> during the Run of a new Play,
that, I am persuaded, must make its Way, in spite of
Prejudice.</P>
<P>If any-body should make me the Compliment of
asking, why I did not appear in the Part of <HI>Athelwold,</HI>
I shall deal frankly with him, as I have done with
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
you, and tell him the true Reason; and my Senti∣ments
of the Play will be better justify'd, by the
Manner in which I speak of it every where.</P>
<P>You are so obliging to ask me (in case the Play
were to come on without me), Who else will be ca∣pable
of supporting the Character of <HI>Athelwold?</HI>—Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> with your Instructions, I am sure, will do
it well; and he must be a wretched Actor, indeed,
who is not qualify'd to enter into the Beauties of the
most difficult Part, by the Assistance, which you are
able to give him: And whoever has the Pleasure of
conversing with Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> will be fully convinc'd of
this Truth. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obliged,
and obedient humble Servant,
R. WILKS.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I am far from having chang'd my Opinion,
as to the Merits of the Play; and I heartily
wish, it were as much in my Power, as it is in
my Inclination, to act conformably to your Sen∣timents,
in every thing.</P>
