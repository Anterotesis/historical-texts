<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE following <HI>Essay</HI> was writ∣ten to instruct all sober and serious Persons, how to pre∣serve, or regain their Health; but chiefly to direct and relieve my <HI>Fellow-sufferers,</HI> the <HI>Scorbutic, Gouty, Consumptive,</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Valetudinarian-low-livers; to make them pass their Lives the most com∣fortably, the <HI>Degree</HI> of their Distem∣pers, the <HI>Time</HI> of Life, the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, and the secret Orders of <HI>Provi∣dence,</HI> will permit. And since they must be deprived, in some Degree, of the <HI>grosser</HI> sensual Pleasures; since all sen∣tient and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings are made for Happiness, will by mere <HI>Instinct,</HI> seek it <HI>some-how,</HI> and some-where; since their necessary <HI>Low-living</HI> will na∣turally
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
(in time at least) make them <HI>high-spirited,</HI> and their <HI>intellectual Or∣gans</HI> more acute, <HI>penetrating,</HI> and <HI>de∣licate</HI>; I have endeavour'd, by the fol∣lowing <HI>Discourses,</HI> to supply them with some suitable <HI>Entertainments</HI> and <HI>Amuse∣ments,</HI> such as I have often agreeably diverted my leisure Hours with.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>True Philosophy</HI> is the <HI>Science</HI> of living the most happily, through the whole <HI>Period</HI> of our Existence, the Na∣ture of things will permit; <HI>Physic</HI> is but one Branch of this <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and regards but one part of our Composition, and but for a small <HI>Period</HI> of our Du∣ration. <HI>True Philosophy</HI> takes in the whole Extent of our Being, from its most distant Beginning, to its most advanced Stages, possible or conceiveable. True Physic is that only which directs how the Body may be preserved the most <HI>health∣ful,</HI> the intellectual Organs depending on the Body the most acute, the <HI>Senses</HI> the most perfect, and the <HI>Limbs</HI> the most
<PB N="iii" REF="6"/>
active; not for a while only, and by Fits and Starts, but uniformly, as long as <HI>they</HI> were made to last, and as the <HI>original</HI> Frame and Texture will permit: Any thing less than this, is but as a Part to the Whole; an imperfect and unfinish'd <HI>Sketch</HI> of such a <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and such a <HI>Physic,</HI> their Theory and <HI>Principles,</HI> was intended by the following <HI>Essay</HI> and <HI>Discourses.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They were composed at different Times, and on different Occasions; but one general <HI>Scheme,</HI> and one manner of <HI>free philosophizing,</HI> and <HI>easy Conjectur∣ing,</HI> runs through them all; one, to wit, where the fundamental <HI>Truth,</HI> or <HI>Propo∣sition</HI> in general, is suppos'd either <HI>al∣low'd, reveal'd,</HI> or already <HI>demonstrated.</HI> But the <HI>Why?</HI> the <HI>final Causes,</HI> the <HI>moral Consequences,</HI> and the particular <HI>De∣tail,</HI> is only here conjectured about, from probable or <HI>philosophic Principles.</HI> This necessarily makes them more <HI>loose, un∣guarded,</HI> and <HI>immethodical,</HI> and the
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>
same things to be often repeated. But I had neither <HI>Leisure, Relish,</HI> nor <HI>Strength of Application,</HI> to remedy these Faults; it would have cost me more <HI>Trouble</HI> than the first <HI>Composure.</HI> All I could obtain of myself, was to make a short, more distinct <HI>Abstract</HI> of the whole, and join a few <HI>Explications,</HI> to prevent <HI>Cavil,</HI> and all <HI>Mistakes</HI> not wilful and disingenuous, if possible.</P>
<P N="4">4. I am very sensible, by this Work, I shall make myself obnoxious to two very different kinds of Men, the <HI>Stiff, Rigid,</HI> and <HI>Precise</HI>; and the <HI>Licentious, Un∣guarded, Spurious, Free-Thinkers.</HI> The <HI>first,</HI> very probably, will censure my <HI>Conjectures</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> as <HI>dan∣gerous,</HI> and <HI>presumptuous,</HI> and <HI>myself,</HI> as being <HI>wise above what is written,</HI> and arrogantly prying into the <HI>Secrets</HI> of in∣finit Wisdom. It is very possible I may have been <HI>faulty,</HI> in this particular. I am sen∣sible, that some even undoubted <HI>Truths,</HI> that may hurt the <HI>Weak,</HI> ought to be concealed,
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
or enjoy'd only in secret; the same Degrees of <HI>Light</HI> not being equally <HI>luminous</HI> and <HI>perceptive</HI> to all Eyes. But since <HI>old Men,</HI> and Valetudinarians especially, be∣come, as it were, <HI>Children</HI> a second time, and, in their <HI>second Childhood, those</HI> must have their <HI>Rattles</HI> as well as these; I thought it safer, as I am sure it is much more entertaining, to play with <HI>Ideas, philosophic Conjectures,</HI> and such <HI>Amusements,</HI> how weakly soever founded, as tend to make <HI>Virtue</HI> and its <HI>Source</HI> ami∣able, justify the <HI>Conduct of Providence,</HI> and mend and rejoice the <HI>Heart</HI> without hurting the <HI>Head,</HI> than to dwell on the dark Side of Things, that lead to <HI>Pyrrhonism, Fatalism, Infidelity,</HI> and <HI>Despair.</HI> If I thought I had advanced any thing <HI>dero∣gatory</HI> from the <HI>Amiableness</HI> of infinit Perfection, <HI>contrary</HI> to the Doctrine of the earliest and purest Times of <HI>Chri∣stianity, contradictory</HI> to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Faith, and the <HI>Form of sound Words,</HI> I had committed these <HI>Sheets</HI> to the <HI>Flames,</HI> with the <HI>Hand</HI> of their <HI>Author,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="9"/>
before I had published them. But, on the contrary, I hoped they might agree∣ably entertain my <HI>Valetudinarian,</HI> who being placed by his low Health, in the <HI>middle State,</HI> between both <HI>Worlds,</HI> the <HI>old</HI> and the <HI>new,</HI> must unavoidably, at some times, <HI>figure</HI> to himself some sort of a <HI>Map</HI> of the next World. I was therefore willing to try to <HI>illuminat</HI> it, the best I could, and to trace some of the <HI>Out-lines</HI> of the <HI>Passages</HI> from <HI>this</HI> to <HI>that Man∣sion</HI>; by endeavouring to <HI>illustrat,</HI> from not so common a Set of <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> some great and fundamental <HI>Truths,</HI> establish'd on more <HI>popular Proofs,</HI> viz. that there is no Possibility of Happiness here or hereafter, without <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life</HI>; and that the true <HI>Reason</HI> of the present <HI>Darkness,</HI> both in <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Revelation,</HI> is the Difficulty of recovering this <HI>Pu∣rity of Heart and Life,</HI> to its utmost Perfection, in free <HI>lapsed</HI> Intelligences, consistent with their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Divine Attributes,
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>
which infinit <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> will not, I might say, cannot, counter act.</P>
<P N="5">5. I apprehend less Quarter from the opposit <HI>Set</HI> of Men, who may honour me with <HI>Enthusiasm, Romanceing,</HI> and <HI>Castle-building,</HI> without any solid Foun∣dation. All I have to say is, that per∣haps my Manner of explaining some great and fundamental Truths, and a few of the Consequences I draw by my <HI>Method,</HI> may be defective: And perhaps, from some of the <HI>Links</HI> being dropt, and from Faults in the <HI>wording,</HI> the <HI>Chain</HI> of the Reasoning may not be always <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>strong</HI>; but I am sure the <HI>Foundation</HI> is <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> and allow'd to be such by all <HI>true Philosophers</HI>; and without it, all <HI>general</HI> and <HI>abstracted</HI> Reasoning (on these <HI>imperceptible</HI> Subjects) must be vain; I mean, without admitting <HI>Ana∣logy:</HI> For without supposing the Evidence and Probability of it, (it being in <HI>Things</HI> only, what <HI>Proportion</HI> is in <HI>Numbers,</HI> and its <HI>Progressions</HI> being only
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>
like the higher and subsequent Terms of a <HI>Series</HI> in <HI>Algebra,</HI> from some of the first and simplest <HI>Terms</HI> being given) no <HI>general Laws,</HI> nor <HI>universal Proposi∣tions,</HI> can be found out, in <HI>Mathema∣ticks, Philosophy,</HI> or <HI>Morality.</HI> For <HI>Induction,</HI> either in <HI>Experiment, Ob∣servation,</HI> or <HI>Calculation,</HI> must be al∣ways <HI>particular</HI> and limited. Perhaps the <HI>Method,</HI> when managed by a <HI>clearer Head,</HI> and a more <HI>solid Judgment,</HI> may become a noble <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>divine Know∣ledge,</HI> and a <HI>sublime Philosophy. Ma∣thematicians</HI> well know, that there are several different <HI>Methods</HI> of investigating the same Propositions in <HI>Algebra</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI>; and there is scarce a <HI>Geo∣meter,</HI> but has his own <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>In∣vestigation.</HI> The same Conclusions, drawn from different demonstrated <HI>Truths,</HI> give a sensible <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and a stronger <HI>Con∣viction,</HI> to an honest Heart, and a Lover of Truth; and I could not but be de∣lighted with the <HI>Universality, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Luminousness</HI> of the <HI>Method</HI> of
<PB N="ix" REF="12"/>
<HI>Analogy,</HI> and the other Principles I have laid down in the following <HI>Dis∣courses,</HI> not having met with an <HI>Ob∣jection, Difficulty,</HI> or even a <HI>Puzzle</HI> al∣most, in <HI>Nature, Providence,</HI> or <HI>Reve∣lation,</HI> which had not an easy, consequen∣tial or probable Solution from them, which is, at least, a Prejudice in their Favour. I had nothing to do, but to try the <HI>Diffi∣culty,</HI> in its most simple and obvious Cases, (as I used to do in <HI>Algebra,</HI> to find out <HI>universal Canons</HI>) and atten∣tively to observe the Conditions of the <HI>Progression,</HI> till the higher Terms in∣volved the Complication.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are some Persons made so by <HI>Nature,</HI> that they are <HI>slow, dark, gloomy, joyless, puzzling,</HI> and <HI>perplexing,</HI> and they pass for the wise, prudent, guarded Men of the <HI>World:</HI> They may attack <HI>Error,</HI> but seldom find out <HI>Truth</HI> by themselves; like the <HI>Scuttle-fish,</HI> they spout out their own <HI>black Liquor</HI> on the <HI>pellucid Element.</HI> If they are <HI>honest</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="13"/>
and <HI>sincere,</HI> they are much to be pitied, and are to be treated with <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> being in the State of those born <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> and so destitute of the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life. They must do the best they can, and be charitably supplied, and with Docility be willing to be led by others; and thus, tho' their Trial might be <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>severe,</HI> yet their Victory would be <HI>merito∣rious</HI> and <HI>glorious.</HI> But, on the contrary, it often happens, that <HI>Licentiousness, Self-sufficiency,</HI> and a supercilious Con∣tempt of others, are the true Causes of their <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Indigence,</HI> and that they have themselves, by wrong or no Cul∣ture, stunted the <HI>Organs</HI> of their Facul∣ties, and by a perpetual <HI>Mal-regimen</HI> have distorted them.</P>
<P N="7">7. I take <HI>common Happiness,</HI> in our natural State at present, to lie in the Pursuit of the general Measures of Think∣ing, Acting and Living, follow'd by the greatest part of the middling Rank of
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>
our <HI>Species</HI> (as it is in their Order in other <HI>Animals</HI>); and <HI>common Sense</HI> (as it is distinguished from culti∣vated and refin'd Sense) to lie in assent∣ing and conforming to the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> agreed upon explicitly or im∣plicitly, in the <HI>Community</HI> where Pro∣vidence has placed us, without some <HI>irre∣sistible,</HI> that is, <HI>miraculous</HI> Evidence, or a <HI>peaceable, silent,</HI> and not <HI>inter∣meddling</HI> Self-conviction to the contrary. And he who pretends to be <HI>happy,</HI> as to his outward Circumstances, out of <HI>com∣mon Life,</HI> or <HI>wise</HI> as to intellectual En∣dowments, out of <HI>common Sense,</HI> in Things on a Level with his <HI>Occupation</HI> and <HI>Education</HI>; I take him always to labour under some undiscover'd <HI>chronical nervous</HI> Distemper, be the other Appear∣ances what they will, and have been sel∣dom mistaken in a <HI>particular Case.</HI> For tho' a <HI>sound Mind</HI> be not the <HI>only</HI> sure Evidence of a <HI>sound Body,</HI> yet it will always shew, that none of the great <HI>Organs</HI> of Life is intirely spoilt, or greatly <HI>damaged,</HI> however tender and
<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>
delicate they may be. It is more difficult, than perhaps most Men are aware of, to determin, with any Degree of Exactness, the <HI>Limits</HI> that separat <HI>Wisdom</HI> from <HI>Folly, Wrong-headedness</HI> from <HI>intel∣lectual Sanity</HI>; the most perfect Man here has a <HI>Mixture</HI> of both: <HI>Optimus ille, qui minimis urgetur.</HI> Certain it is, that <HI>true Wisdom,</HI> and a <HI>sound Mind,</HI> consists in first <HI>pondering,</HI> and then <HI>doing,</HI> every thing as near as we can, with <HI>Order, Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure:</HI> But since <HI>Precision</HI> is incom∣patible with <HI>Finitude,</HI> if we endeavour to be constantly <HI>progressive</HI> towards Per∣fection, tho' by gentle Steps, neither stop∣ping nor turning aside, but doing the best we can without <HI>Scrupulosity,</HI> and gene∣rously hopeing and believeing, that infinit Wisdom and Goodness has, or will supply the <HI>rest,</HI> in his own Time and Manner, <HI>we cannot fail.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Were I to <HI>choose</HI> for myself, con∣sidering the many certain <HI>Miseries</HI> and
<PB N="xiii" REF="16"/>
Temptations of this State of <HI>Probation,</HI> the <HI>few</HI> uncertain <HI>Antidotes,</HI> and much <HI>fewer</HI> sincere, durable, and real <HI>Plea∣sures</HI>; I had much rather have the weaker, than the stronger <HI>System</HI> of Nerves, within the <HI>Extremes.</HI> I had rather choose to be contented with the <HI>slight</HI> and <HI>slender,</HI> than covet the strong and <HI>pungent</HI> Pleasures. I had rather be happy in a <HI>Dream,</HI> than miserable <HI>awake.</HI> In a word, I had rather choose to be an innocent, benevolent, tho' weaker and more <HI>credulous</HI> Person, than a <HI>malicious, critical, spurious Free-think∣er,</HI> even with regard to this Life only. They most certainly are, <HI>comparatively, unhappy</HI> and <HI>joyless</HI> in themseves, and are <HI>unharmoniously</HI> fram'd, in <HI>Body</HI> as well as <HI>Mind,</HI> who can delight, and employ their <HI>Talents,</HI> on throwing <HI>Dark∣ness</HI> and <HI>Doubts</HI> even on the imaginary Happiness (suppose it such) of their <HI>Fellow-Creatures:</HI> Nothing but <HI>Ran∣cour,</HI> and <HI>acrid Juices,</HI> could be pleased with tearing and destroying <HI>Childrens</HI>
<PB N="xiv" REF="17"/>
<HI>Play-things</HI>; and the wisest Man here is comparatively but a <HI>Child.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. As to myself, I can <HI>honestly affirm,</HI> I have had but <HI>one</HI> uniform manner of thinking in <HI>Philosophy, Phy∣sic,</HI> and <HI>Divinity,</HI> in the main, ever since my Thoughts were <HI>fix'd,</HI> and my Principles <HI>establish'd:</HI> They may have had <HI>Alterna∣tives</HI> of greater <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkness,</HI> occasionally and transiently, according to the <HI>State</HI> of my <HI>Spirits, Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI>; but in the <HI>Heart of my Soul</HI> (so to speak) I have been uni∣form, and under the same <HI>Convictions,</HI> as to the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of these <HI>Sciences</HI>; and always thought <HI>spurious Free-Thinkers, active Latitudinarians,</HI> and <HI>Apostolic Infidels,</HI> (it being a Contra∣diction they can be certain in their <HI>Ne∣gative</HI> Opinions, or by them when propa∣gated, should do any Good to their Fellow-Creatures, but an infinit deal of Hurt) under some obstinat bodily Distemper, and much more proper Subjects for <HI>Me∣dicin</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="18"/>
than <HI>Argument</HI>; and that a <HI>low Diet,</HI> long and obstinatly persisted in, would at last cure both their Body and their Mind, so far as it depends on the Body, especially where Vice and Infidelity have not become habitual, as they certainly have in old Sinners: As I firmly believe, and am as much convinced as I am of any natural Effect, that Water-drink∣ing only will preserve all the Opulent healthy from every mortal Distemper, bateing Accidents, hereditary and epi∣demical Diseases; and that a Diet of Milk and Seeds, with Water-drinking only, duly continued, and prudently ma∣naged, with proper Evacuation, Air and Exercise, is the most infallible <HI>Antidote</HI> for all the obstinat Diseases of the Body, and Distemperature of the Mind, so far as it depends on the Body, the present State of Things will permit; and that it will cure every Disorder in the Body, cureable, and render the <HI>Distempera∣ture</HI> of the Mind more tractable; and that, in all Events, it will make both
<PB N="xvi" REF="19"/>
more tolerable, than they can possibly be otherwise. This <HI>Regimen</HI> I have for these twenty Years, first and last, pur∣sued, and shall, with the Divine Aid, persist in it to my last Moments; hi∣therto, I thank GOD, with as much Vivacity, Health and Activity, as can be expected at my time of Life, under such a gouty, scorbutic and nervous Habit. The State of my Intellectuals will be best known by the following Dis∣courses, which were design'd to <HI>illustrate</HI> the <HI>Principles, Theory,</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Uses of <HI>philosophical Medicin.</HI> The <HI>practi∣cal Inferences,</HI> and the <HI>Conclusions</HI> drawn from them in particular Cases and Diseases, confirm'd by forty Years Experience and Observation, will follow in due Time, in a Treatise intitled, <HI>The natural Method of Cure in the Diseases of the Body, and Distempers of the Mind thereon depending</HI>; if GOD shall see fit, by the Preservation of my <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Faculties.</HI></P>

Robustness, and great Action, would be tor∣tur'd, and languish under Bread and Water in ever so great Plenty: <HI>Milk, Fruits, Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in any Perfection, are of much greater Expence and Labour to procure, than that the Poor and Necessitous now can afford them, especially in <HI>Northern Climats</HI>; they have lost their Vigour, Energy and Balsam, since the Deluge.

If upon takeing away a few Ounces of Blood only out of a large <HI>Orifice,</HI> the <HI>Curd</HI> is found too thin, tender, watery, and
<PB N="xviii" REF="42"/>
too readily <HI>fusible,</HI> or dissolvible in warm Water, and the <HI>Serum</HI> too clear, whiteish, or in too great a Quantity; a <HI>Milk, Seed</HI> and <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI> is by no means to be longer continued in, but is to be altered gradually into light, sweet and young <HI>animal</HI> Food, and temperat fermented Liquors. 3. If after two, three, four or five Years, the Disorders for which a low cool Diet was advis'd and enter'd upon, with sufficient Strictness and Precision, is not cured, or greatly reliev'd, the Party may conclude, that a low cool Diet will not make a perfect Cure, and must with Patience, and a general Regularity, enter on common Life, and not be longer scrupulous, or anxious about <HI>Regimen,</HI> in the Quality, but in the Quantity, and submit to the Order of Provi∣dence, and use the Means that Experience or the best Advice suggests to alleviat the <HI>Sym∣ptoms,</HI> and do the best he can <HI>taliter qualiter,</HI> if he is under Fifty. 4. To such as have an original hereditary weakly <HI>scorbutical</HI> or <HI>scro∣phulous</HI> Habit, and are far advanced in Life; who have <HI>mesenteric glandular</HI> Obstructions, with feeble Solids, and little Strength and Vigour, a <HI>Milk, Seed</HI> and <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI> with <HI>aqueous</HI> Liquors, is by no means to be advis'd; for as the Case is absolutely incureable, it were in vain to torment and restrain them, more cruelly than their Distemper itself does; they must not be forbid, but rather indulged the common <HI>Comforts</HI> and <HI>Gratifications</HI> of Life. It is to such that St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Advice to <HI>Timothy</HI>
<PB N="xix" REF="43"/>
is just, as well as kind, <HI>to drink a little Wine for their Stomachs sake, and their often In∣firmities:</HI> A general Moderation, and an Ob∣servation of the <HI>Juvantia</HI> and <HI>Laedentia,</HI> is only to be advised, and the Use of these Means known to Art, to alleviat <HI>Symptoms.</HI> 5. In all <HI>eruptive</HI> Cases, in all acute and <HI>periodical</HI> cutaneous Cases, in the actual Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in the <HI>second Fever</HI> of the Small-Pox, in <HI>Fevers</HI> verging towards a <HI>Crise,</HI> to drive out from the Centre to the Circumference any changeable Disorder, and universally in all Cases where the <HI>vital Indications</HI> languish and labour, and Nature is in a Struggle to throw outward <HI>Morbosity</HI>; she is most cer∣tainly to be assisted by generous <HI>cordial</HI> and warmer Medicins, and higher <HI>Diet,</HI> to further the End Nature points at. These are some of the Cases where too low and cool a <HI>Regimen</HI> is by no means to be advised or pursued. 6. And <HI>lastly,</HI> Whenever the End of a low Diet is obtained, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>sweetning</HI> and <HI>thinning</HI> the Juices, and the <HI>Symptoms</HI> are abated or cured, the Diet is to be heighten'd, and gradually and cautiously rais'd, at least if the Party be under Fifty. I will now suggest as plainly, in what Cases I think it is to be advised and tried. As to the Healthy and Well, I have nothing here to say: <HI>Sufficient for the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI></P>

But it is most certain, that such <HI>Medicins, Drugs</HI> or Bodies, are the most destructive to animal Bodies, if long and in great Quantities thrown in, that Malice can invent, beyond Gun∣powder itself and even spirituous Liquors; for not only Nature has provided none such, but as <HI>Poisons</HI> in venomous Creatures to kill their Enemies, or cook them for their Food: but that the Particles of Fire, the most destructive of any, are so closely impacted and <HI>transubstan∣tiated</HI> in, as never to be afterwards sepa∣rated from them, and that their component <HI>Particles</HI> are so minutely divided by the <HI>Tor∣tures</HI> of the Fire, as to acquire such a Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> towards the Particles of animal Bodies; such a <HI>Polarity,</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Lister</HI> ob∣served, in all Calcinations, both of <HI>Vege∣tables</HI> and <HI>Minerals,</HI> so constantly to answer the <HI>Magnet</HI>) that they become Iron, <HI>Bristles,</HI> Nails and Lancets, darting directly and per∣pendicularly into the Solids, so as quickly to tear, rend and destroy, or fix them, and so can never be proper for <HI>Food</HI> or <HI>Physic</HI>; whereas <HI>Galenical</HI> Medicins, consisting of the <HI>integral Particles</HI> of <HI>Vegetables, Metals</HI> or <HI>Minerals,</HI>

dissolved only by gentle Heat and Moisture, in a watry <HI>Menstruum,</HI> have none of these <HI>deleterious</HI> Qualities on <HI>animal</HI> Bodies, but become their Food as well as Physic, and naturally take the Places of the morbid Particles of animal Habits, which Time and the natural <HI>Functions mecha∣nically</HI> throw off.

<P>§. 9. THE Benefits a Person who desires nothing but a <HI>clear Head</HI> and <HI>strong intellec∣tual Faculties,</HI> would reap by religiously drinking nothing but <HI>Water,</HI> (tepid or cold, as the Season is) while he is yet young, and tolerably healthy, well educated, and of a sober honest Disposition, are innumerable: As, 1. That he would live probably till towards an <HI>hundred</HI> Years of Age, that being the Term of Life appointed by the Design of the Creator, even after the <HI>Deluge,</HI> and after that eating of <HI>animal</HI> Food was permitted, before (as it is believ'd) <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors were invented; at least, if we have any regard for <HI>Moses</HI>'s History, which yet cannot be denied to be one
<PB N="xxv" REF="49"/>
of the justest Accounts of these early Times. 2. That he would thereby constantly enjoy a <HI>clear</HI> Head, <HI>calm,</HI> at least <HI>governable</HI> Passions, a Facility in <HI>intellectual</HI> Applications, and in the Acquisition of Virtue; and so having a longer Duration secur'd to him, and all Impedi∣ments removed, he might make surprizing and wonderful Advances in <HI>both.</HI> 3. He would thereby be secur'd against all the great <HI>atrocious</HI> and <HI>frightful</HI> Distempers, such as <HI>Melancholy, Lowness</HI> of <HI>Spirits, Wrong-headedness, Lu∣nacy</HI> and <HI>Madness</HI> (the Bane of the finest, best and most penetrating Spirits in <HI>Great Britain</HI>). For I defy any Man to give an Instance of any furious <HI>Madness,</HI> or great and obstinat <HI>Lu∣nacy</HI> or <HI>Melancholy,</HI> in any one who soon after Twenty, enter'd on Water drinking only, let him eat what he can; for it is <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors only that inflame the <HI>Membrans</HI> and <HI>membranous Tubuli</HI> (the <HI>Nerves</HI>), which are the bodily Organs of <HI>intellectual</HI> Operations. It is the <HI>Fire, Sulphur</HI> and <HI>volatile Tartar</HI> of <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, that inflame, corrugat and stimulat these <HI>Membranes,</HI> and their linear Threads, into violent Succussions, that break and tear them, which are the immediat Cause of these frightful and overwhelming Distem∣pers, as they are of the painful tortureing ones, <HI>Gout, Stone, Cancer</HI> and <HI>Consumption:</HI> For tho' Gluttony will thicken the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood, and thereby cause Obstructions in the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Capillaries,</HI> from whence many
<PB N="xxvi" REF="50"/>
and various Distempers may arise, yet will they be of the obtuse, slow, lingering Kind, and in which Nature will always give a timeous and early Warning, by <HI>Inappetency, Nausea, Vo∣miting, Purging, Sweating, Spitting</HI> or <HI>Rheums,</HI> which will opportunely stop the Pro∣gress; and while Water is plentifully then craved and given, it will carry on, distance in the Circulation, and dilute this too viscid <HI>Curd,</HI> to prevent an intire Obstruction of the <HI>animal</HI> Functions, or destroy Life, and hinder the Generation of <HI>Gout, Stone, Cancer</HI> and <HI>Consumption,</HI> which are solely produc'd by the hard salin Concretions of <HI>fermented</HI> Li∣quors. But, 4. The most signal Benefit a Man will reap from early Water-drinking solely, while as yet in tolerable Health, is being pre∣serv'd from the <HI>acute, sudden</HI> and <HI>mortal</HI> Dis∣tempers, as <HI>Apoplexies, Suffocations, Fevers</HI> of all kinds, <HI>Pestilences</HI> and <HI>Pleurisies.</HI> It is to <HI>fermented, strong,</HI> or <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors solely, that these quick and destructive Distem∣pers owe their true Cause, which give no Warning, and admit of no Cure: At least, Water-drinking solely, is the only Preservative, I am certain, known or knowable to Art. Accidents, <HI>epidemical</HI> Causes, a constant Neg∣lect, or a total Inability to guard against the Dangers of the other <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> absolutly necessary towards perfect Health and Life, may produce some Degrees of these mention'd grand Distempers; but then, under sole Water-drinking,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="51"/>
they will neither be so painful nor dangerous: For it is certain, Water-drinking, Dilution, and <HI>thin</HI> Diet, is the only Mean known to Art and Experience, to cure them, when Persons are already seiz'd with these Dis∣tempers, join'd with strong and proper Evacu∣ations; and whatever will cure, will prevent; as Water pour'd on will extinguish Fire, so it will prevent its being kindled or beginning. If these frightful, painful and mortal Distem∣pers happen sometimes in <HI>Eastern</HI> or <HI>Southern</HI> Climats, where <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors are not much in Use, it is because they wallow and indulge in some things almost equally as per∣nicious and inflammatory as these <HI>strong</HI> Li∣quors, as high in <HI>Aromaticks, eastern Gums</HI> and <HI>Juices</HI>; <HI>Opiats,</HI> the <HI>volatile cepacious Roots, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Seeds,</HI> of the <HI>poisonous, sopori∣ferous</HI> or <HI>stimulating</HI> kind, with which those Climats abound, which is the sole Cause of all their <HI>inflammatory</HI> Distempers, and unnatural and dissolveing Lust; for these are all but <HI>dry Drams,</HI> of a more dureable and adhesive Nature than some of the <HI>liquid</HI> ones; for Fire is still Fire, whether <HI>Solar</HI> or <HI>Culinary, Na∣tural</HI> or <HI>Chemical</HI>; whether it is <HI>transubstan∣tiated</HI> into <HI>liquid</HI> or <HI>solider</HI> Matter; and Wa∣ter is its only Extinguisher.</P>

<PB N="xxviii" REF="52"/>
<HI>Quality,</HI> for the Preservation of Life, Health and Serenity. If a Man study the <HI>least,</HI> light or heavy will not so much incommode him. The great End and Use of a <HI>low Diet,</HI> or one of <HI>Milk, Seeds</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is to mend the <HI>Juices,</HI> to cool, attenuat and sweeten the circulating <HI>Fluids</HI>; whatever <HI>Diet</HI> does this, must <HI>mechanically</HI> relax, unbend, and let down the <HI>Spring</HI> of the Solids. It is true, the Superiority of the <HI>Force</HI> or <HI>Spring</HI> of the Solids, must be always greater than the <HI>Re∣sistance</HI> of the Fluids; else the Animal could not live at all; that is, the <HI>animal Functions</HI> could not be perform'd; and this <HI>Superiority</HI> must be continued in some Proportion, whatever <HI>Regimen</HI> the Animal uses, so long as it lives. But it is certain, a cool, thin, sweetning Diet, attenuats the <HI>Fluids</HI> in a greater <HI>Proportion</HI> than it relaxes and unbends the <HI>Solids</HI>; be∣cause, 1. All the <HI>Secretions</HI> are from the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and not from the <HI>Solids</HI>; and they spending and wasting <HI>faster,</HI> must be sooner supply'd and alter'd by the proper Food. 2. Be∣cause the immediat Action of <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Physic</HI> is upon the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and they absorb and con∣sume most of their Virtue and Efficacy; and the <HI>Solids</HI> are never acted upon by them, till the <HI>Fluids</HI> are fully saturated and <HI>transubstan∣tiated</HI> into their Substance. And, 3. Because all Fluids by their Nature are sooner and more readily acted upon, and alter'd into foreign Qualities, than any Solids possibly can; and
<PB N="xxix" REF="53"/>
hence it comes to pass, that a Person on the immediat Change, and for some considerable Time after, in passing from a <HI>high</HI> to a <HI>low Diet,</HI> will find his Health wonderfully mended for the better, because the Resistance of the <HI>Fluids</HI> is immediatly lessen'd; which will again, even under the same <HI>Diet</HI> in Quan∣tity and Quality, wonderfully, and, as it were, unaccountably totter, and alter for the worse; which happens on the <HI>Despumation</HI> of the <HI>Glands, Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> while they are <HI>spewing</HI> out and <HI>disgorgeing</HI> their <HI>morbid</HI> Con∣tents on the <HI>Primae Viae</HI>; but which, by proper and <HI>specific</HI> Evacuations, Exercise and <HI>Astrin∣gents</HI> afterwards, will generally be set to rights again, if the Person be at a <HI>proper</HI> Time of Life, that is, under Fifty; for after that, there is little Encouragement from any Mean, but gentle <HI>Evacuation,</HI> and a Perseverance in the <HI>regu∣lated Regimen:</HI> Nay, even he must pro∣ceed, lessening it in <HI>Quantity</HI> at least, if not in <HI>Quality,</HI> by proper Degrees, and at pro∣per Periods, descending out of <HI>Life,</HI> as one ascends into it, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Milk-Porridge, Water-Gruel, Panada,</HI> and the like. But the great Benefit and Advantage a Man reaps from a <HI>low, cool, thinning, sweetning Regimen,</HI> of Milk, Seeds and Vegetables, above what he can have under any Diet of <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, is, that he can keep the <HI>stretched</HI> and extended Bowels, and Blood-Vessels, always fuller and plumper, and in their
<PB N="xxx" REF="54"/>
natural <HI>Tension</HI> and Situations; and consequently will make the <HI>Secretions</HI> more plentifully, and all the <HI>Functions</HI> will be more natural, and easier, than under a spare, <HI>cautious</HI> and anxiously <HI>guarded</HI> starving <HI>Regimen</HI> of so little <HI>animal</HI> Food as is absolutly necessary; as a weak Person will walk more easily in Stays than loose, some lame Persons in a <HI>Boot</HI> than a Stocking; and a <HI>defensive Plaister</HI> will keep a <HI>Sore</HI> easier, than when it is bare; and Excesses are neither so pain∣ful nor dangerous under the <HI>first</HI> as under the <HI>second</HI> Regimen; and the same Person may safely venture on at least <HI>four times</HI> as much <HI>Vegetable,</HI> Seed and Milk Food, as he dare of <HI>animal</HI> Food of any kind, at least of <HI>dense, hard,</HI> or full-grown <HI>animal</HI> Food.</P>

Great, frequent and continued <HI>Exer∣cise,</HI> especially a <HI>Horseback,</HI> because this Exercise, by the frequent <HI>Succussions,</HI> opens all the <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> of the <HI>Mesentery</HI> and <HI>Liver,</HI>

where the Evil generally lies. Walking, be∣cause of the universal Action of all the <HI>Solids,</HI> and its forceing the Perspiration, is the best Exercise to <HI>preserve Health</HI> and <HI>good Spirits</HI>; but <HI>Riding</HI> is best to recover them; to this the <HI>Flesh-brush</HI> for half an Hour, Morning and Night, ought to be join'd, to uncork the <HI>Plugs,</HI> and concreted Recrements that stop the Mouths of the <HI>perspiratory Glands</HI>; and then washing with <HI>tepid Water</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> and <HI>cold Water</HI> in <HI>Summer,</HI> the whole Skin, to scour off these <HI>Impurities</HI>; and drying well after: and having always a large broad soft <HI>Girdle</HI> of Leather, quilted with Cotton, to wear about the <HI>Loins,</HI> like a <HI>Stay</HI> or <HI>Swaith,</HI> to keep the <HI>Viscera</HI> in their natural Situations, the <HI>Lacteals</HI> and <HI>Intestines</HI> in their natural <HI>Cur∣vatures,</HI> and the <HI>Bowels</HI> from being too <HI>pen∣dulous,</HI> especially in thin and wasteing Persons. 3. Religiously to study and practice the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> of Food, they can be tolerably easy under: The least unnecessary Burthen, <HI>compressive</HI> Constriction or Ligature on the tender delicat <HI>Fibres, Nerves</HI> or <HI>Membranes,</HI> hinders their easy, pleasant and natural <HI>Play</HI> and <HI>Vibrations,</HI> which is the immediat Cause of <HI>Lowness</HI> and <HI>Anxiety</HI>; it is like <HI>nailing</HI> or sticking down with <HI>Pins</HI> or <HI>Stops,</HI> the <HI>Play</HI> of a <HI>musical Chord,</HI> whence <HI>Discord</HI> must necessarily ensue. In short, to preserve or obtain <HI>good Spi∣rits,</HI> in very low Cases, a Man must be in a con∣stant
<PB N="l" REF="74"/>
Course of <HI>Self-denial</HI> as to <HI>Aliment,</HI> and make, as it were, <HI>Hunger</HI> his greatest and only Pain; but nothing but Experience and constant Observation of the <HI>Juvantia</HI> and <HI>Laedentia,</HI> is sufficient to determin, to each Individual respectively, how far this is to be carried. <HI>Prudence</HI> is the first of all Natural as well as <HI>Christian Virtues</HI>; <HI>Gold</HI> may be bought too dear, but <HI>wise Nature</HI> always tells us how far this Method ought to be carried, by the In∣tenseness of our Cravings, when gone too far; and then a Person under no unnatural or vitious <HI>Passion</HI> or <HI>Lunacy,</HI> will obey her <HI>Calls,</HI> by giving her what she <HI>craves,</HI> so as to make her tolerably easy.

As to the <HI>Quantity</HI> of Foods of any kind, <HI>strong, middling</HI> or <HI>weak,</HI> fittest to pro∣long Life, and prevent or cure Diseases; the most proper for each Individual, there is no possible way to determin it to any Precision; it must be different, according to the <HI>Size, Strength, Age, Constitution, Habitude, ac∣quir'd</HI> or <HI>hereditary</HI> Distempers of each Parti∣cular, which are as various as their Faces. <HI>Wise Nature</HI> had so contriv'd us, had we follow'd her Simplicity and Order in our Diet, that our <HI>Appetites</HI> and <HI>Craveings</HI> should be a sufficient <HI>Rule</HI>; but having by long <HI>Habitudes</HI> and <HI>Ex∣ample,</HI> spoil'd, corrupted and disorder'd her <HI>Laws, Sensations</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> she is not <HI>now,</HI> in all Cases, sufficient to determin this Affair.

To follow the Quantity and Qua∣lity of those Foods that give him regularly one figur'd <HI>Stool</HI> a Day only. 6. For <HI>one Month</HI> to try double the Quantity, or at least one <HI>third,</HI> or less, more than he us'd of the same kinds of Food, and observe what Difference this makes in his <HI>Functions, Intellectual</HI> or <HI>Animal</HI>; and by some repeated Trials of this kind, summing up the whole, and takeing the <HI>half</HI> of this Quantity, divided by the Number of Days, as the <HI>Medium</HI> between the least or greatest Quan∣tity. 7.

her. So far may suffice to an honest prudent Person, as to the Quantity of Food, or the Materials of the <HI>Curd</HI> of the Blood: As to the <HI>Liquids,</HI> or the Materials of the <HI>Serum,</HI> I am perfectly convinced, Nature never intended any thing but <HI>pure Water</HI>; <HI>Water</HI> being <HI>signatur'd,</HI> by its greatest <HI>Fluidity</HI> and <HI>Insipidity,</HI> for carrying <HI>alimentary</HI> Particles readily and pleasantly through all the strait <HI>Meanders</HI> of <HI>animal</HI> Life; and having de∣sign'd fermented Liquors, and the Juices of <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> for <HI>Physic</HI> only, and they are, when us'd with Intemperance, or as common Beverage, the sole universal and ade∣quat <HI>natural Cause</HI> of most acquir'd Distempers; and Water-drinking only, the proper and ade∣quat <HI>Antidote</HI> for such. But if a Man will drink vinous and fermented Liquors, then the best are those that are of a middling Strength, the <HI>lightest, oldest</HI> and <HI>ripest,</HI> which have spent or drop'd their <HI>saline, tartarous</HI> and grossest Par∣ticles by Age and Maturity; on which Ac∣count the old <HI>Rhenish</HI> or <HI>Hock,</HI> ripe <HI>Claret</HI> or <HI>Burgundy,</HI> neat old <HI>Port</HI> and <HI>Madera,</HI> will be preferable; and the rich, fat, fiery, oily and gross Wines are only to be us'd as <HI>Cordials</HI> and <HI>Drams,</HI> on Necessity and Extremity.

<P>§. 28. To <HI>conclude</HI> this tedious Detail, of the two, <HI>animal Food</HI> or <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> either of any kind, that is in Use, if my Opi∣nion were to be <HI>ask'd,</HI> Which of the <HI>two</HI> is most pernicious to <HI>animal</HI> Bodies, or, in which of the <HI>two,</HI> Mistakes or <HI>Excesses</HI> are most per∣nicious, fatal, and most productive of the <HI>severe</HI> Distempers? I would not hesitate a Mo∣ment, to ascribe to <HI>fermented</HI> or <HI>distill'd</HI> Li∣quors of any kind, the whole Blame of all or most of the painful and <HI>excruciating</HI> Dis∣tempers that afflict Mankind: It is to it alone all our <HI>Gouts, Stones, Cancers, Fevers,</HI> high <HI>Hysterics, Lunacy</HI> and <HI>Madness,</HI> are princi∣pally owing: It is the true <HI>Pandora</HI>'s Box.

Certainly <HI>wise Na∣ture,</HI> who has provided liberally Supplies for all our Wants, has furnish'd us none of it; it is the Invention of spurious and luxurious Art, and it is present Death to <HI>many,</HI> and the na∣tural <HI>Aversion</HI> of all Animals who follow pure Nature: It certainly shortens the Duration of <HI>Life</HI> to all that use it even with <HI>Moderation,</HI> and is the alone <HI>adequat</HI> Cause of all the <HI>mortal,</HI> painful and atrocious Distempers.

<P>FOR a <HI>Conclusion,</HI> I will, from the whole, set down a few <HI>Aphorisms,</HI> that may perhaps
<PB N="lix" REF="83"/>
instruct and ease the Memory of the <HI>Valetudi∣narian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aphorism</HI> 1. A CONSTANT Endeavour after the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> of Meat and Drink a Man can be tolerably easy under, is the <HI>shortest</HI> and most infallible <HI>Mean</HI> to pre∣serve <HI>Life, Health</HI> and <HI>Serenity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 2. HE that would preserve a <HI>clear Head,</HI> and equal Spirits, must keep his <HI>Sto∣mach</HI> clean, his <HI>Bowels</HI> moderatly empty and uncomprest.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 3. ON <HI>bad Nights, Lowness, Fla∣tulence</HI> and Oppression of <HI>Spirits,</HI> of any Con∣tinuance, the only certain <HI>Reliefs</HI> are, a small <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> a <HI>domestic Purge, rideing</HI> a Horse-back, and a <HI>Regimen</HI> of the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> persisted in.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 4. SMALL frequent <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> are the quickest and most effectual Mean to mend the <HI>Blood,</HI> and to cure <HI>Cacochymy,</HI> if a <HI>Regimen</HI> of the lightest and least be joined.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 5. GENTLE and repeated Evacua∣tion upwards and downwards, (especially, and perhaps only, <HI>Vomits</HI>) by the Medicins most familiar and experienced, (the <HI>Action</HI> and Ex∣ercise of Vomiting is its chief Use) are the
<PB N="lx" REF="84"/>
<HI>surest, quickest,</HI> and most effectual Mean to prevent or remedy the ill Effects of Gluttony, Over-loading and Repletion, (that is, almost all chronical Distempers) provided the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least</HI> be join'd afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 6. <HI>DISEASES</HI> are always to be cured by their <HI>Contraries,</HI> the <HI>high Diet</HI> by the <HI>low,</HI> the <HI>hot</HI> by the <HI>cool,</HI> the <HI>sapid</HI> by the <HI>insipid,</HI> the <HI>thick</HI> and gross by the <HI>thin</HI> and poor, <HI>Repletion</HI> by <HI>Fasting, Inactivity</HI> by <HI>Exercise.</HI> Health acquir'd and possessed lies in the middle Regimen, between these two <HI>Ex∣tremes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 7. <HI>PERFECT Health</HI> and <HI>good Spirits</HI> depend chiefly, if not only, on the easy and pleasant Play or Performance of the <HI>Animal Functions, viz.</HI> the <HI>Digestion, Circu∣lation, Respiration, Perspiration, muscular Motion,</HI> and the <HI>Secretions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 8. HE that would be soon <HI>well,</HI> must be long <HI>sick,</HI> that is, treat himself as a <HI>Valetudinarian</HI> in most things.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 9. <HI>EXERCISE</HI> and <HI>gentle Eva∣cuation</HI> will supply the Place of <HI>Abstinence,</HI> and <HI>Abstinence</HI> will supply the Place of <HI>Eva∣cuation</HI>; but the first two are still preferable, because they damage the <HI>Solids</HI> least.</P>
<P><PB N="lxi" REF="85"/><HI>Aph.</HI> 10. <HI>QUANTITY</HI> in Food will supply <HI>Quality,</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> will supply the Place of <HI>Quantity</HI>; but in very bad Cases it is most secure to join <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 11. THERE is but little in a <HI>spe∣cific Regimen</HI> of <HI>Diet</HI> to remedy or antidot a <HI>specific Distemper</HI>; <HI>Abstinence</HI> in general, or a constant Endeavour after the <HI>lightest</HI> and the <HI>least,</HI> will constantly supply the Place of any <HI>specific</HI> particular <HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet: But in very bad Cases, a particular <HI>Choice</HI> of the most <HI>specific Regimen</HI> that <HI>Art, Experience</HI> and <HI>Philosophy</HI> shew to be most proper, is not to be neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 12. THE <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> by which one is cured of a particular Distemper, ought to be coninued, at least in some Degree, espe∣cially if the Person is not much under <HI>Fifty,</HI> else the Distemper will return with more se∣vere and worse <HI>Symptoms</HI> than at first, as <HI>Ex∣perience</HI> has constantly shew'd.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 13. Every <HI>wise</HI> Man, after <HI>Fifty,</HI> ought to begin to lessen at least the <HI>Quantity</HI> of his <HI>Aliment</HI>; and if he would continue free of great and dangerous Distempers, and preserve his <HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> clear to the <HI>last,</HI> he ought every seven Years go on, abateing

gradually and sensibly, and at last <HI>descend</HI> out of Life as he <HI>ascended</HI> into it, even into the Child's Diet.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 14. He that is <HI>old</HI> when he is young, that is, treats himself as a wise <HI>old Man</HI> does, or ought to do, by great <HI>Temperance, Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> if he lives past Thirty-five, will be young when he grows old in Years.</P>

<P><PB N="lxv" REF="89"/><HI>Aph. 25.

<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 26. IN <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art</HI> there is no such immediat Cure for low Spirits, Anxiety, and Want of Sleep, as rideing a Horse-back, long Journies with Fasting, or rather a very soft light Feeding with warm thin Liquors at Resting-Places, but that the least possible that actual <HI>Fainting</HI> will permit.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 27. NEXT to <HI>Rideing,</HI> is either a <HI>Vomit,</HI> or Fasting almost to Faintness, and then only a little spiced Wine and Water warm, and a Mouthful or two of <HI>dry Bisket</HI> every 5th or 6th Hour, with continued <HI>Friction,</HI> with a coarse Cloth, warm Flannel, or a Flesh-Brush, especially on the <HI>Spine,</HI> in <HI>Faintings</HI> and extreme <HI>Lowness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 28. TO procure <HI>natural Rest,</HI> no∣thing is like four or five middling Pills of true <HI>Assafoetida,</HI> with four or five Grains of pure succatrine Aloe, taken going to Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="lxvi" REF="90"/><HI>Aph.</HI> 29. THE only Way to secure tole∣rable <HI>Spirits</HI> in very low Cases, is a constant Endeavour to make Hunger the greatest Pain, and to cheat the <HI>Appetite</HI> and Craveing with little, warm, light Liquors at large Intervals.</P>

<P><HI>Aph. 32. VOMITS</HI> often repeated, at least as often as the Symptom of any Ail ag∣gravats, increases or exasperats, are the sole <HI>universal Antidot</HI> and <HI>Panacea</HI> of <HI>Britain:</HI> an ailing Person cannot repeat <HI>them</HI> too often, they will always prove beneficial and <HI>salutary.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="lxvii" REF="91"/><HI>Aph.</HI> 34. A <HI>low Diet</HI> seldom extirpats, or totally eradicats, any <HI>hereditary chronical</HI> Distemper, unless it be in the young, the mid∣dling-aged, or the strong and healthy, who have otherwise tolerable <HI>Stamina</HI>; in the very <HI>puny,</HI> delicat and <HI>slender,</HI> in the <HI>old,</HI> and far advanced in Life, even after Fifty, in the strongest, it only abates the Violence of their <HI>Symptoms,</HI> makes them less severe, and the Returns seldomer, and only prolongs the Du∣ration of their Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Aph.</HI> 35. THE natural Diseases of the <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Necessitous</HI> are generally owing to a <HI>bad,</HI> unwholesome, unsound Diet, and the Want of due Care of the other <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> Clean∣ness and Shelter; and are generally cured by their <HI>Contraries, viz.</HI> a good, <HI>wholesome,</HI> plain Diet, and a due Cleanness, Shelter from the Inclemency of Seasons, and an easy Mind.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 1. THERE are <HI>Animalcules,</HI> which being endued with Life and Mo∣tion, must consequently perform <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> that are less than any Ob∣ject perceptible by our Senses.</P>
<P>THIS is beyond all Doubt from <HI>Microsco∣pical</HI> Discoveries in <HI>Pepper Water, Spring Water, Vinegar, Sperm,</HI> the <HI>Urine</HI> and fluid Juices of almost all morbid Animals; and
<PB N="2" REF="95"/>
Mr. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> has shewn, that there are Animals, many Thousands of which would not equal a visible Grain of Sand; and that there are <HI>Tubes</HI> in Animals, of which several Hundreds would not equal a common Hair; and the smallest <HI>Animals,</HI> to carry on Life, must necessarily have all the chief <HI>Organical</HI> Parts of the greatest Animals, at least <HI>analo∣gically.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. An <HI>organized</HI> Animal Body could not possibly at first have been formed, nor can its <HI>Functions</HI> be now accounted for, or ex∣plained, by mere <HI>Mechanism,</HI> or the Laws of Motion which now obtain, without the Sa∣gacity and Agency of a <HI>primary self-existent</HI> Cause; nor can the <HI>Functions</HI> be continued without the Superintendance and Influence of a <HI>self-moving, self-acting secondary Agent,</HI> in∣forming and acting on it continually.</P>
<P>THIS is not only demonstrable from the <HI>Inertia</HI> and Passivity of Matter, from the ob∣vious Contradiction of a <HI>perpetual circular</HI> Motion, which is the Case of all Animals (the Motion of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and the <HI>Muscular</HI> Force of the Blood-Vessels, being the Cause of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> and the <HI>Circulation</HI> being the Cause (efficient or occasional) of the Motion of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and of the <HI>Muscular</HI> Fibres;) But that mere <HI>Mechanism</HI> acts only according to the <HI>Surfaces</HI> of Bodies; and yet it is probable,
<PB N="3" REF="96"/>
that animated Bodies act according to their <HI>So∣lidities,</HI> and that every <HI>Atom</HI> of an animated Body is constantly in Action, for the Preserva∣tion and Well-being of the whole <HI>Machin,</HI> and also for exerting that particular <HI>Animal Function,</HI> which its Figure, Situation and Use in the Animal requires. Besides, natural and simple <HI>Mechanism</HI> can act only from One <HI>Cen∣tre</HI> of Motion or Impulse, in One single <HI>Di∣rection</HI> only; whereas <HI>Curvature</HI> requires dif∣ferent Direction every Moment, and conse∣quently various <HI>Centres</HI> of Motion or Impulse. Now, if we consider the Varieties of Motions and Directions in the Joints and Muscles of Animals, but especially the <HI>infinite</HI> Variety of <HI>Curvatures</HI> in the <HI>Arteries, Veins,</HI> and <HI>Nerves,</HI> and particularly in the <HI>Glands,</HI> we will readily perceive it to be utterly impossible, and a Contradiction, that an Animal Body could have been at first <HI>formed</HI> without a <HI>Supra-me∣chanical Organisation</HI>; or that it should con∣tinue to <HI>live,</HI> and perform <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> without the continual Agency and Superin∣tendance of a <HI>secondary</HI> self-active, and self∣motive Principle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. It is highly probable, that the first <HI>Elements</HI> of Bodies, or the <HI>least</HI> and <HI>last</HI> Particles of Matter, are <HI>solid, hard,</HI> and <HI>indi∣visible,</HI> by any <HI>finite</HI> Power, or Force what∣ever; because by <HI>Friction, Collision,</HI> and <HI>Use,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="97"/>
they are not worn out, and lose not their <HI>Original</HI> Figure and Size; since they are still fit for the Ends and Purposes of their first In∣stitution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. GOD and <HI>Nature</HI> do nothing in vain; and since <HI>Body</HI> must necessarily be always en∣dued with some Figure, being neither infinitely small, nor infinitely great (where Figure may possibly be thought to evanish) the three most simple Figures of all solid Bodies, <HI>viz. Spheres, Cubes,</HI> and <HI>equilateral triangular Prisms,</HI> might possibly at first have made all the Diver∣sities of the primitive original Particles of <HI>specific</HI> Bodies. These Figures, with the parti∣cular Laws of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> thence arising, together with different <HI>Diameters,</HI> and various <HI>Combinations,</HI> may have made all the Differences of Bodies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 5. THE several <HI>Elements,</HI> or the several <HI>Aggregats</HI> or Masses of the different original Particles, now commonly called <HI>Elements,</HI> as <HI>Water, Air, Light, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> have each some specifick Qualities, which distinguish them from each other, and which they never entirely lose in any State whatsoever; but which may be swallowed up, and rendered unactive, when blended and combined with other Par∣ticles, as they are in the <HI>integral</HI> Particles of natural Bodies, as these are constituted in this our <HI>System.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="98"/>WATER has its Incompressibility, the Ro∣tundity, or at least the <HI>Spheroidity</HI> of its con∣stituent Particles; its Transparency, or re∣fractive Power, its Admission of <HI>Salts</HI> into its Substance without greatly increasing its Di∣mensions, at least in a certain Quantity and Proportion, nay sometimes lessening them.</P>
<P>AIR has its Elasticity, its <HI>repulsive</HI> Force, its <HI>acid</HI> and <HI>nitrous</HI> Spirit, and its <HI>vivifying</HI> Quality to Fire, and Animal Life.</P>
<P>LIGHT has its Activity, Velocity, Tenuity of its Particles, and its Fitts of easy <HI>Transmission</HI> and <HI>Reflection,</HI> and probably a greater Gravity or <HI>Byas,</HI> on one Side, than the other of its Particles.</P>
<P>SALT has its Solubility in Water only, its penetrating Virtue on Bodies, and its stimu∣lating Quality on <HI>animal Fibres</HI>; A greater Degree, and particular Law of the <HI>attractive</HI> Force of its Particles on one another, whereby its <HI>Clusters</HI> are generally of regular, and nearly similar Figures terminated by plain Surfaces.</P>
<P>EARTH has its greater Gravity, loose Con∣nexion, and less Attraction of its Particles; its Friability, and irregular Figure, being probably the <HI>Ramenta</HI> or <HI>Abrasions</HI> of the other <HI>Ele∣ments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="99"/>PERHAPS the <HI>primitive Animal Body</HI> might consist of the <HI>First</HI> pure specific and sub∣limed <HI>Elements,</HI> harmoniously combined, and elegantly ranged in their Original Natures, of which our present patch'd gross Bodies, are only the confused dense Kind; as our present Globe of <HI>Earth,</HI> its <HI>Water, Salt, Air, Light,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> are but probably the <HI>putrified</HI> Carcase of the primitive <HI>Planet</HI>; but both may con∣tinue to have some remote <HI>Analogy</HI> to one another, as a Carcase hath to a living Beauty, or an <HI>Egyptian Mummy</HI> to a living <HI>Cleo∣patra.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to this <HI>Analogy</HI> then, may not the Matter and Substance of the original first-created <HI>Vehicle</HI> or Animal Body, be of such Elements of the original Kind? of a <HI>ce∣lestial</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Nature (so to speak) in∣finitely more subtile and refined than the Mat∣ter of <HI>Light,</HI> more elastick than the finest <HI>Aether</HI>; and whose Particles might have had, as it were, an infinite Power of <HI>Attraction</HI> even at finite Distances, and consequently might per∣vade all gross Bodies of our <HI>System</HI> without Re∣sistance or Pain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 6. On such an <HI>analogous</HI> Supposition or Conjecture, the Fineness, Elasticity and Law of <HI>Attraction</HI> in the Particles of such a <HI>spi∣ritual Animal</HI> Matter, might admit of De∣grees
<PB N="7" REF="100"/>
(as all Finites must necessarily do) and the Degree might be in Proportion to the na∣tural and moral Powers of the Spirit con∣junctly.</P>
<P>IT seems highly probable, that all finite created <HI>Spirits</HI> have, and must have material <HI>Ve∣hicles,</HI> of Purity and Fineness in Proportion to their natural and moral Powers conjunctly, not only to limit and direct their <HI>Energy</HI> and Efficiency, but to <HI>commerciate</HI> with other Ani∣mals, and inanimat created Natures; none but the Supreme Spirit, <HI>the Father of Spirits,</HI> being absolutely and entirely an infinitely pure <HI>imma∣terial Spirit,</HI> acting by his Power and Energy with equal Facility at all possible Distances. And the <HI>Vehicles,</HI> or original Bodies of all cre∣ated Spirits might possibly be of some such Nature, as this described Matter, which may be called <HI>spiritual Matter,</HI> or <HI>Element.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 7. This <HI>spiritual animal Body,</HI> at first divinely organized, may be rolled up, folded together and contracted in this present State of its Duration, into an infinitely small <HI>Punctum Saliens,</HI> into a <HI>Miniature</HI> of a <HI>Miniature in infinitum,</HI> lodg'd in the Loins of the Male of all Animals, (for it is highly probable the Fe∣male was but a <HI>secondary</HI> Intention, or a <HI>But∣tress</HI> to a falling Edifice) and proceeding in a <HI>diverging Series,</HI> and progressive Gradation, that in due Time it may be fit to be nourished,
<PB N="8" REF="101"/>
and increased by the Juices of the proper Fe∣male, and thereby enabled to bear the Coarse∣ness and Injuries of this <HI>ruinous Globe,</HI> and gross Element, to which it is to be condemned for a certain Period.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 8. IT would seem that this <HI>spiritual Body,</HI> of this refin'd subtile Matter divinely or∣ganized, by an infinite Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI> to its particular informing <HI>Spirit,</HI> and by an in∣dividual <HI>Fitness</HI> and <HI>Congruity</HI> to the specific immaterial Inhabitant, is so intimately united with it in its original <HI>Creation,</HI> that they are <HI>never</HI> after to be separated, whatever future State they may go into, by any finite Power whatsoever; no more than the Firmness and Solidity of the primitive original <HI>Atoms</HI> of of Matter can be broken or divided by any natural Power. So that in whatever After∣states it may exist, or whatever <HI>Plaister</HI> or Vehicle of a denser and coarser Element may be superinduced, the <HI>spiritual</HI> Inhabitant and the <HI>primitive</HI> Creation-Body go inseparably together. And as this refined spiritual Body might have been the <HI>Creation</HI> primitive Body, so it may, purified, develop'd and mundify'd, be∣come the last <HI>Resurrection</HI> and <HI>glorify'd</HI> Body.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 9. It seems highly probable, <HI>analogous</HI> to the other Appearances of Nature, and con∣gruous to rational Agency (if we suppose the first Being <HI>rational, intelligent</HI> and <HI>wise,</HI> act∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="102"/>
with Designs and Purposes) that the con∣fining of <HI>intelligent</HI> or <HI>sentient</HI> Beings, for so long a Time, to so dark and strait a Prison, in the Origin, Seeds and Eggs of Animals, on this <HI>ruinous Globe,</HI> must have been for some wise and good End and Purpose, in God's <HI>moral</HI> Government of his int ligent and sentient Creatures; perhaps for <HI>Punish∣ment,</HI> Correction, progressive Purification, and painful Sensation (<HI>A Body hast thou given me,</HI> was said of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> to make him passive); <HI>Feeling and Experience</HI> being the most effec∣tual Mean to admonish and teach finite, wan∣dering and heedless Beings; at least this seems one Part of the Design.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 10. THAT in our present Scene of Exist∣ence, our <HI>natural Powers</HI> are tied down, sopited, and fettered by the Manner of our <HI>Origination,</HI> and coming into rational Life, is self-evident: The wisest and best Man on the Earth, as to rational and intelligent Liv∣ing, was first like a mere <HI>Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Plant,</HI> afterward a mere <HI>Animal</HI> or <HI>Brute,</HI> and but at last, very late, and only for a short Time, the rational and <HI>complete Man</HI>; and this Truth might be further illustrated, and even demonstrated, from the Qualities of <HI>Matter,</HI> which are contrary to and destructive of the Qualities of <HI>Spirit.</HI> Now this Progression must have some End and Purpose in the In∣tention of a wise and good Cause; and may suppose, that by the Abuse of Liberty, and
<PB N="10" REF="103"/>
idolatrising the Creatures, the <HI>moral Powers</HI> (<HI>Justice, Goodness, and Truth</HI>) being erased and cancell'd in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the most effectual Mean and Expedient to restore them, was to tye down, contract and sopite the <HI>natural Powers</HI> of the Soul (<HI>Living, Perceiving, and Willing</HI>) to a <HI>Level</HI> and Equality with these defaced <HI>moral Powers,</HI> that by the Use of the proper Means, they might (without Letts or Obstacles from these <HI>natural Powers</HI>) gradually improve and grow up together, in the same Degree and Order; at least this may be One not improbable End and Design of Providence, in this <HI>progressive</HI> Growth of the natural Powers of the human Spirit; since it is evident in Fact, that where the <HI>na∣tural and moral Powers</HI> of the Soul rise to any Degree, this Progression is observed.</P>

<P>§. 11. The <HI>Works</HI> of God are without Re∣pentance, the true unbodied Spiritual Sub∣stance in intelligent and sentient Natures, be∣ing an <HI>Emanation, Efflux, Ray,</HI> or <HI>Spark,</HI> or (if I durst use such figurative Language) an <HI>in∣finitesimal Miniature</HI> of his <HI>Substance,</HI> (and of his <HI>living, perceiving and willing,</HI> or whole Nature) who is <HI>Self-existent</HI>; After flowing from him, can no more <HI>perish,</HI> or cease to <HI>live, per∣ceive</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> than necessary Self-existence can cease to be; so that <HI>Living, Perceiving and Willing,</HI> (i. e. <HI>Cogitation</HI>) can never be totally extinct in any intelligent and sentient Being: Never in the <HI>Root, Faculty</HI> or <HI>Power,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="104"/>
tho' they may be, and often are, in the <HI>Acts</HI>; like Fire in Ashes. <HI>Annihilation</HI> is contra∣dictory to, and destructive of infinite Wisdom and Power, and unworthy of infinite Perfec∣tion, requiring the same <HI>Omnipotence</HI> that <HI>Creation</HI> does; <HI>Reaction</HI> being always equal to Action.

These <HI>Natural Powers</HI> may be sopited, contracted and hindred from issuing into Action, (as we see they are in sound Sleep, in some Diseases, <HI>Syncope</HI>'s, and many other Cases) by Obstacles of, and Resistances from gross Matter, by Bonds, Fetters and Chains made of these our <HI>Elements</HI>; and the coarser and straiter these Fetters and Chains are, the straiter and closer the Prison may be, and the weaker and fewer may be the Acts of the natural Powers, till this Prison become al∣most dead Matter, and a <HI>Dungeon,</HI> or a mere Point. Now infinite Wisdom and Power, being, as it were, necessitated by the infinite <HI>Benevolence</HI> of his Nature, to lay out all the

Energy of his Omnipotence and Omnisci∣ence, to recover and restore his Miniature Images, consistent with the <HI>Harmony</HI> of his own Attributes, and with the Usage of their natural Powers, (neither of which he could force, or offer Violence to,) seems to have contrived this wonderful Expedient, <HI>viz.</HI> to tye down, sopite and restrain the Acts and Exertion of the natural Powers, of laps'd, <HI>sen∣tient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings, for a determin'd Space of Time, by Chains and Fetters made of the <HI>Elements</HI> of this ruinous <HI>Globe,</HI> in order to punish and purify them, and so to vindicate his <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> to repair the Indig∣nity done to his <HI>Purity,</HI> to warn and deter the other Orders of his standing <HI>Hierarchies,</HI> and at the same Time, by lessening the Strength and Activity of the natural Powers in their full Vigour, to allow Freedom and Uninterrup∣tion from them, for the Restoration and Ad∣vancement of the moral Powers.</P>

Faith and Hope must eternally exclude <HI>Mathema∣tical</HI> Certainty. Perfect Demonstration and absolute Certainty, would exclude Choice, Election and Preference, in finite dependent Creatures.

By tying down, sopiting and suspending the <HI>natural Powers</HI> of the Soul for so long a Time, as is its Duration from the first original <HI>Male,</HI> till the Bonds and Chains, by which their Exertion is restrained, be broken and untyed by Death. That during this Time, the Benefit acquired by the progressive Parentage (if <HI>they</HI> happen to return to Order and Habits of Virtue, or have their moral Powers recovered) may ope∣rate on these <HI>infinitesimal Miniatures</HI>; by mending their Natures, that they themselves may have time given to recover into Order; and that the Interruption from the <HI>natural Powers</HI> arrived at their Perfection, might not prevent the Acquisition and Recovery of the <HI>Moral Powers.</HI> And, 3. By the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Redemption</HI> by a <HI>Saviour,</HI> which doubt∣less was projected before the Creation of the World, or this System, and when the pro∣per

These respective Substances are always in their own Nature and Essence so <HI>contrary</HI> and destructive of one another in their Quali∣ties, that they become a perpetual Bar, Obstruc∣tion and Obstacle to the Exertion of these their essential Qualities. They are not indeed <HI>contra∣dictory</HI> or destructive of one another's Quali∣ties in every Degree; they are not <HI>incompatible</HI> and <HI>unallyable</HI> (as we know by Fact); but they are <HI>contrary</HI>; and one Degree of the Qualities of the one, destroys a relative, equal or pro∣portional Degree of the Qualities of the other; and the <HI>Sum total</HI> of these Qualities in the one, destroys the <HI>Sum total</HI> of the Qualities of the other, equally or proportionally, like <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkness</HI>; and an infinite Degree of the one may sopite or totally obstruct the <HI>sensible Actions</HI> of the other, tho' not anni∣hilat or absolutely destroy the other in its Root or Nature.

<P>§. 1. IT is certain that by our Make, by the Frame of our <HI>Organs,</HI> we are now fitted as for Vegetable, so for Animal Food. The Form of <HI>some</HI> of our Teeth, the <HI>Liver,</HI> the <HI>Pancreas,</HI> and many other of our internal Bowels and <HI>conglomerate Glands,</HI> seem primarily and chiefly designed and fitted to <HI>antidote</HI> the Mischiefs arising from <HI>ani∣mal Food,</HI> and <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> at least for some Time, and in the Days of our Youth

and Vigour: For certainly, a Part of the <HI>De∣signs</HI> of any intelligent Agent may be known by <HI>Analogy</HI> justly drawn, and by <HI>final Causes,</HI> and is the best Evidence finite and lapsed Creatures seem capable of receiving, in the Designs and Contrivances of the <HI>Creator,</HI> till they come to converse with him <HI>Face to Face.</HI> They may be mistaken in them, as well as in every other kind of <HI>Evidence,</HI> be∣ing finite, lapsed, and consequently <HI>fallible</HI> Creatures: But this seems to be the only <HI>Evi∣dence</HI> they are capable of at present in such Matters; and may shew evidently the Design of the <HI>Author of Nature,</HI> as a <HI>convex Screw</HI> of any Number of Spires, shews, that it was de∣sign'd to fit some concave one of the same Number of <HI>Spires</HI> and <HI>Diameter. Chance</HI> is only a <HI>technical</HI> Word, to denote our Igno∣rance of the true and <HI>physical</HI> Cause of Or∣der and Design; and yet admitting the Ex∣istence of <HI>Chance,</HI> that through the whole human Race there should have been, in the infinite Number of their Organs, a perfect Similarity by <HI>Chance</HI> only, and not Design, may, by a fair <HI>Calculation,</HI> be shewn to be as <HI>infinite</HI> to <HI>finite,</HI> that is mathematically impos∣sible. But the <HI>Question</HI> I design to treat of here, is, Whether <HI>Animal</HI> or <HI>Vegetable</HI> Food was, in the original Design of the <HI>Creator,</HI> intended for the Food of Animals, and particularly of the <HI>human Race?</HI> And I am almost convinced it
<PB N="55" REF="148"/>
never was <HI>intended,</HI> but only <HI>permitted,</HI> as a <HI>Curse</HI> or Punishment, and a <HI>Cure</HI> for a <HI>Ma∣lady,</HI> or (as the <HI>French</HI> term it) a <HI>pis-alle,</HI> and because infinite Wisdom and Power could make no more of his corrupted rebellious free Creatures in their present State; and for this infinitely wise and paternal End, He seems to have permitted it; 1. To let them <HI>feel</HI> and experience the natural and necessary Effects of their own Lusts and Concupiscence, by painful and cruel Distempers: <HI>Feeling</HI> and Experience being the surest Means by which a finite lapsed Creature can know and learn. 2. To shorten the Duration of their natural Lives, that <HI>Sin, Misery,</HI> and <HI>Rebellion,</HI> might not increase in∣finitely. 3. To produce naturally, and in a Manner consistent with <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the other natural Powers of the Soul, (which being deriv'd from Him, and being his <HI>Minia∣ture</HI> Images, He neither could nor would force or destroy) those Sufferings and Mi∣series, and Dislike of <HI>inordinate Lusts</HI> and En∣joyments, that might make them think, pon∣der, and return to <HI>Order, Love of Virtue,</HI> and its <HI>source</HI> and <HI>Original.</HI> And, 4. To sink and contract the <HI>natural Powers</HI> of the Soul, (viz. <HI>Living, Understanding,</HI> and <HI>Will</HI>), by means of such frail Bodies, into a <HI>Level</HI> with the decayed and lapsed <HI>moral Ones,</HI> (<HI>viz. Justice, Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI>) which by this Rebellion were greatly corrupted and de∣graded.
<PB N="56" REF="149"/>
The Reasons that incline me to think in this Manner, are these following:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. 1. WHATEVER be the true, <HI>primoge∣nial,</HI> and last Principle of Bodies, beyond which it is impossible to <HI>analyse</HI> or divide them, these are incontestably found in all <HI>ani∣mal</HI> and <HI>vegetable</HI> Bodies, as has been before observ'd: 1. <HI>Sulphur,</HI> Oil or material Heat, from whence Spirit and Activity. 2. <HI>Salt,</HI> or hard angular Particles highly attractive, and dissolvable in Water. 3. <HI>Air,</HI> or small elastic Particles. 4. <HI>Water</HI> or <HI>Phlegm,</HI> from whence alone Fluidity: And, lastly, <HI>Earth,</HI> the Base and <HI>Substratum</HI> of these others. In the due and proportional Union of these, do the Va∣riety and Difference of animal Substances con∣sist. Now it is past all Doubt in Philosophy, and in philosophical <HI>Chemy,</HI> that <HI>animal Sub∣stances</HI> of most kinds, possess in a much greater Proportion the <HI>two first</HI> of these Principles, <HI>viz. Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils,</HI> than <HI>Vegetables,</HI> which partake more of the last, <HI>viz. Air, Water,</HI> and <HI>Earth.</HI> But from many undeni∣able Experiments, the two first Principles are known to be the most active, <HI>energic,</HI> and <HI>de∣leterious,</HI> and tend more, by their Activity, to the Division, Dissolution and Destruction of the Subject, than those others, when they en∣ter in any great Proportion. 2. The <HI>Jelly,</HI> the Juice or Chyle of <HI>animal</HI> Substances, is
<PB N="57" REF="150"/>
infinitely more tenacious and glewy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Memoirs of the Academy Royal for 1729 and 1730.</NOTE>, and its last Particles more closely united, and sepa∣rated with greater Difficulty, than those of <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances. This is evident from the Experiments made with them in joining of Wood, and is known to all <HI>Artificers,</HI> and may be made manifest to the Senses in the Dif∣ference between the Tenacity of <HI>Camp-jelly,</HI> or <HI>Fish-glew,</HI> and that of Paste made of Flower or Barley; or from the Strength of <HI>Ropes</HI> or <HI>Cords</HI> made of <HI>Cat-gut</HI> or <HI>Leather,</HI> and those made of <HI>Tow</HI> or <HI>Hemp,</HI> of the same <HI>Dia∣meter:</HI> And therefore <HI>animal Food</HI> must much sooner, more strongly, and irremediably make Viscidities in <HI>animal</HI> Fluids, and more <HI>schir∣rously</HI> obstruct the <HI>Capillaries</HI> and <HI>Glands,</HI> than vegetable Substances. 3. But the far more pernicious and destructive Part, is the <HI>Salts,</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> abounding more in most <HI>animal</HI> than in <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances; of which there are so many and convincing Demonstrations, that none can have any Doubt of it, that has the least Acquaintance with natural <HI>Philosophy:</HI> For our Blood and Juices being nourish'd and supply'd by such <HI>Substances,</HI> as abound most with these active <HI>elementary</HI> Principles, must necessarily be stored and saturated with <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs</HI>; and these, being always in a 
<PB N="58" REF="151"/>
State of <HI>Action,</HI> are the true, original, and the most adequate Causes of the most excru∣ciating Distempers. 4. When to these, <HI>strong, fermented</HI> and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors are added as a Vehicle, or diluting Mixture, and join to the <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs</HI> of animal Substances, not only their <HI>inflammable</HI> Spirits and <HI>tartar∣ous</HI> Salts, but their condensing and hardening Quality on the Food in the Stomach, the Di∣gestion is by that means hindered and stopped, and the Food not being sufficiently divided and comminuted, but broken only into gross Par∣ticles, does more quickly and obstinately thick∣en the Juices, and obstruct the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Capillaries,</HI> than <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances. 5. Animal Juices and Substances, before they were turned into Flesh, must have been strain'd through infinitely smaller and more numerous <HI>Tubes,</HI> such as the last and extreme <HI>Capillaries</HI> are (some of which are not bigger than the <HI>six hundredth part</HI> of an Hair); by which Means their Particles must be render'd extremely smaller and finer, and consequently have a much greater Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> than those of Vegetables, which pass through fewer <HI>Strainers,</HI> and have no other motive Powers but the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI>; whereas those of animal Substances have, besides the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Force of <HI>muscular</HI> Digestion, and of the Moti∣on of the Heart; the Flesh of Animals, I say, must, upon this Account, necessarily consist of smaller
<PB N="59" REF="152"/>
Particles, and so be united with a greater Force, and endow'd with a greater Degree of <HI>Attrac∣tion,</HI> and consequently must, with far greater Difficulty, be digested and separated, than <HI>ve∣getable</HI> Substances possibly can. And hence it is that <HI>carnivorous</HI> Animals are much more <HI>deleterious</HI> Food, being endow'd with much finer and more pungent <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> than those Animals that live on <HI>Vegetables</HI> only, as both the higher <HI>Savour</HI> and delete∣rious Effects of the first abundantly shew. From all which it is plain to a Demonstration, that animal Substances must naturally and ne∣cessarily <HI>incrassate</HI> the Juices, and produce <HI>Obstructions</HI> in the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Capillaries,</HI> and consequently create Pains and Diseases, much more readily than vegetable Substances. 6. It is plain by Weight, that the Substance of most animal Food is specifically heavier than that of most <HI>Vegetables</HI> commonly used for Food, sometimes in the Proportion of three to two. The <HI>Fibres</HI> and Juices of animal Bo∣dies are not only more compact and closely united, and have fewer <HI>Vacuities</HI> than those of Vegetables, whereby the digestive Powers have less Difficulty in concocting and grinding equal Quantities of <HI>Vegetable</HI> than <HI>animal Food</HI>; but by the less <HI>Flavour</HI> and <HI>Savour</HI> of vegetable than animal Food, the Appetite is sooner satisfied, and is under less Temptation to Excess in the first than in the latter; and it
<PB N="60" REF="153"/>
is consequently better and sooner digested, cir∣culated and secreted, especially by tender and delicate digestive Powers, and so cannot so readily cause <HI>Viscidities</HI> and <HI>Obstructions. Lastly,</HI> Infinite <HI>Experiment,</HI> and the best <HI>na∣tural Philosophy,</HI> confirm to a Demonstra∣tion, that those Substances, which have least of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> of <HI>Spirit, Oil,</HI> and hard pungent Particles, and most of soft Earth, Wa∣ter and Air, are the fittest to circulate, and be secreted through animal Tubes, create least Resistance to the motive Powers, tear, rend, and wear out the <HI>Tubes</HI> themselves least, and form less obstinate and powerful Obstructions, in the smaller Vessels; and consequently, that <HI>vegetable</HI> Substances, which consist of a less Proportion of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs, i. e.</HI> of pun∣gent and fiery Particles, and of a greater Pro∣portion of Earth, Water and Air, <HI>i. e.</HI> of less active and cooler Particles, will be less ready to create Diseases, and shorten Life, than an equal Quantity of animal Substances, which have all these in an <HI>inverted</HI> Proportion. In a Word, vegetable Substances are more <HI>rare,</HI> less <HI>compact,</HI> less <HI>coherent,</HI> more easily dissol∣vable and digestible, turn into a lighter <HI>Chyle,</HI> have less <HI>Salt, Oil,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> and consequent∣ly are less heating and inflaming, than animal Substances, and so obstruct and tear animal Tubes less.</P>

<P>§. 3. IF this Account be just and <HI>philoso∣phical,</HI> and if it be lawful at all to enquire in∣to final Causes, (which, if the first Being be <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>intelligent,</HI> and acts with Design, and for some End, is not only lawful, but laudable, when done with Modesty and Hu∣mility) then certainly <HI>one</HI> Part of his Design in permitting <HI>animal</HI> Food, must of Necessity have been to shorten the <HI>Duration</HI> of human Life, to <HI>create,</HI> or at least to <HI>permit</HI> us by it, to multiply and enrage Diseases, Misery and Sufferings; since it is evident to a Demonstra∣tion, that it must always produce this Effect, and will always have it preferable to <HI>vegetable</HI> Food; and whatever <HI>is,</HI> naturally and neces∣sarily <HI>is,</HI> and is permitted by the <HI>first Being,</HI> we may with the utmost Certainty conclude, was at least <HI>one</HI> Part of his Design; and if Suf∣fering, Pain and Misery here be necessary for our <HI>Purification</HI> and <HI>Recovery</HI> out of this degenerate State, then very probably that might be his Design in this Permission. <HI>This Phae∣nomenon</HI> in Providence, (the Permission and Use of <HI>animal</HI> Food) and <HI>Fact</HI> in <HI>Revelation,</HI> is not accountable any otherwise, than that Pain, Suffering and Diseases, being a natural and necessary Mean of <HI>Expiation</HI> and <HI>Purifi∣cation,</HI> in the Oeconomy of Restoration, <HI>In∣finite Wisdom</HI> permitted it, tho' unwillingly, as his <HI>strange Work,</HI> against the Grain, as it were, for that End solely; as a kind <HI>Father</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="155"/>
suffers his unnatural and perverse Son to be carried to <HI>Gaol,</HI> to suffer Hunger, Cold, Pain and Confinement there, as the only Mean to make him sober, considerate, wiser and better. For that <HI>animal Food</HI> and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors will more readily, certainly, and cruelly, create and exasperate Diseases, Pains, and Sufferings, and sooner cut off Life than <HI>vegetable</HI> Food will, there can be no more Doubt than in any Proposition of <HI>Euclid,</HI> if <HI>Reason, Philo∣sophy,</HI> the <HI>Natures</HI> of Things, or <HI>Experience,</HI> have Evidence, or Force in them; and it is very observable, that this Indulgence for ani∣mal Food was not granted, till the <HI>Aera</HI> of <HI>Longaevity</HI> was expir'd, or at least they took place together; and not till the spiritual Corruptions of <HI>Pride, Tyranny, Malice, Revenge, Murder,</HI> and <HI>brutal</HI> Commerce, so universally raged, that infinite Wisdom, to begin a new World, was forced to destroy, by a <HI>Deluge,</HI> the whole Race of Mankind, except a few of the most innocent and least deprav'd <HI>Individuals,</HI> such as they were, far from perfect, but the least bad of the Race: this seems so, if any Credit be given to the <HI>Jewish</HI> History of Nature.</P>

able to recompense the Loss of a <HI>lower</HI> Life, by the Gift of a higher; for it is not impossible, the <HI>Animals</HI> may have been a lower Order of <HI>rational Intelligences,</HI> who, <HI>lapsing</HI> less, are sooner, and with less Suffering, recover'd; and since they suffer with us, they may be restor'd with us; the Apostle says, <HI>the whole Creation travelleth together</HI>; that is, probably, the whole <HI>System</HI> of <HI>Saturn,</HI> the Goal of God's Creation: For <HI>Him,</HI> I say, to give up the Lives of a lower Rank of Beings, for the <HI>Expiation, Instruction,</HI> or <HI>Admonition,</HI> or other Benefit of a higher, may be an Act of great <HI>Justice, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness.</HI> And, if it might be allow'd us to conjec∣ture, one wise <HI>End</HI> and Purpose in this <HI>Per∣mission</HI> of <HI>animal</HI> Food, might be to punish, admonish and correct us, by bodily Distem∣pers, so as to bring us to reflect, repent and amend; or even, to shorten the Time of our Sufferings here, and by the Violence of our Diseases, and a nearer Prospect of <HI>Death,</HI> and a future <HI>Reckoning,</HI> to reclaim us sooner and more effectually; and at the same Time to ad∣vance these <HI>Victims</HI> to a higher State of Being and Happiness.

<PB N="66" REF="159"/>
or recommended for common Use, or as pro∣per and ordinary Drink; but only as <HI>Physick,</HI> or a <HI>Cordial,</HI> on <HI>Festivals,</HI> or at <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> on <HI>Sickness,</HI> or in Extremities. In the early and innocent Ages of <HI>golden</HI> Simplicity, no Hint supposes them commonly known or tried. And if fermented and spirituous Liquors were used only as <HI>bitter Draughts, Cordials</HI> and <HI>chalybeat</HI> Medicines, to brace and wind up the Stomach, and alimentary Tubes and Solids transiently, for a short Time; on Sickness, Lowness, Fainting, Fatigue, and <HI>inclement</HI> Sea∣sons, as they seem to be intended by the <HI>Author</HI> of Nature; they might be Blessings, and great temporary and transient Reliefs; but as they are now used constantly at Meals, as common <HI>Beverage</HI> to dilute solid Food, and to make Persons easy under a Load of high rich ani∣mal Food, they become the efficient Causes of most Diseases; and upon the most <HI>seri∣ous</HI> Enquiry, I could never find an <HI>adequate</HI> natural Cause, for the Frequency of <HI>nervous</HI> and atrocious chronical Distempers now, from what they were formerly, nor of the <HI>Stuntedness, Punyness</HI> and Feebleness, so conspicuous among the <HI>better Sort,</HI> from what they were before the <HI>Conquest,</HI> and in our <HI>Gallic</HI> Wars; but the free and frequent Use of strong and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, and rich and high Foods, with foreign <HI>Cookery,</HI> at that Time introduced first; and living in great Towns, and using only Coaches and Chairs,

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 6. THE Hurt and Damage all <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors do an <HI>animal</HI> Body, is evident from many Considerations; as, 1. That it hardens, constricts and binds up the Fibres, and strongly unites the Particles of <HI>animal</HI> Substances, so that they are with much greater Difficulty separated and divided, <HI>i. e.</HI> digested. A Piece of Meat will continue sweet and sound, for many Years in Wine or strong Beer, or in any strong fermented Liquor; the Liquor cementing and pinning to∣gether the Parts of the Meat; and the same hap∣pens when they are mixed in the Stomach; by which the <HI>Digestibility</HI> and easy Dissolution of it, is obstructed; so that in such a Mixture <HI>Mutton</HI> is turned into <HI>Beef,</HI> and <HI>Beef</HI> into <HI>Shoe-Leather.</HI> 2. There is in strong Liquors a crisping, corrugating, or <HI>caustic</HI> Quality workt on the Fibres, which burns and dries them up, and destroys their <HI>elastic</HI> and <HI>ductile</HI> Virtue, and consequently renders them unfit to be broken and divided in the Stomach. This is evident from the Use commonly made of strong Beer, as the best Plaister for <HI>Sprains, Relaxations</HI> and <HI>Strains</HI>; and that Brandy will really stop <HI>Hae∣morrhages</HI> and Ruptures in the Blood-Vessels,

by burning and wrinkling the tender Fibres and Capillaries, and so by this crisping Quality must keep Food from being readily and per∣fectly digested. 3. The Fire and Heat in strong Liquors, by stimulating and twitching the <HI>Fibres</HI> and Coats of the Blood-Vessels and Nerves, and consequently bringing them in∣to quick and frequent <HI>Vibrations,</HI> and elastic Efforts, will break and tear the Fibres of the alimentary Tubes, and separate their Uni∣on and Continuity, so as at last to wear out these Organs, at least, much sooner, and with greater Pain and Suffering, than Water or aqueous Liquors possibly can. <HI>Lastly,</HI> It is a common and well-known Experiment, that to <HI>stunt</HI> the Growth of young Animals, as Dogs and Cats, they need only be frequently rubbed over with Brandy, Rum, or any Spirit. This stops the <HI>Ductility</HI> and Extension of the young animal <HI>Fibres,</HI> that they cannot be dilated and develop'd by the Force of the Circulation, and so <HI>stunts</HI> their Growth. From all which it is plain, that strong, but especially <HI>spirituous</HI> Li∣quors, are really <HI>Poison</HI> to an animal Consti∣tution; and their ill Effects, not only in short∣ening the Lives, but in stunting the Growth and Stature of the lower Rank of People, from the late frequent Use of Gin, Punch, and other spirituous Liquors, have become so fla∣grant, as to call aloud for the just Indignation of the <HI>Legislature</HI>; and it is to be wished, that an effectual Remedy may be found out for so

destructive an Evil. And I am fully con∣vinced, that the primary and original Design of the <HI>Author of Nature</HI> for the solid Food of Animals, was nothing but earthy Particles mixed with Water and Air, finely divided and cemented only, with the least <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> pos∣sible, as they are found in Seeds, Fruits, young Vegetables, and <HI>farinaceous</HI> or <HI>pulpous</HI> Roots, with Water only for Drink; which alone would make the Animal last the longest, and with the fewest Pains and Diseases. But this Diet must be only tried and begun with the <HI>Young,</HI> while their Fibres are tender and sweet.</P>

Most of
<PB N="70" REF="163"/>
the <HI>Animals</HI> are <HI>Martyrs</HI> for the human <HI>Species</HI> in Food or <HI>Sacrifice:</HI> Some of them are Food for one another; all of them are subject to <HI>epide∣mical</HI> Diseases and casual Misfortunes; a few of them pass their Time much more comfortably than others; all of them but unhappily at best, and go through Death at last. All this must be for some wise Purpose, and none can be nobler, than that of <HI>Expiation, Pu∣rification</HI> and <HI>progressive Perfection</HI> of Be∣ing; and silent <HI>Admonition,</HI> and teaching <HI>us,</HI> their superior <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Beings.

At what Time <HI>animal</HI> Food came first in Use, is not certainly known.

<HI>human Flesh,</HI> and feeding on brute animal Flesh, except <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Example.</HI> I believe some rational Creatures would suffer less in being fairly butcher'd, than a strong <HI>Ox,</HI> or <HI>red Deer</HI>; and in natural <HI>Morality</HI> and Justice, the Degrees of Pain here, make the <HI>essential</HI> Difference; for as to other Differences, they are relative only, and can be of no Weight with an <HI>infinitely perfect Being.</HI> Did not <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> weaken this Terror, and make the Difference, Reason alone could ne∣ver do it. Perhaps it may be conjectur'd, that since <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were certainly an <HI>original, re∣veal'd</HI> or <HI>traditional</HI> Institution, and that no Nation under the Sun, hitherto known, was without them, they being, it would seem, a chief Part in the grand <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the <HI>Re∣storation</HI>; Sacrifice, I say, might have been originally instituted, 1. To <HI>admonish</HI> and <HI>in∣form the Sinner</HI> silently, and without com∣mitting Violence on his <HI>Liberty,</HI> what he de∣serves; and implicitly to tell him, that he de∣serves the same <HI>Death</HI> he makes the poor Brute undergo. For the <HI>Liberty</HI> of Man∣kind seems so precious, being the Root of Intel∣ligence, that it is wonderful in how many Shapes <HI>infinite Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> has put Himself, in the Conduct of <HI>Providence</HI> and Nature, to preserve it inviolate; and at the same time to instruct and admonish his free lapsed Intelligences. I believe a good natural <HI>Philosopher</HI> might shew with great
<PB N="72" REF="165"/>
Reason and Probability, that there is scarce <HI>Beast, Bird, Reptile</HI> nor <HI>Insect,</HI> that does not, in each particular <HI>Climat,</HI> instruct, and admo∣nish Mankind of some necessary Truth, for their Happiness either in Body or Mind. And, 2. To continue the <HI>Expectation</HI> of all Ages, of some more noble and meritorious <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> some time or other to be celebrated. And it is not impossible, that the rude and un∣taught <HI>Mob,</HI> who were employed in the lower servile Offices about <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> might have been the first who ventured on <HI>animal</HI> Food, (if it was not instituted afore as a <HI>Sa∣crament</HI> with the same Intention as the <HI>Eu∣charist</HI> was afterwards) their Station habituat∣ing them to bear with less Pain, the Suffer∣ings of their Fellow-Creatures while sacri∣ficed; and they finding it <HI>palatable</HI> and <HI>lu∣scious,</HI> might recommend the Use of it to Others. Perhaps, I say, this might have been the Original Institution of <HI>animal</HI> Food among all <HI>Nations.</HI> However, as this is only a remote Conjecture to account for the early Commencement of <HI>animal</HI> Food, so contrary to the original Nature of Man, and the Design of the <HI>Creator,</HI> and has no Regard to those concern'd in our unbloody Sacrifice; I pro∣ceed now to observe how cautiously, and with what an evident <HI>Forbid,</HI> the <HI>Jewish</HI> Law di∣rects this <HI>Permit</HI> of animal Food, <HI>viz.</HI> abso∣lutely and positively not to eat the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Animal</HI> (in which not only its Life, but its
<PB N="73" REF="166"/>
most delicious Savour and most <HI>deleterious</HI> Qualities chiefly consist, and because Blood <HI>Globules,</HI> by their Rotundity, Volubility, and Elasticity, resist <HI>Trituration,</HI> that is, Digestion). Now this in Reality, and by <HI>Insinuation</HI> and <HI>Moral,</HI> is to say, That since for the <HI>Hardness</HI> of your Hearts, and your present unconquerable Lustings, you cannot be brought to abstain al∣together from <HI>animal</HI> Food; yet because in the <HI>Blood</HI> is the <HI>Life thereof,</HI> and all its dele∣terious, morbific and noxious Qualities, you are to drain it as much as possible of all its Moisture and Juice, (for the Serum as well as the Grume, mostly consists of <HI>globular</HI> Particles), and eat it plain, roasted or boiled, to drain it still more: By this Method, <HI>animal</HI> Food will be much less pernicious, and will ap∣proach very near to <HI>Vegetables.</HI> There is no understanding this <HI>Permission</HI> any other Way, nor is it otherwise to be reconciled to common Sense, or rational Conception, how∣ever both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> have at pre∣sent dwindled and diluted its true Import, out of Luxury.</P>

<P>§. 8. THIS Doctrine is further confirm'd by this surprising Circumstance in the Permis∣sion, that there is a very particular and other∣wise unintelligible Distinction made between <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> Beasts, either to be sacri∣ficed, or eaten for Food; and a distinguishing <HI>Mark</HI> assign'd how to know the last. And
<PB N="74" REF="167"/>
since it comes from the same Source with the <HI>Permission</HI> of <HI>animal</HI> Food, these two must have some material Difference in the Nature of Things; and that can be none other but that the Flesh of these last cannot be so readily digested and squeezed from their Blood, but that it will have sufficient remaining, of a more deleterious Nature, to inflame and <HI>mortify</HI> the Juices of those who use it freely, and to en∣rage and <HI>madden</HI> their Passions; and he who is deeply acquainted with <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> and the <HI>History</HI> of the unclean <HI>Animals,</HI> will be sensible of the Justness of this Prohibition and Observation.

<P>§. 9. I MUST however own, that I think some <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, of much <HI>Salt, Oil,</HI> or luscious Juice and <HI>Poignancy,</HI> as much or more deleterious, inflaming, and incrassating, than some mild animal Substances: For Exam∣ple, <HI>Onions, Shallot, Mustard, Horse-radish,</HI> all the <HI>Nut-kinds, Eastern Gums, Balsams, Raisins, Pickles, Spices, Aromatics,</HI> strong fermented <HI>Sours,</HI> rich and fat late Fruits, as dry yet <HI>plump Grapes,</HI> much <HI>Sugar,</HI> and the like; these are in some delicate Constitutions more poisonous and hurtful to an human Body, than a Bit of the <HI>muscular</HI> and lean Flesh of <HI>Chicken, Veal, Lamb, Rabbit, Partridge, Turkey,</HI> and the like white and young animal Foods; whose Whiteness and Tenderness shews there is little or no red <HI>Blood Globules</HI> in them, and are conse∣quently more easily digestible, and less delete∣rious. These <HI>Vegetables</HI> may be allowed in small Quantities, as a <HI>Sauce</HI> or <HI>Relish</HI> to other∣wise insipid and unpalatable vegetable Food, to sickly Appetites; but in great Quantities, and without Caution, they will hurt, heat and thicken the Blood and Juices of tender Con∣stitutions;
<PB N="76" REF="169"/>
which is the sole Cause of the acute Distempers of all the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Nations, who do not deal, or but very sparingly, in strong fermented Liquors. Without doubt, plain <HI>Milk</HI> (the genuine Soup prepar'd by the Author of Nature, and of a middle Na∣ture between animal and vegetable Sub∣stances) boiled or raw, or prepared with Seeds, as <HI>Rice, Sago, Barley, Wheat, Mil∣let,</HI> and the like, is the best and safest of all Foods for such tender Constitutions, as being in itself Blood, that has not as yet often passed through the Lungs, to give it its <HI>scarlet Colour,</HI> and deleterious Qualities, but is drawn almost directly from the Stomach and Lacteals, from an <HI>Emulsion</HI> made there, and Cookery of Nature, of Grass and Vegetables with pure Water, and designed by the <HI>Author of Nature,</HI> for the Cure and Nourishment of the Young, Tender and Delicate: And I can see no Difference be∣tween a young or tender and delicate Animal by Nature, and one made so by a Disease; but that such a Diet is still more necessary for the last than for the first.

<P>§. 10. AGAINST this Doctrine, that ani∣mal Food was permitted for a <HI>Punishment,</HI> and that fermented Liquors are not an Institution of Nature and its Author; those who have Re∣gard for <HI>Revelation,</HI> whence the Patent for animal Food is drawn, may object, that our <HI>blessed Saviour,</HI> who was <HI>without Sin,</HI> eat and drank of what was set before him; that his first <HI>Miracle</HI> was supernaturally producing Wine, to celebrate the Marriage of <HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Galilee</HI>; that he was accounted a Wine-biber; that he eat and drank with <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sin∣ners</HI>; that he wrought other <HI>Miracles</HI> to pro∣duce <HI>animal Food</HI> to a Multitude; that St. <HI>Peter</HI> had a <HI>miraculous Vision</HI> to instruct him, that no sort of Food was unclean; that the <HI>Eucharist</HI> is celebrated in Wine; and that St. <HI>Paul</HI> advises <HI>Timothy</HI> to drink Wine for his Infirmities. To all which I answer, 1. That the Question is not what is, now, best and fittest in the <HI>present</HI> Ends of Providence, in order to restore and recover Man from his lapsed and fallen State; but what was probably the first Design of our <HI>Creator,</HI> in our primitive un∣lapsed State, before we and our Habitation (the <HI>Earth</HI> with its <HI>Atmosphere</HI> and Appen∣dages)
<PB N="78" REF="171"/>
were thus spoilt and disordered. 2. One sort of Repair, Props, or Support, may be proper or necessary for a Habitation in one Degree of Ruin and Decay, that would by no Means be necessary or proper in another or lower Degree. 3. There is neither <HI>Virtue</HI> nor <HI>Vice</HI> in abstaining from one sort of Food more than another, but as it is commanded by law∣ful Superiors; all that is here considered, is, which of the two, <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>animal</HI> Food, in the Nature of Things, by the <HI>animal Oeco∣nomy,</HI> and as human Creatures and their Food are now constituted, is <HI>physically</HI> and experi∣mentally fittest to carry on and prolong Life, with the least Pain, fewest Diseases, and for the longest Time. <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> are of quite another Consideration, and depend on the <HI>internal Principle</HI> and Disposition; the Quantity, Manner and Order in which these necessary Supports are taken, not on the Things themselves. But if it be asked, Which of the two <HI>Diets</HI> is most conducive to <HI>Virtue</HI> or <HI>Vice?</HI> Which of the two is most likely to faci∣litate the Acquisition of <HI>Virtue?</HI> What is above∣said, plainly determines it in Favour of a <HI>low Diet</HI>; for by it the bodily Passions being made cooler and weaker, the Blood and Juices be∣ing sweetened, the intellectual <HI>Organs</HI> thereby render'd cleaner, more agile and penetrating, <HI>Reason</HI> and the <HI>spiritual Nature</HI> of Man has more Liberty to act, and meets with less Dif∣ficulty and Resistance in its Operations. 4.

As to our blessed <HI>Saviour,</HI> he having come to seek and to save what was lost, was obliged to take the World as he found it, in order to raise it from that Degree of <HI>Perdition</HI> in which it was then plunged. He took upon him the Form of a <HI>Servant</HI>; he took not the Nature of <HI>Angels,</HI> but the Nature of the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI>; he was in all things like unto us, <HI>Sin only excepted.</HI> Those to whom he came, and among whom he dwelt and convers'd, could at first neither receive nor understand his <HI>sublime Doctrines</HI>; he had many Things to say even to his Disciples, which they could not then <HI>bear</HI>; and yet this Doctrine of the Prefe∣rence and greater Advantages of <HI>vegetable</HI> than of <HI>animal</HI> Food, is virtually and implicitly con∣tain'd in the general Doctrine of <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Poverty of Spirit,</HI> (in the Sense of the <HI>Evan∣gelic Counsels,</HI> that carry quickest into <HI>Perfec∣tion,</HI> where <HI>Celibacy</HI> is preferr'd to <HI>Marriage</HI>; for in the Kingdom of <HI>Glory,</HI> they are neither married nor given in Marriage, but are as the <HI>An∣gels</HI> of God) so strongly and pre-eminently incul∣cated in the Gospel, as any who reads and con∣siders it, must plainly see. 5. I readily grant, and have given the Reasons and <HI>Philosophy</HI> of these Things, that in our present lapsed State, in the present Infertility, and insufficiently nutri∣tive Qualities of the <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in the present Curse on the Earth, and the Necessity of La∣bour, Handicrafts, <HI>mechanical</HI> Force, and <HI>mar∣tial</HI> Prowess, while Wickedness is so power∣ful,
<PB N="80" REF="173"/>
and the Wicked so numerous, there is a Necessity for high <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fer∣mented</HI> Liquors, in some Cases, and to some Persons, to secure against and remedy these Evils. But the sole <HI>Question</HI> here is, Whe∣ther this Diet will prevent Diseases, or lengthen Life so effectually as the other? Or whether Providence has not designed and appointed ve∣getable Food for the <HI>Cure</HI> and <HI>Antidote</HI> of the Pains and Diseases naturally and necessarily arising from animal Food, and fermented Li∣quors? Perhaps <HI>God,</HI> in his moral Govern∣ment of the World, has design'd animal Food, more readily to punish those who will not be drawn by Love and Beauty; <HI>i.e.</HI> to purify some sorts of Men by Pains and Sufferings. 6. I willingly allow, that <HI>fermented</HI> and sometimes <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, are excellent Remedies, temporary Filips, Whips or Spurs, in Faintness, Sickness, Labour, or festival Occasions for <HI>Joy,</HI> and promoting of Friendship, and on Necessities and in Extremities: But I contend, then, and then only, they ought to be used; and that there is neither Precept, Example, nor En∣couragement from <HI>Reason, Experience,</HI> or <HI>Re∣velation,</HI> to use them otherwise, or as they are now used for <HI>common</HI> Food, and daily <HI>Be∣verage</HI>; whence they become one Cause of all the great Diseases of the present Age. From these general Considerations, all the mention'd Difficulties have an easy <HI>Solution</HI> to the Candid and Ingenuous: I am not fight∣ing

<HI>Prizes,</HI> nor making Articles of a <HI>Creed.</HI> That infinite Wisdom foresaw, and laid in Provision and the necessary Precaution and <HI>An∣tidote,</HI> for the most deleterious Effects of animal Food and fermented Liquors, for a short time, seems to me evident for these Reasons, 1. In that He provided the <HI>Liver,</HI> (the <HI>Pancreas,</HI> and other internal <HI>Glands</HI>) in Animals, these vast∣ly strong, complicated and elabour'd <HI>Organs,</HI> to draw out the most poisonous Parts of strong Meats and Drinks: the stronger the <HI>Liver,</HI> and the larger that <HI>Organ</HI> grows, the more <HI>Bile</HI> it throws out on the <HI>Common-shoar,</HI> the <HI>Intestines,</HI> to deprive the Chyle of its churlish Salts, and acrid <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> and thus makes the <HI>Liver</HI> an useful Medicine to promote the animal Functions, <HI>Digestion, Chylification,</HI> and the <HI>peristaltic Motion,</HI> and then throw its useless Parts out of the Habit. 2. By the create∣ing mineral and ponderous Medicines, (<HI>Mer∣cury</HI> chiefly) to open Obstructions, break sa∣line Concretions, and dissolve the <HI>Tenacity</HI> of the <HI>Globules</HI> and <HI>Serum.</HI> And, 3. In providing <HI>mineral</HI> Waters of so various and complicated Natures, for the same Ends and Purposes, which they will, well-chosen, effect at last, as certainly as those formerly mentioned. Now it is plain to a <HI>Demonstration,</HI> that under a ve∣getable Diet, all those have little or no Use in Medicine; nay, any one who is acquainted with the Delicacy, Tenderness and Sensibility of the internal and infinitely minute Parts of
<PB N="82" REF="175"/>
an animal Machine, must know that they are not only in a great Degree useless, but hurt∣ful, and tend to tear, dissolve and destroy the infinitely minute Fibrils, of which the Solids of an <HI>animal Machin</HI> are formed: So that their final End and Design in Providence must have been to <HI>antidote</HI> the ill Effects of <HI>animal Food</HI> and strong <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> to a certain Degree, and for a certain Time, <HI>probably</HI> till some time after the Meridian of Life, while the Organs had attained their ut∣most Extension and Firmness; for it is not im∣probable, that none of the Mineral Waters existed under the <HI>Form</HI> and in the Manner they now appear, till after the <HI>Deluge,</HI> the <HI>Aera</HI> of <HI>animal Food, fermented Liquors,</HI> and the <HI>shortness of Life.</HI></P>

<PB N="83" REF="176"/>
Thirst of Blood: To these and such-like Pre∣judices, (I cannot call them Objections) it may be answer'd, I. First, That these Facts are not denied, but are of no Weight against the Propositions here chiefly asserted, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That it is <HI>Phi∣losophically</HI> certain, that <HI>animal</HI> Food is in its own Nature more ready to produce Distempers than vegetable Food. 2. That it is therefore highly probable, that an infinitely good and wise Being would not appoint in his first Intention, <HI>animal</HI> but <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, at least to his <HI>in∣telligent</HI> and rational Creation, and which ac∣cordingly is confirm'd from <HI>Revelation:</HI> And, 3. The chief Assertion here made, is, That in Consequence of these two <HI>Propositions</HI> it fol∣lows, that <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, Seeds especially, must be the proper <HI>Antidote,</HI> and Cure of the Diseases brought on by <HI>animal</HI> Food. But, II. It may be consider'd, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> asserts, that this whole <HI>Creation,</HI> the whole <HI>System,</HI> but chiefly this our <HI>Globe,</HI> with all its Inhabitants, <HI>labours,</HI> and is under a <HI>mortal</HI> Distemper, and in <HI>Tra∣vail,</HI> like a parturient Woman, to throw off this present <HI>Load of Corruption, Deteriority,</HI> and <HI>Lapse,</HI> that it may regain its ori∣ginal <HI>Spirituality, Purity,</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI>; it is at present in a State of <HI>Expiation, Purifica∣tion,</HI> and <HI>progressive Perfection</HI>; every Thing is out of its natural Order, the <HI>System</HI> is, as it were, in a Fever, and every Part and Particle is in Action, (like the Body of a Man in a <HI>febrile Fermentation</HI>), to throw off its peccant Hu∣mours,
<PB N="84" REF="177"/>
and to bring the whole Compound into <HI>Order, Regularity,</HI> and <HI>perfect Health.</HI> But, III. These very Appearances on which the Objection is founded, confirm to a <HI>Demonstra∣tion,</HI> what I assert, <HI>viz.</HI> That all <HI>animal</HI> Life here is in an <HI>expiatory, purifying,</HI> and <HI>pro∣gressive</HI> State, towards its original Perfection; for it would be the grossest Contradiction, to suppose that an <HI>infinitely good</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> Being, should give Pain to any of his Creatures, for any other End, but to reclaim and perfect them; that He alone knows when his <HI>Justice, Purity,</HI> and the <HI>Amende Honorable,</HI> and the Infection of Impurity, are perfectly answer'd and cancelled, in their present State of <HI>Melio∣ration,</HI> and so knows when and how it is fittest to put an End to it by Death, that is, by the Rupture and Dissolution of their gross and earthy <HI>Prison,</HI> form'd out of this our ruinous <HI>planetary System,</HI> now spoil'd and defac'd; to set the indwelling <HI>spiritual</HI> Inhabitant free into some more <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>refin'd System</HI>; and that <HI>animal</HI> Life of all Kinds and Degrees, does and must necessarily suffer here, by bodily Wants and Infirmities, by the Injuries and Inclemen∣cies of <HI>Seasons,</HI> by the <HI>Rapacity</HI> and <HI>Ferocity</HI> of their Fellow-Creatures, besides a thousand other <HI>Accidents,</HI> and at last most intensely by their Death, and the Rupture of their outward Shell or Tabernacle; From all this is a plain De∣monstration, that they are in a State of Suffer∣ing, Expiation, and progressive Purification, and

that at last they will all be set at Liberty, and become the Sons and Children of God in some Degree or Order or other, according to his original Intention, and the Plan of this his universal <HI>Monarchy</HI> and Kingdom, laid before the Foundation of the World; and all this Darkness, Sufferings, and unintelligible Play, is only to save human Liberty, and produce at last <HI>pure Love</HI> and <HI>naked Faith.</HI> IV. No body ever denied, that <HI>Animals</HI> of all Kinds might be destroyed, even <HI>intelligent</HI> as well as <HI>sen∣tient,</HI> when it is done for some wise or use∣ful Purpose, as in <HI>Self-defence,</HI> or even for moral Purposes, implicitly to admonish and teach others their Duty, what they deserve, or what they are to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>hope</HI>; these Pur∣poses, with all their particular Circumstances, are under the <HI>moral</HI> Government of an infi∣nitely wise Being. The only <HI>Question</HI> here is, Whether they may reasonably and justly be put to <HI>Pain</HI> unnecessarily and <HI>wantonly,</HI> or for no wise End or Purpose, but only to scratch <HI>callous</HI> Pallates, when other Means of Health may be had more effectual, and no less plea∣sant. V. It is not altogether <HI>Fact,</HI> that Ani∣mals devour one another from any other Rea∣son, but for Want of sufficient Plenty of pro∣per vegetable Food, as Seeds, tender Plants, mealy Roots, and the like, which even the most <HI>carnivorous</HI> Animals will brouze on, when they can meet with it in Plenty, as is well known in <HI>natural History</HI>; and even the
<PB N="86" REF="179"/>
Fish, which of all Animals are the most <HI>vora∣cious,</HI> will readily feed on Balls of Meal and Milk, without offering to devour one another; as the <HI>ingenious</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrews</HI> of <HI>Norfolk</HI> has found by Experiment; for having put several Sorts of small and great Fishes together into a large whiten'd <HI>Pond</HI> of clear Water, where they might all be easily seen and number'd, and feed∣ing them with Balls made of Milk and Flower, (which were put into pervious <HI>Troughs</HI>) he found, at least thought, that they did not offer the least Violence to one another. VI. Allowing Ani∣mals to be actuated by a spiritual or immaterial Principle, of the same <HI>Nature</HI> with intelligent Creatures, yet they are not of the same De∣gree and Order with them; they may be <HI>intel∣ligent</HI> Creatures of an <HI>inferior Order,</HI> begin∣ning lower, and verging more slowly towards their intended Perfection; they may be under different Conditions of Purification, and may pass the whole of their Duration here, in the State of <HI>Infants,</HI> who dye before they are born, or before they arrive at the Use of Rea∣son, and yet in other States of Being may grow and advance to a much higher Perfection of <HI>Sensation</HI> and <HI>Intelligence</HI> than we can readily imagine. For to me it seems utterly incredible, that any Creature, whether <HI>sen∣tient</HI> or <HI>intelligent,</HI> should come into this <HI>State</HI> of Being and Suffering, for no other Pur∣pose than we see them attain here; and it is equally incredible, that any Creature should
<PB N="87" REF="180"/>
spontaneously exert animal and muscular Func∣tion, <HI>i.e.</HI> should live and feel, without some Degree of an <HI>immaterial, immortal,</HI> and <HI>self∣active</HI> Spirit. Matter and its Laws, can never account for such Appearances. There must be some infinitely beautiful, wise and good <HI>Scene</HI> remaining for all <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Be∣ings, the Discovery of which will ravish and astonish us one Day. Moderately wise Ends, Purposes, and Means, are unworthy of infinite Perfection; whatever <HI>God</HI> does must be every way worthy of Himself: His <HI>Working</HI> may serve many wise and good Ends and Purposes here, but the last and great End of all must be of <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Majesty</HI> worthy of Him, tho' we cannot yet a great while comprehend it.</P>

<P>§. 12. To conclude: 1. It is plain from <HI>Re∣velation,</HI> that <HI>animal Food</HI> was <HI>permitted,</HI> and <HI>fermented Liquors</HI> not <HI>forbidden</HI>; and conse∣quently, that there is neither <HI>Virtue</HI> nor <HI>Vice</HI> in the Use of them absolutely, but in the Or∣der, Time, Quantity, and other Circumstances of their Usage. 2. That in our present <HI>Situ∣ation,</HI> and under our present Circumstances, for <HI>some</HI> Persons, and in Order for <HI>some</HI> Pur∣poses, a reasonable Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> may be absolutely ne∣cessary. 3.

<PB N="88" REF="181"/>
are the true efficient and most general Cause of most <HI>atrocious</HI> and dangerous Distempers; and consequently, that <HI>vegetable Food,</HI> and <HI>unfer∣mented Liquors,</HI> are the true and natural <HI>An∣tidote</HI> of such Distempers. 4. That <HI>animal Food,</HI> and <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> will more pro∣bably, and more naturally cause Distempers, and shorten Life, than <HI>vegetable Food,</HI> and <HI>un∣fermented Liquors.</HI> 5. That a moderate and small Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and <HI>generous fermented Liquors,</HI> will naturally tighten, harden, and strengthen, give Firmness and Force to animal Solids and Fibres, and enrich, warm, and invigorate the Blood and Juices; and consequently, is safest to all subject to eruptive Distempers, as Gout, Erisipelas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>Fits.</HI> But at the same time that it hardens and tightens the Solids, it condenses and thickens the Juices, and renders the Animal of a shorter <HI>Duration</HI> of Life, and more subject to <HI>Dis∣eases. 6. Lastly,</HI> That for bodily Strength, <HI>animal Food,</HI> and <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI> seem fittest; but for <HI>intellectual</HI> Exercises, <HI>vegetable Food,</HI> and <HI>unfermented Liquors,</HI> seem appro∣priated; and that consequently, the best Way to secure the <HI>golden Mediocrity,</HI> between <HI>bo∣dily</HI> Strength and <HI>spiritual</HI> Force, (the State fittest for the Generality of Mankind) is for the healthy to confine themselves to about a Pound, at least half a Pound, of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and a Pint, at least half a Pint of <HI>fermented Liquors,</HI>

daily: But for the unhealthy, <HI>valetudinary,</HI> and studious, to sink below this <HI>Medium</HI> in both these, till, by Experience and Observa∣tion, they find that Quantity of either, they are easiest under, and to stick to that, should it even be to descend totally into Vegetables, Milk and Seeds, with unfermented Liquors.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Elements,</HI> or least and last Particles of <HI>Matter,</HI> are of various <HI>Sizes, Den∣sities</HI> and <HI>Figures.</HI> Those of the <HI>first Order,</HI> or the very least, are almost infinitely small, hard and <HI>elastic,</HI> pervading all Bodies but per∣vious to none; such as are probably the Par∣ticles of the <HI>Etherial</HI> or <HI>Newtonian</HI> Fluid. The Particles of the <HI>second Order</HI> are com∣pos'd of these, and consequently are of a greater Size, but less <HI>dense</HI> and <HI>elastic,</HI> being pervious to the Particles of the first Order, and themselves pervading all others: Of this kind are probably the Particles of <HI>Light.</HI> The Par∣ticles of the <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>Order,</HI> are com∣pos'd of those of the second Order, bearing such Proportion to them in Size, <HI>Density</HI> and

<HI>Elasticity,</HI> as they do to those of the <HI>first Order.</HI></P>

<P>IT is beyond all Doubt, that the Quantity of <HI>solid</HI> Matter in this material <HI>System</HI> is very small, in respect of the interspers'd <HI>Vacuities.</HI> It is demonstrably certain, that a solid <HI>Cube</HI> or <HI>Sphere</HI> of a Mile or Furlong, or even a Yard in <HI>Diameter,</HI> being divided sufficiently small, and its Parts ranged in a proper <HI>Order,</HI> would furnish <HI>Solidity</HI> enough to answer all Appear∣ances. Suppose the Particles all <HI>Cubes,</HI> and to be so united by the <HI>Contact</HI> of their <HI>Angles</HI> as to make <HI>cubical</HI> Interstices, then the <HI>Va∣cuity</HI> would be equal to the <HI>Solidity</HI>; and since Matter is divisible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> this Va∣cuity may be encreas'd to any Proportion of <HI>Majority.</HI> We actually find that <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> will pass through the <HI>Pores</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI>; and Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has demonstrated, that <HI>Gold</HI> must have many times more <HI>Pores</HI> than solid <HI>Parts,</HI> and yet it is the heaviest of all Bodies. <HI>Light</HI> passes through the most opake Bodies, when shreded sufficiently thin, it scarce meets with any Resistance in its Passage through clear <HI>Glass</HI>; and <HI>Aether</HI> pervades all Bodies with very little or no Resistance: From all which it manifestly appears, how small a Pro∣portion there is between the <HI>Solidity</HI> and <HI>Va∣cuities</HI> in our <HI>System.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Analogous</HI> to, of the same Nature, and probably from the same Cause, with <HI>Gra∣vity</HI> in the great Bodies of Universe, (the <HI>Sun, Planets</HI> and <HI>Fixt Stars</HI>) which acts as the Squares of the Distance reciprocally, there is in the least and <HI>elementary</HI> Particles of Mat∣ter, a Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Repulsion,</HI> whereby they <HI>attract</HI> and <HI>repell</HI> one another, according to some constant and invariable <HI>Law,</HI> whatever that may be.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="scholium">

<P>WHAT this <HI>Law</HI> is, by which the <HI>Par∣ticles</HI> of <HI>Matter attract</HI> and <HI>repel</HI> each other, no Observations or Experiments hitherto made have been sufficient to determine; only thus much is certain, that in receding from the Point of <HI>Contact,</HI> it decreases in a greater Pro∣portion
<PB N="95" REF="188"/>
than that of the <HI>duplicate Ratio</HI> of the Distance <HI>reciprocally</HI>; for by that Law, the Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> at any small assignable Distance, would be nearly the same; whereas it is manifest from Observation and Experi∣ence, that it is exerted only at or near the Point of <HI>Contact.</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has cal∣culated from the <HI>Inflection</HI> of the Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> that the attracting Force in the Point of Contact is 10000,0000,0000,0000 times greater than the Force of <HI>Gravity</HI>; and the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> has shewn by a great Va∣riety of <HI>Experiments,</HI> that the <HI>repulsive,</HI> or <HI>elastic</HI> Force, (which probably arise from one and the same Cause) in some sorts of <HI>Par∣ticles,</HI> are likewise <HI>immensly</HI> great.</P>

<P>SINCE it has been found, that a <HI>Thermo∣meter</HI> in an exhausted Receiver, will rise and fall as much, and almost as soon, as another <HI>Thermometer</HI> placed by it in the open Air, it seems to follow, that <HI>Heat</HI> is conveyed and propagated from one Body to another, by some <HI>subtle elastic Fluid,</HI> pervading all Bodies; and it is not improbable, that the <HI>Vibrations</HI> of this <HI>Medium</HI> in hot Bodies, contribute to the Intenseness and Duration of their <HI>Heat.</HI> And since smooth polish'd Bo∣dies, with <HI>plain Surfaces,</HI> cling together as strongly in an <HI>exhausted</HI> Receiver as in the

<PB N="110" REF="203"/>
all the <HI>cold chronical</HI> Diseases most pro∣bably proceed.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. THEREFORE the Particles of <HI>Mercury,</HI> from their <HI>Smallness, Weight</HI> and <HI>Sphericity,</HI> are fittest to make the <HI>Circulation</HI> whole and entire quite around.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THEREFORE <HI>Mercury</HI> is the only pro∣per <HI>Antidote</HI> for such <HI>Palsies,</HI> whose Cause is the <HI>Tenacity</HI> of the Juices in the small Blood-Vessels, pressing upon the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Fibres,</HI> and so interrupting their <HI>Vibrations</HI> and Actions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THEREFORE <HI>Mercury</HI> is the best <HI>Anti∣dote</HI> for the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> in the first Intention, by its <HI>Smallness,</HI> its <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Sphericity,</HI> break∣ing the <HI>Salts</HI> and larger Concretions obstruct∣ing the <HI>Lymphatics.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. THEREFORE <HI>Mercury</HI> is also the best <HI>Antidote</HI> for the <HI>Gout,</HI> in the first Intention, readily opening those small Vessels which are the most difficult to be dilated by reason of their Compression betwixt bony <HI>Articulations,</HI> even though their Smallness should be such,

that 200 of them can make up but the Thick∣ness or Bulk of one <HI>Hair.</HI> But a thin cool <HI>Dyet</HI> must continue them <HI>pervious,</HI> when <HI>Mercury</HI> has made them so.</ITEM>

<ITEM>8. <HI>MERCURY,</HI> by its <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Sphe∣ricity,</HI> will infallibly burst those Vessels whose Obstructions cannot be dissolved or opened, driving the Substance of these Obstructions through the Sides of the slender <HI>Lymphatic</HI> Ves∣sels; and will infallibly tear the small Vessels, whose Sides are very rare and slender, or whose Pores are made very large by <HI>Putrefaction.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>9. THEREFORE <HI>Mercury</HI> is a divine <HI>An∣tidote</HI> or <HI>real Poison,</HI> according to the Per∣son prescribing, or the Case it is prescribed in.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. THE best Preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> is that wherein its Particles are most minutely divided, and kept at the greatest Distance from one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. THAT Preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> is the best, where, after a due Division into its smallest
<PB N="112" REF="205"/>
Parts, the Mixture is made with <HI>that</HI> Body which has the most <HI>specific</HI> Virtue against the Disease. Thus the <HI>Aethiops cum Sulph.</HI> is best for <HI>Inflammations, Piles,</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI> the <HI>Erysipelas, &amp;c.</HI> and that with <HI>Antimony,</HI> against <HI>cutaneous</HI> Distempers; that with <HI>Vo∣latiles</HI> and <HI>Foetids,</HI> in <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases; that with <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Bitters,</HI> in <HI>Intermittents</HI>; and so in others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. THEREFORE the <HI>Aqua Mercurialis</HI> is the very safest general Deobstruent in very weak Persons, did it not require too long time to produce any salutary Effect. <HI>Mer∣cury alcalisated,</HI> or kill'd with any calcin'd Body, given often and in small Doses, is the next; <HI>Cinnabar next</HI> to that, and then <HI>Aethiops, &amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>13. ALL <HI>Mineral</HI> Medicines ought to be infinitely divided, before they are sent into an Animal Body; they never having been intended by the <HI>Author of Nature</HI> to enter there, but in their <HI>minutest</HI> Particles and Di∣visions; as we may see by <HI>Nature</HI>'s prepar∣ing, in this Manner, <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters of all kinds, fitted for the Cure of almost all <HI>chro∣nical</HI> Diseases, if join'd with a proper Regi∣men; except, perhaps, some few of those be∣got by unnatural cramming with Mixtures of Salts, Spices, Oils, and inflammable Spirits;
<PB N="113" REF="206"/>
or those begot by contagious venereal Dis∣eases.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. <HI>MERCURY,</HI> with the Salts, such as <HI>Calomel,</HI> the <HI>Turbith, Sublimat, red, white</HI> and <HI>green Precipitate,</HI> are, of all Preparations, the most prejudicial and injurious to animal Habits; these saline Mixtures tearing the small Vessels, where Diseases are mostly generated, and in whose Integrity, all the Delicacy of Life consists: But they are thereby of the quickest Effect in Cases that depend on Ex∣pedition, as the <HI>Hydrophobia,</HI> inflammatory <HI>Rheumatism,</HI> and the like.</ITEM>

<P>IN these few Propositions are contain'd the Principles of all the natural <HI>Philosophy</HI> hinted at in my medical Treatises. If it is just, or
<PB N="115" REF="208"/>
approaches the Truth, as I hope it does, then it must necessarily follow, 1. That soft, mild and cool Foods, are fittest to carry on the <HI>animal Functions</HI> the most readily, free∣ly, naturally and lastingly. 2. That <HI>Spirits, Salts, chymical Oils,</HI> (which are but Spirits condens'd) and every thing that has pass'd the <HI>Tortures</HI> of the <HI>Fire,</HI> abounding with Particles small, hard, <HI>caustic,</HI> (for calcin'd <HI>Antimony</HI> will be increas'd one fifth in its Weight) and high∣ly <HI>attractive,</HI> are most pernicious to <HI>animal</HI> Habits; not only burning and tearing the de∣licate <HI>Fibres</HI> and Vessels, like <HI>Caustics</HI> and <HI>Lancets,</HI> but by their <HI>attractive</HI> Powers, vio∣lently corrugating and contracting the <HI>Fibres</HI>; so that in habitual Drinkers, Drammers, and high Feeders, their <HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> is en∣tirely destroy'd, by their sudden and alternate <HI>Contractions</HI> and <HI>Relaxations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Hales's Haemostaticks.</NOTE>, while at the same time the Juices are thicken'd and co∣agulated by the spirituous Mixture, and so dispos'd to form <HI>Obstructions</HI> and <HI>Concre∣tions</HI> in the smaller Vessels: And there∣fore they ought never to be used, but as <HI>Spurs</HI> and <HI>Whips,</HI> to push on and stimulat the sluggish <HI>Organs</HI> for a time, and make them carry off the Over-load with a short Vigour; and so are only proper in Ex∣tremities, as a present Filip. 3. That <HI>ani∣mal</HI> Foods, whose Parts have been first di∣vided
<PB N="116" REF="209"/>
by <HI>animal Organs,</HI> and afterwards at∣tenuated and refin'd by those of other <HI>Animals,</HI> and mixed with great Quantities of <HI>animal</HI> Salts and Oils, when again taken into <HI>animal</HI> Habits for Food, where they undergo a third Subtilization or <HI>Milling</HI>; or the Flesh of <HI>Ani∣mals</HI> that live on <HI>animal</HI> Food, are so mi∣nutely divided, as (by Proposition IV.) to ac∣quire the greatest Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI>; and therefore, when introduc'd into the small <HI>Tubes</HI> and capillary Vessels, in great Quan∣tities, they must form <HI>Obstructions</HI> of the strongest Cohesion and Tenacity. 4. That <HI>Mercury,</HI> in some Shape or other, is the on∣ly proper Deobstruent and Dissolvent, in all <HI>chronical</HI> Cases, and in those <HI>acute</HI> ones that come nearest to them; especially in those who have fed much and long on <HI>animal</HI> Foods, and <HI>fermented</HI> or <HI>distill'd</HI> Liquors. 5. That <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> are not only the sole ra∣tional and proper Food of tender or diseased <HI>Animals,</HI> but, from the Grossness of their Parts, and their small Degree of <HI>Attraction</HI> and Cohesion consequent thereupon, being dissolv'd by a less Force than <HI>animal</HI> Food, are fittest to carry on, the most pleasantly, all the <HI>Functions</HI> in which <HI>Health, Serenity</HI> and <HI>free Spirits</HI> consist. 6. That therefore <HI>Milk, Seeds, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>mealy</HI> Vegetables, with Water-drinking, are undoubtedly the most infallible Means to preserve the <HI>Facul∣ties clear</HI> and <HI>acute,</HI> and to acquire <HI>Acti∣vity</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="210"/>
and long <HI>Life,</HI> whatever <HI>mechanical</HI> Force and Strength may require for sudden strong Efforts. 7. On the whole, as <HI>Water,</HI> with a little fine vegetable <HI>Earth, Salt</HI> and <HI>Sul∣phur,</HI> seems to me, to be the <HI>proper</HI> Food intended by <HI>Nature</HI> for <HI>Animals</HI>; and as it is <HI>Water</HI> alone which conciliats that <HI>Flui∣dity</HI> absolutely necessary to Juices circulating in <HI>Tubes</HI>; the more it partakes of this <HI>Ele∣ment,</HI> the fitter it is for the <HI>animal</HI> Func∣tions. <HI>Mercury</HI> seems to be the only other Fluid that has the Qualities fitted for circu∣lating and destroying <HI>Viscosity</HI>; so that, in fine, the two proper <HI>Antidotes</HI> intended by Nature for chronical animal Diseases, especially those of the worst Kind, seem to be <HI>Mercury,</HI> some-how prepared, and <HI>Water,</HI> naturally or artificially impregnated, the one for animal, and the other for <HI>vegetable</HI> Feeders.</P>

gradually and insensibly, and as the bodily and intellectual <HI>Organs</HI> are form'd; and that for this wise and gracious End, That the <HI>moral</HI> Powers and Virtues of the Soul may have <HI>Time, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Leisure,</HI> by repeated <HI>Acts,</HI> to turn into <HI>Habits,</HI> and so all <HI>three</HI> may equally develop and extend together, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>natural</HI> and radical Powers, (which in their Capacity, and original <HI>Energy,</HI> are invariable) and the <HI>moral</HI> Attributes of the Soul, and their mechanical and material Organs. <HI>5thly,</HI> But what is in this Case a Demonstration, is, that all the vital Functions and <HI>Sensations,</HI> are all perform'd by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by the Intermediation only of Motions, <HI>Vibrations</HI> and Tremors, properly modify'd and impress'd by Bodies, or their <HI>Effluvia,</HI> on rightly dispos'd <HI>membranous Tubuli, elastic</HI> Threads or Filaments; which Motions or <HI>Vibrations,</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> naturally, and by its own innate and <HI>radical</HI> Powers and Sa∣gacity, knows to denote the Presence of such and such Bodies, and their Actions. Thus <HI>See∣ing</HI> is perform'd by the Impressions of the Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> emitted or reflected by the Surfaces of Bodies, which by the Size of their component Particles, and other Circumstances, exciteing par∣ticular <HI>Vibrations</HI> and <HI>Undulations</HI> on the <HI>elastic optic Nerves,</HI> point out to the sagacious <HI>Spirit</HI> (innately and naturally endow'd with such a Ca∣pacity of Perceiving and Judging) the Presence of such and such Bodies: And in a Manner <HI>analo∣gous</HI> to this, is <HI>Hearing, Feeling,</HI> and all the other
<PB N="170" REF="263"/>
Senses perform'd, and muscular Motion may be perform'd much in the same way. <HI>6thly,</HI> To confirm all this, and that Observations and <HI>Fact</HI> may justify and demonstrat <HI>Speculation,</HI> it is certain, and almost infallible, that <HI>pon∣derous</HI> Medicines, duly and properly prepar'd and adjusted, and a <HI>low, cool, thin Diet,</HI> per∣sisted in, a due Time, and join'd with Air and Exercise, will generally restore the <HI>free</HI> and perfect Use of the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties, not only to those who have destroy'd or hurt them by <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Laziness,</HI> but even to such as have deriv'd them with their Birth, or from Accidents or Parents, if the <HI>Organs</HI> themselves be not intirely confounded or spoil'd; at least in some Degree, sufficient to demonstrat the Pro∣position; and every one knows that this <HI>Me∣thod,</HI> and these <HI>Medicines,</HI> only mend the Juices, and open Obstructions. Of this I could give some such Instances, having treated several such Cases, that I could venture my Reputa∣tion on some Degree of Success of the Me∣thod, when apply'd early and in due Time, before the <HI>noble Organs</HI> be quite spoil'd. And if <HI>Philosophy</HI> have any thing certain or true, it is this, that <HI>quo posito ponitur, &amp; quo sublato tollitur, in eo consistit ejus rei Essen∣tia.</HI> A great deal more I could urge, but this must suffice to the honest <HI>Inquirer,</HI> and fair <HI>Philosopher</HI>; else, nothing will.</P>

<HI>precise</HI> as we can reach in this our <HI>lapsed</HI> Estate, while we dwell in earthly Prisons, I mean by <HI>Philosophy</HI> or mere Reasoning only, without <HI>Revelation</HI> or divine <HI>Faith.</HI> And therefore, whatever <HI>natural</HI> Powers, Qualities or Faculties we find in our own <HI>Souls,</HI> (at least in the best and most perfect of our <HI>Race</HI>) we may safely conclude, there are Powers, Qualities and Faculties, eminently correspon∣dent and <HI>analogous</HI> to them, in the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> with the Difference that <HI>absolute In∣finitude</HI> has to the <HI>lowest Finite:</HI> and on the other hand, that there are <HI>miniature</HI> Resem∣blances in all finite <HI>Intelligences,</HI> correspon∣dent and <HI>analogous</HI> to the essential and funda∣mental Attributes in the <HI>divine Nature</HI>; and consequently that we may fairly reason and <HI>philosophize</HI> (with the Modesty and Humility that become the <HI>lowest</HI> of Intelligences) from our own <HI>spiritual</HI> Nature, up to the <HI>Divine</HI> spiritual Nature, keeping within the Bounds and Proportion mentioned. For Example; we find and certainly know, that in our own <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> Nature there are Liveing, Understand∣ing and Will, and that all our intellectual Operations are but <HI>Modifications</HI> of <HI>these: These</HI> then must be the <HI>natural</HI> Image of the <HI>divine</HI> Being originally impress'd on our <HI>Souls.</HI> We learn from <HI>Revelation,</HI> that in the <HI>divine</HI> Nature, there is a <HI>Trinity</HI> of Per∣sons, in <HI>Unity</HI> of Substance. We may then
<PB N="185" REF="278"/>
fairly conclude, that, in some Manner or other, the <HI>three radical</HI> Powers of <HI>Liveing, Understanding</HI> and <HI>Will,</HI> are the <HI>natural</HI> mi∣niature Image and Representation of this <HI>Tri∣nity</HI> in Unity. In the divine Nature, the three <HI>analogous</HI> and correspondent Attributes are, <HI>Self-existence, Omniscience</HI> and <HI>Omnipo∣tence</HI>; in other Words, Necessity of <HI>Being,</HI> infinit <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and infinit <HI>Activity.</HI> In all created Intelligences, there are a <HI>deriv'd</HI> Being or Liveing, <HI>finite</HI> Understanding, and limited <HI>Will</HI> or <HI>Freedom.</HI> This <HI>Analogy</HI> or Corre∣spondence, I say, between the <HI>divine</HI> Nature, and the <HI>spiritual</HI> Nature of all finite Intelli∣gences, may give us at least some general No∣tion of the <HI>Trinity</HI> in <HI>Unity</HI> (for <HI>Precision</HI> is incompatible with <HI>Finitude,</HI> and all I pretend to here, is to remove Contradiction and Im∣possibility, from an uncomprehensible and in∣explicable <HI>Mystery</HI>). <HI>Self-existence,</HI> or Neces∣sity of Being, is the proper <HI>Characteristic</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI> in Revelation. <HI>I am that I am,</HI> or I am the sole Being, that is <HI>necessary Exist∣ence.</HI> The <HI>Word,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> the <HI>Under∣standing</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>express Image</HI> of his intelligent Nature, the <HI>sovereign Reason,</HI> is the <HI>Characteristic</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> in Scripture.

Thus <HI>material</HI> and <HI>spiri∣tual</HI> Substances may be contrary to one an∣other, but not contradictory; being actually united, and some-how ally'd, in all intelligent Beings; and having some Qualities <HI>common,</HI> as actual <HI>Existence,</HI> and a Power of intending and remitting their <HI>Energy,</HI> or of <HI>Expansion</HI> and <HI>Contraction</HI> in their Substances and

This <HI>Re∣semblance</HI> is what we call <HI>Analogy,</HI> and runs through the whole <HI>Scale</HI> of <HI>Beings</HI>; every <HI>Being,</HI> besides its <HI>peculiar</HI> and distinguishing Quality, whereby it is determin'd to this or that particular <HI>Order,</HI> and has the <HI>Pre-emi∣nence</HI> of all below it; being also possess'd of all those Qualities that are to be found in any of the inferior <HI>Orders.</HI> As a <HI>Curve</HI> of any of the <HI>Orders</HI> has all the Properties of the inferior Orders of <HI>Curves,</HI> besides those that belong to its own Class or <HI>Species.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THESE different <HI>Orders</HI> or Ranks of Beings, being distinguish'd by their respective Qualities, the <HI>first Term</HI> of this infinit <HI>Scale</HI> will be simple <HI>Existence</HI>; the Addition of <HI>one</HI> Quality will constitute the <HI>second Term</HI> or <HI>Order</HI>; of <HI>two,</HI> the <HI>third</HI>; and so of the rest; whence the Number of Qualities with which
<PB N="232" REF="325"/>
any Being is endow'd, will determin its Place in this <HI>Scale,</HI> and shew its Distance from the <HI>first Term.</HI> Besides this Difference in the se∣veral <HI>Orders</HI> of Beings, there is also a Diver∣sity among those of the same <HI>Order,</HI> which proceeds from their possessing some of the common Qualities in a more or less eminent Degree.</P>
<P N="3">3. As <HI>God</HI> can have but one <HI>Model</HI> in all his Productions, every <HI>System</HI> of Beings will resemble all the other <HI>Systems,</HI> and each will be a Copy of the whole <HI>Creation.</HI> The <HI>ma∣terial</HI> World will be a Transcript of the <HI>spi∣ritual</HI>; and the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the <HI>one</HI> will be analogous to and correspond with those of the <HI>other.</HI> Besides this general <HI>Ana∣logy,</HI> there will be a more immediat and fla∣grant Relation between each <HI>material System,</HI> and the Intelligences to which it belongs; the Structure of the Bodies and other material <HI>Organs</HI> of these Intelligences, together with the whole Frame and Contexture of the ma∣terial <HI>System,</HI> being such as will best suit the Nature, Rank and <HI>Order</HI> of these <HI>Intelli∣gences.</HI> And this Relation probably will sub∣sist and attend them in all the Changes and <HI>Periods</HI> through which they pass; so that should the intelligent <HI>System lapse</HI> from its Purity and Perfection, the material <HI>System</HI> would fall into Disorder likewise, and under∣go some <HI>similar</HI> and <HI>analogous</HI> Change.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="233" REF="326"/>4. OF this general <HI>Analogy</HI> between the <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>material Systems,</HI> there are many <HI>Traces</HI> plainly to be discern'd by an acute and <HI>contemplative Philosopher.</HI> To instance only in the Similitude which our <HI>solar System,</HI> as now disorder'd, bears to the <HI>lapsed Intelligences</HI> that inhabit it. In the Centre of this <HI>System</HI> is plac'd the <HI>Sun,</HI> a bright and lively Image of the <HI>Deity,</HI> his ma∣terial inanimat <HI>Miniature</HI>; the <HI>Planets</HI> and other <HI>celestial Orbs</HI> revolving about him at their respective Distances, and performing their Revolutions in different <HI>Periods</HI> of Time, will represent the several <HI>Orders</HI> of lapsed In∣telligences, the different Degrees of their <HI>Lapse,</HI> and the Duration and Continuance of their <HI>probatory</HI> State. This glorious Body, the <HI>Sun,</HI> infinitly surpasses all the other <HI>Orbs</HI> in Magnitude and Lustre; they are no more, compar'd to him, than Points in the <HI>Circum∣ference</HI> of a <HI>Circle.</HI> They have no Brightness of their own; it is all deriv'd by <HI>Reflection,</HI> and is more or less, according to their Distance from him.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE chief Properties of the <HI>Sun</HI> are <HI>Attraction, Light</HI> and <HI>Heat.</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI>'s <HI>Attraction</HI> extends to the remotest Parts of the <HI>System,</HI> acting at all Distances, with a <HI>Force</HI> increasing in a certain Proportion as these Distances decrease. 'Tis by this <HI>At∣traction</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="327"/>
that the <HI>Planets</HI> are retain'd in their <HI>Orbits,</HI> and kept from flying off in the <HI>Tan∣gent,</HI> to which their <HI>projectile</HI> Force gives them a constant Tendency. Should the <HI>Sun</HI>'s <HI>Attraction</HI> cease but a Moment, the whole <HI>System</HI> would fall into the utmost Disorder, and be irrecoverably ruin'd. How like is this <HI>Attraction</HI> to the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> continually operating upon all created <HI>Intelligences,</HI> and powerfully solliciting them to a nearer Ap∣proach and Resemblance to Himself! Its In∣fluence is constant and invariable; were it pos∣sible it should have the least Intermission, the whole <HI>Creation</HI> would fall into utter Ruin and Destruction.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> is diffus'd through∣out the whole <HI>System</HI>; no <HI>Celestial</HI> Body is endow'd with this Quality but himself. This is an <HI>Image</HI> of that <HI>Light which enlightens every Man that comes into the World</HI>; an <HI>Emblem</HI> of Him who came forth from the <HI>Father of Lights</HI>; the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> of the new <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and of <HI>spiritual Nature.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THE <HI>Sun</HI>'s Light is always accompanied with Heat, the Principle of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Vege∣tation.</HI> In the other celestial Bodies there is some small Degree of this Quality, but it is originally deriv'd from or produc'd in them by the <HI>solar Heat</HI>; without which they would be barren and inhospitable <HI>Desarts.</HI> This
<PB N="235" REF="328"/>
represents the Influences of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which are inseparable from the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; and are the Principle of our <HI>spiritual Life,</HI> animating and cherishing every intel∣ligent Being, and making it productive of all the Fruits of Righteousness.</P>
<P N="8">8. LET us next consider the Properties of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and other Bodies that revolve about the <HI>Sun.</HI> Their various <HI>Magnitudes</HI> and <HI>Distances</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> with the <HI>perio∣dical</HI> Times of their Revolution, will express the several <HI>Orders</HI> of <HI>lapsed Intelligences,</HI> the different Degrees of their <HI>Lapse,</HI> and the par∣ticular <HI>Periods</HI> of Time allotted for their Trial and <HI>Probation.</HI> Some of these Bodies, as the <HI>Comets,</HI> move in <HI>Orbits</HI> that are very <HI>Ellyp∣tical,</HI> going off to immense Distances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> where the Influence of his <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> is almost insensible; but by the Force of his <HI>Attraction</HI> they are again drawn back, and brought even to a nearer Approach than other Bodies that move in narrower <HI>Orbits.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. THE <HI>Planets</HI> are constantly acted upon by two different Forces, <HI>viz. Gravity</HI> or <HI>At∣traction,</HI> and the <HI>projectile</HI> Force. These are contrary to one another, and always act in opposite Directions; the <HI>projectile</HI> Force give∣ing the <HI>Planet</HI> a constant Tendency to recede from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and to fly off in the <HI>Tangent</HI>;
<PB N="236" REF="329"/>
while the Force of <HI>Attraction,</HI> by drawing it the contrary way, prevents that Effect: So that by the joint Action of both, the <HI>Planet</HI> is kept in its <HI>Orbit.</HI> The <HI>attractive</HI> Force, though continually influencing the <HI>Planet,</HI> is not a Quality of it, but proceeds from the <HI>Sun</HI>; the only Quality belonging to the <HI>Planet</HI> is that of the <HI>projectile</HI> Force. This will shadow out the <HI>Lapse,</HI> the Action of <HI>Selfishness,</HI> and the inordinate <HI>Love</HI> of the Creature, with their Opposition to the <HI>divine Love.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<P><HI>PHILOSOPHERS</HI> tell us, that the present State of our <HI>System</HI> cannot be of long Continuance; but that the <HI>solar Attraction</HI> must necessarily prevail over the <HI>projectile</HI> Force of the <HI>celestial</HI> Bodies; and all the <HI>Co∣mets</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> with their <HI>Satellites,</HI> be at last <HI>absorb'd</HI> and <HI>swallow'd</HI> up in the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES about the Nature and Qualities of the <HI>Original Animal Body,</HI> and of its Progressive State, in its several Stages of Existence.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THAT there may be <HI>Animals,</HI> (and consequently animal <HI>Organs</HI>) per∣forming <HI>analogically,</HI> at least, the animal <HI>Functions,</HI> less than our Senses can discover, assisted by our best <HI>Art,</HI> possibly less, than our Imagination can frame an Idea of <HI>Page</HI> 1</ITEM>
<ITEM>Several <HI>Demonstrations,</HI> shewing the utter <HI>Impossibility,</HI> that an <HI>animal</HI> Body could be first form'd, or can be now continued, by
<PB N="240" REF="332"/>
mere Mechanism, or the Laws of Nature now obtaining; but must be the immediat Work, continued and supported by the con∣stant Influence of an omnipotent and omni∣scient <HI>First Cause</HI> 3</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>least</HI> and <HI>last</HI> Particles of Matter can be divided by no finite Power what∣ever 4</ITEM>
<ITEM>That their <HI>Figures</HI> were probably at first only <HI>Spheres, Cubes,</HI> and <HI>equilateral triangular Prisms</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That our now porous and confus'd <HI>Ele∣ments, Salts, Water, Light, Air,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> still have <HI>inherent</HI> Qualities, which distin∣guish them from each other, which they never totally lose, tho' these may be swal∣low'd up, when combin'd <HI>unharmoniously,</HI> as they now are 5</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the original <HI>Creation,</HI> and the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> Body, might have been, and may be, of this first kind of simple <HI>Elements, harmoniously</HI> combin'd; but are now crusted over, and <HI>discordantly</HI> blended with the gross secondary Elements of this <HI>ruinous Planet</HI> we inhabit 6</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Fineness of the original <HI>aethereal</HI> animal Body, may have been in <HI>Proportion</HI> to its <HI>Order,</HI> and the Perfection of the natural and moral Powers of the <HI>Soul</HI> con∣junctly 7</ITEM>
<ITEM>That this <HI>analogically, spiritual</HI> (so to speak) animal Body, might have been <HI>roll'd</HI> up,
<PB N="241" REF="333"/>
and <HI>concentred,</HI> into a <HI>Miniature</HI> of a <HI>Mi∣niature in Infinitum,</HI> in the Loins of the <HI>first Adamical Parent,</HI> till by its being suf∣ficiently plaister'd over with the Matter of this ruinous <HI>Planet,</HI> it became able to bear its now <HI>Inclemency,</HI> and be born into this World 8</ITEM>
<ITEM>That this <HI>primitive, aethereal,</HI> divinely <HI>or∣ganiz'd Body,</HI> by an <HI>individual Fitness</HI> and Congruity to the informing spiritual Substance, might have been thereby so inti∣matly and <HI>commensuratly</HI> united with it, that they could never after be separated by any finite Power, no more than the <HI>original Particles</HI> of Matter could be divided by such a Power ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the confineing this original <HI>spiritual</HI> Body and <HI>Soul</HI> so long a Time to so dark a Prison, as the <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Eggs</HI> of Animals are now, might have been for <HI>progressive Purifi∣cation, Correction</HI> and <HI>Punishment</HI> 9</ITEM>
<ITEM>That it is <HI>Fact,</HI> that the <HI>wisest</HI> and <HI>best</HI> Men, have been at first mere <HI>Vegetables,</HI> after∣wards mere <HI>Brutes,</HI> and but at last <HI>rational</HI> intelligent Beings 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings are by their <HI>derivative</HI> Nature immortal and un∣annihilable, and because <HI>God</HI> can never be contrary to Himself; but are in a <HI>progressive</HI> State towards Perfection and Happiness in their Order, like the several Orders of <HI>Hyperboloids</HI> 12</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="242" REF="334"/>That the <HI>natural</HI> Powers being uniformly constant and invariable, and the <HI>moral</HI> Powers being cancell'd by the <HI>Lapse,</HI> had not the <HI>natural</HI> Powers in their full Vi∣gour been suspended and fetter'd, they must have <HI>counteracted</HI> the Acquisition of the <HI>moral</HI> Powers 13</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>precise</HI> Knowledge, and <HI>mathematical</HI> Certainty, in the real Nature, and of the intimat Substance of any complex Thing, is incompatible with <HI>Finitude</HI>; and that the <HI>Degree</HI> of Certainty in Things, is only in Proportion to the <HI>Amplitude</HI> of the Fa∣culty 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>That subjecting all Creation to <HI>general Laws,</HI> was one infinitly wise and effectual <HI>Mean</HI> to secure <HI>Liberty</HI> inviolate, and to <HI>har∣monize</HI> the Divine Attributes, in the great Work of Restoration 17</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the only thing worthy of a <HI>Philoso∣pher,</HI> is, by <HI>Experiment, Attention</HI> and <HI>Induction,</HI> to collect as many of these <HI>general Laws,</HI> as he possibly can 18</ITEM>
<ITEM>That God being <HI>Simple, One,</HI> and always the same, must necessarily act by <HI>general Laws</HI> in all <HI>Creation</HI>; but that good and wise Men have been deterr'd from study∣ing them, in <HI>spiritual Nature,</HI> out of Dread of the odious Appellation of <HI>En∣thusiasts</HI> 19</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Study of these <HI>general Laws</HI> of in∣finit Wisdom and Sagacity may be a Part
<PB N="243" REF="335"/>
of the Employment of happy <HI>contemplative Spirits</HI> hereafter 20</ITEM>
<ITEM>That an infinitly rational and perfect Being could possibly have no other <HI>Pattern</HI> or <HI>Model</HI> for his Works of Creation at first, but <HI>himself,</HI> his own <HI>Substance, Nature</HI> and <HI>Attributes</HI> 21</ITEM>
<ITEM>That therefore there must be one perpetual <HI>Analogy</HI> and <HI>progressive Perfection</HI> run∣ning through all the Works of an infinitly <HI>rational</HI> Being; and that as <HI>Proportion</HI> is the <HI>Key</HI> of the material, <HI>Analogy</HI> is the <HI>Logic</HI> of the <HI>spiritual</HI> World 22</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Suffering</HI> is a <HI>mechanical</HI> and necessary Consequence of our present <HI>Situation</HI> on this <HI>ruinous Globe,</HI> and that none ever could avoid it absolutly, but in Degree, and that thro' the Merits and <HI>OEconomy</HI> of <HI>Jesus</HI> only. <HI>Sufferings</HI> become <HI>Blessings</HI> because Means of Restoration 24</ITEM>
<ITEM>That this <HI>Suffering</HI> is a natural and <HI>mechani∣cal</HI> Purification and Perfection of the <HI>Sub∣ject</HI> 25</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Consciousness</HI> of the <HI>End</HI> or Occasion of this <HI>Suffering</HI> is no way necessary to∣wards the beneficial Effects of it: That Consciousness would be prejudicial in the <HI>first</HI> Steps of this Purification; and only when its <HI>End</HI> is obtain'd, can it be benefi∣cial to <HI>clench</HI> its Effects 26</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the great <HI>Problem</HI> and Difficulty with the <HI>Best of Beings</HI> (so to speak), and in the
<PB N="244" REF="336"/>
<HI>Oeconomy</HI> of his Providence, and the Rea∣son of the present Darkness in it, is to re∣store <HI>lapsed</HI> Creatures, in Consistence with their <HI>Liberties,</HI> and the <HI>Harmony</HI> of his <HI>Divine Attributes</HI> 27</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the general Methods of Providence in restoreing lapsed Intelligences, are plainly, 1. The continuing <HI>general Laws.</HI> 2. The suspending the <HI>elicit</HI> Acts of the natural Powers for a Time, by Ligatures of this ruinous <HI>Planet:</HI> And, 3. By the admire∣able and adoreable <HI>Oeconomy of Jesus</HI> 30</ITEM>
<ITEM>That it is a Contradiction to suppose a <HI>bene∣ficent</HI> Being would create <HI>sentient</HI> or <HI>intel∣ligent</HI> Beings, for <HI>Suffering,</HI> merely for <HI>Suffering</HI>'s Sake ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>in∣telligent</HI> Creatures, in this present State, necessarily supposes a State of <HI>Pre-existence</HI> and a future <HI>Lapse,</HI> or a <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Trial</HI> and <HI>Probation</HI> 32</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there may be other <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Man∣sions, in infinitum,</HI> of <HI>progressive</HI> Purifica∣tion and Perfection; and that <HI>Suffering,</HI> which in the Divine Purity, and the Nature of Disorder, must have been <HI>eternal,</HI> is made temporary only, by the Merit and Suffering of <HI>Jesus</HI> 34</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>spiritual Substance</HI> may be conceiv'd analogous to, and not contradictory to Mat∣ter sublimed and refined by the Power of <HI>Omnipotence</HI>; but even this <HI>Idea</HI> is imper∣fect,
<PB N="245" REF="337"/>
and not satisfactory, their Substances be∣ing naturally destructive of each other, and their Qualities in all their Modifications equidistant. 37</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>spiritual Body,</HI> and immaterial <HI>Spirit</HI> crusted over with Clay, may for its Purifica∣tion progressively be an infinit time in <HI>deve∣lopeing</HI> these natural Powers, and in acquire∣ing the moral Powers defaced by the Lapse; but that now under the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> this will be perfected in a finit Time, and even the whole <HI>System</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI> is by ge∣neral <HI>Laws</HI> vergeing to some great <HI>Cata∣strophe</HI> or Change 42</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as being a Ray of the Divine <HI>Substance,</HI> or a Power emitted from his <HI>necessarily</HI> existent Nature, is immortal in its own Nature; but that the <HI>spiritual</HI> or <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle is only immortal by the <HI>Divine</HI> Order, and comparatively, as the first Particles of Matter are <HI>indivisible</HI> 43</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the thinner and lighter the <HI>Crust</HI> on this <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle is, the natural Powers will be elicited more readily and freely, and the moral Powers acquir'd more easily and fully, and the necessary Sufferings there∣by lessen'd 44</ITEM>
<ITEM>That since the <HI>natural Powers</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> are constant and always the same in their <HI>Root</HI> and <HI>Fund,</HI> it will follow, 1. That our acquir'd Knowledge is but Remembrance. 2. That there is in our spiritual Nature inherent and
<PB N="246" REF="338"/>
innate a <HI>moral Sense,</HI> and a <HI>natural Sagacity,</HI> as well as natural Sensations. 3. That there are innate Ideas of God and Virtue, and of mo∣ral <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> in the Soul, tho' sopited and unelicited, as well as a natural Power to perform the <HI>animal Functions.</HI> 4. That spiritual <HI>Sensation</HI> and <HI>Senses</HI> (justly ex∣plain'd) are Realities, and not Figures. 5. That the Soul, in her Operations now, can only use and employ the material Or∣gans of the <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle crusted over as they are with <HI>planetary</HI> Clay, which she must endeavour to extend, develope and mundify. 6. That <HI>Culture,</HI> Study and La∣bour in extending and perfecting the <HI>natu∣ral</HI> Powers, is but removeing Superfluities, cutting off Excrescences, and rendering the <HI>aethereal Vehicles</HI> and their <HI>Organs</HI> pliant and supple, and for the which we are now con∣demn'd to labour for our Punishment and Purification. 7. That the shortest Way to perfect the <HI>natural</HI> Powers, is to labour at the recovering the <HI>moral</HI> Powers 46</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Activity, Sensibility</HI> and <HI>Penetration,</HI> the <HI>animal Functions,</HI> the Passions, Senti∣ments, Memory, Imagination, and the other more material and less abstracted Opera∣tions of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and even the <HI>involuntary Functions,</HI> the voluntary Motions of the Bo∣dy, are more immediatly performed by the <HI>self-moveing,</HI> immaterial, naturally sagacious <HI>Spirit,</HI> on the primitive <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle
<PB N="247" REF="339"/>
divinely organised, but now crusted over with Clay, as Springs and Weights move Clock-works, the first tho' having an <HI>in∣nate</HI> Principle of <HI>Self-action,</HI> the other only an <HI>extraneous</HI> and adventitious one 48</ITEM>
<ITEM>That in this <HI>progressive</HI> endless <HI>Purification</HI> and Perfection of an Animal in Body and Spirit, there may be many Steps, Stations and <HI>Mansions,</HI> and, one finished, another may begin, till the <HI>final</HI> Completion 50</ITEM>
<ITEM>That in this endless <HI>progressive</HI> Purification towards consummat Perfection and Happi∣ness, there may be a particular <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Attraction,</HI> Fitness and Similarity, propor∣tion'd to the Acquisition of the <HI>moral</HI> Powers, and Extension of the natural Powers, that may draw and determine them to their several <HI>Stations</HI> and <HI>Mansions,</HI> as the Eggs of <HI>Insects</HI> and Seeds of <HI>Plants</HI> are by <HI>Electricity</HI> drawn to their proper <HI>Nidus</HI>'s and Leaves, till like the <HI>Asymptots</HI> of Hy∣perbola's they come at last to meet in their Curve ibid.</ITEM>

<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES about the Preference of <HI>Vegetable</HI> to <HI>Animal Food</HI>; and of the End and Design of Providence in <HI>Ap∣pointing</HI> the first, and, on Trial, <HI>Permitting</HI> the latter.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THAT by our present <HI>Frame,</HI> we are fit∣ted as for <HI>Vegetable,</HI> so for <HI>Animal</HI> Food, at least in the Days of our Vi∣gour; but that <HI>Animal</HI> Food, on Trial, and consequent Miscarriage, under the first intended and appointed <HI>Vegetable</HI> Food, was permitted by the Author of Nature, as a <HI>pis alle,</HI> 1. To let us feel the natural and
<PB N="249" REF="341"/>
necessary Effects of our own <HI>Lusts</HI> and <HI>Concupiscence.</HI> 2. To produce naturally and <HI>mechanically</HI> those Pains, Miseries and Distempers, that might create a Horror of inordinat <HI>Lusts</HI> and <HI>Appetites,</HI> and afford Time and Opportunities to ponder and think, and thereby to return to <HI>Order, Love of Virtue,</HI> and its <HI>Source.</HI> 3. To shorten the Duration of our natural Lives, that Sin and Misery might not increase, or last <HI>eternally.</HI> 4. To <HI>concentre</HI> our natural Powers to a <HI>Level</HI> with our defaced moral Powers, that, without clashing, they might rise, and be restored, in the same <HI>Progres∣sion.</HI> And, 5. Perhaps to connive at what, without committing Violence on Liberty, could not at that Time be prevented. 55</ITEM>
<ITEM>That our present earthly Bodies being compos'd of the now <HI>secondary Sulphur, Salt, Air, Water</HI> and <HI>fine Earth,</HI> only, and it being certain, from <HI>chymical</HI> Experiments, that <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> are the two most active and destructive <HI>Elements,</HI> and that the <HI>three</HI> last, <HI>Air, Water</HI> and <HI>fine Earth,</HI> are more innocent, the less active and deleterious, and <HI>Animal</HI> Food abounding most in the two first, and <HI>Vegetable</HI> in the three last; con∣sequently <HI>Animal</HI> Food must be more de∣structive to <HI>Animal Bodies</HI> than <HI>Vegetable</HI> in the same Proportion. 2. Because by <HI>Experiment</HI> the Juice and nourishing <HI>Ex∣tract</HI> of Animal Food is more <HI>tenacious</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="342"/>
and <HI>glewy</HI> than that of Vegetable Food. 3. Because <HI>Animal Food</HI> abounding more with <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> and they by their Nature being always in perpetual Motion and Action, must <HI>mechanically</HI> tear <HI>Ani∣mal</HI> Substances faster than Vegetables, which abound most with the more <HI>passive</HI> and innocent <HI>Elements</HI>; especially, 4.

<ITEM><PB N="251" REF="343"/>That since what is, and <HI>necessarily</HI> is, must be a Part of the <HI>Intention</HI> of the <HI>Creator,</HI> and since <HI>Animal</HI> Food necessarily begets Diseases and Pains more readily than <HI>Vege∣table</HI> Food can, there is no accounting for the Permission of <HI>Animal</HI> Food, but by supposing Pain and Suffering here a neces∣sary Mean of <HI>Expiation</HI> and <HI>Purification,</HI> which <HI>GOD,</HI> on <HI>Trial,</HI> finding nothing else could reclaim his <HI>rebellious</HI> Creatures, <HI>unwillingly,</HI> as it were, permitted it, as a <HI>Father</HI> sends his <HI>Son</HI> to the <HI>Correction∣house:</HI> And that, as when by <HI>Pride, Tyran∣ny, Malice, Murder</HI> and <HI>Brutal</HI> Commerce, by the more luxuriant and delicious Vege∣table Food, the <HI>Deluge</HI> came to its <HI>Pitch,</HI> he was forced to destroy both the People and their Food by this <HI>Deluge</HI> 62</ITEM>
<ITEM>That to those to whom <HI>Revelation</HI> is fami∣liar, the like Means of Correction will be evident from the Permission of <HI>Plurality</HI> of Wives to the <HI>Jews</HI>; and that under his immediat and miraculous Government, he, on their Murmurs, <HI>indulged</HI> them in a <HI>Mo∣narchical</HI> Government, as a kind <HI>Father</HI> admonishes his froward giddy Child to be∣ware of too familiar Approaches to Fire, by burning his Fingers 64</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there is no accounting for the <HI>Permission</HI> of <HI>Animal</HI> Food, on the Foot of <HI>Natural</HI> Religion, the wanton Murder of <HI>Animals</HI> for Food, when more salutary <HI>Vegetable</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="344"/>
Food can be readily had, showing a Cruel∣ty and Ferocity inconsistent with beneficent Natures; but that the <HI>universal Proprietor</HI> of Life and Happiness might, with great <HI>Wisdom, Justice</HI> and Kindness, knowing when the Term of <HI>Expiation</HI> of a lower Class of probationary, progressive or <HI>lapsed Animals</HI> is accomplish'd, give Leave, in the Course of his Providence, to put an <HI>End</HI> to their present Manner of Living, and ad∣vance them thereby sooner to a higher State of Being and Felicity, and at the same time <HI>secretly,</HI> and in Consistence with their <HI>Liberty,</HI> to admonish a higher <HI>Rank</HI> of In∣telligences what they merited; for these (to be sure for wise and beneficent) Ends, perhaps unknowable by us, <HI>GOD</HI> might have permitted the killing Animals for our Food, as he certainly did for Sacrifice; for this we have a <HI>Patent</HI> in Revelation, but none for fermented Liquors, but as <HI>Physic, Cordials</HI> and <HI>Stomachicks</HI> or <HI>Bitters,</HI> on Extremities, Sickness, inclement Seasons, Fatigue or in Festivals 64</ITEM>
<ITEM>That fermented Liquors of any Kind can ne∣ver, in their Nature, be proper, or the <HI>best,</HI> for <HI>Animal</HI> Health and Life; for they are the spurious Invention of <HI>Art,</HI> and the further Deviation from the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of Nature, which has given us no Intima∣tion of any such Kind of Beverage in the Preparations of pure Nature, and which the

Animals who follow the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> will not touch; they are properly <HI>Physic, bitter</HI> Draughts, and unnatural <HI>Cordials</HI> on Extremities, in Sickness and inclement Sea∣sons, and only design'd for a <HI>temporary</HI> Re∣lief, and occasionally. <HI>Fermentation</HI> con∣centres, condenses and contracts, as it were, to a Point, at least to a much smaller Volum, (like a <HI>Burning-glass,</HI> which condenses the <HI>solar</HI> Rays, to make them more <HI>fierce</HI>) all the <HI>deleterious</HI> Particles of the <HI>Vegetables,</HI> that is, their <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils</HI>; and is the true and sole <HI>Cause</HI> of all our great and atro∣cious Distempers, especially of all the Train of the frightful <HI>nervous</HI> Diseases which now rage universally in <HI>England,</HI> like a <HI>Plague</HI>; and have been increaseing since the <HI>Con∣quest,</HI> and since Wine has been familiar to all Ranks; and Water-drinking only, time∣ously begun in Life, is the only sufficient <HI>Antidote</HI> for these most wretched <HI>lunatick</HI> Distempers 46</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there are many Evidences of the Hurt <HI>fermented,</HI> but especially <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, do an <HI>animal</HI> Body; as, 1. That they harden and destroy the <HI>Digestibility</HI> of animal Food, and indeed of all kinds of Food in the Sto∣mach. 2. Because they <HI>corrugat</HI> and <HI>con∣tract</HI> the <HI>Fibres,</HI> and pin together the Par∣ticles of the Food, so that they cannot be so readily separated and divided into their <HI>integral</HI> nourishing Parts. 3.

their Heat and Activity, they bring the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>Membrans</HI> of the digestive <HI>Or∣gans,</HI> and all the other Solids, into too violent and frequent <HI>Vibrations</HI> and <HI>Suc∣cussions,</HI> and thereby break the <HI>Tone,</HI> and destroy the <HI>Elasticity,</HI> of these <HI>Organs,</HI> dis∣solve their Continuity, and so wear them out much sooner.

Because they <HI>stunt</HI> the Ductility and Growth of the ani∣mal Organs themselves, and thereby hinder their Developement, Extension, Elasticity and natural Strength, by continuing their <HI>linear</HI> or superficial Amplitude folded or rolled up 68</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Creatures are in an expiatory, perfectioning and progressive State, is evident, because here they must necessarily suffer; and infinit Beneficence could not possibly create any sentient or intelligent Being, merely to suffer; but chiefly, perhaps only, for <HI>Expiation,</HI> and consequent progressive Perfection and Hap∣piness. That probably the early and uni∣versal Precept of <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> might first introduce <HI>animal</HI> Food; which <HI>Sacrificeing</HI> might have been intended, 1. Silently and kindly to admonish the <HI>Sinner</HI> to consider what he deserves: In this silent manner pos∣sibly, for the preserving Liberty inviolate, all the Animals might, partly, be design'd to read us Lectures of Instruction in Mora∣lity, or of the Conveniencies of Life, in the same manner. 2. By a <HI>Prolepsis</HI> to

perpetuat the Expectation and Hope of some more <HI>noble Sacrifice,</HI> with such a View as the <HI>Eucharist</HI> was instituted after <HI>that</HI> Sacrifice had been accomplished. But yet this Permission seems to have been against the <HI>Grain,</HI> as may be gather'd from the Caution not to eat the Animal's <HI>Blood,</HI> in which its <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>deleterious</HI> Qualities alone consisted 73</ITEM>
<ITEM>This Aversion in infinit Wisdom and Good∣ness, to permit the Use of animal Food, which He condescended to, merely for the <HI>Hardness</HI> of the <HI>Hearts</HI> of his <HI>lapsed</HI> Crea∣tures, kindly to give them a forced Permis∣sion to do what He found they would pre∣sumptuously do, is further shewn by the Distinction between <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean Ani∣mals,</HI> which were not to be eaten; which in their Nature are more apt to <HI>madden</HI> the Passions, enrage Distempers, and produce an Aversion to Virtue. And tho' St. <HI>Peter</HI> had a miraculous <HI>Vision,</HI> to tell him nothing was <HI>unclean</HI> under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> yet that was not till the Doctrine of <HI>Self-denial</HI> and Mor∣tification was establish'd, as the Fundamental of <HI>Christianity</HI> 74</ITEM>
<ITEM>That some <HI>Vegetables,</HI> as <HI>Eastern</HI> Gums, <HI>Spices, Aromaticks,</HI> pungent <HI>Foetids,</HI> and <HI>Onion</HI> Tribes, are more destructive to <HI>Ani∣mals,</HI> than young white <HI>animal</HI> Food 76</ITEM>
<ITEM>To the Difficulties, that our <HI>blessed Saviour</HI> eat and drank with <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners:</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="348"/>
That he wrought his first <HI>Miracle</HI> to pro∣duce <HI>Wine:</HI> That he fed a Multitude by miraculous <HI>Animal</HI> Food: That St. <HI>Peter</HI> had a Vision to instruct him, that all Food was equal: It is answer'd, 1. That the Question only is, Which of the two Foods, <HI>Animal</HI> or <HI>Vegetable,</HI> was probably first intended by the <HI>Author</HI> of the Universe before the <HI>Lapse,</HI> and the Ruin of the <HI>Planet</HI> we now inhabit? 2. That different Repairs are necessary to different Degrees of Ruin, even in material Habitations. 3. That there is neither <HI>Virtue</HI> nor <HI>Vice</HI> in either kinds of Food, but in their <HI>Quantity,</HI> or as they are commanded by <HI>lawful Superiors.</HI> But that a <HI>low</HI> or vegetable Diet is naturally and mechanically more productive of Health and long Life, and consequently of <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> than a high <HI>animal</HI> Diet. 4. That our <HI>Saviour</HI> came to <HI>seek,</HI> to <HI>save</HI> those who were lost, and so was under a Necessity of converseing with the <HI>Volup∣tuous</HI> and <HI>Sinners:</HI> But that the Preference he gave to a <HI>low Diet,</HI> was implicitly included in his grand Doctrine of <HI>Self∣denial,</HI> and takeing up the <HI>Cross.</HI> 5. I grant, that in our present Situation on this <HI>ruinous Globe,</HI> it is <HI>impracticable</HI> and <HI>im∣possible,</HI> for Persons of all Ranks, Condi∣tions and Occupations, to live intirely on <HI>Vegetables:</HI> Their Use <HI>now,</HI> is only to cure, alleviat and lessen the <HI>Distempers</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="349"/>
generated necessarily by <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors: And, 6. Even these, and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, are sometimes neces∣sary on Extremities, in some Diseases, as <HI>Filips</HI> and Cordials for temporary Reliefs; and infinit Wisdom foresaw this Mischief of these high Meats and Drinks, and provided an <HI>Antidote</HI> for them, at least for a Time, 1. By makeing the great Bowel, the <HI>Liver,</HI> to draw off their Poison, and turn it into a <HI>salutary Medicin.</HI> 2. By forming <HI>mineral</HI> Waters of all kinds, with such Profusion and Variety, every-where on the Surface of the <HI>Globe:</HI> And, 3. By creating the Minerals themselves, <HI>Mercury</HI> especially, mechani∣cally adjusted for that Purpose, among many other Uses and Utilities, of ponderous and mineral Medicins, which probably were not in the <HI>same Form,</HI> or so readily at Hand, before the <HI>Flood</HI> 81</ITEM>
<ITEM>That to the Appearances in the present State of Nature, that seem to clash with this Doc∣trine (which consists only in these <HI>three</HI> Propositions, 1. That <HI>animal</HI> Food, in its own Nature, is more ready to produce Distempers than <HI>vegetable</HI> Food. 2. That therefore infinit Wisdom must have had wise and beneficent Ends in instituteing the <HI>first,</HI> and but probably permitting only the <HI>latter:</HI> And, 3. That therefore the latter must be the proper <HI>Antidote</HI> for Disorders produc'd by the former); it is to be ob∣served
<PB N="258" REF="350"/>
further, that at present our whole <HI>System</HI> is in Disorder, in a purifying, and, as it were, in a <HI>febrile</HI> State, labouring in a <HI>perfectionating Progression</HI> by general Laws, under natural <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Divine Attributes, which must at last terminate in relative Order, Perfection, and universal Happiness. That now there is no such thing as avoiding the destroying of <HI>animal</HI> Life absolutly; but that it should not be done out of mere <HI>Luxury, Wanton∣ness</HI> and <HI>Ferocity,</HI> which even the rapacious Animals do not, but from want of any pro∣per Food 86</ITEM>
<ITEM>That on the whole, it is plain from Revela∣tion, that, 1. <HI>Animal</HI> Food was permitted, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors not absolutly, but their Excesses, forbidden. 2. That in many Circumstances and Situations, a reasonable Quantity of <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors is absolutly necessary for a Time. 3. That it is plain from <HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> that Excesses in high animal Food, and strong fermented Liquors, are the true and adequat Cause of the great and atrocious Distempers. 4. That <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, will necessarily shorten Life (perhaps one half) more readily than <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, and unfermented Li∣quors, and in the same Proportion cause Distempers. 5. That tho' a moderat Quan∣tity of <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors
<PB N="259" REF="351"/>
will naturally warm and strengthen the Blood, and tighten the Solids for a Time, and consequently is necessary in all <HI>eruptive</HI> Distempers, yet they will shorten Life, and produce Distempers, much more readily than <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, and unfermented Li∣quors. 6. That for bodily and <HI>mechanical</HI> Strength dureing a Time, and for a transient Occasion, tho' <HI>animal</HI> Food, and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, be the most effectual; yet for <HI>intel∣lectual</HI> Purposes, <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, and <HI>unfer∣mented</HI> Liquors, are certainly fittest. But to secure the <HI>golden Mediocrity</HI> between bodily Strength and clear penetrating Heads, about a half Pound of animal Food, and a half Pint of fermented Liquors, in the intirely Healthy and Young, or rather less, seems to bid fairest in Quantity for that Purpose: The Valentudinary must gradually sink below this healthy Standard, till, by Experience, they find their own proper Dose 88</ITEM>

<ITEM>PROPOSITION I. THE least <HI>Particles</HI> of Matter are of various Sizes, Densities and Figures; the very <HI>least</HI> are almost <HI>infinitly small, hard</HI> and <HI>elastic,</HI> makeing the <HI>first Order</HI>; the <HI>second Order</HI> are compos'd of those; and these combin'd make the <HI>third Order</HI> 92</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOLIUM. The Quantity of <HI>solid</HI> Matter in the <HI>material System</HI> of the Universe, may be very small;
<PB N="261" REF="353"/>
and yet, if duely divided and arranged, might answer all the Appearances of <HI>mate∣rial Worlds</HI> 93</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. II. The <HI>least Particles</HI> of Bodies are indivisible by any <HI>finite</HI> or created Powers 94</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Analogous</HI> to <HI>Gravity</HI> in the great Bodies of the Universe, there is in the least Particles of Matter, a Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Repulsion</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. I. What the general Law of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Re∣pulsion</HI> in the <HI>least</HI> Particles of Matter pre∣cisely is, has not yet been determin'd; only in receding from the <HI>Contact,</HI> it is demon∣strable that it is greater than the <HI>reciprocal Duplicat.</HI> 95</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. II. If <HI>Particles</HI> attracted each other in the <HI>reci∣procal Triplicat</HI> in their Point of Contact, the Force of their <HI>Attraction</HI> would be in∣finitly greater, than at any assignable Di∣stance; yet it would not be infinitly greater than the Force of <HI>Gravity,</HI> since any Body may be separated by an assignable Force 96</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. III. <HI>Repulsion</HI> begins and goes on, where <HI>Attrac∣tion</HI> ends; and they probably go on accord∣ing to the same <HI>Law</HI> and Progression, but with contrary <HI>Directions</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="262" REF="354"/>PROP. IV. The Force of <HI>Cohesion</HI> in the small Particles of Matter, is in a compound <HI>Pro∣portion,</HI> of the Quantity of their <HI>cohering</HI> Surfaces, and the Quantity of their <HI>attrac∣tive</HI> Powers ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>COROL. Therefore the less the <HI>cohering</HI> Sur∣faces are, the less will be the Degree of Co∣hesion, and the least of all will be in <HI>Spheres</HI> or <HI>Spheriods</HI> 97</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. V. The Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> in small Particles increases, as the <HI>Size</HI> of the Par∣ticles is diminished ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. VI. The <HI>Gravities</HI> of Particles decrease as the <HI>Cubes</HI> of their <HI>Diameters</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>COROL. Hence, from the Smallness and Divi∣sibility of its Parts, <HI>Mercury</HI> is so easily rais'd; and Bodies may be suspended in <HI>Fluids spe∣cifically</HI> lighter than themselves ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. VII. If a <HI>Fluid</HI> attracts the Parts of an immers'd Body more strongly than they do one another, they will be equally diffus'd through it 98</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. VIII. <HI>Elastic</HI> Particles suspended in a Fluid after their <HI>Collision,</HI> will resile, and by their <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Reactions,</HI> cause <HI>Fer∣mentation</HI> and <HI>Effervescence</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. IX. <HI>Unelastic</HI> Particles suspended in a <HI>Fluid</HI> attracting each other, will sink and be <HI>precipitated</HI>; the same will be produc'd by diminishing the Gravity of the <HI>Men∣struum</HI> 98</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="263" REF="355"/>PROP. X. The <HI>Figures</HI> of the Particles of all unelastic Fluids must necessarily be <HI>Sphe∣rical</HI>; and the <HI>Elements</HI> of all Solids must be of some of the regular Solids, as <HI>Cubes, Triangles, Prisms,</HI> &amp;c. 99</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. The Figure of the Particles of <HI>elastic</HI> Fluids is of no Consideration, since their <HI>Elasticity</HI> depends only on their <HI>repulsive</HI> Force ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XI. The <HI>Elasticity</HI> of solid Bodies is the Effect of the <HI>attracting</HI> Force of their Particles ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XII. That Bodies under a <HI>Rotation</HI> fly off in the <HI>Tangent,</HI> is the Effect of the <HI>general Law,</HI> by which they continue in their <HI>State,</HI> whatever that be 100</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XIII. The <HI>Figures</HI> of the Particles, and their Actions on one another, arising from the Principles of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Repulsion,</HI> together with the Motions impress'd on them by <HI>living</HI> and <HI>intelligent Agents,</HI> will probably account for the Appearances of the <HI>material World,</HI> if adjusted according to their Laws ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XIV. <HI>Air</HI> is a <HI>System</HI> of Particles en∣dow'd with a repulsive Force, which being fix'd in all <HI>animal, vegetable</HI> and <HI>mineral</HI> Substances, are by <HI>Fire, Fermentation, Pu∣trefaction, Dissolution,</HI> or any other in∣testine <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Reaction,</HI> set at Liberty, and compose our <HI>Atmosphere</HI>; and hence

its <HI>Compression, Weight, Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Density</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. The <HI>Density</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> is propor∣tionat to its Compression, and therefore its <HI>expansive</HI> Force must be in the direct <HI>subtriplicat Ratio</HI> thereof 101</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XV. <HI>Earth</HI> is a loose Collection of the different elementary Particles of Matter, of all the <HI>three Orders,</HI> thrown together with∣out any regular Combination ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XVI. <HI>Water</HI> is a Collection of the <HI>So∣lution</HI> of tasteless <HI>Salts,</HI> originally <HI>crystal∣liz'd,</HI> but kept in Fusion by Heat; and dif∣ferent Salts are different Combinations of these with the other <HI>Elements</HI> 102</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XVII. <HI>Acids</HI> seem to be very <HI>attractive</HI> Particles of plain Surfaces, and <HI>angular</HI> Points ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. Possibly the Figures of <HI>Acids</HI> may be <HI>triangular Prisms</HI>; for all Matter must be figur'd ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. XVIII. <HI>Heat</HI> is the brisk vibrating <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Reaction</HI> of the <HI>repelling Nitre</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> and the <HI>aethereal Fluid</HI> with an attractive acid <HI>Sulphur</HI>; which <HI>Sulphur</HI> yields an inflammable <HI>Oil,</HI> an <HI>acid Salt,</HI> a fix'd <HI>Earth,</HI> and a little <HI>Metal</HI> 163</ITEM>

<ITEM>PROP. XIX. <HI>Light</HI> seems to be the vibrating Particles of hot Bodies, driven out by the <HI>repelling</HI> Force, with an immense <HI>Velocity</HI>; which is increas'd by the <HI>aethereal</HI> Fluid, and the <HI>Attraction</HI> of Bodies ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. I. Since <HI>Light</HI> is convertible into <HI>Bo∣dies,</HI> and <HI>Bodies</HI> into <HI>Light</HI>; it would seem, that Light is only the Particles of a hot Body thrown off with an immense Ve∣locity ibid.</ITEM>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES on <HI>Spiritual Nature,</HI> the <HI>Human Spirit</HI> in particular.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THAT the natural Powers of all <HI>Spirits</HI> are these two, <HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Willing,</HI> which suppose a third, <HI>viz. Living,</HI> as their Base 119</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all created <HI>Spirits</HI> naturally and philo∣sophically can be conceiv'd only as <HI>infinite∣simal Miniatures, Sparkles, Emanations,</HI> or, if I durst use the Words, diminutive analogous <HI>Particles</HI> of that infinitly perfect <HI>spiritual Being,</HI> who is so intirely <HI>One,</HI> that He cannot have Parts; yet have these Mini∣atures of Him an <HI>infinitesimal</HI> Portion of his spiritual Substance, endow'd with a propor∣tional

Share of his <HI>natural Attributes</HI> of <HI>Living, Understanding</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI>; and so are therefore necessarily <HI>immortal,</HI> and cannot be <HI>annihilated</HI> 120</ITEM>
<ITEM>That these <HI>Faculties</HI> or Powers are felt sensi∣bly and perceptibly by duely cultivated Spirits of all Orders, and follow by <HI>Ana∣logy</HI> as to the Substance of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and these <HI>Faculties,</HI> from the necessary Nature and Attributes of the <HI>Deity</HI> 121</ITEM>
<ITEM>That this Meaning is evident in <HI>Revelation,</HI> which says, <HI>Men are God's Images,</HI> and they are there called <HI>Gods</HI>; that is, they were at first made <HI>infinitesimal Divinities,</HI> endow'd with his <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Attri∣butes, in their Order 122</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Antiquity be∣liev'd, that all created <HI>Spirits</HI> were cloath'd with some material <HI>Vehicle,</HI> and that <HI>God</HI> alone was <HI>pure, immaterial, infinit Spi∣rit</HI>; and <HI>Revelation</HI> speaks of a <HI>spiritual,</HI> that is, of an infinitly refin'd and sublim'd <HI>Body</HI> 123</ITEM>
<ITEM>That neither <HI>material</HI> nor <HI>spiritual</HI> Substances are knowable by us at present, but by their <HI>sensible</HI> Effects and Acting: But that <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are <HI>contrary,</HI> tho' not contra∣dictory, in their most <HI>essential</HI> and distin∣guishing Qualities; Matter being divisible in <HI>infinitum,</HI> and Spirit indivisible: But what infinit Divisibility, Rarity, Elasticity and Ve∣locity in the Particles of Matter, might at

last effect on its Substance and Qualities, to give Matter a Nature different from gross porous inert Bodies, none but the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> can tell or compre∣hend: But they will eternally be even thus, like the <HI>Hyperbolic</HI> Curve and its <HI>Asymptot,</HI> probably like <HI>parallel</HI> Right Lines 125</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Living</HI> is probably actuating, governing and moveing a divinely <HI>organiz'd</HI> Vehicle, <HI>pri∣mitive, aethereal</HI> or <HI>planetary</HI>; and where∣ever there is any Degree of <HI>Life, vegetative</HI> (or divinely organiz'd Matter only) <HI>sensa∣tive</HI> or <HI>rational,</HI> there of Neceslity must be a <HI>spiritual</HI> (so to speak) Body, or an imma∣terial, immortal and progressive spiritual Substance, actuating, governing and move∣ing a divinely <HI>organiz'd</HI> Body of some Or∣der or Nature or another, or both united 126</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there may possibly be <HI>Orders, Ranks</HI> and <HI>Species</HI> of animated Beings, with divinely <HI>organiz'd</HI> Vehicles of all <HI>Degrees,</HI> gradu∣ally rising, from the <HI>Coralline</HI> to the highest <HI>Seraphim</HI>; and an <HI>Angel</HI> is only a <HI>spiritual</HI> Substance actuating a divinely <HI>organiz'd</HI> Body, of an Order and Purity a little higher than that of an <HI>unlapsed</HI> perfect human Be∣ing 127</ITEM>
<ITEM>That we plainly perceive how imperfect and unhappy Beings we are at present, we of the <HI>human</HI> Race; yet cannot possibly think
<PB N="273" REF="365"/>
that we came thus out of the Hands of our <HI>Creator</HI>; but must conclude we have lost our primitive <HI>Creation</HI> State by some wil∣ful <HI>Mismanagement</HI> of our own 128</ITEM>
<ITEM>That our <HI>primitive</HI> State must necessarily have been, 1. That our organis'd Vehicle was entirely <HI>supple</HI> and pliable to our Spirit; and, 2. That our <HI>Spirit</HI> was entirely <HI>pliable</HI> to the Divine Spirit 129</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all created <HI>Spirits</HI> being naturally <HI>free,</HI> must be necessarily <HI>fallible:</HI> That, on this Globe, there was never a thinking Being, come to any Degree of Maturity, who found not himself, at one time or another, miserable, and wish'd not to be otherwise; this State is called the <HI>Lapse</HI> 130</ITEM>
<ITEM>How this <HI>Lapse</HI> was brought about, is not ex∣plicitly revealed, and is not knowable by mere Reason or <HI>Philosophy</HI>; we feel that it is, and that is all we at first know cer∣tainly. GOD'S Design being to <HI>restore</HI> us, with the Consent of our own <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Harmony</HI> of his Attributes, discourages vain Curiosity in Particulars; all that is revealed to us is general and indefinit; we feel that we are imperfect and unhappy, and that is suffi∣cient to begin the first <HI>Steps</HI> of our Recovery into Order in Body and Soul; we are always certain in the Knowledge of our Recovery, of the <HI>second</HI> Step when we have made the <HI>first,</HI> of the <HI>third</HI> when we have made the second, and soon <HI>in infinitum</HI>; more previous Know∣ledge
<PB N="274" REF="366"/>
would but perplex and confound us, and draw us out of the <HI>shortest</HI> Road of <HI>Re∣storation</HI> 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>That it is not improbable, that the <HI>Lapse</HI> was brought about by Steps and Degrees, that Way of <HI>Lapseing</HI> being most natural to <HI>finite</HI> Crea∣tures, and many of the several <HI>Orders</HI> of Be∣ings might have been concern'd in it 133</ITEM>
<ITEM>That our <HI>Senses</HI> were given us to <HI>commerciat</HI> with <HI>material</HI> Objects, these of our present <HI>System</HI> especially, or others we may pass into; in which the <HI>Key</HI> and <HI>Logic</HI> of our Knowledge is <HI>Proportion.</HI> All we can pos∣sibly know of spiritual Natures must be from <HI>Analogy,</HI> without Violence on our <HI>Liberty,</HI> which make us mere <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and from comparing them with the Faculties and Operations of our own <HI>Spirits</HI>; and <HI>Ana∣logy,</HI> duly cultivated and cautiously guarded in spiritual Nature, is answerable to <HI>Algebra,</HI> or <HI>Analyticks</HI> in Mathematicks 135</ITEM>
<ITEM>That since <HI>God is,</HI> spiritual Nature and material Nature <HI>is</HI> and exists: All <HI>GOD</HI>'s Words and Works must therefore necessarily have a <HI>literal</HI> or <HI>material, spiritual</HI> and <HI>divine</HI> Meaning and Sense; the <HI>literal</HI> for Begin∣ners, the <HI>spiritual</HI> for the Advanced, and the <HI>divine</HI> for the Perfect. Perhaps it may be thus in the Account of the <HI>Lapse,</HI> and all the <HI>Group</HI> of this Affair certainly were literal, <HI>Paradise</HI> a Place of material Delight, the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> a Food to perpetuat the

then material Vehicle in Health and Live∣liness; the <HI>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> quite the contrary; the <HI>Serpent,</HI> the highest fallen <HI>Angel.</HI> The spiritual Meaning may refer to the moral Powers of the Soul, as the literal did to the bodily; the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> may refer to the Source of the Divinity, the <HI>Father</HI>; the <HI>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> to the <HI>God-Man Jesus Christ</HI>; the <HI>Serpent,</HI> the grand Deceiver; <HI>Paradise,</HI> the natural Powers of the <HI>Soul,</HI> which were contracted and sopited by gross Matter, upon the <HI>Lapse,</HI> after the <HI>moral</HI> Powers were defac'd by Re∣bellion, Disorder, Selfishness, and inordinat Love of the Creature 137</ITEM>
<ITEM>That by this <HI>Lapse,</HI> from the Principle of <HI>At∣traction</HI> establish'd universally in the <HI>spiri∣tual</HI> as well as <HI>material</HI> World, the primi∣tive <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle was gradually turn'd to a <HI>planetary</HI> one, such as we now live in; and thereby the <HI>Activity, Energy,</HI> and Ex∣tension of the <HI>natural</HI> Powers of the Soul were greatly confin'd and stunted, as to their elicited Acts, tho' they could not be so as to their <HI>Fund,</HI> and potential Nature; and now they must rise to Perfection in propor∣tion only to the acquir'd <HI>moral Powers,</HI> and by Labour and <HI>Culture,</HI> under the <HI>Oe∣conomy</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and by the Aid of supra∣natural Grace, be develop'd, extended and purified 139</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="276" REF="368"/>That perhaps all <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings, of all Ranks, must necessarily pass through a State of <HI>Trial, Probation</HI> and <HI>Apprenticeship,</HI> before they can be, even by Omnipotence, confirm'd and <HI>eterniz'd</HI> in <HI>Illability</HI> and <HI>Im∣peccability,</HI> as a <HI>Potter</HI> vitrifies his Ware by Fire; or a Smith <HI>steels</HI> his <HI>Iron.</HI> All that is necessary or proper for us to know, or be cer∣tain of, in our present State, is, that we are <HI>lapsed Probationers,</HI> and progressive to∣wards Perfection and Happiness; more pre∣cise Knowledge of our <HI>pre-existent</HI> or fu∣ture State might only retard our Progress 143</ITEM>
<ITEM>Whether the ruinous <HI>Planet</HI> we now inhabit, was the primitive Seat of <HI>unlapsed</HI> human Spirits, and by their gradual <HI>Lapse</HI> was in∣sensibly turn'd into its <HI>present Condition,</HI> is impossible for us now to determin. <HI>Para∣dise,</HI> as described by <HI>Moses,</HI> is now no-where to be found; and most <HI>Climats,</HI> on a Ba∣lance of Incommodities with Conveni∣encies, are pretty much upon an Equality to the Natives. We find <HI>Luxury</HI> destroys our <HI>planetary</HI> Vehicles, and <HI>Pestilences</HI> infect the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> and the Earth, as well as its In∣bitants: But it is probable, the Divine Power might suspend or accelerat the <HI>general Laws</HI> of Nature, to turn this <HI>Globe</HI> from its <HI>Pa∣radisiacal</HI> to its present State 145</ITEM>
<ITEM>An <HI>animal</HI> Body being a <HI>System</HI> only of <HI>me∣chanical</HI> Powers, compos'd of fine <HI>elastic infinitesimal</HI> Lines, or Threads form'd into

various <HI>Webs</HI> or <HI>Membranes,</HI> and they into <HI>Tubes</HI> or solid Bundles, are, by proper Li∣quors, kept for a time in due <HI>Elasticity,</HI> having under them the primitive <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle, which is the proper Covering of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and its immediat Instrument between it and the <HI>planetary</HI> Plaistering, which, when broken, drops, and perhaps they (Soul and <HI>aethereal</HI> Vehicle) pass into others, till its progressive Purification be finish'd into <HI>Illa∣bility</HI> and <HI>Impeccability</HI> 147</ITEM>
<ITEM>Matter is capable only of <HI>Division, Figure, Motion</HI> and <HI>Situation,</HI> and is passive and inert. <HI>Spirit</HI> is <HI>self-motive</HI> and <HI>self∣active,</HI> and must be the Principle of <HI>Mo∣tion</HI> in Bodies, without which they would continue for ever <HI>inert,</HI> but so far as their Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> or <HI>Repulsion,</HI> pro∣duc'd probably by some <HI>subtile universal Fluid,</HI> sets them into Action: But this Fluid seems confin'd chiefly to <HI>inanimat</HI> Matter; and does nothing in particular or eminently in proper animal Functions, but as the <HI>general Laws</HI> of Nature operate and concur with all <HI>material Operations</HI>; and the Whole of animated Functions seem to be <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>eminently</HI> transacted by the <HI>actuating</HI> immaterial Principle on the <HI>di∣vinely organiz'd aethereal Vehicle,</HI> which communicats its <HI>Energy</HI> to the <HI>planetary</HI> Plaistering. So that the material Spirit of Sir <HI>Isaac, Hugens</HI> and <HI>Leibnitz</HI>'s rapid Fluid,
<PB N="278" REF="370"/>
and even our common <HI>animal</HI> Spirits, seem to be without any Use, but in inanimat Motions and Appearances: And perhaps <HI>animal</HI> Motions and <HI>Functions</HI> may be better understood and explain'd, by supposing what is <HI>Fact,</HI> that our Solids, the <HI>Nerves</HI> especially, (which are the more immediat Instruments of <HI>animal</HI> Motions, and their Functions) are <HI>membraneous cellular Tubuli,</HI> pre∣serv'd in their proper <HI>Elasticity</HI> and Tone, by a <HI>milky Oil</HI> contain'd in them; and are <HI>mechanically</HI> adjusted at first by the imme∣diat Hand of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> and fitted to convey, from the <HI>immaterial Spirit,</HI> a Be∣ginning of proper <HI>harmonious</HI> Vibrations and <HI>Oscillations</HI> (which may perhaps be promoted and forwarded by the correspon∣dent <HI>Undulations</HI> of an infinitly rare <HI>elastic</HI> Fluid, disseminated thro' <HI>universal Space</HI>); which being sent, in a proper Direction, by the appropriated <HI>Nerves,</HI> to the peculiar <HI>Muscles,</HI> and divinely <HI>organiz'd</HI> Instruments, conveys proper Action, Energy and Motion to them; and <HI>Bodies,</HI> and their <HI>Effluvia,</HI> (so and so vibrating) may to the same <HI>mem∣branous Tubuli,</HI> communicat peculiar <HI>Vi∣brations,</HI> fitted to impress a Sensation of their Presence, and of Bodies, and their Qualities, to the <HI>intelligent</HI> naturally <HI>saga∣cious Spirit</HI>; so that the whole Work may be directly transacted between the <HI>Spirit</HI> and outward Bodies, by the divine <HI>Mechanism</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="371"/>
of proper bodily <HI>Organs</HI>; and the <HI>aethereal</HI> Fluid may be to <HI>animated</HI> Bodies, in their Motions and Functions, not essential, but accidental or commodious, for a more con∣venient Propagation; as Air is to <HI>Animals,</HI> or Water to the <HI>Fish</HI> 151</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Living, Activity</HI> or <HI>Liberty,</HI> and Intel∣ligence, in some Degree, and all their <HI>Modes,</HI> are necessary to all <HI>animated</HI> Beings, of all Orders; and the Difference in the Individuals of the same Order, depends on the <HI>Frame</HI> and Texture of their <HI>Vehicles</HI> in a great measure; so that probably at first there might have been no Difference of <HI>Sexes,</HI> that depending on a design'd different <HI>Configuration</HI> of this <HI>planetary</HI> Crusting. That some Power <HI>analogous</HI> to the original creative Attributes in the <HI>Deity,</HI> arising from his infinite <HI>Self-activity,</HI> might be communicated to all <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelli∣gent</HI> Beings, is not improbable. But how this <HI>infinitesimal creative</HI> Power operated be∣fore the <HI>Lapse,</HI> is not known: Perhaps by an intense <HI>Willing</HI> under the Influence of the <HI>Divine Spirit</HI> 153</ITEM>
<ITEM>It is highly probable, from the Necessity of <HI>Suffering,</HI> in the present State, that all the <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings, that shall ever <HI>live</HI> or appear on this <HI>Globe,</HI> were all created at the same Instant, miscarried in their <HI>Probation,</HI> and were all at the same time confin'd into <HI>infinitesimal</HI> Prisons of

this ruinous <HI>Planet,</HI> in the <HI>Miniature,</HI> Seeds, <HI>Ova,</HI> and <HI>Animalculs</HI> of the primi∣tive <HI>Pairs,</HI> or Stock, to be progressively propell'd into sensible Living on this <HI>Pla∣net,</HI> all by general <HI>analogous</HI> Laws, in their Order; and this progressive <HI>Propagation</HI> was kindly design'd, as a Mean of recovering their <HI>moral</HI> Powers, by the Benefits arising from the Acquisition of Virtue and Wisdom in the Parents, tho' the contrary has fallen out 156</ITEM>
<ITEM>There may be <HI>original</HI> Differences in the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>Individuals</HI> of the same Or∣der of Intelligences, some having one of the essential and natural Attributes of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in a higher Extent than the other, it may be sufficient to constitute the <HI>same Or∣der,</HI> that their <HI>Aggregats</HI> be equal: But the Perfection of the <HI>aethereal Vehicle,</HI> Cul∣ture, and the Acquisition of the moral At∣tributes, makes the most signal Difference in this State; as Air, Exercise and Diet im∣prove the <HI>Health,</HI> so does <HI>Culture</HI> in the Acquisition of the <HI>moral</HI> Powers of the Mind. The natural Powers are constant and inva∣riable, as to their <HI>Fund</HI> and Capacity; but are impeded from <HI>elicit</HI> Acts by the Clumsi∣ness and Want of due <HI>Culture</HI> of the <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>intellectual</HI> material <HI>Organs</HI> 159</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Mainoeuvre</HI> of Providence in the Restora∣tion seems to be thus: The radical <HI>natural</HI> Powers being constant and invariable in their <HI>Fund</HI> and Capacity, but the <HI>moral</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="373"/>
Powers being defac'd by the <HI>Lapse</HI>; infinit Goodness, ever acting by his own <HI>beneficent</HI> Nature, designing to recover these <HI>moral</HI> Powers, tied down the <HI>Energy</HI> and <HI>Elici∣tation</HI> of the <HI>natural</HI> Powers, by Ligatures of this ruinous <HI>Planet,</HI> at first into that of mere <HI>Living</HI>; and included the whole Mass of <HI>lapsed</HI> human Intelligences, in the <HI>Loins</HI> of <HI>One,</HI> or a Pair, who were to be the univer∣sal Parents, designing the <HI>self-active</HI> and <HI>self-motive</HI> Principle in each should, under certain <HI>general Laws,</HI> break and work off these <HI>Ligatures,</HI> in their several <HI>Orders</HI>; while they, by other <HI>general Laws,</HI> relating to <HI>spiritual</HI> Nature, (<HI>Prophecy,</HI> to wit, <HI>Miracles, Apostolick</HI> Lawgivers, superna∣tural <HI>Influences</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> and at last by the overwhelming <HI>Light</HI> and Love of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> his only begotten <HI>Son</HI>) should recover in them the defac'd <HI>moral</HI> Virtues 162</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence it is evident, the first and initial Steps of this Restoration must, in a great measure, depend on the <HI>Sanity</HI> of the <HI>Adamical</HI> Ma∣chin; because, when our earthly Tabernacle is greatly disorder'd, these <HI>elementary</HI> Steps in the <HI>Developement</HI> of the natural, and the Acquisition of the <HI>moral</HI> Powers, cannot be so readily brought about, which depends greatly on the <HI>Parentage</HI>; for the whole Aggregat of all that is connected with the
<PB N="282" REF="374"/>
Parents, their Bodies, Humors, and <HI>mate∣rial</HI> or <HI>spiritual</HI> Qualities, are transfus'd and transubstantiated through the whole, and descend to Posterity just as they possess them, and so the Children must fare accord∣ingly 163</ITEM>
<ITEM>It may happen, by Accident, by Disease, by universal Causes, that one Set of <HI>nervous Glands</HI> in the Brain, one Set of <HI>membranous Tubuli</HI> (the material <HI>Organs</HI> of Cogitation) may be more spoil'd, broken, and worn out in some than the others, both in Parents and Children; which will make a great Diffe∣rence in the <HI>elicit</HI> Acts of the <HI>natural</HI> Powers, and which will make the Difference between a <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> a <HI>Hero,</HI> and an <HI>Artisan.</HI> But this whole Affair is more immediatly under God's special and particular <HI>moral</HI> Government of his World; tho' perhaps by general Laws, only <HI>occasi∣onally,</HI> and on great and worthy Motives, suspended 165</ITEM>
<ITEM>That at present, the <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties depends, in a great measure, on the <HI>Sanity</HI> of the bodily Machin, seems evi∣dent, because, 1. The <HI>Adamical Machin</HI> was intended only to suspend the <HI>elicit</HI> Acts of the <HI>natural</HI> Powers in their most eminent Degree, to give us Fredom, by developeing and throwing off their <HI>Incrustation,</HI> to ac∣quire the <HI>moral</HI> Powers. 2. By Experience
<PB N="283" REF="375"/>
we find, that in Disorders and Distempers of the Body, the <HI>intellectual</HI> Operations are either inconstantly, weakly, or unsteadily perform'd. 3. It is <HI>Fact,</HI> that in <HI>seminal Miniatures,</HI> in <HI>Embryo,</HI> and Childhood, and for a long time, the <HI>Soul</HI> does nothing but perform the <HI>living</HI> and <HI>animal Fun∣ctions.</HI> 4. We find, that <HI>Luxury, Leachery, Laziness,</HI> strong Passions, <HI>inclement</HI> Air, <HI>Bruises</HI> and Accidents, that injure the Body, hurt and destroy the free and easy Exercise of these Faculties, in the Acquisition of <HI>Sci∣ence</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI> 5. We actually see, that as the Body inlarges, and the Organs of the Senses strengthen, the <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties and their elicit Acts grow stronger. 6. All <HI>intellectual</HI> as well as vital Operations, are perform'd by the <HI>Intermediation</HI> of <HI>modu∣lated</HI> and <HI>harmonious Vibrations</HI> on <HI>mem∣branous Tubuli,</HI> (the <HI>Nerves</HI>) and they ab∣solutly depend on the State of the Body. 7. As <HI>Luxury, Leachery,</HI> and <HI>Laziness,</HI> will spoil these <HI>intellectual</HI> Operations; so, on the other hand, a <HI>low cool Diet, Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> proper <HI>Evacuation,</HI> and the mild <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicins, will cure and mend them, and bring them often to the same, sometimes to a better State than they were before 169</ITEM>
<ITEM>From hence it is evident, that the whole Work of our Restoration, in some measure, de∣pends
<PB N="284" REF="376"/>
on <HI>ourselves,</HI> in Co-operation with the Divine Assistance, under his Providence, and the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of <HI>Jesus</HI>; the whole Creation, from <HI>inert</HI> Matter, up to the highest <HI>Cherubim,</HI> being, as it were, an in∣verted Cone rising from a Point, and made of <HI>infinitesimal Surfaces,</HI> as it were, conti∣tinually inlarging, (which makes their <HI>Or∣der</HI>) being all <HI>Pictures,</HI> less or greater, of the <HI>radical</HI> or natural Attributes of their <HI>Creator</HI>; but Men having defac'd their <HI>moral</HI> Attributes, are imprison'd in Gaols of this <HI>ruinous Planet,</HI> that by a progressive Ex∣piation, Purification, and Labour, they may recover these, and so become again <HI>similar</HI> to their Original, in their <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>natural</HI> Powers, and so become again <HI>infi∣nitesimal Divinities,</HI> in their <HI>Order,</HI> and perpetually happy 173</ITEM>
<ITEM>The human Soul has innate, constantly and in∣variably in it, all the <HI>natural</HI> Powers it was first created with, even now in its lapsed State, at least in its <HI>Fund, Capacity,</HI> and <HI>Essence</HI>; only they are suspended, chain'd down, and concentred, as to its <HI>elicit</HI> Acts, by the <HI>Adamical</HI> Tabernacle, like a <HI>Felon</HI> in a Dungeon, and will drop at last; and so perhaps passing through various <HI>planetary Gaols,</HI> will progressively recover the Use of their <HI>natural</HI> Powers, as they acquire the <HI>moral</HI> ones 175</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="285" REF="377"/>From whence it will follow, that the <HI>Culture</HI> of the natural Powers, the Acquisition of Sci∣ences, and all <HI>intellectual</HI> Exercises, are but <HI>Remembrance,</HI> cutting off <HI>Obstacles,</HI> and removeing Impediments, opening Passages, and widening <HI>Apertures,</HI> through this <HI>Ada∣mical</HI> Prison, which is the most readily and effectually brought about by endeavouring to acquire the <HI>moral</HI> Powers 176</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Memory</HI> is but an Affection of the <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> and <HI>Will,</HI> fixing the Attention and Reflection, like <HI>seeing</HI> in the <HI>Eye</HI> by the Effort of the <HI>Will.</HI> The <HI>Understand∣ing</HI> is passive and <HI>inert,</HI> as every material Organ is. It is the <HI>Will</HI> that is the ruling and commanding Faculty, and Sovereign in the Soul. The <HI>Will</HI> is infinit and unlimited, and may act in Contradiction and Contra∣riety to the Understanding; is so absolutly unlimited, infinit and unconfin'd, that it ex∣tends to all Distances, without the Interme∣diation of Body. Being a self-motive and self-active Principle, it is no less real in its Operations, tho' it do not always effect its Volitions. In it lies the true and essential natural <HI>miniature Image of the Deity</HI> 178</ITEM>
<ITEM>Some have thought, the <HI>Will</HI> of all <HI>free Agents</HI> so <HI>infinitly free</HI> in its own Nature, as it was deriv'd from the <HI>creative</HI> Source of Liberty and Power the <HI>Deity,</HI> that He
<PB N="286" REF="378"/>
left it <HI>free,</HI> hid and imperceptible directly from his own <HI>Penetration, Espial</HI> and <HI>In∣fluence</HI>; for so much they think a <HI>self∣motive Power</HI> necessarily implies, tho' but an infinitesimal one; and that even <HI>Omniscience</HI> knew not that the <HI>Angels</HI> had lapsed, till the Rebellion actually happen'd; but had, from all Eternity, provided for the Possibi∣lity of such an Event: That to ennoble his Creatures, and make them fit to <HI>commerciat</HI> with Himself, He might suspend his <HI>Om∣niscience</HI> to magnify his <HI>Omnipotence</HI>; and might designedly and <HI>arbitrarily</HI> not foresee (tho' He certainly always might) the con∣tingent and natural Actions of his <HI>intelli∣gent</HI> Creatures, to make them more worthy of Him. But this bold and unwarranted Supposition, tho' it might solve some Diffi∣culties about the <HI>Lapse,</HI> about <HI>Prescience</HI> and <HI>Predestination,</HI> and in the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of Revelation and the <HI>Restoration,</HI> is perhaps inconsistent with the Perfection of the Divine Nature; and since infinit <HI>Penetration</HI> and <HI>Sagacity</HI> will equally answer the same Dif∣ficulties, and is less derogatory from infinit Perfection, the former Supposition is un∣tenable, I think 182</ITEM>
<ITEM>As the <HI>trine</HI> Dimensions of <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Space,</HI> and their necessarily being neither fewer nor more, give us, in unanimated Nature, a lively Picture of the <HI>Trinity in Unity,</HI> in
<PB N="287" REF="379"/>
the Divine Nature; so the three fundamental <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>essential Powers</HI> of all intelli∣gent Creatures, carry up the <HI>analogical</HI> Picture higher; which perhaps passes through all the <HI>celestial Hierarchy,</HI> and all intelli∣gent Nature, up to their Source the <HI>Creator,</HI> who is the last and highest Term of this <HI>Cli∣max</HI>; as He is, so we are, in our spiritual Nature, with the uncomprehensible Diffe∣rence there is between the lowest <HI>Finite</HI> and absolute <HI>Infinitude.</HI> As in our Nature there is <HI>Living, Understanding</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI>; so in his there is <HI>Self-existence, Omniscience</HI> and <HI>Omnipotence</HI>; or, analogous to, in the Revela∣tion Language, <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> But as <HI>Living, Understanding</HI> and <HI>Willing,</HI> in us and all Creatures, are but, as it were, <HI>Modalities, Qualities, Faculties</HI> and <HI>Pow∣ers</HI>; in the Divine Nature, on the contrary, they must be <HI>Realities, Subsistences</HI> and <HI>Be∣ings</HI>; because every essential and radical <HI>At∣tribute</HI> in <HI>God</HI> must be actually <HI>God,</HI> be∣cause of his infinit Simplicity and Perfection. But this Representation of the Divine Na∣ture is here only alledg'd as an Allusion and <HI>analogous</HI> Picture, to take off the Difficulties in this inexplicable <HI>Mystery</HI>; and, in some Degree, to reconcile it to modest guarded <HI>Philosophers,</HI> of honest Hearts, who are conscious of their own <HI>low</HI> Rank in the Scale of Intelligence. The <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Sa∣bellian</HI>

Heresies being the two Extremes, are yet widely different in their Influence on Christian Perfection: The first dwindling the <HI>Merit, Dignity, Example</HI> and <HI>Satis∣faction</HI> of the Saviour of Men, into a mean low <HI>human Transaction</HI>; the <HI>second</HI> being only too <HI>philosophically</HI> nice and <HI>punctilous</HI> about the <HI>Unity</HI> of the Divine Nature; which tho', I think, this <HI>emblematical mini∣ature</HI> Representation of it, actually existent in all intellectual Nature, fairly reconciles, and makes as clear as our present State will admit 184</ITEM>

<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On NATURAL ANALOGY, its <HI>Laws,</HI> and some of its <HI>Consequences.</HI></HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THINGS may differ in <HI>Degree</HI> as well as in <HI>Kind</HI> 193</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 1. Difference in <HI>Degrees</HI> is where things having their <HI>essential</HI> Qualities the <HI>same,</HI> admit in these Qualities a <HI>More</HI> and a <HI>Less</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 2. Difference in <HI>Kind,</HI> is where some of the <HI>essential</HI> Qualities of things com∣par'd are <HI>common,</HI> some are <HI>different</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 3. By <HI>Ratio,</HI> or Relation, is meant the <HI>Reference</HI> or Connexion any two things compar'd have with one another, whose <HI>essential</HI> Qualities common, admit of a <HI>More</HI> or <HI>Less</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="291" REF="383"/>DEF. 4. <HI>Similarity</HI> is where there is an Equality or Sameness of <HI>Relations:</HI> In the Substance and essential Qualities of things compar'd, differing only by a <HI>More</HI> or a <HI>Less:</HI> In <HI>abstracted</HI> and <HI>simple Ideas,</HI> this Same∣ness is commonly called <HI>Similitude</HI> of <HI>Ra∣tio's:</HI> In Things, Substances, or Aggregats of Qualities, it may be called <HI>Similarity</HI> of <HI>Relations</HI> 194</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 5. <HI>Things, Substances,</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> are meant to be <HI>progressive,</HI> which are con∣stantly increasing or decreasing <HI>similarly</HI> 195</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. <HI>Space, Time, Motion,</HI> and <HI>Velocity,</HI> seem to be no <HI>Realities,</HI> or external Things, but mere <HI>Modifications,</HI> different <HI>Situa∣tions</HI> and <HI>Circumstances</HI> of Bodies or Mat∣ter; and are only our Manner of <HI>conceive∣ing</HI> or considering <HI>these.</HI> A <HI>particular Space,</HI> or the <HI>Locality</HI> of a particular Body, seems to be the <HI>Mathematical</HI> Term, or the Limits of the Three Dimensions of a Body, (as a Point is of a Line) or a Body in the Instant of its Evanishing or Generating. And <HI>universal Space</HI> is just such an <HI>Idea</HI> as infinit Number, or an infinitly <HI>great Body,</HI> or a mere <HI>Ens Rationis.</HI> And to shew that they are all but <HI>abstracted Ideas,</HI> and our partial Manner of conceiveing Things, from our limited Capacity; if we perform actually the <HI>Arithmetical</HI> Ope∣rations, as the Expression points them out, on proper infinit <HI>Series's,</HI> and throw away
<PB N="292" REF="384"/>
all the lesser Quantities, we shall come to all the <HI>Mysteries</HI> in <HI>Fluxions</HI> and <HI>Diffe∣rentials, Ratio's,</HI> and <HI>Series,</HI> commonly known, which are acknowledg'd to be only abstracted <HI>Ideas,</HI> and <HI>technical</HI> Arts, to sup∣ply the Defects of our Faculties, which are not intuitive, but progressive; they admit of Degrees, or a <HI>More</HI> and <HI>Less,</HI> only as be∣longing to and being connected with Body; viz. <HI>Space, Time, Motion,</HI> and <HI>Velocity,</HI> are Relations or Modifications only of Body or Matter 196</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 6. <HI>Relative Infinit,</HI> is such as is sup∣pos'd to increase or decrease <HI>perpetually,</HI> yet by no finite Power can be brought to, and no finite Capacity can assign or con∣ceive its <HI>limiting Terms,</HI> viz. the <HI>Greatest</HI> or the <HI>Least</HI> 197</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 7. <HI>Absolute Infinitude</HI> is the sole At∣tribute of the <HI>Deity,</HI> who is infinitly in∣finit in all <HI>Perfections</HI> and <HI>Realities</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 8. Things only are <HI>contradictory,</HI> which totally destroy one another, destroy their <HI>Subsistence, Substance,</HI> and <HI>Qualities</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. It is very doubtful, nay, I think, im∣possible, there can subsist a full Contradic∣tion among <HI>created</HI> Things, Substances, or Qualities, since they must all be <HI>Effluxes</HI> of the <HI>Deity,</HI> in whom there can subsist no Contradiction. For in created Things, to become totally <HI>contradictory,</HI> there must be an equal <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Reaction,</HI> to have pro∣duced
<PB N="293" REF="385"/>
it; but in all Creatures there seems to be a <HI>Subsistence</HI> and Reality, which cannot be totally destroy'd by one another, but by a Power and <HI>Energy</HI> equal to that by which they were created, and infinit <HI>Perfection</HI> cannot be contrary to itself. There may therefore be a <HI>Contrariety</HI> among created Substances and Qualities, but not a full <HI>Contradiction,</HI> or total Annihilation of their Subsistence, Substance, and all their Qualities. For even between <HI>material</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Substances, there will remain still, <HI>Substance, Subsistence,</HI> a <HI>Relation,</HI> an Alli∣ance, a Power of Expansion and Remission, both of their Substance and Qualities, which will make them <HI>alliable,</HI> and, as the <HI>Chymists</HI> speak, will make them capable of an Amalga∣ma, (like <HI>Quicksilver</HI> with <HI>Lead</HI>) tho' they will eternally act by Contrariety on one an∣other's Substances and Qualities, and ever counteract one another 200</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 9. <HI>Analogy,</HI> is a <HI>Similarity</HI> in Sub∣stances and essential Qualities, differing only by a <HI>More</HI> or a <HI>Less</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. <HI>Analogy</HI> is of two kinds, <HI>perfect</HI> and complete, and <HI>imperfect</HI> and incomplete ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>DEF. 10. <HI>Perfect Analogy</HI> is where there is a total <HI>Similarity</HI> of Substances, and essential Qualities, differing only in <HI>Degrees</HI> ibid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SCHOL. There are, I think, <HI>Substances,</HI> as well as Things and Qualities, of a <HI>middle Na∣ture,</HI> between the <HI>Extremes,</HI> in every
<PB N="294" REF="386"/>
created Reality; and this seems to be neces∣sary, from the Infinitude of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> as well as from the Nature of <HI>Fi∣nitude</HI> and Creature, which must be various and gradual. And as between any two given <HI>Terms,</HI> there are an Infinity of <HI>mean Proportionals</HI> assignable; and between an <HI>infinitly small,</HI> and an infinitly <HI>great part</HI> of the Diameter of an <HI>infinit Circle,</HI> there is the <HI>Perpendicular</HI> neither infinitly small nor great; so there must be material and spiritual Substances, of all Degrees of Sub∣limity, Purity, and Perfection, which, tho' similar, may differ in Degrees 201</ITEM>
<ITEM>COROL. Hence it may be possible, there may exist material Substances, continually ap∣proaching to the Nature and Qualities of spiritual Substances, which yet they can never arrive at, like the <HI>Asymptots</HI> of an <HI>Hyperbola</HI> 202</ITEM>
<ITEM>COROL. 2. Hence, there may possibly be material Fluids, so infinitly <HI>rare, spiritual,</HI> and <HI>elastic,</HI> that they may permit gross, porous, <HI>planetary</HI> Bodies, with only an infi∣nitly little Resistance, tho' that Resistance may be still <HI>somewhat,</HI> and but as the <HI>Sun</HI> diminishes only infinitly little continually, in the Emission of her Light; neither the <HI>spiritual Fluid,</HI> nor the <HI>Sun,</HI> can be de∣sign'd to last, in their present Condition, a Duration equal to <HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>Eternity</HI> 203</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="295" REF="387"/>DEF. 1. <HI>Complex Analogy</HI> is where there is only a <HI>Similarity</HI> between a certain Number of essential Qualities, common to the Things compared, which differ in De∣grees; but are diversified in other Qualities less <HI>essential</HI> ibid.</ITEM>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<ITEM><HI>All Creation, the whole System of the Uni∣verse, with all the particular Systems in Nature, are or can be nothing, but the supreme Being and his Attributes, tran∣substantiated into Being and Percepti∣bility; but the Cause will be always diffe∣rent from the Effect, the Artificer from the Work.</HI> This may be demon∣strated <HI>à priori,</HI> from the Nature and At∣tributes of the first Cause; but to illustrate it <HI>à posteriori,</HI> some Instances may be pro∣per 204</ITEM>
<ITEM>§. 1. In the <HI>vegetable</HI> World, to explain their Growth and Multiplication, the infi∣nitly rare elastic material Fluid mention'd, judiciously applied, will be sufficient, as also in the Vegetation and Growth of <HI>Minerals</HI> 205</ITEM>
<ITEM>§. 2. The totally <HI>inanimat</HI> Creation, espe∣cially our now <HI>secondary Elements</HI> of <HI>Air, Water, Light, Salts,</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> in the peculiar Fitness of the Size, Figure, Law of Attraction and Gravity, shew the infinit Wisdom of their Contriver; for had they
<PB N="296" REF="388"/>
not been figur'd, so as they are now in Na∣ture, to fit the <HI>Tubes</HI> of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and to combine them into their now integral Parts, they could not have been proper Materials for the Accretion of these <HI>Vegetables</HI>; and if they had not been so combin'd and <HI>moulded</HI> in the Vegetables, there had been no proper Food for <HI>Animals</HI> 206</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difference between <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Ani∣mals</HI> lies in this, that for the Actuation, Growth and Multiplication of the <HI>first,</HI> there neither is, nor is wanted any other Power or <HI>Energy</HI> than what an infinitly rare and <HI>elastic</HI> material Fluid produces on a divine∣ly <HI>organis'd</HI> material Machin; but in the <HI>latter,</HI> there is a <HI>self-motive</HI> and <HI>self-active</HI> spiritual Substance actuating and governing all their <HI>Functions,</HI> of some Order or De∣gree, even in the lowest <HI>Brute</HI> and <HI>Insect</HI> 208</ITEM>
<ITEM>§. 4. The <HI>human Powers,</HI> their Degree, Or∣der, and the Nature of their primitive aethe∣real <HI>Vehicle,</HI> with its now Plaistering, have been sufficiently explain'd 209</ITEM>
<ITEM>§. 5. The <HI>Angelic Hierarchies</HI> must be infinit in their Number, rising in a <HI>harmonious</HI> Pro∣gression and Variety, whose Seats may possi∣bly be the <HI>Fixt Stars,</HI> and their <HI>analogous planetary aethereal Systems</HI> and <HI>Apparatus</HI>; and these must be infinit in Number like∣wise, to preserve the <HI>Equilibrium</HI> in univer∣sal Space, and their original Distances from
<PB N="297" REF="389"/>
each other; they must have one <HI>generi∣cal</HI> Nature, which must be that of the <HI>ra∣dical Attributes of the Deity, Living, Understanding</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI>; their <HI>specific</HI> Differences may consist in <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> that some are more eminently lu∣minous, others more ardently <HI>loving</HI>; and this Difference seems to take Place even on this <HI>ruinous Planet,</HI> in the different Complexions and Talents of Mind in the different <HI>Orders</HI> of Men, which can only account for the odd Diversity in the Chil∣dren of the same Parents, under the same Education and Example 213</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Fixt Stars,</HI> which must be infinit in Number, seem to be the material <HI>Mansions</HI> of <HI>unlapsed,</HI> tried and purified angelical <HI>Hierarchies,</HI> and of restor'd, sentient and intelligent <HI>lapsed</HI> Creatures. <HI>God's Throne,</HI> his <HI>Shechina,</HI> is represented as above: <HI>Eli∣jah</HI> went upwards, and <HI>Christ</HI> ascended. Bodies of all Orders, or different Purity, must have an <HI>ubi,</HI> a local Situation, and a parmanent <HI>Mansion,</HI> at last: These <HI>Fixt Stars,</HI> and their <HI>planetary Apparatus,</HI> may be the Seats of the <HI>Unlapsed</HI> and <HI>Restor'd,</HI> and their <HI>aethereal Vehicles</HI> may be of the same Matter with their <HI>Mansions</HI>; and the Matter of these luminous and glo∣rious Seats, and the <HI>Vehicles</HI> made of them, may be <HI>eternis'd</HI> by <HI>harmonious Vibrations,</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="390"/>
and a perpetual <HI>Flux</HI> and <HI>Reflux</HI> of their Rays 216</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>GOD</HI> being the Creator of all sentient and intelligent Beings, the efficient Cause, and Object of perfect Felicity, it is a manifest Contradiction he should creat any such with∣out <HI>impressing</HI> in the very Essence of their Nature an ardent and insatiable <HI>Tendency</HI> and Ardor after <HI>Re-union</HI> with him; and accordingly the <HI>Desire of Happiness</HI> in all <HI>sentient</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings is invariable and unextinguishable, as we see, however they may mistake the <HI>End</HI> or Means, by being <HI>labile,</HI> and placeing it in spurious <HI>Selfishness,</HI> and inordinat Love of the Crea∣tures; and in the Distinction and Contrariety between this <HI>innate</HI> Byass and that <HI>adven∣titious</HI> one, does the Essence of Misery and <HI>Hell,</HI> in all future States, consist; but this last <HI>Byass</HI> being acquir'd only, and not <HI>in∣nate</HI> and <HI>essential,</HI> the <HI>Love, Merits</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> were con∣triv'd from all Eternity, to melt down and efface 219</ITEM>
<ITEM>Is it not highly probable that the <HI>System of Saturn,</HI> the <HI>Planets</HI> and their <HI>Satellits,</HI> may be the local <HI>Prisons</HI> and Dungeons, or Correction-houses, of the several Orders of lapsed <HI>probationary</HI> and <HI>progressive sentient and intelligent Beings?</HI> They differ vastly in their Accommodations; they seem to be
<PB N="299" REF="391"/>
under some <HI>penitential Disciplin</HI> from many obvious Imperfections and <HI>Oddities</HI> not easi∣ly otherwise accountable, or reconcileable to the Simplicity, Beauty, Harmony and re∣gular Order of all the Works of an infinit∣ly perfect and powerful Being; but, with infinit Propriety and Wisdom, seem fitted for the Design of Penitence, Correction, and initial Purity and Perfection 220</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Comets</HI> cannot possibly be the Seats of the <HI>Blessed</HI>; they are too many to supply only our <HI>Decrease</HI> of Water; their Alter∣nations of extreme Heat and Cold, Light and Darkness, are too <HI>violent</HI> for any ani∣mated Vehicle in a State of Happiness: They seem more probably to be the Habi∣tations of animated Beings under the Ex∣pectation of the <HI>last Sentence,</HI> or to be the Condemn'd Holds of <HI>GOD</HI>'s Kingdom 222</ITEM>
<ITEM>The next immediat <HI>Mansions</HI> to this, or the seve∣ral Stations and Mansions design'd for the re∣spective <HI>Purification</HI> of Soul and Body of lap∣sed, sentient and intelligent Beings, and all the several Steps, Stations or <HI>Mansions,</HI> in all Pro∣bability have a gradual Resemblance or <HI>Ana∣logy</HI> to one another and to this State here, and this <HI>Planet</HI> we now inhabit as the first or initial Term upwards or downwards re∣spectively; in those upwards all the Beauties, Comforts and pure Delights here increasing similarly in Degree, without their Defor∣mity,
<PB N="300" REF="392"/>
Miseries or Pains; in those downwards all the contrary: This Climax seems natural∣ly to flow from the Simplicity and Immuta∣bility of the Divine Nature by <HI>Analogy,</HI> and is conform to Revelation. All Bodies or <HI>Vehicles, planetary</HI> and <HI>aethereal,</HI> must have an <HI>ubi,</HI> and a fixt <HI>Mansion</HI> at least for a Time; and all sentient and intelligent Be∣ings must have a <HI>Polity, Order</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> be under a Government and Subordination; else it would not be a <HI>happy State,</HI> but <HI>consummat Misery. GOD</HI> is a <HI>God</HI> of Or∣der, and all his Works are performed with <HI>Order, Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure,</HI> and must have all a mutual <HI>Analogy,</HI> or as near a Resemblance to one another, as the Na∣ture of Things will admit 125</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Analogy</HI> does not (at least always directly and infallibly) <HI>demonstrat</HI> the real Existence and necessary Production of Things <HI>ad ex∣tra</HI>; but it strongly illustrats, explains, and makes them consistent with and consonant to the Things that we know already, see and feel to exist; it makes them different Links only of the same <HI>Chain,</HI> of Effects, and similar Terms of the same Progression, removes Difficulties, and makes Things ra∣tional and fit Objects for a rational <HI>supreme Cause</HI> to work by; and this is the solid Foun∣dation of all true <HI>Philosophy,</HI> which can only gather Causes and general Laws by Induction from repeated single <HI>Experiments,</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="393"/>
and is as high an Evidence as the Nature of <HI>Finitude</HI> and our Rank of Intelligence will admit in imperceptible Things; and when confirm'd by <HI>Revelation,</HI> rises to the Evi∣dence of a <HI>Demonstration</HI> in the strictest Sense 127</ITEM>
<ITEM>We may <HI>err</HI> and <HI>blunder</HI> in it, as we may in <HI>Algebra</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI>; but often our Er∣rors in the last come but from Want of Culture, Precipitation, or a wrong Head only; but in the <HI>Analogy</HI> that leads us to the Knowledge of the Divine Purity and Nature, and the Necessity of our own Pu∣rification and Perfection for <HI>invisible</HI> States, and the Nature of <HI>Spirits,</HI> our Blunders are often owing to a wrong <HI>Heart,</HI> Licentious∣ness, <HI>Selfishness,</HI> and Independency. If we went on in natural <HI>Analogy</HI> as we do in natural <HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Geometry,</HI> by the <HI>simplest, plainest</HI> and most obvious Cases, first collected by <HI>Induction,</HI> laid them up as a <HI>Store</HI> to proceed on to the higher Terms of the <HI>analogical Progression,</HI> and with At∣tention and Humility went on, from <HI>inani∣mated</HI> Matter, and its <HI>Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to <HI>Vegetation, Animation, Spiritual</HI> Being, up to the <HI>su∣preme Cause</HI>; perhaps great Proficience might be made in time by such a Method. <HI>Analogy</HI> is the only Mean of Knowledge, that can secure <HI>Liberty</HI> in <HI>lapsed Intelli∣gences.</HI> I will illustrate my Meaning by an <HI>Example</HI> in the <HI>System</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI> 229</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="302" REF="394"/>1. <HI>GOD</HI> bringing Creatures into Existence, must have made them after the most per∣fect <HI>Pattern,</HI> and therefore stampt them with his own Image, and so they must bear a Resemblance to him, and to one another, which is <HI>Analogy.</HI> 2. The Number of Qualities added to <HI>Existence,</HI> together with the Degrees of these Qualities, determin their <HI>Order.</HI> 3. The material World is a <HI>Transcript</HI> of the <HI>spiritual,</HI> and there is a more immediat Relation between each <HI>ma∣terial System,</HI> and the <HI>Intelligences</HI> to which it belongs; and should they lapse and fall into Disorder, their <HI>Mansion</HI> would make a <HI>similar</HI> Change. 4. There are many Evidences of this <HI>Analogy</HI> between the <HI>material</HI> and <HI>spiritual Systems:</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI> is placed in the <HI>Centre</HI> of our <HI>System,</HI> the material <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Deity</HI>; the <HI>Pla∣nets</HI> revolve about <HI>him,</HI> in different <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Periods,</HI> to represent the several <HI>Or∣ders</HI> of <HI>lapsed</HI> Intelligences; these <HI>Planets</HI> have no Light in themselves, it is all de∣riv'd by <HI>Reflection</HI> from <HI>him.</HI> 5. <HI>Heat, Light,</HI> and their Consequence <HI>Attraction,</HI> are his chief Properties, and by this <HI>At∣traction</HI> the <HI>Planets</HI> are kept in their <HI>Or∣bits,</HI> which strongly <HI>pictures</HI> out the <HI>Love of God,</HI> continually soliciting all Intelli∣gences to a nearer Approach to <HI>him.</HI> 6.

<P>§. 1. THERE seems to be something solid, in one Observation <HI>Leib∣nitz</HI> makes, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mark</HI> or <HI>Criterion,</HI> between the Works and Operations of <HI>Nature,</HI> or the <HI>GOD</HI> of Nature; and the Works of <HI>Art,</HI> or of <HI>finite</HI> Power and Wisdom, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>GOD,</HI> or Nature, works always by <HI>Organs infinit</HI> in Number, or in a perpetual convergent <HI>Progression</HI> of <HI>Organs</HI> or Means to∣wards some one or many wise <HI>Ends,</HI> or <HI>Art,</HI> by <HI>Organs finite</HI> in Number, or numerable (by <HI>Organs</HI>; <HI>Creature, Man</HI> is always meant a separable distinct Part of a <HI>Machin</HI>). For <HI>Ex∣ample</HI>;

we may be able to reckon the <HI>Wheels, Springs, Pullies, Chains, &amp;c.</HI> of any <HI>Watch</HI> or <HI>Clock,</HI> or any <HI>Machin,</HI> how complicated soever, made by <HI>Art:</HI> But who can reckon the <HI>Fibres, Tubes, Membranes, Valves, Inos∣culations, Ligatures,</HI> Degrees of <HI>Curvature,</HI> in the <HI>Tubes, &amp;c.</HI> of a <HI>Pile</HI> of Grass, or of a <HI>Feather</HI> of a Bird? The further we go by our Senses, assisted even by the most perfect <HI>Art,</HI> their <HI>Number</HI> multiplies on us; but then, if we could descend into the <HI>Figure, Number,</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Cohesion</HI> of their com∣ponent Particles, we should be intirely lost, and all our <HI>Art</HI> or Management would leave us in thick Darkness, and utter Confusion. In the Works of the <HI>GOD</HI> of Nature, there is no <HI>Maximum</HI> or <HI>Minimum</HI> assignable, or con∣ceiveable by us. Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has de∣monstrated the infinit <HI>Tenuity</HI> of the <HI>Par∣ticles</HI> of <HI>Light</HI>; and the progressive <HI>Analogy</HI> of Nature shews it is possible, that there may be Fluids as much more <HI>rare,</HI> and of as much lesser Particles, as those of Sand are bigger than those of <HI>Light. Leuvenhoeck</HI>'s Dis∣coveries of the Minuteness of some <HI>Animal∣culs,</HI> and of some <HI>Tubes</HI> of Animals, are scarce credible by any one who has not seen some of them, as I have. The ingenious Dr. <HI>Porterfeild</HI> has demonstrated the extreme Te∣nuity of even an <HI>organiz'd</HI> and compounded <HI>nervous Fibre</HI>; and there is no Reason from the Nature of <HI>Matter,</HI> from the Laws of
<PB N="307" REF="399"/>
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> or from the <HI>Divine</HI> Attri∣butes, to stop there; we may descend still lower, or higher in <HI>infinitum,</HI> and be war∣ranted by Reason and <HI>Geometry.</HI> One great Fault in natural <HI>Philosophers</HI> has been, that they have rejected every Account, as incre∣dible, imaginary, and fictitious, which sup∣pos'd <HI>Fluids</HI> extremely or infinitly <HI>rare, rapid,</HI> and <HI>elastic,</HI> as is that of <HI>Huygens</HI>'s, <HI>Leib∣nitz,</HI> and Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s; and yet some such there must infallibly exist in Nature, as the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> shew: For if the natural Motions on our Earth, in Bodies, are perform'd by <HI>Air, Water,</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> since we know sen∣sibly, these are Fluids of a finite and pretty near determinable Size, Figure, and Degree of Gra∣vity in their <HI>Particles,</HI> the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Nature will make it as evident, that the other less known, secret, subtile, and unaccountable Ap∣pearances may be perform'd by some other properly condition'd Fluid, (I mean only in the Appearances of the <HI>material World</HI>) I say, as certainly, as if the first Terms of a <HI>Series x</HI> + <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP> + <HI>x</HI><SUP>3</SUP> + <HI>x</HI><SUP>4</SUP>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were given, I should cer∣tainly conclude the 10th, 11th and 12th Terms of such a <HI>Series</HI> were <HI>x</HI><SUP>10</SUP> + <HI>x</HI><SUP>11</SUP> + <HI>x</HI><SUP>12</SUP>.</P>

The <HI>Fluids</HI> are only design'd to keep them in a proper Degree of <HI>Moisture</HI> and <HI>Glib∣ness,</HI> to continue their necessary <HI>Tone,</HI> and due Degree of <HI>Elasticity.</HI> All the pleasant, easy, and healthful Sensations of <HI>Life,</HI> depend chiefly on these Fluids. Little can be effected by <HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Medicin,</HI> on the Solids, and their <HI>linear Fibres:</HI> A temporary Constriction only, a transient <HI>winding up,</HI> a Fit of tolerable Health, and Flow of Spirits, may be gain'd by <HI>astringent</HI> cordial Medicins; but it is <HI>Regimen</HI> alone, by rendering the <HI>Fluids</HI> sweet, soft, cool and <HI>balsamic,</HI> that enable the <HI>Solids</HI> to <HI>play,</HI> according to their <HI>innate</HI> Powers, that can give dureable and uniform good Health, and keep these <HI>Solids</HI> as they were at first form'd, in a proper <HI>Tone, Glibness,</HI> and <HI>Ela∣sticity.</HI></P>

Again, how necessary, how indis∣pensable, would seem the <HI>precise,</HI> the limited, the unmistakeable Nature of natural and mo∣ral <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> to us, in our present pro∣batory State? and yet we are left for the Knowledge of <HI>them,</HI> to <HI>Feeling,</HI> to <HI>Observa∣tion,</HI> to <HI>Experience,</HI> to <HI>Culture,</HI> to <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Suffering.</HI> The <HI>wisest</HI> of mere Men said, <HI>That no Man knoweth Good or Evil by all that is before him:</HI> We naturally reckon <HI>Health, Wealth, Honour</HI> and <HI>Success,</HI> the real, the only Goods of this Life; and yet, if <HI>Christianity</HI> is not all a <HI>Farce,</HI> their Con∣traries are often, nay almost, always the most real, and the most perfect Goods, since they are

in cleansing our Vessels, and <HI>trimming our Lamps</HI>; and yet all that is known in this weighty Affair is <HI>general,</HI> and that we once must all die: The <HI>Time,</HI> the <HI>Manner,</HI> and other Circumstances, are all absolutely un∣known to us; and why this? but only because infinit Purity and Perfection values nothing about us, but absolute <HI>Trust, Dependence,</HI> and <HI>Resignation,</HI> even to venturing our very <HI>Lives</HI>; and, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> expresses it, if we do not <HI>hate,</HI> that is, undervalue, our own Life, in respect of <HI>him,</HI> or love it but in <HI>Subordi∣nation</HI> to our Love of Him, we cannot be his <HI>Disciples.</HI> Again; the <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> seems to act <HI>here</HI> solely by <HI>second Causes,</HI> and by <HI>general Laws</HI> only, and in such a manner, that we but seldom <HI>perceptibly</HI> discern the Hand that disposes of <HI>Events</HI>; tho' doubtless, as <HI>GOD</HI> is an <HI>infinitly free Agent,</HI> He go∣verns by a particular, as well as a general Providence; on proper and particular Occa∣sions He dispenses with his own general Laws for a time, by a particular Interposition, both in <HI>material</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Appearances: But in these particular <HI>Interpositions,</HI> we can have no <HI>physical,</HI> but only a <HI>moral</HI> Certainty, in order to raise and confirm our <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI>; for <HI>Faith, Trust,</HI> and <HI>Resignation,</HI> always suppose Uncertainty and Doubt; and some time or other, we shall admire and adore that <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> who could in so delicat and kindly a <HI>manner</HI> conceal from us, and hide that Hand, which directs every <HI>Atom</HI>
