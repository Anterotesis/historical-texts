<HEAD>THE
CONDUCT
Of some People, about
Pleading Guilty.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI>
first exhibited Impeachments
against the Seven Lords taken
at the Defeat of the Rebels at <HI>Preston,</HI>
and sent the Articles against them up to
the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> the Lords, according
to the usual Course of Proceedings in
such Cases, appointed the Impeach'd
Lords to attend, and allow'd them Time
to give in their Answer.</P>
<P>While this Part was depending, it was
the common Discourse of the Town,
That giving them Time was but a piece
of needless Formality, a kind of Banter
upon their Circumstances, a Thing of no
signification, that indeed it gain'd them a
few Days to Live, and to prepare for
another World, which was the only
Thing they ought to have in their View,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
but that it was of no other effect, <HI>For
what can they Plead?</HI> said the People,
who spoke of those Things with any
Judgment, <HI>Were not they taken in Arms?
Were they not in open Rebelion, and made
Prisoners in the Action, Surrendered at
Discretion to our Generalls, and brought
immediately bither from the very Place of
Battle? Can such Men bring any Plea?
What can they have to say?</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this was the Discourse without
Doors, yet with the Persons themselves
there was other Thoughts; and particu∣larly
with their Friends; and the De∣bates
that happened upon this Subject, as
well among themselves as among other
People, may be very Useful for us to
know something of, as well to let us in∣to
the <HI>Secret History</HI> of their <HI>Conduct,</HI> as
to inform us who were in their Interest,
and upon what Foot their Friends En∣deavour'd
to Save them.</P>
<P>I believe no Man will suppose, that
Gentlemen of such Quallity as these,
were without some Friends, who, in
their present Extremity, would Interest
themselves for them, and who Apply'd,
with the uttermost Diligence, to gain to
them the Favour of such other Persons,
as might be supposed, on any Account
whatever, to be capable of Serving them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
It was easie to see who would Befriend
them of Course; (<HI>viz.</HI>) Those engaged
by Party, who were on their Side by In∣clination,
these were not only to be de∣pended
upon for their Votes in favour
of the Gentlemen in Distress, but to be
moved to use their Interest for the bring∣ing
others, of a Second Party, who were
something Indifferent, over to the same
Sentiment. There was a Third Party,
from whom nothing was Expected, and
therefore to such little Application was
to be made, but they were, if possible, to
be Out-Number'd.</P>
<P>The space the Criminal Gentlemen
had between their Commitment to the
<HI>Tower,</HI> and the Day of their Impeach∣ment,
was the Time to be employ'd to
form those Interests, and to come to an
Understanding about the Strength of
their Friends; and as there were no Mo∣ments
to be lost, so neither was it ill
Employ'd; they took care to Sollicit,
Treat with, and Engage every Man, that
by any possible Methods they could come
at, to act in their Interest, in so Critical
a Juncture, and to do their Best for them,
if possible to avert the Stroke of Justice
at last; and for this no Body can blame
them. It was not many Days before the
Impeachments, that we were told, with
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
great Assurance, That the Lords in the
<HI>Tower</HI> had made such an Interest, that
they were under no apprehensions of
Dying at all, and that it only remain'd,
to Determine what Method should be
taken, to make the Mercy they were to
receive appear Rational in those that
Granted it, and be Satisfactory to the
Nation.</P>
<P>And if it is True, that they had, upon
those Applications, some private Assu∣rance
given them, That by the strength
of their Interest among the Nobility, the
whole House of Lords would be brought
to Address His Majesty to shew them
Mercy, who can blame them for promi∣sing
themselves their Lives, especially
considering the native Clemency of His
Majesty, and the Inclination all good
Kings have to spare the Blood of their
People.</P>
<P>But in all these Measures, there has
been so much Intriegue, such Nicety of
Management, such Subtilty of Applica∣tion,
and such Industry used on one
Hand, and such Court Fineness, such
discovery of Persons and Principles on
the other, that it must be very Diver∣ting,
as well as Improving, to give some
Account of it to the World.</P>
<P>The Measures, as I have said, having
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
been taken to form their Interest, and
those Measures having succeeded, even
beyond their Expectation, the first thing
to be observ'd is, How agreeable to all
good Men, and especially to Men of Ho∣nour
and Quality, it is to be apply'd to
for shewing Mercy to Men in Distress,
in a Court so Gallant, so Soft, so Hu∣mane,
I had almost said so Christian, as
that of this Kingdom, what wonder is it,
that an humble Application, by Persons
of Honour under Misfortunes, found
powerful Advocates, and made sensible
Impressions upon the Minds of some
Great Persons in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Clemency and Charity are the Glory,
the one of Nobility, the other of Chri∣stianity,
and when these are the power∣ful
Arguments to be used, when these are
the Keys, how easy is it to Unlock the
Breasts of such Persons who are fill'd
with Principles of Honour and Christia∣nity?
I had much rather give these for
the Reasons, why the Applications of the
Distressed Lords gain'd them so easie, and
so general an access to the Hearts of
some, whose Posts and Trusts, perhaps,
might seem to have Engaged them ano∣ther
way; and of whom it might have
been expected, that their Concern for
the Safety and Peace of their Royal
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Master, the Honour of His Government,
and the Good of their Country, should
have open'd their Eyes to the necessity
of Publick Justice at that Time, than
have it to say of any, That it rather
opened their Ears to the Petitions of
those who had put their Hands to the
horrid Work, of their Country's De∣struction,
and made them Intercessors
for those who had rais'd a Civil War in
its Bowells, striking at the Person and
Family of our Sovereign, the Founda∣tion
of the Protestant Interest, and at
the very Root of the Constitution.</P>
<P>I am very loth also to entertain an
Opinion so gross in it self, and so remote
from Charity, which nevertheless some
have started, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was listen∣ing
to a frailer part of their Inclination,
which brought some Gentlemen into
this Matter: That all the Clemency of
their Tempers, and Softness of their Dis∣positions,
would not have prevail'd over
their Sense of Duty, if there had not
been more glittering Motives, whose
Power they had not self-denying Vertue
enough to resist; Tho' if this was their
Temptation, I must still acquit the Ag∣gressors,
I mean the Lords in the <HI>Tower</HI>;
for who, in their Circumstances, would
have spar'd their Ammunition where
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
knew the Fort would be reduc'd by Un∣dermining,
without the hazard of Stor∣ming.</P>
<P>And
as on the one Hand I believe, at
least hope, this is no more than a Slan∣der
upon the Gentlemen, of whom it is
spoken, so, I dare say, the Reasons some
People have to suggest such a thing, e∣ven
to themselves, are rather taken from
what they have formerly heard, of the
influence MONEY has had upon those
Persons in Times past, to lead them a∣gainst
Principle, than from any real In∣telligence
they have now had of the
Fact.</P>
<P>It may be True, that the Suspicion is
encreased by the Knowledge the World
has had of the contrary Disposition of
the Persons spoken of in Days of old,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) How, in former Times, when the ad∣ministration
of Publick Affairs has been
in some of their Hands, they have been
found as Deaf to the Importunities of
the Miserable, as Inexorable to suppli∣cating
Vertue, and distress'd Innocence,
as any <HI>Asian</HI> Mute, commission'd to the
excercise of the Bow-String: How they
have been Eminent for vindictive Tem∣pers,
and the Operations of the Spleen,
as any that have since acted their Parts;
and therefore it has been said, That it
must be from some other Principle than
that of Humanity and Compassion, that
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
those Persons, however Great, should be
prevail'd with to plead for Clemency
and Mercy to Men under the worst of
Circumstances, and Sentenc'd for Crimes
which must necessarily, not only taint
their Honour and Families who are
Guilty, but must cast some just Re∣proach
upon those who Interest them∣selves
to Save them. But as those are
but Suggestions, I say no more of them.</P>
<P>But to return to the Fact, as it stands
Historically in our view: Certain it is,
<HI>if Fame lye not,</HI> That the powerful Ap∣plications
for Mercy for these Men,
whether by the influence of the Ladies
Tears, the sense of the Misfortunes of
so many Persons of Quality, or any
meaner Importunities, <HI>I cannot say,</HI> had
found Means to make Impressions upon
some nearer the Throne than they them∣selves
had, I believe, any hopes of; and
as this was an agreeable Surpise to the
Unfortunate Gentlemen, so we shall see
the less Reason to wonder at their fu∣ture
Conduct on that Account, and this
is partly the Reason why I have entered
into this Part at the Beginning of this
Tract.</P>
<P>Nothing is more Certain, than that
before this the Lords seeing little room
to expect any Interest could be made for
their Escape, had entertain'd serious
Thoughts of Dying, and were rather
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
something Disconcerted, than otherwise
Determined, as to what Answer they
should give to the Impeachments which
were brought against them.</P>
<P>Indeed, as some of them Express'd it,
<HI>I mean one already Executed,</HI> they hard∣ly
expected the House of Commons
would have given themselves the trou∣ble
of Impeachments, in a Case which
was so plain, and requir'd so little Cere∣mony,
but rather have let the Law take
its ordinary Course, by Indictment and
Plea, and have left them to the House
of Peers, who must necessarily have Con∣demn'd
them.</P>
<P>It has been said also, by some of their
Party, That the same Gentlemen had
resolv'd to act what they call <HI>the Heroe,</HI>
(<HI>viz.</HI>) To have given the Fact in Evi∣dence
at their Tryal, and justify'd the
Rebellion upon Principles of <HI>Jacobitism</HI>;
the Foundations of which, <HI>like Blasphe∣mous
Tenets in Religious Disputes,</HI> are
not fit to be Mentioned. That this had
been to have acted the Desperadoe, and
to have cast themselves entirely away
beyond the reach of Mercy, and out of
the Power of Intercessors; nay, even
out of the Rational Power of the Royal
Clemency itself, is most certain; how
it could Denominate them <HI>Heroes</HI> would
have been their business to shew, I must
acknowledge I do not see any thing of
that kind in it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
However, we found this Notion was
so revitted in the Mind of one Person, if
of no other of them, that nothing could,
for some time, divert his Thoughts from
it; and we have divers Accounts of his
Conduct in that Part. How he talk'd of
Death, <HI>a la Cavalier</HI>: How he made the
Scaffold appear to his Fancy, no more
than a Scene in a Tragedy, which had
nothing in it but a Formality, to make
his passing off from the World a little
Judicial. How he thought that Death
there, could have no worse a Face than
it had in the Streets of <HI>Preston,</HI> where he
had look'd on its Phyz with very little
Apprehension, and was not at all afraid
to see it again.</P>
<P>As these were the Views which for
some time these Gentlemen had, so nei∣ther
were they easy to be brought to en∣tertain
other Notions; Indeed when the
Time was Limited, that they were Obli∣ged
to give in some Plea or other, and
that they began to look on the Thing
with a nearer, and, perhaps, a more seri∣ous
View, they appear'd not all alike
Determind'd; but all the Consequence of
this was, That it only made them a little
more encliin'd to listen to the Advice of
their Council and Friends, and to Act
by such Measures as Reason, and the
Nature of their Circumstances call'd for.</P>
<P>This ended in their Pleading Guilty
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
to the Impeachment, and throwing them∣selves,
in the most Moving and Submi∣sive
Manner possible, upon the King's
Mercy, imploring the Intercession of their
Peers, who were their Judges, and of the
Commons, who were their Accusers, a
thing which, as is said, One of those
now gone said, <HI>Was much more difficult</HI> to
do, <HI>than</HI> TO DIE.</P>
<P>I have heard many wise and good Men
say, That let the Ends, which the said
Gentlemen proposed to themselves in it,
be what they would, that Plea was the
only Step they could have taken, entire∣ly
to give Peace to their own Minds, and
have good Men believe they were resto∣red
to an honest and just Principle; <HI>The
First,</HI> because by it they had tryed the
only Step left them to save their Lives,
and which they could not possible be ful∣ly
satisfy'd in omitting; and <HI>the Last,</HI>
because the Contrary had been a justify∣ing
and defending the Crime of Rebellion,
which on no just Principle could be de∣fended;
and, as I am well Informed,
these Arguments were pressed upon them
with great Earnestness by their Friends,
so I have been told also, That the first,
especially, made a great impression upon
them, in the Case I speak of.</P>
<P>But there was a yet more powerful
Argument to induce them to this Plea,
and this is said to be represented to them
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
by the Agents they had employ'd as be∣fore,
to obtain the Intercession and Fa∣vour
of the Great Persons, of which I
mentioned something at first; and this
contains the best Piece of Secret History,
which, perhaps, has come to light in all
this Affair.</P>
<P>Suppose <HI>A. B.</HI> to be a Lady deeply in∣terested
in the Case before us, and ap∣plying
to one <HI>N. O.</HI> for his Interest and
Favour in Behalf of the Condemn'd
Lords, while other Friends are solliciting
as hard with other Great Persons; let us
digest their Discourse as near as we can
to the real Dialogue that past between
them, allowing that we can relate no
more than Memory and our faithful In∣telligence
could convey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note.</HI> Suppose the Balm infused by other means to soften <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>oding Passions, and prevent Fermentation of natural morese Humour.</NOTE> <HI>A. B.</HI> A distress'd Lady, introduc'd by
a Favourite, throws
her self at the Feet
of <HI>N. O.</HI> with abun∣dance
of Tears, and
in a short Address,
bespeaks him thus:</P>
<P>My Lord, (said she) I come to implore
your Pity to a Number of Distress'd, but
Noble Persons, and particularly to my
Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>: they are well assur'd of the
powerful Influences your Lordship has as
well in the Councils of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> as in the
P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, and without your Lordship's
Assistance they are inevitably lost.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
N. O. <HI>Madam, I am very sorry it is
so little in my Power to help your Lord
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; but I have been already spoken to,
I suppose at your Ladyship's Request, by
my Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, and I bid him assure you, that
if my Lord</HI> D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>will be advised, I
shall do all for him that lies in my Power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. B.</HI> My Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, As these di∣stress'd
Prisoners have no Friend so able
to advise them as your Lordship, so you
may be assured they will put their Lives
and Honour into your Lordship's Hand,
and be guided entirely by your Advice.</P>
<P>N. O. <HI>Why, Madam, I am told they
make a Difficulty of Pleading Guilty to the
Impeachments; I do not see how it is
possible any one can serve them, if they de∣cline
Pleading Guilty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. B.</HI> My Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, I cannot an∣swer
that Particular farther than this;
It is, no doubt, hard to them to plead
Guilty, especially to all the Enlargements
and Aggravations in the Impeachments,
tho' they are otherwise in no Condition
to repell the Evidence.</P>
<P>N. O. <HI>But they may plead Guilty in
General Terms; they acknowledge they
were in Arms, marched so and so, and were
taken in Fight, as the Impeachment ex∣presses
it; this they cannot deny; and
Pleading Guilty then is no more than Con∣fessing
what it is to no Purpose to deny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. B.</HI> But, my Lord, Pleading Guilty,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
is owning, That taking Arms for King
<HI>James</HI> is Rebellion.</P>
<P>N. O. <HI>Look you, Madam, I am as
much for King</HI> Ja<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>as my present Cir∣cumstances
will allow; but in this Case it
is impossible to help them without it. But,
Madam, my Lord Duke ofLook you, Madam, I am as
much for King Ja <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> has ap∣pointed
to meet me this Evening about
this Affair: Your Ladyship may depend
upon it, that we will consider of the best
Method to serve my Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, and we
hope he will not scruple any thing that we
shall convince his Lordship is for his In∣terest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.
B.</HI> I humbly thank your Lordship;
I know my Lord depends entirely upon
your Assistance, and is wholly given up
to your Measures.</P>
<P>My Lady returns to the Tower, and
finds there another Person, who we shall
know by the Letters <HI>L. R.</HI> who had
found Means to visit the Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> in
his Imprisonment.</P>
<P>This Person, it seems, had likewise
been with some Great Lords on the same
Errand that my Lady had been with
<HI>N. O.</HI> and having, as we are inform'd, re∣ceiv'd
much the same Answer, was Ex∣postulating
with my Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> about
Pleading Guilty, which the other strenu∣ously
opposed.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> (says L. R.) <HI>how is it possible
any Peer can serve you, if you have not</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/> <HI>first acknowledg'd the Fact? Pardon cra∣ved
implies Guilt confess'd: No Man can
ask Mercy for you, while you stand upon
your Justification.</HI> My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> seem'd
a little moved at that Proposal,
and with some Warmth replyed, <HI>But,</HI>
my Lord, <HI>do you consider the very</HI> Plea
<HI>is a Renouncing my Sovereign: How can
a Man of Honour stoop to that? Nay,
how can any Man of Honour offer such a
Thing to us?</HI> (says <HI>L. R.</HI>) <HI>My Lord, your
Lordship knows that</HI> N. O. <HI>was always a
sincere Friend to the Chevalier; he bid me
assure you that he is still so in his Heart:
You know he gave innumerable Evidences
of it formerly, in the Time of his Admini∣stration;
and if he has seemingly appear'd
in another Interest now for some Time, you
know well the Motives inducing, and also
that it is with due Reserves, and that he
waits only an Occasion to declare himself;
and you must be content, if you will save
your Life, my Lord, now you are in their
Power, to do as my Lord</HI> N. O. <HI>does,</HI> viz.
<HI>Double and turn, and shew the smooth
Face, or the rough, as Occasion offers, and
I confess I do not see why you should make
it a Difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> as if he was sur∣priz'd,
return'd: <HI>No Difficulty, my Lord!
Do you consider that it is Perjury in the
Abstract; and tho' I am a Catholick, I
have no Dispensation for breaking lawful</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>Oaths; I ought to die, rather than enter∣tain
a Thought of it.</HI> To this, <HI>L. R.</HI> re∣turn'd
coldly, <HI>I am sorry for it, my Lord;
it is certain, if you cannot do this Part,
you must dye, there is no Man living can
interpose for you.</HI></P>
<P>It seems, however, that Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> was
not willing either to leave the Point,
or to leave off the Discourse, and there∣fore
still held him in Suspence; <HI>My
Lord,</HI> (says he) <HI>you may be sure I am wil∣ling
to save my Life, but can I be guilty of
Perjury? How can</HI> N. O. <HI>offer such a
Thing to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> told him, He could not say <HI>how
far</HI> these Things might deserve the Name
of Perjury, and brought in this famous
Argument; <HI>Do not we that are Protest∣ants,</HI>
says he, <HI>as firmly adhere to the In∣terest
of King</HI> J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>as any of you, and
yet you see we are oblig'd to take all the
Oaths, Abjurations, Associations,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that
they put upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> told him gravely, He
could not enter into that Case: <HI>I examine
no Man's Principles,</HI> said he, <HI>but my own
I have always acted upon an honourable
Foot hitherto; and I think a Man of Ho∣nour
can no more renounce his King than
his God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> seem'd at a full Stop at this, as
indeed any Protestant might well be,
and as if the Case was at a Point, reply'd,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
That he could not enter into a Dispute
about Opinions, and Principles: <HI>But,</HI>
says he, <HI>if this cannot be, then I beg your
Lordship will tell me if I can serve you any
other way.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> not willing still to
to quit the Discourse, replied with this
Question: <HI>Why may not the Lords in∣terpose
for Mercy to us after a Tryal, if
we are found Guilty?</HI></P>
<P>This discovered his full Design: But
<HI>L. R.</HI> open'd the Case more fully to his
Satisfaction, as follows: Says he, <HI>All that
are your Friends now, will, no doubt, do
so, my Lord, but the Business lies another
Way: It must not be a few Friends, but a
Majority of the House that can do you any
Service; and do you not think there will
be a manifest Difference in the Inclination
of the Peers to you, from the Influence of
your Conduct, and as you behave well or
ill?</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> seem'd not to understand
him, and desir'd him to explain himself.</P>
<P>Why, suppose, (<HI>says</HI> L. R.) on one Hand
you plead <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> justify your selves
from your Loyalty, <HI>as you call it,</HI> to the
Chevalier, which, by Consequence, must be
in the highest manner provoking to the
present Government, as it insists upon the
Title of their Enemy, and pretends to dis∣own
the Settlement here: Do you think,
my Lord, <HI>said he,</HI> as many will incline to
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Compassion, and as many will think you
merit to be spar'd, as will be mov'd on the
other Hand to a generous Clemency, when
they see so many unhappy Noblemen throw∣ing
themselves entirely at their Feet, and
Imploring their Intercession for unfortunate
Men, who cry for Mercy. Pray consider
this Case sedately, my Lord.</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed (says my Lord) there
may be some Difference in that.</P>
<P><HI>A great deal, my Lord,</HI> (continued <HI>L.
R.</HI>) <HI>and there are a great many Reasons
for it: We are to work upon Humane Na∣ture
in this Case, not upon Party Princi∣ples:
If the House were to go by Party,
you are lost: You must not think that all
those who may be brought to pity you, are
of your Side; if they were, it were no
matter how you pleaded: But we are to
move the Compassions of Men to your Per∣sons,
who are Enemies to your Cause; and</HI>
with such <HI>differing Measures must be ta∣ken:
In a Word, my Lord, I must own, it
is my Opinion that no other way can save
you, act as you think fit.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> as if he seem'd to
yield, and that he was convinc'd by these
Reasonings, return'd thus: <HI>Well, and if I
do plead Guilty, what will he do for me?
And what must I do else?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Why, my Lord,</HI> (said <HI>L. R.</HI>) <HI>if you plead
Guilty, you first cast your self upon the
Mercy of the King, then you must make a</HI><PB N="21" REF="20"/><HI>short handsome Application to the Peers to
intercede with his Majesty for his Pardon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And must I call him King and Majesty?</HI>
(says L. <HI>D.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>It must be so, my Lord,</HI> (says <HI>L. R.</HI>)
<HI>there can be no putting in a Word for you,
unless you think fit to come this length;
and your Lordship knows it to be so as
well as I; the Nature of the Thing re∣quires
it.</HI> To which Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>seem∣ing
moved again, return'd smartly: <HI>And
will not your Lordship say your self that I
deserve more to dye than a Common Thief,
If I can stoop to such mean Things to save
my Life.</HI></P>
<P>Says L. <HI>R. I see, my Lord, the Nicety
of Honour will be your Destruction; I am
sorry for your own Part, and yet more sor∣ry
for the Injury such an Obstinacy will be
to the rest of the Noble Lords who are
your Fellow-Prisoners, who, I fear, will
fare the worse for it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You stab me with that Expression</HI>; re∣ply'd
my Lord <HI>D. rather than they shall
suffer by me, I'll comply with any Thing,
tho' I would not for any Danger of my
own.</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> told him, He knew that Thought
would touch his tender Part; that it
was indeed a Reflection which any Per∣son
of Honour would immediately make;
that it was hard to let our Opiniatre en∣danger
the Lives, Honours, and Estates
of our Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
To this, Lord <HI>D.</HI> as if yielding, said
little, but enquired into the farther Cir∣cumstances
of the Proposal. <HI>And,</HI> says
he, <HI>if we do agree to prevaricate, and,
merely to save our Lives, take this disho∣nourable
Step, for such we must esteem it,
as we shall speak against the Testimony of
our own Hearts when we do it, I say,
when we do thus, what then?</HI></P>
<P>Says <HI>L. R. Then, my Lord, the Persons
we have been with,</HI> viz. N. O. B. <HI>and</HI> N.
<HI>and several other Persons of Honour, of
the first Magnitude, have promised to bestir
themselves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what is it they can do?</HI> says L. <HI>D.</HI>
still unsatisfy'd.</P>
<P><HI>Rather, my Lord,</HI> says the other, <HI>what
is it they cannot do?</HI></P>
<P><HI>But may we not have some View of
their Measures?</HI> says L. <HI>D.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yes, yes, my Lord</HI>; (says L. <HI>R.</HI>) <HI>you
know they have a Right to advise the
King; and if they espouse your Interest,
you will find, perhaps, they may be brought
to address the King in Parliament to par∣don
you, which if you can obtain, your Bu∣siness
is over, for you hardly ever found
an Example where any Person who the
Parliament address'd to have spared, was
Executed, altho the Crime might be equal,
if not superior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> says L. <HI>D. the Design seems
well laid; an Address will certainly do our</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
<HI>Business: But must we not apply to the
House of Commons too?</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> return'd; <HI>You may do so, if you
please; but we cannot answer for them in
this Case; for tho' the House of Commons
do often make, or pass Acts of Oblivion,
yet in Cases thus particular, we do not find
often that the House relents. The Com∣mons
are the Accusers, and are justly in∣cens'd
at the Rebellion; and they cannot
so reasonably concern themselves to inter∣pose
between the King and those that have
offended; but if the Lords do it, we doubt
not but it will be sufficient in this Case,
and we hope the Commons may be brought
not to oppose it, if they cannot be brought
to address in your Favour.</HI></P>
<P>Says L. <HI>D. Well then, we must for once
stoop to be</HI> Ro<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s<HI>, and deny our Prince
and our Principle to save our Lives; but
my Heart mis-gives, and tells me, That</HI> It
will never do; <HI>Heaven cannot approve
it, and will not bless it; and take it from
me, when we have done so, it will not
thrive, and it will be the only Sin of my
Life I shall have to make Confession of upon
the Scaffold, for thither I shall come, and
its better to come there gallantly, and with
the clear Soul of a Man of Honour, than
basely loaded with Guilt and Confusion,
and bearing Testimony against our selves,
that we have acted dishonourably to save
our Lives, and not saved them neither.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
He spoke this with great Earnestness,
and almost with Tears standing in his
Eyes, and his Friend could not but per∣ceive
it, which made him very passionate∣ly
embrace him, telling him, He saw
with what Reluctance he did it, and if
it had been in his Power to have serv'd
him any other Way, he would rather
have died than have proposed it to him.</P>
<P>By such Arguments as these, and by
the Sollicitations of those Friends who
stirr'd for them, who thought it neces∣sary
for their Safety, the Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> is
said, to be prevail'd upon to go into those
Measures which he publickly Repented
of, when he found them ineffectual.</P>
<P>How far both they, and their Friends
also, were mistaken in their Measures,
we shall take Notice of by and by.</P>
<P>It is necessary to Observe here, That
after these Things were over, and the
Prisoners had Pleaded Guilty, spoken
very handsomely, and Submitted in the
lowest Manner to the Peers, begging their
Lordships to Interpose with His Majesty
for Mercy to them, as by their Speeches,
which are made publick, and to which I
refer, may be seen; I say after this was
over, then the Moments seem'd to be
come, in which the Promises of <HI>N. O.</HI>
and other their Friends, were, if ever, to
be performed.</P>
<P>The Ladies, with all the most Moving
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
and Passionate Representations, acted their
Part to perfection: None can say, They did
not do their Duty to the utmost; the Pow∣erful
Interest they made among all the Men
of Influence, shew'd they were not wanting:
All that Prayers and Tears could do, was
done without Doors; at length the Petition
was brought into the House of Lords, and
being Receiv'd, it introduced a Debate.</P>
<P>I am not allow'd to take notice of any
Thing that was Transacted within the
House, other than by Generals, to wit,
That their Friends did all that could be ex∣pected
of them, and that it was possible to
do; and so far has Clemency, and a Merci∣ful
Disposition, the ascendant over the No∣ble
Persons who compose that Illustrious Bo∣dy,
that those Lords who spoke in Favour of
the Condemn'd Lords, had great Advan∣tages,
few caring to interpose, to put a stop
to the Royal Goodness, or obstruct the
Channel of Mercy to the Miserable.</P>
<P>This, we may suppose, favour'd their
Petition; and the Lords agreed to address
his Majesty for Mercy, with such a Reserve
to his Majesty's Pleasure and their Conduct,
as might tell them however, that there
was yet something farther to be look'd for
from them, if they expected Mercy: How
this was express'd, is to be seen in the Ad∣dress,
to which we refer.</P>
<P>The Condemn'd Lords, it was said, did
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
not receive the News of this Address with
that Pleasure that their Friends, who saw
not so far into it as some of them did, expe∣cted;
which, perhaps, was the Reason why
one said of them too warmly, That they
were not grateful to their Friends.</P>
<P>Nor did they receive it all alike, some
who penetrated into Things farther than
others, seeing, perhaps, Room for their De∣liverance
in it, and others just the contrary;
so that while this Address put some of
them in Hopes that they might <HI>Deserve</HI>
Mercy, and consequently have room to ex∣pect
it, others of them saw room only to
despair this <HI>Deserving Mercy,</HI> being a Term
which they had different Notions of from
other Men.</P>
<P>It began now to appear to them, that they
were deceived, when they thought that
<HI>The Bitterness of Death was past</HI>; That the
Peers, tho' they were prevail'd with to har∣bour
some merciful Dispositions towards
them, were very far from offering to im∣pose
upon the Government, or to press for
Mercy, but on such express Terms as his
Majesty should find to be for the Honour
of his Government, and the Safety of his
Kingdom: So that it remain'd for these
Gentlemen to convince his Majesty, that
they were proper Objects of Mercy, before
they could comfort themselves much from
what was past.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
This Part leads us to the Second Part of
our Work, <HI>viz.</HI> To mention something of
<HI>the Reasons,</HI> so far as we have got Insight
into that Matter Without-Doors, <HI>Why the
King, tho' mercifully inclin'd, and hear∣tily
sorry for the Necessity which his Majesty
finds himself under to give the publick Ju∣stice
so much Vent, yet could not see it reaso∣nable
to extend that Mercy which was so
earnestly sollicited for to that particular
Person, of whom these Papers may seem to
speak.</HI></P>
<P>The Speech, or Paper, left behind by the
Lord <HI>Der<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r,</HI> tho' it does not speak it
in Words, yet intimates very plainly, That
there has been a long Train of Treasons;
a secret Management of Parties and Per∣sons
in the Preparing the late Rebellion,
and Concerting Measures for it; and that
there appeared a great Desire in some Peo∣ple
to have it out; and, no doubt, it is
the true Interest of the present Govern∣ment
to discover those Things; and the
Discovery whereof might indeed contribute
to the Preventing more of these unhappy
Gentlemen coming into like Circumstan∣ces
with these, and so, in Effect, be of Ser∣vice
to their Friends: That these Gentle∣men
were privy to, and partly in those
Treasons, there is little Reason to question;
what else can be the Meaning of the Words
in the Lord <HI>Der<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Speech, that <HI>Some</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
<HI>Means have been proposed to me for Saving
my Life, which I look'd on as inconsistent
with Honour and Conscience, and therefore I
rejected them.</HI> It is evident then that he
was able to have complyed with the means
proposed, otherwise it would have been a
Prevarication to say, That <HI>Therefore he re∣jected
them</HI>; if he had been uncapable to
have complyed, if he had not been in the
said Train of Treasons, if he had not been
able to make Discoveries, he could with
more Truth, and much more to his own
Vindication, have said, that it was not in
his Power, and that <HI>therefore</HI> those Propo∣sals
were ineffectual to him.</P>
<P>But while, on the other Hand, he re∣jected
the Proposal that was made to him,
by which his Life might have been sa∣ved;
Who was cruel to my Lord <HI>Der∣wentwater</HI>
but my Lord <HI>Derwentwater?</HI>
And who caused him to be executed, the
King or himself?</P>
<P>It is not worth while to examine here
what he calls inconsistent with Honour
and Conscience: If it was not inconsistent
with his Honour and Conscience to rise in
Arms, that is as far as lay in him to De∣pose,
Murther, and Destroy the King, and
all his Royal Family; It cannot be in∣consistent
with the greatest Clemency in
his Majesty to bring such to the Block.
But on the other Hand, it was the highest
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Testimony imaginable of Royal Clemen∣cy,
to offer such Men their Lives upon
their Testifying their Sorrow for the
Crime, by giving a true and faithful Con∣fession
of all the Parts of the Design, as far
as they were really concern'd in it: While
they deny this, what Token of Contrition,
what Satisfaction of future Loyalty can
they give? They pleaded Guilty, <HI>say their
Party,</HI> and threw themselves upon Mercy,
and such are generally thought more proper
Objects of Mercy than others: But let us
examine what is meant here by Pleading
Guilty, for except only the Form, I deny
that they <HI>pleaded Guilty</HI> at all.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Derwentwater</HI> very ingenu∣ously
explains what he understands by his
Pleading Guilty, it is in his Speech at the
Bar, the 13th of <HI>February</HI>: <HI>The said Earl
acknowledges with a real Sorrow, that at
the Time in the Articles mentioned, he was
in Arms, and with others did march thro',
and invade several Parts of this Kingdom.</HI>
The Law indeed accepts this as Pleading
Guilty, because the Fact being acknow∣ledg'd,
the Law determines from it both
the Guilt and the Penalty. But what's
this towards a Penitent, or towards such
a Confession as must merit Pardon.</P>
<P>When a Prisoner pleads Guilty to the
Judge, he needs to own nothing but the
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
Fact, the Court, as I said, determines all
the rest.</P>
<P>But when a Prisoner pleads Guilty to
his offended Prince, to move and implore
his Clemency and Mercy, it is not the
Fact but the Crime that he must charge
himself with; it behoves him to come and
acknowledge it thus: SIR, <HI>I own my self
a Rebel to you just Authority; I am now
willing to become your faithful Subject, to
Recognize your Authority, and confess all my
Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>But in all these Gentlemen's Pleading
Guilty, there is not one Word of Confes∣sing
the CRIME, tho' there is of Con∣fessing
the Fact, that they were in Arms,
but do not own that they were Rebels:
Nay, my Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> is so honest, <HI>if the
Paper said to be left behind him be Genuine,</HI>
as to acknowledge he prevaricated in his
Pleading <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Now let any Divine tell us, nay even
let a Popish Priest tell us, if this be sound
in Divinity. Does God Himself Pardon
any Sinners that does not Confess their
Offences, or that Confess one part, but will
not Confess all? What claim to Mercy
can any Christian make, upon any Scrip∣tures
foundation but upon a FULL and
Sincere Confession, I say FULL and Sin∣cere;
<HI>He that hides his Sin shall not Pros∣per:</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
<HI>But he that Confesses, and Forsakes,
shall find Mercy.</HI> Prov. 28. 13.</P>
<P>Now these Gentlemen have indeed Con∣fess'd
the Fact, and <HI>what is there in that?</HI>
Were they not Evident, and easy to be Pro∣ved?
Was it in their power to Deny any
Part? Were they not all taken in the Field
of Battle, with the Sword of Rebellion in
their Hands? What thanks to them for that
Plea? But if they had come ingenuously
and confess'd <HI>the Treason,</HI> acknowledg'd <HI>the
Crime</HI> of it, laid open the Train of it, given
in a FULL Account of the Rise and Pro∣gress
of it; and then have express'd their
Sorrow that they should be Guilty of such
a horrid Crime; had this been done, and
Mercy had been refused them, indeed they
would have had some room to talk of Se∣verity,
<HI>tho' none then of Injustice.</HI></P>
<P>But this way of Confessing does not, in
my Opinion, reach the Case at all, they
have made no Confession of the Rebellion,
tho' they have of their being in Arms; in
a word, they have acknowledg'd themselves
Rebells in or Sense, but they have not ack∣nowledg'd
that <HI>they are sensible</HI> of their be∣ing
Rebells; or that it is Rebellion in their
Own Sense; and pray what does all this
amount to? For my share I do not see they
have pleaded Guilty with any View but
that of the Scaffold.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
The Confession of a Penitent is quite a∣nother
thing, his confession will be Com∣pleat,
will be Sincere, and he will be more
afflicted for the Crime, than the Punishment.</P>
<P>Again, he that confesses his Guilt, must
confess <HI>all</HI> his Guilt, and <HI>all</HI> his Treason;
and he cannot be said to make an ingenuous
Confession that conceals any thing he
knows, which may be for the Detecting
the Treason, if any Part lies conceal'd, or
that may be for the Safety and Advantage
of the Prince, against whom he has offended.</P>
<P>And here comes in the Objection, This is
against my Honour and Conscience, because
it will Impeach my Friends, break the
wicked Compact, the Engagement, or Oath
of Secresy taken with other Traytors, <HI>and
what then?</HI> The Consequence is, <HI>he takes
his Word again,</HI> as the <HI>Scots</HI> call it, relapses
to a Rebel in Inclination, and begs par∣don
that he has acknowledge'd that little
that he has.</P>
<P>In a word, if these Gentlemen were not
spar'd, it was because they would have
their Lives upon their own Terms, or not
at all; they would have Mercy shewn to
them for Sins unconfess'd; is there any
one of them that has given a full Narrative
of all the Treasons they have Committed?
They have acknowledg'd the capital Part
indeed, which, as we may say, they could
not avoid, or get clear of; but what else
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
have they Confess'd? Have they told the
Government any one thing which they
did not know before? Had my Lord <HI>Der∣wentwater</HI>
made such an ingenuous Ack∣nowledgment
of all he knew of the Rebel∣lion,
I am bold to say, he would have
Merited some Mercy, and for that Reason
I believe he would have found it.</P>
<P>But this manner of Confession, say they,
would have betray'd Friends, brought
Great Men and Great Families to Ruin;
and, perhaps, a great many of them too;
and it is below the Honour of a Nobleman
to turn Informer.</P>
<P>It were to be wish'd such Men would put
the Circumstances they have brought them∣selves
to into the Ballance, and consider that
with the Point of Honour they speak of:
If they had stood out either in their De∣fence,
or if, after Conviction, had resolv'd
to meet Death as from the Hand of an
Enemy, then indeed it could not be ex∣pected
that they should make any such
Thing as a Confession. But when they
lie prostrate at the Foot of Majesty, Con∣demn'd
by the Law, Acknowledging the
Fact, and Imploring Mercy, this is quite
another Thing; and that these Men should
reject the Conditions upon which Mercy
was offered them, this is perfectly inconsist∣ent
with the nature of their Submission, and
aggravates the Crime they were guilty of
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
before, and makes the Necessity of dealing
with them in a Course of strict Justice;
and this may be another Reason against
Mercy.</P>
<P>It is below the Majesty of the Govern∣ment
to name the Folly and Madness of
their Friends as a Reason for their Execu∣tion,
and yet it deserves some Notice too:
No sooner were these Men, with the rest
of the <HI>Preston</HI> Prisoners, come up, and had
been a little while in Prison, but their
Friends laugh'd loudly at the Govern∣ment,
telling them in their Teeth, that
they durst not put them to Death; as if
the Power that was able to break them in
the Field, should not be able to punish
them when in Prison. But so preposterous
have they been in this Part, that they have
pusht the Government almost upon the ne∣cessity
of bringing them to the Block, to
satisfy the World that they dare do it.</P>
<P>This is very hard upon their Friends,
and has made their being brought to the
Block very reasonable in the present Go∣vernment,
if not absolutely necessary; and
it is worth while for them to consider it on
several Accounts: (1.) How just the King
had been to have executed many more, and
have given that Insolence of their Friends
as the Reason of it. And (2.) Whether
tho' for Time past it has not been done;
yet that if the King should think fit to
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
execute some meerly upon the Importunity
of this Circumstance, who otherwise his
Majesty's Goodness might incline him to
pardon; I say, whether their Blood, tho'
not innocent, would not be so to those
People, and be laid at their Door.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there is a more forci∣ble
Reason still to give why his Majesty
may not have thought fit to extend that
Mercy to these Men, which otherwise,
perhaps, they might have found; <HI>viz.</HI>
The continued Threatenings of the Party
still to renew their Attempts, to return
with a greater Force, and to revive the Re∣bellion,
promising to rescue their Sufferers
out of the Hand of publick Justice, and
to return the Treatment they have met
with.</P>
<P>Let any one judge whether a threaten∣ing
Enemy is an Object of Mercy; and
whether it would consist with the Honour
of his Majesty's Government, and the
Safety of his Kingdom, to pardon Enemies
that are Insulting him when out of his
Hands, and Conditioning with him even
when they are in.</P>
<P>It must be allow'd, that Clemency is the
Glory of a King, and Mercy the Honour
of his Government: But Clemency is to
be directed by Wisdom, as the Sword is to
be managed by Council. Rebellious Sub∣jects
<HI>unhumbled,</HI> can never be the proper
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
Subject of the Prince's Clemency: Neither
is Justice executed upon obstinate Rebels
any Breach of Moderation in Government.</P>
<P>And how is a Rebel humbled, that
owns not his Rebellion to be a Crime?
How is he an Object of Mercy, that will
not accept of his Life but upon his own
Conditions? It's time to Capitulate when
they are not in the Hands of Justice. My
Lord <HI>Nithisdale,</HI> who has made his Escape,
is in a much proper Posture to ask Mercy
after the manner they did, than they were.
He that implores Mercy, must first put
himself into the Condition that denominates
him a proper Object of Mercy, or he has
but little Reason to expect it.</P>
<P>His Majesty, no doubt, has yet more
and more forcible Reasons for not Granting
the Mercy that was petitioned for to the
late Lord <HI>Derwentwater, &amp;c.</HI> but if not, I
cannot think but these will make it evident
to all the World, that it was not reasona∣ble
for them to expect Mercy in the Cir∣cumstances
they were in, or safe for his
Majesty to grant it. I hope those who are
left, will take Care to behave more suitable
to their own Interest, and to deserve better
the Mercy they expect.</P>
