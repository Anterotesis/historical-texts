<HEAD>An Humble DEDICATION TO THE University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CLARISSIMI &amp; DOCTISSIMI,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Famous University of <HI>Oxford</HI> having been, of all the Universities in <HI>Europe,</HI> the most Anci∣ent, and, for many A∣ges, the most celebrated Fountain of Learning, the Seat of the Muses, the Honour of the Protestant World, and the particular Glory of <HI>Great Britain</HI>: The Author of these Sheets comes prepar'd to lay this Tract at her Feet, with all the Decency and
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Respect, that the most affectionate Duty of an Admirer of Virtue and Li∣terature can oblige him to.</P>
<P>For this Reason, and from the Sense of Justice to so Learned and Excellent a Society, he grounds this Dedication upon an Assurance, next to a Demon∣stration, that nothing like what com∣mon Fame has slanderously loaded this famous Body with, can be her Due; that it is not possible, without the most manifest Injustice, to fix such things upon the University, as are, at this Time, wickedly alledg'd by her enrag'd Enemies; and that therefore it is every honest Man's Duty to assist in her Vindication.</P>
<P>As nothing is more certain, so nothing is more pleasing to those, who honour and wish well to the University of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> than to hear, that the said Univer∣sity has always been a constant Asserter of loyal Principles, and a deep Sufferer for her steddy Adherence in Practice to those Principles, always distinguish∣ing herself by her Loyalty to her So∣vereign in the worst of Times: Hi∣story is full of the Particulars; there we read with Pleasure, how she has frequently strip'd her self of her Orna∣ments,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
to supply the Necessities of her Princes; and suffered several Sieges, and various Distresses, in Defence of the Monarchy, in the Times of Rebel∣lion and Usurpation.</P>
<P>Her Churches, and the several Chappels of her Colleges, have con∣stantly resounded with the learned Discourses of the Heads of Houses, Fellows, Graduates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Defence of those ancient and orthodox Doctrines, of Submission to our lawful Sovereigns, being subject to the higher Powers for Conscience sake; and of their Ab∣horrence of that damnable Position, <HI>That it is lawful, upon any Pretence what∣soever, to take up Arms against the King.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be pleaded against her, without great Injustice, as I hear it is now, that this was the Usage in <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> several Years ago; but that she has intermitted the same, and profest other Principles since; on the contrary, it is affirm'd, that she never deviated from the <HI>Profession</HI> of a due absolute Subjection to her Kings; and we can∣not believe, that she can have forgot to practise conformable to the said Pro∣fession; and therefore it seems the more reasonable to expose, at this Time,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the Attempts which some People make, to lay Reproach and Scandal upon her, as if she, or any of her Body, had a∣vowedly acted undutifully to our pre∣sent Sovereign, raised Tumults, Mobbs, and Rebellion; Things so inconsistent with the Christian Rule, so directly opposite to the Principles of the Pro∣testant Religion, and, particularly, of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; to all which the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> has been, and is still, esteemed so great an Ornament, that it cannot, without great want of Charity, be suggested, that the said University has any Ways been con∣cerned that way.</P>
<P>Permit therefore, Reverend and Learned, that an humble Advocate for your injur'd Reputation should expostulate with your Enemies, on the Injustice they offer you, when they propagate such scandalous things, as are daily suggested against you, and against the Honour and Reputation of your University.</P>
<P>AS IF you were now less loyal, and less submissive to the higher Powers than formerly.</P>
<P>AS IF you had forgotten your pro∣fest Principles of Obedience, or could
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
dispence with the Conformity of your Practice to your Profession.</P>
<P>AS IF the University was capable of being corrrupted with Faction; or were less loyal and dutiful to King <HI>George,</HI> than they were to Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>AS IF it were possible, the Conta∣gion of <HI>Jacobitism</HI> (which is Perjury) could infect the University; or that the Sons of the Prophets could thus commence Children of Disobedience.</P>
<P>AS IF it were possible, that the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> could be tainted with Rellellion, <HI>which is as the Sin of Witchcraft.</HI></P>
<P>These things, I am satisfy'd, can never be; it cannot consist with com∣mon Charity to think, much less to prompt others to think, so absurdly of so glorious a Body of Men, illuminated with the sublimest Knowledge, divine and humane; instructed by a Succes∣sion of Learned, Pious, and truly Re∣verend Divines; and openly professing Principles diametrically opposite to what they are now charg'd with.</P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>Excellent and Vene∣rable</HI>! permit the Author, in this De∣dication, briefly to enter into the Par∣ticulars
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
from whence these Suggestions are maliciously drawn; and from thence, how easy will it be to shew the Improbability there is, that the University should be in the least con∣cern'd in, or guilty of the Facts laid to her Charge.</P>
<P><HI>As first,</HI> The black Charge of Riots and Tumults in the Streets of the Uni∣versity; breaking the King's Peace; and turning the usual Assembly of the learned Members of the University, such as, Students, Graduates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into a Rabble, a Rout, a rebellious and tumultuous Mobb.</P>
<P>Such is the good Government of the University in general; such the ri∣gorous Execution of their private and statutary Laws; such the Honesty and Vigilance of the Reverend the <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI>; such the Fidelity and Dili∣gence of the Under-Officers of the U∣niversity; all concurring as well to re∣strain, as to resent, that it is well known, how impracticable such a thing is; that it cannot be; that the Power of the said <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> is such, in causing the Doors of the Colleges to be kept shut, and a strict Account to be taken of all the Students, both
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of the Egress and Regress, that it is not possible for any to be absent; or if any are, they may be publickly and severely call'd to an Account for the same: Seeing then that, on all the most strict Enquiries which have been made, so few have been found out, and punish'd for being absent from their Chambers at the Time of the said Riot, it must certainly follow, <HI>un∣deniably follow</HI>! that if there was any such Riot and Tumult in the Streets of <HI>Oxford,</HI> it must be made by, and made up of the Rabbles and People of the Town, the <HI>Canaille,</HI> and the Crowds of the Villages adjacent, and the like; and that not one Scholar of the Town was among them; for if there had, it cannot be doubted, but the <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> by his known Vigi∣lance and Diligence, and his irresistible Authority, COULD have detected them, and have <HI>rusticated,</HI> or other∣wise expos'd them all as they de∣served.</P>
<P>It is then farther alledg'd, that the Persons, of whom these riotous Assem∣blies were compos'd, committed di∣vers Sorts of Violences; such as break∣ing Windows, pulling down Bonefires
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
built up for publick Rejoicings, on the Day of the King's Birth, Accession, or Coronation, or on Days appointed for Thanksgiving for such things as those; and after this, to march in an arm'd and violent Manner, and pull down and demolish the <HI>Meeting-House,</HI> or Place of religious Worship, belonging to the <HI>Dissenters.</HI> Alas, how do Men give themselves a Liberty to fall upon, and to asperse the most innocent and inoffensive of their Brethren? Can it be rational to believe, that a Body of Gentlemen, many of them of Qua∣lity, most of them of good Families, and all of them of good Proficiency in Breeding and Manners, entred into particular Societies for Learning, for polishing their Understandings, for a∣dorning their Souls with Principles of Religion and Virtue, with Rules for good Manners, to qualify them for Gentlemen, and for Instructors of o∣thers? Is it possible, I say, that these can be guilty of the <HI>Street-Madness</HI> here talked of, and can deviate into Mobbs and Rabbles! It cannot be! It is not rational to suggest it of them! Again, when we call to mind, that the Stu∣dents of the University are, generally,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
made up of such as have set their Faces towards <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; who have the Temple and the Altar in their View, and are learning the divine Stile of the Pulpit; that are to serve at the Altar, and minister in holy Things; is it reasonable to imagine, that these can sink into Clamour and Tumult, and dishonour their Dignity so far, as to herd in with the Disturbers of the Civil Peace? It can never be! we can∣not, we must not believe it.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the most pure Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> preach'd upon all Occasions by her most Reverend Divines, and practis'd in Times of the greatest Extremity, by her most sincere Disciples, is a sacred Pattern of Obedience to the Civil Ma∣gistrate, as to the Power which is or∣dained of God; and the breaking out into Riot and Tumult, <HI>which is Rebel∣lion,</HI> is as inconsistent with the said Do∣ctrine of the Church, that the Church herself has, in all Ages, held such in Abomination, who have thought fit to break into such unchristian Courses; maintaining, with her utmost Endea∣vour, that blessed Scripture-Rule lest upon Record by St. <HI>Paul, Let every</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>Soul be subject to the higher Powers.</HI> This then having been the avowed Principle of Obedience, profess'd in, and own'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> we humbly appeal to you, Excellent and Learned, the Heads, Fellows, Gradu∣ates, and Students of the famous Uni∣versity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> whether we ought, in Justice or Charity, to believe that any Members of your Body, especially of those who are preparing themselves for the Service of the holy Altar, can be guilty of such scandalous Crimes, as those of Rabble, Tumult, breaking the Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or that, if they were, those Offences would not meet with the utmost Resentment, and severest Punishment from those, whose Duty it is to take Cognizance thereof.</P>
<P>It cannot but be grateful to the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to remind the Reader of these Sheets, that with∣in those sacred Walls have, for many Ages, been professed, preached, and, to the immortal Glory of the Univer∣sity, been practis'd, those most Chri∣stian and Heavenly Doctrines of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience</HI>; and that in their full and most extended Sense and Meaning: and it would be
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
the absurdest thing in the World for us to suggest, that the Professors of those sublime Principles can be guilty of any thing so diametrically opposite thereto; as is the mobbing together, against Law, and against the Power of the Legal Magistrate, which is indeed no less than against the King himself; and therefore we can by no means think any other, but that all the Re∣ports we have had of these things, are meer Forgeries, and fictitious Stories, contrived by the Enemies of our holy Mother the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to brand her most obedient Sons with the most hateful of Crimes, and which are most repugnant to her Establishment, and profest Doctrine.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as the Charge descends to yet greater and greater Offences, so much stronger are the Arguments against our entertaining any Suspicion of their being true: Even as <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> in his <HI>Spartan</HI> Constitution, omitted Laws against certain Crimes, as what he would not suppose it possible his Citizens could commit; with what Face can the Enemies of your most Reverend Body, pretend to make mention of the Extravagancies of the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
common People, in falling upon their Brethren and Neighbours, meerly for their professing to serve God in some manner differing from the Establish'd Rites; and with Violence, and the ru∣dest kind of Persecution, pull down and demolish their Chappel, or Meeting∣House; notwithstanding the same are allow'd to them by the Law, and are legally qualify'd; that the poor, ignorant, deluded, and abused People, the <HI>Plebeii</HI> of the City, and the adjacent Villages, might, in the Heat of an en∣rag'd Multitude, and, perhaps, intoxi∣cated by Liquor, run upon things so extravagant and unchristian, I will not dispute; but, to be sure, not one Member of the <HI>famous Ʋniversity of OXFORD</HI> could be so weak, so ig∣norant, or so wicked, as to be found in the Streets at that Time.</P>
<P>It is impossible, Heaven forbid, so uncharitable a Thought should be har∣bour'd in any Man's Breast, that calls himself a Christian. Good God! What, Men of Religion to demolish Places of Worship; Men breeding up for the Pulpit, to make a Bonefire of Pulpits; Men set apart to serve at the Altar, to pull down Altars! It is impossible;
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
What, the Sons of the Prophets thus become Sons of <HI>Belial?</HI> It can never be; Sure no Christian can believe it without Breach of the great Rule of Christian Charity, and that in an un∣usual Manner; when, I say, it is im∣possible to believe these things, and it cannot be true, and we can by no means entertain such thoughts; it must be understood, that it is impos∣sible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without, at the same Time, branding the University with the black∣est Mark of Infamy; and believing her degenerated to all that is vile and contemptible; believing the best con∣stituted Foundations to be converted into a Rabble of Licentiousness; and the most excellent College-Government, to be deviated into the worst kind of Confusion; supposing the Beauty and Comeliness of that most excellent Se∣minary of Learning to be defac'd; all the Order and Oeconomy of the re∣spective Houses, inverted and over∣whelm'd; their Pretences to Religion, shamefully abandoned; their Claim to a well-order'd Society, given up; their Discipline neglected; and, in a Word, the whole University descended to a Crowd; Government dissolv'd; Sub∣ordination,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
which is the very Fabrick of Order, blended with Superiority, and both together sunk into the worst Disorder; the Church of <HI>England</HI> turn'd Rebels; Protestants, turn'd Persecu∣tors; and the most famous Seminary of Religion, turn'd a Nest of Pha∣naticks.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Excellent and Reverend, that some Warmth most naturally at∣tends such a Thought as this; it is only by the liveliest Description of what these Crimes would produce, to evince the Truth of what I have advanc'd in your Defence; and to shew, how reasonable it is that we should not, in any kind, give Credit to the scandalous Stories, which your Enemies suggest against you.</P>
<P>I come now to the most malicious of all the Reflections yet made; and this is, their fathering the Voice of the Rabble upon the University; mak∣ing the learned Students of your Col∣leges join in with the Shouts of the <HI>Peasants</HI> and <HI>Boors,</HI> and fouling their Mouths with the course Jargon of the Street, crying, an <HI>Ormond,</HI> an <HI>Ormond</HI>; no <HI>King George</HI>; <HI>High-Church,</HI> &amp;c. and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
I should not care to repeat Words so ungrateful to loyal Ears, were I not well satisfy'd, that the Members of your Honourable Society were not capable of being so far demented, not capable of uttering Words so incon∣sistent with common Sense, as well as with common Manners; and that I may the more effectually vindicate the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> from the Suggestion, I need do no more, than to enquire into the Rationality of these Exclamations; for if I prove the Words to have neither Consistency, Honesty, or Meaning, I hope no Body will contend about the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI>'s being in the least concern'd in them.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, first, That, in the very Connection of the Words, a certain Opposition is plac'd between the Center, and the two Extremes; (1.) <HI>Ormond, Ormond</HI>; no <HI>King George:</HI> (2.) Take them the other Way, <HI>No King</HI> George; <HI>High-Church.</HI></P>
<P>So that, in short, King <HI>George</HI> is placed in direct Opposition to <HI>Ormond,</HI> and in direct Opposition to <HI>High-Church</HI>; and, which is still more extraordinary, <HI>Ormond</HI> and <HI>High-Church</HI> are both plac'd in Opposition to King <HI>George:</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Now we all know, that this is no U∣niversity Language; the Learned and Reverend Members of your several Colleges use quite another Dialect. King <HI>George</HI> being legally enthron'd, crown'd by the lawful Authority of the Kingdom, is now become the Lord's Anointed as much, and as effe∣ctually, as any of his Predecessors; and as such, has been recogniz'd by the University; and now to cry, <HI>No King GEORGE,</HI> is to make their Loyalty a meer <HI>Witch</HI>'s Prayer, ring their Bells backward, and raise Rebellion against their only lawful Sovereign.</P>
<P>Now it can never be thought, that the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> can do thus, unless we shall own, she is turn'd <HI>Phanatick</HI>; has embrac'd the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principles of 41; and is actually en∣gag'd in Rebellion, to depose the Lord's Anointed, and bring their law∣ful Sovereign to Destruction; for we have always allow'd, that to raise War against our Sovereign, and to kill, mur∣ther, and destroy the Sovereign, differ not at all in the Treason; and have no other specifick Difference, than there is between the Endeavour, which is Treason in the overt-Act;
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
and the Perpetration, which is Treason compleated.</P>
<P>Sure it cannot be call'd a Compli∣ment to the University, to believe she cannot be guilty of any thing so un∣natural as this, so contrary to her a∣vow'd Principles, and steddy Practice for many Ages.</P>
<P>As to the Name of <HI>Ormond,</HI> which has been the Catch-word of the Rabble, in the several Street-tumults which have, of late, so much disturb'd the Nation, there is so much incongruous Nonsense in the Cry, that it has help'd to make those Mobbs odious and hate∣ful to the Country; and has shewn the People, that they have none to look to beyond the King upon the Throne; for why do they cry, an <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> an <HI>Ormond</HI>; they will not pre∣tend, that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> makes any Claim to the Crown; if then they have any one to talk of next to the King, why do they not name him? This they dare not do; because that would be to own fairly what they mean, <HI>the Pretender</HI>; and this, openly profest, would open the Peoples Eyes too soon; for did they openly and a∣vowedly cry out, <HI>the Pretender</HI>; <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<HI>Pretender</HI>; <HI>no King GEORGE</HI>; <HI>no Ha∣nover</HI>; I say, would they cry thus, their own Mobb would forsake them; and therefore having nothing else to say, they cry, <HI>Ormond, Ormond,</HI> whether with a Meaning, or without a Mean∣ing, that they may have something to fill the Mouths of the People with; for to have a Mobb, and no <HI>Halloo,</HI> would be a Mobb and no Mobb, and would signify nothing; for Rabbles are always rais'd by Murmur, and kept alive by Shouts; Noise is as essential to a Mobb, as Ammunition is to an Ar∣my, they could do nothing without.</P>
<P>But certainly this can never be the University of <HI>Oxford!</HI> We all know the Veneration the University has for <HI>Ormond,</HI> and how entirely they are in his personal Interest; and they cannot be ignorant of his late Grace's present Circumstances, and the Mischief such Use made of his Name would be to him; how it would suppose him, ei∣ther to be for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or to have the Vanity to accept of this Elevation of his Name by the Mobb, in Opposi∣tion to the King; and so to set up for a Pretender himself; which would be equally ridiculous, and, in the End, e∣qually
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
fatal to him: Nor can the Uni∣versity be ignorant, how this would expose him to the superiour Power of his Enemies; and put the Government to the Necessity of prosecuting him for those other Things, in which they were before enclin'd to shew him Fa∣vour; how it seems to set a Subject in Competition with his Sovereign, and make it absolutely necessary to crush him, for that dangerous Popularity which other Men put upon him, whe∣ther it be with his Consent or no. Now the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who have so entire an Affection for the Person of their late <HI>Chancellor,</HI> cannot, without great Injustice, be suppos'd so uncon∣cern'd for his Safety, and so little in∣terested in him, as to expose him to so just a Reproach, as this would bring upon him.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, to do the late Duke a piece of Justice, which he so much stands in need of at this Time; I have been credibly inform'd, that he received the Account of these things with a just Indignation; that he dis∣own'd it in every Part; that he potest∣ed openly, it was what he abhorr'd; and was so far from approving, that he
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
hop'd all his Friends would clear him of having any Concern in it; and, a∣bove all, that he express'd himself par∣ticularly pleas'd and satisfy'd, when it was told him, that the University was not in the least to be suppos'd to be concern'd in it; and that his Grace's Opinion was the same as ours is, and as all others must be, who are Friends to the University, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Uni∣versity could not be so distracted; it was impossible.</P>
<P>But to leave his Grace to protest a∣gainst it; thus mobbing his Name in the Streets, and entituling him to a Crime worse than the greatest of those, for which he already stands impeach'd; I cannot but engage a little in Behalf of the University, as to the other Cry; <HI>No Hanover, no King GEORGE</HI>; <HI>High-Church, High-Church.</HI></P>
<P>What the Meaning of the Words, <HI>High-Church, High-Church,</HI> is in the Ori∣ginal, with the various Readings there∣of; and more particularly, how they are to be understood, as plac'd by Way of <HI>Antithesis</HI> against <HI>Hanover</HI> and King <HI>George,</HI> I leave to the Decision of the University, to be determined in full Convocation; for, doubtless, the Uni∣versity
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
would give the true Etimology of them, as they are now made use of; nor would it a little contribute to the enlightening the World in that Matter, on this eminent Occasion; and especi∣ally to vindicate the University her self, from many wicked and malicious Calumnies, by which her Enemies think to charge her with being in the Interest of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Now, whe∣ther the Words <HI>HIGH CHƲRCH,</HI> as now used, are synonimous to the Words <HI>Popery, right Line, indefeasible, hereditary Right</HI>; and so are to be understood, that <HI>High-Church</HI> are for the <HI>Pretender</HI>; or whether they are otherwise to be understood; and how is it possible they should be otherwise understood? These are the Questions; and indeed they are Questions worthy the publick Decision of the University, by either explaining, or exploding which, the University would bring to her self immortal Fame of one sort or other.</P>
<P>To leave therefore the Discourse of this Nature, and leave the ridiculous Jargon of the Mobb, to the just Cen∣sure of the University; it remains on∣ly to mention the said Tumults, with the same just Abhorrence that the said
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
University look on them with; and having thus cleared the University of being any Way guilty, either of abet∣ting, or encouraging such preposterous Things; I come next, by Way of an humble Address to the University, to recommend to them, the Necessity there seems to be of their giving the World such Testimony, as to their great Wisdom shall seem meet, of their utter Dislike and Detestation of these wicked and pernicious Practices; with necessary Assurances, that not the Col∣leges, no, nor any Members thereof, had the least Concern therein.</P>
<P>This seems necessary at this Time; because as it was a Misfortune to the University, to have these Riots and Tumults approach so near them, as to be within the Walls of the same City where they reside; so other People being made to believe, however falsly, that the University have, some Way or other, directly or indirectly, been concern'd in, or Assistant and encou∣raging to, the said rebellious doings; have taken Encouragement from hence, to soment the like in many Parts of his Majesty's Dominions; and have given the Example of <HI>Oxford</HI> as their Prece∣dent.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Now although some are, as the Au∣thor hereof professes to be, well as∣sured, that the University has had no Confederacy in this wicked Affair; nor that any of her Reverend Mem∣bers could reasonably be imagined to show themselves among the said Rab∣bles on those unhappy Occasions; yet for the sakes of some, who have not the same Charity, having been de∣luded by evil-disposed Persons, whose Actions required to have such a Cover for them; and who have therefore believed, that Abundance of the Stu∣dents, Graduates, Fellows, and even of the Reverend and Excellent Supe∣riours of the University, have given Countenance to the Rabbles, and have even appear'd in the Streets of the Ci∣ty of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the said rebellious Tu∣mults; for these Reasons, and for ever to establish the Reputation of the fa∣mous University, in the Opinion of all good Men, it is most humbly repre∣sented, how necessary it would be to have the University declare themselves on these Heads.</P>
<P>This would do more than all the Vindications of their Friends can pre∣tend to; this would, perhaps, do more
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
to prevent future Riots and Tumults, in other Parts of the Kingdom, even than Horse and Dragoons.</P>
<P>On the other Hand,</P>
<P>IF the University <HI>is willing</HI> the Slan∣ders of her Enemies should take Place:</P>
<P>IF she is <HI>contented</HI> that it should be believ'd, both by Natives at Home, and by Foreigners Abroad, that she has forsaken the Loyalty of her Principles, abandon'd the ancient Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Pro∣fession made by her Learned and Pi∣ous Predecessors:</P>
<P>IF she is <HI>desirous</HI> to have it believed, that the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> is a Pat∣tern of Rebellion; and that she has imbib'd the <HI>fanatick</HI> Principles of 41.</P>
<P>IF she would be thought to have declar'd War against King <HI>GEORGE</HI>; and openly to have espoused the Inte∣rest of the <HI>Pretender:</HI></P>
<P>IF she desires that the Rabbles and Tumults, lately raised in her Streets, should be called by her Name; and should, as in her Name, be recom∣mended to the rest of the distracted People of this Nation. In a Word,</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
IF the University glories in the first Violence offered to the peaceable E∣stablishment of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and a glorious Protestant Race of Princes; and declares her self to be for the forcible Introductoin of a <HI>Po∣pish, French-bred,</HI> thoroughly provok'd, resolv'd to be reveng'd, <HI>Pretender</HI>; she has no more to do, than to sit still, and take no Notice of this Address; her Silence being all the Favour that is asked by those, who she de∣sires should take it all in the Affir∣mative.</P>

But as this kind of Honour has been, for some Ages, pretty much out of Fashion with wise Men; and that now personal Merit seems something necessary to qualify Men of Quality for the Esteem of the Age wherein they live, we must be content to wave all the Pretences, which may be justly made to the Honour of the Family now before us; to bury the Trophies of Ancestors; and begin our History with the personal Conduct, the Bra∣very, the generous Principles, the great Actions, the Fidelity, the Prudence, Policy, Gallantry, and other distin∣guishing Vertues of the Person of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>; for which he has been so justly belov'd by the <HI>English</HI> Nation: And from hence, if a faithful Account be drawn, we shall soon see, whether the People of these Nations have not, with great Reason, so much distinguish'd his Grace in their Affections, in these Days of his declining Circumstances; and thus we shall, if true Merit appears, build his Grace the most lasting Monument of Glory; because founded upon his own Personal Merit, according to that of <HI>Juvenal, English'd</HI> by Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI></P>

<L>Ergo ut miremur te, nec tua primum ali∣quid da.</L>
<BIBL>Juven. Sat. VIII.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>That we may therefore you, not yours admire,</L>
<L>First, Sir, some Honour of your own acquire.</L></Q>
<P>And, first, to the Honour of his first Appearance in the Field, we find his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> one of the first of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, who ap∣pear'd Volunteer in the Field in the first War against the <HI>French</HI>; where he made his first Campaign under the truly-Glorious King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>If the Example of such a King, and His Majesty's special Affection to the Duke, inspir'd his Soul with vigorous Principles; and his natural Courage join'd to them, prompted him to great Actions, nothing is more certain, than that this Virtue had its early Re∣ward, in the Distinction with which His Majesty treated the Duke upon all Occasions; the Favour he shew'd him, and that particular Affection which the King shew'd to him in several re∣markable Cases.</P>
<P>I know it has been suggested, that the King, who all Men know was a politick Prince, and found out the Inside
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
of Men as soon as any Prince in the World could do, did not shew his Grace so much Favour singly upon his own Account; but that finding but few of the Nobility, at that Time, enclin'd to a Military Life; and being very desirous, by any Means, to invite and encourage them to come into the Field, he put the Duke in such a Posture and Figure in his Camp, as was enough to move any Man of Honour to love the War for his sake; wherein the King seem'd, as they said, to treat the Duke as if he had been the Representative of the Nobility; and that they might see with what Distinction an <HI>Englishman</HI> would be used in the Army; for, said they, the King was not so ill read in Men, as not to know that there were many, who might lay as great a Claim to his Favour, on Account of Merit, as the Duke.</P>
<P>During the first Year therefore of the War, the greatest Part of the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Fame consisted in those Favours which the King did him, and the Honours which he receiv'd from Foreigners on that Account; for whom the King honour'd, it was no Wonder at all to see honour'd by others.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>The Duke was but a young Man when he went into the Army, which was in the Year 1690, when he went over to <HI>Ireland</HI>: And we read of him at the Battle of the <HI>Boyn</HI>; but all we have of him in that Action terminates in this, that the Day after the Battle he was sent with some Troops to take Possession of <HI>Dublin</HI>; and though this was, as is noted, but to take Possession; for the Citizens of <HI>Dublin</HI> had already taken Arms, and turn'd out the <HI>Irish,</HI> and sent to the King to receive them into his Protection; yet was Monsieur <HI>Overkirk</HI> sent with the Troops; so that the Duke had no Command, but was sent with them, as being a Person by Name honour'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his Family, and for the great Estate which he possest in that Kingdom; so that hitherto the Duke'<HI>s</HI> History began principally on the Fame of his Birth, and no Merit of his own, other than that he was a brisk, promising, young Gentleman; and having the Advan∣tage of such a Tutor as the King, gave Hopes that, in Time, if his Under∣standing prov'd equal to his Courage, he would be a very great Man; in the mean Time, he was made one of
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
the Privy Council in <HI>Ireland,</HI> an Honour every one knows, was the Consequence of his Birth, and of the Rank which he bore among the Nobility of that Kingdom; in which, if my Memory fails me not, there was not any Man of the Rank of a Duke but himself, at least who embrac'd King <HI>William</HI>'s Party.</P>
<P>The next Time we hear of his Grace, was in <HI>Holland</HI>; for we do not find any thing of him in the Campaign of <HI>Limerick,</HI> or that he quitted the Court to go any more into the Field. But the King having appointed the next Year that famous Congress of Princes at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the like of which the World has not seen for many Ages, his Grace, and the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> were the only two <HI>English</HI> Dukes, who appear'd at Court on that Occasion; in which all that we read of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>; amounts to this: 1. That he made the greatest Show of any of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, and even beyond some Sovereign Prin∣ces that appear'd there. 2. That at the great Feast which the King made, <HI>Au Maison du Bois,</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Grace had a Cushion given him, and
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
sat at Table with the King, next to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and on the King's Right Hand; and that the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> drank to his Grace, and not to any other of the <HI>English</HI> Noblemen.</P>
<P>These were his Grace's first Cam∣paigns for these Honours, and such like, may well be said to take up the first three Year of his Grace's being a∣broad with the King: But the War coming on apace, and the Service be∣ing like to be very warm; he that was thus honoured to be near the King at his Table, could not expect but in the Field, where, it was well known, His Majesty never spar'd him∣self, he must be equally expos'd; and that nothing but the utmost Gallantry, and Love of Action, could recommend him to his Majesty; and as the Gal∣lantry of the Duke had not yet been try'd, but promis'd fair, his Grace prepar'd himself for the Field, with a Resolution to venture his Life with the King, in the Quality of such an Officer, as Time, and the Favour of his Prince, should offer him.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
The King, who was a known En∣courager, as well as Rewarder, of generous and gallant Spirits, soon found the Duke was Master of as much personal Gallantry, as was requisite for a General Officer; and rather strove, upon all Occasions, to add a due Proportion of Phlegm to the great Quantity of Fire, that Na∣ture, and his high Birth, had given this young Duke; that so he might, by weighing and by restraining his Forwardness, bring him to act with Temper, as well as Feat; and pro∣cure him that necessary Qualification of a General, <HI>viz.</HI> a cool Head to a warm Heart; how far his Majesty went in this Part, and with what Suc∣cess, Time has shewn.</P>
<P>The first Appearance, however, that his late Grace made in the Army, was very particular; that is, for its extraordinary Magnificence; his Grace affecting to make his Quarters the general Rendezvous of the <HI>English</HI> Officers; where he kept a Table like a Prince, feasted all that came to him, and liv'd at an Expence superior, not on∣ly to all the other Generals, but even to the King himself: His Majesty, though
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
he never affected that Part himself, nor did at that Time much approve of it, as what tended rather to effe∣minate his Men, than to qualify them for the Fatigues of the Campaign; yet was pleased to indulge this popu∣lar Humour in the Duke, and to make him a particular Allowance to support the Charge; what the Effects of that Allowance was, every one, who was present on those Occasions, knows, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Duke was so far from letting that Allowance be an Assistance or Relief to his private For∣tunes, that it only serv'd to encrease the luxuriant Expence; and he fail'd not to run out with such a boundless Profusion, as consum'd all his Maje∣sty's Allowance, and all that his own Estate could supply also; and not on∣ly that, but to contract immenso Debts; such as, it may be fear'd, the Creditors would gladly know now how to have secur'd to them.</P>
<P>It cannot be forgotten, that some People took so much Offence at this Excess, as to speak to the King of it more than once; and even to suggest, that it seem'd so much to affect Po∣pularity in the Army, that it might
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
be of dangerous Consequence in the End; but that his Majesty was al∣ways pleased to put it by, and to ex∣press himself in Favour of the Duke's Honesty, more than in Favour of his Understanding; intimating, that he was a Man <HI>without Design.</HI></P>
<P>This, however, is noted for the Rea∣der's observation, and whereby he may see, that the Popularity of this great Man seems to have its Rise and Begin∣ning, rather in the Profusion of his Ex∣pences, his Contempt of Money, and an unwary Extravagance, than in the Glory and Merit of his Actions; and if such a monstrous Extravagance can entitle a Person to the Affection, so as to set him above the National Justice, then is the Reward of Vice greater than the Reward of Virtue.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the Way of living above, naturally brought to the Duke a Multitude of Hangers on; and, by Consequence, just so many Flat∣terers, who made it their Business to trumpet Praises and fulsome Things of their Benefactor, and were requited again with the Bounty and Benefi∣cence of the General on all Occasions;
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
and what Wonder if this Behaviour, in an Army full of needy Persons, and Men of Fortune; and that by this, and a general Affability and Conde∣scending, even to a Familiarity, to the Soldiery, he became exceedingly be∣loved by the Army.</P>
<P>It is not for this short Discourse to enter into an Enquiry, how far a true Fame can be raised upon Acti∣ons really not justifiable in themselves; and whether a Person, being to an Ex∣cess profuse, as well of his own, as of other Mens, shall be esteemed an inimitable Virtue. I remember it was objected by some satyrical People in this City, against a Reverend Prelate of our Church, that his Charity was carry'd up to such a Height, that it became criminal; and that he would borrow Money, though he knew him∣self unable to repay it; and that, when borrow'd, he would give it a∣way to relieve the Poor Clergy; and this the censorious Part of the World reproach'd him with, calling it, <HI>Rob∣bery for Burnt Offering.</HI> But much more would this have been criminal, had it been borrow'd to keep a pro∣fuse Table, and to spend in luxurious
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Treats: What offers in his Favour is, that it was the meer Effect of the ge∣nerous Bounty of his Temper, with∣out any Design of evil to any one; and that though he impair'd his E∣state by it; yet his Grace was always ready to yield to reasonable Retrench∣ments at Home; and even to alienate his Estate for the Satisfaction of his just Debts; and that he has testify'd this by particular Examples more than once.</P>
<P>If this should be granted, it will go far indeed to recommend the ge∣nerous Spirit of the Duke, in doing just things at last; but it will be hard, even for the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> it self, to convince the World, that such a thoughtless Bounty, which should reduce a Man of such a Figure, not only to expend the greatest Allowance any King of <HI>England</HI> ever made to a General; but to a Necessity of alienat∣ing his Inheritance, and beggering his Posterity; I say, that such a thought∣less Bounty should entitle a Man to a popular Reputation, and erect him in the Thoughts of the People, as a Person qualify'd to be cry'd up, even against the King himself.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
But, perhaps, this is not all; for who indeed can think it should? Let us look farther into his History, and the next thing we hear of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> is, that when the great Battle of <HI>Landen</HI> was fought, the Duke, who commanded the Troops of the <HI>English</HI> Houshold, and was, by this Time, a Lieutenant-General, was taken Prisoner by the <HI>French,</HI> and carry'd to <HI>Namure</HI>; where, to his great good Fortune, he was immediately ex∣changed for the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who was taken by the King's Army; af∣ter which he serv'd with a due Ap∣plause; for all will allow him to be personally brave, and to be able to act under another General with as much Vigor as can be desir'd.</P>
<P>No sooner was the late Queen come to the Crown, and the War renew∣ed against <HI>France,</HI> with this Ad∣dition, that <HI>Spain</HI> was now against us, as it had been before for us: But Her Majesty having resolv'd upon an Expedition against <HI>Spain,</HI> where Hopes were given, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would, by the Help of the <HI>Almirante de Ca∣stile,</HI> declare against King <HI>Philip,</HI> on Sight of an <HI>English</HI> Fleet and Army:
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
But Her Majesty had made choice of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to command in that Expedition.</P>
<P>How his Grace brought the Army to the Bay of <HI>Cadiz</HI>; landed at Port St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s; and how, for want of his Grace's being a less good-natur'd Man, and more a General, that rich Town was entirely sack'd and plunder'd; and the innocent <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants Houses miserably plundered of an immense Treasure, contrary to the QUEEN's Design; and indeed by a base Violence of in∣ferior Generals, presuming on the Ea∣siness and good Temper of their Gene∣ral: This is well known to most Men, as well as it is, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so far from being brought to favour the Design of the <HI>English</HI> after that, as was expected, that they for ever after hat∣ed us; and omitted no Occasion of shewing the most implacable Aversion to the <HI>English</HI> Nation; and even to King <HI>Charles</HI> III. for our sakes, as was possible; and which never abated till the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> where they paid us Home for it; neither did it abate then inso∣much that it was thought fit afterwards to act in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> rather with <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
or indeed with any Nation's Troops, than with <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>This was what we may call the Effect of what some call a good-natur'd Gen∣tleman; which, in a Soldier, may some∣times be fatal, and deserve a meaner Title.</P>
<P>It is true, Fortune remembred the Duke in the same Voyage, and kindly made him a Present of the <HI>Vigo</HI> Fleet; with the Conquest of which, coming fresh grown with Laurels, the People, who thought he had brought much more Money than he did, shouted him through the Streets, with infinite Acclamations; and indeed had his Grace had more Soldiers, and fewer Thieves in his Army, that had been a happy Voyage for <HI>England,</HI> equal to that of Sir <HI>Francis Drake:</HI> But alas! never was so much lost, and so little got, as by that Voyage; the great Disaster whereof is, by some, said to be owing to the easy Temper of the General, who having no Value for Money himself, seem'd al∣most entirely to forget, of what Use it was to his Country; or that there were some at Home, who knew how to em∣ploy it, though, perhaps, he did not.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
From this Time his late Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> ap∣pear'd very little in the Field, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> en∣joy'd the full Benefits of Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the midst of a bloody War, having the Pro∣fits heap'd upon him of many advan∣tageous Posts; such as that of the first Troop of Horse-Guards, Lord Lieu∣tenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the like; all which, his natural Profusion remaining to him, have been so ill able to supply him, that, added to his own Estate, they have been far from preserving him from an immense Debt; which, it is believ'd, exceeds all that any <HI>English</HI> Nobleman has contracted within the Memory of Man, the old Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>It is not my Design to load the Per∣son of the late Duke with Reflections, at a Time when he is already under the Resentment of the Parliament and People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> fled his Country, and attainted of Treason; and for this Reason, I forbear to enter into any Part of his History, during his late general Command of the Army under the Queen; nor is it needful, the Applica∣tion of the present Discourse turning upon another Point, and rather respect∣ing
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>; and the Question which occurs from all that has been said, is properly directed to them, to enquire what there has been in all the History of this late Noble Person, that entitles him to the Affection of the common People, or that should make him be beloved; much less that should set him up to be the Idol of the Mob, and to have his Health drunk in a Sort of Opposition to the King's, as the weak and unthinking People have been taught to do.</P>
<P>And it is very well worth Observati∣on, that if you ask one of the best in∣formed among the common People; What it is they admire the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> for? What are his Virtues? what have been the Particulars of his Life? They have little to say; nothing but that he is a good natur'd, generous, free-hearted Man; so that, in a few Words, to spend a Man's Estate, with∣out Forecast, without Bounds, and in a Manner which no prudent Man can do, is the true Way to be admir'd, and the most egregious Folly the Foundation of Popularity.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44"/>
But is it a Virtue to squander away immense Sums of Money? Is spending a great Estate a valuable thing, and fit to recommend a Man to the Esteem of the People of <HI>England?</HI> Why then none but Beggars must be the Peoples Favourites; and to have a great Multitude of Creditors, is to become truly popular. I cannot see upon what Foundation such Men can claim the Favour of the People; but what the Inhabitants of the <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Mint</HI> have as good a Title to, in their Proportion; and it is a most unanswer∣able Reflexion upon the Judgment of our People, and the Methods they take to place their particular Favours, that they are guided by those Accomplish∣ments in the Persons admired, which only tend to Vice and Degeneracy; and that they are best pleased with that which ought to destroy, not attract their Affection. It is true, that ge∣nerous Principles, and a bountiful, open Hand, justly recommends a noble Person to our good Opinion; especially when selfish, narrow Principles are grown so general in the World; but, in my O∣pinion, a Man ceases to be generous, that is open to Profusion; and he that
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
can set no Bounds to his Bounty, in∣stead of being a wise Man, may rather be said to squander away his Money like a Fool; a Man of Honour ought to know the Value of what he bestows, and of what he expends; otherwise he becomes bountiful to a Vice, and throws away his Money, not for want of Avarice, but for want of Under∣standing.</P>
<P>And for what can this be said to re∣commend him; unless he shall be said to become popular, meerly on the same Account that the People fall into Rabbles and Tumults; not because they are wise, but because they are mad.</P>
<P>It is Time for the People of <HI>En∣gland</HI> then to consider the particular Case; and if they will not remove their Acclamations, and Cry of Tu∣mult, from the Person of the Duke; yet, for their own Reputation, let them remove it from his Vice, and find out some of his Virtues to fix it upon; for certainly a meer making Ducks and Drakes of his Money, can∣not recommend him; or if it does, it
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
must be only to those, who can give no Reason for what they do.</P>
<P>It has been alledged by some, that this Popularity of the Duke's has risen from the Accident of Circumstances; and that it has not been at all of the Duke's seeking or desiring, or from any greater Esteem than was before shewn him; but because the Party, who have, of late, shewn themselves Opposers of the Government, and of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> had no Body else to name to the Mobb, who they durst mention in publick.</P>
<P>If this should be true, the Duke has very little Obligation to those People; and, moreover, it is the severest Satyr upon the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest, that it could be possible to mention; being a clear Testimony, that their <HI>Pre∣tender</HI> has no Share in the Affections of the People; and that they could hope for no Favour among the Com∣mons, if they did so much as name him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, That, first, as the Duke has no peculiar Ac∣complishments of his own, which can be said to recommend him to the
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
Mobb; so all that has been done to render him popular, has been done not only without any personal Merit of his own; but, which is worse, from a private Piece of Policy, making him a Cover to their <HI>Jacobite</HI> Design, and no better than a meer Tool for the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
