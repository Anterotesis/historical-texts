<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following Poem was wrote several Years ago: As
it may do good to some, and cannot hurt the Re∣putation
of the Author, though he should be known,
I have given it to my Bookseller to publish. It con∣tains
some Thoughts of Monsieur <HI>Pascal,</HI> which can∣not
make it less acceptable to the Publick.</P>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT am I? how produc'd? and for what End?</L>
<L>Whence drew I Being? to what Period
tend?</L>
<L>Am I th' abandon'd Orphan of blind Chance;</L>
<L>Dropt by wild Atoms, in disorder'd Dance?</L>
<L>Or from an endless Chain of Causes wrought?</L>
<L>And of unthinking Substance, born with Thought?</L>
<L>By Motion which began without a Cause,</L>
<L>Supremely wise, without Design, or Laws.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Am I but what I seem, mere Flesh and Blood;</L>
<L>A branching Channel, with a mazy Flood?</L>
<L>The purple Stream that through my Vessels glides,</L>
<L>Dull and unconscious flows like common Tides:</L>
<L>The Pipes thro' which the circling Juices stray,</L>
<L>Are not that thinking I, no more than They:</L>
<L>This Frame, compacted with transcendent Skill,</L>
<L>Of moving Joints, obedient to my Will;</L>
<L>Nurs'd from the fruitful Glebe, like yonder Tree,</L>
<L>Waxes and wastes; I call it Mine, not Me:</L>
<L>New Matter still the mould'ring Mass sustains,</L>
<L>The Mansion chang'd, the Tenant still remains;</L>
<L>And from the fleeting Stream repair'd by Food,</L>
<L>Distinct, as is the Swimmer from the Flood.</L>
<L>What am I then? Sure, of a nobler Birth,</L>
<L>Thy Parents Right, I own a Mother, <HI>Earth</HI>;</L>
<L>But claim superior Lineage by my SIRE,</L>
<L>Who warm'd th' unthinking Clod with heav'nly Fire:</L>
<L>Essence divine, with lifeless Clay allay'd,</L>
<L>By double Nature, double Instinct sway'd;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
With Look erect, I dart my longing Eye,</L>
<L>Seem wing'd to part, and gain my native Sky;</L>
<L>I strive to mount, but strive, alas! in vain,</L>
<L>Ty'd to this massy Globe with magick Chain.</L>
<L>Now with swift Thought I range from Pole to Pole</L>
<L>View Worlds around their flaming Centers roll:</L>
<L>What steddy Powers their endless Motions guide,</L>
<L>Thro' the same tractless Paths of boundless Void!</L>
<L>I trace the blazing Comet's fiery Trail,</L>
<L>And weigh the whirling Planets in a Scale:</L>
<L>These Godlike Thoughts, while eager I pursue,</L>
<L>Some glitt'ring Trifle offer'd to my view,</L>
<L>A Gnat, an Insect, of the meanest kind,</L>
<L>Erase the new-born Image from my Mind;</L>
<L>Some beastly Want, craving, importunate,</L>
<L>Vile as the grinning Mastiffs at my Gate,</L>
<L>Calls off from heav'nly Truth this reas'ning Me,</L>
<L>And tells me I'm a Brute as much as He.</L>
<L>If on sublimer Wings of Love and Praise,</L>
<L>My Soul above the starry Vault I raise,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Lur'd by some vain Conceit, or shameful Lust,</L>
<L>I flag, I drop, and flutter in the Dust.</L>
<L>The tow'ring Lark, thus, from her lofty Strain,</L>
<L>Stoops to an Emmet, or a Barley Grain.</L>
<L>By adverse Gusts of jarring Instincts tost,</L>
<L>I rove to one, now to the other Coast;</L>
<L>To Bliss unknown my lofty Soul aspires,</L>
<L>My Lot unequal to my vast Desires.</L>
<L>As 'mongst the Hinds a Child of Royal Birth</L>
<L>Finds his high Pedigree, by conscious Worth;</L>
<L>So Man, amongst his Fellow-Brutes expos'd,</L>
<L>Sees he's a King, but 'tis a King depos'd:</L>
<L>Pity him, Beasts! you by no Law confin'd,</L>
<L>Are barr'd from devious Paths, by being blind;</L>
<L>Whilst Man, through op'ning Views of various Ways</L>
<L>Confounded, by the Aid of Knowledge, strays;</L>
<L>Too weak to choose, yet choosing still in haste,</L>
<L>One Moment gives the Pleasure and Distaste;</L>
<L>Bilk'd by past Minutes, while the present cloy,</L>
<L>The flatt'ring future still must give the Joy.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Not happy, but amus'd upon the Road,</L>
<L>And (like you) thoughtless of his last Abode,</L>
<L>Whether next Sun his Being shall restrain,</L>
<L>To endless Nothing, Happiness, or Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around me, lo, the thinking, thoughtless Crew</L>
<L>(Bewilder'd each) their diff'rent Paths pursue;</L>
<L>Of them I ask the Way; the first replies,</L>
<L>Thou art a God; and sends me to the Skies.</L>
<L>Down on this Turf (the next) thou two-legg'd Beast,</L>
<L>There fix thy Lot, thy Bliss, and endless Rest:</L>
<L>Between those wide Extremes the length is such,</L>
<L>I find I know too little or too much.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Almighty Pow'r, by whose most wise Command,</L>
<L>" Helpless, forlorn, uncertain here I stand;</L>
<L>" Take this faint Glimmering of thy self away,</L>
<L>" Or break into my Soul with perfect Day!"</L>
<L>This said, expanded lay the sacred Text,</L>
<L>The Balm, the Light, the Guide of Souls perplext:</L>
<L>Thus the benighted Traveller that strays</L>
<L>Through doubtful Paths, enjoys the Morning Rays;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
The nightly Mist, and thick descending Dew,</L>
<L>Parting, unfold the Fields, and vaulted Blue.</L>
<L>" O Truth divine! enlightned by thy Ray,</L>
<L>" I grope and guess no more, but see my way;</L>
<L>" Thou cleardst the Secret of my high Descent,</L>
<L>And told me what those mystick Tokens meant;</L>
<L>Marks of my Birth, which I had worn in vain,</L>
<L>Too hard for worldly Sages to explain;</L>
<L><HI>Zeno</HI>'s were vain, vain <HI>Epicurus</HI>' Schemes,</L>
<L>Their Systems false, delusive were their Dreams;</L>
<L>Unskill'd my two-fold Nature to divide,</L>
<L>One nurs'd my Pleasure, and one nurs'd my Pride:</L>
<L>Those jarring Truths which Human Art beguile,</L>
<L>Thy sacred Page thus bid me reconcile.</L>
<L>Offspring of God, no less thy Pedigree,</L>
<L>What thou once wer't, art now, and still may be,</L>
<L>Thy God alone can tell, alone decree;</L>
<L>Faultless thou dropt from his unerring Skill,</L>
<L>With the bare Pow'r to sin, since free of Will:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Yet charge not with thy Guilt, his bounteous Love,</L>
<L>For who has Power to walk, has Power to rove;</L>
<L>Who acts by force impell'd, can nought deserve;</L>
<L>And Wisdom short of infinite, may swerve.</L>
<L>Born on thy new-imp'd Wings, thou took'st thy Flight,</L>
<L>Left thy Creator, and the Realms of Light;</L>
<L>Disdain'd his gentle Precept to fulfil;</L>
<L>And thought to grow a God by doing ill:</L>
<L>Though by foul Guilt thy heav'nly Form defac'd,</L>
<L>In Nature chang'd, from happy Mansions chac'd,</L>
<L>Thou still retain'st some Sparks of heav'nly Fire,</L>
<L>Too faint to mount, yet restless to aspire;</L>
<L>Angel enough to seek thy Bliss again,</L>
<L>And Brute enough to make the Search in vain.</L>
<L>The Creatures now withdraw their kindly Use,</L>
<L>Some fly thee, some torment, and some seduce;</L>
<L>Repast ill suited to such diff'rent Guests,</L>
<L>For what thy Sense desires, thy Soul distastes;</L>
<L>Thy Lust, thy Curiosity, thy Pride,</L>
<L>Curb'd, or deferr'd, or balk'd, or gratify'd,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Rage on, and make thee equally unbless'd</L>
<L>In what thou want'st, and what thou hast possest;</L>
<L>In vain thou hop'st for Bliss on this poor Clod,</L>
<L>Return, and seek thy Father, and thy God:</L>
<L>Yet think not to regain thy native Sky,</L>
<L>Born on the Wings of vain Philosophy;</L>
<L>Mysterious Passage! hid from human Eyes;</L>
<L>Soaring you'll sink, and sinking you will rise:</L>
<L>Let humble Thoughts thy wary Footsteps guide,</L>
<L>Regain by Meekness what you lost by Pride.</L>
