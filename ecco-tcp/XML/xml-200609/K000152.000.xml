<HEAD>PROLOGUE
TO THE
COURT;
On the QUEEN's Birth-Day, 1704.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Happy Muse to this high Scene preferr'd,</L>
<L>Hereafter shall in Loftier Strains be heard;</L>
<L>And, soaring to transcend her usual Theme,</L>
<L>Shall Sing of Virtue and Heroick Fame.</L>
<L>No longer shall she Toil upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And fruitless War with Vice and Folly wage;</L>
<L>No more in mean Disguise she shall appear,</L>
<L>And Shapes she would reform be forc'd to wear:</L>
<L>While Ignorance and Malice join to blame,</L>
<L>And break the Mirror that reflects their Shame.</L>
<L>Henceforth she shall pursue a Nobler Task,</L>
<L>Shew her bright Virgin Face, and scorn the Satyr's Mask.</L>
<L>Happy her future Days! which are design'd</L>
<L>Alone to Paint the Beauties of the Mind.</L>
<L>By Just Originals to draw with Care,</L>
<L>And Copy from the Court a Faultless Fair:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2"/>Such Labours with Success her Hopes may crown,</L>
<L>And shame to Manners an incorrigible Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While this Design her eager Thought pursues,</L>
<L>Such various Virtues all around she views,</L>
<L>She knows not where to fix, or which to chuse.</L>
<L>Yet still ambitious of the daring Flight,</L>
<L>ONE only awes her with Superior Light.</L>
<L>From that Attempt the Conscious Muse retires,</L>
<L>Nor to Inimitable Worth aspires;</L>
<L>But secretly Applauds, and silently Admires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence she reflects upon the genial Ray</L>
<L>That first enliven'd this Auspicious Day:</L>
<L>On that Bright Star, to whose Indulgent Pow'r</L>
<L>We owe the Blessings of the Present Hour.</L>
<L>Concurring Omens of propitious Fate</L>
<L>Bore, with One Sacred Birth, an equal Date;</L>
<L>Whence we derive whatever we possess,</L>
<L>By Foreign Conquest, or Domestick Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, <HI>Britain,</HI> then thy Dawn of Bliss begun!</L>
<L>Then broke the Morn that lighted up this Sun!</L>
<L>Then was it doom'd whose Councils should succeed;</L>
<L>And by whose Arm the Christian World be freed;</L>
<L>Then the fierce Foe was pre-ordain'd to yield,</L>
<L>And then the Battel won at BLENHEIM'S Glorious Field.</L>
