<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE great Honour Your Majesty has done me, in giving me leave to prefix Your Royal Name to the following Poems, does not encourage me to presume they are worthy to be laid at Your Feet on any other account, but only as they are an hum∣ble

Tribute of Duty, offer'd from a thankful Heart to a gracious Benefactress. Your Ma∣jesty has indeed the same Right to them, as You have to the Fruits of a Tree, which You have transplanted out of a barren Soil into a fertile and beautiful Garden. It was Your Generosity which brought me out of Obscu∣rity, and still condescends to protect me; like the Supreme Being, who continually sup∣ports the meanest Creature, which his Good∣ness has produc'd.</P>
<P>I have Room here to expatiate upon a very inviting Subject; but Your Majesty has nobly prevented all Panegyric, even from the best Pens, by building Your <HI>Fame</HI> on a much more lasting Basis, than that of <HI>Praise</HI> in <HI>Dedications.</HI> Your Encouragements of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> Your Esteem and Friendship for all Defenders of Truth, while they are living,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
the Regard You pay to their Memories when dead, and Your generous Care of their Wi∣dows and Orphans, record Your Virtues in such Characters as will ever be legible. Your Christian Love to Mankind, Your zealous Endeavours to promote <HI>Religion,</HI> a Soul made tender to feel our Misfortunes, and a Will inclin'd to redress them, are such ami∣able and heavenly Qualities, as shine best by their own Light, and can receive no new Lustre from the finest Description.</P>
<P>MAY Heaven long preserve Your Majesty to practise all these Virtues, to be a perpetual Source of Comfort and Joy to our glorious Monarch, a Blessing to the Nation, and a noble Pattern of Beneficence and Generosity to future Queens. Your Majesty's great Goodness to myself draws this Prayer from a Heart fill'd with Gratitude. As there is so

little Merit in what You now honour with Your Royal Protection, I shall endeavour to supply the Defects, the only way that is in my Power, by my Thanks, and Prayers for Your Majesty: <HI>These</HI> I will ever continue, and always make it my greatest Ambition to shew with what profound Respect I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT I propose in this Preface, is only to bespeak the Reader's Good-nature, and to say some∣thing which may incline him to pardon what he cannot com∣mend. I have indeed but a poor Defence to make for the Things I have wrote: I don't think them good, and better Judges will doubtless think worse of them than I do. Only this, I believe, I may say of them, That, if they have nothing to delight those who may
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
chance to read them, they have nothing to give Modesty a Blush; if nothing to entertain and improve the Mind, they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Motive, that I hope may in∣duce the Reader to overlook the Defects in this Volume, is, That the oldest Poem in it is little more than six Years of Age; and a considerable Part of the Time since that was writ, has been spent in endeavouring to learn a Language, of which I was then intirely ignorant; tho' I fear, the few Attempts I have made in Translations, will too well convince the Public, to how little Purpose I have employ'd my Time. I confess myself guilty of a great Presumption in publish∣ing Imitations of <HI>HORACE,</HI> when many eminent Hands have done it much better before me: But when I was only endeavouring to understand him, I found it difficult to conquer a Temptation I had to imitate some of his Thoughts, which mightily pleas'd me. If I may be forgiven this Experiment, I promise to trouble the World with nothing of this Nature again, at least, till I may be able to do my Author more Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
I have not myself been so fond of writing, as might be imagin'd from seeing so many Things of mine as are got together in this Book. Se∣veral of them are on Subjects that were given me by Persons, to whom I have such great Ob∣ligations, that I always thought their Desires Commands. My want of <HI>Education</HI> will be too evident from them, for me to mention it here: And I hope, when the Reader weighs my Performances, he will put <HI>that,</HI> and other Disadvantages into the Scale.</P>
<P>I am afraid, the Letter relating to myself, wrote by a worthy and learned Gentleman, will be thought an improper Thing in a Publication made by myself: But, as I was desir'd to prefix it, by Persons whom I think it an Honour to obey, I hope it will be pardon'd; and the rather, because a very false Account had been publish'd before, by a Person who seems to have had as little Regard for Truth, as he had for Honesty, when he stole my Poems.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>
I would willingly here make known my Obli∣gations to those worthy Persons who first took notice of me in the midst of <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>La∣bour,</HI> were I not afraid, my Gratitude, thus publicly express'd, would offend them more than my Silence. However, I must beg leave to re∣turn my Thanks to a Reverend Gentleman of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and to another of <HI>Winchester:</HI> The former made my Life more comfortable, as soon as he knew me; the latter, after giving me several Testimonies of his Bounty and Good∣ness, presented my first Essays to a Lady of Quality, attending on the Queen, who made my low Circumstances known to Her <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>I hope too, that all those Honourable Per∣sons, whose <HI>Names</HI> do me so much Credit at the Beginning of my Book, will accept my Ac∣knowledgments and Thanks for so liberal a Subscription: And as this Volume, I fear, will tell them, they have not encourag'd a Poet, I will endeavour to let them see they have been generous to an honest Man.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR, In a LETTER to a FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Written in the Year <DATE>1730.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Don't wonder that you should desire so distinct an Account, how <HI>Stephen Duck</HI> came to write Verses, and how he manag'd in writing them. Philosophers find as much Subject for their Admiration in the minutest Bodies, as in the largest; and a Poet from the Barn, tho' not so great a Man, is as great a Curiosity, as a Dictator from the Plow. I can be particular enough as to his first setting out in Poetry; and, since you seem to desire it, shall give you all the Cir∣cumstances I could learn from a Week's Conversation with him in all his Simplicity; without considering, that many of them, to a Person less curi∣ous, might appear too trifling to be mention'd even in a Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
MY Friend <HI>Stephen</HI> had originally no other Teaching, than what enabled him to read, and write <HI>English</HI>; he had never taken a single Step toward any other Language. As Arithmetic is generally join'd with this Degree of Learning, he had a little Share of that too. About his Fourteenth Year he was taken from School, and was afterwards successively engag'd in the se∣veral lowest Employments of a Country Life. This lasted for some Years; so long, that he had forgot almost all the Arithmetic he had learn'd at School: However he read sometimes, and thought oftener. He had a cer∣tain Longing after Knowledge; and when he reflected within himself on his want of Education, he began to be particularly uneasy, that he should have forgot something of what he had learnt, even at the little School he had been at. He thought of this so often, that at last he resolv'd to try his own Strength; and, if possible, to recover his Arithmetic again.</P>
<P>HIS first Attempt of this kind I take to have been about Six Years ago. Considering the Difficulties the poor Fellow lay under, this Inclination for Knowledge must have been very strong in him. He was then marry'd, and at Service; he had little Time to spare; he had no Books, and no Money to get any: But he was resolv'd to go thro' with it; and accordingly us'd to work more than other Day-labourers, and by that means got some little matter added to his Pay. This Overplus was at his own Disposal. With this he bought first a Book of Vulgar Arithmetic, then one of Decimal, and a third of Measuring of Land; all which by degrees he made himself a to∣lerable Master of, in those Hours he could steal from his Sleep, after the Labours of the Day.</P>
<P>WHERE there was such a Desire for Knowledge, there must be good Sense at bottom, and a Soul, at least, somewhat above the common Con∣versation he must meet with in his poor State of Life. I have ask'd him, whom he had that he could talk and converse with in the Country; and was pleas'd to find him, in this Particular, happier than I expected. He said, he had one dear Friend, that he mention'd with uncommon Affection. They us'd to talk and read together, when they could steal a little Time for it. This Friend had been in a Service at <HI>London</HI> for two or three Years: He had an Inclination to Books; he had purchas'd some, and brought 'em down with him into the Country; and <HI>Stephen</HI> had always the Use of his little Library; which by this Time, possibly, may be increas'd to two or three dozen of Books. This Friend knew no more out of <HI>English</HI> than <HI>Stephen</HI>; but by talking together they mutually improv'd each other. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
is all Simplicity: He says, <Q REND="inline">"That his Friend can talk better than he, as having been more us'd to Company; but that he himself has been more us'd to Poetry, and in that can do better than his Friend."</Q></P>
<P>HAD it not been for this, <HI>Stephen</HI> must have been plac'd in the same Class with <HI>Hai Ebn Yokdhan,</HI> and the young <HI>Hermes</HI> in Mr. <HI>Ramsay</HI>'s <HI>Cyrus:</HI> But the Story of their Improvements without any Assistance agrees only with Romances; and you know, what I am writing to you is a true History. Our retir'd Philosopher had his Friend; and it seems to have been the greatest Happiness of his Life, that he had one. They did not only read, but reason'd over Points together; and I have sometimes thought, how agreeable a thing it would have been, to have been conceal'd within hearing of them, when they were in the midst of some of their most knotty Debates. We may imagine 'em both to have had good natural Sense, and a few good Books in common between 'em: Their Minds were their own; neither improv'd, nor spoil'd, by laying in a Stock of Learning: They were perhaps equally well inclin'd to learn, both struggling for a little Knowledge; and, like a Couple of Rowers on the same Bottom, while they were only striving perhaps, which should out do his Companion, they were really each helping the other, and driving the Boat on the faster.</P>
<P>PERHAPS you would be willing to know what Books their little Library consisted of. I need not mention those of Arithmetic again, nor his Bible: <HI>Milton,</HI> the <HI>Spectators,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> were his first Favourites; <HI>Telemachus,</HI> with another Piece by the same Hand, and <HI>Addison</HI>'s Defence of Christia∣nity, his next. They had an <HI>English</HI> Dictionary, and a sort of <HI>English</HI> Grammar, an <HI>Ovid</HI> of long Standing with them, and a <HI>Bysshe</HI>'s Art of Po∣etry of later Acquisition: <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Morals had made the Name of <HI>L'Estrange</HI> dear to them; and, as I imagine, might occasion their getting his <HI>Josephus</HI> in Folio, which was the largest Purchace in their Collection: They had one Volume of <HI>Shakespear</HI> with Seven of his Plays in it. Beside these, <HI>Stephen</HI> had read Three or Four other Plays; some of <HI>Epictetus, Waller, Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil, Prior, Hudibras, Tom Brown,</HI> and the <HI>London Spy.</HI> You may see I am a faithful Historian, by my giving you the Bad with the Good.</P>
<P>WITH these Helps <HI>Stephen</HI> is grown something of a Poet, and some∣thing of a Philosopher. I find by him, that from his Infancy, he has had a Cast in his Mind toward Poetry. He has delighted, as far back as he can remember, in Verses, and in Singing. He speaks of strange Emotions, that he has felt on the top Performances of the little Choir of Songsters in

a Country Chancel; and mentions his first hearing of an Organ, as a re∣markable Epocha of his Life. He seems to be a pretty good Judge too of a musical Line; but I imagine, that he does not hear Verses in his own Mind, as he repeats them. I don't know whether you understand me. I mean, that his Ideas of the Notes in a Verse, and his Manner of repeating the same Verse, are often different: For he points out an harmonious Line well enough; and yet he generally spoils its Harmony by his way of speaking it.</P>
<P>WHAT first gave him a higher Taste of Poetry, than he had been us'd to, was <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradise Lost.</HI> This came oddly enough into his Hands; and when I see you, I'll tell you the History of it. <HI>Stephen</HI> read it over twice or thrice with a Dictionary, before he could understand the Language of it thoroughly. This, and a sort of <HI>English</HI> Grammar they had, have been of the greatest Use to him of any thing.</P>
<P>INDEED it seems plain to me, that he has got <HI>English</HI> just as we get <HI>Latin.</HI> He study'd <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> as others study the Classics. The new Beauties in that Poem, that were continually opening upon his Mind, made all his Labour easy to him. He work'd all Day for his Master; and, after the Labour of the Day, set to his Books at Night. The Pains he has taken for the Pleasure of improving himself, are incredible; but it has answer'd too beyond what one could have expected; for he seems to understand some of the great and deeper Beauties of that Poem tolerably well; and points out several particular Beauties in it, which it requires a good nice Eye to discover.</P>
<P>'TWAS his Friend that help'd him to the <HI>Spectators</HI>; they read them often together, and often by themselves. <HI>Stephen</HI> tells me, that he has frequently carry'd them with him to his Work. When he did so, his Method was to labour harder than any body else, that he might get half an Hour to read a <HI>Spectator,</HI> without injuring his Master. By this means he us'd to sit down all over Sweat and Heat, without regarding his own Health, and often to the Prejudice of it. If this affects you, as it has me, I ought not to pass it over, that you may not lose the Pleasure of so strong an Instance of Honesty and Industry mix'd together.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spectators</HI> improv'd his Understanding, he says, more than any thing. The Copies of Verses, scatter'd in those Pieces, help'd on his natural Bent that way; and made him willing to try, whether he could not do something like 'em. He sometimes turn'd his own Thoughts into Verse, while he
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
was at Work; and at last begun to venture those Thoughts a little on Paper. What he did of this kind, was very inconsiderable; only scatter'd Thoughts, and generally not above four or five Lines on the same Subject; which, as there was nobody thereabouts that car'd for Verses, nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad, he generally flung into the Fire, as soon as he had pleas'd himself enough in reading them.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Care he took to burn these little Pieces, he found it not sufficient to conceal them. The Thing took Air; and <HI>Stephen,</HI> who had before the Name of a Scholar among the Country People, was said now to be able to write Verses too. This was mention'd accidentally, about a Year ago, before a young Gentleman of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who sent for <HI>Stephen</HI>; and after some Talk with him, desir'd him to write him a Letter in Verse. That Letter is the Epistle which stands the last in his Poems, but was the first whole Copy of Verses that ever he wrote. This happen'd to fall into the Hands of some Clergymen in the Neighbourhood, who were very well pleas'd with it; and upon examining him, found the Man had a good deal of Merit. They gave him some Presents, which, as Things stood then, were a great Help to him; and encourag'd him to go on as much as they could.</P>
<P>THIS made him proceed with more Courage: And, as he had wrote some scatter'd Verses on <HI>Poverty,</HI> before this happen'd, he carry'd those Thoughts on, and fill'd it up, as it stands at present in the printed Collection I send you: So that this is his second Copy. I am very careful in settling the Chronology of his Poems, that you may see how he has gone on Step by Step, if you please.</P>
<P>THE Composition which was next in Order, is that on his own <HI>Labours:</HI> That Subject was given him by one of those who first encourag'd him; and after this was finish'd, he was employ'd from the same Quarter in his <HI>Shunammite.</HI> As this exceeded any of the rest, I think from hence we may date the Aera of his rising in his Character and Circumstances. Upon this it was that Per∣sons of Distinction began to send for him different ways. In short, it got him Fame enough to be pretty trouble some to him at first; tho' it is likely to end in a much happier Settlement of him and his Affairs, than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his first setting out.</P>
<P>WHEN you have read his Poems, and consider the Manner he has been bred up in, I doubt not you will think they have their Merit: But I assure you, they give an imperfect Idea of the Man; and, to know how much he de∣serves,
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>
one should converse with him, and hear on what Reasons he omitted such a Part, and introduc'd another; why he shortens his Style in this Place, and enlarges in that; whence he has such a Word, and whence such an Idea. I'll give you all I can recollect of this kind, in relation to what is generally reckon'd the best Thing he has wrote, <HI>The Shunammite.</HI></P>
<P>IN the first Place, I found upon Inquiry, that he wrote by a Plan; he thought over all the Parts, as he intended to use them, before he made the Verses. For a Poem of any Length, no doubt 'tis as necessary to do this, as it is to have a Draught of a House, before you go to building it; and yet I believe, the common Run of our Poets have generally thought themselves above it, or not thought of it at all. Tho' the <HI>Shunammite</HI> was written on a Story given to his hand, still something of this kind was convenient enough; because, in forming it anew, he did not make use of all the Materials before him, and has brought in some of his own. He thought, the Stretching of the Prophet in so particular a manner, must sound strange. The Woman introduc'd to tell her Story, is a new Cast of his own; so is her Doubting, and then Confirming herself again, by a particular Induction of all <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Miracles; so the Bringing an Audience about her, and their Chorus's, when they join together in congratulating her Happiness; the last of which closes the Poem in a good proper manner.</P>
<P>UPON being ask'd, Why he introduc'd a Person to tell all the Story in the <HI>Shunammite,</HI> and why he could not as well tell it himself; he said, he had read <HI>Prior</HI>'s <HI>Solomon</HI>; and that, in reading it, <HI>Solomon</HI>'s speaking every thing touch'd him particularly. He was then ask'd, since it was to be spoken, why he did not rather chuse the Prophet, as the Person of the greater Dig∣nity, to speak it. He said to this, That the Woman was to be pity'd; That there seem'd to him to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Such as these:
<Q>Ver. 16. And she said; Nay, my Lord, thou Man of God, do not tye unto thy Handmaid.</Q><Q>Ver. 28. Did I desire a Son of my Lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</Q></NOTE>some Expressions of the Woman in the History, which, if not omitted, might lessen our Regard and Compassion for her; That, if the Prophet had related the Thing, he could not have omitted a Word; but when the Woman did, she might well be allow'd to soften her own Case; and to drop, when she was cool, any thing wrong, that she had said in the Violence of her Grief and Passion. This is rather fuller in Words than he express'd it; but nothing, I think, is added to his Meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>
AS <HI>Milton</HI> had been his favourite Poet, you may wonder why none of his Pieces are in blank Verse. I ask'd him about this too: Upon which he told me, That he had originally written the whole <HI>Shunammite</HI> in blank Verse; That, upon reading it over, he found his Language was not sublime enough for it; and that therefore he was forc'd to write it all over again, and turn it into Rhyme.</P>
<P>UPON reading over the Chapter and his Poem together, you will see how justly he shortens and enlarges some of the particular Passages, in order to adapt them the more to Poetry. Besides some Things already mention'd, he drops several little Circumstances in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 2 Kings, Chap. iv. Verses 10, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, and 35.</NOTE>. On the other hand, he enlarges on the <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Line 33 to 49.</NOTE>Contentedness and Charities of the Woman; on the <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">55, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>Look and Attitude of the Prophet; on her <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Thanks for bearing a Son; on <NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">112 to 134.</NOTE>the Death of the Child; on the <NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">152, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See 205.</NOTE>Reasons of her Confidence in the Prophet; in <NOTE N="6" PLACE="marg">211.</NOTE>pointing out the Prophet, when she comes to him; and in <NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">219.</NOTE>his Answer; in her <NOTE N="8" PLACE="marg">232.</NOTE>pressing the Prophet more earnestly to assist her; in <NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg">246.</NOTE>pointing out the dead Child; his being <NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">258.</NOTE>freed from Death; and her Thoughts <NOTE N="11" PLACE="marg">266.</NOTE>upon receiving him again into her Arms.</P>
<P>'TIS agreeable to see what Use he has made of the little Reading he can have had, and how he has improv'd the Thing, by observing some good Strokes in the Books he has met with. Upon my telling him, that I lik'd nothing better in it, than his altering <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">From Line 55 to 63.</NOTE>the Prophet's Countenance as he does; he said, he took that Hint from <HI>Telemachus</HI>; where the young Prince comes to <HI>Idomeneus</HI>'s Court, while they are sacrificing. The Priest, on seeing <HI>Telemachus,</HI> breaks off from what he was about, assumes a more inspir'd Air, and begins speaking of his future Fortunes. This Alteration of the Prophet's Countenance, <HI>Stephen</HI> says, he took from thence; but that at the same time he thought himself oblig'd to drop the Wildness and Enthusiasm of it, in order to adapt it more to the Nature of a true Prophet.</P>
<P>THE Chorus in the Close of the <HI>Shunammite,</HI> he said, was brought into his Mind by the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg"><HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> Book 7. Line 565, and 602.</NOTE>general Rejoicing of the Angels in <HI>Milton,</HI> upon God's
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>
finishing the Creation of the World. The first Chorus was not in the Work originally; he inserted it, when he new-form'd it all into Rhyme.</P>
<P>HE had also been very careful as to single Words; and had Authorities to produce in several little Particulars, where one would not expect it. For <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Shunammite,</HI> Ver. 210.</NOTE><HI>flow'ry Carmel,</HI> he quotes Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>; and the Prophet's Arbour on the Top of that Mount is cover'd with <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">212.</NOTE><HI>Vines,</HI> on the Authority of Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> in his Travels: For the Words <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">177, and 249.</NOTE><HI>adust</HI> and <HI>supernal,</HI> he refers to <HI>Milton:</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE><HI>Fanatic</HI> he uses according to the true, and not the vulgar Sense of the Word; he had learn'd the proper Meaning of it from his Dictionary: <NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">143.</NOTE><HI>Dilated Heart,</HI> as spoken of Sorrow, is certainly a Fault; but it is a Fault that <HI>Stephen</HI> was naturally enough led into by the common Notion and Expressions in the Country, of the Heart's <HI>swelling</HI> and being ready to <HI>burst</HI> with Grief.</P>
<P>HE owns his Faults very readily; and if he thinks a Line of his better than ordinary, he will say so without any Reserve. He seems to be exceedingly open and honest in every thing he says; and 'twould be very difficult for you to be with him a Week, as I have been, without going away very much his Friend.</P>
<P>THO' I have been so long in shewing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own Works; I shall add some of his Thoughts on the Works of others, to give you as full an Idea of him as I can.</P>
<P>'TIS not yet three Years ago that he first met with <HI>Milton</HI>; and I believe, that was the first Poet of real Value, that he ever study'd in earnest. He has assur'd me, with all his Innocence and Simplicity, that when he came after∣wards to read <HI>Addison</HI>'s Criticisms on <HI>Milton</HI> in the <HI>Spectators,</HI> 'twas a high Pleasure to him to find many Things mention'd there, in the Praise of <HI>Milton,</HI> exactly as he had before thought in reading him. Here we must depend on his Credit, which I need not tell you with me is very good.</P>
<P>THE Name of <HI>Milton,</HI> whom he admires and dotes on so particularly, has not prevail'd on him enough to make him like his <HI>Paradise Regain'd.</HI> In speaking of these two Poems, he said, <Q REND="inline">"he wonder'd how <HI>Milton</HI> could write so incomparably well, where he had so little to lead him; and so very poorly, where he had more."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="20"/>
THE <HI>Spectators,</HI> you know, he has read with great Pleasure, and great Improvement. I remember particularly, that on somebody's calling them <HI>Prose,</HI> he said, <Q REND="inline">"'Twas true, they were <HI>Prose</HI>; but there was something in 'em, that pleas'd almost like <HI>Verse.</HI>"</Q>—He mention'd, with more Regard than usual, the critical Papers on Wit, those on <HI>Milton,</HI> the <HI>Justum &amp; tenacem</HI> from <HI>Horace,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Messiah,</HI> and the several scatter'd ones written in the Cause of Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>UPON asking him what Plays he had read, he nam'd particularly <HI>Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Cato, Venice Preserv'd,</HI> and <HI>the Orphan. Venice Pre∣serv'd,</HI> he said, gave him the most <HI>Horror</HI>; a Word which I took notice he us'd sometimes for Sorrow, and sometimes in its proper Sense: He could not bear the comic Parts in it. <HI>Hamlet</HI> he lik'd better than <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>; and in <HI>Hamlet</HI> pointed out that celebrated Speech, <HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> &amp;c. as having been his favourite Part, merely of his own Taste. He did not admire <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Comedy; and said, <Q REND="inline">"He was too high, and too low."</Q> I read over to him some of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the celebrated Speeches of <HI>Antony</HI> to the People in <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> He trembled, as I read the Ghost's Speech; and admir'd the Speeches and Turns in the Mob round <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Body, more, he said, than ever he had done before. As I was reading to him, I observ'd that his Countenance chang'd often in the most moving Parts: His Eye was quick and busy all the time; and, to say the Truth, I never saw Applause, or the shifting of proper Passions, appear so strongly in any Face as in his.</P>
<P>HE had formerly read <HI>Tom Brown</HI>'s <HI>Letters from the Dead,</HI> and the <HI>London Spy,</HI> not without some Pleasure; but, after he had been some time conversant with the <HI>Spectators,</HI> he said, <Q REND="inline">"He did not care much to look into them."</Q> He spoke of <HI>Hudibras</HI> in another manner; he saw a great deal of Wit in it, and was particularly pleas'd with the Conjurer's Part in that Poem: But, after all, 'tis not a Manner of writing that he can so sin∣cerely delight in, as in the Moral, the Passionate, or the Sublime.</P>
<P>INDEED what every body seems to admire him for, is, that he seems to have an excellent moral Turn in his Thoughts. He is, as I told you before, something of a Philosopher; and, what is better than a Philosopher, a good honest-hearted Man. He has read, and speaks highly of, the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Demonstration of the Being of a God, and Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Defence of the Christian Religion. He said, <Q REND="inline">"That they touch'd his Mind; and that nothing did so well, as when one's Reason is mov'd by what is said."</Q>
<PB N="xx" REF="21"/>
He had lik'd the little he had read of <HI>Epictetus</HI>; but 'twas <HI>Seneca</HI> that had made him happy in his own Mind. He seems as yet not to be hurt at all by any Applauses that have been given him, and to have been perfectly con∣tented with his Condition before: When he had only receiv'd some Pre∣sents from Gentlemen in the Country, he was quite easy as to his Circum∣stances. The only Thing then, that he was solicitous about, was, how he might succeed as to the Poetry he should be employ'd in. This was his chief Concern: But even this seem'd to proceed not so much from any Desire of Fame, as from a Principle of Gratitude; or, as he express'd it, his Longing to please those Friends that had been so generous to him. He was not lifted up with the Character some People gave him, and talk'd of Fame absolutely like a Philosopher. After his best Fortune, many of his Friends told him the Danger of being vain; and, if he should once be so, that he would be as much despis'd as he had been applauded. He said, <Q REND="inline">"That he could not well tell what they meant; That he did not know what it was to be vain: But, since so many great Men, who knew the World so much better than he did, were apprehensive for him on that head, he began to be terribly alarm'd at his Danger, tho' he had no settled Ideas of what it was."</Q> He was told upon this, That he should never speak too highly in Praise of the Poems he had written. He said, <Q REND="inline">"If that was all, he was safe; that was a Thing he could never do, for he could not think highly of them: Gentlemen indeed, he said, might like 'em, because they were made by a poor Fellow in a Barn; but that he knew, as well as any body, that they were not really good in themselves."</Q></P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I have obey'd your Commands as faithfully as I am able. You desir'd me not to spare Paper; but to send you a Book rather than a Letter. You see I have taken you at your Word; and that I am resolv'd, in this, as well as in every thing else, to shew you how punctually I would ever be,</P>

<L>Bribes the Unworthy with unhallow'd Praise;</L>
<L>No servile Flattery, nor dull Design,</L>
<L>Creeps, with soft Accent, thro' the fawning Line;</L>
<L>Nor jealous Envy rears its hateful Head,</L>
<L>To sting the Living, or revile the Dead;</L>
<L><PB N="xxxvii" REF="39"/>
Nor Malice, nor Caprice hast thou, like those,</L>
<L>Whose pointed Satire dares a thousand Foes:</L>
<L>(Not but, if Fops lay Snares for Ridicule,</L>
<L>And Smartlings think it Wit to play the Fool,</L>
<L>Indignant Satire has a just Pretence,</L>
<L>With all her Whips to lash them into Sense)</L>
<L>To please, and only please, thy Nature tends,</L>
<L>And, Friend to all Men, makes them all thy Friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH double Transport therefore I peruse</L>
<L>The genuine Truths of your untutor'd Muse;</L>
<L>While thus you teach us Friendship's sacred Law,</L>
<L>And are yourself the faithful Friend you draw.</L>
<L>So to those Priests we glad Attention give,</L>
<L>Whose Precepts Sanction from their Lives receive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS this that rais'd thee from thy lowly Seat,</L>
<L>'Tis this shall make thy Happiness complete;</L>
<L><PB N="xxxviii" REF="40"/>
A Soul sincere, to Gratitude inclin'd,</L>
<L>An Heart untainted, and an humble Mind.</L>
<L>Inspir'd by these, write on, and charm the Age,</L>
<L>Nor dread the envious Critic's idle Rage:</L>
<L>For who the snarling ZOILUS regards,</L>
<L>When SPENCE approves, and CAROLINE rewards?</L>

<HEAD>To a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who requested a Copy of <HI>Verses</HI> from the Author.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have, before the Time prescrib'd by you,</L>
<L>Expos'd my weak Production to your View,</L>
<L>Which may, I hope, have Pardon at your Hand,</L>
<L>Because produc'd to Light by your Com∣mand</L>
<L>Perhaps you might expect some finish'd Ode,</L>
<L>Or sacred Song, to sound the Praise of God;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="44"/>
A glorious Thought, and laudable! But then</L>
<L>Think what illit'rate Poet guides the Pen:</L>
<L>Ill suit such Tasks with one who holds the Plough,</L>
<L>Such lofty Subjects with a Fate so low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIR, were your Eloquence and Learning mine,</L>
<L>And I, like you, a Fav'rite of the Nine;</L>
<L>I quickly would <HI>Parnassus</HI>' Summit climb,</L>
<L>And find a Hero worthy of my Rhyme:</L>
<L>Nor should my Muse the <HI>Grecian</HI> Monarchs trace,</L>
<L>Nor would I celebrate the <HI>Trojan</HI> Race;</L>
<L>Nor any of those martial Sons of Fame,</L>
<L>Pagans, unworthy of a Christian's Theme.</L>
<L>Far nobler Thoughts my grateful Voice should raise,</L>
<L>In lofty Strains, to great MESSIAH's Praise:</L>
<L>I'd joyfully resound his wond'rous Birth,</L>
<L>And paint his Godlike Virtues, whilst on Earth;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="45"/>
Then, with Reluctance, Horror, and Surprize,</L>
<L>I'd mournfully relate his Agonies;</L>
<L>I'd trace the heav'nly Hero to the Tree,</L>
<L>Sing what he suffer'd there for you and me;</L>
<L>Next, in heroic Numbers, would I tell,</L>
<L>How soon he baffled Death, and vanquish'd Hell,</L>
<L>Subdu'd the Grave, and shew'd the glorious Way,</L>
<L>From Realms of Darkness, to eternal Day.</L>
<L>Such noble Subjects should my Lays excite;</L>
<L>And you, my Patron, would in such delight;</L>
<L>Grateful to me, when you, well-pleas'd, should view</L>
<L>Th'accomplish'd sacred Song inscrib'd to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now I must omit MESSIAH's Praise,</L>
<L>Lest I degrade him with unworthy Lays;</L>
<L>My Fate compels me silent to remain,</L>
<L>For want of Learning to improve my Strain:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="46"/>
By which no Thought, tho' well conceiv'd, can rise</L>
<L>To full Perfection, but in Embryo dies:</L>
<L>Yet my unpolish'd Genius will produce,</L>
<L>And bring forth something, tho' of little Use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, in the Country, often have I found,</L>
<L>Thro' slothful Man's Neglect, a Plat of Ground,</L>
<L>Waste and uncultivated, void of Seeds,</L>
<L>Producing nothing, but some trifling Weeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT why stand I my Fate accusing so?</L>
<L>The Field calls me to Labour; I must go:</L>
<L>The Kine low after Meat; the hungry Steed,</L>
<L>Neighing, complains he wants his usual Feed.</L>
<L>Then, Sir, adieu: Accept what you did crave,</L>
<L>And be propitious to your humble Slave.</L>

<HEAD>On POVERTY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NO Ill on Earth we tim'rous Mortals fly</L>
<L>With so much Dread, as abject Poverty:</L>
<L>O despicable Name! We, thee to shun,</L>
<L>On ev'ry other Evil blindly run.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, distrustful Niggards go</L>
<L>In tatter'd Rags, and starve their Bodies too,</L>
<L>And still are poor, for fear of being so.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, the cheating Trader vows,</L>
<L>His Wares are good, altho' his Conscience knows,</L>
<L>He has employ'd his utmost Skill and Care,</L>
<L>To hide their Faults, and make their Beauties glare.</L>
<L>The Sailor, terrify'd with Thoughts of thee,</L>
<L>Boldly attempts the Dangers of the Sea;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="48"/>
From East to West, o'er Rocks and Quicksands steers;</L>
<L>'Tis Poverty, and that alone, he fears;</L>
<L>The Soldier too, whom nought but thee can scare,</L>
<L>In Hopes of Plunder, bravely meets the War;</L>
<L>To fly from Poverty, he runs on Death,</L>
<L>And shews he prizes Riches more than Breath.</L>
<L>Strange Terror of Mankind! By thee misled,</L>
<L>Not Conscience, Quicksands, Rocks, or Death they dread!</L>
<L>And yet thou art no formidable Foe,</L>
<L>Except to little Souls, who think thee so:</L>
<L>Who thro' the Glass of Prejudice survey</L>
<L>Thy Face, a thousand frightful Forms display.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS Men, at Night, in foolish Fears grown old,</L>
<L>Who mind the Fairy Tales their Nurses told,</L>
<L>Start at a Goblin, which their Fancy made,</L>
<L>And, for a Spectre, often take a Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="49"/>
<L>CONTENTED Poverty's no dismal Thing,</L>
<L>Free from the Cares unwieldy Riches bring:</L>
<L>At Distance both alike deceive our View;</L>
<L>Nearer approach'd, they take another Hue.</L>
<L>The poor Man's Labour relishes his Meat;</L>
<L>His Morsel's pleasant, and his Rest is sweet:</L>
<L>Not so the Rich, who find their weary'd Taste</L>
<L>Pall'd with the Prospect of the cumb'rous Feast;</L>
<L>For what they have more than they can enjoy,</L>
<L>Instead of satisfying, does but cloy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT let us state the Case another way:</L>
<L>Were Poverty so hideous as they say,</L>
<L>'Tis nobler chearfully to bear our Fate,</L>
<L>Than murmur and repine beneath its Weight.</L>
<L>That Man deserves the Praise of human Kind,</L>
<L>Who bears ill Fortune with a Christian Mind:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="50"/>
How does his great heroic Soul aspire</L>
<L>Above that sordid Wealth the rest admire!</L>
<L>His nobler Thoughts are fix'd on Things above;</L>
<L>His faithful Eyes survey the GOD of Love</L>
<L>Hold forth the heav'nly Prize, which makes him run</L>
<L>His mortal Race, to gain th'immortal Crown.</L>
<L>Not all the Snares a crafty Dev'l can lay,</L>
<L>Can intercept, or daunt him in his Way.</L>
<L>Not all the scornful Insults of the Proud,</L>
<L>Not all the Censures of the grov'ling Croud,</L>
<L>Not Poverty, in all her Terrors drest,</L>
<L>Can shake the solid Quiet of his Breast:</L>
<L>Unmov'd he stands against the worst of Foes,</L>
<L>And mocks the Darts, which adverse Fortune throws,</L>
<L>Calm and compos'd, amidst or Ease or Pain;</L>
<L>And finds Content, which others seek in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="51"/>
<L>So stands a steady Rock, sublimely steep,</L>
<L>Within the Confines of the briny Deep;</L>
<L>Lash'd by the foaming Surge on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L>Yet can't be shaken by the furious Tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN why should Phantoms discompose the Mind;</L>
<L>Or Woes, so far from real, fright Mankind?</L>
<L>Since Wealth can never make the Vicious blest,</L>
<L>Nor Poverty subdue the virtuous Breast;</L>
<L>Since both from Heav'n's unerring Hand are sent,</L>
<L>LORD, give me either; give me but CONTENT.</L>

<HEAD>The THRESHER's LABOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Rev<SUP>d</SUP>. Mr. STANLEY.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THE grateful Tribute of these rural Lays,</L>
<L>Which to her Patron's Hand the Muse conveys,</L>
<L>Deign to accept: 'Tis just she Tribute bring</L>
<L>To him, whose Bounty gives her Life to sing;</L>
<L>To him, whose gen'rous Favours tune her Voice;</L>
<L>And bid her, 'midst her Poverty, rejoice.</L>
<L>Inspir'd by these, she dares herself prepare,</L>
<L>To sing the Toils of each revolving Year;</L>
<L>Those endless Toils, which always grow anew,</L>
<L>And the poor <HI>Thresher</HI>'s destin'd to pursue:</L>
<L>Ev'n these, with Pleasure, can the Muse rehearse,</L>
<L>When you and Gratitude demand her Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="53"/>
<L>SOON as the golden Harvest quits the Plain,</L>
<L>And CERES' Gifts reward the Farmer's Pain;</L>
<L>What Corn each Sheaf will yield, intent to hear,</L>
<L>And guess from thence the Profits of the Year,</L>
<L>He calls his Reapers forth: Around we stand,</L>
<L>With deep Attention, waiting his Command.</L>
<L>To each our Task he readily divides,</L>
<L>And pointing, to our diff'rent Stations guides.</L>
<L>As he directs, to distant Barns we go;</L>
<L>Here two for Wheat, and there for Barley two.</L>
<L>But first, to shew what he expects to find,</L>
<L>These Words, or Words like these, disclose his Mind:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" So dry the Corn was carry'd from the Field,</L>
<L>" So easily 'twill thresh, so well 'twill yield;</L>
<L>" Sure large Days-works I well may hope for now:</L>
<L>" Come, strip and try; let's see what you can do."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="54"/>
<L>DIVESTED of our Cloathes, with Flail in Hand,</L>
<L>At proper Distance, Front to Front we stand:</L>
<L>And first the Threshal's gently swung, to prove</L>
<L>Whether with just Exactness it will move:</L>
<L>That once secure, we swiftly whirl them round;</L>
<L>From the strong Planks our Crab-tree Staves rebound,</L>
<L>And echoing Barns return the rattling Sound.</L>
<L>Now in the Air our knotty Weapons fly,</L>
<L>And now with equal Force descend from high;</L>
<L>Down one, one up, so well they keep the Time,</L>
<L>The CYCLOPS' Hammers could not truer chime;</L>
<L>Nor with more heavy Strokes could <HI>Aetna</HI> groan,</L>
<L>When VULCAN forg'd the Arms for THETIS' Son.</L>
<L>In briny Streams our Sweat descends apace,</L>
<L>Drops from our Locks, or trickles down our Face.</L>
<L>No Intermission in our Work we know;</L>
<L>The noisy Threshal must for ever go.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="55"/>
Their Master absent, others safely play;</L>
<L>The sleeping Threshal does itself betray.</L>
<L>Nor yet, the tedious Labour to beguile,</L>
<L>And make the passing Minutes sweetly smile,</L>
<L>Can we, like Shepherds, tell a merry Tale;</L>
<L>The Voice is lost, drown'd by the louder Flail.</L>
<L>But we may think—Alas! what pleasing thing,</L>
<L>Here, to the Mind, can the dull Fancy bring?</L>
<L>Our Eye beholds no pleasing Object here,</L>
<L>No chearful Sound diverts our list'ning Ear.</L>
<L>The Shepherd well may tune his Voice to sing,</L>
<L>Inspir'd with all the Beauties of the Spring.</L>
<L>No Fountains murmur here, no Lambkins play,</L>
<L>No Linnets warble, and no Fields look gay;</L>
<L>'Tis all a gloomy, melancholy Scene,</L>
<L>Fit only to provoke the Muse's Spleen.</L>
<L>When sooty Pease we thresh, you scarce can know</L>
<L>Our native Colour, as from Work we go.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="56"/>
The Sweat, the Dust, and suffocating Smoak,</L>
<L>Make us so much like <HI>Ethiopians</HI> look,</L>
<L>We scare our Wives, when Ev'ning brings us home;</L>
<L>And frighted Infants think the Bugbear come.</L>
<L>Week after Week, we this dull Task pursue,</L>
<L>Unless when winn'wing Days produce a new:</L>
<L>A new, indeed, but frequently a worse!</L>
<L>The Threshal yields but to the Master's Curse.</L>
<L>He counts the Bushels, counts how much a Day;</L>
<L>Then swears we've idled half our Time away:</L>
<L>" Why, look ye, Rogues, d'ye think that this will do?</L>
<L>" Your Neighbours thresh as much again as you."</L>
<L>Now in our Hands we wish our noisy Tools,</L>
<L>To drown the hated Names of Rogues and Fools.</L>
<L>But wanting these, we just like School-boys look,</L>
<L>When angry Masters view the blotted Book:</L>
<L>They cry, "their Ink was faulty, and their Pen;"</L>
<L>We, "the Corn threshes bad, 'twas cut too green."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="57"/>
<L>BUT soon as Winter hides his hoary Head,</L>
<L>And Nature's Face is with new Beauty spread;</L>
<L>The lovely <HI>Spring</HI> appears, refreshing Show'rs</L>
<L>New cloath the Field with Grass, and blooming Flow'rs.</L>
<L>Next her, the rip'ning <HI>Summer</HI> presses on,</L>
<L>And SOL begins his longest Race to run.</L>
<L>Before the Door our welcome Master stands;</L>
<L>Tells us, the ripen'd Grass requires our Hands.</L>
<L>The grateful Tidings presently imparts</L>
<L>Life to our Looks, and Spirits to our Hearts.</L>
<L>We wish the happy Season may be fair;</L>
<L>And, joyful, long to breathe in op'ner Air.</L>
<L>This Change of Labour seems to give such Ease,</L>
<L>With Thoughts of Happiness ourselves we please.</L>
<L>But, ah! how rarely's Happiness complete!</L>
<L>There's always Bitter mingled with the Sweet.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="58"/>
When first the Lark sings Prologue to the Day,</L>
<L>We rise, admonish'd by his early Lay;</L>
<L>This new Employ with eager Haste to prove,</L>
<L>This new Employ, become so much our Love.</L>
<L>Alas! that human Joys should change so soon!</L>
<L>Our Morning Pleasure turns to Pain at Noon.</L>
<L>The Birds salute us, as to Work we go,</L>
<L>And with new Life our Bosoms seem to glow.</L>
<L>On our right Shoulder hangs the crooked Blade,</L>
<L>The Weapon destin'd to uncloath the Mead:</L>
<L>Our left supports the Whetstone, Scrip, and Beer;</L>
<L>This for our Scythes, and these ourselves to chear.</L>
<L>And now the Field, design'd to try our Might,</L>
<L>At length appears, and meets our longing Sight.</L>
<L>The Grass and Ground we view with careful Eyes,</L>
<L>To see which way the best Advantage lies;</L>
<L>And, Hero-like, each claims the foremost Place.</L>
<L>At first our Labour seems a sportive Race:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="59"/>
With rapid Force our sharpen'd Blades we drive,</L>
<L>Strain ev'ry Nerve, and Blow for Blow we give.</L>
<L>All strive to vanquish, tho' the Victor gains</L>
<L>No other Glory, but the greatest Pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT when the scorching Sun is mounted high,</L>
<L>And no kind Barns with friendly Shade are nigh;</L>
<L>Our weary Scythes entangle in the Grass,</L>
<L>While Streams of Sweat run trickling down apace.</L>
<L>Our sportive Labour we too late lament;</L>
<L>And wish that Strength again, we vainly spent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, in the Morn, a Courser have I seen</L>
<L>With headlong Fury scour the level Green;</L>
<L>Or mount the Hills, if Hills are in his Way,</L>
<L>As if no Labour could his Fire allay;</L>
<L>Till PHOEBUS, shining with meridian Heat,</L>
<L>Has bath'd his panting Sides in briny Sweat:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="60"/>
The lengthen'd Chace scarce able to sustain,</L>
<L>He measures back the Hills and Dales with Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH Heat and Labour tir'd, our Scythes we quit,</L>
<L>Search out a shady Tree, and down we sit:</L>
<L>From Scrip and Bottle hope new Strength to gain;</L>
<L>But Scrip and Bottle too are try'd in vain.</L>
<L>Down our parch'd Throats we scarce the Bread can get;</L>
<L>And, quite o'erspent with Toil, but faintly eat.</L>
<L>Nor can the Bottle only answer all;</L>
<L>The Bottle and the Beer are both too small.</L>
<L>Time flows: Again we rise from off the Grass;</L>
<L>Again each Mower takes his proper Place;</L>
<L>Not eager now, as late, our Strength to prove;</L>
<L>But all contented regular to move.</L>
<L>We often whet, and often view the Sun;</L>
<L>As often wish, his tedious Race was run.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="61"/>
At length he veils his purple Face from Sight,</L>
<L>And bids the weary Labourer Good-night.</L>
<L>Homewards we move, but spent so much with Toil,</L>
<L>We slowly walk, and rest at ev'ry Stile.</L>
<L>Our good expecting Wives, who think we stay,</L>
<L>Got to the Door, soon eye us in the Way.</L>
<L>Then from the Pot the Dumplin's catch'd in haste,</L>
<L>And homely by its Side the Bacon plac'd.</L>
<L>Supper and Sleep by Morn new Strength supply;</L>
<L>And out we set again, our Work to try;</L>
<L>But not so early quite, nor quite so fast,</L>
<L>As, to our Cost, we did the Morning past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOON as the rising Sun has drank the Dew,</L>
<L>Another Scene is open to our View:</L>
<L>Our Master comes, and at his Heels a Throng</L>
<L>Of prattling Females, arm'd with Rake and Prong;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="62"/>
Prepar'd, whilst he is here, to make his Hay;</L>
<L>Or, if he turns his Back, prepar'd to play:</L>
<L>But here, or gone, sure of this Comfort still;</L>
<L>Here's Company, so they may chat their Fill.</L>
<L>Ah! were their Hands so active as their Tongues,</L>
<L>How nimbly then would move the Rakes and Prongs?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Grass again is spread upon the Ground,</L>
<L>Till not a vacant Place is to be found;</L>
<L>And while the parching Sun-beams on it shine,</L>
<L>The Hay-makers have Time allow'd to dine.</L>
<L>That soon dispatch'd, they still sit on the Ground;</L>
<L>And the brisk Chat, renew'd, afresh goes round.</L>
<L>All talk at once; but seeming all to fear,</L>
<L>That what they speak, the rest will hardly hear;</L>
<L>Till by degrees so high their Notes they strain,</L>
<L>A Stander by can nought distinguish plain.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="63"/>
So loud's their Speech, and so confus'd their Noise,</L>
<L>Scarce puzzled ECHO can return the Voice.</L>
<L>Yet, spite of this, they bravely all go on;</L>
<L>Each scorns to be, or seem to be, outdone.</L>
<L>Meanwhile the changing Sky begins to lour,</L>
<L>And hollow Winds proclaim a sudden Show'r:</L>
<L>The tattling Crowd can scarce their Garments gain,</L>
<L>Before descends the thick impetuous Rain;</L>
<L>Their noisy Prattle all at once is done,</L>
<L>And to the Hedge they soon for Shelter run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS have I seen, on a bright Summer's Day,</L>
<L>On some green Brake, a Flock of Sparrows play;</L>
<L>From Twig to Twig, from Bush to Bush they fly;</L>
<L>And with continu'd Chirping fill the Sky:</L>
<L>But, on a sudden, if a Storm appears,</L>
<L>Their chirping Noise no longer dins your Ears:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="64"/>
They fly for Shelter to the thickest Bush;</L>
<L>There silent sit, and All at once is hush.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT better Fate succeeds this rainy Day,</L>
<L>And little Labour serves to make the Hay.</L>
<L>Fast as 'tis cut, so kindly shines the Sun,</L>
<L>Turn'd once or twice, the pleasing Work is done.</L>
<L>Next Day the Cocks appear in equal Rows,</L>
<L>Which the glad Master in safe Ricks bestows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE spacious Fields we now no longer range;</L>
<L>And yet, hard Fate! still Work for Work we change.</L>
<L>Back to the Barns we hastily are sent,</L>
<L>Where lately so much Time we pensive spent:</L>
<L>Not pensive now, we bless the friendly Shade;</L>
<L>And to avoid the parching Sun are glad.</L>
<L>Yet little Time we in the Shade remain,</L>
<L>Before our Master calls us forth again;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="65"/>
And says, "For Harvest now yourselves prepare;</L>
<L>" The ripen'd Harvést now demands your Care.</L>
<L>" Get all things ready, and be quickly drest;</L>
<L>" Early next Morn I shall disturb your Rest."</L>
<L>Strict to his Word! for scarce the Dawn appears,</L>
<L>Before his hasty Summons fills our Ears.</L>
<L>His hasty Summons we obey; and rise,</L>
<L>While yet the Stars are glimm'ring in the Skies.</L>
<L>With him our Guide we to the Wheat-field go,</L>
<L>He to appoint, and we the Work to do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE Reapers, cast your Eyes around the Field;</L>
<L>And view the various Scenes its Beauties yield:</L>
<L>Then look again, with a more tender Eye,</L>
<L>To think how soon it must in Ruin lie!</L>
<L>For, once set in, where-e'er our Blows we deal,</L>
<L>There's no resisting of the well-whet Steel:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="66"/>
But here or there, where-e'er our Course we bend,</L>
<L>Sure Desolation does our Steps attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, when <HI>Arabia</HI>'s Sons, in Hopes of Prey,</L>
<L>To some more fertile Country take their Way,</L>
<L>How beauteous all Things in the Morn appear!</L>
<L>There rural Cots, and pleasant Villa's here!</L>
<L>So many grateful Objects meet the Sight,</L>
<L>The ravish'd Eye could willing gaze till Night.</L>
<L>But long ere then, where-e'er their Troops have past,</L>
<L>These pleasing Prospects lie a gloomy Waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Morning past, we sweat beneath the Sun;</L>
<L>And but uneasily our Work goes on.</L>
<L>Before us we perplexing Thistles find,</L>
<L>And Corn blown adverse with the ruffling Wind.</L>
<L>Behind our Master waits; and if he spies</L>
<L>One charitable Ear, he grudging cries,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="67"/>
" Ye scatter half your Wages o'er the Land."</L>
<L>Then scrapes the Stubble with his greedy Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET those who feast at Ease on dainty Fare,</L>
<L>Pity the Reapers, who their Feasts prepare:</L>
<L>For Toils scarce ever ceasing press us now;</L>
<L>Rest never does, but on the Sabbath, show;</L>
<L>And barely that our Masters will allow.</L>
<L>Think what a painful Life we daily lead;</L>
<L>Each Morning early rise, go late to Bed:</L>
<L>Nor, when asleep, are we secure from Pain;</L>
<L>We then perform our Labours o'er again:</L>
<L>Our mimic Fancy ever restless seems;</L>
<L>And what we act awake, she acts in Dreams.</L>
<L>Hard Fate! Our Labours ev'n in Sleep don't cease;</L>
<L>Scarce HERCULES e'er felt such Toils as these!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="26" REF="68"/>
<L>BUT soon we rise the bearded Crop again,</L>
<L>Soon PHOEBUS' Rays well dry the golden Grain.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Scene, our Master glows with Joy;</L>
<L>Bids us for Carrying all our Force employ;</L>
<L>When strait Confusion o'er the Field appears,</L>
<L>And stunning Clamours fill the Workmens Ears;</L>
<L>The Bells and clashing Whips alternate sound,</L>
<L>And rattling Waggons thunder o'er the Ground.</L>
<L>The Wheat, when carry'd, Pease, and other Grain,</L>
<L>We soon secure, and leave a fruitless Plain;</L>
<L>In noisy Triumph the last Load moves on,</L>
<L>And loud Huzza's proclaim the Harvest done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OUR Master, joyful at the pleasing Sight,</L>
<L>Invites us all to feast with him at Night.</L>
<L>A Table plentifully spread we find,</L>
<L>And Jugs of humming Ale, to chear the Mind;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="69"/>
Which he, too gen'rous, pushes round so fast,</L>
<L>We think no Toils to come, nor mind the past.</L>
<L>But the next Morning soon reveals the Cheat,</L>
<L>When the same Toils we must again repeat;</L>
<L>To the same Barns must back again return,</L>
<L>To labour there for Room for next Year's Corn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, as the Year's revolving Course goes round,</L>
<L>No Respite from our Labour can be found:</L>
<L>Like SISYPHUS, our Work is never done;</L>
<L>Continually rolls back the restless Stone.</L>
<L>New-growing Labours still succeed the past;</L>
<L>And growing always new, must always last.</L>

<OPENER>To Mrs. STANLEY.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>DEIGN, heav'nly Muses, to assist my Song:</L>
<L>To heav'nly Muses heav'nly Themes belong.</L>
<L>But chiefly Thou, O GOD, my Soul inspire,</L>
<L>And touch my Lips with thy celestial Fire:</L>
<L>If Thou delight'st in flow'ry <HI>Carmel</HI>'s Shade,</L>

<PB N="29" REF="71"/>
<L>So pray'd the <HI>Shunammite</HI>; Heav'n heard the Dame;</L>
<L>The distant Tribes around her list'ning came,</L>
<L>To hear th'amazing Tale; while thus her Tongue,</L>
<L>Mov'd by some heav'nly Pow'r, began the Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ATTEND, ye Seed of ABRAM, and give Ear,</L>
<L>While I JEHOVAH's glorious Acts declare:</L>
<L>How Life from Death, and Joy from Sadness spring,</L>
<L>If He assist the Muse, the Muse shall sing.</L>
<L>My Lord and I, to whom all-bounteous Heav'n</L>
<L>His Blessings with no sparing Hand had giv'n,</L>
<L>Like faithful Stewards of our wealthy Store,</L>
<L>Still lodg'd the Stranger, and reliev'd the Poor.</L>
<L>And as ELISHA, by divine Command,</L>
<L>Came preaching Virtue to a sinful Land;</L>
<L>He often deign'd to lodge within our Gate,</L>
<L>And oft receiv'd an hospitable Treat:</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="72"/>
A decent Chamber for him we prepar'd;</L>
<L>And he, the gen'rous Labour to reward,</L>
<L>Honours in Camp, or Court, to us propos'd;</L>
<L>Which I refus'd, and thus my Mind disclos'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HEAV'N's King has plac'd us in a fertile Land,</L>
<L>Where he show'rs down his Gifts with copious Hand:</L>
<L>Already we enjoy an affluent Store;</L>
<L>Why should we be solicitous for more?</L>
<L>Give Martial Camps, and Kingly Courts to them,</L>
<L>Who place their only Bliss in fleeting Fame:</L>
<L>There let them live in golden Chains of State;</L>
<L>And be unhappy, only to be great.</L>
<L>But let us in our native Soil remain,</L>
<L>Nor barter Happiness for sordid Gain.</L>
<L>Here may we feed the Indigent in Peace,</L>
<L>Or cloath the Bare with the superfluous Fleece,</L>
<L>And give the weary fainting Pilgrim Ease.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="73"/>
This we prefer to Pomp, and formal Show,</L>
<L>Which only serve to varnish o'er our Woe;</L>
<L>Refulgent Ornaments, which dress the Proud,</L>
<L>Objects of Wonder to the gazing Crowd;</L>
<L>Yet seldom give Content, or solid Rest,</L>
<L>To the vain Man, by whom they are possess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL Blessings, but a Child, had Heav'n supply'd;</L>
<L>And only that th'Almighty had deny'd:</L>
<L>Which when the holy prescient Sage had heard,</L>
<L>He said, and I before him strait appear'd:</L>
<L>And, as my Feet approach'd his awful Room,</L>
<L>I saw his Face diviner Looks assume;</L>
<L>Not such a Wildness, and fanatic Mien,</L>
<L>With which, some say, the <HI>Delphic</HI> Priests are seen;</L>
<L>When they, for Mysteries of Fate, explain</L>
<L>The odd Chimera's of a frantic Brain;</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="74"/>
But with a grave majestic Air he stood,</L>
<L>While more than human in his Aspect glow'd;</L>
<L>Celestial Grace sat on his radiant Look,</L>
<L>And Pow'r diffusive shone, before he spoke.</L>
<L>Then thus: "Hail, gen'rous Soul! Thy pious Cares</L>
<L>" Are not forgot, nor fruitless are thy Pray'rs:</L>
<L>" Propitious Heav'n, thy virtuous Deeds to crown,</L>
<L>" Shall make thy barren Womb conceive a Son."</L>
<L>So spake the Seer; and, to complete my Joy,</L>
<L>As he had spoke, I bore the promis'd Boy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOON to my Friends the welcome News was known,</L>
<L>Who crowded in apace to see my Son,</L>
<L>Hailing, with kind Salutes, the recent Child;</L>
<L>And, with their pious Hymns, my Pain beguil'd.</L>
<L>When all had said, I mov'd my joyful Tongue;</L>
<L>And thus to Heav'n address'd my grateful Song:</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>" O GOD, what Eloquence can sing thy Praise?</L>

<L>" <HI>Arabian</HI> Deserts shall with Plenty smile,</L>
<L>" And curling Vines adorn the sterile Soil.</L>

<L>As thus she spake, her Audience raise their Voice;</L>
<L>And interrupt her Song, as they rejoice:</L>
<L>" O GOD, we gladly hear thy mighty Pow'r,</L>
<L>" With joyful Heart thy gracious Name adore:</L>
<L>" All Nature is subservient to thy Word;</L>

Like an embattled Army in the Field;</L>
<L>A new delightful Prospect to the Child!</L>
<L>But either there the scorching Sun display'd</L>
<L>His Heat intense, and on his Vitals prey'd;</L>
<L>Or else some sudden apoplectic Pain,</L>
<L>With racking Torture, seiz'd his tender Brain;</L>
<L>His Spirits fail'd, he straight began to faint,</L>
<L>And to his Father vainly made Complaint:</L>
<L>The glowing Rose was quickly seen to fade;</L>
<L>At once his Beauty, and his Life, decay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOON, at my House, the dismal News I heard;</L>
<L>Soon, at my House, the dying Child appear'd:</L>
<L>T'embrace him I, with fond Affection, run;</L>
<L>And, O! said I, what Pain afflicts my Son?</L>
<L>He try'd to speak; but, fault'ring, gave a Groan;</L>
<L>No perfect Word proceeded from his Tongue;</L>
<L>But on his Lips the broken Accents hung.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="80"/>
All Means I us'd, that might allay his Pain;</L>
<L>All Means I us'd, but us'd them all in vain.</L>
<L>Yet, while he liv'd, my Soul would not despair;</L>
<L>Nor, till he ceas'd to breathe, I ceas'd my Pray'r:</L>
<L>Deluding Hope now stopt the falling Tears;</L>
<L>Now his increasing Pains increas'd my Fears:</L>
<L>By Hope and Fear alternate was I toss'd,</L>
<L>Till Hope, in a sad Certainty, was lost:</L>
<L>Short, and more short, he drew his panting Breath,</L>
<L>(Too sure Presage of his approaching Death!)</L>
<L>Till soon the Blood, congealing, ceas'd to flow;</L>
<L>He dropt his Head with a declining Bow:</L>
<L>Thrice, from my Breast, to raise himself he try'd,</L>
<L>And thrice sunk down again; then, groaning, dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, when with Care we've nurs'd a tender Vine,</L>
<L>And taught the docile Branches where to twine;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="81"/>
An Eastern Gale, or some pernicious Frost,</L>
<L>Nips the young Tree, and all our Labour's lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH Horror chill'd, a-while I speechless stood,</L>
<L>Viewing the Child, and trembling as I view'd:</L>
<L>My Eyes discharg'd their humid Store apace,</L>
<L>And Tears succeeded Tears adown my Face:</L>
<L>Scarcely my Heart the Load of Grief sustain'd;</L>
<L>At length, recov'ring Speech, I thus complain'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O fleeting Joys! inconstant as the Wind!</L>
<L>Which only for a Moment please the Mind;</L>
<L>Then fly, and leave a Weight of Woes behind!</L>
<L>But yet in vain I thus lament and mourn;</L>
<L>The Soul, once fled, shall never more return;</L>
<L>And the fair Body now must be convey'd</L>
<L>To Earth's dark Bosom, and eternal Shade—</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="82"/>
Yet let me not prescribe a Bound to Heav'n;</L>
<L>'Twas by a Miracle the Child was giv'n;</L>
<L>Nor can I think the Wonder is more great,</L>
<L>Should the departed Soul resume her Seat.</L>
<L>What if I to Mount <HI>Carmel</HI> haste away,</L>
<L>To him who did his mystic Birth display?</L>
<L>His pow'rful Word the barren fruitful made;</L>
<L>His pow'rful Word, perhaps, may raise the Dead.</L>
<L>The famous <HI>Tishbite</HI> rais'd a Widow's Son;</L>
<L>ELISHA has as wond'rous Actions done.</L>
<L>When he to <HI>Jordan</HI>'s rapid Torrent came;</L>
<L>And, with the Mantle, smote th'impetuous Stream;</L>
<L>Obsequious to the Stroke, the Waves divide;</L>
<L>And raise a liquid Wall on either Side!</L>
<L>At <HI>Jericho</HI> long had the barren Soil</L>
<L>Deceiv'd the Husbandman, and mock'd his Toil;</L>
<L>Yet, at his Word, it grew a fertile Field,</L>
<L>And pois'nous Springs did wholsome Waters yield.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="83"/>
Nor can he only such great Blessings send;</L>
<L>But Curses, if invok'd, his Call attend:</L>
<L>Else how at <HI>Bethel</HI> brought he Vengeance down,</L>
<L>As a just Scourge, on that opprobrious Town?</L>
<L>Again, when <HI>Moab</HI> Peace with <HI>Israel</HI> broke,</L>
<L>And vainly strove to quit the servile Yoke;</L>
<L>Our pow'rful Kings led forth th'embattled Host</L>
<L>Thro' <HI>Edom</HI>'s sultry Wilds, and Air adust;</L>
<L>Where the confed'rate Troops no Water found,</L>
<L>Dry were the Springs, and sterile was the Ground;</L>
<L>The Captains wonted Strength and Courage fail'd,</L>
<L>When Thirst and Foes at once their Host assail'd:</L>
<L>The Kings to him their joint Petitions made,</L>
<L>And fainting Soldiers crav'd his timely Aid;</L>
<L>Nor crav'd in vain: The pow'rful Word he spake,</L>
<L>And flowing Waters form'd a spacious Lake;</L>
<L>The shining Streams advanc'd their humid Train,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Edom</HI>'s Wilds became a liquid Plain:</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="84"/>
Not in more Plenty did the Waters run</L>
<L>Out of the Rock, when struck by AMRAM's Son.</L>
<L>And who can that amazing Deed forget,</L>
<L>Which he perform'd to pay the Widow's Debt?</L>
<L>Whose Quantity of Oil one Pot contain'd;</L>

<L>Then call'd my Servant to prepare the Steed.</L>
<L>Pensive and sad, my mourning Husband said,</L>
<L>'Tis now in vain to crave ELISHA's Aid:</L>
<L>No God To-day the Prophet does inspire;</L>
<L>Nor can he answer, what thou wouldst inquire.</L>

<L>RATHER than sink, said I, attempt to raise</L>
<L>My Hopes, nor talk of Ceremonial Days;</L>
<L>His God is present still, and hears him when he prays.</L>
<L>Thus said, urging my Steed with eager Haste,</L>
<L>Swift as a Mountain Roe, the Plains I pass'd;</L>
<L>O'er Hills and Dales my Journey I pursu'd;</L>
<L>Nor slack'd my Pace, till <HI>Carmel</HI>'s Mount I view'd;</L>
<L>On whose delightful Brow, in cool Retreat,</L>
<L>Among the curling Vines, the Prophet sat;</L>
<L>Whose twining Arms a verdant Arbour made;</L>
<L>The verdant Arbour form'd a grateful Shade;</L>
<L>The fanning Zephyrs gently play'd around,</L>
<L>And shook the trembling Leaves, and swept the Ground;</L>
<L>Down humbly at his Feet I prostrate fell,</L>
<L>Submiss; and, weeping, told the mournful Tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>STRIVE to compose thy anxious Soul, said he;</L>
<L>Tears can't revoke JEHOVAH's fix'd Decree:</L>
<L>We live and die, and both, as He thinks fit,</L>
<L>Who may command; but Mortals must submit.</L>
<L>This Fate the King, as well as Peasant, finds;</L>
<L>Nor is it evil, but to evil Minds—</L>
<L>Yet if from Heav'n I can my Suit obtain,</L>
<L>Thy lifeless Son shall yet revive again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS said, with Looks divine, his Staff he views,</L>
<L>As if some pow'rful Charm he would infuse:</L>
<L>Then calls his Servant hastily, and said,</L>
<L>On the Child's Face let this be quickly laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Thou, said I, on whom my Hopes depend,</L>
<L>Do not this Work to Servants Care commend:</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="87"/>
If Thou thyself with me refuse to go,</L>
<L>Here, to the list'ning Vines, I'll vent my Woe;</L>
<L>Still prostrate lie, lamenting for my Son,</L>
<L>Till ev'ry Hill prove vocal to my Moan.</L>
<L>More had I said, but Grief the Words supprest;</L>
<L>Yet Sighs, and silent Tears, explain'd the rest.</L>
<L>At length he from his verdant Seat arose,</L>
<L>And hastily adown the Mountain goes:</L>
<L>To <HI>Shunem</HI> we, with Speed, our Way pursue;</L>
<L>The City soon appears within our View;</L>
<L>And the obedient Servant, at the Gate,</L>
<L>Returning sad, without Success, we met:</L>
<L>The beauteous Child by Death still vanquish'd lay;</L>
<L>Still Death insulted o'er the beauteous Prey;</L>
<L>Till to the House the sacred Seer was come,</L>
<L>And, with supernal Pow'r, approach'd the Room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="44" REF="88"/>
<L>BY the dead Child, a-while, he pensive stood;</L>
<L>Then from the Chamber put the mourning Crowd:</L>
<L>That done, to GOD he made his ardent Pray'r,</L>
<L>And breath'd upon the Child with vital Air:</L>
<L>And now the Soul resumes her pristine Seat;</L>
<L>And now the Heart again begins to beat;</L>
<L>Life's purple Current o'er the Body spreads,</L>
<L>While Death, repuls'd, ingloriously recedes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, when a prowling Wolf has stol'n a Lamb,</L>
<L>He sternly guards it from the bleating Dam;</L>
<L>But if the Keeper comes, he quits his Prey,</L>
<L>And low'ring, with Reluctance, makes away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND now the Prophet, to my longing Arms,</L>
<L>Resign'd the Child, with more than wonted Charms:</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="89"/>
The blushing Rose shone fresher in his Face,</L>
<L>And Beauty smil'd with a superior Grace.</L>

<L>Behind the sable Moon pursues his Way;</L>

<L>Forc'd at their frugal Hands my Bread to get:</L>

<L>WHEN me she first into her Favour took,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COLIN.</SPEAKER>
<L>MY Harvest is not blasted on the Ground,</L>
<L>Nor has the Royal CAROLINA frown'd:</L>
<L>But lately, when the Sun had gaily drest</L>
<L>The lofty Mountains in a purple Vest,</L>
<L>I early rose, to tend my fleecy Care;</L>
<L>Wet was the Grass, and piercing cold the Air.</L>
<L>My lovely SYLVIA, stay behind, I said,</L>
<L>Till I have weav'd a Garland for thy Head;</L>
<L>Till I a Bow'r, with shady Branches, form,</L>
<L>To shun the scorching Ray, or rapid Storm;</L>
<L>And, when the Dew's exhal'd, which Night distill'd,</L>
<L>Bless COLIN with thy Presence in the Field.</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="102"/>
She answer'd not; but from her Bosom sent</L>
<L>A deep presaging Sigh, before I went.</L>
<L>The Sun had painted ev'ry Object gay,</L>
<L>When to the chearful Field I took my Way;</L>
<L>The Lark with Mattins welcom'd in the Morn;</L>
<L>The Thrush and Finch sat chirping on the Thorn;</L>
<L>The Swallows round, in airy Circles, flew;</L>
<L>And, ah! poor COLIN then was joyful too:</L>
<L>But suddenly I saw the Mists arise,</L>
<L>And dark'ning Clouds o'erspread the dusky Skies,</L>
<L>Th'Horizon seem'd to cast a gloomy Frown,</L>
<L>While from his airy Height the Lark sunk down</L>
<L>The tuneful Birds their joyous Songs deny'd;</L>
<L>And boding Owls, and sooty Ravens, cry'd.</L>
<L>My drooping Heart, which felt unusual Weight,</L>
<L>Shock'd with such Omens, ceas'd almost to beat:</L>
<L>Yet these, said I, portend no Evil, while</L>
<L>My Royal Mistress condescends to smile:</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="103"/>
If She's propitious, what can COLIN fear?</L>
<L>Inur'd the lesser Ills of Life to bear.</L>
<L>Thus said, I took my Way to yonder Grove;</L>
<L>And form'd, with spreading Boughs, an arch'd Alcove:</L>
<L>So close I twisted in each pliant Spray,</L>
<L>As might exclude the Wind, or sunny Ray.</L>
<L>With sweetest Flow'rs I deck'd the mossy Ground,</L>
<L>And strew'd the fragrant Woodbinds all around.</L>
<L>Here, when, said I, my SYLVIA comes a-field,</L>
<L>This grateful Bow'r a safe Retreat shall yield:</L>
<L>If rainy, here she may the Storms evade;</L>
<L>If fair, the Branches will project a Shade:</L>
<L>Here SYLVIA shall, with COLIN, take her Rest;</L>
<L>And COLIN here, with SYLVIA, shall be blest.</L>
<L>As thus I spake, around I cast my Eye,</L>
<L>And saw celestial CELIA drawing nigh:</L>
<L>I saw; but wonder'd why her heav'nly Mien</L>
<L>Was clouded o'er, that us'd to be serene.</L>

CELIA's the Mistress of the flow'ry Plain,</L>

<L>Her pensive Aspect shew'd her pious Care;</L>
<L>And, loath th'unwelcome Tidings to reveal,</L>
<L>She sighing spoke, and left th'unfinish'd Tale:</L>

" Thy SYLVIA, O!" She said, and dropt the rest;</L>

That moral Law, which Nature had imprest,</L>

<L>How oft unhappy, striving to be great!</L>
<L>Ere CYNTHIA twice her monthly Race had run,</L>

Oft curs'd his hapless Fate, and often thought</L>

<L>How, in the Maze of Life, we act as they</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Planets sure some noxious Pow'r display,</L>
<L>And rule my Life with arbitrary Sway;</L>
<L>Else had I ne'er forsook my native Home,</L>
<L>Nor in this baleful Desert met my Doom—</L>

<L>Soft Flow'rets were their Couch; and, all around,</L>
<L>Diffusive Sweets perfum'd the fragrant Ground.</L>
<L>There oft she would his snowy Bosom bare,</L>
<L>Oft round her Fingers wind his silver Hair;</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="145"/>
Charm'd with the Contrast, which their Colours made,</L>
<L>More pleasing than the Tulip's Light and Shade.</L>
<L>Nor was the Youth insensible; but soon</L>

<L>Oft would he gaze, and languish with his Eyes:</L>
<L>Now on her panting Breast his Head repose,</L>
<L>To meet his Head her panting Breast arose;</L>

<L>Your Limbs, which now the Sun and Wind invade,</L>

<L>In gilded Houses gaily should you ride,</L>
<L>By Horses drawn, which prancing Side by Side,</L>
<L>Neigh, foam, and champ the Bit with graceful Pride;</L>
<L>Our Time, in Pomp and Peace, should slide away,</L>
<L>And blooming Pleasures crown the smiling Day;</L>
<L>And, when the setting Sun forsook the Skies,</L>
<L>Approaching Night should but increase our Joys:</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="147"/>
We would not on the chilling Ground embrace,</L>
<L>Nor Foes, as now, should interrupt our Peace;</L>
<L>But both reposing on some easy Bed,</L>
<L>Soft, as the fleecy Down, that decks thy Head,</L>
<L>The sportive God of Love should round us play,</L>
<L>While we, in Raptures, pass'd the Night away:</L>
<L>Then let us carefully, my Dear, explore</L>
<L>The Haven, where I first approach'd the Shore.</L>
<L>Perhaps we shall some floating Ship survey,</L>
<L>Safe to conduct us o'er the watry Way:</L>
<L>Nor let the foaming Waves your Steps retard;</L>
<L>I'll guard you o'er, and be a faithful Guard.</L>

<L>How oft, alas! is Innocence betray'd,</L>
<L>When Love invites, and Flatterers persuade?</L>
<L>How could the Dame, a Stranger to Deceit,</L>
<L>Imagine such a heav'nly Form a Cheat?</L>
<L>She paus'd, she sigh'd; then, with a pensive Look,</L>
<L>Half loth, and half consenting, thus she spoke:</L>

<L>ONCE has AVARO scap'd the raging Main:</L>
<L>Why would you tempt the fickle Seas again?</L>

<L>Sometimes, I own, we've been surpriz'd by Foes,</L>
<L>Whose nightly Walks have wak'd you from Repose:</L>
<L>Yet still I guard your sacred Life secure,</L>

<L>Embrac'd his Neck, and doated on his Charms:</L>

<L>In sportive Joys they clos'd the genial Day,</L>

<L>The briny Torrent flows adown her Cheeks,</L>

<L>A Robe was neatly girt about his Waist,</L>
<L>Fine as my lov'd AVARO's silken Vest;</L>
<L>His shining Lips upon my Breast he laid,</L>

<L>Where Horrors reign, and Comforts never smile:</L>
<L>Thick Brakes and Brambles choak'd the dreary Coast,</L>
<L>The only Product, which the Land could boast;</L>

The crashing Woods proclaim'd his rapid Force,</L>
<L>While two fleet Youths pursu'd the sylvan Course:</L>
<L>The Lovers started from their flow'ry Seats,</L>
<L>Surpriz'd, and each a diff'rent Way retreats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when some Musquet's Thunder has expell'd</L>

<L>Both, diverse, thro' the wide ethereal Plain</L>
<L>Fly swift; and flying, fear their Mate is slain.</L>

<L>SOON as the sportive Hunters left the Wood,</L>

<L>Both trembling met upon the op'ning Glade:</L>
<L>Mute with Surprize a-while they stood; the Man</L>
<L>Broke Silence first, and thus his Tale began:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O dear AMANDA! soon we have survey'd</L>
<L>This mystic Vision of the Night display'd:</L>
<L>These are the frowning Tyrants in thy Dream,</L>
<L>That chas'd the Slaves, and we their flying Game.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOME Part, said she, resembled this, I own;</L>
<L>And some remains a Riddle yet unknown:</L>
<L>What meant that God, which still, methinks, I view?</L>
<L>That radiant Deity! so much like You!</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="155"/>
And what the Fields above, which he propos'd?</L>
<L>Say, if the Mystery can be disclos'd.</L>

<L>To whom the Youth: Our active Fancy seems</L>
<L>For ever roving, roving most in Dreams:</L>
<L>For then the Soul, disburden'd of her Load,</L>
<L>Soars high, and grows prophetic, like a God;</L>
<L>Minds Things when past, as present to our View;</L>
<L>And, by Allusion, knows the future too.</L>
<L>Thus, when to Sleep your musing Head reclin'd,</L>
<L>She kept our Ev'ning Converse in her Mind;</L>
<L>Reflected on the Joys my Country yields,</L>
<L>Joys, sweet as those in yonder azure Fields;</L>
<L>Till, soaring higher, striving to discern</L>
<L>Her hidden Fate, and future Fortune learn,</L>
<L>Heav'n shew'd her something like this Morning Chace,</L>
<L>By trembling Slaves, who fled their Tyrant's Face;</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="156"/>
Perhaps, to warn us timely from our Bed;</L>
<L>For, O my dear AMANDA! had we stay'd,</L>

<L>Nor you, to hear the Secrets I reveal—</L>
<L>But let us to my happy Country steer,</L>
<L>Nor longer wait impending Ruin here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So spake the Youth; and, with a gracious Look,</L>
<L>He seem'd to sanctify the Words he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Go, she reply'd; go where you are inclin'd;</L>
<L>Your faithful Lover will not stay behind.</L>
<L>If o'er the Seas you shall attempt your Way,</L>
<L>The Seas shall not compel me here to stay;</L>
<L>Nor will I fear the Surges of the Deep;</L>
<L>(For Surges oft, you say, assail the Ship)</L>
<L>Calm and compos'd, intrepid, will I stand,</L>
<L>Till you conduct me to your native Land.</L>

Or, if you would some other Clime pursue,</L>
<L>Then shall some other Climate please me too.</L>

<L>With joyful Servitude, I'll still attend</L>

<L>Display the Net, or speed the pointed Dart;</L>

<L>With sweetest Flow'rets, gather'd from the Mead</L>
<L>And when, dissolv'd in downy Sleep, you lie,</L>
<L>I'll wake, and watch if Foes approach too nigh:</L>

<L>In vain the humid Pearls bedew her Cheeks;</L>
<L>In vain she tears the Laurel from her Hair,</L>

<L>Deplore her Loss in melancholy Strains.</L>
<L>Thus, pensive and uncloath'd, upon the Shore</L>
<L>She stands; and sees the Robe, which FALSHOOD wore:</L>
<L>Detested Sight! Nor longer now she mourns;</L>

<L>Into the Stream, the hellish Robe she tost;</L>

<L>Is chiefly found in lonely Fields and Cells,</L>
<L>Where Silence reigns, and Contemplation dwells.</L>

<L>WHENE'ER of Dangers in your Camp I heard,</L>
<L>Those Dangers threaten'd <HI>you,</HI> I always fear'd:</L>

<L>It feeds on tim'rous Thoughts, and anxious Cares.</L>

<L>And trembling, ever dreaded HECTOR's Name:</L>
<L>If any said, ANTILOCHUS was slain,</L>

<OPENER>To the Right Honourable the Countess of POMFRET.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>BLOWN on the rolling Surface of the Deep,</L>
<L>The mourning Maid at length reclines to Sleep;</L>
<L>While conscious Visions labour in her Breast,</L>
<L>And airy Spectres discompose her Rest.</L>
<L>Sometimes she seems upon her native Shore,</L>
<L>Bless'd with the beauteous Youth, as heretofore;</L>
<L>Hears him converse, while from his tuneful Tongue</L>
<L>Melodious Sense, in melting Music, rung:</L>
<L><PB N="254" REF="298"/>
Sometimes she finds, or seems at least to find,</L>
<L>His shatter'd Vessel forc'd before the Wind,</L>
<L>With foaming Waves, and furious Tempests tost,</L>
<L>The Mast, and broken Sails, and Sailers lost:</L>
<L>Sometimes her Dream, in frightful Forms, display'd</L>
<L>A Crowd of Martyrs, cruel <HI>Love</HI> had made;</L>
<L>Lamenting THISBE's Shade before her stands,</L>
<L>Shews her capacious Wound, and purple Hands;</L>
<L>Now Lyric SAPPHO in the Tide expires,</L>
<L>Now faithful PORCIA eats the living Fires.</L>
<L>At length, awaking from her Dream, she hears</L>
<L>A <HI>Latian</HI> Voice, which thus salutes her Ears:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UNHAPPY <HI>Christian</HI> Maid! (for such, at least,</L>
<L>You, by your decent Habit, seem exprest)</L>
<L>Say whence you came, and hither how convey'd,</L>

<L>SOON as the Nymph her native Language hears,</L>
<L>Her frighted Soul was fill'd with Doubts and Fears:</L>
<L>She thought, the adverse Wind, or refluent Main,</L>
<L>Had forc'd her back to <HI>Liparis</HI> again;</L>
<L>Till, starting up, a spacious Land she spies;</L>
<L>Barbarian Caves and Cots her Sight surprize:</L>

<L>Nor knows the Matron, nor the neighb'ring Land.</L>
<L>O! whither, whither am I blown? she cries;</L>
<L>What Dens and Caves appear before my Eyes?</L>

<L>Or Men, less kind, and crueller than they?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To whom the Matron: Fly, nor dare to trust.</L>
<L>The faithless People of this hated Coast:</L>
<L>Here Sailers oft their hapless Fate deplore;</L>
<L>Who scape the Seas, are wreck'd upon the Shore:</L>

For, when the forceful Wind, and foaming Deep,</L>

<L>By others Death, they keep themselves alive,</L>
<L>Subsist by Rapine, and by Ruin thrive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UNHAPPY Fate! the mourning Nymph reply'd;</L>
<L>O! had I perish'd in the safer Tide!</L>
<L>For much I fear, the Land I now survey,</L>
<L>Dooms me to greater Evils, than the Sea:</L>
<L>And yet what greater Ills can Fate provide,</L>
<L>Than thus to seek for Death, and be deny'd?</L>
<L>Not so my FELIX scap'd the raging Waves;</L>
<L>Him NEPTUNE sunk, and me unkindly saves;</L>
<L>Saves, only to increase my former Woes;</L>
<L>To fall, perhaps, by more ungen'rous Foes;</L>

Or to indulge some lustful Tyrant's Will:</L>

<L>THE list'ning Matron wonders with Surprize;</L>
<L>Nor hears, unmov'd, the weeping Damsel's Cries:</L>
<L>But leads her to her neighb'ring Cottage, where</L>
<L>She chears her fainting Soul with homely Fare;</L>
<L>Condoles her Grief, and begs her to disclose</L>
<L>Her Country, Cares, and Cause of all her Woes.</L>
<L>Excited by her Words, the pensive Maid</L>
<L>Preludes with Sighs, and thus, reluctant, said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O hospitable Dame! why would you move</L>
<L>A Wretch to tell a Tale of hapless Love?</L>
<L>Which, in relating, must renew my Grief;</L>

<L>Now, like a Meteor, fallen from its Height,</L>
<L>My Glory's vanish'd, and extinct my Light—</L>

<L>Young FELIX then his Love began to show;</L>
<L>(Young FELIX was the Cause of all my Woe)</L>
<L>A beauteous Youth, endow'd with manly Grace;</L>

And, tho' his niggard Fate had Wealth deny'd,</L>
<L>The Want of Wealth by Virtue was supply'd.</L>
<L>Two Years to win my doubtful Heart he strove,</L>
<L>Two Years my doubtful Heart declin'd his Love:</L>
<L>Yet still he press'd me with his am'rous Tale,</L>
<L>Nor found at length, 'twas fruitless to assail:</L>
<L>For, by degrees, insensibly I came</L>
<L>To first approve, and then indulge, his Flame;</L>
<L>Nor could his Suit, nor would his Vows reprove;</L>
<L>I heard with Joy, nor thought it Sin to love;</L>
<L>Till in my Breast imperious CUPID reign'd:</L>
<L>Alas! how easy <HI>Love</HI> a Conquest gain'd!</L>
<L>And now my Reason check'd my Will no more;</L>
<L>But fed the Flame, it strove to quench before:</L>

<L><HI>Love</HI> rul'd my <HI>Heart,</HI> but <HI>Honour</HI> rul'd my <HI>Love:</HI></L>
<L>I scorn'd to stain my Virtue with a King;</L>

What could we do? What cannot <HI>Love</HI> inspire?</L>
<L>The Youth reveals his Passion to my Sire;</L>
<L>And in such melting Accents made it known,</L>
<L>As might have mov'd all Fathers, but my own:</L>
<L>But proudly he my Lover's Suit repell'd;</L>
<L>And, frowning, thus our mutual Ruin seal'd:</L>

<L>O <HI>Avarice!</HI> what Evils dost thou cause,</L>

<L>With boasted Titles of paternal Fame,</L>
<L>Deriv'd from Ancestors of noble Blood?</L>
<L>Things common to the Vicious, and the Proud!</L>
<L>Refulgent Equipage, and gaudy Shows,</L>
<L>Fictitious Ornaments of real Woes!</L>
<L>If Love be absent, Pomp and worldly Gain</L>

<L>So speaks the trembling Nymph; and, while she speaks,</L>
<L>The pearly Torrents stream adown her Cheeks;</L>
<L><PB N="262" REF="306"/>
Cold clammy Sweats, and throbbing Sighs arise,</L>
<L>Slow moves the Blood, and dizzy roll her Eyes;</L>
<L>So much affected with her Lover's Fate,</L>
<L>She struggled, groan'd, and fainted from her Seat.</L>
<L>Her Hostess straight a grateful Cordial sought,</L>
<L>And to her Lips applies the chearful Draught,</L>
<L>Washing her Temples with reviving Oil;</L>
<L>The vital Spirits answer to her Toil;</L>
<L>The purple Tide begins to roll again,</L>
<L>Again diffuses Life thro' ev'ry Vein:</L>
<L>And now she sighing, rais'd her drooping Head;</L>
<L>And, Is my Death, she cries, again delay'd?</L>
<L>Why did you check me on the Brink of Fate?</L>
<L>Better the Soul had fled her loathsome Seat.</L>
<L>Death is the only Good I wish to know,</L>
<L>End of my Pain, and Period of my Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>To whom replies the Dame: Unhappy Fair!</L>
<L>Rely on Heav'n, nor let your Soul despair:</L>
<L>Teach me to give your troubled Heart Relief;</L>
<L>Or teach me how, at least, to share your Grief:</L>
<L>Your mournful Story much affects my Mind;</L>
<L>Yet something seems remaining still behind.</L>

<L>O! much, CONSTANTIA says, remains to come,</L>
<L>The fatal Part, that finishes my Doom:</L>

<L>Not able to obtain me for his Bride,</L>
<L>Nor willing to resign me, tho' deny'd;</L>
<L>Hope, from Despair, his daring Soul conceives;</L>
<L>A Bark he builds, to plough the briny Waves:</L>
<L>Then call'd a few Domestics to his Aid,</L>
<L>Embrac'd me in his Arms, and sighing, said:</L>

<L>O Thou, for ever dear, for ever blest,</L>
<L>At once the Joy, and Trouble of my Breast!</L>
<L>Since Poverty expels me from thy Arms,</L>
<L>Since Wealth alone is worthy of thy Charms;</L>
<L>I swear by all the mighty Pow'rs above,</L>
<L>(Sad Fate, that drives me from the Nymph I love!)</L>
<L>To try my Fortune on remoter Shores,</L>

<L>Perhaps the Planets, unpropitious here,</L>

<L>If not, the last sad Pleasure is to die.</L>
</LG>

<L>SUCH was the fatal Vow he rashly made;</L>
<L>O fatal Vow, and fatally obey'd!</L>
<L><PB N="265" REF="309"/>
Struck dumb, my Tears the want of Words supply'd;</L>
<L>His, mixt with mine, increas'd the pearly Tide:</L>
<L>Yet, lest I should his Resolution shake,</L>
<L>He rush'd away, and mounted on the Deck:</L>
<L>His hasty Crew expand the swelling Sails,</L>
<L>Strong rolls the Sea before impulsive Gales;</L>
<L>The crooked Keel the frothy Flood divides,</L>
<L>Swift flies the Ship, and rushes thro' the Tides.</L>

<LG>
<L>MY Lover long my gazing Eyes pursue;</L>
<L>As long my Lover kept me in his View:</L>
<L>Reluctant so, departing Souls prepare</L>
<L>To wing their doubtful Flight, they know not where;</L>
<L>Reluctant so, expiring Bodies lie,</L>
<L>Nor willing these to stay, nor those to fly.</L>

<LG>
<L>TWICE twenty Days I spent in fruitless Tears,</L>
<L>Before the fatal Tidings reach'd my Ears;</L>
<L><PB N="266" REF="310"/>
How FELIX, sailing o'er the watry Way,</L>
<L>Was wreck'd on Rocks, and perish'd in the Sea.</L>
<L>O! then what Trouble, Grief, and anxious Care,</L>
<L>Confus'd my Soul, and bent it to Despair!</L>
<L>I curs'd the Cause, that forc'd him to expire;</L>
<L>O Heav'n! forgive me, if I curs'd my Sire:</L>
<L>I fled his House, and sought the lonely Grove,</L>
<L>(The gloomy Witness of my former <HI>Love!</HI>)</L>
<L>Where, once resolv'd to seek the Shades below,</L>
<L>I drew the Knife, to strike the mortal Blow;</L>
<L>Till Piety the cruel Thought supprest,</L>
<L>And check'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Courage of my Breast:</L>
<L>I trembling saw two doubtful Paths; nor knew,</L>
<L>Which Path was best to shun, or which pursue;</L>
<L>Opposing Passions in my Bosom strove,</L>
<L>And <HI>Conscience</HI> now prevail'd, and now my <HI>Love.</HI></L>
</LG>

<PB N="267" REF="311"/>
<L>As when the Wind and Tide a Contest make,</L>
<L>The Sailer, trembling, sees his Vessel shake;</L>
<L>This way, and that, and both, by turns reclin'd,</L>
<L>As swells the Surge, or blows the furious Wind:</L>
<L>So was my Soul with diff'rent Notions sway'd,</L>
<L>Of this, of that, of both, and all, afraid.</L>
<L>Ah! why should Mortals of their <HI>Reason</HI> boast,</L>
<L>Which most deserts 'em, when they want it most?</L>
<L>For, when the troubled Mind's confus'd with Pain,</L>
<L>'Tis but an <HI>Ignis-fatuus</HI> of the Brain;</L>
<L>Which, if our wand'ring Souls from <HI>Virtue</HI> stray,</L>
<L>But leads us more and more from <HI>Virtue</HI>'s Way:</L>
<L>So led it me to stem the devious Tide,</L>
<L>And seek for Death, where wretched FELIX dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOT distant far, a fishing Vessel stood,</L>
<L>Nor wholly on the Land, nor in the Flood:</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="312"/>
Arriv'd to this, I row'd it from the Shore;</L>
<L>And, bent on Death, the Tide I now explore;</L>
<L>Expecting, soon, the friendly-furious Wave</L>
<L>Would give my Troubles and myself a Grave.</L>
<L>But, when I saw the Billows round me flow,</L>
<L>The boundless Skies above, and Seas below;</L>
<L>Scar'd with the Terrors of the watry Space,</L>
<L>I wrapt my Mantle round my tim'rous Face:</L>
<L>Then lay me down, to all the Dangers blind;</L>
<L><HI>Chance</HI> was my <HI>Compass,</HI> and my <HI>Pilot, Wind.</HI></L>
<L>Blown here and there, I floated on the Deep,</L>
<L>Which rock'd my Eyes, but not my Fears, asleep:</L>
<L>For now my dreaming Soul, in Fancy's Maze,</L>
<L>A thousand tragic airy Ghosts surveys;</L>
<L>Which flutter'd round me, and reproaching, said;</L>
<L>Die, Coward! follow FELIX to the Shade:</L>

<L><PB N="269" REF="313"/>
But when, at length, your friendly Voice I heard,</L>

<L>For who can conquer <HI>Love,</HI> or cure <HI>Despair?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS she; and thus CAPRESA spake again:</L>
<L>(So was she call'd, who wak'd her on the Main)</L>
<L>Unhappy Nymph! compose your troubled Mind,</L>
<L>Nor doubt the gracious Guide of human Kind:</L>
<L>That GOD, who sav'd you from the foamy Wave,</L>

<L>Vouchsafe to take the Counsel I can lend:</L>
<L>At <HI>Susa</HI> Heav'n has blest me with a Friend,</L>
<L>Much fam'd for Wealth, for pious Actions more;</L>
<L>No Husband, and no Children, but the Poor:</L>
<L>Let me conduct you to her friendly Gate;</L>
<L>(Too small my Cottage for a Guest so great)</L>
<L><PB N="270" REF="314"/>
She will protect you from <HI>Barbarian</HI> Foes,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>BLEST Partner of my Grief! the Damsel said,</L>
<L>Some Angel surely sent you to my Aid;</L>
<L>For now some dawning Rays of Hope appear,</L>
<L>That chase away the Clouds of dark Despair.</L>
<L>This Pause of Pain, and Interval of Grace,</L>

<L>Then guide, and guard me to your noble Friend;</L>
<L>So may you never want this Aid you lend!</L>
<L>And, as we travel, deign to let me know,</L>
<L>To whom so many Thanks I justly owe;</L>
<L>What hapless Fortune cast you on this Land,</L>
<L>What Occupation here employs your Hand.</L>
<L>Sweet Conversation may suspend my Care,</L>

So shall I easier reach the neighb'ring Town;</L>
<L>And, list'ning to your Fate, forget my own.</L>
</LG>

<L>THUS she; and thus the pensive Dame replies:</L>
<L>(With briny Drops distilling from her Eyes)</L>
<L>Fain would I, lovely Nymph! suspend your Care,</L>
<L>Dispel your Grief, or make it less severe:</L>
<L>But, were I all my Fortune to explain,</L>
<L>'Twould not alleviate, but increase your Pain;</L>
<L>For in your Soul such Sparks of Nature glow,</L>
<L>As make you share your Neighbour's Joy or Woe.</L>
<L>The <HI>Christian</HI> Faith I secretly embrace,</L>
<L>Tho' doom'd to dwell among a <HI>Pagan</HI> Race:</L>
<L><HI>Trepanum</HI> wasted all my Bloom of Life,</L>
<L>Where long I liv'd, a Farmer's happy Wife:</L>
<L>My careful, loving Husband till'd the Soil,</L>
<L>Nor was the Field ungrateful to his Toil:</L>
<L><PB N="272" REF="316"/>
For, ev'ry Summer, CERES crown'd the Plain;</L>
<L>Each Autumn, fill'd the Barn with golden Grain:</L>
<L>So thick the verdant Harvest yearly stood,</L>
<L>The Meadows seem'd to groan beneath their Load.</L>
<L>Our fleecy Flocks were fruitful of their Young,</L>
<L>Hail were our Oxen, and our Horses strong;</L>
<L>Nor did our Kine of milky Produce fail,</L>
<L>But with distended Udders fill'd the Pail.</L>
<L>'Twas then, alas! how often have I cry'd,</L>
<L>I would not wish to be a Monarch's Bride!</L>
<L>When all around my little Infants came,</L>
<L>Hung on my Knees, and lisp'd their <HI>Mama</HI>'s Name;</L>
<L>Or met their Father with the Ev'ning Ray,</L>
<L>Embrac'd his Neck, and kiss'd his Cares away.</L>
<L>Soon as their riper Age could Labour bear,</L>
<L>We sent 'em forth to feed the fleecy Care;</L>
<L>Where often have we spent the Summer's Day,</L>
<L>Charm'd to behold the wanton Cattle's Play.</L>
<L><PB N="273" REF="317"/>
What Pleasure 'twas to see the skipping Lambs?</L>
<L>What Music, when they bleated for their Dams?</L>
<L>We thought our Joys could never be increas'd;</L>
<L>Love, Peace, and Plenty join'd to make us bless'd.</L>
<L>But see how <HI>Fortune</HI> holds her fickle Reign!</L>
<L>She raises up, to tumble down again:</L>
<L>For now our Thread of Happiness was spun;</L>
<L>The Gains of twenty Years were lost in one.</L>
<L>'Twas in the Season, when the verdant Mead</L>
<L>Begins to ask the Mower's crooked Blade;</L>
<L>Before the Wheat receives the yellow Stain,</L>
<L>Or milky Juice is harden'd into Grain;</L>
<L>A Gale of Poison baleful EURUS cast;</L>
<L>The vernal Product sicken'd with the Blast;</L>
<L>Our Meadows straight a saffron Scene disclose,</L>
<L>Our infant Apples quit the blighted Boughs;</L>
<L>Pease, Wheat, and Barley, wither'd in the Fields,</L>
<L>And Nature one abortive Harvest yields:</L>
<L><PB N="274" REF="318"/>
Nor stopt it here; the flying Plague began</L>
<L>To spread the Bane in Beasts, and thence to Man:</L>
<L>First dy'd our Sheep upon the russet Plain,</L>
<L>Next swell'd our Oxen with a fatal Blain;</L>
<L>Here tumbles, o'er her Meat, the moping Cow;</L>
<L>There drops the panting Horse before the Plough:</L>
<L>At length the dire Contagion spread so wide,</L>
<L>My Virgin Children made the Tomb their Bride.</L>
<L>This Nature bore—But when our Landlord sent</L>
<L>His Officers, to seize my Lord for Rent;</L>
<L>And he, to shun the Prison, flies the Shore;</L>
<L>Lists on the Sea, to tug the lab'ring Oar;</L>
<L>I wept, I rav'd, I curs'd the baleful Air;</L>
<L>And fled my native Land, but not my Care.</L>
<L>Thus, banish'd here, a Widow, and a Wife,</L>
<L>Condemn'd to suffer, not enjoy a Life,</L>
<L>I toil for those, who catch the finny Prey;</L>
<L>The Toils are great, but very small the Pay!</L>
<L><PB N="275" REF="319"/>
Their scaly Fry to Market oft I bear,</L>
<L>Oft in the Ocean wash their thready Snare;</L>
<L>And then was washing, when, with great Surprize,</L>
<L>You, and your floating Vessel, met my Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW Heav'n defend us both! the Nymph reply'd;</L>
<L>And can such Rage in <HI>Christian</HI> Minds reside?</L>
<L>What, could the curst, inhuman Tyrant wrest</L>
<L>Thy tender Husband from thy loving Breast,</L>
<L>When all thy Wealth was lost, thy Children dead?</L>
<L>O <HI>Virtue! Virtue!</HI> whither art thou fled?</L>
<L>Why must such Evils on the Guiltless flow?</L>
<L>Ye Heav'ns! is Innocence rewarded so?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO spake the Nymph; her Friend no more replies;</L>
<L>For now PRISCILLA's Dome attracts their Eyes:</L>
<L>Approaching to her friendly Gate, they found</L>
<L>The gen'rous Lady dealing Alms around</L>
<L><PB N="276" REF="320"/>
To needy Souls, a hapless, helpless Crowd,</L>
<L>Who daily bless'd her Hand for daily Food!</L>
<L>When thus CAPRESA: Hail, for ever bless'd!</L>
<L>'Tis Godlike thus to succour the Distress'd:</L>
<L>Yet none of these, who claim your <HI>Christian</HI> Aid,</L>
<L>Deserves it more than this unhappy Maid;</L>
<L>Who once was bless'd with Fame and Riches too,</L>
<L>Tho' fickle Fortune now is turn'd her Foe;</L>
<L>Unlike the Mendicants, who daily share</L>
<L>Your friendly Bounty, and maternal Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO whom the Lady, with a gracious Look,</L>
<L>That seem'd to breathe Compassion, while she spoke:</L>
<L>Sure Decency forbids, a Guest so great</L>
<L>Should, undistinguish'd, with the Vulgar eat.</L>
<L>No; deck my Table with the choicest Fare;</L>
<L>The Nymph, with me, a kind Repast shall share;</L>
<L><PB N="277" REF="321"/>
For, by her Looks if Truth may be divin'd,</L>
<L>That lovely Body cloaths a lovely Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE said, and CONSTANCE low Obeisance made;</L>
<L>Then gladly follow'd, where PRISCILLA led.</L>
<L>Within the Gate a spacious Room she found,</L>
<L>Whose Walls were beautify'd with Tap'stry round;</L>
<L>Where pious Tales appear'd, so lively wrought,</L>
<L>The Work seem'd vital, and the Figures Thought:</L>
<L>Here, in the Shade, the <HI>Jewish</HI> Patriarch stood,</L>
<L>Feasting the Sons of Heav'n with earthly Food;</L>
<L>While, there, the good <HI>Samaritan</HI> confest</L>
<L>His Kindness, and reproach'd the cruel <HI>Priest</HI>;</L>
<L>With many more, a charitable Band,</L>
<L>The skilful Labour of PRISCILLA's Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HITHER the Dame convey'd a sweet Repast;</L>
<L>Rich Meats, and rosy Wines the Table grac'd:</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="322"/>
They eat, they drank, in pleasing Converse join'd;</L>
<L>And chear'd at once the Body and the Mind.</L>
<L>The Call of Nature being soon supprest,</L>
<L>Thus spake the Lady to her youthful Guest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAY, lovely Stranger! (for I long to know;</L>
<L>So may propitious Heav'n remove thy Woe!)</L>
<L>Whence thus reduc'd? By Famine, Sword, or Fire?</L>
<L>What Sire thy Beauty boasts, what Land thy Sire?</L>
<L>Perhaps some Princess, banish'd from her Home,</L>
<L>Thus condescends to grace my rustic Dome:</L>
<L>If so, I greatly fear, my homely Feast</L>
<L>Has been unworthy of my Royal Guest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE said, the Nymph unfolds her Tale again;</L>
<L>The prudent Dame attempts to sooth her Pain,</L>
<L>And thus reply'd: Tho' weighty are your Woes,</L>
<L>The weightiest Ill, with Patience, lighter grows:</L>
<L><PB N="279" REF="323"/>
Then bear with Patience all that Heav'n design'd,</L>
<L>Whose Ways are just, tho' difficult to find,</L>
<L>Plann'd for the gen'ral Good of Human Kind.</L>
<L>God's Paths in winding Mazes often lie,</L>
<L>Too intricate for feeble Reason's Eye;</L>
<L>Most regular, when in Confusion lost;</L>
<L>Most constant, when they seem to vary most.</L>
<L>Perhaps his Mercy forc'd you thus to roam,</L>
<L>To shun a more unhappy Fate at home;</L>
<L>For with one Evil he removes a worse,</L>
<L>And blesses oft with what we think a Curse.</L>
<L>Then let your Soul at Fortune not repine;</L>
<L>But trust in Heav'n's Protection, next, in mine:</L>
<L>In me you still shall find a faithful Friend,</L>
<L>With whom, in time, your Troubles all may end:</L>
<L>But, since you now are harass'd out with Woes,</L>
<L>Refresh your weary Soul with sweet Repose;</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="324"/>
And when you wake, at Morning, may you find</L>
<L>Heav'n's balmy Comfort heal your wounded Mind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS chear'd, the Nymph obsequiously withdrew,</L>
<L>And bath'd her Cares in Sleep's refreshing Dew;</L>
<L>Till PHOEBUS, rising from the Shades of Night,</L>
<L>With rosy Keys unlock'd the Gates of Light:</L>
<L>Bright as his Beams, arose the beauteous Maid;</L>
<L>And, to her Patroness returning, said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT Thanks, propitious Lady! shall I give</L>
<L>For all the Godlike Bounties I receive?</L>
<L>O! let my <HI>Silence</HI> thank you; for I know,</L>
<L><HI>Words</HI> can't express the Gratitude I owe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To whom replies the venerable Dame:</L>
<L>No other Thanks, but Gratitude, I claim:</L>
<L><PB N="281" REF="325"/>
The Terms of Charity are never hard,</L>
<L>Love and Compassion are their own Reward:</L>
<L>A Soul, that succours Virtue, when distrest,</L>
<L>Can with Reflection make a noble Feast;</L>
<L>Which nourishes the Mind, and overpays</L>
<L>A gen'rous Deed with self-approving Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SUCH was their Converse, till domestic Care</L>
<L>Invites PRISCILLA from the youthful Fair;</L>
<L>Who sat in pensive Solitude, and strove</L>
<L>To soften, or suspend the Pains of Love.</L>
<L>At length the Linen on her Knee she spread,</L>
<L>And with her Needle work'd the docile Thread.</L>
<L>Young THISBE's Fate she first began to frame;</L>
<L>But soon commits her Labour to the Flame:</L>
<L>Next drew she HERO sinking in the Main;</L>
<L>Then raz'd the finish'd Image out again:</L>
<L><PB N="282" REF="326"/>
Both these displeas'd her, tho' judicious Art,</L>
<L>And Rays of Nature shone in ev'ry Part.</L>
<L>At length her own unhappy Tale she chose,</L>
<L>And lively paints the Scene of all her Woes:</L>
<L>Her charming FELIX first the Linen grac'd;</L>
<L>By whom her Father, frowning stern, she plac'd:</L>
<L>Her Lover's Parting next to these appears;</L>
<L>(But, weeping here, she soil'd her Work with Tears)</L>
<L>Next, on the Seas, she drew her floating Ship;</L>
<L>Next, her own Boat, slow-wand'ring o'er the Deep:</L>
<L>By these she fix'd CAPRESA on the Strand,</L>
<L>Who wak'd her first, and welcom'd her to Land:</L>
<L>The good PRISCILLA last employ'd her Art,</L>
<L>Whose Aspect spoke the Bounty of her Heart;</L>
<L>Her friendly Roof, a Refuge for the Poor,</L>
<L>The Horn of Plenty, pendent o'er the Door,</L>
<L>Diffusing Blessings still, and still increasing more.</L>
<L><PB N="283" REF="327"/>
All these confest such Beauty, Skill, and Care,</L>
<L>Not HELEN better wove the <HI>Trojan</HI> War,</L>
<L>While HECTOR, PARIS, and their Martial Train,</L>
<L>With <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes battled on the Plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE let us leave the lovely Nymph a-while,</L>
<L>To pass her tedious Hours in pleasing Toil:</L>
<L>Her absent Lover now my Song pursues,</L>
<L>Whose valiant Deeds require a nobler Muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SWIFT-PINION'D FAME, which often babbling flies,</L>
<L>To bear unwelcome Truths, and oft'ner Lyes,</L>
<L>Had spread the ductile Error far and wide,</L>
<L>How wand'ring FELIX perish'd in the Tide.</L>
<L>But FELIX safely reach'd the <HI>Thunic</HI> Port,</L>
<L>And soon arriv'd to Honours in the Court:</L>
<L>His Wisdom there the wisest Peers excell'd;</L>
<L>His Valour more surpass'd 'em in the Field.</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="328"/>
When first he to the Royal Palace came,</L>
<L>An Accident occurr'd to raise his Fame:</L>
<L>A noble Lord there was, of great Renown,</L>
<L>Rebell'd against the King, and claim'd his Crown:</L>
<L>Great Preparations made he for the Fight;</L>
<L>Nor less the Monarch, to defend his Right;</L>
<L>But summon'd all, to meet the daring Foe,</L>
<L>Whose Strength could wield a Sword, or bend a Bow;</L>
<L>And promis'd to reward their Martial Care,</L>
<L>With Honours equal to their Deeds in War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now rings the Region with the Foe's Alarms,</L>
<L>Terrific shines the Field with burnish'd Arms;</L>
<L>The Martial Trumpet, sounding from afar,</L>
<L>With dreadful Notes, proclaims approaching War.</L>
<L>The Royal Army valiant FELIX join'd;</L>
<L>Intrepid Courage animates his Mind:</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="329"/>
Fix'd in the Front, the Foe he bravely dares,</L>
<L>Like PALLAS prudent, and as bold as MARS.</L>
<L>Say, Muse, What Goddess, that tremendous Hour,</L>
<L>Aided the Youth with such unusual Pow'r?</L>
<L>Bright VENUS, conscious of the Lover's Smart,</L>
<L>Sharpen'd his Sword, and pointed ev'ry Dart:</L>
<L>Fierce, as a Lion, thro' the Lines he sprung;</L>
<L>And forc'd his Foes, like trembling Stags, along.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when resistless Winds rush o'er the Deep,</L>
<L>And from its Anchor force the driving Ship,</L>
<L>Or furiously against the Woodland roar;</L>
<L>The leafy Harvest, tumbling, flies before:</L>
<L>So rush'd the Hero on the adverse Band,</L>
<L>So fled the Legions from his pow'rful Hand;</L>
<L>Till soon the rebel Lord he Pris'ner made,</L>
<L>And to the King his captive Prize convey'd</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="286" REF="330"/>
<L>Now reaps the Youth the Glory of his Toil;</L>
<L>To him the Monarch gives the Martial Spoil,</L>
<L>Rewards his Valour with a noble Post,</L>
<L>And makes him First Commander of his Host.</L>
<L>Thus, quickly FELIX gain'd a deathless Name;</L>
<L>Thus, was his Labour crown'd with Wealth and Fame:</L>
<L>But Wealth and Fame insipid Things appear;</L>
<L>To give them Taste, he wants the lovely Fair;</L>
<L>The lovely Fair, opprest with equal Grief,</L>
<L>To make her happy, wants the glorious Chief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIS Fame, which soon at <HI>Susa</HI> was reveal'd,</L>
<L>(Heroic Actions seldom lie conceal'd)</L>
<L>With pleasing Wonder struck CONSTANTIA's Ears,</L>
<L>And fill'd her doubtful Soul with Hopes and Fears:</L>
<L>For, tho' the wise PRISCILLA often strove</L>
<L>With prudent Counsel to suppress her Love;</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="331"/>
Her Love was only lessen'd, not supprest;</L>
<L>But glows again, again distracts her Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS when, in rural Cots, the Flames aspire,</L>
<L>And lab'ring Peasants quench the mounting Fire:</L>
<L>If chance a latent Spark remain behind,</L>
<L>In heapy Ashes, fann'd with ambient Wind;</L>
<L>The Fires again, with former Fury, rise,</L>
<L>Flame thro' the Roof, and flash into the Skies:</L>
<L>So in her Bosom glows the am'rous Fire,</L>
<L>And fills her tender Soul with soft Desire.</L>
<L>And is my FELIX yet alive? she says;</L>
<L>And is he crown'd with Wealth, and deathless Praise?</L>
<L>No, no; I fear the flatt'ring Tale deceives;</L>
<L>Methinks I see him plunging in the Waves.</L>
<L>Ah! why, ye Heav'ns, are feeble Mortals curst,</L>
<L>In Things uncertain, to believe the worst?</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="332"/>
No; rather let me seek the <HI>Thunic</HI> Court;</L>
<L>There, with my Eyes, confirm the blest Report:</L>
<L><HI>Hope</HI> flies before, and points the pleasing Way;</L>
<L><HI>Love</HI> urges on, and <HI>Love</HI> I must obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO saying, to PRISCILLA straight she came,</L>
<L>And with her Thoughts acquaints the pious Dame;</L>
<L>The pious Dame, with tender Pity sway'd,</L>
<L>Approves the Passion of the loving Maid;</L>
<L>And, with CAPRESA, guards her to the Place,</L>
<L>Resolv'd herself to view the Hero's Face.</L>
<L>The Hero meets 'em at the Regal Gate,</L>
<L>Array'd in Armour, formidably great;</L>
<L>For on that Morning, by the King's Command,</L>
<L>The Chief was to review the Martial Band:</L>
<L>His studded Chariot darted Splendor round,</L>
<L>His stately Coursers, neighing, paw'd the Ground;</L>
<L><PB N="289" REF="333"/>
The nodding Plumes around his Temples wave,</L>
<L>With awful Grace, and beautifully brave.</L>
<L>He knew th'approaching Nymph; but, in Surprize,</L>
<L>The joyous Stream descended from his Eyes:</L>
<L>The Nymph beheld the weeping Chief; nor knew,</L>
<L>For what he wept, nor whom she came to view:</L>
<L>His Martial Dress, bespangled o'er with Gold,</L>
<L>The dreadful <HI>Warrior,</HI> not the <HI>Lover,</HI> told:</L>
<L>But, when he cast the Helmet from his Head,</L>
<L>And thro' the Gates the blushing Damsel led;</L>
<L>She knew her Lover, clasp'd him to her Breast,</L>
<L>While silent Eloquence her Joy confest:</L>
<L>The conscious Pains an absent Lover bears,</L>
<L><HI>Despair,</HI> fallacious <HI>Hope,</HI> and anxious <HI>Fears,</HI></L>
<L>For want of Words, were painted with their Tears.</L>
<L>And when, at length, their crystal Sluices ceas'd,</L>
<L>The joyful Hero thus the Nymph address'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="290" REF="334"/>
<L>YE Gods! and have I then my Charmer found?</L>
<L>And are my Labours thus completely crown'd!</L>
<L>Yes! let me clasp thee to my longing Arms,</L>
<L>Drink in thy Breath, and feed upon thy Charms.</L>
<L>As widow'd Turtles, roving round the Fields,</L>
<L>Thro' all the fruitful Stores, which Nature yields,</L>
<L>Curst in the midst of Plenty, cannot eat;</L>
<L>But starve, lamenting for their absent Mate:</L>
<L>Thus have I been with Fame and Riches grac'd;</L>
<L>Yet wanted thee, to give my Riches Taste.</L>
<L>But say, how came this <HI>Wealth</HI> I wanted most?</L>
<L>What brought my <HI>Love</HI> to this <HI>Barbarian</HI> Coast?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said; and now the joyful Damsel spake</L>
<L>The Dangers which she suffer'd for his sake;</L>
<L>Shews him the Dame, who found her on the Tide;</L>
<L>PRISCILLA too, who all her Wants supply'd:</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="335"/>
Then, prostrate, on her Knees before him bends,</L>
<L>And begs him to reward her faithful Friends.</L>
<L>The grateful Chief, by native Goodness sway'd,</L>
<L>Embrac'd 'em both, and soon the Nymph obey'd;</L>
<L>But first before his Royal Master came,</L>
<L>And begs he may resign his Post of Fame:</L>
<L>At which the Monarch frowns with awful Eyes,</L>
<L>Till FELIX straight, who saw his Passion rise,</L>
<L>Falls on the Ground, and to his Master shows</L>
<L>The various Scene of all his am'rous Woes.</L>
<L>This heard, the King resumes his former Grace;</L>
<L>Love tun'd his Soul, and smooth'd his ruffled Face:</L>
<L>He rais'd the Hero, bids the Nymph appear;</L>
<L>The Nymph approach'd him with a modest Fear;</L>
<L>Before his awful Throne, submiss, she fell,</L>
<L>And to him straight unfolds th'amazing Tale.</L>
<L>Mute, on the Ground a-while he fix'd his Eyes;</L>
<L>Then, Is the Force of <HI>Love</HI> so great? he cries:</L>
<L><PB N="292" REF="336"/>
We falsely <HI>Man</HI> the World's Commander call;</L>
<L><HI>Thou,</HI> mightier Monarch, <HI>Love!</HI> commandest All:</L>
<L>Young AMMON's Self could not thy Pow'r confine;</L>
<L>The <HI>World his</HI> Subject was, but <HI>He</HI> was <HI>thine.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN, smiling, thus he chear'd the trembling Fair:</L>
<L>Henceforward, lovely Nymph, dismiss thy Care;</L>
<L>For, since thy Love has conquer'd Wind and Sea,</L>
<L>Curst be the King, that's crueller than they!</L>
<L>Let HYMEN straight confirm the Marriage Ties;</L>
<L>Thou justly hast deserv'd the Nuptial Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS said, he crown'd the Hero's Martial Care,</L>
<L>With Riches far superior to the Fair:</L>
<L>Due Thanks return'd, they to PRISCILLA came,</L>
<L>Bestowing Gifts and Honours on the Dame:</L>
<L>CAPRESA next, with Age and Labour worn,</L>
<L>In comely Robes the grateful Pair adorn;</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="337"/>
With ample Wealth her former Bliss restor'd,</L>
<L>And from the Seas redeem'd her Nuptial Lord;</L>
<L>Her Nuptial Lord again enjoys his Wife,</L>
<L>Again delightful Freedom crowns his Life;</L>
<L>Till <HI>Nature</HI> calls him to resign his Breath,</L>
<L>In honourable Age, and peaceful Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS done, the loving Couple quit the Shore,</L>
<L>And joyfully the destin'd Port explore;</L>
<L>While sportive NEREIDS round their Vessel play,</L>
<L>And wanton CUPIDS hail 'em on their Way;</L>
<L>Rough THETIS' Self assumes a pleasing Smile,</L>
<L>Glad to return 'em to their native Soil;</L>
<L>Where sacred HYMEN join'd their mutual Hands,</L>

<OPENER>To the Right Hon. the Lord Viscount PALMERSTON.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>IF we, my Lord, with easy Strife,</L>
<L>Would pass this fickle Tide of Life;</L>
<L>We must not always rashly sail</L>
<L>With ev'ry light, inconstant Gale;</L>
<L>Nor yet, at ev'ry Surge that roars,</L>
<L>Too tim'rous, seek the craggy Shores.</L>
<L>The Man who keeps the <HI>Golden Mean,</HI></L>
<L>Where raging Storms are seldom seen,</L>
<L><PB N="296" REF="340"/>
Avoids the dang'rous Rocks and Pools,</L>
<L>That fright the Wise, and swallow Fools:</L>
<L>He's ne'er despis'd among the Crowd,</L>
<L>Nor envy'd in the Court;</L>
<L>But steers between the Base and Proud,</L>
<L>To gain the peaceful Port.</L>
<L>While lofty Spires and Cedars fall,</L>
<L>Storm-beaten, to the Plain,</L>
<L>The lowly Shrub, and humble Wall,</L>
<L>Are Proof to Wind and Rain;</L>
<L>And Lightnings guiltless o'er the Cottage fly;</L>
<L>But smite th'ambitious Hills, that, tow'ring, threat the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE steady Mind, that's truly great,</L>
<L>Surveys, unmov'd, the Turns of Fate:</L>
<L>If Wealth and Fame his Pride increase,</L>
<L>His Fears their Force controul;</L>
<L>If adverse Fortune would depress,</L>
<L>Hope elevates his Soul:</L>
<L><PB N="297" REF="341"/>
Because he knows, the Pow'r who brings</L>
<L>The Winter with its dreary Wings,</L>
<L>Can make the vernal Beauties grow,</L>
<L>And turn our Woe to Bliss, or Bliss to Woe.</L>
<L>If now on anxious Cares you feed,</L>
<L>A Feast of Joy may soon succeed,</L>
<L>To chear your pensive Mind.</L>
<L>With Times, our Tempers vary round,</L>
<L>Nothing immutable is found,</L>
<L>But all to Change inclin'd.</L>
<L>Tho' POPE with Illness oft complains,</L>
<L>POPE is not always rack'd with Pains;</L>
<L>But, warm'd with PHOEBUS' Fire,</L>
<L>Sometimes he wakes the sleeping String,</L>
<L>Or bids the silent Muses sing,</L>
<L>And charms us with his Lyre.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="298" REF="342"/>
<L>OUR Life's, at best, a chequer'd Scene</L>
<L>Of Health and Sickness, Mirth and Spleen:</L>
<L>Yet, since we all must stem this Sea,</L>
<L>Where Calm and Tempest dwell;</L>
<L>Grieve not to steer the destin'd Way,</L>
<L>But strive to pass it well:</L>
<L>If adverse Storms begin to rave,</L>
<L>Serenely view the foamy Wave,</L>
<L>Collected in yourself, and resolutely brave.</L>
<L>Or, if you find indulgent Gales</L>
<L>Impel the Bark too fast,</L>
<L>Wisely contract the swelling Sails,</L>
<L>And check their rapid Haste;</L>
<L>Lest, in your swift Career, the Ship</L>
<L>Split on a Rock, and sink beneath the Deep.</L>

<L>BELIEVE me, Sir, your Cost and Cares,</L>

<L>O STANLEY, STANLEY! Gold has Pow'r</L>
<L>The sternest Heart to move,</L>
<L>To burst the Wall, or pierce the Tow'r,</L>
<L>Impervious ev'n to JOVE.</L>
<L>Gold can the subtlest Head deceive,</L>

<L>Buy Votes, raise <HI>Gallic</HI> Arms, and give</L>
<L>The <HI>Polanders</HI> a King.</L>

<L>Whence some Historians say, 'twas <HI>this,</HI></L>
<L>And not young AMMON's Father, conquer'd <HI>Greece.</HI></L>
<L>Gold has an absolute Command;</L>
<L>It rules at Sea, as well as Land:</L>
<L>For, when two adverse Fleets engage,</L>
<L>And firy Tubes displode their Rage;</L>
<L>A Bribe can make their Thunder cease,</L>

<L>For most have learn'd the <HI>Grecian</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BIAS in CICERO <HI>de Amic.</HI> § 16.</NOTE>Sage's Text,</L>
<L>"To love one Day, as if to hate the next."</L>
<L><PB N="317" REF="361"/>
They change, forsake, as serves their selfish Ends,</L>
<L>Nor are their Dresses vary'd more than Friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU therefore, who are worthy Friendship's Name,</L>
<L>And cherish in your Breast the genuine Flame,</L>
<L>Attend to what a faithful Muse imparts,</L>
<L>A Muse unpractis'd in fallacious Arts:</L>
<L>Tho' young in Life, that Life has made her know,</L>
<L>A friendly Aspect oft conceals a Foe;</L>
<L>That, tho' so many seeming Friends abound,</L>
<L>For one that's true, a thousand false are found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first you strive a faithful Friend to find,</L>
<L>Explore the secret Motives of his Mind;</L>
<L>Nor, rashly credulous, his Friendship trust,</L>
<L>Before you know, what Passion rules him most:</L>
<L>But, as a Horseman checks the Courser's Speed,</L>
<L>Till he has try'd the Temper of his Steed;</L>
<L><PB N="318" REF="362"/>
So check the Reins of Friendship, till you prove,</L>
<L>What sways the Person, Interest, or Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AVOID the Fop impertinently vain,</L>
<L>And shun the Slave, who flatters you for Gain;</L>
<L>Beware of him, who sells you for a Jest;</L>
<L>But, most of all, beware the leaky Breast:</L>
<L>(Who hopes to keep his Wine the Season round,</L>
<L>Must first be sure his Cask is sweet and sound)</L>
<L>Nor should a formal Fool your Friendship claim,</L>
<L>Tho' Wealth and Honours dignify his Name.</L>
<L>Let Knaves and Fools in kindred Vices join;</L>
<L>Chuse you a Friend, where Sense and Virtue shine;</L>
<L>Whose Passions move by Reason's Rule alone,</L>
<L>Much better, if agreeing with your own.</L>
<L>The Hart and Lion at a Distance keep;</L>
<L>Wolves company with Wolves, and Sheep with Sheep:</L>
<L><PB N="319" REF="363"/>
So we, by Nature's sympathetic Pow'rs,</L>
<L>Most love those Tempers, that resemble ours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET, if it be too difficult to find</L>
<L>A Friend so justly moulded to your Mind,</L>
<L>Among the virtuous Few select the best;</L>
<L>And such is he, whose Failings are the least:</L>
<L>Let him a modest Freedom always claim,</L>
<L>To praise your Virtues, or your Vices blame;</L>
<L>Nor be displeas'd his mild Reproof to hear;</L>
<L>For Friends may often kindly be severe;</L>
<L>The Best sometimes each other may controul,</L>
<L>Yet not destroy the Harmony of Soul.</L>
<L>Rough Notes in Music never should be found,</L>
<L>Except adapted to improve the Sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN mutual Faith the friendly Knot has ty'd,</L>
<L>And when that mutual Faith is truly try'd,</L>
<L><PB N="320" REF="364"/>
Prey not upon yourself; nor be opprest</L>
<L>With conscious Pains, that struggle in your Breast:</L>
<L>For, as the Flames, in <HI>Aetna</HI> closely pent,</L>
<L>Convulse the Mountain, lab'ring for a Vent;</L>
<L>Thus in the Soul uneasy Thoughts confin'd,</L>
<L>For want of Passage, rack the suff'ring Mind.</L>
<L>Unveil your Bosom to your other Part;</L>
<L>Your Friend shall share the Burden of your Heart,</L>
<L>Alleviate ev'ry Ill your Soul sustains,</L>
<L>Double your Pleasures, and divide your Pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BE zealous for your Friends, whene'er you know</L>
<L>Their Reputation censur'd by a Foe;</L>
<L>Nor with a faint Excuse degrade your Friends;</L>
<L>The Man, who coldly praises, discommends.</L>
<L>Or are they justly censur'd for a Crime?</L>
<L>Reprove them mildly at some proper Time:</L>
<L><PB N="321" REF="365"/>
In private chide all Failings which you find,</L>
<L>In public praise the Beauties of their Mind;</L>
<L>Place all their Virtues in the clearest Light,</L>
<L>Omit their Faults, or touch them very slight;</L>
<L>As Painters, when they draw a beauteous Face,</L>
<L>Contract a Blemish, heighten ev'ry Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEITHER let Passion, Pride, or private Ends,</L>
<L>Or changing Fortune, make you change your Friends.</L>
<L>Who varies oft, a faithless Temper shows,</L>
<L>Or, at the best, ill Judgment, when he chose.</L>
<L>Some Persons with themselves so disagree,</L>
<L>They're fix'd to nothing but Inconstancy;</L>
<L>With each new Day, new Resolutions come,</L>
<L>Expel the former, and usurp their Room:</L>
<L>Succeeding Billows thus the foremost throng,</L>
<L>Tides roll on Tides, and Waves urge Waves along.</L>
<L><PB N="322" REF="366"/>
Not but we may with a new Friend engage,</L>
<L>Before we see an old one quit the Stage;</L>
<L>Yet should not think the new our old exceeds,</L>
<L>As <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ut equis vetulis teneros anteponere solemus—Veterrima quaeque (ut ea vina, quae vetustatem ferunt) esse debent suavissima. <BIBL>Cic. de Amic. § 19.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>Jockeys value most their youngest Steeds.</L>
<L>One Maxim will in Wine and Friendship hold,</L>
<L>Alike the better both for being old.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT must we then be bound in deathless Bands,</L>
<L>And still obey whate'er a Friend commands?</L>
<L>Aid him to gain what he unjustly craves?</L>
<L>No—Leave the Man, who Truth and Virtue leaves.</L>
<L>Should furious CATILINE some Plot devise,</L>
<L>To ruin Thousands, that himself might rise;</L>
<L>The Laws of Honour, Truth, and Conscience show,</L>
<L>'Tis Friendship to the World to be his Foe.</L>
<L>Or, should a Friend basely betray his Trust,</L>
<L>To pardon him were to yourself unjust:</L>
<L><PB N="323" REF="367"/>
For, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Neque amissos colores</L>

<L>Nec vera virtus, cum semel excidit,</L>

<L>Never acquires its native Whiteness more;</L>
<L>So he who breaks his Faith, will ne'er obtain</L>

<L>If otherwise he disoblige his Friends,</L>
<L>(For where's the perfect Man, who ne'er offends?)</L>
<L>Try if his Ear will kind Reproof endure;</L>
<L>And, if the Balm of Counsel work a Cure,</L>
<L>O'erlook the Failure: All <HI>offend,</HI> that <HI>live</HI>;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Foes</HI> resent a Trespass, <HI>Friends</HI> forgive.</L>
<L>Yet let the pardon'd Friend not, many times,</L>
<L>Proceed in Folly, and repeat his Crimes.</L>
<L>Tho' purest Gold a vast Extent will bear,</L>
<L>Yet purest Gold will break, if stretch'd too far:</L>
<L>And Friends may bear some Slips from Wisdom's Rule;</L>

<L>And keeps his Votaries, in Plenty, poor:</L>

<L>OTHERS there are, induc'd by Thirst of Praise,</L>

<L>Who quit their Friends for Honours of the State,</L>
<L>And turn their Love into the rankest Hate.</L>
<L><PB N="325" REF="369"/>
Nor is it wonder these desert their Friends,</L>
<L>Since all are Foes, who will not serve their Ends:</L>

<L>Which, when obstructed, climbs th'opposing Shores;</L>

<L>Swells o'er the Banks, and foams along the Plains.</L>
<L>Not but we may an honest Fame embrace;</L>
<L>Nay, Friends should aid us in the glorious Chace.</L>
<L>Man has some Principle of heav'nly Fire,</L>
<L>That warms his Breast, and prompts him to aspire;</L>
<L>Wakes him to Actions of superior Kind,</L>
<L>And keeps alive the Faculties of Mind;</L>
<L>For Sloth begets a Lethargy of Soul,</L>
<L>As want of Motion taints the clearest Pool:</L>
<L>Yet, if, too fond and covetous of Fame,</L>

<L>O! grant me, gracious Heav'n, where-e'er I go,</L>

<L>Nor let me pant so much for empty Praise,</L>

<L>HE who is only learn'd in Books, will find</L>
<L>A harder Lesson, when he learns Mankind;</L>
<L>A Volume gilded o'er with smiling Art,</L>
<L>Where few can read the Meaning of the Heart.</L>
<L>We often take our Flatterers for Friends;</L>
<L>One would suspect the Man who still commends,</L>
<L>Who, like the Sharper in the <HI>Roman</HI> Play,</L>
<L>Or right or wrong, assents to all you say;</L>
<L>Bends here or there, which way his Lord's inclin'd,</L>

Detest the Wretch, who ne'er can Courage find</L>
<L>To speak the genuine Dictates of his Mind;</L>
<L>But, like the <HI>Syrens</HI> sweet, pernicious Song,</L>
<L>At once would charm and ruin with his Tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET some there are, in social Bands ally'd,</L>
<L>Who, with blunt Truths, err on the other Side;</L>
<L>Void of Good-nature, and Good-breeding too,</L>
<L>They sourly censure ev'ry thing you do.</L>
<L>O! never flatter ev'n a Monarch's Pride,</L>
<L>Nor, with the Sternness of a <HI>Cynic,</HI> chide;</L>
<L>But, when you would an erring Friend reprove,</L>
<L>Let gentle Cautions shew, the Motive's Love:</L>
<L>Do not begin with Rashness to exclaim;</L>
<L>But rather hint the Fault, before you blame.</L>
<L>'Tis not enough your Admonition's just;</L>
<L>Prudence must guide it, or the Labour's lost:</L>
<L><PB N="329" REF="373"/>
Friends should allure, and charm us into Sense;</L>
<L>Harsh Counsels not reform, but give Offence.</L>
<L>Nature, impatient of severe Reproof,</L>
<L>Loves mild Instruction, but abhors the rough:</L>
<L>As Fruits and Flow'rs improve with gentle Rain;</L>
<L>But fade, if rapid Storms o'erflow the Plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOME Men are Friends, when Fortune fills the Sails,</L>
<L>And wafts you on with favourable Gales;</L>
<L>But quit the tott'ring Ship, and make to Shore,</L>
<L>When Storms descend, and adverse Surges roar.</L>
<L>Long as in <HI>Credit, Pow'r,</HI> or <HI>Place</HI> you stand,</L>
<L>Their fawning, formal Friendship you command:</L>
<L>With twenty <HI>Squeezes,</HI> and a hundred <HI>Bows,</HI></L>
<L>As many <HI>Compliments,</HI> as many <HI>Vows,</HI></L>
<L>They swear your Interest shall be their own,</L>
<L>And wish the Time to make it better known;</L>
<L><PB N="330" REF="374"/>
Like false hot Coursers, waiting for the Chace,</L>
<L>Which foam, and neigh, and proudly spurn the Grass,</L>
<L>Intent to run; but droop their jaded Crest,</L>
<L>And fail you most, when most you want their Haste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WE make a Prostitute of <HI>Friendship</HI>'s Name,</L>
<L>If only <HI>Complaisance</HI> supports our Claim.</L>
<L>And yet there are, of this polite Degree,</L>
<L>Who treat you still with <HI>forc'd Civility</HI>;</L>
<L>In each obliging Art so well refin'd,</L>
<L>Tho' ever false, they never seem unkind.</L>
<L>Not that my Muse would Decency offend;</L>
<L>For 'tis Good-breeding polishes a Friend:</L>
<L>Nor shines it less, with <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> join'd,</L>
<L>Than comely Features with a noble Mind:</L>
<L>But those, whose Friendships most in Speeches dwell,</L>
<L>Neglect the Fruit, and trifle with the Shell.</L>
<L><PB N="331" REF="375"/>
True Friendship more intrinsic Worth affords,</L>
<L>Defin'd by Actions better than by Words;</L>
<L>A warm Affection, that can never cool,</L>
<L>Concord of Mind, and Music of the Soul;</L>
<L>Which tunes the jarring Strings of Life to Love,</L>
<L>Shews Men below, how Angels live above.</L>
<L>There are in Friendship such attractive Charms,</L>
<L>It draws Esteem from those it never warms.</L>
<L>See how <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Qui clamores tota cavea nuper in hospitis &amp; amici mci M.

<L>ORESTES now displays the friendly Cheat,</L>
<L>Invites the threat'ning Sword, and courts his Fate.</L>
<L><PB N="332" REF="376"/>
Mov'd with their gen'rous Love, the Audience rose;</L>
<L>With social Flame each changing Bosom glows;</L>
<L>All feel the sacred Pow'r of <HI>Friendship</HI>'s Laws,</L>
<L>And the Stage rocks, and thunders with Applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I know the Muse may give to some Offence,</L>
<L>(Tho' rather Men of Wit, than Men of Sense)</L>
<L>Whose Counsel is; "Be not engag'd too far;</L>
<L>" The greatest Friendship brings the greatest Care:</L>
<L>" Our own Concerns have Plagues enough in Store;</L>
<L>" Who joins in Friendship, only makes 'em more:</L>
<L>" The Cares and Troubles, which your Friend endures,</L>
<L>" Are all by Sympathy adopted yours."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT base, ungen'rous, selfish Souls are these?</L>
<L>Mere Quacks, who turn ev'n Health into Disease;</L>
<L>And but the darkest Side of Friendship find,</L>
<L>To all its radiant Beams and Beauties blind.</L>
<L><PB N="333" REF="377"/>
Two faithful Friends, in any State, may gain</L>
<L>Comfort to heighten Joy, or lessen Pain:</L>
<L>If weighty Cares the pensive Mind invade,</L>
<L>They make the Burden light with mutual Aid;</L>
<L>If Profit, or if Pleasure chears the Soul,</L>
<L>The Blessing's common, each enjoys the whole:</L>
<L>If Bus'ness calls them to some distant Place,</L>
<L>Swift-pinion'd Love contracts the lengthen'd Space;</L>
<L>Each keeps the other's Image in his Breast,</L>
<L>As Wax preserves the Form a Seal imprest.</L>

<L>HAIL, sacred <HI>Friendship!</HI> by whose chearing Ray</L>
<L>All Joys increase, without it fade away:</L>
<L>Ev'n HYMEN's <HI>Torch,</HI> tho' burning e'er so bright,</L>
<L>Aided by <HI>Friendship,</HI> shines with double Light.</L>
<L>This you, OCELIA! by Experience find,</L>
<L>Whose <HI>nuptial Friend</HI> lives always in your Mind:</L>
<L><PB N="334" REF="378"/>
No Length of Time, no Distance, ever ras'd</L>
<L>His lov'd Idea from your tender Breast:</L>
<L>Your friendly Flame admits of no Decays;</L>
<L>But glows, unclouded, with augmented Rays,</L>
<L>And makes your bridal Lamp much brighter blaze.</L>
<L>That faint, pale, languid Lamp, in Age, expires,</L>
<L>Except 'tis fed with Friendship's constant Fires:</L>
<L>These to the <HI>Winter</HI> of our Years extend;</L>
<L>And, when the <HI>Lover</HI> cools, they warm the <HI>Friend.</HI></L>
<L>When all the transient <HI>Joys</HI> of Youth are o'er,</L>
<L>When all the <HI>Charms</HI> of Beauty <HI>charm</HI> no more;</L>
<L>Surviving <HI>Friendship</HI> gives us fresh Supplies</L>
<L>Of lasting Bliss, and more substantial Joys;</L>
<L>Which sweeten all the Troubles Age has brought,</L>
