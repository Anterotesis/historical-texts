<HEAD>LETTER FROM DAVID HUME, ESQ. TO THE AUTHOR OF THE DELINEATION OF THE NATURE AND OBLIGATION OF MORALITY.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I write you, I know not to whom I am addressing myself; I only know he is one who has done me a great deal of honour, and to whose civilities I am obliged. If we be stran∣gers, I beg we may be acquainted as soon as you think proper to discover yourself; if we be acquainted already,
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
I beg we may be friends; if friends, I beg we may be more so. Our con∣nexion with each other, as men of let∣ters, is greater than our difference as adhering to different sects or systems. Let us revive the happy times, when Atticus and Cassius the Epicureans, Cicero the Academic, and Brutus the Stoic, could, all of them, live in unre∣served friendship, together, and were insensible to all those distinctions, ex∣cept so far as they furnished agreable matter to discourse and conversation. Perhaps you are a young man, and being full of those sublime ideas, which you have so well exprest, think there can be no virtue upon a more confined system. I am not an old one; but be∣ing of a cool temperament, have always found, that more simple views were
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
sufficient to make me act in a reason∣able manner; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; in this faith have I lived, and hope to die.</P>
<P>Your civilities to me so much over∣balance your severities, that I should be ungrateful to take notice of some expressions, which, in the heat of com∣position, have dropt from your pen. I must only complain of you a little for ascribing to me the sentiments which I had put into the mouth of the Scep∣tic in the Dialogue. I have surely en∣deavoured to refute the Sceptic with all the force of which I am master; and my refutation must be allowed sincere, because drawn from the capital prin∣ciples of my system. But you impute to me both the sentiments of the Scep∣tic and the sentiments of his antagonist,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
which I can never admit of. In every Dialogue, no more than one person can be supposed to represent the au∣thor.</P>
<P>Your severity on one head, that of Chastity, is so great, and I am so little conscious of having given any just oc∣casion to it, that it has afforded me a hint to form a conjecture, perhaps ill grounded, concerning your person.</P>
<P>I hope to steal a little leisure from my other occupations, in order to de∣fend my philosophy against your at∣tacks. If I have occasion to give a new edition of the work, which you have honoured with an answer, I shall make great advantage of your remarks, and hope to obviate some of your criti∣cisms.</P>
<P>Your style is elegant, and full of
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
agreable imagery. In some few places, it does not fully come up to my ideas of purity and correctness. I suppose mine falls still further short of your ideas. In this respect, we may certainly be of use to each other. With regard to our Philosophical systems, I suppose we are both so fixt, that there is no hope of any conversions betwixt us; and for my part, I doubt not but we shall both do as well to remain as we are.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, With great regard, Your most obliged humble servant, DAVID HUME.</SIGNED>
