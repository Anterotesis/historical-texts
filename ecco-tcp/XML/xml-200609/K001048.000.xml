<HEAD>An ANSWER To The Tale of a Nettle.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by D. D'FOE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHen the Good Man was won to so Gracious a Deed,</L>
<L>As to Tolerate the <HI>Nettle</HI> and his Cursed Seed,</L>
<L>He ne'er imagin'd this <HI>Vip'rous Brood</HI></L>
<L>Wou'd be so Ungrateful and monstrously Rude,</L>
<L>As to plead any Title to the <HI>Right of his Ground</HI>;</L>
<L>Which had Cost the <HI>Just Man</HI> so many fair Pound.</L>
<L>He then cast about what to do in the main,</L>
<L>And <HI>Council</HI> he call'd to advise with the same.</L>
<L><HI>Good Sir,</HI> says the Council, <HI>do but try 'um with speed.</HI></L>
<L><HI>They pretend to much Sanctity, call em selves the Lords seed</HI></L>
<L><HI>And none are so righteous and seemingls Holly,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As the Offspring of</HI> Nettle. <HI>Hypocritical Folly</HI></L>
<L><HI>I presume you have gotten, and instead of being just,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I doubt they'll Betrap you on any disgust:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Therefore I advise you without more ado,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You now being old, may grow wiser too;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Experience will teach, what I now shall declare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let none in your Ground any port of it share,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But such as will swear to be True to your Heir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Support You and Him against all Invaders</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of Yours and his Right; let no desperate Bravado's</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make you the more fear them, or esteem your self little,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For they'll soon cut you out by the Scythe or the Sickle:</HI></L>
<L><HI>If once they are sure that you dread their Power,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You nor Yours shall never be quiet one Hour.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I thank you, good Friend, for your good Advice,</L>
<L>I'll follow your Counsel, and strait in a trice</L>
<L>He summon'd the <HI>Nettles,</HI> and told them the Cause.</L>
<L>A Motion he made for to bind them in Laws,</L>
<L>For their good and's own; and so would in short</L>
<L>Admit them to hold that Possession in part</L>
<L>Of his Ground they possessed, if they would with speed</L>
<L>Swear to preserve it to him and his Seed.</L>
<L>They unanimously consented, and without more ado,</L>
<L>Took the Oaths unto Him, and his Succeffor too;</L>
<L>Thus being admitted to a free Toleration,</L>
<L>A handle they got for their present Possession,</L>
<L>And now they began to dispute with their <HI>MastÃªr,</HI></L>
<L>And incroached on him, even faster and faster,</L>
<L>And told him in short they'd aright to his Land,</L>
<L>For he gave 'em Possession under his own Hand.</L>
<L>And thus they daily created Him trouble,</L>
<L>And plaguly vex'd the good Man that was Noble;</L>
<L>They mighty Combustion did raise in his Ground,</L>
<L>And <HI>Cedars</HI> and <HI>Elms</HI> they met their Deaths Wound,</L>
<L>And all sorts of Trees that were <HI>Royally</HI> given,</L>
<L>Were rooted up quite, tho' their Tops reach'd to Heaven:</L>
<L>And after they had thus destroy'd his Possession,</L>
<L>The <HI>Royal-Oaks-Head</HI> was cut off by Commission,</L>
<L>And nothing there left but <HI>Brdmbles</HI> and <HI>Bushes,</HI></L>
<L>Viporous Stinging <HI>Nettles</HI> and silly poor <HI>Rushes</HI>;</L>
<L>The <HI>Bramble</HI> bore sway, and beat down the rest</L>
<L>Of all his fine Plants, and Fruits of the best,</L>
<L>And so it continued in Confusion so long,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Right</HI> did take Place and o'ercome <HI>Wrong.</HI></L>
<L>And now since the <HI>Ground</HI> is restored as before,</L>
<L>Take care how the <HI>Nettle</HI> Stings you any more:</L>
<L>And since the <HI>Handle</HI> you have once again got,</L>
<L>Keep it fast lest your <HI>Ground</HI> goes once more to Pot.</L>
