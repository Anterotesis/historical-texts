<P>AN EPISTLE FROM Mr. <HI>POPE,</HI> TO Dr. <HI>ARBUTHNOT.</HI></P>

humanis spem posueris rerum tuarum: suis te oportet illecebris <HI>ipsa

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Paper is a Sort of Bill of Complaint, be∣gun many years since, and drawn up by snatches, as the several Occasions offer'd. I had no thoughts of publishing it, till it pleas'd some Persons of Rank and Fortune [the Authors of <HI>Verses to the Imitator of Horace,</HI> and of an <HI>Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court,</HI>] to attack in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which being publick the Publick judge) but my <HI>Person, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> whereof to those who know me not, a truer Information may be requisite. Being di∣vided between the Necessity to say something of <HI>Myself,</HI> and my own Laziness to undertake so awkward a Task, I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle. If it have any thing pleasing, it will be That by which I am most desirous to please, the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Sentiment;</HI> and if any thing offensive, it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend, the <HI>Vicious</HI> or <HI>the Ungenerous.</HI></P>
<P>Many will know their own Pictures in it, there be∣ing not a Circumstance but what is true; but I have, for
<PB REF="3"/>
the most part spar'd their <HI>Names,</HI> and they may escape being laugh'd at, if they please.</P>
<P>I would have some of them know, it was owing to the Request of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine. However I shall have this Advan∣tage, and Honour, on my side, that whereas by their pro∣ceeding, any Abuse may be directed at any man, no Injury can possibly be done by mine, since a Nameless Character can never be found out, but by its <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Likeness.</HI></P>
