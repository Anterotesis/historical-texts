<HEAD>TO Mrs. GREVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN requesting your permission to address the
following pages to you, which as they
aim themselves to be critical, require every pro∣tection
and allowance that approving taste or
friendly prejudice can give them, I yet ven∣tured
to mention no other motive than the gra∣tification
of private friendship and esteem. Had
I suggested a hope that your implied approba∣tion
would give a sanction to their defects,
your particular reserve, and dislike to the re∣putation
of critical taste, as well as of poetical
talent, would have made you refuse the pro∣tection
of your name to such a purpose. How∣ever,
I am not so ungrateful as now to attempt
to combat this disposition in you. I shall not
here presume to argue that the present state
of poetry claims and expects every assistance
that taste and example can afford it: nor en∣deavour
to prove that a fastidious concealment
of the most elegant productions of judgment and
fancy is an ill return for the possession of those
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
endowments.—Continue to deceive yourself in
the idea that you are known only to be emi∣nently
admired and regarded for the valuable
qualities that attach private friendships, and
the graceful talents that adorn conversation.
Enough of what you have written, has
stolen into full public notice to answer my
purpose; and you will, perhaps, be the only
person, conversant in elegant literature, who
shall read this address and not perceive that by
publishing your particular approbation of the
following drama, I have a more interested object
than to boast the true respect and regard with
which</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your very sincere,
And obedient humble servant,
R. B. SHERIDAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Honorable RICHARD FITZPATRICK.</BYLINE>
<L>THE Sister Muses, whom these realms obey,</L>
<L>Who o'er the Drama hold divided sway,</L>
<L>Sometimes, by evil counsellors, 'tis said</L>
<L>Like earth-born potentates have been misled:</L>
<L>In those gay days of wickedness and wit,</L>
<L>When Villiers criticiz'd what Dryden writ,</L>
<L>The Tragick Queen, to please a tasteless crow'd,</L>
<L>Had learn'd to bellow, rant, and roar so loud,</L>
<L>That frighten'd Nature, her best friend before,</L>
<L>The blust'ring beldam's company forswore.</L>
<L>Her comic Sister, who had wit 'tis true,</L>
<L>With all her merits, had her failings too;</L>
<L>And would sometimes in mirthful moments use</L>
<L>A style too flippant for a well-bred Muse.</L>
<L>Then female modesty abash'd began</L>
<L>To seek the friendly refuge of the fan,</L>
<L>Awhile behind that slight entrenchment stood,</L>
<L>'Till driv'n from thence, she left the stage for good.</L>
<L>In our more pious, and far chaster times!</L>
<L>These sure no longer are the Muse's crimes!</L>
<L>But some complain that, former faults to shun,</L>
<L>The reformation to extremes has run.</L>
<L>The frantick hero's wild delirium past,</L>
<L>Now insipidity succeeds bombast;</L>
<L>So slow Melpomene's cold numbers creep,</L>
<L>Here dullness seems her drowsy court to keep,</L>
<L>And we, are scarce awake, whilst you are fast asleep.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Thalia, once so ill behav'd and rude,</L>
<L>Reform'd; is now become an arrant prude,</L>
<L>Retailing nightly to the yawning pit,</L>
<L>The purest morals, undefil'd by wit!</L>
<L>Our Author offers in these motley scenes,</L>
<L>A slight remonstrance to the Drama's queens,</L>
<L>Nor let the goddesses be over nice;</L>
<L>Free spoken subjects give the best advice.</L>
<L>Although not quite a novice in his trade,</L>
<L>His cause to night requires no common aid.</L>
<L>To this, a friendly, just, and pow'rful court,</L>
<L>I come Ambassador to beg support.</L>
<L>Can he undaunted, brave the critick's rage?</L>
<L>In civil broils, with brother bards engage?</L>
<L>Hold forth their errors to the publick eye,</L>
<L>Nay more, e'en News-papers themselves defy?</L>
<L>Say, must his single arm encounter all?</L>
<L>By numbers vanquish'd, e'en the brave may fall;</L>
<L>And though no leader should success distrust,</L>
<L>Whose troops are willing, and whose cause is just;</L>
<L>To bid such hosts of angry foes defiance,</L>
<L>His chief dependance must be, YOUR ALLIANCE.</L>

politics.—Where's the MORNING CHRONICLE?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that's your gazette.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, here we have it.—</P>
<P>"<HI>Theatrical intelligence extraordinary,</HI>"—<Q>We
hear there is a new tragedy in rehearsal at
Drury-Lane Theatre, call'd the SPANISH AR∣MADA,
said to be written by Mr. PUFF, a
gentleman well known in the theatrical
world; if we may allow ourselves to give
credit to the report of the performers, who,
truth to say, are in general but indifferent
judges, this piece abounds with the most
striking and received beauties of modern
composition</Q>—So! I am very glad my friend
PUFF's tragedy is in such forwardness.—Mrs.
Dangle, my dear, you will be very glad to
hear that PUFF's tragedy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Dangle, why will you plague me
about such nonsense?—Now the plays are be∣gun
I shall have no peace.—Isn't it sufficient to
make yourself ridiculous by your passion for the
theatre, without continually teazing me to join
you? Why can't you ride your hobby-horse
without desiring to place me on a pillion behind
you, Mr. Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, I was only going to read—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; you never will read any thing that's
worth listening to:—you hate to hear about your
country; there are letters every day with Ro∣man
signatures, demonstrating the certainty of
an invasion, and proving that the nation is ut∣terly
undone—But you never will read any
thing to entertain one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has a woman to do with politics, Mrs.
Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what have you to do with the theatre,
Mr. Dangle? Why should you affect the cha∣racter
of a Critic? I have no patience with you!
—haven't you made yourself the jest of all your
acquaintance by your interference in matters
where you have no business? Are not you call'd
a theatrical Quidnunc, and a mock Maecenas to
second-hand authors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; my power with the Managers is pretty
notorious; but is it no credit to have applica∣tions
from all quarters for my interest?—From
lords to recommend fidlers, from ladies to get
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
boxes, from authors to get answers, and from
actors to get engagements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly; you have contrived to get a
share in all the plague and trouble of theatri∣cal
property, without the profit, or even the cre∣dit
of the abuse that attends it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, Mrs. Dangle, you are no loser by
it, however; you have all the advantages of it:
—mightn't you, last winter, have had the read∣ing
of the new Pantomime a fortnight pre∣vious
to its performance? And doesn't Mr. Fos∣brook
let you take places for a play before it is
advertis'd, and set you down for a Box for
every new piece through the season? And didn't
my friend, Mr. Smatter, dedicate his last Farce
to you at my particular request, Mrs. Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but wasn't the Farce damn'd, Mr.
Dangle? And to be sure it is extremely pleasant
to have one's house made the motley rendezvous
of all the lackeys of literature!—The very high
change of trading authors and jobbing critics!—Yes,
my drawing-room is an absolute register-office
for candidate actors, and poets without
character;—then to be continually alarmed with
Misses and Ma'ams piping histeric changes on
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
JULIETS and DORINDAS, POLLYS and OPHELIAS;
and the very furniture trembling at the proba∣tionary
starts and unprovok'd rants of would-be
RICHARDS and HAMLETS!—And what is worse
than all, now that the Manager has monopoliz'd
the Opera-House, haven't we the Signors and
Signioras calling here, sliding their smooth se∣mibreves,
and gargling glib divisions in their
outlandish throats—with foreign emissaries and
French spies, for ought I know, disguised like
fidlers and figure dancers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy! Mrs. Dangle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to employ yourself so idly at such an
alarming crisis as this too—when, if you had the
least spirit, you would have been at the head of
one of the Westminster associations—or trailing
a volunteer pike in the Artillery Ground!—But
you—o'my conscience, I believe if the French
were landed to-morrow, your first enquiry
would be, whether they had brought a theat∣rical
troop with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Dangle, it does not signify—I say the
stage is "the Mirror of Nature," and the ac∣tors
are "the Abstract, and brief Chronicles of
the Time:"—and pray what can a man of sense
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
study better?—Besides, you will not easily per∣suade
me that there is no credit or importance
in being at the head of a band of critics, who
take upon them to decide for the whole town,
whose opinion and patronage all writers solicit,
and whose recommendation no manager dares
refuse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!—Both managers and authors of
the least merit, laugh at your pretensions.—The
PUBLIC is their CRITIC—without whose
fair approbation they know no play can rest on
the stage, and with whose applause they welcome
such attacks as yours, and laugh at the malice
of them, where they can't at the wit.</P>

<P>Plague on't, now we must appear loving and

<P>With all my heart; you can't be more ridicu∣lous
than you are.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your are enough to provoke—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Enter</HI> Mr. SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Hah! my dear Sneer, I am vastly glad to see
you. My dear, here's Mr. Sneer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morning to you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Dangle and I have been diverting our∣selves
with the papers.—Pray, Sneer, won't you
go to Drury-lane theatre the first night of
Puff's tragedy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I suppose one shan't be able to get
in, for on the first night of a new piece they
always fill the house with orders to support it.
But here, Dangle, I have brought you two
pieces, one of which you must exert your∣self
to make the Managers accept, I can tell
you that, for 'tis written by a person of conse∣quence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! now my plagues are beginning!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I am glad of it, for now you'll be
happy. Why, my dear Dangle, it is a plea∣sure
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
to see how you enjoy your volunteer fa∣tigue,
and your solicited solicitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a great trouble—yet, egad, its pleasant
too.—Why, sometimes of a morning, I have a
dozen people call on me at breakfast time,
whose faces I never saw before, nor ever desire
to see again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must be very pleasant indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And not a week but I receive fifty letters,
and not a line in them about any business of my
own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>An amusing correspondence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE (reading.)</SPEAKER>
<P>"Bursts into tears, and exit." What, is
this a tragedy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's a genteel comedy, not a transla∣tion—only
<HI>taken from the French;</HI> it is written
in a stile which they have lately tried to run
down; the true sentimental, and nothing ridicu∣lous
in it from the beginning to the end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if they had kept to that, I should
not have been such an enemy to the stage, there
was some edification to be got from those pieces,
Mr. Sneer!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am quite of your opinion, Mrs. Dangle;
the theatre, in proper hands, might certainly
be made the school of morality; but now, I am
sorry to say it, people seem to go there princi∣pally
for their entertainment!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would have been more to the credit of the
Managers to have kept it in the other line.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Madam, and hereafter perhaps
to have had it recorded, that in the midst of a
luxurious and dissipated age, they preserv'd <HI>two</HI>
houses in the capital, where the conversation
was always moral at least, if not entertaining!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, egad, I think the worst alteration is in
the nicety of the audience.—No double enten∣dre,
no smart inuendo admitted; even Van∣burgh
and Congreve oblig'd to undergo a
bungling reformation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and our prudery in this respect is just on
a par with the artificial bashfulness of a courte∣zan,
who encreases the blush upon her cheek in
an exact proportion to the diminution of her
modesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sneer can't even give the Public a good
word!—But what have we here?—This seems a
very odd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that's a comedy, on a very new plan;
replete with wit and mirth, yet of a most seri∣ous
moral! You see it is call'd "THE RE∣FORMED
HOUSEBREAKER;" where, by the mere
force of humour, HOUSEBREAKING is put into so
ridiculous a light, that if the piece has its proper
run, I have no doubt but that bolts and bars will
be entirely useless by the end of the season.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, this is new indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it is written by a particular friend of
mine, who has discovered that the follies and foi∣bles
of society, are subjects unworthy the notice
of the Comic Muse, who should be taught to stoop
only at the greater vices and blacker crimes of
humanity—gibbeting capital offences in five acts,
and pillorying petty larcenies in two.—In short,
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
his idea is to dramatize the penal laws, and
make the Stage a court of ease to the Old Bailey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is truly moral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Enter SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Fretful Plagiary, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beg him to walk up.— <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Servant.]</STAGE> Now,
Mrs. Dangle, Sir Fretful Plagiary is an author
to your own taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess he is a favourite of mine, because
every body else abuses him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Very much to the credit of your charity,
Madam, if not of your judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, egad, he allows no merit to any author
but himself, that's the truth on't—tho' he's my
friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.—He is as envious as an old maid
verging on the desperation of six-and-thirty:
and then the insiduous humility with which he
seduces you to give a free opinion on any of his
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
works, can be exceeded only by the petulant
arrogance with which he is sure to reject your
observations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, egad—tho' he's my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then his affected contempt of all newspa∣per
strictures; tho', at the same time, he is the
sorest man alive, and shrinks like scorch'd parch∣ment
from the fiery ordeal of true criticism:
yet is he so covetous of popularity, that he
had rather be abused than not mentioned at
all.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say nothing—I take away from no man's
merit—am hurt at no man's good fortune—I say
nothing.—But this I will say—through all my
knowledge of life, I have observ'd—that there
is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human
heart as envy!</P>

<P>I believe you have reason for what you say,
indeed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Besides—I can tell you it is not always so
safe to leave a play in the hands of those who
write themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, they may steal from them, hey, my
dear Plagiary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Steal!—to besure they may; and, egad, serve
your best thoughts as gypsies do stolen children,
disfigure them to make 'em pass for their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your present work is a sacrifice to Melpo∣mene,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no security.—A dext'rous plagiarist
may do any thing.—Why, Sir, for ought I
know, he might take out some of the best things
in my tragedy, and put them into his own co∣medy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That might be done, I dare be sworn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, if such a person gives you the
least hint or assistance, he is devilish apt to take
the merit of the whole.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it succeeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Aye—but with regard to this piece, I think
I can hit that gentleman, for I can safely swear
he never read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you how you may hurt him more—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swear he wrote it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plague on't now, Sneer, I shall take it ill.—I
believe you want to take away my character as
an author!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am sure you ought to be very much
oblig'd to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!—Sir!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O you know, he never means what he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRTEFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sincerely then—you do like the piece?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wonderfully!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come now, there must be something that
you think might be mended, hey?—Mr. Dangle,
has nothing struck you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, it is but an ungracious thing for
the most part to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>—With most authors it is just so indeed;
they are in general strangely tenacious!—But, for
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
my part, I am never so well pleased as when a
judicious critic points out any defect to me; for
what is the purpose of shewing a work to a
friend, if you don't mean to profit by his opi∣nion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.—Why then, tho' I seriously ad∣mire
the piece upon the whole, yet there is one
small objection; which, if you'll give me leave,
I'll mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, you can't oblige me more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it wants incident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God!—you surprize me!—wants in∣cident!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I own I think the incidents are too
few.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God!—Believe me, Mr. Sneer, there
is no person for whose judgment I have a more
implicit deference.—But I protest to you, Mr.
Sneer, I am only apprehensive that the inci∣dents
are too crowded.—My dear Dangle,
how does it strike you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really I can't agree with my friend Sneer.—I
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
think the plot quite sufficient; and the four first acts
by many degrees the best I ever read or saw in my
life. If I might venture to suggest any thing,
it is that the interest rather falls off in the fifth.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Rises; I believe you mean, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I don't upon my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, you do upon my soul—it certainly
don't fall off, I assure you—No, no, it don't
fall off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Mrs. Dangle, didn't you say it struck
you in the same light?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, I did not—I did not see a fault in
any part of the play from the beginning to the
end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul the women are the best jud∣ges
after all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or if I made any objection, I am sure it
was to nothing in the piece; but that I was afraid
it was, on the whole, a little too long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Madam, do you speak as to duration of
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
time; or do you mean that the story is tediously
spun out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lud! no.—I speak only with reference to
the usual length of acting plays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am very happy—very happy indeed,—because
the play is a short play, a remarkably
short play:—I should not venture to differ with a
lady on a point of taste; but, on these occa∣sions,
the watch, you know, is the critic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I suppose, it must have been Mr. Dangle's
drawling manner of reading it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, if Mr. Dangle read it! that's quite ano∣ther
affair!—But I assure you, Mrs. Dangle, the
first evening you can spare me three hours and
an half, I'll undertake to read you the whole
from beginning to end, with the Prologue and
Epilogue, and allow time for the music between
the acts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to see it on the stage next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Fretful, I wish you may be able to
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
get rid as easily of the news-paper criticisms as
you do of ours.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The NEWS-PAPERS!—Sir, they are the most
villainous—licentious—abominable—infernal—Not
that I ever read them—No—I make it
a rule never to look into a news-paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are quite right—for it certainly must
hurt an author of delicate feelings to see the li∣berties
they take</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—quite the contrary;—their abuse
is, in fact, the best panegyric—I like it of all
things.—An author's reputation is only in dan∣ger
from their support.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true—and that attack now on you
the other day—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>—What? where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, you mean in a paper of Thursday; it
was compleatly ill-natur'd to be sure.</P>
</SP>

<P>O, so much the better.—Ha! ha! ha!—I
wou'dn't have it otherwise.</P>
</SP>

<P>—You don't happen to recollect what the
fellow said, do you?</P>

<P>—O lud, no!—anxious,—not I,—not the least.
—I—But one may as well hear you know.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and pray now—Not that it signifies—what
might the gentleman say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he roundly asserts that you have not
the slightest invention, or original genius what∣ever;
tho' you are the greatest traducer of all
other authors living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—very good!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That as to COMEDY, you have not one idea
of your own, he believes, even in your com∣mon
place-book—where stray jokes, and pil∣fered
witticisms are kept with as much me∣thod
as the ledger of the LOST-and-STOLEN-OFFICE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Ha! ha! ha!—very pleasant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that you are so unlucky as not to have
the skill even to <HI>steal</HI> with taste.—But that you
gleen from the refuse of obscure volumes, where
more judicious plagiarists have been before you;
so that the body of your work is a composition
of dregs and sediments—like a bad tavern's
worst wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your more serious efforts, he says, your
bombast would be less intolerable, if the
thoughts were ever suited to the expression;
but the homeliness of the sentiment stares thro'
the fantastic encumbrance of it's fine language,
like a clown in one of the new uniforms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That your occasional tropes and flowers suit
the general coarseness of your stile, as tambour
sprigs would a ground of linsey-wolfey; while
your imitations of Shakespeare resemble the
mimicry of Falstaff's Page, and are about as
near the standard of the original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>—In short, that even the finest passages you
steal are of no service to you; for the poverty of
your own language prevents their assimilating;
so that they lie on the surface like lumps of
marl on a barren moor, encumbering what it
is not in their power to fertilize!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(after great agitation.)</STAGE>
<P>—Now another person would be vex'd at

<P>Oh! but I wou'dn't have told you, only to di∣vert
you.</P>

quite right, Sir Fretful, never to read such non∣sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—for if there is any thing to one's
praise, it is a foolish vanity to be gratified at it,
and if it is abuse,—why one is always sure to
hear of it from one damn'd good natur'd friend
or another!</P>

<P>—Zounds! no, Mr. Dangle, don't I tell
you these things never fret me in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I only thought—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>—And let me tell you, Mr. Dangle, 'tis

damn'd affronting in you to suppose that I am

<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why so warm, Sir Fretful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir FRETFUL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gadslife! Mr. Sneer, you are as absurd as
Dangle; how often must I repeat it to you,
that nothing can vex me but your supposing it
possible for me to mind the damn'd nonsense
you have been repeating to me!—and let me tell
you, if you continue to believe this, you must
mean to insult me, gentlemen—and then your
disrespect will affect me no more than the news∣paper
criticisms—and I shall treat it—with ex∣actly
the same calm indifference and philosophic
contempt—and so your servant.</P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha! Poor Sir Fretful! Now will he

you must get you friend PUFF to take me to
the rehearsal of his tragedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll answer for't, he'll thank you for desiring it.
But come and help me to judge of this musical

<P>So I am—but I have a bad ear.—Efaith,
Sneer, tho', I am afraid we were a little too severe
on Sir Fretful—tho' he is my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 'tis certain, that unnecessarily to mor∣tify
the vanity of any writer, is a cruelty which

<P>Aye!—Then that must have been affecta∣tion
in them, for egad, there were some of the
attacks which there was no laughing at!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, the humourous ones.—But I should think
Mr. Puff, that Authors would in general be able
to do this sort of work for themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes—but in a clumsy way.—Besides, we
look on that as an encroachment, and so take
the opposite side.—I dare say now you conceive
half the very civil paragraphs and advertise∣ments
you see, to be written by the parties con∣cerned,
or their friends?—No such thing—Nine
out of ten, manufactured by me in the
way of business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even the Auctioneers now,—the Auctioneers
I say, tho' the rogues have lately got some cre∣dit
for their language—not an article of the
merit their's!—take them out of their Pulpits,
and they are as dull as Catalogues.—No, Sir;—'twas
I first enrich'd their style—'twas I first
taught them to crowd their advertisements with
panegyrical superlatives, each epithet rising
above the other—like the Bidders in their own
Auction-rooms! From ME they learn'd to enlay
their phraseology with variegated chips of exo∣tic
metaphor: by ME too their inventive facul∣ties
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
were called forth.—Yes Sir, by ME they
were instructed to clothe ideal walls with gra∣tuitous
fruits—to insinuate obsequious rivulets
into visionary groves—to teach courteous shrubs
to nod their approbation of the grateful soil!
or on emergencies to raise upstart oaks, where
there never had been an acorn; to create a de∣lightful
vicinage without the assistance of a
neighbour; or fix the temple of Hygeia in the
fens of Lincolnshire!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, you have done them infinite ser∣vice;
for now, when a gentleman is ruined, he
parts with his house with some credit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Service! if they had any gratitude, they
would erect a statue to him, they would figure
him as a presiding Mercury, the god of traffic
and fiction, with a hammer in his hand instead
of a caduceus.—But pray, Mr. Puff, what first
put you on exercising your talents in this way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad sir,—sheer necessity—the proper parent
of an art so nearly allied to invention: you must
know Mr. Sneer, that from the first time I tried
my hand at an advertisement, my success was
such, that for sometime after, I led a most ex∣traordinary
life indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I supported myself two years entirely by
my misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your misfortunes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, assisted by long sickness, and other
occasional disorders; and a very comfortable liv∣ing
I had of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>From sickness and misfortunes!—You prac∣tised
as a Doctor, and an Attorney at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>No egad, both maladies and miseries were
my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!—what the plague!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, efaith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harkee!—By advertisements—"To the cha∣ritable
and humane!" and "to those whom
Providence hath blessed with affluence!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh,—I understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in truth, I deserved what I got, for I
suppose never man went thro' such a series of
calamities in the same space of time!—Sir, I
was five times made a bankrupt, and reduced
from a state of affluence, by a train of unavoid∣able
misfortunes! then Sir, tho' a very in∣dustrious
tradesman, I was twice burnt out,
and lost my little all, both times!—I lived
upon those fires a month.—I soon after was con∣fined
by a most excruciating disorder, and lost
the use of my limbs!—That told very well, for
I had the case strongly attested, and went about
to collect the subscriptions myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I believe that was when you first
called on me.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>—In November last?—O no!—I was at that
time, a close prisoner in the Marshalsea, for
a debt benevolently contracted to serve a
friend!—I was afterwards, twice tapped for
a dropsy, which declined into a very profitable
consumption!—I was then reduced to—O no—then,
I became a widow with six helpless
children,—after having had eleven husbands
pressed, and being left every time eight months
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
gone with child, and without money to get
me into an hospital!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you bore all with patience, I make no
doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes,—tho' I made some occasional at∣tempts
at felo de se; but as I did not find those
<HI>rash actions</HI> answer, I left off killing myself very
soon.—Well, Sir,—at last, what with bankrupt∣cies,
fires, gouts, dropsies, imprisonments, and
other valuable calamities, having got together
a pretty handsome sum, I determined to quit a
business which had always gone rather against
my conscience, and in a more liberal way still
to indulge my talents for fiction and embellish∣ment,
thro' my favourite channels of diurnal
communication—and so, Sir, you have my his∣tory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most obligingly communicative indeed; and
your confession if published, might certainly
serve the cause of true charity, by rescuing the
most useful channels of appeal to benevolence
from the cant of imposition.—But surely, Mr.
PUFF, there is no great <HI>mystery</HI> in your present
profession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mystery! Sir, I will take upon me to say
the matter was never scientifically treated, nor
reduced to rule before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reduced to rule?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lud, Sir! you are very ignorant, I am
afraid.—Yes Sir,—PUFFING is of various sorts—the
principal are, The PUFF DIRECT—the
PUFF PRELIMINARY—the PUFF COLLATERAL—the
PUFF COLLUSIVE, and the PUFF OBLIQUE, or
PUFF by IMPLICATION.—These all assume, as
circumstances require, the various forms of
LETTER TO THE EDITOR—OCCASIONAL ANEC∣DOTE—IMPARTIAL
CRITIQUE—OBSERVATION
from CORRESPONDENT,—or ADVERTISEMENT
FROM THE PARTY.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The puff direct, I can conceive—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, that's simple enough,—for instance—A
new Comedy or Farce is to be produced at
one of the Theatres (though by the bye they
don't bring out half what they ought to do)
The author, suppose Mr. Smatter, or Mr. Dapper—or
any particular friend of mine—very well;
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
the day before it is to be performed, I write
an account of the manner in which it was re∣ceived—I
have the plot from the author,—and
only add—Characters strongly drawn—highly
coloured—hand of a master—fund of genuine
humour—mine of invention—neat dialogue—attic
salt! Then for the performance—Mr.
DODD was astonishingly great in the character
of SIR HARRY! That universal and judicious
actor Mr. PALMER, perhaps never appeared to
more advantage than in the COLONEL;—but it
is not in the power of language to do justice to
Mr. KING!—Indeed he more than merited those
repeated bursts of applause which he drew from
a most brilliant and judicious audience! As to
the scenery—The miraculous power of Mr. DE
LOUTHER BOURG's pencil are universally acknow∣ledged!—In
short, we are at a loss which to ad∣mire
most,—the unrivalled genius of the author,
the great attention and liberality of the ma∣nagers—the
wonderful abilities of the painter,
or the incredible exertions of all the perfor∣mers!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pretty well indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>O cool—quite cool—to what I sometimes do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think there are any who are in∣fluenced
by this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, lud! yes, Sir;—the number of those who
go thro' the fatigue of judging for themselves is
very small indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir,—the PUFF PRELIMINARY?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that, Sir, does well in the form of
a <HI>Caution.</HI>—In a matter of gallantry now—Sir
FLIMSY GOSSIMER, wishes to be well with
LADY FANNY FETE—He applies to me—I
open trenches for him with a paragraph
in the Morning Post.—It is recommended
to the beautiful and accomplished Lady F
four stars F dash E to be on her guard
against that dangerous character, Sir F dash G;
who, however pleasing and insinuating his man∣ners
may be, is certainly not remarkable for the
<HI>constancy of his attachments!</HI>—in Italics.—Here
you see, Sir FLIMSY GOSSIMER is introduced to
the particular notice of Lady FANNY—who,
perhaps never thought of him before—she finds
herself publickly cautioned to avoid him, which
naturally makes her desirous of seeing him;—the
observation of their acquaintance causes a
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
pretty kind of mutual embarrassment, this pro∣duces
a sort of sympathy of interest—which, if
Sir Flimsy is unable to improve effectually, he
at least gains the credit of having their names
mentioned together, by a particular set, and in a
particular way,—which nine times out of ten is
the full accomplishment of modern gallantry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Sneer, you will be quite an adept in
the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, the PUFF COLLATERAL is much
used as an appendage to advertisements, and
may take the form of anecdote.—Yesterday
as the celebrated GEORGE BON-MOT was saun∣tering
down St. James's-street, he met the lively
Lady MARY MYRTLE, coming out of the
Park,—'Good God, LADY MARY, I'm surprised
to meet you in a white jacket,—for I expected
never to have seen you, but in a full-trim∣med
unifor, and a light-horseman's cap!'—"Heavens,
GEORGE, where could you have
learned that?"—'Why, replied the wit, I just
saw a print of you, in a new publication called
The CAMP MAGAZINE, which, by the bye, is
a devilish clever thing,—and is sold at No. 3, on
the right hand of the way, two doors from the
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
printing-office, the corner of Ivy-lane, Pater-noster-row,
price only one shilling!'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very ingenious indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the PUFF COLLUSIVE is the newest of
any; for it acts in the disguise of determined
hostility.—It is much used by bold booksellers
and enterprising poets.—An indignant corres∣pondent
observes—that the new poem called
BEELZEBUB's COTILLION, or PROSERPINE's
FETE CHAMPETRE, is one of the most unjustifi∣able
performances he ever read! The severity
with which certain characters are handled is quite
shocking! And as there are many descriptions
in it too warmly coloured for female delicacy,
the shameful avidity with which this piece is
bought by all people of fashion, is a reproach
on the taste of the times, and a disgrace to the
delicacy of the age!—Here you see the
two strongest inducements are held forth;—First,
that nobody ought to read it;—and secondly,
that every body buys it; on the strength of
which, the publisher boldly prints the tenth edi∣tion,
before the had sold ten of the first; and
then establishes it by threatening himself with
the pillory, or absolutely indicting himseif for
SCAN. MAG.!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—'gad I know it is so▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the PUFF OBLIQUE, or PUFF BY IM∣PLICATION,
it is too various and extensive to
be illustrated by an instance;—it attracts in
titles, and presumes in patents; it lurks in the
<HI>limitation</HI> of a subscription, and invites in the
assurance of croud and incommodation at
public places; it delights to draw forth conceal∣ed
merit, with a most disinterested assiduity; and
sometimes wears a countenance of smiling cen∣sure
and tender reproach.—It has a wonderful
memory for Parliamentary Debates, and will of∣ten
give the whole speech of a favoured mem∣ber,
with the most flattering accuracy. But,
above all, it is a great dealer in reports and sup∣positions.—It
has the earliest intelligence of in∣tended
preferments that will reflect <HI>honor</HI> on the
<HI>patrons;</HI> and embryo promotions of modest
gentlemen—who know nothing of the matter
themselves. It can hint a ribband for implied
services, in the air of a common report; and
with the carelesness of a casual paragraph, sug∣gest
officers into commands—to which they have
no pretension but their wishes. This, Sir,
is the last principal class in the ART of
PUFFING—An art which I hope you will
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
now agree with me, is of the highest dignity—yielding
a tablature of benevolence and public
spirit; befriending equally trade, gallantry, cri∣ticism,
and politics:—the applause of genius! the
register of charity! the triumph of heroism!
the self defence of contractors! the fame of
orators!—and the gazette of ministers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am compleatly a convert both to the
importance and ingenuity of your profession;
and now, Sir, there is but one thing which can
possibly encrease my respect for you, and that is,
your permitting me to be present this morning

<P>No; It will not be yet this hour, for they are

<P>NO, no, Sir; what Shakespeare says of
ACTORS may be better applied to the pur∣pose
of PLAYS; <HI>they</HI> ought to be 'the abstract
and brief Chronicles of the times.' Therefore
when history, and particularly the history of our
own country, furnishes any thing like a case in
point, to the time in which an author writes, if
he knows his own interest, he will take advan∣tage
of it; so, Sir, I call my tragedy The
SPANISH ARMADA; and have laid the scene be∣fore
TILBURY FORT.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A most happy thought certainly!</P>

</SP>

<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love!—Oh nothing so easy; for it is a
received point among poets, that where history
gives you a good heroic out-line for a play, you
may fill up with a little love at your own dis∣cretion;
in doing which, nine times out of ten,
you only make up a deficiency in the private
history of the times.—Now I rather think I have
done this with some success.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No scandal about Queen ELIZABETH, I hope?</P>

<P>To be sure it will—but what the plague! a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true—and for that matter DON FEROLO
WISKERANDOS—for that's the lover's name,
might have been over here in the train of the
Spanish Ambassador; or TILBURINA, for that is
the lady's name, might have been in love with
him, from having heard his character, or seen
his picture; or from knowing that he was the
last man in the world she ought to be in love

<P>Ah! here has been more pruning!—but the

Don Whiskerandos.—Now, gentlemen, this scene

<P>O dear madam, you are not to say that to her

<STAGE>[The two nieces draw their two daggers to strike
Whiskerandos, the two Uncles at the instant with
their two swords drawn, catch their two nieces
arms, and turn the points of their swords to Whiske∣randos,
who immediately draws two daggers, and
holds them to the two nieces' bosoms.]</STAGE>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's situation for you!—there's an heroic
group!—You see the ladies can't stab Whiske∣randos
—he durst not strike them for fear of
their uncles—the uncles durst not kill him,
because of their nieces—I have them all at a
dead lock!—for every one of them is afraid to
let go first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then they must stand there for ever.</P>

<STAGE>[Discovers himself, by throwing off his upper dress, and
appearing in a very fine waistcoat.]</STAGE>

<L>I take thy challenge, Spaniard, and I thank</L>
<L>Thee Fortune too!—</L>
<STAGE>Takes up the other sword.</STAGE>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's excellently contrived!—it seems as if
the two uncles had left their swords on purpose
for them.</P>

<P>No, egad, they could not help leaving them.</P>

given, Whiskerandos falls.</STAGE>

<L>O cursed parry!—that last thrust in tierce</L>

<P>But what the deuce, is the confidant to be
mad too?</P>
</SP>

<P>To be sure she is, the confidant is always to
do whatever her mistress does; weep when she
weeps, smile when she smiles, go mad when
