<HEAD>TO THE
QUEEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Dedication is not so much a Compliment to your
Person, as an Appeal to your Justice.</P>
<P>Your Protestant Dissenting Subjects have your Sacred
Promise of Protection, they behaving themselves Du∣tifully
and Peaceably to your Government, and Obedient to
the Laws: And, <HI>Madam,</HI> as they cannot be so ignorant
of their own Happiness under your gentle Government, or
so blind to their own Interest as to forfeit your Favour by
any breach of their Duty; so they cannot doubt of the full
Performance on your Majesty's part, of all that your Ma∣jesty
has been graciously pleas'd to assure them of under the
Sanction of your Royal Word.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The Toleration of their religious Liberty has been se∣cur'd
to them by Law; and your Majesty has been pleas'd
to add to the Force of that Law your Royal Word, that it
shall be inviolably preserv'd.</P>
<P>Your Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects lay at
your Feet the following Relation, with all Humility appeal∣ing
to your Royal Judgment, whether both their Toleration
is not herein violently invaded, and your Majesty's Honour
and sacred Promise at least attempted to be violated in the
illegal arbitrary Methods made use of to oppress one of
their Ministers, and suppress an Assembly of several Hun∣dreds
of your Loyal and Peaceable Dissenting Subjects.</P>
<P>They remonstrate, and in the humblest manner Com∣plain
to your Majesty of the Violence and horrid Practices
made use of to Defame, Persecute, Imprison and Ruin a
Man, whose principal visible Crime is Serving God ac∣cording
to his Conscience, and Teaching the same to others.
They humbly present themselves at your Royal Feet, as
wounded through the sides of this injur'd Person, and are
your Majesty's humble Petitioners, that you will be graci∣ously
pleas'd to testifie your Dislike of the Oppressions and
Injustice of their Enemies, in such manner as to your great
Wisdom shall seem meet.</P>
<P>In your Majesty's Favour and Justice they hope for
exemplar Animadversions on these unchristian Practices,
and have a full Confidence in your Royal Promise, that they
shall not be abridg'd of nor ill treated for that Liberty,
which being settled first by the Laws of God and Nature,
and since that by the Laws of this Land, is their legal
<PB REF="4"/>
Right, and which your Majesty's just Sence of its Reason∣ableness
has mov'd you to resolve to maintain.</P>
<P>They humbly commit themselves and their Cause to your
Majesty's Protection, imploring your Royal Regard so far
and no farther as every Article advanc'd in their behalf
in this Book is positively and exactly conformable to Truth
and direct Meaning, being at all times ready to come forth
and confront, even in your Royal Presence, all the Allega∣tions
to the contrary.</P>
<P>Having thus publickly appeal'd to God and your Maje∣sty,
they can no longer Doubt either of the Blessing from
above, or the Protection and Assistance of your Majesty
below: and as your Throne has been a famous Refuge to
apprest Innocence and Virtue in all Nations, so they doubt
not but your own Subjects shall yet have the Honour and
Happiness of your powerful Protection as far as Justice
and Law is on their side.</P>
<P>Nor are they the less confident of your Majesty's Pro∣tection
for their differing in Judgment from some few
Points profess'd and practis'd by the Church of <HI>England</HI>
of which your Majesty is the glorious Head, since the
Evils they complain of are suffer'd not from the Church
of <HI>England</HI> as such, whom they honour, and with whom
they covet to live in Charity, Union, and Peace, but by
ill Men, who making the Church, Religion, and the Ho∣nour
of God their Pretence, have broken all the Laws of
God, Nature, Humanity, and their Native Country, in
a most unheard-of and unaccountable manner, to the Re∣proach
of the Protestant Religion in general, and to the
<PB REF="5"/>
Scandal of the Church they pretend themselves Members of.</P>
<P>Neither your Majesty nor the Church of <HI>England</HI> will
be offended at us for endeavouring to bring our Actions to
the Test of the Law, and for seeking the Protection of your
Royal Justice.</P>
<P>Your Majesty oppresses none of your Subjects, the Do∣ctrine
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been declar'd to be
inconsistent with Persecution; the Actions of these Men
therefore, however shelter'd under your Authority and the
Wings of the Church, will appear to your Majesty affron∣tive
of your Goodness, and highly derogating from the
Christian Spirit the Church of <HI>England</HI> professes: the
Truth of which, we humbly submit to Your Majesty's.
Wisdom to Discover, and to your Justice to Resent, as
you shall find Cause,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the unhappy Differences between the High-Church Party
and the Dissenters, it has happen'd, as it generally does in
all Heats and Animosities of Parties, that both Sides pretend
to be in the right, and both pretend to be abus'd by the
other.</P>
<P>The warm Men of the Church have charg'd the Dissenters with
Associating to Destroy and Undermine the Church. How they
have made good their Charge, is not the business of this Paper,
and has been examin'd elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Dissenters charge the other with Insulting them, Persecu∣ting
them, and Invading their Toleration.</P>
<P>Great Endeavours have been us'd to defend the Occasional Bills
from a Charge of Persecution: and whether they have done that
or no, we need not dispute, but refer to the Conferences on
that Head between the Houses, and which are publish'd in Print.</P>
<P>But to leave all doubtful Cases to stand and fall by the Force of
their own Truth, I cannot think the World ought to be ignorant
of the following Story; that all unbyass'd People may see, by
this Specimen, what these Gentlemen would do with the Dissen∣ters
if it lay in their power, and how justly they have been
charg'd with designs to Hang, Banish, and Destroy the Dissenters,
and reward their Ministers with the Gallows and the Galleys.</P>
<P>And because I am going to present the World with a new
<HI>Devil of Loudon,</HI> with a Story so black in all its Parts, so much the
Picture of Hell, and so aggravated with inhumane and unchri∣stian
Circumstances, that all that read it must blush for their Native
Country, to think such unheard-of Villanies could be acted in it,
Crimes so abhorr'd by Mankind, that tho' they call themselves
of the Church, we shall find all the true Members of the Church,
whether Judges, Justices, Bishops, yea even Jaylors themselves,
abhorring it: while, I say, I have such a Scene before me, and
knowing what sort of People I have to do with, I shall take such an
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
exact care to have every thing that is here advanc'd so attested with
undeniable Evidence, that Impudence it self, not the hellish Actors,
not the blindest Advocates, not the Devil himself, shall dare to
Reply to it.</P>
<P>Slander and Lies fly befoe Truth as Mist before the Sun;
and this hellish Association, form'd against an innocent Man, tho'
laid as deep as Hell, and prosecuted thro' all the barbarous Ex∣tremes
of Forgery, Perjury, Violence, Subornation, Insults, and
Revenge, yet at last all dwindles away before Truth: Inno∣cence
breaks out like the Sun thro' a dark Cloud, the Light
of Truth is so clear, that Devils shun it, Monsters fly from it, and
Men of Guilt and Blood hide their Heads at its appearance.</P>
<P>And as I should not have attempted this Relation, had I not had
good and undoubted Testimony of the Truth of every Article, so
I write with the greater Assurance, since I can frankly defie the
most harden'd Advocate of such a wretched Cause to confront the
least or minutest Circumstance.</P>
<P>Such direct Testimony, such just Authorities, such authentick
Proofs of every Article, are before me, that no Man could ever
desire to have his Reputation vindicated with more. Clearness in
the Face of the Sun.</P>
<P>As for the Treatment this poor injur'd Man has met with, I
would be glad the worst Enemy in the Nation would give it a
Name, and tell us, wiht some little Reason at the same time,
what to call it.</P>
<P>I would have them rummage <HI>Fox</HI>'s History of the Popish Perse∣cutions,
and tell us where they can match the Usage this Man has
met with; and let us know where ever Bishop <HI>Gardiner,</HI> or bloo∣dy
<HI>Bonner,</HI> acted like These Men.</P>
<P>Let them shew us such an Ecclesiastical Magistrate as Parson
<HI>Eern,</HI> and where ever English-men have been thus treated.</P>
<P>Well might the Parliament pass a Bill to qualifie Justices of the
Peace. If this be the fruit of putting Church Parsons into Com∣missions
of the Peace, never let <HI>Hudibras</HI> tell us of the Cobler of
<HI>New-England,</HI> who
<Q><L>Serv'd his Country in a double</L>
<L>Capacity, to Preach and Cobble.</L></Q></P>
<P>To let the Reader gradually into this black Story, it is neces∣sary
to inform him, that in several publick Printed Books, as well
as in common Discourse, the Town has been possess'd with a Sto∣ry
of a Dissenting Minister in the <HI>Isle of Ely,</HI> who first forg'd Epis∣copal
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Orders, and preach'd in the Church; but being detected
in that, pretended Classical Ordination, and set up a Conventicle;
but being prosecuted as a scandalous Fellow, having two or three
Wives, four or five Bastards, having once broke out of <HI>Derby</HI>
Jayl, play'd a great many villainous Pranks, and being a com∣mon
Drunkard and Swearer, the Justices took him up as a Vaga∣bond,
listed him for a Soldier, and sent him away to <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
where having been Arrested for Debt, and thereby got out of the
Officer's hands: some Complaints being made by the Dissenters at
the Injustice of this—The Party greet them, by way of Answer,
with prodigious Calumnies, and insolent Reproaches of the Man
himself, to vindicate the most villainous unheard-of Proceedings
that ever this Nation knew.</P>
<P>And as the abominable Insolence of their Actions happen'd to
receive a due Censure from the best Lord Chief Justice, and
of the most unspotted Character this Age has known; let us
see how this Person, as well as the poor Sufferer, is treated on
this account by that Man of Fury and Satyr, Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> in the Pre∣face
to his Lampoon, call'd, <HI>Moderation Display'd.</HI></P>
<P>Inveighing against our Men of Moderation in the Church, he
says, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, so tender are they of their Dissenting Brethren, that
I am told it has lately been delivered as Law by a great Man in
<HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>hall,</HI> That a notorious perjur'd Vagabond, with two
Wives at once, being possest of a separate Congregation, tho'
without any Licence or legal Qualification to preach to them,
shall, for that reason only, be exempt from the late Act for
Listing Vagrants."</Q></P>
<P>Now if, upon reading these Sheets, it should <HI>so fall out,</HI> that af∣ter
all that has been done or said to or of this poor injur'd Man,
it should appear too plain for the most harden'd Lampooner or
most impudent Church-Justice to deny, that this is all Malice, For∣gery,
and Injustice, and, as all the Judges of the Queen's-Bench
exprest it, the deepest Track of Villainy that ever came before
them; What will these Men say for themselves, and how will they
make Satisfaction to God or Man, to the affronted Dissenters, to
their own expos'd Party, and to the poor injur'd Man that has
been inhumanely treated?</P>
<P>If, after all their Clamour and barbarous Orders, I make it ap∣pear,
that this Man never broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> or any other Jayl,
never forg'd any Orders, but was fairly ordain'd by a Church of
<HI>England</HI> Bishop, ws never Perjur'd, or a Vagabond, had never
two Wives at once, nor any Bastards, was never seen to be Drunk,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
or known to Swear; but that, on the contrary, has been always
a sober, vertuous, and peaceable Liver, a constant Resident at his
Cure for eleven or twelve Years together, a Man of Charity
and good Conversation, and, in short, not in the least guilty of
one of the Crimes charg'd on him, but that it has been all For∣gery,
Malice, and Conspiracy to ruin him, meerly for his quitting
the Church, and turning to the Dissenters.</P>
<P>If this should happen to be made out, as I fairly undertake it
shall, I crave Leave to draw these two Inferences;</P>
<P N="1">1. Those Dissenters who too hastily believ'd, and too readily
handed on the Clamours and Slanders against an innoceut Man,
through whose Sides they were all wounded and aim'd it, ought to
acknowledge their want of Consideration and Caution. 'Tis true,
it may be said, in their Excuse, they could not have imagin'd the
Earth had borne such Monsters, and that such a Cloud of Cla∣mours
could never be all forg'd; and therefore, in Charity to
the Church-men, they were drawn in to Censure an Innocent Man,
for which they ought to ask his Pardon; and restoring him to
their just Opinion, more diligently guard, for the future, his
injur'd Reputation.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Forgers of all this, and the Authors of a Treat∣ment
too foul to relate, and blacker than the Ink I write it
with, I leave their Character to season the Pallate of the Rea∣der,
after he has been fill'd with Horror at some of the most
villainous Actions the World ever heard of. The Matter of Fact is
as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>The CASE of Mr. <HI>ABRAHAM GILL, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ABraham Gill,</HI> the Subject of the ensuing Tragedy, was a Mini∣ster
of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; He was born in <HI>Rivington</HI> in the
County of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> had his Education partly among the Dis∣senters,
but last of all in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he
commenc'd Batchelor of Arts of <HI>Brazen-Nose</HI> College.</P>
<P>From whence Conforming to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he en∣tred
into Holy Orders, and was admitted by the present Right.
Reverend the Bishop of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>And because his Enemies have had the face to Charge him with
forging the Bishop's Orders, We think it necessary, that we may
clear every thing as we go along, having abundance of dark things
to expose and Hellish Conduct to lay open, to draw this Scene
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
before we proceed, and to tell them, that the very Original Or∣ders,
Signed by the Bishop of <HI>Chester</HI>'s own Hand, and Seal'd with
his Seal, is left with the rest of the Vouchers of this horrid Trans∣action,
at Mr. <HI>John Skey</HI>'s Tobacconist, at the <HI>Black-boy and Three
Tobacco-pipes</HI> at <HI>Queenhithe,</HI> where all the World, Friends or Ene∣mies,
are promised a free and uninterrupted Opportunity to see
them, and detect the Forgeries if they are to be found.</P>
<P>And that it may not be alledg'd, this Freedom of offering a
sight of the Originals is but a presumptive Proof, supposing no
Man will trouble himself to examine them, (<HI>tho' the Willingness of
some Gentlemen to expose the Dissenters in this honest Man's Cause
suggests otherwise</HI>) yet eternally to stop the Mouth of the most
prepossess'd Malice, a Reverend Clergy-man of their own Church
is to be found, honest enough to do Justice to an injur'd Man,
and give a Sanction to the Truth.</P>
<P>This Gentleman is one who entred into Orders with Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
and five Ministers more at the same time, and has honestly sworn
it: which Affidavit is left also with the rest of the Vouchers at the
Place aforesaid. And now if these Orders are Counterfeit or
Forg'd, it may fairly be seen, and Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> be expos'd; but if
not, let the World match the villainous Usage this poor Man has
met with, if they can.</P>
<P>After this Demonstration of the Certainty and undoubted Truth
of his Orders, 'tis humbly desir'd of all those Gentlemen that
shall for the future charge him with forging Episcopal Orders,
that they would be pleas'd to shew their Faces, that we may
see if they do not blush; and that they would tell us their Names,
that after some few Examples of this sort made for Satisfaction to
Justice and the Law out of the great Number of those that are al∣ready
detected, they may be recorded, as they deserve, among
those that <HI>bear false Witness against their Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed to the History of Mr. <HI>Gill:</HI> After he had thus
enter'd into Orders, he preach'd as Curate at <HI>Maney</HI> in the <HI>Isle of
Ely,</HI> about 12 Miles from <HI>Wisbich.</HI></P>
<P>While he Officiated in this Place, he was well receiv'd and
belov'd of his Congregation; and we never find any Complaint
made of him, save that he set an ill Example to his Neighbours
of the Clergy, by invading the Custom of the Country, and
Preaching twice a day to the People.</P>
<P>Having been two Years in <HI>Maney,</HI> he received an Invitation
from the Inhabitants of <HI>Welney,</HI> or <HI>Welneth,</HI> a Hamlet in the Parish
of <HI>Upwell</HI> in the same County, to preach in a certain Privileg'd
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Independent Chapel in this Parish; the Right of the Place em∣powering
the Inhabitants to choose their own Minister.</P>
<P>After long and earnest Sollicitations from the Inhabitants of
<HI>Wilney,</HI> and with the Consent of his former Hearers, he agreed
to go to <HI>Wilney,</HI> and accordingly went and settled with his Family
in the Parsonage-house or Tenement belonging to the said Chapel.</P>
<P>The Freedom with which the Inhabitants of <HI>Wilney</HI> invited
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to be their Curate, appear'd in their chearful assisting
him in his Removal thither, and preparing a Feast for his Recep∣tion;
all the Neighbours in general meeting him to bid him
Welcome.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight or Three-weeks after his Settlement at <HI>Wil∣ney,</HI>
the Reverend Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> came to pay him
a Visit, thank'd him for coming to the said Chapel, and decla∣red
that he was glad his Parishioners were like to be so well serv'd.</P>
<P>In this Chapel Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> continued about seven Years, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the Year 1695 to the Year 1702, Preaching twice a day, and Con∣forming
in all things to the Usage of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But
in process of Time being dissatisfied in his Conscience at the Use of
the Liturgy, he began at several times to omit such part of the Ser∣vice
as he dislik'd; till at last his Scruples encreasing, he wholly o∣mitted
the Common Prayer, applying himself only to the Pulpit,
and conceiving he was not under equal Obligation as if Preaching
in a Parish-Church, the Chapel he preach'd in being wholly In∣dependent,
a Privileg'd Place, and in the Power of the People.</P>
<P>As this was the Original of all the subsequent Malice of the
Church-Clergy, and of the barbarous Proceedings of which we
are to give an Account; so they are hereby fairly challeng'd to
produce one Shadow of a Crime in his Behaviour, which, Humane
Frailty excepted, appears wholly blameless, and which we shall
produce such Testimonials to justifie, as few of the Clergy of
the Church can produce more, and such as indeed no honest
Man need desire better.</P>
<P>If this Offence were as great as they would suppose it to be,
it yet admits of much to be said in Extenuation; as, I. His
Scruples of Conscience, which would not permit him to continue
the Exercise of the Common Prayer and Ceremonies, at least
not in all parts; 2. His officiating in a private Independent Chapel,
in which, as before, he thought himself not oblig'd to an exact
and compleat Conformity.</P>
<P>But, to oblige our Adversary, we'll suppose it as heinous a
Crime as they can pretend to, yet they will have enough to do
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
to make it out that their Proceedings with him have been legal, ra∣tional,
just, or humane: And for the Truth of this Suggestion,
we refer to the Particulars, and freely make all unprejudic'd
Members of their own Church the Judges: this Independency of
the Chapel of <HI>Wilney</HI> will in some measure appear as follows.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> understanding that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
omitted the Common Prayer, came to him, and told him, he was
sorry he (Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>) did not hold to his Principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that
he must therefore dispossess him, and put in another Curate.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> replied, He was not, nor ever had been, his Cu∣rate,
and that it was not in his (Dr. <HI>Gregg</HI>'s) Power to dispossess
him; and therewith Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> shew'd the Doctor <HI>his Authority for
holding</HI> the Place, which satisfied Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> so that he never of∣fer'd
him the least Disturbance afterward.</P>
<P>After some time Dr. <HI>Gregg</HI> died, and the Rectory of <HI>Upwell</HI> was
given to one Mr. <HI>Hubbart</HI>; but he being a weakly Man, and in
a deep Consumption, he put in a Curate to Officiate; <HI>viz.</HI> one
Mr. <HI>Hugh James.</HI></P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding his Parishioners flocking after Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
and but few caring to hear him, he exprest his Displeasure fre∣quently
in threatning and malicious Speeches against Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; but
the Incumbent Mr. <HI>Hubbart</HI> being a pious and peaceable Man,
would not permit him to molest Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> during his Life: but this
was not long; for, in about a Year and a half the said Mr. <HI>Hub∣bart,</HI>
the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> died, and the Living was then given
to the said Curate, Mr. <HI>Hugh James.</HI></P>
<P>As this Mr. <HI>James</HI> was a Man both of a different Temper and
Character from his two honest Predecessors, he resolv'd to strain
his Authority to the utmost, in order to dispossess Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI></P>
<P>The first Step he took in this Undertaking, was that about the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>
He comes to <HI>Wilney</HI> on a Lord's-day, and
demands the Pulpit for the morning: Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> quietly permit∣ted
him to Preach; which he did, or rather Rail, at an uncom∣mon
rate, against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> bending his whole Discourse to set
out the heinous Sin of Omitting the holy Ceremonies, and telling
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> from the Pulpit, that he ought to lie at the Chapel-door
for three or four Months in Sackcloth, not daring to tread up∣on
that Consecrated Ground, begging the People to pray to
God for him to forgive him that Sin: and to prove this, quo∣ted,
as we are told, several Popish Writers, but not one Text
of Scripture as can be remembred; running on in such a virulent
Stile and unsuitable manner, that many of the Inhabitants could
not bear to hear him, but went out of the Chapel.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13"/>
In the Afternoon there was no Sermon; for the said Mr.
<HI>James,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> gave notice to the People to meet him
after Dinner at an Alehouse, where he Treated them with Li∣quor,
and, as a place more proper for the Subject, preach'd the
Second Part to his Morning Sermon, and bestow'd another plenti∣ful
storm of ill Language on Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> desiring the Inhabitants to
set their Hands to a Letter, Petition, or Paper written to the
<HI>Bishop,</HI> in order to get Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> turn'd out: But they all unani∣mously
refus'd him.</P>
<P>Being disappointed in his Expectations, and having spent his
Breath, as well as Ale, to no purpose, he went, as is reported,
that very Night to <HI>Ely,</HI> and the next Week to <HI>London,</HI> to com∣plain
against Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Wilney</HI> having discovered the Design, and
being very loth to part with their Minister, importun'd Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
to draw up a Petition to the Lord <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Norwich,</HI> in order to
prevent Mr. <HI>James</HI> from obtaining his malicious Design.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> at the Desire of his Congregation, did draw up the
said Petition, which was Sign'd by near 80 Hands of the Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Wilney,</HI> and sent up to the Lord <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI> (by
the Post) who receiv'd it, as is supposed, before the said Mr.
<HI>James</HI> got thither.</P>
<P>Soon after the Arrival of the Petition, the Rector Mr. <HI>James</HI>
came up to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and makes his Complaint against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
desiring he might be dismist: but his Lordship (as Mr. <HI>James</HI>
himself has reported) answer'd, That he had heard a very good
Report of the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> from his Neighbourhood, That by the
Right of the Place the Choice of a Minister was in the Inhabi∣tants,
and they testifying to his Behaviour, he could not dismiss
him, or credit the Accusation of one Man against the unanimous
Voice of the whole Town, or Words to that effect. But, in
short, he rejected the Request of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and refus'd to Cen∣sure
or Dispossess Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding himself disappointed here, applies himself to
the Spiritual Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and about <HI>May</HI> 1702 procures a
Citation against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to appear at <HI>Norwich.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> obey'd
the Citation very readily, appear'd at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and retain'd one
Mr. <HI>Batchelour</HI> as his Proctor to manage his Defence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding himself still defeated, and not venturing to
proceed in the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> let drop his Citation,

Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> with another Citation.</P>

While this was depending, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> going to <HI>Cambridge</HI> to Vote
in the Election of Knights of the Shire, being possest of a Glebe
to the Chapel as a Freehold, came into the Company of Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> Jen<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>gs</HI>
Knight, who pretending Friendship to Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and his
Neighbours who were there present, began to perswade them
to part quietly and lovingly; and to avoid continual Fewds,
perswaded Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to quit the Chapel of <HI>Wilney,</HI> as a Place not
worth so much Fewd and Contest; and upon his doing so, he
promis'd <HI>he would engage on the behalf of Mr. James,</HI> the Suit in the
Spiritual Court should go no farther.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> consented, and tho' much against the minds of the In∣habitants,
agreed to leave <HI>Wilney,</HI> and depending on the Promise
of Sir <HI>R. Jen<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>gs,</HI> omitted any regard of the Suit at <HI>Norwich</HI>;
where, for want of his appearing, and <HI>that worthy Knight break∣ing
his word with him,</HI> they proceeded to Excommunication against
him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> having thus quitted his Charge, had a Call from <HI>Lincoln∣shire</HI>
to a Dissenting Congregation; which Call, after some time,
he accepted, and accordingly remov'd to go thither. And here
'tis necessary to advertise the Reader; that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was so far
from a hasty Flight, or any precipitance in his Remove, that he
was near ten Weeks resolving, removing, and settling his Fami∣ly

<P>In this Interval, and when it is plain these Gentlemen them∣selves
knew every day where to find Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and that he was fre∣quently
in the Town of <HI>Wilney,</HI> and never conceal'd himself or
absconded from any body, yet even then one of the most impu∣dent
Forgeries that can be paralell'd in this Age, was practis'd

<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> has been inform'd, this black piece of Malice had its
birth in <HI>Jesus College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> concerted there between
Dr. <HI>Cook,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> and their Confederates; but
as he is not positive in that, he shall be glad of an Occasion to ask
their Pardon for the Suggestion when they shall have purg'd them∣selves
honourably from the Suspicion; and till then, thinks the
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
Grounds he has for his Opinion are sufficient to clear him of any
breach of Charity in believing it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was with his Family upon the Road from <HI>Wilney</HI> into
<HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> when this Publication was first made; and coming
to <HI>Boston</HI> on a Thanksgiving-Day, he rested, and went to the Dis∣senting
Meeting to hear the Sermon; when, after Sermon, Mr.
<HI>Keeling</HI> the Minister took him home to his House, and shew'd him
the <HI>Gazette</HI> with the aforesaid Advertisement in it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> surpriz'd at the Reading of this <HI>Gazette,</HI> as he well
might, immediately took Horse, leaving his Family in <HI>Boston,</HI> and
resolv'd to go to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where he expected to find out the
bottom of the matter.</P>
<P>In this place it will be necessary to leave Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> a while, and
the Reader may suppose him Travelling to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> with a Heart
full of Trouble to see himself persecuted with so much Malice, and
in hopes to find out his Enemies and their Design. And while he
is on the Road, let us enquire upon what sorry and sandy Founda∣tion
all this Fabrick of Malice and Folly was erected, which will at
last tend to lessen the Wonder at the Authors being confounded in
their own Devices.</P>
<P>There had been a Man in <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl whose Name was <HI>Gill</HI> (<HI>but,
to avoid all possible Cavil, 'tis noted his Name was not</HI> ABRAHAM
GILL, <HI>but</HI> Stephen Clifford <HI>alias</HI> Gill. This Man having been
Committed for Forging Holy Orders, and Counterfeiting the
Coins, and Convicted of both, had broke out of the County Jayl
at <HI>Derby,</HI> and was fled from Justice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> having been inform'd of this
by his Attorney, immediately fixes it upon Mr. <HI>Gill, and he must
be the Man:</HI> And to bring this Plot to a Head, takes the pains, a∣bout
<HI>June</HI> 1702, to send to <HI>Derby,</HI> and informing the Jaylor there
that his Prisoner was found, procures two Men to be sent from <HI>Der∣by</HI>
to seize him, and so sure was he of his Game, that he openly gave
it out that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had broke out of Jayl, and he should be hang'd.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the two Men sent by the Jaylor came over to
<HI>Wilney,</HI> and pretending extraordinary Business with Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> sent
for him to an Ale-house in <HI>Wilney.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> went boldly, as inno∣cently,
to them; and as they were Strangers, and had pretended
Business, he wonder'd they discours'd with him of several Things,
treated him courteously, paid the Reckoning, but never spoke a
a word of any Business to him, only frequently whisper'd toge∣ther,
and left him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
The Truth of this after came out, and Mr. <HI>Brookhouse</HI> Jaylor
of <HI>Derby</HI> discovered the whole Affair to Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> how and on what
Pretence the two Men were procur'd to be sent from <HI>Derby,</HI> whose
Business with him was <HI>to have apprehended him</HI>; but the reason of
their leaving him as they did, was, because they found <HI>he was not
that Man.</HI></P>
<P>By this Discovery Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> came to know that Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s As∣sistant
in this new Plot was one <HI>Thomas Johnson</HI> an Attorney of <HI>Out∣well,</HI>
a Man of ill Fame and foul Practice, who positively affirm'd
to the two Men that came from <HI>Derby,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was the same
Man that broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl.</P>
<P>This Delusion might in some measure have pleaded in Excuse of
Mr. <HI>James,</HI> if his next Scene had not put him out of the reach of
any rational Shelter or Defence; for, not content with this Defeat,
he joyn'd with this infamous Attorney and one <HI>Tho. Beart,</HI> who
since died in a most horrible manner, rotting away above ground.
These three went to one <HI>John Marriot</HI> of <HI>Upwell,</HI> and offer'd to give
him 10 Pounds, or to Guineas, if he would swear that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
was the same Man that had broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl for Forgery and
Counterfeiting.</P>
<P>But here they were defeated again, and Heaven, the only Pro∣tector
of Innocence, so blinded their Understanding, that they al∣ways
made an ill Choice of their Instruments. Honest <HI>John Marriot</HI>
told them plainly, he knew Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was not the same Man; and
ask'd them with what face they could desire him to burthen his
Conscience with a false Oath, or fell his Soul for 10 Guinea's?</P>
<P>By this time the Reader is to suppose Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI>
where having been above 14 Days, and all that while walk∣ing
publickly about the Streets, and openly enquiring about the
Notice in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> he receiv'd a Message from the Vice-Chan∣cellour
of <HI>Cambridge</HI> to come to him to <HI>Jesus College</HI>; whither, con∣firm'd
and assur'd of his own Innocence, he freely went.</P>
<P>Coming to the College, Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> demanded his Name, which
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> readily told him, and the Place of his last Residence and
Preaching; <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Wilney.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> told him that he was describ'd
in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> and upon the Advertisement therein he must send
him to Jayl; which he accordingly did on the 24th of <HI>March</HI> to the
<HI>Tolhooth</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> by a <HI>Mittimus</HI> in the following Words, or
to that effect:<Q><PB N="13" REF="18"/><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="warrant">
<OPENER>To the Keeper of the <HI>Tolbooth Goal</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> these.</OPENER>
<P>I Send you herewith the Body of <HI>Abraham Gill,</HI> whom I charge you
to keep till discharg'd by due Course of Law.</P>

<P>Thus, without any Proof that he was the Man mention'd in the
<HI>Gazette,</HI> without any Oath, or any Crime alledg'd, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was
Committed to Prison by the worthy Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>; of which 'tis pre∣sum'd
he may hear again in a different manner than this.</P>
<P>Nor was the sending him to Prison the End of their Malice, but
as soon as he came thither he had heavy Irons laid upon him, and
was fetter'd like a Fellon or a Highway-man.</P>
<P>At the General Quarter-Sessions Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being call'd, and Dr.
<HI>Cook</HI> sitting on the Bench, the Dr. told him, Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> they had
nothing to charge him with: He told them, Then they had done
him a great deal of Wrong to keep him in Custody so long, and
treat him so hardly, and loading him with Irons: And as they had
now nothing against him, he hoped they never would; and there∣fore
pray'd they would Discharge him.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, they remanded him to Prison. Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>
alledg'd he had a Letter from Mr. <HI>James,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> full of
Crimes against Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; in which Letter, it seems, he desir'd
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> might be kept close Prisoner till the next Quarter Ses∣sions.</P>
<P>In
Obedience to this Command of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> endea∣vour'd
to keep Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Prison: but the Barbarity of this
Treatment appearing so exceeding great, and the Action so foul
that the Country began to talk of it, some Gentlemen of the Country
having spoken of it to Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>'s Disadvantage, which coming to
his Ears, he was at last prevail'd upon to accept of Bail for Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
two eminent Freeholders of that Conuty of 80 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> each of∣fering
to be his Bail.</P>
<P>The Bail being such as could not be objected against, <HI>The
Dr. let him go,</HI> binding his Bail in 60 <HI>l.</HI> each, and himself in 120 <HI>l.</HI>
to appear at the Quarter-Sessions.</P>
<P>This Usage of Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> with the Fury and Barbarity of their Cu∣rate
and Rector, had so wrought upon the Inhabitants of <HI>Upwell,</HI> to∣gether
with the known Innocence of their Minister, that it fill'd
them with just Prejudices, and they unanimously invited Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
to come and Preach to them as a Congregation Dissenting from the
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
Church; which he did, duly Licencing the Place in the Arch∣deacon's
Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and duly Qualifying himself according
to Law.</P>
<P>From whence the Author of these Sheets humbly observes, and
recommends it to the Consideration of the Clergy of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> Whether such unjust and cruel Treatment of their
Fellow-Christians, Neighbours and Brethren, is the Way to con∣firm
the People in their Adherence to the Church of <HI>England</HI>; or
whether they do not rather Wound the Church, drive their Pa∣rishioners
from her, fill them with Prejudices, and encrease the
Number of the Dissenters in this Nation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being thus settled among his old People, and knowing
that he was to appear at the Quarter Sessions, where he had good
reason to expect all the foul Usage his Enemies wer capable
of, and where he saw their Power was but too great, was advised
to remove it by <HI>Certiorari</HI> to the <HI>Queens-bench</HI>; which he did
accordingly, the <HI>Certiorari</HI> being allow'd in Court, and the Fees
of it paid by Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> the Curate hearing of this
<HI>Certiorari,</HI> they, or one of them, went to <HI>Cambridge</HI> at the As∣size;
and applying themselves to my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> by
the means of Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> and Dr. <HI>James,</HI> they procur'd a <HI>Habeas Cor∣pus</HI>
to remove Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to <HI>Norwich</HI> Jayl, pretending they could
prove Matter of Fact against him there.</P>
<P>Accordingly he was Committed to <HI>Norwich</HI> Jayl for Felony,
Forgery, Trespass, Contempt, and other high Crimes and Misde∣meanours.</P>
<P>Here
the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> lay till the Assizes; and still his Ene∣mies
being able to bring nothing against him, he mov'd, by his
Conncil, to be Discharg'd, and was Discharg'd accordingly, by
Order of the Court; which Order is there to be seen upon
Record.</P>
<P>Here he was credibly inform'd Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
striving by some other Machinations and Conspiracies to have
continued Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Jayl to the next Assizes, receiv'd a severe
Reprimand from the Lord Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> for their unjust and
inhumane Treatment of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; and that his Lordship threat∣ned
them with Suspension upon that account.</P>
<P>Also that Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> the Register of the Spiritual Court at <HI>Nor∣wich,</HI>
being enquir'd of concerning his Name being put into the
Advertisement in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> as, that he would give a Reward
for the Apprehending Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; declared it was done without his
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
Privity or Consent, and that it was a meer genuine Forgery; that
he knew nothing of it, but that it was as strange and surprizing to
find his Name there, as it could be to Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to see his there.</P>
<P>Thus being return'd to his People, Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
whom henceforward, in Charity to them, I shall conceal under
the Title of the Conspirators, theratned him, that if he presu∣med
yet to Preach there, he should be sent to Prison again:
But he continuing to do his Duty, it remains to examine how
punctual they were to their Words with him.</P>
<P>About the 13th of <HI>April</HI> 1704, one <HI>Thomas Pitchford,</HI> Constable
of <HI>Wilney,</HI> serv'd a Warrant on Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> under the Hand of <HI>Tho.
Edwards</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Justice of the Peace for the <HI>Isle of Ely</HI>; the War∣rant
requiring the said Constable to bring Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> before him
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the 20th of the same Month at <HI>Wisbich.</HI></P>
<P>The Constable having serv'd his Warrant, took Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s
Word for his Appearing; but Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> one of the Con∣spirators,
came in a great Passion, and railing at the Constable,
told him he must keep Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> close Prisoner till his Appearnce,
for that then he should certainly go to Jayl; and if he went away
from him, he <HI>the Constable</HI> should go to Jayl in his room, and more
ill Language to the like effect: however, the Constable still took
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Word for his Appearance.</P>
<P>On the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> being a Sessions, the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> ap∣pear'd,
according to his Promise, at <HI>Wisbich,</HI> where was present
7 or 8 Justices, several Gentlemen, some Clergy men, and the
Conspirators.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> one of <HI>the Conspirators,</HI> call'd the Constable to bring
up <HI>Gill</HI> his Prisoner: upon which Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> readily appear'd. The
<HI>Conspirators</HI> immediately told their Tale, and giving Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> base
and scurrilous Language, according to their particular Talent,
which abounds that way, they inform'd the Justices that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
bred great Disturbances in the Parish by a Conventicle, as Con∣venticles
did all <HI>England</HI> over. <HI>Which, by the way, might be the
only Truth they spoke:</HI> for it seems by these very Words he bred no
more Disturbance with his Conventicle than other Ministers did
with theirs; <HI>ergo,</HI> they should be all serv'd so. <HI>Shortest Way for
that.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> one of the Justices, taking up the Cause, told
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> he was inform'd he kept an unlawful Assembly or Conven∣ticle
at <HI>Upwell,</HI> and gave him a great deal of rough and threat∣ning
Language.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> with Calmness and Respect replied, He own'd he kept
a Meeting for Religious Worship at <HI>Upwell</HI> in the County of <HI>Nor∣folk,</HI>
but, that it was no unlawful Assembly; for the Place was
Licensed according to Law, and he had qualified himself as the
Law Directs: and therefore hoped he did not deserve to receive
such Abuse in that place.</P>
<P>The Justice then Demanded to see the Licence by which the
said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> held the Meeting; which he producing, both the
<HI>Conspirators</HI> said in open Court it was Forged: and whether the
Court believed them or no, is uncertain, or what other reason
they had for it will be enquir'd in another place, but they imme∣diately
made a <HI>Mittimus</HI> and Committed Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to the Jayl in
<HI>Wisbich</HI>—for Forging a Licence, and Preaching in a Conven∣ticle.
And taking the Licence from him, they refus'd to restore
it him.</P>
<P>They demanded indeed Bail, but gave him no leave to find it,
refusing to let him stir out of the place: But Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> may, with∣out
Detriment to his Cause allow all their Pretensions of Bail for
his Behaviour, since the Treatment he had received from them was
such, as he might be sure whoever he had brought to be his
Bail should be brought into equal Trouble; and for that Reason
he resolv'd to embroil none of his Friends.</P>
<P>And being sensible of no Crime for which he ought by the
Law to be bound to his Behaviour, he was advis'd not to of∣fer
any Bail, and refer it to the Law still to decide whether—it
could be justly demanded.</P>
<P>The Wisdom as well as Justice of these Magistrates is very re∣markable
also here, that they should know no better than to
Commit a Man in the <HI>Isle of Ely</HI> for a Fact pretended to be com∣mitted
in the County of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; all which will help to their
Consolation when they shall come to answer for it before a
Court and Judges that understand the Law.</P>
<P>And as I undertook at first to prove every thing as I went along,
the following Affidavit is an undoubted Testimony of the Truth
of this last part of the Tragedy; <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Conspirators</HI> charg∣ing
him with Forgery, which they could not pretend to prove,
and their treating him with base scurrilous Language, tho' all of
them are pleas'd to deny it upon Oath.<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Cole</HI>'s Affidavit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOseph Cole</HI> of <HI>Upwell,</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> Gent,
maketh Oath, That <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> of <HI>Welney</HI> in the <HI>Isle of</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
<HI>Ely</HI> and County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> is a Preacher to a Congre∣gation
of her Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects in <HI>Up∣well</HI>
aforesaid, having been a Preacher in the said Parish of
<HI>Welney</HI> for several Years last past, and that he is now, and
hath all the time, been well approved of his Congregation.
And this Deponent farther saith, That on or about the 20th
day of <HI>April</HI> last past, he saw the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> brought be∣fore
Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace at <HI>Wisbich</HI> in the
said Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> by vertue of a Warrant to answer the
Complaint of Mr. <HI>Hugh James</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell</HI> aforesaid;
and that at that time there was one Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> Curate
to the said Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James</HI> in presence; and
that the said Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> commanded the Constable (who
then had the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Custody) to bring up <HI>Gill</HI>
his Prisoner, which the Constable did; when and where Mr.
<HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> alledged, That the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
kept an unlawful Conventicle. And Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to justifie the
keeping of a lawful Meeting for Worship of <HI>God,</HI> produced his
Licence; whereupon the said Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
affirmed, That the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had forged the Licence, and
they gave the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> very base, unbecoming, and scur∣rilous
Language, which Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to my Knowledge, did not
deserve, nor did it become them to utter; and afterwards,
upon this way of Complaint, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was committed to the
Jayt in <HI>Wisbich</HI> aforesaid. And this Deponent verily be∣lieves,
That the said Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have
maliciously designed to ruin and undo the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and
his Family, consisting of a Wife and four small Children;
for they have, by several barbarous ways of Prosecution, ut∣terly
reduced the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and his Family to Pover∣ty.
And this Deponent verily believes, that the said Mr.
<HI>Gill</HI> never gave either Mr. <HI>James</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> any
cause of Offence, nor did they, or ever could they, prove
any cause of their malicious Prosecution. But this Depo∣nent
verily believes, that the cause of this Malice of Mr.
<HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> was because

<P>In this Condition Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> remain'd a close Prisoner without Bail
till the General Quarter-Sessions, which was about five Days;
when, he expected to be call'd and lawfully charg'd with some
matter of Misdemeanour, or else to be discharg'd.</P>
<P>But now the Plot was ripe for Execution, and at the Quarter-Sessions
he was omitted, and never call'd at all.</P>
<P>The Assizes follow'd in two Days more, <HI>viz. April</HI> 26. 1704.
when he design'd to move for his Discharge, not doubting but he
should find Justice there, as he had before at <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>But the Design was calculated <HI>to disappoint him here too,</HI> and now
the black Scene opened; for on the said 26th of <HI>April,</HI> being the
first Day of the Assizes, the <HI>Conspirators</HI> had procur'd two Justi∣ces,
in Concert with themselves, to come to <HI>Wisbich, tho' above</HI> 20
<HI>Miles out of their own Division.</HI></P>
<P>The Names of these worthy Gentlemen are, (<HI>for they deserve to
be recorded</HI>) <HI>David Rowland</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Francis Fern</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Clerk;
for this Gentleman is both Clergyman and Magistrate, of whom we
shall say no more, till Justice thinks fit to take Cognisance of them,
and treat them as they deserve.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen, who now made up the number of the <HI>Conspi∣rators</HI>
to be four, brought with them one Captain <HI>Marshal,</HI> an Of∣ficer
in Colonel <HI>Lutteril</HI>'s Regiment of <HI>Marines,</HI> in order to Im∣press,
List, and Carry away this innocent Man as a Souldier, by
Virtue of the Law for Listing Vagabonds.</P>
<P>There were several Officers in the Town who wou'd have been
very willing to have rais'd Men, and who stay'd there for that pur∣pose;
but the Country had rung too loud of the Injury done this
poor Man, so that no Officer that knew the Circumstance, could be
imagin'd <HI>Villain enough</HI> to confederate; but this Gentleman having
the Word of a Justice of Peace, and <HI>a Man of God made a Magistrate,</HI>
might the more easily be imposed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Upon the Arrival of these Gentlemen, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was sent for
out of Prison to the Sign of the <HI>Bell</HI> in <HI>Wisbich.</HI> All the <HI>Conspi∣rators</HI>
being present, the Church Justice began with him in base and
villainous Language, as unbecoming his Commission as his Gown,
calling him <HI>Disturber of the Country,</HI> and <HI>Sawcy Fellow</HI> for answer∣ing
for himself; told him he was <HI>a Drunkard, a Swearer,</HI> and a
great deal to the same purpose; that he rais'd a Conventicle in
Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s Parish, Impair'd the Congregation at the Church,
which was a thing of bad Consequence, and <HI>ought to be supprest</HI>;
and that he was not fit to live in the Country, but to Serve
Her Majesty, and that therefore he should go for a Souldier.</P>
<P>This Justice <HI>Fern,</HI> being justly asham'd of this Treatment, is
pleas'd upon his Oath to deny giving any ill Language: and there∣fore,

<P>There was present another Justice of the Peace, one <HI>John Bella∣my</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who at first vigorously oppos'd these Gentlemen; told
them he found Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had a Licence, and he verily believ'd it was
a good one; that if he (Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>) was guilty of any Crimes, he ought
to be Tryed for them; and, that now was a good time to do
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
it in, the Judges being in Town, and the Assizes begun, and ad∣vis'd
them to consider if their Authority extended to Pressing
him for a Souldier.</P>
<P>This wholsome Advice (<HI>which they may have leisure to repent they
did not accept of</HI>) they over-rul'd: They flew into some Heat at
Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s arguing for him, and told him, tho' they were not
in their own Division, yet they were Justices there as well as he,
and expected that they had a Power to act all over the Isle; and
if they had any Power they would try it, for <HI>the said</HI> Gill <HI>should
be Imprest,</HI> and sent for a Souldier, and they would answer it—At
which Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> was over-ruled, and joyn'd with them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> told them, That besides his Profession, which he sup∣pos'd
exempted him from such an Insult as that, he had two
Qualifications expresly excepted in the Act, and which legally
forbid them what they now purpos'd to do—First, That he
was <HI>a Freeholder of England</HI>; and Secondly, That he was <HI>a Free∣man
of a Corporation</HI>; both which were expresly nam'd in the Act
of Parliament, as Qualifications excepted.</P>
<P>Justice <HI>Bellamy</HI> urg'd again, That these were material Objections,
and ask'd him, Where he was a Freeholder, and for How much?
He told them he was a Freeholder to the Value of 10 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI>
Land of Inheritance in the County of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> where he was
born, and a Freeman of the Corporation of <HI>Wigan.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> urg'd again, that he should be remanded to Prison
till they could send to the Place to be inform'd—. But the Plot
was otherwise laid, and they resolv'd he should go; so they
call'd Captain <HI>Marshal,</HI> and order'd him to give him 20 S. which
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> refus'd: then they order'd his Name to be entred in a
Certificate for Imprest Men, and the Justices Sign'd it, and Deli∣vered
him over to the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Fern</HI> in particular call'd to
the Souldiers, and bid them tear his Band off, and take him along
with them, and use him <HI>Severely,</HI> (<HI>in so many Words.</HI>) Which
Command the Souldiers took care to execute; for they carried
him into a large Room crowded with Prest Men, where he had
nothing but Straw to lie on. And in this Posture and Place he
remain'd, sitting up in his Cloaths and Boots for six or seven days,
and then was oblig'd to march on foot in his Boots, Riding-Coat,
<HI>&amp;C.</HI> to <HI>Downham</HI> 12 Miles, and from thence to <HI>Ely</HI> 16, and thence
to <HI>Cambridge</HI> 10 or 12.</P>

<P>To return to Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI> The Fateagne of this violent March re∣duc'd
him to a very miserable Condition; his Feet and Legs gall'd
and swell'd with his Boots, and his Blood, as may be supposed, sur∣feited
and heated with unusual Force beyond his Strength.</P>
<P>Thus you have the History of his Delivery over to the Soldiers;
with whom, and in the Condition as above, he came to <HI>Cambridge</HI>;
where he was arrested for Debt, and so by one Misfortune deli∣vered
from another.</P>
<P>They used some Attempts to clear him from this Arrest; but
the Debt appearing to be real, and too much for them to discharge,
being 27 <HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> they were forc'd to leave him in the <HI>Tollbooth</HI>
Prison at <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Conspirators, who concluded their Work was done, and
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> carried clear off, were under no small Disappointment
when they heard he was gotten out of their Hands: and tho' they
could not but know where he was, yet, in pursuit of their old De∣sign,
they issued Hue and Cry to apprehend him as a Deserter from
the Queen's Service, and Mr. <HI>Fern</HI> the <HI>Church-Justice</HI> sign'd the Hue
and Cry. This failing, they issued a special private Warrant to
Constables at <HI>Upwell, Wilney,</HI> and <HI>Maney,</HI> to make search for him,
and still <HI>the reverend Mr.</HI> Fern'<HI>s Hand was to this also,</HI> as by the War∣rant
now secured and remaining with the Constables of <HI>Wilney</HI> will
appear.</P>
<P>It was now high time for Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to take Sanctuary in the Law;
and going to Counsel in the Case, he was advised to move in the
<HI>Queen's Bench</HI> for a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> to discharge him from enrolling
or listing in the Army: which he did, and obtain'd it accord∣ingly;
and also a Rule of Court for all the <HI>Conspirators</HI> to show
Cause, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And now these Gentlemen having run their Length, the Tables
were turn'd, and the Time began to come when they must render
an Acount to her Majesty and the Law for all this Oppression of her
Subjects, Contempt of her Authority, and Abuse of the Power
put into their Hands by the Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29"/>
The <HI>Conspirators</HI> appear'd at the <HI>Queen's Bench</HI> Court in <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
and mov'd for Time, and several Motions being made alter∣nately,
in order to bring in Affidavits; at last they found themselves
so press'd by the Course of the Law, that they were obliged to have
Recourse to their old stock of Villany they had work'd upon be∣fore,
and form'd a second Conspiracy to bring Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> into Con∣tempt
of the Court; the detecting whereof will conclude this part
of our History: and the future Rewards Justice will bestow upon
them for these things, are reserv'd to their proper Season; and
may serve for a Second Part of this Account.</P>
<P>After seven Weeks Imprisonment at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> having
made up matters with his Creditor was releas'd, and went home to
his Family at <HI>Welney,</HI> showing himself publickly, and Preaching
every Week to his Congregation as usual; for now the <HI>Conspirators</HI>
saw he was out of their power, and whatever they did they must
expect to account for.</P>
<P>At last they mov'd the Court that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> might appear in Per∣son
to accuse them, which was granted, and appointed to be on
the 4th of <HI>July</HI> last.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Attorney sent him Notice of this Order, and he immedi∣ately
went for <HI>London</HI>; and setting out on the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> in order
to his appearing in the Court, with one Mr. <HI>Tokelove</HI> in his Com∣pany,
he was arrested on the Road about 6 Miles from his own
House, by one <HI>Betts</HI> a Bailiff, in an Island Warrant, at the Suit of
one <HI>John Smith</HI> of <HI>Downham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Betts</HI> the Bailiff holding him to Bail, carry'd Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to <HI>Maypole,</HI>
a little Village, 10 Miles from his own House, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being ex∣ceedingly
surpriz'd at this Arrest, knowing the Consequence of
his Disappointment, perswaded the Bayliff to go back with him,
5 Miles to <HI>Maney,</HI> where he got some Friends to be his Bail.</P>
<P>This ended the Trifle of the Arrest; but the <HI>Conspirators</HI> End
was answered by it; for by that time Bail was given it was After∣noon,
and there was no possibility of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s being in Court
at the time appointed, which was the next Morning, being not
able to ride all night, nor to ride so hard as to reach to <HI>London</HI>
time enough, (sending Mr. <HI>Tokelove,</HI> who was then with him, for∣ward
to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to make Oath of what had pass'd, which he
did accordingly, as will appear by his Affidavit) being above 60
Miles, <HI>so he went back to his own House.</HI></P>
<P>The Court resented his Default, and the <HI>Conspirators</HI> took Care
to have it improv'd to his Disadvantage: But before we come to
relate the Consequences of the Contempt in Court, 'tis proper to
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
examine the Contrivances of this Arrest, and some subsequent Ma∣nagement

this was a Choak Pare for him, and was procur'd by Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI>

very full, and a Confirmation of several things already advanced
here, we refer to the Copy of it duly attested, as follows.<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="affidavit">
<P><HI>RIchard Tokelove</HI> of <HI>Upwell,</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI>
Yeoman, maketh Oath, That Mr. <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> of <HI>Welney,</HI>
in the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> and County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> did never
serve at <HI>Welney</HI> Chappel as Curate to Dr. <HI>Gragge,</HI> or to
any one else, to his this Deponent's Knowledge; but was a
Preacher elected and chose by the Congregation and Feoffees,
in a time when the Chappel was vacant; and this Deponent's
Opinion is, That it was in the said Feoffees and Congregation's
Power to elect their Minister. And this Deponent farther
saith, That the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was a Freeholder for several
Years in <HI>Welney,</HI> and lived in good Fame and Plenty all the
time of two pious and sober Rectors of the said Parish; and
was well approved of both for Doctrine, Charity, and Be∣haviour.
And this Deponent farther saith, That since Mr.
<HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have been so malicious against
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> he is elected and chosen a Preacher to a Dissenting
Congregation of Protestants in <HI>Upwell</HI> aforesaid; and is able
in Doctrine religious, and of sober Life and Conversation,
and highly approved of with his Congregation, and most of
his Neighbours, and with most his Acquaintance; but Mr.
<HI>James</HI> our present Rector at <HI>Upwell,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
his Curate (as this Deponent very believes) envying the said
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and maliciously designing to ruin him and his Fa∣mily
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
hath scandalously, maliciously, and without Cause,
spread abroad evil, unjust, and undeserving Characters of
the said Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> which, by Strangers and Persons remote
and Ill-wishers to the Dissenting Party, may perhaps be belie∣ved
as coming from such Authors; and this Deponent farther
saith, That it is his Opinion that by insinuating Speeches and
Threatnings the said Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have
caused the Clerk, one <HI>Thomas Fewlis</HI> (who is a loose, idle,
and wicked Person) to swear contrary to his Knowledge, and
to the Truth, and that only for fear of losing his Clerk's Place
and their Favour; and this Deponent the rather believes this,
because he hath heard the said <HI>Fewlis</HI> commend the said Mr.
<HI>Gill,</HI> and set forth a quite contrary-Character of him. And
this Deponent farther saith, That the said Mr. <HI>James</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have given Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> very unjust Prosecuti∣on
which hath reduc'd him to Poverty, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> having been
imprisoned at their Complaint in several Goals, (<HI>viz.</HI>) at
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1702, and <HI>Aprill, May, June,</HI>
and <HI>July</HI> 1704, and removed to <HI>Norwich</HI> Goal, and kept
Prisoner all the Assize Week, till discharged the last Day ac∣cording
to Law; and believes that he was entered in the
Goaler's Calender <HI>July</HI> 1703: And after their Threatning
to imprison him again if he presumed to serve and preach to
our Congregation any more, they have this last <HI>April</HI> persecu∣ted
and imprisoned the said Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and (without shewing
Cause of the Imprisonment, or giving any Prosecution at
Sessions or Assizes, which was at the same time of his Im∣prisonment
at <HI>Wisbech</HI>) they caused him to be Imprest out of
Goal for a Soldier, without Liberty to make any Defence,
when at the same time he was our Minister, and well appro∣ved
of, and highly beloved, having (as he may have still) a
very plentiful Allowance for his Maintenance, that way of
Preaching (as this Deponent doth apprehend) being a lawful
Employment for a Maintenance; and his Congregation is
large, consisting of Gentlemen, and very substantial Free∣holders,
as well as Farmers: So that by the way of Prosecuti∣on,
not only Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> but also this Deponent, and all the
said Congregntion are Sufferers; and in truth Mr. <HI>James</HI> did
not only threaten and prosecute Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and procured him
sent to Goal, and imprest for a Soldier, as aforesaid, but po∣sitively
sent to the Meeting-place (though qualified according
to Law) and threatned some of the Congregation, and especi∣cially
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
him this Deponent; and apprehended five several Men
by a Warrant from Mr. <HI>Upwood,</HI> a Justice of the Peace,
and carried them like Felons before the said Mr. <HI>Upwood</HI>;
which Persons (although Mr. <HI>James</HI> is pleased to swear they
were idle Persons) yet some were very substantial Freeholders,
and the rest substantial Farmers, and very honest Men: And
altho' Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> pretend no Malice in
their Prosecution, yet it is a real Truth they have highly abu∣sed
both Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and his Congregation, and constantly preach
railing Sermons, as this Deponent hath heard and believes;
and they are reputed very malitious and troublesome Men in
the Parish, having excommunicated several Men, and totally
ruined one Mr. <HI>Whitworth,</HI> our School-Master; and in
carrying on that malicious Design against him, both Mr. <HI>James</HI>
and his Curate did swear falsly against him at <HI>Swaffam</HI> Sessi∣ons,
as one of the Grand Jury hath declared and affirmed;
and prosecuted the said Mr. <HI>Whitworth,</HI> till they banished
him the Town, causing him to be imprest for a Soldier, as
they did Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI> And this Deponent saith, That it is
credibly affirmed by one <HI>John Marriot,</HI> that they would have
had him to have sworn, That our Minister Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was one
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> a Minister who escaped out of <HI>Darby</HI> Goal about
six Years since, being convict for forging of Holy Orders, and
counterfeiting the King's Coin; (altho' Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had been
in this Country about us nine or ten Years) but the said <HI>John
Marriot</HI> refused to go contrary to his Conscience. And this
Deponent farther saith, That Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was never reported to
be a Swearer or Drunkard, as is alledged in their Affidavits;
and he verily believes he was never once seen to be drunk, nor
heard to swear one Oath since he came into our Country: And
this Deponent is very positive that neither Mr. <HI>James</HI> nor any
that made Affidavits at present against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> have any in∣timate
Acquaintance or personal Knowledge of the said Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
excepting <HI>Nicholas Scott, Tho. Beart,</HI> and <HI>Tho. Fewlis</HI>;
which said <HI>Thomas Fewlis</HI> is overawed to swear to carry
on and vindicate their unjust Prosecution, as this Deponent
believes; and this Deponent verily believes he would for a
Reward swear twice as much on Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Behalf, if request∣ed.
And this Deponent farther saith, That Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was
coming the Morning towards <HI>London,</HI> being the third Day
of <HI>July,</HI> about three a Clock in the Morning, and was arrested
upon the Road in an Action of Debt at the Suit of one <HI>John</HI>

<HI>Smith,</HI> and is now in Custody, and held to Bail; and that
the Bayliff says, the Plaintiff was urged to arrest Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>

<P><HI>IT is enough,</HI> and the Matter of Fact, as here truly related, is Mr.

them on the Conquest his Innocence and the Power of Truth made
upon their procur'd Perjuries, he recommends it to them to con∣sider
of what they have done, and at least shew so much Penitence
as becomes them to make their Appearance in their Cloth tole∣rable.</P>
<P>It remains only, to finish the Vindication of Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to rec∣kon
up a little the numerous Slanders and Reproaches which they
have raised upon his Reputation, and by undoubted Testimony
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
and positive Evidence confront their Calumnies, and clear up his
Character to the Satisfaction of his Friends, who have been too
much impos'd upon, (<HI>and the Author asks their Pardon if he says, have
been something too apt to believe</HI>) and to the Conviction of his Ene∣mies,
who have Triumph'd in a bad Cause, and cry'd <HI>Victoria</HI>
before they put their Armour off.</P>
<P>In order to this, 'tis necessary to set down, in their own Lan∣guage
and the blackest Terms they could invent, all the Calum∣nies
and Abuses they have rais'd upon this poor Man in order to
justifie their ill Practices, and make their Designs tolerable to the
World.</P>
<P>And first, The Publication in the <HI>Gazette</HI> speaks for it self,
and needs no Comment—</P>
<P>And here 'tis very observable, that it yet remains a Mystery who

But the said <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> denying to shew this Deponent

this Deponent made Complaint of the said <HI>Gill,</HI> and his
wicked Practices, to the Lord Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> his Dioce∣san,

But some time after, as this Deponent is credibly informed,

the same Parish; and did in that Barn, on the Sabbath-day,
preach to some Persons of no great Credit: Upon which this

procured a Warrant from the said Mr. <HI>Upton,</HI> to bring be∣fore

great Suspicion of the same, it being only a blank Certificate of

attempted to be Prov'd in any of these Affidavits:<LIST>
<ITEM>That he was ever Employ'd under an Attorney.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Forging a second time Orders under the Hand and Seal of the
Bishop of <HI>Ely.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>This Forgery being Detected at <HI>Bullingbrook</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>His being taken into Custody upon the same.</ITEM>
<ITEM>His making his Escape, and flying from Justice.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And 'tis fairly offer'd to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who we believe has been un∣warily
drawn into this Snare, That if but any one of the above∣said
Articles can be prov'd by him, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> will cease giving
him any Trouble on account of all the rest.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on the bare Recommendation of any
Man, tho' never so great, should allege such black Things as
these upon an innocent Man, and neither he nor his Authors
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
be able to make out one Clause of it: from which we wish him
a good Deliverance, and leave that part to the Issue of the Law.</P>
<P>Indeed we have two hard-mouth'd Fellows that swear heartily;
but these discover so little Wit with their Good-will, that the
easiness of proving them Perjur'd will be as much a Scandal up∣on
their Senses as their Honesty; we mean Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Fowlis</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Clark.</P>
<P>Wherefore we shall begin with this swearing Curate, whose
Oath is, That Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> owns a Child by the Name of <HI>Abraham Gill</HI>
which is elder than a Child he had by his first Wife.</P>
<P>No Man but Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> would ha' been caught in such a <HI>Fool-Trap,</HI>
and have sworn what is so exceeding easie to be detected, the
Children being to be produc'd, and their Ages prov'd.</P>
<P>Now 'tis plain and known to all the Neighbourhood, and a
thing in which 'tis impossible the Truth can be conceal'd, that Mr.
<HI>Gill</HI>'s first Wife has been dead upwards of seven Years, and the el∣dest
Child he has by his present Wife is but five Years and half old,
or thereabout.</P>
<P>The necessary Proof of this is omitted here, not that it is not the
most easie of all this Affair to make out, but because it being to
come before a Court of Justice as matter of Evidence, 'tis referr'd
to the genuine Proof of fact, and the Issue on a Tryal, when Mr.
<HI>Lateward</HI> will do well to produce this little <HI>Abraham in nubibus,</HI> and
prove his Age, and the Time of the Death of the first Wife, and
Marriage of the second, and see how he can make these things out.</P>
<P>As to the Clerk's Affidavit, he has frequently own'd in Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s
hearing since, that he was drunk when he made it, and that he knew
not what was in it, and that if he had known there had been any
such thing in it, he would not have offer'd to ha' sworn it.</P>
<P>'Tis a most unaccountable thing, that Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> should so far
expose himself in his Affidavit, when the Children are all alive,
born in the same Place, their Age register'd in the Parish-book,
and so many living Witnesses of the Time of their Birth; and
we blush for him to think, if he is not hardned beyond the ve∣ry
Father of Lyes himself, what Confusion he must be in, when he
shall be ask'd to produce this Child of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> that must be above
nine Years old, or to name where it was Born, when Registred,
or any Circumstances of the matter.</P>
<P>So much is Malice frequently forsaken of its Sence, that the
just regard Providence always shews to Injur'd Innocence, is the
Safety of all honest Men, causing the Subtilty of wicked false Accu∣sers
to abandon them, and their Folly as well as Wickedness to go
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
hand in hand, that Sin and Shame might come together, and their
false Accusation carry its Detection in it self.</P>
<P>If these Gentlemen have any farther Defence to make, any
more Affidavits to bring into Court, the Editor of this promises
them to give them their full and free place in the second part of this
History; but humbly desires them, whether Clergy-men or Ma∣gistrates,
that, for the Honour and Dignity of their Offices and
Character, and the Justification of their Understandings, that
they would either more nicely adhere to the Matter of Fact, or
more politickly conceal the vicious part, that they may not expose
themselves, and force their humble Servants to detect them, to
avoid the Scandal of Blindness and Stupidity: that they would
leave Trifling, Circling, and going Round-about Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Cha∣racter
with <HI>Supposes,</HI> we <HI>have Heard,</HI> and we <HI>are Inform'd,</HI> and
Says that <HI>he is inform'd,</HI> and the like; but, that they would rather
tell us plainly, and make it out, When he was Drunk, or Swore,
or Broke Jayl, or Forg'd Orders, or Liv'd Scandalously; for
certainly, Gentlemen, these things ought to be made out, or else
to suggest them is a most barbarous Treatment, and a Slander that
redounds to the Infamy of the Contrivers.</P>
<P>AND now we come to present the World with the Account
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> gives of himself, not from his own Mouth, but
from the Mouth of numerous Throngs of Neighbours, Inhabitants,
and Persons both knowing his Character and willing to do Justice.</P>
<P>And first, to obviate the Scandal of his having Forg'd the Hand
and Seal of the Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> and only pretended to have en∣ter'd
into Holy Orders, besides the Original Orders left as afore∣said,

to ruin the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and his Family, consisting of a

Swearer, nor had two Wives at once, but had one Wife, and af∣ter
her Decease married another. And that the said Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>

hath been and is a Man of very sober pious Life and Conversati∣on,
and such a one as we desire may still be our Minister.</P>

<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Gentlemen, to go farther with our Adversaries than
they can expect we should—what if we should suppose for once
that this <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> was this immoral Man they speak of, if he was
such a refin'd Cheat as to have Deluded all the <HI>Many, many honest
People</HI> who have Sworn to his Character, for who knows how far
the Wit and Subtilty of Man, under the Agency of a hardned
Mind, may furnish a Man; and what Mists the Devil may have
laid before the Eyes of Mankind, that this Man should be a Common
Drunkard and Swearer, and Cohabiter with two Women at once,
and a Congregation of several Hundreds of his Hearers where he
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
liv'd all the time know nothing of it, nor his Enemies be able to
produce one Affidavit of any Man that ever saw him Drunk, or
heard him Swear.</P>
<P>But suppose these strange things come to pass, for the World
is full of strange things, what can be Inferr'd from hence to ju∣stifie
the Treatment he has receiv'd, and all the Dissenters through
his Interest?</P>
<P>But on this premis'd Supposition I crave leave to draw a few Infe∣rences,
which shall serve to the Close of this Work.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Forgeries, all the Swearings, Drunkennesses, and
Lewdness they pretend to charge upon him, are antecedent to his
being a Dissenter; and we do not find he receiv'd the least Distur∣bance
in the Execution of his Function on account of these known
Immoralities, and might to this day have kept his two Women
and his Cure of Souls both together, as too many of his Brethren
have done before him, and are like to do after him, for any great
Care we see taken to prevent it, had he but continued to read the
Common Prayer.</P>
<P>I forbear to discant upon this unhappy Truth; and of the many
known Instances of an immoral Clergy, shall repeat none, but ra∣ther
cover the Infirmities of our Guides, that the Obligation, if
possible, may move them both to reform, and to hide those of
their Neighbours.</P>
<P N="2">2. Were all the Immoralities he is charg'd with True, they are
not comparable to those committed in his Prosecution: the Perju∣ries,
Subornations, Cruelties, Injustice, and illegal Proceedings,
are intolerable. This is Casting out Devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince
of Devils: This is the Devil turn'd Reformer.</P>
<P N="3">3. What's all this to going for a Soldier? If every Clergy-man
must be Listed that will be Drunk, if Swearing an Oath will pull a
Man's Band off and send him to the Army, if every Clergy-man
that keeps a Woman more than he should do must go into the Ar∣my,
<HI>Lord have mercy</HI> and <HI>a Cross</HI> ought to be set upon the Doors
of a great many Church-Tenements, and perhaps we need not
have so many severe Acts of Parliament for raising Recruits.</P>
<P>Wherefore, upon the whole matter, we are not so concern'd
to Vindicate Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Character, since were he all they could al∣ledge,
it does not in the least palliate or excuse their Dealings with
him, nor will it be any Extenuation of their illegal Practices when
it comes to be Examin'd before a Court of Justice.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore enough: Let them rummage Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Chara∣cter
to the bottom, let them confute the many Affidavits we have
<PB N="58" REF="63" MS="y"/>
produced, perswade the World to believe him an ill Man, a Drun∣kard,
a Swearer, a Whoremaster, or any thing, we humbly con∣ceive
it is all against them still; for they do not Persecute him as an
Immoral Man, if they had, why did they not do it long before?
for it must have been known then: but they Persecute him as a Dis∣senter,
a Disturber of the Neighbours with a Conventicle, Preach∣ing
in <HI>Welney Chapel</HI> without Reading the Common Prayer: these
were the Crimes. All his Vices, if they were true, (<HI>which never∣theless
we do not grant</HI>) were committed while he was <HI>Mr.</HI> Gill
<HI>the Curate,</HI> not since he was <HI>Mr.</HI> Gill <HI>the Dissenter.</HI> He was <HI>Their
Mr.</HI> Gill when they say he kept an ill Woman: he is unaccus'd of
the least Immorality since he was <HI>Our Mr.</HI> Gill. What will they
say to this part of it? This makes it a peculiar Pique at a Party, a
Push made at the Dissenters, a Sally of the Method call'd <HI>The shortest
way,</HI> sending our Ministers <HI>a Colonelling,</HI> Voting them a sort of Peo∣ple
that do not live by a lawful Calling, and can give no good
Account of themselves; and therefore, in the Eye of the Law,
are Vagabonds, and may all be Listed for Soldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We have therefore nothing more to say for Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; we need
not undertake the Vindication of his Morals, we have the Inha∣bitants
where he was Born, and Married his first Wife; we have
the Inhabitants of <HI>Maney,</HI> and of <HI>Upwell</HI>; All these Sign to his Mo∣rals,
and the People Swear that he is such a Man as they desire to
be their Minister. If his Morals are bad, the Morals of the
People should be question'd that desire a Common Drunkard and
Swearer to be their Minister. We leave the rest of the Case
therefore upon them: if he is an ill Man, they will, no doubt,
make the Discovery, and dismiss him, in Vindication of their own
Character; if not, but he continues to be their Minister, and they
desire he should be so, 'tis a better Testimony of his Character than
some Hundreds of the Vicious Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can
produce, whose Hearers and Parishioners would turn them out for
their Debaucheries, if they knew how: And of this I do not
desire to be forc'd to enter into the Particulars.</P>
