<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>IF Chaucer had not existed, the compositions of John Gower, the next poet in succession, would alone have been sufficient to rescue the reigns of Edward the third and Richard the second from the imputation of barbarism. His education was liberal and uncircumscribed, his course of reading extensive, and he tempered his severer studies with a knowledge of life. By a critical cultivation of his native language, he laboured to reform its irregularities, and to establish an English style <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. pag. 342.</NOTE>. In these respects he resembled his friend and cotemporary Chaucer <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It is certain that they both lived and wrote together. But I have considered Chaucer first, among other reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f∣ter given, as Gower survived him. Chaucer died October 25, 1400, aged 72 years. Gower died, 1402.</NOTE>: but he participated no considerable portion of Chaucer's spirit, imagination, and
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
elegance. His language is tolerably perspicuous, and his ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication often harmonious: but his poetry is of a grave and sententious turn. He has much good sense, solid re∣flection, and useful observation. But he is serious and di∣dactic on all occasions: he preserves the tone of the scholar and the moralist on the most lively topics. For this reason he seems to have been characterised by Chaucer with the appellation of the MORALL Gower <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Troil. Cress. ad calc. pag. 333. edit. Urr. ut supr.</NOTE>. But his talent is not confined to English verse only. He wrote also in Latin; and copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Ovid's elegiacs with some degree of purity, and with fewer false quantities and corrupt phrases, than any of our countrymen had yet exhibited since the twelfth century.</P>
<P>Gower's capital work, consisting of three parts, only the last of which properly furnishes matter for our present en∣quiry, is entitled SPECULUM MEDITANTIS, VOX CLAMANTIS, CONFESSIO AMANTIS. It was finished, at least the third part, in the year 1393 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">CONFESS. AMANT. Prol. fol. 1. a. col. 1. Imprinted at London, in Flete∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rete, by Thomas Berthelette, the xii. daie of March, ann. 1554. folio. This edition is here always cited.</NOTE>. The SPECULUM MEDITANTIS, or the <HI>Mirrour of Meditation,</HI> is written in French rhymes, in ten books <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bibl. Bodl. MSS. Bodl. NE. F. 8. 9. And MSS. Fairf. 3.</NOTE>. This tract, which was never printed, displays the general nature of virtue and vice, enumerates the felicities of conjugal fidelity by examples selected from various authors, and describes the path which the reprobate ought to pursue for the recovery of the divine grace. The VOX CLAMANTIS, or the <HI>Voice of one crying in the Wilderness,</HI> which was also never printed, contains seven books of Latin elegiacs. This work is chiefly historical, and is little more than a metrical chro∣nicle of the insurrection of the commons in the reign of king Richard the second. The best and most beautiful ma∣nuscript of it is in the library of All Souls college at Oxford; with a dedication in Latin verse, addressed by the author,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
when he was old and blind, to archbishop Arundel <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">MSS. Num. 26. It occurs more than once in the Bodleian library; and, I be∣lieve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often in private hands. There is a fine manuscript of it in the British Museum. It was written in the year 1397, as appears by the following line, MSS. Bodl. 294.
<Q><L>Hos ego BIS DENO Ricardi regis in anno.</L></Q></NOTE>. The CONFESSIO AMANTIS, or the <HI>Lover's Confession,</HI> is an English poem, in eight books, first printed by Caxton, in the year 1483. It was written at the command of Richard the second; who meeting our poet Gower rowing on the Thames near London, invited him into the royal barge, and after much conversation requested him to <HI>book some new thing</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">TO THE REDER, in Berthlette's edi∣tion. From the PROLOGUE. See supr. vol. i. p. 539. Notes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This tripartite work is represented by three volumes on Gower's curious tomb in the conventual church of Saint Mary Overee in Southwark, now remaining in its antient state; and this circumstance furnishes me with an obvious opportunity of adding an anecdote relating to our poet's munificence and piety, which ought not to be omitted. Al∣though a poet, he largely contributed to rebuild that church in its present elegant form, and to render it a beautiful pattern of the lighter Gothic architecture: at the same time he founded, at his tomb, a perpetual chantry.</P>
<P>It is on the last of these pieces, the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, that Gower's character and reputation as a poet are almost entirely founded. This poem, which bears no immediate reference to the other two divisions, is a dialogue between a lover and his confessor, who is a priest of Venus, and, like the mystagogue in the PICTURE of Cebes, is called Genius. Here, as if it had been impossible for a lover not to be a good catholic, the ritual of religion is applied to the tender passion, and Ovid's Art of Love is blended with the breviary. In the course of the confession, every evil affection of the human heart, which may tend to impede the progress or counteract the success of love, is scientifically subdivided; and its fatal effects exemplifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a variety of apposite stories, extracted
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
from classics and chronicles. The poet often introduces or recapitulates his matter in a few couplets of Latin long and short verses. This was in imitation of Boethius.</P>
<P>This poem is strongly tinctured with those pedantic af∣fectations concerning the passion of love, which the French and Italian poets of the fourteenth century borrowed from the troubadours of Provence, and which I have above exa∣mined at large. But the writer's particular model appears more immediately to have been John of Meun's celebrated ROMAUNT DE LA ROSE. He has, however, seldom attempted to imitate the picturesque imageries, and expressive personifi∣cations, of that exquisite allegory. His most striking pour∣traits, which yet are conceived with no powers of creation, nor delineated with any fertility of fancy, are IDLENESS, AVA∣RICE, MICHERIE or Thieving, and NEGLIGENCE, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecretary of SLOTH <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. f. 62. a. col. 1. Lib. v. f. 94. a. col. 1. Lib. iv. f. 68. a. col. 1. Lib. v. f. 119. a col. 2.</NOTE>. Instead of boldly cloathing these qualities with corporeal attributes, aptly and poetically imagined, he coldly yet sensibly describes their operations, and enumerates their properties. What Gower wanted in invention, he supplied from his common-place book; which appears to have been stored with an inexhaustible fund of instructive maxims, pleasant narrations, and philosophical definitions. It seems to have been his object to croud all his erudition into this elaborate performance. Yet there is often some degree of contrivance and art in his manner of introducing and adapting subjects of a very distant nature, and which are totally foreign to his general design.</P>
<P>In the fourth book, our confessor turns chemist; and dis∣coursing at large on the Hermetic science, developes its principles, and exposes its abuses, with great penetration <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. f. 76. b. col. 2.</NOTE>. He delivers the doctrines concerning the vegetable, mineral,
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
and animal stones, to which Falstaffe alludes in Shakespeare <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taffe mentions a philosopher's or che∣mist's <HI>two stones.</HI> See P. Henr. iv. Act iii. Sc. 2. Our author abundantly confirms doctor Warburton's explication of this passage, which the rest of the commentators do not seem to have understood. See Ashm. Theatr. Chemic. p. 484. edit. Lond. 1652. 4to.</NOTE>, with amazing accuracy and perspicuity <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 77. a. col. 1.</NOTE>; although this doctrine was adopted from systems then in vogue, as we shall see below. In another place he applies the Argo∣nautic expedition in search of the golden fleece, which he relates at length, to the same visionary philosophy <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lib. v. f. 101. a. seq.</NOTE>. Gower very probably conducted his associate Chaucer into these pro∣found mysteries, which had been just opened to our country∣men by the books of Roger Bacon <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. 1. p. 425.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the seventh book, the whole circle of the Aristotelic philosophy is explained; which our lover is desirous to learn, supposing that the importance and variety of its speculations might conduce to sooth his anxieties by diverting and en∣gaging his attention. Such a discussion was not very likely to afford him much consolation: especially, as hardly a single ornamental digression is admitted, to decorate a field na∣turally so destitute of flowers. Almost the only one is the following description of the chariot and crown of the sun; in which the Arabian ideas concerning precious stones are interwoven with Ovid's fictions and the classical mythology.</P>

<P>Our author closes this course of the Aristotelic philosophy with a system of politics <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lib. vii. f. 151. a.</NOTE>: not taken from Aristotle's ge∣nuine treatise on that subject, but from the first chapter of a spurious compilation entitled, SECRETUM SECRETORUM ARIS∣TOTELIS <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 132.

Oxon. lib. i. p. 15. col. 1.</NOTE>: and of the highest reputation in Gower's age, as it was transcribed, and illustrated with a commentary, for the use of king Edward the third, by his chaplain Walter de Millemete, prebendary of the collegiate church of Glaseney in Cornwall <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tanner Bibl. p. 527. It is cited by Bradwardine, a famous English theologist, in his grand work de CAUSA DEI. He died 1349.</NOTE>. Under this head, our au∣thor takes an opportunity of giving advice to a weak yet amiable prince, his patron king Richard the second, on a subject of the most difficult and delicate nature, with much freedom and dignity. It might also be proved, that Gower, through this detail of the sciences, copied in many other articles the SECRETUM SECRETORUM; which is a sort of an abridgement of the Aristotelic philosophy, filled with many Arabian innovations and absurdities, and enriched with an appendix concerning the choice of wines, phlebotomy, justice, public notaries, tournaments, and physiognomy, rather than from the Latin translations of Aristotle. It is evident, that he copied from this work the doctrine of the three chemical

<P>It is pretended by the mystic writers, that Aristotle in his old age reviewed his books, and digested his philosophy into one system or body, which he sent, in the form of an epistle, to Alexander. This is the supposititious tract of which I have been speaking; and it is thus described by Lydgate, who has translated a part of it.</P>

<P>Considered in a general view, the CONFESSIO AMANTI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be pronounced to be no unpleasing miscellany of those shorter tales which delighted the readers of the middle age. Most of these are now forgotten, together with the volumi∣nous chronicles in which they were recorded. The book which appears to have accommodated our author with the largest quantity of materials in this article, was probably a chronicle entitled PANTHEON, or MEMORIAE SECULORUM,
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>

There is a chronicle, I believe sometimes confounded with Godfrey's PANTHEON, called the PANTALEONE, from the creation to the year 1162, about which time it was com∣piled by the Benedictine monks of Saint Pantaleon at Cologn, printed by Eccard, with a German translation, in the first vo∣lume of SCRIPTORES MEDII AEVI, p. 683. 945. It was continued to the year 1237, by Godfridus, a Pantaleonist monk.

<P>These comprehensive systems of all sacred and profane events, which in the middle ages multiplied to an excessive degree, superseded the use of the classics and other established authors, whose materials they gave in a commodious abridge∣ment, and in whose place, by selecting those stories only which suited the taste of the times, they substituted a more agreeable kind of reading: nor was it by these means only, that they greatly contributed to retard the acquisition of those ornaments
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
of style, and other arts of composition, which an attention to the genuine models would have afforded, but by being written without any ideas of elegance, and in the most barbarous phraseology. Yet productive as they were of these and other inconvenient consequences, they were not without their use in the rude periods of literature. By gradually weaning the minds of readers from monkish legends, they introduced a relish for real and rational history; and kindling an ardour of inquiring into the transactions of past ages, at length awakened a curiosity to obtain a more accurate and authentic knowledge of important events by searching the original authors. Nor are they to be entirely neglected in modern and more polished ages. For, besides that they contain curious pictures of the credulity and ignorance of our ancestors, they frequently preserve facts transcribed from books which have not descended to posterity. It is extremely probable, that the plan on which they are all constructed, that of deducing a perpetual history from the creation to the writer's age, was partly taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and partly from the Bible.</P>
<P>In the mean time there are three histories of a less general nature, which Gower seems more immediately to have fol∣lowed in some of his tales. These are Colonna's Romance of Troy, the Romance of Sir Lancelot, and the GESTA ROMANORUM.</P>

<P>It was one of my reasons for giving these titles and colo∣phons so much at large, that the reader might more fully comprehend the nature and design of a performance which operated so powerfully on the present state of our poetry. Servius says that the Eneis was sometimes called GESTA POPULI ROMANI <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ad Aeneid. vi. 752.</NOTE>. Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote about the year 450, mentions a work called the GESTORUM VOLU∣MEN, which according to custom, was solemnly recited to

<P>In this mixture of moralisation and narrative, the GESTA ROMANORUM somewhat resembles the plan of Gower's poem.

<P>It must be confessed, that there is a much greater and a more beautiful variety of incidents in this story as it is related in the GESTA ROMANORUM, which Shakespeare has followed, than in Gower: and was it not demonstrable, that this com∣pilation preceded our author's age by some centuries, one would be tempted to conclude, that Gower's story was the original fable in its simple unimproved state. Whatever was the case, it is almost certain that one story produced the other.</P>

<P>In speaking of our author's sources, I must not omit a book translated by the unfortunate Antony Widville, first earl of Rivers, chiefly with a view of proving its early po∣pularity.

The English translation was printed by Caxton, in the year 1477.

<P>It is pleasant to observe the strange mistakes which Gower, a man of great learning, and the most general scholar of his age, has committed in this poem, concerning books which he never saw, his violent anachronisms, and misrepresentations of the most common facts and characters. He mentions the Greek poet Menander, as one of the first historians, or <Q REND="inline">"first enditours of the olde cronike,"</Q> together with Esdras, Solinus, Josephus, Claudius Salpicius, Termegis, Pandulfe, Frigidilles, Ephiloquorus, and Pandas. It is extraordinary that Moses should not here be mentioned, in preference to Esdras. Solinus is ranked so high, because he recorded nothing but wonders <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Our author has a story from Solinus concerning a monstrous bird, lib. iii. f. 62. b. col. 2.

On this account too, perhaps Esdras is here so respectably re∣membered. I suppose Sulpicius is Sulpicius Severus, a petty annalist of the fifth century. Termegis is probably Trisme∣gistus, the mystic philosopher, certainly not an historian, at least not an antient one. Pandulf seems to be Pandulph of Pisa, who wrote lives of the popes, and died in the year 1198 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the story, in our author, of pope Boni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace suppl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nting Celestine. <Q REND="inline">"In a CRONYKE of tyme ago."</Q> Lib. ii. f. 42. a. col. 2.</NOTE>.

There is also Fridegodus, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onk of Dover, who wrote the lives of some sainted bishops about the year 960.

If this last be the writer in the text, a ma∣nuscript of Frigeridus's History might have existed in Gower's age, which is now lost.</NOTE>. Our author, who has partly suffered from ignorant transcribers and printers, by Ephiloquorus undoubtedly intended Eutro∣pius. In the next paragraph indeed, he mentions Herodotus:

But I believe Gower's apology must be, that he took this narrative from some christian legend, which was feigned, for a religious purpose, at the expence of all proba∣bility and propriety.</P>
<P>The only classic Roman writers which our author cites are Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Tully. Among the Italian poets, one is surprised he should not quote Petrarch: he mentions Dante only, who in the rubric is called <Q REND="inline">"a certain poet of Italy named Dante,"</Q> <HI>quidam po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta Italiae qui</HI> DANTE <HI>vocabatur</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lib. vii. f. 154. b. col. 1.</NOTE>.

Among the astrological writers, he mentions Noah, Abraham, and Moses.

<P>Gower, amidst his graver literature, appears to have been a great reader of romances.

<P>The CONFESSIO AMANTIS was most probably written after Chaucer's TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.

Virgil, also, Socrates, Plato, and Ovid, are enumerated as lovers. Nor must we be surprised to find Aristotle honoured with a place in this gallant groupe: for whom, says the poet, the queen of Greece made such a syllogism as destroyed all his logic. But, among the rest, Troilus and Cressida are introduced; seem∣ingly with an intention of paying a compliment to Chaucer's poem on their story, which had been submitted to Gower's correction <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chaucer's Tr.

<P>My readers will easily conjecture the change which this spectacle must naturally produce in the obdurate heart of the princess of Armenia.

<P>I believe on the whole, that Chaucer had published most of his poems before this piece of Gower appeared. Chaucer had not however at this time written his TESTAMENT OF LOVE: for Gower, in a sort of Epilogue to the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, is addressed by Venus, who commands him to greet Chaucer as her favourite poet and disciple, as one who had employed his youth in composing songs and ditties to her honour. She adds at the close,</P>

</Q>
<P>Chaucer at this time was sixty-five years of age. The Court of Love, one of the pedantries of French gallantry, occurs often. In an address to Venus, <Q REND="inline">"Madame, I am a man of thyne, that in thy COURTE hath served long <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. f. 8. b. col. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> The lover observes, that for want of patience, a man ought <Q REND="inline">"amonge the women alle, in LOVES COURTE, by <HI>judgement</HI> the name beare of paciant <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. f. 51. a. col. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> The confessor declares, that many persons are condemned for disclosing secrets, <Q REND="inline">"In LOVES COURTE, as it is said, that lette their tonges gone untide <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. f. 52. a. col. 1.

<P>There are also many manifest evidences which lead us to conclude, that this poem preceded Chaucer's CANTERBURY'S TALES, undoubtedly some of that poet's latest compositions, and probably not begun till after the year 1382. The MAN OF LAWES TALE is circumstantially borrowed from Gower's CONSTANTIA <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Conf. Amant. Lib. ii f. 30. b. col. 2. See particularly, ibid. f. 35. b. col. 2. a. col. 1. And compare Ch. MAN OF L. T. v. 5505. <Q REND="inline">"Some men wold sayn, &amp;c."</Q> That is, GOWER.</NOTE>: and Chaucer, in that TALE, apparently censures Gower, for his manner of relating the stories of Canace and Apollonius in the third and eighth books of the CONFESSIO AMANTIS <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Chaucer, ibid. v. 4500. And Conf. Amant. Lib. iii. f. 48. a. col. 1. seq. Lib. viii. f. 175. a. col. 2. seq. I have just discovered, that the favourite story of Apollonius, having appeared in antient Greek, Latin, Saxon, barbarous Greek, and old French, was at length translated from French into English, and printed in the black letter, by Wynkyn de Worde, A. D. 1510. 4to. <Q REND="inline">"Kynge Appolyn of Thyre."</Q> [See supr. vol i. p. 350.] A copy is in my possession.</NOTE>. The WIFE OF BATHES TALE is founded

on Gower's Florent, a knight of Rome, who delivers the king of Sicily's daughter from the incantations of her step∣mother <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. f. 15. b. col. 2.</NOTE>. Although the GESTA ROMANORUM might have furnished both poets with this narrative. Chaucer, however, among other great improvements, has judiciously departed from the fable, in converting Sicily into the more popular court of king Arthur.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in estimating Gower's merit, I have pushed the notion too far, that because he shews so much learning he had no great share of natural abilities. But it should be considered, that when books began to grow fashionable, and the reputation of learning conferred the highest honour, poets became ambitious of being thought scholars; and sa∣crificed their native powers of invention to the ostentation of displaying an extensive course of reading, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the pride of profound erudition. On this account, the minstrels of these times, who were totally uneducated, and poured forth spontaneous rhymes in obedience to the workings of nature, often exhibit more genuine strokes of passion and imagina∣tion, than the professed poets. Chaucer is an exception to this observation: whose original feelings were too strong to be suppressed by books, and whose learning was overbalanced by genius.</P>
<P>This affectation of appearing learned, which yet was natural at the revival of literature, in our old poets, even in those who were altogether destitute of talents, has lost to posterity many a curious picture of manners, and many a romantic image. Some of our antient bards, however, aimed at no other merit, than that of being able to versify; and attempted nothing more, than to cloath in rhyme those sentiments, which would have appeared with equal propriety in prose.</P>

<P>ONE of the reasons which rendered the classic authors of the lower empire more popular than those of a purer age, was because they were christians. Among these, no Roman writer appears to have been more studied and esteemed, from the beginning to the close of the barbarous centuries, than Boethius. Yet it is certain, that his alle∣gorical personifications and his visionary philosophy, founded on the abstractions of the Platonic school, greatly concurred to make him a favourite <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is observable, that this SPIRIT OF PERSONIFICATION tinctures the writings of some of the christian fathers, about, or rather before, this period. Most of the agents in the SHEPHERD of HERMAS are <HI>ideal</HI> beings. An ancient lady converses with Hermas, and tells him that she is the CHURCH OF GOD. Afterwards several virgins appear and discourse with him; and when he desires to be informed who they are, he is told by the SHEPHERD-ANGEL, that they are FAITH, ABSTINENCE, PATIENCE, CHASTITY, CONCORD, &amp;c.

<P>The coronation of king Henry the fifth, was celebrated in Westminster-hall with a solemnity proportioned to the lustre of those great atchievements which afterwards distinguished the annals of that victorious monarch. By way of preserving order, and to add to the splendor of the spectacle, many of the nobility were ranged along the sides of the tables on large war-horses, at this stately festival; which, says my chronicle, was a second feast of Ahasuerus <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Thomae de Elmham Vit. et Gest. Henr. V. edit. Hearne, Oxon. 1727. cap. xii. p. 23. Compare Lel. Coll. APPEND. iii. 226. edit. 1770.</NOTE>. But I mention this ceremony, to introduce a circumstance very pertinent to our purpose; which is, that the number of harpers in the hall was innumerable <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Elmham, ubi supr. p. 23.</NOTE>, who undoubtedly accompanied their instruments with heroic rhymes. The king, however, was no great encourager of the popular minstrelsy, which seems at this time to have flourished in the highest degree of per∣fection. When he entered the city of London in triumph after the battle of Agincourt, the gates and streets were hung with tapestry, representing the histories of ancient heroes; and children were placed in artificial turrets, singing verses <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Elmham, ubi supr. cap. xxxi. p. 72.</NOTE>. But Henry, disgusted at these secular vanities, com∣manded by a formal edict, that for the future no songs

should be recited by the harpers, or others, in praise of the recent victory <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"CANTUS de suo triumpho fieri, seu per CITHARI ST AS, vel alios quoscunque, CANTARI, penitus prohibebat."</Q> Ibid. p. 72.

This prohibition had no other effect than that of displaying Henry's humility, perhaps its principal and real design. Among many others, a minstrel-piece soon appeared, evidently adapted to the harp, on the SEYGE of HARFLETT and the BATTALLYE of AGYNKOURTE. It was written about the year 1417. These are some of the most spirited lines.</P>

<P>This is a sort of paraphrase of the first part of Aristotle's epistle to Alexander abovementioned, entitled SECRETUM SE∣CRETORUM, of Egidius, and of Jacobus de Casulis, whom he calls <HI>Jacob de Cassolis.</HI> Egidius, a native of Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, a pupil of Thomas Aquinas, eminent among the schoolmen by the name of <HI>Doctor Fundatissimus,</HI> and an archbishop, flourished about the year 1280. He wrote a Latin tract in three books DE REGIMINE PRINCIPUM, or the ART OF GOVERNMENT, for the use of Philip le Hardi, son of Louis king of France, a work highly esteemed in the middle ages, and translated early into Hebrew, French <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wolf.

In those days eccle∣siastics and schoolmen presumed to dictate to kings, and to give rules for administering states, drawn from the narrow circle of speculation, and conceived amid the pedantries of a cloister. It was probably recommended to Occleve's notice, by having been translated into English by John Trevisa, a celebrated translator about the year 1390 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bibl. Bodl. MSS.

<P>Occleve seems to have written some of these verses imme∣diately on Chaucer's death, and to have introduced them long afterwards into this Prologue.</P>
<P>It is in one of the royal manuscripts of this poem in the British Museum that Occleve has left a drawing of Chaucer <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">MSS. Reg. 17 D. vi. 1.</NOTE>:
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
according to which, Chaucer's portraiture was made on his monument, in the chapel of Saint Blase in Westminster∣abbey, by the benefaction of Nicholas Brigham, in the year 1556 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">He was of Caversham in Oxfordshire. Educated at Hart-Hall in Oxford, and studied the law. He died at Westminster, 1559.</NOTE>. And from this drawing, in 1598, John Speed pro∣cured the print of Chaucer prefixed to Speght's edition of his works; which has been since copied in a most finished engraving by Vertue <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In Urry's edit. 1721. fol.</NOTE>. Yet it must be remembered, that the same drawing occurs in an Harleian manuscript written about Occleve's age <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 4866. The drawing is at fol. 91.</NOTE>, and in another of the Cottonian department <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">MSS. Cotton. OTH. A. 18.</NOTE>. Occleve himself mentions this drawing in his CONSOLATIO SERVILIS. It exactly resembles the curious picture on board of our venerable bard, preserved in the Bodleian gallery at Oxford. I have a very old picture of Chaucer on board, much like Occleve's, formerly kept in Chaucer's house, a quadrangular stone-mansion, at Woodstock in Oxfordshire; which commanded a prospect of the ancient magnificent royal palace, and of many beautiful scenes in the adjacent park: and whose last remains, chiefly consisting of what was called Chaucer's bed-chamber, with an old carved oaken roof, evidently original, were demolished about fifteen years ago. Among the ruins, they found an ancient gold coin of the city of Florence <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">I think a FLOREIN, antiently common in England. Chaucer, PARDON.

Before the grand rebellion, there was in the windows of the church of Woodstock, an escucheon in painted glass of the arms of sir Payne Rouet, a knight of Henault, whose daughter Chaucer married.</P>
<P>Occleve, in this poem, and in others, often celebrates Humphrey duke of Glocester <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">As he does John of Gaunt.</NOTE>; who at the dawn of science
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
was a singular promoter of literature, and, however unqua∣lified for political intrigues, the common patron of the scholars of the times. A sketch of his character in that view, is therefore too closely connected with our subject to be censured as an unnecessary digression. About the year 1440, he gave to the university of Oxford a library containing six hundred volumes, only one hundred and twenty of which were valued at more than one thousand pounds. These books are called <HI>Novi Tractatus,</HI> or New Treatises, in the university∣register <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Reg. F. fol. 52. 53. b. Epist. 142.</NOTE>, and said to be <HI>admirandi apparatus</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 57. b. 60. a. Epist. 148.</NOTE>. They were the most splendid and costly copies that could be procured, finely written on vellum, and elegantly embellished with miniatures and illuminations. Among the rest was a trans∣lation into French of Ovid's Metamorphoses <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Leland. coll. iii. p. 58. edit. 1770.</NOTE>. Only a single specimen of these valuable volumes was suffered to remain: it is a beautiful manuscript in folio of Valerius Maximus, enriched with the most elegant decorations, and written in Duke Humphrey's age, evidently with a design of being placed in this sumptuous collection. All the rest of the books, which, like this, being highly ornamented, look∣ed like missals, and conveyed ideas of popish superstition, were destroyed or removed by the pious visitors of the uni∣versity in the reign of Edward the sixth, whose zeal was equalled only by their ignorance, or perhaps by their avarice.

<P>I close this section with an apology for Chaucer, Gower, and Occleve; who are supposed, by the severe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> etymologists, to have corrupted the purity of the English language, by affecting to introduce so many foreign words and phrases. But if we attend only to the politics of the times, we shall find these poets, as also some of their successors, much less blameable in this respect, than the critics imagine. Our wars with France, which began in the reign of Edward the third, were of long continuance. The principal nobility of England, at this period, resided in France, with their fami∣lies, for many years. John king of France kept his court in England; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which, exclusive of these French lords who were his fellow-prisoners, or necessary attendants, the chief nobles of his kingdom must have occasionally resorted. Ed∣ward the black prince made an expedition into Spain. John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster, and his brother the duke of York, were matched with the daughters of Don Pedro king of Castile. All these circumstances must have concurred to produce a perceptible change in the language of the court. It is rational therefore, and it is equitable to suppose, that instead of coining new words, they only complied with the common and fashionable modes of speech. Would Chaucer's poems have been the delight of those courts in which he lived, had they been filled with unintelligible pedantries? The cotemporaries of these poets never complained of their obscurity. But whether defensible on these principles or not, they much improved the vernacular style by the use of this exotic phraseology. It was thus that our primitive diction was enlarged and enriched. The English language owes its copiousness, elegance, and harmony, to these innovations.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>I Consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring. A brilliant sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre: the sudden appearance of cloudless skies, and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmosphere, after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter, fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer: and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity. But winter returns with redoubled horrors: the clouds condense more formidably than before; and those tender buds, and early blossoms, which were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sun-shine, are nipped by frosts, and torn by tempests.</P>
<P>Most of the poets that immediately succeeded Chaucer, seem rather relapsing into barbarism, than availing them∣selves of those striking ornaments which his judgment and imagination had disclosed. They appear to have been in∣sensible to his vigour of versification, and his flights of fancy. It was not indeed likely that a poet should soon arise equal to Chaucer: and it must be remembered, that the na∣tional distractions which ensued, had no small share in ob∣structing the exercise of those studies which delight in peace and repose. His successors, however, approach him in no degree of proportion. Among these, John Lydgate is the poet who follows him at the shortest interval.</P>
<P>I have placed Lydgate in the reign of Henry the sixth, and he seems to have arrived at his highest point of emi∣nence about the year 1430 <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">In a copy of Lydgate's <HI>Chronicle of En∣glish Kings,</HI> there is a stanza of Edward the fourth. MSS. Harl. 2251. 3. In his poem <HI>Ab inimicis nostris,</HI> &amp;c. Edward the fourth, his <HI>Quene</HI> and <HI>Modir</HI> are remembered. MSS. Harl. ibid. 9. fol. 10. But these pieces could not well be written by Lydgate. For he was ordained a subdeacon, 1389. Deacon, 1393. And priest, 1397. Registr. Gul. Cratfield, abbatis de Bury, MSS. Cott. TIBER. B. ix. fol. 1. 35. 52. Edward came to the crown, 1461. Pitts says, that our author died, 1482. Lydgate, in his PHILOMELA, mentions the death of Henry lord Warwick, who died in 1446. MSS. Harl. ibid. 120. fol. 255.</NOTE>. Many of his poems, however,
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
appeared before. He was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Bury in Suffolk, and an uncommon ornament of his pro∣fession. Yet his genius was so lively, and his accomplish∣ments so numerous, that I suspect the holy father saint Benedict would hardly have acknowledged him for a genuine disciple. After a short education at Oxford, he travelled into France and Italy <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See one of his DITTIES, MSS. Harl. 2255. 41. fol. 148.
<Q><L>I have been offte in dyvers londys, &amp;c.</L></Q></NOTE>; and returned a complete master of the language and the literature of both countries. He chiefly studied the Italian and French poets, particularly Dante, Boccacio, and Alain Chartier; and became so distin∣guished a proficient in polite learning, that he opened a school in his monastery, for teaching the sons of the nobility the arts of versification, and the elegancies of composition. Yet although philology was his object, he was not unfamiliar with the fashionable philosophy: he was not only a poet and a rhetorician, but a geometrician, an astronomer, a the∣ologist, and a disputant. On the whole I am of opinion, that Lydgate made considerable additions to those amplifica∣tions of our language, in which Chaucer, Gower, and Oc∣cleve led the way: and that he is the first of our writers whose style is cloathed with that perspicuity, in which the English phraseology appears at this day to an English reader.</P>
<P>To enumerate Lydgate's pieces, would be to write the catalogue of a little library. No poet seems to have possessed a greater versatility of talents. He moves with equal ease in every mode of composition. His hymns, and his ballads, have the same degree of merit: and whether his subject be the life of a hermit or a hero, of saint Austin or Guy earl of Warwick, ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic, a
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
history or an allegory, he writes with facility. His transi∣tions were rapid from works of the most serious and la∣borious kind to sallies of levity and pieces of popular enter∣tainment. His muse was of universal access; and he was not only the poet of his monastery, but of the world in general. If a disguising was intended by the company of goldsmiths, a mask before his majesty at Eltham, a may∣game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London, a mumming before the lord mayor, a procession of pageants from the creation for the festival of Corpus Christi, or a carol for the coronation, Lydgate was consulted and gave the poetry <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See a variety of his pieces of this kind, MSS.

<P>About the year 1430, Whethamstede the learned and liberal abbot of saint Albans, being desirous of familiarising the history of his patron saint to the monks of his convent, em∣ployed Lydgate, as it should seem, then a monk of Bury, to translate the Latin legend of his life in English rhymes. The chronicler who records a part of this anecdote seems to consider Lydgate's translation, as a matter of mere manual mechanism; for he adds, that Whethamstede paid for the translation, the writing, and illuminations, one hundred shillings. It was placed before the altar of the saint, which Whethamstede afterwards adorned with much mag∣nificence, in the abbey church <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">GEST. Joh.

This Latin translation was published by Goldastus, at the end of the SPECULUM OMNIUM STATUUM TOTIUS ORBIS TERRARUM compiled by Rodericus Zamorensis, and printed at Hanau in the year 1613 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In 4to.</NOTE><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But a French translation was made much earlier than the Latin, and written about the walls of saint Innocents cloister at Paris; from which Lyd∣gate formed his English version <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See the DAUNCE OF MACABRE, MSS.

The DANCE OF DEATH, falsly supposed to have been invented by Holbein, is different from this, though founded in the same idea. It was painted by Holbein in the Augustine monastery at Basil, 1543.

And, in public buildings, at Minden, in Westphalia, so early as 1383. At Lubec, in the portico of saint Mary's church, 1463. At Dresden, in the castle or palace, 1534. At Annaberg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1525. At Leipsic, &amp;c. Paul Christian Hilscher has written a very learned and entertaining German book on this subject, printed at Dresden, 1705. 8vo. Engravings of Holbein's pictures at Basil were published, curante Matthaeo Meriano, at Francfort 1649, and 1725, 4to. The German verses there ascribed, appeared in Latin elegiacs, in Caspar Laudisman's DECENNALIA HUMANAE PE∣REGRINATIONIS, A. D. 1584.

Lydgate, in another piece, has versified the rubrics of the missal, which he ap∣plies to the god Cupid: and declares, with how much de∣light he frequently meditated on the holy legend of those constant martyrs, who were not afraid to suffer death for the faith of that omnipotent divinity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MSS. Fairfax, xvi. Bibl. Bodl.</NOTE>. There are instances, in which religion was even made the instrument of love. Arnaud Daniel, a celebrated troubadour of the thirteenth century, in a fit of amorous despair, promises to found a multitude of annual masses, and to dedicate perpetual tapers to the shrines of saints, for the important purpose of obtaining the affections of an obdurate mistress.</P>

<P>BUT Lydgate's principal poems are the FALL OF PRINCES, the SIEGE OF THEBES, and the DESTRUCTION OF TROY. Of all these I shall speak distinctly.</P>
<P>About the year 1360, Boccacio wrote a Latin history in ten books, entitled DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ET FEMINARUM ILLUSTRIUM. Like other chronicles of the times, it com∣mences with Adam, and is brought down to the author'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> age. Its last grand event is John king of France taken pri∣soner by the English at the battle of Poitiers, in the year 1359 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Printed at Ausbourg. And at Paris, 1544. fol. It is amazing, that Vossius should not know the number of books of which this work consisted, and that it was ever printed. De Hist. Lat. lib. iii. cap. ii.

<P>The work is not improperly styled a set of tragedies. It is not merely a narrative of men eminent for their rank and misfortunes. The plan is perfectly dramatic, and partly suggested by the pageants of the times. Every personage is supposed to appear before the poet, and to relate his re∣spective sufferings: and the figures of these spectres are sometimes finely drawn. Hence a source is opened for moving compassion, and for a display of imagination. In some of the lives the author replies to the speaker, and a sort of dialogue is introduced for conducting the story. Brunchild, a queen of France, who murthered all her chil∣dren, and was afterwards hewn in pieces, appears thus.</P>

<P>Nor does our dramatist deal only in real characters and historical personages. Boccacio standing pensive in his library, is alarmed at the sudden entrance of the gigantic and monstrous

image of FORTUNE, whose agency has so powerful and universal an influence in human affairs, and especially in effecting those vicissitudes which are the subject of this work. There is a Gothic greatness in her figure, with some touches of the grotesque. An attribute of the early poetry of all nations, before ideas of selection have taken place. I must add, that it was Boethius's admired allegory on the CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY, which introduced personi∣fication into the poetry of the middle ages.</P>

<P>Lydgate appears to have been far advanced in years when he finished this poem: for at the beginning of the eighth book he complains of his trembling joints, and declares that age, having benumbed his faculties, has deprived him <Q REND="inline">"of all the subtylte of curious makyng in Englysshe to endyte <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">B. vii.

<P>I cannot quit this work without adding an observation re∣lating to Boccacio, its original author, which perhaps may deserve attention. It is highly probable that Boccacio learn∣ed many anecdotes of Grecian history and Grecian fable, not to be found in any Greek writer now extant, from his pre∣ceptors Barlaam, Leontius, and others, who had lived at Constantinople while the Greek literature was yet flourish∣ing. Some of these are perhaps scattered up and down in the composition before us, which contains a considerable part of the Grecian story; and especially in his treatise of the genealogies of the gods <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In fifteen books. First printed in 1481. fol. And in Italian by Betussi, Venet. 1553. In French at Paris, 1531. fol. In the interpretation of the fables he is very prolix and jejune.</NOTE>. Boccacio himself calls his master Leontius an inexhaustible archive of Grecian tales and fables, although not equally conversant with those of
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
the Latins <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">GENEAL. DEOR. lib. xv. cap. vi.</NOTE>. He confesses that he took many things in his book of the genealogies of the gods from a vast work entitled COLLECTIVUM, now lost, written by his cotemporary Paulus Peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inus, the materials of which had in great measure been furnished by Barlaam <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Quicquid apud Graecos inveniri potest, ADJUTORIO BARLAAE arbitror collegisse."</Q> GENEAL. DEOR. lib. xv. cap. vi.</NOTE>. We are informed also, that Perusi∣nus made use of some of these fugitive Greek scholars, es∣pecially Barlaam, for collecting rare books in that language. Perusinus was librarian, about the year 1340, to Robert king of Jerusalem and Sicily: and was the most curious and inquisitive man of his age for searching after unknown or uncommon manuscripts, especially histories, and poetical compositions, and particularly such as were written in Greek. I will beg leave to cite the words of Boccacio, who records this anecdote. <Q REND="inline">"Et, si usquam CURIOSISSIMUS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit homo in perquirendis, jussu etiam principis, PEREGRINIS undecunque libris, HISTORIIS et POETICIS operibus, iste fuit.

DEOR. lib. xv. cap. vi.</NOTE>."</Q> By these HISTORIAE and POETICA OPERA, brought from Constantinople by Barlaam, undoubtedly works of entertainment, and perhaps chiefly of the romantic and fictitious species, I do not understand the classics. It is natural to suppose that Boccacio, both from his connections and his curiosity, was no stranger to these treasures: and that many of these pieces, thus imported into Italy by the dispersion of the Constantinopolitan exiles, are only known at present through the medium of his writings. It is cer∣tain that many oriental fictions found their way into Europe by means of this communication.</P>
<P>Lydgate's STORIE OF THEBES was first printed by William Thinne, at the end of his edition of Chaucer's works, in

After a severe sickness, having a design to visit the shrine of Thomas a Beckett at Canterbury, he arrives in that city while Chaucer's pilgrims were assembled there for the same purpose; and by mere accident, not suspecting to find so numerous and respectable a company, goes to their inn.

<P>THE third of Lydgate's poems which I proposed to consider, is the TROY BOKE, or the DESTRUCTION OF TROY. It was first printed at the command of king Henry the eighth, in the year 1513, by Richard Pinson, with this title, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>THE HYSTORY SEGE AND DESTRUCCION OF TROYE.</HI> The table or rubrisshe of the content of the chapitres, &amp;c.

In the Bodleian library there is a manu∣script of this poem elegantly illuminated, with the picture of a monk presenting a book to a king <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">MSS. Digb. 232.</NOTE>.

whom he professes to follow. Yet it is not, in the mean time, impossible, that Lydgate might have seen the Iliad, at least in a Latin translation. Leontius Pilatus, already mentioned, one of the learned Constantinopolitan exiles, had translated the Iliad into Latin prose, with part of the Odyss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, at the desire of Boccacio <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is a slight error in Vigneul Marville, that this translation was procured by Pe∣trarch.

He wishes also to see, how Homer, blind and an Asiatic, had described the lake of Averno and the mountain of Circe. In another part of these letters, he acknowledges the receipt of the Latin Homer; and mentions with how much satisfac∣tion and joy the report of its arrival in the public library at Venice was received, by all the Greek and Latin scholars of that city <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hody, ubi supr. p. 5. 6. 7. 9.

Yet I cannot believe that Lydgate had ever consulted these translations, although he had travelled in France and Italy. One may venture to pronounce peremptorily, that he did not understand, as he probably never had seen, the original. After the migration of the Roman emperors to Greece, Boc∣cacio was the first European that could read Homer; nor was there perhaps a copy of either of Homer's poems exist∣ing in Europe, till about the time the Greeks were driven

was more chimerical and unmeaning than this of our Grecian chiefs: and the cause of their expedition to Troy was quite in the spirit of chivalry, as it was occasioned by a lady.

Nor are we only presented in this piece with the habits of feudal life, and the practices of chivalry. The poem is en∣riched with a multitude of oriental fictions, and Arabian traditions. Medea gives to Jason, when he is going to com∣bat the brazen bulls, and to lull the dragon who guarded the golden fleece asleep, a marvellous ring; in which was a gem whose virtue could destroy the efficacy of poison, and render the wearer invisible. It was the same sort of pre∣cious stone, adds our author, which Virgil celebrates, and which Venus sent her son Eneas that he might enter Car∣thage unseen. Another of Medea's presents to Jason, to assist him in this perilous atchievement, is a silver image, or talisman, which defeated all the powers of incantation, and was framed according to principles of astronomy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The hall of king Priam is illuminated at night by a prodigious carbuncle, placed among saphires, rubies, and pearls, on the crown of a golden statue of Jupiter, fifteen cubits high <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. ii. c. xi.</NOTE>.

Most of these extravagancies, and a thousand more, are in Guido de Colonna, who lived when this mode of fabling was at its height. But in the fourth book, Dares <SUP>e</SUP> Phrigius is particularly cited for a description of Priam's palace, which seemed to be founded by FAYRIE, or enchantment; and was paved with crystal, built of dia∣monds, saphires, and emeralds, and supported by ivory pillars, surmounted with golden images <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cap. xxvi.</NOTE>.

<P>Colonna, I believe, gave the Trojan story its romantic additions. It had long before been falsified by Dictys and Dares; but those writers, misrepresenting or enlarging Homer, only invented plain and credible facts. They were the basis of Colonna: who first filled the faint outlines of their fabulous history with the colourings of eastern fancy, and adorned their scanty forgeries with the gorgeous trappings of Gothic chivalry. Or, as our author expresses himself in his Prologue, speaking of Colonna's improvements on his originals.</P>

<P>The account of the Trojan theatre must not be omitted, as it displays the imperfect ideas of the stage, at least of dramatic exhibition, which now prevailed; or rather, the absolute inexistence of this sort of spectacle. Our author supposes, that comedies and tragedies were first represented at Troy <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">All that follows on this subject, is not in Colonna.</NOTE>. He defines a comedy to begin with complaint and to end with <HI>gladnesse:</HI> expressing the actions of those only who live in the lowest condition. But tragedy, he informs us, begins in prosperity, and ends in adversity: shewing the wonderful vicissitudes of fortune which have happened in the lives of kings and mighty conquerours. In the theatre of Troy, he adds, was a pulpit, in which stood a poet, who rehearsed the <HI>noble dedes that were historial of kynges, prynces, and worthy emperours;</HI> and, above all, related those fatal and sudden catastrophes, which they sometimes suffered by murther, poison, conspiracy, or other secret and unfore∣seen machinations.</P>

<P>It is added, that these plays, or <HI>rytes of tragedyes old,</HI> were acted at Troy, and <HI>in the theatre halowed and yholde,</HI> when the months of April and May returned.</P>
<P>In this detail of the dramatic exhibition which prevailed in the ideal theatre of Troy, a poet, placed on the stage in a pulpit, and characteristically habited, is said to have recited a series of tragical adventures; whose pathetic narrative was afterwards expressed, by the dumb gesticulations of a set of masqued actors. Some perhaps may be inclined to think, that this imperfect species of theatric representation, was the rude drama of Lydgate's age. But surely Lydgate would not have described at all, much less in a long and laboured digression, a public shew, which from its nature was familiar and notorious. On the contrary, he describes it as a thing obsolete, and existing only in remote times. Had a more perfect and legitimate stage now subsisted, he would not have deviated from his subject, to communicate unnecessary in∣formation, and to deliver such minute definitions of tragedy and comedy. On the whole, this formal history of a theatre, conveys nothing more than an affected display of Lydgate's learning; and is collected, yet with apparent inaccuracy and confusion of circumstances, from what the antient gram∣marians have left concerning the origin of the Greek tragedy.
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
Or perhaps it might be borrowed by our author from some French paraphrastic version of Colonna's Latin romance.</P>
<P>Among the antient authors, beside those already mentioned, cited in this poem, are Lollius for the history of Troy, Ovid for the tale of Medea and Jason, Ulysses and Polyphemus, the Myrmidons and other stories, Statius for Polynices and Eteocles, the venerable Bede, Fulgentius the mythologist, Justinian with whose institutes Colonna as a civilian must have been well acquainted, Pliny, and Jacobus de Vitriaco. The last is produced to prove, that Philometer, a famous philo∣sopher, invented the game of chess, to divert a tyrant from his cruel purposes, in Chaldea; and that from thence it was im∣ported into Greece. But Colonna, or rather Lydgate, is of a different opinion; and contends, in opposition to his authority, that this game, <HI>so sotyll and so marvaylous,</HI> was discovered by <HI>pru∣dent clerkes</HI> during the siege of Troy, and first practiced in that city.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>y</SUP> Colonna calls him, <HI>ille</HI> FABULARIUS <HI>Sulmonensis,—fabulose commentans,</HI> &amp;c. Signat. b 2.</NOTE> Jacobus de Vitriaco was a canon regular at Paris, and, among other dignities in the church, bishop of Ptole∣mais in Palestine, about the year 1230. This tradition of the invention of chess is mentioned by Jacobus de Vitriaco in his ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL HISTORY <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In three books.</NOTE>. The anec∣dote of Philometer is, I think, in Egidius Romanus on this subject, above-mentioned. Chaucer calls Athalus, that is Attalus Philometer, the same person, and who is often men∣tioned in Pliny, the invento<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of chess <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DREME, p. 408. col. 2. edit.

<P>I must not pass over an instance of Lydgate's gallantry, as it is the gallantry of a monk. Colonna takes all oppor∣tunities of satirising the fair sex; and Lydgate with great politeness declares himself absolutely unwilling to translate those passages of this severe moralist, which contain such unjust and illiberal misrepresentations of the female cha∣racter. Instead of which, to obviate these injurious reflec∣tions, our translator enters upon a formal vindication of
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
the ladies; not by a panegyric on their beauty, nor encomiums on those amiable accomplishments, by which they refine our sensibilities, and give elegance to life; but by a display of that religious fortitude with which some women have suf∣fered martyrdom; or of that inflexible chastity, by means of which others have been snatched up alive into heaven, in a state of genuine virginity. Among other striking examples which the calendar affords, he mentions the transcendent grace of the eleven thousand virgins who were martyred at Cologne in Germany. In the mean time, female saints, as I suspect, in the barbarous ages were regarded with a greater degree of respect, on account of those exaggerated ideas of gallantry which chivalry inspired: and it is not improbable that the distinguished honours paid to the virgin Mary might have partly proceeded from this principle.</P>
<P>Among the anachronistic improprieties which this poem contains, some of which have been pointed out, the most conspicuous is the fiction of Hector's sepulchre, or tomb: which also merits our attention for another reason, as it affords us an opportunity of adding some other notices of the modes of antient architecture to those already men∣tioned. The poet from Colonna supposes, that Hector was buried in the principal church of Troy, near the high altar, within a magnificent oratory, erected for that purpose, exactly resembling the Gothic shrines of our cathedrals, yet charged with many romantic decorations.</P>

The structure is supported by angels of gold. The steps are of crystall.

This is from the chemistry of the times. Before the body were four inextinguishible lamps in golden sockets.

I believe it to be about Lydgate's age; but there is no other authority for supposing it to be written by Lydgate, than that, in the beginning of the Bodleian manuscript now before us, a hand-writing, of about the reign of James the first, assigns it to that poet.

<P>Dioclesian, a powerful emperour in Germany, has a rupture with Barnard earl of Tholouse, concerning boun∣daries of territory. Contrary to the repeated persuasions of the empress, who is extremely beautiful, and famous for her conjugal fidelity, he meets the earl, with a numerous army, in a pitched battle, to decide the quarrel. The earl is victorious, and carries home a great multitude of pri∣soners, the most respectable of which is sir Tralabas of Turky, whom he treats as his companion. In the midst of their festivities they talk of the beauties of the empress; the earl's curiosity is inflamed to see so matchless a lady, and he promises liberty to sir Tralabas, if he can be conducted un∣known to the emperour's court, and obtain a sight of her without discovery. They both set forward, the earl dis∣guised like a hermit. When they arrive at the emperour's court, sir Tralabas proves false: treacherously imparts the secret to the empress that he has brought with him the earl
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
of Tholouse in disguise, who is enamoured of her celebrated beauty; and proposes to take advantage of so fair an oppor∣tunity of killing the emperour's great and avowed enemy. She rejects the proposal with indignation, injoyns the knight not to communicate the secret any farther, and desires to see the earl next day in the chapel at mass. The next day the earl in his hermit's weeds is conveniently placed at mass. At leav∣ing the chapel, he asks an alms of the empress; and she gives him forty florins and a ring. He receives the present of the ring with the highest satisfaction, and although obliged to return home, in point of prudence, and to avoid detection, comforts himself with this reflection.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Well is me, I have thy grace,</L>
<L>Of the to have thys thyng!</L>
<L>If ever I have grace of the,</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> any love betweene us be,</L>
<L>This may be a TOKENYNG.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He then returns home. The emperour is called into some distant country; and leaves his consort in the custody of two knights, who attempting to gain her love without suc∣cess, contrive a stratagem to defame her chastity. She is thrown into prison, and the emperour returns unexpectedly <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The emperour's disappointment is thus described.
<Q><LG>

The tale of the two treacherous knights is believed, and she is sentenced to the flames: yet under the restriction, that if a champion can be found who shall foil the two knights in battle, her honour shall be cleared, and her life saved. A challenge is published in all
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
parts of the world; and the earl of Tholouse, notwithstand∣ing the animosities which still subsist between him and the emperour, privately undertakes her quarrel. He appears at the emperour's court in the habit of a monk, and obtains permission to act as confessor to the empress, in her present critical situation. In the course of the confession, she pro∣tests that she was always true to the emperour; yet owns that once <HI>she gave a ring to the earl of Tholouse.</HI> The supposed confessor pronounces her innocent of the charge brought against her; on which one of the traiterous knights affirms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the monk was suborned to publish this confession, and that he deserved to be consumed in the same fire which was prepared for the lady. The monk pretending that the honour of his religion and character was affected by this insinuation, challenges both the knights to combat: they are conquered; and the empress, after this trial, is declared innocent. He then openly discovers himself to be the earl of Tholouse, the emperour's antient enemy. A solemn re∣conciliation ensues. The earl is appointed seneschal of the emperour's domain. The emperour lives only three years, and the earl is married to the empress.</P>
<P>In the execution of this performance, our author was obliged to be concise, as the poem was intended to be sung to the harp. Yet, when he breaks through this restraint, in∣stead of dwelling on some of the beautiful situations which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he story affords, he is diffuse in displaying trivial and un∣important circumstances. These popular poets are never so happy, as when they are describing a battle or a feast.</P>
<P>It will not perhaps be deemed impertinent to observe, that about this period the minstrels were often more amply paid than the clergy. In this age, as in more enlightened times, the people loved better to be pleased than instructed. During many of the years of the reign of Henry the sixth, particularly in the year 1430, at the annual feast of the fraternity of the HOLIE CROSSE at Abingdon, a town in
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
Berkshire, twelve priests each received four pence for sing∣ing a dirge: and the same number of minstrels were re∣warded each with two shillings and four pence, beside diet and horse-meat. Some of these minstrels came only from Maydenhithe, or Maidenhead, a town at no great distance in the same county <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hearne's Lib. Nig. Scacc. APPEND. p. 598.</NOTE>. In the year 1441, eight priests were hired from Coventry to assist in celebrating a yearly obit in the church of the neighbouring priory of Maxtoke; as were six minstrels, called MIMI, belonging to the family of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord Clinton, who lived in the adjoining castle of Maxtoke, to sing, harp, and play, in the hall of the monastery, during the extraordinary refection allowed to the monks on that anniversary. Two shillings were given to the priests, and four to the minstrels <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ex Computis Prioris Priorat. de Max∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock. penes me.

before I proceed in my series, I will employ the remainder of this section in fixing the reader's attention on an im∣portant circumstance, now operating in its full extent, and therefore purposely reserved for this period, which greatly contributed to the improvement of our literature, and con∣sequently of our poetry: I mean the many translations of Latin books, especially classics, which the French had been making for about the two last centuries, and were still con∣tinuing to make, into their own language. In order to do this more effectually, I will collect into one view the most distinguished of these versions: not solicitous about those notices on this subject which have before occurred inciden∣tally; nor scrupulous about the charge of anticipation, which, to prepare the reader, I shall perhaps incur by lengthening this enquiry, for the sake of comprehension, beyond the limits of the period just assigned. In the mean time it may be pertinent to premise, that from the close communication which formerly subsisted between England and France, manuscript copies of many of these translations, elegantly written, and often embellished with the most splendid illu∣minations and curious miniatures, were presented by the translators or their patrons to the kings of England; and that they accordingly appear at present among the royal manuscripts in the British Museum. Some of these, how∣ever, were transcribed, if not translated, by command of our kings; and others brought into England, and placed in the royal library, by John duke of Bedford, regent of France.</P>
<P>It is not consistent with my design, to enumerate the Latin legends, rituals, monastic rules, chronicles, and historical parts of the bible, such as the BOOK OF KINGS and the MACCABEES, which were looked upon as stories of chivalry <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">As <Q REND="inline">"Plusieurs Battailes des Roys d'Israel en contre les Philistien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> et Assyrien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp;c."</Q> Brit.

These however ought to be looked upon as efforts of their early poetry, rather than translations.</NOTE>. I will therefore begin with the thirteenth cen∣tury. In the year 1210, Peter Comestor's<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Or <HI>Le Mangeur,</HI> because he <HI>devoured</HI> the scriptures.</NOTE> HISTORIA SCHO∣LASTICA, a sort of breviary of the old and new testament, accompanied with elaborate expositions from Josephus and many pagan writers, a work compiled at Paris about the year 1175, and so popular, as not only to be taught in schools, but even to be publicly read in the churches with its glosses, was translated into French by Guiart des Moulins, a canon of Aire <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The French was first published, with∣out date or place, in two tomes.

About the same time, some of the old translations into French made in the eleventh century by Thibaud de Vernon, canon of Rouen, were retouched: and the Latin legends of many lives of saints, particularly of saint George, of Thomas a Beckett, and the martyrdom of saint Hugh, a child murthered in 1206 by a Jew at Lincoln <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Chaucer, PRIORES. T. p. 144. col. 2. v. 3193.</NOTE>, were reduced into French verse.

During the work he received a yearly pension of six hundred livres from that liberal monarch, the first founder of a royal library in France, at whose command it was undertaken. It is accompanied with a prolix commentary, valuable only at present as preserving anecdotes of the opinions, manners, and literature, of the writer's age; and from which I am tempted to give the following specimen, as it strongly illus∣trates the antient state of the French stage, and demonstrably proves that comedy and tragedy were now known only by name in France <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 235.</NOTE>. He observes, that Comedies are so denomi∣nated from a room of entertainment, or from those places, in which banquets were accustomed to be closed with singing, called in Greek CONIAS: that they were like those <HI>jeux</HI> or plays, which the minstrel, <HI>le Chanteur,</HI> exhibits in halls or other public places, at a feast: and that they were properly styled INTERLUDIA, as being presented between the two courses.

But to proceed, Cassianus's COLLATIONES PATRUM, or the CONFERENCES, was translated by John Goulain, a Carmelite monk, about 1363. Two translations of that theological romance Boethius's CON∣SOLATION, one by the celebrated Jean de Meun, author of the ROMANCE OF THE ROSE, existed before the year 1340. Others of the early Latin christian writers were ordered to be turned into French by queen Jane, about 1332. But finding that the archbishop of Rouen, who was commissioned to execute this arduous task, did not understand Latin, she employed a mendicant friar. About the same period, and under the same patronage, the LEGENDA AUREA, written by James de Voragine, archbishop of Genoa, about the year 1260, that inexhaustible repository of religious fable <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">In the year 1555, the learned Claud.

King John, having indulged his de∣votion, and satisfied his conscience, by procuring numerous versions of books written on sacred subjects, at length turn∣ed his attention to the classics. His ignorance of Latin was a fortunate circumstance, as it produced a curiosity to know the treasures of Latin literature. He employed Peter Ber∣cheur, prior of saint Eloi at Paris, an eminent theologist, to translate Livy into French <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Henault, NOUVEL.

But so judicious a choice was undoubtedly dictated by Petrarch, who regard∣ed Livy with a degree of enthusiasm, who was now resident at the court of France, and who perhaps condescended to direct and superintend the translation. The translator in his Latin work called REPERTORIUM, a sort of general dictionary, in which all things are proved to be allegorical, and reduced to a moral meaning, under the word ROMA, records this great attempt in the following manner. <Q REND="inline">"TITUM LIVIUM, ad requisitionem domini Johannis inclyti Francorum regis, <HI>non sine labore et sudoribus,</HI> in linguam Gallicam transtuli <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">This was the translation of Livy, which, with other books, the duke of Bedford, re∣gent of France, about 1425, sent into Eng∣land to Humphrey duke of Gloucester.

<P>In the fifteenth century it became fashionable among the

French, to polish and reform their old rude translations made two hundred years before; and to reduce many of their metrical versions into prose. At the same time, the rage of translating ecclesiastical tracts began to decrease. The latter circumstance was partly owing to the introduction of better books, and partly to the invention of printing. Instead of procuring laborious and expensive translations of the antient fathers, the printers, who multiplied greatly to∣wards the close of this century, found their advantage in publishing new translations of more agreeable books, or in giving antient versions in a modern dress <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I take this opportunity of observing, that one of these was the romance of sir LANCELOT DU LAC, translated from the Latin by Robert de Borron, at the com∣mand of our Henry the second or third.

It was printed at Paris 1485. fol. Again, ibid. 1534. 8vo. It was again translated by Antoine le Macon, fol. Paris 1543. And often afterwards.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am not exactly informed, when the ENEID of Virgil was translated into a sort of metrical romance or history of Eneas,
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
under the title of LIVRE D' ENEIDOS COMPILE PAR VIRGILE, by Guillaume de Roy. But that translation was printed at Lyons in 1483, and appears to have been finished not many years before. Among the translator's historical additions, are the description of the first foundation of Troy by Priam, and the succession of Ascanius and his descendants after the death of Turnus. He introduces a digression upon Boccacio, for giving in his FALL OF PRINCES an account of the death of Dido, different from that in the fourth book of the Eneid. Among his omissions, he passes over Eneas's descent into hell, as a tale manifestly forged, and not to be believed by any rational reader: as if many other parts of the tran∣slator's story were not equally fictitious and incredible <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">It was translated, and printed, by Caxton, 1490.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The conclusion intended to be drawn from this long di∣gression is obvious. By means of these French translations, our countrymen, who understood French much better than Latin, became acquainted with many useful books which they would not otherwise have known. With such assis∣tances, a commodious access to the classics was opened, and the knowledge of antient literature facilitated and famili∣arised in England, at a much earlier period than is imagined; and at a time, when little more than the productions of spe∣culative monks, and irrefragrable doctors, could be obtained or were studied. Very few Englishmen, I will venture to pronounce, had read Livy before the translation of Ber∣cheur was imported by the regent duke of Bedford. It is certain that many of the Roman poets and historians were now read in England, in the original. But the Latin lan∣guage was for the most part confined to a few ecclesiastics. When these authors, therefore, appeared in a language almost as intelligible as the English, they fell into the hands of illiterate and common readers, and contributed to sow the seeds of a national erudition, and to form a popular taste.
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
Even the French versions of the religious, philosophical, historical, and allegorical compositions of those more en∣lightened Latin writers who flourished in the middle ages, had their use, till better books came into vogue: pregnant as they were with absurdities, they communicated instruc∣tion on various and new subjects, enlarged the field of in∣formation, and promoted the love of reading, by gratifying that growing literary curiosity which now began to want materials for the exercise of its operations. How greatly our poets in general availed themselves of these treasures, we may collect from this circumstance only: even such writers as Chaucer and Lydgate, men of education and learning, when they translate a Latin author, appear to exe∣cute their work through the medium of a French version. It is needless to pursue this history of French translation any farther. I have given my reason for introducing it at all. In the next age, a great and universal revolution in literature ensued; and the English themselves began to turn their thoughts to translation.</P>
<P>These French versions enabled Caxton, our first printer, to enrich the state of letters in this country with many valuable publications. He found it no difficult task, either by himself, or the help of his friends, to turn a considerable number of these pieces into English, which he printed. Antient learning had as yet made too little progress among us, to encourage this enterprising and industrious artist to publish the Roman autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in their original language <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>It is, however, remarkable, that from the year 1471, in which Caxton began to print, down to the year 1540, during which period the English press flourished greatly under the conduct of many industrious, in∣genious, and even learned artists, only the very few following classics, some of which hardly deserve that name, were printed in England. These were, BOETHIUS <HI>de Consolatione;</HI> both Latin and English, for Caxton, without date. The Latin ESO∣PIAN Fables, in verse, for Wynkyn de Worde, 1503. 4to. [And once or twice afterwards.] TERENCE, with the Com∣ment of Badi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Ascensius, for the same, 1504. 4to. VIRGIL'S BUCOLICS, for the same, 1512. 4to. [Again, 1533. 4to.] TULLY'S OFFICES, Latin and English, the translation by Whittington, 1533. 4to. The university of Oxford, during this pe∣riod, produced only the first Book of TULLY'S EPISTLES, at the charge of cardinal Wolsey, without date, or printer's name. Cambridge not a single classic.</P>
<P>No Greek book, of any<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kind, had yet appeared from an English press. I believe the first Greek characters used in any work printed in England, are in Linacer's tran∣slation of <HI>Galen de Temperamentis,</HI> printed at Cambridge in 1521, 4to. A few Greek words, and abbreviatures, are here and there introduced. The printer was John Siberch, a German, a friend of Erasmus, who styles himself <HI>primus</HI> UTRIUSQUE <HI>lin∣guae in Anglia impressor.</HI> There are Greek characters in some of his other books of this date. But he printed no entire Greek book. In Linacer's treatise <HI>De emendata Structura Latini sermonis,</HI> printed by Pin∣son in 1524, many Greek characters are intermixed. In the sixth book are seven Greek lines together. But the printer apologises for his imperfections and un∣skillfulness in the Greek types; which, he says, were but recently cast, and not in a sufficient quantity for such a work. The passage is curious. <Q REND="inline">"Aequo animo feras siquae literae, in exemplis Hellenismi, vel <HI>tonis</HI> vel <HI>spiritibus</HI> careant. His enim non <HI>satts instructus</HI> erat typogra∣phus, videlicet <HI>recens</HI> ab <HI>eo fusis</HI> ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣racteribus Graecis, nec <HI>parata</HI> ei <HI>copia</HI> qua ad hoc agendum opus est."</Q> About the same period of the English press, the same embarrassments appear to have hap∣pened with regard to Hebrew types; which yet were more likely, as that language was so much less known. In the year 1524, doctor Robert Wakefield, chaplain to Henry the eighth, published his <HI>Oratio de laudibus et utilitate trium linguarum Ara∣bicae, Chald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, et Hebraicae,</HI> &amp;c. 4to. The printer was Wynkyn de Worde; and the author complains, that he was obliged to omit his whole third part, because the printer had no Hebrew types. Some few Hebrew and Arabic characters, however, are introduced; but extremely rude, and evidently cut in wood. They are the first of the sort used in England. This learned orientalist was instrumental in preserving, at the dissolution of monasteries, the He∣brew manuscripts of Ramsey abbey, col∣lected by Holbech one of the monks, to∣gether with Holbech's <HI>Hebrew Dictionary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Wood, Hist. Ant. Univ. Oxon. ii. 251. Leland. Scriptor. v. HOLBECCUS.</P>
<P>It was a circumstance favourable at least to English literature, owing indeed to the general illiteracy of the times, that our first printers were so little employed on books written in the learned languages. Almost all Caxton's books are English. The multiplication of English copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s mul∣tiplied English readers, and these again produced new vernacular writers. The ex∣istence of a press induced many persons to turn authors, who were only qualified to write in their native tongue.</P></NOTE>: and had not the French furnished him with these materials, it is not likely, that Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, and many other good

<P>This work is almost beneath criticism, and fit only for the attention of an antiquary.

<P>In this reign, the first mention of the king's poet, under the appellation of LAUREATE, occurs. John Kay was ap∣pointed poet laureate to Edward the fourth. It is extra∣ordinary, that he should have left no pieces of poetry to prove his pretensions in some degree to this office, with which he is said to have been invested by the king, at his return from Italy.

<P>With regard to the Poet laureate of the kings of England, an officer of the court remaining under that title to this day, he is undoubtedly the same that is styled the KING'S VER∣SIFIER, and to whom one hundred shillings were paid as his annual stipend, in the year 1251 <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.

It seems most probable, that the barbarous and inglorious name of VER∣SIFIER gradually gave way to an appellation of more ele∣gance and dignity: or rather, that at length, those only were in general invited to this appointment, who had re∣ceived accademical sanction, and had merited a crown of laurel in the universities for their abilities in Latin compo∣sition, particularly Latin versification.

<P>Andrew Bernard, successively poet laureate of Henry the seventh and the eighth, affords a still stronger proof that this officer was a Latin scholar. He was a native of Tho∣louse, and an Augustine monk. He was not only the king's poet laureate <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See an instrument PRO POETA LAU∣REATO. dat. 1486. Rymer's FO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>D. tom. xii. p. 317.

<P>I am of opinion, that it was not customary for the royal laureate to write in English, till the reformation of religion had begun to diminish the veneration for the Latin language: or rather, till the love of novelty, and a better sense of things, had banished the narrow pedantries of monastic erudition, and taught us to cultivate our native tongue. In the mean time it is to be wished, that another change might at least be suffered to take place in the execution of this institution, which is confessedly Gothic, and unaccommodated to modern manners. I mean, that the more than annual return of a composition on a trite argument would be no longer re∣quired. I am conscious I say this at a time, when the best of kings affords the most just and copious theme for pane∣gyric: but I speak it at a time, when the department is honourably filled by a poet of taste and genius, which are idly wasted on the most splendid subjects, when imposed by constraint, and perpetually repeated.</P>
<P>To what is here incidentally collected on an article more

curious than important, I add an observation, which shews that the practice of other nations in this respect altogether corresponded with that of our own. When we read of the laureated poets of Italy and Germany, we are to remember, that they most commonly received this honour from the state, or some university; seldom, at least not immediately, from the prince: and if we find any of these professedly em∣ployed in the department of a court-poet, that they were not, in consequence of that peculiar situation, styled poets laureate.

<P>John Scogan is commonly supposed to have been a co∣temporary of Chaucer, but this is a mistake <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Hollinsh. Chron. iii. f. 710.

<P>In the year 1768, when the present new bridge at Bristol was finished and opened for passengers, an account of the ceremonies observed on occasion of opening the old bridge, appeared in one of the Bristol Journals; taken, as it was declared, from an antient manuscript <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>The old bridge was built about the year 1248.

C. ut supr. At the end of N. iii. is the manu∣script HISTORY just mentioned, supposed to have been compiled by Abel Wantner, of Minchin-Hampton in Glocestershire, who published proposals and specimens for a history of that county, in 1683.</P></NOTE>. Curiosity was na∣turally raised to know from whence it came. At length, after much enquiry concerning the person who sent this singular memoir to the news-paper, it was discovered that he
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
was a youth about seventeen years old, whose name was Chatterton; and whose father had been sexton of Radcliffe church for many years, and also master of a writing-school in that parish, of which the church-wardens were trustees. The father however was now dead: and the son was at first unwilling to acknowledge, from whom, or by what means, he had procured so valuable an original. But after many pro∣mises, and some threats, he confessed that he received a manuscript on parchment containing the narrative above∣mentioned, together with many other manuscripts on parch∣ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his father; who had found them in an iron chest, the same that I have mentioned, placed in a room situated over the northern entrance of the church.</P>
<P>It appears that the father became possessed of these manu∣scripts in the year 1748. For in that year, he was permit∣ted, by the church-wardens of Radcliffe-church, to take from this chest several written pieces of parchment, sup∣posed to be illegible and useless, for the purpose of conver∣ting them into covers for the writing-books of his scholars. It is impossible to ascertain, what, or how many, writings were destroyed, in consequence of this absurd and unwar∣rantable indulgence. Our school-master, however, whose accomplishments were much above his station, and who was not totally destitute of a taste for poetry, found, as it is said, in this immense heap of obsolete manuscripts, many poems written by Thomas Rowlie abovementioned, priest of Saint John's church in Bristol, and the confessor of al∣derman Cannynge, which he carefully preserved. These at his death, of course fell into the hands of his son.</P>
<P>Of the extraordinary talents of this young man more will be said hereafter. It will be sufficient to observe at pre∣sent, that he saw the merit and value of these poems, which he diligently transcribed. In the year 1770, he went to Lon∣don, carrying with him these transcripts, and many originals, in hopes of turning so in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stimable a treasure to his great
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
advantage. But from these flattering expectations, falling into a dissipated course of life, which ill suited with his narrow circumstances, and finding that a writer of the most distin∣guished taste and judgement, Mr. Walpole, had pronounced the poems to be suspicious, in a fit of despair, arising from distress and disappointment, he destroyed all his papers, and poisoned himself. Some of the poems however, both tran∣scripts and originals, he had previously sold, either to Mr. Catcott, a merchant of Bristol, or to Mr. Barrett, an emi∣nent surgeon of the same place, and an ingenious antiquary, with whom they now remain <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mr. Barrett, to whom I am greatly o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his unreserved and liberal infor∣mation on this subject, is now engaged in writing the ANTIQUITIES of BRISTOL.</NOTE>. But it appears, that among these there were but very few of parchment: most of the poems which they purchased were copies in his own hand. He was always averse to give any distinct or satisfactory account of what he possessed: but from time to time, as his necessities required, he produced copies of his originals, which were bought by these gentlemen. The originals, one or two only excepted, he chose to retain in his own possession.</P>
<P>The chief of these poems are, The TRAGEDY of ELLA, The EXECUTION of sir CHARLES BAWDWIN, ODE to ELLA, The BATTLE of HASTINGS, The TOURNAMENT, one or two DIALOGUES, and a Description of CANNYNGE'S FEAST.</P>
<P>The TRAGEDY OF ELLA has six characters; one of which is a lady, named Birtha. It has a chorus consisting of minstrels, whose songs are often introduced. Ella was go∣vernor of the castle of Bristol, and a puissant champion against the Danes, about the year 920. The story seems to be the poet's invention. The tragedy is opened with the following soliloquy.</P>

<P>The ODE TO ELLA is said to have been sent by Rowlie in the year 1468, as a specimen of his poetical abilities, to his intimate friend and cotemporary Lydgate, who had chal∣lenged him to write verses.

<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owe</HI> should be <HI>Stone,</HI> a Carmelite friar of Bristol, educated at Cambridge, and a fa∣mous preacher. Lydgate's answer on re∣ceiving the ode, which certainly cannot be genuine, is beneath transcription. The writer, freely owning his inferiority, de∣clares, that Rowlie rivals Chaucer and Turgotus, who both lived in <HI>Norman tymes.</HI> The latter, indeed, may in some measure be said to have flourished in that era, for he died bishop of Saint Andrews in 1115. But he is oddly coupled with Chaucer in another respect, for he wrote only some Latin chronicles. Besides, Lydgate must have been sufficiently acquainted with Chau∣cer's age; for he was living, and a young man, when Chaucer died. The writer also m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntions Stone, the Carmelite, as living with Chaucer and Turgotus: where∣as he was Lydgate's cotemporary. These circumstances, added to that of the extreme and affected meanness of the composition, evidently prove this little piece a forgery.</NOTE>. I will give this piece at length.</P>

<P>I am of opinion, that none of these pieces are genuine. The EXECUTION of SIR CHARLES BAUDWIN is now allowed to be modern, even by those who maintain all the other poems to be antient <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It contains 98 stanzas, and was printed at London, in the year 1772. 4to. I am told, that in the abovementioned chest, belonging to Radcliffe-church, an antient Record was discovered, containing the expences for Ed∣ward the fourth to see the execution of sir Charles Baldwin; with a description of a canopy under which the king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate at thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> execution. This Record seems to have given rise to the poem. A bond which sir Charles Baldwin gave to king Henry the sixth, I suppose about seizing the earl of Warwick, is said to have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n mentioned in one of Rowlie's manuscripts, called the YELLOW ROLL, perhaps the same, found in Cannynge's chest, but now lost. See Stowe's CHRON. by Howes, edit. fol. 1615. p. 406. col. 2. And Speed's, p. 669. col. 2. edit. 1611. Stowe says, that king Ed∣ward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fourth was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Bristol, on a pro∣gress through England, in the <HI>harvest s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣son</HI> of the year 1462. And that he was <HI>mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> royally received.</HI> Ibid. p. 416. col. 2. Cannynge was then mayor of Bristol. Sir Charles Baldwin is said to have been exe∣cuted at Bristol, in the presence of Edward the fourth, in the year 1463. MS. Wantn. Bibl. Bodl. ut supr. The same king was at Bristol, and lodged in saint Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tine's abbey, in 1472, when he received a large gratuity from the citizens for carrying on the war against France. Wantner, ibid.</NOTE>. The ODE TO ELLA, and the EPIS∣TLE to Lydgate, with his ANSWER, were written on one piece of parchment; and, as pretended, in Rowlie's own hand. This was shewn to an ingenious critic and intelli∣gent antiquary of my acquaintance; who assure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me, that the writing was a gross and palpable forgery. It was not even skilfully counterfeited. The form of the letters, al∣though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance, differed very essentially from every one of our early alpha∣bets. Nor were the characters uniform and consistent: part of the same manuscript exhibiting some letters shaped
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
according to the present round hand, while others were traced in imitation of the antient court and text hands. The parchment was old; and that it might look still older, was stained on the outside with ochre, which was easily rubbed off with a linen cloth. Care had also been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast. To communi∣cate a stronger stamp of rude antiquity, the ODE was writ∣ten like prose: no distinction, or termination, being made between the several verses. Lydgate's ANSWER, which makes a part of this manuscript, and is written by the same hand, I have already proved to be a manifest imposition. This parchment has since been unfortunately lost <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">At the same time, another manuscript on parchment, written, as pretended, by Rowlie, was shewn to this gentleman: which, tallying in every respect with the ODE to ELLA, plainly appeared to be forged, in the same manner, and by the same modern hand. It was in prose; and contained an account of Saxon coins, and the rise of coining in England, with a list of coins, poems, antient inscriptions, mo∣numents, and other curiosities, in the ca∣binet of Cannynge abovementioned. This parchment is also lost; and, I believe, no copy remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. I have my∣self carefully examined the original manuscript, as it is called, of the little piece entitled, ACCOUNTE OF W. CAN∣NYNGE'S FEAST. It is likewise on parchment, and, I am sorry to say, that the writing betrays all the suspicious sig∣natures which were observed in that of the ODE TO ELLA. I have repeatedly and diligently compared it with three or four authentic manuscripts of the time of Edward the fourth, to all which I have found it totally unlike. Among other smaller vestiges of forgery, which cannot be so easily described and explained here, at the bottom are added in ink two coats of arms, containing empalements of Cannynge and of his friends or relations, with family-names, appa∣rently delineated by the same pen which wrote the verses. Even the style and drawing of the armorial bearings disco∣ver the hand of a modern herald. This, I believe, is the only pretended original of the poetry of Rowlie, now remaining.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="161"/>
As to internal arguments, an unnatural affectation of antient spelling and of obsolete words, not belonging to the period assigned to the poems, strikes us at first sight. Of these old words combinations are frequently formed, which never yet existed in the unpolished state of the Eng∣lish language: and sometimes the antiquated diction is most inartificially misapplied, by an improper contexture with the present modes of speech. The attentive reader will also discern, that our poet sometimes forgets his assumed cha∣racter, and does not always act his part with consistency: for the chorus, or interlude, of the damsel who drowns herself, which I have cited at length from the TRAGEDY of ELLA, is much more intelligible, and free from uncouth expressions, than the general phraseology of these composi∣tions. In the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, said to be translated from the Saxon, Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple. The battle of Hastings was fought in the year 1066. We will grant the Saxon original to have been written soon afterwards: about which time, no other notion prevailed concerning this miraculous monument, than the supposition which had been delivered down by long and constant tradi∣tion, that it was erected in memory of Hengist's massacre. This was the established and uniform opinion of the Welsh and Armorican bards, who most probably received it from the Saxon minstrels: and that this was the popular belief at the time of the battle of Hastings, appears from the evidence of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote his history not more than eighty years after that memorable event. And in this doctrine Robert of Gloucester and all the mon∣kish chroniclers agree. That the Druids constructed this stupendous pile for a place of worship, was a discovery re∣served for the sagacity of a wiser age, and the laborious discussion of modern antiquaries. In the EPISTLE to Lyd∣gate, prefixed to the TRAGEDY, our poet condemns the absurdity and impropriety of the religious dramas, and recommends
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
SOME GREAT STORY OF HUMAN MANNERS, as most suitable for theatrical representation. But this idea is the result of that taste and discrimination, which could only belong to a more advanced period of society <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>It would be tedious and trifling to de∣scend to minute particulars. But I will mention one or two. In the ODE TO ELLA, the poet supposes, that the spectre of Ella sometimes appears in the <HI>mynster,</HI> that is Bristol-cathedral. But when Rowlie is supposed to have lived, the present ca∣thedral of Bristol was nothing more than an Augustine monastery, in which Henry the eighth established long afterwards a bi∣shop, and a dean and chapter, in the year 1542. <HI>Minster</HI> is a word almost appro∣priated to Cathedrals: and I will venture to say, that the church of this monastery, before the present foundation took place, never was called <HI>Bristol-minster,</HI> or <HI>The min∣ster.</HI> The inattention to this circumstance, has produced another unfortunate anachro∣nism in some of Rowlie's papers. Where, in his panegyric on Cannynge he says, <Q REND="inline">"The favouryte of godde, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryende of the chyrche, the companyonne of kynges, and the fadre of hys natyve CITIE, the grete and good Wyllyamme Canynge."</Q> Bristol was never styled a CITY till the erection of its bishoprick in 1542. See Willis's NOTIT. PARLIAMENT. p. 43. Lond. 1750. See also king Henry's Patent for creating the bishoprick of Bristol, in Ry∣mer, dat. Jun. 4. A. D. 1542. An. reg. 34. Where the king orders, <Q REND="inline">"Ac quod tota <HI>Villa</HI> nostra Bristolliae <HI>exnunc</HI> et <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inceps</HI> imperpetuum sit <HI>Civitas,</HI> ipsamque CI∣VITATEM BRISTOLLIAE appellari et nominari, volumus et decernimus, &amp;c."</Q> FOED. tom. xv. p. 749. Bristol was <HI>pro∣claimed</HI> a CITY, an. 35 Henr. viii. MS. Wantner, ut supr. In which manuscript, to that period it is constantly called a <HI>town.</HI></P>
<P>The description of Cannynge's feast, is called an ACCOUNTE of CANNYNGE'S FEAST. I do not think, that so early as the year 1470, the word <HI>Accounte</HI> had lost its literal and original sense of a <HI>computus,</HI> or <HI>computation,</HI> and was used in a looser acceptation for <HI>narrative</HI> or <HI>detail.</HI> Nor had it even then lost its true spelling <HI>ac∣compt,</HI> in which its proper and primary sig∣nification is preserved and implied.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, above all, the cast of thought, the complexion of the sentiments, and the structure of the composition, evi∣dently prove these pieces not antient. The ODE TO ELLA, for instance, has exactly the air of modern poetry; such, I mean, as is written at this day, only disguised with an∣tique spelling and phraseology. That Rowlie was an ac∣complished literary character, a scholar, an historian, and an antiquarian, if contended for, I will not deny <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">He is also said to have been an emi∣nent mechanic and mathematician. I am informed, that one of Rowlie's manuscripts discovered in Cannynge's iron chest, was a plan for supporting the tower of the Tem∣ple-church in B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istol, which had greatly declined from its perpendicular. In a late reparation of that church, some subterra∣neous works were found, minutely corres∣ponding with this manuscript.</NOTE>. Nor is it impossible that he might write English poetry. But that he is the writer of the poems which I have here cited, and
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
which have been so confidently ascribed to him, I am not yet convinced.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that these poem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were composed by the son of the school-master before men∣tioned; who inherited the inestimable treasures of Cannynge's chest in Radcliffe-church, as I have already related at large. This youth, who died at eighteen, was a prodigy of genius: and would have proved the first of English poets, had he reached a maturer age. From his childhood, he was fond of reading and writing verses: and some of his early com∣positions, which he wrote without any design to deceive, have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age. From his situation and con∣nections, he became a skilful practitioner in various kinds of hand-writing. Availing himself therefore of his poetical talent, and his facility in the graphic art, to a miscellany of obscure and neglected parchments, which were commo∣diously placed in his own possession, he was tempted to add others of a more interesting nature, and such as he was enabled to forge, under these circumstances, without the fear of detection. As to his knowledge of the old English literature, which is rarely the study of a young poet, a suf∣ficient quantity of obsolete words and phrases were readily at∣tainable from the glossary to Chaucer, and to Percy's Ballads. It is confessed, that this youth wrote the EXECUTION OF SIR CHARLES BAWDWIN: and he who could forge that poem, might easily forge all the rest.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we will allow, that some pieces of poetry written by Rowlie might have been preserved in Cannynge's chest: and that these were enlarged and improved by young Chatterton. But if this was the case, they were so much altered as to become entirely new compositions. The poem which bids the fairest to be one of these originals is CANNYNGE'S FEAST. But the parchment-manuscript of this little poem has already been proved to be a forgery. A circumstance
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
which is perhaps alone sufficient to make us suspect that no originals ever existed.</P>
<P>It will be asked, for what end or purpose did he contrive such an imposture? I answer, from lucrative views; or perhaps from the pleasure of deceiving the world, a motive which, in many minds, operates more powerfully than the hopes of gain. He probably promised himself greater emo∣luments from this indirect mode of exercising his abilities: or, he might have sacrificed even the vanity of appearing in the character of an applauded original author, to the private enjoyment of the success of his invention and dexterity.</P>
<P>I have observed above, that Cannynge ordered his iron chest in Radcliffe-church to be solemnly visited once in every year, and that an annual entertainment should be provided for the visitors. In the notices relating to this matter, which some of the chief patrons of Rowlie's poetry hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lately sent me from Bristol, it is affirmed, that this order is contained in Cannynge's will: and that he specifies therein, that not only his manuscript evidences abovementioned, but that the POEMS of HIS CONFESSOR ROWLIE, which likewise he had deposited in the aforesaid iron chest, were also to be submitted to this annual inspection. This circumstance at first strongly inclined me to think favourably of the authen∣ticity of these pieces. At least it proved, that Rowlie had left some performances in verse. But on examining Can∣nynge's will, no such order appears. All his bequests re∣lating to Radcliffe-church, of every kind, are the following. He leaves legacies to the vicar, and the three clerks, of the said church: to the two chantry-priests, or chaplains, of his foundation: to the keeper of the PYXIS OBLATIO∣NUM, in the north-door: and to the fraternity <HI>Comme∣moracionis martirum.</HI> Also vestments to the altars of saint Catharine, and saint George. He mentions his tomb built near the altar of saint Catharine, where his late wife is in∣rerred. He gives augmentations to the endowment of his
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
two chantries <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Compare Willis, MITR. ABB. ii. 88.</NOTE>, at the altars of saint Catharine and saint George, abovementioned. To the choir, he leaves two ser∣vice-books, called <HI>Liggers,</HI> to be used there, on either side, by his two chantry-priests. He directs, that his funeral shall be celebrated in the said church with a <HI>month's mind,</HI> and the usual solemnities <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>This will is in Latin, dated Nov. 12. 1474.

Beside the bequests mentioned in the text, he leaves legacies to all the canons, the chaplains and deacons, and the twelve cho∣risters, of Westbury college. To the six priests, six almsmen and six almswomen, founded in the new chapel at Westbury by Carpenter, bishop of Worcester. To many of the servants of the said college.

<P>Bishop Carpenter, about the year 1460, was a considerable benefactor to Westbury college. He pulled down the old college, <Q REND="inline">"and in the new building, enlarged it very much, compassing it about with a strong wall embattled, adding a faire gate with divers towers, more like unto a castle than a colledge: and lastly, bestowed much good land for augment∣ing the revenew of the same."</Q> Godwin, SUCCESS.

<P>Very few anecdotes of Rowlie's life have descended to posterity. The following MEMOIRS of his life are said to have been written by himself in the year 1460, and to have been discovered with his poetry: which perhaps to many readers will appear equally spurious.</P>
<Q><P>I was fadre confessour to masteres Roberte and mastre William Cannings. Mastre Roberte was a man after his fadre's own harte, greedie of gaynes and sparying of alms deedes; but master William was mickle courteous, and gave me many marks in my needs. At the age of twenty-two years deceasd master Roberte, and by master William's desyre,
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
bequeathd me one hundred marks; I went to thank master<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> William for his mickle courtesie, and to make tender of my selfe to him.—Fadre, quod he, I have a crotchett in my brayne that will need your aide. Master William, said I, if you command me I will go to Roome for you; not so farr distant, said he: I ken you for a mickle learnd priest, if you will leave the parysh of our ladie, and travel for mee, it shall be mickle to your profits.</P>
<P>I gave my hands, and he told mee I must goe to all the abbies and pryorys, and gather together auncient drawy∣ings <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I much doubt, if this word now ex∣isted, in the modern, or any, sense. In∣deed, the phrase <HI>to draw a picture</HI> might have been now known: but to <HI>draw,</HI> in its present uncombined use, had not yet acquired this meaning. So late as the reign of James the first, a Painter was often called a <HI>picture-drawer.</HI> In antient inven∣tories of furniture, a <HI>drawing</HI> never occurs as any species of production of the art of designing: it became a technical and dis∣tinguishing term when that art began to attain some degree of maturity. <HI>Pictures,</HI> although this word is now confined to a precise signification, would not have been improper here. Yet the word <HI>Picture</HI> was not antiently used in its present sense and manner: but, a <HI>picture with a cloth, a table with a picture,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, if of anie account at any price. Consented I to the same, and pursuant sett out the Mundaie following for the minster of our ladie<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">I suppose, Worcester cathedral.</NOTE> and Saint Goodwyne, where a draw∣ing of a steeple, contryvd for the belles when runge to swaie out of the syde into the ayre, had I thence, it was done by syr Symon de Mambrie <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Or Malmesbury.</NOTE>, who in the troublesomme rayne of kyng Stephen devoted himselfe, and was shorne.</P>

<P>It is with regret that I find myself obliged to pronounce Rowlie's poems to be spurious. Antient remains of English poetry, unexpectedly discovered, and fortunately rescued from a long oblivion, are contemplated with a degree of fond enthusiasm: exclusive of any real or intrinsic excellence, they afford those pleasures, arising from the idea of anti∣quity, which deeply interest the imagination. With these pleasures we are unwilling to part. But there is a more solid satisfaction, resulting from the detection of artifice and imposture.</P>

<P>A mutilated poem which occurs among the Cotton ma∣nuscripts in the British museum, and principally contains a satire on the nuns, who not less from the nature of their establishment, than from the usual degeneracy which attends all institutions, had at length lost their original purity, seems to belong to this period <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Disadvantageous suspicions against the chastity of the female religious were <HI>pre∣tended</HI> in earlier times.

by the example and authority of so venerable an ec∣clesiastic, and tempted probably by the convenient oppor∣tunity of pilfering phraseology from a predecessor in the same arduous task, Caxton translated the same Latin work; but from the French version of a Latin paraphrase, and into English prose, which he printed in the year 1483. He calls, in his preface, the measure, used by Burgh, the BALAD ROYAL. Caxton's translation, which superseded Burgh's work, and with which it is confounded, is divided into four books, which comprehend seventy-two heads.</P>

From an abbess disposed to turn author, we might more reasonably have expected a manual of meditations for the closet, or select rules for making salves, or distilling strong waters.

<P>Our translator in these verses formally declares his in∣tention of giving his reader no entertainment; and disavows all concern with secular vanities, especially those unedifying tales of love and arms, which were the customary themes of other poets, and the delight of an idle age. The romances of OCTAVIAN, sir BEVIS, and sir GUY, have already been discussed at large. That of sir ISEMBRAS was familiar in the time of Chaucer, and occurs in the RIME of SIR THOPAS <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">V. 6. See supr. vol. i. p. 123. Notes.</NOTE>.

The incidents are for the most part those trite expedients, which almost constantly form the plan of these metrical narratives.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity of remarking, that the MIN∣STRELS, who in this prologue of Nassyngton are named separately from the GESTOURS, or tale-tellers, were some∣times distinguished from the harpers. In the year 1374, six Minstrels, accompanied with four Harpers, on the anni∣versary of Alwyne the bishop, <HI>performed</HI> their <HI>minstrelsies,</HI> at dinner, in the hall of the convent of saint Swithin at Win∣chester; and during supper, sung the same GEST, or tale, in the great <HI>arched</HI> chamber of the prior: on which solemn occasion, the said chamber was hung with the arras, or tapestry, of THE THREE KINGS OF COLOGNE <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>Registr.

Among the Harleian manuscripts, there is an antient song on the three kings of Cologne, in which the whole story of that favorite romance is resolved into al∣chemy. MSS. 2407. 13. fol.

There was an annual mass at the shrine or tomb of bishop Alwyne in the church, which was regularly followed by a feast in the convent. It is probable, that the GEST here specified was some poetical legend of the prelate, to whose memory this yearly festival was instituted, and who was a Saxon bishop of Winchester about the year 1040 <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">He is buried in the north wall of the presbytery, with an inscription.</NOTE>.

<P>Who would suspect that this absurd legend had also a Greek original?

<P>On the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me subject there is an Arabic book, probably compiled soon after the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Mahometani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, translated into La∣tin by Sikius, called EVANGELIUM IN∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ANTIAE, Arab. et Latin.

<P>Henry Bradshaw has rather larger pretensions to poeti∣cal fame than William of Nassington, although scarcely deserving the name of an original writer in any respect.

<P>I know not whether this anecdote about Noah is in any similar supposititious book of Genesis. It occurs, however, in the <HI>Chester Whitsun Playes,</HI> where the authors, according to the established indulgence al∣lowed to dramatic poets, perhaps thought themselves at liberty to enlarge on the sa∣cred story. MSS. Harl. 2013. This alter∣cation between Noah and his wife, takes up almost the whole third <HI>pageaunt</HI> of these interludes. Noah, having reproached his wife for her usual frowardness of temper, at last conjures her to come on board the ark, for fear of drowning. His wife in∣sists on his sailing without her; and swears by <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>saint John,</HI> that she will not embark, till some of her old female com∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions are ready to go with her. She adds, that if he is in such a hurry, he may sail alone, and fetch himself a new wife. At length Shem, with the help of his bro∣thers, forces her into the vessel; and while Noah very cordially welcomes her on board, she gives him a box on the ear.</P>

<P>If there be any merit of imagination or invention, to which the poet has a claim in this description, it altogether consists in the application. The circumstances themselves are faithfully copied by Bradshaw, from what his own age actually presented.

A great translator of the lives of the Saxon saints, from the Saxon, in which language only they were then extant, into Latin, was Goscelinus, a monk of Saint Austin's at Canterbury, who passed from France into England, with Herman, bishop of Salisbury, about the year 1058 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malmesbur. lib. iv. ubi infr.—Goscelin. in Praefatt. ad Vit. S. Augustini. See Mabillon, ACT. BEN. Saec. i. p. 499.</NOTE>. As the Saxon language was at this time but little understood, these translations opened a new and ample treasure of religious history: nor were they acquisitions only to the religion, but to the literature, of that era. Among the rest, were the Lives of saint Werburgh <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Printed, ACT. SANCTOR. Bolland. tom. i. februar. p. 386. A part in Leland, Coll. ii. 154. Compare MSS. C. C. C. Cant.

<P>A Latin legend on this saint is in MSS. Harl. 2316. 42.</P>
<P>Concerning legend-makers, there is a cu∣rious story in MSS. James, xxxi. p. 6. [ad ITER LANCASTR. num. 39. vol. 40.] Bibl. Bodl. Gilbert de Stone, a learned ecclesiastic, who flourished about the year 1380, was soli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed by the monks of Holywell in Flintshire, to write the life of their patron saint. Stone applying to these monks for materials, was answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, that they had none in their mo∣nastery<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Upon which he declared, that he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ute the work just as easily with∣out any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>terials at all: and that he would write them a most excellent legend, after the <HI>manner</HI> of the legend of Thomas a Becket. He has the character of an ele∣gant Latin writer; and seems to have done the same piece of service, perhaps in the same way, to other religious houses. From his EPISTLES, it appears that he wrote the life of saint <HI>Wolfade,</HI> patron of the priory of canons regular of his native town of Stone in Staffordshire, which he dedicated to the prior, William de Madely. Epist. iii. dat. 1399. [MSS. Bibl. Bodl. Sup. D i. Art. 123.] He was Latin secretary to se∣veral bishops, and could possibly write a legend or a letter with equal facility. His epistles are 123 in number. The first of them, in which he is stiled <HI>chancellour to the bishop of Winchester,</HI> is to the archbi∣shop of Canterbury. That is, <HI>secretary.</HI> [MSS. Cotton. VITELL. E. x. 17.] This bishop of Winchester must have been Wil∣liam of Wykeham.</P>
<P>The most extraordinary composition of this kind, if we consider, among other cir∣cumstances, that it was compiled at a time when knowledge and literature had made some progress, and when mankind were so much less disposed to believe or to in∣vent miracles, more especially when the subject was quite recent, is the LEGEND of KING HENRY the SIXTH. It is enti∣tled, <HI>De</HI> MIRACULIS <HI>beatissimi illius Militis Christi, Henrici sexti, etc.</HI> That it might properly rank with other legends, it was translated from an English copy into Latin, by one Johannes, styled <HI>Pauperculus,</HI> a monk, about the year 1503, at the command of John Morgan, dean of Windsor, afterwards bishop of saint David's. It is divided into two books: to both of which, prefaces are prefixed, containing proofs of the miracles wrought by this pious monarch. At the beginning, there is a hymn, with a prayer, addressed to the royal saint. fol. 72.
<Q><L>Salve, miles preciose,</L>
<L>Rex Henrice generose, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Henry could not have been a complete saint without his legend. MSS. Harl. 423. 7. And MSS. Reg. 13 C. 8. What shall we think of the judgment and abilities of the dignified ecclesiastic, who could seriously patronise so ridiculous a narrative?</P></NOTE>. By <HI>mutavit dictando,</HI> we are to understand, that he
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
<HI>translated,</HI> or <HI>reformed,</HI> or, in the most general sense, <HI>wrote anew in Latin,</HI> these antiquated lives. His principal objects were the more recent saints, especially those of this island. Malmesbury says, <Q REND="inline">"Innumeras SANCTORUM VITAS RECEN∣TIUM <HI>stylo extulit,</HI> veterum vel amissas, vel <HI>informiter editas,</HI> comptius <HI>renovavit</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hist. Angl. lib. iv. p. 130.</NOTE>."</Q> In this respect, the labours of Gos∣celin partly resembled those of Symeon Metaphrastes, a cele∣brated Constantinopolitan writer of the tenth century: who obtained the distinguishing appellation of the METAPHRAST,
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
because, at the command, and under the auspices of Con∣stantine Porphyrogenitus, he modernised the more antient narratives of the miracles and martyrdoms of the most emi∣nent eastern and western saints, for the use of the Greek church: or rather digested, from detached, imperfect, or obsolete books on the subject, a new and more commodious body of the sacred biography.</P>
<P>Among the many striking contrasts between the manners and characters of antient and modern life, which these annals present, we must not be surprised to find a mercer, a sheriff, and an alderman of London, descending from his impor∣tant occupations, to write verses. This is Robert Fabyan, who yet is generally better known as an historian, than as a poet. He was esteemed, not only the most facetious, but the most learned, of all the mercers, sheriffs, and aldermen, of his time: and no layman of that age is said to have been better skilled in the Latin language. He flourished about the year 1494. In his CHRONICLE, or <HI>Concordance of histories,</HI> from Brutus to the year 1485, it is his usual practice, at the division of the books, to insert metrical prologues, and other pieces in verse. The best of his metres is the COM∣PLAINT of king Edward the second; who, like the per∣sonages in Boccacio's FALL OF PRINCES, is very dramatically introduced, reciting his own misfortunes <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Fol. 171. tom. ii. edit. 1533. See Hearne's Lib. Nig. Scacc. p. 425. And Praefat. p. xxxviii. Fabyan says, <Q REND="inline">"they are reported to be his own makynge, in the tyme of his emprysonment."</Q> ibid. By the way, there is a passage in this chronicler which points out the true read∣ing of a controverted passage in Shake∣speare, <Q REND="inline">"Also children were christened thorough all the land, and menne <HI>house∣led and anealed,</HI> excepte suche, &amp;c."</Q> tom. ii. p. 30. col. 2.</NOTE>. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> soli∣loquy is nothing more than a translation from a short and a very poor Latin poem attributed to that monarch, but probably written by William of Wyrcester, which is pre∣served among the manuscripts of the college of arms, and entitled, <HI>Lamentatio gloriosi regis Edvardi de Karnarvon quam edidit tempore suae incarcerationis.</HI> Our author's transitions
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
from prose to verse, in the course of a prolix narrative, seem to be made with much ease; and, when he begins to versify, the historian disappears only by the addition of rhyme and stanza. In the first edition of his CHRONICLE, by way of epilogues to his seven books, he has given us <HI>The seven joys of the Blessed Virgin in English Rime.</HI> And under the year 1325, there is a poem to the virgin; and another on one Badby, a Lollard, under the year 1409 <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Edit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond. 1516. fol.</NOTE>. These are suppressed in the later editions. He has likewise left a panegyric on the city of London; but despairs of doing justice to so noble a subject for verse, even if he had the eloquence of Tully, the morality of Seneca, and the harmony of that <HI>faire Lady</HI> Calliope <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fol. 2. tom. ii. ut supr.</NOTE>.

There is another copy in the same library, Num. 558. At the end the poet calls himself INFORTUNIO. This is an appellation which, I think, Spenser sometimes assumed. But Spenser was dead before the reign of James: nor has this piece any of Spenser's characteristic merit. It begins thus.

As an historian, our author is the dullest of compilers. He is equally attentive to the succession of the mayors of London, and of the monarchs of England: and seems to have thought the dinners at guildhall, and the pageantries of the city-companies, more interesting transactions, than our victories in France, and our struggles for public liberty at home. One of Fabyan's historical anecdotes, under the important reign of Henry the fifth, is, that a new weather∣cock was placed on the cross of Saint Paul's steeple. It is said, that cardinal Wolsey commanded many copies of this chronicle to be committed to the flames, because it made too ample a discovery of the excessive revenues of the clergy. The earlier chapters of these childish annals faithfully record all those fabulous traditions, which generally supply the place of historic monuments in describing the origin of a great nation.</P>
<P>Another poet of this period is John Watson, a priest. He wrote a Latin theological tract entitled SPECULUM CHRISTIANI, which is a sort of paraphrase on the decalogue and the creed <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">MSS. C. C. C. Oxon. 155. MSS. Laud. G. 12. MSS.

<P>In the library of Mr. Farmer, of Tus∣more in Oxfordshire, are, or were lately, a collection of hymns and antiphones, pa∣raphrased into English, by William Her∣bert, a Franciscan frier, and a famous preacher, about the year 1330.

<P>Caxton, the celebrated printer, was likewise a poet; and beside the rhyming introductions and epilogues with which he frequently decorates his books, has left a poem of con∣siderable length, entitled the WORKE OF SAPIENCE <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Printed by him, without date. fol. in thirty-seven leaves.</NOTE>. It comprehends, not only an allegorical fiction concerning the two courts of the castle of Sapience, in which there is no imagination, but a system of natural philosophy, grammar, logic, rhetoric, geometry, astronomy, theology, and other
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
topics of the fashionable literature. Caxton appears to be the author, by the prologue: yet it is not improbable, that he might on this occasion employ some professed versifier, at least as an assistant, to prepare a new book of original poetry for his press. The writer's design, is to describe the effects of wisdom from the beginning of the world: and the work is a history of knowledge or learning. In a vision, he meets the goddess SAPIENCE in a delightful meadow; who conducts him to her castle, or mansion, and there displays all her miraculous operations. Caxton, in the poem, in∣vokes the <HI>gylted goddess</HI> and <HI>moost facundyous lady</HI> Clio, apolo∣gises to those <HI>makers</HI> who delight in <HI>termes gay,</HI> for the in∣elegancies of language which as a foreigner he could not avoid, and modestly declares, that he neither means to rival or envy Gower and Chaucer.</P>
<P>Among the anonymous pieces of poetry belonging to this period, which are very numerous, the most conspicuous is the KALENDAR OF SHEPHERDS.

<P>In the eighth chapter of our KALENDER are described the seven visions, or the punishments in hell of the seven deadly sins, which Lazarus saw between his death and resurrection. These punishments are imagined with great strength of fancy, and accompanied with wooden cuts boldly touched, and which the printer Wynkyn de Worde probably procured from some German engraver at the infancy of the art <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Compare the torments of Dante's hell. INFERN. Cant. v. vi. seq.</NOTE>. The PROUD are bound by hooks of iron to vast wheels, like mills, placed between craggy precipices, which are in∣cessantly whirling with the most violent impetuosity, and sound like thunder. The ENVIOUS are plunged in a lake half frozen, from which as they attempt to emerge for ease, their naked limbs are instantly smote with a blast of such intolerable keenness, that they are compelled to dive again into the lake. To the WRATHFULL is assigned a gloomy cavern, in which their bodies are butchered, and their limbs mangled
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
by demons with various weapons. The SLOTHFULL are tormented in a <HI>horrible hall dark and tenebrous,</HI> swarming with innum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable flying serpents of various shapes and sizes, which sting to the heart. This, I think, is the Hell of the Gothic EDDA. The COVETOUS are dipped in cauldrons filled with boiling metals. The GLUTTONOUS are placed in a vale near a loathsome pool, abounding with venomous creatures, on whose banks tables are spread, from which they are per∣petually crammed with toads by devils. CONCUPISCENCE is punished in a field full of immense pits or wells, overflowing with fire and sulphur. This visionary scene of the infernal punishments seems to be borrowed from a legend related by Matthew Paris, under the reign of king John: in which the soul of one Thurkhill, a native of Tidstude in Essex is con∣veyed by saint Julian from his body, when laid asleep, into hell and heaven. In hell he has a sight of the torments of the damned, which are presented under the form and name of the INFERNAL PAGEANTS, and greatly resemble the fictions I have just described. Among the tormented, is a knight, who had passed his life in shedding much innocent blood at tilts and tournaments. He is introduced, com∣pleatly armed, on horseback; and couches his lance against the demon, who is commissioned to seize and to drag him to his eternal destiny. There is likewise a priest who never said mass, and a baron of the exchequer who took bribes. Tur∣kill is then conducted into the mansions of the blessed, which are painted with strong oriental colouring: and in Paradise, a garden replenished with the most delicious fruits, and the most exquisite variety of trees, plants, and flowers, he sees Adam, a personage of gigantic proportion, but the most beautiful symmetry, reclined on the side of a fountain which sent forth four streams of different water and colour, and under the shade of a tree of immense size and height, laden with fruits of every kind, and breathing the richest odours. Afterwards saint Julian conveys the soul of Turkhill back to
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
his body; and when awakened, he relates this vision to his parish-priest <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Matt. Paris. Hist. pag. 206. seq. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it.

<P>As the ideas of magnificence and elegance were enlarged, the public pageants of this period were much improved: and beginning now to be celebrated with new splendour, received, among other advantages, the addition of SPEAKING PERSONAGES. These spectacles, thus furnished with speakers, characteristically habited, and accompanied with proper scenery, co-operated with the MYSTERIES, of whose nature they partook at first, in introducing the drama. It was customary to prepare these shews at the reception of a prince, or any other solemnity of a similar kind: and they were pre∣sented on moveable theatres, or occasional stages, erected in the streets. The speeches were in verse; and as the pro∣cession moved forward, the speakers, who constantly bore some allusion to the ceremony, either conversed together in the form of a dialogue, or addressed the noble person whose presence occasioned the celebrity. Speakers seem to have been admitted into our pageants about the reign of Henry the sixth.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="206"/>
In the year 1432, when Henry the sixth, after his coro∣nation at Paris, made a triumphal entry into London, many stanzas, very probably written by Lydgate, were addressed to his majesty, amidst a series of the most splendid allegori∣cal spectacles, by a giant representing religious fortitude, Enoch and Eli, the holy Trinity, two <HI>Judges</HI> and eight <HI>Ser∣jeants of the coife, dame Clennesse,</HI> Mercy, Truth, and other personages of a like nature <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abyan, ubi supr. fol. 382. seq.</NOTE>.</P>

See the ceremonies at the corona∣tion of Henry the sixth, in 1430. Fab. ibid. fol. 378.</NOTE>. In the next reign in the year 1474, another prince Edward, son of Edward the fourth, visited Coventry, and was honoured with the same species of shew: he was first welcomed, in an octave stanza, by Edward the confessor; and afterwards addressed by saint George, completely armed: a king's daughter holding a lamb, and supplicating his assistance to protect her from a terrible dragon, the lady's father and mo∣ther, standing in a tower above, the conduit on which the champion was placed, <Q REND="inline">"renning wine in four places, and minstralcy of organ playing <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 221.</NOTE>."</Q> Undoubtedly the Fran∣ciscan friers of Coventry, whose sacred interludes, presented on Corpus Christi day, in that city, and at other places, make so conspicuous a figure in the history of the English drama <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 293. The friers themselves were the actors. But this prac∣tice being productive of some enormities, and the laity growing as wise as the clergy, at least as well qualified to act plays; there was an injunction in the MEXICAN COUN∣CIL, ratified at Rome in the year 1589, to prohibit all clerks from playing in the Mysteries, <HI>even on</HI> CORPUS CHRISTI∣DAY. <Q REND="inline">"Neque in Comoediis personam agat, <HI>etiam in</HI> FESTO CORPORIS CHRIS∣TI."</Q> SACROSANCT.

<P>At length, personages of another cast were added; and this species of spectacle, about the period with which we are
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
concerned, was enlivened by the admission of new characters, drawn either from profane history, or from profane al∣legory <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Profane allegory, however, had been applied in pageants, somewhat earlier.

These are the Dames, NATURE, GRACE, and FORTUNE. Fabyan, ut supr. fol. 382. seq. But this is a rare instance so early.</NOTE>, in the application of which, some degree of learn∣ing and invention appeared.</P>
<P>I have observed in a former work, and it is a topic which will again be considered in its proper place, that the frequent and familiar use of allegoric personifications in the public pageants, I mean the general use of them, greatly contri∣buted to form the school of Spenser <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Obs. FAIRY QUEEN. ii. 90.</NOTE>. But moreover from what is here said, it seems probable, that the PAGEAUNTS, which being shewn on civil occasions, derived great part of their decorations and actors from historical fact, and con∣sequently made profane characters the subject of public ex∣hibition, dictated ideas of a regular drama, much sooner than the MYSTERIES: which being confined to scripture stories, or rather the legendary miracles of sainted martyrs, and the no less ideal personifications of the christian virtues, were not calculated to make so quick and easy a transition to the representations of real life and rational action.</P>
<P>In the year 1501, when the princess Catharine of Spain came to London, to be married to prince Arthur, her pro∣cession through the city was very magnificent. The pa∣geants were numerous, and superbly furnished; in which the principal actors, or speakers, were not only God the father, saint Catharine, and saint Ursula, but king Alphonsus the astronomer and an ancestor of the princess, a Senator, an Angel, Job, Boethius, Nobility, and Virtue. These per∣sonages sustained a sort of action, at least of dialogue. The
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
lady was compared to Hesperus, and the prince to Arcturus; and Alphonsus, from his skill in the stars, was introduced to be the fortune-teller of the match <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. MS.</NOTE>. These machineries were contrived and directed by an ecclesiastic of great eminence, bishop Fox; who, says Bacon, <Q REND="inline">"was not only a grave coun∣sellor for war or peace, but also a good surveyor of works, and a good master of ceremonies, and any thing else that was fit for the active part, belonging to the service of court, or state of a great king."</Q> It is probable, that this prelate's dexterity and address in the conduct of a court∣rareeshow procured him more interest, than the gravity of his counsels, and the depth of his political knowledge: at least his employment in this business presents a striking picture of the importance of those popular talents, which even in an age of blind devotion, and in the reign of a superstitious monarch, were instrumental in paving the way to the most opulent dignities of the church. <Q REND="inline">"Whosoever, adds the same pene∣trating historian, had these toys in compiling, they were not altogether PEDANTICAL <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bacon's HENRY THE SEVENTH. COMPL. Hist. Engl. vol. i. p. 628.</NOTE>."</Q> About the year 1487, Henry the seventh went a progress into the north; and at every place of distinction was received with a pageant; in which he was saluted, in a poetical oration, not always religious, as, at York by Ebranck, a British king and the founder of the city, as well as by the holy virgin, and king David: at Worcester by Henry the sixth his uncle: at Hereford by saint George, and king Ethelbert, at en∣tering the cathedral there: at Bristol, by king Bremmius, Prudence, and Justice. The two latter characters were per∣sonated by young girls <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">From a manuscript in the Cotton li∣brary, printed in Leland. COLLECTAN. ad calc. vol. iii. p. 185.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mean time it is to be granted, that profane cha∣racters were personated in our pageants, before the close of the fourteenth century. Stowe relates, that in the year
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
1377, for the entertainment of the young prince Richard, son of Edward the black prince, one hundred and thirty citizens rode disguised from Newgate to Kennington where the court resided, attended with an innumerable multitude of waxen torches, and various instruments of music, in the evening of the Sunday preceding Candlemas-day. In the first rank were forty-eight, habited like esquires, with visors; and in the second the same number, in the character of knights. <Q REND="inline">"Then followed one richly arrayed like an EM∣PEROR, and after him, at some distance, one stately-tyred like a POPE, whom followed twenty-four CARDINALLS, and after them eyght or tenne with blacke visors not amiable, as if they had been LEGATES from some forrain princes."</Q> But this parade was nothing more than a DUMB SHEW, unaccompanied with any kind of interlocution. This appears from what follows. For our chronicler adds, that when they entered the hall of the palace, they were met by the prince, the queen, and the lords; <Q REND="inline">"whom the said mum∣mers did salute, <HI>shewing by a pair of dice their desire to play with the prince,</HI>"</Q> which they managed with so much com∣plaisance and skill, that the prince won of them a bowl, a cup, and a ring of gold, and the queen and lords, each, a ring of gold. Afterwards, having been feasted with a sump∣tuous banquet, they had the honour of dancing with the young prince and the nobility, and so the ceremony was concluded <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stowe's SURV. LOND. pag. 71. edit. 1599. 4to. It will perhaps be said, that this shew was not properly a PAGEANT but a MUMMERY. But these are frivolous distinctions: and, taken in a general view, this account preserves a curious specimen of early PERSONATION, and proves at least that the practice was not then in its infancy.</NOTE>. Matthew Paris informs us, that at the mag∣nificent marriage of Henry the third with Eleanor of Pro∣vence, in the year 1236, certain strange pageants, and won∣derful devises, were displayed in the city of London; and that the number of HISTRIONES on this occasion was infinite <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>I will cite the passage more at large, and in the words of the original. <Q REND="inline">"Con∣venerunt autem vocata ad convivium nuptiale tanta nobilium multitudo utri∣usque sexus, tanta religiosorum nume∣rositas, tanta plebium populositas, tanta HISTRIONUM <HI>Varietas,</HI> quod vix eos civitas Londoniarum sinu suo capaci comprehenderet.

Yet in the Injunctions given by the Barons to the religious houses, in the year 1258, there is an article which seems to shew, that the Histriones were sometimes a <HI>par∣ticular</HI> species of public entertainers. <Q REND="inline">"HISTRIONUM LUDI non <HI>videantur</HI> vel <HI>audiantur,</HI> vel permittantur fieri, coram abbate vel monasticis."</Q> Annal.

<P>I cannot omit the opportunity of adding a striking instance of the extraordinary freedom of speech, permitted to these peo∣ple, at the most solemn celebrities. About the year 1250, king Henry the third, passing some time in France, held a most magnificent feast in the great hall of the knights-templars at Paris; at which, be∣side his own suite, were present the kings of France and Navarre, and all the nobility of France. The walls of the hall were hung all over with shields, among which was that of our king Richard the first. Just before the feast began, a JOCULATOR, or minstrel, accosted king Henry thus. <Q REND="inline">"My lord, why did you invite so many Frenchmen to feast with you in this hall?

Whether this was a preconcerted compliment, previously sug∣gested by the king of France, or not, it is equally a proof of the familiarity with which the minstrels were allowed to address the most eminent personages.</P></NOTE>.

<P>As our thoughts are here incidentally turned to the rudi∣ments of the English stage <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 236. seq.</NOTE>, I must not omit an anecdote, entirely new, with regard to the mode of playing the MYSTERIES at this period, which yet is perhaps of much higher antiquity. In the year 1487, while Henry the seventh kept his residence at the castle at Winchester, on occasion of the birth of prince Arthur, on a sunday, during the time of dinner, he was entertained with a religious drama called CHRISTI DESCENSUS AD INFEROS, or <HI>Christ's descent into hell</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Registr. Priorat. S. Swithin. Winton. MS. ut supr.</NOTE>. It was represented by the PUERI ELEEMOSYNARII, or choir∣boys, of Hyde abbey, and saint Swithin's priory, two large monasteries at Winchester. This is the only proof I have ever seen of choir-boys acting in the old MYSTERIES: nor
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
do I recollect any other instance of a royal dinner, even on a festival, accompanied with this species of diversion <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Except, that on the first Sunday of the magnificent marriage of king James of Scotland with the princess Margaret of England, daughter of Henry the seventh, celebrated at Edinburgh with high splen∣dour, <Q REND="inline">"after dynnar a MORALITE was played by the said master Inglyshe and hys companyons in the presence of the kyng and qwene."</Q> On one of the preceding days, <Q REND="inline">"After soupper the kynge and qwene beyng togader in hyr grett chamber, John Inglysh and his com∣panyons <HI>plaid.</HI>"</Q> This was in the year 1503.

The story of this interlude, in which the chief characters were Christ, Adam, Eve, Abraham, and John the Baptist, was not uncommon in the antient religious drama, and I believe made a part of what is called the LUDUS PASCHALIS, or <HI>Easter Play</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Italians pretend that they have a LUDUS PASCHALIS as old as the twelfth century.

The repre∣sentation is Christ entering hell triumphantly, delivering our first parents, and the most sacred characters of the old and new testaments, from the dominion of Satan, and con∣veying them into Paradise.

The composers of the MYSTERIES did not think the plain and probable events of the new testament sufficiently marvellous for an audience who wanted only to be surprised. They frequent∣ly selected their materials from books which had more of the air of romance. The subject of the MYSTERIES just-men∣tioned was borrowed from the PSEUDO-EVANGELIUM, or the FABULOUS GOSPEL, ascribed to Nicodemus <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In Latin. A Saxon translation, from a manuscript at Cambridge, coeval with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conquest, was printed at Oxford, by T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vaites, 1699.

<P>But whatever was the source of these exhibitions, they were thought to contribute so much to the information and instruction of the people on the most important subjects of religion, that one of the popes granted a pardon of one thousand days to every person who resorted peaceably to the plays performed in the Whitsun week at Chester, beginning with the creation, and ending with the general judgment; and this indulgence was seconded by the bishop of the diocese, who granted forty days of pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on: the pope at the same time denouncing the sentence of damnation on all those incorrigible sinners, who presumed to disturb or interrupt the due celebration of these pious sports <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">MSS.

It is certain that they had their use, not only in teaching the great truths of scripture to men who could not read the bible, but in abolish∣ing the barbarous attachment to military games, and the bloody contentions of the tournament, which had so long prevailed as the sole species of popular amusement. Rude and even ridiculous as they were, they softened the manners of the people, by diverting the public attention to specta∣cles in which the mind was concerned, and by creating a regard for other arts than those of bodily strength and savage valour.</P>

<P>THE only writer deserving the name of a poet in the reign of Henry the seventh, is Stephen Hawes. He was patronised by that monarch, who possessed some tinc∣ture of literature, and is said by Bacon to have confuted a Lollard in a public disputation at Canterbury <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LIFE of HENRY vii. p. 628. edit. ut supr.

<P>Hawes flourished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out the close of the fifteenth century; and was a native of Suffolk <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wood, Ath. Oxon. i. 5.</NOTE>. After an academical education at Oxford, he travelled much in France; and became a com∣plete master of the French and Italian poetry. His polite accomplishments quickly procured him an establishment in the houshold of the king; who struck with the liveliness of his conversation, and because he could repeat by memory most of the old English poets, especially Lydgate, made him groom of the privy chamber <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bale says, that he was called by the king <Q REND="inline">"ab inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ori camera ad privatum cu∣biculum."</Q> Cent. viii.</NOTE>.

[LIFE CH. p. 104. See also Middleton's DIS∣SERT. p. 263.] But no such poem appears in that edition in saint John's college library at Oxford.</P>
<P>The strongest argument which induces me to give this poem to Hawes, and not to Lydgate, is, that it was printed in Hawes's life-time, with his name, by Wyn∣kyn de Worde. Bale also mentions, among Hawes's poems, <HI>Templum Crystallinum</HI> in one book. There is, however, a no less strong argument for giving it to Lydgate, and that is from Hawes himself; who, re∣citing Lydgate's Works, in the PASTIME OF PLEASURE, says thus, [ch. xiv. edit. 1555. Signat. G. iiii. ut infr.]
<Q><L>—And the tyme to passe</L>
<L>Of love <HI>he made the bryght</HI> temple of glasse.</L></Q>
And I must add, that this piece is expressly recited in the large catalogue of Lydgate's works, belonging to W. Thinne, in Speght's edition of Chaucer, printed 1602. fol. 376. Yet on the whole, I think this point still doubtful: and I leave it to be determined by the reader, before whom the evidence on both sides is laid at large.</P></NOTE>. On a comparison, it will be found to

be a copy of the HOUSE OF FAME of CHAUCER, in which that poet sees in a vision a temple of glass, on the walls of which were engraved stories from Virgil's En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id and Ovid's Epistles. It also strongly resembles that part of Chaucer's ASSEMBLY OF FOULES, in which there is the fic∣tion of a temple of brass, built on pillars of jasper, whose walls are painted with the stories of unfortunate lovers <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">V. 290.</NOTE>. And in his ASSEMBLY of LADIES, in a chamber made of beryl and crystal, belonging to the sumptuous castle of <HI>Plea∣saunt Regard,</HI> the walls are decorated with historical sculp∣tures of the same kind <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">V. 451.</NOTE>.

In Chaucer's DREAME, the poet is transported into an island, where <HI>wall and yate was all of glasse</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">V. 72.</NOTE>.

<P>We must acknowledge, that all the picturesque invention which appears in this composition, entirely belongs to Chau∣cer. Yet there was some merit in daring to depart from the dull taste of the times, and in chusing Chaucer for a model, after his sublime fancies had been so long forgotten, and had given place for almost a century, to legends, homilies, and chronicles in verse. In the mean time, there is reason to believe, that Chaucer himself copied these imageries from the romance of GUIGEMAR, one of the metrical TALES, or LAIS, of Bretagne <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 141.

Although, perhaps, Chaucer might not look further than the temples in Boccacio's THESEID for these ornaments. At the same time it is to be remembered, that the imagination of these old poets must have been assisted in this respect, from the mode which antiently prevailed, of entirely covering the walls of the more magnificent apartments, in castles and palaces, with stories from scripture, history, the classics, and romance.

In the year 1277, Otho, duke of Milan, having restored the peace of that city by a signal victory, built a noble castle, in which he ordered every particular circumstance of that victory to be painted. Paulus Jovius relates, that these paintings remained, in the great vaulted chamber of the castle, fresh and unimpaired, so late as the year 1547. <Q REND="inline">"Extantque adhuc in <HI>maximo testudinatoque con∣clavi,</HI> incorruptae praeliorum cum <HI>veris ducum vultibus</HI> ima∣gines, <HI>Latinis elegis</HI> singula rerum elogia indicantibus <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Vit.

With regard to the form of Hawes's poem, I am of opi∣nion, that VISIONS, which are so common in the poetry of the middle ages, partly took their rise from Tully's SOM∣NIUM SCIPIONIS. Had this composition descended to poste∣rity among Tully's six books de REPUBLICA, to the last of which it originally belonged, perhaps it would have been overlooked and neglected <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">But they were extant about the year 1000, for they are cited by Gerbert.

But being preserved, and illus∣trated with a prolix commentary, by Macrobius, it quickly attracted the attention of readers, who were fond of the marvellous, and with whom Macrobius was a more ad∣mired classic than Tully.

<P>If the poems of Rowlie are not genuine, the PASTIME OF PLEASURE is almost the only effort of imagination and invention which had yet appeared in our poetry since Chau∣cer. This poem contains no common touches of romantic and allegoric fiction. The personifications are often happily sustained, and indicate the writer's familiarity with the Pro∣vencial school. The model of his versification and phraseo∣logy is that improved harmony of numbers, and facility of diction, with which his predecessor Lydgate adorned our octave stanza. But Hawes has added new graces to Lydgate's manner. Antony Wood, with the zeal of a true antiquary, laments, that <Q REND="inline">"such is the fate of poetry, that this book, which in the time of Henry the seventh and eighth was
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
taken into the hands of all ingenious men, is now thought but worthy of a ballad-monger's stall!"</Q> The truth is, such is the good fortune of poetry, and such the improvement of taste, that much better books are become fashionable. It must indeed be acknowledged, that this poem has been unjustly neglected: and on that account, an apology will be less necessary for giving the reader a circum∣stantial analysis of its substance and design.</P>
<P>GRAUNDE AMOURE, the hero of the poem, and who speaks in his own person <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">There is something dramatic in this circumstance. Raimond Vidal de Besau∣din, a troubadour of Provence, who flou∣rished about the year 1200, has given the following dramatic form to one of his <HI>contes</HI> or tales. One day, says the troubadour, Alphonsus, king of Castille, whose court was famous for good cheer, magnificence, loyalty, valour, the practice of arms and the management of horses, held a solemn assembly of minstrels and knights. When the hall was quite full, came his queen Eleanor, covered with a veil, and disguised in a close robe bordered with silver, a∣dorned with the blason of a golden lion; who making obeysance, seated herself at some distance from the king. At this in∣stant, a minstrel advancing to the king, addressed him thus. <Q REND="inline">"O king, emperour of valour, I come to supplicate you to give me audience."</Q> The king, under pain of disgrace, ordered that no pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should interrupt the minstrel in what he should say.

At the close, the minstrel humbly requests the king and queen, to banish all jealous husbands from their dominions. The king replied, <Q REND="inline">"MIN∣STREL, your tale is pleasant and gentle, and you shall be rewarded. But to shew you still further how much you have entertained me, I command that hence∣forth your tale shall be called Le JALOUX CHATIE."</Q> Our troubadour's tale is greatly enlivened by these accompaniments, and by being thrown into the mouth of a minstrel.</NOTE>, is represented walking in a deli∣cious meadow. Here he discovers a path which conducts him to a glorious image, both whose hands are stretched out and pointing to two highways; one of which is the path of CONTEMPLATION, the other of ACTIVE LIFE, leading to the Tower of Beauty. He chuses the last-mentioned path, yet is often tempted to turn aside into a variety of bye-paths, which seemed more pleasant: but proceeding directly for∣ward, he sees afar off another image, on whose breast is written, <Q REND="inline">"This is the road to the Tower of DOCTRINE, he that would arrive there must avoid sloth, &amp;c."</Q> The evening

being far advanced, he sits down at the feet of the image, and falls into a profound sleep; when, towards the morning, he is suddenly awakened by the loud blast of a horn.

At the gate of the garden of the castle they are informed by the portress CURTESY, that the lady was sitting alone in an ar∣bour, weaving a garland of various flowers.

From thence he seeks ASTRONOMY, who resides in a gorgeous pavilion pitched in a fragrant and flowery mea∣dow: she delivers a prolix lecture on the several operations of the mind, and parts of the body <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In a wooden cut Ptolomy the astrono∣mer is here introduced, with a quadrant: and Plato, the <HI>conynge and famous clerke,</HI> is cited.</NOTE>.

Going forward, he perceives that this tower stands on a rough precipice of steel, decorated with beasts of various figures. As he advances towards it, he comes to a mighty fortress, at the gate of which were hang∣ing a shield and helmet, with a marvellous horn. He blows the horn with a blast that shook the tower, when a knight appears; who, asking his business, is answered, that his name is Graunde Amoure, and that he was just arrived from the tower of DOCTRINE. He is welcomed by the knight, and admitted. This is the castle of CHIVALRY. The next morning he is conducted by the porter STEDFAST∣NESS into the base court, where stood a tower of prodigious height, made of jasper: on its summit were four images of armed knights on horses of steel, which, on moving a secret spring, could represent a turney.

<HI>chamber precious,</HI> per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umed with the richest odours. Next morning, guided by PERSEVERANCE and COMFORT, he goes forward, and sees a castle, nobly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortified, and walled with jet. Before it was a giant with seven heads, and upon the trees about him were hanging many shields of knights, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had conquered. On his seven heads were seven h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmets crowned with seven streamers, on which were in∣scribed <HI>Dissimulation, Delay, Discomfort, Variance, Envy, De∣traction, Doubleness.</HI> After a bloody battle, he kills the giant, and is saluted by the five ladies STEDFASTNESS, AMOROUS PUR∣VEYANCE, JOY AFTER SORROW, PLEASAUNCE, GOOD REPORT, AMIT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E, CONTINUANCE, all riding from the castle on white pal∣fries. These ladies inform Amoure, that they had been exiled from La Bell Pucell by DISDAINE, and besieged in this castle, for one whole year, by the giant whom he had just slain. They attend him on his journey, and travel through a dreary wilderness, full of wild beasts: at length they discern, at a vast distance, a glorious region, where stood a stately palace beyond a tempestuous ocean. <Q REND="inline">"That, says PERSEVERANCE, is the palace of Pucelle."</Q> They then discover, in the island before them, an horrible fiend, roaring like thunder, and breathing flame, which my author strongly paints,
<Q><L>The fyre was greet, it made the ylande lyght.</L></Q>
PERSEVERANCE tells our hero, that this monster was framed by the two witches STRANGENESS and DISDAINE, to punish La Bell Pucell for having banished them from her presence. His body was composed of the seven metals, and within it a demon was inclosed. They now enter a neighbouring temple of Pallas; who shews Amoure, in a trance, the secret formation of this monster, and gives him a box of wonderful ointment. They walk on the sea-shore, and espy two ladies rowing towards them; who land, and having told Amoure that they are sent by PATIENCE to enquire his

name, receive him and his company into the ship PERFECT∣NESS. They arrive in the island; and Amoure discovers the monster near a rock, whom he now examines more distinct∣ly. The face of the monster resembled a virgin's, and was of gold; his neck of silver; his breast of steel; his fore∣legs, armed with strong talons, of laten; his back of copper; his tail of lead, &amp;c. Amoure, in imitation of Jason, anoints his sword and armour with the unguent of Pallas; which, at the first onset, preserves him from the voluminous tor∣rent of fire and smoke issuing from the monster's mouth. At length he is killed; and from his body flew out a <HI>foule ethiope,</HI> or black spirit, accompanied with such a smoke that all the island was darkened, and loud thunder-claps ensued. When this spirit was entirely vanished, the air grew serene; and our hero now plainly beheld the magnificent castle of La Pucell, walled with silver, and <HI>many a story upon the wall enameled royally</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 217. and vol. i. p. 114. 303.

<P>Here the poem should have ended. But the poet has thought it necessary to extend his allegory to the death and burial of his hero. Graund Amoure having lived in con∣summate happiness with his amiable bride for many years, saw one morning an old man enter his chamber, carrying a staff, with which he strikes Amoure's breast, saying, <HI>Obey,</HI> &amp;c. His name is OLD AGE. Not long after came POLICY or Cunning, and AVARICE. Amoure now begins to aban∣don his triumphal shows and splendid carousals, and to be intent on amassing riches. At last arrived DEATH, who peremptorily denounces, that he must prepare to quit his wealth and the world. After this fatal admonition, came CONTRITION and CONSCIENCE, and he dies. His body is in∣terred by MERCY and CHARITY; and while his epitaph is written by REMEMBRANCE, FAME appears; promising that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he will enroll his name with those of Hector, Joshua,

Sir Thomas Maillorie had now just pub∣lished his MORTE ARTHUR, a narrative digested from various French romances on Arthur's story. Caxton's printed copy of this favourite volume must have been known to our poet Hawes, which appeared in 1485. fol. By the way, in panegyrising Chaucer, Hawes mentions it, as a circum∣stance of distinction, that his works were printed. ch. xiiii.
<Q><L>—Whose name</L>
<L>In PRINTED bokès doth remayne in fame.</L></Q>
This was natural at the beginning of the typographic art. Many of Chaucer's poems were now recently printed by Caxton.</P>
<P>With regard to Millorie's book, much, if not most, of it, I believe, is taken from the great French romance of LANCELOT, translated from Latin into French at the command of one of our Henrys, a me∣trical English version of which is now in Benet library at Cambridge. [See a spe∣cimen in Mr. Naasmith's curious catalogue, p. 54.] I have left it doubtful whether it was the third Henry who ordered this ro∣mance to be translated into Latin, vol. i. p. 115. But, beside the proofs there sug∣gested, in favour of that hypothesis, it ap∣pears, that Henry the third paid great attention to these compositions, from the following curious anecdote just published, which throws new light on that monarch's character.</P>
<P>Arnaud Daniel, a troubadour, highly celebrated by Dante and Petrarch, about the year 1240 made a voyage into England, where, in the court of king Henry the third, he met a minst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who challenged him at <HI>difficult rhymes.</HI> The challenge was accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, a considerable wager was laid, and the rival bards were shut up in separate chambers of the palace. The king, who appears to have much interested him∣self in the dispute, allowed them ten days for <HI>composing,</HI> and five more for <HI>learning to sing,</HI> their respective pieces: after which, each was to exhibit his performance in the presence of his majesty. The third day, the English minstrel announced that he was ready. The troubadour declared he had not wrote a line; but that he had tried, and could not as yet put two words together. The following evening he over∣heard the minstrel practising his <HI>chanson</HI> to himself. The next day he had the good fortune to hear the same again, and learned the air and words. At the day appointed they both appeared before the king. Ar∣naud desired to sing first. The minstrel, in a fit of the greatest surprise and astonish∣ment, suddenly cried out, <HI>C'est ma chanson, This is</HI> MY SONG. The king said it was impossible. The minstrel still insisted upon it; and Arnaud, being closely pressed, ingenuously told the whole affair. The king was much entertained with this ad∣venture; and ordering the wager to be withdrawn, loaded them with rich presents. But he afterwards obliged Arnaud to give a <HI>chanson</HI> of his own composition. Millot, ut supr. tom. ii. p. 491.</P>
<P>In the mean time I would not be under∣stood to deny, that Henry the second en∣couraged these pieces; for it partly ap∣pears, that Gualter Mapes, archdeacon of Oxford, translated, from Latin into French, the popular romance of SAINT GRAAL, at the instance of Henry the second, to whom he was chaplain, about the year 1190. See MSS. Reg. 20 D. iii. a manu∣script perhaps coeval with the translator; and, if so, the original copy presented to the king. Maister Benoit, or Benedict, a rhymer in French, was also patronised by this monarch: at whose command he com∣piled a metrical Chronicle of the DUKES OF NORMANDY: in which are cited Isi∣dore Hispalensis, Pliny, and saint Austin. MSS. Harl. 1717. 1. on vellum. See fol. 85. 192. 163. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.

Though not immediately connected with the present purpose, I cannot resist the temptation of transcribing the remainder of our trouba∣dour's idea of complete happiness in this world. His ambition can be gratified by nothing less than by possessing, <Q REND="inline">"Une si parfaite loyauté, que nul chevalier et nul jongleur n' aient rien à reprendre en lui; une maitresse jeune, jolie, et decente; mille cavaliers bien en ordre pour le suivre par tout, &amp;c."</Q> Millot, HIST.

Aftewards TIME, and ETERNITIE clothed in a white vestment and crowned with a triple diadem of gold, enter the temple, and pronounce an exhortation. Last follows an epilogue, in which the poet apologises for his hardiness in attempting to <HI>feign</HI> and <HI>devise</HI> this fable.</P>
<P>The reader readily perceives, that this poetical apologue is intended to shadow the education of a complete gentle∣man; or rather, to point out those accomplishments which constitute the character of true gallantry, and most justly deserve the reward of beauty. It is not pretended, that the personifications display that force of colouring, and dis∣tinctness of delineation, which animate the ideal portraits of John of Meun. But we must acknowledge, that Hawes has shewn no inconsiderable share of imagination, if not in inventing romantic action, at least in applying and enrich∣ing the general incidents of the Gothic fable. In the crea∣tion of allegoric imagery he has exceeded Lydgate. That he is greatly superior to many of his immediate predecessors and cotemporaries, in harmonious versification, and clear expression, will appear from the following stanza.</P>

<P>Coeval with Hawes was William Walter, a retainer to sir Henry Marney, chancellour of the duchy of Lancaster: an unknown and obscure writer whom I should not have named, but that he versified, in the octave stanza, Boccacio's story, so beautifully paraphrased by Dryden, of Sigismonda and Guiscard.

<P>About the year 1490, Henry Medwall, chaplain to Morton archbishop of Canterbury, composed an interlude, called NATURE, which was afterwards translated into Latin. It is not improbable, that it was played before the archbishop. It was the business of chaplains in great houses to compose in∣terludes for the family.

Barklay's principal work is the SHIP OF FOOLES, above∣mentioned. About the year 1494, Sebastian Brandt, a learned civilian of Basil, and an eminent philologist, pub∣lished a satire in German with this title <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I presume this is the same Sebastian Brandt, to whom Thomas Acuparius, poet laureate, dedicates a volume of Poggius's works, Argentorat. 1513. fol. He is here styled, <Q REND="inline">"Juris utriusque doctor, et. S. P. Q. Argentinensis cancellarius."</Q> The de∣dication is dated 1511. See Hendreich. PANDECT. p. 703.</NOTE>. The design was to ridicule the reigning vices and follies of every rank and profession, under the allegory of a Ship freighted with Fools of all kinds, but without any variety of incident, or artifi∣ciality of fable; yet although the poem is destitute of plot, and the voyage of adventures, a composition of such a nature be∣came extremely popular. It was translated into French <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">By Joce Bade. Paris, 1497.</NOTE>; and, in the year 1497, into tolerable Latin verse, by James Locher, a German, and a scholar of the inventour Brandt <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See THE PROLOGUE.</NOTE>. From the original, and the two translations, Barklay formed a large English poem, in the balade or octave stanza, with considerable additions gleaned from the follies of his coun∣trymen. It was printed by Pinson, in 1509, whose name occurs in the poem.

pictures of familiar manners, and preserve popular cus∣toms. In this light; at least, Barklay's SHIP OF FOOLS, which is a general satire on the times, will be found enter∣taining. Nor must it be denied, that his language is more cultivated than that of many of his cotemporaries, and that he contributed his share to the improvement of the English phraseology.

<P>The TOWRE OF VERTUE AND HONOUR, introduced as a song of one of the shepherds into these pastorals, exhibits no very masterly strokes of a sublime and inventive fancy. It has much of the trite imagery usually applied in the fabrication of these ideal edifices. It, however, shews our author in a new walk of poetry. This magnificent tower, or castle, is built on inaccessible cliffs of flint: the walls are of gold, bright as the sun, and decorated with <HI>olde historyes and pictures manyfolde:</HI> the turrets are beautifully shaped. Among its heroic inhabitants are king Henry the eighth, Howard duke of Norfolk, and the earl of Shrewsbury. LABOUR is the porter at the gate, and VIRTUE governs the house. LABOUR is thus pictured, with some degree of spirit.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Fearfull is LABOUR, without favour at all,</L>
<L>Dreadfull of visage, a monster intractable;</L>
<L>Like Cerberus lying at gates infernall;</L>
<L>To some men his looke is halfe intollerable,</L>
<L>His shoulders large for burden strong and able,</L>
<L>His bodie bristled, his necke mightie and stiffe;</L>

<L>Gainst the Chimere here stoutly must he fight;</L>
<L>Here must he vanquish the fearfull Pegasus,</L>
<L>For the golden flece here must he shewe his might:</L>
<L>If LABOUR gainsay, he can nothing be right:</L>

<L>Sometime an oxe, a bore, or lion wight,</L>

<P>IT is not the plan of this work to comprehend the Scotch poetry. But when I consider the close and national con∣nection between England and Scotland in the progress of manners and literature, I am sensible I should be guilty of a partial and defective representation of the poetry of the former, was I to omit in my series a few Scotch writers, who have adorned the present period, with a degree of sentiment and spirit, a command of phraseology, and a fertility of imagination, not to be found in any English poet since Chaucer and Lydgate: more especially as they have left striking specimens of allegorical invention, a species of com∣position which appears to have been for some time almost totally extinguished in England.</P>
<P>The first I shall mention is William Dunbar, a native of Salton in East Lothian, about the year 1470. His most ce∣lebrated poems are The THISTLE AND THE ROSE, and THE GOLDEN TERGE.</P>
<P>The THISTLE AND THE ROSE was occasioned by the mar∣riage of James the fourth, king of Scotland, with Margaret Tudor, eldest daughter of Henry the seventh, king of England: an event, in which the whole future political state of both nations was vitally interested, and which ultimately produced the union of the two crowns and kingdoms. It was finished on the ninth day of May in the year 1503, nearly three months before the arrival of the queen in Scot∣land: whose progress from Richmond to Edinburgh was attended with a greater magnificence of parade, processions, and spectacles, than I ever remember to have seen on any similar occasion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See a memoir, cited above, in Leland's COLL. tom. iii.

Afterwards the ceremonies of this stately marriage are described; which yet is not equal, in magnificence and expence, to that of Richard the second with Isabell of France, at Calais, in the year 1397. This last-mentioned marriage is recorded with the most minute circumstances, the dresses of the king and the new queen, the names of the French and English nobility who at∣tended, the presents, one of which is a golden cup studded with jewels, and worth three thousand pounds, given on both sides, the banquets, entertainments, and a variety of other curious particulars, in five large vellum pages, in an antient Register of Merton priory in Surrey, in old French.

The poet replies, that the spring of the present year was un∣promising and ungenial; unattended with the usual song of birds, and serenity of sky: and that storms and showers, and the loud blasts of the horn of <HI>lord</HI> Eolus, had usurped her mild dominion, and hitherto prevented him from wandering at leisure under the vernal branches. MAY rejects his ex∣cuse, and with a smile of majesty commands him to arise, and to perform his annual homage to the flowers, the birds, and the sun. They both enter a delicious garden, filled with the richest colours and odours. The sun suddenly appears in all his glory, and is thus described in the luminous lan∣guage of Lydgate.</P>

<P>This is an elegant and ingenious mode of blazoning the Scottish arms, which are a lion with a border, or tressure, adorned with flower de luces. We should remember, that heraldry was now a science of high importance and esteem. NATURE lifting up his <HI>cluvis cleir,</HI> or shining claws, and suffering him to rest on her knee, crowns him with a radiant diadem of precious stones, and creates him the king of beasts: at the same time she injoins him to exercise jus∣tice with mercy, and not to suffer his subjects of the smallest size or degree, to be oppressed by those of superiour strength and dignity. This part of NATURE'S charge to the lion, is closed with the following beautiful stroke, which indicates the moral tenderness of the poet's heart.</P>

<P>She next crowns the eagle king of fowls; and sharpening his talons like darts of steel, orders him to govern great and small, the wren or the peacock, with an uniform and equal impartiality. I need not point out to my reader the politi∣cal lessons couched under these commands. NATURE now calls the flowers; and observing the thistle to be surrounded
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
with a bush of spears, and therefore qualified for war, gives him a crown of rubies, and says, <Q REND="inline">"In field go forth and fend the laif <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Defend the rest.</NOTE>.</Q> The poet continues elegantly to picture other parts of the royal arms; in ordering th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thistle, who is now king of vegetables, to prefer all herbs, or flowers, of rare virtue, and rich odour: nor ever to permit the nettle to associate with the flour de lys, nor any ignoble weed to be ranked in competition with the lily. In the next stanza, where NATURE directs the thistle to honour the rose above all other flowers, exclusive of the heraldic meaning, our author with much address insinuates to king James the fourth an exhortation to conjugal fidelity, drawn from the high birth, beauty, and amiable accomplishments, of the royal bride the princess Margaret <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Among the pageants exhibited at E∣dinburgh in honour of the nuptials, she was complimented with the following cu∣rious mixture of classical and scriptural his∣tory. <Q REND="inline">"Ny to that cross was a scarfawst [scaffold] made, where was represented Paris and the three Deesses, with Mer∣cure that gaff hym the apyll of gold for to gyffe to the most fayre of the Thre, which he gave to Venus.

<P>NATURE then addresses the rose, whom she calls, <Q REND="inline">"O lusty daughter most benyng,"</Q> and whose lineage she exalts above that of the lily. This was a preference of Tudor to Valois.
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
She crowns the rose with <HI>clarefied</HI> gems, the lustre of which illumines all the land. The rose is hailed queen by the flowers. Last, her praises are sung by the universal chorus of birds, the sound of which awakens the poet from his de∣lightful dream. The fairy scene is vanished, and he calls to the muse to perpetuate in verse the wonders of the splendid vision.</P>
<P>Although much fine invention and sublime fabling are displayed in the allegorical visions of our old poets, yet this mode of composition, by dealing only in imaginary per∣sonages, and by excluding real characters and human actions, necessarily fails in that chief source of entertainment which we seek in antient poetry, the representation of antient manners.</P>
<P>Another general observation, immediately resulting from the subject of this poem, may be here added, which illus∣trates the present and future state of the Scotch poetry. The marriage of a princess of England with a king of Scotland, from the new communication and intercourse opened between the two courts and kingdoms by such a connection, must have greatly contributed to polish the rude manners, and to improve the language, literature, and arts, of Scotland.</P>
<P>The design of Dunbar's GOLDEN TERGE, is to shew the gradual and imperceptible influence of love, when too far indulged, over reason. The discerning reader will observe, that the cast of this poem is tinctured with the morality and imagery of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, and the FLOURE AND LEAFE, of Chaucer.</P>
<P>The poet walks forth at the dawn of a bright day. The effects of the rising sun on a vernal landscape, with its ac∣companiments, are thus delineated in the manner of Lyd∣gate, yet with more strength, distinctness, and exuberance of ornament.</P>

harp and lute, invite the ladies to dance. The poet quits his ambush under the trees, and pressing forward to gain a more perfect view of this tempting spectacle, is espied by Venus. She bids her <HI>keen archers</HI> arrest the intruder. Her attendants, a groupe of fair ladies, instantly drop their green mantles, and each discovers a huge bow.

<P>BEAUTY is assisted by <HI>tender</HI> YOUTH with her <HI>virgins ying,</HI> GREEN INNOCENCE, MODESTY, and OBEDIENCE: but their resistance was but feeble against the golden target of REASON.

retreat. Venus, perceiving the rout, orders DISSEMBLANCE to make an attempt to pierce the Golden Shield. DISSEM∣BLANCE, or DISSIMULATION, chuses for her archers, PRE∣SENCE, FAIR CALLING, and CHERISHING. These bring back BEAUTY to the charge. A new and obstinate conflict ensues.</P>

<P>At length PRESENCE, by whom the poet understands that irresistible incentive accruing to the passion of love by society, by being often admitted to the company of the beloved object, throws a magical powder into the eyes of REASON; who is suddenly deprived of all his powers, and reels like a drunken man. Immediately the poet receives a deadly wound, and is taken prisoner by BEAUTY; who now assumes a more engaging air, as the clear eye of REASON is growing dim by intoxication. DISSIMULATION then tries all her arts on the poet: FAIR CALLING smiles upon him: CHERISHING sooths him with soft speeches: NEW ACQUAINTANCE embraces him awhile, but soon takes her leave, and is never seen afterwards. At last DANGER delivers him to the custody of GRIEF.</P>

<P>The concluding stanza is entirely a satire on the high∣landers. Dunbar, as I have already observed, was born in Lothian, a county of the Saxons.

Mahoun, or Mahomet, having a desire to see a highland pageant, a fiend is com∣missioned to fetch Macfadyan; an unmeaning name, chosen for its harshness. As soon as the infernal messenger begins

to publish his summons, he gathers about him a prodigious crowd of <HI>Ersche men;</HI> who soon took up great room in hell.

Dunbar is not less suited to satirical than to sublime allegory: and that he is the first poet who has appeared with any de∣gree of spirit in this way of writing since Pierce Plowman. His THISTLE AND ROSE, and GOLDEN TERGE, are generally and justly mentioned as his capital works: but the natural complexion of his genius is of the moral and didactic cast. The measure of this poem is partly that of Sir THOPAS in Chaucer: and hence we may gather by the way, that Sir THOPAS was antiently viewed in the light of a ludicrous composition. It is certain that the pageants and interludes of Dunbar's age must have quickened his invention to form those grotesque groupes. The exhibition of MORALITIES was now in high vogue among the Scotch. A Morality was played at the marriage of James the fourth and the princess Margaret <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">MEMOIR, ut supr. p. 300.</NOTE>. Mummeries, which they call GYSARTS, com∣posed of moral personifications, are still known in Scotland: and even till the beginning of this century, especially among the festivities of Christmas, itinerant maskers were admitted into the houses of the Scotch nobility.</P>

<P>ANother of the distinguished luminaries, that marked the restoration of letters in Scotland at the commence∣ment of the sixteenth century, not only by a general emi∣nence in elegant erudition, but by a cultivation of the ver∣nacular poetry of his country, is Gawen Douglass. He was descended from a noble family, and born in the year 1475 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hume, HIST. DOUGL. p. 219.</NOTE>. According to the practice of that age, especially in Scotland, his education perhaps commenced in a grammar-school of one of the monasteries: there is undoubted proof, that it was finished at the university of Paris. It is probable, as he was intended for the sacred function, that he was sent to Paris for the purpose of studying the canon law: in consequence of a decree promulged by James the first, which tended in some degree to reform the illiteracy of the clergy, as it in∣joined, that no ecclesiastic of Scotland should be preferred to a prebend of any value without a competent skill in that science <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lesl. REB. GEST. SCOT. Lib. ix.</NOTE>. Among other high promotions in the church, which his very singular accomplishments obtained, he was provost of the collegiate church of saint Giles at Edinburgh, abbot of the opulent convent of Abberbrothrock, and bi∣shop of Dunkeld. He appears also to have been nominated by the queen regent to the archbishoprick, either of Glas∣gow, or of saint Andrew's: but the appointment was re∣pudiated by the pope <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thynne, CONTINUAT. HIST. SCOT. 455.</NOTE>. In the year 1513, to avoid the per∣secutions of the duke of Albany, he fled from Scotland into England, and was most graciously received by king Henry the eighth; who, in consideration of his literary merit, allowed

him a liberal pension <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hollinsh. SCOT. 307.—iii. 872.</NOTE>. In England he contracted a friendship with Polydore Virgil, one of the classical scholars of Henry's court <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bale, xiv. 58.</NOTE>.

But it was projected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o early as the year 1501.

<P>The poetical beauties of this specimen will be relished by every reader who is fond of lively touches of fancy, and rural imagery. But the verses will have another merit with those critics who love to contemplate the progress of com∣position, and to mark the original workings of genuine na∣ture; as they are the effusion of a mind not overlaid by the descriptions of other poets, but operating, by its own force and bias, in the delineation of a vernal landscape, on such objects as really occurred. On this account, they deserve to be better understood: and I have therefore translated them into plain modern English prose. In the mean time, this experiment will serve to prove their native excellence. Di∣vested of poetic numbers and expression, they still retain their poetry; and, to use the comparison of an elegant writer on a like occasion, appear like Ulysses, still a king and conqueror, although disguised like a peasant, and lodged in the cottage of the herdsman Eumaeus.</P>
<Q REND="inline">"Fresh Aurora, the wife of Tithonus, issued from her saffron bed, and ivory house. She was cloathed in a robe of crimson and violet-colour; the cape vermilion, and the border purple: she opened the windows of her ample hall, overspread with roses, and filled with balm, or nard. At the same time, the crystal gates of heaven were thrown open, to illumine the world. The glittering streamers of the orient diffused purple streaks mingled with gold and azure.—The steeds of the sun, in red harness of rubies, of colour brown as the berry, lifted their heads above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sea, to glad our hemisphere: the flames burst f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om their

nostrils:—While shortly, apparelled in his luminous array, Phebus, bearing the blazing torch of day, issued from his royal palace; with a golden crown, glorious visage, curled locks bright as the chrysolite or topaz, and with a radiance intolerable.—The fiery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parks, bursting from his eyes, purged the air, and gilded the new ver∣dure.—The golden vanes of his throne covered the ocean with a glittering glance, and the broad waters were all in a blaze, at the first glimpse of his appearance. It was glorious to see the winds appeased, the sea becalmed, the soft season, the serene firmament, the still air, and the beauty of the watery scene. The silver-scaled fishes, on the gravel, gliding hastily, as it were from the heat or sun, through clear streams, with fins shining brown as cinna∣bar, and chissel-tails, darted here and there. The new lustre, enlightening all the land, beamed on the small pebbles on the sides of rivers, and on the strands, which looked like beryl: while the reflection of the rays played on the banks in variegated gleams; and Flora threw forth her blooms und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the feet of the sun's brilliant horses. The bladed soil was embroidered with various hues. Both wood and forest were darkened with boughs; which, re∣flected from the ground, gave a shadowy lustre to the red rocks. Towers, turrets, battlements, and high pinnacles, of churches, castles, and every fair city, seemed to be painted; and, together with every bastion and story, ex∣pressed their own shape on the plains. The glebe, fearless of the northern blasts, spread her broad bosom.—The corn-crops, and the new-sprung barley, recloathed the earth with a gladsome garment.—The variegated vesture of the valley covered the cloven furrow; and the barley∣lands were diversified with flowery weeds. The meadow was besprinkled with rivulets: and the fresh moisture of the dewy night restored the herbage which the cattle had cropped in the day. The blossoms in the blowing garden

trusted their heads to the protection of the young sun. Rank ivy-leaves overspread the wall of the rampart. The blooming hawthorn cloathed all his thorns in flowers. The budding clusters of the tender grapes hung end-long, by their tendrils, from the trellises. The gems of the trees unlocking, expanded themselves into the foliage of Na∣ture's tapestry. There was a soft verdure after balmy showers. The flowers smiled in various colours on the bending stalks. Some red, &amp;c. Others, watchet, like the blue and wavy sea; speckled with red and white; or, bright as gold. The daisy unbraided her little coronet. The grass stood embattelled, with banewort, &amp;c. The seeded down flew from the dandelion. Young weeds ap∣peared among the leaves of the strawberries. Gay gilli∣flowers, &amp;c. The rose buds, putting forth, offered their <HI>red vernal lips</HI> to be kissed; and diffused fragrance from the crisp scarlet that surrounded their golden seeds. Lilies, with white curling tops, shewed their crests open. The odorous vapour moistened the silver webs that hung from the leaves. The plain was powdered with round dewy pearls. From every bud, scyon, herb, and flower, bathed in liquid fragrance, the bee sucked sweet honey.—The swans clamoured amid the rustling reeds; and search∣ed all the lakes and gray rivers where to build their nests. The red bird of the sun lifted his coral crest, crowing clear among the plants and <HI>rutis gent,</HI> picking his food from every path, and attended by his wives Toppa and Partlet. The painted peacock with gaudy plumes, un∣folded his tail like a bright wheel, inshrouded in his shining feathers, resembling the marks of the hundred eyes of Argus. Among the boughs of the twisted olive, the small birds framed their artful nests, or along the thick hedges, or rejoiced with their merry mates on the tall oaks. In the secret nook, or in the clear windows of glass, the spider full busily wove her sly net, to ensnare

the little gnat or fly. Under the boughs that screen the valley, or within the pale-inclosed park, the nimble deer trooped in ranks, the harts wandered through the thick woody shaws, and the young fawns followed the dap∣pled does. Kids skipped through the briers after the roes; and in the pastures and leas, the lambs, <HI>full tight and trig,</HI> bleated to their dams. Doris and Thetis walked on the salt ocean; and Nymphs and Naiads, wandering by spring∣wells in the grassy groves, plaited lusty chapl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts for their hair, of blooming branches, or of flowers red and white. They sung, and danced, &amp;c.—Meantime, dame Nature's minstrels raise their amorous notes, the ring-dove coo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and pitches on the tall copse, the starling whistles her varied descant, the sparrow chirps in the clefted wall; the goldfinch and linnet filled the skies, the cuckow cried, the quail twittered; while rivers, shaws, and every dale re∣sounded; and the tender branches trembled on the trees, at the song of the birds, and the buzzing of the bees, &amp;c."</Q>

<P>WITH Dunbar and Douglass I join Sir David Lyndesay, although perhaps in strictness he should not be placed so early as the close of the fifteenth century. He appears to have been employed in several offices about the person of James the fifth, from the infancy of that monarch, by whom be was much beloved; and at length, on account of his singular skill in heraldry, a science then in high estimation and among the most polite accomplishments, he was knight∣ed and appointed Lion king of arms of the kingdom of Scotland.

<P>They now arrive at that part of heaven which is called the CHRYSTALLINE <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Most of this philosophy is immediately borrowed from the first chapters of the Nu∣remburgh Chronicle, a celebrated book when Lyndesay wrote, printed in the year 1493. It is there said, that of the water<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above the firmament which were frozen like crystal, God made the crystalline hea∣ven, &amp;c. fol. iv. This idea is taken from GENESIS, i. 4. See also saint Paul, EPIST. COR. ii. xii. 2. The same system is in Tasso, where the archangel Michael de∣scends from heaven, GIER. LIB. C. ix. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. 60. seq. And in Milton, PARAD. L. iii. 481.
<Q><L>They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,</L>
<L>And that crystallin sphere, &amp;c.</L></Q></NOTE>, and are admitted to the <HI>Empyreal,</HI> or heaven of heavens. Here they view the throne of God, sur∣rounded by the nine orders of angels, singing with ineffable harmony <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Because the scriptures have mentioned several degrees of angels, Dionysius the Areopagite, and others, have divided them into nine orders; and those they have re∣duced into three hierarchies. This was a tempting subject for the refining genius of the school-divines: and accordingly we find in Thomas Aquinas a disquisition, <HI>De or∣dinatione Angelorum secundum Hierarchias et Ordines.</HI> QUAEST. cviii. The system, which perhaps makes a better figure in poetry than in philosophy, has been adopted by many poets who did not outlive the influence of the old scholastic sophistry. See Dante, PARAD. C. xxviii. Tasso mentions, among <HI>La grande o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e del ciel,</HI>
<Q><L>TRE FOLTE SQUADRE, et ogni squadra instrutta</L>
<L>In TRE ORDINI gira, &amp;c.</L></Q>
GIER. LIB. xviii. 96. And Spenser speaks of the angels singing in their TRI∣NALL TRIPLICITIES. FAIR. QU. i. xii. 39. And again, in his Hymne of HEA∣VENL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> LOVE. See also Sannazarius, DE PART. VIRGIN. iii. 241. Milton per∣haps is the last poet who has used this popular theory. PARAD. L. v. 748.

Such splendid and sublime imagery has Milton's genius raised on the problems of Thomas Aquinas! See also ibid. v. 600. Hence a passage in his Hymn on THE MORNING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY is to be illustrated. ST. xiii. v. 131.
<Q><L>And with your ninefold harmony</L>
<L>Make up full concert to the angelike sym∣phony.</L></Q>
That is, the symphony of the nine orders of angels was to be answered by the nine∣fold music of the spheres. One Thomas Haywood, a most voluminous dramatic poet in the reign of James the first, wrote a long poem with large notes on this sub∣ject, called THE HIERARCHIE OF AN∣GELS, printed in folio, at London, 1635. See also Jonson's ELEGIE ON MY MUSE, in the UNDERWOOD. p. 260. edit. fol. Lond. 1640.</NOTE>. Next the throne is the Virgin Mary, the queen of

<P>REMEMBRANCE and the poet, leaving heaven, now con∣template the earth, which is divided into three parts. To have mentioned America, recently discovered, would have been heresy in the science of cosmography; as that quarter of the globe did not occur in Pliny and Ptolemy <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">For the benefit of those who are making researches in antient cosmography, I ob∣serve that the map of England, mentioned by Harrison and Hearne, and belonging to Merton college library, appears to have existed at least so early as the year 1512. For in that year, it was lent to the dean of Wells, William Cosyn, with a caution of forty shillings. Registr. Vet. Coll. Mert. fol. 218. b. See its restitution, ibid. fol. 219. b.</NOTE>. The most famous cities are here enumerated. The poet next desires a view of Paradise; that glorious <HI>garth,</HI> or garden, of every flower.

<P>From Paradise a very rapid transition is made to Scotland. Here the poet takes occasion to lament, that in a country so fertile, and filled with inhabitants so ingenious and active, universal poverty, and every national disorder, should a∣bound. It is very probable, that the poem was written solely with a view of introducing this complaint. After an en∣quiry into the causes of these infelicities, which are referred to political mismanagement, and the defective administration of justice, the COMMONWEALTH OF SCOTLAND appears, whose figure is thus delineated.</P>

The reply of SYR COMMONWEALTH to our poet's question, is a long and general satire on the corrupt state of Scotland. The spiritual plelates, he says, have sent away Devotion to the mendicant friars: and are more fond of describing the dishes at a feast, than of explaining the nature of their own establishment.
<Q><L>Sensual Pleasure has banished Chastity.</L></Q>
Liberality, Loyalty, and Knightly Valour, are fled,
<Q><L>And Cowardice with lords is laureate.</L></Q>
From this sketch of Scotland, here given by Lyndesay, under the reign of James the fifth, who acted as a viceroy to France, a Scotch historian might collect many striking fea∣tures of the state of his country during that interesting period, drawn from the life.</P>
<P>The poet then supposes, that REMEMBRANCE conducts him back to the cave on the sea-shore, in which he fell asleep. He is awakened by a ship firing a broadside <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>They spared not the powder nor the <HI>stones.</HI></L></Q>
A proof that stones were now used instead of leaden bullets. At first they shot darts, or <HI>carrieaux, i. e.</HI> quarrels, from great guns. Afterwards stones, which they called <HI>gun-stones.</HI> In the BRUT OF ENGLAND, it is said, that when Henry the fifth, be∣fore Hareflete, received a taunting message from the Dauphine of France, and a ton of tennis-balls by way of contempt, <Q REND="inline">"he anoone lette make tenes balles for the <HI>Dolfin</HI> [Henry's ship] in all the haste that they myght, and they were great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ONNESTONES for the <HI>Dolfin</HI> to playe with alle."</Q> But this game at tennis was too rough for the besieged, when Henry <Q REND="inline">"playede at the tenes with his harde <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ON∣NESTONES, &amp;c."</Q> See Strutt's CUS∣TOMS AND MANNERS OF THE ENGLISH, vol. ii. p. 32. Lond. 1775.</NOTE>. He returns home, and entering his oratory, commits his vision to verse. To this is added an exhortation of ten stanzas to king James the fifth: in which he gives his majesty advice, and censures his numerous instances of misconduct, with incredible boldness and asperity. Most of the addresses to James the fifth, by the Scotch poets, are satires instead of panegyrics.</P>

<P>Lyndesay's poem, called the MONARCHIE, is an account of the most famous monarchies that have flourished in the world: but, like all the Gothic prose-histories, or chronicles, on the same favorite subject, it begins with the creation of the world, and ends with the day of judgment <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In a manuscript at Lambeth [332.] this poem is said to have been begun Jun. 11, 1556.

See more of him in Chaucer's LAMENTAT. MARY MAGD. v. 176. In the Gothic pictures of the Crucifixion, he is represented on horseback, piercing our Saviour's side: and in Xavier's Persic History of Christ, he is called a horseman. This notion arose from his using a spear, or lance: and that weapon, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, undoubtedly gave rise to his ideal name of Longias, or Longinus.

Our poet's principal vouchers and authorities in the MO∣NARCHIE, are Livy, Valerius Maximus, Josephus, Diodorus Siculus, Avicen the Arabic physician, Orosius, saint Jerom, Polydore Virgil, Cario's chronicle, the FASCICULUS TEMPO∣RUM, and the CHRONICA CHRONICARUM. The FASCICULUS TEMPORUM is a Latin chronicle, written at the close of the fifteenth century by Wernerus Rolewinck, a Westphalian, and a Carthusian monk of Cologne; a most venerable volume, closed with this colophon. <Q REND="inline">"FASCICULUS TEMPO∣RUM, a Carthusiense compilatum in formam cronicis figu∣ratum usque in annum 1478, a me Nicolao Gatz de Seltz∣tat impressum <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See it also among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> SCRIPTOR.

Schensperger. 1497. fol.</NOTE>. This was a most popular compi∣lation, and is at present a great curiosity to those who are fond of history in the Gothic style, consisting of wonders conveyed in the black letter and wooden cuts. Cario's chronicle is a much more rational and elegant work: it was originally composed, about the beginning of the sixteenth century, by Ludovicus Cario, an eminent mathematician, and improved or written anew by Melancthon. Of Orosius, a wretched but admired christian historian, who compiled in Latin a series of universal annals from the creation to the fifth century, he cites a translation.

<P>Our author's COMPLAYNT contains a curious picture, like that in his DREME, of the miserable policy by which Scot∣land was governed under James the fifth.

Prophesies of apparent impossibilities were common in Scotland: such as the removal of one place to another.

Compare Buchanan, HIST. lib. xiv. ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.</NOTE>. It was in this reign, that the nobility of Scotland began to frequent the court; which soon became the theatre of all those idle amusements which were calcu∣lated to solicit the attention of a young king. All these abuses are painted in this poem with an honest unreserved indignation. It must not in the mean time be forgotten, that James possessed eminent abilities, and a love of litera∣ture: nor is it beside our present purpose to observe, that he was the author of the celebrated ballad called CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Printed at Oxford, by Edm.

<P>The COMPLAYNT OF THE PAPINGO is a piece of the like tendency. In the Prologue, there is a curious and critical catalogue of the Scotch poets who flourished about the four∣teenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. As the names and works of many of them seem to be totally forgotten, and as it may contribute to throw some new lights on the neglected history of the Scotch poetry, I shall not scruple to give the passage at large, with a few illustrations. Our author declares, that the poets of his own age dare not aspire to the praise of the three English poets, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate. He then, under the same idea, makes a transition to the most distinguished poets, who formerly flourished in Scotland.</P>

<P>The Scotch, from that philosophical and speculative cast which characterises their national genius, were more zealous and early friends to a reformation of religion than their neighbours in England. The pomp and elegance of the ca∣tholic worship made no impression on a people, whose de∣votion sought only for solid edification; and who had no notion that the interposition of the senses could with any propriety be admitted to cooperate in an exercise of such a nature, which appealed to reason alone, and seemed to ex∣clude all aids of the imagination. It was natural that such a people, in their system of spiritual refinement, should warmly prefer the severe and rigid plan of Calvin: and it is from this principle, that we find most of their writers, at the restoration of learning, taking all occasions of censuring
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
the absurdities of popery with an unusual degree of ab∣horrence and asperity.</P>
<P>In the course of the poem before us, an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced, not destitute of in∣vention, humour, and elegance: but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe, who not considering religion as reduced to a civil establishment, and because Christ and his apostles were poor, imagined that secular possessions were in∣consistent with the simplicity of the gospel.</P>
<P>In the primitive and pure ages of christianity, the poet supposes, that the Church married Poverty, whose children were Chastity and Devotion. The emperour Constantine soon afterwards divorced this sober and decent couple; and without obtaining or asking a dispensation, married the Church with great solemnity to Property. Pope Silvester ratified the marriage: and Devotion retired to a hermitage. They had two daughters, Riches and Sensuality; who were very beautiful, and soon attracted such great and universal regard, that they acquired the chief ascendancy in all spiri∣tual affairs. Such was the influence of Sensuality in parti∣cular, that Chastity, the daughter of the Church by Poverty, was exiled: she tried, but in vain, to gain protection in Italy and France. Her success was equally bad in England. She strove to take refuge in the court of Scotland: but they drove her from the court to the clergy. The bishops were alarmed at her appearance, and protested they would harbour no rebel to the See of Rome. They sent her to the nuns, who received her in form, with processions and other honours. But news being immediately dispatched to Sensuality and Riches, of her friendly reception among the nuns, she was again compelled to turn fugitive. She next fled to the mendi∣cant friers, who declared they could not take charge of ladies. At last she was found secreted in the nunnery of the Burrow∣moor near Edinburgh, where she had met her mother Po∣verty and her sister Devotion. Sensuality attempts to besiege

this religious house, but without effect. The pious sisters were armed at all points, and kept an irresistible piece of ar∣tillery, called <HI>Domine custodi nos.</HI></P>

<P>I know not whether this chaste sisterhood had the delicacy to observe strictly the injunctions prescribed to a society of nuns in England; who, to preserve a cool habit, were or∣dered to be regularly blooded three times every year, but not by a secular person, and the priests who performed the ope∣ration were never suffered to be strangers <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MSS.

SC. POEMS, ut supr. p. 256.</NOTE>. What good effects followed from this ecclesiastical censure, I do not find: it is, however, evident<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Scottish act of parliament against <HI>long tails</HI> was as little observed, as that against <HI>muzzling.</HI> Probably the force of the poet's satire effected a more speedy reformation of such abuses, than the menaces of the church, or the laws of the land. But these capricious vanities were not confined to Scotland alone. In England, as we are informed by several an∣tiquaries, the women of quality first wore trains in the reign of Richard the second: a novelty which induced a well
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
meaning divine, of those times, to write a tract <HI>Contra cau∣das dominarum,</HI> against the Tails of the Ladies <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Collectanea Historica, ex DIC∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ION. MS. Thomae Gascoign. Apud Hearne's W. HEMINGFORD, p. 512.</NOTE>. Whether or no this remonstrance operated so far, as to occasion the contrary extreme, and even to have been the distant cause of producing the short petticoats of the present age, I cannot say. As an apology, however, for the English ladies, in adopting this fashion, we should in justice remember, as was the case of the Scotch, that it was countenanced by Anne, Richard's queen: a lady not less enterprising than successful in her attacks on established forms; and whose authority and example were so powerful, as to abolish, even in defiance of France, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afe, commodious, and natural mode of riding on horseback, hitherto practiced by the women of England, and to introduce side-saddles <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chaucer represents his WI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> OF BATH a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> riding with a pair of spurs.

<P>Some readers may perhaps be of opinion, that Makgregor was one of those Scottish lairds, who lived professedly by rapine and pillage: a practice greatly facilitated, and even supported, by the feudal system.

<P>Other parts of Europe, from the same situations in life, afford instances of the same practice. Froissart has left a long narrative of an eminent robber, one Amergot Marcell; who became at length so formidable and powerful, as to claim a place in the history of France. About the year 1380, he had occupied a strong castle for the space of ten years, in the province of Auvergne, in which he lived with the splendor and dominion of a petty sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having amassed, by pillaging the neighbouring country, one hun∣dred thousand francs. His depredations brought in an annual revenue of twenty thousand floreins. Afterwards he
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
is tempted imprudently to sell his castle to one of the gene∣rals of the king for a considerable sum. Froissart introduces Marcell, after having sold his fortress, uttering the following lamentation, which strongly paints his system of depredation, the feudal anarchy, and the trade and travelling of those days. <Q REND="inline">"What a joy was it when we rode forthe at adventure, and somtyme found by the way a ryche priour, or mar∣chaunt, or a route of mulettes, of Montpellyer, of Nar∣bone, of Lymons, of Fongans, of Tholous, or of Car∣cassone, laden with clothe of Brusselles, or peltre ware comynge from the fayres, or laden with spycery from Bruges, from Damas, or from Alysaunder! What∣soever we met, all was ours, or els raunsomed at our pleasures. Dayly we gate newe money; and the vyl∣laynes of Auvergne and of Lymosyn dayly provyded, and brought to our castell, whete mele, breed [bread] ready baken, otes for our horses and lytter, good wynes, beffes, and fatte mottons, pullayne, and wylde foule. We were ever furnyshed, as though we had been kings. Whan we rode forthe, all the country trembled for feare. All was oures, goynge or comynge. Howe toke we Carlaste, I and the Bourge of Companye! and I and Perot of Bernoys toke Caluset. How dyd we scale with lytell ayde the stronge castell of Marquell pertayninge to the erle Dol∣phyn! I kept it not past fyve dayes, but I receyved for it, on a fayre table, fyve thousand frankes; and forgave one thousand, for the love of the erle Dolphyn's chyldren.

<P>But on the whole I am inclined to think, that our testator Makgregor, although a robber, was a personage of high rank, whose power and authority were such, as to require this in∣direct and artificial mode of abuse. For the same reason, I believe the name to be fictitious.</P>

I take this opportunity of observing, that the old Scotch poet Blind Harry belongs to this period; and, at the same time, of correcting the mistake, which, in conformity to the common opinion, and on the evidence of Dempster and Mackenzie, I have committed, in placing him towards the close of the fourteenth century <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 321. Dempster says he lived in 1361.</NOTE>. John Major the Scotch historian, who was born about the year 1470, remembered Blind Harry to have been living, and to have published a poem on the achievements of Sir William Wallace, when he was a boy. He adds, that he cannot vouch for the credibility of those tales which the bards were accustomed to sing for hire in the castles of the nobility <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The poem as now extant has probably been reformed and modernised.</NOTE>. I will give his own words. <Q REND="inline">"Integrum librum Gulielmi Wallacei Henricus, a nativitate luminibus captus, meae infantiae tempore cudit: et quae vulgo dicebantur carmine vulgari, in quo peritus erat, conscripsit.

<P>I cannot return to the English poets without a hint, that a well-executed history of the Scotch poetry from the thirteenth century, would be a valuable accession to the general literary history of Britain. The subject is pregnant with much curious and instructive information, is highly deserving of a minute and regular research, has never yet been uniformly examined in its full extent, and the materials are both accessible and ample. Even the bare lives of the vernacular poets of Scotland
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
have never yet been written with tolerable care; and at present are only known from the meagre outlines of Dempster and Mackenzie. The Scotch appear to have had an early propensity to theatrical representations; and it is probable, that in the prosecution of such a design, among several other interesting and unexpected discoveries, many anecdotes, con∣ducing to illustrate the rise and progress of our ancient drama, might be drawn from obscurity.</P>

<P>MOST of the poems of John Skelton were written in the reign of king Henry the eighth. But as he was laureated at Oxford about the year 1489 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 130.</NOTE>, I consider him as belonging to the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>Skelton, having studied in both our universities, was pro∣moted to the rectory of Diss in Norfolk <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>At least before the year 1507. For at the end of his TRENTALE <HI>for old John Clarke,</HI> there is this colophon. <Q REND="inline">"Auctore Skelton rectore de Dis. Finis, &amp;c.

As his sermons could be no longer a vehicle for his abuse, he vented his ridicule in rhyming libels. At length, daring to attack the dignity of cardinal Wolsey, he was closely pur∣sued by the officers of that powerful minister; and, taking shelter in the sanctuary of Westminster abbey, was kindly

<P>Skelton was patronised by Henry Algernoon Percy, the fifth earl of Northumberland, who deserves particular notice here; as he loved literature at a time when many of the nobility of England could hardly read or write their names, and was the general patron of such genius as his age pro∣duced. He encouraged Skelton, almost the only professed poet of the reign of Henry the seventh, to write an elegy on the death of his father, which is yet extant. But still stronger proofs of his literary turn, especially of his singular passion for poetry, may be collected from a very splendid manuscript, which formerly belonged to this very distin∣guished peer, and is at present preserved in the British Mu∣seum <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">MSS. Reg. 18 D. 11.</NOTE>. It contains a large collection of English poems, elegantly engrossed on vellum, and superbly illuminated, which had been thus sumptuously transcribed for his use. The pieces are chiefly those of Lydgate, after which follow the aforesaid Elegy of Skelton, and some smaller composi∣tions. Among the latter are a metrical history of the family of Percy, presented to him by one of his own chaplains; and a prolix series of poetical inscriptions, which he caused to be written on the walls and ceilings of the principal apartments of his castles of Lekinfield and Wressil <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>See supr. p. 126.

But Skelton hardly deserved such a patronage <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>I am informed by a manuscript note in one of Mr. Oldys's books, that Skel∣ton also wrote a poem called TITUS AND GESIPPUS.

Titus and Gesippus were famous for their friendship; and their history forms an in∣teresting novel in Boccacio, the substance of which is this. Gesippus, falling into poverty, thought himself despised by Titus; and thence growing weary of life, gave out that he was guilty of a murther just com∣mitted. But Titus knowing the true state of the case, and desiring to save the life of his friend by losing his own, charged him∣self with the murther: at which the real murtherer, who stood among the croud at the trial, was so struck, that he confessed the fact. All three are saved; and Titus, to repair the broken fortunes of Gesippus, gives him his sister in marriage, with an ample dower. Bocc. DECAM. Nov. viii. GIORN. x.

<P>It is in vain to apologise for the coarseness, obscenity, and scurrility of Skelton, by saying that his poetry is tinctured with the manners of his age. Skelton would have been a writer without decorum at any period. The manners of Chaucer's age were undoubtedly more rough and unpolished than those of the reign of Henry the seventh. Yet Chaucer, a poet abounding in humour, and often employed in describ∣ing the vices and follies of the world, writes with a degree of delicacy, when compared with Skelton. That Skelton's manner is gross and illiberal, was the opinion of his cotem∣poraries; at least of those critics who lived but a few years afterwards, and while his poems yet continued in vogue. Puttenham, the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, published in the year 1589, speaking of the species of short metre used in the minstrel-romances, for the convenience of being sung to the harp at feasts, and in CAROLS and ROUNDS, <Q REND="inline">"and such other light or lascivious poems which are com∣monly more commodiously uttered by those buffoons or Vices in playes than by any other person,"</Q> and in which the sudden return of the rhyme fatigues the ear, immediately subjoins: <Q REND="inline">"Such were the rimes of Skelton, being indeed but a rude rayling rimer, and all his doings ridiculous; he used both short distaunces and short measures, pleasing only the popular care <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii. ch. ix. p. 69.</NOTE>."</Q> And Meres, in his PALLADIS

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kelton's characteristic vein of humour is capricious and grotesque. If his whimsical extravagancies ever move our laughter, at the same time they shock our sensibility. His festive levities are not only vulgar and indelicate, but fre∣quently want truth and propriety. His subjects are often as ridiculous as his metre: but he sometimes debases his matter by his versification. On the whole, his genius seems better suited to low burlesque, than to liberal and manly satire. It is supposed by Caxton, that he improved our language; but he sometimes affects obscurity, and sometimes adopts the most familiar phraseology of the common people.</P>

<P>These lines are in the best manner of his petty measure: which is made still more disgusting by the repetition of the rhymes. We should observe, that the satire is here pointed at the subject of these tapestries. The graver ecclesiastics, who did not follow the levities of the world, were contented with religious subjects, or such as were merely historical. Rosse of Warwick, who wrote about the year 1460, relates, that he saw in the abbat's hall at saint Alban's abbey a suite of arras, containing a long train of incidents belonging to a most romantic and pathetic story in the life of the Saxon king Offa, which that historian recites at large <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>J.

Among the manuscript EPISTLES of Gilbert de Stone, a canon of Wells, and who flourished about the year 1360, there is a curious passage concerning the spirit for fox-hunting which antiently prevailed among our bishops. Reginald Bryan, bishop of Worcester, in 1352, thus writes to the bishop of saint David's. <Q REND="inline">"Reverende in Christo pater et domine, premissa recommendatione d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bita tanto patri.

He adds, that the foxes, in his manor of Alnechurch, and elsewhere, had killed most of his rabbits, many of his capons, and had destroyed six of his swans in one night. <Q REND="inline">"Veniant ergo, PATER REVERENDE, illae <HI>sex Canicu∣lorum copulae,</HI> et non tardent, &amp;c."</Q> He then describes the very exquisite pleasure he shall receive, in hearing his woods echo with the cry of the hounds, and the music of the horns; and in seeing the trop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of the chace affixed to the walls of his palace.

<P>From a want of the notions of common propriety and decorum, it is amazing to see the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trange absurdities committed by the clergy of the middle ages, in adopting the laical character. Du Cange says, that the deans of many cathedrals in France en∣tered on the dignities habited in a surplice, girt with a sword, in boots and gilt spurs, and a hawk on the fist. LATIN. GLOSS. V. DECANUS, tom. i. p. 1326. See also ibid. p. 79. And tom. ii. p. 179. seq. Carpentier adds, that the treasurers of some churches, particularly that of Nivernois, claimed the privilege of ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting at mass, on whatever festival they pleased, without the canonical vestments, and carrying a hawk. And the lord of Sassay held some of his lands, by placing a hawk on the high altar of the church of Evreux, while his parish priest celebrated the service, booted and spurred, to the beat of drum, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stead of the organ.

It was printed in England as early as the year 1503, by W. de Worde. [See supr. p. 168.] Barklay, in the SHIP OF FOOLES, mentions Alex∣ander's book, which he calls <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>olde</HI> DOCTRINALL with his dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use and un∣per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite brevitie."</Q> fol. 53. b.</NOTE>, has shewn himself not always incapable of exhibiting allegorical imagery with spirit and dignity.

<P>But Skelton most commonly appears to have mistaken his genius, and to write in a forced character, exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt when he is indulging his native vein of satire and jocularity, in the short minstrel-metre abovementioned: which he mars by a multiplied repetition of rhymes, arbitrary abbreviations of the verse, cant expressions, hard and sounding words newly∣coined, and patches of Latin and French. This anomalous and motley mode of versification is, I believe, supposed to be peculiar to our author <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Perhaps formed from Zanni, or Gi∣ovanni, a foolish character on the Italian stage. See Riccoboni, THEATR. ITAL. ch. ii. p. 14. seq.</NOTE>. I am not, however, quite cer∣tain that it originated with Skelton.</P>
<P>About the year 1512, Martin Coccaie of Mantua, whose true name was Theophilo Folengio, a Benedictine monk of Casino in Italy, wrote a poem entitled PHANTASIAE MACA∣RONICAE, divided into twenty-five parts. This is a bur∣lesque Latin poem, in heroic metre, checquered with Italian and Tuscan words, and those of the plebeian character, yet not destitute of prosodical harmony. It is totally satirical, and has some degree of drollery; but the ridicule is too fre∣quently founded on obscene or vulgar ideas.

This sort of spectacle was now so fashionable, that John Rastall, a learned typographer, brother in law to sir Thomas More, extended its province, which had hitherto been confined, either to moral allegory, or to religion blended with buffoonery, and conceived a design of making it the vehicle of science and philosophy. With this view he published, <HI>A new</HI> INTERLUDE <HI>and a mery, of the nature of the iiii Elements, declaringe many proper points of phy∣losophy naturall and dyvers straunge landys,</HI> &amp;c <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Among Mr. Garrick's OLD PLAYS.

It may be doubted, whether Rastall was not the printer only of these pieces. If the printer only, they might come from the festive genius of his brother sir Thomas More.

He was educated at Oxford; and took up the em∣ployment of printing as a profession at that time esteemed liberal, and not unsuit∣able to the character of a learned and in∣genious man.

I have before observed, that the frequent and public ex∣hibition of personifications in the PAGEAUNTS, which an∣tiently accompanied every high festivity, greatly contributed to cherish the spirit of allegorical poetry, and even to enrich the imagination of Spenser <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">And of Shakespeare.

And hence, at the same time, we are led to account for the national relish for allegorical poetry, which so long prevailed among our an∣cestors. By means of these spectacles, ideal beings became common and popular objects: and emblematic imagery, which at present is only contemplated by a few retired readers in the obsolete pages of our elder poets, grew fa∣miliar to the general eye.</P>

<P>IN a work of this general and comprehensive nature, in which the fluctuations of genius are surveyed, and the dawnings or declensions of taste must alike be noticed, it is impossible that every part of the subject can prove equally splendid and interesting. We have, I fear, been toiling for some time through materials, not perhaps of the most agree∣able and edifying nature. But as the mention of that very rude species of our drama, called the MORALITY, has inci∣dentally diverted our attention to the early state of the Eng∣lish stage, I cannot omit so fortunate and seasonable an op∣portunity of endeavouring to relieve the weariness of my reader, by introducing an obvious digression on the probable causes of the rise of the MYSTERIES, which, as I have before remarked, preceded, and at length produced, these allegorical fables. In this respect I shall imitate those map-makers mentioned by Swift, who
<Q><L>—O'er inhospitable downs,</L>

Nor shall I perhaps fail of being pardoned by my reader, if, on the same principle, I should attempt to throw new light on the history of our theatre, by pursuing this enquiry through those deductions which it will naturally and more immediately suggest <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vol. i. p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the eighth century, trade was principally carried on by means of fairs, which lasted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everal days. Charle∣magne established many great marts of this sort in France; as did William the conqueror, and his Norman successors, in
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
England <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 279.</NOTE>. The merchants, who frequented these fairs in numerous caravans or companies, employed every art to draw the people together. They were therefore accompanied by juglers, minstrels, and buffoons; who were no less in∣terested in giving their attendance, and exerting all their skill, on these occasions. As now but few large towns ex∣isted, no public spectacles or popular amusements were esta∣blished; and as the sedentary pleasures of domestic life and private society were yet unknown, the fair-time was the season for diversion. In proportion as these shews were at∣tended and encouraged, they began to be set off with new decorations and improvements: and the arts of buffoonery being rendered still more attractive by extending their circle of exhibition, acquired an importance in the eyes of the people. By degrees the clergy, observing that the entertain∣ments of dancing, music, and mimicry, exhibited at these protracted annual celebrities, made the people less religious, by promoting idleness and a love of festivity, proscribed these sports, and excommunicated the performers. But find∣ing that no regard was paid to their censures, they changed their plan, and determined to take these recreations into their own hands. They turned actors; and instead of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ane mummeries, presented stories taken from legends or the bible. This was the origin of sacred comedy. The death of saint Catharine, acted by the monks of saint Dennis, rivalled the popularity of the professed players. Music was admitted into the churches, which served as theatres for the represen∣tion of holy farces. The festivals among the French, called LA FETE DE FOUX, DE L'ANE <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">For a most full and comprehensive ac∣count of these feasts, see <Q REND="inline">"Memoires pour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervir a l'histoire de la FETE DE FOUX, qui se faisoit autrefois dans plu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieurs eg∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.

These are the ideas of a judicious French writer, now living, who has investigated the history of human man∣ners with great comprehension and sagacity.</P>
<P>Voltaire's theory on this subject is also very ingenious, and quite new. Religious plays, he supposes, came originally from Constantinople; where the old Grecian stage continued to flourish in some degree, and the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides were represented, till the fourth century. About that period, Gregory Nazianzen, an archbishop, a poet, and one of the fathers of the church, banished pagan plays from the stage at Constantinople, and introduced select stories from the old and new Testament. As the antient Greek tragedy was a religious spectacle, a transition was made on the same plan; and the chorusses were turned into Christian hymns <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See supr. vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Gregory wrote many sacred dramas for this purpose, which have not survived those inimitable com∣positions over which they triumphed for a time: one, how∣ever, his tragedy called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or CHRIST'S PASSION, is still extant <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">OP. Greg. Nazianz. tom. ii. p. 253. In a manuscript cited by Lambeccius, it is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. iv. 22. It seems to have been falsely attributed to A∣pollinaris, an Alexandrian, bishop of Lao∣dicea. It is, however, written with les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> elegance and judgement than most of Gre∣gory's poetical pieces. Apollinaris lived about the year 370.</NOTE>. In the prologue it is said to be in imitation of Euripides, and that this is the first time the Virgin Mary has been produced on the stage. The fashion of acting
<PB N="369" REF="375"/>
spiritual dramas, in which at first a due degree of method and decorum was preserved, was at length adopted from Constantinople by the Italians; who framed, in the depth of the dark ages, on this foundation, that barbarous species of theatrical representation called MYSTERIES, or sacred come∣dies, and which were soon afterwards received in France <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. Addit. p. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. This opinion will acquire probability, if we consider the early commercial intercouse between Italy and Con∣stantinople: and although the Italians, at the time when they may be supposed to have imported plays of this nature, did not understand the Greek language, yet they could un∣derstand, and consequently could imitate, what they saw.</P>
<P>In defence of Voltaire's hypothesis it may be further observed, that the FEAST OF FOOLS and of the Ass, with other religious farces of that sort, so common in Europe, originated at Constantinople. They were instituted, although perhaps under other names, in the Greek church, about the year 990, by Theophylact, patriarch of Constantinople, pro∣bably with a better design than is imagined by the ecclesias∣tical annalists; that of weaning the minds of the people from the pagan ceremonies, particularly the Bacchanalian and calendary solemnities, by the substitution of christian spectacles, partaking of the same spirit of licentiousness. The fact is, however, recorded by Cedrenus, one of the By∣zantine historians, who flourished about the year 1050, in the following words. <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="370" REF="376"/><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
"</Q> That is, <Q REND="inline">"Theophylact introduced the prac∣tice, which prevails even to this day, of scandalising god and the memory of his saints, on the most splendid and popular festivals, by indecent and ridiculous songs, and enormous shoutings, even in the midst of those sacred hymns, which we ought to offer to the divine grace with compunction of heart, for the salvation of our souls. But he, having collected a company of base fellows, and placing over them one Euthymius, surnamed Casnes, whom he also appointed the superintendant of his church, ad∣mitted into the sacred service, diabolical dances, exclama∣tions of ribaldry, and ballads borrowed from the streets and brothels <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cedren.

<P>I must however observe here, what perhaps did not imme∣diately occur to our lively philosopher on this occasion, that in the fourth century it was customary to make christian parodies and imitations in Greek, of the best Greek classics, for the use of the christian schools. This practice prevailed much under the emperor Julian, who forbad the pagan poets, orators, and philosophers, to be taught in the christian seminaries<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="371" REF="377"/>
Apollinaris bishop of Laodicea, abovementioned, wrote Greek tragedies, adapted to the stage, on most of the grand events recorded in the old Testament, after the manner of Euripides. On some of the familiar and domestic stories of scripture, he composed comedies in imitation of Menander. He wrote christian odes on the plan of Pindar. In imitation of Homer, he wrote an heroic poem on the history of the bible, as far as the reign of Saul, in twenty-four books <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sozomen (ubi infra) says, that he com∣piled a system of grammar, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, on the christian model.</NOTE>.

<P>But I must not omit a much earlier and more singular specimen of a theatrical representation of sacred history, than this mentioned by Voltaire. Some fragments of an antient Jewish play on the EXODUS, or the Departure of the Israelites from Egypt under their leader and prophet Moses, are yet preserved in Greek iambics <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In Clemens Alexandrin. lib. i. STROM. p. 344. seq. Eusebius, PRAEPARAT. E∣VANG. c. xxviii. xxix. Eustathius ad HEX. p. 25. They are collected, and translated into Latin, with emendations, by Fr. Mo∣rellus, Paris. 1580.

The principal characters of this drama are Moses, Sapphora, and God from the Bush, or God speaking from the burning bush. Moses delivers the prologue, or introduction, in a speech of sixty lines, and his rod is turned into a serpent on the stage. The author
<PB N="372" REF="378"/>
of this piece is Ezekiel, a Jew, who is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the tragic poet of the Jews <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See Scaliger, ad EUSEB. p. 401.</NOTE>. The learned Huetius endeavours to prove, that Ezekiel wrote at least before the christian era <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">DEMOMSTRAT. EVANGELIC. p. 99.</NOTE>. Some suppose that he was one of the seventy, or septuagint, interpreters of the bible under the reign of Ptolomy Philadelphus. I am of opinion, that Ezekiel composed this play after the destruction of Jerusalem, and even in the time of Barocbas, as a political spectacle, with a view to animate his dejected countrymen with the hopes of a future deliverance from their captivity under the conduct of a new Moses, like that from the Egyp∣tian servitude <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Le Moyne, OBS. ad VAR. SACR. tom. i. pag. 336.</NOTE>. Whether a theatre subsisted among the Jews, who by their peculiar situation and circumstances were prevented from keeping pace with their neighbours in the culture of the social and elegant arts, is a curious speculation. It seems most probable, on the whole, that this drama was composed in imitation of the Grecian stage, at the close of the second century, after the Jews had been dispersed, and intermixed with other nations.</P>
<P>Boileau seems to think, that the antient PILGRIMAGES introduced these sacred exhibitions into France.</P>

The pilgrims who returned from Jerusalem, saint James of Compostella, saint Baume of Provence, saint Reine, Mount saint Michael, Notre dame du Puy, and other places esteemed holy, composed songs on their adventures; inter∣mixing recitals of passages in the life of Christ, descriptions of his crucifixion, of the day of judgement, of miracles, and martyrdoms. To these tales, which were recommended by a pathetic chant and a variety of gesticulations, the cre∣dulity of the multitude gave the name of Visions. These pious itinerants travelled in companies; and taking their stations in the most public streets, and singing with their staves in their hands, and their hats and mantles fantastically adorned with shells and emblems painted in various colours, formed a sort of theatrical spectacle. At length their per∣formances excited the charity and compassion of some citi∣zens of Paris; who erected a theatre, in which they might exhibit their religious stories in a more commodious and advantageous manner, with the addition of scenery and other decorations. At length professed practitioners in the histrionic art were hired to perform these solemn mockeries of religion, which soon became the principal public amusement of a devout but undiscerning people.</P>
<P>To those who are accustomed to contemplate the great picture of human follies, which the unpolished ages of Eu∣rope hold up to our view, it will not appear surprising, that the people, who were forbidden to read the events of the sacred history in the bible, in which they were faithfully and beautifully related, should at the same time be permitted to see them represented on the stage, disgraced with the grossest improprieties, corrupted with inventions and additions of
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
the most ridiculous kind, sullied with impurities, and ex∣pressed in the language and gesticulations of the lowest farce.</P>
<P>On the whole, the MYSTERIES appear to have originated among the ecclesiastics; and were most probably first acted, at least with any degree of form, by the monks. This was certainly the case in the English monasteries <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In some regulations given by cardinal Wolsey, to the monasteries of the canons regular of St. Austin, in the year 1519, the brothers are forbidden to be LUSORES <HI>aut</HI> MIMICI, players or mimics.

I have al∣ready mentioned the play of saint Catharine, performed at Dunstable abbey by the novices in the eleventh century, under the superintendence of Geoffry a Parisian ecclesiastic: and the exhibition of the PASSION, by the mendicant friers of Coventry and other places.

Mercury, sent by Diana, speaks the Prologue. In the middle of the third act, the emperor places a crown of laurel on the poet's head: at the conclusion of which ceremony, the chorus sings a panegyric in verse to the emperor. At the close of the fourth act, in the true spirit of a German shew, the imperial butlers re∣fresh the performers with wine out of golden goblets, with a symphony of horns and drums: and at the end of the play, they are invited by his majesty to a sumptuous banquet <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">In the colleges of the Jesuits in Italy this was a constant practice in modern times.

<P>It is more generally known, that the practice of acting Latin plays in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, con∣tinued to Cromwell's usurpation. The oldest notice I can recover of this sort of spectacle in an English university, is in the fragment of an antient accompt-roll of the dissolved college of Michael-house in Cambridge: in which, under the year 1386, the following expence is entered. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pro ly pallio brusdato et pro sex larvis et barbis in comedia.</HI>"</Q> That is, for an embroidered pall, or cloak, and six visors and six beards, for the comedy <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Inter MSS.

This mode of attack was seldom returned by the opposite party: the catholic worship, founded on sensible re∣presentations, afforded a much better hold for ridicule, than the religion of some of sects of the reformers, which was of a more simple and spiritual nature. But I say this of the infancy of our stage. In the next century, fanaticism was brought upon the English stage with great success, when po∣lished manners had introduced humour in∣to comedy, and character had taken place of spectacle. There are, however, two English interludes, one of the reign of Henry the eighth, called EVERY MAN, the other of that of Edward the sixth, call∣ed LUSTY JUVENTUS, written by R.

His sovereignty is to last during the twelve days of Christmas, and he is to exercise the same power on Candlemas-day. During this period, he is to see that six SPECTACLES or DIA∣LOGUES be presented.

the constitution of this officer, in other words, <HI>a Master of the Revels,</HI> gave a latitude to some licentious enormities, incompatible with the decorum of a house of learning and religion; and it was found necessary to restrain these Christ∣mas celebrities to a more rational and sober plan.

I believe these statutes were reformed by queen Elizabeth's visitors of the university of Cambridge, under the conduct of archbishop Parker, in the year 1573.

The queen's observations on the persons of the last men∣tioned piece, deserve notice: as they are at once a curious picture of the romantic pedantry of the times, and of the characteristical turn and predominant propensities of the queen's mind. When the play was over, she summoned the poet into her presence, whom she loaded with thanks and compliments: and at the same time turning to her levee, remarked, that Palamon was so justly drawn as a lover, that he certainly must have been in love indeed: that Arcite was a <HI>right martial knight, having a swart and manly countenance,</HI> yet with the aspect of a Venus clad in armour: that the lovely Emilia was a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unblemished simplicity, and that although she sung so sweetly, and ga∣thered flowers alone in the garden, she preserved her chastity undeflowered.

Indeed, if we consider this monarch's insatiable thirst of profound erudition, we shall not be surprised to find, that he slept at these theatrical performances, and that he sate four hours every morning and afternoon with infinite satisfaction, to hear syllogisms in jurisprudence and theology. The first play, during this solemnity, was a pastoral comedy called ALBA: in which five men, almost naked, appearing on the stage as part of the representation, gave great offence to the queen and the maids of honour: while the king, whose delicacy was not easily shocked at other times, concurred with the ladies, and availing himself of this lucky circumstance, peevishly ex∣pressed his wishes to depart, before the piece was half finish∣ed <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 637.</NOTE>.

Ibid. p. 642. Al∣though the anecdote is foreign to our pur∣pose, I cannot help mentioning the reason, why the queen, during this visit to Oxford, was more pleased to hear the Oration of the professor of Greek, than the king. <Q REND="inline">"The king heard him willingly, and the Queen <HI>much more;</HI> because, she sayd, she <HI>never had h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard Greek.</HI>"</Q> Ibid. 636.</NOTE>.

Notwithstanding these slighting expressions, it is highly probable that this was Inigo Jones, afterwards the famous architect. He was now but thirty-three years of age, and just returned into England. He was the principal Contriver for the masques at Whitehall.

Three youths of the college, habited like witches, advancing towards the king, declared they were the same who once met the two chiefs of Scotland, Macbeth and Bancho; prophesying a kingdom to the one, and to the other a generation of monarchs: that they now appeared, a second time, to his majesty, who was descended from the stock of Bancho, to shew the confirmation of that prediction <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">REX PLATONICUS, five MUSAE RE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣NANTES, Oxon. 1607. 4to. p. 18.</NOTE>.

It would be unnecessary to trace this practice in our uni∣versities to later periods. The position advanced is best illus∣trated by proofs most remote in point of time; which, on that account, are also less obvious, and more curious. I could have added other antient proofs; but I chose to select those which seemed, from concomitant circumstances, most likely to amuse.</P>
<P>Many instances of this practice in schools, or in seminaries of an inferior nature, may be enumerated. I have before mentioned the play of ROBIN and MARIAN, performed, ac∣cording to an annual custom, by the school-boys of Angiers in France, in the year 1392 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Supr. i. 245. See more instances, ibid.</NOTE>. But I do not mean to go abroad for illustrations of this part of our present inquiry. Among the writings of Udal, a celebrated master of Eton, about the year 1540, are recited <HI>Plures Comediae,</HI> and a tragedy <HI>de Papatu,</HI> on the papacy: written probably to be acted by his scholars. An extract from one of his comedies may be seen in Wilson's LOGIKE <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Written in 1553, p. 69.</NOTE>.

usual at the performance of a play. Yet he may sometimes order English plays; such, at least, as are smart and witty. In the year 1538, Ralph Radcliffe, a polite scholar, and a lover of graceful elocution, opening a school at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, obtained a grant of the dissolved friery of the Carmelites in that town: and converting the refectory into a theatre, wrote several plays, both in Latin and English, which were exhibited by his pupils. Among his comedies were <HI>Dives and Lazarus,</HI> Boccacio's <HI>Patient Grisilde, Titus and Gesippus</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 341.</NOTE>, and Chaucer's <HI>Melibeus:</HI> his tragedies were, the <HI>Delivery of Susannah,</HI> the <HI>Burning of John Huss, Job's Sufferings,</HI> the <HI>Burning of Sodom, Jonas,</HI> and the <HI>Fortitude of Judith.</HI> These pieces were seen by the biographer Bale in the author's library, but are now lost <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bale viii. 98.

In the Romish church there was antiently a feast immediately preceding Lent, which lasted many days, called CARNISCAPIUM. See Carpentier, in V. SUPPL. LAT. GL. Du Cang. tom. i. p. 831. In some cities of France an officer was annually chosen, called LE PRINCE D'AMOUREUX, who presided over the sports of the youth for six days before Ash-wednesday. Ibid. V. AMORATUS. p. 195. and V.

<P>In tracing the history of our stage, this early practice of performing plays in schools and universities has never been considered, as a circumstance instrumental to the growth and improvement of the drama. While the people were amused with Skelton's TRIAL OF SIMONY, Bale's GOD'S PROMISES, and CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL, the scholars of the times were composing and acting plays on historical subjects, and in imitation of Plautus and Terence. Hence ideas of a legitimate fable must have been imperceptibly derived to the popular and vernacular drama. And we may add, while no settled or public theatres were known, and plays were chiefly acted by itinerant minstrels in the halls of the nobility at Christmas, these literary societies supported some idea of a
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
stage: they afforded the best accommodations for theatrical exhibition, and were almost the only, certainly the most rational, companies of players that existed.</P>
<P>But I mean yet to trespass on my reader's patience, by pur∣suing this inquiry still further; which, for the sake of com∣prehension and connection, has already exceeded the limits of a digression.</P>
<P>It is perhaps on this principle, that we are to account for plays being acted by singing-boys: although they perhaps acquired a turn for theatrical representation and the specta∣cular arts, from their annual exhibition of the ceremonies of the boy-bishop; which seem to have been common in almost every religious community that was capable of sup∣porting a choir <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>In a small college, for only one provost, five fellows, and six choristers, founded by archbishop Rotheram in 1481, in the obscure village of Rotheram in Yorkshire, this piece of mummery was not omitted.

Brillon, DICTIONAIRE DES ARRETS, Artic. NOYON. edit. de 1727. This privilege, as I have before observed, is permitted to the children of the choir of Winchester college, on that festival, by the founder's statutes, given in 1380. [See supr. vol. i. 248.] Yet in the statutes of Eton college, gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in 1441, and altogether transcribed from those of Winchester, the chorister-bishop of the chapel is permitted to celebrate the holy offices on the feast of saint Nicholas, but <HI>by no means</HI> on that of the INNOCENTS.—<Q REND="inline">"In festo sancti Nicolai, in QUO et NUL∣LATENUS in festo sanctorum INNOCEN∣TIUM, divina officia (praetur Missae Secreta) exequi et dici permittimus per Episcopum Puerorum, ad hoc, de eisdem [pueris choristis] annis singulis eligen∣dum."</Q> STATUT.

In the accompts of Maxtoke priory near Coventry, in the year 1430, it appears, that the eleemosinary boys, or choris∣ters, of that monastery, acted a play, perhaps every year, on the feast of the Purification, in the hall of the neighbouring castle belonging to lord Clinton: and it is specified, that the cellarer took no money for their attendance, because his lordship's minstrels had often assisted this year at several festivals in the refectory of the convent, and in the hall of the prior, without fee or gratuity.

So early as the year 1378, the scholars, or choristers, of saint Paul's cathedral in London, presented a petition to king Richard the second, that his majesty would prohibit some ignorant and unex∣perienced persons from acting the HISTORY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, to the great prejudice of the clergy of the church, who had expended considerable sums for preparing a public presentation of that play at the ensuing Christmas <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e RISE AND PROGRESS, &amp;c.

This is a circumstance in their dramatic history, not commonly known.

Lilly's court-comedies, and many others, were acted by the children of both choirs in conjunction.

<P>To this ecclesiastical origin of the drama, we must refer the plays acted by the society of the parish-clerks of London,
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>
for eight days successively, at Clerkenwell, which thenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> took its name, in the presence of most of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom, in the years 1390, and 1409. In the ignorant ages, the parish-clerks of London might justly be considered as a literary society. It was an essential part of their profession, not only to sing but to read; an accom∣plishment almost solely confined to the clergy: and, on the whole, they seem to come under the character of a religious fraternity. They were incorporated into a guild, or fellow∣ship, by king Henry the third about the year 1240, under the patronage of saint Nicholas. It was antiently customary for men and women of the first quality, ecclesiastics, and others, who were lovers of church-music, to be admitted into this corporation: and they gave large gratuities for the support, or education, of many persons in the practice of that science. Their public feasts, which I have already mentioned, were frequent, and celebrated with singing and music; most commonly at Guildhall chapel or college <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Stowe's SURV. LOND. ut supr. lib. v. p. 231.</NOTE>. Be∣fore the reformation, this society was constantly hired to assist as a choir, at the magnificent funerals of the nobility, or other distinguished personages, which were celebrated within the city of London, or in its neighbourhood. The splendid ceremonies of their anniversary procession and mass, in the year 1554, are thus related by Strype, from an old chronicle. <Q REND="inline">"May the sixth, was a goodly evensong at Guild∣hall college, by the Masters of the CLARKS and their Fel∣lowship, with singing and playing; and the morrow after, was a great mass, at the same place, and by the same fraternity: when every clark offered an halfpenny. The mass was sung by diverse of the queen's [Mary's] chapel and children. And after mass done, every clark went their procession, two and two together; each having on, a sur∣plice and a rich cope, and a garland. And then, fourscore
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
standards, streamers, and banners; and each one that bare them had an albe or a surplice. Then came in order the waits playing: and then, thirty clarkes, sing∣ing FESTA DIES. There were four of these choirs. Then came a canopy, borne over the Sacrament by four of the masters of the clarkes, with staffe torches burning, &amp;c <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">ECCLES. MEM. vol. iii. ch. xiii. p. 121.</NOTE>."</Q> Their profession, employment, and character, naturally dictated to this spiritual brotherhood the representation of plays, especially those of the scriptural kind: and their con∣stant practice in shews, processions, and vocal music, easily accounts for their address in detaining the best company which England afforded in the fourteenth century, at a re∣ligious farce, for more than a week.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this inquiry, a great part of which has been taken up in endeavouring to shew the connection be∣tween places of education and the stage, it ought to be re∣marked, that the antient fashion of acting plays in the inns of court, which may be ranked among seminaries of in∣struction, although for a separate profession, is deducible from this source. The first representation of this sort which occurs on record, and is mentioned with any particular cir∣cumstances, was at Gray's-inn. John Roos, or Roo, student at Gray's-inn, and created a serjeant at law in the year 1511, wrote a comedy which was acted at Christmas in the hall of that society, in the year 1527. This piece, which probably contained some free reflections on the pomp of the clergy, gave such offence to cardinal Wolsey, that the author was degraded and imprisoned <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hollinsh. CHRON. iii. 894.</NOTE>. In the year 1550, under the reign of Edward the sixth, an order was made in the same society, that no comedies, commonly called Interludes, should be acted in the refectory in the intervals of vacation, except at the celebration of Christmas: and that then, the whole body of students should jointly contribute towards the dresses,

In the year 1561, Sackville's and Norton's tragedy of FERREX AND PORREX was presented before queen Elizabeth at Whitehall, by the gentlemen of the Inner Temple <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Printed at London, 1565. 12mo. In one of the old editions of this play, I think a quarto, of 1590, it is said to be <Q REND="inline">"set forth as the same was shewed before the queen's most excellent majestie, in her highness's court of the inner-temple."</Q> It is to be observed, that Norton, one of the authors, was connected with the law: For the <Q REND="inline">"Ap∣probation of Mr. T.

In the year 1566, the SUPPOSES, a comedy, was acted at Gray's-inn, written by Gascoigne, one of the students. Dekker, in his satire against Jonson above cited, accuses Jonson for having stolen some jokes from the Christmas plays of the lawyers. <Q REND="inline">"You shall sweare not to bumbast out a new play with the old lyning of jestes stolne from the Temple-revells <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">SATIROMASTIX, edit. 1602. ut supr.

<P>But these societies seem to have shone most in the repre∣sentation of Masques, a branch of the old drama. So early as the year 1431, it was ordered, that the society of Lin∣coln's inn should celebrate four revels <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">It is not, however, exactly known whe∣ther these revels were not simply DANCES: for Dugdale says, that the students of this inn <Q REND="inline">"anciently had DANCINGS for their <HI>recreation</HI> and delight."</Q> IBID. And he adds, that in the year 1610, the under bar∣risters, <HI>for example's sake,</HI> were put out of commons by decimation, because they <HI>of∣fended</HI> in not DANCING on Candlemas∣day, when the JUDGES <HI>were present,</HI> ac∣cording to an antient order of the society. Ibid. col. 2. In an old comedy, called CUPID'S WHIRLIGIG, acted in the year 1616, by the children of his majesty's revels, a law-student is one of the persons of the drama, who says to a lady, <Q REND="inline">"Faith, lady, I remember the first time I saw you was in quadragessimo-sexto of the queene, in a michaelmas tearme, and I think it was the morrow upon <HI>mense Michaelis,</HI> or <HI>crastino Animarum,</HI> I cannot tell which.

But the most splendid and sumptuous perfor∣mance of this kind, plaid by these societies, was the masque which they exhibited at Candlemas-day, in the year 1633, at the expence of two thousand pounds, before king Charles the first; which so pleased the king, and probably the queen, that he invited one hundred and twenty gentlemen of the law to a similar entertainment at Whitehall on Shrove Tues∣day following <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Dugd. ibid. p. 346.</NOTE>. It was called the TRIUMPH OF PEACE, and written by Shirley, then a student of Gray's-inn.

In this piece, the names, and respective houses, of each mas∣quer are specified; and in commendation of each there is an epigram. The masque with which his majesty returned this com∣pliment on the shrove-tuesday following at Whitehall, was, I think, Carew's COELUM BRITANNICUM, written by the king's command, and played by his majesty, with many of the nobility and their sons who were boys.

<P>After the Restoration, when the dignity of the old monarchical manners had suffered a long eclipse from a Calvinistic usurpa∣tion, a feeble effort was made to revive these liberal and elegant amusements at Whitehall. For about the year 1675, queen Catharine ordered Crowne to write a Pastoral called CALISTO, which was act∣ed at court by the ladies Mary and Anne daughters of the duke of York, and the young nobility. About the same time lady Anne, afterwards queen, plaid the part of Semandra, in Lee's MITHRIDATES. The young noblemen were instructed by Better∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and the princesses by his wife; who perhaps conceived Shakespeare more fully than any female that ever appeared on the stage. In remembrance of her theatrical instructions, Anne, when queen, assigned Mrs. Betterton an annual pension of one hundred pounds. Langb. DRAM. P. p. 92. edit. 1691. Cibber's APOL. p. 134.</P>

<P>In praise of this song it will be sufficient to say, that it re∣minds us of some favorite touches in Milton's COMUS, to which it perhaps gave birth. Indeed one cannot help ob∣serving here in general, although the observation more pro∣perly belongs to another place, that a masque thus recently exhibited on the story of Circe, which there is reason to think had acquired some popularity, suggested to Milton the hint of a masque on the story of Comus. It would be superfluous to point out minutely the absolute similarity of the two cha∣racters: they both deal in incantations conducted by the same mode of operation, and producing effects exactly parallel.</P>
<P>From this practice of performing interludes in the inns of court, we may explain a passage in Shakespeare: but the present establishment of the context embarrasses that expla∣nation, as it perplexes the sentence in other respects. In the SECOND PART OF HENRY THE FOURTH, Shallow is boast∣ing to his cousin Silence of his heroic exploits when he studied the law at Clement's-inn. <Q REND="inline">"I was once of Clement's inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet. <HI>Sil.</HI> You were called <HI>lusty Shallow</HI> then, cousin. <HI>Shal.</HI> I was called any thing, and I would have done any thing, indeed too, and roundly too.

We knew where all the Bona Roba's were, &amp;c.—Oh, the mad days that I have spent <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">ACT iii. SC. iii.</NOTE>!"</Q> Falstaffe then enters, and is recognised by Shallow, as his brother-student at Clement'sinn;
<PB N="404" REF="410"/>
on which, he takes occasion to resume the topic of his juvenile frolics exhibited in London fifty years ago. <Q REND="inline">"She's old, and had Robin Night work, before I came to Cle∣ment's inn.—Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst That that this knight and I have seen! Hah, Sir John, &amp;c."</Q> Fal∣staffe's recruits are next brought forward to be inrolled. One of them is ordered to handle his arms: when Shallow says, still dwelling on the old favorite theme of Clement's∣inn, <Q REND="inline">"He is not his craft-master, he doth not do it right. I remember at Mile-End Green, when I lay at Clement's-inn, I was then Sir Dagonet in ARTHUR'S SHOW, there was a little quiver fellow, and he would manage you his piece thus, &amp;c."</Q> Does he mean, that he acted sir Dagonet at Mile-end Green, or at Clement's-inn? By the application of a parenthesis only, the passage will be cleared from ambiguity, and the sense I would assign will appear to be just. <Q REND="inline">"I re∣member at Mile-end Green, (when I lay at Clement's-inn, I was then Sir Dagonet in ARTHUR'S SHOW,) there was a little quiver fellow, &amp;c."</Q> That is, <Q REND="inline">"I remember, when I was a very young man at Clement's-inn, and not fit to act any higher part than Sir Dagonet in the interludes which we used to play in the society, that among the soldiers who were exercised in Mile-end Green, there was one remark∣able fellow, &amp;c <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the text, "When I <HI>laid</HI> at Clement's inn," i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>lodged,</HI> or <HI>lived.</HI> So Leland. <Q REND="inline">"An old manor place, where in tymes paste sum of the Moulbrays LAY for a starte."</Q> That is LIVED <HI>for a time,</HI> or <HI>sometimes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> ITIN. vol. i. fol. 119.

Just as he had told Silence, a little before, that he saw Schoggan's head broke by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alstaffe at the court-gate,
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="405" REF="411"/>
"and the <HI>very same day,</HI> I did fight with one Sampson Stock∣fish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's-inn."</Q> Not to mention the satire implied in making Shallow act Sir Dagonet, who was King Arthur's Fool. ARTHUR'S SHOW, here supposed to have been presented at Clement's-inn, was probably an in∣terlude, or masque, which actually existed, and was very popular, in Shakespeare's age: and seems to have been com∣piled from Mallory's MORTE ARTHUR, or the history of king Arthur, then recently published, and the favorite and most fashionable romance <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">That Mile-end green was the place for public sports and exercises, we learn from Froissart.

He dined, both in the hall, and in his privy-chamber, under a cloth of estate. The pole-axes for his gentlemen pensioners were borrowed of lord Salisbury.

<P>But these spectacles and entertainments in our law-societies, not so much because they were romantic and ridiculous in their mode of exhibition, as that they were institutions celebrated for the purposes of merriment and festivity, were suppressed or suspended under the false and illiberal ideas of reformation and religion, which prevailed in the fanatical court of Cromwell. The countenance afforded by a polite court to such entertainments, became the leading topic of animadversion and abuse in the miserable declamations of the puritan theologists; who attempted the business of national reformation without any knowledge of the nature of society, and whose censures proceeded not so much from principles of a purer morality, as from a narrowness of mind, and from that ignorance of human affairs which necessarily ac∣companies the operations of enthusiasm.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now arrived at the commencement of the six∣teenth century. But before I proceed to a formal and particular examination of the poetry of that century, and of those that follow, some preliminary considerations of a more general nature, and which will have a reference to all the remaining part of our history, for the purpose of preparing the reader, and facilitating our future inquiries, appear to be necessary.</P>
<P>On a retrospect of the fifteenth century, we find much poetry written during the latter part of that period. It is certain, that the recent introduction into England of the art of typography, to which our countrymen afforded the most liberal encouragement, and which for many years was almost solely confined to the impression of English books, the fashion of translating the classics from French versions, the growing improvements of the English language, and the diffusion of learning among the laity, greatly contributed to multiply English composition, both in prose and verse. These causes, however, were yet immature; nor had they gathered a sufficient degree of power and stability, to ope∣rate on our literature with any vigorous effects.</P>
<P>But there is a circumstance, which, among some others already suggested, impeded that progression in our poetry, which might yet have been expected under all these advan∣tages. A revolution, the most fortunate and important in most other respects, and the most interesting that occur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the history of the migration of letters, now began to take place; which, by diverting the attention of ingenious men to new modes of thinking, and the culture of new lan∣guages, introduced a new course of study, and gave a temporary
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>
check to vernacular composition. This was the re∣vival of classical learning.</P>
<P>In the course of these annals we must have frequently re∣marked, from time to time, striking symptoms of a restless disposition in the human mind to rouse from its lethargic state, and to break the bonds of barbarism. After many imperfect and interrupted efforts, this mighty deliverance, in which the mouldering Gothic fabrics of false religion and false philosophy fell together, was not effectually completed till the close of the fifteenth century. An event, almost for∣tuitous and unexpected, gave a direction to that spirit of curiosity and discovery, which had not yet appeared in its full force and extent, for want of an object. About the year 1453, the dispersion of the Greeks, after Constantinople had been occupied by the Turks, became the means of gratifying that natural love of novelty, which has so fre∣quently led the way to the noblest improvements, by the introduction of a new language and new books<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and totally changed the state of letters in Europe <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">But it should be remembered, that some learned Grecians, foreseeing the persecutions impending over their country, frequented Italy, and taught their language there, be∣fore the taking of Constantinople. Some Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, who attended the Florentine coun∣cil, and never returned for fear of the Turks, founded the present royal library in the city of Turenne. In the year 1401, the Greek emperor, unable to resist the frequent insults of these barbarians, came into England to seek redress or protection from Henry the fourth. He landed at Dover, attended by many learned Greeks; and the next day was honourably received at Christ-church priory at Canterbury, by the prior, Tho∣mas Chyllenden.

<P>This great change commenced in Italy; a country, from many circumstances, above all others peculiarly qualified and prepared to adopt such a deviation. Italy, during the darkest periods of monastic ignorance, had always maintained a greater degree of refinement and knowledge than any other European country. In the thirteenth century, when the manners of Europe appear to have been overwhelmed with every species of absurdity, its luxuries were less savage, and its public spectacles more rational, than those of France,
<PB N="409" REF="415"/>
England, and Germany. Its inhabitants were not only en∣riched, but enlightened, by that flourishing state of com∣merce, which its commodious situation, aided by the com∣bination of other concomitant advantages, contributed to support. Even from the time of the irruptions of the nor∣thern barbarians, some glimmerings of the antient erudition still remained in this country; and in the midst of supersti∣tion and false philosophy, repeated efforts were made in Italy to restore the Roman classics. To mention no other in∣stances, Alberti Mussato<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">He was honoured with the laurel, and died 1329.</NOTE> of Padua, and a commander in the Paduan army against the Veronese, wrote two Latin tragedies, ECERRINIS <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Printed at Venice, 1636. fol. with his EPISTOLAE, ELEGI, SOLILOQUIA, EC∣LOGAE, CENTO OVIDIANUS, Latin His∣tory of Italy, and BAVARUS <HI>ad Filium.</HI> And in Muratori's RER.

And three books in heroic verse, on the War against the Ve∣ronese above-mentioned.

The many monuments of legitimate sculpture and architecture preserved in Italy, had there kept alive ideas of elegance and grace; and the Italians, from their familiarity with those precious remains of antiquity, so early as the close of the fourteenth century, had laid the rudiments of their per∣fection in the antient arts. Another circumstance which had a considerable share in cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring the way for this change, and which deserves particular attention, was the innovation introduced into the Italian poetry by Petrarch: who, inspired with the most elegant of passions, and cloathing his exalted feelings on that delicate subject in the most melodious and brilliant Italian versification, had totally eclipsed the barbarous
<PB N="410" REF="416"/>
beauties of the Provencial troubadours; and by this new and powerful magic, had in an eminent degree contributed to reclaim, at least for a time, the public taste, from a love of Gothic manners and romantic imagery.</P>
<P>In this country, so happily calculated for their favourable reception, the learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugitives of Greece, when their empire was now destroyed, found shelter and protection. Hither they imported, and here they interpreted, their antient writers, which had been preserved entire at Constantinople. These being eagerly studied by the best Italian scholars, com∣municated a taste for the graces of genuine poetry and elo∣quence; and at the same time were instrumental in propa∣gating a more just and general relish for the Roman poets, orators, and historians. In the mean time a more elegant and sublime philosophy was adopted: a philosophy more friendly to works of taste and imagination, and more agree∣able to the sort of reading which was now gaining ground. The scholastic subtleties, and the captious logic of Aristotle, were abolished for the mild and divine wisdom of Plato.</P>
<P>It was a circumstance, which gave the greatest splendour and importance to this new mode of erudition, that it was encouraged by the popes: who, considering the encourage∣ment of literature as a new expedient to establish their au∣thority over the minds of men, and enjoying an opulent and peaceable dominion in the voluptuous region of Italy, extended their patronage on this occasion with a liberality so generous and unreserved, that the court of Rome on a sudden lost its austere character, and became the seat of ele∣gance and urbanity. Nicholas the fifth, about the year 1440, established public rewards at Rome for composition in the learned languages, appointed p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofessors in humanity, and employed intelligent persons to traverse all parts of Europe in search of classic manuscripts buried in the monasteries <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See <Q REND="inline">"Dominei Georgii DISSERTATIO de Nich. quinti erga Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. et Literat.

It was by means of the munificent support of pope Nicholas, that Cyriac of Ancona, who may be considered as the first antiquary in Europe, was enabled to introduce a taste for gems, medals, inscriptions, and other curious remains of classical antiquity, which he collected with indefatigable labour in various parts of Italy and Greece <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Fr.

<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
It is obvious to observe, how little conformable, this just taste, these elegant arts, and these new amusements, proved in their consequences to the spirit of the papal system: and it is remarkable, that the court of Rome, whose sole design and interest it had been for so many centuries, to enslave the minds of men, should be the first to restore the religious and intellectual liberties of Europe. The apostolical fathers, aiming at a fatal and ill-timed popularity, did not reflect, that they were shaking the throne, which they thus adorned.</P>
<P>Among those who distinguished themselves in the exercise of these studies, the first and most numerous were the Italian ecclesiastics. If not from principles of inclination, and a natural impulse to follow the passion of the times, it was at least their interest, to concur in forwarding those improvements, which were commended, countenanced, and authorised, by their spiritual sovereign: they abandoned the pedantries of a barbarous theology, and cultivated the purest models of antiquity. The cardinals and bishops of Italy composed Latin verses, and with a success attained by none in more recent times, in imitation of Lucretius, Catullus, and Virgil. Nor would the encouragement of any other European potentate have availed so much, in this great work of restoring literature: as no other patronage could have operated with so powerful and immediate an influence on that order of men, who, from the nature of their education and profession, must always be the principal instruments in supporting every species of liberal erudition.</P>
<P>And here we cannot but observe the necessary connection between literary composition and the arts of design. No sooner had Italy banished the Gothic style in eloquence and poetry, than painting, sculpture, and architecture, at the same time, and in the same country, arrived at maturity, and appeared in all their original splendour. The beautiful or sublime ideas which the Italian artists had conceived from the contemplation of antient statues and antient temples,
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
were invigorated by the descriptions of Homer and Sopho∣cles. Petrarch was crowned in the capitol, and Raphael was promoted to the dignity of a cardinal.</P>
<P>These improvements were soon received in other countries. Lascaris, one of the most learned of the Constantinopolitan exiles, was invited into France by Lewis the twelfth, and Francis the first: and it was under the latter of these mo∣narch that he was employed to form a library at Fontain∣bleau, and to introduce Greek professors into the university of Paris <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Du Breul, ANTIQUITEZ de Paris, liv. ii. 1639. 4to. p. 563.

This was the same parliament that opposed the reformation of the calen∣dar, and the admission of any other philosophy than that of Aristotle. Such was Francis's sollicitude to encourage the graces of a classical style, that he abolished the Latin tongue from all public acts of justice, because the first president of the parliament of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paris had used a barbarous term in pro∣nouncing sentence <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matagonis de Matagonibus adversus Italogalliam Antonii Matharelli, p. 226.</NOTE>: and because the Latin code and judicial processes, hitherto adopted in France, familiarised the people to a base Latinity.

<P>When we mention the share which Germany took in the res∣titution of letters, she needs no greater panegyric, than that her mechanical genius added, at a lucky moment, to all these fortunate contingencies in favour of science, an admirable invention, which was of the most singular utility in fa∣cilitating the diffusion of the antient writers over every part of Europe: I mean the art of printing. By this observation, I do not mean to insinuate that Germany kept no pace with

her neighbours in the production of philological scholars. Rodolphus Langius, a canon of Munster, and a tolerable Latin poet, after many struggles with the inveterate preju∣dices and authoritative threats of German bishops, and Ger∣man universities, opened a school of humanity at Munster: which supplied his countrymen with every species of elegant learning, till it was overthrown by the fury of fanaticism, and the revolutions introduced by the barbarous reformations of the anabaptistic zealots, in the year 1534 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D.

Soon afterwards he translated Homer, Aristophanes, Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines, and Lucian, into Latin, and Demosthenes into German. At Heidel∣berg he founded a library, which he stored with the choicest Greek manuscripts. It is worthy to remark, that the first public institution in any European university for promoting polite literature, by which I understand these improvements in erudition, appears to have been established at Vienna. In the year 1501, Maximilian the first, who, like Julius Cesar, had composed a commentary on his own illustrious military achievements, founded in the univer∣sity of Vienna a COLLEGE of POETRY. This society con∣sisted of four professors: one for poetry, a second for ora∣tory, and two others for mathematics. The professor of poetry was so styled, because he presided over all the rest: and the first person appointed to this office was Conradus Celtes, one of the restorers of the Greek language in Ger∣many, an elegant Latin poet, a critic on the art of Latin versification, the first poet laureate of his country, and the first who introduced the practice of acting Latin tragedies and

<P>Among the chief restorers of literature in Spain, about 1490, was Antonio de Lebrixa, one of the professors in the university of Alacala, founded by the magnificent cardinal Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo.

In this department, he enriched the seminaries of Spain with new systems of grammar, in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and, with a view to reduce his native tongue under some critical laws, he wrote comparative lexicons, in the Latin, Castilian, and Spanish languages. These, at this time, were

plans of a most extraordinary nature in Spain; and placed the literature of his country, which, from the phlegmatic temper of the inhabitants was tenacious of antient forms, on a much wider basis than before. To these he added a manual of rhetoric, compiled from Aristotle, Tully, and Quintilian: together with commentaries on Terence, Virgil, Juvenal, Persius, and other classics. He was deputed by Ximenes, with other learned linguists, to superintend the grand Complutensian edition of the bible: and in the con∣duct of that laborious work, he did not escape the censure of heretical impiety for exercising his critical skill on the sacred text, according to the ideas of the holy inquisition, with too great a degree of precision and accuracy <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Alvarus Gomesius de VITA XI∣MENIS, lib. ii. pag. 43.

<P>Efforts were made in our English universities for the re∣vival of critical studies, much sooner than is commonly imagined. So early as the year 1439, William Byngham, rector of Saint John Zachary in London, petitioned king Henry the sixth, in favour of his grammar scholars, for whom he had erected a commodious mansion at Cambridge, called GOD'S HOUSE, and which he had given to the college of Clare-hall: to the end, that twenty-four youths, under the direction and government of a learned priest, might be there perpetually educated, and be from thence transmitted, in a constant succession, into different parts of England, to those places where grammar schools had fallen into a state of desolation <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ubi scholae grammaticales existunt de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olatae."

joined, instead of studying the real models of style, were chiefly trained in systematic manuals of these sciences, filled with unprofitable definitions and unnecessary distinctions: and that in learning the arts of elegance, they acquired the barbarous improprieties of diction which those arts were intended to remove and reform. That the foundations I have mentioned did not produce any lasting beneficial effects, and that the technical phraseology of metaphysics and ca∣suistry still continued to prevail at Cambridge, appears from the following anecdote. In the reign of Henry the seventh, that university was so destitute of skill in latinity, that it was obliged to hire an Italian, one Caius Auberinus, for composing the public orations and epistles, whose fee was at the rate of twenty-pence for an epistle <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">MSS.

Undoubtedly the same attention to a futile philosophy, to unintelligible elucidations of Scotus and Aquinas, notwith∣standing the accessions accruing to science from the esta∣blishment of the Humfredian library, had given the same tincture to the ordinary course of studies at Oxford.

But although these gleams of science long struggled with the scholastic cloud which inveloped our universities, we find the culture of the classics embraced in England much sooner than is supposed. Before the year 1490, many of our coun∣trymen appear to have turned their thoughts to the revival of the study of classics: yet, chiefly in consequence of their communications with Italy, and, as most of them were clergymen, of the encouragements they received from the liberality of the Roman pontiffs <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Such of our countrymen as wrote in Latin at this period, and were entirely educated at home without any connections with Italy, wrote a style not more classical than that of the monkish latin annalists who flourished two or three centuries before. I will instance only in Ross of Warwick, au∣thor of the HISTORIA REGUM ANGLIAE, educated at Oxford, an ecclesiastic, and esteemed an eminent scholar. Nor is the plan of Ross's History, which was finished so late as the year 1483, less barbarous than his latinity; for in writing a chroni∣cle of the kings of England, he begins, according to the constant practice of the monks, with the creation and the first ages of the world, and adopts all their legends and fables. His motives for undertaking this work are exceedingly curious. He is speaking of the method of perpetuating the memories of famous men by statues: <Q REND="inline">"Al∣so in our churches, tabernacles in stone∣work, or niches, are wrought for con∣taining images of this kind.

<P>Yet this practice was encouraged by some of our bishops, who had received their edu∣cation in English universities. Pace, one of our learned countrymen, a friend of Erasmus, was placed for education in gram∣mar and music in the family of Thomas Langton, bishop of Winchester; who kept a domestic school within the precincts of his palace, for training boys in these sci∣ences. <Q REND="inline">"Humaniores literas (says my author) tanti estimabat, ut domestica schola pueros ac juvenes ibi erudien∣dos curavit, &amp;c."</Q> The bishop, who took the greatest pleasure in examining his scholars every evening, observing that young Pace was an extraordinary proficient in music, thought him capable of better things; and sent him, while yet a boy, to the university of Padua. He afterwards studied at Bononia: for the same bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Will, bequeaths to his <HI>scholar,</HI> Richard Pace, studying at Bononia, an exhibition of ten pounds annually for seven years.

<P>With regard to what has been here said concerning the practice of educating boys in the families of our bishops, it appears that Grosthead, bishop of Lincoln in the thirteenth century, educated in this manner most of the nobility in the kingdom, who were placed there in the character of pages: <Q REND="inline">"Filios Nobilium procerum regni, quos secum habuit DOMICELLOS."</Q> Joh. de Athona. in CONSTIT.

<P>It is obvious to remark the popularity which must have accrued to these politer studies, while they thus paved the way to the most opulent and honourable promotions in the church: and the authority and estimation with which they must have been surrounded, in being thus cultivated by the most venerable ecclesiastics. It is indeed true, that the dig∣nified clergy of the early and darker ages were learned be∣yond the level of the people <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>The inferiour clergy were in the mean time extremely ignorant.

short compass shews Becket's private ideas concerning the bigottries and superstitious absurdities of his religion. The writer gives an account of a dinner in Becket's palace; at which was present, among many other prelates, a Cistercian abbot. This abbot engrossed almost the whole conversation, in relating the miracles performed by Robert, the founder of his order. Becket heard him for some time with a patient contempt; and at length could not help breaking out with no small degree of indignation, <HI>And these are your miracles!</HI></P>
<P>We must however view the liberal ideas of these enligh∣tened dignitaries of the twelfth century under some restric∣tions. It must be acknowledged, that their literature was clogged with pedantry, and depressed by the narrow notions of the times. Their writings shew, that they knew not how to imitate the beauties of the antient classics. Exulting in an exclusive privilege, the certainly did not see the solid and popular use of these studies: at least they did not chuse, or would not venture, to communicate them to the people, who on the other hand were not prepared to receive them. Any attempts of that kind, for want of assistances which did not then exist, must have been premature; and these lights were too feeble to dissipate the universal darkness. The writers who first appeared after Rome was ravaged by the Goths, such as Boethius, Prudentius, Orosius, Fortu∣natius, and Sedulius, and who naturally, from that circum∣stance, and because they were Christians, came into vogue at that period, still continued in the hands of common readers, and superseded the great originals. In the early ages of Christianity a strange opinion prevailed, in conformity to which Arnobius composed his celebrated book against the gentile superstitions, that pagan authors were calculated to corrupt the pure theology of the gospel. The prejudice however remained, when even the suspicions of the danger were removed. But I return to the progress of modern letters in the fifteenth century.</P>

<P>SOON after the year 1500, Lillye, the famous gram∣marian, who had learned Greek at Rhodes, and had afterwards acquired a polished Latinity at Rome, under Jo∣hannes Sulpicius and Pomponius Sabinus, became the first teacher of Greek at any public school in England. This was at saint Paul's school in London, then newly established by dean Colet, and celebrated by Erasmus; and of which Lillye, as one of the most exact and accomplished scholars of his age, was appointed the first master <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Knight, LIFE of Colet, p. 19.

And that an∣tient prejudices were now gradually wearing off, and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of compo∣sition began to be diffused, appears from this circumstance alone: that from the year one thousand five hundred and three to the reformation, there were more grammar schools, most of which at present are perhaps of little use and im∣portance, founded and endowed in England, than had been for three hundred years before. The practice of educating our youth in the monasteries growing into disuse, near twenty new grammar schools were established within this period: and among these, Wolsey's school at Ipswich, which soon fell a sacrifice to the resentment or the avari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Henry the eighth, deserves particular notice, as it rivalled those of Winchester and Eton. To give splendor to the institution<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

beside the scholars, it consisted of a dean, twelve canons, and a numerous choir <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Tanner, NOTIT. MON. p. 520.</NOTE>. So attached was Wolsey to the new modes of instruction, that he did not think it inconsistent with his high office and rank, to publish a general address to the schoolmasters of England, in which he orders them to institute their youth in the most elegant literature <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Elegantissima literatura."</Q> Fiddes's WOLSEY. COLL. p. 105.</NOTE>. It is to be wished that all his edicts had been employed to so liberal and useful a purpose. There is an anecdote on record, which strongly marks Wolsey's character in this point of view. Notwithstanding his habits of pomp, he once condescended to be a spectator of a Latin tragedy of DIDO, from Virgil, acted by the scholars of saint Paul's school, and written by John Rightwise, the master, an eminent grammarian <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Wood, Ath. Oxon. i. 15. See what is said of this practice, supr. p. 386.</NOTE>. But Wolsey might have pleaded the authority of pope Leo the tenth, who more than once had been present at one of these classical spectacles.</P>
<P>It does not however appear, that the cardinal's liberal sen∣timents were in general adopted by his brother prelates. At the foundation of saint Paul's school above-mentioned, one of the bishops, eminent for his wisdom and gravity, at a public assembly, severely censured Colet the founder for suffering the Latin poets to be taught in the new structure, which he ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore styled a house of pagan idolatry <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Episcopum quendam, et eum qui habetur a SAPIENTIORIBUS, in magno hominum Conventu, nostram scholam blasphemasse, dixisseque, me erexisse rem inutilem, imo malam, imo etiam, ut illius verbis utar, <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um Idololatri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> [Coletus Erasmo.

<P>In the year 1517, Fox, bishop of Winchester, founded a college at Oxford, in which he constituted, with competent stipends, two professors for the Greek and Latin languages <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">STATUT.

this philological establishment may justly be looked upon, as the first conspicuous instance of an attempt to depart from the narrow plan of education, which had hitherto been held sacred in the universities of England. The course of the Latin professor, who is expressly directed to extirpate BAR∣BARISM from the new society <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Lector seu professor artium huma∣niorum ... BARBARIEM a nostro al∣veario exstirpet."</Q> STATUT. ut supr.</NOTE>, is not confined to the private limits of the college, but open to the students of Oxford in general. The Greek lecturer is ordered to explain the best Greek classics: and the poets, historians, and orators, in that language, which the judicious founder, who seems of have consulted the most intelligent scholars of the times, re∣commends by name on this occasion, are the purest, and such as are most esteemed even in the present improved state of antient learning. And it is at the same time worthy of remark, that this liberal prelate, in forming his plan of study, does not appoint a philosophy-lecturer in his college, as had been the constant practice in most of the previous foundations: perhaps suspecting, that such an endowment would not have coincided with his new course of erudition, and would have only served to encourage that species of doctrine, which had so long choaked the paths of science, and obstructed the progress of useful knowledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>These happy beginnings in favour of new and a rational system of academical education, were seconded by the aus∣picious munificence of cardinal Wolsey. About the year 1519, he founded a public chair at Oxford, for rhetoric and humanity, and soon afterwards another for teaching the Greek language; endowing both with ample salaries <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Wood, HIST.

the year 1524, king Henry the eighth, who destroyed or ad∣vanced literary institutions from caprice, called Robert Wakefield, originally a student of Cambridge, but now a professor of humanity at Tubingen in Germany, into Eng∣land, that one of his own subjects, a linguist of so much celebrity, might no longer teach the Greek and oriental lan∣guages abroad: and when Wakefield appeared before the king, his majesty lamented, in the strongest expressions of concern, the total ignorance of his clergy and the univer∣sities in the learned tongues; and immediately assigned him a competent stipend for opening a lecture at Cambridge, in this necessary and neglected department of letters <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Wakefield's ORATIO DE LAUDIBUS TRIUM LINGUARUM, &amp;c.

Wake∣field was afterwards a preserver of many copies of the Greek classics, in the havock of the religious houses. It is record∣ed by Fox, the martyrologist, as a memorable occurrence <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">ACT.

It may seem at first surprising, that Fox, a weak and prejudiced writer, should allow any merit to a catholic: but Barnes afterwards appears to have been one of Fox's martyrs, and was executed at the stake in Smithfield for a defence of Lutheranism.</P>
<P>But these innovations in the system of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the friends of the old scholastic circle of sciences, and the bigotted partisans of the catholic communion, who stigmatised the Greek language by the name of heresy. Even bishop Fox, when he founded the

Greek lecture abovementioned, that he might not appear to countenance a dangerous novelty, was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the venerable mantle of the au∣thority of the church. For as a seeming apology for what he had done, he refers to a canonical decree of pope Clement the fifth, promulged in the year 1311, at Vienne in Dau∣phine, which enjoined, that professors of Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, should be instituted in the universities of Ox∣ford, Paris, Bononia, Salamanca, and in the cout of Rome <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Quem praeter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a in nostro Alveario collocavimus, quod SACROSANCTI CA∣NONES commodissime pro bonis literis, et imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imis christianis, instituerunt ac jusserunt, cum in ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> universitate Ox∣oniensi, perinde ac paucis aliis celeber∣rimis gymnasiis, nunquam desiderari."</Q> STATUT.

<P>The university of Oxford was rent into factions on ac∣count of these bold attempts; and the advocates of the recent improvements, when the gentler weapons of persuasion could not prevail, often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the schools. But the facetious disposition of

Even the public diversions of the court took a tincture from this growing attention to the languages, and assumed a classical air. We have before seen, that a comedy of Plau∣tus was acted at the royal palace of Greenwich in the year 1520. And when the French ambassadors with a most splendid suite of the French nobility were in England for the ratification of peace in the year 1514, amid the most magnificent banquets, tournaments, and masques, exhibited at the same palace, they were entertained with a Latin in∣terlude; or, to use the words of a cotemporary writer, with such an <Q REND="inline">"excellent Interlude made in Latin, that I never heard the like; the actors apparel being so gorgious, and of such strange devices, that it passes my capacitie to relate them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, MEM.

<P>Nor was the protection of king Henry the eighth, who notwithstanding he had attacked the opinions of Luther, yet, from his natural liveliness of temper and a love of novelty, thought favourably of the new improvements, of inconsider∣able influence in supporting the restoration of the Greek language. In 1519, a preacher at the public church of the university of Oxford, harangued with much violence, and in the true spirit of the antient orthodoxy, against the doc∣trines inculcated by the new professors: and his arguments were canvassed among the students with the greatest ani∣mosity. But Henry, being resident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodstock, and having received a just detail of the merits of this dispute from Pace and More, interposed his uncontrovertible authority; and transmitting a royal mandate to the university, commanded that the study of the scriptures in their original languages should not only be permitted for the future, but received as a branch of the academical institution <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Erasm. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IST. 380. tom. iii.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards, one of the king's
<PB N="440" REF="446"/>
chaplains preaching at court, took an opportunity to cen∣sure the genuine interpretations of the scriptures, which the Grecian learning had introduced. The king, when the ser∣mon was ended, to which he had listened with a smile of contempt, ordered a solemn disputation to be held, in his own presence: at which the unfortunate preacher opposed, and sir Thomas More, with his usual dexterity, defended, the utility and excellence of the Greek language. The divine, who at least was a good courtier, instead of vindi∣cating his opinion, instantly fell on his knees, and begged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit before his majesty. However, after some slight altercation, the preacher, by way of making some sort of concession in form, ingenu∣ously declared, that he was now better reconciled to the Greek tongue, because it was derived from the Hebrew. The king, astonished at his ridiculous ignorance, dismissed the chaplain, with a charge, that he should never again presume to preach at court <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408.</NOTE>. In the grammatical schools established in all the new cathedral foundations of this king, a master is appointed, with the uncommon qualification of a compe∣tent skill in both the learned languages <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Statuimus praeterea, ut per Decanum, etc. unus [Archididascalus] <Q REND="inline">"eligatur, Latine et <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI> doctus, bonae famae, &amp;c."</Q> STATUT.

It is remarkable, that Wolsey does not order Greek to be taught in his school at Ipswich, founded 1528. See Strype, ECCL. MEM. i. Append. xxxv. p. 94. seq.</NOTE>. In the year 1523, Ludovicus Viv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, having dedicated his commentary on Austin's DE CIVITATE DEI to Henry the eighth, was invited into England, and read lectures at Oxford in jurisprudence and humanity; which were countenanced by the presence, not only of Henry, but of queen Catharine and some of the principal nobility <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Twyne, APOL. lib. ii. §. 210. seq. Probaby he was patronised by Catharine as a Spaniard.</NOTE>. At length antient absurdities universally gave way to these encouragements. Even the vernacular language
<PB N="441" REF="447"/>
began to be cultivated by the more ingenious clergy. Colet, dean of saint Paul's, a divine of profound learning, with a view to adorn and improve the style of his discourses, and to acquire the graces of an elegant preacher, employed much time in reading Gower, Chaucer, and Lydgate, and other English poets, whose compositions had embellished the popular diction <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Erasm. EPISTOL. Jodoco Jonae. Ibid. Jun. 1521.</NOTE>. The practice of frequenting Italy, for the purpose of acquiring the last polish to a Latin style both in eloquence and poetry, still continued in vogue; and was greatly promoted by the connections, authority, and good taste, of cardinal Pole, who constantly resided at the court of Rome in a high character. At Oxford, in particular, these united endeavours for establishing a new course of liberal and manly science, were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolsey's college, to which all the accomplished scholars of every country in Europe were in∣vited; and for whose library, transcripts of all the valuable manuscripts which now fill the Vatican, were designed <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wood, HIST. UNIV. OXON, i. 249.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the progress of these prosperous beginnings was soon obstructed. The first obstacle I shall mention, was, indeed, but of short duration. It was however an unfavourable cir∣cumstance, that in the midst of this career of science, Henry, who had ever been accustomed to gratify his passions at any rate, sued for a divorce against his queen Catharine. The legality of this violent measure being agitated with much deliberation and solemnity, wholly engrossed the at∣tention of many able philologists, whose genius and acqui∣sitions were destined to a much nobler employment; and tended to revive for a time the frivolous subtleties of casuistry and theology.</P>
<P>But another cause which suspended the progression of these letters, of much more importance and extent, ultimately most
<PB N="442" REF="448"/>
happy in its consequences, remains to be mentioned. The en∣larged conceptions acquired by the study of the Greek and Roman writers seem to have restored to the human mind a free exertion of its native operations, and to have communicated a certain spirit of enterprise in examining every subject: and at length to have released the intellectual capacity of man∣kind from that habitual subjection, and that servility to system, which had hitherto prevented it from advancing any new principle, or adopting any new opinion. Hence, under the concurrent assistance of a preparation of circumstances, all centering in the same period, arose the reformation of religion. But this defection from the catholic communion, alienated the thoughts of the learned from those pursuits by which it was produced; and diverted the studies of the most accom∣plished scholars, to inquiries into the practices and maxims of the primitive ages, the nature of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the authority of scripture and tradition, of popes, councils, and schoolmen: topics, which men were not yet qualified to treat with any degree of penetration, and on which the ideas of the times unenlightened by phi∣losophy, or warped by prejudice and passion, were not cal∣culated to throw just and rational illustrations. When the bonds of spiritual unity were once broken, this separation from an established faith ended in a variety of subordinate sects, each of which called forth its respective champions into the field of religious contention. The several princes of christendom were politically concerned in these disputes; and the courts in which poets and orators had been recently caressed and rewarded, were now filled with that most de∣plorable species of philosophers, polemical metaphysicians. The public entry of Luther into Worms, when he had been summoned before the diet of that city, was equally splendid with that of the emperor Charles the fifth <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Luther, Op. ii. 412. 414.</NOTE>. Rome in return,

roused from her deep repose of ten centuries, was compelled to vindicate her insulted doctrines with reasoning and argument. The profound investigations of Aquinas once more triumphed over the graces of the Ciceronian urbanity; and endless volumes were written on the expediency of auricular confession, and the existence of purgatory. Thus the cause of polite literature was for awhile abandoned; while the noblest abilities of Europe were wasted in theological specu∣lation, and absorbed in the abyss of controversy. Yet it must not be forgotten, that wit and raillery, drawn from the sources of elegant erudition, were sometimes applied, and with the greatest success, in this important dispute. The lively colloquies of Erasmus, which exposed the super∣stitious practices of the papists, with much humour, and in pure Latinity, made more protestants than the ten tomes of John Calvin. A work of ridicule was now a new attempt: and it should be here observed, to the honour of Erasmus, that he was the first of the literary reformers who tried that species of composition, at least with any degree of po∣pularity. The polite scholars of Italy had no notion that the German theologists were capable of making their readers laugh: they were now convinced of their mistake, and soon found that the German pleasantry prepared the way for a revolution, which proved of the most serious consequence to Italy.</P>
<P>Another great temporary che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k given to the general state of letters in England at this period, was the dissolution of the monasteries. Many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages. In the beginnings of refor∣mation, the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly: while the benefit arising from the change is the slow effect of time, and not immediately perceived or en∣joyed. Scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the interests of mankind than the monastic. Yet these seminaries, although they were in a general view the nurseries

of illiterate indolence, and undoubtedly deserved to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uppressed under proper restrictions, contained invitations and opportunities to studious leisure and literary pursuits. On this event therefore, a visible revolution and decline in the national state of learning succeeded. Most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments, the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and reward. By the aboli∣tion of the religious houses, many towns and their adjacent villages were utterly deprived of their only means of in∣struction.

<P>Before we quit the reign of Henry the eighth, in this re∣view of the rise of modern letters, let us turn our eyes once more on the universities; which yet do not always give the tone to the learning of a nation <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It ought not here to be unnoticed, that the royal library of the kings of England, originally subsisting in the old palace at Westminster, and lately transferred to the British Museum, received great improve∣ments under the reign of Henry the eighth; who constituted that elegant and judicious scholar, John Leland, his librarian, about the year 1530. Tanner, BIBL. pag. 475. Leland, at the dissolution of the monaste∣ries, removed to this royal repository a great number of valuable manuscripts; particu∣larly from saint Austin's abbey at Canter∣bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.

See also SCRIPT. BRIT. ut supra, V. ATHEL∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TANUS. Leland says, that he placed in the PALATINE library of Henry the eighth the COMMENTARII IN MATTHAEUM of Claudius, Bede's disciple. Ibid. V. CLAU∣DIUS. Many of the manuscripts of this library appear to have belonged to Henry's predecessors; and if we may judge from the splendour of the decorations, were pre∣sents. Some of them bear the name of Humphrey duke of Glocester. Others were written at the command of Edward the fourth. I have already mentioned the li∣brarian of Henry the seventh. Bartholo∣mew Traheron, a learned divine, was ap∣pointed the keeper of this library by Ed∣ward the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixth, with a salary of twenty marcs, in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>49.

Under the reign of Eli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abeth, Hentzner, a German traveller, who saw this library at Whitehall in 1598, says, that it was well furnished with Greek, La∣tin, Italian, and French books, all bound in velvet of different colours, yet chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; and that the covers of some were adorned with pearls and precious stones.

It must be allowed, that James the first greatly en∣riched this library with the books of lord Lumley and Casaubon, and sir Thomas Roe's manuscripts brought from Constanti∣nople. Lord Lumley's chiefly consisted of lord Arundel's, his father in law, a great collector at the dissolution of monasteries.

In the year 1535, the king ordered lectures in humanity, institutions which have their use for a time, and while the novelty lasts, to be founded in those colleges of the university, where they were yet wanting: and these injunctions were so warmly approved by the scholars in the largest societies, that they seized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus and other irrefragable logicians, in which they had so long toiled without the at∣tainment of knowledge, and tearing them in pieces, dis∣persed them in great triumph about their quadrangles, or gave them away as useless lumber <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Layton's letter to Cromwell.

<P>As all novelties are pursued to excess, and the most bene∣ficial improvements often introduce new inconveniencies, so this universal attention to polite literature destroyed philosophy.

The old philosophy was abolished, but a new one was not adopted in its stead. At Cambridge we now how∣ever find the antient scientific learning in some degree re∣formed, by the admission of better systems.</P>
<P>In the injunctions given by Henry to that university in the year 1535, for the reformation of study, the dialectics of Rodolphus Agricola, the great favorite of Erasmus, and the genuine logic of Aristotle, are prescribed to be taught, instead of the barren problems of Scotus and Burlaeus <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Collier, ECCLES. HIST. vol. ii. p. 110.</NOTE>. By the same edict, theology and causuistry were freed from many of their old incumbrances and perplexities: degrees in the canon law were forbidden; and heavy penalties were imposed on those academics, who relinquished the sacred text, to explain the tedious and unedifying commentaries on Peter Lombard's scholastic cyclopede of divinity, called the SENTENCES, which alone were sufficient to constitute a mo∣derate library. Classical lectures were also directed, the study of words was enforced, and the books of Melancthon, and other solid and elegant writers of the reformed party, recommended. The politer studies, soon afterwards, seem to have risen into a flourishing state at Cambridge. Bishop Latimer complains, that there were now but few who studied divinity in that university <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">SERMONS, &amp;c. p. 63. Lond. 1584. 4to.

But this is no proof of a decline of learning in that seminary. Other pursuits were now gaining ground there; and such as in fact were subser∣vient to theological truth, and to the propagation of the reformed religion.

The

Greek language was now making considerable advances at Cambridge, under the instruction of Cheke and Smith; notwithstanding the interruptions and opposition of bishop Gardiner, the chancellor of the university, who loved learn∣ing but hated novelties, about the proprieties of pronunci∣ation.

<P>It is generally believed, that the reformation of religion in England, the most happy and important event of our annals, was immediately succeeded by a flourishing state of letters. But this was by no means the case. For a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was pro∣duced. The reformation in England was completed under the reign of Edward the sixth. The rapacious courtiers of this young prince were perpetually grasping at the rewards of literature; which being discouraged or despised by the rich, was neglected by those of moderate fortunes. Avarice and zeal were at once gratified in robbing the clergy of their revenues, and in reducing the church to its primitive apos∣tolical state of purity and poverty <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Collier's ECCL. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ST. Records, lxvii. p. 80.</NOTE>. The opulent see of Winchester was lowered to a bare title: its amplest estates were portioned out to the laity; and the bishop, a creature of the protector Somerset, was contented to receive an in∣considerable annual stipend from the exchequer. The bi∣shoprick of Durham, almost equally rich, was entirely dis∣solved.

The ministers of this abused monarch, by these arbitrary, dishonest, and imprudent measures, only provided instruments, and furnished arguments, for restoring in the succeeding reign that superstitious religion, which they professed to destroy.

Absurd refinements, concerning the inutility of human learning, were superadded to the just and rational purgation of christianity from the papal cor∣ruptions.

<P>I must not, however, forget, as a remarkable symptom of an attempt now circulating to give a more general and unreserved diffusion of science, that in this reign, Thomas Wilson, originally a fellow of King's college in Cambridge, preceptor to Charles and Henry Brandon dukes of Suffolk, dean of Durham, and chief secretary to the king, published a system a rhetoric and of logic, in English <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">First printed in the reign of Edward the sixth.

<P>It is with reluctance I enter on the bloody reign of the relentless and unamiable Mary; whose many dreadful mar∣tyrdoms of men eminent for learning and piety, shock our sensibility with a double degree of horrour, in the present softened state of manners, at a period of society when no po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entate would inflict executions of so severe a nature, and when it would be difficult to find devotees hardy enough to die for difference of opinion. We must, however, acknow∣ledge, that she enriched both universities with some consi∣derable benefactions: yet these donations seem to have been made, not from any general or libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al principle of advancing knowledge, but to repair the breaches of reformation, and to strengthen the return of superstition. It is certain, that her restoration of popery, together with the monastic insti∣tution, its proper appendage, must have been highly perni∣cious to the growth of polite erudition. Yet although the elegant studies were now beginning to suffer a new relapse, in the midst of this reign, under the discouragement of all these inauspicious and unfriendly circumstances, a college was established at Oxford, in the constitution of which, the founder principally inculcates the use and necessity of classical literature; and recommends it as the most important and leading object in that system of academical study, which he prescribes to the youth of the new society <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">In the year 1554.</NOTE>.

In the beginning of the reign of queen Elisabeth, which soon followed, when the return of protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better, puritanism began to prevail; and, as the first fervours of a new sect are always violent, retarded for some time the pro∣gress of ingenuous and useful knowledge. The scriptures being translated into English, and every man assuming a right to dictate in matters of faith, and to chuse his own principles, weak heads drew false conclusions, and erected an infinite variety of petty religions. Such is the abuse which attends the best designs, that the meanest reader of the new Testament thought he had a full comprehension of the most mysterious metaphysical doctrines in the christian faith; and scorned to acquiesce in the sober and rational ex∣positions of such difficult subjects, which he might have re∣ceived from a competent and intelligent teacher, whom it was his duty to follow. The bulk of the people, who now possessed the means of discussing all theological topics, from their situation and circumstances in life, were naturally averse to the splendor, the dominion, and the opulence of an hierarchy, and disclaimed the yoke of episcopal juris∣diction. The new deliverance from the numerous and bur∣thensome superstitions of the papal communion, drove many pious reformers into the contrary extreme, and the rage of opposition ended in a devotion entirely spiritual and abstract∣ed. External forms were abolished, as impediments to the visionary reveries of a mental intercourse with heaven; and because the church of Rome had carried ceremonies to an absurd excess, the use of any ceremonies was deemed un∣lawful. The love of new doctrines and a new worship, the triumph of gaining proselytes, and the persecutions which accompanied these licentious zealots, all contributed to fan the flame of enthusiasm. The genius of this refined and false species of religion, which defied the salutary checks of all human authority, when operating in its full force,
<PB N="458" REF="464"/>
was attended with consequences not less pernicious to society, although less likely to last, than those which flowed from the establishment of the antient superstitions. During this unsettled state of things, the English reformed clergy who had fled into Germany from the menaces of queen Mary, returned home in great numbers: and in considera∣tion of their sufferings and learning, and their abilities to vindicate the principles of a national church erected in op∣position to that of Rome, many of them were preferred to bishopricks, and other eminent ecclesiastical stations. These divines brought back with them into England those narrow principles concerning church-government and ceremonies, which they had imbibed in the petty states and republics abroad, where the Calvinistic discipline was adopted, and where they had lived like a society of philosophers; but which were totally inconsistent with the nature of a more extended church, established in a great and magnificent nation, and requiring an uniform system of policy, a regular subordination of officers, a solemnity of public worship, and an observance of exterior institutions. They were, how∣ever, in the present circumstances, thought to be the most proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiasti∣cal affairs; not only for the purpose of vindicating the new establishment by argument and authority, but of eradica∣ting every trace of the papal corruptions by their practice and example, and of effectually fixing the reformation em∣braced by the church of England on a durable basis. But, unfortunately, this measure, specious and expedient as it appeared at first, tended to destroy that constitution which it was designed to support, and to counteract those prin∣ciples which had been implanted by Cranmer in the reform∣ed system of our religion. Their reluctance or refusal to con∣form, in a variety of instances, to the established ceremonies, and their refinements in theological discipline, filled the church with the most violent divisions; and introduced endless
<PB N="459" REF="465"/>
intricate disputations, not on fundamental doctrines of solid importance to the real interests of christianity, but on positive points of idle and empty speculation, which ad∣mitting no elegance of composition, and calling forth no vigour of abilities, exercised the learning of the clergy in the most barbarous and barren field of controversial divinity, and obstructed every pursuit of polite or manly erudition. Even the conforming clergy, from their want of penetration, and from their attachment to authorities, contributed to protract these frivolous and unbecoming controversies: for if, in their vindication of the sacerdotal vestments, and of the cross of baptism, instead of arguing from the jews, the primitive christians, the fathers, councils, and customs, they had only appealed to common sense and the nature of things, the propriety and expediency of those formalities would have been much more easily and more clearly demon∣strated. To these inconveniencies we must add, that the common ecclesiastical preferments were so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropriations, in the late depredations of the church, and which continued to be carried on with the same spirit of rapacity in the reign of Elisabeth, that few persons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence, almost any that offered themselves were, without distinction or examination, admitted to the sacred function. Insomuch, that in the year 1560, an injunction was directed to the bishop of London from his metropolitan, requiring him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other illi∣terate persons who exercised secular occupations <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype's GRINDAL. B. i. ch. iv. b. 40.</NOTE>. But as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil was unavoidable, this caution took but little effect <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Numerous illuminated artificers began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arly to preach and write in defence of the reformed religion. The first mechanic who left his lawful calling to vindicate the cause of the catholics, was one Miles Hoggard, a shoe-maker or hosier, of London; who, in the reign of queen Mary, wrote a pamphlet entitled, <HI>The Displaying o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ants, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ondry their practices,</HI> &amp;c.

He was likewise an English poet; and I am glad of this opportunity of men∣tioning him in that character, as I could not have ventured to give him a place in the series of our poetry. He wrote the MIRROUR of LOVE, Lond. 1555. 4to. Dedicated to queen Mary.

<PB N="460" REF="466"/>
About the year 1563, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere were only two divines, and those of higher rank, the president of Magdalen college <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Doctor Lawrence Humphreys, men∣tioned in the last note. Of whom it will not be improper to observe further in this place, that about the year 1553, he wrote an <HI>Epistola de Grecis literis et Homeri lectione et imitatione ad praesidem et socios collegii Magdalenae, Oxon.</HI> In the CORNUCOPIA of Hadrian Junius, Basil. 1558. fol.</NOTE>, and the dean of Christ Church, who were capable of preaching the public sermons before the university of Oxford <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wood, ut supr. i. 285.</NOTE>. I will mention one instance of the extreme ignorance of our infe∣riour clergy about the middle of the sixteenth century. In the year 1570, Horne, bishop of Winchester, enjoined the minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory, every week, one chapter of saint Paul's epistles in Latin: and this for∣midable task, almost beneath the abilities of an ordinary school-boy, was actually repeated by some of them, before the bishop, dean, and prebendaries, at a public episcopal visitation of that church <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Registr. Horne, Episc. Winton. fol. 80. b.</NOTE>. It is well known that a set of homilies was published to supply their incapacity in com∣posing sermons: but it should be remembered, that one reason for prescribing this authorised system of doctrine, was to prevent preachers from disturbing the peace of the church by disseminating their own novel and indigested opinions.</P>
<P>The taste for Latin composition in the reign of Elisabeth, notwithstanding it was fashionable both to write and speak in that language, was much worse than in the reign of Henry the eighth, when juster models were studied, and when the novelty of classical literature excited a general emulation to imitate the Roman authors. The Latinity of Ascham's prose has little elegance. The versification and phraseology of
<PB N="461" REF="467"/>
Buchanan's Latin poetry are splendid and sonorous, but not marked with the chaste graces and simple ornaments of the Augustan age. One is surprised to find the learned arch∣bishop Grindal, in the statutes of a school which he founded, and amply endowed, recommending such barbarous and de∣generate classics as Palingenius, Sedulius, and Prudentius, to be taught in his new foundation <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype's GRINDAL. B. ii. ch. xvii. p. 312. This was in iu 1583.</NOTE>. These, indeed, were the classics of a reforming bishop: but the well-meaning prelate would have contributed much more to the success of his intended reformation, by directing books of better taste and less piety. That classical literature, and the public insti∣tution of youth, were now in the lowest state, we may collect from a provision in archbishop Parker's foundation of three scholarships at Cambridge, in the year 1567. He orders that the scholars, who are appointed to be elected from three the most considerable schools in Kent and Nor∣folk, shall be <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>best</HI> and <HI>aptest</HI> schollers, well instructed in the grammar, and, <HI>if it may be,</HI> such as <HI>can make a verse</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Blomefield's NORFOLK, ii. 224.</NOTE>."</Q> It became fashionable in this reign to study Greek at court. The maids of honour indulged their ideas of sentimental affection in the sublime contemplations of Plato's Phaedo: and the queen, who understood Greek better than the canons of Windsor, and was certainly a much greater pedant than her successor James the first, translated Isocrates <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ascham's SCHOLEMASTER, p. 19. b. edit. 1589. Aud EPISTOL. lib. i. p. 19. ut supr.</NOTE>. But this passion for the Greek language soon ended where it began: nor do we find that it improved the national taste, or in∣fluenced the writings, of the age of Elisabeth.</P>
<P>All changes of rooted establishments, especially of a na∣tional religion, are attended with shocks and convulsions, unpropitious to the repose science and study. But these unavoidable inconveniencies last not long. When the liberal genius of protestantism had perfected its work, and the first
<PB N="462" REF="468"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anaticisms of well-meaning but misguided zealot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had sub∣sided, every species of useful and elegant knowledge recovered its strength, and arose with new vigour. Acquisitions, whether in theology or humanity, were no longer exclusively confined to the clergy: the laity eagerly embraced those pursuits from which they had long been unjustly restrained: and, soon after the reign of Elisabeth, men attained that state of general improvement, and those situations with respect to literature and life, in which they have ever since persevered.</P>
<P>But it remains to bring home, and to apply, this change in the sentiments of mankind, to our main subject. The customs, institutions, traditions, and religion, of the middle ages, were favorable to poetry. Their pageaunts, processions, spectacles, and ceremonies, were friendly to imagery, to personification and allegory. Ignorance and superstition, so opposite to the real interests of human society, are the parents of imagina∣tion. The very devotion of the Gothic times was romantic. The catholic worship, besides that its numerous exteriour appendages were of a picturesque and even of a poetical na∣ture, disposed the mind to a state of deception, and encou∣raged, or rather authorised, every species of credulity: its visions, miracles, and legends, propagated a general pro∣pensity to the Marvellous, and strengthened the belief of spectres, demons, witches, and incantations. These illusions were heightened by churches of a wonderful mechanism, and constructed on such principles of inexplicable archi∣tecture as had a tendency to impress the soul with every false sensation of religious fear. The savage pomp and the capricious heroism of the baronial manners, were replete with incident, adventure, and enterprise: and the intractable genius of the feudal policy, held forth those irregularities of conduct, discordancies of interest, and dissimilarities of situation, that framed rich materials for the minstrel-muse. The tacit compact of fashion, which promotes civility by
<PB N="463" REF="469"/>
diffusing habits of uniformity, and therefore destroys pecu∣liarities of character and situation, had not yet operated upon life: nor had domestic convenience abolished unwieldy magnificence. Literature, and a better sense of things, not only banished these barbarities, but superseded the mode of composition which was formed upon them. Romantic poetry gave way to the force of reason and inquiry; as its own inchanted palaces and gardens instantaneously vanished, when the christian champion displayed the shield of truth, and baffled the charm of the necromancer. The study of the classics, together with a colder magic and a tamer my∣thology, introduced method into composition: and the uni∣versal ambition of rivalling those new patterns of excellence, the faultless models of Greece and Rome, produced that bane of invention, IMITATION. Erudition was made to act upon genius. Fancy was weakened by reflection and philosophy. The fashion of treating every thing scientifically, applied speculation and theory to the arts of writing. Judgment was advanced above imagination, and rules of criticism were established. The brave eccentricities of original genius, and the daring hardiness of native thought, were intimidated by metaphysical sentiments of perfection and refinement. Setting aside the consideration of the more solid advantages, which are obvious, and are not the distinct object of our contemplation at present, the lover of true poetry will ask, what have we gained by this revolution? It may be an∣swered, much good sense, good taste, and good criticism. But, in the mean time, we have lost a set of manners, and a system of machinery, more suitable to the purposes of poetry, than those which have been adopted in their place. We have parted with extravagancies that are above propriety, with incredibilities that are more acceptable than truth, and with fictions that are more valuable than reality.</P>

<P>The reader will observe the constant return of the hemistichal point, which I have been careful to preserve, and to represent with exactness; as I suspect, that it shews how these poems were sung to the harp by the minstrels. Every line was per∣haps uniformly recited to the same monotonous modulation, with

a pause in a midst: just as we chant the psalms in our choral service. In the psalms of our liturgy, this pause is expressed by a colon: and often, in those of the Roman missal, by an aste∣risc.

Muratori, in further proof of this point, quotes the above passage from Hoveden; which, as I had done, he misapplies to our king Richard the first. But, in either sense, it equally suits his argument. In the year 1334, at a feast on Easter Sunday, celebrated at Rimini, on occa∣sion of some noble Italians receiving the honour of knight∣hood, more than one thousand five hundred HISTRIONES are said to have attended. <Q REND="inline">"Triumphus quidem maximus fuit ibidem, &amp;c.—Fuit etiam multitudo HISTRIONUM circa mille quingentos et ultra."</Q> ANNAL.

speaking of king Richard, has founded a theory, which is con∣sequently false, and is otherwise but imaginary. See p. 66. 67. 69. 74. He supposes, that Richard, in consequence of his connection with Raimond count of Tholouse, encouraged the heresy of the Albigenses; and that therefore the historian Hove∣den, as an ecclesiastic, was interested in abusing Richard, and in in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuating, that his reputation for poetry rested only on the venal praises of the French minstrels. The words quoted are, indeed, written by a churchman, although not by Hoveden. But whatever invidious turn they bear, they belong, as we have seen, to quite another person; to a bishop who justly deserved such an indirect stroke of satire, for his criminal enormities, not for any vain pretensions to the character of a Provencial songster.</P>

<P>After this latter extract, which is to be found nearly in the middle of the manuscript, the scene and personages of the poem are changed; and king Enalach, king Mordrens, Sir Nesciens, Joseph of Arimathea, and the other heroes of the former part, give place to king Arthur, king Brangors, king Loth, and the monarchs and champions of the British line. In a paragraph, very similar to the second of these ex∣tracts, the following note is written in the hand of the text, <HI>Henry Lonelich Skynner, that translated this boke out of Frenshe into Englyshe, at the instaunce of Harry Barton.</HI></P>
<P>The QUEST OF THE SANGREAL, as it is called, in which devotion and necromancy are equally concerned, makes a con∣siderable part of king Arthur's romantic history, and was one grand object of the knights of the Round Table. He who achieved this hazardous adventure was to be placed there in the <HI>siege perillous,</HI> or <HI>seat</HI> of <HI>danger.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"When Merlyn had or∣dayned the rounde table, he said, by them that be fellowes of the rounde table the truthe of the SANGREALL shall be well knowne, &amp;c.—They which heard Merlyn say soe, said thus to Merlyn, sithence there shall be such a knight, thou shouldest ordayne by thy craft a siege that no man should sitte therein, but he onlie which shall passe all other knights.—Then Merlyn made the siege perillous, &amp;c."</Q> Caxton's MORT D'ARTHUR, B. xiv. cap. ii. Sir Lancelot, <HI>who is come but of the eighth degree from our lord Jesus Christ,</HI> is represented as the chief adventurer in this honourable expedition. Ibid. B. iii. c. 35. At a celebration of the feast of Pentecost at Camelot by king Arthur, the Sangreal suddenly enters the hall, <Q REND="inline">"but there was no man might see it nor who bare it,"</Q> and the knights, as by some invisible power, are instantly supplied with

a feast of the choicest dishes. Ibid. c. 35. Originally LE BRUT, LANCELOT, TRISTAN, and the SAINT GREAL were separate histories; but they were so connected and confounded before the year 1200, that the same title became applicable to all. The book of the SANGREAL, a separate work, is referred to in MORTE ARTHUR. <Q REND="inline">"Now after that the quest of the SANCGREALL was fulfylled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that all the knyghtes that were lefte alive were come agayne to the Rounde Table, as the BOOKE OF THE SANCGREALL makethe mencion, than was there grete joye in the courte.

Ambry,</HI> in this sense, is not an uncommon old Eng∣lish word. From the second part of the first French quotation which I have distinguished by Italics, it appears, that Walter Mapes, a learned archdeacon in England, under the reign of king Henry the second, wrote a French SANGREAL, which he translated from Latin, by the command of that monarch. Un∣der the idea, that Walter Mapes was a writer on this subject, and in the fabulous way, some critics may be induced to think, that the WALTER, archdeacon of Oxford, from whom Geof∣frey of Monmouth professes to have received the materials of his history, was this Walter Mapes, and not Walter Calenius, who was also an eminent scholar, and an archdeacon of Oxford. [See vol. i. p. 65.] Geoffrey says in his Dedication to Robert earl of Gloucester, <Q REND="inline">"Finding nothing said in Bede or Gildas of king Arthur and his su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessours, although their actions highly deserved to be recorded in writing, and are orally celebrated by the British bards, I was much surprised at so strange an omission. At length Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, a man of great eloquence, and learned in foreign histories, offered me an ancient book in the British or Armorican tongue; which, in one unbroken story, and an elegant diction, re∣lated the deeds of the British kings from Brutus to Cadwal∣lader. At his request, although unused to rhetorical flou∣rishes, and contented with the simplicity of my own plain language, I undertook the translation of that book into Latin."</Q> B. i. ch. i. See also B. xii. ch. xx. Some writers suppose, that Geoffrey pretended to have received his materials
<PB REF="490"/>
from archdeacon Walter, by way of authenticating his ro∣mantic history. These notices seem to disprove that suspi∣cion. In the year 1488, a French romance was published, in two magnificent folio volumes, entitled, HISTOIRE <HI>de</HI> ROY ARTUS <HI>et des</HI> CHEVALIERS <HI>de la</HI> TABLE RONDE. The first volume was printed at <HI>Rouen,</HI> the second at <HI>Paris.</HI> It contains in four detached parts, the Birth and Achievements of king Arthur, the Life of Sir Lancelot, the Adventure of the San∣greal, and the Death of Arthur, and his Knights. In the body of the work, this romance more than once is said to be written by Walter Map or Mapes, and by the command of his master king Henry. For instance, tom. ii. at the end of PARTIE DU SAINT GRAAL, Signat. d d i. <Q REND="inline">"Cy fine Maistre GUALTIER MAP son traittie du Saint Graal."</Q> Again, tom. ii. LA DERNIERE PARTIE, ch. i.

The French History of the SAN∣GREAL, printed at Paris in folio by Gallyot du Prè in 1516, is said, in the title, to be translated from Latin into French rhymes, and from thence into French prose by Robert Borron. This romance was reprinted in 1523.</P>
<P>Caxton's MORTE ARTHUR, finished in the year 1469, pro∣fesses to treat of various separate histories. But the matter of the whole is so much of the same sort, and the heroes and adven∣tures of one story are so mutually and perpetually blended with those of another, that no real unity or distinction is preserved. It consists of twenty-one books. The first seven books treat of king Arthur. The eighth, ninth, and tenth, of sir Trystram. The eleventh and twelfth of sir Lancelot <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">But at the end, this twelfth book is called the <HI>the second booke of</HI> SYR TRYS∣TRAM.

ARCHAEOLOG. BRIT. Tit. vii. p. 265. col. 2.

<P>I take this opportunity of observing, that a very valuable vel∣lum fragment of LE BRUT, of which the writing is uncom∣monly beautiful and of high antiquity, containing part of the story of Merlin and king Vortigern, covers a manuscript of Chaucer's ASTROLABE, lately presented, together with several oriental manuscripts, to the Bodleian library, by Thomas Hedges, esquire, of Alderton in Wiltshire: a gentleman possessed of many curious manuscripts, and Greek and Roman coins, and most liberal in his communications.</P>

<P>Pag. 357. l. 7. ADD this Note. <Q REND="inline">"Boccacio's situations and incidents, respecting the lovers, are often inartificial and unaf∣fecting. In the Italian poet, Emilia walking in the garden and singing, is seen and heard first by Arcite, who immediately calls Palamon. They are both equally, and at the same point of time, captivated with her beauty; yet without any expres∣sions of jealousy, or appearance of rivalry. But in Chaucer's management of the commencement of this amour, Palamon by seeing Emilia first, acquires an advantage over Arcite, which ultimately renders the catastrophe more agreeable to poetical justice. It is an unnatural and unanimated picture which Boc∣cacio presents, of the two young princes violently enamoured of the same object, and still remaining in a state of amity. In Chaucer, the quarrel between the two friends, the foundation of all the future beautiful distress of the piece, commences at this moment, and causes a conversation full of mutual rage and resentment. This rapid transition from a friendship cemented by every tie, to the most implacable hostility, is on this occa∣sion not only highly natural, but produces a sudden and unex∣pected change of circumstances, which enlivens the detail, and is always interesting. Even afterwards, when Arcite is released from the prison by Perithous, he embraces Palamon at parting. And in the fifth book of the THESEIDE, when Palamon goes armed to the grove in search of Arcite, whom he finds
<PB REF="504"/>
sleeping, they meet on terms of much civility and friendship, and in all the mechanical formality of the manners of romance. In Chaucer, this dialogue has a very different cast. Palamon at seeing Arcite, feels a <HI>colde swerde</HI> glide throughout his heart: he starts from his ambuscade, and instantly salutes Arcite with the appellation of <HI>false traitour.</HI> And although Boccacio has merit in discriminating the characters of the two princes, by giving Palamon the impetuosity of Achilles, and Arcite the mildness of Hector; yet Arcite by Boccacio is here injudiciously represented as too moderate and pacific. In Chaucer he returns the salute with the same degree of indignation, draws his sword, and defies Palamon to single combat. So languid is Boccacio's plan of this amour, that Palamon does not begin to be jealous of Arcite, till he is informed in the prison, that Arcite lived as a favorite servant with Theseus in disguise, yet known to Emilia. When the lovers see Emilia from the window of their tower, she is supposed by Boccacio to observe them, and not to be displeased at their signs of admiration. This circumstance is justly omit∣ted by Chaucer, as quite unnecessary; and not tending either to promote the present business, or to operate in any distant conse∣quences. On the whole, Chaucer has eminently shewn his good sense and judgement in rejecting the superfluities, and improving the general arrangement, of the story. He fre∣quently corrects or softens Boccacio's false manners: and it is with singular address he has often abridged the Italian poet's osten∣tatious and pedantic parade of antient history and mythology.</Q></P>

Impresso nella inclita cita de Milano par magistro Uldericho Scinzenzeler nell anno M. CCCCLXXXXVIII. a di xxvii di mese Septembre."</Q> It is in the octave stanza. The editor of the CANTERBURY TALES informs me, that Boccacio himself, in his DECAMERON, has made the same ho∣nourable mention of this poem as of the THESEIDA: although without acknowledging either for his own. In the Introduc∣tion to the Sixth Day, he says, that <Q REND="inline">"Dioneo insieme con

T. vol. iv. p. 85. iii. p. 311. Chaucer appears to have been as much indebted to Boccacio in his TROILUS AND CRESSEIDE, as in his KNIGHTES TALE. At the same time we must observe, that there are several long passages, and even episodes, in TROILUS, of which no traces appear in the FILOSTRATO. Chaucer speaks of himself as a translator <HI>out of Latin,</HI> B. ii. 14. And he calls his author LOLLIUS, B. i. 394.—421. and B. v. 1652. The latter of these two passages is in the PHILOSTRATO: but the former, containing Petrarch's sonnet, is not.

He says, <Q REND="inline">"I have not observed in any of his writings a single phrase or word, which has the least ap∣pearance of having been fetched from the South of the Loire. With respect to the manner and matter of his compositions, till some clear instance of imitation be produced, I shall be slow to believe, that in either he ever copied the poets of Provence; with whose works, I apprehend, he had very little, if any acquaintance."</Q> Vol. i. APPEND. PREF. p. xxxvi. I have advanced the contrary doctrine, at least by impli∣cation: and I here beg leave to explain myself on a subject ma∣terially affecting the system of criticism that has been formed on Chaucer's works. I have never affirmed, that Chaucer imi∣tated the Provencial bards; although it is by no means impro∣bable, that he might have known their tales. But as the pe∣culiar nature of the Provencial poetry entered deeply into the substance, cast, and character, of some of those French and Italian models, which he is allowed to have followed, he cer∣tainly may be said to have copied, although not immediately, the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of these writers. I have called his HOUSE OF FAME originally a Provencial composition. I did not mean that it was written by a Provencial troubadour: but that Chaucer's original was compounded of the capricious mode of fabling, and that extravagant style of fiction, which constitute the essence of the Provencial poetry. As to the
<PB REF="517"/>
FLOURE AND THE LEAFE, which Dryden pronounces to have been composed <HI>after their manner,</HI> it is framed on the old allegorising spirit of the Provencial writers, refined and disfi∣gured by the fopperies of the French poets in the fourteenth century. The ideas of these fablers had been so strongly im∣bibed, that they continued to operate long after Petrarch had introduced a more rational method of composition.</Q></P>

<P>Pag. 463. Not. col. 1. To the end of l. 8. ADD, <Q REND="inline">"The ground-work of DOLOPATHOS is a Greek story-book called SYNTIPAS, often cited by Du Cange, whose copy appears to have been translated from the Syriac. See GLOSS. MED. et INFIM. Graecitat.—IND. Auctor. p. 33. Among the Harleian manuscripts is another, which is said to be translated from the Persic. MSS. HARL. 5560. Fabricius says, that Syntipas was printed at Venice, <HI>lingua vulgari.</HI> BIBL. GR. x. 515. On the whole, the plan of SYNTIPAS appears to be exactly the same with that of LES SEPT SAGES, the Italian ERASTO, and our own little story book the SEVEN WISE MASTERS: except that, instead of Dioclesian of Rome, the king is called CYRUS of PERSIA; and, instead of one Tale, each of the Philosophers tells two. The circumstance of Persia is an argument, that SYNTIPAS was originally an oriental composition. See what is collected on this curious subject, which is intimately concerned with the history of the invention of the middle ages, by the learned editor of the CATERBURY TALES, vol. iv. p. 329.

ADD to Not. <SUP>k</SUP>. <Q REND="inline">"The nations bordering upon the Jews, attributed the miraculous events of that people, to those external means and material instruments, such as symbols, ce∣remonies, and other visible signs or circumstances, which by God's special appointment, under their mysterious dispensation, they were directed to use. Among the observations which the oriental Gentiles made on the history of the Jews, they found that the Divine will was to be known by certain appearances in pretious stones. The Magi of the east, believing that the preternatural

discoveries obtained by means of the Urim and Thum∣mim, a contexture of gems in the breast-plate of the Mosaic priests, were owing to some virtue inherent in those stones, adopted the knowledge of the occult properties of gems as a branch of their magical system. Hence it became the peculiar profession of one class of their Sages, to investigate and interpret the various shades and coruscations, and to explain, to a moral purpose, the different colours, the dews, clouds, and imageries, which gems, differently exposed to the sun, moon, stars, fire, or air, at particular seasons, and inspected by persons particularly qualified, were seen to exhibit. This notion being once establish∣ed, a thousand extravagancies arose, of healing diseases, of pro∣curing victory, and of seeing future events, by means of pretious stones and other lucid substances. See Plin. NAT. HIST. xxxvii. 9. 10. These superstitions were soon ingrafted into the Ara∣bian philosophy, from which they were propagated all over Eu∣rope, and continued to operate even so late as the visionary ex∣periments of Dee and Kelly <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">When king Richard the first, in 1191, took the isle of Cyprus, he is said to have found the castles filled with rich furniture of gold and silver, <Q REND="inline">"necnon lapidibus pretiosis, et <HI>plurima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> haben∣tibus."</Q> G.

It is not in the mean time at all improbable, that the Druidical doctrines concerning the virtues of stones were derived from these lessons of the Magi: and they are still to be traced among the traditions of the vulgar, in those parts of Britain and Ireland, where Druidism retained its latest establishments.

<P>Pag. 31. ADD, <Q REND="inline">"In lord Gower's library, there is a thin oblong manuscript on vellum, containing some of Gower's poems in Latin, French, and English. By an entry in the first leaf, in the hand-writing, and under the signature, of Thomas lord Fairfax, Cromwell's general, an antiquarian, and a lover and collector of curious manuscripts <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">He gave twenty-nine antient manu∣scripts to the Bodleian library, one of which is a beautiful manuscript of Gow∣er's Confessio Aman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is. When the Record-tower in S. Mary's abbey at York was accidentally blown up in the grand rebellion, he offered rewards to the sol∣diers who could bring him fragments of the scattered parchments. Luckily, how∣ever, the numerous original evidences lodged in this repository had been just be∣fore transcribed by Roger Dodsworth; and the transcripts, which formed the ground-work of Dugdale's MONASTICON, consisting of for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y-nine large folio vo∣lumes, were bequeathed by Fairfax to the same library.

was presented by the poet Gower, about the year 1400, to Henry the fourth; and that it was given by lord Fairfax to his <HI>friend and kinsman</HI> sir Thomas Gower knight and baronet, in the year 1656. By another entry, lord Fairfax acknowledges to have received it, in the same year, as a present, from <HI>that learned gentleman</HI> Charles Gedde esquire, of saint Andrews in Scotland: and at the end, are five or six Latin anagrams on Gedde, written and signed by lord Fairfax, with this title, <Q REND="inline">"In NOMEN venerandi et annosi Amici sui Caroli Geddei."</Q> By king Henry the fourth it seems to have been placed in the royal library: it appears at least to have been in the hands of king Henry the seventh, while earl of Richmond, from the name <HI>Rychemond,</HI> inserted in another of the blank leaves at the beginning, and explained by this note, <Q REND="inline">"Liber Henrici septimi tunc Comitis Richmond, propria manu scripsit."</Q> This manuscript is neatly written, with miniated and illuminated initials: and contains the following pieces. I. A Panegyric in stanzas, with a Latin prologue or rubric in seven hexameters, on king Henry the fourth. This poem, commonly called <HI>Car∣men de pacis Commendatione in laudem Henrici quarti,</HI> is printed in Chaucer's WORKS, edit. Urr. p. 540.—II. A short Latin poem in elegiacs on the same subject, beginning, <Q REND="inline">"Rex coeli deus et dominus qui tempora solus."</Q> [MSS. COTTON. OTHO. D. i. 4.] This is followed by ten other very short pieces, both in French and English, of the same tendency.—III. CIN∣KANTE BALADES, or Fifty Sonnets in French. Part of the first is illegible.

But the CINQUANTE BALADES, or fifty French Sonnets abovementioned, are the curious and valuable part of lord Gower's manuscript. They are not mentioned by those who have written the life of this poet, or have catalogued his works. Nor do they appear in any other manuscript of Gower which I have examined. But if they should be discovered in any other, I will venture to pronounce, that a more authentic, unembar∣rassed, and practicable copy than this before us, will not be produced: although it is for the most part unpointed, and ob∣scured with abbreviations, and with those mispellings which flowed from a scribe unacquainted with the French language.</P>
<P>To say no more, however, of the value which these little pieces may derive from being so scarce and so little known, they have much real and intrinsic merit. They are tender, pathetic, and poetical; and place our old poet Gower in a more advan∣tageous point of view than that in which he has hitherto been usually seen. I know not if any even among the French poets themselves, of this period, have left a set of more finished son∣nets: for they were probably written when Gower was a young man, about the year 1350. Nor had yet any English poet treated the passion of love with equal delic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy of sentiment, and elegance of composition. I will transcribe four of these balades as correctly and intelligibly as I am able: although I must con∣fess, there are some lines which I do not exactly comprehend.</P>

<P>These lines may be thus interpreted. <Q REND="inline">"A boy, very graceful and beautiful, mounted on a swift horse, came into the pa∣lace of king Arthur. He bore in his hand a horn, having four bandages of gold; it was made of ivory, engraved with <HI>trifoire:</HI> many pretious stones were set in the gold, beryls, sardonyces, and rich chalcedonies: it was of elephant [ivory]: nothing was ever so grand, so strong, or so beautiful: at bottom was a ring [or rim] wrought of silver; where were hanging an hundred little bells, framed of fine gold, in the days of Constantine, by a Fairy, brave and wise, for the purpose which ye have just heard me relate. If any one gently struck the horn with his finger, the hundred bells sounded so sweetly, that neither harp nor viol, nor the sports of a virgin, nor the syrens of the sea, could ever give such music."</Q> The author of this <HI>Lai</HI> is one Robert Bikez, as

appears by the last lines; in which the horn is said still to be seen at Cirencester. From this tale came Ariosto's ENCHANTED CUP, ORL FURIOS. xlii. 92. And Fontaine's LA COUPE EN∣CHANTEE. From the COURT MANTEL, a fiction of the same tendency, and which was common among the Welsh bards, Spenser borrowed the wonderful virtues and effects of his FLORIMEL'S GIRDLE, iv. 5. 3.

at most will prove only, that the king assisted at mass in this church, when he came to Bristol. Nor is it improbable, that the other churches of Bristol were cleaned, or adorned, at the coming of a royal guest.

<P>Pag. 164. To the end of the Section, ADD, <Q REND="inline">"What is here said of Rowlie, was not only written, but printed, almost two years before the correct and complete edition of his Poems ap∣peared. Had I been apprised of that publication, I should have been much more sparing in my specimens of these forgeries, which had been communicated to me in manuscript, and which I imagined I was imparting to my readers as curiosities. I had as yet seen only a few extracts of these poems; nor were those transcripts which I received, always exact. Circumstances which I mention here, to shew the inconveniencies under which I laboured, both with regard to my citations and my criticisms. These scanty materials, however, contained suffi∣cient evidence to convince me, that the pieces were not genuine.</Q></P>
<P>The entire and accurate collection of Rowlie's now laid be∣fore the public, has been so little instrumental in inducing me to change my opinion, that it has served to exemplify and con∣firm every argument which I have produced in support of my
<PB REF="537"/>
suspicions of an imposition. It has likewise afforded some new proofs.</P>
<P>Those who have been conversant in the works even of the best of our old English poets, well know, that one of their leading characteristics is inequality. In these writers, splendid descriptions, ornamental comparisons, poetical images, and stri∣king thoughts, occur but rarely: for many pages together, they are tedious, prosaic, and uninteresting. On the contrary, the poems before us are every where supported: they are through∣out, poetical and animated. They have no imbecillities of style or sentiment. Our old English bards abound in unnatural con∣ceptions, strange imaginations, and even the most ridiculous absurdities. But Rowlie's poems present us with no incon∣gruous combinations, no mixture of manners, institutions, cus∣toms, and characters. They appear to have been composed after ideas of discrimination had taken place; and when even common writers had begun to conceive, on most subjects, with precision and propriety. There are indeed, in the BATTLE OF HAST∣INGS, some great anachronisms; and practices are mentioned which did not exist till afterwards. But these are such incon∣sistencies, as proceeded from fraud as well as ignorance: they are such as no old poet could have possibly fallen into, and which only betray an unskilful imitation of antient manners. The verses of Lydgate and his immediate successors are often rugged and un∣musical: but Rowlie's poetry sustains one uniform tone of har∣mony; and, if we brush away the asperities of the antiquated spelling, conveys its cultivated imagery in a polished and agree∣able strain of versification. Chatterton seems to have thought, that the distinction of old from modern poetry consisted only in the use of old words. In counterfeiting the coins of a rude age, he did not forget the usual application of an artificial rust: but this disguise was not sufficient to conceal the elegance of the workmanship.</P>
<P>The BATTLE OF HASTINGS, just mentioned, might be proved to be a palpable forgery for many other reasons. It is
<PB REF="538"/>
said to be translated from the Saxon of Turgot. But Turgot died in 1015, and the battle of Hastings was fought in 1066. We will, however, allow, that Turgot lived in the reign of the Conqueror. But, on that supposition, is it not extraor∣dinary, that a cotemporary writer should mention no circum∣stances of this action which we did not know before, and which are not to be found in Malmsbury, Ordericus Vitalis, and other antient chroniclers? Especially as Turgot's description of this battle was professedly a detached and separate performance, and at least, on that account, would be minute and circumstantial. An original and a cotemporary writer, describing this battle, would not only have told us something new, but would other∣wise have been full of particularities. The poet before us dwells on incidents common to all battles, and such as were easily to be had from Pope's HOMER. We may add, that this piece not only detects itself, but demonstrates the spuriousness of all the rest. Chatterton himself allowed the first part of it to be a forgery of his own. The second part, from what has been said, could not be genuine. And he who could write the second part was able to write every line in the whole collection. But while I am speaking of this poem, I cannot help exposing the futility of an argument which has been brought as a deci∣sive evidence of its originality. It is urged, that the names of the chiefs who accompanied the Conqueror, correspond with the Roll of Battle-Abbey. As if a modern forger could not have seen this venerable record. But, unfortunately, it is printed in Hollinshead's Chronicle.</P>
<P>It is said that Chatterton, on account of his youth and edu∣cation, could not write these poems. This may be true; but it is no proof that they are not forged. Who was their author, on the hypothesis that Rowlie was not, is a new and another question. I am, however, of opinion that it was Chatterton. For if we attend only to some of the pieces now extant in a periodical magazine, which he published under his own sig∣nature, and which are confessedly of his composition, to his
<PB REF="539"/>
letters now remaining in manuscript, and to the testimony of those that were acquainted with his conversation, he will appear to have been a singular instance of a prematurity of abilities; to have acquired a store of general information far exceeding his years, and to have possessed that comprehension of mind, and activity of understanding, which predominated over his situa∣tions in life, and his opportunities of instruction. Some of his publications in the magazines discover also his propensity to forgery, and more particularly in the walk of antient man∣ners, which seem greatly to have struck his imagination. These, among others, are ETHELGAR, a <HI>Saxon poem</HI> in prose; KENRICK, <HI>translated from the Saxon;</HI> CERDICH, <HI>translated from the Saxon;</HI> GODRED CROVAN, a Poem, <HI>composed by Doth∣nel Syrric king of the isle of Man;</HI> The HIRLAS, <HI>composed by Blythyn, prince of North Wales;</HI> GOTHMUND, <HI>translated from the Saxon;</HI> ANECDOTE of CHAUCER, and of the ANTIQUITY of CHRISTMAS GAMES. The latter piece, in which he quotes a register of Keinsham NUNNERY, which was a priory of Black canons, and advances many imaginary facts, strongly shews his track of reading, and his fondness for antiquarian imagery. In this monthly collection he inserted ideal drawings of six achieve∣ments of Saxon heraldry, of an inedited coin of queen Sex∣burgeo, wife of king Kinewalch, and of a Saxon amulet; with explanations equally fantastic and arbitrary. From Rowlie's pretended parchments he produced several heraldic delineations. He also exhibited a draught by Rowlie of Bristol castle in its perfect state. I very much doubt if this fortress was not almost totally ruinous in the reign of Edward the fourth. This draught, however, was that of an edifice evidently fictitious. It was exceedingly ingenious; but it was the representation of a building which never existed, in a capricious and affected style of Gothic architecture, reducible to no period or system.</P>
<P>To the whole that is here suggested on this subject, let us add Chatterton's inducements and qualifications for forging these poems, arising from his character, and way of living. He
<PB REF="540"/>
was an adventurer, a professed hireling in the trade of litera∣ture, full of projects and inventions, artful, enterprising, unprincipled, indigent, and compelled to subsist by expedients.</P>

<P>I take this opportunity of pointing out another source of Boccacio's TALES. Friar Philip's story of the GOOSE, or of the Young Man who had never seen a Woman, in the Prologue to the fourth day of the DECAMERON, is taken from a spiri∣tual romance, called the HISTORY OF BARLAAM AND JOSA∣PHAT.

The Latin, which is also a common manuscript, was printed so early as the year 1470. It has often appeared in French. A modern Latin version was published at Paris in 1577. The legendary historians, who believed every thing, and even Baronius, have placed Barlaam and Josaphat in their catalogues of confessours. Saint Barlaam and saint Josaphat occur in the METRICAL LIVES OF THE SAINTS. MSS. BODL. 72. fol. 288. b. This
