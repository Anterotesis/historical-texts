<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
UPON
LOANS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING Treated in brief
upon the Difficult Subject
of <HI>Credit,</HI> and that, if (the
Town is not a Deceiver),
with some Success; it seems
necessary to speak a Word or two upon
the great Object, upon which that Cre∣dit
Operates, <HI>viz. Loans of Money</HI> up∣on
the Publick Demands.</P>
<P>The Author, <HI>an Enemy to long Pre∣faces,</HI>
presents his Thoughts to the
World upon this Head, without any o∣ther
Apology than this, That he thinks it
a Service at this time, to remove the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Mistakes which some make, and others
improve to our Disadvantage, while
they think it is to the Disadvantage of
some Body else: While they aim at
an Object they would hurt, they Wound
themselves; and in Prosecuting private
or Party-Prejudices, Injure, Weaken, and
Assault the Publick Good; which every
Man has a Property in, and therefore is
in Duty bound to Defend.</P>
<P>A Discourse upon <HI>Credit,</HI> is naturally
an Introduction to a Discourse upon <HI>Loan</HI>;
<HI>Credit</HI> without <HI>Loan</HI> is a Beautiful Flower,
fair to the Eye, fragrant to the Smell, or∣namental
to the Plot of Ground it grows
in; but yielding neither Fruit nor Seed,
neither Profit to the Possessor of it, by
making due Advantage of its Produce, or
Benefit to Posterity, by Propagation of its
Species. On the other Hand, <HI>Loans</HI> with∣out
<HI>Credit</HI> are like the Labouring Plow∣man
upon a Barren Soil, who Works,
Cultivates, Sweats, and Toils, but to no
purpose, all the Fruit of his Labour, ends
in Sterility and Abortion.</P>
<P><HI>Loans</HI> are the Consequences of <HI>Credit,</HI>
and the Evidence of that particular Qua∣lity,
which in the preceding Discourse of
<HI>Credit,</HI> I lay'd down as its Foundation; I
mean General Probity, Punctual, Just,
and Honourable Management.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
To explain Things as I go; tho' this
needs but little: By <HI>Loans,</HI> I am now to be
understood to mean, <HI>Lending Money to the
present Government</HI>: The Thing will ex∣tend
to private Affairs, and I might take
up a great deal of your Time, in speak∣ing
of the Effects of <HI>Credit</HI> in Trade, such
as delivering Goods by Tradesmen to
one another, Paper-Credit in Affairs of
Cash; Pledging, Pawning, and all the
Articles of Security for Money, practis'd
in General Commerce; but these Things
are not to the present Purpose.</P>
<P>The Author of this, confines his Dis∣course
to the Government Borrowing
Money of the Subject, whether upon Se∣curities
Establish'd by Parliament equi∣valent
in Value deliver'd, publick Faith,
general Credit, or otherwise.</P>
<P>The Nature of these Securities, the Rea∣son,
the Usefulness, and the Foundation
they stand on, are no part of the present
Subject; they are reserv'd by the Author
to a Head by themselves, if Leisure and
the publick Service make it proper to pre∣sent
you a Discourse upon <HI>Funds.</HI></P>
<P>The present War, which, with a small
Interval of an unsetled and Impolitick
Peace, is now in its 22d Year, has
been remarkable in several Circumstances,
above all the Wars that ever this Nation
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
has been Engag'd in, since the <HI>Roman's</HI>
possess'd it.</P>
<P>It has been,<LIST>
<ITEM>The longest in it's Duration</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Fiercest and most Expensive in
Blood;</ITEM>
<ITEM>The most Famous in Successes, and un∣heard
of Victories;</ITEM>
<ITEM>It has been carry'd on against the most
Powerful Enemies;</ITEM>
<ITEM>It has produc'd the most firm, and the
Greatest Confederacy;</ITEM>
<ITEM>And it has in View, the most Glorious
Conclusion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Together with these Things, it has
this also peculiar to it; that it has been
carry'd on at an Expence, which has sur∣mounted
not all that ever went before it
only, but all that it could be imagin'd, was
possible for any Nation of our Dimensi∣ons
in the World, to support.</P>
<P>Not the <HI>Fr.</HI> King only has been deceiv'd
in the Efforts made by this Nation in the
Process of the War; which, as penetra∣ting
as he is, he never thought possible;
but is is most certain, had the wisest and
best Calculator in the Island been told
what the Undertaking would have call'd
for, he would have determined it to be
forty Millions Sterling beyond what the
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y"/>
Nation was able to do, and that without
selling the very Nation, it could not be
done.</P>
<P>As the view of the Expence would have
made us wisely have avoided the War,
and either not have begun it, or long
since ended it, upon the best Terms we
could obtain from the Enemy; so had
the Enemy believed <HI>England</HI> capable of
supporting the War, at such a prodigy of
Expence, he would never have begun it;
which the King of <HI>France</HI> himself has been
heard, in Terms very plain, to acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>When upon the Revolution the Parli∣ment
fell most willingly into the War, as
a thing the Enemy, by espousing King
<HI>James</HI>'s Interest, made absolutely Neces∣sary:
The first Brach of our Expence
was carried on in the common Road of
levying Taxes, and the Money required
for every Years Expence was raised and
paid within the Year.</P>
<P>The Nation was rich, Trade prodigi∣ously
great, Paper-Credit run high, and
the Goldsmiths in <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> &amp;c.
commanded immense Summs; Antici∣pations
were indeed in Practice, they
had been so of Old, and borrowing Clauses
were added to the Bills of Aid; but these
lasted but a few Months, the Money
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y"/>
came in of course, and they were paid
off in their turn: Land-Tax, Polls, ad∣ditional
Duties of Customs, Excises, and
the like, were the Ways and Means by
which these things were done; the Year
generally supported its own Demands,
all the Loans were supposed to be Tem∣porary,
and to end with the Collection.</P>
<P>As the War every Year grew heavier
upon us, and the Expence increased, new
Ways and Means were necessary to sup∣ply
the growing Demand, till all the
Taxes that could be raised, by the ordi∣nary
Way, were found little enough to
bring the Annual Expence about.</P>
<P>This put the Commissioners of the
Treasury upon listening to new Taxes,
and entertaining all the Projects for rais∣ing
Money, that the working Heads of
the Age could supply them with.</P>
<P>These, back'd with Parliamentary Au∣thority,
were too unadvisedly supposed
to raise such certain Summs as the Pub∣lick
Occasions then call'd for, and borrow∣ing
Clauses were added to them, limit∣ting
the said Summs; which pass'd as a
giving the Treasury Credit upon the Acts
of Parliament for such Summs as they
were granted for; but the Collections
falling infinitely short of the Summs pro∣posed,
left the Publick in Arrear to the
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y"/>
Lenders, and from hence came the great
Load of Deficiencies, which the Nation
feels the Weight of to this Hour.</P>
<P>As the Summs given fell short, so the
War called every Year for still greater
Summs; which added to the Deficiencies
of the old Taxes, grew so heavy, that
our Mannagers found it was in vain to
struggle with the Difficulty any Longer,
upon the foot of Annual Taxes; and that
it was next to impossible to raise every
Year what the publick Occasions call'd
for.</P>
<P>This lead them of course to a new Me∣thod
to supply the great Demands of the
War, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by Establishing Annual Re∣ceipts
of limited or perpetual Interests for
such Summs, as might be borrowed upon
the Credit of the Nation, the Principal to
sink in the Hands of the Publick. These
were call'd FUNDS.</P>
<P>To encourage the People to lend upon
these Funds, Premioes for advancing the
Money, large Interests, and other Ad∣vantages
were annex'd; such as 14 <HI>per
Cent. per Annum</HI> upon Annuities, with
Survivourship, Chance of Prizes by way
of Lottery, 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon Exchequer
Bills, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Here, together with the innumerable Tal∣lies,
which upon the Deficiency of former
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Taxes as aforesaid, went about the Town
upon Discount, and the great Obstructi∣on
of running Cash, by calling in the old
Coin, was the first rise given to the Art
and Mystery of Stock-Jobbing; a Pra∣ctice,
whether good or evil in its Conse∣quences
to the publick Affairs, is not to
the present Purpose to enquire.</P>
<P>By this Method has the greatest part
of our Yearly Taxes, since that time, been
raised; the Parliament Establishing Funds
for payment of Interest, and the People
advanving Money, by way of Loan, on
those Interests.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here for some
People to reflect, That in the Advantages
granted by the Government upon these
Loans, and the great Discounts upon Tal∣lies
on the deficient Aids, mentioned a∣bove,
were founded the great stocks of
Money, Banks and powerful Credit;
with which some People are grown to
such a height, especially in their own O∣pinion,
as to talk of influencing the pub∣lick
Affairs, and as it were menacing the
Government with Apprehensions of their
Lending or not Lending, as they are, or
are not pleased with the Management of,
or Managers in the publick Oeconomy;
and this is the Subject I am a little to
speak to.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11" MS="y"/>
LOANS to the Government, by the
Gradations aforesaid, having been found
essentially Necessary, the first Steps to
that new Method were found fatally In∣cumbering;
the high <HI>Premio's</HI> given, the
great Advantages proposed, and the large
Interests paid to the Lender. The Go∣vernment
appear'd like a distressed Deb∣tor,
who was every Day squeez'd to Death
by the exorbitant greediness of the Len∣der;
the Citizens began to decline Trade
and turn Userers; Foreign Commerce
attended with the hazards of War, had
infinite Discouragements, and the People
in general drew home their Effects, to
embrace the Advantage of lending their
Money to the Government. Then grew
up the BANK, whose second Subscripti∣on
being founded upon a Parliamentary
Security, for making good the deficient
Tallies; was formed by receiving in those
Tallies at <HI>Par,</HI> which cost the Subscribers
but 55 to 65 <HI>per Cent</HI>; by which the
greatest Estates were raised in the least
time, and the most of them, that has been
known in any Age, or in any part of the
World.</P>
<P>This, I say, turn'd the whole City in∣to
a Corporation of Usury, and they ap∣pear'd
not as a <HI>Bank,</HI> but rather one ge∣neral
Society of Bankers; all Men that
<PB N="12" REF="12" MS="y"/>
could draw any Money out of their
Trades, run with it to <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
to buy Stocks and Tallies, Subscribe
to Banks or Companies; or to the
Exchequer with it to put into Loans,
and lend it upon the advantageous FUNDS
settled by Parliament.</P>
<P>It is meet to mention these things, for
the sake of the People who have gotten
such great Estates by the Government, to
let them know from whence the Advan∣tages
they have made, did proceed; and
also for some other Reasons which will
appear in the sequel of this Discourse.</P>
<P>The Government, to preserve to them∣selves
the Advantage of these Loans, and
yet to avoid being Imposed upon and
Opprest by those exorbitant Interests
and Encouragements, about the Year
1698. entered into Measures to secure the
Loan of Money, and yet lower the Ad∣vantages
given to the Lenders.</P>
<P>The first was done by the Parliament,
apylying themselves to restore <HI>Credit,</HI> by
a Vote to make good all Deficiencies, and
Erecting a punctual, just, and fair Ma∣nagement
of the Payments; by which
every several Engagement being Honou∣rably
complyed with, the Credit of the
publick Affairs reviv'd, and the Exorbi∣tances
the former Years were exposed to,
wore off of course.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
This tedious Recapitulation of Things
will appear less trouble to the Reader,
when he sees the use I shall make of it.</P>
<P>Here may be seen several Things,
which, if well considered, tend to the
lowring the high and extravagant Ima∣ginations
of some People, with respect to
<HI>Loans, Credit, Borrowing</HI> and <HI>Lending</HI> of
Money to the Government; such as
these.<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Large Interest, Advantages,
<HI>Premio's</HI> for advance of Money, and
the like, will bring in <HI>Loans</HI> in spight
of Parties, in spight of Deficiencies,
in spight of all the Conspiracies in
the World to the contrary; while
a just, honourable, and punctual Per∣formance
on the part of the Govern∣ment,
does but maintain the Credit
of the Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. As the Affairs of the Govern∣ment
have made <HI>Loans</HI> necessary,
and they can not go on without Bor∣rowing;
so the stream of Trade and
Cash is so Universally turn'd into
publick Funds, the whole Ntia∣on
feels so much of gains, so much by,
and depends so much upon the pub∣lick
Credit, that they can no more
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
do without the Funds, than the
Funds can do without the Loan.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. These Borrowings and Lend∣ings
are become so much a Trade,
so many Families have their Em∣ployment
from, and get so great
Estates by the Negotiating these
Things, that it is impossible for any
particular Sett of Men to put a stop
to it; or to get any such Power in∣to
their Hands, as to give the Go∣vernment
just Grounds of Ap∣prehension,
that this or that Party
of Men can put a Cheque to the
publick Affairs, be they <HI>Whigs, To∣ries,</HI>
<HI>City, Court, Banks, Company,</HI>
or what they please to call them∣selves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I shall not tye my self to speak to these
apart, <HI>the liberty of this Tract will not ad∣mit
of it,</HI> but in a Summary way you will
find the Fact Demonstrated, and the
Consequence Evident.</P>
<P>Men in Trade, more especially than the
rest of Mankind, are bound by their Inte∣rest;
Gain is the end of Commerce, where
that Gain visibly attends the Adventurer,
as no Hazard can discourage, so no other
Obligation can prevent the Application<Q>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15"/>
To pretend after this, that Parties shall
Govern Mankind against their Gain, is
to Philosophize wisely upon what <HI>may be,</HI>
and what would be Politick to bring to
pass; but what no Man can say was ever
put in Practise to any Perfection; or can
be so by the common Principles that Go∣vern
Mankind in the World.</P>
<P>There have been Combinations in
Trade, and People have seem'd to act
counter to their present Interests; nay,
have gone on in apparent Loss, in pur∣suance
of such Combinations; but they
have always been made in order to secure
a Return of greater Gain; and therefore
the Laws made against such Combinati∣ons,
are not made to prevent Peoples go∣ing
on to their Loss, but to prevent the
end of that appearing Loss; <HI>viz.</HI> the In∣grossment
or Monopolizing of Trade, to
come at some Advantage over others, and
thereby make an exorbitant Gain.</P>
<P>But it was never yet heard, that the
Zeal of any Party got the better so much
of their Interest, as to put a general Stop
to the current and natural Stream of their
Interest; that a People should reject the
fair and just Advantages which have rai∣sed
so many Estates, and are the due
Supplies to the Breaches made by the
War upon general Commerce. To talk,
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
that we will not lend Money to the Go∣vernment,
while the Parliament settles
Funds, allows Interests, gives <HI>Premio's</HI>
and Advantages, is to say, Nature will
cease, Men of Money will abstain from
being Men loving to get Money. That
Tradesmen should cease to seek Gain, and
Userers to love large Interests; that Men
that have gain'd Money should leave off
desiring to get more; and that Zeal to a
Party should prevail over Zeal to their
Families; that Men should forfeit their
Interest for their Humour, and serve
their Politicks at the price of their In∣terest.</P>
<P>Let those that promise themselves these
things, enquire among the Merchants,
and see if Parties govern any thing in
Trade; if there is either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI>
in a good Bargain; Churchman or Dis∣senter
in a good Freight; High Church
or Low Church in a Good Adventure;
if a Shop-keeper sees a good Penny∣worth,
a Scrivener a good Mortgage, a
Money'd Man a good Purchase; Do they
ever ask what Party he is of that parts
with it? Nay, rather in spight of Party
Aversions, do we not Buy, Sell, Lend,
Borrow, enter into Companies, Partner∣ships,
and the closest Engagements with
oen another, nay Marry with one ano∣ther
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
without any Questions of the Mat∣ter?</P>
<P>Let us come to the general Body of
People as Fate has unhappily divided us;
where are the Men? supposing a Party
Conspiracy against the Government in
this matter of Loan; Where are the Men
who would hold together, and refuse
making seven <HI>per Cent.</HI> of their Money to
preserve the Engagement? Where the
Men who would stay their Hands, and
lose the probability of gaining a Thou∣sand
Pounds a Year by a Lottery? <HI>No,</HI>
<HI>no,</HI> it is not to be done; the stream of
Desire after Gain runs too strong in Man∣kind,
to bring any thing of that kind to
Perfection in this Age. The thing is so
impracticable in its Nature, that it seems
a Token of great Ignorance in the Hu∣mour
of the Age to suggest it; and a
Man would be tempted to think those
People that do suggest it, do not them∣selves
believe what they say about it.</P>
<P>In the matter of Loan it next comes
in our way to enquire, how does the
Cash of the Nation, which is the thing we
are upon, stand divided, and how is the Go∣vernment
in hazard of any Combinati∣on
of this kind? If it be possible to make
this Enquiry without any Party By ass,
and so as to give Offence to neither side,
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
it shall be done. I do not say who is in,
or who out; who has the Management,
who had it, or who would have it; let
that stand as it does, or may; but how
do the Parties stand, with respect to one
another; supposing any one Party would
endeavour to stagnate the general Circu∣lation
of Credit, in Prejudice of the other:
As for the purpose;</P>
<P>Suppose a Whig Administration, and all
the High Church Men and their Appen∣dices
in hopes to reduce them to Exigen∣ces
in the Management, should Con∣spire
together to run down the Publick
Credit, and lend no Money on any of
the Funds. <HI>Vice Versa</HI>; suppose a Reverse,
and the Whigs in general should do the
same thing: Let us enquire; Are either of
these Parties sso rich in Cash, so power∣ful
in Lending, that all the <HI>Loans</HI> must
depend upon their Money; or are either
of these Parties so inconsiderable in this
Case, that their Support shall signify no∣thing
without the concurrence of the o∣ther?
If the last were true, that weak
Party could make no manner of Figure
in this Government, or be significant e∣nough
for the Sovereign without visible
Distraction to engage with. To descend
to Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19"/>
The Notion is general, at least among
themselves, that the Gross of the Cash
is with the Whigs; and the <HI>Review</HI>
speaks of it as a thing capable of some
Demonstrations; tho' with his good li∣king,
it may be said, he may be mistaken.
Some have gone a length beyond the
Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> and will have it,
that the Money lies in the Hands of the
Dissenters; and will allow the Church∣men,
especially the High-Church-Men
to have little enough for themselves,
and by consequence less to spare to the
Publick Loans.</P>
<P>Others will tell you, the High-Church-Party
have a large share of the Nation's
Cash in their Hands; that they have ge∣nerally
a Proportion of Money, and
beyond Comparison more Land than the
other. They add, That as they have
more Land, they can when they please
have more Money; and that therefore
tho' they should grant that the Low-Church
and Dissenters put together, have
the most ready Money, yet allowing
them the Superiority in the Lands, they
can fetch the Money into their own
Hands when they please.</P>
<P>It is not for me to determine who
has most Land, or who most Money;
it is my Opinion, neither have so much
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
or so little, as to render them Formidable
or Contemptible to one another in the
Matter of Loan. Both Sides have enough
to be useful to, and both Sides have little
enough to stand in need of one another;
and in this Division the Ballance of Parties
(which at this time is the onely Felicity
that we can find in having any Parties at
all,) does consist.</P>
<P>I make no Difficulty to Acknowledge,
That where the Land is, there is the
Foundation of all the real Wealth in the
Nation: I do not say, it is in this or that
Party exclusive; That the Gentlemen,
who call themselves of the High-Party,
have a great share of the Land, is most
certain, but that they have so much
more than the Whigs and Dissenters
join'd, as some will alledge, I cannot de∣termine.
No doubt where the Land is,
there can be no want of Money, because
Land will at any time raise Money;
whereas Money, without the Assistance
of Trade, Landed-men, or Governments,
can operate no way, but like the Viper,
preying upon it self.</P>
<P>This leads me to Examine the
Difference between <HI>Loan</HI> and <HI>Fund</HI> in
this Case. Examining which, something
may perhaps come to light for our Instru∣ction,
<PB N="21" REF="21" MS="y"/>
which has not been much thought
of before,</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>The Borrower is Ser∣vant
to the Lender</HI>; but with the Wise∣man's
leave, in this Case it is not so.
<HI>Solomon</HI> is there to be understood speaking
of the poor borrowing Wretch, who Bor∣row'd
upon the Foot of Charity and
Compassion, and therefore he just before
says, <HI>The Poor uses many Entreaties, but
the Rich answer roughly.</HI> The poor Man
that Borrows on his single Promise to sup∣ply
his urgent Necessity, <HI>uses Entreaties,</HI>
as we may say, <HI>He Begs to Borrow</HI>; but
the <HI>rich Lender</HI> is surly, hardly consents,
<HI>answers Roughly,</HI> and is with Difficulty
brought to Lend.</P>
<P>But we are to Distinguish here between
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Borrower describ'd as above, and
he that Borrows on a sufficient current
Security: He is no more Servant to the
Lender than the Lender is Servant to
him; having an unquestion'd Security to
give, he scorns to ask you twice; but if
you do not think fit to lend your Money,
he goes to another.</P>
<P>This is apparent in the <HI>Public Secu∣rities,</HI>
as well as in private; and will
make it out, if ever put to the Test,
That the People of <HI>England</HI> stand in as
much need of <HI>the Funds</HI> to lend their
<PB N="22" REF="22" MS="y"/>
Money upon, as the Government stands
in need of their Money <HI>upon those Funds.</HI>
I prove this by a matter of Fact, fresh in
your Memories, and undeniable in all
its Circumstances. In the Beginning of
the War, when the Money lay abroad in
TRADE, the Knowledge of Affairs young,
and the People not apprized of the thing;
the Anticipations upon Taxes and Loans
came heavy, and were small, <HI>What drew
them on?</HI> Large Premio's, high Interests,
Chances of Prizes, Survivorship, and the
like.</P>
<P>Thus when the Necessities of the Go∣vernment
were great and their Credit
young to Borrow, the Lenders made their
Market: But when the Government
found themselves <HI>rich in Funds,</HI> their
Demands, <HI>tho' great,</HI> yet not pressing;
Credit Establish'd, the Parliament, <HI>the
great Fund of Funds,</HI> and Center of
Credit, ready to make good Deficiencies,
and leaving no room for Jealousies in the
Minds of the People, <HI>What was the
Case?</HI> You took off your Premio's, you
drew no more Lotteries for 16 Years,
you lower'd your Interest, you brought
your Annuities from 14 to 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
and your Interest on Tallies from 7 to 6
<HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI> From 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon
Exchequer-Bills, you came down to 4
<PB N="23" REF="23" MS="y"/>
<HI>per Cent.</HI> And what was the Consequence?
The Necessity of the Lenders being
more to lodge their Money for Improve∣ment,
than the Necessity of the Borrow∣ers
was to ask, they came always down
to your Price; and had you brought the
general Interest of Loans to 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
they must have come down, for Money
is no longer Money than it can be im∣prov'd.
<HI>Nay, it is to be observ'd,</HI> the
Eagerness of the People to bring in their
Money encreased, as the Advantages of
Lending decreased: Having no way to
improve it better, they were under an
absolute Necessity of bringing it in, for
the sake of the Improvement.</P>
<P>Are these any of the People, who can
be supposed to say to the Parliament,
They will not lend their Money? It
would almost provoke a Man to laugh at
them. You won't lend your Money!
Why, what will you do with it?</P>
<P>Perhaps you wont lend it to the Go∣vernment,
<HI>well</HI> you will <HI>then</HI> lend it upon
private Security, upon Land, and the
like; why then those you lend it to, will
lend it to the Government, and so the
Malice of the Affair will be lost, and the
Advantage too. Will you run it into
Trade? <HI>Do so by all means.</HI> Some of
those Hands it will Circulate through,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
will lend it to the Government. Your
very <HI>Export</HI> and <HI>Import</HI> is a Loan to the
Government. In short, the Govern∣ment
shall have your Money <HI>first or last,</HI>
do what you will with it.</P>
<P>Suppose it were possible to divide this
Nation into two Parts, the Landed-men
and the Money'd-men, and the Govern∣ment
were to be put into the Hands of
the <HI>First</HI> against the Consent of the <HI>Last</HI>;
and the Money'd-men knowing the Land∣ed-men
could not carry on the War with∣out
Money, resolv'd to lend them none,
I mean as a Government, What Course
should the Landed-men take?</P>
<P>In my Opinion, they should pass an
Act, That none of those People should
be admitted to lend any Money to the
Government at all; What then would
be the Consequence? They would be
immediately distress'd with the Weight
of Money without Improvement; they
would eagerly lend it to the Landed-men
at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Land; and
they again lending it to the Government
at 6 and 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Government
would be supply'd, and the Landed-men
would get 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> by the other Mens
Money.</P>
<P>I am not making Application; but let
any of the present Parties, who Boast of
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
their having the Gross of the Money,
reflect what they would say, if an Act
were to pass, That no <HI>Whig</HI>'s Money, or
no <HI>Dissenter</HI>'s Money, or no High-Church∣man's
Money should be accepted upon
Loan; That they should not be allow'd
a Transfer upon any Stock, or to Buy
any Annuity; the Complaint would be
very loud of their being excluded the
common Advantages of their Fellow-Subjects;
and that paying their Share of
Taxes, they ought to have room for equal
Improvements, and ought not to be ex∣cluded;
<HI>and this is true too,</HI> it would
be hard. Then they would run about
to their Friends among the contrary
Party, shelter their Money under their
Names, and perhaps give ½ <HI>per Cent.</HI> or
1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Commission to others to Lend,
Buy and Transfer for them: And what
would the Government feel in all this?</P>
<P>The Case is this, No Party can be
so foolish to think they can be able stop the
Loan of Money to the Government; nor
need the Government think of putting the
Laws in Execution against such Combi∣nation
(<HI>tho' if any such appear'd, no doubt
they might be prosecuted.</HI>) Keep up but
the Credit of Parliament, and let that
Parliament find Funds, it is not in the
Power of any Party of Men to Stop
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
the Current of Loans, any more than
they can Stop the Tide at <HI>London-Bridge,</HI>
in its constant Course of Flux and Re∣flux
from and to the Sea.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the <HI>French</HI> have
Agents amons us, who would be glad to
weaken our Hands in the War, and pre∣vent
our Supplies for that Purpose: From
them it must be that these Notions creep
into Peoples Heads; <HI>English</HI> Men cannot
in their common Senses be so weak; tel∣ling
us that we shall have no <HI>Loans,</HI> is
much at one to telling us we shall have
no Recruits to our Army; as, while you
can Pay Armies, you shall never want
Men; so while you can pay Interest, you
shall never want <HI>Loans.</HI></P>
<P>The Estates that some Men boast of,
by which they are enabled to Lend, and
made bold enough to threaten a stop of
it, were gain'd by Lending. Those that
have them are too eager to Encrease them,
those that want them too eager to Gain
them, by the same method, and all too
Covetous and too Selfish not to come into
any good Proposal.</P>
<P>The Worst these Men can do, is, by ma∣king
things appear backward, to raise the
Rate of Interests, and move the Parliament
to add something to the usual Encourage∣ments
for lending; and if the Nation pays
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
this, who have they to blame for it? Yet
neither will they be able to do this, the
present Credit of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament
putting it out of their Power; for as the
necessity of Lending will prompt on one
Hand, the undoubted Security of Parlia∣mentary
Credit removes all the Jealousies
our Party-men would raise on the other.</P>
<P>The Zeal some Men shew for their
Country, as well as Justice to the Govern∣ment,
is nevertheless very Conspicuous in
this; who (first) to glorifie their Party-Pre∣judices
would have the War miscarry, ra∣ther
than Money should be lent, while such
Men Manage as they pretend not to like;
(secondly) reproach some People with De∣signs
to make Peace with <HI>France,</HI> and yet
endeavour by discouraging <HI>Loans</HI> to render
it impossible for them to carry on the War.</P>
<P>But both these will be disappointed:
While the Parliament Supports Credit,
and good Funds Support the Parliament,
Money will come in as naturally, as Fire
will ascend, or Water flow; nor will it
be in the Power of our worst Enemies to
prevent it.</P>
