<L><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG> YOU the Monarch's Bliss, the Muse's Friend!</L>
<L>Accept the tribute Duty bids me send:</L>
<L>'Tis what the Bard shou'd long before have paid,</L>
<L>But fearful to aspire, has long delay'd.</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> alone can <HI>Phoebus</HI>' Chariot guide,</L>
<L>The Youth who dar'd to drive it, daring dy'd.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
My humble Muse can humble Subjects treat,</L>
<L>But trembles to attempt a Theme so Great!</L>
<L>Yet warm with Gratitude, wou'd fain display</L>
<L>Her Zeal to you, on this auspicious Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To you! whose gracious Goodness plumes her Wings,</L>
<L>By whom she lives, by whom inspir'd she sings;</L>
<L>Long may she Celebrate your Sacred BIRTH;</L>
<L>Long may you stay from Heav'n to bless the Earth:</L>
<L>To Chear the Royal Sov'reign of our ISLE;</L>
<L>Increase his Joys, or soften all his Toil,</L>
<L>Who now, while Death in purple Triumph reigns,</L>
<L>And sanguine Floods pollute the distant Plains,</L>
<L>Watchful o'er <HI>Britain</HI>'s Fate employs his Car,</L>
<L>Or wisely to avert, or bravely meet the War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Glorious QUEEN! by Nature form'd to bring</L>
<L>The sweetest Comfort to the Justest KING:</L>
<L>Let proud Oppressors, who abuse their Pow'r,</L>
<L>Hear groaning Subjects curse their natal Hour.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
You, on that happy Hour, may justly feast</L>
<L>Your Soul with Thoughts of making Thousands bless'd;</L>
<L>Whose godlike Bounties, to the Wretched, show,</L>
<L>You're only Pow'rful to relieve their Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' the Muse old Annals should explore,</L>
<L>Mark all our Queens, and trace their Virtues o'er?</L>
<L>Where cou'd she find so much exalted Sense,</L>
<L>Nobly employ'd like your's, in Truth's Defence?</L>
<L>You strive to make the Seeds of Virtue grow,</L>
<L>To spread the Light which Heav'n reveal'd below:</L>
<L>Yet, free from superstitious Zeal, incline</L>
<L>To make the Rays of moral Goodness shine,</L>
<L>Supporting those, who firm to Truth, defend</L>
<L>That first fix'd Law, on which all Laws depend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath your Influence, Art and Science rear</L>
<L>Their sacred Heads, and flourish by your Care;</L>
<L>This Truth let <HI>Oxford</HI>'s pompous Dome proclaim,</L>
<L>Which boasts the Honour of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Queen's College.</NOTE> Royal Name;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Lately your Bard survey'd the graceful Scene,</L>
<L>Rising with Bounties of a Gen'rous QUEEN.</L>
<L>O! had the Muse there fledg'd her Infant Wing,</L>
<L>And early tasted of that learned Spring;</L>
<L>She then had soar'd in more Heroic lays,</L>
<L>In more majestic Numbers sung your Praise,</L>
<L>But fearful now, must quit the glorious Theme,</L>
<L>Must leave the Architect to speak your Fame,</L>
<L>His Art, shall there, another <HI>Athens</HI> shew,</L>
<L>And there, another GUARDIAN <HI>Pallas</HI> YOU.</L>
