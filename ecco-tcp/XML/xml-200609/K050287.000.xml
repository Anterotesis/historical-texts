<P>AN

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Subject I have here under∣taken
is so Nice, and a plain
treating of it so Difficult, so Dan∣gerous,
and especially in me so
liable to the Censures of Prejudices on both
Sides, that it has been with some Hesitati∣on
that I go about it.</P>
<P>Not that I am so Solicitous of whom I
please or displease, in my handling this
Nice▪ Affair; for he that is so, can never
speak with an impartial Freedom; a Liber∣ty
absolutely necessary to the clear stating
Things of doubtful Acceptation, and a
Liberty which when I cease to preserve
to my self, I shall cease to write at all.</P>
<P>It is very hard with me in this Case,
more than with any other Author; in that,
whereas others are wary in what they
Write, for fear of displeasing the Govern∣ment,
and irritating Men in Power; my▪
Difficulty is a Clamour raised by them, who
without Arrogance I may▪ say, cannot
Confute me, pretending that I am too Care∣ful
to please Men in Power; in which as
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> said of his <HI>Whore,</HI> I
have the Scandal without the Joy, the Re∣proach
without the Profit of the Charge:
But as the same Men brought the same
Charge, when the other Party was in
Power, and thought it as much a Crime,
I appeal to all the World, what heed ought
to be given to their Censure; I only intro∣duce
this with a brief Challenge to them,
let them find any change of Principle in all
I have written, if they can; and if what I
wrote under the late Ministry and under
this Ministry, agrees, it must be some Bo∣dy
else that has changed Principle, not me,
let the Issue determine it.</P>
<P>I would be glad to please every Body;
but my Aim is to speak Truth with Ho∣nesty;
if it please no Body, I am not Soli∣citous,
so it be but Truth and Honesty: 
he that can say it is not, let him stand forth
and be seen; he that cannot contradict the
Truth I speak, will have but small Success
in Calumniating the Honesty with which I
speak it.</P>
<P>And yet I had not entred now upon this
Subject, but that the Writers of the Town
(according to the Usage I have some
Years been treated with) laying all their
Bastards at my Door, and almost every
Book being called mine, as well of one
Side as the other, I thought my self a
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
little obliged to declare my self, and let
you all know my Notions of Things, with
my Name to them, that I may no longer
bear the Scandals of the present Filth of
the Press, (with Pardon for that Expression.)</P>
<P>Hitherto I have said nothing on the Sub∣ject,
nor do I purpose to say any thing but
what I will fairly own and defend; and
that I hope, may answer the People who
call every thing they don't like by my
Name.</P>
<P>I am not apt to make Apologies, and I
entreat the Reader to place this Imperti∣nence
to the account of the Ages Follies,
which oblige me to it, in Order to Defend
my self from a Charge so Unjust, as that
of being the Author of Books which I ne∣ver
gave my self the Trouble so much as
to read.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE, (without other En∣comiums)
it is sufficient to say,
merits every Man's Approbati∣on,
and tho' the whole Town is
agitated and angry about it; yet
no Man will be found among us, but what
will readily own he is for PEACE.</P>
<P>It would be happy for us all, if we
could talk of Peace with a little more of
it in our Tempers, that we could be at
Peace when we pretend to desire Peace;
it is to me the strangest Thing in the
World, that we are all falling together by
the Ears, and making War about Peace.
If you talk of one Man, who otherwise
we lik'd well enough, hang him, he is a
Rogue, he is come over, <HI>he is for Peace.</HI>
The other Side are even with us, and
they talking with this or that Acquain∣tance;
who? <HI>Tom...</HI> or <HI>Jack?...</HI> Ay,
He is an Honest Fellow enough, a good
Natur'd Fellow enough, but he is got in
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
with these furious People, he is all for
Blood, nothing but carrying on the War,
and pushing all things to Extremities;
Death and Destruction are always in his
Mouth, he is Mad if you do but talk of
Peace to him.</P>
<P>Unhappy Nation! What End can these
Things lead us to? Not a Publick Socie∣ty,
not a Coffee-house, not a Meeting of
Friends, not a Visit; but like <HI>Jehu</HI> to <HI>Jeza∣bel,
who is on my Side?</HI> Who? Who is
for Peace? Who is for carrying on the
War? Society is converted into Cabal,
all Publick Meetings appear sorted into
Committees, or bandyed into Sides as their
Notions of Peace or War encline them.</P>
<P>I cannot but make one brief Observati∣on,
which may have some Philosophy in
it; and I dare say it is all natural; the
Note may have its Uses in it, which eve∣ry
one may improve as they see fit. When
you find Men sitting in a Publick Room,
say a Coffee-house, or Tavern, and talking
of the Publick, Two to One of my Mo∣ney,
before you hear a Word they say that
I tell you at first who are for Peace, and
who are for War. The Gentlemen who are
for PEACE, you hear them but at a small
Distance, their Voices are low, their Speech
deliberate, their Words are soft, calm; and
spoken easie like the Subject they speak of
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The other Side that are for War, you
may hear them into the Street, or down
the Stairs, their Voices are Thunder; they
speak the Word War with something of
the Noise of War, as if they were giving
in the Field the Word of Command, or
bidding a Platoon give Fire. Again, look
in their Faces, the Men of Peace have it
in their Countenances, their Faces are co∣vered
with Smiles, a sort of Calm and
Smoothness of Temper sits on their Brow;
they look pleased and serence, like the Spi∣rit
that possesses them. The Men that
are for War seem in a Ferment, their Eyes
sparkle, something Boisterous appears in
their Faces, they look as uneasie as they
talk, and the aversion they have to Peace,
shows it self in their Countenances; some
cross Lines seem to be drawn over their
Faces, by which they discover the Tem∣per
they stand in as to the Thing that
they have in Debate.</P>
<P>Well however, come near to these Gentle∣men,
and Argue closely with them, and you
shall find them all join in this, that Peace in
its general Acceptation is a Blessing, which
no Man can have a real stated Aversion to;
the Off-spring of Heaven, and an Emblem of
Eternal Blessedness; no Man can open his
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth against Peace, <HI>as such;</HI> nor are the
Gentlemen I am speaking of, who are a∣gainst
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Peace at this Time, against it in this
Sense; let no Man mistake me, I am not
writing a Satyr against any Body. 'Tis the
unhappy Circumstances of the present Na∣tional
Temper, <HI>that I am speaking of,</HI> that we
are uneasie to one another, Differing, Dis∣puting,
Caballing, and sometimes down∣right
Quarelling, <HI>and about what?</HI> Not Peace
in General, no, every one is for that; but
the Peace now to be treated of between the
Confederates and the King of <HI>France,</HI> that's
the Uneasiness.</P>
<P>Nor <HI>to do every one Justice</HI> is the Que∣stion
among us, whether we shall make
Peace with <HI>France</HI> or no; every Man of
Sense, every Man of Principle, every Man
that has any knowledg of the Circum∣stances
of the Nation, or Concern for its
Prosperity and Happiness, wishes for Peace,
no Man will say that he is not for Peace;
the very War is made for Peace; it is the
Condition of every Manifesto, every De∣claration,
all the Alliances, all the Articles
of the Confederacies, which lay down the
Causes and Beginnings of the War, are full
of it. Peace, Peace; to restore the Tran∣quility
of <HI>Europe,</HI> to restore the Liberty of
<HI>Europe,</HI> to restore the Ballance of Power
in <HI>Europe,</HI> the whole War turns upon this
Point. And to be very plain, the Justice,
the Honour, and the Reputation of the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Confederacy can be supported, and defend∣ed
upon no other Foundation, nothing else
can justifie the Allies for taking up Arms,
neither do they pretend to any other Justifi∣cation
of it; <HI>the Word is,</HI> the Necessity they
are driven to, there being no other way left
them to obtain Peace. Indeed, no War is
just, but what is made for Peace; no∣thing
but Peace can make War lawful.
So that Peace being the only thing pre∣tended
to in the undertaking this War, for
any Man to say they do not desire Peace,
is to say, they Fight as the Great <HI>Turk</HI>
does, for his Pleasure, for Encrease of his
Dominions, for Conquest, and the extend∣ing
his Power; which is just as much to be
Defended as the Pyrates of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> or
as Robbing on the Highway, and no other∣wise.</P>
<P>But
to come to the Point, the particular
Objection lies another way; it is not a
Peace in General that our People object
against, but the Nature and Circumstances
of the Peace; and here we give the <HI>Peace</HI>
an <HI>Epithet,</HI> which requires some Enquiry
into; A GOOD PEACE, this is the
Distinction, this alone it is that our whole
Dispute turns upon, and the Exposition of
the true Meaning, or Acceptation of this
Word, is the Subject of this Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
A GOOD PEACE say the Objectors
we are all for, but not such a Peace as you
would have, or as you would make; and
this is the state of the Case. Two Men quar∣relling
together in this Town, One a <HI>West</HI>
Countryman, the other a <HI>North</HI> Country∣man;
among some Scurrility that past be∣tween
them, says <HI>West</HI> to his Antagonist,
I am no <HI>Yorkshireman;</HI> why, says <HI>North,
What have you to say to</HI> Yorkshire? Are
there not a great many Honest Men in
<HI>Yorkshire?</HI> I would have you know, <HI>There
are as Honest Men in</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>as in any
Part of</HI> England; Ay, ay, says <HI>West,</HI> that
may be true for ought I know; <HI>but that is
called Honesty in</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>which is not
Honesty in other Places.</HI></P>
<P>This is something like our Case; as one
Sort who are charg'd with being against
Peace justifie themselves, and say no, we
are not against Peace, but are for <HI>a
Good Peace</HI> or none. So those on the other
Side, who are for Peace say, they are for
no Peace but <HI>a Good Peace</HI> also. But the
Case will lye very much here, and indeed
only here, whether that is not called a
Good Peace by one Side, which is not
called a Good Peace by the other; and so
we are brought down by both Parties to
the great Enquiry, which is the Subject of
the present Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/><HI>What is to be understood, by a GOOD
PEACE?</HI></P>
<P>In pursuing this Enquiry impartially, it
will come of course that we consider the
Mistakes which People are naturally led in∣to
about this Question, and the various
Constructions which the Men of this Day
are pleased to put upon this Word; which
Construction varies as Interest, Party and
Opinion leads them.</P>
<P>I shall not spend Time to enquire how
it comes to pass, that there are at this
time such Mistakes, and so many Opini∣ons
upon so plain a Question; and how a
Nation so clear-sighted as we are, comes
to see with such differing Views, put such
a differing Sense upon a Word of such
Consequence at such a Time as this. For
really the unhappy Breach of Parties a∣mong
us, and the Prejudices which con∣stantly
attend those Party-Divisions, give
us but too plain a Method how to account
for them: And it must be, that Men be∣ing
blinded by their Passions, and
their Prejudices, are deprived of the clear,
and uninterruped Use of their Judgment,
give their Opinions with partiality, as the
several Interests of the Parties they es∣pouse
influence their Judgments.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
To come at a right understanding of
what we call <HI>a good Peace,</HI> it seems necessa∣ry,
with plainness and freedom, to lay
down a little Historically the State of the
War as it respects <HI>Britain,</HI> and her Allies;
and this I shall do as plainly and briefly as
I can.</P>
<P>After the Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> for I shall go
back no farther; the King of <HI>France</HI> hav∣ing
recognized King <HI>William,</HI> settled all the
Reunions, and surrendred to the Confede∣rates
what was agreed to be Surrendred;
<HI>Europe</HI> had a pleasing Prospect of a happy
and a lasting Peace; there was but one
Event which had any thing in it Fatal, or
Threatning to the Tranquility of this Part
of the World, and this was the Death of
<HI>Charles</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain</HI> without Issue;
which tho' it was not then happened, yet
it was probable could not be far off.
However, to prevent the Evil Consequen∣ces
which such an Event might bring up∣on
<HI>Europe;</HI> and as the Preamble to the
Treaties of Partition says to <HI>prevent a new
War:</HI> The Two Kings of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> with the States-General, entred in∣to
a Convention or Treaty, for bringing
all the Claims, and Pretensions to that Suc∣cession
to a Ballance, this is the so much
controverted Treaty, called <HI>The Treaty of
Partition;</HI> in the Preamble to which, are
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
the following Words relating to what I
am now treating of.</P>
<Q>Be it known to all who shall see these Pre∣sents,
That the most Serene and most
Mighty Prince <HI>Lewis XIV. &amp;c.</HI> And
the most Serene and most Mighty Prince
<HI>William III. &amp;c.</HI> And the States-Gene∣ral,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Desiring nothing more Hearti∣ly,
than to strengthen by New Engage∣ments,
the good Intelligence re-established
between them, (<HI>there is keeping up the
Peace they had made</HI>) and to prevent
by Measures taken in Time, the Events
that might raise new Wars in <HI>Europe,</HI>
have to that End, <HI>&amp;c. (There's Safety
against future Troubles) and so he
goes on to the Articles of the Partiti∣on.</HI>
Vide <HI>Treaty,</HI> Page 381.</Q>
<P>After the end of this Transaction, <HI>Europe</HI>
was in a perfect Tranquility, I mean as to
Nations; for as to Peace at Home, God knows
we enjoy'd less of it than ever. But Hea∣ven
healed our needless Breaches, by ma∣king
two real Breaches upon us; and find∣ing
the Nation Sick, and Surfeited with the
little Peace we had; he visited us with a
New War, and the Death of the King.</P>
<P>The New War began purely on the
<HI>French</HI> side, who made himself Agressor by
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
two Steps taken in a direct Contravention to
the Solemn Treaties he had made; tho' those
Treaties were ratify'd, and exchang'd in
due Form, and so fairly executed, that
<HI>Europe,</HI> and especially <HI>England</HI> entirely dis∣arm'd,
laid by their Fleets, and broke their
Troops, reducing the Establishment of
Forces to the Stint or Limitation of a pro∣found
Peace.</P>
<P>The two Steps, <HI>I speak of,</HI> which the
<HI>French</HI> took to break this Peace, were (1.)
The Owning, Declaring, and Compliment∣ing
the Pretender by the Stile and Titles due
to King <HI>William,</HI> as King of <HI>England, Scot∣land</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> notwithstanding the Article
in the Treaty of <HI>Reswick,</HI> by which he had
before acknowledg'd King <HI>William.</HI> (2.) The
other, was the Seizing and Taking Possession
of the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, by Virtue of
a Will, or pretended Will of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
to the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> and declaring the said
Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> King of <HI>Spain, &amp;c.</HI> notwith∣standing
his Agreement and solemn Ratifica∣tion
of the Treaty of Partition then in Force.</P>
<P>These things produced a War as Univer∣sal
to this Part of <HI>Europe</HI> as ever was engag'd
in; which has now been carry'd on Nine
Year and 6 Months, from <HI>May</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> 1701.
to <HI>Octob.</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> 1711. Of the Successes
and probable End of which I need not en∣large
here, it may come to be spoken of
again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
I must do his most Christian Majesty
that Justice, as to say, I never saw or heard,
that in all his Manifestoes or Declarations
of, or concerning this War, he ever stoop'd
to give many Reasons, why he took either
of the Steps, except only his own Will
and Pleasure, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>so he had thought
fit to do; (viz.)</HI> We have thought fit ra∣ther
to accept the said Gift of the late King
<HI>Charles</HI> to Our said Grandson, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—and
we have thought fit to salute the said Prince
(meaning the Pretender) by such and such
Titles, and the like.</P>
<P>But the more his Majesty thought fit to
take those unccommon Steps, and the less
Reason he was pleased to give for them,
the greater and the juster Reasons they
were, why the Confedetates should enter
again into that War which was the Conse∣quence
of it; and this is evidently taken
hold of in that Sense by the <HI>English</HI> and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> in their Respective Declarations of
War, as follows:</P>
<P>Whereas, instead of giving the Satisfaction
that ought justly to be expected, the <HI>French</HI>
King has added thereunto (<HI>Note, that is, unto
the Seizing the</HI> Spanish <HI>Monarchy</HI>) a great
Affront and Indignity to US and Our King∣doms,
in taking upon him to declare the <HI>Pre∣tended
Prince of Wales,</HI> King of <HI>England,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and has also influenc'd
<HI>Spain</HI> to concur in the same Affront and Indig∣nity;
we find Our Selves obliged for maintain∣ing
the Publick Faith for Vindicating the Ho∣nour
of Our Crown, and to prevent the Mischiefs
which all <HI>Europe</HI> is threatned with, <HI>to declare
War,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I recapitulate these things, because from
these Foundations will best be inferr'd what
ought to be esteem'd by all the Confe∣derates,
A GOOD PEACE; which is bring∣ing
it down to the Case before me, and of
which I shall speak again in its Course.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>France</HI> had <HI>thought fit,</HI>
as above, to take these two Steps, <HI>Europe</HI>
immediately broke out into a Flame, the
People of <HI>England</HI> resented in a particular
Manner, the Affront put upon their King, in
the King of <HI>France</HI> setting up a Pretender
against him, after he had solemnly own'd
his Title, and made Treaties with him as
King; and Addresses flow'd from all Parts
of the Kingdom to the King, expressing
their Detestation of that Treatment, and
pressing His Majesty to a War.</P>
<P>The other Allies, as much resenting the
King of <HI>France</HI>'s sezing upon the Monar∣chy
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and setting up his Grandson
<HI>Philip</HI> V. prepar'd for War also upon that
Account. Upon these mutual Grievances,
was form'd the Treaty call'd the <HI>Grand
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Alliance;</HI> in which the particular Demands
of the Allies, without which it is made
Unlawful for them on either Hand, to make
Peace, are particularly stipulated; with
this express Condition also, <Q REND="inline">"That it shall
not be lawful to any of the Confederates
to treat of Peace with the Enemy, without
the mutual Assent and Advice of the rest of
the Confederates."</Q>—And here again you
may have a stated Foundation for what we
ought to call <HI>a Good Peace.</HI> Nor is there in
any of these things, any feign'd Constru∣ction,
or forc'd Sense, by which any one
can be led to make the Terms of Peace,
more or less: For this, like the Statutes of
a Nation, is the Rule to go by.—<HI>To the
Law, and to the Testimony,</HI> was the Word of
of Old: To the Grand Alliance, and to the
Declaration of the Reasons of the War, is
the Word with me, and I believe will be
so with all Impartial Men in the World—Here
is the Cause of your making War;
here is your declar'd Resolution when it
shall End, and 'till when it shall not End;
and when these Ends are answer'd, the
Causes, the Reason, and the Original Mo∣tion
of the Grand Alliance cease.</P>
<P>And here I must touch a very nice Point,
and which yet I shall do plainly, and with Re∣spect,
I shall be the last Man in <HI>Britain</HI> that
shall endeavour to lessen the Duty and Re∣gard
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
that the People of this Nation ought
to pay to the Votes, Opinion or Declara∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions
of the Parliament, which is our
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue Representative, and whose Actions are
our own.—But speaking in the Language
of the Confederacy, I say, with humble
Submission, no Vote, no Address, no de∣clar'd
Opinion of the Parliament, as to
the Terms of the Peace, can alter at all the
Foundation of the War, or bind the rest
of the Confederates beyond the Obliga∣tions
they are under, by Virtue of the Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iances
and Stipulations of Confederacy they
are already engag'd in.</P>
<P>Thus as it is not in the Power of any of
the Confederates, legally to make Peace,
or treat of Peace, without common Con∣sent,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> So neither is it in the Power of
any of the Confederates to impose farther
Conditions upon the rest, or to say we will
not make Peace, unless such or such things
be obtain'd, although those things are not
express'd in the said Grand Alliance, which
is the only obligatory Limitation of Peace
and War.</P>
<P>To explain my self yet farther, with all
posible Respect and Regard to the Confe∣derates;
if any one of the Confederates, or
the States or Parliament of their Country
should Vote or Declare, That no Peace
should be made with <HI>France,</HI> till such or
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
such Conditions were obtain'd, were it put∣ting
the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy into such
or such Hands as they please to name; if such
Conditions are not express'd in the Grand
Alliance, I humbly conceive the rest of the
Confederates are not oblig'd by that Vote.</P>
<P>I come still nearer to the Point, for as
I hope, I say nothing offensive, so I need
cover it with no Allegory or Similies, for I
hate Disguises.—Our Parliament Voted, and
Addressed, and gave it as their Opinion;
and her Majesty concurr'd with that Opi∣nion,
That no Peace could be Safe and
Honourable, while any Part of the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy remain'd in the Possession of the
House of <HI>Bourbon.</HI>—</P>
<P>But if this is neither express'd or imply'd
in the said Grand Alliance, which is the
Compact and the binding Principle of the
War, I leave it to any impartial Hand to
make out, how far would these Votes or Ad∣dresses
be binding upon the rest of the Con∣federates.</P>
<P>This
is to me an unanswerable Proof,
that the <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> is the Test, the
Foundation to judge of the Condition of
the Peace by; and whatever Treaty a∣mouns
to, or gives to us, all that is agreed
to be demanded by that Treaty, may be
called A GOOD PEACE, tho' it should
not come up to the future Opinions of any
set of People whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
From the Votes and Addresses of the
<HI>British</HI> Parliament, I come to the <HI>late Treaty,</HI>
if it be proper to call it a Treaty, of the
Preliminaries settled at the <HI>Hague</HI> by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Torcy,</HI> and the Plenipotentiaries of the
Allies.</P>
<P>If by these Preliminaries, the Confede∣rates
push'd <HI>France</HI> to a farther Length than
the Treaty of <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> had concerted,
well and good; my Answer is this,
<Q><P>If the Confederates thought they had
found an Opportunity to gain more of
<HI>France</HI> than they had set as the negative
Bounds of Peace, no Body can blame
them, especially if they had obtained it;
I believe every Honest Man wishes
with me, they had obtain'd it. <HI>But I will
not say for this,</HI> that no Peace on less
Conditions than those <HI>Preliminaries,</HI>
provided within the limits declar'd by
the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> would have been
A GOOD PEACE.</P>
<P>As to the Objection which some make,
<HI>viz.</HI> That by their insisting on those
extraordinary Advantages they lost all
the rest, and push'd the King of <HI>France</HI>
to Extremeties, which made him choose
to run all Risques, rather than com∣ply
with them; and that they might
have had as much as the <HI>Grand Alli∣ance</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
required, and as much as they
had pretended to one another to make
War for. As to this I say, they are none
of the Objections I am upon, nor are
they of any Use to the present Pur∣pose.</P></Q></P>
<P>The
Question before me is, What is the
proper Foundation of A GOOD PEACE
at this time? To which my Answer is, as
before, <HI>The Grand Alliance</HI> is the Test of <HI>a
Good Peace;</HI> yet as much more as you can,
I will never be the Complainer: But I dare
not say, that when what is there demand∣ed,
can be obtain'd, you have any just Rea∣son
to carry on the War to obtain more;
at least, unless all the Confederates agree
to do so; for nothing beyond it can be
Obligatory upon the whole.</P>
<P>It remains then, that all which shall be
said farther relating to a Peace, must be a
Comment upon this Text.</P>
<P>There is an Event happened since the
making that Alliance, which in that Alli∣ance
there is no Provision made for; and
which, had it been foreseen, the Allies no
doubt, would have made some proper Arti∣cle
to have settled, This is the Death of the
Emperor; and this Accident may give us
Room to enquire, Whether it does not make
some needful Alterations in the Terms on
which we are to insist for Peace?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
My Answer is plain, <HI>I wish some People
would bear with my plainness;</HI> I say it does
not: And here without Fear, or Regard to
Power, or Parties, I shall say some Things
which I do believe will startle Man kind a
little in this Case; at least, if we consider
the popular Notions which spread among us.</P>
<P>We have been push'd on, to set up the
taking <HI>Spain</HI> from King <HI>Philip,</HI> as the
REST or Stay of the Confederates; as
a Thing that we are all ruin'd and undone
without; and the Parliament Vote, Ad∣dress,
and Declare their Opinion, as be∣fore,
That <HI>no Peace can be Safe, or Honou∣rable
without it.</HI> And yet I must tell you,</P>
<P>There is not one Word of Recovering all
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, out of the Hands of
the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> in all the Grand Al∣liance;
so that none of the Confederates
are under any Obligations to go that par∣ticular
Length, and not make Peace with∣out
it.</P>
<P>My Argument turns upon this Point
then, of which this is the Abstract:
<Q><P>A Peace may be Honourable, if made
according to the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance;</P>
<P>But the Recovering all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy
from the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> is
no part of the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance:</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Therefore a Peace may be Honourable,
tho' some part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monar∣chy
should remain to the House of
<HI>Bourbon.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>If in this way of Arguing, I am put to
prove the Assumption, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>That a Peace
may be Honourable, if made according to the
Tenour of the Grand Alliance;</HI> I make it out
thus: The Grand Alliance is a Conventi∣on
of all the Allies, declaring all the Grie∣vances
for which they make War, and on
what Terms only they will make Peace.</P>
<P>If all the Reasons inducing the War are
answered, and all the Demands upon
which the War is Declar'd are obtain'd,
it can be no longer Just to make War;
when it is no longer Just to make War, it
is Just we should make Peace; and what∣soever
is Just in this Case, is Honourable.</P>
<P>I return to the Grand Alliance, <HI>I say,</HI>
There is not one Word of the Terms of
Peace, which are mentioned in the Ad∣dress
of the Parliament, to be found in the
Grand Alliance.</P>
<P>The Terms of Peace limitted by the
Grand Alliance are these, and none but these.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An equitable and reasonable Security to
his Imperial Majesty, for his Pretensions
to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Succession.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A particular and sufficient Security of
the Kingdoms, Provinces, Dominions,
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Navigation and Commerce for the Sub∣jects
of his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and
the States General. <HI>See for this, the

<P>The Observation therefore is <HI>not mine
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly,</HI> it is the Nature of the thing; let any
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne tell me how from hence does it ap∣pear,
that we must fight particularly till
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot one Branch of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emain to the House of <HI>Bourbone,</HI> or that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Peace will be neither Safe nor Honou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able
without it.</P>
<Q><P>2. I do farther say, and I appeal to the
Knowledge of all who were then in
the Management of Things, That it
was in part, and in private agreed, If
the King of <HI>France</HI> had complied with
the Evacuating Article, as proposed at
<HI>Ghertruydenberg;</HI> That to save <HI>Europe,</HI>
the farther Distractions of the War,
and prevent the Effusion of Blood,
some small Allotment should have
been made to King <HI>Philip</HI> V. and this
Allotment was in their Eye; and ac∣cording
to what appear'd, was to be
<HI>Scicily, Sardinia, Corstca, &amp;c.</HI>—Now
this was part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy,
and <HI>Philip</HI> was of the House of <HI>Bourbon.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
The Consequence of this must the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be, according to the Parliaments Ad∣dress,
That they would have made
Peace which was neither <HI>Safe nor Ho∣nourable.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Nor was this all; But, 3. The Parlia∣ment
was kept at hand by small Adjourn∣ments,
in order, if need were, to have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Necessity of receding from that Vote, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Address, or Opinion, call it what you will
in order to a Peace, made appear, <HI>These ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Things which I say may startle Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, pray let me ask, Doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Vote, or Opinion of the Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
make the Conditions of a Peace Safe and
Honourable? Or is it so in the Consequence
and by the Nature of the thing it self? I de∣sire
to pay a just Deference to the Opinion
of Parliaments, but never against the Rea∣son
and Nature of Things.</P>
<P>Again, the Parliament was to have been
desir'd if it had been found necessary, to
have receded from that Vote,—What
would they have said to the Houses? Would
they have ask'd them to Vote for a Peace,
which was in their Opinion, not <HI>Safe or
Honourable?</HI> No, no, they would have al∣ledged,
That such and such things being
agreed, it was judg'd both Safe and Honou∣rable,
and the House must have been de∣sir'd
to alter their Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
And now, Gentlemen, let no Man mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake
me, I am not reflecting on the late
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inistry in this, or on the late Parliament;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is what they ought to have done: No

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pinions of Men must alter, and Reason
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quires that they should alter their Opini∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns; let them be Kings, Queens, Parlia∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents,
or any Body of Men in the World.</P>
<P>This was the Case in the Treaty of Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion;
what pass'd upon that Affair, I need
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot repeat: But if such a Treaty should yet
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found necessary, I make no Question, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall be yet voted Safe and Honourable; all
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther and former Opinions to the contrary
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any wise notwithstanding.</P>
<P>I have hinted this, because I know our
People run away with it, That the Parlia∣ment

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t as their Opinion, That no Peace can be
<HI>good,</HI> i. e. <HI>Safe</HI> and <HI>Honourable,</HI> but as
before, that all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy be
taken from the House of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> and that
therefore this only is the Test of A GOOD
PEACE, which I think is fairly, and I hope
modestly too, confuted.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do in this Discourse,
with whom this or that Part of the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Monarchy should be given to▪ I am
upon the General, and with all Humble
Submission to Parliaments Addresses An∣swers,
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
That I think it appears with a <HI>Non ob∣stante</HI>
to what of that Kind has past, <HI>viz.</HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Safe and Honourable Peace may be made▪
tho' every Branch of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy
should not be recovered from the House of
<HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P>This I lay down as my General.</P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this Head, without ob∣serving
two Things, which being rightly
understood, will take off all that any one
may think in this is reflecting upon the late
Parliament.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>as the Case stood then,</HI> that Vote
was agreeable to the State of Things
in the World; and to the Prospect the
Confederates had before them, both
of the Possibility of that Conquest, and
of the Necessity of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>as the Case stands now,</HI> it is
more than probable, that same Par∣liament,
in the same Interest, and
with the same Designs, would have
been of another Opinion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Alteration of Circumstances must for
ever be allow'd to be a Reason for Altera∣tion
of Opinion, in all Cases in the World;
nor is it any Reproach to the Wisdom or
Integrity of that Parliament, to say, That
what might be absolutely necessary then,
may be otherwise now.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
I am none of them that leave my Readers
to guess at Cases, or need that any one
should ask, <HI>What</HI> are these Alterations of
Circumstances which have happened since,
and which make this Difference, or whether,
and how it is more safe to leave part of the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy in the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI>
now, than it was before?</P>
<P><HI>My Answer is direct,</HI> The Revolution which
has happened in the House of <HI>Austria</HI> since
that time, whereby the Imperial Crown' is
fallen to the same Person to whom was
then allotted the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> is the
Alteration which I speak of; and I cannot
but believe, that according to the Treaty
of Partition, and according to the receiv'd
Opinion of <HI>Europe,</HI> for some Ages, it would
never be judged Safe that the Crown of
<HI>Spain</HI> should ever be permitted to be given
to the Person of an Emperor, any more
than of a King of <HI>France.</HI>—This is an
Opinion founded upon all the Principles of
Safety, which the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> have
acted upon for above 70 Years past, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>The Balance of Power,</HI> which by such a
Coalition or Conjunction of Power would
be entirely broken and dissolved.</P>
<P>Will any Man believe of the last parli∣ament,
that they would have been of the
Opinion, to have given the whole <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy to the Person of an Emperor of
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<HI>Germany?</HI> Will any man say, that no Peace
can be <HI>Safe</HI> or <HI>Honourable,</HI> but what shall
put all the Dominions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown
into the Hands of <HI>Charles</HI> VI.? It is not Dis∣honourable
Account to give of his Imperial
Majesty, to say it would make him too
Great for the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> to be easie un∣der;
I think I might be allow'd to say the
same of the Queen of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But I meet with an Objection here,
which should be spoken to, (<HI>viz.)</HI> What
is this to the Purpose? The Parliaments
Vote is not upon <HI>who you shall give it to,</HI> but
who you shall <HI>take it from;</HI> not <HI>who shall</HI>
have it, but <HI>who shall not</HI> have it. To this
Cavil, <HI>for it is no more,</HI> I answer, that nei∣ther
do I say who <HI>should</HI> have it, but who
<HI>should not;</HI> and let this lie for those to
Answer to whom it belongs: I know the
Question is invidious and ensnaring; and
tho' I could Answer it, I believe, Effectual∣ly,
and to Satisfaction, yet it is not to our
Purpose here, and for that Reason I wave it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Two Negatives</HI> lye before us; The
House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> must not have it, say the
Addresses. The Nature of the Things says
<HI>Now,</HI> the Person you would have given
it to, must not have it; <HI>What then will
you do with it?</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me home to the Original
Question, What is to be called A GOOD
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
PEACE? As then I have thus stated the
Question, I shall come to a direct An∣swer
as freely as possible.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>alone</HI> can be A GOOD PEACE,
where none of the Parties are vested
with so much Power as overthrows
the Balance of <HI>Europe.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>alone</HI> can be A GOOD PEACE,
wherein the Great Articles of the
Grand Alliance, which were the Be∣ginning,
and are the Foundation of
the War, are fully answered.</ITEM>

<P>In these two Generals are comprised all
the Particulars, which require any Ex∣planation
in this Affair.</P>

<ITEM>1. None of the several Parties are to be

the Ballance of <HI>Europe;</HI> that
this would be the Case of the <HI>Spanish</HI>

Person of a King of <HI>France,</HI> or of an

is wellcome.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
1. <HI>The King of</HI> France: His most Christi∣an
Majesty very frankly acknowleges
for his part, That it is <HI>not Safe for Eu∣rope,</HI>
that the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> should
be enjoy'd by the SAME PERSON
who is King of <HI>France,</HI> this you have
in the Proposals of Peace, made in his
Name, and now under Consideration,
Signed by Monsieur <HI>Mesnager</HI> as fol∣lows;</P>
<P>That he will freely and <HI>bonâ fide</HI> con∣sent,
to the takeing of all just and reaso∣nable
Measures, for hindring that the
Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> may never
be united on the Head of the same Prince;
His Majesty being perswaded that this
Excess of Power would be contrary to the
Good and Quiet of <HI>Europe.</HI> Vide <HI>the
11th Proposal.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The late King</HI> William: His Majesty,
Declares in the Solemn Treaty be∣tween
<HI>England, Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
called <HI>The Second Treaty of Partition;</HI>
That that Treaty being made for the
Good and Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to
prevent future Wars between the
Confdeerates therein named, That the
Crown of <HI>Sqain</HI> should never come to
be enjoy'd by the Person of an Empe∣ror,
or a King of <HI>France,</HI> in these
Words;</P>

in like manner, the said Share of the

or belong to the Person of a Prince,
that is or shall be King, or Dauphine

<P>Thus you have the Royal Authority of
both these Crown'd Heads, to prove what
I have asserted in the First General.</P>
<P>2. That <HI>alone</HI> can be A GOOD
PEACE wherein the Great Articles
of the Grand Alliance, which were
the Beginning, and are the Founda∣tion
of the War, are fully answer'd.</P>
<P>For Evidence of this, we need go no far∣ther
than the Grand Alliance it self.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
The Terms of the Grand Alliance, are these:</P>
<P>1. <HI REND="blackletterType">That an Equitable and Reasonable Sa∣tisfaction
be given to his Imperial
Majesty, for his Pretension to the</HI>Spa∣nish <HI REND="blackletterType">Succession.</HI> Vide Grand Alliance,
<HI>Artic.</HI> 11.</P>
<P><HI>Note, here,</HI> If the Allies had understood
that the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy had de∣volv'd
to him as his Right, let me ask
these Questions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Why is it called SATISFACTION
FOR the Succession? Why is it not
rather said, 'Till he be put into POS∣SESSION
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy?
It would certainly have been express'd
otherwise, if it had been meant, He
should ever possess it <HI>as Emperor.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Why is it call'd his Imperial Majesty's
<HI>Pretension to the Succession,</HI> and yet put
into the Hands of his Brother King
<HI>Charles?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I must be excus'd making two Remarks
upon this: 1. Satisfaction for the Succes∣sion
plainly infers, His Imperial Majesty
was never understood to be the Person that
should succeed? It would never else have
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
been called <HI>Satisfaction for it.</HI> This implies an
Equivalent with which he was to be satis∣fied
instead of it, and plainly acknowledges,
that the Confederrates never dreamt of ma∣king
an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> to be also King
of <HI>Spain.</HI> 2. Whereas it is called his Impe∣rial
Majesty's Right of Succession, why,
then was it given to King <HI>Charles?</HI> It is
evident, this transferring the Crown by
Gift to King <HI>Charles</HI> III. at the same time
that we exploded King <HI>Charles</HI> II. devising
it by Gift to King <HI>Philip,</HI> was but an odd
Title, and gave such a Handle to Confirm
<HI>K. Philip</HI>'s Right (his Gift being prior to the
other) as I never yet could see answer'd. But
waving that which I have formerly insisted
on, and which is now no more a Question,
the Emperor being dead. This Argu∣ment
may be drawn from it, which I be∣lieve
can never be answer'd; That the Em∣peror
demitted his Right to his Brother,
because it never could be allow'd tolerable,
nor so much as to be thought of, that ever
the Allies would agree, an Emperor of
<HI>Germany</HI> should have it, as the very same
Foundation of Exorbitance which they
were then declaring and fighting against in
the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> then, and the Em∣peror
finding that on both Sides, the taking
the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to themselves, would
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
not go down with the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> they
respectively put a Third Person in the Place.
<HI>Philip,</HI> and <HI>Charles,</HI> and both of them,
claim the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> by Gift, neither
having any real Title.</P>
<P>Fate now has decided the Point on one
Side, for King <HI>Charles</HI> is taken out of the
Contention, and made Emperor.—Can he
then be King of <HI>Spain?</HI> Certainly, by any
of the former Notions of <HI>Europe,</HI> he can ne∣ver
be so received.—Well, what is next?
Have we any other Branch of the House of
<HI>Austria</HI> to make a Gift to? If we have, let
us see him; if we have not, what follows,
but to make such a Treaty as in which the
Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> may be secured, and such
Powers erected as may reciprocally prevent
either the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> or <HI>Austria,</HI>
overrunning <HI>Europe;</HI> and this I shall call A
GOOD PEACE, let who will find out the
Medium to bring it to pass.—</P>
<P>The first thing I shall hint from this Ob∣sevation,
is—This makes me easie, and I
believe, if consider'd, would make us all
easie on the Subject of a Treaty.</P>
<P>Let who will be the Agents, let what
will be the Proposals, the Nature of the
thing is such, no Party can suggest that we
should not have a Regard to <HI>the Balance of
Europe;</HI> no Peace can be treated on, but
upon this Foot: The establishing some Rule
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
of Power, some Generals for the Boun∣daries
of National Interest, such as may li∣mit
the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and prevent fu∣ture
Encroachments one upon another.</P>
<P>For this Reason, I cannot but think we
should all be willing to come to talk of
these things—Certainly, to Treat of them,
can be of no prejudice; nor can I allow it
to be a good Argument, to say, That the
<HI>French</HI> always gain upon us by a Treaty.
This is to call all the Confederates Fools,
and say, they do not know what they
would have; that they make War for they
know not what; that they have Generals
to fight, but no States Men to treat; that
they have Hands, but no Heads; and that
all <HI>Europe</HI> are not able to maintain their Ar∣guments
against Five <HI>French</HI>-Men, Plenipo∣tentiaries.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> make Proposals; they would
put by the Way of treating by Prelimina∣ries,
and come to a General Treaty at once;
And why should we not venture them at a
Treaty? We can insist upon every thing at
a General Treaty, as well as at a particular,
and can stand to all the necessary Points of
the Grand Alliance, as well there as at an∣other
time.</P>
<P>The treating brings us not the nearer;
if <HI>France</HI> does not come up to reasonable
Things, we are where we were. The
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
War goes on, nothing is abated of the Vi∣gour
of our Armies, or of the needful Pre∣parations;
the War indeed may influence
the Treaty: Thus it was at the Treaty of
<HI>Westphalia,</HI> which held at least Eight Years;
thus it was at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
which lasted Two Campaigns, yet both at
last came to a Conclusion, and so may this
perhaps; if it does not, we are never the
farther off of Victory, nor the Enemy ever
the nearer the End they aim at.</P>
<P>It seems therefore something wonder∣ful
to me, that People should be allarm'd at
a Proposal to treat; we may treat without
a Peace, but we can never have a Peace
without treating. All that we are allarm'd
at hitherto, is the Suggestion or Suspicion
of a private Treaty; to bring it then to an
open fair <HI>Publick Treaty,</HI> is the most effe∣ctually
way both to remove the Suspitions
of such a Treaty on one Hand, and to take
away the Pretensions for it on the other.</P>
<P>Some alledge a Party among us are a∣gainst
Peace, are for perpetuating the War,
and have their private Ends in view, to be
pursued at the Publick Expence. I am in
hopes there are no such People among us;
however, those People opposing a Treaty,
give the best Argument that those that
think so can wish for, to support that Al∣legation;
it is alledged on the other Hand,
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
That <HI>Clandestine Negotiations</HI> are on Foot,
and those that say so, fill the People with
Suspicions, and Apprehensions of such Things
as I hope are not in any One's Head to at∣tempt.
<HI>A Treaty</HI> would effectually remove
all those Jealousies, and clear up the Repu∣tation
of both Parties.</P>
<P>At a Treaty, all the Allies will be pre∣sent
by their Plenipotentiaries, every Thing
will be fully, fairly and openly discuss'd; if
any Member of the Confederates are easier,
and willinger to be imposed upon than they
ought to be, they will be set to Rights in
Judgment, or over-rul'd in Vote by the o∣ther;
if any Member of the Confederacy is
more rigid, or more backward, harder to
be satisfied with Reason, or forwarder to
continue the War than consists with the
General Interest, he will be reduced to
Reason by the Perswasions, or over-rul'd
by the Voices of the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are not so considerable an E∣nemy,
that we should be afraid to Engage
with them any farther in the War; or so in∣considerable,
that we should think it below
us <HI>to Treat;</HI> a Treaty takes off all Objecti∣ons,
tho' they do not propose enough to
form <HI>a Good Peace,</HI> yet in a Treaty we may
bring them to it. I can see many Objecti∣ons
against their Proposals indeed, but I can∣not
see one against a Treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
In a Treaty a Thousand Things may
occur, and be said, that may in the End
happily Issue this Great Affair in A GOOD
PEACE; as I said in the beginning, I find
every one joining in their desire to have <HI>a
good Peace,</HI> but how shall they obtain it
without a Treaty? A Treaty takes it out
of the Hands of those you may suspect, and
puts it into the Hands of the Confederates in
General; if any Concessions are made to
<HI>France,</HI> which you are afraid of, there they
will be discussed, there they will be examin∣ed;
the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies on eve∣ry
Side will be watchful, that the Distributi∣on
of the Dominions be not partial and une∣qual
to one or to another; that every one
has Justice, and that no Advantage be gi∣ven
more on one hand than another. The
Plenipotentiaries of all the Parties are Arbi∣trators
of every particular Interest respe∣ctively.</P>
<P>Certainly
a Treaty would end all this
Strife; if the <HI>French</HI> are Sincere in their Of∣fers,
and in their Proposals for a General
Peace, it will appear; if they are not,
they will be detected: The Securities they
will offer, will be here disputed, the Vali∣dity
of them determined; if they are re∣jected,
the Reasons for rejecting them will
appear; and if we must carry on the War
again, the Necessity will appear; so that
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
People will be satisfied with it, and the
more Chearfully bear the Expence. More∣over,
the Scandal of designing to perpetuate
the War will be removed, and every one
will see for themselves, why the Treaty
broke off, and why the War is carryed on:
If a Peace ensues, it is not the less likely to
be A GOOD PEACE, for having the
whole Body of the Confederate Ministers
consenting to it, and coming into it.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine upon what Foot any
one can pretend to be backward to a Treaty,
and I am the freer to put this Notion of
mine in here at this length, because I
think it is the only Method to bring the
variety of Opinions now among us, to a
Point; to reconcile us to one another a lit∣tle,
and to establish our private Peace, by
putting an end to the present Disputes a∣mong
us; a Thing every good man wishes
for, and a Thing none can deny we ex∣treamly
want.</P>
<P>I cannot but think those People very
much mistaken, both on one Side or other,
who oppose a Treaty; <HI>some say</HI> a Treaty
will be to no Purpose, and will but amuse
us, and all <HI>Europe;</HI> that it is plain, the Con∣federates
will insist on the Surrendring all
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to the House of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI>
and that the <HI>French</HI> will not part with
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
it, and therefore the War must go on, till
the <HI>French</HI> find themselves in such Circum∣stances
as to be obliged to quit that sweet
Morsel to save the rest: That a Treaty
in the mean time is but amusing us, and is
a particular Service to the King of <HI>France,</HI>
as it buoys up his People in hopes of a Peace,
and urges them to exert their utmost for a∣while
longer, upon a prospect of a speedy
Issue of all their Troubles. On the other
Hand, some say a Treaty is design'd only
to bring the Confederates into some Confu∣sion
about the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; and that
some appearing less tenacious on that Head
than others, will make them Jealous of one
another, divide them in Opinion; and
that the <HI>French</HI> have more Room in a Trea∣ty
to lay hold of, and make Advantages
from those Differences; and so a Treaty
may be a Means to destroy the good Har∣mony
of the Confederates, rather than to
issue in <HI>a good Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the First,</HI> It seems to have no strength
of Reasoning at all in it; 'tis begging the Que∣stion,
to say the Confederates will insist upon
the evacuating the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Domi∣nions
to the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> it is evident,
as before the Confederates did appear en∣clin'd
at the last Treaty, to yield some
Point to <HI>France,</HI> and to allow King <HI>Philip</HI> to
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
keep Possession of some part of that Monar∣chy,
rather than continue the Desolations
of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this, when there was a
distinct Branch of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> to
possess the rest; it seems probable they may
be enclin'd to make larger Concessions
now. The Consideration of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Desola∣tions
being as strong as before, and the
House of <HI>Austria</HI> having now but one
Head to receive the rest; to which Head
there cannot be equal Reason for giving
the rest, to what there was before; and
of which Head there may be so many just
Fears of the Danger of his possessing it—∣The
Notion then of the Confederates be∣ing
resolved to insist positively upon the
Evacuation of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy with∣out
any Reserve, is not well grounded,
and therefore not a just way of Argu∣ing.</P>
<P>As
to a Treaty being a Help to <HI>France,</HI> as
it buoys up the Spirits of his People; by so
much as he reaps an Advantage by that Mo∣mentary,
Imaginary Aid—by so much, if it
fails, will he suffer then in the Despair he will
find his People reduc'd to, when they shall
see those Hopes vanish, and that their
Miseries are like still to be continued by
the Obstinacy of their King, in hazarding
their Ruine, to preserve not themselves
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
as <HI>France,</HI> but the Possession of the whole
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, by which they can pro∣pose
to receive little or no Benefit when it
is obtain'd, and will be expos'd to the ut∣most
Desolation in the Disappointment.</P>
<P>This Digression brings me back to the
Notion of the Confederates upon such a
Treaty, making Concessions to <HI>France</HI> of
some Part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy—And
this the People who object, say, cannot
consist with A GOOD PEACE.</P>
<P>This Point must be clear'd up as we go,
and therefore I resume it now; it is appa∣rent,
that as before, two Accidents make
the Circumstances differ.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there was even at the last Treaty,
an apparent Willingness in the Confe∣derates,
to have made some Conces∣sions
to King <HI>Philip,</HI> which neverthe∣less
were thought to be consistent with
A GOOD PEACE.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there is not now, as there then
was, a Branch of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI>
whom there was no Danger to <HI>Europe</HI>
in Establishing on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne,
and that therefore farther Concessions
perhaps may not only be found con∣sistent
with, but may be essential to
A GOOD PEACE.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
<P>It needs not that I should embarrass my
self here with that ensnaring Party ma∣king
Question, What, and how much of
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy may, and should,
upon a Treaty, be given to the present Pos∣sessor.
But to keep to the Text, <HI>viz,</HI> The
Explanation of the General Term, <HI>A Good
Peace,</HI> I shall lay down some Heads, which
without Partiality or Respect to Parties in
the least, but speaking really, and <HI>bona fide,</HI>
with all possible Indifference, seem to me
to be natural Deductions from the present
State of Affairs in <HI>Europe;</HI> and by which, if
cooly consider'd, we may come to understand
what is the true and genuine Meaning of
the thing we are upon, (<HI>viz.</HI>) what we
may call A GOOD PEACE.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That if on a Treaty, <HI>France</HI> should con∣sent
entirely to evacuate the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy, and the Confederates
should give up that Monarchy to the
Emperor, the Ballance of Power in
<HI>Europe</HI> would be entirely destroy'd,
and therefore such a Conclusion could
not be allow'd to be A GOOD PEACE.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That altho' some Part (<HI>God forbid I should
say what part, I have nothing to do with
that</HI>) of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy should
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
be conceded to King <HI>Philip</HI> upon a
Treaty, yet such Parts of it might be
also given to the Emperor, as might
be <HI>an equitable and reasonable Satisfaction
to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretensi∣ons
to the</HI> Spanish <HI>Succession,</HI> accord∣ing
to the very Words of the Treaty
of the Grand Alliance quoted before.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That although some part of the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Succession should by a Treaty re∣main
to King <HI>Philip</HI> V. yet such fit∣ting
Security MAY be given by the
King of <HI>France,</HI> and by King <HI>Philip</HI>
respectively, as may be sufficient and
Satisfactory to the Queen of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> and the States General, and
their Allies, for their Kingdoms and
Provinces, and for the Navigation and
Commerce of their Subjects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That such Treaty as shall end in ob∣taining
such equitable and reasonable
Satisfaction to the Empreror, and such
Security to the rest of the Allies,
may issue in a Firm, Lasting, Safe, Ho∣nourable
and GOOD PEACE, al∣though
some Part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy
should remain to the present
King <HI>Philip</HI> V.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
<P>This, I think, may be allow'd, accor∣ding
to my Title, to be a full and plain
Exposition of the Word A GOOD PEACE;
and may tell us all, what we are to under∣stand
by it. Nor may it be altogether
useless to us, in helping us to judge calmly
and coolly of the Steps that are, or shall be
taken towards it, either by Us, or by Our
Allies.</P>
<P>By this we may determine, when these
are too forward, and yield too much to
<HI>France;</HI> or those too backward or refracto∣ry,
as not to see when good Terms may
be obtain'd; both which will prevent the
mutual Reproaches which pass now on
either Side, with so much ill Nature.</P>
<P>I know we have some, who fill our Ears
with Clamours against our Enemies; and
answer all Arguments, with telling us,
that the King of <HI>France</HI> is sincere in no∣thing;
that he designs to keep no Treaty
any farther, or longer, than till he is in a
Condition to break it.—That he vi∣sibly
design'd, from the beginning, to an∣nex
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to the Kingdom
of <HI>France,</HI> and does so still; and the Con∣sequence
of this, is, by their own Confes∣sion,
That we should neither treat of Se∣curity,
or Evacuation, or any Thing
else; but that our only Safety consists in re∣ducing
the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
To what we must reduce him, how,
and when it shall be done, and when we
shall be allow'd to have reduc'd him e∣nough,
they do not undertake to deter∣mine.
Indeed, these are Gentlemen I can∣not
join with; and I doubt, it is such as
these that give some People so much Ground
to say, That there are a Party; who are
for perpetuating the War.—I am as
willing to be Sanguine upon the War as
any Body; and if it were continued,
should be as willing to be hopeful of Suc∣cess.—But
to say, that the King of
<HI>France</HI> cannot put us into such a Case by
a Peace, as MAY effectually prevent him
ever annexing <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and that
this is his avow'd Design in this, and in
all Treaties, is such a Confirmation of
what has been all along offer'd by others, <HI>viz.</HI>
that a few Years would make King <HI>Philip</HI>
as much a <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>as much</HI> an Enemy to
<HI>France</HI> as any King of <HI>Spain</HI> before him, that
I wonder to hear Men of Sense bring it for
an Argument; and a Man can hardly re∣frain
telling such Men, that they are ar∣guing
for our giving up <HI>Spain</HI> to King
<HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has set up <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>An∣jou,</HI>
upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne, and has fought
hard to keep him in Possession; in Gratitude
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
and Duty to his Grand-father, I doubt not but
<HI>Philip</HI> V. would on all Occasions do any thing
for his Grand-father that lay in his Power;
but if now after a Peace should be made (sup∣posing,
for Argument sake, that Peace were to
give <HI>Spain</HI> to King <HI>Philip;</HI>) let us bring in the
King of <HI>France</HI> writing such a Letter as this to
his Grandson.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mons. My Grandson,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have set you up upon the <HI>Spanish Throne,</HI>
and caused you to be Establish'd in that Kingdoms
by all the Confederates in a General Treaty of Peace. But,
as my Design in setting you up, was only to
annex the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to my Kingdom of
<HI>France;</HI> so I expect that now you will resign all
those Dominions to Me, and come hither to <HI>Versailles,</HI>
where you shall be receiv'd with all Paternal Care
and Affection.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>LOUIS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Will any Man say that <HI>Philip</HI> will immedi∣ately
Obey, resign his Crown and Kingdom,
to the King of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he is his Grand-father,
or had been his immediate Father, or
were a thousand times nearer, if that could
be?</P>
<P>Would not King <HI>Philip</HI> rather write a sub∣missive
Letter to him, acknowledging his Fa∣vour
in preferring him to so great a Dignity,
and his Kindness in maintaining him therein
unto a General Peace; professing his Zeal
for his Majesty's Interest, and his Readiness
to hazard himself, and all his Kingdoms in his
Majesties Service; But that he is now so en∣dear'd
to his Subjects, whose Fidelity has
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
been so manifest, and they are so endear'd to
him that he is become the Father of his Peo∣ple▪
and that he hopes his Grand-father will
not put him to such an Extremity to quit
those Kingdoms, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, who
have spent so much Blood to keep him in Pos∣session,
and so in short Excuse himself, <HI>that is,</HI>
make a Decent Refusal.</P>
<P>If upon this, the King of <HI>France,</HI> went about
to Invade him, Would he not say to him, that
his <HI>Spanish</HI> Subjects would by no means consent
to his Abandoning them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they
are resoly'd to defend themselves; and would
he not rather fight his Grand-father, after all
he has done for him, than quit his Possession?
And I am sure you will all say, he would be
in the right to do so—And what would be
the Consequence of such Fighting? but that
very King <HI>Philip</HI> joining with the Allies, and
seeking to them for help against <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And if this would be so under his Grand-father,
let any Man tell us what it would pro∣bably
be in half an Age after to his Elder
Brother, if he <HI>being King of France,</HI> should
make such a Demand? Would not he, <HI>Philip,</HI>
Laugh at him, and bid him do his worst; and
in both Cases, fly to the Confederates, <HI>viz.</HI>
to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and to the <HI>Empire</HI> for help?</P>
<P>This is so Natural and so unanswerably Just
to suppose—That let these People but make
it out, that this is the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Design,
and that he is only making a Shew of King
<HI>Philip,</HI> but really resolves to annex <HI>Spain</HI> to the
Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> I say, let them but make
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
this good; and they have brought on the
Stage the strongest Reason that ever was yet
given, or ever will be, why all the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy should be given to King <HI>Philip,</HI>
and I Challenge them to Answer it if they
can.</P>
<P>Let any one but ensure the Confederates,
that the King of <HI>France</HI> will endeavour to
annex <HI>Spain</HI> to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> after a
Peace; I dare say, none of the Confederates
would scruple leaving King <HI>Philip</HI> upon that
Throne—But this is so wild a Notion, that
I think it Merits to have no more Notice
taken of it.</P>
<P>Two things this Discourse tends to: 1. To
remove that Notion, gotten among us, that
all is Lost and Given up, if King <HI>Philip</HI>
is not entirely Depos'd and Un-king'd, and
the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy taken out of his
Hands by the Confederates; a thing, I must
confess, however I acquiesce in the Opinion of
our Superiors, I never saw either Rational
to be so strictly limited, or possible to be
brought to Practise; and a thing which those
who adher'd to, yet tacitly own'd themselves
wrong in, by keeping the Houses, by short
Adjournments, just at Hand, to alter as they saw
Occasion. 2. To Allarm us, and that with great,
Reason too, to Consider, Suppose we could take
it from King <HI>Philip;</HI> What the Danger of
giving it now to the same Person to whom
we would have given it before, will be; and
Lastly, To Convince us all, how reasonable
it is that the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> should in ge∣neral
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
Congress, Meet, Treat and Debate, of
these great Affairs, that if possible, out of all
those Interfering Interests, some Happy Me∣dium
may be found to Re-establish the Tran∣quility
of <HI>Europe</HI> in a GOOD PEACE.</P>
