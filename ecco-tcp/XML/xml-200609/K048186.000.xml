<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND D<SUP>R</SUP> YOUNG, RECTOR of WELWYN In HERTFORDSHIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to break into your retirement, the residence of virtue and literature, and to trouble you with a few reflections on the merits and real character of an admired author, and on other collateral subjects, that will naturally arise. No love of singularity, no affectation of paradoxical opinions, gave rise to the following work. I re∣vere the memory of POPE, I respect and honour his abilities; but I do not think him at the head of his profession. In other words, in that species of poetry wherein POPE excelled, he is superior
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to all mankind: and I only say, that this species of poetry is not the most excel∣lent one of the art. We do not, it should seem, sufficiently attend to the difference there is, betwixt a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF SENSE, and a TRUE POET. Donne and Swift, were un∣doubtedly men of wit, and men of sense: but what traces have they left of PURE POETRY? Fontenelle and La Motte are entitled to the former character; but what can they urge to gain the latter? Which of these characters is the most valuable and useful, is entirely out of the question: all I plead for, is, to have their several provinces kept distinct from each other; and to impress on the rea∣der, that a clear head, and acute under∣standing are not sufficient, alone, to
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
make a POET; that the most solid obser∣vations on human life, expressed with the utmost elegance and brevity, are MORALITY, and not POETRY; that the EPISTLES of Boileau in RHYME, are no more poetical, than the CHARACTERS of Bruyere in PROSE; and that it is a creative and glowing IMAGINATION, <Q REND="inline">"acer spiritus ac vis,"</Q> and that alone, that can stamp a writer with this exalted and very uncommon character, which so few possess, and of which so few can pro∣perly judge.</P>
<P>FOR one person, who can adequately relish, and enjoy, a work of imagination, twenty are to be found who can taste and judge of, observations on familiar life, and the manners of the age. The
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
satires of Ariosto, are more read than the Orlando Furioso, or even Dante. Are there so many cordial admirers of Spenser and Milton, as of Hudibras?—If we strike out of the number of these sup∣posed admirers, those who appear such out of fashion, and not of feeling. Swift's rhapsody on poetry is far more popular, than Akenside's noble ode to Lord Huntingdon. The EPISTLES on the Cha∣racters of men and women, and your sprightly satires, my good friend, are more frequently perused, and quoted, than L'Allegro and Il Penseroso of Milton. Had you written only these satires, you would indeed have gained the title of a man of wit, and a man of sense; but, I am confident, would not insist on being denominated a POET, MERELY on their account.<Q><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
<L>NON SATIS EST PURIS VERSUM PERSCRIBERE VERBIS.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is amazing this matter should ever have been mistaken, when Horace has taken particular and repeated pains, to settle and adjust the opinion in question. He has more than once disclaimed all right and title to the name of POET, on the score of his ethic and satiric pieces.
<Q><L>—NEQUE ENIM CONCLUDERE VERSUM</L>
<L>DIXERIS ESSE SATIS—</L></Q>
are lines, often repeated, but whose mean∣ing is not extended and weighed as it ought to be. Nothing can be more judicious than the method he prescribes, of trying whether any composition be essentially poetical or not; which is, to drop entirely the measures and numbers, and transpose and invert the order of the
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
words: and in this unadorned manner to peruse the passage. If there be really in it a true poetical spirit, all your inver∣sions and transpositions will not disguise and extinguish it; but it will retain its lustre, like a diamond, unset, and thrown back into the rubbish of the mine. Let us make a little experiment on the fol∣lowing well-known lines; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Yes, you despise the man that is confined to books, who rails at human kind from his study; tho' what he learns, he speaks; and may perhaps advance some general maxims, or may be right by chance. The coxcomb bird, so grave and so talk∣ative, that cries whore, knave, and cuckold, from his cage, tho' he rightly call many a passenger, you hold him no philosopher. And yet, such is the fate</HI>
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
<HI>of all extremes, men may be read too much, as well as books. We grow more partial, for the sake of the observer, to observations which we ourselves make; less, so, to written wisdom, because another's. Maxims are drawn from no∣tions, and those from guess.</HI>"</Q> What shall we say of this passage?—Why, that it is most excellent sense, but just as poetical as the <Q REND="inline">"Qui fit Maecenas"</Q> of the author who recom∣mends this method of trial. Take any ten lines of the Iliad, Paradise Lost, or even of the Georgics of Virgil, and see whe∣ther by any process of critical chymistry, you can lower and reduce them to the tameness of prose. You will find that they will appear like Ulysses in his dis∣guise
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
of rags, still a hero, tho' lodged in the cottage of the herdsman Eumaeus.</P>
<P>THE Sublime and the Pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine poesy. What is there very sublime or very Pathetic in POPE? In his works there is indeed, <Q REND="inline">"nihil inane, nihil arcessitum;—puro tamen fonti quam magno flumini propior;"</Q> as the excellent Quintilian remarks of Lysias. And because I am perhaps ashamed or afraid to speak out in plain English, I will adopt the follow∣ing passage of Voltaire, which, in my opinion, as exactly characterizes POPE, as it does his model Boileau, for whom it was originally designed. <Q REND="inline">"INCAPABLE PEUTETRE DU SUBLIME QUI ELEVE L'AME, ET DU SENTIMENT QUI L'ATTENDRIT, MAIS FAIT POUR ECLAIRER CEUX A QUI LA NATURE ACCORDA L'UN
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
ET L'AUTRE, LABORIEUX, SEVERE, PRECIS, PUR, HARMONIEUX, IL DEVINT, ENFIN, LE POETE DE LA RAISON."</Q></P>
<P>OUR English poets may, I think, be be disposed in four different classes and degrees. In the first class, I would place, first, our only three sublime and pathetic poets; SPENSER, SHAKESPEARE, MILTON; and then, at proper intervals, OTWAY and LEE. In the second class should be placed, such as possessed the true poetical genius, in a more moderate de∣gree, but had noble talents for moral and ethical poesy. At the head of these are DRYDEN, DONNE, DENHAM, COWLEY, CONGREVE. In the third class may be placed, men of wit, of elegant taste, and some fancy in describing familiar life. Here may be numbered, PRIOR,
<PB N="xii" REF="11" MS="y"/>
WALLER, PARNELL, SWIFT, FENTON. In the fourth class, the mere versifiers, however smooth and mellifluous some of them may be thought, should be ranked. Such as PITT, SANDYS, FAIR∣FAX, BROOME, BUCKINGHAM, LANS∣DOWN. In which of these classes POPE deserves to be placed, the following work is intended to determine.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the PASTORALS, and the MESSIAH an Eclogue.</HEAD>
<P>PRINCES and Authors are seldom spoken of, during their lives, with jus∣tice and impartiality. Admiration and envy, their constant attendants, like two unskilful artists, are apt to overcharge their pieces with too great a quantity of light or of shade; and are disqualified happily to hit upon that middle colour, that mixture of
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
error and excellence, which alone renders every representation of man just and natural. This perhaps may be one reason, among o∣thers, why we have never yet seen a fair and candid criticism on the character and merits of our last great poet, Mr. POPE. I have therefore thought, that it would be no unpleasing amusement, or uninstructive employment to examine at large, without blind panegyric, or petulant invective, the writings of this English Classic, in the order in which they are arranged in the elegant edition of Mr. Warburton. As I shall nei∣ther censure nor commend, without alleging the reason on which my opinion is founded, I shall be entirely unmoved at the impu∣tation of malignity, or the clamours of po∣pular prejudice.</P>
<P>IT is something strange, that in the pas∣torals of a young poet there should not be found a single rural image that is new: but this I am afraid is the case in the PASTORALS before us. The ideas of Theocritus, Vir∣gil,
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
and Spenser, are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure; but the descriptions and sentiments are trite and common. That the design of pastoral poesy is, to represent the undisturbed felicity of the golden age, is an empty notion, which, though supported by a Rapin and a Fonte∣nelle, I think, all rational critics have agreed to exstirpate and explode. But I do not re∣member, that even these last-mentioned cri∣tics have remarked the circumstance that gave origin to the opinion that any golden age was intended. Theocritus, the father and the model of this enchanting species of composition, lived and wrote in Sicily. The climate of Sicily was delicious, and the face of the country various, and beautiful: it's vallies and it's precipices, it's grot∣tos and cascades were SWEETLY INTER∣CHANGED, and it's fruits and flowers were lavish and luscious. The poet described what he saw and felt: and had no need to have recourse to those artificial assemblages of pleasing objects, which are not to be found
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
in nature. The figs and the honey which he assigns as a reward to a victorious shep∣herd were in themselves exquisite, and are therefore assigned with great propriety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idyll. i. ver. 146.</NOTE>: and the beauties of that luxurious land∣schape so richly and circumstantially deline∣ated in the close of the seventh idyllium, where all things smelt of summer and smelt of autumn,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 133.</NOTE></L></Q>
were present and real. Succeeding writers supposing these beauties too great and a∣bundant to be real, referred them to the fictitious and imaginary scenes of a golden age.</P>
<P>A MIXTURE of British and Grecian ideas may justly be deemed a blemish in the PAS∣TORALS of POPE: and propriety is certainly violated, when he couples Pactolus with Thames, and Windsor with Hybla. Com∣plaints of IMMODERATE heat, and wishes to be conveyed to cooling caverns, when uttered
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
by the inhabitants of Greece, have a deco∣rum and consistency, which they totally lose in the character of a British shepherd: and Theocritus, during the ardors of Sirius, must have heard the murmurings of a brook, and the whispers of a pine, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idyll. i. ver. 1.</NOTE> with more home∣felt pleasure, than Pope <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Past. iv. ver. 1.</NOTE> could possibly ex∣perience upon the same occasion. We can never completely relish, or adequately under∣stand any author, especially any Ancient, ex∣cept we constantly keep in our eye his cli∣mate, his country, and his age. POPE him∣self informs us, in a note, that he judiciously omitted the following verse,
<Q><L>And list'ning wolves grow milder as they hear <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Past. ii.</NOTE></L></Q>
on account of the absurdity, which Spenser overlooked, of introducing wolves into Eng∣land. But on this principle, which is cer∣tainly a just one, may it not be asked, why he should speak, the scene lying in Windsor-
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>

That POPE however was sensible of the importance of adapting images to the scene of action, is obvious from the following example of his judgment; for in translating,
<Q><L>Audiit EUROTAS, jussitque ediscere LAUROS</L></Q>
he has dextrously dropt the <HI>laurels</HI> appropri∣ated to Eurotas, as he is speaking of the river Thames, and has rendered it,
<Q><L>THAMES heard the numbers, as he flow'd along,</L>
<L>And bade his <HI>willows</HI> learn the moving song. <NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ver. 14.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>IN the passages which POPE has imitated from Theocritus, and from his Latin tran∣slator Virgil, he has merited but little ap∣plause. It may not be unentertaining to see
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
how coldly and unpoetically POPE has copied the subsequent appeal to the nymphs on the death of Daphnis, in comparison of Milton on LYCIDAS, one of his juvenile pieces.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

<P>POPE has thus altered this image,<Q><L>Oh! were I made by some transforming pow'r,</L>
<L>The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r!</L>
<L>Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ;</L>
<L>And I, those kisses he receives, enjoy.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Past. ii. 45.</NOTE></L></Q> On three accounts the former image is pre∣ferable to the latter: for the pastoral wild∣ness, the delicacy, and the uncommonness of the thought. I cannot forbear adding, that the riddle of the <HI>Royal Oak,</HI> in the first Pas∣toral, invented in imitation of the Virgilian aenigmas in the third eclogue, savours of pun, and puerile conceit.<Q><PB N="9" REF="20"/>
<L>Say, Daphnis, say in what glad soil appears</L>
<L>A wondrous tree, that sacred monarchs bears?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 85.</NOTE></L></Q> With what propriety could the tree, whose shade protected the king, be said to be pro∣lific of princes?</P>
<P>THAT POPE has not equalled Theocritus, will indeed appear less surprising, if we re∣flect, that no original writer ever remained so unrivalled by succeeding copyists, as this Sici∣lian master.</P>
<P>IF it should be objected, that the barren∣ness of invention imputed to POPE from a view of his PASTORALS, is equally imputable to the Bucolics of Virgil, it may be answered, that whatever may be determined of the rest, yet the first and last Eclogues of Virgil are indisputable proofs of true genius, and power of fancy. The influence of war on the tran∣quillity of rural life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> I have been lately highly entertained with the accidental perusal of FIVE PASTORALS, written on this plan, descriptive of the calamities supposed to have been felt by the shepherds of Germany during the last war: They abound in many new circumstances of pastoral distress, and many tender images. I cannot learn the name of the author.</NOTE>, rendered the subject
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
of the first new, and interesting: its compo∣sition is truly dramatic; and the characters of it's two shepherds are well supported, and happily contrasted: and the last has expres∣sively painted the changeful resolutions, the wild wishes, the passionate and abrupt ex∣clamations, of a disappointed and despairing lover.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the principal merit of the PASTORALS of POPE consists, in their cor∣rect and musical versification; musical, to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable: and in giving the first spe∣cimen of that harmony in English verse, which is now become indispensably necessary; and which has so forcibly and universally in∣fluenced the publick ear, as to have rendered every moderate rhymer melodious. POPE lengthened the abruptness of Waller, and at the same time contracted the exuberance of Dryden.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22"/>
I REMEMBER to have been informed, by an intimate friend of POPE, that he had once laid a design of writing AMERICAN ECLOGUES: The subject would have been fruitful of the most poetical imagery; and, if properly executed, would have rescued the author from the accusation here urged, of having written Eclogues without invention.</P>
<P>OUR author, who had received an early tincture of religion, a reverence for which he preserved to the last, was with justice con∣vinced, that the scriptures of God contained not only the purest precepts of morality, but the most elevated and sublime strokes of ge∣nuine poesy; strokes as much superior to any thing Heathenism can produce, as is Jehovah to Jupiter. This is the case more particularly in the exalted prophesy of Isaiah, which POPE has so successfully versified in an Ec∣logue, that incontestably surpasses the Pollio of Virgil: although perhaps the dignity, the energy, and the simplicity of the original are
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
in a few passages weakened and diminished by florid epithets, and useless circumlocutions.
<Q><L>See nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring,</L>
<L>With all the incense of the breathing spring. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MESS. v. 23.</NOTE></L></Q>
are lines which have too much prettiness, and too modern an air. The judicious addi∣tion of circumstances and adjuncts is what renders poesy a more lively imitation of nature than prose. POPE has been happy in introducing the following circumstance: the prophet says, <Q REND="inline">"The parched ground shall become a pool;"</Q> Our author ex∣presses this idea by saying, that the shepherd,
<Q><L>—<HI>shall</HI> START amid the thirsty wild to hear</L>
<L>New falls of water murmuring in his ear. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">v. 70.</NOTE></L></Q>
A striking example of a similar beauty may be added from Thompson. Melisander, in the Tragedy of AGAMEMNON, after telling us he was conveyed in a vessel, at mid-night, to the wildest of the Cyclades, adds, when the pitiless mariners had left him in that dread∣ful solitude,
<Q><PB N="13" REF="24"/>
<L>—I never heard</L>
<L>A sound so dismal as their parting oars.</L></Q></P>
<P>ON the other hand, the prophet has been sometimes particular, when POPE has been only general. <Q REND="inline">"Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves together, they come to thee:—The multitude of CAMELS shall cover thee: the DROMEDARIES of Median and Ephah: all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord. All the FLOCKS of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee; the RAMS of Ne∣baioth shall minister unto thee."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, c. lx. v. 4, 6, 7.</NOTE></Q> In imitating this passage, POPE has omitted the different beasts that in so picturesque a man∣ner characterize the different countries which were to be gathered together on this impor∣tant event, and says only in undistinguishing terms,<Q><PB N="14" REF="25"/>
<L>See, barbarous nations at thy gates attend,</L>
<L>Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend;</L>
<L>See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings,</L>
<L>And heap'd with products of Sabaean springs.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 91.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>AS prosperity and happiness are described in this Eclogue by a combination of the most pleasing and agreeable objects, so misery and destruction are as forcibly delineated in the same Isaiah, by the circumstances of distress and desolation, that were to attend the fall of that magnificent city, Babylon: and the latter is perhaps a more proper and interesting subject for poetry than the former; as such kinds of objects make the deepest impression on the mind: pity being a stronger sensation than complacency. Accordingly a noble ode on the destruction of Babylon, taken from the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, has been written by Mr. Lowth, whose latin prelec∣tions on the inimitable poesy of the Hebrews, abounding in remarks entirely new, deli∣vered in the purest and most expressive lan∣guage, are the richest augmentation literature
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
has lately received; and from which the fol∣lowing passage gradually unfolding the singu∣lar beauties of this prophecy, is here closely, though faintly, translated, and inserted as a pattern of just criticism.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"THE prophet having predicted the deli∣verance of the Jews, and their return into their own country from their rigorous Baby∣lonish captivity, instantly introduces them singing a certain triumphal song on the fall of the king of Babylon; a song abounding in the most splendid images, and carried on by perpetual, and those very beautiful, per∣sonifications. The song begins with a sudden exclamation of the Jews, expressing their joy and wonder at the unexpected change of their condition, and death of the tyrant. Earth with her inhabitants triumphs; the firs and cedars of Libanus, under which images the allegoric style frequently shadows the kings and princes of the Gentiles, rejoice, and in∣sult with reproaches the broken power of their most implacable foe.<Q><PB N="16" REF="27"/>
<L>She is at rest, the whole earth is quiet: they break forth into
singing.</L>
<L>Even the firs rejoice at thee, the cedars of Libanus:</L>
<L>Since thou art laid low, no feller is come up against us.</L></Q> There follows a most daring prosopopeia of ORCUS, or the infernal regions: he rouzes his inhabitants, the manes of princes, and the shades of departed kings: immediately all of them arise from their thrones, and walk forward to meet the king of Babylon; they insult and deride him, and gather con∣solation from his calamity.<Q><L>Art thou also made weak as we? art thou made like unto us?</L>
<L>Is thy pride dashed down to Orcus, the noise of thy harps?</L>
<L>The worm is strewn under thee, the earth-worm is thy covering!</L></Q> The Jews are again represented speaking: they most strongly exaggerate his remarkable fall, by an exclamation formed in the manner of funeral lamentations:<Q><L>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="28"/> Thou art dashed down to the earth, thou that didst
crush the nations!</L></Q> They next represent the king himself speaking, and madly boasting of his unbounded power, whence the prodigiousness of his ruin is won∣derfully aggravated. Nor is this enough; a new personage is immediately formed: Those are introduced who found the body of the king of Babylon cast out: they survey it it closely and attentively, and at last hardly know it.
<Q><L>Is this the man who made earth tremble, who shook the kingdoms?</L>
<L>Who made the world a solitude, and destroyed it's cities?</L></Q>
They reproach him with the loss of the com∣mon rite of sepulture, which was deservedly denied to him for his cruelty and oppression, and curse his name, his race, and posterity. The scene is closed by a most awful speech of God himself, menacing a perpetual extir∣pation to the king of Babylon, to his de∣scendants, and to his city; and confirm∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
the immutability of his councils by the ratification of a solemn oath.</P> 
<P>WHAT images, how various, how thick∣sown, how sublime, exalted with what ener∣gy, what expressions, figures, and sentiments, are here accumulated together! we hear the Jews, the cedars of Libanus, the shades of the departed kings, the king of Babylon, those who find his body, and lastly Jehovah himself, all speaking in order; and behold them acting their several parts, as it were in a drama. One continued action is carried on; or rather a various and manifold series of dif∣ferent actions is connected. Every excellence, more peculiarly appropriated to the sublimer ode, is consummatley displayed in this poem of Isaiah, which is the most perfect and unex∣ampled model, among all the monuments of antiquity. The personages are frequent, but not confused; are bold but not affected; a free, lofty, and truly divine spirit predomi∣nates through the whole. Nor is any thing wanting to crown and complete the sublimity
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
of this ode with absolute beauty; nor can the Greek or Roman poesy produce any thing that is similar, or second, to this ode.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praelect. 13. ad calc.</NOTE>"</P></Q></P>
<P>IT cannot be thought strange, that he who could so judiciously explain, could as poetically express, the ideas of Isaiah: the latter he has performed in many instances; but in none more strikingly than in the fol∣lowing, which magnificently represents the Messiah treading the wine-press in his anger, and which and impartial judge, not blinded by the charms of antiquity, will think equal to any description in Virgil, in point of ele∣gance and energy:<Q><L>—Ille patris vires indutus et iram</L>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of WINDSOR-FOREST, and LYRIC Pieces.</HEAD>
<P>DESCRIPTIVE Poetry was by no means the shining talent of POPE. This as∣sertion may be manifested by the few images introduced in the poem before us, which are not equally applicable to any place whatso∣ever.

THE poets, both ancient and modern, are obliged to the rivers for some of their most most striking descriptions. The Tiber, and the Nile of Virgil, the Aufidus of Horace, the Sabrina of Milton, and the Scamander of Homer, are among their capital figures.</P>
<P>THE influences and effects of peace, and its consequence, a diffusive commerce, are expres∣sed by selecting such circumstances, as are best adapted to strike the imagination by lively pictures; the selection of which chiefly con∣stitutes true poetry. An historian or prose∣writer might say, <Q REND="inline">"Then shall the most distant nations crowd into my port:"</Q> a poet sets before your eyes <Q REND="inline">"the ships of uncouth form,"</Q> that shall arrive in the Thames; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 400. et seq.</NOTE><Q><L>And feather'd people croud my wealthy side;</L>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 407.</NOTE></L></Q> The two epithets <HI>native</HI> and <HI>sable</HI> have pecu∣liar elegance and force; and as Peru was particularly famous for its long succession of Incas, and Mexico for many magnificent works of massy gold, there is great propriety in fixing the restoration of the grandeur of each to that object, for which each was once so remarkable.</P>
<P>THE groupe of allegorical personages that succeeds the last mentioned lines, are worthy the pencil of Rubens or Julio Romano: it may, perhaps, however be wished that the epithets <HI>barbarous</HI> (discord), <HI>mad</HI> (ambition), <HI>hateful</HI> (envy), <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 411. et seq.</NOTE> had been particular and pic∣turesque, instead of general and indiscrimi∣nating; though it may possibly be urged, that in describing the dreadful inhabitants of the portal of hell, Virgil has not always used
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
such adjuncts and epithets as a painter or sta∣tuary might work after; he says only <HI>ultrices</HI> CURAE, <HI>mortiferum</HI> BELLUM, <HI>mala</HI> MENTIS GAUDIA; particularly, <HI>malesuada</HI> is only ap∣plied to FAMES, instead of a word that might represent the meagre and ghastly figure in∣tended. I make no scruple of adding, that in this famous passage, Virgil has exhibited no images so lively and distinct, as these living figures painted by POPE, each of them with their proper insignia and attributes.<Q><L>—ENVY her own snakes shall feel,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 417. et seq.</NOTE></L>

<P>A PERSON of no small rank has informed me, that Mr. Addison was inexpressibly cha∣grined at this noble conclusion of WINDSOR-FOREST, both as a politician and as a poet. As a politician, because it so highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed so perni∣cious to the liberties of Europe; and as a
<PB N="30" REF="41"/>
poet, because he was deeply conscious that his own CAMPAIGN, that gazette in rhyme, contained no strokes of such genuine and sublime poetry as the conclusion before us.</P>
<P>IT is one of the greatest and most pleasing arts of descriptive poetry, to introduce moral sentences and instructions in an oblique and indirect manner, in places where one natu∣rally expects only painting and amusement. We have virtue, as Mr. POPE remarks, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad. B. 16. in the notes: Ver. 465.</NOTE> put upon us by surprize, and are pleased to find a thing where we should never have looked to meet with it. I must do a noble En∣glish poet the justice to observe, that it is this particular art that is the very distinguishing excellence of COOPERS-HILL; throughout which, the descriptions of places, and images raised by the poet, are still tending to some hint, or leading into some reflection, upon moral life, or political institution; much in the same manner as the real sight of such scenes and prospects is apt to give the mind a
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
composed turn, and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object. This is the great charm of the in∣comparable ELEGY written in a Country Church-Yard. Having mentioned the rustic monuments and simple epitaphs of the swains, the amiable poet falls into a very natural re∣flection:<Q><L>For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</L>
<L>This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,</L>
<L>Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,</L>
<L>Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?</L></Q></P>
<P>OF this art Mr. POPE has exhibited some specimens in the poem we are examining, but not so many as might be expected from a mind so strongly inclined to a moral way of writing. After speaking of hunting the hare, he immediately subjoins, much in the spirit of Denham,
<Q><L>Beasts urg'd by us their fellow beasts pursue,</L>
<L>And learn of man each other to undo. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 124.</NOTE></L></Q>
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
Where he is describing the tyrannies formerly exercised in this kingdom,
<Q><L>Cities laid waste, they storm'd the dens and caves,</L></Q>
He instantly adds with an indignation becom∣ing a true lover of liberty, as such he was,
<Q><L>For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 50.</NOTE></L></Q>
But I am afraid our author in the following passage has fallen into a fault very uncommon in his writings, into a reflection that is very far-fetched and forced;<Q><L>Here waving groves a chequer'd scene display,</L>
<L>And part admit, and part exclude the day;</L>
<L>As some coy nymph her lover's warm address</L>
<L>Nor quite indulges, nor can quite repress.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 16.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>BOHOURS would rank this comparison among false thoughts and Italian conceits; such particularly as abound in the works of Marino. The fallacy consists in giving design and artifice to the wood, as well as to the
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
coquette; and in putting the light of the sun and the warmth of a lover on a level.</P>
<P>A PATHETIC reflection, properly intro∣duced into a descriptive poem, will have a still greater force and beauty, and more deep∣ly interest a reader, than a moral one. When POPE therefore has described a pheasant shot, he breaks out into a very masterly excla∣mation;<Q><L>Ah! what avail his glossy varying dyes,</L>
<L>His purple crest, and scarlet-circled eyes,</L>
<L>The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,</L>
<L>His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold!
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 115.</NOTE></L></Q> where this exquisite picture heightens the distress, and powerfully excites the commi∣seration, of the reader. To this purpose I may add a passage in an ODE to Fancy, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dodsley's Miscell. Pag. 80. Ver. 3.</NOTE> which I have heard commended for a simi∣lar stroke of a pathetic nature. After passing through various scenes, the poet leads us,<Q><L>—To some abby's mouldering towers,</L>
<L>Where to avoid cold wintry showers,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="45"/> The naked beggar shivering lies,</L>
<L>While whistling tempests round her rise,</L>
<L>And trembles, least the tottering wall</L>
<L>Should on her sleeping infants fall.</L></Q> The object of fear indicated in the two last lines, is, I believe, new and unborrowed, and interests us in the scene described. Under this head it would be unpardonable to omit a capital, and, I think, the most excellent ex∣ample extant, of the beauty here intended, in the third Georgic of Virgil: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 525.</NOTE> The poet having mournfully described a heifer struck with a pestilence, and falling down dead in the middle of his work, artfully reminds us of his former services;
<Q><L>Quid labor aut benefacta juvant? quid vomere terras</L>
<L>Invertisse graves? <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By the epithet GRAVES Virgil insinuates after his manner the difficulty and laboriousness of the work.</NOTE></L></Q>
This circumstance would have been sufficient, as it raised our pity from a motive of grati∣tude; but with this circumstance the tender
<PB N="35" REF="46"/>
Virgil was not content; what he adds there∣fore of the natural undeviating temperance of the animal, who cannot have contracted dis∣ease by excess, and who for that reason de∣served a better fate, is moving beyond com∣pare:<Q><L>—Atqui non massica Bacchi</L>
<L>Munera, non illis epulae nocuere repostae!</L>
<L>Frondibus et vitu pascuntur simplicis herbae;</L>

<P>OF English poets, perhaps, none have excel∣led the ingenious Mr. Dyer in this oblique instruction, into which he frequently steals imperceptibly, in his little descriptive poem entitled GRONGAR HILL, where he disposes every object so as it may give occasion for some observation on human life. Denham himself is not superiour to this neglected author, in this particular. After painting a landschape very extensive and diversified, he adds;<Q><L>Thus is nature's vesture wrought</L>
<L>To instruct our wandring thought,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="47"/> Thus she dresses green and gay,</L>
<L>To disperse our cares away!</L></Q> Another view from his favourite spot, gives him an opportunity, for sliding into the fol∣lowing moralities.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this light also his poem on the Ruins of Rome deserves a perusal.

<L>Still we tread the same coarse way,</L>
<L>The present's still a cloudy day.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE unexpected insertion of such reflections, imparts to us the same pleasure that we feel, when in wandering through a wilderness or grove, we suddenly behold in the turning of the walk, a statue of some VIRTUE or MUSE.</P>

IT may be observed in general, that des∣cription of the external beauties of nature, is usually the first effort of a young genius, before he hath studied manners and passions. Some of Milton's most early, as well as most exquisite pieces, are his Lycidas, L'Allegro, and Il Penseroso; if we may except his Ode on the Nativity of Christ, which is indeed prior in the order of time, and in which a penetrating critic might have discovered the seeds of that boundless imagination, which was one day to produce the Paradise Lost. This ode, which, by the way, is not sufficiently read, or admired, is also of the descriptive kind; but the objects of his description are great, and striking to the imagination; the false gods and goddesses of the Heathen forsaking their temples on the birth of our saviour, divina∣tion and oracles at an end! which facts though perhaps not historically true, are poetically beautiful.<Q><L>The lonely mountains o'er,</L>
<L>And the resounding shore,</L>
<L>A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament!</L>

chiefly on this ode as much less celebrated than L'Allegro and Il Pensoroso, which are now universally known, but which by a strange fatality lay in a sort of obscurity, the private enjoyment of a few curious readers, till they were set to admirable music by Mr. Handel. And indeed this Volume of Milton's miscellaneous poems has not till very lately met with suitable regard. Shall I offend any rational admirer of POPE by remarking, that these juvenile descriptive poems of Milton, as well as his latin elegies, are of a strain far more exalted than any the former author can boast? Let me add at the same time, what justice obliges me to add, that they are far more incorrect. For in the very ode before us, occur one or two passages, that are pue∣rile and affected, to a degree not to be paral∣lelled in the purer, but less elevated, composi∣tions of POPE. The season being winter, Mil∣ton has said, that in honour to Jesus,
<Q><L>Nature in awe to him</L>
<L>Had dofft her gawdy trim.</L></Q>
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>

<P>IT would be unpardonable to conclude these remarks on descriptive poesy, without taking notice of the SEASONS of Thomson, who had peculiar and powerful talents for
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
this species of composition. Let the reader therefore pardon a digression, if such it be, on his merits and character. Thomson was blessed with a strong and copious fancy; he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and original images, which he painted from nature itself, and from his own actual obser∣vations: his descriptions have therefore a dis∣tinctness and truth, which are utterly wanting to those, of poets who have only copied from each other, and have never looked abroad on the objects themselves. Thomson was accus∣tomed to wander away into the country for days and for weeks, attentive to, <Q REND="inline">"each rural sight, each rural sound;"</Q> while many a poet who has dwelt for years in the Strand, has attempted to describe fields and rivers, and generally succeeded accordingly. Hence that nauseous repetition of the same circum∣stances; hence that disgusting impropriety of introducing what may be called a set of here∣ditary images, without proper regard to the age, or climate, or occasion, in which they were formerly used. Though the diction of
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>
the SEASONS is sometimes harsh and inharmo∣nious, and sometimes turgid and obscure, and though in many instances, the numbers are not sufficiently diversified by different pauses, yet is this poem on the whole, from the num∣berless strokes of nature in which it abounds, one of the most captivating and amusing in our language, and which, as its beauties are not of a fugacious kind, as depending on par∣ticular customs and manners, will ever be perused with delight. The scenes of Thom∣son are frequently as wild and romantic as those of Salvator Rosa, pleasingly varied with precipices and torrents, and <Q REND="inline">"castled cliffs,"</Q> and deep vallies, with piny mountains, and the gloomiest caverns. Innumerable are the little circumstances in his descriptions, totally unobserved by all his predecessors. What poet hath ever taken notice of the leaf, that towards the end of autumn,<Q><L>Incessant rustles from the mournful grove,

Thus having spoken of the roaring of the savages in the wilderness of Africa, he introduces a captive, who though just escaped from <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 925.</NOTE> prison and slavery under the tyrant of Morocco, is so terrified and astonished at the dreadful uproar, that
<Q><L>The wretch half wishes for his bonds again.</L></Q>

<L>Th'impatient merchant, wondering waits in vain,</L>
<L>And Mecca saddens at the long delay.</L></Q> And thus, lastly, in describing the pestilence that destroyed the British troops at the siege of Carthagena, he has used a circumstance inimitably lively, picturesque, and striking to the imagination; for he says that the admiral not only heard the groans of the sick that echoed from ship to ship, but that he also pen∣sively stood, and listened at midnight to the dashing of the waters, occasioned by throw∣ing the dead bodies into the sea;

A minute and particular enumeration of cir∣cumstances judiciously selected, is what chief∣ly discriminates poetry from history, and ren∣ders the former, for that reason, a more close and faithful representation of nature than the

latter. And if our poets would accustom themselves to contemplate fully every object, before they attempted to describe it, they would not fail of giving their readers more new images than they generally do. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A summer evening, for instance, after a shower, has been frequently described: but never, that I can recollect, so justly as in the following lines, whose greatest beauty is that hinted above, a simple enumeration of the appearances of nature, and of what is actually to be seen at such a time.

THESE observations on Thomson, which however would not have been so large, if there had been already any considerable cri∣ticism on his character, might be still aug∣mented by an examination and developement of the beauties in the Loves of the birds, in SPRING, verse 580. A view of the torrid zone in SUMMER, verse 626. The rise of fountains and rivers in AUTUMN, verse 781. A man perishing in the snows, in WINTER, verse 277, and the wolves descending from the Alps, and and a view of winter within the polar circle, verse 809, which are all of them highly finished originals, excepting a few of those blemishes intimated above. WINTER is in my apprehension the most valuable of these four poems, the scenes of it, like those of Il Pen∣seroso of Milton, being of that awful, and
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
solemn, and pensive kind, on which a great genius best delights to dwell.</P>
<P>MR. POPE it seems was of opinion, that descriptive poetry is a composition as absurd as a feast made up of sauces: and I know many other persons that think meanly of it. I will not presume to say it is equal, either in dignity or utility, to those compositions that lay open the internal constitution of man, and that IMITATE characters, manners, and sen∣timents. I may however remind such con∣temners of it, that, in a sister-art, landschape∣painting claims the very next rank to history∣painting; being ever preferred to single por∣traits, to pieces of still-life, to droll figures, to fruit and flower-pieces; that Titian thought it no diminution of his genius, to spend much of his time in works of the former species; and that, if their principles lead them to condemn Thomson, they must also condemn the Georgics of Virgil, and the greatest part of the noblest descriptive poem extant, I mean, that of Lucretius.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="63"/>
WE are next to speak of the LYRIC pieces of POPE. He used to declare, that if Mr. Dry∣den had finished a translation of the Iliad, he would not have attempted one after so great a master; he might have said with more pro∣priety, I will not write a music-ode after Alexander's Feast, which the variety and har∣mony of its numbers, and the beauty and force of its images, have conspired to place at the head of modern lyric compositions. This of Mr. POPE is, however, indisputably the second of the kind, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The inferiority of Addison's ODE, to POPE, on this subject, is manifest and remarkable. What prosaic tameness and insipi∣dity do we meet with in the following lines? <Q><L>Cecilia's name does all our numbers grace,</L>
<L>From every voice the tuneful accents fly,</L>
<L>In soaring trebles now it rises high,</L>
<L>And now it sinks and dwells upon the base.</L></Q> This almost descends to burlesque. What follows is hardly rhyme, and surely not poetry: <Q><L>Consecrate the place and day,</L>
<L>To music and Cecilia.</L>
<L>Music the greatest <HI>good</HI> that mortals know.—</L>
<L>Music can noble <HI>hints</HI> impart.—</L></Q> There follows in this stanza, which is the third, a description of a subject very trite, Orpheus drawing the beasts about him. POPE shewed his superior judgment in taking no notice of this old story, and selecting a more new, as well as more striking incident, in the life of Orpheus. It was the custom of this time, for almost every rhymer to try his hand in an ode on St. Cecilia; we find many despicable rapsodies, so called, in Tonson's Miscellanies. We have therefore also preserved another, and an earlier ode, of Dryden on this subject. One stanza of which I cannot forbear inserting in this note. It was set to music 1687. by I. Baptista Dragh. <Q><L>What passion cannot music raise and quell!</L>
<L>When Jubal struck the chorded shell,</L>
<L>His list'ning brethren stood around,</L>
<L>And wond'ring on their faces fell,</L>
<L>To worship that celestial sound:</L>
<L>Less than a god they thought there could not dwell,</L>
<L>Within the hollow of that shell,</L>
<L>That spoke so sweetly and so well.</L>
<L>What passion cannot music raise and quell!</L></Q></P> 
<P>This is so complete and engaging a history-piece, that I knew a person of taste who was resolved to have it executed, if an artist could have been found, on one side of his salloon. In which case, said he, the painter has nothing to do, but to substitute colours for words, the design being finished to his hands. The reader doubtless observes the fine effect of the repetition of the last line; as well as the stroke of nature, in making these rude hearers imagine some god lay concealed in this first musician's instrument.</P></NOTE> 
<Q REND="inline">"propior tamen primo quam <PB N="53" REF="64"/> tertio,"</Q> to
use an expression of Quintilian. The first stanza is almost a
perfect concert of itself; every different instrument is described 
<PB N="54" REF="65"/> and illustrated, in numbers, that admirably represent,
and correspond to its different qua∣lities and genius. The beginning of the
se∣cond stanza, on the power which music ex∣erts over the passions,
is a little flat, and by no means equal to the conclusion of that stanza.
The animating song that Orpheus sung to the Argonauts, copied from Valerius
Flaccus, for that of Apollonius is of a different nature, is the happily
chosen subject of the fourth. On hearing which, 
<Q> 
<L>Each chief his sevenfold shield display'd,</L>
<L>And half unsheath'd the shining blade;</L></Q> Which effects of the song, however lively, do not equal the force and
spirit of what Dryden ascribes to the song of his Grecian artist; for
when Timotheus cries out REVENGE, raises the furies, and calls up to
Alexander's view a troop of Grecian ghosts that were slain and left
unburied, inglorious and forgotten, each of them waving a torch in his hand,
and pointing to the hostile temples of the Persians, and demanding
vengeance of their prince, he <PB N="55" REF="66"/> instantly started from
his throne, 
<Q> 
<L>—Seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy,</L></Q> while Thais and the attendant princes rushed out with him, to set fire
to the city. The whole train of imagery in this stanza is alive, sublime,
and animated to an unparallelled degree; the poet had so strongly
possessed himself of the action described, that he places it fully
before the eyes of the reader.</P>
<P>THE descent of Orpheus into hell is grace∣fully introduced in the fourth stanza, as it naturally flowed from the subject of the pre∣ceding one; the description of the infernal regions is well imagined, and the effects of the musician's lyre on the inhabitants of hell, are elegantly translated from the fourth Geor∣gic of Virgil, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 480.</NOTE> and happily adapted to the subject in question. The supplicating song at the beginning of the sixth stanza, is highly pathetic and poetical, especially when he con∣jures the powers below,<Q><PB N="56" REF="67"/>
<L>By the hero's armed shades</L>
<L>Glittering through the gloomy glades,</L>
<L>By the youths that dy'd for love</L>
<L>Wand'ring in the myrtle grove;</L></Q> These images are picturesque and appro∣priated; and these are such notes as might,
<Q><L>Draw iron tears down Pluto's cheek, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton's Il Penseroso.</NOTE></L>
<L>And make hell grant what love did seek.</L></Q>
But the numbers that conclude this stanza are of so burlesque and ridiculous a kind, and have so much the air of an Hudibrastic song at a county election, that one is amazed and con∣cerned to find them in a serious ode, and in an ode of a writer eminently skilled, in gene∣ral, in accommodating his sounds to his sen∣timents.<Q><L>Thus song could prevail</L>
<L>O'er death and o'er hell,</L>
<L>A conquest how hard and how glorious!</L>
<L>Tho' fate had fast bound her</L>
<L>With Styx nine times round her,</L>
<L>Yet music and love were victorious.</L></Q><PB N="57" REF="68"/>
One would imagine that John Dennis, or some hero of the Dunciad, had been here attempting to travesty this description of the restoration of Eurydice to life. It is observable, that this is the very measure, Addison thought was pro∣per to use in the comic character of Sir Trusty; by the introduction of which he has so strange∣ly debased and degraded his opera of Rosa∣mond.<Q><L>How unhappy is he</L>
<L>That is ty'd to a she,</L>
<L>And fam'd for his wit and his beauty;</L>
<L>For of us pretty fellows,</L>
<L>Our wives are so jealous,</L>
<L>They ne'er have enough of our duty.
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act I. Scene II. See also, Scene IV. Act I. A song
of Grideline and Trusty. Act. III. Scene IV.</NOTE></L></Q> These numbers therefore, according to Ad∣dison's ear, conveyed a low and ludicrous idea, instead of being expressive of triumph and exultation, the images here intended to be impressed by POPE.</P>
<P>VIRGIL is again imitated throughout the
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
sixth stanza, which describes the behaviour of Orpheus on the second loss of Eurydice. I wish POPE had inserted that striking circum∣stance, so strongly imagined, of a certain me∣lancholy murmur, or rather dismal shriek, that was heard all around the lakes of Aver∣nus, the moment Orpheus looked back on his wife;
<Q><L>—Terque fragor stagnis auditus Avernis. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Georgic 4, 493.</NOTE></L></Q>
And as prosopopeias are a great beauty in lyric poetry, surely he should not have omit∣ted those natural and pathetic exclamations of Eurydice, the moment she was snatched back, and which she uttered as she was gra∣dually sinking to the shades, especially where she movingly takes her last adieu,
<Q><L>Jamque vale!—</L></Q>
And adds, that she is now surrounded with a vast darkness, <Q REND="inline">"feror ingenti circumdata
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
nocte,"</Q> and in vain stretching out her feeble arms towards him,
<Q><L>Invalidasque tibi tendens, heu! non tua, palmas. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 498.</NOTE></L></Q>
This lively and pathetic attitude would have shone under the hands of POPE. The reader, I presume, feels the effect of the judi∣cious placing in the verse, <HI>heu! non tua,</HI> and of its repetition after <HI>tibi.</HI> The places in which Orpheus, according to POPE, made his lamentations, are not so wild, so savage and dismal, as those mentioned by Virgil; to introduce him <Q REND="inline">"beside the falls of foun∣tains,"</Q> conveys not such an image of deso∣lation and despair, as the caverns on the banks of Strymon and Tanais, the Hyperborean desarts, and the Riphaean solitudes. And to say of Hebrus, only, that it <Q REND="inline">"rolls in mean∣ders,"</Q> is flat and frigid, and does not heighten the melancholy of the place. There is an antithesis in the succeeding lines, <Q REND="inline">"he glows amid Rhodope's snows,"</Q> which I hope the
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
poet did not intend, as it would be a trivial and puerile conceit. The death of Orpheus is expressed with a beautiful brevity and ab∣ruptness, suitable to the nature of the ode;<Q><L>Hark! Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals cries,</L>
<L>Ah! see he dies!</L>
<L>Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he <HI>sung.</HI></L></Q> Where instead of <HI>sung,</HI> Virgil says <HI>vocabat,</HI> which is more natural and tender; and Virgil adds a very moving epithet, that he called <HI>miseram</HI> Eurydicen. I am sensible POPE never intended an exact translation of the passages of the Georgics here alleged; I only hint, that in my humble judgment he has omitted some of the most striking incidents in the story. I have lately seen a manuscript ode, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"On the Use and Abuse of Po∣etry,"</Q> in which Orpheus in considered in ano∣ther, and a higher light, according to ancient mythology, as the first legislator and civilizer of mankind. I shall here insert a stanza of it, containing part of what relates to this subject.<Q><PB N="61" REF="72"/><LG>
<HEAD>ANTISTROPHE. II.</HEAD>
<L>Such was wise Orpheus' moral song,</L>
<L>The lonely cliffs and caves among;</L>
<L>From hollow oak, or mountain-den,</L>
<L>He drew the naked, gazing men,</L>
<L>Or where in turf-built sheds, or rushy bowers,</L>
<L>They shiver'd in cold wintry showers,</L>
<L>Or sunk in heapy snows;</L>
<L>Then sudden, while his melting music stole</L>
<L>With powerful magic o'er each softening soul,</L>
<L>Society, and law, and sacred order rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>EPODE II.</HEAD>
<L>Father of peace and arts! he first the city built;</L>
<L>No more the neighbour's blood was by his neighbour spilt;</L>
<L>He taught to till, and separate the lands;</L>
<L>He fix'd the roving youths in Hymen's myrtle bands;</L>
<L>Whence dear domestic life began,</L>
<L>And all the charities that soften'd man:</L>
<L>The babes that in their father's faces smil'd,</L>
<L>With lisping blandishments their rage beguil'd,</L>
<L>And tender thoughts inspir'd!—&amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q> I am not permitted to transcribe any more, and therefore return to POPE again.</P>
<P>THE beginning of the last stanza of the ode here examined, seems to be a repetition of the
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
subject of the second, the power of music over the passions, which may perhaps be reckoned a blameable tautology; especially as these lines,<Q><L>Music the fiercest grief can charm,</L>
<L>And fate's severest rage disarm;</L>
<L>Music can soften pain to ease,</L>
<L>And make despair and madness please;</L></Q> are inferior, I am afraid, to the former on the same subject, which contain beautiful and po∣etical personifications;<Q><L>Melancholy lifts her head,</L>
<L>Morpheus rouses from his bed,</L>
<L>Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes,</L>
<L>Listning Envy drops her snakes;</L>
<L>Intestine war no more our passions wage,</L>
<L>And giddy factions hear away their rage.</L></Q> It is observable that this ode of POPE, and the Alexander's Feast of Dryden, both of them conclude with an epigram of four lines; a species of wit as flagrantly unsuitable to the dignity, and as foreign to the nature, of the lyric, as it is of the epic muse.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="74"/>
IT is to be regretted, that Mr. Handel has not set to music the former, as well as the latter, of these celebrated odes, in which he has displayed the combined powers of verse and voice, to a wonderful degree. No poem indeed, affords so much various matter for a composer to work upon; as Dryden has here introduced and expressed all the greater passi∣ons, and as the transitions from one to the other are sudden and impetuous. Of which we feel the effects, in the pathetic description of the fall of Darius, that immediately succeeds the joyous praises of Bacchus. The symphony, and air particularly, that accompanies the four words, <Q REND="inline">"fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,"</Q> is strangely moving, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mention of this pathetic air, reminds me of a story of the celebrated Lully, who having been one day accused of ne∣ver setting any thing to music, but the languid verses of Quin∣ault, was immediately animated with the reproach, and as it were seized with a kind of enthusiasm; he ran instantly to his harpsichord, and striking a few cords, sung in recitative these four lines in the Iphigenia of Racine, which are full of the strongest imagery, and are therefore much more difficult to ex∣press in music, than verses of mere sentiment, <Q><L>Un prêtre environné d'une foule cruelle</L>
<L>Portera sur ma fille une main criminelle,</L>
<L>Dechirera son sein, et d'un oeil curieux,</L>
<L>Dans fon coeur palpitant consultera les dieux.</L></Q> One of the company has often declared that they all thought themselves present at this dreadful spectacle, and that the notes with which Lully accompanied these words, erected the hair of their heads with horror.</P> 
<P>The opinion of Boileau concerning music is remarkable; he asserts, qu'on ne peut jamais faire un bon opera; parceque la musique ne sauroit narrer; que les passions n'y peuvent etre peintes dans toute l'etenduë qu'elles demandent; que d'ail∣leurs elle ne sauroit souvent mettre en chant les expressions vraiment sublimes et courageuses.</P></NOTE> and consists of a few <PB N="64" REF="75"/> simple and
touching notes, without any of those intricate variations, and affected
divi∣sions, into which, in compliance with a vici∣ous and vulgar taste,
this great master hath sometimes descended. Even this piece of Handel,
so excellent on the whole, is not free from one or two blemishes of this
sort, particularly in the air, 
<Q REND="inline">"with ravish'd ears,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE moderns have perhaps practised no species of poetry with so little success, and with such indisputable inferiority to the anci∣ents,
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
as the ODE; which seems owing to the harshness and untuneableness of modern languages, abounding in monosyllables, and crowded with consonants. This particularly is the case of the English, whose original is Teutonic, and which therefore, is not so mu∣sical as the Italian, the Spanish, or even the French, as not having so great a quantity of words derived from the Latin. But the Latin language itself, as well as all others, must yield to the unparalled sweetness and copious∣ness of the Greek. <Q REND="inline">"Tantò est sermo graecus latino jucundior, says Quintilian, in his twelfth book, ut nostri poetae, quoties dulce carmen esse voluerunt, illorum id nominibus exornent."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He gives some instances that are curious and worth attention.

celebrated of the mo∣dren lyrics, we may observe, that the stanza of
Petrarch, which has been adopted by all his successors, displeases
the ear, by its tedi∣ous uniformity, and by the number of iden∣tical cadences.
And indeed to speak truth, there appears to be little valuable in Petrarch,
except the purity of his diction. His senti∣ments even of love, are
metaphysical and far fetched, neither is there much variety in his
subjects, or fancy in his method of treating them; Metastasio is a much
better lyric poet. When Boileau attempted an ode, he exhibited a glaring proof,
of what will be more fully insisted on in the course of this Essay,
that the writer whose grand, characteristical talent, is
<PB N="67" REF="78"/> satyric or moral poetry, will never succeed, with
equal merit, in the higher branches of this art. In his ode on the taking
Namur, are instances of the
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An instance of the FIRST, is to be found in the third stanza. Of the SECOND, in the ninth stanza,

confirmation of the ruling passion of this author, that he could not
conclude his ode, but with a severe stroke on his old anta∣gonist
Perrault, though the majesty of this species of compositions is so much
injured, by descending to personal satire. The name of Malherbe is
respectable, as he was the first re∣former of the French poesy, and the
first who gave his countrymen any idea of a legi∣timate ode, though his own
pieces have hardly any thing but harmony to recommend them. The odes of la
Motte, are fuller of delicate <PB N="68" REF="79"/> sentiment, and
philosophical reflection, than of imagery, of figures, and poetry. There are
particular stanzas eminently good, but not one entire ode. Some of
Rousseau, particu∣larly that to Fortune, and some of his psalms; and
one or two of Voltaire, particularly, to the king of Prussia, on his
accession to the throne, and on Meaupertuis's travels to the north, to
measure the degrees of the meridian towards the equator, seem to rise
above that correct mediocrity which distinguishes the lyric poetry of the
French. In this ode of Voltaire, we find a prosopopeia of Americus, and
afterwards a speech of Newton, on the design of this traveller and his
companions, that approach to the sublime,<Q><L>Comme ils parloient ainsi, Newton dans l'empirée,</L>
<L>Newton les regardoit, et du ciel entr'ouvert</L>

<Q><PB N="69" REF="80"/>
<L>Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame,</L></Q>
if I should say we have lately seen two or three lyric pieces, superiour to any he has left us; I mean an Ode on Lyric Poetry, and another to Lord Huntingdon, by Doctor Aken∣side; and a Chorus of British Bards, by Mr. Gilbert West, at the end of the Institution of the Order of the Garter. Both these are written with regular returns of the Strophe, Antistrophe. and Epode, which gives a truely Pindaric variety to the numbers, that is want∣ing not only to the best French and Italian, but even to the best Latin odes. In the pieces here commended, the figures are strong, and the transitions bold, and there is a just mix∣ture of sentiment and imagery: and particularly, they are animated with a noble spirit of liber∣ty. I must refer the reader to the characters of Alcaeus and of Milton in the two first, and to the stanza of Mr. West's ode on the barons procuring magna charta, which I chuse to give at length, because it contains almost all

<P>THE next LYRIC compositions of Pope, are two choruses inserted in a very heavy tragedy, altered from Shakespear by the Duke of Buck∣ingham; in which we see, that the most accu∣rate observation of dramatic rules without genius, is of no effect. These choruses are

extremely elegant and harmonious; but are they not chargeable with the fault, which Aristotle imputes to many of Euripides, that they are foreign and adventitious to the sub∣ject, and contribute nothing towards the ad∣vancement of the main action? Whereas the chorus ought, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> to be a part or member of the one Whole, cooperate with it, and help to accela∣rate the intended event; as is constantly, adds the philosopher, the practise of Sophocles. Whereas these reflections of POPE on the baneful influences of war, on the arts and learning, and on the universal power of love, seem to be too general, are not sufficiently appropriated, do not rise from the subject and occasion, and might be inserted with e∣qual propriety in twenty other tragedies. This remark of Aristotle, tho he does not himself produce any examples, may be verified from the following among many others. In the Phoenicians of Euripides, they sing

<P>THE judicious author of the tragedy of Elfrida, hath given occasion to a kind of controversy among the more curious critics, concerning the utility of the chorus, which, after the model of the ancients, he hath en∣deavoured to revive. To imagine, that the great Grecian masters retained it only out of respect to its antiquity, and from no intrin∣sic
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
valuableness or propriety of the thing, can scarcely be imagined. The sentiments of the excellent Brumoy are moderate and rational, and seem to comprehend all that is necessary to be said on this subject. <Q REND="inline">"I know says he, the chorus is attended with inconve∣niences, and that it has sometimes com∣pelled the ancients to violate probability; but it notwithstanding is apparent by the use they sometimes made of it, that its advantages exceed its inconveniences. Sophocles had the address to withdraw his chorus for a few moments, when their absence was necessary, as in the Ajax. If the chorus therefore incommodes the poet, and puts him under difficulties, he must charge it solely to his own want of dexterity. What advantage, on the other hand, may he not reap, from a body of actors that fill the stage; that render more lively, striking, and sensible, the continuity of the action, and give it the air of greater PROBABILITY, since it is not natural or con∣ceivable, that a great and illustrious action,
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
such as a revolution in a state, should pass without witnesses. We perceive and feel a kind of void on our stage, on account of the ab∣sence of choruses; and the successful attempt of Racine, who adopted and revived the use of them in his ATHALIA and ESTHER, were sufficient, one would imagine, to undeceive and convince us, of their importance, and utility. The banishment of the chorus has been the necessary consequence of the cus∣tom of the moderns, to take for their repre∣sentations, ALL kinds of subjects; whereas the ancients treated only such actions as were publicly transacted: and to fill, and indeed overcharge the action with incidents and surprizes. For how could these sub∣jects, and these various crowded events and incidents, have been possibly introduced in a public place, exposed to the view of cour∣tiers and the people, while the generality of our tragedies turn on particular and pri∣vate affairs, ou la cour et le peuple n'en∣trent souvent pour rien? the Athenian spec∣tators were ever accustomed to concern
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
themselves in all public affairs, and to be witnesses and judges of them. The modern stage, by its disuse of the chorus, may per∣haps have gained a great number of fine subjects for tragedy; yet, in return, it is burthened with confidents, it looses the continuity of action, and is deprived of the magnificent spectacle that serves to support that action, and which is, if I may be al∣lowed the expression, le <HI>fonds,</HI> ou l <HI>'accom∣pagnement</HI> du tableau."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Theatre de Grecs.

<P>I THOUGHT it more equitable, as well as more convincing, to quote at large the words of this admirable critic, whose work is one of the most valuable that his elegant nation hath produced, than to adopt, as some have done with small variations, his opinion, with∣out acknowledging the debt. An apology would be necessary for this digression, if it was not my professed design in this Essay, to expatiate into such occasional disquisitions, as

naturally arise from the subject; it has how∣ever kept us too long from surveying a valuable literary curiosity, I mean the earliest produc∣tion of POPE, written when he was not twelve years old, his ODE ON SOLITUDE. The first sketches of such an artist ought highly to be prized. Different geniuses unfold them∣selves, at different periods of life. In some minds the ore is a long time in ripening. Not only inclination, but opportunity and encou∣ragement, a proper subject, or a proper pa∣tron, influence the exertion or the suppression of genius. These stanzas on Solitude, are a strong instance of that contemplative and mo∣ral turn, which was the distinguishing charac∣teristic of our poet's mind. An ode of Cowley which he produced at the age of thirteen years, is of the same cast, and perhaps not in the least inferior to this of POPE. The voluminous Lopez de Vega, is commonly, but I fear incredibly, reported by the Spani∣ards, to have composed verses when he was five years old; and Torquato Tasso, the se∣cond
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
of the Italian poets, for that wonderful original Dante is the first, is said to have re∣cited poems and orations of his writing, when he was seven. It is however certain, which is more extraordinary, that he produced his Rinaldo in his eighteenth year, no bad pre∣cursor to the Gierusalemma Liberata, and no small effort of that genius, which was one day to shew, how fine an epic poem the Ita∣lian language, notwithstanding the vulgar imputation of effeminacy, was capable of producing.</P>
<P>THOSE who are fond of biographical anec∣dotes, which are some of the most amusive and instructive parts of history, will be per∣haps pleased with the following particulars in the life of POPE. He frequently declared, that the time of his beginning to write verses, was so very early in his life, that he could scarcely recal it to his memory. When he was yet a child, his father, who had been a mer∣chant in London, and retired to Binfield with about twenty thousand pounds, would fre∣quently
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
order him to make English verses. It seems he was difficult to be pleased, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Works, vol. 4. pag. 18.</NOTE> and would make the lad correct them again and again. When at last he approved them, he took great pleasure in perusing them, and would say, <Q REND="inline">"these are good RHYMES."</Q> These early praises of a tender and respected parent, cooperating with the natural inclina∣tion of the son, may possibly be the causes that fixed our young bard in a resolution of becoming eminent in this art. He was taught to read very early by an aunt; and of his own indefatigable industry learned to write, by copying printed books, which he executed with great neatness and exactness. When he was eight years old, he was put under the direction of one Taverner, a priest, who taught him the rudiments of the latin and greek tongues together. About this time he accidentally met with Ogilby's translation of Homer, which, notwithstanding the deadness and insipidity of the versification, arrested
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
his attention by the force of the story. The Ovid of Sandys fell next in his way; and it is said, that the raptures these translations gave him were so strong, that he spoke of them with pleasure to the period of his life. About ten, being now at school at Hide-park corner, whither he went from a popish semi∣nary at Twiford, near Winchester, he was carried sometimes to the playhouse; and be∣ing struck, we may imagine, with theatrical representations, he turned the chief events into a kind of play, made up of a number of speeches from Ogilby's translation, connected with verses of his own. He persuaded the upper boys to act this piece, which, from its curiosity, one would have been glad to have beheld. The master's gardener represented the character of Ajax; and the actors were dressed after the pictures of his favourite Ogil∣by, far the best part of that book, as they were designed and engraved by artists of note. At twelve, he retired with his father into Windsor-Forest; and it was there he first perused the writings of Waller, of Spenser,
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
and of Dryden. The second is said to have made a poet of Cowley; that Ogilby should give our author his first poetic pleasures, is a remarkable circumstance. On the first sight of Dryden he abandoned the rest, having now found an author, whose cast was exactly con∣genial with his own. His works therefore he studied, with equal pleasure and attention: he placed them before his eyes as a model; of which more will be said in the course of these papers. He copied not only his harmo∣nious versification, but the very turns of his periods. It was hence he was enabled to give to rhyme all the harmony of which it is capable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See WORKS, vol. 4. pag. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>ABOUT this time, that is about fifteen years old, he began to write his ALCANDER, an epic poem, of which he himself speaks with so much amiable frankness and ingenuity, in a passage restored to his excellent preface to his works. <Q REND="inline">"I confess there was a time when
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
I was in love with myself, and my first productions were the children of self-lvoe upon innocence.

QUINTILIAN, whose knowledge of human nature was consummate, has observed, that nothing very correct and faultless, is to be ex∣pected in very early years, from a truly ele∣vated genius: that a generous extravagance and exuberance are its proper marks, and that a premature exactness is a certain evi∣dence of future flatness and sterility. His words are incomparable, and worthy conside∣ration. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. Instit. Cap. 4. ad init.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">"Audeat haec aetas plura, et INVE∣NIAT, et inventis gaudeat, sint licet illa non satis interim sicca et severa.

Whether these early productions of POPE, would not have appeared to Quintilian to be rather too finished, correct, and pure, and what he would have inferred concerning them, is too delicate a subject for me to enlarge upon. Let me rather add an entertaining anecdote. When Guido and Domenichino had each of them painted a picture in the Church of Saint Andrew, Annibal Carrache, their master, was pressed to declare, which of his two pupils had excelled. The picture of Guido represented Saint Andrew on his knees before the cross, that of Domenichino represented the flagel∣lation of that apostle. Both of them in their different kinds were capital pieces, and were painted in fresco, opposite each other, to eter∣nize, as it were, their rivalship and conten∣tion
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
Guido, said Carrache, has performed as a master, and Domenichino as a scholar. But, added he, the worth of the scholar is more valuable than that of the master. In truth, one may perceive faults in the picture of Domenichino that Guido has avoided; but then there are noble strokes, not to be found in that of his rival. It was easy to discern a genius that promised to produce beauties, to which the sweet, the gentle, and the grace∣ful Guido would never aspire.</P>
<P>The last piece that belongs to this Section, is the ODE entitled, THE DYING CHRISTIAN TO HIS SOUL, written in imitation of the well known sonnet of Hadrian, addrest to his departing spirit; concerning which it was our author's judicious opinion, that the dimi∣nutive epithets with which it abounds, such as Vagula, Blandula, were by no means expressions of levity and indifference, but rather of endear∣ment, of tenderness and concern. This ode was written we find at the desire of Steele; and our poet in a letter to him on that oc∣casion,
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
says—<Q REND="inline">"You have it, as Cowley calls it, just warm from the brain; it came to me the first moment I waked this morn∣ing; yet you'll see, it was not so absolutely inspiration, but that I had in my head, not only the verses of Hadrian, but the fine fragment of Sappho."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Longinus, sect. 10. quoted by him, is a model of that sublime which combines together many various and opposite passions and sensations, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>IT appears however that our author had another composition in his head, besides those he here refers to, for there is a close and sur∣prising resemblance <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See THE ADVENTURER, vol. 2.

<P>I AM sensible of the difficulty of distin∣guishing resemblances from thefts; and of what a late critic has urged, that a want of seeming originality arises frequently, not from a barrenness and timidity of genius, but from invincible necessity, and the nature of things: that the works of those who profess an art, whose essence is imitation, must needs be stamped with a close resemblance to each other, since the objects material or animate, extraneous or internal, which they all imi∣tate, lie equally open to the observation of all, and are perfectly similar. Descriptions there∣fore that are faithful and just, MUST BE UNI∣FORM AND ALIKE; the first copier may be perhaps entitled to the praise of priority, but a succeeding one ought not certainly to be condemned for plagiarism.</P>
<P>THESE general observations however true, do not, I think, extend to the case before us, because not only the thoughts, but even the
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
words are copied; and because the images, especially the last, are such, as are not imme∣diately impressed by sensible objects, and which therefore, on account of their SINGU∣LARITY, did not lie in common for any poet to seize. Let us however moderate the matter, and say, what perhaps is the real fact, that POPE fell into the thoughts of Flatman una∣wares, and without design; and having for∣merly read him, imperceptibly adopted this passage, even without knowing that he had borrowed it. That this will frequently hap∣pen, is evident from the following curious particulars related by Menage, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anti-baillet. tom. II. 208.</NOTE> which, be∣cause much has been said of late on this head by many writers of criticism, I shall here insert. <Q REND="inline">"I have often heard M. Chapelain, and M. Dandilly declare, that they wrote the following line,"</Q>
<Q><L>D'arbires de la paix, de foudres de la guerre;</L></Q>
without knowing it was in Malherbe; and the moment I am making this remark, recollect
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
that the same thing happened to M. Furetiere. I have often heard Corneille declare, that he inserted in his Polyeucte, two celebrated lines concerning fortune, without knowing they were the property of M. Godeau bishop of Vence;
<Q><L>Et comme elle a l'eclat du Verre</L>
<L>Elle en a la fragilitè—</L></Q></P>
<P>GODEAU had inserted them in an ode to Car∣dinal Richleiu, fifteen years before Polyeucte was written. Porphyry in a fragment of his book on Philology, quoted by Euse∣bius, in the tenth book of his <HI>Evangelical preparation,</HI> makes mention of an author named Aretatedes, who composed an entire treatise on this sort of resemblances. And St. Jerom relates, that his preceptor Do∣natus, explaining that sensible passage in Terence, <Q REND="inline">"Nihil est dictum quod non dictum suit prius,"</Q> railed severely at the ancients, for taking from his his best thoughts; <Q REND="inline">"Pereant qui ante nos, nostra dixerunt."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="103"/>
MENAGE makes these observations on oc∣casion of a passage in the Poetics of Vida, intended to justify borrowing the thoughts and even expressions of others, which passage is very applicable to the subject before us:<Q><L>Aspice ut exuvias, veterumque insignia nobis</L>
<L>Aptemus; rerum accipimus nunc clara reperta,</L>

 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3. v. 255.</NOTE></L></Q> Menage adds, that he intended to compile a regular treatise on the thefts and imitations of the poets. As his reading was very exten∣sive, his work would probably have been very entertaining.

<P>I SHOULD be sensibly touched at the injuri∣ous imputation of so ungenerous, and indeed impotent a design, as that of attempting to diminish, or fully the reputation of so valu∣able a writer as POPE, by the most distant hint, or accusation of his being a plagiary; a writer, to whom the English poesy, and the English language is everlastingly indebted: but we may say of his imitations, what his poetical father Dryden said of another, who deserved not such a panegyric so justly as our author: <Q REND="inline">"HE INVADES AUTHORS LIKE A MONARCH, AND WHAT WOULD BE THEFT IN OTHER POETS, IS ONLY VICTORY IN HIM."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On Dram. poesy. p. 61.</NOTE></Q> For indeed he never works on the same subject with another, without heightening the piece with more masterly strokes, and a more artful pencil. And, as was observed of Augustus, what he finds

Those who flattered themselves, that they should diminish the reputation of Boi∣leau, by printing, in the manner of a com∣mentary at the bottom of each page of his works, the many lines he has borrowed from Horace and Juvenal, were grossly deceived. The verses of the ancients, which this poet hath turned into French with so much ad∣dress, and which he hath happily made so homogeneous, and of a piece with the rest of the work, that every thing seems to have been conceived in a continued train of thought, by the very same person, confer as much honour on M. Despreaux, as the verses which are purely his own.

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the ESSAY on Criticism.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now arrived at a poem of that species, for which our author's ge∣nius was particularly turned, the DIDACTIC and the MORAL; it is therefore, as might be expected, a master-piece in its kind. I have been sometimes inclined to think, that the praises Addison has bestowed on it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 253.</NOTE> were a little partial and invidious. <Q REND="inline">"The observa∣tions, says he, follow one another, like those in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer."</Q> It is however certain, that the poem before us is by no means destitute of a just integrity, and a lucid order: each of the precepts and re∣marks naturally introduce the succeeding ones, so as to form an entire whole. The ingeni∣ous Mr. Hurd, hath also usefully shewn, that
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
Horace observed a strict method, and unity of design, in his epistle to the Pisones, and that altho the connexions are delicately fine and almost imperceptible, like the secret hinges of a well-wrought box, yet they art∣fully and closely unite each part together, and give coherence, uniformity, and beauty to the work. The Spectator adds; <Q REND="inline">"The ob∣servations in this essay are <HI>some</HI> of them <HI>un∣common;</HI>"</Q> there is, I fear, a small mixture of ill-nature in these words; for this ESSAY tho' on a beaten subject, abounds in many new remarks, and original rules, as well as in many happy and beautiful illustrations, and applications of the old ones. We are indeed amazed to find such a knowledge of the world, such a maturity of judgment, and such a penetration into human nature, as are here displayed, in so very young a writer as was POPE, when he produced this ESSAY; for he was not twenty years old. Correct∣ness and a just taste, are usually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art; but a clear head, and strong sense were
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
the characteristical qualities of our author, and every man soonest displays his radical excellencies. If his predominant talent be warmth and vigor of imagination, it will break out in fanciful and luxuriant descrip∣tions, the colouring of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing. If his chief force lies in the understanding rather than in the imagination, it will soon appear by solid and manly observations on life or learning, ex∣pressed in a more chast and subdued style. The former will frequently be hurried into obscurity or turgidity, and a false grandeur of diction; the latter will seldom hazard a figure, whose usage is not already established, or an image beyond common life; will always be perspicuous if not elevated; will never dis∣gust, if not transport his readers; will avoid the grosser faults, if not arrive at the greater beauties of composition; The <Q REND="inline">"eloquentiae genus,"</Q> for which he will be distinguished, will not be the <Q REND="inline">"plenum, &amp; erectum, &amp; audax, &amp; praecultum,"</Q> but the <Q REND="inline">"pressum,

<P>DU BOS <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sect. x. 2.</NOTE> fixes the period of time, at which, generally speaking, the poets and the painters have arrived at as high a pitch of perfection, as their geniuses will permit, to be the age of thirty years, or a few years more or less. Virgil was near thirty when he composed his first Eclogue; Horace was a grown man when he began to be talked of at Rome as a poet, having been formerly engaged in a busy military life. Racine was about the same age when his ANDROMACHE, which may be regarded as his first good tragedy, was played. Corneille was more than thirty
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
when his CID appeared. Despreaux was full thirty when he published his satires, such as we now have them; Moliere was full forty when he wrote the first of those comedies, on which his reputation is founded. But to excell in this species of composition, it was not sufficient for Moliere to be only a great poet; but it was more necessary for him to gain a thorough knowledge of men and the world, which is seldom attained so early in life, but without which, the best poet would be able to write but very indifferent comedies. Raphael was about thirty years old also, when he displayed the beauty and sublimity of his genius in the Vatican. For it is there we be∣hold the first of his works, that are worthy the great name he at present so deservedly pos∣sesses. When our Shakespear wrote his LEAR, Milton his PARADISE LOST, Spenser his FAIRY QUEEN, and Dryden his MUSIC ODE, they were all of them past the middle age of man. From this short review it ap∣pears, that few poets ripened so early as POPE; who seems literally and strictly to have
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
fulfilled the precept of Horace in each of it's circumstances;
<Q><L>Multa tulit, fecitque PUER;</L></Q>
he was laborious and indefatigable in his pur∣suits of learning;
<Q><L>—Sudavit et alsit;</L></Q>
and above all, what is of the greatest conse∣quence in preserving each faculty of the mind in due vigour,
<Q><L>Abstinuit venere et vino;</L></Q>
these are the two temptations to which a youthful bard is principally subject, and into whose snares he generally falls. If the ima∣gination be lively, the passions will be strong. True genius seldom resides in a cold and phleg∣matic constitution. The same temperament, and the same sensibility that makes a poet or a painter, will be apt to make a man a lover and a debauchee. POPE was happily secured from falling into these common failings, the bane of so many others, by the weakness and
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
delicacy of his body, and the bad state of his health. The sensual vices were too violent for so tender a frame; he never fell into intemperance and dissipation. May I add, that even his bodily make was of use to him as a writer; for one who was acquainted with the heart of man, and the secret springs of our actions, has observed with great penetra∣tion; <Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon's Essays. 44.</NOTE>It is good to consider deformity, not as a signe, which is more deceivable, but as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect.

He had no occasion to distract his thoughts by being sollicitous, <Q REND="inline">"de lodice paranda;"</Q> he needed not to wait,

twenty thousand pounds. As he was a papist he could not purchase, nor put his money to interest on real security; and as he adhered to the interests of King James, he he made a point of conscience not to lend it to the new government;

To descend from the widest and comprehensive views of nature, and weigh out hops for a brewing, must be invincibly disgusting to a true genius; to be able to build imaginary palaces of the most exqui∣site architecture, but yet not to pay a car∣penter's bill, is a cutting mortification and disgrace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Adventurer, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 50.</NOTE></Q></P>

<PB N="110" REF="121"/>
and the dissipation, that accompany abundance. And perhaps the fortune most truly desireable, and the situation most pre∣cisely proper for a young poet, are marked out in that celebrated saying of Charles the ninth of France; <Q REND="inline">"equi et poetae ALENDI sunt, non SAGINANDI."</Q></P>
<P>THE ESSAY ON CRITICISM, which occa∣sioned the introduction of these reflections, was first, I am well informed, written in prose, according to the precept of Vida, and the practice of Racine.<Q><L>Quinetiam, prius effigiem formare, SOLUTIS,</L>

It is somewhere remarked by Dryden, I think, that none but a poet is qualified to judge of a poet. The maxim is however contradicted by experience. Aristotle is said indeed to have written one ode; but neither Bossu nor Hurd, are poets. The penetrating author of the Reflexions on Poetry, Painting, and Music, will for ever be read with delight, and with profit by all ingenious artists; il ne savait pourtant pas la musique, says Voltaire, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Louis 14. p. 354.</NOTE> il n'avoit jamais pu faire de vers, &amp; n'avoit pas un tableau: mais il avoit beaucoup lû, vû, entendû, &amp; reflechi. And Lord Shaftes∣bury speaks with some indignation on this subject; if a musician performs his part well in the hardest symphonies, he must necessa∣rily know the notes, and understand the rules of harmony and music. But must a man, therefore, who has an ear, and has studied the rules of music, of necessity have a voice or hand? can no one possibly judge a <HI>fiddle,</HI> but who is himself a fidler? can no
<PB N="114" REF="125"/>
one judge a picture, but who is himself a layer of colours? <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Characteristics. v. 3. p. 190.</NOTE> Quintilian and Pliny, who speak of the works of the ancient pain∣ters and statuaries, with so much taste and sentiment, handled not themselves either the pencil or the chissel, nor Longinus nor Dio∣nysius, the harp. But altho' such as have actually performed nothing in the art itself, may not on that account, be totally disquali∣fied to judge with accuracy of any piece of workmanship, yet perhaps a judgment will come with more authority and force from an artist himself. Hence the connoisseurs highly prize the treatise of Rubens, concerning the imitation of antique statues, the art of paint∣ing by Leonardo da Vinci, and the lives of the painters by Vasari. As for the same rea∣sons, Rameau's dissertation on the thorough bass, and the introduction to a good taste in music by the excellent, but neglected, Ge∣miniani, demand a particular regard. The prefaces of Dryden would be equally valu∣able,
<PB N="115" REF="126"/>
if he did not so frequently contradict himself, and advance opinions diametrically opposite to each other. Some of Corneille's discourses on his own tragedies are admirably just. And one of the best pieces of modern criticism, the academy's observations on the Cid, was we know the work of persons who had themselves written well. And our au∣thor's own excellent preface to his translation of the Iliad, one of the best pieces of prose in the English language, is an example how well poets are qualified to be critics.</P></ITEM>

<P> I hardly believe there is in any language a metaphor more appositely applied, or more elegantly expressed, than this of the effects of the warmth of fancy. Locke who has embellished his dry subject with a vast variety of pleasing similitudes and allusions, has a passage relating to the retentiveness of the memory so very like this before us, and so happily worded, that I cannot forbear giving the reader the pleasure of comparing them together; only premising that these two pas∣sages
<PB N="117" REF="128"/>
are patterns of the manner in which the metaphor should be used, and of the method of preserving it unmixed with any other idea, and not continuing it too far. Our minds re∣present to us those tombs to which we are approaching; where though the brass and marble remain, yet the inscriptions are effa∣ced by time, and the imagery moulders away. How much the constitution of our bodies are concerned in this, and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference, that in some, it retains the characters drawn on it like marble, in others like freestone, and in others little better than sand, I shall not here en∣quire; though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes in∣fluence the memory; since we sometimes find, a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas, and the flames of a fever, in a few days CALCINE all those images to dust and confu∣sion, which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay concerning Human Understanding. chap. 10. sect. 5.</NOTE></P>

WITH respect to the truth of this obser∣vation of POPE, experience abundantly evinc∣eth, that the three great faculties of the foul here spoken of are seldom found united in the same person. There have yet existed, but a few transcendant geniuses, who have been singularly blest with this rare assemblage of different talents. All that I can at present recollect, who have at once enjoyed in full vigour, a sublime and splendid imagination, a solid and profound understanding, an exact and tenacious memory, are Herodotus, Plato, Tully, Livy, Tacitus, Galilaeo, Bacon, Des Cartes, Malebranche, Milton, Burnet of the Charterhouse, Berkley and Montesqueiu. Ba∣con in his Novum Organum, divides the hu∣man genius into two sorts; men of dry di∣stinct heads, cool imaginations, and keen ap∣plication; they easily apprehend the diffe∣rences of things, are masters in controversy, and excell in confutation; and these are the most common. The second sort are men of warm fancies, elevated thought, and wide knowledge: they instantly perceive the re∣semblances
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>
of things, and are poets or makers in science, invent arts, and strike out new light wherever they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 40.</NOTE> carry their views.

<P> When Tully attempted poetry, he became as ridiculous as Bolingbroke when he attempted philosophy and divinity; we look in vain for that genius which produced the Dissertation on Parties, in the tedious philosophical works; of which it is no exaggerated satire to say, that the reasoning of them is sophistical and inconclusive, the style diffuse and verbose, and the learning seemingly contained in them not drawn from the originals, but picked up

<P>WHEN Fontaine, whose tales indicated a truly comic genius, brought a comedy on the stage, it was received with a contempt equally unexpected and undeserved. Terence has left us no tragedy, and the Mourning Bride of Congreve, notwithstanding the praises be∣stowed on it by POPE, in the Dunciad, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 3. v. 310. In the notes.</NOTE> is certainly a despicable performance; the plot is unnaturally intricate, and overcharged with incidents, the sentiments trite, and the lan∣guage turgid and bombast. Heemskirk and Teniers could not succeed in a serious and sublime subject of history-painting. The latter, it is well known, designed cartoons for tapestry, representing the history of the Tur∣riani of Lombardy. Both the composition and
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
the expression are extremely indifferent; and some nicer virtuosi have remarked, that in the serious pieces, into which Hogarth has deviated from the natural biass of his genius, there are some strokes of the Ridiculous di∣scernible, which suit not with the dignity of his subject. In his PREACHING OF St. PAUL, a dog snarling at a cat; and in his PHARAOH's DAUGHTER, the figure of the infant Moses, who expresses rather archness than timidity, are alleged as instances, that this artist, unrivalled in his own walk, could not resist the impulse of his imagination to∣wards drollery. His picture, however, of Richard III. is pure and unmixed with any ridiculous circumstances, and strongly impresses terror and amazement. The mo∣desty and good sense of the ancients is, in this particular, as in others, remarkable. The same writer never presumed to undertake more than one kind of dramatic poetry, if we except the CYCLOPS of Euripides. A poet never presumed to plead in public, or to write history, or indeed any considerable
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
work in prose. The same actors never reci∣ted tragedy and comedy; this was observed so long ago, as by Plato, in the third book of his REPUBLIC. They seem to have held that diversity, nay universality, of excellence, at which the moderns frequently aim, to be a gift unattainable by man. We therefore of Great-Britain have perhaps more reason to congratulate ourselves, on two very singular phenomena; I mean, Shakespear's being able to pourtray characters so very different as FALSTAFF, and MACKBETH; and Garrick's being able to personate so inimitably a LEAR, or an ABEL DRUGGER. Nothing can more fully demonstrate the extent and versatility of these two original geniuses. Corneille, whom the French are so fond of opposing to Shake∣spear, produced very contemptible comedies; and the PLAIDEURS of Racine is so close a resemblance of Aristophanes, as it ought not to be here urged. The most universal of authors seems to be Voltaire; who has writ∣ten almost equally well, both in prose and verse; and whom either the tragedy of ME∣ROPE,

or the history of LOUIS XIV, would alone have immortalized.</P></ITEM>

<P>"THE authority claimed by critics may be more justly
opposed, as it is apparently derived from them whom they endeavour to
controul; for we are indebted for a very small part of the rules of writing
to the acuteness of those by whom they are delivered. The critics have
generally no other merit, than that of having read the works of great authors
with attention; they have observed the arrangement of their matter, and the
graces of their expression, and then expect honour and reverence for
precepts, which they never could have inven∣ted; so that practice has
introduced rules, rather than rules have directed practice."</P>

<P>THIS liberal and manly censure of critical bigotry, extends not to those fundamental and indispensable rules, which nature and necessity dictate, and demand to be observed; such, for instance, in the higher kinds of poetry, that the action of the epopea be one, great, and entire; that the hero be eminently distin∣guished, move our concern, and deeply in∣terest us; that the episodes arise easily out of the main fable; that the action commence as near the catastrophe as possible: and in the
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
drama, that no more events be crowded to∣gether, than can be justly supposed to happen during the time of representation, or to be transacted on one individual spot, and the like. But the absurdity here animadverted on, is the scrupulous nicety of those, who bind them∣selves to obey frivolous and unimportant laws; such as, that an epic poem should consist not of less than twelve books; that it should end fortunately; that in the first book there should be no simile; that the exordium should be very simple and unadorned: that in a tragedy, only three personages should ap∣pear at once upon the stage; and that a tragedy must consist of five acts; by the rigid observati∣on of which last unnecessary precept, the poet is deprived of using many a moving story, that would furnish matter enough for three per∣haps, but not for five acts; with others of the like nature. For the rest, as Voltaire ob∣serves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay sur la poesie Epique, pag. 339. Tom. 1.</NOTE> whether the action of an epopea be simple or complex, completed in a month or in a year, or a longer time, whether the
<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
scene be fixed to one spot, as in the Iliad; or that the hero voyages from sea to sea, as in the Odyssey; whether he be furious like Achilles, or pious like Eneas; whether the action pass on land or sea; on the coast of Africa, as in the Luziada of Camoens; in America, as in the Araucana of Alonzo D'Ercilla; in heaven, in hell, beyond the limits of our world, as in the Paradise Lost; all these circumstances are of no consequence: the poem will be for ever an Epic poem, an Heroic poem, at least till another new title be found proportioned to its merit. If you scruple, says Addison, to give the title of an Epic poem to the Paradise Lost of Milton, call it, if you chuse, a DIVINE poem, give it whatever name you please, provided you confess, that it is a work as admirable in its kind as the Iliad. <Q REND="inline">"Ne disputons jamais sur les noms, c'est une puerilitè impardonable."</Q></P></ITEM>

IN the second part of Shaftesbury's ADVICE to an Author, is a judicious and elegant ac∣count of the rise and progress of arts and sciences, in ancient Greece; to subjects of which sort, it were to be wished this author had always confined himself, as he indisputably understood them well, rather than that he had blemished and belied his patriotism, by writing against the religion of his country. I shall give the reader a passage that relates to the origin of criticism, which is curious and just. <Q REND="inline">"When the persuasive arts, which were necessary to be cultivated among a people that were to be convinced before they acted, were grown thus into repute; and the power of moving the affections become the study and emulation of the forward wits and aspiring geniuses of the times; it would necessarily happen, that many geniuses of equal size and strength, though less covetous of public ap∣plause, of power, or of influence over man∣kind, would content themselves with the contemplation merely of these enchanting arts. These they would the better enjoy, the more
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
they refined their taste, and cultivated their ear.—Hence was the origin of CRITICS; who, as arts and sciences advanced, would necessarily come withal into repute; and be∣ing heard with satisfaction in their turn, were at length tempted to become authors, and ap∣pear in public. These were honoured with the name of Sophists; a character which in early times was highly respected. Nor did the gravest philosophers, who were censors of manners, and critics of a higher degree, disdain to exert their criticism on the inferior arts; especially in those relating to speech, and the power of argument and persuasion. When such a race as this was once risen, 'twas no longer possible to impose on mankind, by what was specious and pretending. The pub∣lic would be paid in no false wit, or jingling eloquence. Where the learned critics were so well received, and philosophers themselves dis∣dained not to be of the number; there could not fail to arise critics of an inferior order, who would subdivide the several provinces of this empire."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Characteristics, vol.

<P> FROM their inattention to these particulars, many critics, and particularly the French, have been guilty of great absurdities. When Perrault impotently attempted to ridicule the first stanza of the first Olympic of Pindar, he was ignorant that the poet, in beginning with the praises of WATER<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, alluded to the philosophy of Thales, who taught that water was the principle of all things; and which philosophy, Empedocles the Sicilian, a co∣temporary of Pindar, and a subject of Hiero to whom Pindar wrote, had adopted in his beautiful poem. Homer and the Greek tra∣gedians have been likewise censured, the for∣mer for protracting the Iliad after the death of Hector; and the latter, for continuing the AJAX and PHOENISSAE, after the deaths of their respective heroes. But the censurers did not consider the importance of burial among
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
the ancients: and that the action of the Iliad would have been imperfect without a de∣scription of the funeral rites for Hector and Patroclus; as the two tragedies, without those of Polynices and Eteocles: for the an∣cients esteemed a deprivation of sepulture to be a more severe calamity than death itself. It is observable that this circumstance did not occur to POPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad 23. Note I.</NOTE>, when he endeavoured to justify this conduct of Homer, by only say∣ing, that as the anger of Achilles does not die with Hector, but persecutes his very re∣mains, the poet still keeps up to his subject by describing the many effects of that anger, 'till it is fully satisfied: and that for this reason, the two last books of the Iliad may be thought not to be excrescencies, but essential to the poem. I will only add, that I do not know an author whose capital excellence suffers more from the reader's not regarding his climate and country, than the incomparable Cer∣vantes.

Let him have a care of that, said Don Quixote interrupting him, that is the best part of the plot. But Sir, quoth the Batchelor, if you would have me adhere to Aristotle's rules, I must omit the combat. Aristotle, replied the Knight, I grant was a man of some parts; but his capacity was not unbounded: and give me leave to tell you, his authority does not extend over combats in the list, which are far above his narrow rules. Would you suffer the chaste Queen of Bohe∣mia to perish? For how can you clear her in∣nocence? Believe me, COMBAT is the most honourable method you can pursue; and, besides, it will add such grace to your play, that all the rules in the universe must not stand in competition with it. Well, Sir Knight, replied the Batchelor, for your sake, and for

<P>THE arts used by Addison to suppress the rising merit of POPE, which are now fully laid open, give one pain to behold, to what mean artifices envy and malignity will com∣pel a gentleman and a genius to descend. It is certain, that Addison discouraged POPE from inserting the machinery in the Rape of the Lock: that he privately insinuated that POPE was a Tory and a Jacobite; and had a hand in writing the Examiners: that Addison himself translated the first book of Homer, published under Tickel's name: and that he secretly encouraged Gildon to abuse POPE in a virulent pamphlet, for which Addison paid Gildon ten guineas. This usage extorted from POPE the famous character of Atticus,
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>
which is perhaps the finest piece of satire extant. It is said, that when Racine read his tragedy of Alexander to Corneille, the latter gave him many general commendations, but advised him to apply his genius, as not being adapted to the drama, to some other species of poetry. Corneille, one would hope, was incapable of a mean jealousy, and if he gave this advice, thought it really proper to be given.</P></ITEM>

<P>THE dissolute reign of Charles II. justly deserved the satirical proscription in this pas∣sage. Under the notion of laughing at the absurd austerities of the Puritans, it became the mode to run into the contrary extreme, and to ridicule real religion and unaffected virtue. The King, during his exile, had seen and admired the splendor of the court of Louis XIV. and endeavoured to introduce the same luxury into the English court. The
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>
common opinion, that this was the Augustan age in England, is excessively false. A just taste was by no means yet formed. What was called SHEER WIT, was alone studied and applauded. Rochester, it is said, had no idea that there could be a better poet than Cowley. The King was perpetually quoting HUDIBRAS. The neglect of such a poem as the Paradise Lost, will for ever remain a monu∣ment of the bad taste that prevailed. It may be added, that the progress of philological learning, and of what is called the belle lettres, was perhaps obstructed by the insti∣tution of the Royal Society; which turned the thoughts of men of genius to physical enquiries. Our style in prose was but begin∣ning to be polished: although the diction of Hobbes is sufficiently pure; which philoso∣pher, and not the FLORID Spratt, was the classic of that age.

advanced it to great perfection: Racine has not supported it in the
perfection in which he found it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The characters of Corneille are true, though they are not common:
The characters of Racine are not true, but only so far forth as they are
common.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Sometimes the characters of Corneille, are, in some re∣spects,
false and unnatural, in that they are noble and singular: Those of Racine
are often, in some respects, low, on account of their being natural and
ordinary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. He that has a noble heart would chuse to resemble the heroes of
Corneille: He that has a little heart is pleased to find his own
resemblance in the heroes of Racine.</ITEM>

virtuous: And we carry the pleasure of finding men like ourselves in
foibles and weaknesses, from the pieces of the Other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The Tender and the Graceful of Racine is sometimes to be found in
Corneille: The Grand and Sublime of Corneille is never to be found in
Racine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Racine has painted only the French and the present age, even when
he designed to paint another age, and other nations: We see in Corneille,
all those ages and all those na∣tions, that he intended to paint.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. The number of the pieces of Corneille is much greater than that of
Racine: Corneille, notwithstanding, has made fewer tautologies and
repetitions than Racine has made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. In the passages where the versification of Corneille is good, it
is more bold, more noble, and, at the same time, as pure and as finished as
that of Racine; but it is not preserved in this degree of beauty: and that of
Racine is always equally supported.</ITEM>

in his own way: No author, not even Racine him∣self, dared to attempt, after
Corneille, that kind of writing which was peculiar to him.</ITEM>

<P>This comparison, of the justness of which the reader is left to judge, is said greatly to have irritated Boileau, the invariable friend and defender of Racine.

Whoever surveys the variety and per∣fection of his productions, all delivered in the chastest style, in the clearest order, and the most pregnant brevity, is amazed at the im∣mensity of his genius. His logic, however at present neglected for those redundant and verbose systems, which took their rise from Locke's Essay on the Human Understanding, is a mighty effort of the mind: in which are discovered the principal sources of the art of reasoning, and the dependencies of one thought on another; and where, by the different combinations he hath made of all the forms
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
the understanding can assume in reasoning, which he hath traced for it, he hath so closely confined it, that it cannot depart from them, without arguing inconsequentially. His Physics contain many useful observations, particularly his History of Animals; to assist him in which, Alexander gave orders, that creatures of different climates and countries should, at a great expence, be brought to him, to pass under his inspection. His Mo∣rals are perhaps the purest system in antiquity. His Politics are a most valuable monument of the civil wisdom of the ancients; as they preserve to us the description of several go∣vernments, and particularly of Crete and Car∣thage, that otherwise would have been un∣known. But of all his compositions, his Rhetoric and Poetics are most complete. No writer has shewn a greater penetration into recesses of the human heart, than this philoso∣pher, in the second book of his Rhetoric; where he treats of the different manners and passions, that distinguish each different age and condition of man; and from whence Horace
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>

No succeeding writer on eloquence, not even Tully, has added any thing new or important on this subject. His Poetics, which I suppose are here by POPE chiefly referred to, seem to have been written for the use of that prince, with whose education Aristotle was honoured, to give him a just taste in reading Homer and the tragedians: to judge properly of which, was then thought no unnecessary accomplish∣ment in the character of a prince. To at∣tempt to understand poetry without having diligently digested this treatise, would be as absurd and impossible, as to pretend to a skill in geometry, without having studied Euclid. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth chap∣ters, wherein he has pointed out the properest methods of exciting TERROR and PITY, con∣vince us, that he was intimately acquainted with those objects, which most forcibly affect the
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
heart. The prime excellence of this precious treatise is the scholastic precision, and philo∣sophical closeness, with which the subject is handled, without any address to the passions, or imagination. It is to be lamented, that the part of the Poetics in which he had given precepts for comedy, did not likewise descend to posterity.</P></ITEM>

'Tis easy to perceive this moral turn in all his compo∣sitions: the writer of the epistles is discerned in the odes. Elegance, not sublimity, was his grand characteristic. Horace is the most popular author of all antiquity; the reason is, because he abounds in images drawn from familiar life, and in remarks, that <Q REND="inline">"come home to mens business and bosoms."</Q> Hence he is more frequently quoted and alluded to, than any poet of a higher cast.</P></ITEM>

THESE prosaic lines, this spiritless elogy, are much below the merit of the critic whom they are intended to celebrate. POPE seems here rather to have considered Dionysius, as the author only of his little Treatise concern∣ing Homer; and to have in some measure overlooked, or at least not to have sufficiently insisted on, his most excellent book, ΠΕΡΙ ΣΥΝΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΟΝΟΜΑΤΩΝ, in which he has unfolded all the secret arts that render composition harmonious. One part of this discourse, I mean from the beginning of the twenty-first to the end of the twenty∣fourth Section, is perhaps one of the most useful pieces of criticism extant. He there discusses the three different species of compo∣sition; which he divides into the NERVOUS and AUSTERE, the SMOOTH and FLORID, and the MIDDLE, which partakes of the nature of the two others. As examples of the first species, he mentions Antimachus and Empe∣docles in heroics, Pindar in lyric, Aeschylus in tragic poetry, and Thucydides in history. As examples of the second, he produces Hesiod
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
as a writer in heroics; Sappho, Anacreon, and Simonides, in lyric; Euripides ONLY, among tragic writers; among the historians, Ephorus, and Theopompus; and Isocrates among the rhetoricians: all these, says he, have used words that are ΛΕΙΑ, χαι ΜΑΛΑΚΑ, χαι ΠΑΡΘΕΝΩΠΑ. The writers which he al∣leges as instances of the third species, who have happily blended the two other species of composition, and who are the most complete models of style, are Homer, in epic poetry; Stesichorus and Alcaeus in lyric; in tragic, Sophocles; in history, Herodotus; in elo∣quence, Demosthenes; in philosophy, Demo∣critus, Plato, and Aristotle.</P></ITEM>

TO commend Quintilian barely for his me∣thod, and to insist merely on this excellence, is below the merit of one of the most rational and elegant of Roman writers. Considering the nature of Quintilian's subject, he afforded copious matter, for a more appropriated and poetical character. No author ever adorned a scientifical treatise with so many beautiful metaphors. Quintilian was found in the bot∣tom of a tower of the monastery of St. Gal, by Poggius; as appears by one of his letters dated 1417, written from Constance, when the council was then sitting. The mo∣nastery was about twenty miles from that city. Silius Italicus was found at the same time and place.</P></ITEM>

<P>THIS abrupt address to Longinus is more spirited and striking, and more suitable to the character of the person addressed, than if he had coldly spoken of him in the third person.
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
The taste and sensibility of Longinus were exquisite, but his observations are too general, and his method too loose. The precision of the true philosophical critic is lost in the decla∣mation of the florid rhetorician. Instead of shewing for what reason a sentiment or image is SUBLIME, and discovering the secret power by which they affect a reader with pleasure, he is ever intent on producing something SUBLIME <HI>himself,</HI> and strokes of his <HI>own</HI> elo∣quence. Instead of pointing out the founda∣tion of the grandeur of Homer's imagery, where he describes the motion of Neptune, the critic is endeavouring to rival the poet, by saying that, <Q REND="inline">"there was not room enough in the whole earth, to take such another step."</Q> He should have shewn why the speech of Phaeton to his son, in a fragment of Euripides, was so lively and picturesque: in∣stead of which, he ardently exclaims, <Q REND="inline">"would not you say, that the soul of the writer as∣cended the chariot with the driver, and waS whirled along in the same flight and danger with the rapid horses?"</Q> We have lately

Modern history, however, has afford∣ed an example to the contrary.

so fond, as to declare in the Letters, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 7. Pag. 232.</NOTE> that he had some design of writing his life in latin. I call Erasmus a wonderful man, not only on account of the variety, and classical purity of his works, but of that penetration, that strong and acute sense, which enabled him to pierce through the absurdities of the times, and expose them with such poignant ridicule, and attic elegance. A work of hu∣mour, and of humour directed to expose the priests, in that age, was indeed a prodigy. The irony of the Encomium on Folly has never been excelled. Erasmus, though a commentator, had taste; and though a catho∣lic, had charity. His learning was enlivened with wit; and his orthodoxy was tempered with moderation. He was never dazzled with what was called ERUDITION; or misled by that blind and undistinguishing veneration which was naturally paid to the antients, on the first discovery of their writings. By his CICERONIANUS, he repressed the affectation of imitating Tully's manner of expression, in
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
every species of composition. In his ECCLE∣SIASTES, very excellent rules are laid down for preaching. In his DIALOGUES, the super∣stitions of the Romish church are exposed with all the pleasantry of Lucian: an author, to whom his genius bore great resemblance; and some of whose dialogues he has translated with their original spirit. Indeed, among the many translators of Greek authors who flou∣rished at that time, Erasmus seems to have been in all respects the most eminent. To him was the restoration of literature princi∣pally owing. More than one prince sollicited his friendship, and invited him to their courts. We see in a letter of Erasmus, written in the year 1516, that Francis I. who shared with Leo X. the glory of reviving sciences and arts in Europe, having declared to Petit his con∣fessor, that he intended to bring into France the most learned men he could find, Petit had charged Budaeus, and Cop the royal physician, to write to Erasmus, to engage him to settle in France: that Stephen Poncher, embassador from the king at Brussels, pres∣sed

<P>HISTORY has recorded five ages of the world, in which the human mind has ex∣erted itself in an extraordinary manner; and in which it's productions in literature and the fine arts have arrived at a perfection, not equalled in other periods. The FIRST, is the age of Philip and Alexander; about which time flourished Socrates, Plato, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Lysippus, Apelles, Phidias, Prax∣iteles, Thucydides, Xenophon, Aeschylus, Eu∣ripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Menander,
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
Philemon. The SECOND age, which has ne∣ver yet been sufficiently taken notice of, was that of Ptolomy Philadelphus, king of Aegypt; in which appeared Lycophron, Aratus, Ni∣cander, Apollonius Rhodius, Theocritus, Cal∣limachus, Eratosthenes, Philichus, Erisistratus the physician, Timaeus the historian, Clean∣thes, Diogenes the painter, and Sostrates the architect. This prince, from his love of learning, commanded the Old Testament to be translated into Greek. The THIRD age is that of Julius Caesar, and Augustus; marked with the illustrious names of Laberius, Ca∣tullus, Lucretius, Cicero, Livy, Varro, Vir∣gil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Phae∣drus, Vitruvius, Dioscorides. The FOURTH age was that of Julius II. and Leo X. which produced, Ariosto, Tasso, Fracastorius, San∣nazarius, Vida, Bembo, Sadolet, Machiavel, Guiccardin, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian. The FIFTH age, is that of Louis XIV. in France, and of king William and queen Anne in England: in which, or thereabouts, are to be found, Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Boi∣leau,

<P>CONCERNING the particular encouragement given by Leo X. to polite literature, and the fine arts, I forbear to enlarge; because a friend of mine is at present engaged in writing, THE HISTORY OF THE AGE OF LEO X. It is a noble period, and full of those most important events, which have had the greatest influence on human affairs. Such as the discovery of the West-Indies, by the Spaniards, and of a passage to the East, by the Portugueze; the invention of printing; the reformation of reli∣ligion; with many others: all which will be

insisted upon at large, and their consequences displayed. I shall only here transiently ob∣serve, that some efforts to emerge from bar∣barity had long before this time appeared in Italy. Dante wrote his sublime <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly the beginning of the third Canto of the INFERNO, as also the beginning of the sixth.</NOTE> and origi∣nal poem, which is a kind of satirical epic, and which abounds in images and senti∣ments equal to the best of Homer, but whose works he had never seen, about the year 1310. Giotto the disciple of Cimabue, the friend of Dante, and subject of his praises, was employed, about the same time, by Benedict XI.; and a picture of mosaic work done by him, over the gate of St. Peter's church at Rome, is still remaining. A Tuscan, called Guy of Arezzo, invented the musical notes in use at present: and Bruneleschi built palaces at Florence, in the style of ancient architecture. Soon afterwards, Boccace and Petrarch polished, and fixed the standard of the Italian language. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Veggiamo in un medesimo progresso di tempo (dal regno principalmente dell'una, e dell'altra Sicilia, e poi dalla Lom∣bardia, e de vari, e distinti luoghi d'Italia) sorgere scrittori, i quali anno favella con Dante, Petrarcha, Boccacio, ed altri Toscani autori commune, e con loro anche commune l'autorità, da ogni regolator della lingua riconosciuta, i quali, tra molti altri, furrono Guidotto Bolognese, Marco Polo Veneziano, Pier Crescenzia da Bologna, Guido Giudice Messinese, Giacopo Colonna Romano, Federico II. imperadore, Pier delle Vigne Capoano, Benvenuto da Imola, Fra Jacopone da Todi, Onesto Bolognese, Guido Guislieri, Semprebene, Fabrovio, Guido Guislieri, Jacopo della Lana, Giotto Mantovano." <BIBL>Gravina della Rag.

that this was not so much owing to Petrarch, as to Albertino Mussato, a

greatest offices in his country, in the year 1329, that is to say,
thirty-five years before Petrarch. He wrote not only many books of a history
of his own times, but also an heroic poem on the siege of Padua by the
<PB N="192" REF="203"/> Veronese, under the great Can; together with eclogues,
elegies, epistles in verse, and an Ovidian Cento. However, to form a full
judgment in this case, one need only peruse his two latin tragedies
entitled ECCERINIS, and ACHILLES, which he composed in the style and manner
of Seneca: and which were the first regular and perfect dramas, that are to

The various stratagems, and manifold intri∣cacies of this ingenious game, so difficult to be described in latin, are here expressed with the greatest perspicuity and elegance; so that perhaps the game might be learnt from this description.

The piece is, indeed, of the satyric, rather than of the preceptive, kind. The coldness and neglect with which this writer, formed only on the French critics, speaks of Milton, must be considered as proofs of his want of critical discernment, or of critical courage. I can recollect no performance of Buck∣ingham, that stamps him a true genius. His reputation was owing to his rank.

<P>AN ESSAY on Translated Verse seems at first sight to be a barren subject; yet Ros∣common has decorated it with may precepts of utility and taste, and enlivened it with a tale in imitation of Boileau. It is indisputably better written than the last-mentioned ESSAY. Roscommon was more learned than Buck∣ingham. He was bred under Bochart at Caen in Normandy. He had laid a design of forming a society for the refining, and fixing the standard of, our language: in which project, his intimate friend Dryden was a principal assistant. This was the first attempt of that sort; and, I fear, we shall never see

another set on foot in our days: even though Mr. Johnson has lately given us so excellent a dictionary. It may be remarked to the praise of Roscommon, that he was the first critic who had taste and spirit enough, pub∣licly to praise the Paradise Lost; with a noble encomium of which, and a rational recommendation of blank verse, he concludes his performance. Fenton, in his Observations on Waller, has accurately delineated his cha∣racter. <Q REND="inline">"His imagination might have pro∣bably been more fruitful, and sprightly, if his judgment had been less severe: but that severity, delivered in a masculine, clear, suc∣cinct style, contributed to make him so emi∣nent in the didactical manner, that no man with justice can affirm, he was ever equalled by any of our own nation, without confessing, at the same time, that he is inferior to none. In some other kinds of writing his genius seems to have wanted fire to attain the point of perfection: but who can attain it?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edit. 12mo. pag. 136.</NOTE></Q></P></ITEM>

<L>Such late was WALSH, the muse's judge and friend. 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 730.</NOTE></L></Q> 
<P>IF POPE has here given too magnificent an elogy to Walsh, it must pardonably be attri∣buted to friendship, rather than to judgment. Walsh was in general a flimzy and frigid writer. The Rambler calls his works PAGES OF INANITY. His three letters to POPE, however, are well written. His remarks on the nature of pastoral poetry, on borrowing from the ancients, and against florid conceits, are worthy perusal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. 7. pag. 65, &amp;c.</NOTE>. POPE owed much to Walsh: it was he who gave him a very im∣portant piece of advice, in his early youth; for he used to tell our author, that there was one way still left open for him, by which he might excell any of his predecessors, which was, by CORRECTNESS; that though indeed we had several great poets, we as yet could boast of none that were perfectly CORRECT; and that therefore, he advised him to make this quality his particular study.</P> 
<P><PB N="202" REF="213"/>
CORRECTNESS is a vague term, frequently used without meaning and precision. It is per∣petually the nauseous cant of the French cri∣tics, and of their advocates and pupils, that the English writers are generally INCORRECT. If CORRECTNESS implies an absence of petty faults, this perhaps may be granted. If it means, that because their tragedians have avoided the irregularities of Shakespeare, and have observed a juster oeconomy in their fables, that therefore the Athalia, for instance, is preferable to Lear, the notion is groundless and absurd. The Henriade is free from any very gross faults; but who will dare to rank it with the Paradise Lost? The declamations with which some of their most perfect trage∣dies abound, may be reckoned as contrary to the nature of that species of poetry, and as destructive of it's end, as the fools or grave∣diggers of Shakespeare. That the French may boast some excellent critics, particularly, Bossu, Boileau, Fenelon, and Brumoy, cannot be denied; but that they are sufficient to form a taste upon, without having recourse to the
<PB N="203" REF="214"/>
genuine fountains of all polite literature, I mean the Grecian writers, no one but a super∣ficial sciolist can allow.</P></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I CONCLUDE these reflections with a remark∣able fact. In no polished nation, after criticism has been much studied, and the rules of wri∣ting established, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has visibly been the case, in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Aristotle, Horace, and Boileau, had writ∣ten their ARTS OF POETRY. In our own country, the rules of the drama, for instance, were never more completely understood than at present: yet what UNINTERESTING, though FAULTLESS, tragedies, have we lately seen? So much better is our judgment than our exe∣cution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, adequately and justly, would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them. Whether or no, the natural powers be not confined and debi∣litated
<PB N="204" REF="215"/>
by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a regard to the dictates of art: or whether, that philosophical, that geome∣trical, and systematical spirit so much in vogue, which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature, by consulting only REASON, has not diminished and destroyed SENTIMENT; and made our poets write from and to the HEAD rather than the HEART: or whether, lastly, when just models, from which the rules have necessarily been drawn, have once appeared, succeeding writers, by ambitiously endeavouring to surpass those just models, and to be original and new, do not become distorted and unnatural, in their thoughts and diction.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the RAPE of the LOCK.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Moderns have excelled the Ancients in any species of writing, it seems to be in satire: and, particularly in that kind of satire, which is conveyed in the form of the epopee, a pleasing vehicle of satire never used by the ancients. As the poet disappears in this way of writing, and does not deliver the intended censure in his own proper person, the satire becomes more delicate, because more oblique. Add to this, that a tale or story more strongly engages and interests the reader, than a series of precepts or reproofs, or even of characters themselves, however lively and natural. An heroi-comic poem may there∣fore be justly esteemed the most excellent kind of satire.</P>
<P>THE invention of it is usually ascribed to Alessandro Tassoni; who in the year 1622, published at Paris, a poem composed by him,
<PB N="206" REF="217"/>
in a few months of the year 1611, entitled LA SECCHIA RAPITA, or <HI>The Rape of the Bucket.</HI> To avoid giving offence, it was first printed under the name of Androvini Melisoni. It was afterwards reprinted at Venice, cor∣rected, with the name of the author, and with some illustrations of Gasparo Salviani. But the learned and curious Crescembini, in his <HI>Istoria della Volgar Poesia,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. pag. 78. In Roma, per il Chracas, 1698.</NOTE> informs us, that it is doubtful whether the invention of the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">E tal Poesia puo diffinirsi, e chiamarsi, immitazione d'azione seria fatto con riso. Crescembini, ibid.</NOTE> heroi-comic poem ought to be ascribed to Tassoni, or to Francesco Bracciolini, who wrote LO SCHERNO DE GLI DEI, which perfor∣mance, though it was printed four years after LA SECCHIA, is nevertheless declared in an epistle prefixed, to have been written many years sooner. The real subject of Tassoni's poem, was the war which the inhabitants of Modena declared against those of Bologna, on the refu∣sal of the latter to restore to them some towns, which had been detained ever since the time
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>
of the emperor Frederic II. The author artfully made use of a popular tradition, according to which it was believed, that a certain woodden bucket, which is kept at Modena in the treasury of the cathedral, came from Bologna, and that it had been forcibly taken away by the Mode∣nese. Crescembini adds, that because Tassoni had severely ridiculed the Bolognese, Barto∣lomeo Bocchini, to revenge his countrymen, printed at Venice MDCXLI, a tragico-heroi∣comic poem, entitled LE PAZZIE DE SAVI, <HI>overo,</HI> IL LAMBERTACCIO, in which the Modenese are spoken of with much contempt. The Italians have a fine turn for works of hu∣mour, in which they abound. They have another poem of this species, called MAL∣MANTILE RACQUISTATO, written by Lo∣renzo Lippi, in the year MDCLXXVI, which Crescembini<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 368. lib. 5.</NOTE> highly commends, calling it, <Q REND="inline">"Spiritosisimo e legiadrissimo poema gia∣coso."</Q> It was afterwards reprinted at Flo∣rence MDCLXXXVIII, with the useful anno∣tations
<PB N="208" REF="219"/>
of Puccio Lamoni, a Florentine painter, who was himself no contemptible poet.</P>
<P>THE LUTRIN of Boileau was the second remarkable poem, in which the Serious and Comic were happily blended. Boileau him∣self has given a circumstantial account of what gave occasion to this poem; which account, because it is entertaining, and not printed in the common editions of his works, I will insert at length. <Q REND="inline">"I shall not here act like Ariosto, who frequently when he is going to relate the most absurd story in the world, solemnly protests it to be true, and supports it by the authority of archbishop Turpin. For my part I freely declare, the whole poem of the DESK is nothing but pure fiction; that it is all invented, even to the name itself of the place where the action passes. An odd occasion gave rise to this poem. In a company I was lately engaged in, the conver∣sation turned upon epic poetry: every one delivered his opinion, according to his abili∣ties; when mine was asked, I confirmed
<PB N="209" REF="220"/>
what I had advanced in my Art of Poetry, that an heroic poem, to be truly excellent, ought to be charged with little MATTER, which it was the business of invention to support and extend. The opinion was warmly contested: but after many reasons for and against, it happened, as it generally does in this sort of disputes, that nobody was con∣vinced, and that each continued in his own opinion. The heat of dispute being over, we talked on other subjects; and laughed at the violence into which we had been betrayed, in discussing a question of so little consequence. We moralized on the folly of men who pass almost their whole lives, in treating the greatest trifles in a serious manner, and in making to themselves an important affair of something quite indifferent. To this purpose, a country gentleman related a famous quarrel, that had lately happened in a little church in his province, between the treasurer and the chantor, the two principal dignitaries of that church, about the place in which a reading∣desk was to stand. We thought it a droll
<PB N="210" REF="221"/>
affair. Upon this, one of the critics in com∣pany, who could not so soon forget our late dispute, asked me, if I, who thought so little MATTER necessary for an heroic poem, would undertake to write one on a quarrel so little abounding in incidents, as this of the two ecclesiastics. <Q REND="inline">"J'eus plutôt dit, pourquoi non? que je n'eus fait reflexion sur ce qu'il me demandoit."</Q> This made the company laugh, and I could not help laughing with them; not in the least imagining, that I should ever be able to keep my word. But finding myself at leisure in the evening, I re∣volved the subject in my mind, and having considered in every view the pleasantry that it would admit of, I made twenty verses which I shewed to my friends. They were diverted with this beginning. The pleasure which I saw these gave them, induced me to write twenty more. Thus, from twenty verses to twenty, I lengthened the work to near nine hundred. This is the whole history of the trifle I now offer to the public.—This is a new kind of burlesque, which I have intro∣duced
<PB N="211" REF="222"/>
into our language: for, as in the other kind of burlesque, that of Scarron, Dido and Aeneas spoke like fish-women and porters, in this of mine, a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Altered afterwards to a Barber.</NOTE> clock-maker and his wife talk like Dido and Aeneas. I do not know whether my poem will have all the qualities requisite to satisfy a reader: but I dare flatter myself, that it will at least be allowed to have the grace of novelty; because I do not con∣ceive, that there are any works of this nature in our language; the DEFAITES DES BOUTS RIMES of Sarasin being rather a mere allegory than a poem, as this is."</Q></P>
<P>ON a subject seemingly so unpromising and incapable of ornament, has Boileau found a method of raising a poem full of beautiful imagery; which appears like that magnificent city, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Petersburg.</NOTE> which the greatest of princes caused to be built in a morass. Boileau has en∣livened this piece with many unexpected inci∣dents and entertaining episodes;

Particularly that of the Perruquier, in the se∣cond canto, and of the Battle of the Books, in the fifth. The satire throughout is poig∣nant, though polite, to the last degree.

<P>HIS knowledge of the rents of his church, and of the mortgages belonging to it, his scorn of the pious and laborious Arnauld, his contempt of learning, and, above all, his ruling passion of good-eating, are strokes high∣ly comic. It is wonderful the ecclesiastics of France were not as much irritated by the publi∣cation of the LUTRIN, as by the TARTUFFE of Moliere; which was suppressed by their in∣terest, after it had been acted a few nights: although at the same time, a very profane farce was permitted to have a long run. When Louis XIV. expressed to the Prince of Condè, his wonder at the different fates of these two pieces, and asked the reason of it, the prince answered,

<Q REND="inline"><PB N="215" REF="226"/>"In the farce, RELIGION <HI>only</HI> is ridiculed; but, Moliere in the TARTUFFE, has attack∣ed even the PRIESTS."</Q></P>
<P>BOILEAU has raised his subjects by many personifications; particularly, in the begin∣ning of the sixth canto, PIETY who had re∣tired to the great Carthusian monastery on the Alps, is introduced as repairing to Paris, accompanied by FAITH, HOPE, and CHA∣RITY, in order to make her complaint to THEMIS: to which may be added, the mon∣strous figure of CHICANERY, attended by FAMINE, WANT, SORROW, and RUIN, in the beginning of the fifth canto. The chief divinity that acts throughout the poem, is DISCORD; which goddess is represented as coming from a convent of Cordeliers. A fine stroke of satire; but imitated from the satyrical Ariosto, who makes Michael find DISCORD in a cloister, instead of SILENCE, whom he there searched for in vain. NIGHT is also introduced as an actress with great propriety, in the third canto; where she repairs to the
<PB N="216" REF="227"/>
famous old tower at Montlery, in order to find out an owl which she may convey into the DESK, and which afterwards produces so ridiculous a consternation. SLOTH is another principal personage: she also is discovered in the dormitory of a monastery.<Q><L>Les Plaisirs nonchalans solêtrent a l'entour.</L>

<P>THE third heroi-comic poem was the DISPENSARY of Garth: a palpable imitation of the LUTRIN, and the best satire on the phisicians extant, except the SANGRADO of Le Sage, who have indeed been the object of almost every satirist. The behaviour and sentiment of SLOTH, the first imaginary being that occurs, are almost literally translated from Boileau: particularly the compliment

that SLOTH pays to king William, whose actions disturb her repose:<Q><L>Or if some cloyster's refuge I implore,</L>

<P>THIS author has been guilty of a strange im∣propriety, which cannot be excused, in making the fury DISEASE talk like a critic, give rules of writing, and a panegyric on the best poets of the age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. 4.</NOTE>. The descent into the earth in the sixth canto, is a fine mixture of poetry and philosophy; the hint is taken from the SYPHILIS of Fracastorius.

<P>THE RAPE OF THE LOCK, now before us, is the fourth, and most excellent of the heroi∣comic poems. The subject was a quarrel
<PB N="219" REF="230"/>
occasioned by a little piece of gallantry of Lord Petre, who, in a party of pleasure, found means to cut off a favorite lock of Mrs. Arabella Fermour's hair. POPE was desired to write it, in order to put an end to the quarrel it produced, by Mr. Caryl, who had been secretary to queen Mary, author of Sir Solomon Single a comedy, and of some translations in Dryden's Miscellanies. POPE was accustomed to say, <Q REND="inline">"What I wrote fastest always pleased most."</Q> The first sketch of this exquisite piece, which Addison called MERUM SAL, was written in less than a fortnight, in two cantos only: but it was so universally applauded, that, in the next year, our poet enriched it with the machinery of the sylphs, and extended it to five cantos; when it was printed with a letter to Mrs. Fer∣mour, far superior to any of Voiture. The insertion of the machinery of the sylphs in proper places, without the least appearance of it's being aukwardly stitched in, is one of the happiest efforts of judgment and art. He took the idea of these invisible beings, so pro∣per
<PB N="220" REF="231"/>
to be employed in a poem of this nature, from a little french book entitled, Le Comte de Gabalis, of which I have lately met with an account, in an entertaining writer. <Q REND="inline">"The Abbe Villars, who came from Thoulouse to Paris, to make his fortune by preaching, is the author of this diverting work. The five dialogues of which it consists, are the result of those gay conversations, in which the Abbe was engaged á la porte de Richelieu, with a set of men, of fine wit and humour, like himself. When this book first appeared, it was universally read, as innocent and amusing. But at length, it's consequences were perceived, and reckoned dangerous, at a time when this sort of curiosities began to gain credit. Our devout preacher was denied the chair, and his book forbidden to be read. It was not clear whether the author intended to be ironical, or spoke all seriously. The second volume which he promised, would have decided the que∣stion: but the unfortunate Abbe was soon after∣wards assassinated by ruffians, on the road to Lyons. The laughers gave out, that the
<PB N="221" REF="232"/>
gnomes and sylphs, disguised like ruffians, had shot him, as a punishment for revealing the secrets of the Cabala; a crime not to be pardoned by these jealous spirits, as Villars himself has declared in his book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melanges d'Histoire et de Literature. By Dom. Noel Dargonne, disguised under the name of Vigneul Marville. Tom. prem. pag. 275. edit. Roterdam, 1700.</NOTE>."</Q> It may not be improper to give a specimen of this authors manner, who has lately been well imitated in the way of mixing jest with earnest, in an elegant piece called HERMIPPUS REDI∣VIVUS. The Comte de Gabalis being about to initiate his pupils into the most profound mysteries of the Rosicrusian philosophy, ad∣vises him to consider seriously, whether or no he had courage and resolution sufficient to RENOUNCE all those obstacles, which might prevent his arising to that height, which the figure of his nativity promised. <Q REND="inline">"Le mot de RENONCER, says the scholar, m'effraya, et je ne doutay point qu'il n'allast me proposer de renoncer au baptesme ou au paradis.

<P>THESE machines are vastly superior to the allegorical personages of Boileau and Garth; not only on account of their novelty, but for the exquisite poetry, and oblique satire, which

The account which Ariel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 1. ver. 27. to ver. 119.</NOTE> gives of the nature, office, and employment of these inhabitants of air, is finely fancied: into which several strokes of satire are thrown with great delicacy and address.<Q><L>Think what an equipage thou hast in air,</L>

The succeeding scene of sailing upon the Thames is most gay and <HI>riant;</HI> and impresses the most pleasing pictures upon the imagination. Here too the machinery is again introduced with much propriety. Ariel summons his denizens

<P>THE seeming importance given to every part of female dress, each of which is com∣mitted to the care and protection of a different sylph, with all the solemnity of a general appointing the several posts in his army, ren∣ders the following passage admirable, on account of it's politeness, poignancy, and poetry.<Q><L>Haste then ye spirits, to your charge repair;</L>

<P>OUR poet still rises in the delicacy of his satire, where he employs, with the utmost judgment and elegance, all the implements and furniture of the toilette, as instruments of punishment to those spirits, who shall be careless of their charge: of punishment such as sylphs alone could undergo. Each of the delinquents,<Q><L>Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,</L>

 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 2. Ver. 122.</NOTE></L></Q> If Virgil has merited such perpetual commen∣mendation for exalting his bees, by the ma∣jesty and magnificence of his diction, does not POPE deserve equal praises, for the pomp and lustre of his language, on so trivial a subject?</P>
<P>THE same mastery of language, appears in the lively and elegant description of the game at Ombre; which is certainly imitated from the Scacchia of Vida, and as certainly equal to it, if not superiour. Both of them have elevated and enlivened their subjects, by such similes as the epic poets use; but as chess is a play of a far higher order than Ombre,
<PB N="233" REF="244"/>
POPE had a more difficult task than Vida, to raise this his inferior subject, into equal dignity and gracefulness. Here again our poet artfully introduces his machinery:<Q><L>Soon as she spreads her hand, th'aërial guard</L>
<L>Descend, and sit on each important card;</L>
<L>First Ariel perch'd upon a mattadore.
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 3. Ver. 31.</NOTE></L></Q> The majesty with which the kings of spades and clubs, and the knaves of diamonds and clubs, are spoken of, is very amusing to the imagination: and the whole game is con∣ducted with great art and judgment. I question whether Hoyle could have played it better than Belinda. It is finely contrived that she should be victorious; as it occasions a change of fortune in the dreadful loss she was speedily to undergo, and gives occasion to the poet to introduce a moral reflection from Virgil, which adds to the pleasantry of the story. In one of the passages where POPE has copied Vida, he has lost the propriety of the original,
<PB N="234" REF="245"/>
which arises from the different colours of the <HI>men,</HI> at chess.<Q><L>Thus, when dispers'd a routed army runs, &amp;c.

<P>To this scene succeeds the tea-table. It is doubtless, as hard to make a coffee-pot shine in poetry as a plough: yet POPE has suc∣ceeded in giving elegance to so familiar an object, as well as Virgil. The guardian spirits are again active, and importantly em∣ployed;<Q><L>Strait hover round the fair her airy band; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cant. 3. Ver. 113.</NOTE></L>
<L>Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd.</L></Q>

The methods by which they endeavoured to preserve her from the intended mischief, are such only as could be executed by a sylph; and have therefore an admirable propriety, as well as the utmost elegance.<Q><L>A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair;

<L>And thrice they TWITCH'D the diamond in her ear,</L>

 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 3.

The wife of the barber, talks in the language of Dido in her expostulations to her Aeneas, at the beginning of the second canto of the Lutrin. POPE's parodies of the speech of Sarpedon in Homer, canto v. verse 9, and of the description of Achilles's scepter, canto iv. verse 133, and the description of the scales of Jupiter from Ho∣mer, Virgil, and Milton, canto v. verse 72, are judiciously introduced in their several places, are perhaps superiour to those Boi∣leau or Garth have used, and are worked up with peculiar pleasantry. The mind of the reader is engaged by novelty, when it so unexpectedly finds a thought or object it
<PB N="238" REF="249"/>
had been accustomed to survey in another form, suddenly arrayed in a ridiculous garb. A mixture of comic and ridiculous images, with serious and important ones, is also, no small beauty to this species of poetry. As in the following passages, where real and imaginary distresses are coupled together.<Q><L>Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive, <NOTE PLACE="foot">Cant. 4. Ver. 3.</NOTE></L>
<L>Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,</L>
<L>Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,</L>
<L>Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss,</L>
<L>Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,</L></Q> Nay, to carry the climax still higher,
<Q><L>Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,</L>
<L>E'er felt such rage, resentment and despair.</L></Q>
This is much superiour to a similar passage in the Dispensary, which POPE might have had in his eye;<Q><L>At this the victors own such ecstasies,
 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5. ad calc.</NOTE></L>
<L>As Memphian priests if their Osiris sneeze;</L>

<L><PB N="239" REF="250"/> Or Sultans rais'd from dungeons to a crown,</L>
<L>Or fasting zealots when the sermon's done.</L></Q> These objects have no reference to Garth's subject, as almost all of POPE's have, in the passage in question, where some female foible is glanced at.

breaking the vial with its direful effects, and the speech of the
disconsolate Belinda; all <PB N="240" REF="251"/> these circumstances
are poetically imagined, and are far superiour to any of Boileau and Garth.
How much in character is it for Belinda to mark a very dismal and solitary
situation, by wishing to be conveyed, 
<Q> 
<L>Where the gilt chariot never marks the way,</L>
<L>Where none learn Ombre, none e'er taste Bohea! 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 4. Ver. 156.</NOTE></L></Q> Nothing is more common in the poets than to introduce omens as preceeding
some im∣portant and dreadful event. Virgil has nobly described those that
preceded the death of Dido. The rape of Belinda's LOCK must necessarily
also be attended with alarming prodigies. With what exquisite satire are
they enumerated; 
<Q> 
<L>Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;</L>
<L>The tottering china shook without a wind. 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. 4. Ver. 161.</NOTE></L></Q> And still more to aggravate the direfulness of the impending evil, 
<Q> 
<L>Nay Poll sate mute, and Shock was most unkind!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="252"/>
THE chief subject of the fifth and last canto, is the battle that ensues, and the en∣deavours of the ladies to recover the hair. This battle is described, as it ought to be, in very lofty and pompous terms: a game of romps was never so well dignified before. The weapons made use of are the most pro∣per imaginable: the lightening of the ladies eyes, intolerable frowns, a pinch of snuff, and a bodkin. The machinery is not forgot:
<Q><L>Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height,</L>
<L>Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5. Ver. 53.</NOTE></L></Q>

<Q><L>The gnomes direct, to ev'ry atom just,</L>
<L>The pungent grains of titillating dust. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Ver. 85.</NOTE></L></Q>
Boileau and Garth have also each of them enlivened their pieces with a mock-fight. But Boileau has laid the scene of his action in a bookseller's shop; where the combatants happen to encounter each other by chance. This conduct is a little inartificial; but has
<PB N="242" REF="253"/>
given the satyrist an opportunity of indulging his ruling passion, the exposing the bad poets, with which France at that time abounded. Swift's Battle of the Books, at the end of the Tale of a Tub, is evidently taken from this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chant. 5.</NOTE> battle of Boileau, which is excellent in its kind. The fight of the physicians, in the Dispensary, is one of its most shining parts. There is a vast deal of propriety, as well as pleasantry, in the weapons Garth has given to his warriours. They are armed, much in character, with caustics, emetics, and cathar∣tics; with buckthorn, and steel-pills; with syringes, bed-pans and urinals. The execu∣tion is exactly proportioned to the deadliness of such irresistible weapons; and the wounds inflicted, are suitable to the nature of each different instrument, said to inflict them. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE are now arrived to the grand catas∣trophe of the poem; the invaluable Lock which is so eagerly sought, is irrecoverably lost! And here our poet has made a judicious
<PB N="243" REF="254"/>
use of that celebrated fiction of Ariosto; that all things lost on earth are treasured in the moon. How such a fiction can have place in an epic poem, it becomes the defenders of this extravagant and lawless rhapsodist to just∣tify; but in a comic one, it appears with grace and consistency. The whole passage in Ariosto is full of wit and satire; for wit and satire were the chief and characteristical excellencies of Ariosto<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the best and most judicious account I know of the ge∣nius of Ariosto, see Warton's OBSERVATIONS on the FAIRY QUEEN of Spenser.

 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orlando Furioso. Cant. 34.</NOTE></L></Q> It is very remarkable, that the poet had the boldness to place among these imaginary trea∣sures,
<PB N="244" REF="255"/>
the famous deed of gift of Constantine to Pope Silvester, <Q REND="inline">"If, says he, I may be al∣lowed to say this,"</Q>
<Q><L>Questo era il dono (se pero dir lece)</L>
<L>Che Constantino al buon Silvestre fece.</L></Q>
It may be observed in general, to the honour of the poets, both ancient and modern, that they have ever been some of the first, who have detected and opposed the false claims, and mischievous usurpations, of superstition and slavery. Nor can this be wondered at, since these two are the greatest enemies, not only to all true happiness, but to all true genius.</P>
<P>THE denouement, as a pedantic disciple of Bossu would call it, of this poem, is well con∣ducted. What is become of this important LOCK OF HAIR? It is made a constellation with that of Berenice, so celebrated by Cal∣limachus. As it rises to heaven,
<Q><L>The sylphs behold it kindling as it flies, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5. Ver. 130.</NOTE></L>
<L>And pleas'd pursue its progress through the skies.</L></Q>
<PB N="245" REF="256"/>
One cannot sufficiently applaud the art of the poet, in constantly keeping in the reader's view, the machinery of the poem, to the very last. Even when the Lock is transformed, the sylphs, who had so carefully guarded it, are here once again artfully mentioned, as finally rejoicing in it's honourable transfor∣mation.</P>
<P>IN reading the Lutrin, I have always been struck with the impropriety of so serious a conclusion, as Boileau has given to so ludi∣crous a poem. PIETY and JUSTICE are beings rather too awful, to have any concern in the celebrated desk. They appear as much out of place and season, as would the arch∣bishop of Paris in his pontifical robes, in an harlequin entertainment.</P>
<P>POPE does not desert his favorite Lock, even after it becomes a constellation; and the uses he assigns to it are indeed admirable.<Q><L>This the beau monde shall from the mall survey,
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5. Ver. 133.</NOTE></L>

<L>And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom,</L>
<L>The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.</L></Q> This is at once, DULCE LOQUI, and RIDERE DECORUM.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I hope it will not be thought an exaggerated panegyric to say, that the RAPE OF THE LOCK, is the BEST SA∣TIRE extant; that it contains the truest and liveliest picture of modern life; and that the subject is of a more elegant nature, as well as more artfully conducted, than that of any other heroi-comic poem. POPE here appears in the light of a man of gallantry, and of a thorough knowledge of the world; and in∣deed, he had nothing, in his carriage and deportment, of that affected singularity, which has induced some men of genius to despise, and depart from, the established rules of polite∣ness and civil life. For all poets have not prac∣ticed the sober and rational advice of Boileau.<Q><PB N="247" REF="258"/>

<P>OUR nation can boast also, of having produced one or two more poems of the bur∣lesque kind, that are excellent; particularly the SPLENDID SHILLING, that admirable copy of the solemn irony of Cervantes; who is the father and unrivalled model of the true mock-heroic: and the MUSCIPULA, written with the purity of Virgil, whom the author so perfectly under∣stood, and with the pleasantry of Lucian: to which I cannot forbear adding, the SCRIB∣LERIAD of Mr. Cambridge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This learned and ingenious writer hath made a new remark, in his preface, worth examination and attention. He says, that in first reading the <HI>four</HI> celebrated mock heroic poems, he per∣ceived they had all some radical defect.

<P>IF some of the most candid among the French critics begin to acknowledge, that
<PB N="248" REF="259"/>
they have produced nothing in point of SUBLIMITY and MAJESTY equal to the Para∣dise Lost, we may also venture to affirm, that in point of DELICACY, ELEGANCE, and fine-turned RAILLERY, on which they have so much valued themselves, they have produced nothing equal to the RAPE OF THE LOCK. It is in this composition, POPE prin∣cipally appears a POET; in which he has dis∣played more imagination than in all his other works taken together. It should however be remembered, that he was not the FIRST former and creator of those beautiful machines, the sylphs; on which his claim to imagination is chiefly founded. He found them existing ready to his hand; but has, indeed, employed them with singular judgment and artifice.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of The ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, The PROLOGUE
to Cato, and The EPI∣LOGUE to Jane Shore.</HEAD>
<P>THE ELEGY <HI>to the Memory of an Unfor∣tunate Lady,</HI> which is next to be spo∣ken of, as it came from the heart, is very tender and pathetic; more so, I think, than any other copy of verses of our author. We are unacquainted with her history, and with that series of misfortunes, which seems to have drawn on the melancholy catastrophe, alluded to in the beginning of this ELEGY. She is said to be the same person, to whom the Duke of Buckingham has addressed some lines, viz. <Q REND="inline">"To a Lady designing to retire into a Monastery."</Q> This design is also hinted at in POPE's Letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. vii. Pag. 193. Octavo Edition.</NOTE>, where he says in a letter addressed, I presume, to this very per∣son, <Q REND="inline">"If you are resolved, in revenge, to rob the world of so much example as you may
<PB N="250" REF="261"/>
afford it, I believe your design will be vain: for even, in a monastery, your devotions cannot carry you so far towards the next world, as to make this lose sight of you: but you will be like a star, that, while it is fixed in hea∣ven, shines over all the earth. Wheresoever providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing I know, I shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes; and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you, when you never hear of me or them. Your own guardian angels cannot be more constant, nor more silent."</Q></P>
<P>THIS ELEGY opens with a striking abrupt∣ness, and a strong image; the poet fancies he beholds suddenly the phantom of his mur∣dered friend;<Q><L>What beck'ning ghost along, the moonlight shade,</L>
<L>Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?</L>
<L>'Tis she!—but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,</L>
<L>Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?</L></Q> This question alarms the reader; and puts one in mind of that lively and affecting image
<PB N="251" REF="262"/>
in the prophecy of Isaiah, so vigorously conceived, that it places the object full in one's eyes. <Q REND="inline">"Who is this that cometh from Edom? With dyed garments from Bosra<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 63. Ver. 1.</NOTE>?"</Q> Akenside has begun one of his odes in the like manner;<Q><L>O fly! 'tis dire SUSPICION's mein;</L>
<L>And meditating plagues unseen,</L>
<L>The sorc'ress hither bends!</L>
<L>Behold her torch in gall imbru'd;</L>
<L>Behold, her garments drop with blood</L>
<L>Of lovers and of friends!</L></Q> The execrations on the cruelties of this lady's relations, which had driven her to this deplorable extremity, are very spirited and forcible; especially where the poet says emphatically,
<Q><L>Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,</L>
<L>Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall.</L></Q>
He describes afterwards the desolation of this family, by the following lively circumstance and prosopopoeia:<Q><PB N="252" REF="263"/>
<L>There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,</L>
<L>(While the long funerals blacken all the way)</L>
<L>Lo! these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,</L>
<L>And curst with hearts unknowing how to yield!</L>
<L>So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow</L>
<L>For others good, or melt at others woe.</L></Q> The incident of her dying in a country re∣mote from her relations and acquaintance, is touched with great tenderness, and intro∣duced with propriety, to aggravate and heighten her lamentable fate;<Q><L>No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear,
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something like that pathetic stroke in the
Philoctetes of Sophocles, who, among other heavy circumstances of
distress, is said not to have near him, any

translated!</NOTE></L>
<L>Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier;</L>
<L>By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,</L>
<L>By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,</L>
<L>By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,</L>
<L>By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!</L></Q> The force of the repetition of the significant epithet <HI>foreign,</HI> need not be pointed out to any reader of sensibility. The rite of sepul∣ture of which she was deprived, from the
<PB N="253" REF="264"/>
manner of her death, is glanced at with great delicacy; nay, and a very poetical use is made of it.<Q><L>What though no sacred earth allow thee room,</L>
<L>Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?</L>
<L>Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest,</L>
<L>And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast;</L>
<L>There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,</L>
<L>There the first roses of the year shall blow.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF this ELEGY be so excellent, it may be ascribed to this cause; that the occasion of it was real; for it is certainly an indisputable maxim, <Q REND="inline">"That nature is more powerful than fancy; that we can always feel more than we can imagine; and that the most artful fiction must give way to truth."</Q> When Polus the celebrated actor, once affected his audience with more than ordinary emotions, it was <Q REND="inline">"luctû et lamentis veris,"</Q> by bursting out into real cries and tears; for in personating Electra weep∣ing over the supposed urn of her brother Orestes, he held in his hands the real ashes of his own son lately dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aul. Gell. Noct. Attic. Lib. 7. Cap. 5.</NOTE>. Events that have actu∣ally
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>
happened are, after all, the properest sub∣jects for poetry. The best eclogue of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The First.</NOTE> Virgil, the best ode of <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ode 13. Lib. 2.</NOTE> Horace, are founded on real incidents. If we briefly cast our eyes over the most interesting and affecting stories, ancient or modern, we shall find that they are such, as however adorned and a little diversified, are yet grounded on true history, and on real matters of fact. Such, for in∣stance, among the ancients, are the stories, of Joseph, of Edipus, the Trojan war and and its consequences, of Virginia and the Horatii; such, among the moderns, are the stories of king Lear, the Cid, Romeo and Juliet, and Oronooko. The series of events contained in these stories, seem far to surpass the utmost powers of human imagination. In the best-conducted fiction, some mark of im∣probability and incoherence will still appear.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add to these, a tale literally true, which the admirable DANTE has intro∣duced
<PB N="255" REF="266"/>
in his Inferno, and which is not suf∣ficiently known; I cannot recollect any pas∣sage, in any writer whatever, so truly pathetic. Ugolino a Florentine Count is giving the description of his being imprisoned with his children by the archbishop Ruggieri. <Q REND="inline">"The hour approached when we expected to have something brought us to eat. But instead of seeing any food appear, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was thought not improper to distinguis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the more moving passages by Italics. Mr. Baretti's just translation is here used. See his DISSERTATION on the Italian Poets.</NOTE><HI>I heard the doors of that horrible dungeon more closely barred.</HI> I beheld my little children <HI>in silence,</HI> and could not weep. My heart was petrified! the little wretches wept, and my dear Anselm said; <HI>Tu guardi sì, padre: che hai? father you look on us! what ails you?</HI> I could neither weep nor answer, and continued swallowed up in silent agony, all that day, and the following night, even till the dawn of day. As soon as a glimmering ray darted through the dole∣ful prison, that I could view <HI>again those four faces,</HI> in which my own image was impressed,
<PB N="256" REF="267"/>
I <HI>gnawed both my hands,</HI> with grief and rage. My children believing I did this through eagerness to eat, raising themselves suddenly up, said to me, <HI>My father! our torments would be less, if you would allay the rage of your hunger upon us.</HI> I restrained myself, that I might not encrease their misery. <HI>We were all mute that day and, the following.</HI> Quel di, e l'altro stemmo tutti muti! Ah cruel earth why dost not thou swallow us up at once? The fourth day being come, Gaddo falling extended at my feet, cryed; <HI>Padre mio, che non m'ajuti! My father, why do not you help me?</HI> and died. The other three expi∣red one after the other between the fifth and sixth days, famished as thou seest me now! And I, <HI>being seized with blindness,</HI> began to go <HI>groping upon them with my hands and Feet:</HI> and continued calling them by their <HI>names three days</HI> after they were dead. <HI>Etre di li chiamai poichè fur morti:</HI> then hunger vanquished my grief!"</Q></P>
<P>IF this inimitable description had been to be found in Homer, the Greek tragedies, or
<PB N="257" REF="268"/>
Virgil, how many commentaries and pane∣gyrics would it have given rise to? What shall shall we say, or think, of the genius able to produce it? There are many of the same nature; and perhaps the Inferno of Dante is the next composition to the Iliad, in point of originality and sublimity. And with re∣gard to the Pathetic, let this tale stand a testimony of his abilities: for my own part, I truly believe it was never carried to a greater heighth. It is remarkable, that Chaucer ap∣pears to have been particularly struck with this tale in Dante, having highly commended this, <Q REND="inline">"grete poete of Italie,"</Q> for this narra∣tion; with a summary of which he concludes the Monke's Tale. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Urry's Chaucer. Pag. 167. Ver. 824.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE PROLOGUE to <HI>Addison's Tragedy of Cato,</HI> is superiour to any prologue of Dryden; who, notwithstanding, is so justly celebrated for this species of writing. The prologues of Dryden are satyrical and facetious; this of POPE is solemn and sublime, as the subject
<PB N="258" REF="269"/>
required. Those of Dryden contain general topics of criticism and wit, and may pre∣cede any play whatsoever, even tragedy or comedy. This of POPE is particular, and appropriated to the tragedy alone, which it was designed to introduce. The most striking images and allusions it contains, are taken, with judgment, from some passages in the life of Cato himself. Such is that fine stroke, more lofty than any thing in the tragedy itself, where the poet says, that when Caesar amid the pomp and magnificence of a triumph,<Q><L>Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state;</L>
<L>As her dead father's reverend image past,</L>
<L>The pomp was darkned and the day o'ercast;</L>
<L>The triumph ceas'd.—Tears gush'd from ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>The world's great victor pass'd unheeded by;</L>
<L>Her last good man dejected Rome ador'd,</L>
<L>And honour'd Caesar's less than Cato's sword.</L></Q> Such, again, is the happy allusion to an old story mentioned in Martial, of this sage going into the theatre, and immediately com∣ing out of it again:
<Q><L>Such plays alone should win a British ear,</L>
<L>As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear:</L></Q>
<PB N="259" REF="270"/>
From which he draws an artful panegyric, on the purity and excellence of the play he was celebrating.</P>
<P>WITH respect to sprightly turns and poig∣nancy of wit, the prologues of Dryden have not been equalled. The curious reader may consult, particularly, a collection of twenty of them together, in the first edition of the first volume of Tonson's Miscellanies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 263.</NOTE>; many of them, and the most excellent, written on occasion of the players going to Oxford; a custom, for the neglect of which, no good reason can be assigned; except, perhaps, that even the players must now forsooth follow the contemptible cant of decrying that most learned university, and of doing nothing that may contribute to its pleasure and emolument. At this time Dryden was so famous for his prologues, that no piece was relished, nor would the theatres scarcely venture to produce it, if it wanted this fashionable ornament. To this purpose, an anecdote is recorded of
<PB N="260" REF="271"/>
Southerne; who, on bringing his first play on the stage, did not fail to bespeak a pro∣logue of the artist in vogue. The usual price had ever been four guineas. In the present case, Dryden insisted that he must have six for his work; <Q REND="inline">"which, said the mercantile bard, is out of no disrespect to you, young man; but the players have had my goods too cheap."</Q></P>
<P>THE tragedy of Cato itself, is a glaring in∣stance of the force of party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Addison spoke of the secretary of state at that time, he always called him, in the language of Shakespeare, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That canker'd Bolingbroke.</HI>"</Q> Notwithstanding this, Addison assured POPE he did not bring his tragedy on the stage with any party views; nay, desired POPE to carry the poem to the Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke, for their perusal. The play, however, was always considered as a warning to the people, that liberty was in danger during that tory ministry. To obviate the strong impressions, that so popular a performance might make on the minds of the audience, Lord Bolingbroke, in the midst of their violent applauses, sent for Booth, who played Cato, one night, into his box, between the acts, and presented him with fifty guineas; in acknowledgment, as he expressed it with great address, for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator.</NOTE>; so heavy and declamatory a drama would never have met with such rapid and amazing success, if every
<PB N="261" REF="272"/>
line and sentiment had not been particularly tortured, and applied, to recent events, and the reigning disputes of the times. The purity and energy of the diction, and the loftiness of the sentiments, copied in a great measure from Lucan, Tacitus, and Seneca the phi∣losopher, merit approbation. But I have always thought, that those pompous Roman sentiments are not so difficult to be produced, as is vulgarly imagined; and which, indeed, dazzle only the vulgar. A stroke of nature is, in my opinion, worth a hundred such thoughts, as,
<Q><L>When vice prevails, and impious men bear sway,</L>
<L>The post of honour is a private station.</L></Q>
CATO is a fine dialogue on liberty, and the love of one's country; but considered as a dramatic performance, nay as a model of a just tragedy, as some have affectedly repre∣sented it, it must be owned to want, ACTION and PATHOS; the two hinges, I presume, on which a just tragedy ought necessarily to turn, and without which it cannot subsist. It wants
<PB N="262" REF="273"/>
also CHARACTER, although that be not so essentially necessary to a tragedy as ACTION. Syphax, indeed, in his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. 2. Scen. 5.</NOTE> interview with Juba, bears some marks of a rough African: the speeches of the rest may be transferred to any of the personages concerned. The simile drawn from mount Atlas, and the description of the Numidian traveller smothered in the desart, are indeed in character, but suffici∣ently obvious. How Addison could fall into the false and unnatural custom of ending his three first acts with similes, is amazing in so chast and correct a writer. The loves of Juba and Marcia, of Portius and Lucia, are vicious and insipid episodes, debase the dig∣nity, and destroy the unity, of the fable.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, from the practice of our modern play-wrights, that love was the only pas∣sion, capable of producing any great calamities in human life: for this passion has engrossed, and been impertinently introduced into, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">When the resolution of Medea to kill her children, is almost disarmed and destroyed by looking at them, and by their smiling upon her, she breaks out;<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

whines like a shepherd in the Pastor Fido, amidst profound political
reflections, that excel those of Tacitus and Machiavel; and while the most
important event, that could happen to the empire of the world, was debating. In
his imitation of the Orestes of Sophocles, Crebillon has introduced a frigid
love-intrigue. Achilles must be in love in the Iphigenia of Racine; and the
rough Mithridates must be involved in this all-subduing passion. A
pas∣sion however it is, that will always shine upon the stage, where it
is introduced as the chief subject, but not subordinate and
<PB N="264" REF="275"/> secondary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">L'Amour furieux, criminel, malheureux, suivi de remords, arrache de nobles larmes: Point de milieu: il faut, ou que l'amour domine en tiran, ou qu'il ne paroisse pas.

<P>I have just been told, that Crebillon has also very lately made poor Philoctetes in love, in his Desart Island.</P></NOTE>. Thus, perhaps, there cannot be finer subjects for a drama, than
Phaedra, Romeo, Othello, and Monimia. The whole distress in these pieces
arises <HI>singly</HI> from this unfortunate passion, carried to an
extreme<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The introduction of female actresses
on the modern stage, together with that importance which the ladies in
these latter ages have justly gained, in comparison to what the ancients
al∣lowed them, are the two great reasons, among others, of the prevalence of
these tender tales. The ladies of Athens, had not interest enough to damn a
piece of Sophocles or Euripides.</NOTE>. The GREATER passions were the
constant subjects of the Grecian, the TENDERER ones of the French and
English theatres. Terror reigned in the former; pity occupies the latter. The
moderns may yet boast of some pieces, that are not emasculated with this
epi∣demical effeminacy. Racine was at last con∣vinced of its impropriety, and
gave the pub∣lic his Athaliah; in which were no parts, commonly called by the
French l'amoreux <PB N="265" REF="276"/> et de l'amoreuse, which were always
given to their two capital actors. The Merope and Orestes of Voltaire, are
likewise free from any ill-placed tenderness, and romantic gal∣lantry. For
which he has merited the praises of the learned father Tournemine, in a
let∣ter to his friend father Brumoy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Les Oevres de
Voltaire, tom. 8. 38.</NOTE> But LEAR and MACBETH are also striking
instances what interesting tragedies may be written, without having
recourse to a love-story. It is pity, that the tragedy of Cato in which all
the rules of the drama, as far as the mechanism of writing reaches, is not
exact with respect to the unity of time. There was no occasion to extend
the time of the fable longer than the mere representation takes up; all might
have pas∣sed in the compass of three hours from the morning, with a
description of which the play opens; if the poet in the fourth scene of the
fifth act, had not talked of the <HI>setting</HI> sun playing on the armour
of the soldiers.</P>
<P>HAVING been imperceptibly led into this
<PB N="266" REF="277"/>
little criticism on the tragedy of Cato, I beg leave to speak a few words on some other of Addison's pieces. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell has ridiculously marked the author's age to be but twenty two and twenty seven; as if these verses were extra∣ordinary efforts at that age! To these however Addison owed his introduction at court, and his acquaintance with that polite patron Lord Somers.</NOTE> first of his poems addrest to Dryden, Sir John Somers, and king William, are languid, prosaic, and void of any poetical imagery or spirit. The Let∣ter from Italy, is by no means equal to a sub∣ject so fruitful of genuine poetry, and which might have warmed the most cold and cor∣rect imagination. One would have expected, a young traveller in the height of his genius and judgment, would have broke out into some strokes of enthusiasm. With what flat∣ness and unfeelingness has he spoken of statu∣ary and painting! Raphäel never received a more flegmatic elogy. The slavery and su∣perstition of the present Romans, are well touched upon towards the conclusion; but I will venture to name a little piece, on a pa∣rallel subject, that greatly excells this celebra∣ted
<PB N="267" REF="278"/>
Letter; and in which are as much lively and original imagery, strong painting, and manly sentiments of freedom, as I have ever read in our language. It is a Copy of Verses written at Virgil's Tomb, and printed in Dodsley's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 4. pag. 114.</NOTE> Miscellanies.</P>
<P>THAT there are many well wrought de∣scriptions, and even pathetic strokes, in the Campaign, it would be stupidity and malignity to deny. But surely the regular march which the poet has observed from one town to ano∣ther, as if he had been a commissary of the army, cannot well be excused. There is a passage in Boileau, so remarkably opposite to this fault of Addison, that one would almost be tempted to think he had the Campaign in his eye, when he wrote it, if the time would admit <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">But the Art of Poetry was written in the year 1672, many years before the Campaign. Addison might have profited by this rule of his acquaintance, for whom he had a great respect.</NOTE> it.<Q><L>Loin ces rimeurs craintiss, dont l'esprit phlegmatique</L>

<P>WHATEVER censures we have here, too
<PB N="270" REF="281"/>
boldly, perhaps, ventured to deliver on the <HI>pro∣fessed</HI> poetry of Addison, yet must we candidly own, that in various parts of his prose-essays, are to be found many strokes of genuine and sublime poetry; many marks of a vigorous and exuberant imagination. Particularly, in the noble allegory of Pain and Pleasure, the Vision of Mirza, the story of Maraton and Yaratilda, of Constantia and Theodosius, and the beautiful eastern tale of Abdallah and Balsora; and many others: together with several strokes in the Essay on the pleasures of imagination. It has been the lot of many great names, not to have been able to express themselves with beauty and propriety in the fetters of verse, in their respective languages; who have yet manifested the force, fertility, and creative power of a most poetic genius, in prose. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some of the eastern stories, lately published in the AD∣VENTURER, a vast and noble invention is displayed; and this too by an author, that, I have never heard, has written any consi∣derable verses.

<PB N="271" REF="282"/>
Lucian, of Fenelon, of Sir Philip Sidney, and of Dr. T. Burnet, who in his Theory of the Earth, has displayed an imagination, very nearly equal to that of Milton.

After all, the chief and characteristical excel∣lency of Addison, was his HUMOUR; for in humour no mortal has excelled him except Moliere. Witness the character of Sir Roger de Coverly, so original, so natural, and so in∣violably preserved; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. during the month of July. See the characters of Will. Wimble, Moll White, and the justices of the quorum, p. 200. &amp; seq. And Vol. 5. Sir Roger at Westminster Abby, 329. and at the tragedy of the Distrest Mother with the Spec∣tator.</NOTE> particularly, in the month, which the Spectator spends at his hall in the country. Witness also the Drummer, that excellent and neglected comedy, that just picture of life and real manners, where the poet never speaks in his own person, or totally drops or forgets a character, for the sake of introducing a brilliant simile, or acute
<PB N="272" REF="283"/>
remark: where no train is laid for wit; no JEREMYS, or BENS, are suffer'd to appear.</P>
<P>THE EPILOGUE <HI>to Jane Shore,</HI> is the last piece that belongs to this Section; the title of which by this time the reader may have possibly forgot. It is written with the air of gallantry and raillery, which, by a strange perversion of taste, the audience expects in all epilogues to the most serious and pathetic pieces. To recommend cuckoldom and palliate adultery, is their usual intent. I wonder Mrs. Oldfield was not suffered to speak it; for it is superiour to that which was used on the oc∣casion. In this taste Garrick has written some, that abound in spirit and drollery. Rowe's genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are however some images in Rowe strongly painted, such, particularly, as the following, which is worthy of Spenser; speaking of the tower.
<Q><L>Methinks SUSPICION and DISTRUST dwell here,</L>

<BIBL>Lady Jane Grey, Act. 3. Sc. 2.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> was rather delicate and tender, than strong and pathetic; his
compositions sooth us with a tranquill and tender sort of com∣placency,
rather than cleave the heart with
<PB N="273" REF="284"/> pangs of
commiseration. His distresses are entirely founded on the passion
of love. His diction is extremely elegant and chaste, and his versification
highly melodious. His plays are declamations, rather than dialogues, and his
characters are general, and undistinguished from each other. Such a furious
character as that of Bajazet, is easily drawn; and, let me add, easily
acted. There is a want of unity in the fable of Tamerlane. The death's head,
dead body, and stage hung in mourning, in the Fair Penitent, are inartificial
and mecha∣nical methods of affecting an audience. In a word, his plays are
musical and pleasing poems, but inactive and unmoving trage∣dies. This of
Jane Shore is, I think, the most interesting and affecting of any he has
given us: but probability is sadly violated in it by the neglect of the unity
of time. For a per∣son to be supposed to be starved, during the
representation of five acts, is a striking in∣stance of the absurdity

<L>With such an earnest, such a piteous look,</L>

declamations of <HI>Cato.</HI> The interview betwixt Jane Shore and Alicia, in the middle of this act, is also very affecting: where the madness of Alicia is well painted. But of all repre∣sentations of madness, that of Clementina, in the History of Sir Charles Grandison, is the most deeply interesting. I know not whether even the madness of Lear is wrought up, and expressed by so many little strokes of nature, and genuine passion. It is absolute pedantry to prefer and compare, the madness of Orestes in Euripides, to this of Clementina.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that this is become the most popular and pleasing tragedy of all Rowe's works, because it is founded on our own hi∣story. It is to be wished, that our writers would more frequently search for subjects, in the annals of England, which afford many striking and pathetic events, proper for the stage. We have been too long attached to Grecian and Roman stories. In truth, the DOMESTICA FACTA, are more interesting, as well as more useful: more interesting, be∣cause
<PB N="277" REF="288"/>
we all think ourselves concerned in the actions and fates of our countrymen; more useful, because the characters and manners, bid the fairest to be true and natural, when they are drawn from models with which we are exactly acquainted. The Turks, the Persians, and Americans, of our poets, are in reality distinguished from Englishmen, only by their turbans and feathers; and think, and act, as if they were born and edu∣cated within the bills of mortality. The hi∣storical plays of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton has left, in a manuscript, thirty three subjects for tragedies, all taken from the English annals; which manuscript the curious reader may see printed in Newton's Edit. of Milton, Oct.

In the choice of a domestic story, however, much judgment and circumspection must be exerted, to select one of a proper aera; neither of too ancient, or
<PB N="278" REF="289"/>
of too modern a date. The manners of times very ancient, we shall be as apt to falsify, as those of the Greeks and Romans. And re∣cent events, with which we are thoroughly acquainted, are deprived of the power of im∣pressing solemnity and awe, by their notoriety and familiarity. Age softens and wears away all those disgracing and depreciating circum∣stances, which attend modern transactions, merely because they are modern. Lucan was much embarrassed by the proximity of the times he treated of. On this very ac∣count, as well as others, the best tragedy that could be possibly written on the murder of Charles I. would be coldly received. Racine ventured to write on a recent history, in his Bajazet; but would not have attempted it, had he not thought, that the distance of his hero's country repaired, in some measure, the nearness of the time in which he lived. <Q REND="inline">"Major a longinquo reverentia."</Q></P>

shall I be pardoned for suspecting, that POPE would not have succeeded
in this design; that so DIDACTIC a genius would have been deficient in that
SUBLIME and PATHETIC, which are the main nerves of the epopea; that he would
have given us many elegant de∣scriptions, and many GENERAL characters, well
drawn; but would have failed to set be∣fore our eyes the REALITY of these
objects, and the ACTIONS of these characters: for Homer professedly draws
no characters, but gives us to collect them from the looks and behaviour of
each person he introduces; that POPE's close and constant reasoning had
im∣paired and crushed the faculty of imagination; that the political
reflections, in this piece, would, in all probability, have been more
nu∣merous, than the affecting strokes of nature; that it would have more
resembled the HEN∣RIADE, <PB N="281" REF="292"/> than the ILIAD, or even the
GIERU∣SALEMME LIBERATA; that it would have appeared, (if this scheme had been
executed) how much, and for what reasons, the man that is skilful in
painting modern life, and the most secret foibles and follies of his
co∣temporaries, is, THEREFORE disqualified for representing the ages of
heroism, and that simple life, which alone epic poetry can grace∣fully
describe; in a word, that this composi∣tion would have shewn more of the
PHILO∣SOPHER than of the POET. Add to all this, that it was to have been
written in rhyme; a circumstance, sufficient of itself alone to overwhelm
and extinguish all enthusiasm, and produce endless tautologies and
circumlocu∣tions. Are not these suppositions strength∣ened by what Dr.
Warburton 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III.</NOTE> has informed us, namely, that POPE in
this poem intended to have treated amply, 
<Q REND="inline">"of all that regarded civil regimen, or the science of
politics, that the several forms of a republic were here to have been
examined and explained; together <PB N="282" REF="293"/> with the several
modes of religious worship, as far forth as they affect society;"</Q> than
which, surely there could not have been a more improper subject for an epic
poem.</P>
<P>IT is not impertinent to observe, for the sake of those who are fond of the history, of literature, and of the human mind in the pro∣gress of it, that the very first poem that ap∣peared in France, any thing like an epic poem, was on this identical subject, of Brutus ar∣riving in England. It was written by Ma∣ster EUSTACHE, so early as in the reign of Louis the seventh, sirnamed the Young, who ascended the throne in the year 1137, and who was the husband of the celebrated Ele∣onora, afterwards divorced, and married to our Henry the second. The author called it, Le ROMAN de Brut. Every piece of poetry was at that time denominated a romance. The latin language ceased to be regularly spoken in France, about the ninth century; and was succeeded by what was called the <HI>Romance</HI>-tongue, a mixture of the language
<PB N="283" REF="294"/>
of the Francs, and of bad Latin. The species of writing, called <HI>Romans,</HI> began in the tenth century, according to the opinion of the Be∣nedictine fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Lit. T. 6, 7.</NOTE>, who have well refuted, M. Fleuri and Calmet, who make them less ancient by two hundred years. The poem, or <HI>Roman,</HI> we are speaking of, is full of won∣derful and improbable tales, and supernatural adventures, suited to the taste of so barbarous an age. It is matter of some curiosity, to see a specimen of the style of this eldest of the French poets. This is his exordium:<Q><L>Qui veut ouir, qui veut scavoir,</L>
<L>De roi en roi, &amp; d'hoir en hoir,</L>
<L>Qui cils furent, &amp; d'où cils vinrent,</L>
<L>Qui Angleterre primes tinrent.</L></Q> We may judge, from this passage, of the state of the language. Master Eustache has been particularly careful to mark the time in which he lived and wrote, by his two concluding lines:
<Q><L>L'an mil cent cinquante—cinq ans</L>
<L>Fit Maistre Eustache ces Romans.</L></Q>
<PB N="284" REF="295"/>
I will take leave to add, that the second poem now remaining in the French language, was entitled, The Romance of Alexander the Great. It was the confederated work of four authors, famous in their time. Lambert le Court, and Alexander of Paris, sung the ex∣ploits of Alexander; Peter de Saint Clost, wrote his will in verse; the writing the will of a hero being then a common topic; and John le Nivelois, added a book concerning the manner in which his death was revenged. It is remarkable, that before this time, all the <HI>Romans</HI> had been composed in verses of eight syllables: but in this piece, the four authors first used verses of TWELVE syllables, as more solemn and majestic. And this was the origin, tho' but little known, of those verses, which we now call ALEXANDRINES; the French heroic measure: the name being derived from Alexander, the hero of the piece, or from Alexander, the most celebrated of the four poets concerned in this work. These were the most applauded poets of that age. Fauchet highly commends this poem: par∣ticularly
<PB N="285" REF="296"/>
a passage where a Cavalier is struck to the ground with a lance, who, says the old bard,
<Q><L>Du long, comme il etoit, mesura la campagne.</L></Q>
Which is not inferior to Virgil's,
<Q><L>Hesperiam metire jacens.—</L></Q>
One would not imagine this line had been written, so early as the middle of the twelfth century. A great and truly learned anti∣quary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The president Henault, Histoire de France. Tom. 1. p. 151. a Paris 1749.</NOTE> has remarked, for the honour of our country, that about this time,
1160, appeared the first traces of any theatre. <Q REND="inline">"A monk called Geoffry, who
was afterwards abbot of St. Albans in England, employed in the edu∣cation of

any of our representations of the MYSTERIES."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Of the Epistle of SAPPHO to PHAON, and of ELOISA to
ABELARD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no small merit in Ovid, to have in∣vented this beautiful species of writing epistles under feigned characters. It is a high improvement on the Greek elegy; to which its dramatic nature renders it greatly superior. It is indeed no other than a passionate solilo∣quy; in which, the mind gives vent to the distresses and emotions under which it la∣bours: but by being directed and addressed to a particular person, it gains a degree of propriety, that the best-conducted soliloquy, in a tragedy, must ever want. Our impatience under any pressures of grief, and disorder of mind, makes such passionate expostulations with the persons supposed to cause such un∣easinesses, very natural. Judgment is chiefly shewn, by opening the interesting complaint just at such a period of time, as will give oc∣casion
<PB N="287" REF="298"/>
for the most tender sentiments, and the most sudden and violent turns of passion to be displayed. Ovid may, perhaps, be blamed for a sameness of subjects, in these epistles of his heroines; whose distresses are almost all occasioned by their lovers forsaking them. His epistles are likewise too long; which circumstance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the sentiments. It would be a pleasing task, and conduce to the formation of a good taste, to shew how differently Ovid and the Greek tragedians, have made Medea, Phaedra, and Deianira speak, on the very same occasions. Such a comparison would abun∣dantly manifest, the FANCY and WIT of Ovid, and the JUDGMENT and NATURE of Euripides and Sophocles. If the character of Medea was not better supported in the tragedy, which Ovid is said to have produced, and of which Quintilian speaks so advantageously, than it is in her epistle to Jason, one may venture to declare, that, if this drama had survived, the Ro∣mans would not yet have been vindicated, from their inferiority to the Greeks, in tragic poesy.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="299"/>
THE EPISTLE before us is translated by POPE, with faithfulness and with elegance; and much excells any that Dryden translated in the volume he published: many of which were done by some <Q REND="inline">"of the mob of gentle∣men that wrote with ease;"</Q> that is, Sir C. Scroop, Caryl, Pooly, Wright, Tate, Buck∣ingham, Cooper, and other careless rhymers. A good translation of these epistles, is as much wanted, as one of Juvenal; for, out of six∣teen satires of that poet, Dryden himself tran∣slated but six. We can now boast of happy translations in verse, of almost all the great poets of antiquity; whilst the French have been poorly contented with only prose trans∣lations of Homer and Horace, which, says Cervantes, can no more resemble the original, than the wrong side of tapestry can represent the right. The inability of the French tongue to express many Greek or Roman ideas with facility and grace, is here visible: but the Italians have Horace translated by Pallavacini, Theocritus by Ricolotti, Ovid by Anguillara, the Aeneid, admirably well, in blank verse, by
<PB N="289" REF="300"/>
Annibal Caro, and the Georgics, in blank verse also, by Daniello.</P>
<P>I return to Ovid, by observing, that he has put into the mouth of his heroine, a greater number of pretty panegyrical epigrams, than of those tender and passionate sentiments, which suited her character, and made her SENSIBILITY in amours so famous. What can be more elegantly gallant than this compli∣ment to Phaon?
<Q><L>Sume fidem &amp; pharetram; fies manifestus Apollo;</L>
<L>Accedant capiti cornua; Bacchus eris.</L></Q>
This thought seems indisputably to have been imitated, in that most justly celebrated of mo∣dern epigrams:<Q><L>Lumine Acon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro,</L>
<L>Et potis est forma vincere uterque Deos;</L>
<L>Blande puer, lumen quod habes, concede sorori,</L>
<L>Sic tu coecus AMOR, sic erit illa VENUS.</L></Q> My chief reason for quoting these delicate lines, was to point out the occasion of them, which seems not to be sufficiently known.
<PB N="290" REF="301"/>
They were made on Louis de Maguiron, the most beautiful man of his time, and the great favourite of Henry III. of France, who lost an eye at the siege of Issoire; and on the Princess of Eboli, a great beauty, but who was deprived of the sight of one of her eyes, and who was at the same time mistress of Philip II. King of Spain.</P>
<P>IT was happily imagined to write an epistle in the character of Sapho, who had spoken of the joys of love with more warmth and feeling, than any writer of antiquity; and who described the violent symptoms attending this passion, in so strong and lively a manner, that the physician Erasistratus, is said to have dis∣covered the secret malady of the Prince An∣tiochus, who was in love with his mother∣in-law Stratonice, merely by examining the symptoms of his patient's distemper by this description. Addison has inserted in two of his Spectators<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N<SUP>o</SUP>. 223, and 229.</NOTE>, an elegant character of this poetess; and has given a translation of two of
<PB N="291" REF="302"/>
her fragments, that are exquisite in their kind: a translation, which we may presume Addison himself revised, and altered, for his friend Philips. As these two pieces are pretty well∣known, by being found in so popular a book as the Spectator, I shall say no more of them; but shall add two more of her fragments, which, though very short, are yet highly beautiful and tender. The first represents the languor and listlessness of a person deeply in love; we may suppose the fair author look∣ing up earnestly on her mother, casting down the web on which she was employed, and suddenly exclaiming;<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>

<Q><L>Dulcis mater! non possum texere telum</L>

I cannot help adopting the application Addison has made, of his two lines of Phoedrus, to these remains of our poetess; which is perhaps one of the most elegant, and happy applica∣tions that ever was made from any classic whatever:
<Q><L>O suavis anima! qualem te dicam bonam</L>
<L>Antehac fuisse, tales cum sint reliquiae!</L>
<BIBL>Phaedr. Fab. L. 3. v. 5.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="293" REF="304"/>
The versification of this translation of POPE, is, in point of melody, next to that of his pastorals. I am of opinion, that the two fol∣lowing lines, in which alliteration is success∣fully used, are the most harmonious verses, in our language, I mean in rhyme:
<Q><L>Ye gentle gales! beneath my body blow,</L>
<L>And softly lay me on the waves below!</L></Q>
The peculiar musicalness of the first of these lines, in particular, arises principally from it's consisting entirely of iambic feet; which have always a striking, although unperceived, effect in an English verse. As for example;
<Q><L>Yĕ gēntlĕ gāles bĕneāth my̆ bōdy̆ blōw.</L></Q>
Even if the last foot alone be an iambic, it casts a harmony over a whole line:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See WARTON on Spenser, Sect. xi. pag. 259. &amp;c.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Rapt into future times the bard bĕgūn.</L></Q>
There are many niceties in our versification, which few attend to, and which would de∣mand
<PB N="294" REF="305"/>
a regular treatise fully to discourse: we should surely use every possible art, to render our rough Northern language harmonious.</P>
<P>FENTON also has given us a translation of this epistle to Phaon; but it is in no respect equal to POPE's: he has added another, of his own invention, of Phaon to Sappho, in which the story of the transformation of the former, from an old mariner to a beautiful youth, is well told. Fenton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POPE highly valued him. In a letter to Gay, Vol. 8. p. 169. he says, <Q REND="inline">"I have just received the news of the death of a friend, whom I esteemed almost as many years as you; poor Fenton. He died at East-hamstead, of indolence and inactivity; let it not be your fate, but use exercise."</Q> Craggs, who had never received a learned education, had some time before commissioned POPE to find out for him some polite scholar, whom he proposed to take into his family, that he might acquire a taste of literature, by the conversation and in∣struction of the person POPE should recommend. He accord∣ingly chose Fenton; but Craggs died unluckily for the execu∣tion of this scheme. Mr. Craggs had the candor to make no objection to Fenton, tho he was a nonjuror; being, I presume, convinced he was honest as well as learned.</NOTE> was an elegant scholar, and had an exquisite taste; the books he translated for POPE in the Odyssey, are supe∣rior to Brome's. In his Miscellanies, are
<PB N="295" REF="306"/>
some pieces worthy notice; particularly, his Epistle to Southerne; the Fair Nun, imitated from Fontaine; Olivia a Character, and an Ode to Lord Gower, written in the true spirit of Lyric poetry, of which the following allegory is an example:<Q><L>Enamour'd of the SEINE, celestial fair,</L>
<L>The blooming pride of Thetis azure train,</L>
<L>Bacchus, to win the nymph who caus'd his care,</L>
<L>Lash'd his swift tigers to the celtic plain;</L>
<L>There secret in her saphire cell,</L>
<L>He with the Nais wont to dwell,</L>
<L>Leaving the nectar'd feasts of Jove;</L>
<L>And where her mazy waters flow,</L>
<L>He gave the mantling vine to grow,</L>
<L>A trophy to his love.</L></Q> His tragedy of Mariamne has merit, tho the diction be too figurative and ornamental; it does indeed superabound in the richest poetic images: except this may be palliated by urg∣ing, that it suits the characters of oriental heroes, to talk in so high a strain, and to use such a luxuriance of metaphors.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="307"/>
FROM this EPISTLE of Sappho, I may take occasion to observe, that this species of writing, beautiful as it is, has not been much cultivated among us. Drayton, no despica∣ble genius, attempted to revive it, and has left us some good subjects, tho' not very art∣fully handled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The best of his ENGLAND's HEROICAL EPISTLES, are King John to Matilda, Elinor Cobham to Duke Humphry, William De Le Poole to Queen Margaret; Jane Shore to Edward IV, Lord Surrey to Geraldine, and Lady Jane Grey to Lord Gilford Dudley.

We have also a few of this sort of epistles by the late Lord Hervey, in the fourth volume of Dodsley's Miscellanies, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 90. &amp; seq.</NOTE> Flora to Pompey, Arisbe to Marius, and Monimia to Philocles, in which last are some pathetic strokes, and Roxana to Usbeck, taken from the incomparable <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lettres Persans.

I have lately seen several pieces of this species, which as the subjects are striking, will, I hope, one day see the light. They are entitled, <Q REND="inline">"TASSO to LEONORA; written in an interval of his madness: LUCAN to NERO; just after he was condemned to death: Lady OLIVIA to CLEMENTINA, on her refusing to marry Grandison: CHARLES V. from the monastery he retired to, to the King of France: GALGACUS, general of the Britons,

<P>BUT of all stories, ancient or modern, there is not perhaps a more proper one to furnish out an elegiac epistle, than that of ELOISA and ABELARD. Their distresses were of a most SINGULAR and PECULIAR kind; and their names sufficiently known, but not grown trite or common, by too frequent usage. POPE was a most excellent IMPROVER, if no great original INVENTOR; for, as we have seen what an elegant superstructure he has raised on the little dialogues of the Comte de Gabalis, so shall we perceive, in the sequel of this Section, how finely he has worked up the hints of distress, that are scattered up and down in Abelard's and Eloisa's Letters; and, in a little French <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed at the Hague, 1693.</NOTE> history of their lives and

theology, juris∣prudence, philosophy, and the thorny paths of
scholasticism: he gave proofs of a lively <PB N="301" REF="312"/> genius,
by many poetical performances; in∣somuch, that he was reputed to be the
author of the famous Romance of the Rose; which, however, was indisputably
written by JOHN OF MEUN, a little city on the banks of the Loire, about four
leagues from Orleans; which gave occasion to Marot to exclaim;
<Q><L>De Jean de Meun s'enfle le cours de Loire.</L></Q> Of this ancient French poet much more will be said, in the course of
this work, when we come occasionally to speak of Chaucer; suffice it at
present to observe, that he certainly continued and finished the Romance
of the Rose, which

He took his name from the town of Lorris where he was born.</NOTE> William de Lorris had left im∣perfect, forty years before. If
chronology did not absolutely contradict the notion of Abelard's being the
author of this very cele∣brated piece, yet are there internal arguments
sufficient to confute it. The mistake seems <PB N="302" REF="313"/> to
have flowed, from his having given Eloisa the name of ROSE, in one of the
many son∣netts he addrest to her. In this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which was
certainly written an hundred years after Abelard flourished.</NOTE> romance,
there are many severe and satirical strokes on the character of Eloisa,
which the pen of
 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Eloisa speaks thus of Abelard's poetry and skill also in music; for he sung his own verses. <Q REND="inline">"Duo autem fateor, tibi specialiter inerant, quibus foeminarum quarumlibet animos statim allicere poteras; dictandi videlicet &amp; cantandi gratia.

prefixed to a French translation of Boetius, a very popular book at that
time, it appears, that he also translated the epistles of Abelard to
Heloisa, which were in high vogue at the court. He men∣tions also that he
had translated Vegetius, on the Art Military, and a book called the Won∣ders
of Ireland; these works shew us the taste of the age: his words are; 
<Q REND="inline">"t'envoye ores

of any.</NOTE> Boece de consolation, que j'ai translaté en Francois,

sentence strongly also characterises the times.</NOTE>.</Q> It is to be
regretted, that we have no exact picture of the person and beauty of
Eloisa; Abelard himself says, that she was, 
<Q REND="inline">"facie non infima;"</Q> her extraordinary learn∣ing many
circumstances concur to confirm; particularly one, which is, that the nuns of
the Paraclete are wont to have the office of Whitsunday read to them in
Greek, to per∣petuate <PB N="304" REF="315"/> the memory of her understanding
that language. The curious may not be displeased to be informed, that the
Paraclete was built in the parish of Quincey, upon the little river Arduzon,
near to Nogent, upon the Seine. Happening to be in France a few years ago, I
had the curiosity to visit the very spot; which I surveyed with much
veneration. A lady, learned as was Eloisa in that age, who indisputably
understood the latin, greek, and hebrew tongues, was a kind of prodigy: her
literature, says 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abel. Opera p. 10.</NOTE> Abelard, 
<Q REND="inline">"in toto regno nominatissimam fecerat:"</Q> and, we may be
sure, more thoroughly attached him to her. Bussy Rabutin speaks in high
terms of com∣mendation, of the purity of Eloisa's latinity: a judgment worthy
a French count! There is a force, but not an elegance in her style; which is
blemished, as might be expected, by many phrases unknown to the pure ages
of the Roman language, and by many Hebra∣isms, borrowed from the
translation of the bible.</P>

I now propose to pass through the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The compliment which Prior paid our author on this EPISTLE, is at once full of elegance and very lively imagery. He addresses it to Abelard, and says that, POPE has <HI>wove</HI>

penitence and passion, will more amply and strikingly appear.</P>

 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was difficult to speak of this catastrophe that befel Abe∣lard with any dignity and grace: our poet however has done it. I know not where castration is the chief cause of distress, in any other poem, except in a very extraordinary one of Catullus, where Atys, struck with madness by Berecynthia, in a fit of enthusiasm, inflicts this punishment on himself. After which he laments his condition in very pathetic strains. The poem has been so little remarked on, that I shall take the liberty of inserting the following passage in the speech of Atys, which is very dramatic, full of spirit, and sudden changes of passion.
<Q><L>Egone a meâ remota haec ferar in memora domo?</L>
<L>Patriâ, bonis, amicis, genitoribus abero?</L>
<L>Abero foro, palestrâ, stadio, gymnasiis?</L>
<L>Miser, ah miser, querendum est etiam atque etiam, anime,</L>
<L>Quod enim genus? figura est? ego numquid abierim?</L>
<L>Ego mulier?—ego adolescens, ego ephebus, ego puer,</L>
<L>Ego gymnasii fui flos, ego eram decus olei,</L>
<L>Mihi januae frequentes, mihi limina tepida;</L>
<L>Mihi floridis corollis redimita domus erat,</L>
<L>Linquendum ubi esset orto mihi sole cubiculum.</L>
<L>Egone deum ministra, &amp; Cybeles famula ferar?</L>
<L>Egone maenas, ego mei pars, ego vir sterilis ero?</L>
<L>Ego viridis algida Idae nive amicta loca colam?</L>

This whole poem being of a strain superiour to any thing in the Roman poesy, and more passionate and sublime than any part of Virgil, and being also so much above the tender and elegant genius of Catullus, whose name it bears, inclines me to think it a translation from some Grecian writer; and perhaps, if the reader will peruse the whole, it will give him the truest notion of an old dithyrambic, of any poem antiquity has left us. The text is in some places much corrupted, but enough remains pure and intelligible to place it at the head of latin poetry, how strangely soever it has been neglected. It ought to be observed, that the seventh, eighth, and ninth lines of this quotation, bear a wonderful resemblance to a fine passage in the book of Job, Ch. 29. Ver. 6. &amp; seq.</NOTE></L></Q><PB N="313" REF="324"/>
One knows not which most to applaud, the lively imagery, the pathetic, or the artful de∣cency, with which this trasaction is delicately hinted at, in these most excellent lines: which are the genuine voice of nature and passion, and place the object intended to be imprest on the reader full in his sight.</P>
<P>SHE next reminds Abelard of the solemnity of her taking the veil, from verse one hundred and six, to one hundred and eighty four, which are highly beautiful, particularly these circumstances attending the rite—
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 111.</NOTE> As with <HI>cold</HI> lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,</L>
<L>The shrines all <HI>trembled,</HI> and the lamps <HI>grew pale!</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="314" REF="325"/>
These two circumstances are fancied with equal force and propriety; and this supposed prognostic of the uneasiness she would un∣dergo in the monastic life, is very affecting. But her passion intruded itself even in the midst of this awful act of devotion; the strength of which she represents by this par∣ticular,
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 115.</NOTE> Yet then to these dread altars as I drew,</L>
<L>Not on the <HI>Cross</HI> my eyes were fix'd but <HI>You.</HI></L></Q>

enamour'd let me lie,</L>
<L>Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,</L>

<Q><L>Give all thou <HI>canst!</HI>—and let me dream the <HI>rest.</HI></L></Q>

<L>And melts in visions of eternal day!</L></Q> What a judicious and poetical use hath POPE here made of the opinions of the mystics and quietists: how would Fenelon have been de∣lighted with these lines! True poetry, after all, cannot well subsist, at least is never so striking, without a tincture of enthufiasm: the sudden transition has a fine effect;
<Q><L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. 223.</NOTE> Far other dreams my erring soul employ,</L>
<L>Far other raptures of unholy joy.</L></Q>
Which raptures are painted with much sen∣sibility, and in very animating colours. <Q REND="inline">"Nec etiam dormienti suis illusionibus parcunt."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ep. p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></Q> Again,
<Q><L><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">V. 223.</NOTE> Oh curst dear horrors of all-conscious night;</L>
<L>How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!</L></Q>
<PB N="321" REF="332"/>
This is very forceibly expressed. She pro∣ceeds to recount a dream; in which I was always heavily disappointed, because the imagined distress is such, as might attend the dreams of any person whatever. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is partly from Dido's dream.</NOTE><Q><L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. 242.</NOTE> —Methinks we wandring
go</L>
<L>Thro dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,</L>
<L>Where round some mouldring tow'r pale ivy creeps,</L>
<L>And low brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps;</L>
<L>Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies,</L>
<L>Clouds interpose, &amp;c.</L></Q> These are, indisputably, picturesque lines; but what I want is a VISION of some such appro∣priated, and peculiar distress, as could be in∣cident to none but Eloisa; and which should be drawn from, and have reference to, her single story. What distinguishes Homer and Shakespear from all other poets, is, that they do not give their readers GENERAL ideas: every image is the particular and unalienable property of the person who uses it; it is suited to no other; it is made for him or her alone.
<PB N="322" REF="333"/>
Even Virgil himself is not free from this fault; but is frequently general and indiscri∣minating, where Homer is minutely circum∣stantial. She next compares his situation with her own:<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 250.</NOTE> For thee the fates, severely kind,
ordain</L>
<L>A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;</L>
<L>Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose,
 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The four fimiles that follow, drawn from
religion, are ad∣mirable.</NOTE></L>
<L>No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.</L></Q> Here Eloisa glances with great modesty and delicacy, at the irreparable misfortune of her mutilated husband, which however she always mentions with regret. I question whether it may be improper to alleviate the dryness of these critical remarks, with the following story; which I wish had fallen into the hands of Fontaine. <Q REND="inline">"The Greeks waged war upon the duke of Benevento, and made him very uneasy. Thedbald, Marquis of Spoleto, his ally, marching to his assistance, and ha∣ving taken some prisoners, ordered them to be
<PB N="323" REF="334"/>
castrated, and in that condition, sent them back to the Greek general, with orders to tell him, that he had done it to oblige the emperor, whom he knew to be a lover of eunuchs; and that he would endeavour to send him, in a short time, a much greater number of them. The Marquis was preparing to be as good as his word, when one day a woman, whose husband had been taken prisoner, came all in tears to the camp, and begged to speak to Thedbald. The Marquis having asked her the cause of her grief, my Lord, says she, I wonder that such a valiant hero as you should trifle away your time in warring with women, when men are unable to resist you. Thed∣bald replied, that, since the days of the Ama∣zons, he had never heard that war had been made upon women. My Lord, answered the Greek woman, can a crueller be made upon us, than to deprive our husbands of what gives us health, pleasure, and children? When you make eunuchs of them, it is mutilating us, not them: you have lately taken away our cattle and goods, without any complaint
<PB N="324" REF="335"/>
from me: but this being an irreparable loss to several of my neighbours, I could not avoid imploring the compassion of the conqueror. The whole army was so pleased with this woman's ingenuous declaration, that they re∣stored her husband to her, and all they had taken from her. As she was going away, Thedbald asked her, what she would be will∣ing should be done to her husband, if he was found in arms again. He has eyes, said she, a nose, hands, and feet: these are his OWN, which you may take from HIM if he deserves it; but leave him, if you please, what be∣longs to ME."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bibliotheque Universelle, Tom. 11. p. 10.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>A HINT in the Letters has been beautifully heightened, and elevated into exquisite poetry, in the next paragraph. Eloisa says only, <Q REND="inline">"Inter ipsa missarum solemnia, ubi purior esse debeat oratio, obscoena earum voluptatum phantasmata its sibi penitus miserrimam cap∣tivant animam, ut turpitudinibus illis, magis quam orationi, vacem. Nec solum quae egimus,
<PB N="325" REF="336"/>
sed loca pariter &amp; tempora."</Q>—Let us see how this has been improved.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 251.</NOTE> What scenes appear, where'er I
turn my view,</L>
<L>The dear ideas where I fly pursue,</L>
<L>Rise in the grove, before the altar rise—</L></Q> Then follows a circumstance peculiarly tender and proper, as it refers to a particular excel∣lence of Abelard,
<Q><L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. 269.</NOTE> THY VOICE I seem in every hymn to hear,</L>
<L>With every bead I drop too soft a tear.</L></Q>
To which succeeds that sublime description of a high mass, which came from the poet's soul, and is very striking.<Q><L><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">V. 259.</NOTE> When from the censer clouds
of fragrance roll,</L>
<L>And swelling organs lift the rising soul,</L>
<L>One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,</L>
<L>Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight,</L>
<L>In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,</L>
<L>While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.</L></Q></P>
<P>I BELIEVE few persons have ever been pre∣sent at the celebrating a mass in a good choir,
<PB N="326" REF="337"/>
but have been extremely affected with awe, if not with devotion; which ought to put us on our guard, against the insinuating nature of so pompous and alluring a religion as popery. Lord Bolingbroke being one day present at this solemnity, in the chapel at Versailles, and seeing the archbishop of Paris elevate the host, whispered his companion the Marquis de *****, <Q REND="inline">"If I were king of France, I would always perform this ceremony myself."</Q></P>
<P>ELOISA now acknowledges the weakness of her religious efforts, and gives herself up to the prevalence of her passion.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 280.</NOTE> Come with one glance of those
deluding eyes,</L>
<L>Blot out each bright idea of the skies;</L>
<L>Take back that grace, that sorrow, and these tears,</L>
<L>Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs;</L>
<L>Snatch me just mounting, from the blest abode,</L>
<L>Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!</L></Q> Suddenly, religion rushes back on her mind, and she exclaims eagerly,<Q><PB N="327" REF="338"/>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 300.</NOTE> No fly me, fly me! far as pole to
pole!—</L>
<L>Ah, <HI>come</HI> not, <HI>write</HI> not, <HI>think</HI> not once of
me,</L>
<L>Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee.</L>
<L>Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign,</L>
<L>Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.</L></Q> This change is judicious and moving. And the following invocation to hope, faith, and christian grace, to come and take full possession of her soul, is solemn, and suited to the con∣dition of her mind; for it seems to be the poet's intention to shew the force of religion over passion at last, and to represent her as a little calm and resigned to her destiny, and way of life. To fix her in which holy tem∣per, the circumstance that follows may be supposed to contribute. For she relates an incident to Abelard, which had made a very deep impression on her mind, and cannot fail of making an equal one, on the mind of those readers, who can relish true poetry, and strong imagery. The scene she paints is aw∣ful: she represents herself lying on a tomb,
<PB N="328" REF="339"/>
and thinking she heard some <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 308.</NOTE> spirit calling to her in every low wind,—<Q><L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Virgil may however have given the
hint.—Hinc exaudiri voces, &amp; verba vocantis visa viri—L. 4.
460.</NOTE> Here as I watch'd the dying lamps around,</L>
<L>From yonder shrine I heard a hollow found,</L>
<L>Come sister come, (if said, or seem'd to say)</L>
<L>Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!</L>
<L>Once like thyself I trembled, wept and pray'd,
 <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It is well contrived, that this invisible
speaker, should be a person that had been under the very same kind of
misfortunes with Eloisa.</NOTE></L>
<L>Love's victim then, but now a sainted maid.</L></Q> This scene would make a fine subject for the pencil; and is worthy a capital painter. He might place Eloisa in the long ile of a great Gothic church; a lamp should hang over her head, whose dim and dismal ray should afford only light enough to make darkness visible. She herself should be represented in the <HI>in∣stant,</HI> when she first hears this aërial voice, and in the attitude of <HI>starting round</HI> with astonishment and fear. And this was the
<PB N="329" REF="340"/>
method a very great master took, <HI>to paint a sound,</HI> if I may be allowed the expression. This subject was the baptism of Jesus Christ; and in order to bring into this subject the re∣markable incident of the voice from heaven, which cried aloud, <Q REND="inline">"This is my beloved son,"</Q> he represented all the assembly that attended on the banks of Jordan, gazing up into heaven, with the utmost ardor of amaze∣ment.</P>
<P>AT this call of a sister in misfortune, who had been visited with a sad similitude of griefs with her own, Eloisa breaks out in a religious transport,<Q><L>I come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs,</L>
<L>Coelestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs;</L>
<L>Thither where <HI>sinners</HI> may have rest I go!</L></Q> She then calls on Abelard, to pay her the last sad offices; and to be present with her in the article of death,
<Q><L>See my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll—</L></Q>
And then a circumstance of personal fondness intervenes,
<Q><PB N="330" REF="341"/>
<L><HI>Suck</HI> my last breath, and catch the flying soul!</L></Q>
But she instantly corrects herself, and would have her Abelard attend her at these last solemn moments, only as a devout priest, and not as a fond lover. The image, in which she represents him coming to administer ex∣treme unction, is striking and picturesque;<Q><L>Ah no—in sacred vest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nts mayst thou stand,</L>
<L>The hallow'd taper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words printed in Italics,
ought to be looked on as particularly beautiful.</NOTE><HI>trembling</HI> in
thy hand,</L>
<L><HI>Present</HI> the cross before my <HI>lifted</HI> eye,</L>
<L>Teach me at once, and learn of me, to die!</L></Q> She adds, that it will be <HI>some</HI> consolation to behold him once more, tho' even in the ago∣nies of death,
<Q><L>Ah then! thy once-lov'd Eloisa see!</L>
<L>It will be <HI>then</HI> no crime to <HI>gaze</HI> on me!</L></Q>
Which last line I could never read without great emotion; it is at once so pathetic, and so artfully points back to the whole train and nature of their misfortunes. The cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="331" REF="342"/>
she wishes may attend the death of Abelard, are poetically imagined, and are also agreeable to the notions of mystic devo∣tion. The death of St. Jerome is finely pain∣ted by DOMENICHINO, with such attendant particulars.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 340.</NOTE> In trance ecstatic may thy pangs
be drown'd,</L>
<L>Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,</L>
<L>From opening skies may streaming glories shine,</L>
<L>And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.</L>
<L>May one kind grave unite each hapless name,</L>
<L>And graft my love immortal on thy fame!</L></Q> This wish was fulfilled. The body of Abe∣lard, who died twenty years before Eloisa, was sent to Eloisa, who interred it in the mona∣stery of the Paraclete, and it was accompa∣nied with a very extraordinary form of Abso∣lution, from the famous Peter de Clugny; <Q REND="inline">"Ego Petrus Cluniacensis abbas, qui Petrum Abelardum in monachum Cluniacensem re∣cepi, &amp; corpus ejus furtim delatum Heloissae Abbatissae, &amp; monialibus Paracleti concessi,
<PB N="332" REF="343"/>
auctoritate omnipotentis Dei, &amp; omnium sanc∣torum, absolvo eum suo officio, ab omnibus peccatis suis."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Eloisa herself, says <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melanges, T. 2. p. 55.</NOTE> Vigneul Marville, sollicited for this absolution, and Peter de Clugny willingly granted it; on what it could be founded, I leave to our learned theologists to determine. In certain ages, opinions have prevailed, for which no solid reason can be given."</Q> When Eloisa died in 1163, she was interred by the side of her beloved husband: I must not forget to mention, for the sake of those who are fond of miracles, that when she was put into the grave, Abelard stretched out his arms to re∣ceive her, and closely embraced her.</P>
<P>ELOISA, at the conclusion of the EPISTLE to which we are now arrived, is judiciously re∣presented as gradually settling into a tranquillity of mind, and seemingly reconciled to her fate. She can bear to speak of their being buried to∣gether, without violent emotions. Two lovers are introduced as visiting their celebrated
<PB N="333" REF="344"/>
tombs, and the behaviour of these strangers is finely imagined;<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 353.</NOTE> From the full quire when loud
Hosannas rise,</L>
<L>And swell the pomp of <HI>dreadful</HI> sacrifice,</L>
<L>Amid that scene, if some relenting eye,</L>
<L>Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,</L>
<L>Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heav'n,</L>
<L>One human tear shall drop—and be forgiv'n!</L></Q> With this line, in my opinion, the poem should have ended, for the eight additional ones, concerning some poet, that haply might arise to sing their misfortunes, are languid and flat, and diminish the pathos of the fore∣going sentiments. They might stand for the conclusion of almost any story.</P>
<P>THIS EPISTLE, is, on the whole, one of the most highly finished, and certainly the most interesting, of the pieces of our author; and, together with the ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, is the only instance of the Pathetic POPE has given us. I think
<PB N="334" REF="345"/>
one may venture to remark, that the reputa∣tion of POPE, as a poet, among posterity, will be principally owing to his WINDSOR∣FOREST, his RAPE OF THE LOCK, and his ELOISA TO ABELARD; whilst the facts and characters alluded to and exposed, in his later writings, will be forgotten and un∣known, and their poignancy and propriety little relished. For WIT and SATIRE are transitory and perishable, but NATURE and PASSION are eternal.</P>
