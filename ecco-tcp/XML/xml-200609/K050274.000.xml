<HEAD>AN
Impartial Acccount, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was many Years ago since
the <HI>French</HI> Court regretted
very much the hight of the
Publick Credit in <HI>England,</HI>
they look'd upon it as the Great, and
perhaps the only Advantage that <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
had over them in the War, Name∣ly,
That by the Establish'd Reputa∣tation
of the Publick Funds here, and
the Authority of Parliamentary Credit,
whatever Sum of Money was Voted
in <HI>England,</HI> tho' the Funds did not
produce it in many Years, and tho' the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Loans were prodigiouslp Great, yet the
Pnblick could command the Money in
a few Days, perhaps in a few Hours,
Five and twenty Hundred Thousand
Pound Sterling, an Immense Sum told
out into <HI>French</HI> Livres, has been Sub∣scrib'd
to the Engraftment of the Bank
in a few Hours: Lotteries of a Million
have been fill'd before the Lottery it
self could be pass'd in Parliament, and
before it could be Imagin'd possible to
Crowd into the Office, the Tickets
have been all Subscrib'd, and the Mony
all immediately paid in.</P>
<P>This was as much the Terror of our
Neighbours, as it was the Honour and
Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> and Foreigners
have been heard to say, That there was
no getting the better of <HI>England</HI> by Bat∣tle,
No, tho' Victory was always on their
side. That while we had thus an inex∣haustible
Storehouse of Money, no su∣periority
in the Field, could be a Match
for this superiority of Treasure; for
Money being the Basis of the War, in
the Modern way of carrying such things
on in the World, it had long since been
a receiv'd Maxim in the Case of War,
That the longest Purse, not the longest
Sword, would be sure to Conquer at
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
last: As in two Mens Boxing, not al∣ways
he that had the strongest Arm,
but he that had the longest Breath,
would be sure to have the better of
his Enemy.</P>
<P>It was in vain that the late King of
<HI>France,</HI> tho' he had an Absolute Com∣mand
of the Greatest, and at first the
Wealthiest Nation in the World, tryed
all the Methods, all the Arts that hu∣man
Wit could Invent to raise a Fund
of Credit in his Kingdom, and could
never bring it to pass; the whole
Council of <HI>France</HI> could never dictate
to him the Method how it should be
done: This Coy Mistress, call'd Credit,
could never be woo'd; the more he pur∣sued
her, or the farther he follow'd her,
the faster she fled from him; and he
had the continual Mortification to see
his National Credit fall, even by the
same Methods which made our Nation∣al
Credit rise; and as our Credit here
grew daily, and at last encreased to such
a hight, that from paying Twelve and
Fourteen <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Money, and strug∣gling
with infinite Difficulties to get it
brought in, we came to reducing the In∣terst
from Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> to Five <HI>per Cent.</HI>
and now to have the publick Command
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of what Money they pleas'd at Four <HI>per
Cent.</HI> and have it brought in faster than
they could take it, or had any occasion
for it.</P>
<P>It is not possible to set down here,
the Schemes, Projects, and infinite
Arts and secret Practises which the King
of <HI>France</HI> used to command Credit; all
which were disappointed and blown up,
by the frequent Exigences of the Pub∣lick
Affairs, forcing him to violate the
Faith and Honour of his Edicts, Decla∣ring
such or such a Fund of Interest to
be Sacred and Unalterable, and not to
be stop'd upon any account whatever;
and the next Year, or perhaps sooner,
breaking thro' all those Sacred Edicts,
suppressing the Payment, and leaving
the Lenders to Starve: Whereas in
<HI>England</HI> one Parliament always Voted
the making good the Deficiencies of
another; and no misapplication of
Money could be made, but every Fund
was kept Sacred to its particular special
Appropriation; So that no Man what∣ever
having lent his Money to the Go∣vernment
on the Credit of a Parliamen∣tary
Fund, has been Desrauded of his
Property.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Thus the Arbitrary Government of
the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Property of
every Man being intirely at his Dispose,
destroy'd the very Reason and Nature
of Publick Credit; and the Limited
Power of <HI>Great-Britains</HI> Crown, the
Strings of the Purse being in the hands
of the Parliament, whose Appropria∣tions,
if I may be allow'd to speak so
plain, even our Kings themselves durst
not break in upon, has been the Rea∣son
and Foundation of such an im∣mense,
boundless Credit, that nothing
can hurt or destroy, unless the Parlia∣ment
should Invert their way of act∣ing,
and take into their hands the same
Absolute Power which it is their busi∣ness
to Restrain, and Wound and In∣jure
themselves, that is to say, the Peo∣ple
whom they Represent.</P>
<P>But Fate and the Fortune of <HI>France</HI>
has now turn'd the Tables upon us, and
we see the same Arbitrary Power that
in the late Reign in <HI>France</HI> plung'd them
into an insuperable Debt, and into an ir∣recoverable
state of Deficiency and Discount,
I say, the same Arbitrary Power
has rais'd an inconceivable Species of
meer Air and Shadow, realizing Fan∣cies
and Imaginations, Visions and Ap∣paritions,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
and making the meer specu∣lations
of Things, act all the Parts,
and perform all the Offices of the
Things themselves; and thus in a mo∣ment
their Debts are all vanish'd, the
Substance is answer'd by the Shadow;
and the People of <HI>France</HI> are made the
Instruments of putting the Cheat upon
themselves, the Name of the thing
is made an Equivalent to the Thing it
self, transposing the Debts from the
King to themselves, and being contented
to Discharge the Publick, owe the
Money to one another.</P>
<P>As this is the meer Consequence of
a boundless Power in the King by
which he is made able to put every
Scheme, however impracticable in
other places, in a Course of Opperation
there; so that very Limitation of
Power, which is in other Cases our
Glory and Advantage, is the Reason
why, let our Credit be what it will,
our Debts remain, and must be wasted
or diminished off, by the slow fire of
Parliamentary Proceedings, and by no
other way.</P>
<P>And thus for once in the World,
Tyranny has the whip hand of Liberty;
for nothing can be done in <HI>England</HI> like
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
this, even the Parliament it self is li∣mited,
and there are its redeemable and
unredeemable Funds the last of which
are a Burthen, nothing but the Num∣ber
<HI>Ninety Nine</HI> (Years) can put an
end to: But in <HI>France</HI> they have an un∣bounded
liberty to act as they please.</P>
<P>Let no Man mistake me here, as if
I were bewailing the Incumbrances of
National Privileges, and suggesting
that it was Pity we should be a Nation
of Liberty with such a Burthen of
Debt; on the other hand, let us be,
say I, a free Nation deep in Debt, ra∣ther
than a Nation of Slaves Owing
nothing; and indeed even in this the
Condition of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> stands
in a posture much to our Advantage
when compared together, namely
<HI>France,</HI> a Kingdom immensely Rich as
a Government, wretchedly Poor as a
People; <HI>England,</HI> a Government Em∣barrass'd
in Debt, Exhausted of Funds,
and not able (easily) to get out of
Debt; But as a People immensely Rich,
Rich in the particular and private
Wealths of the Subjects; Poor, that
is to say, Encumbred in Debt, speak∣ing
of the publick state of Things as a
Government, and yet with all this,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
while the publick Credit remains, we can
never be said to be Poor: But of that
in another Place, and on another Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>It remains now, that we look into
this slagrant Delusion of paying a Na∣tions
Debts, as it is Practising upon the
Ignorant People in <HI>France:</HI> Never in
my Opinion, was any Number of Peo∣ple
so hook'd in to put a sham upon
themselves, and then call it paying off
the King's Debts, or the publick Debts;
for, as above, 'tis no more and no less,
than a parcel of Fools Discharging the
King of his Debts, and Owing it to
one another. And this is another Rea∣son
of this piece of Magic in <HI>France,</HI>
for the very Want of Credit in <HI>France,</HI>
has been the Reason of their obtaining
the Credit of paying their Debts.
This Paradox shall be unriddled im∣mediately
thus: Had not the Publick
Credit been bad, had not the State
Bills, that is to say, the publick Credit
run at Sixty to Sixty three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Dis∣count,
the People would never have
brought themselves to part with them
for the Bonds, or Shares in a New
Company; a Brat of State, which has
its Life in the King's Breath, and must
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
die whenever that Breath pleases to
determine it, that live by the favour of
the King, and Consequently always
lives at his Mercy; just thus, turn the
Tables again, I say, just thus stands the
Case in <HI>England</HI> Reverst, the goodness
of the Publick Credit in <HI>England,</HI> is the
reason why we shall never be out of
Debt; for where is the Man that ha∣ing
lent his Money to the Publick on
the Credit of Parliamentary Security,
will upon a whim, Discharge that Fund,
and take a precarious Company of
Private Men for the Money.</P>
<P>The Funds are our Security, and we
are satisfyed fully in the safety of those
Funds, because made Sacred by the
Authority of Parliament; this is our
advantage who are private Men, and
have our Estates there; but this is a
blow to the very possibility of paying
the publick Debts, because no Man is
out of Love with his Security, and be∣cause
no better Security can be proposed by
any Man.</P>
<P>From these Premises, I come down to
the very Extraordinary Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> a
Man, who being first acquainted with the solid Immovable state of Credit in <HI>England,</HI> and seeing the fluctuating

manner of things in France, plainly saw
also, how easie it was to push those
things there, which he could not so
much as think of in <HI>England,</HI> without
apprehensions of being pull'd in pieces
by the Rabble.</P>
<P>The first thing Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did, who
wisely concluded, that a foundation of
Credit must be laid before any sufficient
Project could be founded upon it, I say,
the first thing Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did, was to
Contemplate the Raising a Royal Bank
in <HI>France,</HI> this he Effected by the Con∣currence
of the King, whose Sanction
there, as the Parliament would be here,
was absolutely necessary for such a
Work.</P>
<P>Now let the Schemes Engrafted since,
or then design'd to be Engrafted upon
the foot of this beginning be what they
will, whether Knavish or Sincere,
as I will not take upon me here to De∣termine;
yet I say, let it be one way
or other, 'tis Evident Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> made a
Right Judgment, and that nothing
could be projected for the publick Service
of any kind, without an Establish'd
Credit to Center some where.</P>
<P>As I have said already, it was im∣possible
this should be gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted upon the
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
Government, the Endeavours to bring
it to pass before, having been rendred a∣bortive
by the frequent Exigencies of that
Government, forcing them to break in
upon themselves, mortgage Faith and
Honour, Royal Edicts, and Royal Pro∣mises,
the strongest Engagements that
could at that time be made; by which
means the few Men that had any Money,
were made Cautious, and were grown
too Wise to put it into hands which they
could not depend upon for the Demand
of it again, when it should be wanted.</P>
<P>It remain'd then to resolve, that
Credit could now, be only raised upon
the forming Societies of Private Men,
who were Masters of Cash, and able
to Support the Credit they took, with
whom it might be safe to venture the
Deposite of Money, and who by an
Exact Currency of payments, might in
Consequence, and by Degrees, obtain
the name or Title of a safe Fund, and
become the Center of proper Credit for
the whole Kingdom; a thing at that
time greatly wanted, for the advantage
of Trade in <HI>France,</HI> as well as for the
Purpose design'd by Mr. <HI>Laws.</HI> This al∣most
by the nature of the thing, would
be called a Bank, and would be managed
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
by the first Adventuters in their own
right, and independent of the King or
of any Branch of the Government; so
that except by meer Plunder, even all
one as by Rifling the City of <HI>Paris,</HI>
the King could never lay his hand upon
any thing which was put into their
keeping.</P>
<P>This was a well lay'd design, had
there been no more <HI>intended</HI> than was
<HI>pretended.</HI> For upon the Credit and
Capital Stock of the first Subscribers,
there was immediately a Clear prospect
of a Currant Running Cash, Establish'd
upon just Foundations, and Sufficient
to answer all the business of <HI>France;</HI> I
mean such business as was fit for the
managment of a Bank.</P>
<P>When this Scheme was shew'd to the
Regent, he was too penetrating not to
see immediately, that it was too Beneficial
a thing not to be Encouraged, as well
for the Credit of the Nation in General,
as for the use of the Government in
Particular; and therefore received it
with open Arms, and assured Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
of his Favour and Protection: But this
was not all, for every day giving new
lights into the thing it self, and new
prospects arrising every day, the Regent
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
who begun even then to see that there
was nothing which might not be hoped
for from such a Design, as well for the
Service of the Government as the Ad∣vantage
of Commerce in General, and
of Private Persons interested in it in Par∣ticular;
for really a Face of publick
Credit was a new thing in <HI>France,</HI> and
had so long been Desir'd, and so often
Endeavoured without Success, that it
look'd like a Dream, and that Man that
pretended to undertake it, was like an
Angel come from Heaven to bring them
good Tidings. From this time forward
Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> as he well deserv'd, was re∣ceived
with great Distinction, and ad∣mitted
to such Privacies as became ne∣cessary
by the Importance of his Un∣dertaking;
and as they found his first
Scheme Fruitful of great Improvement,
he was Encouraged to apply his
thoughts Effectually to those Improve∣ments,
that something might be brought
to pass for the publick good, and Espe∣cially
to restore Credit to <HI>France,</HI> a thing
the whole Kingdom, but especially as a
Government, had suffered many Year
for the want of.</P>
<P>In prosecution of this Confidence,
the Bank was Established, the Patents
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
or Charter, as we would call it here, were
Expedited for its Foundation; the King
begins the Subscription, the Duke
Regent follows, and innumerable others;
they are Impower'd to take in a Hun∣dred
Millions Original Stock, and to
give out Bills for Currant Cash payable
at Demand, and to the Bearer, just after
the manner in <HI>England;</HI> and from that
time to this they have acted just as ours
do here, are managed by a Court of
Directors, for the Governing daily, every
incident that may happen, and having
preserv'd their Credit in payments In∣violably,
it is not easie to concieve what
Stocks of Money they have brought
into their Hands, and to what monstruous degree of Credit they are al∣ready
arrived.</P>
<P>Their business is just as it is with our
Bank here; they receive and Pay vast
Sums of Money for the King and their
Bills pass in the Royal Treasury at
Ready Money; they have built a New
Bureau or Office, and it was a prodigy
not often seen in <HI>Paris,</HI> to see about
Three hundred Carriages Loaden with
Silver and Gold, carried under the Guard
of a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of Dragoons, through the
Streets to the New House, where they
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
made a large Vault, which they call
the <HI>Charter-house,</HI> for the keeping it safe
and preserving with it their Writings,
Pledges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They lend Money upon Jewels,
Plate, and things of real Value, not
Perishable by keeping; and upon Mort∣gage
of Lands at three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest;
they Discount Bills, and take in Money,
Issuing Bills of Credit payable at De∣mand;
and it is inconcievable the mighty
Encrease of business they have upon
their hands in so little time, and the
immense Sums of Money they have by
them in Specie.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> having thus successfully
finished this great Affair, was at Leasure
to enquire what further Projects might
be founded upon this of a Royal Bank
He was too knowing not to have in his
Head the General Idea of all those
things which have happened since, tho'
not perhaps of the Success they have
met with, which I cannot but believe
have Exceeded his own Expectation:
But he that knew that nothing could
be done without a Fund of Credit first
Established, knew also that such a Fund
of Credit being once throughly Esta∣blished,
nothing could miscarry that was
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
founded upon it; for as half the Projects
In the World fail, and become abortive
for want of ready Money and Credit,
so when once a Project is backed and
supported with a flush of Ready Money,
they must be weak Mannagers indeed,
if they miscarry; for being well backed,
the Execution is in a manner secured.</P>
<P>The first thing of Moment he went
upon, was the planting a Collony in
the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or in <HI>North-America;</HI> not
that Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did not know that the
Planting the <HI>Louisiania;</HI> or the Country
on the River <HI>Missisippi,</HI> would not pro∣duce
any great Effects, at least in his
time; for the Settling a Collony, how∣ever
prosperous in its begining is a Work
of time, and must take up not many
Years only, but ages of Years; and
that the utmost he could have before
him in such an Undertaking, was to die
in the Faith of its success, and to have
the Satisfaction of having his Name
very much talked of when he was
Dead.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> like a Man of just Reach
and Penetration, knew that two things
would be absolutely necessary to his
Design, I. To have the King approve
and Embark in his designs, and, 2. To
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
make his Scheme Popular, to have
something in View that should look
Capital; have a view and prospect of
Success, beyond, not only what he
could manage, but even beyond what
he ever intended in the Proposal.</P>
<P>Having started the Project of Missis∣sippi,
he branch'd it out in a Different
manner from all Projects; for he did
not descend from the <HI>Mississippi</HI> Scheme
as the General, to the subsequent things
as the Particulars; but he ascended from
the <HI>Mississippi</HI> Scheme as a Particular, to
a <HI>West-India</HI> Company as the General;
and a General it was, fruitful of many
Particulars, every one in themselves,
capable of as great things, and perhaps
greater than the Planting the Colonies
of <HI>Mississippi</HI> was in it self.</P>
<P>When the Company was thus for∣med,
his next work was to propose the
Foundation on which they were to be
Establish'd, and this was a Subscription
of Stock; and here he shewed his first
Masterly Stroke, and that he had Con∣certed
all the steps and measures of his
Management from the beginning: The
Publick Credit in <HI>France</HI> was still low,
nor did the Rising Credit of the Royal
Bank add any thing to it, but rather
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
diminish'd, it and let the World see that
private Credit in <HI>France</HI> might revive,
but publick Credit could not: The
State Bills, and Credits, Annuities on
the Town-house, Loans, and all the
publick Papers which the Government
had Drawn the People in to part with
their Money to purchase, were at this
time exceeding low, namely from 57,
to 63 <HI>per Cent.</HI> loss, and like to be more;
it was the easSiest thing in the World
to Establish a Fund for any New Under∣taking
that was but tollerablypromising,
where the Subscribers could be allow'd
to subscribe these Dying Credits at a
PAR, and put that into Stock at 100
Livres, which Cost the Purchaser but
37 to 40 Livres <HI>per Cent.</HI> And this thing
alone fill'd his Subscription, which at
first consisted of 100 Millions, and was
very quickly full.</P>
<P>The first Bite Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> may be said
to put upon the Country was, to give
out by way of <HI>premio,</HI> Ten Thousand
Piftoles, or thereabouts, at the Rate of
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>per Cent.</HI> for the Refusing of the <HI>Missis∣sippi,</HI>
or <HI>West-India</HI> Stock, now subscrib'd
and full, at 100 Livres each Action for a
Years time: This was what we call, <HI>The
baying of the Bear-skin;</HI> and was a dear
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Bear skin to those that sold it, as we
shall hear presently.</P>
<P>This was the time they begun to
banter Mr. <HI>Laws:</HI> Some said he was
Mad, and knew not what to do with
his Money; others Laugh'd at him,
and said, He was not in <HI>England,</HI> where
he could hedge one way to day, and
another way to morrow; could give in
the morning and take in the afternoon;
And thus they took the Money greedi∣ly,
not Considering what might be hid
under the management of a Man whose
Talent they had not yet tryed.</P>
<P>I purposely pass over here the many
Movements which Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> made in
this part, to secure to himself the Ad∣vance
he should get by the Rise of his
Stock; for he who had the Power of
adding Credit to his Project whenever
he pleas'd, had nothing to do but to
make sure of the Profits of the first
Rise to himself; and therefore he took
Care to give out his whole Sum, as I
have heard, of 10000 Pistoles, before
he set his other Wheels at work. And
after this let us see how he went on:</P>
<P>He had now a Bank of Currant Cash
Establish'd on one hand; this he has
kept free and unconcern'd in all Adven∣tures
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
or Projects, as what might one way
or other shake their Credit; but he kept
them perfectly unincumbred, always
able to answer all Demands upon them,
and to resist every shock that might be
made upon them, by the force of their
ready Money in specie; none of which
he would suffer to be Diminished, ex∣cept
by Loans on sufficient Securities.
And I shall give presently an Account
how this method was their real Securi∣ty,
and how they had been overthrown
at once, by the Chicannry of their and
his Enemies if this Course had not been
taken; of which by and by.</P>
<P>He had on the other hand a Sub∣scription
of Adventurers, as they might
truly be call'd; and as the nature of the
thing indeed Imported, whose Stock
did not cost them much, being bought
as above; with what Cost them not a∣bove,
37 to 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and even was
not indeed very Currant at that Price
neither: These therefore were fit to run
any reasonable risque, to embark in any
probable Undertaking; to advance the
Credit of that Undertaking; and, if
possible, to raise their Imaginary Stock,
for it was no more at first, to a Real
Stock of 100 Livres in Value, for 100
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
Livres Subscription; and the way how
to do this, therefore was the next pro∣per
business of the Company to Consider.</P>
<P>The first thing to be Enquir'd was,
to find out something to do, something
to Trade in, for as to Planting in
<HI>Messissippi,</HI> tho' that was to be kept going
on, as the Denominating Business of
the whole; yet it was plain, that Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> never Design'd a Hundred Millions
of Livres should be Employ'd in People∣ing
a Wilderness: He therefore turns
back to the King, from whom he Re∣ceived
the Life of the whole, and by
whose Authority and Business all the
Wheels were to be set to Work.</P>
<P>The Publick was a large Field, were
one Man has no Credit, and another
great Credit; 'tis easy to see who of
the two should be the gainer by the
other: He that has no Credit can do no∣thing
without Money, he that has
Credit wants no Money tho' he has
none.</P>
<P>A Government sunk into Debt, and
her Securities bought at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Discount, gives Room for vast Advan∣tages,
where the Party has Money to
work with; in a Word the Business
was to buy Low, and then bring up
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
the Price of what was bought; namely
to buy at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cost, and then
fell at a PAR, as we now see is since
done.</P>
<P>The King, I say, was their first Mer∣chant
they had to deal with, and these
were the Goods he had to sell (<HI>viz.</HI>)
State Bills of Several Kinds, Annuities,
Interests on Loans, Rents of the Town-House,
and the like; and here I must ob∣serve,
that the performing this Wonder
I'am now to speak of, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of Restoring
the publick Credit, so as to bring a Sum
so monstrously great as Fifteen Hundred
Millions, and sunk so very low as from
60 to 65 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Discount, to be Sale∣able
at a PAR; nay to 10, 20, and 30
<HI>per Cent.</HI> advance, for that they would
have been at, but Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> himself
Checkt it; I say the Entertaining a
thought that such a Scheme was practi∣cable,
and laying a Scheme to do it, was
as great a Testimony of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
Genius and Capacity, as the Performance
has been of his good Fortune.</P>
<P>It was a Sea, so full of dangerous Shoals,
and Rocks, so subject to sudden Storms
and Hurricanes, in a Word, so threat∣ning
of certain Shipwreck; that no
Pilot but this alone, would ever have
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
ventured to have Launched out in
it.</P>
<P>But we must cease the Wondering,
and go back beyond Wonder it self,
Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> had begun well, the Bank
was Establish'd, and began to gain upon
the World; the Credit of it, as I have
already observ'd, appear'd openly, and
seem'd to be Invulnerable; it was foun∣ded
upon a Substantial basis, nay, indeed
the only basis that could support Publick
Credit, (<HI>viz.</HI>) it always had the Money
in Specie and in its own keeping, suffici∣ent
to answer all Demands; upon this
almost any thing might be under∣taken.</P>
<P>But
here I must not only give another
instance of the masterly Genius of
Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> the Contriver of all these
things, but must let the World see, that
as no Design however good in it self,
and adapted for the general good of
our Country, can be without Enemies,
Envy constantly opposing itself to the
best Designs; so it was here; this Bank
had a Formidable attack made upon it
by a set of Merchants in <HI>Paris;</HI> some
said they were <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> o∣thers
that they were <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants
Dwelling in <HI>Paris,</HI> and others, that
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
they were <HI>French;</HI> be that as it will,
possibly they might be some of all the
three sorts, for it could not be done by
a few: The Sum they appeared with,
being no less than Twenty five Millions.
The Plot in a few Words was to muster
up a large Number of Bills, to be
Demanded altogether, and if possible
to give a Blow to the Credit; in a Word,
and to Express it in our Terms, to make
a Run upon the Bank. The Particulars
of the Story are related thus.</P>
<Q><P>It was a little after the first advance
of the Credit of the Royal Bank at
<HI>Paris,</HI> of which Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> was the
principal Director, as he really was
the Father and Author of it; some
Merchants in <HI>Paris</HI> (it was reported
to be a Plot Originally laid at <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI>
or more properly in <HI>Holland</HI>)
whether it was so or not we do not
affirm, but this is certain, that they
were chiefly <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants who
appeared in it at <HI>Paris;</HI> we say, some
Merchants at <HI>Paris</HI> having some time
before Concerted their Measures to
give a blow to the Bank, Treasured
up a number of Bank Bills, to the
Sum of Twenty five Millions as some
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
say, others Twenty two Millions of
Livres, and appear altogether, tho' in
several forms, as of separate Persons
and Interest, at the Bank, just at the
same Hour, to Demand the Money
for those Bills.</P>
<P>The Clarks at the Bank Surpriz'd
with the appearance of so many
Eminent Merchants, and with such
great Demands, answer'd, that they
should be paid, but desir'd them to
wait a little till they could send to
Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> the Director, that they
might have his orders how to pro∣ceed
in paying them; accordingly
they immediately acquainted Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> with the thing, he paus'd a
while at the thing, and without any
Supprize, after a little Consideration,
bid them go back and tell the Mer∣chants
they should all be paid, and
bid the Clarks begin the payment,
and to pay them all in <HI>Lowes d'or's</HI> or
<HI>Pistoles,</HI> and that he would come Im∣mediately
to the Office, which he
did, having first been to tell the
Regent his Scheme, and had the
assistance of the Royal Treasury, and
of the General Farmers, for about
One hundred fifty thousand Pistoles
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
in Specie, if he had wanted them,
which however he did not.</P>
<P> Accordingly the Clarks begun the
payment, and it held till the next
day afternoon; by which time, as
we have the Story, an Edict was
procured and actually made Publick
to reduce the Lowis d'or's from 16 to
15 Livres, which loss fell instantly
upon the Merchants, while they had
above a Million and a quarter of
Pistoles in their Hands in Specie, and
the Bank having stood its Ground,
had most of those Pistoles in their
Csh again in a few Days.</P></Q>
<P>This was a home Thrust at the Bank,
but as it was Parry'd with so much
Art, and the Loss of it turn'd upon
the Contrivers, it Establish'd the very
Foundation which it was form'd to
shake, and gave such a Credit, not only
to the Bank, but to Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> the prin∣cipal
Manager and Director in that
Exigence, that it secured them both
from any future attempts of that na∣ture;
it also let the World see, that
not only they were strong in the sub∣stance
of their Cash, and able to an∣swer
all Demands, and not only that
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
they had a superior Genius at the head
of their management, which was al∣ways
able to Counter-act their Projects,
but that they had the Government hard
and fast to support them upon all Oc∣casions;
and this indeed was such a
Foundation, that when the <HI>Mississipi</HI> or
<HI>West-India</HI> Company was first formed, it
was apparent, that tho' there was little
or nothing in the thing itself, yet there
were other Engraftments to be made
upon it by the Government, that it could
not miss of Success; and that in a Word,
that <HI>Mississipi</HI> was only the Name, but
that the Thing was intended to be a
Fund of Credit, upon which the sink∣ing
Fortunes of the Government were
to rise again.</P>
<P>The first thing we found gave life to
the Company was the Coinage, the
next was the Farm of Tobacco, either
of these were Things of a magnitude
sufficient to have given Credit to any
new Fund; but seem'd to be but Tri∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es
in the hand of the Company, who
apparently aim'd at the General Ma∣nagement
of the Revenues of <HI>France:</HI>
However, as the undertaking of the
Coinage was a vast thing in its Nature,
so the manner of the Contract, the Pru∣dence
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
with which the Company engag'd
in it, the visible Advantage which the
Company would make by it, and above
all the Advance which they were to
make to the King for it, were such
Great things that it startled the World,
and they began to talk of the <HI>West-India</HI>
Company, as of an Opulent Powerful
Body, that being Headed by an Enter∣prising
Man, who apparently had un∣dertaken
what never Man before him
undertook, and perfectly understood
what he had undertaken, had more in
it than was at first imagin'd, and
would arrive to some greater hight than
had been thought possible.</P>
<P>Upon these Thoughts, and the Re∣putation
of the Company's underta∣king
beginning to be Popular, every
body enquired into it, and the farther
they look'd into it, the better they be∣gan
to like it; and this set People first
upon buying the Stock, and the Num∣ber
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yers, by the meer nature
of the thing, would rise the Value.</P>
<P>Now it appear'd every day more
and more, that Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> had lay'd his
Measures right when he gave away his
Pistoles, as I have said above, to have
the refusal of the Stock at 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
for on a sudden the Stock jumpt up to
PAR, and in three or four days more to
150. Had Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> stay'd the full time,
and not Demanded the Stock till it was
Advanc'd as we now see it risen, he
must in all probability have lost the
Advantage he had due to him, seeing
very few of the Persons he had Con∣tracted
with would have been able to
make good a difference of a Stock risen
from under a Hundred to a Thousand:
But as he shew'd his Moderation in De∣manding
the Stock, within the advance
of about 200 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Persons who
lost that Money to him, were soon
made amends if they had any Stock,
by finding it still rising upon their
hands to a prodigious degree in a few
days.</P>
<P>We must take the liberty to make a
Digression here, to the Volatile Tem∣per
of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, whose levity
only can account for what we are now
to take notice of, and the warmth of
the <HI>French</HI> Temper must indeed be an∣swerable
for the running up an Imagi∣nary
Stock; for except about 37 or 40
Livres, upon a 100 in the first Sub∣scription,
it was no other to such a sud∣den
and such an unaccountable extra∣vagant
hight.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="35"/>
This warmth of the <HI>French</HI> Temper,
which prompts them to push things up
to the Extremity, was certainly the Rea∣son,
I mean the Original Reason of the
sudden Advance of these things, for as
yet there was no weight in the things
themselves, that could bear any pro∣portion
to the New Credit they as∣sum'd;
The Company had indeed en∣gag'd
with the Government, and had
taken the Coinage of the King, as
above, and in Nine years it was calcu∣lated
they would get near Fifty Milli∣ons
by their Contract, provided also
the Government kept their Word with
them, and made no new alterations in
the Coin to their Detriment: But even
this, in an Arbitrary Administration,
such as that of <HI>France</HI> is known to be,
was not so certain, but that the Risque
of it was worth something to Ensure;
and all the Doubt that could be justly
rais'd on that Head, pleaded in abate∣ment
to the Credit of the Company.</P>
<P>It must therefore, I say, be placed
to the account of the sluttering, rash
Disposition of the People of <HI>France,</HI>
that a thing who had yet no farther or
greater prospect than that of the Coin∣age,
should in a few days mount up its
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
Credit to near 200 <HI>per Cent,</HI> upon the
Value.</P>
<P>But as we are immediately to see
things more prodigious than this, let us
Discharge our selves of this Particular
first, that we may clear things as they
go; The Arret for Granting to the
Company the Coinage, as above, will
fully describe the Circumstances of
their Contract, and the View of Ad∣vantages
they had by it; and there∣fore
I cannot go on, till I have given it
at large, as follows:</P>

<HEAD>Extract of the Registers of the Council

<P>THE King having by his Let∣ters
Patents of the Month of
<HI>August,</HI> 1717, established a Trading
Company under the Name of the
<HI>West</HI> Company, and by his Edict in
<HI>May</HI> last reunited to the said Com∣pany
the Trade of the <HI>East-India,
China, &amp;c.</HI> his Majesty sees with Sa∣tisfaction,
that that Company takes
the best Measures for securing the
Success of its Establishment; that
they send a great Number of Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
to the Country of <HI>Louisiana,</HI>
which was granted them; that many
private Persons make Settlements in
that Colony, and send thither Hus∣bandmen.
Tillers, and other Handi∣craft-men,
to manure and improve
the Land, sow Corn, plant Tobacco,
breed Silk-worms, and do whatever
is necessary to improve that Country.
Furthermore, his Majesty being in∣formed
that the <HI>India</HI> Company is
at great Charges for transporting the
said Inhabitants, and furnishing the
Colony with Meal and other Necessa∣ries
till the Land afford a sufficient
Quantity of Provision for their Sub∣sistance:
That the said Company
sends thither all sorts of Goods and
Merchandize to render the Life of
the Inhabitants more comfortable,
and that for preventing Abuses too
frequent in Colonies, they have taken
Care to settle the Price thereof at a
moderate Rate by a general Tariff,
which they have sent thither to be
affixed in their Store-houses and Ma∣gazines;
that they have ordered the
Biasters or Pieces of Eight to be re∣ceiv'd
by their Officers on the foot of
five Livres, and the other Silver Bul∣lion
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>
in Proportion, which Disposi∣tions
have appeared so wise and ne∣cessary,
that his Majesty has resolved
to favour the Execution thereof, and
knowing that the exchanging of
Goods not being sufficient to carry on
Commerce to its full Extent, and that
it is necessary in the begining of
Establishments of this Nature, to
give them all possible Protection and
Countenance, his Majesty has resolv'd
to supply the said Company with a
Sum of Bank Bills, to enable the
Inhabitants of <HI>Louisiana</HI> to Trade
amongst themselves, and bring into
<HI>France</HI> the Fruits of their Labour,
Oeconomy and Industry, without
any Risque or Charge: And his Ma∣jesty
being willing to indemnify the
said Company, for the Price of the
Pieces of Eight in the <HI>Louisina,</HI> and
for the Expences they are at for the
Establishment and Support of that
Colony, he has thought fit to order
all the Pieces of Eight and other Bul∣lion
that shall be imported by the said
Company from the <HI>Louisiana,</HI> to be
received at his Mints at their full
Value. Therefore his Majesty being
in the Council, with the Advice of
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Re∣gent,
has ordered, and Orders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P> The Articles of this Arrest are to
the following effect: 1. That the
Treasurer of the Bank shall deliver
to the <HI>India</HI> Company the Sum of
Twenty five Millions of Livres in
Bank Bills, taking a Receipt of the
Cashier of the said Company, to be
sent to the <HI>Louisiana.</HI> 2. That in
order that the said Bills be distinguish∣ed
from others, the Numbers shall
be kept by the Treasurer of the Bank,
and the said Bills shall be sealed with
the Seal of the <HI>India</HI> Company, in∣stead
of the Seal of the Bank. 3.
That the said Bills being returned to
<HI>France,</HI> shall be paid as well as other
Bank Bills, by the Receivers of the
King's Revenues, and afterwards ac∣quitted
by the Cashier of the Com∣pany,
and by him brought to the
Treasurer of the Bank, who shall
deliver them new Bank Bills to be
sent to the <HI>Louisiana,</HI> to the Value of
the others. 4. The Owners of the
said Bills must take the precaution to
indorse them, that they may not be
paid to any other but such who are to
receive the Payment thereof; but in
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>
case they are lost by Shipwreck, or
stoln, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the owner upon making a
Declaration thereof to the Cashier of
the Company, who is to enter the
Number of the Bills lost, or supposed
to be lost, shall receive the Value
thereof at the Expiration of five Years,
according to the Declaration of the
4th of <HI>December,</HI> 1718. 5. And in
order to indemnify the said Company
for the Charges they are at for set∣tling
the Plantations in <HI>Louisiana,</HI> and
for the Prices they give for the Pieces
of Eight, his Majesty orders that the
said Pieces of Eight brought from
those Plantations be receiv'd at his
Mint at the rate of Sixty Livres <HI>per</HI>
Mark, and in case of Alteration in
the Price of the Coyn of the King∣dom,
the Value of the said Pieces of
Eight shall be paid Weight for
Weight in the Species that shall be
coyned or reformed. without any
Diminution for the Charges thereof;
and thereof as to the other Bullion,
the same shall be receiv'd and paid at
the Mint at the same Price as the
Pieces of Eight, upon producing a
Certificate from the General Direc∣tors
of the said Company, that the
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>
said Pieces of Eight and other Bullion
were shipped off in the Country of
<HI>Louisiana,</HI> and belong to the said

<HEAD>Abstract of the Registers of the Council of
State.</HEAD>
<P>THE King having ordered in
Council his Edict in <HI>May,</HI>
1718. whereby new Species of Gold
and Silver are ordered to be made,
to be laid before him, and his Ma∣jesty
being informed, that besides the
good effects the Coyning thereof has
produc'd, other considerable Advan∣tages
may be expected from the par∣ticular
Attention to be given to its
Continuation. Among the several
Proposals that have been made to
him on this Matter, none has appear∣ed
more Advantagious than the Pro∣position
of the Directors of the <HI>India</HI>
Company, who offer to pay to his
Majesty Fifty Millions of Livres in
Specie, in Fifteen equal successive
Payments from Month to Month,
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>
the first beginning on the first of
<HI>October</HI> next and the last the first of
<HI>December,</HI> 1720. upon Condition that
the said Company shall enjoy for
Nine years together, to begin from
the first of <HI>August</HI> next the Benefit
and Advantage arising from the old
Species and Bullion that shall be
brought to the King's Mints to be
coyn'd into new Species. His Majesty
is so much the more inclined to ac∣cept
the Proposals of the said Com∣pany,
because they may better and
more and conveniently than private
Men import Species and Bullion
out of Foreign Countries, and that
consequently they may get a greater
Advantage thereby than his Majesty
could get if the Coinage of the new
Species was continued upon his own
Account; and furthermore consider∣ing
that the Profit that will arise out
of the same will be divided between
great numbers of his Majesty's Sub∣jects,
concerned in the said Compa∣ny,
and that a Supply so certain and
ready will enable his Majesty to pay
the Arrears of Pensions and other
Expences, His Majesty, with the
Advice of Monsieur the Duke of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>
Regent, has ordained, and or∣dains
as follows:</P>
<P>This Arrest contains four Articles,
which are to this effect: 1. His Ma∣jesty
accepts the offer made by the
<HI>India</HI> Company of the Sum of Fifty
Millions of Livres, to be paid in
Fifteen successive Months, to begin
from the first of <HI>October</HI> next, at the
rate of 3, 333, 333 Livres, 6 Pence,
8 Deniers <HI>per</HI> Month, and orders that
the same be brought to his Royal
Treasury, and that the Receipt given
by the Keeper thereof be a sufficient
Discharge to the said Company, with∣out
being accountable to the Cham∣ber
of Accounts. 2. Besides the said
Sum of Fifty Millions, the Company
is to be at all the charges of the
Coinage, Remittance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such as
the King does actually pay. 3. Up.
on these Conditions, the King grants
to the said Company all the Profits
and Advantages that shall accrue
from the Coining into new Species of
Gold and Silver in his Mints, the old
Species of <HI>France,</HI> the Species of Fo∣reign
Countries, and Bullion that
shall be imported, what Sum soever
they may amount to, on the foot
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>
and manner regulated by the Edict of
<HI>May,</HI> 1718, for Nine Years together,
to begin from the first of <HI>August</HI> next.
4. His Majesty declares, that during
the said Nine Years, he will not make
any Augmentation in the Price of the
Species, nor lessen the Standard of
his Coin upon any Pretence whatso∣ever,
and that in case of any Diminu∣tion,
he will lower the Bullion and
old Species proportionably. Done in
the Council of State, <HI>July</HI> 25. 1719.</P>

<P>It was some Weeks that the Credit
of the Company fed upon this Under∣taking,
and Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> who prudently
gave every thing time to Work, let it
run on some time, upon this view only.
till the People began to talk a little du∣bious
about it; That it was true, the
Company would get Money by the
Coinage, but it must be in a length of
time; and that this was not so consider∣able,
that the Stock should mount up
to such a hight upon that Advantage
only.</P>
<P>When these things began to be the
subject of Discourse, Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> began to
think of playing another Mine; for I am
to suppose all along this Gentleman to
<PB N="48" REF="45"/>
have built his whole fabrick in his Ima∣gination
at once, and to have Digested
every part even from the beginning in
his Thoughts, but resolved to bring
every thing about by just degrees, and
to give every thing that he started into
the World its full scope, to extend it
self to the utmost.</P>
<P>On a sudden then, for all his Mo∣tions
were like Mines, sprung from
beneath, not the least Notice being
given of any thing till it burst out like
a sudden Fire, I say, on a sudden he
Declares at his Levee, which now be∣gan
to be as Great as that of a Publick
Minister, That the King had United
the <HI>East-India</HI> Company to that of <HI>Mis∣sissippi</HI>
or the <HI>West-India,</HI> and immedi∣ately
after, that is to say, the next
morning an Arret of the King's Coun∣cil
appear'd, by which the two Com
panies were United, and the Stock of
the <HI>East-India</HI> Company Ingrafted into
the other Company, as by the Arret it
self is best explain'd, and which has in
it several Clauses infinitely to the Ad∣vantage
of the Company, in Trade as
well as in Credit, tho' even in this Con∣junction,
and all the Advantages of a
Commerce to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> encreased
<PB N="49" REF="46"/>
as they might be able to encrease it,
were in themselves but remote things,
and could produce no great things for
some Years to come, and therefore
could not be an addition of an Intrin∣sick
worth, on which to raise such an
immense inexpressible fund of Credit
as immediately appear'd: But let us
go on gradually, and first look into the
Arret it self, that we may the better
judge of what it is the Company en∣joy,
and what they ought to be valued
at upon that particular Account. The
Arret is as follows:</P>

<P>UPON the Representation made
to the King in Council by
Directors of the <HI>India</HI> Company in
Name of the said Company; That if
the King was pleased to vacate and
make void the Lease or Contract of
the General Farms made in favour of
<HI>Aymart Lambert</HI> for fix Years, which
begun on the first of <HI>October</HI> 1718.
and of which the first Year will ex∣pire

of such Person as they shall think
fit, under the Security of the Com∣pany
for the remaining five Years of
the Lease aforesaid: And to grant to
the said Company four other Years,
which will make a Lease of Nine
Years, to begin from the first of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI>
next, and end on the first of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI>
1728, with Power to the said
Company to continue or vacate the
Leases made by the said <HI>Lambert,</HI> as
they shall think fit, the said Com∣pany
will give over and above what
was given by the said <HI>Lambert,</HI> three
Millions five hundred thousand Livres
for every Year during the said Term
of Nine Years, insomuch that instead
of Forty eight Millions five hundred
thousand Livres, the said <HI>Lambert</HI>
paid every Year for the said General
Farms, the said Company will pay
Yearly Fifty two Millions, and besides
will perform all the Clauses and Con∣ditions
contain'd in the Lease granted
to the said <HI>Lambert:</HI> That the better
to shew to his Majesty the desire of
the said <HI>India</HI> Company, to contri∣bute
by their Credit to the Ease of
the State, they offer to lend to the
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>
King Twelve hundred Millions of Liv∣res
at the Yearly Interest of three <HI>per

and redeeming the perpetual
Rents or Annuities, and other Debts
assigned on the Aids and Gabells, the
Tailles, the General Receipts of the

Bills of the Common Cash, and the

suppressed or to be suppressed,
which are not, or shall not be assigned
upon any one Fund in particular:
That in order to enable the said Com∣pany
to advance the said Twelve
hundred Millions of Livres, his Ma∣jesty
is desired to authorize and im∣power
the said Company to borrow
Twelve hundred Millions of Livres,
for which they will deliver out Shares
of Rents to the Bearer, to be paid by
the said Company, or Contracts of
Annuities or Rents at the yearly In∣terest

</TEXT></Q>
<P>It is not to be express'd with what
surprise, and even astonishment the
World look'd on at these steps of Mr.
<HI>Laws,</HI> his Fame for an Enterprizing
Man was now Establish'd, and those
who had before run pretty much upon
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>
his Crdit, and talk'd to his prejudice
among the common People, began to
say now he was <HI>Ʋne habile homme,</HI> and
that he was capable of great things;
for the noise of this new <HI>East-India</HI>
Company spread like a Clap of Thun∣der
far and wide, and People began to
see a new world of Profit attending it,
the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade being carried on in
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> and in <HI>Holland</HI> to such a
magnitude and to so much advantage,
as we all know it to be done.</P>
<P>All this while the on looking World
regarded in their Calculations nothing
but the Profits of Trade, and the Ad∣vantages
the Company might make by
great Returns, having a Capital Stock,
and a good Oeconomy in their Affairs,
keeping their eyes upon the Number of
Ships to be sent annually to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
the Extent of their Colonies
and Plantations in the <HI>Louisiana</HI> and on
the Banks of the <HI>Mississ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ppi,</HI> what Rents
in time shall accrue to the Stock, and
what Annual Incoms the Company
would receive, whereby they would
be enabled to make Dividends propot∣tion'd
to 250 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Sub∣scriptions
as they were then advanc'd,
not imagining what was yet behind.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="52"/>
But Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> whose Views lay
another way, regarded all these things,
only as they tended to raise Fund of
Credit at home, which was from the
beginning the Point he aim'd at, lea∣ving
all other things to work their own
way; not but the remotest Prospects
concurr'd to answer the same End,
and a Complication of Advantages
however remote, serv'd to bring about
the great Point, <HI>viz.</HI> The making the
Credit of the whole to rise beyond ima∣gination,
and sufficient to answer all
the great Things he had still in View.</P>
<P>The Stock was now risen to an ex∣cessive
hight, from 325 to 350 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> and now was the Time for Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> to let the world see what a Fund
of Credit is able to do, and to make
good the undoubted Maxim, That <HI>a
Fund of Credit, is a Fund of Money,</HI>
and able to make it self equal to all
the Money in the World; for now was
the time to strike the blow, that <HI>Coup
d'Eclat,</HI> which should surprize and asto∣nish
the World, and which will for
ever be spoken of as an Action, that
the World never heard of the like be∣fore.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="53"/>
Nor did Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> bring it out all at
once, but suffer'd it to be discours'd of
gradually, That the Company was
about to take upon them the manage∣ment
of the King's Revenue; in a few
days after, for Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> never suffer'd
the Town to be Master of his Mea∣sures
before they were ripe, but it had
not been long spoken of that the Com∣pany
would take upon them the ma∣nagement
of the Revenue, when at
once, just as before, and Arrest was pub∣lished,
Dissolving the Leases of the
General Farmers of the Revennue, tho'
their Leases had five Years to run, and
vesting the whole Collection in the new
<HI>East-Indsa</HI> Company.</P>
<P>As an Inducement to this, the Com∣pany
undertake to encrease the pay∣ment
to the King, no less than four
Millions a Year, a Sum too Considera∣ble
not to be Vallued: But at the end
of this comes a Clause, which none
but such a Man as Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> could have
ventur'd upon, a thing Posterity will
look back upon as a Romance, and
which no History can give any thing
like it, namely, the paying the King's
Debts, that is to say, the Company to
take upon them at once the Discharging
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>
all the King's Debts upon whatsoever
Doubtful Funds, upon whatever pre∣carious
Circumstances they stood, what∣ever
Discounts they were at, all are to
be transferr'd at once from the Royal
Treasury, where they would never
have been able to Discharge them, to
the Treasury of the Company where
they are to be paid at Demand.</P>
<P>Two things make this Undertaking
a Prodigy of Management, the like
of which was never heard of before:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The King's Debts amounted to
about Fifteen Hundred Mil∣lions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Company had not any
Fund of Money, or the Value of
Money to pay them with.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But before I go on, I must go back
to the Arrests or Proclamations, Di∣recting
the Execution of this unparal∣lel'd
Contract, which by mistake is al∣ready
placed <HI>Page</HI> 49. but should have
come in here.</P>
<P>Here is such a blow struck, as the
World never heard of before; and in
this very stroke we may behold the
Power of Credit, and what immense
<PB N="58" REF="55"/>
Structures <HI>may be built,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Laws
has built</HI> upon this single foundation,
by which he has restor'd a Govern∣ment
overwhelm'd with Debt and
which was turn'd Bankrupt to the Peo∣ple,
and has deliver'd a Nation op∣press'd
with Taxes, in such a manner,
and in so short a time, that Posterity
will never believe the relation, but will
all look like a Fable or Romance in
their Eyes.</P>
<P>The Arret or Act of the King's Coun∣cil
above mention'd, for the settling
this Point, tells us expresly what the
Company are to do, and expresses the
Sum which they are to lend the King
for the doing it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they
should lend the King Twelve Hundred
Millions of Livres at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and
afterwards they added three Millions
more, for the paying off all the pub∣lick
Debts, and strictly ties them down
to so punctual a Discharge of those
Debts, and of all the Sallaries of the
Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it shall be wholly in
the choice of the Persons who are to be
paid, whether they will accept of the
Company's Bonds, or have their Rea∣dy
Money paid them. But the Arrets
do not at all meddle with the Method
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>
by which the Company shall raise such
an Infinite mass of Money to pay, but
supposes the Money shall all be actually
ready in Cash, in Specie to pay, only
gives the Company Power to Borrow
such a Sum, that is to say, if any one
will lend it; for they do not oblige any
one to Lend, much less to accept the
Company's Security for the Debt; for
that would but have been exchanging
the Government for the Company, and
leaving the Debt still in being.</P>
<P>Nor on the other hand was here the
least Consideration to the Company
for so great an Advantage to the Go∣vernment,
as that of clearing them at
once of all the publick Debts; had the
Company reserv'd but the small ad∣vantage
of One <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Interest
as they were empowered to Borrow,
the 1200 Millions at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> had the
Government paid 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which
had been just 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Gain, there
had been then some visible Profit,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) there had been Twelve Milli∣ons
<HI>per Annum</HI> in the Company's Poc∣ket,
to have enabled them, or help'd
at least, to make some proportion'd
Dividends to the monstrous advance of
their Stock.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="57"/>
But the whole Scene may be one con∣tinued
Prodigy, they seek no Advan∣tage,
they Demand no more than
Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> and propose to Borrow,
if they want it, at Three <HI>per Cent.</HI>
acting in every part of it upon the
foundation of Publick Service, with∣out
Gain to themselves.</P>
<P>But neither is this all, for we shall
presently see them not only take no
Surplus of Interest, no Gain of Interest
more than they pay; But we shall see
the Credit rising to an immense hight,
and the Company growing Powerful by
the Assistance of the Government, and
the management of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> their
Director: I say, we shall see the fol∣lowing
Mysteries, or, indeed, Mira∣cles,
wrought in the compass of a few
Weeks, Things as incredible as the
greatest Impossibility in Nature could
be thought to be; things which now
they are done they are as a Dream
even to those that see them; even the
People who have the Money in their
hands, and who has receiv'd their an∣tient
Debts, fo long given over, so ef∣fectually
despair'd of, they look amaz'd,
and Consider again and again, whether
they are awake or asleep, they handle
<PB N="61" REF="58"/>
it, weigh it, and roll it about, as if
they would try whether it is really Gold
or Air; whether there is no Magic, no
Necromancy in it or not; and I am
told of one to whom the Government
ow'd Ten Thousand Crowns, which
he would have been glad to have sold
for Two Thousand five Hundred, be∣ing
an Arrear for Secret Service only,
that caused an Iron Chest to be bought,
and put the Money into it, then drove
Posts into the Ground in his Cellar,
and chain'd the Iron Chest down to
the Stakes, then chain'd it also to the
Wall, and Barricadoed the Doors and
Window of the Cellar with Iron, and
all for fear, not of Thieves to Steal the
Money, but for fear the Money, Chest
and all should fly away into the Air;
For he said he could never believe it
was Money. But to return to the Par∣ticulars,
which I say have been done by
this Company, subsequent to this new
Arret of paying the publick Debts:
We have seen them since that do strange
things indeed!</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. We have seen them bring the
People to refuse payment, or de∣cline
payment of what they
<PB N="62" REF="59"/>
would before have given half the
Debt to be secur'd of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The State Bills that were before
little better than wast Paper,
made worth 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and 20
<HI>per Cent.</HI> above PAR.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. We have seen them Gain Thir∣teen
Hundred and Fifty Millions
of Money in less than a Months
time by selling the Air, and put∣ting
a real Value upon an ima∣ginary
value.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. We have seen the King's Reve∣nue
augmented to Millions a
year, by abating the Taxes to
the People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. We have seen the General Farms
rais'd Four Millions a Year to
the King, and yet twelve
Millions a Year paid less by the
People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. We have seen them Pay Fifteen
Hundred Millions of Debt for
the King, without one Penny of
Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Lastly, We have seen a private
Gentleman raise himself by the
Dexterity of this Management,
to be the greatest Subject in the
World; to have all the Nobili∣ty,
<PB N="63" REF="60"/>
the Princes, the Publick
Ministers, and even the Go∣vernment
it self at his beck, and
above 300 Coaches in a Morning
at his Levee, himself behaving
with all the Modesty and Hu∣mility
imaginable; not Elevated
by his good Fortune, not Hur∣ried
or Discompos'd by the
application to so much business,
but Calm and Cool, always pre∣sent
to himself, answering brief∣ly
and pertinently to every new
Discourse, receiving Six or Se∣ven
Hundred Gentlemen in a
Morning, dispatching every Bu∣siness
with a Readiness inimi∣mitable,
perfectly Compos'd and
Retir'd, and every Day produ∣cing
new Wonders in the great
Affair of the Publick which is
upon his Hands.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I return to the Stock, and the pro∣ceeding
of the Company: As the Advan∣tages
of Publick business thus flow'd in,
the Credit of the Stock necessarily Ad∣vanc'd;
and we were surpriz'd in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to find that every Post the Price
started up whole Hundreds in a Day,
<PB N="64" REF="61"/>
till at length we saw the Stock up at
1150 <HI>per Cent.</HI> 1200, and since that to
2050 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>Now was the Juncture of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
to give the blow he had in View, the
multitude of People who came every
Hour to <HI>Paris,</HI> and run their Money
into the Stock, made his Project not
Rational only but Natural, <HI>(viz.)</HI>
That they might enlarge the Capital
Stock by Engrafting a farther Sub∣scription,
and that the New Subscribers
might have Encouragement to Sub∣scribe,
they should be allowed to Sub∣scribe
at 1000 Livres each, Original
Stock.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Resolution, an Arrest
was published, empowering the Com∣pany
to take new Subscriptions upon
the first Foot of the Stock for 50 Mil∣lions,
the Subcribers paying 10000
Livres each; and that I may explain
it as I go, you are to understand, that
for the Ten Thousand Livres, the Sub-scribers
has Credit in the Companies
Books for one Action or Share, that is
to say, for One Hundred Livres Origi∣nal
Stock.</P>
<P>This being the Case, it is easie to
Calculate what the Company's Gain by
<PB N="65" REF="62"/>
by this new Subscription, but of that
in its Place: In the mean, time it is to
observ'd, that so eager were the People
to throng in their Money into the Stock,
that they were ready to tread one ano∣ther
to death to get to the Books, and
it was the greatest Favour in the
world to be admitted; so that the
Books were not only fill'd up in about
Six Hours, but if there had been room
for Two Hundred Millions, it would
have been fill'd up at the same time.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Subscription de∣clared
full, and no more hands to be
taken, but those who could not get in
their Money, falls to work with those
that had, and buy of them part of
what they had subscrib'd, and this
rais'd the Price so, that the new Stock
rise immediately 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> even the
same day that it was subscrib'd.</P>
<P>As this had been clos'd with so eager∣ly,
and with so much ardour by the
People, Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> who knew very well
how to make his Advantage of the
Temper of the People, obtains a se∣cond
Order for 50 Millions more, and
in a Word had it fill'd with the same
eagerness and forwardness as before,
and after this a third of 50 Millions;
<PB N="66" REF="63"/>
the Arrest of these Subscriptions are
publick in our Papers, and will shew
something of the Proof of what I have
affirm'd, of the forwardness of Sub∣scribers;
they are indeed too long to be
Copied here, neither is it of great use
to us to see the Form, which is only
what is usual in the Publick Acts on like
Occasions.</P>
<P>It is now proper to Examine what
Immense Gain accrues to the Company
by these Subscriptions, as also the Ori∣ginal
Stock as then Advanc'd: I begin
with the Subscriptions, which, as a∣bove,
were taken in at a 1000 Livres
upon each 100 Livres Original Stock.</P>
<P>If then the Subscription was for Fifty
Millions Stock, at 100 Livres each Sub∣scription,
this advanc'd to a 1000 Li∣vres,
each Stock amounts to no less
than 500 Millions of Livres; so that
the Company receiving 1000 Millions
of Livres, for 50 Millions Original
Stock, advance, and are clear Gainers
by the Subscription no less than 450
Millions of Livres, and this doubled
by the second Subscription of 50 Milli∣ons
make the Company's Gain amount
to 900 Millions of Livres, and that to
a third, it makes it 1350 Millions.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="64"/>
Add to this, the first Stock of the
Company was much of it Subscrib'd
by the Government itself, by the King,
by Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> as in the Company's
Name, and being sold since at 1000
and 1100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> has put, as I am
credibly inform'd, above 200 Millions
into their Pockets; besides what Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> is said to have Gain'd for his
private Account.</P>
<P>It will now be no longer a Wonder
how, and with what Coin the Compa∣ny
should undertake to pay off 1500
Millions of Debt, or how they could
begin to pay, as was the Case, Four
Months before the appointed Time,
for here is 1340 Millions Clearly gain'd,
<HI>Tout d'une Coup,</HI> at one blow, to go on
upon the payment with whenever they
pleas'd, besides what was to come;
and no body then doubted but that Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> would set up a third Subscription;
but he found it convenient to stop here
for the present, and not only not to
take a farther Subscription, but to put
that out of doubt, he obtain'd a pub∣lick
Arret declaring, that there should
be no new Subscriptions granted.</P>
<P>But in this new Experiment Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
found himself a little embarrass'd, for
<PB N="68" REF="65"/>
there being such a run for their New
Subscriptions, there were Consequently
no Buyers, or fewer Buyers than be∣fore
for the Old Stock, every one ha∣ving,
as we say in <HI>England,</HI> a Penny
for a new Shop; neither was this all,
but as the new Subscribers paid but 100
Livres down upon their Subscription,
the rest being allow'd to be paid in by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qual payments in Nine Months, 100
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>per</HI> Month, it was with much
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>scrib'd, because they paid, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 100 Livres for an Action,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bought an Old one,
was oblig'd to pay 1000 Livres down,
this carried away the Buyers from the
old Stock; but this likewise was not all,
for those who had a mind to subscribe
to the New Stock, on purpose to Sell
out again, and Jobb them about, sold
out the Old Stock, because for two Old
Actions, for which when sold the Sel∣ler
receiv'd 2000 Livres, he might
with that Money Subscribe, or buy
Subscriptions for 20 Shares or Actions
in the New; and laying down the first
payment, get to <HI>Quinquampoix street,</HI>
the Exchange-Alley of <HI>Paris,</HI> and sel∣ling
them again at 1100 Livres each,
put 2000 Livres in his Pocket, and be
just where he was.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="66"/>
These Things had their Influence
upon the Old Stock, and there being
abundance wanted to Sell, and few to
Buy, the Price fell at once, and indeed
began to fall so Considerably, that
from 1250 it fell to 760, which was a
threatning Article; but Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> gave
a new Life to it all at once, for he per∣ceiving
it, and knowing it would run
too fast for him to stop it if it was not
taken in time, applied an immediate
Remedy to it which could not fail to
answer his end, this was to publish,
and fix it up at the Door of the Bank,
and at other publick places of the City,
That the Company would take in all
the Old Shares that any Man was
willing to part with, at 900 Livres <HI>per</HI>
Share.</P>
<P>This was another Testimony of the
Masterly Genius of Mr. <HI>Laws;</HI> for as
soon as ever this publication was made
the Old Stock mounted again, and Sold
Currently for 1050 and 1030 or there∣about,
no body coming, or but few to
sell them.</P>
<P>Thus he warded off the blow: But
this was one Reason why he durst not
venture to form any additional Sub∣scriptions,
and a good Reason too: But
<PB N="70" REF="67"/>
from this time forward, the Stock is
Grown up to a Prodigy of 2050 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> It is true it has sunk a little on
the approach of the time of Payment
for the first Three Months, which is to
be paid in the first of <HI>January, viz.</HI>
300 Livres <HI>per</HI> Share, and this for want
of Money has sunk the Stock to about
1850; but Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> that never wants
a Remedy for these Diseases, imme∣diately
calls a meeting of the Directors,
and agrees to declare a Dividend of Pro∣fits
to amount to 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the
Stock, which tho' it be a Trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> on the
present advanc'd Price, yet was really
Considerable in it self, and amounts to
a very great Sum, no less than Six Mil∣lions
and upwards: However 'tis agreed
that the Company have really gain'd
near 100 Millions Extraordinary, by
selling her own Subscriptions, and buy∣ing
and selling her own Stock; so that
they may very easily Divide 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
on the 1st Stock, which would have been
1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the present Advance;
but of this hereafter. This is a brief
Account of the prodigious Rise and
Greatness of the <HI>East-India</HI> Stock, and
of its present State and Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="68"/>
It remains to give some account of
its progress, and the steps Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is
taking to establish the Trade which it
has in View; for tho' indeed the Tra∣ding
part has been the least of Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s
design, yet as it is the Denominating
quallity of the Company, and they are
called the <HI>Mississippi</HI> and <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany,
he pushes this part also.</P>
<P>The Proceeding of the <HI>Mississippi</HI>
part, is partly seen in the Arret of the
Council, misplaced by mistake, <HI>Pag.</HI> 31,
and which ought to have been placed
here: Wherein the Bank gives, or ra∣ther
lends the Company 25 Millions in
Bank-Bills, for small Sums to be Cur∣rent
in the Colony of <HI>Louisania</HI> or
<HI>Mississippi,</HI> and partly in the multitude
of People which are every Day all for
Planting sent thither.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, we find
them launching out into a Prodigious
Trade that way, and sending out about
Twenty Ships with Soldiers and vast
Cargoes, to make Settlements, and place
Factories in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and all the
Twenty Ships to come Home Loden
with things proper for the Trade they
are upon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="69"/>
These are great things it must be
confest, but as I have said, these are
not the chief end in View; Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s
aims are at Popularity, and keeping up
the Imaginary part which is raised to
such a degree, as the Profit of Ten
<HI>East-India</HI> Trades could not support,
and which never can be supported with∣out
something that can bring in a Pro∣fit
equal to 3 or 4 <HI>per Cent per Annum,</HI>
upon the 2000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which it stands
advanc'd.</P>
<P>To bring this to pass, we find he does
every thing, and the Government in
his behalf does every thing that can
recommend them to the People, and
particularly acts of Generous Charity,
Publick Spirited Muneficence, taking
off the heavy Taxes upon the ordinary
Necessaries of Life and Convenience, by
which the Poor, who are more Senfible
of those things, are touch'd, and en∣gage
to Bless both the Person and the
Undertaking.</P>
<P>Innumerable Projects are in his Head
for publick good, he has already caused
all the Turnpikes and Tole-bars at the
Entrance into the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI> to be
taken down; an innumerable number
of Collectors and Officers, that teiz'd
<PB N="73" REF="70"/>
the Poor for Money upon every Trifle
that enter the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
missed, the People pay nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Coals or Wood, or Turff to Hay
or Oats, or Straw for Horses, Flesh
or Fish, Herbs or Garden stuff, and
Fruits or Wine to Drink; all things go
free into <HI>Paris,</HI> so that the Families
live a fifth part cheaper than they did
before; the very Duty on Fish, which
is now abolished, brought in to the
King two Millions a Year; but now
as the Rents of the Town-House of
<HI>Paris</HI> are Reimbursed, and they have
no more Annuities to pay, they have
likewise no Taxes to Levy, and all is
made free.</P>
<P>Besides these things, which are the
Consequence of paying the publick
Debts, he has new Projects of so many
kinds, that it would require a large
Book to give an account of them.</P>
<P>He has undertaken a New Canal,
from the River <HI>Loyer</HI> to the <HI>Seine,</HI> to
bring more Water into the latter, by
the River <HI>Loyng,</HI> and answerable to
the Canal <HI>de Briare,</HI> so to bring Vessels
of large Burthens down those Rivers,
and bring Wine and Brandy, and all
bulky Goods quite from <HI>Nants</HI> in <HI>Bre∣taign,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="71"/>
and from the Sea, as well as from
the Inland Country about <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>He has lay'd a Scheme to Reduce the
River <HI>Seine</HI> to a narrower Channel be∣tween
<HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> that so the Chan∣nel
may be Deepen'd and kept Clear,
by which means Ships of good Burthen
shall come up even to <HI>Paris</HI> it self, and
to <HI>Roan,</HI> Ships of 400 Tuns Burthen
shall come freely up to the Town Key.</P>
<P>He has design'd to make <HI>Roan</HI> the
Capital of all <HI>France,</HI> for Commerce,
Navigation and Manufactures, all his
<HI>East-India</HI> and <HI>Mississipi</HI> Tradede shall be
carried on there, and the Magazines,
Warehouses and places for Publick Sales,
shall be fixt and built there; and as the
City of <HI>Roan</HI> itself is not sufficient for
the Number of People that will be
drawn together by these things, and by
the Wollen Manufactures and Silk
Manufactures, which he designs to
settle there, He has projected, as Fame
reports, a New City on the other side
the <HI>Seine</HI> over against <HI>Roan,</HI> and a
Stone Bridge of a most Magnificent
Structure, and which must be prodi∣gious
Strong, the Water there being
very deep and Rapid.</P>

This Tract would be far too short to
give a full Scheme, even of this one
design, a thing of such a Magnitude
as no Private Man ever undertook, or
any Stock less than that of a Prince or
of a Nation accomplished.</P>
<P>But all these things seem to me to be
rather amusements to alarm the World,
and make the Company Famous among
Forreigners, than that they are to be
really Executed.</P>
<P>And they have their end, for Fo∣reigners
are amused, and all the World
seems to be running to <HI>Paris,</HI> the pro∣digious
Sums Strangers lay out in the
Stock, and the Numbers that come to
Negotiate there, has fill'd <HI>Paris</HI> with
Money and with People, and Conse∣quently
with Trade; and they tell us
there is nothing to be seen but New
Coaches, New Equipages, New Live∣ries,
and buying New Furniture; in∣numerable
Families having been En∣rich'd
by this surprizing advance of
Stock; in a word, they write from
thence, that there are 1200 New
Coaches set up in <HI>Paris,</HI> and half a
Million of People come to the City more
than was there before, so that no Lodg∣ings
are to be had; and they Build New

<P>When I begun this Work, it was
not possible to imagine, but I might
have given some account of the Ebb,
as I have of the Flood of this <HI>Phantosme,</HI>
for I can call it yet no more; its fate
without question must come ere long,
since there is no Foundation equal to
the Structure that now stands upon it.</P>
<P>But the time is not yet, the little de∣crease,
or fall which happened a few
days ago, is not of the kind of that
which must blow up the Machine; but
it stop'd as above, by the appearance
of an approaching Dividend of Profits;
But this cannot support it long, it must
fall at last, and all I can say of it at pre∣sent
can be only this, that when it comes
<HI>Great will be the fall of it.</HI></P>
