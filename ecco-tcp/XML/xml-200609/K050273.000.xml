<HEAD>THE
CASE of the War in <HI>ITALY</HI>
STATED: <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Eyes of <HI>Europe</HI> seem at
this time to be turn'd wholly
upon the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s New
Undertaking against the Em∣peror.
The Reasons of his
making this Attempt, his Catholick Maje∣sty
has published by his Ministers, and the
Memorials, or Letters, which they have
given in to the several Courts of the Princes
where they reside, fully express the Preten∣sion
of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Reasons
why he takes this Occasion to break with
the Emperor.</P>
<P>These Memorials, or Letters, are first,
The Letter of Seignior <HI>Grimaldi,</HI> Secretary
of State to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> directed to
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadors, or Residents at
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Foreign Courts; Secondly, The Memorial
of the Marquis <HI>Beretti Landi,</HI> Minister for
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to the States General,
and the Memorial of the Prince <HI>de Cellamere</HI>
at <HI>Paris,</HI> to the Regent of <HI>France,</HI> all on the
same Subject, and all tending to justify the
Conduct of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in this Affair,
besides the declaration by word of Mouth
from the Marquis <HI>de Monteleone,</HI> the Am∣bassador
of <HI>Spain,</HI> to his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje∣sty.</P>
<P>The sum of all these Memorials, for they
are too long to repeat here, may be drawn
up and abridg'd in the following Heads,
<HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st.</HI> That the Emperor does not acknow∣ledge
King <HI>Philip</HI> to be King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but
gives him only the Title of Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI>
assuming to himself the stile and Dignity
of King of <HI>Spain, Spanish</HI> Majesty, like∣wise
all the Titles attending the Possession
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; that He (the
Emperor) whom the King of <HI>Spain</HI> there∣fore
calls only <HI>Arch Duke,</HI> has Erected a
Council at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which he calls the Coun∣cil
of <HI>Spain</HI>; That he Confers Titles and
Honours, such as Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> as if
he was really King of <HI>Spain</HI> in Possession,
and the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> That these things are Evedences of
his resolving to attack King <HI>Philip,</HI> and
Chace him out of <HI>Spain</HI> it self if he was able,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
or when he shall be so; and in the mean
time, takes all Occasions to shew himself a
mortal Enemy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Emperor Broke the Terms
of Peace and Neutrality, even as soon as
they were made, <HI>viz.</HI> That when (his Im∣perial
Majesty) consented by Treaty to quit
<HI>Catalonia,</HI> where in a few Days more he
must have been overcome, and been redu∣ced
to the necessity of having fallen into the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Hands; yet he did not quit
the Towns and Strengths, as he ought to
have done, by Consigning them into the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Hands, to whom they were
to be surrendred, but gave them over to the
Rebels the <HI>Catalans,</HI> encouraging them to
hold out against his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty, by pro∣mising
to return and assist them, which occa∣sion'd
the shedding of much Blood, and the
Expense of an Infinite mass of Treasure, to
reduce those Places to Obedience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4<HI>thly,</HI> That he not only encourag'd the
Rebel <HI>Majorkins</HI> in their Rebellion against
his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty, but actually sent them
Ships, Men, Money, Arms, Provisions,
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to support them in their
Rebellion against the King of <HI>Spain</HI>; Ex∣horting
them also to maintain their Rebelli∣on,
in hopes of farther Assistance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5<HI>thly,</HI> That the Imperial Governor of
the <HI>Milanese,</HI> has, by order from the Em∣peror,
Arrested, and put in Prison, the
Abbot <HI>Molinez,</HI> a Person Sacred by his Cha∣racter
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of Grand Inquisitor, Reverend by his
Age, and who ought to have been so by the
Pasports which were given him at <HI>Rome</HI> from
the Pope, with Approbation of Count <HI>Gallas</HI>
the Imperial Minister there; and lastly,
who having given no Offence in Person to
the Emperor, is visibly Arrested, as an Af∣front
to his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty, and an Insult
upon his Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6<HI>thly,</HI> That his Imperial Majesty has him∣self
broken the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> by ex∣torting
Immense Sums of Money from the
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> on pretence of its being
their just Due to pay towards the carrying on
His War against the <HI>Turks.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>And <HI>Lastly,</HI> That this being a particular
Conjuncture for the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Purpose,
favourable for his Designs, and the like, his
<HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty thinks he cannot let slip so
fair an Occasion, as well respecting the
Troubles in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as the general Discon∣tent
of the People of <HI>Italy,</HI> and their readi∣ness
to enter into Measures, for the effectu∣al
delivering themselves out of the Hands of
the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These are the General Heads of the
Charge, as may be seen by the said Memo∣rials
or Manifestoes of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers,
to which I refer, they having all been made
publick in the common Printed Papers of the
Town, as to the pretence of the Emperor
using Artifices to secure to himself the Suc∣cession
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
to the Estates of the Grand Duke of
<HI>Tuscany,</HI> That I look upon as Trifling and
without Foundation, and therefore not
worth naming among the rest.</P>
<P>It is not our business to enquire here,
whether these Objections are just, and whe∣ther
what is Alledged can be made good in
Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Emperor has done so
and so, as above: Nor is it the present
Question, whether if these Allegations are
just, they are a sufficient Argument for the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> to take up Arms, and begin
a War in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But the Design of this Tract, is to En∣quire
how these things respect the other
Powers of Christendom; and what Part it
is probable they may take in the Quarrel;
and by other Powers here, I am to be under∣stood,
to mean in particular the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> the King of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> and the Cantons of <HI>Swisserland,</HI>
what share they are like to have in the
Quarrel, and whether they are bound by
the Treaty of Neutrality to Concern them∣selves
in a War for the keeping the Posses∣sion
of <HI>Italy</HI> to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> yea,
or no.</P>
<P>I begin with the King of <HI>Sicily.</HI> To make
short with his Story, I shall look on him
as one of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> for such he
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
is: We see his Majesty acting a very
subtle Part, as indeed it stands him in stead
at this time to do. It is true, the <HI>Im∣perialists</HI>
threaten him, and notwithstand∣ing
all his Protestations of being resolved
to pursue the Neutrality, they mistrust
him, and seem as resolv'd to fall on him in
their Way; nay, some say, they resolve to
begin with him. No Man will be so weak
as to ask what is his <HI>Sicilian</HI> Majesty's Bu∣siness
if he is attack'd; but the Question
with him seems to be, whether his Majesty
having now a very great Army on Foot, in
a Readiness for Action, and apprehending
the Imperialists will certainly attack him,
ought not, by way of Prevention, to begin
first, having so clear an Advantage, and an
Opportunity, which it is very probable,
may not be offer'd again, I mean, as that
of joyning with <HI>Spain?</HI></P>
<P>This is the Question which the Politicians
who consider not what is right, or what is
wrong, but what is fittest to be done, respe∣cting
the Interest of the Party; I shall in
brief state what I think will be the
Case here, and as therein I give only one
Opinion, let others judge as they see Cause,
and let the Event determine. In a Word,
I say, I think it seems unavoidable, and the
King of <HI>Sicily</HI> cannot be unconcern'd in a
War, if it follows, and that his Majesty
will not fail to oyn his Arms with the
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
K. of <HI>Spain</HI>; only that this cannot be expected
till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have landed a considerable
Body of Men on the Coast of <HI>Italy,</HI> either
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> or perhaps high∣er
up, towards the King of <HI>Sicily</HI>'s own
Country, which is more than probable, by
the <HI>Spanish</HI> General's demanding Passage
of the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> for an Army into
the <HI>Parmesan.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore being so near a Decision,
and at present, representing it self to our
View as unavoidable, I lay it down as a
thing most certain, either voluntarily of
himself, or forced by the Imperialists them∣selves,
will certainly joyn with <HI>Spain</HI> in this
new Enterprize; and I must tell the Impe∣rial
Ministers, who talk so loudly of the
Certainty of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI>'s Ruin in
such a Case, and let the Event be what it
will, there is great Reason to believe, ma∣ny,
if not all the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> seem to
resolve to run the Venture of it, if the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
give them but a little more Encourage∣ment.
What their Dependence and Encou∣ragement
are, Time will not fail to disco∣ver.</P>
<P>I
will not say, but these Princes may have
their several Grievances, and may have just
Reasons to complain of the Violences and
Oppressions of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> I am
willing in Compliment to their Integrity, to
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
suppose, tho' not to grant, the Imperial
Governours have perhaps exceeded their
Commissions, or that even their Commis∣sions
have been in some things invasive of
the Right of the several Powers complain∣ing,
contrary to Justice, and to a Treaty of
Neutrality; and I will give these Complaints
their full Weight, when I come to examine
the grand Question, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether for
this they ought to take up Arms, and de∣stroy
the Neutrality, in which the preser∣ving
their Rights is not the only Question;
but by which the Ballance of Power in
<HI>Europe</HI> is preserv'd: In which Ballance of
Power, most, if not all the other Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> are concern'd, at least those Powers
are, of whom I am more particularly to
speak.</P>
<P>In this Circumstance then I lay down the
State of things in <HI>Italy,</HI> at this time, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> are in a present
Disposition to Revolt, and that the King of
<HI>Sicily</HI> is in the same Case, and that they on∣ly
want a powerful Protection of some other
Potentate to support them, and that there∣fore
we may expect, if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ap∣pears
thus able to protect them, they will
certainly joyn with him whenever a pow∣erful
Army appears.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Pretensions then, and
the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> being thus stated, the
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Plot among them seems to be discover'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on the Foun∣dation
of his own Grievances only, shall be∣gin
the War, and according to the Success
his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty meets with, the other
Princes shall declare themselves; so that if
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should not be able to car∣ry
on the Design, they may all retreat to
their Solemn Protestations of not being con∣cern'd
in the Quarrel of <HI>Spain,</HI> and may
make smooth Water with the Emperour,
when they find themselves unable to raise a
Storm: But on the contrary, if the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> can force his Way into <HI>Italy,</HI> and dis∣possess
the Imperialists, so as to protect them,
then they will declare themselves.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot I shall treat the Affair
in general; if I do any Wrong to the
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> it will be time to acknow∣ledge
it when the Wrong appears.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the History of Fact:
The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> according to this Scheme,
has begun the War, and serving himself, of
the Emperor's being perfectly destitute of a∣ny
Marine Power, and of the unhappy Con∣juncture
of a furious War with the <HI>Turks,</HI>
he invades the Dominions of his Imperial
Majesty, in particular, the Island of <HI>Sardig∣nia,</HI>
which the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having a power∣ful
Fleet, and the Imperial Government not
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
three Men of War, could no ways be re∣liev'd.</P>
<P>Here
we stop a while, and make a Tran∣sition
at once to the Courts of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and the <HI>Hague.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were not so
ignorant, as not to know, or so dull, as not
to think of it; That the Powers or Courts
above mentioned, who had all severally so
great a Share in making the Capitulation, or
Treaty for the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> would
interest themselves in this Affair, as having
charg'd themselves with the Guarantee of
that Neutrality, and therefore his <HI>Spanish</HI>
Majesty caus'd, not only the Letters and
Memorials mentioned above, to be pre∣sented
in the Nature of Manifesto's to the
said Courts, but made often a repeated Pro∣posal
of stopping their Proceedings, till time
might be given to the pacifick Princes and
Powers, who he thus appply'd to by such
Methods as they thought most proper to
bring his Imperial Majesty to listen to Rea∣son,
and to do Justice to his <HI>Spanish</HI> Ma∣jesty's
Pretensions.</P>
<P>These Proposals being taken <HI>Ad Referen∣dum,</HI>
did indeed entitle the said Princes and
Powers to make the needful Representations
to the Emperor, and to make use of all the
good Offices they found for their Purpose,
to induce the Emperor to refer likewise the
Matters in Dispute to their Mediation, as
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> likewise offer'd to do.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
By the way, I must here observe as I
go, in order to make every thing clear to
the Reader of this Enquiry. 1. That these
Powers were more or less, all of them en∣gag'd
before as Guarantees of the Treaty of
Neutrality in <HI>Italy.</HI> 2. That tho' their be∣ing
so Guarantees qualified them the better
to be Mediators; yet this Mediation, if they
had accepted it, does not by any Means
tye up their Hands from, or lessen the
Right they have to act as Guarantees of the
Neutrality of <HI>Italy.</HI> 3. That we do not find
in the Proposal, any Conditions made with
them, that this Offer should subsist on∣ly
in case they declar'd themselves accepting
the said Mediation. 4. We do not find that
the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> their High Migh∣tinesses
the States General, and the Regent
of <HI>France,</HI> did actually engage in any such
Mediation. But 5. that being willing to do
all good Offices, for the preserving the
Peace and Tranquility of <HI>Europe,</HI> they have
concerned themselves, in the most earnest
Manner to his Imperial Majesty, in what the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> demands, and to induce him
to accept of the Proposals of his <HI>Spanish</HI>
Majesty, in Order to a Treaty.</P>
<P>But while this is depending, and before
they have been able to obtain any Answer,
or enter into any Negociation on the Pro∣posal,
we find <HI>Spain</HI> entirely regardless of
the offer'd Suspension of her Conquests, and
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
taking no Notice of the Engagements she
had enter'd into with his <HI>Britanncik</HI> Ma∣jesty,
and other Powers, as above? I say,
we find <HI>Spain</HI> vigorously pushing on her
Advantages, making Preparations for new
Enterprizes, and even by her Ambassador,
the Prince <HI>de Cellamare,</HI> at the Court of
<HI>France,</HI> declaring publickly, that she in∣tends
to do so; this last Declaration being
indeed so inconsistent with those mentioned
above, deserves to be remark'd as follows;
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE loose Rumours, and the sur∣prizing
News, which have been
current some time since at this Court, as
well as in the other Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that
the King my Master, designed for some
secret Enterprize, the Ships and Troops
which he had assembled at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to∣gether
with the Instances, continual Re∣presentations,
and extraordinary Applica∣cations
made at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> by the
<HI>German</HI> Ministers and their Friends, who
were alarm'd upon the first Advice of such
an Enterprize, out of a Remorse of their
own Conscience, have kept me to this
time under an Uneasiness, which your
Excellency, who knows sufficiently my
Zeal for the Glory of the King my Master,
and how devoted I am to his Service, may
easily imagine, as well as the extreme A∣gitation
those Rumours have produc'd in
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
me; but that Trouble was throughly
calmed, by a Letter which I received
from Monsieur the Marquis <HI>Grimaldo,</HI>
whereof I have annexed a Copy to this
Memorial, which I have the Honour to
deliver to your Excellency.</P>
<P>I have the Satisfaction to see therein
the Reasons that have induced the King
my Master, to undertake to recover <HI>Sar∣dignia</HI>
by Force of Arms, set forth in such
a manner, as ought to perswade all the
World of the Justice of this Expedition.
My Penetration, tho' not very extensive,
had already afforded me a Glymspe of the
Solidity of those Reasons, which are groun∣ded
on the Infractions made by the Court
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> of the solemn Treaties for the
Evacuation of <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Majorca,</HI> and
the Non-performance of the Conditions
on which the Suspension of the Arms in
<HI>Italy</HI> had been concluded. Such Contra∣ventions
can never be forgotten!</P>
<P>I put therefore into the Hands of your
Excellency, a Copy of the Letter of M.
the Marquis <HI>Grimaldo,</HI> that you may be
entirely and fully porswaded of the Ju∣stice
of the Arms of his Catholick Ma∣jesty,
and be able more exactly to acquaint
the Regency therewith. I cannot add any
thing to that Letter, but a Reflection, <HI>viz.</HI>
That as the King my Master, has forbore
hitherto to attack the Arch-Duke in the
Dominions he has usurp'd from him, up∣on
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
two Motives, equally wise and impor∣tant;
so he does not do it at present but
at the utmost Extremity, and after the
Archduke has violated all the Regards due
to Crowned Heads, and after he has put
upon him the Affront of seizing with Vio∣lence
the Great Inquisitor of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The first Motive is, that the King my
Master, whose Courage and Greatness of
Soul are worthy of his Birth and his Throne,
resents much more what wounds his Dig∣nity
than the Enterprizes that are made
chiefly against his Interest, of which I am
an unexceptionable Witness, having seen
to what a degree his generous Courage was
provoked, when he heard the unjust Vio∣lence
and odious Usage suffer'd since the
loss of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the
Prisons of <HI>Milan,</HI> on the Part of the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>
by the Viceroy the Marquis de <HI>Vil∣lena,</HI>
and the other General Officers, who
serv'd under him, amongst whom I have
the inestimable Glory to have been di∣stinguished
by a particular Attention of the
Enemies of the King my Master, to abuse
me.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will immediately per∣ceive
the scond Motive. The last Affront
offer'd by the Archduke to the King my
Master, at a time that he did not expect to
receive a new one, has had the effect of a
new Weight put into a pair of Scales already
full, and has immediately turn'd the Bal∣lance.
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
His Majesty would have never∣theless
made a Sacrifice of his Resentment,
to the Holy Maxims, which are the Rule
of his Conduct; and would have given it
up as a new Victim to the Good of Chri∣stendom,
if he had not seen that the Na∣val
Forces of the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the Prin∣ces
their Allies, were Masters of the Sea
in the <HI>Levant</HI>; and lastly, if he had not
been fully convinc'd that he was under a
necessity to make an Enterprize of great
Moment, in order to prevent new Out∣rages,
and confound the Pride of his Ene∣mies,
who to satisfy the Pride of their
Hatred, and terrify People by their Wick∣edness,
have seized a Clergyman, whom
Old Age and Infirmities render'd an Ob∣ject
of Compassion; trampling under foot,
by their cruel Usage against his Person, the
Laws of Nations, and the Treaties, which
ought to have protected him against all
Imprisonments; and the rather, because
with the Consent of the Minister of the
Archduke at <HI>Rome,</HI> he took his Way thro'
the <HI>Milanese</HI> with a Pass given him by the
Pope. The Archduke, in violating that
Pass, has shewn little Respect to the Su∣pream
Head of that Church, against
whose Enemies he boasts so much to fight
at this time.</P>
<P>I pray God to preserve your Excellen∣cy
as long as I wish it. Sign'd,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The Prince de CELLAMARE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17"/>Before I enter then upon the main Que∣stion
of a War, I think here occurs a parti∣cular
or previous Question to be Consider∣ed,
<HI>viz.</HI> Is this proceeding of <HI>Spain</HI> an Af∣front
to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and to
all the Powers to whom those pacifick Pro∣posals
were made, and who so willingly be∣gan
their good Offices with his Imperial
Majesty, or is it not? Is it using his Majesty
well, or is it oftering the highest Contempt
to his Person, and to the Interposition of
his Interest, as is possible to be offer'd? Is it
not a Breach of Faith and Honour? In a
Word, Is it not dealing Deceitfully and
Dishonourably with His Majesty, making
use of his good Offices to Amuse and De∣ceive
the Prince who they were proposed to
serve; and in a Word, making a Property of
the three most Potent Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> in
order to advantage himself of their Civili∣ties;
and, as before, he had Deceived <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
in the matter of his Armament by Sea,
on Petences, and indeed Promisses, of fitting
out a Fleet for the Assistance of the <HI>Venetians</HI>
against the <HI>Turks,</HI> so now Deceiving the
Emperor by the fraud of a specious Propo∣sal,
which no Prince could have such mean
thoughts of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as to believe
he was not sincere in? It cannot be sug∣gested
that in this the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
is used well, or used really as one Crown'd
Head ought to use another; nor can it be
suggested, but that when Occasion presents,
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
and Circumstances concurs, His Majesty
knows very well how to Resent it, and is
not without the Means of making his <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Majesty sensible of it.</P>
<P>But our question at home is it seems of
another nature, and indeed something of a
new fashion, <HI>viz.</HI> whether we shall be wil∣ling
the Honour of the <HI>British</HI> Throne shall
be so far asserted, as that His Majesty shall,
upon the single Point of being Affronted,
Engage in this matter? or whether we shall
leave the <HI>British</HI> Powers to be so far depre∣ciated,
as to take no notice of such Usage,
and consequently to be Affronted on all oc∣casions
by all the Kings of the Earth?</P>
<P>However for once, and to gratify the Op∣posers
far beyond their Expectations, and
to leave room for all their specious soft
ways of covering these things over, I shall
give way to their Harangues upon the cir∣cumstances
of the Nation, <HI>viz.</HI> That we
have lately been involv'd in a heavy War,
which has brought an insupportable Burthen
of Debt upon the whole Kingdom; That
we are but just entering upon Methods for
working out of those things, and have
scarce tasted the sweet part of any one Arti∣cle
worth naming; That all the Savings of
the last Year have not eased the People of
one Tax, neither can they in some years yet
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
to come, and that it will be a great many
years before we can possibly give such Ease
to the poor People, as to bring their living,
and keeping their Families, to be as Cheap
to them as before, and yet their Provisions
are even dearer than in time of War: That
all neighbouring Countries are reducing
their Expence and lessening their Debts,
and in a fair way to be out of Debt before
us, even tho' no new War should be Com∣menced:
But that every year brings with it
some new load upon <HI>Britain</HI> to keep her low,
as for Example, the Rebellion for one Year,
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Affair for another, and if now
we Engage in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> we are in
a fair way to continue the Charge of all
the Taxes and Funds that are upon us, be∣sides
what new Demands may be necessary,
and so the Nation will for ever sink under a
weight already own'd to be insupportable.</P>
<P>To all these things, they add the supposi∣tion
of a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> the Consequen∣ces
of it to our Commerce, which after a
long Decay, and suffering infinite Convul∣sions
in the last War, began to revive again
in all parts of the World; but will imme∣diately
be overwhelm'd in the most sensible
parts of it, such as the Trade to <HI>Spain</HI> it self,
the Assiento Contract, the Trade to <HI>Italy,</HI>
and the like; and perhaps the Effects of our
Merchants and South-Sea Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be
seized by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="22"/>
This is a long Detail of plausibles, which
indeed our People begin to fill their Mouths
with in this Case, and in some of the parti∣cular
Cases they are not without weight; It
is true, our Debts are many and great, and
the Nation wants a recess of Taxes; it is
true, our <HI>Spanish</HI> Trade is Considerable, and
the Effects of our Merchants are Great
Abroad, and may be liable to be Confisca∣ted
by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>I'll add to this, That we have Reason to
believe from the Wisdom, and the pacifick
Disposition of His Majesty himself, from
the Prudence and Moderation of his Coun∣cils,
from the just Desire the King must ne∣cessarily
have to restore the Tranquility of
His Subjects, and from a willingness once
to Enjoy his new Dominions in Peace, and
see his People flourishing in Arts and Trade,
by which they are now in a fair prospect of
making themselves more than ever, the
Greatest and most Opulent Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>But against all these Things, doubtless
there are other matters that weigh some∣thing
in the Scale of this Question, and
which merit to be considered by themselves;
I shall fetch nothing remote to make good
the deficiency, for the Subject is but too fruit∣ful
of Argument, and the Necessity will ap∣pear
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>
even at first sight, if we go back Histo∣rically
but a little way into things past,
and compare them with the visible pro∣spects
of things to come.</P>
<P>The Great, and indeed the true Reason,
which was always alleg'd for the pushing
on the late War at so vast an Expence, and
the continuing it thro' so many Difficulties,
as at first for many years obstructed the Suc∣cess
of it, was the fixing the Ballance of
Power in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this, That so many Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> Confederated to reduce the Exorbi∣tant
Power of <HI>France,</HI> by whose Conquests
and Ambitious Designs that Ballance was
destroyed, and the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> in
Danger of submitting at last to an Univer∣sal
Tyranny in the Conqueror.</P>
<P>It was for this that the Glorious King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
fix'd the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty, as the boun∣dary
of his Demands from <HI>France</HI>; and de∣clar'd,
if <HI>Spain</HI> went beyond those limits, he
would be then as much a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> as he
was then a <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this that such long Struggles
were made to prevent the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy
falling into the Hands of the House of <HI>Bour∣bon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="24"/>
It was for this we Complain'd so warmly
of the Measures in the last Reign, and of the
Conditions of the late Peace, as betraying
the Confederacy, and destroying the Great
End of the War, by giving up <HI>Spain</HI> to King
<HI>Philip,</HI> who at that time was entirely in the
Interest of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this all the Renunciations of the
Treaty of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> were entred into, and the
weight of the Argument acknowledg'd, even
in those very things which were said Eventu∣ally
to betray it, and by those very People
who have been so openly Charg'd with lea∣ving
it unprovided for, or not sufficiently se∣cur'd.</P>
<P>It
was on the Pretence of this being suf∣ficiently
secur'd, that the People who made
the Peace of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> justify themselves, and
tell us that it was a good Peace, and that it
fully answered the end of the War.</P>
<P>It must then follow, that even those very
People ought to be the first to declare, that
what ever Prince breaks in upon that Bal∣lance,
Destroys the Efficacy of the Peace,
and brings us into the same necessity of re∣newing
a War, that there was at that time
for Beginning and Carrying it on.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="25"/>
As the Ballance of Power was the Reason
of the War, so it is the only Basis of the
Peace; whatever Prince makes an attempt
upon that Ballance, declares War against all
the rest, as they are naturally Guarantees of
the whole; or else they tacitly declare that
there was no just Reason at first, from the
Interruption of that Ballance, to begin the
former War, much less to carry it on as they
did, which would Arraign all the Princes of
the Confederacy, and Charge them with
Ambition, Unjust Invasion, and Blood.</P>
<P>These Points carry their own Evidence
with them, and admit so little dispute, that
it would seem a meer spinning out our Dis∣course,
to go about proving, or farther ex∣plaining
any part of them; all the publick
Transactions, Declarations of War, Memo∣rials
and Treaties, which were severally di∣spers'd
thro' <HI>Europe</HI> in the Time when these
things were done, are full of it, and may be all
call'd up as Evidences to this one Great Prin∣ciple
of the Policies of <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> That
Preserving the Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI>
was the Reason of the War, and the Grand
Preliminary of the Peace.</P>
<P>This then being laid down as a Funda∣mental
to argue from, it follows to enquire
in few Words, Is the dispossessing the House
of <HI>Austria</HI> of their Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="26"/>
reuniting those Dominions to the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy, a Breach of this Ballance of
Power, or is it not?</P>
<P>I need go no further for Arguments to set
forth the Importance of those <HI>Italian</HI> Domi∣nions,
than those made use of by the Gen∣tlemen,
who magnified them as most mighty
Additions to the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness, when
they would have perswaded us, that giving
those Parts to the Emperor, would make
him too great for the rest of the World, and
overthrow that Ballance they were given
to preserve.</P>
<P>If then those Dominions, whose Depen∣dencies
and Influencies are indeed equal to
their Power, were scarce thought safe to be
given to the Emperor, and were not thought
safe to remain to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> because
of the Ballance, which would thereby be
in Danger; How then can it consist with
the Ballance, to have them snatch'd out of
the Emperor's Hands again, and return
back to the same Hand from whence they
were taken?</P>
<P>This Consideration alone, obliges not
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> only, but even the whole
Confederacy, as one Man, to Declare against
this Invasion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to
oblige him to put a Stop to his Attempts,
<PB N="32" REF="27"/>
or make War upon him; otherwise, the End
of the late War is defeated, and the Effect
of the late Peace is destroy'd.</P>
<P>Nor is it sufficient to say, the Emperor
had those Dominions conquer'd for him,
and put into his Hands, and he ought to
take Care to maintain his Possession; for, if
the Emperor is, by any Incident of War,
<HI>as the present War with the</HI> Turks, <HI>for Ex∣ample,</HI>
expos'd to the Possibility of a Surprize,
it would shew a very ill Concern for the
general Good of <HI>Europe,</HI> to let his Domini∣ons,
which we thought our selves so much
concern'd to get for him, be lost again, be∣cause
he (the Emperor) may not be able to
prevent it.</P>
<P>It was for our own Sakes, and for the
Publick Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> in which the whole
Confederacy were concern'd, that the War
was carried on; it was not to aggrandize
the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> that these Dominions
were conquer'd, but to weaken the oppo∣sing
Enemies, whose Power was too great;
and they were allotted to the Emperor, not
because his Arms had Conquer'd them, for
without the Help of the Confederates, he
neither did conquer them, nor could have
Conquer'd them; but because it was meet,
in Order to preserve this great Article of the
Ballance, I say, it was meet for the Good
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
of all <HI>Europe</HI> that the Emperor should have
them.</P>
<P>Likewise speaking of the present Con∣juncture,
it is not meerly in Compliment to
the Emperor, whose immediate Interest or
Family, we have no Concern in, that we
are interested in this Affair; but it is the
common Interest of <HI>Europe,</HI> the same which so
many Years War was carried on for, and the
same which the Peace was; or ought to have
been made for: For this common Interest
it is meet that these Places, these Domini∣ons
in <HI>Italy,</HI> should remain to the House
of <HI>Austria</HI>; and they must remain to that
House, or that Ballance be so far destroy'd,
and the Ends of the Confederates are not
answer'd.</P>
<P>It remains then to judge, whether <HI>Great
Britain</HI> can quietly and unconcernedly look
on, and see the great Ends for which they
laid out their Blood and Treasure with so
much Chearfulness, and for so many Years,
destroy'd at once, and a Foundation laid
for the same Necessity of Blood and Trea∣sure
to be laid out again? Can we sit still,
and see Measures taken, which have in
themselves a direct Tendency to renew the
War? Those pacifick Gentlemen who plead
so earnestly in Behalf of Peace, should tell
us the Meaning of the ancient well known
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
Maxim, <HI>Pax quaeretur Bello,</HI> and whether
a timely Exerting the Strength which is
now in our Hands, may not be the only Way
to establish Peace, and prevent War?</P>
<P>It is much easier to keep things in the
Posture they are in, than to restore them
again after the Blow is given; <HI>Italy</HI> is a
large Country, a Conjuncture offers to the
ambitious Views of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which
perhaps may be in it self tempting enough;
the delicious Morsel, seems, as it were,
dropping into his Mouth; the Discontents
of the People there are represented as very
great, and perhaps they are so; it may be,
the <HI>Germans</HI> have not treated them very
kindly, they have oppress'd them with
heavy Taxes, preferr'd Foreigners to the
Places and Preferments which the Natives
have claim'd a Right to, carried away their
Native Troops to serve the Emperor in
his Wars in <HI>Hungary,</HI> Extorted great Sums
of Money and the like: What can we say
to this, had they applied to any Foreign
Princes to have interceeded for them to
his Imperial Majesty, none of the Con∣federates
would have refus'd their good
<HI>Offices,</HI> as far as the Custom of Nations
would admit one Prince to concern himself
in the Government of another: But that
these Grievances should entitle them to Re∣volt,
and to go back to a Prince from whom
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
the whole Interest of <HI>Europe</HI> was concern'd
to separate them; This quite alters the
Case: And to say we must sit still, and per∣mit
and suffer it, as we have acted in the
same kind our selves, and from the Princi∣ples
of Liberty we insist upon for our selves,
this is saying nothing to the purpose, for
our Views are in this the Liberties of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
and not the Liberties of <HI>Italy</HI>; the
first we are Nationally concern'd in, not the
last: Nay, if they were together in one
bottom, we should no otherwise be con∣cern'd
in the Liberties of <HI>Italy,</HI> than as they
were on one bottom with those of <HI>Europe</HI>;
but when they are opposite to one another,
the Case is quite alter'd. The particular
Rights of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes or People are
quite out of the question; the thing be∣fore
the Confederates is, the preserving that
Ballance, which is the Foundation of the
Liberties of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can we say in this Case that the Con∣federacy
is Dissolv'd, and the Affair is now
no more a Common Concern: The Com∣mon
Interest is the same, and the Princes,
as I said, even Natural Guarrantees for
the preserving it.</P>
<P>Much might be said here for the Nature
of this War, the Injustice of the manner,
as well as that of the pretences for it: But
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
it is true, these regard the Emperor rather
than us: However, I shall collect the Par∣ticulars,
that we may view them, and that
the World may judge of, what Honour,
what Equity, is to be expected from those
Powers, who can satisfy themselves to give
<HI>Europe</HI> Cause for such Complaints as these.
Some of them are to be found in the Pope's
Letter to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> where his
Holiness expostulates warmly, and even
almost calls it perfidious Treatment, <HI>viz.</HI>
1. That his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty promises and
engages his Royal Word, to him the Pope,
that he would not offer any Disturbance to
his Imperial Majesty's Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI>
during his being thus engag'd in a War
with the <HI>Turks.</HI> 2. That his <HI>Spanish</HI> Ma∣jesty
engaged to his Holiness, to send a
powerful Fleet into the <HI>Levant,</HI> in Aid of
the Christian Princes against the <HI>Turks,</HI>
which Fleet was to joyn the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and
act in Conjunction with the other Auxili∣aries;
whereas, on the contrary, this Fleet
was not only not sent to the <HI>Levant</HI> against
the <HI>Turks,</HI> but has been employ'd against
the Christian Emperor, at the same time
when his Imperial Majesty had employ'd
his whole Force to resist the Enemy of the
Christian Name, and not only has been
thus employ'd; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> have been
thereby abandon'd, and left to struggle with
the superior Force of their Enemies, to
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
their great and unspeakable Loss and Disap∣pointment,
and to the great Hazard of Chri∣stendom;
and the <HI>Turks</HI> being hereby left
Masters of the Seas, after two bloody En∣gagements;
which had the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet
been joyn'd, would either not have been
fought, or if they had, the Christans might
have obtain'd a most glorious Victory, or
at least, the Triumphs of the Infidels had
been prevented, and the Effusion of the
Christian Blood been saved. 3. That in
order to this Equipment for the Service of
Christendom, his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty demand∣ed
of his Holiness, a Brief for the raising
a great Sum of Money from the Clergy
of <HI>Spain,</HI> which his Holiness granted.
Likewise, a Hat was insisted for the Ab∣bot,
now Cardinal <HI>Alberoni</HI>; upon the
granting which, and the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s pro∣mises
of sending the said Squadron with
all Speed against the <HI>Turks</HI> was renewed;
yet all these Engagements were laid aside,
and the Power rais'd to fight with the E∣nemies
of Christ turn'd against the Chri∣stian
Emperor in a Manner so surprizing,
as to the Faith and Honour of his <HI>Spanish</HI>
Majesty, as is not to be express'd in better
Terms than in the Pope's Letter above∣said,
to which I particularly refer.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="33"/>
It is true, as I have observed, that
these Breaches of Faith and Honour, do
not in particular affect us, or relate to
<HI>Britain</HI>; but the Reader may consider
them, and compare them with the Memo∣morials
and Declarations of the Marquis
<HI>de Beretti Landi,</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and some
the like here; wherein his <HI>Spanish</HI> Ma∣jesty
offers, or promises to stop his Prepa∣rations,
and proceed no farther than the
Conquest of <HI>Sardignia,</HI> but leave the Mat∣ters
in Dispute with the Emperor, to the
Mediation of his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, and
their High Mightinesses the States Gene∣ral,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet, as all Advices now
say, and even the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Mi∣nister
in <HI>France</HI> acknowledges, his <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Majesty resolves to push his Advan∣tages
to the utmost, in Pursuit of his
Quarrel with the Emperor.</P>
<P>I am loth to make indecent Reflections
upon Persons exalted to the Dignity of
Sovereign Princes, and always retain a
Reverence to the Majesty of Crown'd
Heads; and therefore, forbear all those
Reflections which some People make upon
his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty, as a Branch of the
House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> suggesting that such
things as these seem to be Copying after
the Pattern of <HI>France.</HI> I wish his <HI>Spanish</HI>
Majesty would adhere to the Maxims of
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
Honour, so strictly adher'd to, and so no∣bly
practis'd by some of his glorious An∣cestors
on the Throne of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy,
rather than send us back to his
particular Progenitors, or to a Court,
where such things have formerly been too
much practis'd; and which I mention with
the more Caution, as the World seems to
acknowledge, the Court of <HI>France</HI> it self
is acted now by other Principles, and
may be expected, in a few Years, to esta∣blish
other Maxims, as well of Policy as
of Honour, differing from those which
brought it so eminently to the Gate of
Destruction.</P>
<P>I see nothing can be said then why the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> should be suffer'd unopposed,
to push on his present Designs, which are
founded on such Trifling pretences, and on
such Dishonourable Measures, unless we
can say, that we have no Concern in the
General G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that we are not
as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncern'd to keep any new Power
from Growing too Formidable and Exorbi∣tant
in <HI>Europe,</HI> as we shall be afterwards to
pull it down; and if it will be our Con∣cern,
as most certainly it must, to reduce
every Exorbitance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI>
and preserve the Ballance on which the
Tranquility of <HI>Europe</HI> Depends, it must be
our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rudence to prevent the first rise of such
Exorbitance.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35"/>
As to the disadvantages to our Commerce
Abroad, our inability to Engage in the Ex∣pence
at Home, our being in Debt, and
oppress'd with Taxes, and the like, they are
all Granted, and I make no doubt, that as
it is natural to infer from thence, that we
should by no Means Engage in any New
Expence if it be possible to avoid it; so I
believe, as is said above, That His Majesty
will not be prevail'd on to use Force in this
Case, if all possible Good Offices between
the Parties can prevent it, and if Reason
will take place; in a Word, that His Ma∣jesty
will not bring us into a War without an
absolute and apparent Necessity.</P>
<P>But let us not Depreciate our Country so
much, or lay our selves so low neither, as
to suggest that we cannot do, what we
cannot in Honour and Justice avoid; that
would be to say, We are so weakned by the
late War, that we are not able even to re∣sist
an Enemy, if we are Attack'd.</P>
<P>If our Power is Contemn'd if the Ho∣nour
of the <HI>British</HI> Crown is slighted, if
Princes come to think so meanly of <HI>Britain,</HI>
as not to think it worth while to keep their
Words with us, it is indeed attacking us:
They that will break their Promises with
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> How long do we think they
would be before they would break the Peace
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
with his Majesty, if they found it for their
advantage to do it?</P>
<P>To be Treated thus, is to be attack'd in
the worst manner, and Great Princes have
always resented the breach of Faith with
them, as the worst Affront that could be
put upon them; and I hope, none will sug∣gest
in this Case, that a Breach of Faith
with the King, is not a Breach of Faith
with the Kingdom, and that in a manner
more particularly provoking.</P>
<P>As to our Trade, perhaps it may be true,
that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> may take some ad∣vantages
against our Merchants; but let
such People who are frighted at those ap∣pearances,
remember what infinite Advan∣tages
our superiority at Sea gives our Sub∣jects
in War with <HI>Spain</HI>; let them remem∣ber
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the
whole Nation was visibly enrich'd by a War
with <HI>Spain</HI>; and to this, let me add, should
we now heartily set about a War with <HI>Spain,</HI>
<HI>Spain</HI> giving the Occasion, it is no hard
matter to shew how infinite Advantages
may be made of it in the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI>
Capable to make full Reparation for all the
Damages our Trade can suffer: But of that
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<HI>Laslty,</HI> Let it be observ'd, that this Dis∣course
does not tend to an immediate De∣claring
War against the King of <HI>Spain</HI>;
it takes it for granted, that Necessity ob∣liges
some Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> to joyn to pre∣serve
the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> and as has
been hinted to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to act against
those that would break that Neutrality; if
this leads us to act against the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> it is not <HI>Britain,</HI> but the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> that leads us to it; and if in doing
this, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> takes if for a Breach
of the Peace, it is his <HI>Spanish</HI> Majesty that
begins the War, and not the King of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
and the Consequences must lye at
their Door, and not at ours.</P>
