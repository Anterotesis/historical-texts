<HEAD>THE
ANATOMY
OF
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE General Cry against
Stock-Jobbing has been
such, and People have
been so long, and so justly
Complaining of it as a
publick Nusance; and
which is still worse, have complained so long
without a Remedy, that the Jobbers, harden'd
in Crime, are at last come to exceed all
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
bounds, and now, if ever, sleeping Justice
will awake, and take some Notice of them,
and if it should not now, yet the diligem
Creatures are so steddy to themselves, that
they will some time or other, make it absolute∣ly
necessary to the Government to demolish
them.</P>
<P>I know they upon all Occasions laugh at the
Suggestion, and have the Pride to think it im∣practicable
to restrain them; and one of the
top of the Function the other Day, when I
casually told him, That if they went on, they
wou'd make it absolutely necessary to the Le∣gislature,
to suppress them, return'd, That he
believ'd it was as absolutely necessary for 'em
to do it now, as ever it could be; But how will
they do it? 'Tis impossible, said he, but if the
Government takes Credit, their Funds should
come to Market; and while there is a Market
we will buy and sell; there is no effectual way
in the World, says he, to suppress us but this,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Government should first pay
all the publick Debts, redeem all the Funds,
and dissolve all the Charters, <HI>viz. Bank, South-Sea,</HI>
and <HI>East-India,</HI> and buy nothing upon
Trust, and then, indeed, says he, they need
not hang the Stock-Jobbers, for they will be
apt to hang them selves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
I must confess, I in part agree that this is
an effectual way, but I am far from thinking
it the only way to deal with a Confederati∣on
of Usurers, who having sold the whole
Nation to Usury, keep the Purse-Strings of
Poor and Rich in their Hands, which they
open and shut as they please.</P>
<P>But before I come to the needful ways for
restraining those People, I think 'twill be of
some Service to expose their Practices to
common view, that the People may see a
little what kind of Dealers they are.</P>
<P>And first, they have this peculiar to 'em, and
in which they out-do all the particular pieces
of publick Knavery that ever I met with in the
World, <HI>viz.</HI> That they have nothing to say for
it themselves; they have, indeed a particular
Stock of hard Ware, as the Braziers call it, in
their Faces, to bear them out in it; but if you
talk to them of their Occupation, there is not
a Man but will own, 'tis a compleat System of
Knavery; that 'tis a Trade founded in Fraud,
born of Deceit, and nourished by Trick, Cheat,
Wheedle, Forgeries, Falshoods, and all sorts
of Delusions; Coining false News, this way
good, that way bad; whispering imaginary
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Terrors, Frights, Hopes, Expectations, and
then preying upon the Weakness of those,
whose Imaginations they have wrought upon,
whom they have either elevated or depress'd.
If they meet with a Cull, a young Dealer
that has Money to lay out, they catch him at
the Door, whisper to him, Sir, here is a great
piece of News, it is not yet publick, it is worth
a Thousand Guineas but to mention it: I am
heartily glad I met you, but it must be as se∣cret
as the black side of your Soul, for they
know nothing of it yet in the Coffee-House,
if they should, Stock would rise 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> in
a moment, and I warrant you <HI>South-Sea</HI> will
be 130 in a Week's Time, after it is known.
Well, says the weak Creature, prethee dear
<HI>Tom</HI> what is it? Why really Sir I will <HI>let you
into the Secret,</HI> upon your Honour to keep it till
you hear it from other Hands; why 'tis this,
<HI>The Pretender is certainly taken</HI> and is carried
Prisoner to the Castle of <HI>Millan,</HI> there they have
him fast; I assure you, the Government had an
Express of it from my Lord <HI>St----s</HI> within this
Hour. Are you sure of it, says the Fish, who
jumps eagerly into the Net? Sure of it! why if
you will take your Coach and go up to the Secre∣taries-Office,
you may be satisfied of it your
self, and be down again in Two Hours, and in
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the mean time I will be doing something, tho'
it is but little, till you return.</P>
<P>Away goes the Gudgeon with his Head full
of Wildfire, and a Squib in his Brain, and co∣ming
to the Place, meets a Croney at the Door,
who ignorantly confirms the Report, and so
sets fire to the Mine; for indeed the Cheat
came too far to be baulkt at home: So that
without giving himself Time to consider, he
hurries back full of the Delusions, dreaming of
nothing but of getting a Hundred Thousand
Pounds, or purchase Two; and even this Mo∣ney
was to be gotten only upon the Views of
his being before-hand with other People.</P>
<P>In this Elevation, he meets his Broker, who
throws more Fire-works into the Mine, and
blows him up to so fierce an Inflamation, that
he employs him instantly to take Guineas to
accept Stock of any Kind, and almost at any
Price; for the News being now publick, the
Artist made their Price upon him. In a
Word, having accepted them for Fifty Thou∣sand
Pounds more than he is able to pay,
the Jobber has got an Estate, the Broker 2 or
300 Guineas, and the Esquire remains at Lei∣sure
to sell his Coach and Horses, his fine Seat
and rich Furniture, to make good the Defici∣ency
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
of his Bear-Skins, and at last, when all
will not go through it, he must give them a
Brush for the rest.</P>
<P>There are who tell us, that the <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Improvements made upon the News of
the Pretender's being taken, were part of the
Plot, that the late Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having concerted
the Voyage of <HI>Voghera,</HI> and how and in what
Manner the Report of the Pretender's being
there should spread, who it should amuse, and
how at one Blow it should spread East to <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI>
and North-West to <HI>Paris,</HI> and so on; for∣got
not to contrive it, as at once should serve
Political Ends in <HI>Italy</HI> and at <HI>Vienna:</HI> So on
the other hand, it should not fail to serve a
private View in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> and at the
same time that he deceiv'd some of the Whiggs
who he ow'd a large Grudge to for shrew'd
Turns at <HI>Preston</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> he might also
raise a Tax upon them towards the incident
Charges of his wandring Circumstances.</P>
<P>I do not averr this Story to be true, but the
Concert is so exact, and the Nature of it so
agreeable to the Stock-jobbing Art, nay and
to the Artists also, whose Correspondents are
very punctual, especially since it is said, that
Mr. T—s chief Agent was formerly my
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Lord <HI>M—r</HI>'s Broker; that I wont affirm it
may be true; but this I will venture to say of
it, That if we are often serv'd thus, the Pre∣tender
may very easily raise a Hundred Thou∣sand
Pounds a Year in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> for the
carrying on an Invasion, and lay the Tax
wholly upon his Enemies the Whigs, which,
by the way, I leave them to consider of.</P>
<P>But now that I may make good the Charge
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the whole Art and Mystery is a
meer Original System of Cheat and Delusion;
I must let you see too, that this Part of the
Comedy may be very well call'd, <HI>A Bite for
the Biter;</HI> for which I must go back to the
Broker and his Gudgeon. The Money'd Gen∣tleman
finding himself let into the Secret in∣deed
, and that he was bitten to the Tune of
30000 l. worse than nothing. After he had
unhappily paid as far as his ready Money
wou'd go, of which Piece of Honesty they say
he has heartily repented, <HI>and is in Hopes all that
come after him will forgive him for the sake of what
follow'd,</HI> stopt short, as he might well, you'll
say, when his Money was all gone, and be∣thinks
himself, What am la doing! I have paid
away all this Money like a Fool, I was
drawn in like an Ass, by the eager Desire of
Biting my Neighbours to a vast Sum, and I
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
have been Fool enough in that, but I have been
ten Thousand times a worse Fool, to pay a Groat
of the Money, especially since I knew I could
not pay it all: Besides, who but I would have
forgot the Nature of the Thing I was dealing
in, and of the People I was dealing with;
why, is it not all a meer Body of Knavery?
Is not the whole Doctrine of Stock-Jobbing a
Science of Fraud? And are not all the Dealers,
meer Original Thieves and Pick-Pockets? Nay,
do they not own it themselves? Have not I
heard <HI>T. W. B. O.</HI> and <HI>J. S.</HI> a thousand times
say they know their Employment was a Branch
of Highway Robbing, and only differ'd in
two things, <HI>First in Degree,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it was
ten Thousand times worse, more remorseless,
more void of Humanity, done without Neces∣sity,
and committed upon Fathers, Brothers,
Widows, Orphans, and intimate Friends;
in all which Cases, Highwaymen, generally
touch'd with Remorse, and affected with Prin∣ciples
of Humanity and Generosity, stopt short
and choose to prey upon Strangers only. <HI>Se∣condly
in Danger,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that these rob secure∣ly
; the other, with the utmost Risque that
the Highwaymen run, at the Hazard of their
Lives, being sure to be hang'd first or last,
whereas these rob only at the Hazard of their
Reputation which is generally lost before they
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
begin, and of their Souls, which Trifle is not
worth the mentioning. Have not I, I say,
heard my Broker Mr. ........ say all this,
and much more? And have not I also heard
him say, <Q REND="inline">'That no Man was obliged to make
good any of their <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> Bargains,
unless he pleased, and unless he was in haste
to part with his Money, which indeed I am
not: And has not all the Brokers and Job∣bers, when they have been bitten too hard,
said the same thing, and refused to pay'?<P>'Pray, how much did Old <HI>Cudworth, Ph.
C....p....m,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Goo......g</HI> Emi∣nent
Jobbers, Monarchs in their Days of <HI>Ex∣change-Alley,</HI>
break for? And how much did
they ever pay? One, if I mistake not, com∣pounded
at last for one Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound,
and the other Two for something less'.</P>
<P>'In a Word, they are all a Gang of Rogues
and Cheats, and I'll pay none of them: Be∣sides,
my Lawyer, Sir <HI>Thomas Subtle,</HI> tells
me, there's not a Man of them dares sue
me; <HI>No, tho' I had no Protection to fly to,</HI> and
he states the Case thus:'</P>
<P>'You have Sir (<HI>says Subtle</HI>) contracted to
accept of Stock at a high Price; <HI>East-India</HI> at
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
220, <HI>Bank</HI> at 160, <HI>South-Sea</HI> 120, and the
like. <HI>Very well,</HI> they come to put it upon
you, the Stock being since fallen; tell them
you cannot take it yet: If they urge your
Contract, and demand when you will take
it, <HI>tell them,</HI> you will take it when you
think fit.'</P>
<P>'If they swagger, call Names, as Rogue,
Cheat, <HI>and the like,</HI> tell them, <HI>as to that,</HI>
you are all of a Fraternity; there is no
great Matter in it, whether you Cheat them,
or they Cheat you; 'tis as it happens in the
Way of Trade, that it all belongs to the
Craft; and as the Devil's Broker, <HI>Whiston,</HI>
said to Parson <HI>Giffard,</HI> tell them you are all
of a Trade: If they Rage, and tell you the
Devil will have you, and such as that; <HI>tell
them,</HI> they should let the Devil and you a∣lone
to agree about that, 'tis none of their
Business: But when he comes for you, tell
them you would advise them to <HI>keep out of
the Way,</HI> or <HI>get a Protection,</HI> as you have
against them.'</P>
<P>'After this, it is supposed they will sue you
at Law, then leave it to me, I'll hang them
up for a Year or Two in our Courts; and if
ever in that time the Stock comes up to the
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Price, we will tender the Money in Court,
demand the Stock, and Saddle the Charges
of the Suit upon them; let them avoid it
if they can.'</P>
<P>'This is my Lawyer's Opinion, <HI>says he to
himself,</HI> and I'll follow it to a Tittle, and so
we are told he has, and I do not hear that
one Stock-Jobber has begun to sue him yet,
or intends it, nor indeed dare they do it.'</P></Q></P>
<P>This Experiment indeed may teach Under∣standing
to every honest Man that falls into
the Clutches of these merciless Men, call'd
Stock-Jobbers; and I give the World this No∣tice
, that in short, not one of their <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Bargains, need be otherwise than thus
complied with; and let these <HI>Buyers of Bear∣skins</HI>
remember it; not a Man of them dare
go to Common-Law to recover the Conditions;
nor is any Man oblig'd, further then he thinks
himself oblig'd in Principle, to make good
one of his Bargains with them; how far Prin∣ciple
will carry any Man to be just to a com∣mon
Cheat, that has drawn him into a
Snare, I do not indeed know; but I cannot
suppose 'twill go a very great Length, where
there is so clear, so plain, and so legal a Door
to get out at.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
It must be confess'd, that if the projected
Story of the taking the Pretender was acted in
Concert between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
between my Lord <HI>Marr,</HI> and a certain Broker
as Fame reports, either the Broker is the De∣vil
of a Jacobite, or my Lord the Devil of a
Broker; it must be acknowledg'd 'twas a far
fetch'd Trick, and answer'd the End in Ex∣change
most admirably.</P>
<P>Nor can all the World tell us any other End
that it could answer, for as to the Pretences of
deluding the <HI>Imperialists</HI> on Shore, or the
<HI>British</HI> Men of War at Sea, and so the better
to facilitate the Escape of the Pretender to
<HI>Spain,</HI> I undertake to prove, that this is ab∣surd
and ridiculous, for the Pretender was
Embark'd at <HI>Netunna,</HI> and gone away to Sea
thirteen Days at least, before this Whim of
People taken at <HI>Voghera</HI> was talk'd of.</P>
<P>As to the Amusements among the Courtsa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Vienna, Paris</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> they amounted to
nothing at all, answer'd no End, neither
prompted any Design on one hand, or hindred
any Thing on the other: In a Word, we may
challenge the World, to tell us any one Turn
that was serv'd by it, or End answer'd by it▪
but this in <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Nor was this so inconsiderable a Design, as
not to be worth while to form such a Juggle,
tho' a great way off; and as far off as it is, if
we may believe the Report of those who re∣member
the Machines and Contrivances of
that Original of Stock-Jobbing, Sir <HI>J--- C----</HI> There
are those who tell us, Letters have been
order'd, by private Management, to be writ∣ten
from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> with an Account of
the Loss of Ships which have been arriv'd
there, and the Arrival of Ships lost; of War
which the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> when they have been
in perfect Tranquility, and of Peace with
the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> when he was come down
against the Factory of <HI>Bengale</HI> with One Hun∣dred
Thousand Men, just as it was, thought
proper to calculate those Rumours for the
Raising and Falling of the Stock, and when
it was for his Purpose to but cheap, or sell
dear.</P>
<P>It would be endless to give an Account of
the Subtiltics of that Capital Che....t, when
he had a Design to Bite the whole <HI>Exchange:</HI>
As he was the leading Hand to the Market, so
he kept it in his Power to set the Price to all
the Dealers. The Subject then was clrie fly the
<HI>East-India</HI> Stock, tho' there were other Stocks
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
on foot too, tho' since sunk to nothing; such as
the <HI>Hudson</HI>'s-Bay Company, the Linnen Ma∣nufacture
Stock, Paper Stock, Salt-Petre Stock
and others, all at this Day worse than nothing,
tho' some of them then Jobb'd up to 350 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> as the two first in particular.</P>
<P>But the <HI>East-India</HI> Stock was the main Point,
every Man's Eye, when he came to Market,
was upon the Broker's, who acted for Sir <HI>J—</HI> Does
Sir <HI>J—</HI> Sell or Buy? If Sir <HI>J—</HI> had a
Mind to buy, the first thing he did was to
Commission his Brokers to look sower, shake
their Heads, suggest bad News from <HI>India;</HI>
and at the Bottom it follow'd, I have Com∣mission
from Sir <HI>J—</HI> to sell out whatever I
can, and perhaps they would actually sell Ten,
perhaps Twenty Thousand Pound; immediate∣ly
the <HI>Exchange</HI> (for they were not then come
to the <HI>Alley</HI>) was full of Sellers; no Body
would buy a Shilling, till perhaps the Stock
would fall Six, Seven, Eight, Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI>
sometimes more; then the Cunning Jobber had
another Sett of Men employ'd on purpose to
buy, but with Privacy and Caution, all the
Stock they could lay their Hands on, 'till by
selling Ten Thousand Pound, at 4 or 5 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> lost, he would buy a Hundred Thousand
Pound Stock, at 10 or 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> under Price;
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and in a few Weeks by just the contrary Me∣thod
, set them all a buying, and then sell
them their own Stock again at ten or twelve
<HI>per Cent.</HI> Profit.</P>
<P>These honest Methods laid the Foundation,
we will not say of a fine great Stone House,
on a certain Forrest, but it certainly laid the
Foundation of an Opulent Family, and iniu∣tiated
the Crowd of Jobbers on that dexterity
in tricking and cheating one another, which
to this Day they are the greatest Proficients,
that this part of the World ever saw.</P>
<P>To come a little nearer home, We had ano∣ther
Gentleman, who, from a small Beginning,
came to leave, <HI>as they say who speak of the least,</HI>
250000<HI>l.</HI> behind him, and yet did not die an
old Man neither. This Knight, to avoid as
much as possible, Reflections upon the Ashes
of the Dead, added to the former Craft, that of
bringing sudden News into <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> cal∣culated
to the Wagers he had to lay, or to any
he had to hedge off, and by this gain'd immense
Sums of Money (where he living I should give it
an harder Name.) Why should it be thought so
strange, that my Lord <HI>Marr</HI> and his Broker
should trump up a Story from <HI>Italy,</HI> send a
Sett of Post-Chaises with Gentlemen in Dis∣guise,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
out of the way of all Road, to be taken
up in the <HI>Milanese,</HI> and sent to the Castle, and
then sent word to a Great Man in <HI>England,</HI>
who is a BELIEVER, that it was the Preten∣der
, and all this to raise the Price of Stocks,
and put it upon the Whiggs. I say, Why
should this be more strange than that Sir <HI>H— F—se,</HI>
in the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, was
able to maintain such a constant Intelligence
in <HI>Holland, Flanders, Germany, Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.
that he several times brought the King Ac∣counts
of Battles fought, Victories won, Towns
taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the swiftest Expresses of
the King's own Servants and Generals could ar∣rive
; and had once a Diamond Ring of 500<HI>l.</HI>
given him by the King for his early News.</P>
<P>By this exactly concerted Intelligence, he
then knew how to turn the Wagers (a sort of
Jobbing then in Mode, and which grew so in∣famous
that they were at length oblig'd to sup∣press
it by Act of Parliament) which way he
pleased; and by which he got an immense Sum
of Money. How often did the Gentleman run
down true News as if it had been false, and
run up false News as if it had been true, by the
Force of his Foreign Intelligeneers, how often
coin Reports of great Actions to serve a Turn;
it is too late a Trick to be forgot, by many
that were hit by it to the Bone.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
In a word, they putting false News upon us
is nothing but an old Trade reviv'd, tho' it
must be confess'd, this of the Pretender has
been a Master-Piece, and the worthy Projector
who has the Credit of it, must pass for a dex∣trous
Manager as any the University of <HI>Ex∣change-Alley,</HI>
has bred up for 30 Years past.</P>
<P>It had also one Particular in it, for which
it was very remarkable; Sham Reports, False
News, Foreign Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are Things that
have been often trumpt upon us, as above, and
the Town have been not long ago cheated to a
good round Sum that Way: But then they have
been soon detected, the Morning News has
been set to rights in the Afternoon, or the
Evening's Heat has cool'd by Morning: But
this Trick had a fatal Duration, for it held us
near a Fortnight in a firm Perswasion of the
Thing; and even then it continued, but sus∣pected
only for some time longer, and was
yet longer before it was fully detected, and
even at last it was hardly conquered till the
Jacobites laugh us out of it, and the Pretender
was look'd for nearer Home.</P>
<P>The Assurance with which it was carry'd
about, the several Places from whence it was
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
written, made it so effectually be swallow'd
down, that really People saw no room to que∣stion
the Truth of it for a great while. 'Twas
written from <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> from <HI>Ge∣noa,</HI>
from <HI>Turin,</HI> and from <HI>Paris:</HI> Nay, 'twas
even believ'd at Court, and almost every
where else.</P>
<P><HI>Exquisite Fraud!</HI> who could have believed
this had been born in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> sent
over to <HI>Rome,</HI> agreed to there and executed
in such a Manner as to cheat not the Town
only, but all Europe.</P>
<P>The Authority that every one found at∣temded
the Report, supported it so that it pos∣sess'd
us all, even those whose Concern for the
Fact extorted Tears from them were not un∣deceiv
'd. Thus the Hucksters had Time to
play their Game, and they made Hay while
the Sun shone; for if we may believe Com∣mon
Fame, Bargains, Contracts and Agree∣ments
for Stocks, Bear-Skins included, a∣mounted
in that time to some Hundred Thou∣sands
of Pounds, nay, some say to Two Mil∣lions
and better, most of which was to the
Loss of the <HI>Believing</HI> Party.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
But what Tricking, what Fraud, what lay∣ing
Plots as deep as Hell, and as far as the
ends of the Earth is here? What Cheating of
Fathers, and Mothers, and Brothers, gulling
Widows, Orphans, couzening the most Wary,
and plundering the Unwary? And how much
meaner Roberies than these bring the Friend∣less
even to the Gallows every Sessions?</P>
<P>But I must not stop here, the Story of the
Pretender is over, that Trump is play'd, and
the artful Gamester's wanting a new Trick,
after having play'd so many already, that
one would think Invention was at an end,
yet they have found it out, and we are just
led into the Secret.</P>
<P>Hitherto Craft and Knavery appears to be
their Method, but we shall trace them now
a little further, and like true Hassars that
plunder not the Enemy only, but their own
Army, as the Opportunity presents; so these
Men are now come to prey upon the Govern∣ment
it self.</P>
<P>Let us look into the late Lotteries, had not
a piercing Eye detected the Rognery, and not
the fall of other things taken off the Edge of the
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Peoples Fancy for venturing, these Artists
had brought up the Tickets to 16<HI>s.</HI> a-piece ad∣vance
, even before the Act was pass'd. That
this could not be but by securing the Possessi∣on
of all the Tickets in their own hands, ex∣cept
such select Tickets as were not to come to
<HI>Market.</HI> I <HI>say,</HI> that this could not be but by
Connivance, and this every one knows; and
that this Connivance again could not be but
by some higher People than those that were
nam'd to it; this also every one may know,
who they were is none of my Business to en∣quire
, tho' 'tis easy to guess. 'Tis very hard
when our Statesmen come into a Confederacy
to bite the People, and when Dukes turn Stock-Jobbers
: Yet that this was done is most cer∣tain
, and what was this but making a Proper∣ty
of the Power that might be in their Hands,
the better to bite the People: For if the Par∣liament
appointed 500,000<HI>l.</HI> in Tickets to be
given out at a certain Rate that was low and
reasonable, was it not to encourage the People
on whom the rest of the National Burthen lies?
And if by the Craft and Knavery of Jobbers
the People are made to pay 600,000<HI>l.</HI> for
them, <HI>which is much about the Case,</HI> pray why
not pay the Hundred Thousand Pounds to the
Publick, either to pay off a Hundred Thou∣sand
Pounds of Debt, or to make the Burthen
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
of the current Year a Hundred Thousand
Pounds lighter, of which I am sure there is
need enough.</P>
<P>It has been indeed our Happiness, that a
worthy Member being inform'd of this abo∣minable
Cheat, detected it, and laid it before
the House; upon which a Vote was past to
make void all Bargains made for Tickets be∣fore
the Act was past; so the Biters were Bit∣ten; and a certain Sir <HI>George -----</HI> was oblig'd
to refund; but the Roguery of the Design
was never a Jot the less for that.</P>
<P>But the fatal Influences of this growing
Evil does not end here, and I must trace
Stock-jobbing now to its new acquir'd Capaci∣ty
of intermeddling with the Publick, assist∣ing
Rebellion, encouraging Invasion; and if
I do not bring the Stock-jobbers, even the
Whigs among them, to be guilty of Treason
against their King and Country, and that of
the worst Kind too, then I do nothing.</P>
<P>Had the Stock-jobbers been all Jacobites by
Profession, or had the Employment led them,
by the Necessity of their Business to put King
and Nation, and particularly their own, to Bar∣gain
and Sale; and had the selling of News
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een their Property, and they had an Act of
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Parliament, or Patent, to entitle them to the
sole Privilege of imposing what false Things
they pleased on the People, I should have had
much the less Reason to have complain'd of
their Roguery, and have rather turn'd my
self to the rest of them People, who are the
Subject they work upon, and only have stood
at <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> End, and cried out, <HI>Gentle∣men
, have a care of your Pockets.</HI></P>
<P>Again, had it been a private Club, or Su∣ciety
of Men, acting one among another, had
the Cheats, the Frauds, and the Tricks they
daily make use of, <HI>in which the English Rogue
was a Fool to them,</HI> been practis'd upon them∣selves
only; and like Gamesters at a publick
Board, they had only play'd with those that
came there to play with them; in this Case
also I should have held my Tongue, and only
put them in mind of an old Song; every
<HI>Stanza</HI> of which chim'd in with <HI>Tantararand,</HI>
Rogues all, Rogues all.</P>
<P>But when we find this Trade become a Po∣litical
Vice, a publick Crime, and that as it is
now carried on, it appears dangerous to the
Publick, that whenever any Wickedness is it
Hand, any Mischief by the worst of the Na∣tions
Enemies upon the Wheel, the Stock
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Jobbers are naturally made assistant to it, that
they become Abettors of Treason, assistant to
Rebellion and Invasion, then it is certainly
time to speak, for the very Employment be∣comes
a Crime, and we are oblig'd to expose
a Sort of Men, who are more dangerous than
a whole Nation of Enemies Abroad, an Evil
more formidable then the Pestilence, and in
their Practise more fatal to the Publick than
an Invasion of <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>It is said by some, that the principal Lea∣ders
in the Jobbing Trade at that Time, and
at whom most part of the Satyr in this Work
ought to be pointed, are Whigs, Members of
Parliament, and Friends to the Government;
and that the refore I had best have a Care of
what I say of them.</P>
<P>My first Answer is, <HI>So I will.</HI> I will have
a Care of them, and in the next Place let them
have a Care of me; for if I should speak the
whole Truth of some of them, they might be
Whigs; but I dare say, they would be neither
P.......men, or Friends to the Government
very long, and it is very hard his Majesty
should not be told what kind of Friends to
him such Men are.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Besides, I deny the Fact; these Men Friends
to the Government! <HI>Jesu Maria!</HI> The Govern∣ment
may be friendly to them in a manner
they do not deserve; but as to their being
Friends to the Government, that is no more
possible than the Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> or the
<HI>Chevalier de St. George</HI> are Friends to the Go∣vernment; and therefore without reflecting
upon Persons, naming Names, or the like;
<HI>there will be no need of Names, the Dress will de∣scribe
them,</HI> I lay down this new fashion'd Pro∣position,
or <HI>Postulatum,</HI> take it which way you
please, that I will make it out by the Con∣sequences
of what I am going to say.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Stock-jobbing, as it is now practi∣sed,
and as is generally understood by the
Word Stock-jobbing, is neither less or more
than High-Treason in its very Nature, and
in its Consequences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Stock-jobbers, who are guilty
of the Practices I am going to detect, are even∣tually
Traytors to King <HI>George,</HI> and to his
Government, Family and Interest, and to
their Country, and deserve to be used at least
as Confederates with Traytors, when ever
there are any alarms of Invasions, Rebellions,
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
or any secret Practices against the Govern∣ment
, of what Kind soever.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is a black Charge, and boldly laid, and
ought therefore to be effectually made out,
which shall be the Work of a few Pages in
the following Sheets.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I lay down this as a Rule, which I
appeal to the Laws of Reason to support, that
all those People, who at a Time of publick
Danger, whether of treasonable Invasion from
Abroad, or trayterous Attempts to raise In∣surrections
at Home, shall willingly and
wittingly abett, assist, or encourage the
Traytors, Invading or Rebelling, are equally
guilty of Treason.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All those who shall endeavour to
weaken, disappoint and disable the Govern∣ment
in their Preparations, or discourage the
People in their assisting the Government to
oppose the Rebels or Invadors, are guilty of
Treason.</P>
<P>All that can be alledg'd in Contradiction to
this, and perhaps that could not be made our
neither, is, That they are not Traytors within
the Letter of the Law; to which I answer
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
if they were, I should not Satyrize them, but
Impeach them. But if it appears that they
are as effectually destructive to the Peace and
Safety of the Government, and of the King's
Person and Family, as if they were in open
War with his Power, I do the same Thing,
and fully answer the End proposed.</P>
<P>As there are many Thieves besides House-Breakers
, Highway-Men, Lifters and Pick∣pockets
, so there are many Traytors, besides
Rebels and Invaders, and perhaps of a much
worse Kind; for as in a Dispute between a
certain Lord, and a Woman of Pleasure in
the Town, about the different Virtue of the
Sexes, the Lady insisted that the Men were
Agressors in the Vice, and that in plain <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
if there were no Whore-Masters, there
would be no Whores: So, in a Word, if there
were no Parties at Home, no Disaffection, no
Traytors among our selves, there would be
no Invasions from Abroad.</P>
<P>Now I will suppose for the Purpose only,
that the People I am speaking of were not dis∣affected
to the Government; I mean, not origi∣nally
, and intentionally pointing their Design at
the Government; nay, that they are hearty
Whigs, call them as we please; yet if it ap∣pear
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
they are hearty Knaves too, will do any
thing for Money, and are, by the Necessity of
their Business oblig'd, or by the vehement
Pursuit of their Interest, that is to say, of
their Profits, push'd upon Things as effectu∣ally
ruinous and destructive to the Govern∣ment
, as the very buying Arms and Amuni∣tion
by a profest Jacobite, in order to Rebel∣lion
could be, are they not Traytors even in
spite of Principle, in spite of the Name of
Whig; nay, in spite of a thousand meritori∣ous
things that might otherwise be said of
them, or done by them?</P>
<P>A Gun-Smith makes ten Thousand Firelocks
in the <HI>Minories,</HI> the honest Man may be a
Whig, he designs to sell them to the Govern∣ment
to lay up in the <HI>Tower,</HI> or to kill <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
or any of the rest of the King's Ene∣mies
; a Merchant comes and buys some of
them, and says they are for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or
to sell into <HI>France:</HI> But upon Enquiry it ap∣pears
they are bought for Rebellion; the un∣de
signing Gun-Smith comes into Trouble of
course, and it will be very hard for him to
prove the Negative (<HI>viz.</HI>) That when he has
furnish'd the Rebels with Arms, he had no
Share in the Rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
To bring this home to the Case in view, who
were the Men, who in the late Hurry of an
expected Invasion, sunk the Price of Stocks 14
to 15 <HI>per Cent?</HI> Who were the Men that made
a run upon the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and pusht at
them with some particular Pique too, if pos∣sible,
to have run them down, and brought
'em to a Stop of Payment? And what was the
Consequences of these Things? Will they tell
us that running upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> and lowering
the Stocks, was no Treason? We know, that
litterally speaking, those things are no Trea∣son:
But is there not a plain constructive
Treason in the Consequences of it? Is
not a wilful running down the publick Cre∣dit
, at a Time when the Nation is threaten'd
with an Invasion from Abroad, and Rebel∣lion
at Home? Is not this adding to the Ter∣or
of the People? Is not this disabling the
Government, discouraging the King's Friends,
and a visible Encouragement of the King's
Enemies? Is not all that is taken from the
Credit of the Publick, on such an Occasion,
added to the Credit of the Invasion? Does not
every thing that weakens the Government,
strengthen its Enemies? And is not every Step
that is taken in Prejudice of the King's Interest
a Step taken in Aid of the design'd Rebel∣lion?
The kindest thing that can be said of a
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
certain Triumvirate of Jobbers, whose Hands
have been deepest in this Part of the Work,
and who indeed had more Obligations upon
them than any other Men in the Town, to
have assisted the Publick Interest, and advan∣ced
the Credit of the Nation is, that they did
not think what they did, and that this Excuse
may not serve them another Time, I may soon
furnish them with an Anatomy of some of the
Conduct of that little Body of <HI>Number Three,</HI>
that when they see their Mistakes with the
Eyes that other Men see them, they may at
their Leisure give a better Turn to the Mea∣sures
of Unbounded Avarice.</P>
<P>And now that I may not be said to speak
without a Precedent, I humbly refer to those
money'd Gentlemen to a Case recent in Me∣mory
, and even in their own, which tho' in∣deed
they may think fit to have forgotten for
a time, they will all call to mind when they
hear of it again; and this was the Case of
two Goldsmiths (Knights also, and one of
them Member of Parliament too) in <HI>Fleet∣street,</HI>
who push'd at the Bank of <HI>England</HI> at
the Time that the Pretender's Invasion from
<HI>France</HI> was in its Preparation: One of them,
it was said, had gather'd a quantity of Bank-Bills
to the value of near 100,000 l. and the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
other, a great Sum, tho' not so many, and it
was said, resolv'd to demand them all at once.</P>
<P>Let the Gentlement I point at look back
to the printed Papers that Year, let them en∣quire
what Construction was put upon it; let
them enquire how the Government resented
it, how my Lord Treasurer <HI>Godolphin</HI> look'd
upon it as a Mine form'd to blow up the
Queen's Affairs, and how, in a Word, all the
Friends of the Government took it to be such
a Step in favour of the Pretender, as was im∣possible
to consist with Duty to the Queen.</P>
<P>Let them enquire further, with what Diffi∣culty
Sir <HI>R— H—</HI> wip'd off the Impu∣tation
of being a Favourer of the Rebellion,
and how often, in vain, he protested, he did it
with no such View, and how hard the Whiggs
were to believe him. Sir <HI>F— C—d</HI> indeed
carry'd it with a higher Hand, and afterwards
pretended to refuse the Bills of the Bank;
but still declar'd he did it as a Goldsmith,
and as a piece of Justice to himself, in some
Points in which the Bank had, as he alledg'd,
us'd him ill. But in general, it was look'd
upon as an open Affront to the Government,
and an abetting and countenancing the Inva∣sion
of the Pretender from Abroad, and the
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
Rebellion intended at Home: Nor was the
Government, much less were the Authors of
private Papers and Prints, wanting, in let∣ting
them know it; nay, if I am not misin∣form
'd, they were threatned with being trea∣ted
as Enemies to the Government, and if
Things had gone on to Extremities, they had
doubtless been mark'd out as Persons the Go∣vernment
were to take care of.</P>
<P>Now I only speak in plainer Words; It was
said then, that such Men as endeavour'd to
run down the Publick Credit, were Enemies
to the Government. I know no Distinction in
the Case, that should require so much Tender∣ness;
every Subject of King <HI>George,</HI> who is at
the same time an Enemy to King <HI>George,</HI> is a
Traytor, and every Overt-Act of that Enmity
it being his Duty to his utmost to favour, aid
and support the Government, is an Overt
Act of Treason, let it be gilded over with
what fine Words the Persons please, 'tis the
same thing, if it is not literal Treason, and
within reach of the Statute, yet the Crime is
in it self of the same Nature.</P>
<P>And let any one tell me, what is the Diffe∣rence
between two Dealers in Paper Credit in
the time of a <HI>French</HI> Invasion, and three
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Dealers in Paper-Credit in the time of a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Invasion, or what Sanctity in <HI>Birchin-Lane</HI>
more than in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> that one should
be a Protection for the same Practice that
was resented so justly in another.</P>
<P>Were those Stock-jobbers sincerely and hear∣tily
in the Interest of King <HI>George</HI> and his
Government, as they pretend loudly, what
Run could there be upon the Bank, what Ebb
of Credit, what sinking of Stock: The honest
Whiggs who were Friends to the Government
at that Time mention'd above, who not only
knew their Duty, but how to make it season∣able
and useful, acted after another Manner,
when others run upon the Bank with all the
Fury possible, they carry'd all the Money thi∣ther
they could gather up: Nay, I could name
a Man in this City, who having but 500 in
the World, carry'd it all into the Bank to sup∣port
the Credit of the Publick; and the Story
being told to her Majesty by the late Lord
Treasurer <HI>Godolphin:</HI> The Sense of such Fi∣delity
so mov'd the Queen, that she sent him
a Hundred Pounds as a Gift, a Royal Token
of her accepting such an Act of Loyalty; and
caused my Lord to give him an Obligation
from the Treasury to repay him the whole
500<HI>l.</HI> if any Disaster to the Bank should have
made it doubtful.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Where's the like Courage and Conduct to
be found now? Is it in Being? Are the Gentle∣men
less able? Or is it that they have not the
same Zeal for King <HI>George</HI> as that honest Citi∣zen
had for the Queen? Or do they doubt the
King being as sensible of the Service? Or what
is the matter that the Publick Credit had rather
met with injurious Juggling and Jobbing upon
it, than real Support, either from <HI>Exchange-Alley
, Birchin Lane,</HI> or some other Places less
noted.</P>
<P>Let those Men reflect a little upon the Cir∣cumstances
the Publick Credit must have been
in by such Management, if the <HI>Spanish</HI> Attempt
had been made, and if these Easterly Protestant
Winds had not chopt in, by which Providence
has given the Government Time to put it self
into a Posture of Defence, so as now not to be
afraid of them; and if the Capital Stock of
the Persons interested in the Funds, is now
sunk a Million in the real Value of them as
they stood before even at the Market, which
is nothing but what the Matter of Fact will
justify, to what Degree would the same Cur∣rent
, if it had gone on, have sunk the Estates
of all the Money'd Men in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
In what Manner would Money have been
rais'd upon a new Credit for any immediate
Exigencies that might have happened? And
should the Goverment have been supported,
nay though the Parliament had granted Funds,
while these Men had made all Credit ebb, per∣haps
, to 25 or 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Discount; and is
not this then a Species of Treason and Re∣bellion
.</P>
<P>It was very remarkable, that in the Juncture
of those Things the Jacobites could not refrain
taking notice how easie it was to set the Citi∣zens
a plundering the Bank, and even the Ex∣chequer
too; for had this gone on, the Funds
which are in effect the Exchequer it self, would
have gone down Hill, Hand in Hand with the
Bank; Credit would have borne equal Pace
in one as well as in the other, and the Govern∣ment
would no more have been able to borrow
than the Bank would have been able to pay.</P>
<P>It is scarce fit to enter into a Description of
all the mischievous Consequences which ne∣cessary
follow running down the Publick
Credit, in case of such Dangers as I have men∣tion
'd above; if I should fully describe them,
it would appear incredible. Every one will
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
allow that this Practice of the Jobbers, car∣ry
'd on a little further, would indeed appear
to be the worst Kind of Treason.</P>
<P>But it is needful, after having said thus
much of the Crime, to say something of the
Place, and then a little of the Persons too;
The Center of the Jobbing is <HI>in the Kingdom</HI> of
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> and its Adjacencies; the Li∣mits
, are easily surrounded in about a Minute
and a half (<HI>viz.</HI>) stepping out of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s into
the Alley, you turn your Face full <HI>South,</HI> mo∣ving
on a few Paces, and then turning Due
<HI>East,</HI> you advance to <HI>Garraway</HI>'s; from thence
going out at the other Door, you go on still
<HI>East</HI> into <HI>Birchin-Lane,</HI> and then halting a little
at the Sword-Blade Bank to do much Mischief
in fewest Words, you immediately face to the
<HI>North,</HI> enter <HI>Cornhill,</HI> visit two or three petty
Provinces there in your way <HI>West:</HI> And thus
having Box'd your Compass, and sail'd round
the whole Stock-jobbing Globe, you turn into
<HI>Jonathan</HI>'s again; and so, as most of the great
Follies of Life oblige as to do, you end just
where you began.</P>
<P>But this is by way of Digression; and even
still, before I come to the main Case, I am
oblig'd to tell you; That though this is the
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
Sphere of the <HI>Jobbers</HI> Motion, the Orbe to
which they are confin'd, and out of which they
cannot well act <HI>in their Way;</HI> yet it does not
follow, but that Men of Foreign Situa∣tion
(I mean Foreign as to them, I do not
meak Foreign by Nation) and of different
Figure are seen among them; nay, some
whose Lustre is said to be too bright for the
Hemisphere of a Coffee-House, have yet their
Influence there, and act by Substitutes and
Representatives: But first I must speak to
Originals.</P>
<P><HI>C—,</HI> a Man of Brass sufficient for much
more Businets than he can be trusted wich, is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to manage for three blue Ribbonds, and
for four or five Cath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>epers, who tell more
Money than their own: He fetches and car∣ries
with such indefatigable Application, that
he is said never to sail his Appointments to
a Minute, however remote from one another:
Where-ever he appears, he makes an <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
in his Person, and <HI>a Court</HI> in his Audi∣ence
: He is himself a <HI>Jonathans-Cossee-house</HI>
in little; Tho' he be at a Cock-Pit, he reallizes
<HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> in every Place; and yet he
rather is directed than directs, and like a cer∣tain
great General, famed for more Fire than
Flegm, is fitter to drive than to lead.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
<HI>S—</HI> has twice the Head, but not half the
Business as <HI>C—</HI> is said to have, yet he gets
more Money for himself, and <HI>C—</HI> gets
more for other Folks. <HI>S—</HI> is as cunning
as <HI>C—</HI> is bold, and the Reserve of one
with the Openness of the other, makes a com∣pleat
<HI>Exchange-Alley Man. C—</HI> jumps at
every thing, and as he got the start of the
World at his Beginning, by venturing more
than he was worth, so he deals now with all
Men as if they ventured more than they are
worth. Originally he was a BITE, which,
in Modern Language, is a <HI>Sharper,</HI> or, being
fully interpreted, may signify the head Class
of the Fraternity call'd <HI>Pick pockets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>T—,</HI> a Gamester of the same Board, acts
in Concert with <HI>C—</HI> and <HI>S—,</HI> and
makes together a true Triumverate of modern
Thieving; He inherits the Face of <HI>C—,</HI>
with the Crafr of <HI>S—,</HI> but seems to take
State upon him, and acts the reserv'd Part
more than either; yet even this too is all Gri∣mace
, for where e'er he can be sure to kill, he
an't fawn like an <HI>Irish-Man.</HI></P>
<P>They are all Three of yesterday in their
Characters, yet they are old in the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>e,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
(<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>resolving to be rich at the Price of every
Man they can bubble:</HI> Their first Blow was
aimed at the BANK, but there they were
out-witted; and the Great Lord-Treasurer
<HI>Godolphin,</HI> in the late Reign, gave them their
just Characters from that Action. The Defeat
they met with there, sticks so close to them,
that they reserve the Measures of their Re∣venge
, nor to cool, no not till the Charter of
the Bank shall expire.</P>
<P>However, their Wings being clipt by the
Clause then obtain'd in an Act of Parliament,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That no Society, Corporation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should
issue out Bills of Credit as a Bank, but the
Bank of <HI>England</HI> only; they were obliged
ever since to turn <HI>Stock-Jobbers,</HI> or if we
may speak properly of them, they are the
<HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI> Masters; for they have so many
<HI>Bear-Skins</HI> pawn'd to them at a time, so much
Stock deposited with them upon Bottomree,
as it might be call'd; that indeed they may
he call'd the City Pawn-Brokers: And I have
been cold, that they have had fifty Stock-Job∣bers
and Brokers bound Hand and Foot, and
laid in Heaps at their Doors at a time.</P>
<P>The next Trick they try'd, and which was in¦deed
the Master-piece of their Knavery, was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
getting an Assignment of the Forfeited Estates
in <HI>Ireland</HI> into their Hands: Indeed they began
the World upon this Prospect, and expected to
have had the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> mort∣gaged
to them: But here too they were disap∣pointed
, and had they not found a Man that
had as much Money as themselves, and more
Honesty, that Bargain of the Forfeited Estates
had been the last they had made in the World.</P>
<P>The Endeavours they use to cheat that
Gentleman, after he had deliver'd them from
a Blow that would have blown them up (is
another black Part of their Story that remains
to be told for the Illustration of their Chara∣cters
at another time:) But in the Interm 'tis
enough to say, that he who deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them
as Fools, knew how to deliver himself from
them as Knaves; and so they were dropt out
of the <HI>Irish</HI> Bargain to their great Mortifica∣tion
.</P>
<P>Now they stand ready, as Occasion offers,
and Profit presents, to Stock-jobb the Nation,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouzen the Parliament, ruffle the Bank, run
up and run down Stocks, and put the Dice upon
the whole Town.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41"/>
They had another Flap with a Fox-Tail,
to the Scandal of their Politicks in the late
Vote about the Tickets of the Lottery which
I mentioned above; what Market they will
make of it is well enough known: But the
Plot was never the less Cunning, and 'tis
certain the Knavery is not the less visible for
the Miscarriage. I come next to their more
modern Management.</P>
<P>Whenever they call in their Money the
<HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI> must sell; the <HI>Bear-skin Men</HI> must
commute, and pay Difference money; then
down come the Stocks, tumbling Two or Three
<HI>per Cent.</HI> then the Tools must sell, and then
Masters buy; the next Week they take in
Stocks again, then the Jobbers buy, and the
Managers sell. Thus the Jobbers bite their
Friends, and these Men bite the Jobbers, <HI>qui
Sarpat Sharpabitur, Exchange-Alley Latin;</HI> they
that are let into the Secret will understand it.</P>
<P>The Truth is, it has been foretold by cun∣ning
Men, who often see what can't be hid▪
that these Men, by a Mass of Money which
they command of other Peoples, as well as
their own, will, in Time, ruin the Jobbing
Trade. But 'twill be only like a general Vi∣sitation,
where all Distempers are swallow'd
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
up in the Plague, like a common Calamity,
that makes Enemies turn Friends, and drowns
lesser Grievances in the general Deluge. For
if the Reprisal Trade should adjourn from
<HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> to <HI>Birchin-Lane,</HI> it may seem to
be like the banishing Usury from the City
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which transferr'd it to a Jew at
<HI>Genoa,</HI> a Monk at <HI>Naples,</HI> and a Banker at
<HI>Venice,</HI> who, it was said, had no less than seven
and twenty Principalities in <HI>Italy</HI> mortgag'd
to them at a Time, besides two Kingdoms,
seven Dutchies, and the Jewels of the Crown
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus given the blazing Characters
of three Capital Sharpers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
Knaves of lesser Magnitude can have no
room to shine; the Alley throngs with Jews,
Jobbers and Brokers, their Names are need∣le
ss, their Characters dirty as their Employ∣ment
, and the best thing that I can yet
find out to say of them, is, that there hap∣pens
to be two honest. Men among them,
Heavens preserve their Integrity; for the
Place is a Snare, the Employment it self
fatal to Principle, and hitherto the same
Observation which I think was very aptly
made upon the Mint, will justly turn upon
them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That many an honest Man
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
has gone in to them, but cannot say that I
ever knew One come an honest Man out from
them.</P>
<P>But to leave them a little, and turn our
Eyes another way; Is it not surprizing to
find new Faces among these scandalous People,
and Persons even too big for our Reproof.
Is it possible that <HI>Stars</HI> of another Latitude
should appear in our Hemisphere? Had it been
<HI>Sims</HI> or <HI>Bowcher,</HI> or Gamesters of the Draw∣ing-Room
or Masquerades, there had been
little to be said; or had the Groom-Porter's
been transpos'd to <HI>Garraway</HI>'s and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s,
it had been nothing new; true Gamesters
being always ready to turn their Hand to
any Play. But to see Statesmen turn Dealers,
and Men of Honour stoop to the Chicanry
of Jobbing; to see Men at the Orfices in the
Morning, at the P— House about
Noon, at the Cabinet at Night, and at
<HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> in the proper Intervals, What
new <HI>Phoenomina</HI> are these? What fatal Things
may these shining Planets (like the late Great
Light) fore-tell to the State, and to the Pub∣lick;
for when Statesmen turn Jobbers, the
State may be Jobb'd.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44"/>
It may be true, that a Treasurer or Cash∣keeper
may be trusted with more Money than
he is worth, and many times it is so; and if
the Man be honest, there may be no harm in
it: But when a Treasurer plays for more Mo∣ney
than he is worth, they that trust him run
a Risque of their Money, because, tho' he may
be an honest Man he may be undone. I speak
of private, not publick Treasurers.</P>
<P>Indeed it requires some Apology to say
such a One may be an honest Man; it would
be hard to call him an honest Man who plays
away any Man's Money that is not his own,
or more than he is able to pay again out of his
own. But if it be dishonest to play it away,
<HI>that is,</HI> lose it at Play, 'tis equally dishonest to
play with it, whether it be lost or no, because
in such a Case, he that plays for more than
he can pay, his Master runs the Hazard
more than himself; nay, his Master runs
an unequal Hazard, for if the Money be
lost, 'tis the Masters, if there is Gain, 'tis
the Servants.</P>
<P>Stock-Jobbing is Play; a Box and Dice
may be less dangerous, the Nature of them
are alike, a Hazard; and if they venture at
either what is not their own, the Knavery
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
is the same. It is not necessary, any more
than it is safe, to mention the Persons I may
think of in this Remark; they who are the
Men will easily understand me.</P>
<P>In a Word, I appeal to all the World,
whether a Man that is intrusted with other
Mens Money, (whether Publick or Private, is
not the Question) ought to be seen in
<HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI> Would it not be a suffici∣ent
Objection to any Gentleman or Mer∣chant, not to employ any Man to keep his
Cash, or look after his Estate, to say of
him <HI>he plays,</HI> he is <HI>a Gamester,</HI> or he is <HI>given
to Gaming</HI> and <HI>Stock-Jobbing,</HI> which is still
worse, gives the same, or a stronger Ground
of Objection in the like Cases.</P>
<P>Again, are there fewer Sharpers and Set∣ters
in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> than at the Groom-Porters? Is there less Cheating in Stock-Jobbing
than at Play? Or rather is there not
fifty times more? An un-enter'd Youth com∣ing
to deal in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> is immediately
surrounded with Bites, Setters, Pointers, and
the worst sort of Cheats, just as a young
Country Gentleman is with Bauds, Pimps,
and Spungers, when he first comes to Town.
It is ten Thousand to one, when a forward
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
young Tradesman steps out of his Shop into
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> I say 'tis ten Thousand to one
but he is undone, if you see him once but enter
the fatal Door, never discount his Bills after∣wards
, never trust him with Goods at six
Months Pay any more.</P>
<P>If it be thus dangerous to <HI>the Mean,</HI> what
is it to <HI>the Great?</HI> I see only this difference,
that in the first the Danger is Private, in the
latter Publick.</P>
<P>It has not been many Years since Electi∣ons
for Members of — came to
Market in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> as current as Lot∣tery
Tickets now, and at a Price like these,
much above what any Parliament allow'd
them to go at; While this was carry'd on,
a great many honest Men exclaim'd against
it, and expos'd it; nay, several Acts of Par∣liament
were propos'd for regulating Electi∣ons
, and preventing Bribery and Corruption:
But all this would not do, and this indeed
was one of the happy Consequences of that
otherwise necessary Act for <HI>Triennial Parlia∣ments;</HI>
and I firmly believe that it is owe∣ing
very much to the late suspending that
Act for a Time, that these Things are not
come to Market again.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
It may easily be remember'd, that the first
Occasion of the <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> Men engaging
in the Case of Elections of Members, was in
King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, on the famous Disputes
which happen'd between the Old <HI>East-India</HI>
Company and the New; which having held a
great while, and having embarrass'd not the
City only, but the whole Nation, and even
made it self dangerous to the Publick Business,
it was expected it should be fully decided by the
House of Commons: To this End the Mem∣bers
of both Companies, with all the Trick,
Artifice, Cunning and Corruption, that Mo∣ney
and Interest could arm them with, be∣stirred
themselves to be chosen Members.</P>
<P>Brokers rid Night and Day from one End of
the Kingdom to the other, to engage Gentle∣men
to bribe Corporations, to buy off Compe∣titors,
and to manage the Elections. You
will see the State of Things at that Time, and
the Danger this Stock jobbing Wickedness had
brought the Publick to, if you please to read
the following Exclamation of the honest Free∣holders
at that Time, which was presented
to the Publick by way of Complaint: The
Thing was laid before the King first, and be∣fore
the Parliament afterwards; and it
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
was his Majesty's Sense of the Consequence,
that made him resolve to bring the two <HI>East-India</HI>
Companies to unite their Stocks, for in
a word, the Stock-Jobbers embroil'd the whole
Nation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'The grand Work which the whole Nation
is now intent upon, is chusing their Repre∣sentatives
in Parliament, chusing Men to
meet, and advise with the King about the
most important Affairs of the Kingdom.'</P>
<P>'And while all Men ought to be fixing their
Eyes upon such Men as are best qualified to
sit in that Place of Honour, and to examine
who are fittest to be entrusted with the Re∣ligion
and Peace of <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps of
all <HI>Europe.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence
of two <HI>East-India</HI> Companies, as if the Interest
of either Company were to be nam'd in the
Day with the <HI>Protestant Religion, and the publick
Peace,</HI> or as if they, who are fit to be Repre∣sentatives
of the People in the great Matters
of Peace and War, Leagues and Alliances of
Neighbours, Succession of Crowns, and Pro∣tection
of the Protestant Religion, should not
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
be capable of deciding the petty Controversy
in Trade, between two Rival, Companies.'</P>
<P>'The Grand Question ask'd now, when
your Vote is requir'd for a Parliament-Man,
is not as it ought to be; Is he a Man of <HI>Sense,</HI>
of <HI>Religion,</HI> of <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Estate?</HI>'</P>
<P>'But, What Company is he for, the New,
or the Old?'</P>
<P>'As this Stock-Jobbing in its own Nature,
is only a new Invented sort of <HI>Deceptio Visus,</HI>
a <HI>Legerdemain</HI> in Trade; so mix'd with
Trick and Cheat, that 'twould puzzle a good
<HI>Logician</HI> to make it out by <HI>Syllogism:</HI> So no∣thing
can be more Fatal in <HI>England</HI> to our
present Constitution, and which in time
may be so to our Liberty and Religion, than
to have the Interests of Elections Jobb'd upon
Exchange for Money, and Transferr'd like
<HI>East-India</HI> Stock, for those who bid most.'</P>
<P>'By this Method, the Country Gentlemen
may sit at home; and only Corresponding
with the Brokers at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s and <HI>Garway</HI>'s
as the Prizes Rise or Fall, may dispose of
their Interests in the Towns they can Go∣vern, at as good a rate as they can.'</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
'The Citizens, or such who have their seve∣ral
Companies and Interest to Serve, will ease
themselves of the Expence of Travelling,
with the fine borrow'd Equipages before men∣tioned
, and only go to Market in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
and Buy an Election, as the <HI>Stock-Jobber</HI>
and they shall agree, which Election
shall be manag'd by the Country Gentleman,
who is to have his Bargain, no Purchase no
Pay, and is to go thro' with it, or else he
gets none of the Money.'</P>
<P>'Elections of Parliament-men are in a hope∣ful
way; and Parliaments themselves are in
a hopeful way by this concise Method of
Practice, to come under the absolute manages
ment of a few Hands, and no doubt things
will go on accordingly.'</P>
<P>'Banks and Stocks may be lay'd up, and
employ'd in a short time, for the purcha∣sing
the Interest of Gentlemen, and our Gen∣try
being willing to get a Penny in an <HI>Honest-way,</HI>
as we say, will but too often sell their
Interests, and their Country too, especially
such Gentlemen, whose Estates are reduc'd
to an occasion for it.'</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>
'The <HI>Stock-Jobbers,</HI> who care not a Farthing
which Side gets the better, but make a Prey
of them both, have set up this new Trade of
Jobbing for Elections: And that the way of
their Proceeding may be a little plainer un∣derstood,
We desire you to read the Copy of

<P>THE Elections for a New Parliament being

there, and can put in whom you please; and
finding by your last you purpose to Decline it your

<SALUTE>To the Honourable

</LETTER>
<P>Postcript.<Q REND="inline"><P>'<HI>IF Sir <HI>E, F, G, H,</HI> will dispose of his Interest
in the Town of — I can help him to
very good Terms.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom
this Proposal was made, rejected it with Dis∣dain
yet the Attempt is made very Plain in
the Case.'</P>
<P>'And we are inform'd that the Number of
Members come down into the Countries, on
such Accounts, are incredible.'</P>
<P>'Wherefore we think it very needful to pub∣lish
our Resentments at such a Practice, and to
protest against it in this our Honest <HI>Plea,</HI> as
an indirect, wicked and pernicious Practice,
and which may be of very ill consequence to
the Nation.'</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53"/>
'If <HI>Stock-Jobbing</HI> of Elections be the first
step, in all probability <HI>Stock-Jobbing</HI> of Votes
will be the second; for he that will give a
Thousand Pounds, or more, only for a power
to Vote, expects to get something by Voting,
or gives away his Money for nothing.'</P>
<P>'What shall we say then, if a League of
Confederacy shou'd be made between our
<HI>Parliament-Solicitors,</HI> and our <HI>Stock-Jobbing
Brokers,</HI> two sort of People equally mercenary
and Deceitful.'</P>
<P>'We desire to know, whether 'twould not
be more fatal to <HI>England</HI> than the New War
with <HI>Spain,</HI> which all <HI>Europe</HI> seems to be so
much disturb'd at.'</P>
<P>'To all Men whose Eyes are to be open'd
with Reason and Argument, it shou'd be
enough to fill them with abhorrence to think
that the Scandalous Mechanick, Upstart Mi¦stery
of Job-broking should thus grow upon
the Nation; that ever the <HI>English</HI> Nation
shou'd suffer themselves to be Impos'd on by
the New invented ways of a few Needy Mer∣cinaries,
who can turn all Trade into a Lot∣tery
, and make the <HI>Exchange</HI> a Gaming
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
Table: A thing, which like the Imaginary
Coins of Foreign Nations, have no reality in
themselves; but are plac'd as things which
stand to be Calculated, and reduc'd into Va∣lue
, a Trade, made up of Sharp and Trick,
and Manag'd with Impudence and Banter.'</P>
<P>'That Six or Eight Men shall Combine to∣gether
, and by pretended Buying or Selling
among themselves, raise or sink the Stock of
the <HI>E. India</HI> Company, to what extravagant
pitch of Price they will; so to wheedle others
sometimes to Buy, sometimes to Sell, as
their occasions require; and with so little re∣gard
to Intrinsick Value, or the Circumstances
of the Company, that when the Company
has a Loss, Stock shall Rise; when a great
Sale, or a Rich Ship arriv'd, it shall Fall:
Sometimes run the Stock down to 35<HI>l.</HI> other
times up to 150<HI>l.</HI> and by this Method Buy
and Sell so much, that 'tis thought there are
few of the Noted Stock-Jobbers, but what
have bought and sold more Stock than both
the Companies possess.'</P>
<P>'Thus let them Jobb, Trick, and Cheat
one another; and let them be bubbl'd by
them that knows no better; but for God's sake
Gentlemen don't let the Important Affairs
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
of the State come under their wicked
clutches.'</P>
<P>'Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parlia∣ment
and then chuse Members to Vote for
them. If Fate and <HI>Popish</HI> Confederacies, and
Union of <HI>Popish</HI> Powers abroad threaten us,
let us alone to struggle with them, and have
Fair Law, and Honourable Conditions for it;
but to be Bought and Sold, to have our Ele∣ctions
of Members, and our Laws, Liberties
and Estates Stock-jobb'd away, is intolera∣ble.'</P></Q></P>
<P>I said above, that the Parliament put a
Check to this Practice afterwards by several
Acts; and the late Act for suspending the Tri∣ennial
Bill has at present laid it a ssep; but
how far the Practice may revive when a new
Election shall come on, who knows? Never
was more Knaves or more Money in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
and never more needy Gentlemen to
assist the Purchasers. How necessary 'tis to
prevent them, let any one judge.</P>
<P>Besides, what shall we say to the encroaching
Nature of Immortal Avarice? Has not that
eminent <HI>C—,</HI> of whom at large above
Stock-jobb'd the very Publick it self, as I may
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
say, and the very House of Commons; for job∣bing
their Funds before they are laid; Stock-jobbing
their Tickets before the Lottery was
found, may in some Sense be call'd Stock-job∣bing
the House: If then they will even before
the Members Faces, jobb their depending Acts,
and that too before they are pass'd; shall we
doubt but they will Stock-jobb the Elections
of another Parliament when this is gone
Home?</P>
<P>It is evident, that at present, not being able
to avoid preying upon their Country, they
have been tampering Abroad; Foreign Alarms
is the present Commodity at Market; Choice
of Members may be the next; till in time,
by Strength of Money, they may <HI>Stock-jobb</HI>
Religion, Property, Constitution and Succes∣sion;
for nothing can come amiss to them, if
they can but get Money by it; for if the same
Avarice reigns among them that 'tis evident
is their Guide now, they would with the same
Facility jobb for the Nation, and without any
Scruple, make a Transfer of King <HI>George</HI> and
his Crown for a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the Value,
to whoever bids the Money.</P>
<P>There was a Book publish'd some Years ago,
and when the Stock-jobbing People were thought
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
as willing, yet not quite so daring or so cun∣ning
as they are now; it was Entitled, <HI>The
Villany of the Stock-jobbers.</HI> Indeed it set them
out in their true Colours, and for some time
gave them a little Shock; for the Truth was,
they jobb'd King <HI>William</HI> and the Government
at that Time at such a Rate, that in spight of
the Invincible Valour and Resolution of the
Soldiery, in spight of the most Glorious Prince
and most Vigilant General the World had
ever seen; yet the Enemy gain'd upon us every
Year; the Funds were run down, the Credit
jobb'd away in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> the King and
his Troops devoured by Mechanicks, and sold
to Usury, Tallies lay bundled up like <HI>Bath</HI>
Faggots in the Hands of Brokers and Stock-job∣bers
; the Parliament gave Taxes, laid Funds,
but the Loans were at the Mercy of those Men;
and they shew'd their Mercy indeed, by devour∣ing
the King and the Army, the Parliament,
and indeed the whole Nation, bringing that
Great Prince sometimes to that Exigence, thro'
unexpressible Extortions that were put upon him,
that he has even gone into the Field without
his Equipage, nay, even without his Army;
the Regiments have been uncloathed when the
King has been in the Field, and the willing
brave <HI>English</HI> Spirits, eager to honour their
Country, and follow such a King, have march∣ed
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
even to Battle, without either Stockings or
Shoes, while his Servants have been every Day
working in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> to get his own Mo∣ney
of the Stock-Jobbers, even after all the
horrible Demands of Discount have been al∣lowed
; and at last, scarce 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of the
Money granted by Parliament has come into
the Exchequer, and that late, too late for that
Service, and by Driblets, till the King has
been tir'd with the Delay, and been even ready
to give up the Cause.</P>
<P>We have just now had a Test of their Cun∣ning
on the Subject of the Invasion: These
were the Men that made the first Advantage of
the News; immediately those that were to
put Stock upon any Man at a high Price, ten∣der
'd it, the Accepters, forc'd by the Demand,
call in their Money on every Hand, pay the
Difference, the Price falls, a general Run upon
the Bank follows, and Stock-jobbing began it.</P>
<P>Say this was no Design, yet if every Alarm
of the Foolish or the Timerous, or the False,
is capable to set the Humour afloat by the
Agency of <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> then <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
is as dangerous to the Publick Safety, as a
Magazine of Gun-powder is to a populous
City.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>
But if it be by Design, then, when-ever the
Pretender is to be pawn'd upon us by any Fo∣reign
Power that can but talk of lending 5 or
6000 Men, our Publick Credit is at his Mer∣cy
, by the Agency of <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> and the
Brokers.</P>
<P>The Story of the Invasion from <HI>Spain,</HI> we
hope, is now over: Indeed at the Worst, I saw
no such Reason to be surprized to that Degree,
as was the Case here. Let us look back and see
what Injury to the Publick has the very Ru∣mour
been? What Damage to Credit! What
Stop to Trade! What Interruption to our Gene∣ral
Commerce! besides sinking above a Million
Sterling upon our Estates; and every Farthing
of this is occasion'd by the <HI>Stock-jobbers,</HI> and in
the Consequences of their Contrivances, and by
no other Means; for as to the Design of an In∣vasion,
or that they resolv'd to come hither at
all, tho' we have evident Proofs of that, because
some of them have been actually landed; yet
we cannot yet resolve the Question positively,
whether it was ever worth our being so much
alarm'd as we have been in <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>Even this Way it appears, that these Stock-Jobbers
are dangerous to the Peace, since 'tis
in their Power to set a Rate when-ever they
please, not only upon private Estates, but
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
even upon the whole Nation, and in that Ca∣pacity
it is to be hoped, the Parliament, who
have hitherto redress'd the Publick Grievances,
will take care of these People in particular, and
deliver the Publick from such a Set of Men as
are more fatal to them, than a Midnight Fire,
more dangerous than an Enemy Embark'd,
nay, I had almost said, than an Enemy
Landed.</P>
<P>For, in a word, these Men take upon them
to put a Standard upon our Fears; and we
are to ask them, when Intelligence comes from
Abroad, whether any thing be to be slighted
or apprehended; every publick Piece of News,
every Menace of the Nation's Enemies is to re∣ceive
its Weight from them; and the Price of
Stocks is the Rule by which we are to guide
our Judgment in Publick Affairs, by which
we are either to hope or to fear when any
thing amiss present it self to our View.</P>
<P>Is this an Advantage fit to be put into the
Hand of a Subject? Are the King's Affairs to
go up and down as they please, and the Credit
of his Majesty's Councils rise and fall as these
Men shall please to value them? This would
be making them Kings, and making the King
Subject to the Caprice of their private Interst,
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
his Affairs be liable to be rated in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
and to be run down as they pleased;
an Article, which as the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, in
the first Politicks of the Church, made all the
Kings of the Earth become Pensioners to the
Priests, so it would make all the Kings of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
Pensioners to <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>It must be confess'd, it looks as if this were
the present View in the Manner which Stock-Jobbing
now goes on; and there are more
Mischiefs in it than perhaps we are aware of,
the Extremes either way seem dangerous
enough, for Example,</P>
<P>If one way the Stock-Jobbers manage the
Publick, they scandalously subject the Govern∣ment
, the Ministers of State, the Publick
Credit, nay, even the Elections of Parliament
to their Orders: So if a Government should
come absolutely to get the Management of the
Stock-Jobbers, it might be many Ways fatal
to the Peoples Interest, and indeed put the
Purse-Strings of the Nation so much into the
Hands of a Ministry, that if they did not at
any time command the general Treasure, and be
able to raise what Money they pleas'd without
a Parliament, they would be able to add what
Value they pleased to the Funds given, raise
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
them when they pleas'd to draw Money in,
and sink them when they pleased to issue Mo∣ney
out: That in a word, the Rate of Stocks
should be settled every Day in the <HI>Exchequer;</HI>
and tho' they might not be said to stand no more
in need of Parliaments, it would be most cer∣tain
, that they would not stand in so much
need of Parliaments as they used to do, and
as it is convenient for us they should do.</P>
<P>I must run out a great Length in the Enume∣ration
of the Mischief to the Liberty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
which might attend such a Thing as
this; and tho' at present it may be objected,
that it is unreasonable, and entirely needless,
because we are under a King that stands in
need of no Artifices, and is too just to attempt
any Encroachment on the Liberties of his
People, and a Ministry, who we have reason
to hope are above taking any such mean Steps;
yet if ever a Time shall come again, when eve∣ry
Politick Step shall be enquired after to bring
Grist to the Publick Mill, and every way that
can be found practicable, shall be thought ju∣stifiable;
then let you Citizens of <HI>London</HI> have
a care of a Bear-skin-Court, and a Stock-Job∣bing
Ministry, when <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> shall be
transpos'd to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and States-men
shall make a Property of the Brokers.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63"/>
This is indeed a Thing remote, and as I say
above, there is no Danger of its happening in
this Reign, so it may never happen at all: But
as I also say, without the least Reflection upon
our present Government, that such a Time may
come, and such a Thing may happen; so I af∣firm
, the State of Things ought forthwith to be
annihilated if possible, which is but in its Na∣ture
capable of being thus perverted, and we
ought not to leave our Posterity in a Condition
to be devoured by such Caterpillars, if it be in
our Power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Why may not any collected Stock of Money,
such as that we have mention'd before, to be in
the Management of the <HI>Birchin-Lane Company,</HI>
be manag'd in the Hands of Courtiers, as well
as of Citizens; Ministers of State, as well as
Inhabitants of <HI>Hackney;</HI> and to how many more
unlucky Purposes may such Men apply that
Power? These Men indeed proceed, with Trick
and Cunning, to amass great Estates, and to
enrich themselves and their Families out of the
Spoils of the People, their Neighbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
in this we think they cannot have too much of
our just Satyr bestow'd upon them; but if this
Engine of Jobbing should once come into the
Hands of Ministers of State; if a degenerated
Government should come to use it, as such a
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
Government may be supposed to be able to do,
what Mischiefs may they not bring upon the
Nation? And what may they not be able to
do, if their Designs are but wicked enough to
push them on?</P>
<P>It would be hard to say to what Length this
Jobbing Trade might be extended, especially
whereby the Advantage of a punctual Manage∣ment,
the publick Credit has so far gain'd upon
the People, as to bring the Rate of Funds and
Stocks to exceed the Intrinsick Value, and to
keep upon an Advance: What may not a
Government, who has the Command of Mo∣ney,
do in the particular Art of Screwing up,
or Screwing down the publick Interests and
Securities?</P>
<P>'Tis a copious Subject, our <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Men understand it well enough; and if they
were put to give their Opinions, and had Ho∣nesty
enough to speak the Truth against their
Interest, they would acknowledge their Trade
is capable of ruining ten Nations, if it was
carried on to the full Extent of it.</P>
<P>While these Sheets were at the Press, we had
another little Test of their Knavery to the
Publick; and it is not at all owing to them, that
the Thing run no further; the contrary Winds
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
and Storms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had disappointed the King's
Enemies, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet was driven back
to <HI>Spain</HI> in a shatter'd and defeated Condition,
as appears by the Publick Account of those
Things: But in the Interval of this News,
came an Account on the other Hand, that some
of the Party were arriv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they
had beat it up, notwithstanding all the Oppo∣sition
of Nature, the Hindrances of Winds
and Seas; immediately Stocks fell Two <HI>per Cent.</HI>
nor did the good News of the Defeated return
of the rest animate these Men to keep up the
Interest, by which it appears, that they are
acted more by the bad Principle than by the
good; that they choose rather to do Evil than
to do Good: that they sink faster than they
rise, and are willinger to do Harm than Good
to the Government.</P>
<P>From whence I infer, that the Government,
looking upon them as they really are, rather
Enemies than Friends to the General Interest,
should rather encline to root them out, than
preserve them. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
