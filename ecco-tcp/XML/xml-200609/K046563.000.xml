<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P>PERHAPS it may be necessary to in∣form
the Public, that not long since an
Examination of the Fifteenth and Six∣teenth
Chapters of the History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire was published
by Mr. Davis. He styles himself a Bachelor
of Arts, and a Member of Baliol College in the
University of Oxford. His title-page is a de∣claration
of war, and in the prosecution of his
religious crusade, he assumes a privilege of
disregarding the ordinary laws which are re∣spected
in the most hostile transactions between
civilized men or civilized nations. Some of
the harshest epithets in the English language
are repeatedly applied to the historian, a part
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
of whose work Mr. Davis has chosen for the
object of his criticism. To this author Mr.
Davis imputes the crime of betraying the con∣fidence
and seducing the faith of those readers,
who may heedlessly stray in the flowery paths
of his diction, without perceiving the poisonous
snake that lurks concealed in the grass. <HI>Latet
anguis in herbâ.</HI> The Examiner has assumed the
province of reminding them of <Q REND="inline">the unfair
proceedings of such an insidious friend, who
offers the deadly draught in a golden cup,
that they may be less sensible of the danger<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis, Preface, p. ii.</NOTE>.
In order to which, Mr. Davis has selected
several of the more notorious instances of his
misrepresentations and errors; reducing them
to their respective heads, and subjoining a
long list of almost incredible inaccuracies:
and such striking proofs of servile plagiarism,
as the world will be surprised to meet with
in an author who puts in so bold a claim to
originality and extensive reading<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Preface, p. iii.</NOTE>?</Q> Mr.
Davis prosecutes this attack through an octavo
volume of not less than two hundred and eighty-four
pages with the same implacable spirit, per∣petually
charges his adversary with perverting
the ancients, and transcribing the moderns;
and inconsistently enough imputes to him the
opposite crimes of art and carelessness, of gross
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
ignorance and of wilful falsehood. The Exa∣miner
closes his work<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 282, 283.</NOTE> with a severe reproof of
those feeble critics who have allowed any share
of knowledge to an odious antagonist. He pre∣sumes
to pity and to condemn the first historian
of the present age, for the generous approba∣tion
which he had bestowed on a writer who is
content that Mr. Davis should be his enemy,
whilst he has a right to name Dr. Robertson
for his friend.</P>
<P>When I delivered to the world the First Vo∣lume
of an important History, in which I had
been obliged to connect the progress of Chris∣tianity
with the civil state and revolutions of
the Roman Empire, I could not be ignorant
that the result of my inquiries might offend the
interest of some and the opinions of others. If
the whole work was favourably received by the
Public, I had the more reason to expect that
this obnoxious part would provoke the zeal
of those who consider themselves as the
Watchmen of the Holy City. These expecta∣tions
were not disappointed; and a fruitful
crop of Answers, Apologies, Remarks, Exa∣minations,
&amp;c. sprung up with all convenient
speed. As soon as I saw the advertisement, I
generally sent for them; for I have never af∣fected,
indeed I have never understood, the
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
stoical apathy, the proud contempt of criti∣cism,
which some authors have publicly pro∣fessed.
Fame is the motive, it is the reward,
of our labours; nor can I easily comprehend
how it is possible that we should remain cold
and indifferent with regard to the attempts
which are made to deprive us of the most va∣luable
object of our possessions, or at least of
our hopes. Besides this strong and natural
impulse of curiosity, I was prompted by the
more laudable desire of applying to my own,
and the public, benefit, the well-grounded cen∣sures
of a learned adversary; and of correcting
those faults which the indulgence of vanity and
friendship had suffered to escape without obser∣vation.
I read with attention several criticisms
which were published against the Two last Chap∣ters
of my History, and unless I much deceive
myself, I weighed them in my own mind with∣out
prejudice and without resentment. After
I had clearly satisfied myself that their principal
objections were founded on misrepresentation or
mistake, I declined with sincere and disinte∣rested
reluctance the odious task of controversy,
and almost formed a tacit resolution of com∣mitting
my intentions, my writings, and my
adversaries to the judgment of the Public, of
whose favourable disposition I had received the
most flattering proofs.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The reasons which justified my silence were
obvious and forcible: the respectable nature of
the subject itself, which ought not to be lightly
violated by the rude hand of controversy; the
inevitable tendency of dispute, which soon de∣generates
into minute and personal altercation;
the indifference of the Public for the discussion
of such questions as neither relate to the busi∣ness
nor the amusement of the present age. I
calculated the possible loss of temper and the
certain loss of time, and considered, that while
I was laboriously engaged in a humiliating task,
which could add nothing to my own reputa∣tion,
or to the entertainment of my readers, I
must interrupt the prosecution of a work which
claimed my whole attention, and which the
Public, or at least my friends, seemed to re∣quire
with some impatience at my hands. The
judicious lines of Dr. Young sometimes offered
themselves to my memory, and I felt the truth
of his observation, That every author lives or
dies by his own pen, and that the unerring
sentence of Time assigns its proper rank to every
composition and to every criticism, which it
preserves from oblivion.</P>
<P>I should have consulted my own ease, and
perhaps I should have acted in stricter confor∣mity
to the rules of prudence, if I had still
persevered in patient silence. But Mr. Davis
may, if he pleases, assume the merit of extort∣ing
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
from me the notice which I had refused to
more honourable foes. I had declined the
consideration of their <HI>literary Objections</HI>; but he
has compelled me to give an answer to his <HI>crimi∣nal
Accusations.</HI> Had he confined himself to the
ordinary, and indeed obsolete charges of impi∣ous
principles, and criminal intentions, I should
have acknowledged with readiness and pleasure
that the religion of Mr. Davis appeared to be
very different from mine. Had he contented
himself with the use of that style which decency
and politeness have banished from the more
liberal part of mankind, I should have smiled,
perhaps with some contempt, but without the
least mixture of anger or resentment. Every
animal employs the note, or cry, or howl,
which is peculiar to its species; every man ex∣presses
himself in the dialect the most congenial
to his temper and inclination, the most fami∣liar
to the company in which he has lived, and
to the authors with whom he is conversant;
and while I was disposed to allow that Mr.
Davis had made some proficiency in Ecclesi∣astical
Studies, I should have considered the
difference of our language and manners as an
unsurmountable bar of separation between us.
Mr. Davis has overleaped that bar, and forces
me to contend with him on the very dirty
ground which he has chosen for the scene of
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
our combat. He has judged, I know not with
how much propriety, that the support of a cause,
which would disclaim such unworthy assistance,
depended on the ruin of my moral and literary
character. The different misrepresentations,
of which he has drawn out the ignominious ca∣talogue,
would materially affect my credit as
an historian, my reputation as a scholar, and
even my honour and veracity as a gentleman.
If I am indeed incapable of understanding
what I read, I can no longer claim a place
among those writers who merit the esteem and
confidence of the Public. If I am capable of
wilfully perverting what I understand, I no
longer deserve to live in the society of those
men, who consider a strict and inviolable ad∣herence
to truth, as the foundation of every
thing that is virtuous or honourable in human
nature. At the same time, I am not insensible
that his mode of attack has given a transient
pleasure to my enemies, and a transient uneasi∣ness
to my friends. The size of his volume,
the boldness of his assertions, the acrimony of
his style, are contrived with tolerable skill to
confound the ignorance and candour of his
readers. There are few who will examine the
truth or justice of his accusations; and of those
persons who have been directed by their edu∣cation
to the study of ecclesiastical antiquity,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
many will believe, or will affect to believe;
that the success of their champion has been
equal to his zeal, and that the <HI>serpent</HI> pierced
with an hundred wounds lies expiring at his
feet. Mr. Davis's book <HI>will</HI> cease to be read
(perhaps the grammarians may already reproach
me for the use of an improper tense); but the
oblivion towards which it seems to be hasten∣ing,
will afford the more ample scope for the
artful practices of those, who may not scruple
to affirm, or rather to insinuate, that Mr.
Gibbon was publickly convicted of falsehood
and misrepresentation; that the evidence pro∣duced
against him was unanswerable; and that
his silence was the effect and the proof of con∣scious
guilt. Under the hands of a malicious
surgeon, the sting of a wasp may continue to
fester and inflame, long after the vexatious
little insect has left its venom and its life in the
wound.</P>
<P>The defence of my own honour is undoubt∣edly
the first and prevailing motive which urges
me to repel with vigour an unjust and unpro∣voked
attack; and to undertake a tedious
vindication, which, after the perpetual re∣petition
of the vainest and most disgusting
of the pronouns, will only prove that <HI>I</HI>
am innocent; and that Mr. Davis, in his
charge, has very frequently subscribed his
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
own condemnation. And yet I may presume
to affirm, that the Public have some interest in
this controversy. They have some interest to
know whether the writer whom they have ho∣noured
with their favour is deserving of their
confidence, whether they must content them∣selves
with reading the History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire as a <HI>tale amusing
enough,</HI> or whether they may venture to receive
it as a fair and authentic history. The general
persuasion of mankind, that where <HI>much</HI> has
been positively asserted, <HI>something</HI> must be true,
may contribute to encourage a secret suspicion,
which would naturally diffuse itself over the
whole body of the work. Some of those friends
who may now tax me with imprudence for
taking this public notice of Mr. Davis's book,
have perhaps already condemned me for silently
acquiescing under the weight of such serious,
such direct, and such circumstantial imputa∣tions.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, who in the last page of his<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 284.</NOTE> Work
appears to have recollected that modesty is an
amiable and useful qualification, affirms, that
his plan required only that he should consult
the authors to whom he was directed by my
references; and that the judgment of riper
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
years was not so necessary to enable him to
execute with success the pious labour to which
he had devoted his pen. Perhaps before we
separate, a moment to which I most servently
aspire, Mr. Davis may find that a mature judg∣ment
is indispensably requisite for the successful
execution of <HI>any</HI> work of literature, and more
especially of criticism. Perhaps he will dis∣cover,
that a young student who hastily con∣sults
an unknown author, on a subject with
which he is unacquainted, cannot always be
guided by the most accurate reference to the
knowledge of the sense, as well as to the sight
of the passage which has been quoted by his
adversary. Abundant proofs of these maxims
will hereafter be suggested. For the present,
I shall only remark, that it is my intention to
pursue in my defence the order, or rather
the course, which Mr. Davis has marked out
in his Examination; and that I have num∣bered
the several articles of my impeachment
according to the most natural division of the
subject. And now let me proceed on this
hostile march over a dreary and barren desert,
where thirst, hunger, and intolerable weari∣ness,
are much more to be dreaded, than the
arrows of the enemy.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUOTA∣TIONS IN GENERAL.</NOTE>
<P><Q REND="inline">The remarkable mode of quotation which
Mr. Gibbon adopts must immediately strike
every one who turns to his notes. He some∣times
only mentions the author, perhaps the
book; and often leaves the reader the toil
of finding out, or rather guessing at the pas∣sage.
The policy, however, is not without
its design and use. By endeavouring to de∣prive
us of the means of comparing him with
the authorities he cites, he flattered himself,
no doubt, that he might safely have recourse
to <HI>misrepresentation</HI><NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, Preface, p. ii.</NOTE>.</Q> Such is the style of
Mr. Davis; who in another place<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 230.</NOTE> mentions
this mode of quotation <Q REND="inline">as a good artifice to
escape detection;</Q> and applauds, with an
agreeable irony, his own labours in turning
over a <HI>few</HI> pages of the Theodosian Code.</P>
<P>I shall not descend to animadvert on the rude
and illiberal strain of this passage, and I will
frankly own that my indignation is lost in asto∣nishment.
The Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chap∣ters
of my History are illustrated by three
hundred and eighty-three Notes; and the
nakedness of a few Notes, which are not ac∣companied
by any quotation, is amply com∣pensated
by a much greater number, which
contain two, three, or perhaps four distinct
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
references; so that upon the whole my stock
of quotations which support and justify my
facts cannot amount to less than eight hundred
or a thousand. As I had often felt the incon∣venience
of the loose and general method of
quoting which is so falsely imputed to me, I
have carefully distinguished the <HI>books,</HI> the <HI>chap∣ters,</HI>
the <HI>sections,</HI> the <HI>pages</HI> of the authors to
whom I referred, with a degree of accuracy and
attention, which might claim some gratitude,
as it has seldom been so regularly practised by
any historical writers. And here I must con∣fess
some obligation to Mr. Davis, who, by
staking my credit and his own on a circum∣stance
so obvious and palpable, has given me
so early an opportunity of submitting the merits
of our cause, or at least of our characters, to
he judgment of the Public. Hereafter,
when I am summoned to defend myself
against the imputation of misquoting the text,
or misrepresenting the sense of a Greek or La∣tin
author, it will not be in my power to com∣municate
the knowledge of the languages, or
the possession of the books, to those readers
who may be destitute either of one or of the
other, and the part which <HI>they</HI> are obliged to
take between assertions equally strong and per∣emptory,
may sometimes be attended with
doubt and hesitation. But in the present in∣stance,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
every reader who will give himself the
trouble of consulting the First Volume of my
History, is a competent judge of the question.
I exhort, I solicit him to run his eye down
the coloumns of Notes, and to count <HI>how many</HI>
of the quotations are minute and particular,
<HI>how few</HI> are vague and general. When he has
satisfied himself by this easy computation,
there <HI>is</HI> a word which may naturally suggest it∣self;
an epithet, which I should be sorry either
to deserve or use; the boldness of Mr. Davis's
assertion, and the confidence of my appeal will
tempt, nay, perhaps, will force him to apply
that epithet either to one or to the other of the
adverse parties.</P>
<P>I have confessed that a critical eye may dis∣cover
<HI>some</HI> loose and general references; but as
they bear a very <HI>inconsiderable</HI> proportion to the
whole mass, they cannot support, or even ex∣cuse
a false and ungenerous accusation, which
must reflect dishonour either on the object or
on the author of it. If the examples in which
I have occasionally deviated from my ordinary
practice were specified and examined, I am
persuaded that they might always be fairly attri∣buted
to some one of the following reasons.
1. In some <HI>rare</HI> instances, which I have never
attempted to conceal, I have been obliged to
adopt quotations which were expressed with
less accuracy than I could have wished. 2. I
may have accidentally recollected the sense of a
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
passage which I had formerly read, without
being able to find the place, or even to tran∣scribe
from memory the precise words. 3. The
whole tract (as in a remarkable instance of the
second Apology of Justin Martyr) was so short,
that a more particular description was not re∣quired.
4. The form of the composition sup∣plied
the want of a local reference; the pre∣ceding
mention of the <HI>year</HI> fixed the passage of
of the annalist, and the reader was guided to
the proper spot in the commentaries of Grotius,
Valesius or Godefroy, by the more accurate cita∣tion
of their original author. 5. The idea which
I was desirous of communicating to the reader,
was sometimes the general result of the author
or treatise that I had quoted; nor was it pos∣sible
to confine, within the narrow limits of a
particular reference, the sense or spirit which
was mingled with the whole mass. These mo∣tives
are either laudable or at least innocent.
In two of these exceptions my ordinary mode
of citation was superfluous; in the other three
it was impracticable.</P>
<P>In quoting a comparison which Tertullian
had used to express the rapid increase of the
Marcionites, I expressly declared that I was
obliged to quote it from memory<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon's History, p. 551. I shall usually refer to the third edition, unless there are any various readings.</NOTE> If I have
been guilty of comparing them to <HI>bees</HI> instead
of <HI>wasps,</HI> I can however most sincerely disclaim
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
the sagacious suspicion of Mr. Davis<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 144.</NOTE>, who
imagines that I was tempted to amend the
simile of Tertullian from an improper partiality
for those odious Heretics.</P>
<P>A rescript of Diocletian, which declared <HI>the</HI>
old law (not <HI>an</HI> old law<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 593.</NOTE>), had been alleged by
me on the respectable authority of Fra-Paolo.
The Examiner, who thinks that he has turned
over the pages of the Theodosian Code, in∣forms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 230.</NOTE> his reader that it may be found, l. vi.
tit. xxiv. leg. 8.; he will be surprised to learn
that this rescript could not be <HI>found</HI> in a code
where it does not exist, but that it may distinctly
be read in the same number, the same title, and
the same book of the CODE OF JUSTINIAN. He
who is severe should at least be just: yet I
should probably have disdained this minute ani∣madversion,
unless it had served to display the
general ignorance of the critic in the History
of the Roman Jurisprudence. If Mr. Davis
had not been an absolute stranger, the most
treacherous guide could not have persuaded
that a rescript of Diocletian was to be found in
the Theodosian Code, which was designed only
to preserve the laws of Constantine and his suc∣cessors.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">ERRORS OF THE PRESE.</NOTE>
<P>Few objects are below the notice of Mr.
Davis, and his criticism is never so formidable
as when it is directed against the guilty cor∣rector
of the press, who on some occasions has
shewn himself negligent of my fame and of his
own. Some errors have arisen from the omis∣sion
of letters; from the confusion of cyphers,
which perhaps were not very distinctly marked
in the original manuscript. The <HI>two</HI> of the
Roman, and the <HI>eleven</HI> of the Arabic, numerals
have been unfortunately mistaken for each
other; the similar forms of a 2 and a 3, a 5
and a 6, a 3 and a 8, have improperly been
transposed; Antolycus for Autolycus, Idolatria
for Idololatria, Holsterius for Holstenius, had
escaped my own observation, as well as
the diligence of the person who was em∣ployed
to revise the sheets of my History.
These important errors, from the indulgence
of a deluded Public, have been multiplied in
the numerous impressions of three different
editions; and for the present I can only lament
my own defects, whilst I deprecate the wrath of
Mr. Davis, who seems ready to infer that I
cannot either read or write. I sincerely ad∣mire
his patient industry, which I despair of
being able to imitate; but if a future edition
should ever be required, I could wish to ob∣tain,
on any reasonable terms, the services of
so useful a corrector.</P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="article">

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DIFFER∣ENCE OF EDITIONS.</NOTE>
<P>Mr. Davis had been directed by my refer∣ences
to several passages of Optatus Milevita∣nus<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 73.</NOTE>, and of the Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique of
M. Dupin<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 132—136.</NOTE>. He eagerly consults those places,
is unsuccessful, and is happy. Sometimes the
place which I have quoted does not offer any
of the circumstances which I had alleged,
sometimes only a few; and sometimes the same
passage exhibit a sense totally adverse and re∣pugnant
to mine. These shameful misrepre∣sentations
incline Mr. Davis to suspect that I
have never consulted the original (not even
of a common French book!) and he asserts
his right to censure my presumption. These
important charges from two distinct articles in
the list of <HI>Misrepresentations</HI>; but Mr. Davis
has amused himself with adding to the slips of
the pen or of the press, some complaints of
his ill success, when he attempted to verify my
quotations from Cyprian and from Shaw's
Travels<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 151. 155.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The success of Mr. Davis would indeed have
been somewhat extraordinary, unless he had
consulted the same <HI>editions,</HI> as well as the same
places. I shall content myself with mention∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
the editions which I have used, and with
assuring him, that if he renews his search, he
will not, or rather, that he will be, disap∣pointed.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">JEWISH HISTORY, TACITUS,</NOTE>
<P>The nature of my subject had led me to
mention, not the real origin of the Jews, but
their first <HI>appearance</HI> to the eyes of other na∣tions;
and I cannot avoid transcribing the short
passage in which I had introduced them.
<Q REND="inline">The Jews, who under the Assyrian and Per∣sian
monarchies had languished for many
ages the most despised portion of their
slaves, emerged from their obscurity under
the successors of Alexander. And as they
multiplied to a surprising degree in the East,
and afterwards in the West, they soon ex∣cited
the curiosity and wonder of other na∣tions<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 537.</NOTE>.</Q> This simple abridgment seems in its
turn to have excited the wonder of Mr. Davis,
whose surprise almost renders him eloquent.
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="19" REF="21"/>What a strange assemblage,</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline">is
here. It is like Milton's Chaos, without
bound, without dimension, where time and
place are lost. In short, what does this dis∣play
afford us, but a deal of boyish co∣louring
to the prejudice of much good his∣tory<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 5.</NOTE>.</Q> If I rightly understand Mr. Davis's
language, he censures, as a piece of confused
declamation, the passage which he has pro∣duced
from my history; and if I collect the
angry criticisms which he has scattered over
twenty pages of controversy<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 2—22.</NOTE>, I think I can
discover that there is hardly a period, or even
a word, in this unfortunate passage, which has
obtained the approbation of the Examiner.</P>
<P>As nothing can escape his vigilance, he cen∣sures
me for including the twelve tribes of Is∣rael
under the common appellation of JEWS<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 3.</NOTE>,
and for extending the name of ASSYRIANS to
the subjects of the Kings of Babylon<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 2.</NOTE>; and
again censures me, because some facts which
are affirmed or insinuated in my text, do not
agree with the strict and proper limits which he has
assigned to those national denominations. The
name of <HI>Jews</HI> has indeed been established by the
scepter of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and, in the times
which precede the captivity, it is used in the more
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
general sense with some sort of impropriety;
but surely I am not peculiarly charged with a
fault which has been consecrated by the con∣sent
of twenty centuries, the practice of the
best writers, ancient as well as modern (see
Josephus and Prideaux, even in the titles of
their respective works), and by the usage of mo∣dern
languages, of the Latin, the Greek, and,
if I may credit Reland, of the Hebrew itself
(see Palestin, l. i. c. 6.). With regard to
the other word, that of Assyrians, most as∣suredly
I will not lose myself in the labyrinth
of the Asiatic monarchies before the age of
Cyrus; nor indeed is any more required for
my justification, than to prove that Babylon
was considered as the capital and royal seat of
Assyria. If Mr. Davis were a man of learn∣ing,
I might be morose enough to censure his
ignorance of ancient geography, and to over∣whelm
him under a load of quotations, which
might be collected and transcribed with very
little trouble: But as I <HI>must</HI> suppose that he
has received a classical education, I might have
expected him to have read the first book of
Herodotus, where that historian describes, in
the clearest and most elegant terms, the situ∣ation
and greatness of Babylon: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
(Clio, c. 178.) I may be surprised
that he should be so little conversant with the
Cyropoedia of Xenophon, in the whole course
of which the King of Babylon, the adversary
of the Medes and Persians, is repeatedly men∣tioned
by the style and title of THE ASSYRIAN, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
(l. ii. p. 102, 103, Edit. Hutchinson.) But
there remains something more: and Mr. Davis
must apply the same reproaches of <HI>inaccuracy,</HI>
<HI>if not ignorance,</HI> to the Prophet Isaiah, who,
in the name of Jehovah, announcing the down∣fal
of Babylon and the deliverance of Israel,
declares with an oath; <Q REND="inline">And as I have pur∣posed
the thing shall stand: to crush the
ASSYRIAN in my land, and to trample him
on my mountains. Then shall his yoke de∣part
from off them; and his burthen shall
be removed from off their shoulders.</Q> (Isaiah,
xiv. 24, 25. Lowth's new translation. See
likewise the Bishop's note, p. 98.)</P>
<P>The jealousy which Mr. Davis affects for the
honour of the Jewish people will not suffer him
to allow that they were <HI>slaves</HI> to the conquerors
of the East; and while he acknowledges that
they were tributary and dependent, he seems
desirous of introducing, or even inventing,
some milder expression of the state of vassal∣age
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
and <HI>subservience</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis. p. 6.</NOTE>; from whence Tacitus as∣sumed
the words of <HI>despectissima pars servientium.</HI>
Has Mr. Davis never heard of the distinction
of civil and political slavery? Is he ignorant
that even the natural and victorious subjects of
an Asiatic despot have been deservedly marked
with the opprobrious epithet of slaves by every
writer acquainted with the name and advan∣tage
of freedom? Does he not know that un∣der
such a government, the yoke is imposed
with double weight on the necks of the van∣quished,
as the rigour of tyranny is aggra∣vated
by the abuse of conquest. From the
first invasion of Judaea by the arms of the As∣syrians,
to the subversion of the Persian mo∣narchy
by Alexander, there elapsed a period
of above four hundred years, which included
about twelve ages or generations of the human
race. As long as the Jews asserted their in∣dependence,
they repeatedly suffered every ca∣lamity
which the rage and insolence of a vic∣torious
enemy could inflict; the throne of David
was overturned, the temple and city were re∣duced
to ashes, and the whole land, a circum∣stance
perhaps unparalleled in history, remained
three-score and ten years without inhabitants,
and without cultivation. (2 Chronicles, xxxvi.
21.) According to an institution which has
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
long prevailed in Asia, and particularly in the
Turkish government, the most beautiful and
ingenious youths were carefully educated in
the palace, where superior merit sometimes
introduced these fortunate <HI>slaves</HI> to the favour
of the conqueror, and to the honours of the
state. (See the book and example of Daniel.)
The rest of the unhappy Jews experienced the
hardships of captivity and exile in distant lands,
and while individuals were oppressed, the na∣tion
seemed to be dissolved or annihilated. The
gracious edict of Cyrus was offered to all those
who worshipped the God of Israel in the temple
of Jerusalem; but it was accepted by no more
than forty-two thousand persons of either sex
and of every age, and of these about thirty
thousand derived their origin from the Tribes
of Judah, of Benjamin, and of Levi. (See Ez∣ra,
i. Nehemiah, vii. and Prideaux's Connec∣tions,
vol. i. p. 107. fol. Edit. London, 1718.)
The inconsiderable band of exiles, who returned
to inhabit the land of their fathers, cannot be
computed as the hundred and fiftieth part of
the mighty people, that had been numbered by
the impious rashness of David. After a sur∣vey,
which did not comprehend the Tribes of
Levi and Benjamin, the Monarch was assured
that he reigned over <HI>one million five hundred and
seventy thousand men</HI> that drew sword (2 Chro∣nicles,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
xxi. 1—6), and the country of Judaea
must have contained near seven millions of free
inhabitants. The progress of restoration is
always less rapid than that of destruction; Je∣rusalem,
which had been ruined in a few
months, was rebuilt by the slow and inter∣rupted
labours of a whole century; and the
Jews, who gradually multiplied in their na∣tive
seats, enjoyed a servile and precarious ex∣istence,
which depended on the capricious will
of their master. The books of Ezra and Ne∣hemiah
do not afford a very pleasing view of
their situation under the Persian Empire; and
the book of Esther exhibits a most extraordi∣nary
instance of the degree of estimation in
which they were held at the Court of Susa. A
Minister addressed his King in the following
words, which may be considered as a Com∣mentary
on the <HI>despectissima pars servientium</HI> of
the Roman historian; <Q REND="inline">And Haman said to
King Ahasuerus, there is a certain people
scattered abroad, and dispersed among the
people in all the provinces of thy kingdom;
and their laws are diverse from all people,
neither keep they the King's laws; therefore
it is not for the King's profit to suffer them.
If it please the King let it be written that
they may be destroyed; and I will pay ten
thousand talents of silver to the hands of
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
those that have the charge of the business to
bring it to the King's treasuries. And the
King took his ring from his hand, and gave
it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the
Agagite, the Jews enemy. And the King
said unto Haman, The silver is given unto
thee: the people also, to do with them as
it seemeth good to thee.</Q> (Esther, iii. 8—11.)
This trifling favour was asked by the Minister,
and granted by the Monarch, with an easy in∣difference,
which expressed their contempt for
the lives and fortunes of the Jews; the business
passed without difficulty through the forms of
office; and had Esther been less lovely, or less
beloved, a single day would have consummated
the universal slaughter of a submissive people,
to whom no legal defence was allowed, and
from whom no resistance seems to have been
dreaded. I am a stanger to Mr. Davis's poli∣tical
principles; but I should think that the
epithet of <HI>slaves,</HI> and of <HI>despised</HI> slaves, may,
without injustice, be applied to a captive na∣tion,
over whose heads the sword of tyranny
was suspended by so slender a thread.</P>
<P>The policy of the Macedonians was very
different from that of the Persians; and yet
Mr. Davis, who reluctantly confesses that the
Jews were oppressed by the former, does not
understand how long they were favoured and
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
protected by the latter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis. p. 4.</NOTE>. In the shock of those
revolutions which divided the empire of Alex∣ander,
Judaea, like the other provinces, expe∣rienced
the transient ravages of an advancing
or retreating enemy, who led away a multitude
of captives. But in the age of Josephus, the
Jews still enjoyed the privileges granted by the
Kings of Asia and Egypt, who had fixed nu∣merous
colonies of that nation in the new cities
of Alexandria, Antioch, &amp;c. and placed them
in the same honourable condition (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
as the Greeks and Macedonians them∣selves.
(Joseph. Antiquat. l. xii. c. 1. 3.
p. 585. 596. Vol. i. edit. Havercamp.) Had
they been treated with less indulgence, their
settlement in those celebrated cities, the seats of
commerce and learning, was enough to introduce
them to the knowledge of the world, and to justify
my <HI>absurd</HI> proposition, that they emerged from
obscurity under the successors of Alexander.</P>
<P>Under the reign of those princes who oc∣cupy
the interval between Alexander and Au∣gustus,
the Jews asserted their civil and reli∣gious
rights against Antiochus Epiphanes, who
had adopted new maxims of tyranny, and the age
of the Machabees is perhaps the most glorious
period of the Hebrew annals. Mr. Davis,
who on this occasion is bewildered by the sub∣tlety
of Tacitus, does not comprehend why
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
the historian should ascribe the independence
of the Jews to three <HI>negative</HI> causes, <Q REND="inline">Mace∣donibus
invalidis, Parthis nondum adultis,
et Romani procul aberant.</Q> To the under∣standing
of the critic, Tacitus might as well
have observed that the Jews were not destroyed
by a plague, a famine, or an earthquake; and
Mr. Davis cannot see, for his own part, any
reason why they might not have elected Kings
of their own two or three hundred years be∣fore<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 8.</NOTE>. Such indeed was not the reason of Ta∣citus;
he probably considered that every na∣tion,
depressed by the weight of a foreign
power, naturally rises towards the surface, as
soon as the pressure is removed; and he
might think that, in a short and rapid history
of the independence of the Jews, it was suffi∣cient
for him to shew that the obstacles did not
exist, which, in an earlier or in a later period,
would have checked their efforts. The curi∣ous
reader, who has leisure to study the Jewish
and Syrian history, will discover that the
throne of the Asmonaean Princes was con∣firmed
by the two great victories of the Parthians
over Demetrius Nicator, and Antiochus Sidetes
(See Joseph. Antiquitat. Jud. l. xiii. c. 5, 6.
8, 9. Justin, xxxvi. 1. xxxviii. 10. with Usher
and Prideaux, before Christ 141 and 130); and
the expression of Tacitus, the more closely it is
examined, will be the more rationally admired.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
My Quotations<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 537. Note 1, 2.</NOTE> are the object of Mr. Da∣vis's
criticism<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 10, 11. 20.</NOTE>, as well as the Text of this short,
but obnoxious passage. He corrects the error
of my memory, which had suggested <HI>servitutis</HI>
instead of <HI>servientium</HI>; and so natural is the al∣liance
between truth and moderation, that on
this occasion he forgets his character, and can∣didly
acquits me of any malicious design to
misrepresent the words of Tacitus. The other
references, which are contained in the first and
second Notes of my Fifteenth Chapter, are
connected with each other, and can only be
mistaken after they have been forcibly sepa∣rated.
The silence of Herodotus is a fair evi∣dence
of the obscurity of the Jews, who had
escaped the eyes of so curious a traveller. The
Jews are first mentioned by Justin, when he
relates the siege of Jerusalem by Antiochus Si∣detes;
and the conquest of Judaea, by the
arms of Pompey, engaged Diodorus and Dion
to introduce that singular nation to the ac∣quaintance
of their readers. These epochs,
which are within seventy years of each other,
mark the age in which the Jewish people,
emerging from their obscurity, began to act a
part in the society of nations, and to excite
the curiosity of the Greek and Roman histo∣rians.
For that purpose only, I had appealed
to the authority of Diodorus Siculus, of Justin,
or rather of Trogus Pompeius, and of Dion
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Cassius. If I had designed to investigate the
Jewish Antiquities, reason, as well as faith,
must have directed my inquiries to the Sacred
Books, which, even as human productions,
would deserve to be studied as one of the most
curious and original monuments of the East.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="article">

<P>I shall begin this article by the confession of
an error which candour might perhaps excuse,
but which my Adversary magnifies by a pathe∣tic
interrogation. <Q REND="inline">When he tells us, that he
has carefully examined all the original ma∣terials,
are we to believe him? or is it his

<P>In speaking of the danger of idolatry, I had
quoted the pictoresque expression of Tertullian,
<Q REND="inline">Recogita sylvam et quantae latitant spinae,</Q>
and finding it marked c. 10 in my Notes, I
hastily, though naturally, added <HI>de Idololatria,</HI>
instead of <HI>de Corona Militis,</HI> and referred to
one Treatise of Tertullian instead of another<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 553. Note 40.</NOTE>.
And now let me ask in my turn, whether Mr.
Davis had any real knowledge of the passage
which I had misplaced, or whether he made an
ungenerous use of his advantage, to insinuate
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
that I had invented or perverted the words of
Tertullian? Ignorance is less criminal than
malice, and I shall be satisfied if he will plead
guilty to the milder charge.</P>
<P>The same observation may be extended to a
passage of Le Clerc, which asserts, in the
clearest terms, the ignorance of the more an∣cient
Jews with regard to a future state. Le
Clerc lay open before me, but while my eye
moved from the book to the paper, I tran∣scribed
the reference c. 1. sect. 8. instead of
sect. 1. c. 8. from the natural, but erroneous
persuasion, that <HI>Chapter</HI> expressed the larger,
and <HI>Section</HI> the smaller division<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 560, Note 58.</NOTE>: and this dif∣ference,
of such trifling moment and so easily
rectified, holds a distinguished place in the list
of Misrepresentations which adorn Mr. Davis's
table of Contents<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 19.</NOTE>. But to return to Tertul∣lian.</P>
<P>The <HI>infernal</HI> picture, which I had produced<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 566.</NOTE>
from that vehement writer, which excited the
horror of every humane reader, and which
even Mr. Davis will not explicitly defend, has
furnished him with a few critical cavils<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 29—33.</NOTE>.
Happy should I think myself, if the materials
of my History could be always exposed to the
Examination of the Public; and I shall con∣tent
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
myself with appealing to the impartial
Reader, whether my Version of this Passage is
not as fair and as faithful as the more literal
translation which Mr. Davis has exhibited in
an opposite column. I shall only justify two
expressions which have provoked his indigna∣tion.
1. I had observed that the zealous Afri∣can
pursues the infernal description in a long
variety of affected and unfeeling witticisms;
the instances of Gods, of Kings, of Magi∣strates,
of Philosophers, of Poets, of Trage∣dians
introduced into my Translation. Those
which I had omitted relate to the Dancers, the
Charioteers, and the Wrestlers; and it is al∣most
impossible to express those conceits which
are connected with the language and manners
of the Romans. But the reader will be <HI>suffi∣ciently</HI>
shocked, when he is informed that Ter∣tullian
alludes to the improvement which the
agility of the Dancers, the <HI>red</HI> livery of the
Charioteers, and the attitudes of the Wrestlers,
would derive from the effects of fire. <Q REND="inline">Tunc
histrioanes cognoscendi solutiores multo per
ignem; tunc spectandus Auriga in flammea
rota totus ruber. Tunc Xystici contem∣plandi,
non in Gymnasiis, sed in igne jacu∣lati.</Q>
2. I cannot refuse to answer Mr.
Davis's very particular question, Why I appeal
to Tertullian for the condemnation of the
wisest and most virtuous of the Pagans? <HI>Because</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
I am inclined to bestow that epithet on Trajan
and the Antonines, Homer and Euripides,
Plato and Aristotle, who are all manifestly in∣cluded
within the fiery description which I had
produced.</P>
<P>I am accused of misquoting Tertullian ad
Scapulam<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 35, 36.</NOTE>, as an evidence that Martyrdoms
were lately introduced into Africa<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 609, Note 172.</NOTE>. Besides
Tertullian, I had quoted from Ruinart (Acta
Sincera, p. 84.) the Acts of the Scyllitan Mar∣tyrs;
and a very moderate knowledge of Ec∣clesiastical
History would have informed Mr.
Davis, that the two authorities thus connected
establish the proposition asserted in my Text.
Tertullian, in the above-mentioned Chapter,
speaks of one of the Proconsuls of Africa, Vi∣gellius
Saturninus, <Q REND="inline">qui <HI>primus hic</HI> gladium in
nos egit;</Q> the Acta Sincera represent the
same Magistrate as the Judge of the Scyllitan
Martyrs, and Ruinart, with the consent of the
best Critics, ascribes their sufferings to the
persecution of Severus. Was it my fault if
Mr. Davis was incapable of supplying the in∣termediate
ideas?</P>
<P>Is it likewise necessary that I should justify
the frequent use which I have made of Tertul∣lian?
His copious writings display a lively and
interesting picture of the primitive Church,
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
and the scantiness of original materials scarcely
left me the liberty of choice. Yet as I was
sensible, that the Montanism of Tertullian is
the convenient screen, which our orthodox
Divines have placed before his errors, I have,
with peculiar caution, confined myself to those
works which were composed in the more early
and sounder part of his life.</P>
<P>As a collateral justification of my frequent
appeals to this African Presbyter, I had intro∣duced,
in the third edition of my History, two
passages of Jerom and Prudentius, which prove
that Tertullian was the master of Cyprian, and
that Cyprian was the master of the Latin
Church<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 566. N. 72.</NOTE>. Mr. Davis assures me, however,
that I should have done better not to have
<Q REND="inline">added this note<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 145.</NOTE>, as I have only accumu∣lated
my inaccuracies.</Q> One inaccuracy he
had indeed detected, an error of the press, Hie∣ronym.
de Viris illustribus, c. 53 for 63; but
this advantage is dearly purchased by Mr. Da∣vis.
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which he produces as
the original words of Cyprian, has a braver and
more learned sound, than <HI>Da magistrum</HI>; but
the quoting in Greek a sentence which was pro∣nounced,
and is recorded in Latin, seems to
bear the mark of the most ridiculous pedantry;
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
unless Mr. Davis, consulting for the first time
the Works of Jerom, mistook the Version of
Sophronius, which is printed in the opposite
column, for the Text of his original Author.
My reference to Prudentius, Hymn. xiii. 100.
cannot so easily be justified, as I presumptu∣ously
believed that my critics would continue
to read till they came to a full stop. I shall
now place before them, not the first verse only,
but the entire period, which they will find full,
express, and satisfactory. The Poet says of
St. Cyprian, whom he places in Heaven,
<Q><L>Nec minus involitat terris, nec ab hoc recedit orbe:</L>
<L>Disserit, eloquitur, tractat, docet, instruit, prophetat;</L>

Mr. Davis accuses me of misrepresenting the

was incapable of reading or understanding the

<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
These imputations I shall easily wipe away, by
shewing that, in the first instance, I am proba∣bly
in the right, and that in the second, he is
certainly in the wrong.</P>
<P N="1">1. The concise and elegant Sulpicius, who
has been justly styled the Christian Sallust, after
mentioning the exile and Revelations of St.
John in the Isle of Patmos, observes (and
surely the observation is in the language of
complaint), <Q REND="inline">Librum sacrae Apocalypsis, qui

guilty of supposing <HI>plerique</HI> to signify <HI>the greater
number</HI>; whereas Mr. Davis, with Stephens's
Dictionary in his hand, is able to prove that
<HI>plerique</HI> has not <HI>always</HI> that extensive meaning,
and that a classic of good authority has used the
word in a much more limited and qualified
sense. Let the Examiner therefore try to ap∣ply
his exception to this particular case. For
my part, <HI>I</HI> stand under the protection of the
general usage of the Latin language, and with
a strong presumption in favour of the justice of
my cause, or at least of the innocence and fair∣ness
of my intentions; since I have translated a
familiar word according to its acknowledged
and ordinary acceptation.</P>
<P>But, <Q REND="inline">if I had looked into the passage, and
found that Sulpicius Severus there expressly
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
tells us, that the Apocalypse was the work
of St. John, I could not have committed so
unfortunate a <HI>blunder,</HI> as to cite this Father
as saying That the greater number of Chris∣tians
denied its Canonical authority<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 270.</NOTE>.</Q>
Unfortunate indeed would have been my
blunder, had I asserted that the same Chris∣tians
who denied its Canonical authority, ad∣mitted
it to be the work of an Apostle. Such
indeed was the opinion of Severus himself,
and his opinion has obtained the sanction of
the Church; but the Christians whom he taxes
with folly or impiety for rejecting this sacred
book, must have supported their error by at∣tributing
the Apocalypse to some uninspired
writer; to John the Presbyter, or to Cerinthus
the Heretic.</P>
<P>If the rules of grammar and of logic autho∣rise,
or at least allow me to translate <HI>plerique</HI> by
the <HI>greater number,</HI> the Ecclesiastical History of
the fourth century illustrates and justifies this
obvious interpretation. From a fair compari∣son
of the populousness and learning of the
Greek and Latin Churches, may I not con∣clude
that the former contained the <HI>greater
number</HI> of Christians qualified to pass sentence
on a mysterious prophesy composed in the
Greek language? May I not affirm, on the
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
authority of St. Jerom, that the Apocalypse
was generally rejected by the Greek Churches?
<Q REND="inline">Quod si eam (the Epistle to the Hebrews)

that the Apocalypse was tacitly excluded from the
sacred canon by the council of Laodicea (Ca∣non
LX.) To defend my Remark, I need
only state the fact in a simple, but more parti∣cular
manner. The assembled Bishops of Asia,
after enumerating all the books of the Old and
New Testament which should be read in
churches, omit the Apocalypse, and the Apo∣calypse
alone; at a time when it was rejected
or questioned by many pious and learned Chris∣tians,
who might deduce a very plausible ar∣gument
from the silence of the Synod.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Council of Trent resolved to
pronounce sentence on the Canon of Scripture,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
the opinion which prevailed, after some debate,
was to declare the Latin Vulgate authentic and
<HI>almost</HI> infallible; and this sentence, which was
guarded by formidable Anathemas, secured all
the books of the Old and New Testament
which composed that ancient version, <Q REND="inline">che si

1761.) When the merit of that version
was discussed, the majority of the Theologians
urged, with confidence and success, that it was
absolutely necessary to receive the Vulgate as
authentic and inspired, unless they wished to
abandon the victory to the Lutherans, and the
honours of the Church of the Grammarians.

reason as the most powerful argument which
influenced the debates of the Council: But
Mr. Davis, jealous of the honour of a Synod
which placed tradition on a level with the Bi∣ble,
affirms that Fra-Paolo has given another
more substantial reason on which these Popish
Bishops built their determination, That after
dividing the books under their consideration
into three classes; of those which had been al∣ways
held for divine; of those whose authenti∣city
had formerly been doubted, but which by
use and custom had acquired canonical autho∣rity;
and of those which had never been pro∣perly
certified; the Apocalypse was judiciously
placed by the Fathers of the Council in the
second of these classes.</P>
<P>The Italian passage which, for that purpose,
Mr. Davis had alleged at the bottom of his page,
is indeed taken from the text of Fra-Paolo: but
the reader who will give himself the trouble, or
rather the pleasure, of perusing that incompa∣rable
historian, will discover that Mr. Davis
has <HI>only</HI> mistaken a motion of the opposition
for a measure of the administration. He will
find that this critical division, which is so erro∣neously
ascribed to the public reason of the
Council, was no more than the ineffectual pro∣posal
of a temperate minority, which was soon
over-ruled by a majority of artful Statesmen,
bigotted Monks, and dependent Bishops.</P>

<P>I had cautiously observed (for I was apprised
of the obscurity of the subject) that the Epistle
of Clemens does not lead us to discover any
traces of Episcopacy either at Corinth or Rome<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 592. N. 110.</NOTE>.
In this observation I particularly alluded to the
republican form of salutation, <Q REND="inline">The Church
of God inhabiting Rome, to the Church of
God inhabiting Corinth;</Q> without the least
mention of a Bishop or President in either of
those ecclesiastical assemblies.</P>
<P>Yet the piercing eye of Mr. Davis<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 44, 45.</NOTE> can dis∣cover
not only traces, but evident proofs of
Episcopacy, in this Epistle of Clemens; and
he actually quotes two passages, in which he
distinguishes by capital letters the word BI∣SHOPS,
whose institution Clemens refers to the
Apostles themselves. But can Mr. Davis hope
to gain credit by such engregious triffing?
While we are searching for the origin of Bi∣shops,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
not merely as an ecclesiastical title, but
as the peculiar name of an order distinct from
that of Presbyters, he idly produces a passage,
which, by declaring that the Apostles esta∣blished
in every place <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> evi∣dently
confounds the <HI>Presbyters</HI> with one or
other of those two ranks. I have neither in∣clination
nor interest to engage in a contro∣versy
which I had considered only in an historical

that there are more traces of a disingenuous

<NOTE PLACE="marg">EUSEBIUS.</NOTE>
<P>Perhaps, on some future occasion, I may
examine the historical character of Eusebius;
perhaps I may enquire, how far it appears
from his words and actions that the learned
Bishop of Caesarea was averse to the use of
fraud, when it was employed in the service of
Religion. At present I am only concerned to
defend my own truth and honour from the re∣proach
of misrepresenting the sense of the Ec∣clesiastical
Historian. Some of the charges of
Mr. Davis on this head are so strong, so pointed,
so vehemently urged, that he seems to have
staked, on the event of the trial, the merits of
our respective characters. If his assertions are
true, I deserve the contempt of learned, and
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>

false, * * * * * * *</P>
<P N="1">1. I had remarked, without any malicious in∣tention,
that one of the seventeen Christians

of robbery<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 654, N. 75.</NOTE>. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 61, 62, 63. This ridiculous charge is repeated by another <HI>Sycophant</HI> (in the Greek sense of the word), and forms one of the <HI>va∣luable</HI> communications, which the learning of a Randolph suggested to the candour of a Chelsum. See Remarks, p. 209.</NOTE> seems enraged be∣cause
I did not add that he was <HI>falsely</HI> accused,
takes some unnecessary pains to convince me
that the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <HI>falso
accusatus,</HI> and <Q REND="inline">can hardly think that any one
who had looked into the original, would
dare thus absolutely to contradict the plain
testimony of the author he <HI>pretends</HI> to fol∣low.</Q>
A simple narrative of this fact, in the
relation of which Mr. Davis has <HI>really</HI> sup∣pressed
several material circumstances, will af∣ford
the clearest justification.</P>
<P>Eusebius had preserved an original letter
from Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria to Fabius
Bishop of Antioch, in which the former re∣lates
the circumstances of the persecution which
had lately afflicted the capital of Egypt. He
allows a rank among the martyrs to one Ne∣mesion,
an Egyptian, who was falsely or ma∣liciously
accused as a companion of robbers.
Before the Centurion he justified himself from
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
this calumny, which did not relate to him:
but being charged as a Christian, he was
brought in chains before the Governor. That
unjust magistrate, after inflicting on Nemesion
<HI>a double measure of stripes and tortures,</HI> gave or∣ders
that he should be <HI>burnt with the robbers.</HI>
(Dionys. apud Euseb. l. vi. c. 41.)</P>
<P>It is evident that Dionysius represents the
religious sufferer as innocent of the criminal
accusation which had been falsely brought
against him. It is not less evident, that what∣ever
might be the opinion of the Centurion,
the supreme magistrate considered Nemesion
as guilty, and that he affected to shew, by the
measure of his tortures, and by the compa∣nions
of his execution, that he punished him,
not only as a Christian, but as a robber.
The evidence against Nemesion, and that
which might be produced in his favour, are
equally lost; and the question (which fortu∣nately
is of little moment) of his guilt or in∣nocence
rests solely on the opposite judgments
of his ecclesiastical and civil superiors. I could
easily perceive that both the Bishop and the
Governor were actuated by different passions
and prejudices towards the unhappy sufferer;
but it was impossible for me to decide which of
the two was the most likely to indulge his pre∣judices
and passions at the expence of truth.
In this doubtful situation, I conceived that
I had acted with the most unexceptionable
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
caution, when I contented myself with ob∣serving
that Nemesion was <HI>accused</HI>; a circum∣stance
of a public and authentic nature, in
which both parties were agreed.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis will no longer ask, <Q REND="inline">what pos∣sible
evasion then can Mr. Gibbon have re∣course
to, to convince the world that I have
<HI>falsely</HI> accused <HI>him</HI> of a gross misrepresenta∣tion
of Eusebius?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 64, 65.</NOTE> charges me with falsifying
(<HI>falsifying</HI> is a very serious word) the testimony
of Eusebius; because it suited my purpose to
magnify the humanity and even kindness of
Maxentius towards the afflicted Christians<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 693, N. 168.</NOTE>.
To support this charge, he produces some part
of a chapter of Eusebius, the English in his
text, the Greek in his notes, and makes the
Ecclesiastical Historian express himself in the
following terms: <Q REND="inline">Although Maxentius at
first favoured the Christians with a view of
popularity, yet afterwards, being addicted
to magic, and every other impiety, HE ex∣erted
himself in persecuting the Christians, in
a more severe and destructive manner than
his predecessors had done before him.</Q></P>
<P>If it were in my power to place the volume
and chapter of Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. viii.
c. 14.) before the eyes of every reader, I should
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
be satisfied and silent. I should not be under
the necessity of protesting, that in the passage
quoted, or rather abridged, by my adversary,
the second member of the period, which alone
contradicts my account of Maxentius, has not
the most distant reference to that odious tyrant.
After distinguishing the mild conduct which
<HI>he</HI> affected towards the Christians, Eusebius
proceeds to animadvert with becoming serverity
on the general vices of his reign; the rapes,
the murders, the oppression, the promiscuous
massacres, which I had faithfully related in
their proper place, and which the Christians,
not in their religious, but in their civil capa∣city,
must occasionally have shared with the
rest of his unhappy subjects. The Ecclesiastical
Historian then makes a transition to <HI>another
tyrant,</HI> the cruel Maximin, who carried away
from his friend and ally Maxentius the prize of
superior wickedness; for HE was addicted to
magic arts, and was a cruel persecutor of the
Christians. The evidence of words and facts,
the plain meaning of Eusebius, the concurring
testimony of Caecilius or Lactantius, and the
superfluous authority of Versions and Commen∣tators,
establish beyond the reach of doubt or
cavil, that Maximin, and not Maxentius, is
stigmatized as a persecutor, and that Mr. Davis
alone has deserved the reproach of <HI>falsifying</HI> the
testimony of Eusebius.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
Let him examine the chapter on which he
founds his accusation. If in that moment his
feelings are not of the most painful and humi∣liating
kind, he must indeed be an object of
pity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A gross blunder</HI> is imputed to me by this
polite antagonist<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 66.</NOTE>, for quoting under the name
of Jerom, the Chronicle which I ought to have
described as the work and property of Euse∣bius<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 673, N. 125.</NOTE>; and Mr. Davis kindly points out the
occasion of my blunder, That it was the conse∣quence
of my looking no farther than Dodwell
for this remark, and of not rightly under∣standing
his reference. Perhaps the Historian
of the Roman Empire may be credited, when
he affirms that he frequently consulted a Latin
Chronicle of the affairs of that Empire; and
he may the sooner be credited, if he shews that
he knows something more of this Chronicle
besides the name and the title-page.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, who talks so familiarly of the
Chronicle of Eusebius, will be surprised to
hear that the Greek original no longer exists.
Some chronological fragments, which had suc∣cessively
passed through the hands of Africanus
and Eusebius, are still extant, though in a very
corrupt and mutilated state, in the compila∣tions
of Syncellus and Cedrenus. They have
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
been collected, and disposed by the labour and
ingenuity of Joseph Scaliger; but that proud
Critic, always ready to applaud his own suc∣cess,
did not flatter himself, that he had re∣stored
the hundredth part of the genuine Chro∣nicle
of Eusebius. <Q REND="inline">Ex eo <HI>(Syncello)</HI> omnia
Eusebiana excerpsimus quae quidem depre∣hendere
potuimus; quae, quanquam ne cen∣tesima
quidem pars eorum esse videtur quae
ab Eusebio relicta sunt, aliquod tamen justum
volumen explere possunt.</Q> (Jos. Scaliger
Animadversiones in Graeca Eusebii in Thesauro
Temporum, p. 401. Amstelod. 1658. While
the Chronicle of Eusebius was perfect and
entire, the second book was translated into
Latin by Jerom, with the freedom, or rather
licence, which that voluminous Author, as well
as his friend or enemy Rufinus, always assumed.
<Q REND="inline">Plurima in vertendo mutat, infulcit, praeterit,</Q>
says Scaliger himself, in the Prolegomena, p. 22.
In the persecution of Aurelian, which has so
much offended Mr. Davis, we are able to dis∣tinguish
the work of Eusebius from that of
Jerom, by comparing the expressions of the
Ecclesiastical History with those of the Chro∣nicle.
The former affirms, that, towards
the end of his reign, Aurelian was moved
by some councils to excite a persecution
gainst the Christians; that his design occa∣sioned
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
a great and general rumour; but
that when the letters were prepared, and as
it were signed, Divine Justice dismissed him
from the world. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. vii. c. 30. Where∣as
the Chronicle relates, that Aurelian was
killed after he had excited or moved a perse∣cution
against the Christians, <Q REND="inline">cum adversum
nos persecutionem movisset.</Q></P>
<P>From this manifest difference I assume a right
to assert; first, the expression of the Chronicle of
<HI>Jerom,</HI> which is always proper, became in this
instance necessary; and secondly, that the lan∣guage
of the Fathers is so ambiguous and in∣correct,
that we are at a loss how to determine
how far Aurelian had carried his intention be∣fore
he was assassinated. I have neither per∣verted
the <HI>fact,</HI> nor have I been guilty of <HI>a gross
blunder.</HI></P>

partly by a general expression of Cyprian
(de Lapsis, p. 88. Edit. Fell. Amstelod. 1700.)
and more especially by the second Apology of
Justin Martyr, who gives a particular and cu∣rious
example of this legal delay.</P>
<P>The expressions of Cyprian, <Q REND="inline">dies negan∣tibus
praestitutus, &amp;c.,</Q> which Mr. Davis most
prudently suppresses, are illustrated by Mosheim
in the following words: <Q REND="inline">Primum qui delati

(De Rebus Christianis ante Constan∣tinum,
p. 480.) The practice of Egypt was
sometimes more expeditious and severe; but
this humane indulgence was still allowed in
Africa during the persecution of Decius.</P>
<P>But my appeal to Justin Martyr is encoun∣tered
by Mr. Davis with the following declara∣tion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 71, 72.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline">The reader will observe, that Mr.
Gibbon does not make any reference to any
section or division of this part of Justin's work;
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
with what view we may shrewdly suspect,
when I tell him, that after an accurate perusal
of the whole second Apology, I can boldly
affirm, that the following instance is the only
one that bears the most distant similitude to
what Mr. Gibbon relates as above on the
authority of Justin. What I find in Justin
is as follows: "A woman being converted
to Christianity, is afraid to associate with her
husband, because he is an abandoned repro∣bate,
lest she should partake of his sins. Her
husband, not being able to accuse <HI>her,</HI> vents
his rage in this manner on one Ptolemaeus,
a teacher of Christianity, and who had con∣verted
her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Mr. Davis then proceeds
to relate the severities inflicted on Ptolemaeus,
who made a frank and instant profession of his
faith: and he sternly exclaims, that if I take
every opportunity of passing encomiums on the
humanity of Roman magistrates, it is incum∣bent
on me to produce better evidence than
this.</P>
<P>His demand may be easily satisfied, and I need
only for that purpose transcribe and translate
the words of Justin, which <HI>immediately</HI> pre∣cede
the Greek quotation alleged at the bottom
of my adversary's page. I am possessed of two
editions of Justin Martyr, that of Cambridge,
1768, in 8vo, by Dr. Ashton, who only pub∣lished
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
the two Apologies; and that of all his
works, published in fol. Paris, 1742, by the
Benedictines of the Congregation of St. Maar:
the following curious passage may be found,

Edition. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<Q REND="inline">He brought an accusation

But she presented a petition to the Emperor,
praying that she might first be allowed to
settle her domestic concerns; and promising,
that after she had settled them, she would
then put in her answer to the accusation.
This you granted.</Q></P>
<P>I disdain to add a single reflection: nor shall
I qualify the conduct of my adversary with any
of those harsh epithets, which might be inter∣preted

I should be constrained to use them as the only
words in the English language, which could

<NOTE PLACE="marg">LACTAN∣TIUS.</NOTE>
<P>In stating the toleration of Christianity du∣ring
the greatest part of the reign of Diocle∣tian,
I had observed<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 676. N. 133, 134.</NOTE>, that the principal eunuchs
of the palace, whose names and offices were
particularly specified, enjoyed, with their wives
and children, the free exercise of the Christian
religion. Mr. Davis twice affirms<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 75, 76.</NOTE>, in the
most deliberate manner, that this pretended
fact, which is asserted on the sole authority,
is contradicted by the positive evidence, of Lac∣tantius.
In both these <HI>effirmations</HI> Mr. Davis
is inexcusably mistaken.</P>
<P N="1">1. When the storms of persecution arose, the
Priests, who were offended by the sign of the
Cross, obtained leave of the Emperor, that the
profane, the Christians, who accompanied him
to the Temple, should be compelled to offer
sacrifice; and this incident is mentioned by
the Rhetorician, to whom I shall not at present
refuse the name of Lactantius. The act of
idolatry, which at the expiration of eighteen
years was required of the officers of Dioletian,
is a manifest proof that their religious freedom
had hitherto been inviolate, except in the single
instance of waiting on their master to the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
Temple; a service less criminal, than the pro∣fane
compliance for which the Minister of the
King of Syria solicited the permission of the
Prophet of Israel.</P>
<P N="2">2. The reference which I made to Lac∣tantius
expressly pointed out this exception to
their freedom. But the proof of the toleration
which they enjoyed, was built on a different
testimony, which my disingenuous adversary has
concealed; an ancient and curious instruction,
composed by Bishop Theonas, for the use of
Lucian and the other Christian eunuchs of the
palace of Diocletian. This authentic piece was
published in the Spicilegium of Dom Luc
d'Acheri; as I had not the opportunity of con∣sulting
the original, I was contented with quot∣ing
it on the faith of Tillemont, and the refer∣ence
to it immediately precedes (ch. xvi. note
133.) the citation of Lactantius (note 134).</P>
<P>Mr. Davis may now answer his own question,
<Q REND="inline">What apology can be made for thus assert∣ing,
on the sole authority of Lactantius,
facts which Lactantius so expressly denies?</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">I have already given a curious instance
of our Author's asserting, on the authority of

proof of his endeavouring to conceal
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
from us a passage really contained in him<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 83.</NOTE>.</Q>
Nothing but the angry vehemence with which
these charges are urged, could engage me to
take the least notice of them. In themselves
they are doubly contemptible: they are trifling,
and they are false.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 11.</NOTE> had imputed to me as a
crime, that I had mentioned, on the sole testi∣mony
of Dion (l. lxviii. p. 1145.), the spirit of
rebellion which inflamed the Jews, from the
reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 622.</NOTE>,
whilst the passage of that Historian is confined
to an insurrection in Cyprus and Cyrene,
which broke out within that period. The
Reader who will cast his eye on the Note
(ch. xvi. note 1.) which is supported by
that quotation from Dion, will discover that it
related only to <HI>this</HI> particular fact. The ge∣neral
position, which is indeed too notorious
to require any proof, I had carefully justified
in the course of the same paragraph; partly by
another reference to Dion Cassius, partly by an
allusion to the well-known History of Jose∣phus,
and partly by <HI>several</HI> quotations from the
learned and judicious Basnage, who has ex∣plained,
in the most satisfactory manner, the
principles and conduct of the rebellious Jews.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="57"/>
2. The passage of Dion, which I am accused
of endeavouring to conceal, might perhaps
have remained invisible, even to the piercing
eye of Mr. Davis, if <HI>I</HI> had not carefully re∣ported
it in its proper place: and it was in
my power to report it, without being guilty of
any <HI>inconsiderate contradiction.</HI> I had observed,
that, in the large history of Dion Cassius, Xi∣philin
had not been able to discover the name
of <HI>Christians:</HI> yet I afterwards quote a passage
in which Marcia, the favourite Concubine of
Commodus, is celebrated as the Patroness of
the <HI>Christians.</HI> Mr. Davis has transcribed my
quotation, but <HI>he</HI> has concealed the important
words which I now distinguish by Italics (ch.
xvi. note 106. Dion Cassius, <HI>or rather his ab∣breviator
Xiphilin,</HI> l. lxxii. p. 1206.) The re∣ference
is fairly made and cautiously qualified;
I am already secure from the imputations of
fraud or inconsistency; and the opinion which
attributes the last-mentioned passage to the Ab∣breviator,
rather than to the original Historian,
may be supported by the most unexception∣able
authorities. I shall protect myself by these
of Reimar (in his Edition of Dion Cassius,
tom. ii. p. 1207. note 34.), and of Dr. Lard∣ner;
and shall only transcribe the words of the<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 667, n. 107.</NOTE>
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
latter, in his Collection of Jewish and Heathen
testimonies, vol. iii. p. 57.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">This paragraph I rather think to be Xi∣philin's
than Dion's. The style at least is
Xiphilin's. In the other passages before
quoted, Dion speaks of <HI>Impiety,</HI> or <HI>Atheism,</HI>
or <HI>Judaism</HI>; but never useth the word <HI>Chris∣tians.</HI>
Another thing that may make us
doubt whether this observation be entirely
Dion's, is the phrase, "it is related (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)."
For at the beginning of the reign
of Commodus, he says, "These things,
and what follows, I write not from the report
of others, but from my own knowledge and
observation." However, the sense may be
Dion; but I wish we had also his style with∣out
any adulteration.</Q> For my own part,
I must, in my private opinion, ascribe even
the sense of this passage to Xiphilin. The
<HI>Monk</HI> might eagerly collect and insert an anec∣dote
which related to the domestic history of the
church; but the religion of a courtezan must
have appeared an object of very little moment
in the eyes of a <HI>Roman Counsul,</HI> who, at least
in every other part of his history, disdained or
neglected to mention the name of the Chris∣tians.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">What shall we say now? Do we not dis∣cover
the name of Christians in the History
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
of Dion? With what <HI>assurance</HI> then can
Mr. Gibbon, after asserting a fact manifestly
<HI>untrue,</HI> lay claim to the merits of diligence

his assertion, that he has carefully examined
all the original materials<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 83.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon may still maintain the character
of an Historian; but it is difficult to conceive
how Mr. Davis will support his pretensions, if
he aspires to that of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>I almost hesitate whether I should take any
notice of another ridiculous charge which Mr.
Davis includes in the article of Dion Cassius.
My adversary owns, that I have occasionally
produced the several passages of the Augustan
History which relate to the Christians, but he
fiercely contends that they amount to more
than <HI>six lines</HI><NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 634. n. 24.</NOTE>. I really have not measured
them: nor did I mean that loose expression as
a precise and definite number. If, on a nicer

of the long lines of my folio edition, I am con∣tent
that my critical Antagonist should substi∣tute

By a judicious re-union and arrangement

Nothing ought to be inserted which is not
proved by some one of the witnesses; but their
evidence must be so intimately blended to∣gether,
that as it is unreasonable to expect that
each of them should vouch for the whole, so it
would be impossible to define the boundaries
of their respective property. Neither Pliny,
nor Dionysius, nor Cyprian, mention <HI>all</HI> the

<P>I am accused of throwing out a false accu∣sation
against this Father<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 100, 101.</NOTE>, because I had ob∣served<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 551, Note 35.</NOTE> that Ignatius, defending against the
Gnostics the resurrection of Christ, employs a
vague and doubtful tradition, instead of quot∣ing
the certain testimony of the Evangelists:
and this observation was justified by a remark∣able
passage of Ignatius, in his Epistle to the
Smyrnaeans, which I cited according to the
volume and the page of the best edition of
the Apostolical Fathers, published at Amster∣dam,
1724, in two volumes in folio. The
Criticism of Mr. Davis is announced by one of
those solemn declarations which leave not any
refuge, if they are convicted of falsehood.
<Q REND="inline">I cannot find any passage that bears the least
affinity to what Mr. Gibbon observes, in the
whole Epistle, which I have read over more
than once.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63"/>
I had already marked the <HI>situation</HI>; nor is it
in my power to prove the <HI>existence</HI> of this
passage, by any other means than by producing
the words of the original. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<Q REND="inline">I have known, and I believe, that after his
resurrection likewise he existed in the flesh:
And when he came to Peter, and to the rest,
he said unto them, Take, handle me, and
see that I am not an incorporeal daemon or
spirit. And they touched him and believ∣ed.</Q>
The faith of the Apostles confuted the
impious error of the Gnostics, which attributed
only the <HI>appearances</HI> of a human body to the
Son of God: and it was the great object of
Ignatius, in the last moments of his life, to
secure the Christians of Asia from the snares of
those dangerous Heretics. According to the
tradition of the modern Greeks, Ignatius was
the child whom Jesus received into his arms
(See Tillemont Mem. Eccles. tom. ii. part ii.
p. 43.); yet as he could hardly be old enough
to remember the resurrection of the Son of
God, he must have derived his knowledge
<HI>either</HI> from our present Evangelists, <HI>or</HI> from
some Apocryphal Gospel, <HI>or</HI> from some un∣written
tradition.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="64"/>
1. The Gospels of St. Luke and St. John
would undoubtedly have supplied Ignatius with
the most invincible proofs of the reality of the
body of Christ, when he appeared to the
Apostles after his resurrection: but neither of
those Gospels contain the characteristic words
of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the important cir∣cumstance
that either Peter, or <HI>those</HI> who were
with Peter, touched the body of Christ and
believed. Had the Saint designed to quote
the Evangelist on a very nice subject of contro∣versy,
he would not surely have exposed him∣self
by an inaccurate, or rather by a false re∣ference,
to the just reproaches of the Gnostics.
On this occasion, therefore, Ignatius did not
employ, as he might have done, against the
Heretics, the certain testimony of the Evan∣gelists.</P>
<P N="2">2. Jerom, who cites this remarkable passage
from the Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans
(See Catalog. Script. Eccles. in Ignatio, tom. i.
p. 273. edit. Erasm. Basil 1537), is of opinion
that it was taken from the <HI>Gospel</HI> which he him∣self
had lately translated: and <HI>this,</HI> from the
comparison of two other passages in the same
Work (in Jacob. et in Matthaeo, p. 264), ap∣pears
to have been the Hebrew Gospel, which
was used by the Nazarenes of Beraea, as the
genuine composition of St. Matthew. Yet
Jerom mentions another Copy of this Hebrew
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
Gospel (so different from the Greek Text),
which was extant in the library formed at Cae∣sarea,
by the care of Pamphilus: whilst the
learned Eusebius, the friend of Pamphilus and
the Bishop of Caesarea, very frankly declares
(Hist. Eccles. l. iii. c. 36.), that <HI>he</HI> is ignorant
from whence Ignatius borrowed those words,
which are the subject of the present Enquiry.</P>
<P N="3">3. The doubt which remains, is only whe∣ther
he took them from an Apocryphal Book,
or from <HI>unwritten tradition:</HI> and I thought my∣self
safe from every species of Critics, when I
embraced the rational sentiment of Casaubon
and Pearson. I shall produce the words of the
Bishop. <Q REND="inline">Praeterea iterum observandum est,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOSHEIM.</NOTE>
<P>The learning and judgment of Mosheim
had been of frequent use in the course of my
Historical Inquiry, and I had not been wanting
in proper expressions of gratitude. My vexa∣tious
Adversary is always ready to start from
his ambuscade, and to harass my march by a
mode of attack, which cannot easily be recon∣ciled
with the laws of honourable war. The
greatest part of the Misrepresentations of Mo∣shiem,
which Mr. Davis has imputed to me<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 95—97. 104—107. 114—132.</NOTE>,
are of such a nature, that I must indeed be
humble, if I could persuade myself to bestow a
moment of serious attention on them. <HI>Whether</HI>
Mosheim could prove that an absolute com∣munity
of goods was not established among the
first Christians of Jerusalem; <HI>whether</HI> he sus∣pected
the purity of the Epistles of Ignatius;
<HI>whether</HI> he censured Dr. Middleton with tem∣per
or indignation (in this cause I must chal∣lenge
Mr. Davis as an incompetent judge);
<HI>whether</HI> he corroborates the <HI>whole</HI> of my de∣scription
of the prophetic office; <HI>whether</HI> he
speaks with approbation of the humanity
of Pliny, and <HI>whether</HI> he attributed the
same sense to the <HI>malefica</HI> of Suetonius, and
the <HI>exitiabilis</HI> of Tacitus. These questions,
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
even as Mr. Davis has stated them, lie open
to the judgment of every reader, and the super∣fluous
observations which I could make, would
be an abuse of their time and of my own. As
little shall I think of consuming their patience,
by examining whether Le Clerc and Mosheim
<HI>labour</HI> in the interpretation of some texts of the
Fathers, and particularly of a passage of Ire∣naeus,
which seem to favour the pretensions of
the Roman Bishop. The material part of the
passage of Irenaeus consists of about <HI>four lines</HI>;
and in order to shew that the interpretations of
Le Clerc and Mosheim are not <HI>laboured,</HI> Mr.
Davis abridges them as much as possible in the
space of <HI>twelve pages.</HI> I know not whether the
perusal of my History will justify the suspicion
of Mr. Davis, that I am secretly inclined to
the interest of the Pope: but I cannot discover
how the Protestant cause can be affected, if Ire∣naeus
in the second, or Palavicini in the seven∣teenth
century, were tempted, by any private
views, to countenance in their writings the
system of ecclesiastical dominion, which has been
pursued in every age by the aspiring Bishops of
the Imperial city. Their conduct followed the
revolutions of the Christian Republic, but the
same spirit animated the haughty breasts of
Victor the First, and of Paul the Fifth.</P>
<P>There still remain one or two of these im∣puted
Misrepresentations, which appear, and
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
indeed only appear, to merit a little more at∣tention.
In stating the opinion of Mosheim
with regard to the progress of the Gospel, Mr.
Davis boldly declares, <Q REND="inline">that I have <HI>altered the
truth</HI> of Mosheim's history, that I might
have an opportunity of contradicting the be∣lief
and wishes of the Fathers<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 127.</NOTE>.</Q> In other
words, I have been guilty of uttering a mali∣cious
falsehood.</P>
<P>I had endeavoured to mitigate the sanguine
expression of the Fathers of the second century,
who had too hastily diffused the light of Christi∣anity
over every part of the globe, by ob∣serving,
as an undoubted fact, <Q REND="inline">that the Bar∣barians
of Scythia and Germany, who sub∣verted
the Roman Monarchy, were involved
in the errors of Paganism; and that even
the conquest of Iberia, of Armenia, or of
Aethiopia, was not attempted with any de∣gree
of success, till the scepter was in the
hands of an orthodox Emperor<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 611, 612.</NOTE>.</Q> I had
referred the curious reader to the fourth cen∣tury
of Mosheim's General History of the
Church: Now Mr. Davis has discovered, and
can prove, from that excellent work, <Q REND="inline">that
Christianity, not long after its first rise, had
been introduced into the less as well as
greater Armenia; that part of the Goths,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
who inhabited Thracia, Maesia, and Dacia,
had received the Christian religion long be∣fore
this century; and that Theophilus, their
Bishop, was present at the Council of
Nice<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 126, 127.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>On this occasion, the reference was made to
a popular work of Mosheim, for the satisfac∣tion
of the reader, that he might obtain the ge∣neral
view of the progress of Christianity in the
fourth century, which I had gradually acquired
by studying with some care the Ecclesiastic
Antiquities of the Nations beyond the limits of
the Roman Empire. If I had reasonably sup∣posed
that the result of our common inquiries
must be the same, should I have deserved a
very harsh censure for my unsuspecting confi∣dence?
Or if I had declined the invidious task
of separating a few immaterial errors, from a
just and judicious representation, might not
my respect for the name and merit of Mosheim,
have claimed some indulgence? But I disdain
those excuses, which only a candid adversary
would allow. I can meet Mr. Davis on the
hard ground of controversy, and retort on his
own head the charge of concealing a part of the
truth. He himself has dared to suppress the
words of my text, which immediately followed
his quotation. <Q REND="inline">Before that time the various
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
accidents of war and commerce might indeed
diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the Gospel
among the tribes of Caledonia, and among
the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube,
and the Euphrates;</Q> and Mr. Davis has
likewise suppresed one of the justificatory Notes
on this passage, which expressly points out the
time and circumstances of the first Gothic con∣versions.
These exceptions, which I had cau∣tiously
inserted, and Mr. Davis has cautiously
concealed, are superfluous for the provinces of
Thrace, Maesia, and the Lesser Armenia, which
were contained within the precincts of the Ro∣man
Empire. They allow an ample scope for
the more early conversion of some independent
districts of Dacia and the Greater Armenia,
which bordered on the Danube and Euphrates;
and the entire sense of this passage, which Mr.
Davis first mutilates and then attacks, is per∣fectly
consistent with the original text of the
learned Mosheim.</P>
<P>And yet I will fairly confess, that after a
nicer inquiry into the epoch of the Armenian
Church, I am not satisfied with the accuracy of
my own expression. The assurance that the
first Christian King, and the first Archbishop,
Tiridates, and St. Gregory the Illuminator,
were still alive several years after the death of
Constantine, inclined me to believe, that the
conversion of Armenia was posterior to the au∣spicious
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Revolution, which had given the scep∣ter
of Rome to the hands of an orthodox Em∣peror.
But I had not enough considered the
two following circumstances. 1. I might have
recollected the dates assigned by Moses of Cho∣rene,
who, on this occasion, may be regarded
as a competent witness. Tiridates ascended
the throne of Armenia in the third year of Dio∣cletian
(Hist. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 79. p. 207.),
and St. Gregory, who was invested with the
Episcopal character in the seventeenth year of
Tiridates, governed almost thirty years the
Church of Armenia, and disappeared from the
world in the forty-sixth year of the reign of the
same Prince. (Hist. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 88.
p. 224, 225.) The consecration of St. Gre∣gory
must therefore be placed A. D. 303, and
the conversion of the King and kingdom was
soon atchieved by that successful missionary.
2. The unjust and inglorious war which Maxi∣min
undertook against the Armenians, the an∣cient
faithful allies of the Republic, was evi∣dently
derived from a motive of superstitious
zeal. The historian Eusebius (Hist. Eccles.
l. ix. c. 8. p. 448. edit. Cantab.) considers the
pious Armenians as a nation of Christians, who
bravely defended themselves from the hostile
oppression of an idolatrous tyrant. Instead of
maintaining <Q REND="inline">that the conversion of Armenia
was not attempted with any degree of success
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
till the scepter was in the hands of an ortho∣dox
Emperor,</Q> I ought to have observed,
that the seeds of the faith were deeply sown
during the season of the last and greatest perse∣cution,
that many Roman exiles might assist
the labours of Gregory, and that the renowned
Tiridates, the hero of the East, may dispute
with Constantine the honour of being the first
Sovereign who embraced the Christian religion.</P>
<P>In a future edition, I shall rectify an expres∣sion
which, in strictness, can only be applied to
the kingdoms of Iberia and Aethiopia. Had
the error been exposed by Mr. Davis himself, I
should not have been ashamed to correct it;
but <HI>I am</HI> ashamed at being reduced to contend
with an adversary who is unable to discover, or
to improve his own advantages.</P>
<P>But instead of prosecuting any inquiry from
whence the public might have gained instruc∣tion,
and himself credit, Mr. Davis chuses to
perplex his readers with some angry cavils
about the progress of the Gospel in the second
century. What does he mean to establish or to
refute? Have I denied, that before the end of
that period Christianity was very widely diffused
both in the East and in the West? Has not
Justin Martyr affirmed, without exception or
limitation, that it was already preached to
<HI>every</HI> nation on the face of the earth? Is that
proposition true at present? Could it be true in
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
the time of Justin? Does not Mosheim acknow∣ledge
the exaggeration? <Q REND="inline">Demus, nec enim
quae in occulos incurrunt infitiari audemus,
esse in his verbis exaggerationis nonnihil.
Certum enim est diu post Justini aetatem,
multas orbis terrarum gentes cognitione
Christi caruisse.</Q> (Mosheim de Rebus Christi∣anis,
p. 203.) Does he not expose (p. 205.)
with becoming scorn and indignation, the false∣hood
and vanity of the hyperboles of Tertul∣lian?
<Q REND="inline">bonum hominem aestu imaginationis
elatum non satis adtendisse ad ea quae litteris
consignabat.</Q></P>
<P>The high esteem which Mr. Davis expresses
for the writings of Mosheim, would alone con∣vince
how little he has read them, since he
must have been perpetually offended and dis∣gusted
by a train of thinking, the most repug∣nant
to his own. His jealousy, however, for
the honour of Mosheim, provokes him to ar∣raign
the boldness of Mr. Gibbon, who pre∣sumes
<HI>falsely</HI> to charge such an eminent man
with <HI>unjustifiable assertions</HI><NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 131.</NOTE>. I might observe,
that my style, which on this occasion was more
modest and moderate, has acquired, perhaps
undesignedly, an illiberal cast from the rough
hand of Mr. Davis. But as my veracity is im∣peached,
I may be less solicitous about my po∣liteness;
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
and though I have repeatedly declined
the fairest opportunities of correcting the
errors of my predecessors, yet as long as I have
truth on my side, I am not easily daunted by
the names of the most eminent men.</P>
<P>The assertion of Mosheim, which did not
seem to be justified<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 676, Note 132.</NOTE> by the authority of Lac∣tantius,
was, that the wise and daughter of Di∣ocletian,
Prisca and <HI>Valeria,</HI> had been pri∣vately
<HI>baptized.</HI> Mr. Davis is sure that the
words of Mosheim, <Q REND="inline">Christianis sacris clam
initiata,</Q> need not be confined to the rite
of baptism; and he is equally sure, that the re∣ference
to Mosheim does not lead us to dis∣cover
even the name of Valeria. In both
these assurances he is grossly mistaken; but it
is the misfortune of controversy, that an error
may be committed in three or four words,
which cannot be rectified in less than thirty or
forty lines.</P>
<P N="1">1. The true and the sole meaning of the
Christian initiation, one of the familiar and fa∣vourite
allusions of the Fathers of the fourth
century, is clearly explained by the exact and
laborious Bingham. <Q REND="inline">The baptized were
also styled <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which the Latins
call <HI>initiati,</HI> the initiated, that is admitted to
the use of the <HI>sacred</HI> offices, and knowledge
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
of <HI>sacred</HI> mysteries of the Christian Religion.
Hence came that form of speaking so fre∣quently
used by St. Chrysostom, and other
ancient writers, when they touched upon
any doctrines or mysteries which the Cate∣chumens
understood not <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the initiated know what is spoken. St.
Ambrose writes a book to these <HI>initiati</HI>;
Isidore of Pelusium, and Hesychius call
them <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Whence the
Catechumens have the contrary names,
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the uniniti∣ated
or unbaptized.</Q> (Antiquities of the
Christian Church, l. i. c. 4. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. vol. i. p. 11.
fol. edit.) Had I presumed to suppose that
Mosheim was capable of employing a technical
expression in a loose and equivocal sense, I
should indeed have violated the respect which
I have always entertained for his learning and
abilities.</P>
<P N="2">2. But Mr. Davis cannot discover in the
text of Mosheim the name of Valeria. In that
case Mosheim would have suffered another
slight inaccuracy to drop from his pen, as the
passage of Lactantius, <Q REND="inline">sacrificio pollui coë∣git,</Q>
on which he founds his assertion, in∣cludes
the names both of Prisca and Valeria.
But I am not reduced to the necessity of accu∣sing
another in my own defence. Mosheim has
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
properly and expressly declared that Valeria
imitated the pious example of her mother Pris∣ca,
<Q REND="inline">Gener Diocletiani uxorem habebat <HI>Vale∣riam</HI>
matris exemplum pietate erga Deum
imitantem et a cultu fictorum Numinum
alienam.</Q> (Mosheim, p. 913.) Mr. Davis
has a bad habit of greedily snapping at the first
words of a reference, without giving himself
the trouble of going to the end of the page or
paragraph.</P>
<P>These trifling and peevish cavils would, per∣haps,
have been confounded with some criticisms
of the same stamp, on which I had bestowed a
slight, though sufficient notice, in the begin∣ning
of this article of Mosheim; had not my
attention been awakened by a peroration worthy
of Tertullian himself, if Tertullian had been
devoid of eloquence as well as of moderation—
<Q REND="inline">Much less does the Christian Mosheim give
our <HI>infidel Historian</HI> any pretext for inserting
that <HI>illiberal malignant insinuation,</HI> "That
Christianity has, in every age, acknowledged
its important obligations to FEMALE devo∣tion;"
the remark is truly <HI>contemptible</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 132.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is not my design to fill whole pages with
a tedious enumeration of the many illustrious
examples of female devotions, which, in every
age, and almost in every country, have pro∣moted
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
the interest of Christianity. Such in∣stances
will readily offer themselves to those
who have the slightest knowledge of Ecclesia∣stical
History; nor is it necessary that I should
remind them how much the charms, the influ∣ence,
the devotion of Clotilda, and of her
great-grand-daughter Bertha, contributed to
the conversion of France and England. Reli∣gion
may accept, without a blush, the services
of the purest and most gentle portion of the
human species: but there are some advocates
who would disgrace Christianity, if Christianity
could be disgraced, by the manner in which
they defend her cause.</P>

<P>As I could not readily procure the works of
Gregory of Nyssa, I borrowed<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 605. N. 156.</NOTE> from the accu∣rate
and indefatigable Tillemont, a passage in
the Life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, or the
Wonder-worker, which affirmed that when the
Saint took possession of his Episcopal See, he
found only SEVENTEEN <HI>Christians</HI> in the city of
Neo-Caesarea, and the adjacent country, <Q REND="inline">Les
environs, la Campagne, le pays d'alentour.</Q>
(Mem. Eccles. Tom. iv. p. 677. 691. Edit.
Brusselles, 1706). These expressions of Til∣lemont,
to whom I explicitly acknowledged
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
my obligation, appeared synonymous to the
word <HI>Diocese,</HI> the whole territory intrusted to
the pastoral care of the Wonder-worker, and
I added the epithet of <HI>extensive</HI>; because I was
apprised that Neo-Caesarea was the capital of
the Polemoniac Pontus, and that the whole
kingdom of Pontus, which stretched above
five hundred miles along the coast of the Eux∣ine,
was divided between sixteen or seventeen
Bishops. (See the Georgraphia Ecclesiastica of
Charles de St. Paul, and Lucas Hostenius,
p. 249, 250, 251.) Thus far I may not be
thought to have deserved any censure; but the
omission of the subsequent part of the same
passage, which imports that at his death the
Wonder-worker left no more than <HI>seventeen
Pagans,</HI> may seem to wear a partial and suspi∣cious
aspect.</P>
<P>Let me therefore first observe, as some evi∣dence
of an impartial disposition, that I <HI>easily</HI>
admitted, as the cool observation of the philo∣sophic
Lucian, the angry and interested com∣plaint
of the false prophet Alexander, that
Pontus was filled with Christians. This com∣plaint
was made under the reigns of Marcus or
of Commodus, with whom the impostor so
admirably exposed by Lucian was contempo∣rary:
and I had contented myself with remark∣ing
that the numbers of Christians must have
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
been very unequally distributed in the several
parts of Pontus, since the diocese of Neo-Cae∣sarea
contained, above sixty years afterwards,
only seventeen Christians. Such was the in∣considerable
flock which Gregory began to feed
about the year two hundred and forty, and the
real or fabulous conversions ascribed by that
Wonder-working Bishop during a reign of
thirty years, are totally foreign to the state
of Christianity in the preceding century.
This obvious reflection may serve to answer
the objection of Mr. Davis<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 136, 137.</NOTE>, and of another
adversary<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Dr. Randolph, in Chelsum's Remarks, p. 159, 160.</NOTE>, who on this occasion is more li∣beral

that in his Philosophy all sins are of equal
magnitude. Every error of fact or language,
every instance where he does not know to re∣concile

by the gentle word of misrepresentation.
An inaccurate appeal to the sentiment of Pagi,
on a subject where I must have been perfectly

vanity and ignorance. Pagi is neither a difficult

and so unhappily applied, as to betray a
very shameful ignorance, either of the English
language, or of the nature of this Chronologi∣cal
Question. The date of Pliny's govern∣ment
of Bithynia is not a fact recorded by any
ancient writer, but an opinion which modern
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
critics have variously formed, from the consi∣deration
of presumptive and collateral evidence.
Cardinal Baronius placed the consulship of
Pliny one year too late; and, as he was per∣suaded
the old practice of th republic still
subsisted, he naturally supposed that Pliny
obtained his province immediately after the
expiration of his consulship. He therefore
sends him into Bithynia in the year which,
according to his erroneous computation, co∣incided
with the year one hundred and four,
(Baron. Annal. Eccles. A. D. 103. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.
104. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1), or, according to the true chro∣nology,
with the year one hundred and
two, of the Christian Aera. This mistake of
Baronius, Pagi, with the assistance of his
friend Cardinal Noris, undertakes to correct.
From an accurate parallel of the Annals of
Trajan and the Epistles of Pliny, he deduces
his proofs that Pliny remained at Rome several
years after his Consulship: by his own inge∣nious,
though sometimes fanciful theory, of
the imperial Quinquennalia, &amp;c. Pagi at last
discovers that Pliny made his entrance into
Bithynia in the year one hundred and ten.
<Q REND="inline">Plinius igitur anno Christi CENTESIMO DE∣CIMO
Bithyniam intravit.</Q> Pagi, tom. i.
p. 100.</P>
<P>I will be more indulgent to my adversary
than he has been to me. I will admit, that he
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
has <HI>looked into Pagi</HI>; but I must add, that he
has only looked into that accurate Chronologer.
To rectify the errors, which, in the course of a
laborious and original work, had escaped the
diligence of the Cardinal, was the arduous task
which Pagi proposed to execute: and for the
sake of perspicuity, he distributes his criticisms
according to the particular dates, whether just
or faulty, of the Chronology of Baronius him∣self.
Under the year 102, Mr. Davis con∣fusedly
saw a long argument about Pliny and
Bithynia, and without condescending to read
the Author whom he <HI>pompously</HI> quotes, this
hasty Critic imputes to him the opinion which
he had so laboriously destroyed.</P>
<P>My readers, if any readers have accompani∣ed
me thus far, must be satisfied, and indeed
satiated, with the repeated proofs which I have
made of the weight and temper of my adver∣sary's
weapons. They have, in every assault,
fallen dead and lifeless to the ground: they
have more than once recoiled, and dangerously
wounded, the unskilful hand that had presumed
to use them. I have now examined all the
<HI>misrepresentations</HI> and <HI>inaccuracies,</HI> which even
for a moment could perplex the ignorant, or
deceive the credulous; the <HI>few</HI> imputations
which I have neglected, are still more palpably
false, or still more evidently trifling, and even
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
the friends of Mr. Davis will scarcely continue
to ascribe my contempt to my fear.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAGIA∣RISMS.</NOTE>
<P>The first part of his Critical Volume might
admit, though it did not deserve, a particular
reply. But the easy, though tedious compila∣tion,
which fills the remainder<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 168—274.</NOTE>, and which
Mr. Davis has produced as the evidence of my
shameful <HI>plagiarisms,</HI> may be set in its true
light by three or four short and general reflex∣ions.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mr. Davis has disposed, in two columns,
the passages which he thinks proper to select
from my Two last Chapters, and the corre∣sponding
passages from Middleton, Barbeyrac,
Beausobre, Dodwell, &amp;c. to the most import∣ant
of which he had been regularly guided by
my own quotations. According to the opi∣nion
which he has conceived of literary pro∣perty,
to <HI>agree</HI> is to <HI>follow,</HI> and to <HI>follow</HI> is to
<HI>steal.</HI> He celebrates his own sagacity with loud
and reiterated applause, declares with infinite
facetiousness, that if he restored to every au∣thor
the passages which Mr. Gibbon has
purloined, <HI>he</HI> would appear as naked as the
proud and gaudy Daw in the Fable, when
each bird had plucked away its own plumes.
Instead of being angry with Mr. Davis for the
parallel which he has extended to so great a
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
length, I am under some obligation to his
industry for the copious proofs which he has
furnished the reader, that my representation of
some of the most important facts of Ecclesiasti∣cal
Antiquity, is supported by the authority or
opinion of the most ingenious and learned of
the modern writers. The Public may not,
perhaps, be very eager to assist Mr. Davis in
his favourite amusement of <HI>depluming</HI> me.
They may think that if the materials which
compose my Two last Chapters are curious and
valuable, it is of little moment to whom they
properly belong. If my readers are satisfied
with the form, the colours, the new arrangement
which I have given to the labours of my pre∣decessors,
they may perhaps consider me not
as a contemptible Thief, but as an honest and
industrious Manufacturer, who has fairly pro∣cured
the raw materials, and worked them up
with a laudable degree of skill and success.</P>
<P N="2">II. About two hundred years ago, the Court
of Rome discovered that the system which had
been erected by ignorance must be defended
and countenanced by the aid, or at least by the
abuse, of science. The grosser legends of the
middle ages were abandoned to contempt, but
the supremacy and infallibility of two hundred
Popes, the virtues of many thousand Saints,
and the miracles which they either performed
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
or related, have been laboriously consecrated
in the Ecclesiastical Annals of Cardinal Baro∣nius.
A Theological Barometer might be
formed, of which the Cardinal and our coun∣tryman
Dr. Middleton should constitute the
opposite and remote extremities, as the former
sunk to the lowest degree of credulity, which
was compatible with learning, and the latter
rose to the highest pitch of scepticism, in any
wise consistent with Religion. The interme∣diate
gradations would be filled by a line of
ecclesiastical critics, whose rank has been fixed
by the circumstances of their temper and stu∣dies,
as well as by the spirit of the church or
society to which they were attached. It would
be amusing enough to calculate the weight of
prejudice in the air of Rome, of Oxford, of
Paris, and of Holland; and sometimes to ob∣serve
the irregular tendency of Papists towards
freedom, sometimes to remark the unnatural
gravitation of Protestants towards slavery. But
it is useful to borrow the assistance of so many
learned and ingenious men, who have viewed
the first ages of the Church in every light, and
from every situation. If we skilfully combine
the passions and prejudices, the hostile motives
and intentions, of the several theologians, we
may frequently extract knowledge from cre∣dulity,
moderation from zeal, and impartial
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
truth from the most disingenuous controversy.
It is the right, it is the duty of a critical histo∣rian
to collect, to weigh, to select the opinions
of his predecessors; and the more diligence he
has exerted in the search, the more rationally
he may hope to add some improvement to the
stock of knowledge, the use of which has been
common to all.</P>
<P N="3">III. Besides the ideas which may be sug∣gested
by the study of the most learned and
ingenious of the moderns, the historian may
be indebted to them for the occasional com∣munication
of some passages of the ancients,
which might otherwise have escaped his know∣ledge
or his memory. In the consideration of
any extensive subject, none will pretend to have
read all that has been written, or to recollect
all that they have read: nor is there any dis∣grace
in recurring to the writers who have pro∣fessedly
treated any questions, which in the
course of a long narrative we are called upon
to mention in a slight and incidental manner.
If I touch upon the obscure and fanciful theo∣logy
of the Gnostics, I can accept without a
blush the assistance of the candid Beausobre;
and when, amidst the fury of contending par∣ties,
I trace the progress of ecclesiastical domi∣nion,
I am not ashamed to confess myself the
grateful disciple of the impartial Mosheim.
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
In the next Volume of my History, the Reader
and the Critic must prepare themselves to see
me make a still more liberal use of the labours
of those indefatigable workmen who have dug
deep into the mine of antiquity. The Fathers
of the fourth and fifth centuries are far more
voluminous than their predecessors; the writings
of Jerom, of Augustin, of Chrysostom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
cover the walls of our libraries. The smallest
part is of the historical kind: yet the treatises
which seem the least to invite the curiosity of the
reader, frequently conceal very useful hints, or
very valuable facts. The polemic who in∣volves
himself and his antagonists in a cloud of
argumentation, sometimes relates the origin
and progress of the heresy which he confutes;
and the preacher who declaims against the
luxury, describes the manners, of the age;
and seasonably introduces the mention of some
public calamity, that he may ascribe it to the
justice of offended Heaven. It would surely
be unreasonable to expect that the historian
should peruse enormous volumes, with the un∣certain
hope of extracting a few interesting lines,
or that he should sacrifice whole days to the
momentary amusement of his Reader. For∣tunately
for us both, the diligence of ecclesi∣siastical
critics has facilitated our inquiries: the
compilations of Tillemont might alone be con∣sidered
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
as an immense repertory of truth and
fable, of almost all that the Fathers have pre∣served,
or invented, or believed; and if we
equally avail ourselves of the labours of con∣tending
sectaries, we shall often discover, that
the same passages which the prudence of one of
the disputants would have suppressed or dis∣guised,
are placed in the most conspicuous
light by the active and interested zeal of his
adversary. On these occasions, what is the
duty of a faithful historian, who derives from
some modern writer the knowledge of some
ancient testimony, which he is desirous of in∣troducing
into his own narrative? It is his
duty, and it has been my invariable practice,
to consult the original; to study with attention
the words, the design, the spirit, the context,
the situation of the passage to which I had
been referred; and before I appropriated it to
my own use, to justify my own declaration,
<Q REND="inline">that I had carefully examined all the origi∣nal
materials that could illustrate the subject
which I had undertaken to treat.</Q> If this
important obligation has sometimes been im∣perfectly
fulfilled, I have only omitted what it
would have been impracticable for me to per∣form.
The greatest city in the world is still
destitute of that useful institution, a public li∣brary;
and the writer who has undertaken to
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
treat any large historical subject, is reduced to
the necessity of purchasing, for his private use,
a numerous and valuable collection of the books
which must form the basis of his work. The
diligence of his booksellers will not always prove
successful; and the candour of his readers will
not <HI>always</HI> expect, that, for the sake of verify∣ing
an accidental quotation of ten lines, he
should load himself with a useless and expen∣sive
series of ten volumes. In a very few in∣stances,
where I had not the opportunity of
consulting the originals, I have adopted their
testimony on the faith of modern guides, of
whose fidelity I was satisfied; but on these oc∣casions<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 605, N. 156; p. 606, N. 161; p. 690, N. 164; p. 699, N. 178.</NOTE>, instead of decking myself with the
borrowed plumes of Tillemont or Lardner, I
have been most scrupulously exact in marking
the extent of my reading, and the source of
my information. This distinction, which a
sense of truth an modesty had engaged me to
express, is ungenerously abused by Mr. Davis,
who seems happy to inform his Readers, that
<Q REND="inline">in ONE instance (Chap. xvi. 164. or, in the
first edition, 163.) I have, by an unaccount∣able
oversight, unfortunately for myself, for∣got
to drop the modern, and that I modestly
disclaim all knowledge of Athanasius, but what
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
I had picked up from Tillemont<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 273.</NOTE>.</Q> Without
animadverting on the decency of these expres∣sions,
which are now grown familiar to me, I
shall content myself with observing, that as I
had frequently quoted Eusebius, or Cyprian,
or Tertullian, <HI>because</HI> I had read them; so, in
this instance, I only made my reference to Til∣lemont,
<HI>because</HI> I had not read, and did not
possess, the works of Athanasius. The pro∣gress
of my undertaking has since directed me
to peruse the Historical Apologies of the Arch∣bishop
of Alexandria, whose life is a very in∣teresting
part of the age in which he lived;
and if Mr. Davis should have the curiosity to
look into my Second Volume, he will find that
I make a free and frequent appeal to the writ∣ings
of Athanasius. Whatever may be the
opinion or practice of my adversary, this I ap∣prehend
to be the dealing of a fair and honour∣able
man.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The historical monuments of the three
first centuries of ecclesiastical antiquity are nei∣ther
very numerous, nor very prolix. From
the end of the Act of the Apostles, to the time
when the first Apology of Justin Martyr was
presented, there intervened a dark and doubt∣ful
period of fourscore years; and, even if the
Epistles of Ignatius should be approved by the
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
critic, they could not be very serviceable to
the historian. From the middle of the second
to the beginning of the fourth century, we
gain our knowledge of the state and progress
of Christianity from the successive Apologies
which were occasionally composed by Justin,
Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, <HI>&amp;c</HI>; from
the Epistles of Cyprian; from a few <HI>sincere</HI> acts
of the Martyrs; from some moral or contro∣versial
tracts, which indirectly explain the events
and manners of the times; from the rare and
accidental notice which profane writers have
taken of the Christian sect; from the decla∣matory
Narrative which celebrates the deaths
of the persecutors; and from the Ecclesiastical
History of Eusebius, who has preserved some
valuable fragments of more early writers.
Since the revival of letters, these original ma∣terials
have been the common fund of critics
and historians: nor has it ever been imagined,
that the absolute and exclusive property of a
passage in Eusebius or Tertullian was acquired
by the first who had an opportunity of quoting
it. The learned work of Mosheim, <HI>de Rebus
Christianis ante Constantinum,</HI> was printed in the
year 1753; and if I were possessed of the pa∣tience
and disingenuity of Mr. Davis, I would
engage to find all the ancient testimonies that
he has alleged, in the writings of Dodwell or
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Tillemont, which were published before the
end of the last century. But if I were animated
by any malevolent intentions against Dodwell
or Tillemont, I could as easily, and as unfairly,
fix on <HI>them</HI> the guilt of Plagiarism, by pro∣ducing
the same passages transcribed or trans∣lated
at full length in the Annals of Cardinal
Baronius. Let not criticism be any longer dis∣graced
by the practice of such unworthy arts.
Instead of admitting suspicions as false as they
are ungenerous, condour will acknowledge,
that Mosheim or Dodwell, Tillemont or Baro∣nius,
enjoyed the same right, and often were
under the same obligation, of quoting the pas∣sages
which they had read, and which were in∣dispensably
requisite to confirm the truth and
substance of their similar narratives. Mr. Davis
is so far from allowing me the benefit of this
common indulgence, or rather of this common
right, that he stigmatizes with the name of
<HI>Plagiarism</HI> a close and literal agreement with
Dodwell in the account of some parts of the
persecution of Diocletian, where a few chap∣ters
of Eusebius and Lactantius, perhaps of
Lactantius alone, are the sole materials from
whence our knowledge could be derived, and
where, if I had not transcribed, I must have
invented. He is even bold enough (<HI>bold</HI> is not
the <HI>proper</HI> word) to conceive some hopes of
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
persuading his readers, that in Historian who
has employed several years of his life, and
several hundred pages, on the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire, had never read Orosius,
or the Augustan History; and that he was
forced to borrow, at second-hand, his quota∣tions
from the Theodosian Code. I cannot
profess myself very desirous of Mr. Davis's ac∣quaintance;
but if he will take the trouble of
calling at my house any afternoon when I am
<HI>not</HI> at home, my servant shall shew him my
library, which he will find tolerably well fur∣nished
with the useful authors, ancient as well
as modern, ecclesiastical as well as profane,
who have <HI>directly</HI> supplied me with the mate∣rials
of my History.</P>
<P>The peculiar reasons, and they are not of the
most flattering kind, which urged me to repel
the furious and feeble attack of Mr. Davis,
have been already mentioned. But since I am
drawn thus reluctantly into the lists of contro∣versy,
I shall not retire till I have saluted, ei∣ther
with stern defiance or gentle courtesy,
the theological champions who have signalized
their ardour to break a lance against the shield
of a <HI>Pagan</HI> adversary. The fifteenth and six∣teenth
Chapters have been honoured with the
notice of several writers, whose names and
characters seemed to promise more maturity of
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
judgment and learning than could reasonably
be expected from the unfinished studies of a
Batchelor of Arts. The Reverend Mr. Ap∣thorpe,
Dr. Watson, the Regius Professor of
Divinity in the University of Cambridge, Dr.
Chelsum of Christ Church, and his associate
Dr. Randolph, President of Christ Church
College, and the Lady Margaret's Professor of
Divinity in the University of Oxford, have
given me a fair right, which, however, I shall
not abuse, of freely declaring my opinion on
the subject of their respective criticisms.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. APTHORPE.</NOTE>
<P>If I am not mistaken, Mr. Apthorpe was
the first who announced to the Public his in∣tention
of examining the interesting subject
which I had treated in the Two last Chapters of
my History. The multitude of collateral and
accessary ideas which presented themselves to
the Author insensibly swelled the bulk of his
papers to the size of a large volume in octavo;
the publication was delayed many months be∣yond
the time of the first advertisement; and
when Mr. Apthorpe's Letters appeared, I
was surprised to find, that I had <HI>scarcely</HI> any
interest or concern in their contents. They are
filled with general observations on the Study
of History, with a large and useful catalogue
of Historians, and with a variety of reflections,
moral and religious, all preparatory to the di∣rect
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
and formal consideration of my Two last
Chapters, which Mr. Apthorpe seems to re∣serve
for the subject of a second Volume. I
sincerely respect the learning, the piety, and
the candour of this Gentleman, and must con∣sider
it as a mark of his esteem, that he has
thought proper to begin his approaches at so
great a distance from the fortifications which
he designed to attack.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DR. WAT∣SON.</NOTE>
<P>When Dr. Watson gave to the Public his
Apology for Christianity, in a Series of Let∣ters,
he addressed them to the Author of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, with
a just confidence that he had considered this
important object in a manner not unworthy of
his antagonist or of himself. Dr. Watson's
mode of thinking bears a liberal and philoso∣phic
cast; his thoughts are expressed with
spirit, and that spirit is always tempered by
politeness and moderation. Such is the man
whom I should be happy to call my friend,
and whom I should not blush to call my an∣tagonist.
But the same motives which might
tempt me to accept, or even to solicit, a pri∣vate
and amicable conference, dissuaded me
from entering into a public controversy with a
Writer of so respectable a character; and I em∣braced
the earliest opportunity of expressing to
Dr. Watson himself, how sincerely I agreed
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
with him in thinking, <Q REND="inline">That as the world is
now possessed of the opinion of us both upon
the subject in question, it may be perhaps
as proper for us both to leave it in this
state<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Watson's Apology for Christianity, p. 200.</NOTE>.</Q> The nature of the ingenious Pro∣fessor's
Apology contributed to strengthen the
insuperable reluctance to engage in hostile al∣tercation
which was common to us both, by
convincing me, that such an altercation was
unnecessary as well as unpleasant. He very
justly and politely declares, that a consider∣able
part, near seventy pages, of his small vo∣lume
are not directed to me<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 202—268.</NOTE>, but to a set of
men whom he places in an odious and con∣temptible
light. He leaves to other hands the
defence of the leading Ecclesiastics, even of
the primitive church; and without being <HI>very</HI>
anxious, either to soften their vices and indis∣cretion,
or to aggravate the cruelty of the
Heathen Persecutors, he passes over in silence
the greatest part of my Sixteenth Chapter. It
is not so much the purpose of the Apologist to
examine the facts which have been advanced
by the Historian, as to remove the impressions
which may have been formed by many of his
Readers; and the remarks of Dr. Watson consist
more properly of general argumentation than of
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
particular criticism. He fairly owns, that I
have expressly allowed the full and irresistible
weight of the <HI>first</HI> great cause of the success of
Christianity<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Watson's Apology for Christianity, p. 5.</NOTE>, and he is too candid to deny
that the five <HI>secondary</HI> causes, which I had at∣tempted
to explain, operated with <HI>some</HI> degree
of active energy towards the accomplishment
of that great event. The only question which
remains between us, relates to the <HI>degree</HI> of
the weight and effect of those secondary causes;
and as I am persuaded that our philosophy is
not of the dogmatic kind, we should soon ac∣knowledge
that this precise degree cannot be
ascertained by reasoning, nor perhaps be ex∣pressed
by words. In the course of this en∣quiry,
some incidental difficulties have arisen,
which I had stated with impartiality, and which
Dr. Watson resolves with ingenuity and tem∣per.
If in some instances he seems to have
misapprehended my sentiments, I may hesitate
whether I should impute the fault to my own
want of clearness or to his want of attention,
but I can never entertain a suspicion that Dr.
Watson would descend to employ the disinge∣nuous
arts of vulgar controversy.</P>
<P>There is, however, one passage, and one pas∣sage
only, which must not pass without some
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
explanation; and I shall the more eagerly em∣brace
this occasion to illustrate what I had said,
as the misconstruction of my true meaning
seems to have made an involuntary, but unfa∣vourable,
impression on the liberal mind of Dr.
Watson. As I endeavour <HI>not</HI> to palliate the
severity, but to discover the motives, of the
Roman Magistrates. I had remarked, <Q REND="inline">it
was in vain that the oppressed Believer
asserted the unalienable rights of con∣science
and private judgment. Though his
situation might excite the pity, his argu∣ments
could never reach the understanding,
either of the philosophic or of the believing
part of the Pagan world<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 625.</NOTE>.</Q> The humanity
of Dr. Watson takes fire on the supposed pro∣vocation,
and he asks me with unusual quick∣ness,
<Q REND="inline">How, Sir, are the arguments for liberty
of conscience so exceedingly inconclusive,
that you think them incapable of reaching
the understanding even of philosophers<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Watson, p. 185.</NOTE>?</Q>
He continues to observe, that a captious ad∣versary
would embrace with avidity the op∣portunity
this passage <HI>affords</HI> of blotting my
character with the odious stain of being a Per∣secutor;
a stain which no learning can wipe
out, which no genius or ability can render
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
amiable; and though he himself does not en∣tertain
such an opinion of my principles, his
ingenuity tries in vain to provide me with the
means of escape.</P>
<P>I must lament that I have not been success∣ful
in the explanation of a very simple notion
of the spirit both of philosophy and of poly∣theism,
which I have repeatedly inculcated.
The arguments which assert the rights of con∣science
are not inconclusive in themselves, but
the understanding of the Greeks and Romans
was fortified against their evidence by an in∣vincible
prejudice. When we listen to the voice
of Bayle, of Locke, and of genuine reason, in
favour of religious toleration, we shall easily
perceive that our most forcible appeal is made
to our mutual feelings. If the Jew was al∣lowed
to argue with the Inquisitor, he would
request that for a moment they might ex∣change
their different situations, and might
safely ask his Catholic Tyrant, whether the fear
of death would compel <HI>him</HI> to enter the syna∣as
gogue, to receive the mark of circumcision,
and to partake of the paschal lamb. As soon
as the case of persecution was brought home to
the breast of the Inquisitor, he must have sound
some difficulty in suppressing the dictates of
natural equity, which would insinuate to his
conscience, that he could have no right to in∣flict
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
those punishments which, under similar
circumstances, he would esteem it as his duty
to encounter. But this argument could not
reach the understanding of a Polytheist, or of
an ancient Philosopher. The former was ready,
whenever he was summoned, or indeed with∣out
being summoned, to fall prostrate before
the altars of any Gods who were adored in any
part of the world, and to admit a vague per∣suasion
of the <HI>truth</HI> and divinity of the most
different modes of religion. The Philosopher,
who considered them, at least in their literal
sense, as equally <HI>false</HI> and absurd, was not
ashamed to disguise his sentiments, and to
frame his actions according to the laws of his
country, which imposed the same obligation
on the philosophers and the people. When
Pliny declared, that whatever was the opinion
of the Christians, their obstinacy deserved pu∣nishment,
the absurd cruelty of Pliny was
excused in his own eye, by the consciousness
that, in the situation of the Christians, he would
not have refused the religious compliance which
he exacted. I shall not repeat, that the Pa∣gan
worship was a matter, not of <HI>opinion,</HI>
but of <HI>custom</HI>; that the toleration of the Ro∣mans
was confined to nations or families who
followed the practice of their ancestors; and
that in the first ages of Christianity their per∣secution
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
of the individuals who departed from
the established religion was neither moderated
by pure reason, nor inflamed by exclusive zeal.
But I only desire to appeal from the hasty ap∣prehension
to the more deliberate judgment of
Dr. Watson himself. Should there still remain
any difference of opinion between us, I shall be
satisfied, if he will consider me as a sincere,
though perhaps unsuccessful, lover of truth,
and as a firm friend to civil and ecclesiastical
freedom.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">DR. CHEL∣SUM and D. RAN∣DOLPH.</NOTE>
<P>Far be it from me, or from any faithful
Historian, to impute to respectable societies
the faults of some individual members. Our
two Universities most undoubtedly contain the
same mixture, and most probably the same
proportions, of zeal and moderation, of reason
and superstition. Yet there is much less dif∣ference
between the smoothness of the Ionic
and the roughness of the Doric dialect, than
may be found between the polished style of Dr.
Watson, and the coarse language of Mr. Davis,
Dr. Chelsum, or Dr. Randolph. The second
of these Critics, Dr. Chelsum of Christ Church,
is unwilling that the world should forget that
<HI>he</HI> was the first who sounded to arms, that <HI>he</HI>
was the first who furnished the antidote to the
poison, and who, as early as the month of
October of the year 1776, published his <HI>Stric∣tures</HI>
on the Two last Chapters of Mr. Gibbon's
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
History. The success of a pamphlet, which
he modestly styles imperfect and ill-digested,
encouraged him to resume the controversy.
In the beginning of the present year, his Re∣marks
made their second appearance, with some
alteration of form, and a large increase of
bulk; and the author, who seems to fight un∣der
the protection of two episcopal banners,
has prefixed, in the front of his volume, his
name and titles, which in the former edition he
had less honourably suppressed. His confidence
is fortified by the alliance and communications
of a <HI>distinguished</HI> Writer, Dr. Randolph, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who, on a proper occasion, would, no doubt,
be ready to bear as honourable testimony to
the merit and reputation of Dr. Chelsum. The
two friends are indeed so happily united by art
and nature, that if the author of the Remarks
had not pointed out the valuable communica∣cations
of the Margaret Professor, it would
have been impossible to separate their respective
property. Writers who possess any freedom of
mind, may be known from each other by the
peculiar character of their style and sentiments;
but the champions who are inlisted in the ser∣vice
of Authority, commonly wear the uniform
of the regiment. Oppressed with the same
yoke, covered with the same trappings, they
heavily move along, perhaps not with an equal
pace, in the same beaten track of prejudice and
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
preferment. Yet I should expose my own in∣justice,
were I absolutely to confound with
Mr. Davis the two Doctors in Divinity, who
are joined in one volume. The three Critics
appear to be animated by the same implacable
resentment against the Historian of the Roman
Empire; they are alike disposed to support
the same opinions by the same arts; and if in
the language of the two latter the disregard of
politeness is somewhat less gross and indecent,
the difference is not of such a magnitude as to
excite in my breast any lively sensations of
gratitude. It was the misfortune of Mr. Davis
that he undertook to <HI>write</HI> before he had <HI>read.</HI>
He set out with the stock of authorities which
he found in my quotations, and boldly ven∣tured
to play his reputation against mine. Per∣haps
he may now repent of a loss which is not
easily recovered; but if I had not surmounted
my almost insuperable reluctance to a public
dispute, many a reader might still be dazzled
by the vehemence of his assertions, and might
still believe that Mr. Davis had detected se∣veral
wilful and important misrepresentations
in my Two last Chapters. But the confederate
Doctors appear to be scholars of a higher form
and longer experience; they enjoy a certain
rank in their academical world; and as their
zeal is enlightened by some rays of knowledge,
so their desire to ruin the credit of their adver∣sary
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
is occasionally checked by the apprehen∣sion
of injuring their own. These restraints,
to which Mr. Davis was a stranger, have con∣fined
them to a very narrow and humble path
of historical criticism; and if I were to correct,
according to their wishes, all the particular
facts against which they have advanced any ob∣jections,
these corrections, admitted in their
fullest extent, would hardly furnish materials
for a decent list of <HI>errata.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>dogmatical</HI> part of their work, which in

is ill adapted to engage my attention.
I had declined the consideration of theologi∣cal
arguments, when they were managed by a
candid and liberal adversary; and it would be
inconsistent enough, if I should have refused to
draw my sword in honourable combat against
the keen and well-tempered weapon of Dr.
Watson, for the sole purpose of encountering
the rustic cudgel of two staunch and sturdy Po∣lemics.</P>
<P>I shall not enter any farther into the cha∣racter

Egypt<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Chelsum's Remarks, p. 13—19. 67—91. 180—185.</NOTE>. If I have rejected, and rejected with
some contempt, the <HI>interpolation</HI> which pious

of Josephus, I may deem myself secure behind
the shield of learned and pious critics (See in
particular Le Clerc, in his Ars Critica, part
iii. sect. i. c. 15. and Lardner's Testimonies,
Vol. i. p. 150, &amp;c.), who have condemned
this passage: and I think it very natural that
Dr. Chelsum should embrace the contrary opi∣nion,
which is not destitute of able advocates.
The passages of Irenaeus and Theophilus were
thoroughly sifted in the controversy about the
duration of Miracles; and as the Works of Dr.
Middleton may be found in every library, so
it is not impossible that a diligent search may
still discover some remains of the writings of
his adversaries. In mentioning the confession
of the Syrians of Palestine, that they had received
from Egypt the rite of circumcision, I had sim∣ply
alleged the testimony of Herodotus, without
expressly adopting the sentiment of Marsham.
But I had always imagined, that in these doubt∣ful
and indifferent questions, which have been so∣lemnly
argued before the tribunal of the Public,
every scholar was at liberty to chuse his side,
without assigning his reasons; nor can I yet
persuade myself, that either Dr. Chelsum, or
myself, are likely to enforce, by any new argu∣ments,
the opinions which we have respectively
followed. The only novelty for which I can
perceive myself indebted to Dr. Chelsum, is
the very extraordinary Scepticism which he in∣sinuates
concerning the time of Herodotus,
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
who, according to the chronology of some, flou∣rished
during the time of the Jewish captivity<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 15.</NOTE>.
Can it be necessary to inform a Divine, that
the captivity which lasted seventy years, ac∣cording
to the prophecy of Jeremiah, was ter∣minated
in the year 536 before Christ, by the
edict which Cyrus published in the first year of
his reign (Jeremiah, xxv. 11, 12. xxix. 10.
Ezra, i. 1. &amp;c. Usher and Prideaux, under the
years 606 and 536.)? Can it be necessary to in∣form
a man of letters, that Herodotus was
fifty-three years old at the commencement of
the Peloponnesian war (Aulus Gellius, Noct.
Attic. xv. 23. from the Commentaries of Pam∣phila),
and consequently that he was born in
the year before Christ 484, fifty-two years
after the end of the Jewish captivity? As this
well attested fact is not exposed to the slightest
doubt or difficulty, I am somewhat curious to
learn the names of those unknown authors,
whose chronology Dr. Chelsum has allowed as
the specious foundation of a probable hypothe∣sis.
The Author of the Remarks, does not
seem indeed to have cultivated, with much care
or success, the province of literary history; as
a very moderate acquaintance with that useful
branch of knowledge would have saved him
from a positive mistake, much less excusable
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
than the doubt which he entertains about the
time of Herodotus. He styles Suidas <Q REND="inline">a
<HI>Heathen</HI> writer, who lived about the end of
the <HI>tenth</HI> century<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Chelsum. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</Q> I admit the period
which he assigns to Suidas; and which is well
ascertained by Dr. Bentley (See his Reply to
Boyle, p. 22, 23.) We are led to fix this
epoch by the chronology which this <HI>Heathen</HI>
writer has deduced from Adam, to the death of
the emperor John Zimisces, A. D. 975: and a
crowd of passages might be produced, as the
unaswerable evidence of his Christianity. But
the most unanswerable of all is the very date,
which is not disputed between us. The philo∣sophers
who flourished under Justinian (See
Agathias, l. ii. p. 65, 66.), appear to have
been the last of the Heathen writers: and the
ancient religion of the Greeks was annihilated
almost four hundred years before the birth of
Suidas.</P>
<P>After this animadversion, which is not in∣tended
either to insult the failings of my Ad∣versary,
or to provide a convenient excuse for
my own errors, I shall proceed to select <HI>two</HI>
important parts of Dr. Chelsum's Remarks,
from which the candid reader may form some
opinion of the whole. They relate to the mi∣litary
service of the first Christians, and to the
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
historical character of Eusebius; and I shall re∣view
them with the less reluctance, as it may
not be impossible to pick up something curious
and useful even in the barren waste of contro∣versy.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">

<NOTE PLACE="marg">MILITARY SERVICE OF THE FIRST CHRISTI∣ANS.</NOTE>
<P>In representing the errors of the primitive
Christians, which flowed from an excess of vir∣tue,
I had observed, <HI>that</HI> they exposed them∣selves
to the reproaches of the Pagans, by their
obstinate refusal to take an active part in the
civil administration, or military defence of the
empire; <HI>that</HI> the objections of Celsus appear
to have been mutilated by his adversary Ori∣gen,
and <HI>that</HI> the Apologists, to whom the
public dangers were urged, returned obscure
and ambiguous answers, as they were unwilling
to disclose the true ground of their security,
their opinion of the approaching end of the
world<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 580, 581.</NOTE>. In another place I had related, from
the Acts of Ruinart, the action and punishment
of the Centurion Marcellus, who was put to
death for renouncing the service in a public
and seditious manner<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 680.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On this occasion Dr. Chelsum is extremely
alert. He denies my facts, controverts my
opinions, and, with a politeness worthy of Mr.
Davis himself, insinuates that I borrowed the
<PB N="108" REF="110"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="109" REF="111"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="106" REF="112"/>

story of Marcellus, not from Ruinart, but
from Voltaire. My learned Adversary thinks
it highly improbable that Origen should dare to
<HI>mutilate</HI> the objections of Celsus, <Q REND="inline">whose work
was, in all probability, extant at the time he
made this reply. In such case, had he even
been inclined to treat his adversary unfairly,
he must yet surely have been with-held from
the attempt, through the fear of detec∣tion<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 118, 119.</NOTE>.</Q>
The experience both of ancient
and modern controversy, has indeed convinced
me that this reasoning, just and natural as it
may seem, is totally inconclusive, and that the
generality of disputants, especially in religious
contests, are of a much more daring and intre∣pid
spirit. For the truth of this remark, I shall
content myself with producing a recent and very
singular example, in which Dr. Chelsum him∣self
is personally interested. He charges<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 188.</NOTE> me
with passing over in <Q REND="inline">silence the important
and unsuspected testimony of a Heathen hi∣storian
(Dion Cassius) to the persecution of
Domitian; and he affirms, that I have pro∣duced
that testimony so far only as it relates
to Clemens and Domitilla; yet in the very
same passage, follows immediately, that on
a like accusation MANY OTHERS were also
condemned. Some of them were put to
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
death, others suffered the confiscation of
their goods<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 645.</NOTE>.</Q> Although I should not be
ashamed to undertake the apology of Nero or
Domitian, if I thought them innocent of any
particular crime with which zeal or malice had
unjustly branded their memory; yet I should
indeed blush, if, in favour of tyranny, or even
in favour of virtue, I had suppressed the truth
and evidence of historical facts. But the
Reader will feel some surprize, when he has
convinced himself that, in the three editions of
my First Volume, after relating the death of
Clemens, and the exile of Domitilla, I continue
to allege the ENTIRE TESTIMONY of Dion, in
the following words: <Q REND="inline">and sentences either
of death, or of confiscation, were pronounced
against a GREAT NUMBER OF PERSONS who
were involved in the SAME accusation. The
guilt imputed to their charge, was that of
Atheism and Jewish manners; a singular
association of ideas which cannot with any
propriety be applied except to the Christians,
as they were obscurely and imperfectly
viewed by the magistrates and writers of
that period.</Q> Dr. Chelsum has not been
deterred, by the fear of detection, from this
scandalous mutilation of the popular work of a
living adversary. But Celsus had been dead
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
above fifty years before Origen published his
Apology; and the copies of an ancient work,
instead of being instantaneously multiplied by
the operation of the press, were separately and
slowly transcribed by the labour of the hand.</P>
<P>If any modern Divine should still maintain
that the fidelity of Origen was secured by mo∣tives
more honourable than the fear of detec∣tion,
he may learn from Jerom the difference
of the <HI>gymnastic</HI> and <HI>dogmatic</HI> styles. Truth is
the object of the one, Victory of the other;
and the same arts which would disgrace the
sincerity of the teacher, serve only to display
the skill of the disputant. After justifying his
own practice by that of the orators and philo∣sophers,
Jerom defends himself by the more
respectable authority of Christian Apologists.
<Q REND="inline">How many thousand lines, says he, have

Consider with what arguments, with what

defend.</Q> <Q REND="inline">Origenes, &amp;c. multis versuum

Gentiles.</Q> (Pro Libris advers. Jovinian.
Apolog. Tom. ii. p. 135.)</P>
<P>Yet Dr. Chelsum may still ask, and he has
a right to ask, why in this particular instance I
suspect the pious Origen of mutilating the ob∣jections
of his adversary. From a very obvi∣ous,
and, in my opinion, a very decisive cir∣cumstance.
Celsus was a Greek philosopher,
the friend of Lucian; and I thought that al∣though
he might support error by sophistry, he
would not write nonsense in his own language.
I renounce my suspicion, if the most attentive
reader is able to understand the design and pur∣port
of a passage which is given as a formal
quotation from Celsus, and which begins with
the following words: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
&amp;c. (Origen contr. Celsum, l. viii.
p. 425. edit. Spencer, Cantab. 1677.) I have
carefully inspected the original, I have availed
myself of the learning of Spencer, and even
Bouhereau (for I shall always disclaim the ab∣surd
and affected pedantry of using without
scruple a Latin version, but of despising the
aid of a French translation), and the ill success
of my efforts has countenanced the suspicion to
which I still adhere, with a just mixture of
doubt and hesitation. Origen very boldly de∣nies,
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
that any of the Christians have affirmed
what is imputed to them by Celsus, in this un∣intelligible
quotation; and it may easily be cre∣dited,
that none had maintained what none
can comprehend. Dr. Chelsum has produced
the words of Origen; but on this occasion
there is a strange ambiguity in the language of
the modern Divine<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 118.</NOTE>, as if he wished to insinu∣ate
what he dared not affirm; and every reader
must conclude, from his state of the question,
that Origen expressly denied the truth of the
<HI>accusation</HI> of Celsus, who had <HI>accused</HI> the Chri∣stians
of declining to assist their fellow-subjects
in the military defence of the empire, assailed
on every side by the arms of the Barbarians.</P>
<P>Will Dr. Chelsum justify to the world, can
he justify to his own feelings, the abuse which
he has made even of the privileges of the Gym∣nastic
style? Careless and hasty indeed must
have been his perusal of Origen, if he did not
perceive that the ancient Apologist, who makes
a stand on some incidental question, admits
the accusation of his adversary, that the Chri∣stians
<HI>refused</HI> to bear arms even at the com∣mand
of their Sovereign. "<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>" (Origen, l. viii. p. 427.)
He endeavours to palliate this undutiful refu∣sal,
by representing that the Christians had
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
their peculiar camps, in which they incessantly
combated for the safety of the emperor and
the empire by lifting up their right hands—in
prayer. The Apologist seems to hope that his
country will be satisfied with this spiritual aid,
and dexterously confounding the colleges of
Roman priests with the multitudes which swelled
the Catholic Church, he claims for his bre∣thren,
in all the provinces, the exemption
from military service, which was enjoyed by
the sacerdotal order. But as this excuse might
not readily be allowed, Origen looks forwards
with a lively faith to that auspicious Revolu∣tion,
which Celsus had rejected as impossible,
when all the nations of the habitable earth, re∣nouncing
their passions and their arms, should
embrace the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and
lead a life of peace and innocence under the
immediate protection of Heaven. The faith
of Origen seems to be principally founded on
the predictions of the Prophet Zephaniah (See
iii. 9, 10.); and he prudently observes, that
the Prophets often speak secret things (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
p. 426.) which may be under∣stood
by those who can understand them; and
that if this stupendous change cannot be ef∣fected
while we retain our bodies, it may be
accomplished as soon as we shall be released
from them. Such is the reasoning of Origen:
though I have not followed the order, I have
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
faithfully preserved the substance of it; which
fully justifies the truth and propriety of my
observations.</P>
<P>The execution of Marcellus, the Centurion,
is naturally connected with the Apology of
Origen, as the former declared by his actions,
what the latter had affirmed in his writings,
that the conscience of a devout Christian would
not allow him to bear arms, even at the com∣mand
of his Sovereign. I had represented this
religious scruple as <HI>one</HI> of the motives which
provoked Marcellus, on the day of a public
festival, to throw away the ensigns of his of∣fice;
and I presumed to observe, that such
an act of desertion would have been punished
in any government according to martial or
even civil law. Dr. Chelsum<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 114—117.</NOTE> very <HI>bluntly</HI>
accuses me of misrepresenting the story, and of
suppressing those circumstances which would
have defended the Centurion from the unjust
imputation thrown by me upon his conduct.
The dispute between the Advocate for Mar∣cellus
and myself, lies in a very narrow com∣pass;
as the whole evidence is comprized in a
short, simple, and, I believe, authentic nar∣rative.</P>
<P N="1">1. In another place I observed, and even
pressed the observation, <Q REND="inline">that the innume∣rable
Deities and rites of Polytheism were
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
closely interwoven with every circumstance
of business or pleasure, of public or of private
life;</Q> and I had particularly specified how
much the Roman discipline was connected with
the national superstition. A solemn oath of
fidelity was repeated every year in the name of
the Gods and of the genius of the Emperor,
public and daily sacrifices were performed at the
head of the camp, the legionary was continually
tempted, or rather compelled to join in the ido∣latrous
worship of his fellow-soldiers, and had
not any scruples been entertained of the law∣fulness
of war, it is not easy to understand how
any serious Christian could inlist under a ban∣ner
which has been justly termed the <HI>rival of
the Cross.</HI> "Vexilla aemula Christi." (Ter∣tullian
de Corona Militis, c. xi.) With regard
to the soldiers, who before their conversion
were already engaged in the military life, fear,
habit, ignorance, necessity might bend them to
some acts of occasional conformity; and as
long as they abstained from absolute and in∣tentional
idolatry, their behaviour was excused
by the indulgent, and censured by the more
rigid casuists. (See the whole Treatise <HI>De Co∣ronâ
Militis.</HI>) We are ignorant of the adven∣tures
and character of the Centurion Marcellus,
how long he had conciliated the profession of
arms and of the Gospel, whether he was only a
Catechumen, or whether he was initiated by
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
the Sacrament of Baptism. We are likewise at
a loss to ascertain the particular act of idolatry
which so suddenly and so forcibly provoked his
pious indignation. As he declared his faith in
the midst of a public entertainment given on
the birth-day of Galerius, he must have been
startled by some of the sacred and convivial
rites (Convivia ista profana reputans) of
prayers, or vows, or libations, or, perhaps, by
the offensive circumstance of eating the meats
which had been offered to the idols. But the
scruples of Marcellus were not confined to
these accidental impurities; they evidently
reached the essential duties of his profession;
and when before the tribunal of the magi∣strates,
he avowed his faith at the hazard of
his life, the Centurion declared, as his cool
and determined persuasion, that it does not
become a Christian man, who is the soldier of
the Lord Christ, to bear arms for any object
of earthly concern. <Q REND="inline">Non enim decebat
Christianum hominem molestiis secularibus
militare, qui Christo Domino militat.</Q> A
formal declaration, which clearly disengages
from each other the different questions of war
and idolatry. With regard to both these
questions, as they were understood by the pri∣mitive
Christians, I wish to refer the Reader
to the sentiments and authorities of Mr. Moyle,
a bold and ingenious critic, who read the Fa∣thers
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
as their judge, and not as their slave,
and who has refuted, with the most patient
candour, all that learned prejudice could sug∣gest
in favour of the silly story of the thunder∣ing
legion. (See Moyle's Works, Vol. ii.
p. 84—88. 111—116. 163—212. 298—302.
327—341.) And here let me add, that the
passage of Origen, who in the name of his bre∣thren
disclaims the duty of military service, is
understood by Mr. Moyle in its true and ob∣vious
signification.</P>
<P N="2">2. I know not where Dr. Chelsum has im∣bibed
the principles of logic or morality which
teach him to approve the conduct of Marcel∣lus,
who threw down his rod, his belt, and
his arms, at the head of the legion, and pub∣licly
renounced the military service, <HI>at the very
time</HI> when he found himself obliged to offer sa∣crifice.
Yet surely this is a very false notion
of the condition and duties of a Roman Cen∣turion.
Marcellus was bound, by a solemn
oath, to serve with fidelity till he should be
regularly discharged; and according to the
sentiments which Dr. Chelsum ascribes to him,
he was not released from this oath by any mis∣taken
opinion of the unlawfulness of war. I
would propose it as a case of conscience to any
philosopher, or even to any casuist in Europe,
Whether a particular order, which cannot
be reconciled with virtue or piety, dissolves the
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
ties of a general and lawful obligation? And
whether, if they had been consulted by the
Christian Centurion, they would not have di∣rected
him to increase his diligence in the execu∣tion
of his military functions, to refuse to yield to
any act of idolatry, and patiently to expect the
consequences of such a refusal? But instead of
obeying the mild and moderate dictates of re∣ligion,
instead of distinguishing between the
duties of the soldier and of the Christian, Mar∣cellus,
with imprudent zeal, rushed forwards
to seize the crown of martyrdom. He might
have privately confessed himself guilty to the
tribune or praefect under whom he served: he
chose on the day of a public festival to disturb
the order of the camp. He insulted without
necessity the religion of his Sovereign and of
his country, by the epithets of contempt which
he bestowed on the Roman Gods. <Q REND="inline">Deos
vestros ligneos et lapideos, adorare contemno,
quae sunt idola surda et muta.</Q> Nay more:
at the head of the legion, and in the face of
the standards, the Centurion Marcellus openly
renounced his allegiance to the Emperors. <Q REND="inline">Exhoc
militare IMPERATORIBUS VESTRIS de∣sisto;</Q>
From this moment I no longer serve
YOUR EMPERORS, are the important words of
Marcellus, which his advocate has not thought
proper to translate. I again make my appeal
to any lawyer, to any military man, Whether,
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
under such circumstances, the pronoun <HI>your</HI>
has not a seditious and even treasonable im∣port?
And whether the officer who should
make this declaration, and at the same time
throw away his sword at the head of the regi∣ment,
would not be condemned for mutiny
and desertion by any court-martial in Europe?
I am the rather disposed to judge favourably of
the conduct of the Roman government, as I
cannot discover any desire to take advantage
of the indiscretion of Marcellus. The Com∣mander
of the Legion seemed to lament that
it was not in his power to dissemble this rash
action. After a delay of more than three
months, the Centurion was examined before
the Vice-praefect, his superior Judge, who offer∣ed
him the fairest opportunities of explaining
or qualifying his seditious expressions, and at
last condemned him to lose his head; not sim∣ply
because he was a Christian, but because he
had violated his military oath, thrown away
his belt, and publicly blasphemed the Gods
and the Emperors. Perhaps the impartial
reader will confirm the sentence of the Vice-Praefect
Agricolanus, <Q REND="inline">Ita se habent facta
Marcelli, ut haec <HI>disciplinâ</HI> debeant vindi∣cari.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the plainest evidence, Dr.
Chelsum will not believe that either Origen in
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
Theory, or Marcellus in Practice, could seri∣ously
object to the use of arms; <Q REND="inline">because it is
well known, that far from declining the bu∣siness
of war altogether, whole legions of
Christians served in the Imperial armies<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 113.</NOTE>.</Q>
I have not yet discovered, in the Author or
Authors of the Remarks, many traces of a
clear and enlightened understanding, yet I can∣not
suppose them so destitute of every reasoning
principle, as to imagine that they here allude
to the conduct of the Christians who embraced
the profession of arms after their religion had
obtained a public establishment. Whole legi∣ons
of Christians served under the banners of
Constantine and Justinian, as whole regiments
of Christians are now inlisted in the service of
France or England. The representation which
I had given, was confined to the principles and
practice of the Church of which Origen and
Marcellus were members, before the sense of
public and private interest had reduced the
lofty standard of Evangelical perfection to the
ordinary level of human nature. In those pri∣mitive
times, where are the Christian legions
that served in the Imperial armies? Our Ec∣clesiastical
Pompeys may stamp with their foot,
but no armed men will arise out of the earth,
except the ghosts of the Thundering and the
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
Thebaean legions, the former renowned for a
Miracle, and the latter for a Martyrdom.
Either the two Protestant Doctors must acqui∣esce
under some imputations which are better
understood than expressed, or they must pre∣pare,
in the full light and freedom of the eigh∣teenth
century, to undertake the defence of
two obsolete legends, the least absurd of which
staggered the well-disciplined credulity of a
Franciscan Friar. (See Pagi Critic. ad Annal.
Baronii, A. D. 174. tom. i. p. 168.) Very
different was the spirit and taste of the learned
and ingenuous Dr. Jortin, who after treating
the silly story of the Thundering Legion with
the contempt it deserved, continues in the fol∣lowing
words: <Q REND="inline">Moyle wishes no greater
penance to the believers of the Thundering
Legion, than that they may also believe
the Martyrdom of the Thebaean Legion.</Q>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARAC∣TER AND CREDIT OF EUSE∣BIUS.</NOTE>
<P>A grave and pathetic complaint is introduced
by Dr. Chelsum, into his preface<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">P. ii, iii.</NOTE>, that Mr.
Gibbon, who has often referred to the Fathers
of the Church, seems to have entertained a ge∣neral
distrust of those respectable witnesses.
The Critic is scandalized at the epithets of
scanty and <HI>suspicious,</HI> which are applied to the
materials of Ecclesiastical History; and if he
cannot impeach the truth of the former, he
censures in the most angry terms the injustice
of the latter. He assumes, with peculiar
zeal, the defence of Eusebius, the venerable
parent of Ecclesiastical History, and labours to
rescue his character from the <HI>gross misrepresen∣tation,</HI>
on which Mr. Gibbon has openly in∣sisted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chelsum and Randolph, p. 220—238.</NOTE>. He observes, as if he sagaciously
foresaw the objection, <Q REND="inline">That it will not be
sufficient here to alledge a few instances of
apparent credulity in some of the Fathers,
in order to fix a general charge of <HI>suspicion</HI>
on all.</Q> But it <HI>may</HI> be sufficient to allege
a clear and fundamental principle of historical
as well as legal Criticism, that whenever we
are destitute of the means of comparing the
testimonies of the opposite parties, the evidence
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
of <HI>any</HI> witness, however illustrious by his rank
and titles, is justly to be <HI>suspected</HI> in his own
cause. It is unfortunate enough, that I should
be engaged with adversaries, whom their ha∣bits
of study and conversation appear to have
left in total ignorance of the principles which
universally regulate the opinions and practice
of mankind.</P>
<P>As the ancient world was not distracted by
the fierce conflicts of hostile sects, the free and
eloquent writers of Greece and Rome had
few opportunities of indulging their passions,
or of exercising their impartiality in the rela∣tion
of religious events. Since the origin of
Theological Factions, some Historians, Am∣mianus
Marcellinus, Fra-Paolo, Thuanus,
Hume, and perhaps a few others, have de∣served
the singular praise of holding the ba∣lance
with a steady and equal hand. Inde∣pendent
and unconnected, they contemplated
with the same indifference, the opinions and
interests of the contending parties; or, if they
were seriously attached to a particular system,
they were armed with a firm and moderate
temper, which enabled them to suppress their
affections, and to sacrifice their resentments.
In this small, but <HI>venerable</HI> Synod of Histo∣rians,
Eusebius cannot claim a seat. I had
acknowledged, and I still think, that his cha∣racter
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
was less tinctured with credulity than
that of most of his contemporaries; but as his
enemies must admit that he was sincere and
earnest in the profession of Christianity, so the
warmest of his admirers, or at least of his
readers, must discern, and will probably ap∣plaud,
the religious zeal which disgraces or
adorns every page of his Ecclesiastical History.
This laborious and useful work was published
at a time, between the defeat of Licinius and
the Council of Nice, when the resentment of
the Christians was still warm, and when the
Pagans were astonished and dismayed by the
recent victory and conversion of the great Con∣stantine.
The materials, I shall dare to repeat
the invidious epithets of scanty and suspicious,
were extracted from the accounts which the
Christians themselves had given of their <HI>own</HI>
sufferings, and of the cruelty of their enemies.
The Pagans had so long and so contemptuously
neglected the rising greatness of the Church,
that the Bishop of Caesarea had little either to
hope or to fear from the writers of the opposite
party; almost all of that <HI>little</HI> which did exist,
has been accidentally lost, or purposely de∣stroyed;
and the candid enquirer may vainly
wish to compare with the History of Eusebius,
some Heathen narrative of the persecutions of
Decius and Diocletian. Under these circum∣stances,
it is the duty of an impartial judge to
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
be counsel for the prisoner, who is incapabale of
making any defence for himself; and it is the
first office of a counsel to examine with distrust
and <HI>suspicion,</HI> the interested evidence of the ac∣cuser.
Reason justifies the suspicion, and it is
confirmed by the constant experience of modern
History, in almost every instance where we
have an opportunity of comparing the mutual
complaints and apologies of the religious fac∣tions,
who have disturbed each other's happi∣ness
in this world, for the sake of securing it
in the next.</P>
<P>As we are deprived of the means of contrast∣ing
the adverse relations of the Christians and
Pagans; it is the more incumbent on us to
improve the opportunities of trying the narra∣tives
of Eusebius, by the original, and some∣times
occasional testimonies of the more ancient
writers of his own party. Dr. Chelsum<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 653. Chelsum, p. 204—207.</NOTE> has
observed, that the celebrated passage of Ori∣gen,
which has so much thinned the ranks of
the army of Martyrs, must be confined to the
persecutions that had already happened. I
cannot dispute this sagacious remark, but I
shall venture to add, that this passage more
immediately relates to the religious tempests
which had been excited in the time and coun∣try
of Origen; and still more particularly to
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
the city of Alexandria, and to the persecution
of Severus, in which young Origen successfully
exhorted his father, to sacrifice his life and
fortune for the cause of Christ. From such
unquestionable evidence, I am authorised to
conclude, that the number of holy victims who
sealed their faith with their blood was not, on
this occasion, very considerable: but I cannot
reconcile this fair conclusion with the positive
declaration of Eusebius, (l. vi. c. 2. p. 258)
that at Alexandria, in the persecution of Seve∣rus,
an innumerable, at least an indefinite mul∣titude
(<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) of Christians were honoured with
the Crown of Martyrdom. The advocates for
Eusebius may exert their critical skill in prov∣ing
that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>many</HI> and <HI>few,</HI> are
synonymous and convertible terms, but they
will hardly succeed in diminishing so palpable
a contradiction, or in removing the suspicion
which deeply fixes itself on the historical cha∣racter
of the Bishop of Caesarea. This unfor∣tunate
experiment taught me to read, with
becoming caution, the loose and declamatory
style which <HI>seems</HI> to magnify the multitude of
Martyrs and Confessors, and to aggravate the
nature of their sufferings. From the same
motives I selected, with careful observation,
the more certain account of the number of
persons who actually suffered death in the pro∣vince
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
of Palestine, during the whole eight years
of the last and most rigorous persecution.</P>
<P>Besides the reasonable grounds of suspicion,
which suggest themselves to every liberal mind,
against the credibility of the Ecclesiastical
Historians, and of Eusebius, their venerable
leader, I had taken notice of two very remark∣able
passages of the Bishop of Caesarea. He
frankly, or at least indirectly, declares, that in
treating of the last persecution, <Q REND="inline">he has re∣lated
whatever might redound to the glory,
and suppressed all that could tend to the
disgrace, of Religion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 699.</NOTE>.</Q> Dr. Chelsum, who,
on this occasion, most lamentably exclaims
that we should hear Eusebius, before we utter∣ly
condemn him, has provided, with the assist∣ance
of his worthy colleague, an elaborate
defence for their common patron; and as if he
were secretly conscious of the weakness of the
cause, he has contrived the resource of in∣trenching
himself in a very muddy soil, behind
three several fortifications, which do not ex∣actly
support each other. The advocate for
the sincerity of Eusebius maintains: 1st, That
he never made such a declaration: 2dly, That
he had a right to make it: and, 3dly, That
he did not observe it. These separate and

almost inconsistent apologies, I shall separately
consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. Dr. Chelsum is at a loss how to recon∣cile,—
I beg pardon for weakening the force
of his dogmatic style; he declares that, <Q REND="inline">It is
plainly impossible to reconcile the express
words of the charge exhibited, with any
part of either of the passages appealed to in
support of it<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 232.</NOTE>.</Q> If he means, as I think
he must, that the <HI>express words</HI> of my text can∣not
be found in that of Eusebius, I congratu∣late
the importance of the discovery. But was
it possible? Could it be my design to quote the
words of Eusebius, when I reduced into one
sentence the spirit and substance of two diffuse
and distinct passages? If I have given the
true sense and meaning of the Ecclesiastical
Historian, I have discharged the duties of a
fair Interpreter; nor shall I refuse to rest the
proof of my fidelity on the translation of those
two passages of Eusebius, which Dr. Chelsum
produces in his favour<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">P. 228. 231.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">But it is not our
part to describe the sad calamities which at
last befel them (the <HI>Christians</HI>), since it does
not agree with our plan to relate their dis∣sentions
and wickedness before the persecu∣tion;
on which account we have determined
to relate nothing more concerning them than
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
may serve to justify the Divine Judgment.
We therefore have not been induced to
make mention either of those who were
tempted in the persecution, or of those who
made utter shipwreck of their salvation, and
who were sunk of their own accord in the
depths of the storm; but shall only add
those things to our General History, which
may in the first place be profitable to our∣selves,
and afterwards to posterity.</Q> In the
other passage, Eusebius, after mentioning the
dissentions of the Confessors among themselves,
again declares that it is his intention to pass
over all these things. <Q REND="inline">Whatsoever things,
(continues the Historian, in the words of
the Apostle, who was recommending the
practice of virtue) whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are of good re∣port,
if there be any virtue, and if there be
any praise; these things Eusebius thinks
most suitable to a History of Martyrs;</Q> of
<HI>wonderful</HI> Martyrs, is the splendid epithet which
Dr. Chelsum had not thought proper to trans∣late.
I should betray a very mean opinion of
the judgment and candour of my readers, if I
added a single reflection on the clear and ob∣vious
tendency of the two passages of the Ec∣clesiastical
Historian. I shall only observe,
that the Bishop of Caesarea seems to have claim∣ed
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
a privilege of a still more dangerous and
extensive nature. In one of the most learned
and elaborate works that antiquity has left us,
the Thirty-second Chapter of the Twelfth Book
of his Evangelical Preparation bears for its title
this scandalous Proposition, <Q REND="inline">How it may be
lawful and fitting to use falsehood as a me∣dicine,
and for the benefit of those who want
to be deceived.</Q> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
(p. 356, Edit. Graec. Rob. Ste∣phani,
Paris 1544.) In this chapter he al∣leges
a passage of Plato, which approves the
occasional practice of pious and salutary frauds;
nor is Eusebius ashamed to justify the senti∣ments
of the Athenian philosopher by the ex∣ample
of the sacred writers of the Old Testa∣ment.</P>
<P N="2">2. I had contented myself with observing,
that Eusebius had violated one of the funda∣mental
laws of history, <HI>Ne quid veri dicere non
audeat</HI>; nor could I imagine, if the <HI>fact</HI> was
allowed, that any question could possibly arise
upon the matter of <HI>right.</HI> I was indeed mis∣taken;
and I now begin to understand why I
have given so little satisfaction to Dr. Chelsum,
and to other critics of the same complexion, as
our ideas of the duties and the privileges of an
historian appear to be so widely different. It
<PB N="131" REF="141"/>
is alleged, that <Q REND="inline">every writer has a right to
chuse his subject, for the particular benefit
of his reader; that he has explained his own
plan consistently; that he considers himself,
according to it, not as a complete historian
of the times, but rather as a <HI>didactic</HI> writer,
whose main object is to make his work like
the Scriptures themselves, PROFITABLE FOR
DOCTRINE; that as he treats only of the af∣fairs
of the Church, the plan is at least ex∣cusable,
perhaps peculiarly proper; and that
he has conformed himself to the principal
duty of an historian, while, according to his
immediate design, he has not particularly
related any of the transactions which could
tend to the disgrace of religion<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 229, 230, 231.</NOTE>.</Q> The
historian must indeed be generous, who will
conceal, by his own disgrace, that of his coun∣try,
or of his religion. Whatever subject he
has chosen, whatever persons he introduces, he
owes to himself, to the present age, and to
posterity, a just and perfect delineation of all
that may be praised, of all that may be ex∣cused,
and of all that must be censured. If he
fails in the discharge of his important office, he
partially violates the sacred obligations of truth,
and disappoints his readers of the instruction
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
which they might have derived from a fair
parallel of the vices and virtues of the most il∣lustrious
characters. Herodotus might range
without controul in the spacious walks of the
Greek and Barbaric domain, and Thucydides
might confine his steps to the narrow path of
the Peloponnesian war; but those historians
would never have deserved the esteem of poste∣rity,
if they had designedly suppressed or tran∣siently
mentioned those facts which could tend
to the disgrace of Greece or of Athens. These
unalterable dictates of conscience and reason
have been <HI>seldom</HI> questioned, though they have
been seldom observed; and we must sincerely
join in the honest complaint of Melchior Ca∣nus,
<Q REND="inline">that the lives of the philosophers have
been composed by Laertius, and those of
the Caesars by Suetonius, with a much
stricter and more severe regard for historic
truth, than can be found in the lives of
saints and martyrs, as they are described by
Catholic writers.</Q> (See Loci Communes,
l. xi. p. 650, apud Clericum, Epistol. Critic. v.
p. 136.) And yet the partial representation of
truth is of far more pernicious consequence in
ecclesiastical than in civil history. If Laertius
had concealed the defects of Plato, or if Sue∣tonius
had disguised the vices of Augustus, we
should have been deprived of the knowledge
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
of some curious, and perhaps instructive facts,
and our idea of those celebrated men might
have been more favourable than they deserved;
but I cannot discover any practical inconve∣niencies
which could have been the result of
our ignorance. But if Eusebius had fairly and
circumstantially related the scandalous dissen∣tions
of the Confessors; if he had shewn that
their virtues were tinctured with pride and
obstinacy, and that their lively faith was not
exempt from some mixture of enthusiasm; he
would have armed his readers against the ex∣cessive
veneration for those holy men, which
imperceptibly degenerated into religious wor∣ship.
The success of these <HI>didactic</HI> histories,
by concealing or palliating every circumstance
of human infirmity, was one of the most effi∣cacious
means of consecrating the memory, the
bones, and the writings of the saints of the pre∣vailing
party; and a great part of the errors
and corruptions of the Church of Rome may
fairly be ascribed to this criminal dissimulation
of the ecclesiastical historians. As a Protestant
Divine, Dr. Chelsum must abhor these corrup∣tions;
but as a Christian, he should be careful
lest his apology for the prudent choice of Euse∣bius
should six an indirect censure on the un∣reserved
sincerity of the four Evangelists. In∣stead
of confining their narrative to those things
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
which are virtuous and of good report, instead of
following the plan which is here recommended
as <HI>peculiarly proper</HI> for the affairs of the Church,
the inspired writers have thought it their duty
to relate the most minute circumstances of the
fall of St. Peter, without considering whether
the behaviour of an Apostle, who thrice de∣nied
his Divine Master, might redound to the
honour or to the disgrace of Christianity. If
Dr. Chelsum should be frightened by this un∣expected
consequence, if he should be desirous
of saving his faith from <HI>utter shipwreck,</HI> by
throwing over-board the useless lumber of me∣mory
and reflection, I am not enough his ene∣my
to impede the success of his honest endea∣vours.</P>
<P>The didactic method of writing history is still
more profitably exercised by Eusebius in ano∣ther
work, which he has intitled, The Life of
Constantine, his gracious patron and benefac∣tor.
Priests and poets have enjoyed in every
age a privilege of flattery; but if the actions
of Constantine are compared with the perfect
idea of a royal saint, which, under his name,
has been delineated by the zeal and gratitude
of Eusebius, the most indulgent reader will
confess, that when I styled him a <HI>courtly Bi∣shop</HI><NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>, I could only be restrained by my respect
<PB N="135" REF="145"/>
for the episcopal character from the use of a
much harsher epithet. The other appellation
of a <HI>passionate declaimer,</HI> which seems to have
sounded still more offensive in the tender ears
of Dr. Chelsum<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 234.</NOTE>, was not applied by me to
Eusebius, but to Lactantius, or rather to the
author of the historical declamation, <HI>De mor∣tibus
persecutorum</HI>; and indeed it is much more
properly adapted to the Rhetorician, than to
the Bishop. Each of those authors was alike
studious of the glory of Constantine; but each
of them directed the torrent of his invectives
against the tyrant, whether Maxentius or Lici∣nus,
whose recent defeat was the actual theme
of popular and Christian applause. This simple
observation may serve to extinguish a very
trifling objection of my critic, That Eusebius
has not represented the tyrant Maxentius under
the character of a Persecutor.</P>
<P>Without scrutinizing the considerations of
interest which might support the integrity of
Baronius and Tillemont, I may fairly observe,
that both those learned Catholics have ac∣knowledged
and condemned the dissimulation
of Eusebius, which is partly denied, and partly
justified, by my adversary. The honourable
reflection of Baronius well deserves to be tran∣scribed.
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
<Q REND="inline">Haec (the passages already quoted)

Chelsum appeared to be more credulous than
a Monk: on the present occasion, he has shewn
himself less sincere than a Cardinal, and more
obstinate than a Jansenist.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet the advocate for Eusebius has still
another expedient in reserve. Perhaps he made
the unfortunate declaration of his partial de∣sign,
perhaps he had a right to make it; but
at least his accuser must admit, that he has
saved his honour by not keeping his word;
since I myself have taken notice of THE COR∣RUPTION
OF MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES among
the Christians, so FORCIBLY LAMENTED by Eu∣sebius<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Chelsum, p. 226, 227.</NOTE>. He has indeed indulged himself in a
strain of <HI>loose</HI> and <HI>indefinite</HI> censure, which may
generally be just, and which cannot be per∣sonally
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
offensive, which is alike incapable of
wounding or of correcting, as it seems to have
no fixed object or certain aim. Juvenal might
have read his satire against women in a circle
of Roman ladies, and each of them might have
listened with pleasure to the amusing descrip∣tion
of the various vices and follies, from
which she herself was so perfectly free. The
moralist, the preacher, the ecclesiastical histo∣rian,
enjoy a still more ample latitude of in∣vective;
and as long as they abstain from any
particular censure, they may securely expose,
and even exaggerate, the sins of the multitude.
The precepts of Christianity seem to inculcate
a style of mortification, of abasement, of self∣contempt;
and the hypocrite who aspires to
the reputation of a saint, often finds it conve∣nient
to affect the language of a penitent. I
should doubt whether Dr. Chelsum is much
acquainted with the comedies of Moliere. If
he has ever read that inimitable master of hu∣man
life, he may recollect whether Tartusse
was very much inclined to confess his real guilt,
when he exclaimed,
<Q><L>Oui, mon Frere, je suis un merchant, un coupable;</L>
<L>Un malheureux pécheur, tout plein d'iniquite;</L>
<L>Le plus grand scelerat qui ait jamais été.</L>

<L>Et j'en veux à genoux souffrir l'ignominie,</L>
<L>Comme une honte due aux crimes de ma vie:</L></Q></P>
<P>It is not my intention to compare the cha∣racter
of Tartuffe with that of Eusebius; the
former pointed his invectives against himself,
the latter directed them against the times in
which he had lived: but as the prudent Bishop
of Caesarea did not specify any place or person
for the object of his censure, he cannot justly
be accused, even by his friends, of violating
the <HI>profitable</HI> plan of his <HI>didactic</HI> history.</P>
<P>The extreme caution of Eusebius, who de∣clines
any mention of those who were tempted
and who fell during the persecution, has coun∣tenanced
a suspicion that he himself was one of
those unhappy victims, and that his tenderness
for the wounded fame of his brethren arose
from a just apprehension of his own disgrace.
In one of my notes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 699, N. 178.</NOTE>, I had observed, that he
was charged with the guilt of some criminal
compliances, in his own presence, and in the
Council of Tyre. I am therefore accountable
for the reality only, and not for the truth, of
the accusation: but as the two Doctors, who
<PB N="139" REF="149"/>
on this occasion unite their forces, are angry
and clamorous in asserting the innocence of the
Ecclesiastical Historian<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Chelsum and Randolph, p. 236, 237, 238.</NOTE>, I shall advance one
step farther, and shall maintain, that the charge
against Eusebius, though not legally proved,
is supported by a reasonable share of pre∣sumptive
evidence.</P>
<P>I have often wondered why our orthodox
Divines should be so earnest and zealous in the
defence of Eusebius; whose moral character
cannot be preserved, unless by the sacrifice of
a more illustrious, and, as I really believe, of
a more innocent victim. Either the Bishop of
Caesarea, on a very important occasion, vio∣lated
the laws of Christian charity and civil
justice, or we must fix a charge of calumny,
almost of forgery, on the head of the great
Athanasius, the standard-bearer of the Ho∣moousian
cause, and the firmest pillar of the
orthodox doctrine. In the Council of Tyre,
he was accused of murdering, or at least of
mutilating, a Bishop, whom he produced at
Tyre alive and unhurt (Athanas. tom. i.
p. 783. 786.); and of sacrilegiously breaking
a consecrated chalice, in a village where nei∣ther
church, nor altar, nor chalice, could pos∣sibly
have existed. (Athanas. tom. i. p. 731,
<PB N="140" REF="150"/>
732. 802.) Notwithstanding the clearest proofs
of his innocence, Athanasius was oppressed by
the Arian faction; and Eusebius of Caesarea,
the venerable father of ecclesiastical history,
conducted this iniquitous prosecution from a
motive of personal enmity. (Athanas. tom. i.
p. 728. 795. 797.) Four years afterwards, a
national council of the Bishops of Egypt, forty-nine
of whom had been present at the Synod of
Tyre, addressed an epistle or manifesto in fa∣vour
of Athanasius to all the Bishops of the
Christian world. In this epistle they assert,
that some of the Confessors, who accompanied
them to Tyre, had accused Eusebius of Caesa∣rea
of an act relative to idolatrous sacrifice.
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Atha∣nas.
tom. i. p. 728.) Besides this short and
authentic memorial, which escaped the know∣ledge
or the candour of our confederate Doc∣tors,
a consonant but more circumstantial nar∣rative
of the accusation of Eusebius may be
found in the writings of Epiphanius (Haeres.
lxviii. p. 723, 724.), the learned Bishop of
Salamis, who was born about the time of the
Synod of Tyre. He relates, that, in one of the
sessions of the Council, Potamon, Bishop of
Heracica in Egypt, addressed Eusebius in the
following words: <Q REND="inline">How now, Eusebius, can
<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
this be borne, that you should be seated as
a judge, while the innocent Athanasius
is left standing as a criminal? Tell me,
continued Potamon, were we not in prison
together during the persecution? For my
own part, I lost an eye for the sake of the
truth; but I cannot discern that <HI>you</HI> have
lost any one of your members. You bear
not any marks of your sufferings for Jesus
Christ; but here you are, full of life, and
with all the parts of your body sound and
entire. How could you contrive to escape
from prison, unless you stained your con∣science,
either by actual guilt or by a cri∣minal
promise to our persecutors.</Q> Euse∣bius
immediately broke up the meeting, and
discovered by his anger, that he was confound∣ed
or provoked by the reproaches of the Con∣fessor
Potamon.</P>
<P>I should despise myself, if I were capable of
magnifying, for a present occasion, the autho∣rity
of the witness whom I have produced. Po∣tamon
was most assuredly actuated by a strong
prejudice against the personal enemy of his Pri∣mate;
and if the transaction to which he al∣luded
had been of a private and doubtful kind,
I would not take any ungenerous advantage
of the respect which my Reverend Adversaries
must entertain for the character of a Confessor.
<PB N="142" REF="152"/>
But I cannot distrust the veracity of Potamon,
when he confined himself to the assertion of a
fact, which lay within the compass of his per∣sonal
knowledge: and collateral testimony (see
Photius, p. 296, 297.) attests, that Eusebius
was long enough in prison to assist his friend,
the Martyr Pamphilus, in composing the first
five books of his Apology for Origen. If we
admit that Eusebius was imprisoned, he must
have been discharged, and his discharge must
have been either honourable, or criminal, or
innocent. If his patience vanquished the cruelty
of the Tyrant's Ministers, a short relation of his
own confession and sufferings would have formed
an useful and edifying Chapter in his Didactic
History of the Persecution of Palestine; and
the Reader would have been satisfied of the
veracity of an Historian who valued truth above
his life. If it had been in his power to justify,
or even to excuse, the manner of his discharge
from prison, it was his interest, it was his duty,
to prevent the doubts and suspicions which
must arise from his silence under these delicate
circumstances. Notwithstanding these urgent
reasons, Eusebius has observed a profound, and
perhaps a prudent, silence: though he fre∣quently
celebrates the merit and martyrdom
of his friend Pamphilus (p. 371. 394. 419. 427.
Edit. Cantab.), he never insinuates that he was
<PB N="143" REF="153"/>
his companion in prison; and while he copi∣ously
describes the eight years persecution in
Palestine, he never represents himself in any
other light than of a spectator. Such a con∣duct
in a Writer, who relates with a visible sa∣tisfaction
the honourable events of his own life,
if it be not absolutely considered as an evi∣dence
of conscious guilt, must excite, and may
justify, the suspicions of the most candid Critic.</P>
<P>Yet the firmness of Dr. Randolph is not
shaken by these rational suspicions; and he
condescends, in a magisterial tone, to inform
me, <Q REND="inline">That it is highly improbable, from the
general well-known decision of the Church
in such cases, that had his apostacy been
known, he would have risen to those high
honours which he attained, or been admitted
at all indeed to any other than lay-com∣munion.</Q>
This weighty objection did not
surprize me, as I had already seen the substance
of it in the Prolegomena of Valesius; but I
safely disregarded a difficulty which had not
appeared of any moment to the national coun∣cil
of Egypt; and I still think that an hundred
Bishops, with Athanasius at their head, were
as competent judges of the discipline of the
fourth Century, as even the Lady Margaret's
Professor of Divinity in the University of Ox∣ford.
As a work of supererogation, I have
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
consulted, however, the Antiquities of Bing∣ham
(see l. iv. c. 3. s. 6, 7. vol. i. p. 144, &amp;c.
fol. Edit.), and found, as I expected, that
much real learning had made him cautious and
modest. After a careful examination of the
facts and authorities already known to me, and
of those with which I was supplied by the di∣ligent
Antiquarian, I am persuaded that the
theory and the practice of discipline were not
invariably the same, that particular examples
cannot always be reconciled with general
rules, and that the stern laws of justice often
yielded to motives of policy and convenience.
The temper of Jerom towards those whom he
considered as Heretics was fierce and unfor∣giving;
yet the Dialogue of Jerom against the
Luciferians, which I have read with infinite
pleasure (tom. ii. p. 135—147. Edit. Basil.
1536.), is the seasonable and dextrous per∣formance
of a Statesman, who felt the expe∣diency
of soothing and reconciling a numerous
party of offenders. The most rigid discipline,
with regard to the Ecclesiastics who had fallen
in time of persecution, is expressed in the 10th
Canon of the Council of Nice; the most re∣markable
indulgence was shewn by the Fathers
of the same Council to the <HI>lapsed,</HI> the degraded,
the schismatic Bishops of Lycopolis. Of the
penitent sinners, some might escape the shame
<PB N="145" REF="155"/>
of a public conviction or confession, and others
might be exempted from the rigour of cle∣rical
punishment. If Eusebius incurred the
guilt of a sacrilegious promise (for we are free
to accept the milder alternative of Potamon),
the proofs of this criminal transaction might
be suppressed by the influence of money or fa∣vour;
a seasonable journey into Egypt might
allow time for the popular rumours to subside.
The crime of Eusebius might be protected by
the impunity of many Episcopal Apostates
(see Philostorg. l. ii. c. 15. p. 21. Edit. Go∣thofred.);
and the Governors of the Church
very reasonably desired to retain in their ser∣vice
the most learned Christian of the Age.</P>
</DIV2>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>It is not without some mixture of mortifi∣cation
and regret, that I now look back on
the number of hours which I have consumed,
and the number of pages which I have filled,
in vindicating my literary and moral character
from the charge of wilful <HI>Misrepresentations,</HI>
gross <HI>Errors,</HI> and servile <HI>Plagiarisms.</HI> I cannot
derive any triumph or consolation from the oc∣casional
advantages which I may have gained
over three adversaries, whom it is impossible
for me to consider as objects either of terror
or of esteem. The spirit of resentment, and
every other lively sensation, have long since
been extinguished; and the pen would long
<PB N="146" REF="156"/>
since have dropped from my weary hand, had
I not been supported in the execution of this
ungrateful task, by the consciousness, or at
least by the opinion, that I was discharging a
debt of honour to the Public and to myself.
I am impatient to dismiss, and to dismiss FOR
EVER, this odious controversy, with the suc∣cess
of which I cannot surely be elated; and
I have only to request, that as soon as my
Readers are convinced of my innocence, they
would forget my vindication.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the sheets of this Vindication
were in the press, I was informed that
an anonymous pamphlet, under the title of <HI>A
Few Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. had been published against
my History in the course of the last summer.
The unknown writer has thought proper to di∣stinguish
himself by the emphatic, yet vague,
appellation of A GENTLEMAN: but I must la∣ment
that he has not considered, with becoming
attention, the duties of that respectable charac∣ter.
I am ignorant of the motives which can
urge a man of a liberal mind, and liberal man∣ners,
to attack without provocation, and with∣out
tenderness, any work which may have con∣tributed
to the information, or even to the
amusement of the public. But I am well con∣vinced,
that the author of such a work, who
boldly gives his name and his labours to the
world, imposes on his adversaries the fair and
honourable obligation of encountering him in
open day-light, and of supporting the weight
of their assertions by the credit of their names.
<PB N="148" REF="158"/>
The effusions of wit, or the productions of rea∣son,
may be accepted from a secret and un∣known
hand. The critic who attempts to
injure the reputation of another, by strong im∣putations
which may possibly be false, should
renounce the ungenerous hope of concealing
behind a mask the vexation of disappointment,
and the guilty blush of detection.</P>
<P>After this remark, which I cannot make
without some degree of concern, I shall frankly
declare, that it is not my wish or my inten∣tion
to prosecute with this <HI>Gentleman</HI> a lite∣rary
altercation. There lies between us a
broad and unfathomable gulph; and the heavy
mist of prejudice and superstition, which has in
a great measure been dispelled by the free in∣quiries
of the present age, still continues to in∣volve
the mind of my Adversary. He fondly
embraces those phantoms (for instance, an ima∣ginary
Pilate<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 100.</NOTE>), which can scarcely find a
shelter in the gloom of an Italian convent; and
the resentment which he points against me,
might frequently be extended to the most en∣lightened
of the PROTESTANT, or, in his opi∣nion,
of the HERETICAL critics. His observa∣tions
are divided into a number of unconnected
paragraphs, each of which contains some quo∣tation
from my History, and the angry, yet
commonly trifling expression of his disapproba∣tion
<PB N="149" REF="159"/>
and displeasure. Those sentiments I can∣not
hope to remove; and as the religious opi∣nions
of this <HI>Gentleman</HI> are principally founded
on the infallibility of the Church<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Remarks p. 15.</NOTE>, they are
not calculated to make a very deep impression
on the mind of an English reader. The view of
<HI>facts</HI> will be materially affected by the conta∣gious
influence of <HI>doctrines.</HI> The man who re∣fuses
to judge of the conduct of Lewis XIV.
and Charles V. towards their Protestant sub∣jects<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 111.</NOTE>, declares himself incapable of distin∣guishing
the limits of persecution and tolera∣tion.
The devout Papist, who has implored
on his knees the intercession of St. Cyprian,
will seldom presume to examine the actions of
the Saint by the rules of historical evidence and
of moral propriety. Instead of the homely
likeness which I had exhibited of the Bishop of
Carthage, my Adversary has substituted a life
of Cyprian<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 72—88.</NOTE>, full of what the French call
<HI>onction,</HI> and the English, <HI>canting</HI> (See Jortin's
Remarks, Vol. ii. p. 239.): to which I can
only reply, that those who are dissatisfied with
the principles of Mosheim and Le Clerc, <HI>must</HI>
view with eyes very different from mine, the
Ecclesiastical History of the third century.</P>
<P>It would be an <HI>endless</HI> discussion (<HI>endless</HI> in
every sense of the word), were I to examine the
cavils which start up and expire in every page
<PB N="150" REF="160"/>
of this criticism, on the inexhaustible topic of
opinions, characters, and intentions. Most of
the instances which are here produced, are of
so brittle a substance that they fall in pieces as
soon as they are touched: and I searched for
some time before I was able to discover an ex∣ample
of some moment where the <HI>Gentleman</HI>
had fairly staked his veracity against some po∣sitive
fact asserted in the two last Chapters of
my History. At last I perceived that he has
absolutely denied<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 90, 91.</NOTE> that any thing can be ga∣thered
from the Epistles of St. Cyprian, or from
his treatise <HI>De Unitate Ecclesiae,</HI> to which I had
referred, to justify my account of the spiritual
pride and licentious manners of some of the
Confessors<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 661, Note 91.</NOTE>. As the <HI>numbers</HI> of the Epistles
are not the same in the edition of Pamelius and
in that of Fell, the Critic may be excused for
mistaking my quotations, if he will acknow∣ledge
that he was ignorant of ecclesiastical
history, and that he never heard of the troubles
excited by the spiritual pride of the Confessors,
who usurped the privilege of giving letters of
communion to penitent sinners. But my re∣ference
to the treatise <HI>De Unitate Ecclesiae</HI> was
clear and direct; the treatise itself contains
only ten pages, and the following words might
be distinctly read by any person who under∣stood
the Latin language. "Nec quisquam
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
miretur, dilectissimi fratres, etiam de confesso∣ribus
quosdam ad ista procedere, inde quoque
aliquos tam nefanda tam gravia peccare. Ne∣que
enim confessio immunem facit ab insidiis
diaboli; aut contra tentationes, et pericula, et
incursus atque impetus seculares adhuc in se∣culo
positum perpetuâ securitate defendit: ce∣terum
nunquam in confessoribus, <HI>fraudes,</HI> et
<HI>stupra,</HI> et <HI>adulteria</HI> postmodum videremus, quae
nunc in quibusdam videntes ingemiscimus et
dolemus." This formal declaration of Cyprian,
which is followed by several long periods of
admonition and censure, is alone sufficient to
expose the scandalous vices of some of the Con∣fessors,
and the disingenuous behaviour of my
concealed adversary.</P>
<P>After this example, which I have fairly
chosen as one of the most specious and import∣ant
of his objections, the candid Reader would
excuse me, if from this moment I declined <HI>the
Gentleman</HI>'s acquaintance. But as two topics
have occurred, which are intimately connected
with the subject of the preceding sheets, I shall
insert them in this place, and desire that they
may be read as the conclusion of the fourth
article of my answers to Mr. Davis, and of the
first article of my reply to the confederate Doc∣tors,
Chelsum and Randolph.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<PB N="152" REF="162"/>
<HEAD>PAGE 29.</HEAD>
<P>I stand accused, though not indeed by Mr.
Davis, for profanely depreciating the <HI>promised</HI>
Land, as well as the <HI>chosen</HI> People. The Gentle∣man
without a name has placed this charge
in the front of his battle<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 1.</NOTE>, and if my memory
does not deceive me, it is one of the few re∣marks
in Mr. Apthorpe's book, which have
any immediate relation to my History. They
seem to consider as a reproach, and as an un∣just
reproach, the idea which I had given of
Palestine, as of a territory scarcely superior to
Wales in extent and fertility<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 30.</NOTE>; and they
strangely convert a geographical observation
into a theological error. When I recollect
that the imputation of a similar error was em∣ployed
by the implacable Calvin, to precipi∣tate
and to justify the execution of Servetus,
I must applaud the felicity of this country, and
of this age, which has disarmed, if it could
not mollify, the fierceness of ecclesiastical cri∣ticism
(see Dictionnaire Critique de Chauffepié,
tom. iv. p. 223).</P>
<P>As I had compared the narrow extent of
Phoenicia and Palestine with the important bles∣fings
which those celebrated countries had dif∣fused
over the rest of the earth, their minute size
<PB N="153" REF="163"/>
became an object not of censure but of praise.
<Q>Ingentes animos angusto in pectore versant.</Q>
The precise measure of Palestine was taken
from Templeman's Survey of the Globe: he
allows to Wales 7011 square English miles, to
the Morea, or Peloponnesus, 7220, to the Se∣ven
United Provinces 7546, and to Judaea or
Palestine 7600. The difference is not very
considerable, and if any of these countries has
been magnified beyond its real size, Asia is
more liable than Europe to have been affected
by the inaccuracy of Mr. Templeman's maps.
To the authority of this modern survey, I shall
only add the ancient and weighty testimony of
Jerom, who passed in Palestine above thirty
years of his life. From Dan to Bershebah, the
two fixed and proverbial boundaries of the Holy
Land, he reckons no more than one hundred
and sixty miles (Hieronym. ad Dardanum,
tom. iii. p. 66), and the breadth of Palestine
cannot by any expedient be stretched to one
half of its length (see Reland, Palestin. l. ii.
c. 5. p. 421).</P>
<P>The degrees and limits of fertility cannot
be ascertained with the strict simplicity of geo∣graphical
measures. Whenever we speak of
the productions of the earth in different cli∣mates,
our ideas must be relative, our expres∣sions
vague and doubtful; nor can we always
<PB N="154" REF="164"/>
distinguish between the gifts of Nature and
the rewards of Industry. The Emperor Fre∣derick
II. the enemy and the victim of the
Clergy, is accused of saying, after his return
from his Crusade, that the God of the Jews
would have despised his promised land, if he
had once seen the fruitful realms of Sicily
and Naples (see Giannone Istoria Civile del
Regno di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 245). This raillery,
which malice has perhaps falsely imputed to
Frederick, is inconsistent with truth and piety;
yet it must be confessed, that the soil of Pale∣stine
does not contain that inexhaustible, and
as it were spontaneous principle of secundity
which under the most unfavourable circum∣stance
has covered with rich harvests the banks
of the Nile, the fields of Sicily, or the plains
of Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable
river of Palestine: a considerable part of the
narrow space is occupied, or rather lost, in the
<HI>Dead Sea,</HI> whose horrid aspect inspires every
sensation of disgust, and countenances every
tale of horror. The districts which border on
Arabia partake of the sandy quality of the ad∣jacent
desert. The face of the country, except
the sea-coast and the valley of the Jordan, is
covered with mountains, which appear for the
most part as naked and barren rocks; and in
the neighbourhood of Jerusalem there is a real
<PB N="155" REF="165"/>
scarcity of the two elements of earth and wa∣ter
(see Maundrel's Travels, p. 65, and Re∣land
Palestin. tom. i. p. 238—395). These
disadvantages, which now operate in their
fullest extent, were formerly corrected by the
labours of a numerous people, and the active
protection of a wise government. The hills
were cloathed with rich beds of artificial mould,
the rain was collected in vast cisterns, a sup∣ply
of fresh water was conveyed by pipes and
aqueducts to the dry lands, the breed of cattle
was encouraged in those parts which were not
adapted for tillage, and almost every spot was
compelled to yield some production for the use
of the inhabitants. (See the same testimonies
and observations of Maundrel and Reland).<Q><L>—Pater ipse colendi</L>
<L>Haud facilem esse viam voluit, primusque per artem</L>
<L>Movit agros; curis acuens mortalia corda</L>
<L>Nec torpere gravi passus SUA REGNA veterno.</L></Q> Such are the useful victories which have been
atchieved by MAN on the lofty mountains of
Switzerland, along the rocky coast of Genoa,
and upon the barren hills of Palestine; and
since Wales has flourished under the influence
of English freedom, that rugged country has
surely acquired some share of the same indus∣trious
merit and the same artificial fertility.
<PB N="156" REF="166"/>
Those Critics who interpret the comparison of
Palestine and Wales as a tacit libel on the for∣mer,
are themselves guilty of an unjust satire
against the latter of those countries. Such is
the injustice of Mr. Apthorpe and of the ano∣nymous
<HI>Gentleman:</HI> but if Mr. Davis (as we
may suspect from his name) is himself of Cam∣brian
origin, his patriotism on this occasion
has protected me from his zeal.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>PAGE 121.</HEAD>
<P>Yet I shall not attempt to conceal a formi∣dable
army of Christians and even of Martyrs,
which is ready to inlist under the banners of the
confederate Doctors, if they will accept their
service. As a specimen of the extravagant
legends of the middle age, I had produced the
instance of ten thousand Christian soldiers sup∣posed
to have been crucified on Mount Ararat,
by the order either of Trajan or Hadrian<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 654. note 74.</NOTE>.
For the mention and for the confutation of this
story, I had appealed to a Papist and a Pro∣testant,
to the learned Tillemont (Mem. Ec∣clesiast.
tom. ii. part ii. p. 438), and to the
diligent Geddes (Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 203),
and when Tillemont was not afraid to say that
there are few histories which appear more fa∣bulous,
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
I was not ashamed of dismissing the <HI>Fa∣ble</HI>
with silent contempt. We may trace the de∣grees
of fiction as well as those of credibility, and
the impartial Critic will not place on the same
level the baptism of Philip and the donation of
Constantine. But in considering the crucifix∣ion
of the ten thousand Christian soldiers, we
are not reduced to the necessity of weighing
any internal probabilities, or of disproving any
external testimonies. This legend, the ab∣surdity
of which must strike every <HI>rational</HI> mind,
stands naked and unsupported by the authority
of any writer who lived within a thousand years
of the age of Trajan, and has not been able to
obtain the poor sanction of the uncorrupted
Martyrologies which were framed in the most
credulous period of Ecclesiastical History.
The two Protestant Doctors will probably re∣ject
the unsubstantial present which has been
offered them; yet there is one of my adversa∣ries,
the <HI>annonymous Gentleman,</HI> who boldly de∣clares
himself the votary of the ten thousand
Martyrs, and challenges me <Q REND="inline">to discredit a
FACT which hitherto by many has been
looked upon as well established<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 65, 66, 67.</NOTE>.</Q> It is
pity that a prudent confessor did not whisper
in his ear, that, although the martyrdom of
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
these military Saints, like that of the eleven
thousand Virgins, may contribute to the edifi∣cation
of the faithful, these wonderful tales
should not be rashly exposed to the jealous
and inquisitive eye of those profane Critics,
whose examination always precedes, and some∣times
checks, their Religious Assent.</P>
