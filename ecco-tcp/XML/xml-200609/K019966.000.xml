<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I presumed to write to
my countrymen last year, to
rouse their spirit against Mr. <HI>Fox's
East-India bill,</HI> I had the happiness
to find my letter received not only
with indulgence, but with a generous
warmth of heart which I can never
forget, but to the latest moment of
my life shall most gratefully remem∣ber.
The fire of loyalty was kindled.
It flew through our counties and our
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
boroughs. The King was addressed:
the constitution was saved. I was
proud to have been able thus <HI>ciere
viros;</HI> prouder still than of receiving
the applause of the <HI>minister of the</HI>
CROWN, which he was pleased to con∣vey
to me in a very handsome letter;
upon which, however, I set a high
value, considering not only the mi∣nister,
but the man; and accordingly
it shall be preserved in the archives
of my family.</P>
<P>I now feel myself called upon to
to write to them again, upon a sub∣ject
of less magnitude indeed, but of
most interesting concern. The crown
is not in danger every day: GOD for∣bid
it should.</P>
<Q><L>As if Misfortune made the throne her seat,</L>
<L>And none could be unhappy but the great.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
But what is the crown without sub∣jects?
and what are subjects without
a good administration of justice? A
rage for <HI>innovation</HI> has gone forth;
and that rage, seconded by avarice
and inordinate love of power, in diffe∣rent
parties, according to their dif∣ferent
interests, hath lately threatened,
and still threatens, us with a violent
shock to our civil judicature, by re∣ducing
the number of the lords of
session from fifteen to ten, that ten
may have larger salaries. This "comes
home to our business and bosoms." It
is a very serious alarm indeed. As to
the barons of Exchequer, I shall say
nothing: It is but a modern court;
and we are told a person of high of∣fice
in the law said, they were not so
much judges as revenue officers.
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
But the <HI>Court of Session</HI> has a vast juris∣diction.
It was formed by James V.
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1532, after the mo∣del
of the <HI>Parliament of Paris.</HI> It
consisted originally of seven church∣men,
seven laymen, and a prelate as
president. This was altered. They
are now all laymen; and none can
be appointed but who have been five
years advocates or principal clerks of
court, or ten years clerks to his ma∣jesty's
signet; but advocates are almost
always appointed. Their gowns are
of purple cloth and crimson velvet,
very gracefully disposed, and they still
retain the sacerdotal badge of a cawl
or pouch, which hangs on their
shoulders, as a part of the gown, like
that of the capuchins. Its jurisdic∣tion
is not only supreme, in Scotland,
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
over all causes civil and consistorial,
(that is to say, causes of the nature of
the ecclesiastical causes in England,
with this amazing difference, that
they have a power to give a sentence
of divorce equivalent to an act of
parliament) but has also a consider∣able
extent in criminal cases. And
let me add, that it has acquired a
kind of undefined arbitrary jurisdic∣tion,
called its <HI>nobile officium,</HI> for a
full and bold account of which I re∣fer
you to Dr. <HI>Gilbert Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but complain of the secret
and sudden mode of framing and
bringing forward this momentous
bill.—What! shall the supreme civil
court of a country be diminished one
third?—Shall an establishment, sanc∣tified
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
by the acquiescence of ages, be
pulled to pieces without any commu∣nication
whatever with the subjects of
that country, high or low; nay,
without ever consulting the bar, the
<HI>faculty</HI> of <HI>advocates,</HI> that learned body
who are guardians of the law—<HI>antis∣tites
justitiae.</HI> But <HI>scandal</HI> says, Mr.
<HI>Henry Dundas</HI> has been applied to
by some of the judges, who, after
feasting at <HI>Bayll's</HI> French tavern, and
raising their spirits high with wine,
have formed the lofty wish of reve∣rently
paying their court to <HI>Regina
Pecunia;</HI>—and Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas</HI>
(sometimes called <HI>Harry the Ninth</HI>)
very willing to oblige those senators,
and make them his devoted humble
servants, has nodded assent. <HI>Egre∣giam
sane loudem, et spolia ampla re∣fertis.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
But Mr. Dundas, not being
<HI>sure</HI> that the people of Scotland are
yet <HI>entirely tame,</HI> has been too wise
to commit <HI>himself</HI> in this desperate
business, but has only given instruc∣tions;
and then Mr. <HI>Ilay Campbell,</HI>
the present lord advocate of Scotland,
whom his brethren did the honour to
elect their vice dean, rises in the house
of commons with this same pretty
little bill, cut and dry, and thinks
he may at once kill his five men, and
in triumph call out, "Off with their
heads!"—So much for <HI>Lords of
Session.</HI> But let him beware! he will
find them "rise with gashes on their
crowns, to push him, and others too,
perhaps, from their stools." Like the
vision in Mr. <HI>Glover's</HI> celebrated bal∣lad
of <HI>Hosier's Ghost,</HI> "A sad troop
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
will appear, all shrowded in dreary
robes, as winding sheets, and frown∣ing
on a hostile band."</P>
<P>But indeed, indeed, our country is
at a miserable ebb, when its great and
good families are totally indifferent
about every public concern, and have
so little spirit, even as to their private
concerns, that they never advance,
like men, to the fountain head of go∣vernment,
but indolently or timidly
suffer all to be done by some person or
other who for the time is brought for∣ward,
or who puts himself forward,
as a <HI>minister for Scotland.</HI> They are
afraid to let their <HI>natural voice</HI> be
heard by administration, but must
convey their wishes through a speak∣ing
trumpet, which, I will tell them,
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
may be pointed high or low, as he
who holds it may think proper. But
if the Stuarts, the Hamiltons, the
Erskines, the Craufurds, the Mont∣gomeries,
the Douglases, the Grahams,
the Somervilles, the Cathcarts, the
Kennedies, in short, all the men of
blood and of property, who ought to
be men of consequence, hang back,
are we to be surprized that admini∣stration
appoints a <HI>locum tenens,</HI> an
agent, or by whatever name he may
be called; or that some able and ar∣dent
politician takes their place. I
remember <HI>Archibald</HI> duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>
—I remember <HI>Stuart Mackenzie</HI>—I
remember <HI>Gilmour,</HI> all in their turn,
<HI>bowed</HI> to, and bringing the people
of Scotland to St. James's and the
Treasury, as a salesman drives black
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
cattle to Smithfield. Poor dumb
beasts! why should they not walk up
themselves, and bellow as they may
incline?</P>
<Q><L>I'll bellow out for Rome, and for my country,</L>
<L>And mouth at Caesar till I shake the Senate.</L></Q>
<P>Then came Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas,</HI>
who has made a distinguished figure
at more markets than one—whether
at <HI>Oxford</HI> market with Lord <HI>North,</HI>
or <HI>Leadenhall</HI> market with Mr. <HI>Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>There was a time when we were
flattered there was to be no monopoly
—when that TITUS, that <HI>Deliciae hu∣mani
generis,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Portland</HI>
(I give his Grace as Mr. Burke gave
him me, not having the good fortune
to be known to him) when <HI>He</HI> pre∣sided.
—O, then! all was to go well
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
with Scotland!—There was to be no
go-between—nobody to keep back
the individuals of that distant part of
the island from fairly asserting their
pretensions, whether from birth,
wealth, or merit. But, alas! we soon
found there was only a <HI>change of
Dundases.</HI> Instead of Mr. <HI>Henry
Dundas,</HI> we got Sir <HI>Thomas Dundas;</HI>
and now we have Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas</HI>
again.</P>
<P>Mr. Dundas is of a great law race.
The family of <HI>Arniston</HI> has for four
successive generations been judges in
our supreme civil court, and for these
two last been at the head of it as
President.—A very extraordinary in∣stance,
in modern times, where it can
be said, <HI>per fasces numerat avos.</HI>
Why then, O why! Mr. Dundas,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
should <HI>you</HI> attempt to injure this an∣cient
institution? Are you not afraid
that the shades of your ancestors may
disturb your pillow? "Be not too
bold," I intreat you! There are
some things which we will bear, and
some things which we will <HI>not</HI> bear.
Think, O think of
<Q>"Vaulting Ambition, which o'erleaps itself!"</Q>
Besides, Sir, you are the Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates. We have placed
you in the chair where LOCKHART
sat: we expect you will not betray
us.</P>
<P>But, that I may now speak to my
countrymen in plain, and, I flatter
myself, convincing argument, let us
consider the peculiar form and con∣stitution
of the Court of Session. It
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
will hardly be believed, in <HI>England,</HI>
that we have no juries in civil causes;
still more strange will it seem, that
we once had that inestimable privi∣lege,
and lost it—nobody can tell how.
But Lord <HI>Kames</HI> has proved it.—That
a country should, in the progress of
civilization in every other respect, be∣come
more barbarous in its executive
jurisprudence, is a wonderful and a
disgraceful phaenomenon. Nay, we
have no grand jury in Scotland. There
is no such thing as finding a bill by
the country: all criminal prosecutions
are by <HI>information</HI> of the first crown
lawyer, or by immediate indictment
at the suit of private persons, with his
concurrence; so that there is neither
the security against unjust prosecutions
which the verdict of our peers would
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
afford, nor is there a certainty that
crimes which <HI>ought</HI> to be prosecuted
<HI>will</HI> be prosecuted. All is left to the
will and pleasure of <HI>His Majesty's Ad∣vocate,</HI>
the Attorney-General of Scot∣land,
that anomalous personage whose
<HI>status</HI> puzzles the House of Commons;
who is a <HI>lord,</HI> but yet not <HI>noble,</HI> and
to-morrow may descend to be only
the honourable, or ascend to be the
right honourable, <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state,</L>
<L>A being darkly wise, and rudely great.</L></Q>
<P>The Lord Advocate of Scotland
has the whole power of a grand jury
in his person. The fat Mr. <HI>Edward
Bright,</HI> of Malden, whose print is in
all our inns to amuse the weary tra∣veller,
is nothing to the <HI>learned lord.</HI>
—<HI>He</HI> could button seven men in his
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
waistcoat; but the learned lord com∣prehends
hundreds: the grand juries
of thirty counties are packed within
his little circumference.</P>
<P>The Court of Session then is not
only a body of <HI>judges,</HI> but, like the
Parliament of Paris, it is a standing
<HI>jury</HI> for all Scotland. And will it
be seriously maintained, that <HI>fifteen</HI> is
too large a number, when that is con∣sidered?
My amiable and honourable
friend <HI>Dempster,</HI> that <HI>rara avis</HI> of
the Scottish breed, who has sat in
parliament almost as long as our pre∣sent
most gracious Sovereign has sat
upon the throne, and has shewn him∣self
uniformly independent, uniformly
benevolent, when I talked to him
upon this subject, exclaimed, <Q>Fif∣teen
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
too few! I would rather have
fifty. They talk of there being
only twelve judges in England: I
say there are twenty thousand—the
juries—by whom almost every
thing is decided; and our fifteen
Lords of Session are all we have
for a jury in civil causes.</Q>—Nobly
said! There <HI>are</HI> twenty thousand
judges in England—<HI>judges of law as
well as of fact</HI>—and I hope in GOD
there ever shall be, notwithstanding
all that the old Conjuror or any of
his pupils can do. While a <HI>Loft</HI> and
a <HI>Towers</HI> can write, and a <HI>Lee</HI> and
an <HI>Erskine</HI> plead, that sacred palla∣dium
will be preserved.</P>
<P>If the British Parliament will give
us a grand jury, and juries in civil
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
causes (for both of which, if I am
ever thought worthy of being sent
into the House of Commons as an
independent gentleman, I shall cer∣tainly
move for leave to bring in a
bill) I will answer for it that the
people of Scotland (when deliberately
consulted—as they ought to be, in
justice, in propriety, and in common
decency) will cheerfully agree to have
the number of the Lords of Session
diminished, because they would <HI>then</HI>
have something better than their an∣cient
aristocratical court. And with
exultation I can tell, that, so far as
the people of Scotland <HI>can</HI>—in the
limited privilege of Juries which they
have—they do now exercise their
constitutional right in its full extent.
We have a <HI>Smellie,</HI> who has, with a
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
calm but an undaunted spirit, pointed
it out to his fellow citizens in a well
written discourse; and a few months
ago <HI>William Spence,</HI> a young matross,
for whom I was counsel, was indicted
by the Lord Advocate for felonious
<HI>fire-raising.</HI> He was prosecuted by
his lordship in person, with all his
address; and the Lord Justice Clerk,
the Vice President, of the High
Court of Justiciary, gave a charge,
with all his his ability, to find him
guilty. But a respectable jury ac∣quitted
him; and, <HI>as I hope for
mercy from the Judge of all the earth,</HI>
had I been one of their number, I
should have been clear to join in the
verdict. I will give up my own
opinion to no human authority.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23"/>
In the present form and constitu∣tion
of the Court of Session, there
is occasion for at least the full number
of judges which were at first ap∣pointed,
and which has remained un∣diminished
now for <HI>two hundred and
fifty three years.</HI> It is remarkable
that when James V. instituted the
court, the number of the judges was
thought small. Take the words of
<BIBL><HI>Buchanan Hist.</HI> lib. 14. cap. 32.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Joannes Dux Albinus, a pontifice
Romano impetravit, ut summa pe∣cuniae
annua quanta satis esset ad</HI>
paucorum <HI>judicum salarium solven∣dum
imperaretur ecclesiastico ordini
universo, a singulisque pro modò,
census exigeretur.</HI></Q> He tells us, it
was difficult to obtain money for sa∣laries
even to those <HI>few;</HI> so much
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
stronger <HI>then</HI> too was the love of mo∣ney
than the love of justice—and he
sternly delivers his opinion that the
institution did not produce the good
that was expected from it: <Q><HI>Omnium
civium bona</HI> quindecim <HI>hominum
arbitrio sunt commissa, quibus et
perpetua est potestas, et imperium
plane tyrannicum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>perpetua potestas</HI> is the griev∣ance
of a <HI>standing jury;</HI> and the <HI>im∣perium
plane tyrannicum</HI> must, in the
nature of things, reside in a body of
men who possess at once the province
of judge and of jury; nay of common
law judges and equity judges; who
are both King's Bench and Chancery,
and whose decisions therefore may be a
compound of law and of fact and of
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
equity, as its members may be dif∣ferently
moved.</P>
<P>It is this which makes it of infinite
consequence to us to preserve all the
judges we have, as long as the court
retains the same constitution; for it
has been found in practice, that,
notwithstanding the staggering objec∣tions
to it in theory, this same court
of fifteen has been so balanced and
mixed, and tempered and mellowed,
by the workings of various qualities,
in the course of time, that upon the
whole it has done very well.</P>
<P>There may, to be sure, come a
DOUGLAS CAUSE, which is too vast an
object for the throw of such a com∣plicated
die. <HI>Non nostrum est tantas
componere lites.</HI> That is not much;
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
because for great causes we have an
appeal to that august tribunal, the
House of Lords. But, as the ex∣pence
of an appeal is more than the
value of almost every cause that the
court of session decides, the right of
appeal is nothing to the greatest
number of our suitors.—We are
therefore concerned that <HI>Innovation</HI>
should be prevented, as we may fear,
but cannot foresee its effects, and as
the <HI>imperium</HI> of the court would be
still more <HI>tyrannicum</HI> in ten than in
fifteen, as spirits have more force as
they are more compressed by distilla∣tion.</P>
<P>Our ancestors took care to have it
solemnly stipulated in the 19<HI>th article
of the Union,</HI> <Q>That the <HI>Court of
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
Session,</HI> or College of Justice, do,
after the Union, and notwithstand∣ing
thereof, <HI>remain in all time
coming,</HI> within Scotland, <HI>as it is
now constituted</HI> by the laws of that
kingdom, and with the same au∣thority
and privileges as before the
Union, subject nevertheless to such
<HI>regulations, for the better admini∣stration
of Justice,</HI> as shall be made
by the Parliament of Great-Britain.</Q></P>
<P>Is it possible, think you, by any
artifice of words, by any little quirk
of any sort, to explain away this ar∣ticle,
and to maintain that the ex∣cepted
power to <HI>make regulations for
the better administration of justice,</HI> in a
<HI>court</HI> which is to <HI>remain in all time
coming as now constituted,</HI> shall be
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
understood to give a licence to destroy
that very court itself, by <HI>changing</HI> its
<HI>constitution?</HI> Is a court of <HI>ten</HI> the
same with a court of <HI>fifteen?</HI> Is a <HI>two-legged</HI>
animal the same with a <HI>four-legged</HI>
animal? I know nobody who
will gravely defend that proposition,
except one grotesque 'philosopher,
whom ludicrous <HI>fable</HI> represents as
going about avowing his hunger, and
wagging his tail, fain to become can∣nibal,
and eat his deceased brethren.
It is <HI>clear,</HI> that the <HI>substance</HI> must be
preserved, though the <HI>accidents</HI> may
be varied. The <HI>Court of Session,</HI> the
<HI>Quindecem Homines,</HI> must remain,
unless <HI>by consent of the people of Scot∣land
themselves,</HI> though the proceed∣ings
of the court, the modes of admi∣nistrating
justice by those <HI>fifteen,</HI> may
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
be regulated occasionally, as the Bri∣tish
Parliament, in its great wisdom,
shall see fit. If any man can enter∣tain
a doubt of <HI>this,</HI> if he is capable
of having his understanding so per∣verted,
I cannot argue with him.</P>
<P>Is it a light matter then to infringe
the <HI>Articles of the Union?</HI>—My coun∣trymen,
hear me! I accost you with a
warning voice.—Have a care!—I my∣self
do fairly acknowledge that I ve∣nerate
and love the ancient Hierarchy,
though, like <HI>Whitefield,</HI> of whose
pious and animated society I had some
share, I can communicate with all
sincere Christians. But you in gene∣ral
think differently, and your <HI>kirk,</HI>
your Presbyterian establishment, stands
just upon the same ground of security
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
that the Court of Session does. No
doubt it may be abolished by univer∣sal
consent, or by consent of a majo∣rity
of <HI>the people of Scotland;</HI> for that
is my firm opinion of the import of
the articles of the Union. But the
<HI>British Parliament</HI> cannot abolish it;
for the British Parliament <HI>sits under
those very articles,</HI> and is limited by
them. But, once yield the <HI>principle,</HI>
were it in the smallest iota, and there
is an end of your security.</P>
<P>I shall take leave to press upon you
the apprehension of what I believe we
shall all agree in resisting; I mean
that, if the articles of Union should
be infringed, there might then most
probably be a prodigious <HI>innovation</HI>
in our <HI>land-tax.</HI> And this concerns
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
not <HI>Scotland</HI> alone.—My lords and
gentlemen of the <HI>English</HI> counties,
where the land-tax is low, <HI>on you I
call.</HI> If Innovation is thus to stride
at large, the <HI>equalizing system</HI> may be
extended: and let me tell you, it is
not <HI>you</HI> that can prevent it. You are
too few. It is to <HI>Scotland</HI> you owe
your safety. Government at present
<HI>dare</HI> not equalize the land-tax. <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
would rise to a man, and assert
the articles of the Union. But the
<HI>praefervidum ingenium Scotorum</HI> may
be subdued.—There is a melancholy
gradation in the old song of <HI>Waly,
waly, up the bank:</HI></P>
<Q><L>I leaned my back unto an oak,</L>
<L>I thought it had been a trusty tree;</L>
<L>But first it <HI>bowed,</HI> and then it <HI>brake,</HI></L>
<L>And so did my true love to me.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32"/>
Let not the Scottish spirit be bowed.
Let LOWTHER come forth, and sup∣port
us! We are his neighbours.
<HI>Paries proximus ardet.</HI> We all know
what HE can do: HE upon whom
the thousands of <HI>Whitehaven</HI> depend
for three of the elements: HE whose
soul is all great—whose resentment is
terrible; but whose liberality is
boundless. I know that he is digni∣fied,
by having hosts of enemies.
But I have fixed his character in my
mind upon no slight inquiry. I have
traversed <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmore∣land:</HI>
I have sojourned at <HI>Carlisle</HI> and
at <HI>Kendal:</HI> I know of the LONSDALE
CLUB at <HI>Lancaster.</HI>—LOWTHER! be
kindly intreated!—<Q><HI>Come over to
Macedonia, and help us!</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"/>
<HI>Innovation</HI> is, in my mind, a very
perilous experiment. I respect the
ancient Barons for their <HI>Nolumus leges
Angliae mutari;</HI> and now that <HI>Dr.
Johnson</HI> is gone to a bettr world, I
bow the intellectual knee to <HI>Lord
Thurlow,</HI> who, with inflexible wis∣dom,
stops the tide of fashionable
reform. It was <HI>Johnson</HI> who con∣firmed
me in my opinion of that
mighty Sage of the law and the con∣stitution.
Before his promotion to
the high office, for which he seems to
have been formed on purpose, the
Doctor said of him, <Q>I honour <HI>Thur∣low,</HI>
Sir.—<HI>Thurlow</HI> is a fine fellow!
He fairly puts his mind to your's.</Q>—
Long, long may he put his mind
against those who would take even
one stone out of that venerable
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
fabrick, which is the wonder of the
world!</P>
<P>Mistake me not, my countrymen,
as if I had changed my opinion
against the <HI>nominal and fictitious votes</HI>
in our counties! <HI>These</HI> are no part
of our old constitution: They are
modern tricks, invented by cunning
lawyers, to cheat the <HI>real Freeholders.</HI>
These will, I hope—these <HI>shall</HI> be
abolished! While I would sacredly
guard the constitution, I would sweep
from it the cobwebs, with all their
vermin.</P>
<P><HI>Innovation</HI> frightens me, because I
never can be sure what will come
next. <Q>Hitherto shalt thou come,
but no further; and here shall thy
proud waves be stayed!</Q> is not for
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
mortals to say. My Lord <HI>March∣mont</HI>
did me the honour of a visit a
few years ago, and made a remark,
which still vibrates in my ear: <Q>Sir,
this country has been governed by
wise men; and we have had no
notion what mischief fools could
do.</Q>—At another time, talking of
this very subject of lessening the
number of judges in Scotland, which
has been formerly mooted, his lord∣ship
said, <Q>No. It must not be.
Scotland is far from the sun of
government, and must be lighted
by many lustres!</Q>—
<Q><L>"There the bright flame was shot through Marchmont's foul!"</L></Q></P>
<P>The present attempt puts me in
mind of one of the many good stories
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
which I have heard my father tell.—
An Earl of <HI>Seaforth</HI> took it into his
head that he would pull down <HI>Bran</HI>
castle, the ancient seat of his family.
The <HI>clan</HI> was alarmed. The <HI>caper∣fey</HI>
(the deer's head, the crest of the
Mackenzie's) was displayed. The
brave <HI>Mackenzies</HI> took fire, assembled,
and came to him in a body. <Q>My
lord, this shall not be! Wiser men
than you built this castle! You
shall not demolish it!</Q>—<HI>There</HI> was
the true spirit of clanship: not a
slavish subjection to an individual;
but a voluntary attachment to their
patriarchal father and lord—to the fa∣mily
—to the throne.</P>
<P>I abhor annihilation—and five of
our judges shall not perish, if I can
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
prevent it.—What, in the name of
goodness, is the motive to this violent
measure? Does the country com∣plain
that there are too many judges?
No.—Do the judges themselves
complain? I trust, No.—For what,
I pray you, is the Court of Session?
Why, it is an aggregate of <HI>fourteen</HI>
separate and distinct subordinate
courts, and one Court of Appeal.
There are fourteen <HI>ordinary lords:</HI>
Each of these has his own roll of
causes, in one half of which his
judgement is allowed to be final.
The Court of Appeal is the whole
body of those <HI>Lord Ordinaries,</HI> with
the Lord President at their head;
and this Court of Appeal sits five
days in the week to review judgments
of the <HI>Ordinaries.</HI>—Now let us con∣sider
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
how business is done in this
court, or, more properly speaking,
in these courts. It is done chiefly in
writing, and most voluminous writing
it is: there are <HI>minutes, representa∣tions,
answers, replies, duplies, triplies,
memorials hinc inde—cum multis aliis,
que nunc</HI> perscribere <HI>longum est;</HI> so
that each <HI>process</HI> (as the papers in a
suit are called) makes a thick bundle,
which is carried to the judge's house;
and this he must peruse, and after∣wards
put his <HI>interlocutor</HI> upon it in
writing, and authenticate it by his
subscription. Now I <HI>know,</HI> and every
man acquainted with the court knows,
and <HI>it can be proved by all the mem∣bers
of the College of Justice,</HI> that it
is with the utmost difficulty that even
the fourteen judges whom we have,
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
can get through the business with
reasonable dispatch. How is it pos∣sible
then that it can be done by a
third fewer people, be they ever so
laborious? Nine Dukes of <HI>Richmond</HI>
could not do it.</P>
<P>I could see some meaning in dimi∣nishing
the <HI>Court of Review,</HI> and let∣ting
only the <HI>ten</HI> senior judges, or
perhaps the <HI>five</HI> senior judges, sit in
the <HI>Inner House,</HI> that the Court of
Review might move quicker, by be∣ing
less unwieldy, and the other
judges might have more time to ripen
and decide causes in the first instance,
which is the most laborious part of
the business. <HI>That</HI> I could under∣stand,
as coming within the power
conceded, in the articles of Union, to
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
make <HI>regulations.</HI> But to make <Q>the
labourers few, when the harvest
truly is great,</Q> seems to me to be
very strange policy.</P>
<P>And here I have an <HI>argumentum
ad homines.</HI> I <HI>will not believe</HI> that
the Lords of Session themselves are so
unconscientious as to approve of this
measure, though <HI>Rumour,</HI> with all
her tongues, has wantonly said they
are for it. My argument is this:—
There is not one of them who has
not, again and again, said, what I
have just now stated, that the duty
of his office is very great, and that in
session-time he is quite harrassed, he
has so much to do.—Will they then
undertake to do more, that they may
get a little more money? I hope not.
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
As it must be <HI>sure</HI> that they are <HI>per∣fectly
innocent</HI> of so heavy a charge, I
may put it in strong words—<Q>Either
they <HI>have</HI> been <HI>liars;</HI> or, They
<HI>mean</HI> to be <HI>cheats.</HI></Q> That is the in∣famous
charge which their approba∣tion
of lessening their number, with∣out
lessening or shortening the business
of the court, would involve.—I beg
ten thousand pardons for even utter∣ing
such coarse epithets; but my in∣dignation
is roused, that any creature
whatever should have the audacity
to impute to the judges of my coun∣try
so abominable an alternative.</P>
<P><HI>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri
sacra fames?</HI> is an exclamation which
keeps pace with mankind, from age
to age. But, surely, we ought to
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
suppose judges have learnt better
things, and have extirpated from
their hallowed breasts, <Q><HI>the root of
all evil.</HI></Q>—How injurious is it to
imagine they will be like some impu∣dent
sluts, who, for more wages,
will undertake to be both cookmaid
and chambermaid—<HI>Delicate coalition!</HI>
—The Lords of Session are, or should
be, Gentlemen. Shall we make them
a parcel of <HI>Scrubs?</HI>—<Q>Of a Monday I
drive the coach; of a Tuesday I drive
the plough; on a Wednesday I follow
the hounds; a Thursday I dun the
tenants; on Friday I go to market;
on Saturday I draw warrants; and
a Sunday I draw beer.</Q></P>
<P>Suppose it should be thought right
to increase the salaries of the Lords of
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
Session; is there no way of doing it
but making two-thirds of them devour
the rest, like Pharaoh's lean and fat
kine? Is the state so poor, that we
must adopt a measure similar to the
barbarous permission in China and
Otaheite, to murder their children,
lest they should not have food
enough? Six thousand pounds a
year would make them up £1000
each; and cannot that miserable sum
be spared off some corner of the sine∣cure
establishment? I persuade my∣self
that the people of Scotland them∣selves
would submit to a <HI>census,</HI> in
order to ransom their court. If the
Judges are poor, let them hold out
<HI>the Mendicant pouch,</HI> and receive our
<HI>benevolence!</HI> I, for one, would cheer∣fully
pay my <HI>quota,</HI> rather than suffer
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
so dangerous an amputation to be
botchingly performed upon our old
judicial body.</P>
<P>But is it quite clear that there
should be an augmentation of their
salaries? The Lord President has
already £1400 a year: every Ordinary
Lord has better than <HI>six hundred gui∣neas;</HI>
and six of their number are also
Lords of Justiciary, of whom the
Lord Justice Clerk has £400 a year,
and each of the other five has £200
a year. Besides, every one of those
six is allowed £300 a year for circuit
expences; and now that they have
obtained an act of Parliament, allow∣ing
them to stay only three days at
each assize-town instead of six, as they
were formerly obliged to do (<HI>while the
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
same allowance for expences is quietly
continued)</HI> they have, upon my word,
very comfortable provisions. The
Justiciary gown is an excellent object
of ambition, and an encouragement
for laudable exertion to the Ordinary
Lords. But even without that, they
have a very decent premium from the
state, and may live very well in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
as judges should live; <Q>not in
rioting and drunkenness,</Q> indeed,
but in grave abstraction, as becomes
their office. Dr. <HI>South's</HI> pulpit joke,
upon the wages of sin being death—
<Q>Poor wages, that a man cannot live
by</Q>—will not, in my opinion, ap∣ply
to <HI>all</HI> offices. The state, in many
cases, is only to help a man to live;
not wholly to support him. The
state should enable him fully to de∣fray
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
the additional expence occasioned
by the office which he holds: but he
is a hungry hound indeed, who comes
into an office of respect and experi∣ence,
such as that of a judge, with
nothing at all of his own, neither fa∣mily
estate, nor fortune acquired by
practice. I own I should think a
man in such circumstances ought not
to be made a judge: either his birth
must be mean—his abilities small—
or his conduct imprudent.</P>
<P>Were there a difficulty to find men
of merit willing to be made Lords of
Session, by reason of the salary being
too small, I could understand this
<HI>procrustian</HI> expedient: but let us at
least wait till that is the case, which,
well Mr. <HI>Dundas</HI> knows, it is not as
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
yet, by any means. Will he tell me
that the salary of that office is not
sufficiently considerable, for which
Mr. <HI>Alexander Gordon,</HI> brother to the
Earl of Aberdeen, uncle to the Duke
of Gordon, and a man of good under∣standing,
experience, and integrity,
solicited for years, and—<HI>pudet haec
opprobria!</HI> might perhaps have been
soliciting still, had not a political
wave, in the tempest of last year,
thrown him into port.—An office de∣sired
by Mr. <HI>John Maclaurin (filius
Colini fama super</HI> aethera <HI>noti,</HI> and a
son of no common talents).—An office
which would be accepted by Mr. <HI>Wil∣liam
Nairne,</HI> our Vice-Dean, whose
character truly exhibits a heaven-born
judge.—An office which would com∣fort,
which would satisfy, Mr. <HI>George
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
Wallace,</HI> whose knowledge, applica∣tion,
and honesty, none will deny;
whom Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> has praised,
but not promoted. <HI>Laudatur et
alget.</HI></P>
<P>I could with pleasure give a long
list of my deserving brethren. To us,
it is <HI>not fair.</HI> It is <HI>unjust</HI> to lessen the
number of prizes after the lottery has
begun drawing; after we, by an ex∣pensive
education, and much time
and labour, have purchased our tickets,
in the faith that our chance for a prize
is to be what it ever has been. As
for myself, I do most certainly believe
that I am now writing from pure mo∣tives,
because I have at present no wish
for the serious and important office of
a Lord of Session. I have a confi∣dence
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
(perhaps too great a confidence)
in my abilities; and therefore will try
my fortune, for some time at least, in
a wider sphere. But this I declare,
that though the situation seems to me
too confined, I never thought the sa∣lary
too small.</P>
<P>Let us be cautious of augmenting
the salaries of our judges. Judges,
like men of genius and learning,
<HI>nutriendi sunt non saginandi.</HI>—A <HI>gown</HI>
in Scotland should not be too good a
<HI>place,</HI> lest it become altogether an
object of political preferment. We
have already several noble lords who
are of the Faculty of Advocates, and
who might perhaps condescend to
take such a loaf. Lord <HI>Salton</HI> might
think it a <HI>snug thing.</HI> My cousin,
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
Lord <HI>Cathcart,</HI> might see it to be
<HI>better than a regiment.</HI> Lord <HI>Stair</HI>
might <HI>add</HI> it to his <HI>finances.</HI> Lord
<HI>Cassillis</HI> might chuse it by way of
<HI>otium cum dignitate.</HI>—And the gen∣tlemen
whom I have mentioned, with
an <HI>Erskine,</HI> a <HI>Blair,</HI> an <HI>Abercrombie,</HI>
a <HI>Grant,</HI> a <HI>Cullen,</HI> and all the rest
who have honourably borne the heat
of the day, might languish and die,
without ever obtaining that rank to
which they will in justice be entitled.</P>
<P>Take the Scottish Bench as it is
now endowed—take it in a pecuniary
view: It is a <HI>tontine</HI> for our sons. In
no country in Europe, but Scotland,
is the profession of the law an <HI>etat,</HI> a
rank. Many a gentleman with us
enters advocate merely to have a fea∣ther
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
in his cap. The prime society
of Edinburgh, is lawyers. <HI>They</HI>
give the tone, as, <HI>arbitri elegantiarum,
they</HI> rule the theatre. <HI>They</HI> make
balls for the ladies; and once (I sup∣pose
to shew the prodigious extent of
their power) they let the nation know
that they could proscribe even a beau∣tiful
Duchess, the very soul of gay fes∣tivity.
<HI>Black, law black,</HI> is the com∣mon
dress of the gentlemen of Edin∣burgh,
by choice, as at Geneva and
Lucca, by an oeconomical regulation
of the state, a sumptuary law: and
hence, when <HI>Foote</HI> was amongst us, he
used to call <HI>black</HI> the <HI>Edinburgh hunt.</HI>
It exalts our gentlemen to think they
may be judges, as, by calculation, it
has been found that there are two
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
vacancies for every three years. They
are continually looking upwards.</P>
<Q><L>Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri</L>
<L>Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus.</L></Q>
<P>I must speak plain, and say, that
I fear this crude scheme of diminishing
the number of the Lords of Session
has something in it more dangerous
than you are aware of. <Q>More is
meant than meets the ear.</Q> A
politician's lust of power is exorbitant.
If he can but have the supreme tri∣bunal
of Scotland of his own forming,
what may he not do? To say nothing
of our <HI>property,</HI> it is now very well
understood that the whole <HI>political in∣terest</HI>
of Scotland is in the hands of
the Lords of Session; for they ascer∣tain
the validity of all the votes,
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
whether in our counties or in our
boroughs: and when we afterwards
bring our contested elections before a
committee of the House of Commons,
we have the mortification to find that
Mr. <HI>Grenville's</HI> bill is to us, on the
north of the Tweed, as if it were not.
In vain do we plead, in vain do we
press upon the committee, the absurdi∣ty,
the gross iniquity, of an <HI>interlocutor.</HI>
A resolute <HI>Caledonian Nominee</HI> tells
them the case has been decided by
the <HI>only competent court,</HI> which sta∣tutes
have invested with the exclusive
power of trying votes;—and honest
<HI>John Bull</HI> believes this, and acqui∣esces,
never considering that the great
law of parliament, the inherent right
of the House of Commons to judge
of the qualifications of its own mem∣bers,
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
must ever be paramount to the
jurisdiction of particular subordinate
courts.—I am sorry, Mr. <HI>George Byng,</HI>
that I cannot appeal to you, at pre∣sent,
as a Member of Parliament, for
the truth of what I am maintaining:
For though I differ from you, in my
political creed, as far as the east is
from the west, I think you an useful
and active watchman of the state.
And I am never unmindful of your
civility to me, as a counsel, when you
sat Chairman of the Ayrshire Com∣mittee.
But you may tell your friends
who are in parliament; and Messieurs
<HI>Dudley Long, Praed, Bankes, Dun∣combe,</HI>
and several more who were of
that committee, will remember the
piteous tale.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="55"/>
I should oppose any diminution
whatever of the number of the Lords
of Session, because it would make "the
law's delay" be more grievously felt:
but, above all, I dislike this particular
plot, to revive the <HI>Decemviri.</HI> It is
<HI>ominous.</HI> In the words of <HI>Livy</HI> I will
say, <Q><HI>Non placere nomen; periculosum
libertati esse.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> seconded the King's Advo∣cate's
motion for leave to bring in
this bill—this odious bill of pains
and penalties?—It was Sir <HI>Adam Fer∣gusson;</HI>
a man who has vexed me
not a little, by his political success in
our county, against my wishes. He is
one whom Mr. Dundas has selected to
hold up as an instance of the pleni∣tude
of his power.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="56"/>
Do any of you want to be in∣formed
of Mr. Henry Dundas's
power? I dare say not. Care is
taken that its full extent shall be
proclaimed as far as <HI>Orkney.</HI> Yet
let us contemplate a striking instance;
it would make a picture for the exhi∣bition,
or a scene at <HI>Astley's.</HI> Be∣hold
him in your Metropolis, which
the death of Sir <HI>Lawrence Dundas</HI>
left open to him.—With his <HI>right</HI>
hand he has moved the LORD PROVOST,
<HI>Hunter Blair</HI> (gold chain and all)
from his political base.—With his <HI>left,</HI>
he has thrust in as <HI>representative of the
citizens of Edinburgh</HI>—Whom?—a
respectable merchant? No.—A pros∣perous
tradesman? No.—A <HI>Coutts,</HI>
the father of the great establishment
in the Strand, London? No.—A <HI>Kerr,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
whom <HI>Pelham</HI> loved? No.—A citizen
of any sort, good, bad, or indiffe∣rent?
No. No. No.—Whom then?
Why Sir <HI>Adam Fergusson, advocate,</HI>
the <HI>late</HI> member for the <HI>county of
Ayr!</HI> Sir Adam Fergusson wrote a
circular letter against peers interfering
in our county election, and several
very worthy gentlemen joined the
standard of <HI>independency,</HI> as they ima∣gined,
which he erected. Carrying
them along with him, and yet
"having his peers as well as we,"
he contrived to possess, for two par∣liaments,
the representation of Ayr∣shire,
by means of <HI>those superiority
votes,</HI> which that county has declared
to be <HI>nominal and fictitious,</HI> while
the REAL INTEREST was unrepresented.
Sir Adam Fergusson last year, <HI>as we
are told,</HI> made overtures to the <HI>Earl
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
of Eglintoune,</HI> and formed a <HI>coalition</HI>
with his lordship. That he was <HI>not
elected,</HI> we <HI>know;</HI> that he <HI>voted for
his former opponent,</HI> we <HI>know;</HI> and <HI>it
is said</HI> he supports the earl's friend
for one parliament, and the earl is to
make him member next parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the report of this curious agreement burst upon the county, like a bomb, and stunned men of all parties, I made the following Bell∣man's rhimes, to usher in my friend Colonel Hugh Montgomerie as our representative:
<LG>
<L>Adam, too long you've kept your seat,</L>
<L>With little for your pains;</L>
<L>Trust me, <HI>you'll</HI> never make ends meet,</L>
<L>Computing loss and gains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Surrender then to gallant Hugh;</L>
<L>It truly will be best!</L>
<L>Bring your mock votes along with you,</L>
<L>And laugh at all the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus Ayrshire yet may prosperous be,</L>
<L>With such a brave Commander:</L>
<L>And if <HI>you're</HI> pleased <HI>our</HI> joy to see,</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> will, <HI>indeed,</HI> be <HI>candour.</HI></L>
</LG>
THE REAL INTEREST.</NOTE>
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
—<HI>if he can.</HI> I have never heard his
lordship say that this report is true:
but if it is, the noble earl must not
take it amiss, if some of the best
friends of his family should disdain
what they think degrading to him, and
feel obnoxious to themselves. Amongst
those friends, I myself am one of the
warmest, both as an enthusiast for an∣cient
feudal attachments, and as having
the honour and happiness to be mar∣ried
to his lordship's relation, a true
<HI>Montgomerie,</HI> whom I esteem, whom
I love, after fifteen years, as on the
day when she gave me her hand.—
But I have an objection to Sir Adam
Fergusson, on account of a paltry
money question, which being now
under the arbitration of three of our
Lords of Session, I forbear to exhibit
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
it, till the result is known.—Mr. <HI>Mac∣adam,</HI>
of <HI>Craigengillan,</HI> as able and
as spirited a man as any in his Ma∣jesty's
dominions, and Sir <HI>John
Whitefoord,</HI> who is honour itself,
both gentlemen of extensive interest
in Ayrshire, have also objections to
him, which they have stated to me,
and will tell any body who thinks it
worth while to ask them.—In these
circumstances, the House of Eglin∣toune
can hardly expect that the
great county of Ayr, the Yorkshire of
Scotland, will be brought implicitly
to wheel, and vote for sir Adam Fer∣gusson,
merely that a bargain, which
should never have been made, may be
fulfilled. I myself have reason to
hope, that many of the real free∣holders
of Ayrshire will support me
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
at the election for next parliament,
against which I have declared myself
a candidate. Colonel <HI>Montgomerie</HI>
has had the great honour of being
chosen by the real Freeholders. May
I not have it in my turn? <HI>Ed anche
Io son pittore.</HI> By the time this par∣liament
is over, he may be content to
be <Q><HI>Vejanius, armis Herculis ad postem
fixis.</HI></Q>—I shall certainly stand, upon
the substantial interest of the gentle∣men
of landed property; and if, upon
a fair trial, I should not succeed in
<Q>that object of ambition, which I
have most ardently at heart,</Q> I have
resources enough to prevent me from
being discontented or fretful. Perhaps
Sir Adam Fergusson may support me.
Why should he not? I know of no
objection the honourable baronet can
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
have to me, though I am sorry that
I have an objection to the honourable
baronet. I have asked his vote and
interest by a letter. His answer has
neither granted nor refused my appli∣cation.
He waves it on the common
civil ground, that it is too soon to
decide. In the mean time, I shall
endeavour to deserve the support of
the real freeholders, by exerting my∣self,
as much as I possibly can, to serve
either the county in general, or indi∣viduals
of it; and when a man does
the best, he can, he may perhaps,
have his reward. But this country-city
member has led me off from
Edinburgh, to which I now return;
and I do say, that, if issuing an effec∣tual
<HI>congé d'elire,</HI> by which Sir Adam
Fergusson is made member for the
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
capital of Scotland, be not power with
a witness, I am at a loss to conceive
what power is.</P>
<P>As to all this power assumed by
Mr. Dundas, I must say <HI>miror!</HI> But
I certainly do not blame <HI>him.</HI> As <HI>Cato</HI>
says, when his gallant son <HI>Marcus</HI> is
brought in <HI>dead,</HI> <Q>Who would not
be that youth?</Q>—The proverb says,
<Q>A living dog is better than a dead
lion.</Q> What then must a living lion
be? But under what <HI>genus,</HI> under
what <HI>species,</HI> are they to be ranked,
whose pusillanimity is the cause that
this lion alone domineers in the forest?
Our late and present situation brings
to my remembrance some verses in an
old poem, which I have heard my
father repeat: they are a kind of im∣precation,
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
applicable to a <HI>coalition</HI>
which in the last age took place in
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May also these men of many wiles. <HI>Ambages.</HI></NOTE> May eke thae men o' mony wimples,</L>
<L>Sir James and Sir John Dalrymples,</L>
<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">With.</NOTE> Wi' their new allies, the Dundases,</L>
<L>Rule<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">All.</NOTE> aw our lords and lairds like asses!</L></Q>
<P>Yet I will do Mr. Dundas the
justice to declare, that, large as his
power is, he has not much abused it.
He has, indeed, taken very good care
of his relations! And why should he
not? Though, to be sure, flesh and
blood must feel his having put his
young nephew over the heads of I
know not how many of us, as Soli∣citor
General. But I do not believe
that he has been cruel, oppressive, or
vindictive. I know but of two wrong
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
things that he has done. One was
attacking Sir Lawrence Dundas in the
county of Orkney, <Q>in his own ma∣nour,
where he was a father to the
people;</Q> as that hospitable, that
splendid, that imperial baronet, said
to me, with tears in his eyes. The
other was persuading my honoured
father, a venerable judge, in the de∣cline
of his life, to embark in county
politicks, from which he had ceased
for twenty years, and make a parcel of
unsubstantial votes, which he abhorred,
in order to support Sir Adam Fer∣gusson
in Ayrshire, against the old
and the real interest of the county.
But both these instances were the
effects of <HI>politicks</HI> which I see to be
<HI>poison to the mind.</HI> I have therefore
no more objection to Mr. Dundas's
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
being sole <HI>Protector</HI> of Scotland, than
any other man, if we <HI>must</HI> be so ruled.
Nay, I have an <HI>interest</HI> that <HI>he</HI> should
be the person. For there is an here∣ditary
friendship between our families.
We were at college together. We
have oft enjoyed
<Q><L>—The "happier hour</L>
<L>"Of social pleasure.—"</L></Q>
And I trust to the generosity of his
feelings, that, as he <HI>knows</HI> he once did
me a severe injury, which I have from
my heart forgiven, he will be anxious
to make me full amends, if ever it
shall be in his power. The desire of
elevation is as keen in me as in him∣self;
though I am not so well fitted
for party exploits.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="67"/>
As <HI>Nero</HI> wished that the people of
Rome had but one neck, that he
might, if he pleased, cut them off at
a single stroke.—So a deep, an artful
politician, will be desirous to contract
the body which he wishes to com∣mand.
It is easier driving four horses
in hand than six. Besides, while there
are <HI>fifteen</HI> judges, the danger that they
may not be all tractable is propor∣tionally
multiplied, when compared
with the number <HI>ten.</HI> There may
be a proud, an eloquent <HI>Alemoor,</HI>
who will watch like a dragon;—a
sturdy <HI>Elliock,</HI> who will not bend;—
a firm <HI>Stonefield,</HI> who not only has
a will of his own, but if one in high
place, trusting that he is sheltered
in his situation, presumes to be
coarsely insolent, can tell it him in
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
his ear, aye, and to his beard;
—an honourable <HI>Rockville,</HI> who be∣ing
of higher rank than any of them,
before he became a judge, will not
stoop—will not truckle—will not
be led—but will deliver his own ho∣nest
good sense with the mild dignity
that becomes him.</P>
<P>It is very agreeable to consider,
that one bad judge cannot contami∣nate
a number who are good, yet,
when we take the converse of the
proposition, we shall find one good
judge can prevent the evil of many
bad ones. He can hold up truth and
justice so conspicuously, that bad
judges have not hardiness enough to
turn aside from them; and, if they
should, he can alarm the country.
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
When a man of probity and spirit, a
Lord <HI>Newhall,</HI> whose character is
ably drawn in prose by the late Lord
President <HI>Arniston,</HI> father of the
Treasurer of the Navy, and elegantly
in verse by Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Bangour</HI>
—when such a man sits among our
judges, should they be disposed to do
wrong, he can make them hear and
tremble. My honoured father told
me, that Sir <HI>Walter Pringle</HI> "spoke
as one having authority," even when
he was at the bar. "He would cram
a "decision down their throats."</P>
<P><HI>Duncan Forbes</HI> of <HI>Culloden,</HI> when
Lord President of the Court, gave
every day as a toast, at his table,
<Q>Here's to every Lord of Session
who does not deserve to be hangedl</Q>
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
Lord <HI>Auchinleck</HI> and Lord <HI>Monboddo,</HI>
both judges, but <HI>since his time,</HI> are
my authority for this. I do not say
that the toast was very delicate, or
even quite decent; but it may give
some notion what sort of judges there
<HI>may</HI> be. It is well known that <HI>Forbes,</HI>
by the single weight of his character,
assiduously and boldly urged, made a
very great alteration to the better
upon the court, and shewed <HI>Unum
Hominem pluris valuisse quam Civi∣tatem.</HI></P>
<P>A number of judges, taken from
different parts of the country, diffuses
and divides that private and imper∣ceptible
influence which must ever be
in a narrow country. One prejudice
is checked and counterbalanced by
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
another. A judge from the north of
the Tay is corrected by a judge from
the south of the Tay, and is again cor∣rected
by him, in his turn.—I solemnly
declare, I mean no reflection against
the Lords of Session, farther than that
they are not exempted from the frail∣ties
incident to man—that human
nature is human nature every where,
and in a narrow country is more liable
than in a great country, to what I
shall call—honest bias.</P>
<P>With a plausible appearance, it has
been propagated from company to
company, that, were there fewer
Lords of Session, there would be more
security from their responsibility; as
disgrace, which is light when shared
amongst a number, falls heavy upon
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
a few.—But against this you shall
have an unanswerable argument.—
<Q>If they are honest and honourable
men, they will not be the less so
that they are <HI>fifteen.</HI> If they are
not, and mean to do wrong, a junto
of <HI>ten</HI> can do it with more facility.</Q>
<HI>Non meus hic sermo est:</HI> I owe it to
Lord <HI>Palmerston,</HI> from whose con∣versation
there is always something to
be borrowed. I humbly thank his
lordship for it, and beg he may par∣don
my imperfect report of it. He
gave it me at Lord <HI>Ossory's.</HI> I cannot
refrain from mentioning the <HI>place;</HI>
because I am very vain to fit at the
table of <HI>FITZPATRICK:</HI> the respect
for whose ancient and noble blood is
not lessened, but increased, by the
character of its present representative;
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
which, as I feel, is saying a great deal.
I flatter myself FITZPATRICK was con∣vinced.
If he was—I'll answer for
it, all the world shall not make him
flinch.</P>
<P>And now, my countrymen, let me
intreat you to assemble again in your
counties, and boroughs, and corpora∣tions,
and publick bodies of every
kind, and <HI>petition Parliament</HI> against
diminishing the number of the Lords
of Session; unless Parliament will to∣tally
alter the judicial procedure of
Scotland, upon some wise plan, <HI>after
it has received your approbation.</HI> I
would also have you to address the
KING against so alarming a measure.
It is the glory of the reign of
GEORGE III. that he has given inde∣pendency
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
to his judges. His Majesty
will graciously listen to what you
humbly and honestly tell him, relative
to what he has much at heart—the
good administration of justice in his
dominions.</P>
<P>Do not despond, and imagine that
<HI>English</HI> Members of Parliament will
be totally inattentive to what so much
concerns you. My old classical com∣panion,
<HI>Wilkes,</HI> (with whom I pray
you to excuse my keeping company,
he is so pleasant) did indeed once tell
me, when I asked him to attend a
Scottish contest in the House of Com∣mons,
<Q>No, no! Damn it! Not I!
I'll have nothing to do with it! I
care not which prevails! It is only
<HI>Goth</HI> against <HI>Goth!</HI></Q>—But he is now
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
an older member of the great council
of the nation, and I hope will not
grudge to take a little trouble for you,
by way of <HI>doing penance</HI> for his <HI>biting</HI>
and <HI>scratching</HI> in the <HI>North Briton.</HI></P>
<P>You may hope for aid from the
Lord Rector of the university of Glas∣gow,
Mr. <HI>Burke,</HI> who dislikes and
dreads reform in parliament; who
spoke this very session against it like
an angel, and whose benignant heart
will feel for your just anxiety. To
Mr. Burke I was much obliged when
he was in power; and it grieved me
that he embraced, what in all since∣rity
I thought such a measure as jus∣tified
his removal from office;—for
his interest is dear to me as my own.
By his removal, the King's admini∣stration
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
was deprived of the assistance
of that affluent mind, which is so
universally rich, that, as long as Bri∣tish
literature and British politicks
shall endure, it will be said of <HI>Edmund
Burke, "Regum equabat opes animis.</HI>"</P>
<P>You will be listened to by my gal∣lant
Colonel <HI>James Wortley Stuart,</HI>
who, for sterling good sense, in∣formation,
discernment, honour and
honesty, and spirit, is not exceeded
by any of them. As diminishing the
number of our judges would diminish
the influence of the Crown, he pro∣bably
will not like it.</P>
<P>You will be listened to by that brave
<HI>Irishman,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have always stood up for the Irish, in whose fine country I have been hospitably and jovially entertained, and with whom I feel my∣self to be much congenial.

by a triumphant testimony, such as
heroes were honoured with in old
Rome.</P>
<P>I think you may also depend upon
Mr. <HI>Lee,</HI> with whom my intimacy has
been chiefly formed since I made him
dangle at the end of a rope, as Attor∣ney
General, in my East-India letter.
—(What liberality of mind must he
have!)—Though he is not such a
<HI>bigot</HI> as I am, and would be glad to
have <HI>some</HI> reform in Parliament, yet I
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
dare say, when he is made acquainted
with the state of this case, he will
manfully oppose the attempt. I love
Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> exceedingly, though I believe
there are not any two specifick pro∣positions,
of any sort, in which we
exactly agree. But the general mass
of sense and sociality, literature and
religion, in each of us, produces two
given quantities, which unite and
effervesce wonderfully well. To his
great reputation, as a barrister, my
voice can add nothing; but he has
kindly enabled me to bear testimony
to his private worth. I know few
men I would go farther to serve, than
<HI>Jack Lee.</HI></P>
<P>Have confidence in Sir <HI>Matthew
White Ridley;</HI> that stately, that pleas∣ing
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
Northumbrian, who exhibits an
instance of, what it is strange should
be rare,—independent opulence!—
He was a General in the late tumul∣tuous
parliament army. He fought,
he encouraged, and he cheered,—
with a <Q>Fight on, my merry men

tenderness for his country, prevailed
over his pride; and he was the first
to sall back, and give the signal for
retreat. If my sanguine hope has not
deceived me, Sir <HI>Matthew</HI> will be for
us.</P>
<P>I even think it possible that you

how open he is to conviction! I can
have no doubt that, when he has made
himself master of the subject, sees
that the articles of the Union would
be infringed, and knows how very

stop put to this conspiracy, which, I
fear, might have the effect of spring∣ing
a mine that would blow up your

—for the reasons I have given,—such

you are yet to do, that, though not
blest with high heroick blood, but
rather, I think, troubled with a na∣tural
timidity of personal danger,
which it costs me some philosophy to
overcome, I am-persuaded I have so
much real patriotism in my breast,
that I should not hesitate to draw my
sword in your defence. It is the
ROYAL CAUSE. I tremble at the re∣collection
of that parliamentary anar∣chy

delivered us. A return of such con∣fusion

<P>Sir <HI>George Saville,</HI> whose name,
though he be dead, is enough to
rouse every dormant spark of public
spirit, had a political maxim which is
striking, and, I beleive, will be
found true: He said, that, in what∣ever
way any nation was governed
for any considerable time, it <HI>ought</HI> to
be governed in that manner. It was
proved, by experience, that that kind
of government was adapted to that
people. If they maintained their free∣dom,
they ought to be free: if they
submitted to slavery, they ought to
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
be slaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was printed thus far (14 May, 1785) when I had the honour to dine in company with Mr. <HI>Justice Willes</HI> (to whom I am indebted for many civilities) at the court holden at the Old Bailey, London. And he told us, from his father, my Lord <HI>Chief Justice Willes,</HI> that when his father was no more than a <HI>King's Counsel,</HI> he visited <HI>John Duke of Argyll,</HI> at his seat at <HI>Adderbury.</HI> He found him sitting in his great chair, and a number of the nobility and gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> standing round him (<HI>Vulgi</HI> stante corona—the <HI>great vulgar</HI> are certainly worse than the <HI>small</HI>). The Duke said, <Q>My dear <HI>Willes!</HI> won't you have a chair?</Q> And Mr. <HI>Willes</HI> was accordingly seated.

<P>What says our own <HI>Fletcher of

<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
in human affairs, any thing so
unaccountable, as the indignity
and cruelty with which mankind
suffer themselves to be used, under
<HI>pretence</HI> of <HI>Government.</HI></Q></P>
<P>When Peter the Great, Czar of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> was in England, he wished
to see the punishment of <HI>keel-hailing.</HI>
He asked the King to shew it him.
<Q>Sir, (said he) I cannot, unless a man
be found who deserves it.</Q>—<Q>That
shall be no objection (said the Czar).
Take one of my fellows.</Q>—The
King of <HI>England</HI> nobly replied,
<Q>Know, Sir, that when a man, of
any nation whatever, has set his
foot upon <HI>English</HI> ground, he is a
free-man: he is entitled to the pro∣tection
of the laws of this country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="88"/>
The application of this illustrious
anecdote, to the protection which the
<HI>People of Scotland</HI> may expect from
<HI>English</HI> Members of Parliament, is
very obvious. We are now one peo∣ple,
though <Q>a river here, there an
ideal line,</Q> divides what once were
only sister kingdoms. Are not <HI>we</HI>
then, on the north of the Tweed, to
participate of British moderation in
government, as well as those on the
south of the Tweed? And are any
despots of our own land to be per∣mitted
to oppress us? I hope not.
—We may then say to the <HI>English</HI>
Members, in the strong language of
Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> in one of his tragedies—
"O guard us from ourselves!"</P>
<P>It will be in vain to attempt hurry
and evasion, and cajoling;—it will
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
be in vain to employ what powers of
lively ridicule our task-masters possess,
and to represent this alarm to be simi∣lar
to the absurd hue-and-cry against
the change of the <HI>style,</HI> which <HI>Hogarth</HI>
so exquisitely burlesques: <Q>Give us
our eleven days!</Q>—<Q>Give us our
five Lords of Session!</Q>—Believe
me, it is no joke, and it cannot be
made like a joke. A <HI>violation of the
articles of the Union,</HI> and an <HI>extinction
of one third of our judicial relief,</HI>
which is, even now, inadequate to the
wants of our country, are serious
things; or else <Q>there's nothing se∣rious
in mortality.</Q> Shall <HI>one</HI> of
the <HI>troubles of life</HI> (which make the
pensive <HI>Hamlet</HI> balance, whether one
ought to throw off the burthen of it)
be augmented by <HI>another?</HI> Shall
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
"the law's delay" be rendered still
more tedious, by stretching <Q>the in∣solence
of office?</Q></P>
<P>In my zeal to prevent, what ap∣pears
to me a most pernicious innova∣tion,
I may have been somewhat in∣temperate
in my expression. I hope
allowance will be made for it. For,
though agitated and indignant, I am
free from rancour. I write for both
sides of the Tweed. Though my
warning letter goes <HI>directly</HI> to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
I mean that it should <HI>reverbe∣rate</HI>
on <HI>England.</HI> But it would hurt
me very much, if, by any misappre∣hension,
it could possibly be thought
that <HI>any extensive severity in this pam∣phlet</HI>
(for <HI>pauca macula</HI> there will ever
be in all human institutions) <HI>is point∣ed
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
against the honourable judges who
at present compose the Court of Session,</HI>
under the authority of which I have
practised the law, lo! these nineteen
years.</P>
<Q><L>"Most potent, grave, and reverend signors,</L>
<L>"My very noble and approved good masters."</L></Q>
<P>And therefore (though I can scarcely
for a moment suppose it necessary) <HI>I
do now, in most explicit terms, disavow
an intention so injurious.</HI> I have ar∣gued
<HI>hypothetically;</HI> and we all know
that an <HI>hypothesis,</HI> referable to a distant
and imagined period, which I trust
shall never arrive, may be formed as
strongly, and even extravagantly, as
imagination can figure.</P>
<P>But the <HI>permanency</HI> of the <HI>constitu∣tion</HI>
of the court, as fixed by article
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
19 of the Treaty of Union, is <HI>not
imaginary.</HI> For, in corrobaration of
the passage which I have already tran∣scribed,
I beg leave to add, that,
after specifying the qualifications then
requisite for Lords of Session, that
same article of the Treaty says, <Q>yet
so as the <HI>qualifications</HI> made, or to
be made, for capacitating persons to
be named Ordinary Lords of Ses∣sion,
<HI>may be altered by the Parlia∣ment
of Great-Britain.</HI></Q> Does not
this make it perfectly clear that the
<HI>constitution of</HI> the court may <HI>not</HI> be
altered? <HI>Exceptio firmat regulam, in
casibus non exceptis.</HI></P>
<P>In a former part of this letter I
suggested, as a <HI>regulation</HI> of <HI>improve∣ment</HI>
upon the administration of
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
justice in our <HI>unalterable Court of
Session,</HI> that the <HI>ten</HI> senior judges, or
only the <HI>five</HI> senior judges, should sit
in the <HI>inner house</HI> as the Court of Re∣view.
But it now occurs to me, that
it is not always certain that the oldest
judges will be the wisest; and there∣fore
I would rather have them to sit
<HI>seven</HI> and <HI>seven</HI> alternately, with the
President (four with him, or a pre∣siding
judge in his room, to make a
quorum) to review the separate deci∣sions
of the Ordinary Lords. Let the
suitors have time to make their elec∣tion
of either of those Courts of Seven.
Let the President deliver his opinion,
but have no vote, unless where there
happens to be an equality of voices.
And as at present no decree is final,
till after two consecutive judgements
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
of the <HI>inner house,</HI> let there, for the
second judgement, be a privilege to
obtain a new trial before the whole
<HI>fifteen,</HI> as at present, upon cause
shewn; and let the whole fifteen sit
one week in each month for rejecting
or receiving such applications, and
deciding upon them. My suggestions
are offered with great diffidence: but
they are all <HI>legal:</HI> they do not in∣fringe
the sacred constitution of the
College of Justice.</P>
<P>I have one other circumstance to
communicate; but it is of the high∣est
value. I communicate it with a
mixture of awe and fondness.—That
Great Personage, who is allowed by
all to have the best <HI>memory</HI> of any man
<HI>born a Briton,</HI> and is known, by those
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
who know him best, to have a very
sound understanding, and a very hu∣mane
heart, may probably <HI>recollect,</HI>
that, in a conversation with <HI>one of
the most zealous Royalists of the age,</HI>
he was graciously pleased to give Ge∣neral
<HI>Paoli</HI> the just praise of <Q>putting
law into a people who were lawless.</Q></P>
<P>What barbarous oppression, what
political guilt would it be, in part to
extinguish law amongst a brave peo∣ple,
who have long enjoyed it, and
who agreed to the abolition of their
own government upon the faith of
unalterable articles of Union, in con∣sequence
of which they are now at a
great distance from the seat of govern∣ment,
to which it is not easy for their
voice to extend.</P>

This letter, hastily written upon
the spur of the occasion, is already
too long. Yet allow me, my friends
and countrymen, while I with honest
zeal maintain <HI>your</HI> cause—allow me
to indulge a little more my <HI>own
egotism</HI> and <HI>vanity.</HI> They are the
indigenous plants of my mind: they
distinguish it. I may prune their
luxuriancy; but I must not entirely
clear it of them; For then I should
be no longer "as I am;" and per∣haps
there might be something not so
good. <HI>Virtus laudata crescit.—Sume
superbiam quesitam meritis.</HI> I last
year claimed the credit of being no
<HI>time-server;</HI> I think I am giving
pretty good proof that I am not so
this year neither. Though ambitious,
I am uncorrupted; and I envy not
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
high situations which are attained by
the want of publick virtue, in men
born without it; or by the prostitu∣tion
of publick virtue, in men born
with it. Though power and wealth,
and magnificence, may at first dazzle,
and are, I think, most desireable; no
wise man will, upon sober reflection,
envy a situation which he feels he
could not enjoy. My Friend (my
<HI>Maecenas Atavis edite regibus</HI>) Lord
<HI>Mountstuart,</HI> flattered me once very
highly, without intending it.—<Q>I
would do any thing for you (said he)
but bring you into parliament; for
I could not be sure but you might
oppose me in something the very
next day.</Q>—His lordship judged
well. Though I should consider, with
much attention, the opinion of such
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
a friend—before taking my resolution;
—most certainly I should oppose him,
in any measure which I was satisfied
ought to be opposed. I cannot exist
with pleasure, if I have not an honest
independence of mind and of con∣duct;
for though no man loves good
eating and drinking, simply considered,
better than I do—I prefer the broiled
blade-bone of mutton and humble
port of "down-right <HI>Shippen,</HI>" to all
the luxury of all the statesmen who
play the political game all through.</P>
<P>It is my system to regard, in a
publick capacity—measures, and not
men; in a private capacity—men,
and not measures. I can discuss
topicks of literature, or any other
topicks, with mitred <HI>St. Asaph,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
with <HI>Wyndham</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> with <HI>Capel
Loft,</HI> with Dr. <HI>Kippis,</HI> with Dr. <HI>Price,</HI>
with the Reverend Mr. <HI>John Palmer;</HI>
yet there are points of government in
some of them, and points of faith in
others, as to which, had I any
thing to do in the administration of
this country, I should <Q>withstand
them to the face.</Q> I can drink,
I can laugh, I can converse in, per∣fect
good humour, with Whigs, with
Republicans, with Dissenters, with
Independents, with Quakers, with Mo∣ravians,
with Jews. They can do me
no harm. My mind is made up.
My principles are fixed. But I would
vote with Tories, and pray with a
Dean and Chapter.</P>
<P>While I arraign what strikes me as
very wrong in Mr. Henry Dundas,
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
and the Lord Advocate, in their
publick conduct, I am ready to meet
them on friendly, but equal terms,
in private. To the Lord Advocate I
am most willing to allow all his me∣rit.
He has risen to the head of our

the business of a lawyer to that ex∣tent
that he has done. He has made
it a Peruvian profession: yet he is

upon every occasion that I
have known him tried, he was gene∣rous.
And he is a very friendly man.
I should be exceedingly ungrateful if
I did not acknowledge it.</P>
<P>That Mr. Dundas and he should
think of attempting such a bill as this,
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
must make us wonder, and, for a
moment, shew us how weak the
ablest men are, upon some occasions.
I may, without offence, account for
it, by using the very expression of
Mr. Dundas himself, when attacking,
at the bar of the House of Lords, a
decree of the Court of Session, in the
case of a schoolmaster, where I was
counsel on the other side. I can
swear to the phrase.—<Q>They have
been seized with some <HI>infatuation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I cannot allow myself to imagine
that Mr. <HI>Dundas</HI> means to make poor
<HI>Scotland</HI> the scape-goat to be sacrificed
on the altar of <HI>Reform;</HI> and to please
the Minister with a <HI>small</HI> one, because
he has been disappointed of a <HI>great,</HI>
he shall have a <HI>reform of the Court of
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
Session,</HI> since he cannot have a <HI>Reform
of Parliament</HI> (to which, by the bye,
I did not know till t'other day that
Mr. Dundas himself, notwithstanding
appearances, has always been a friend).
—No, no. This cannot be! WILLIAM
PITT would despise such pitiful game.
<HI>Aut Caesar, aut nihil,</HI> is HIS motto.</P>
<Q><L>Poor is the triumph o'er the timorous hare."</L></Q>
<P>We must go to the <HI>Aeneid</HI> for HIS
prototype:
<Q><L>At puer Ascanius mediis in vallibus acri</L>
<L>Gaudet equo; jamque hos cursu, jam superat illos.</L>
<L>Spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis</L>
<L>Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem.</L></Q></P>
<P>The suspicion of such a sacrifice
could be hatched only in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
where, before the <HI>heretable jurisdic∣tions</HI>
were abolished, a man was tried
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
for his life in the court of one of the
chieftains. The jury were going to
bring him in not guilty: but some∣body
whispered them, that <Q>the
young <HI>Laird</HI> had never seen an
execution;</Q> upon which their
verdict was—<HI>Death;</HI> and the man was
hanged.—Though our young Minister
has not yet seen a reform, I hope the
Court of Session shall be spared.</P>
<Q><L>Then trust me, Percy, pity it were,</L>
<L>And great offence to kill</L>
<L>Any of these our harmless men,</L>
<L>For they have done no ill.</L></Q>
<P>I exhort you, my friends and
countrymen, in the words of my de∣parted
<HI>Goldsmith,</HI> who gave me many
<HI>nootes atticae,</HI> and gave me a jewel of
the finest water—the acquaintance of
Sir <HI>Joshua Reynolds;</HI>—I again exhort
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>
you to <Q>fly from petty tyrants to the
Throne!</Q> Apply to the KING,
the fountain of law, justice, and ju∣risdiction!
your application will not
be in vain.—My ingenious friend,
Mr. <HI>Tyers,</HI> in his admirable <HI>Political
Conferences,</HI> makes Lord <HI>Strafford</HI>
(defending to <HI>Pym</HI> his attachment to
<HI>Charles</HI> I.) express the very thoughts
in my breast.—<Q>In my highest flights,
whilst a commoner, my heart was
never averse to monarchy. I was
then neither a Puritan nor an Ar∣minian.
<HI>The more opportunities I
possess of knowing the King, the
more strongly am I attached to his
person and authority.</HI> A King of
England is not to be reduced to
the insignificance of a Doge of
Venice. Since the murder of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
who ruled, I confess,
with a very high hand, the King
has <HI>no favourite.</HI> He has taken
upon him the task of being <HI>more his
own Minister;</HI> and therefore you
have not so much reason to appre∣hend
any violation of popular
rights.</Q></P>
<P>My much respected great grandfa∣ther,
that "worthy gentleman" <HI>David
Boswell of Auchinleck</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thomas Boswell</HI> was the first <HI>Laird</HI> of <HI>Auchin∣leck</HI> (pronounced <HI>Affleck</HI>) Ayrshire, after the estate had fallen to the Crown by the forfeiture of the very ancient family of <HI>that ilk (i. e.</HI> of the <HI>same name)</HI> there being no record nor tradition of any other family having it. I am told the <HI>Afflecks</HI> of <HI>England</HI> are the heirs of the forfeited family. I am proud of the <HI>connection;</HI> but should be unwilling to resign to them the <HI>estate,</HI> of which they have now no need. <HI>Thomas Boswell</HI> was a descendant of the family of <HI>Balmuto,</HI> in <HI>Fife,</HI> whose estate was purchased in this century by a younger son of my family. The wife of <HI>Thomas Boswell</HI> was a daughter of <HI>Campbell</HI> of <HI>Londoun,</HI> and a grand-daughter of the forfeited <HI>Affleck.</HI> He was honoured, in 1504, with a charter from James IV. of Scotland, <Q><HI>Dilecto familiari nostro—pro bono et fideli servitio nobis prestito.</HI></Q> He was killed with his King at the <HI>fatal field</HI> of <HI>Flodden,</HI> in 1513, fighting against the <HI>English,</HI> though he was himself of old York∣shire extraction, being descended of the re∣spectable family of <HI>Bosville</HI> or <HI>Boswell</HI> (for both they and we have spelt it both ways at different times) of <HI>Gunthwait,</HI> in the West Riding. After a separation for ages, I united our <HI>branch</HI> in cordial friendship with the <HI>Stock,</HI> our <HI>Chief</HI> the late <HI>Godfrey Bosville,</HI> Esq. as honest a man, as perfect an example of <Q>the noblest work of God,</Q> as ever breathed. That friendship is continued with his son <HI>William Bosville,</HI> Esq. who, with his father's honest heart, has the cu∣riosity of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> which he has gratified very extensively. He is to let me have a freehold in Yorkshire, a small bit of the old manour, which will connect us from generation to generation.—If it should be asked, What has this note to do here? I answer—to illustrate the authour of the text. And to "pour out all myself as old <HI>Montaigne,</HI>" I wish all this to be known; and you who censure it, have read it, and <HI>must</HI> therefore know it. I am at home in Yorkshire; and I last year assisted at that glorious meeting, where loyalty and liberty united in addressing his Majesty.</NOTE>, a true heart

His uncle, though he had
four daughters, the eldest of whom
was married to Lord <HI>Cathcart</HI> (who
would have been glad to have had
our <HI>old rock</HI>) was feudal enough to
give him the estate. That <HI>Laird</HI> used
to say, <Q>He never saw a man in
his life that he did not think
himself his master.</Q> I, <HI>pejor

I will say, that <Q>I call no man
master,</Q> without reserve. When
I have fixed my opinion upon an im∣portant
question, I maintain it, as a
point of conscience, as a point of
honour; and the SOVEREIGN himself
would find me <HI>tenacem propositi,</HI> as I
humbly, but firmly was, upon the
subject of the American war. I am
a <HI>Tory;</HI> but not a <HI>Slave.</HI>—I am
possessed of an essay, dictated to me
by Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> on the distinction
between a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Tory,</HI> in which
it is shewn, by the wonderous powers
of that illustrious mind, that there is
but a shade of difference between a
moderate Whig and a spirited Tory
—between reasonable men of each
party. Much would I yield, rather
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
than shake the reverence due to Ma∣jesty
by opposition: But there may
come an enterprise of great moment,
as to which it would be deeply culpa∣ble
to conceal my sentiments—as to
which I may think myself obliged to
be a faithful, an intrepid, an inflex∣ible
monitor.</P>
<P>Let me conclude with <HI>eclat</HI>—with
one of the finest passages of <HI>John
Home's</HI> noble and elegant Tragedy of
<HI>Douglas:</HI>
<Q><L>To the liege Lord of my dear native land</L>
<L>I owe a subject's homage: but even Him,</L>
<L>And his high arbitration I'd reject:</L>
<L>Within my bosom reigns another lord,</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this Letter was finished, I have read
"<HI>The Rights of Juries vindicated,</HI> in the case
of the <HI>Dean of St. Asaph,</HI> in the <HI>King's Bench,</HI>"
where Mr. <HI>Erskine</HI> added so much to the lustre
of his professional character; and, incon∣siderable
as my approbation may be, I cannot
refrain from saying, that Mr. <HI>Welch's</HI> speech
upon that occasion appears to me, for legal
knowledge, acute reasoning, and true constitu∣tional
spirit, to be a masterly performance,
and to establish, beyond question, that the
Juries of <HI>England</HI> are judges of law as well as
of fact, in <HI>many civil,</HI> and in <HI>all criminal</HI> trials.
Let me be also permitted to add one to the
number of his Majesty's subjects who heartily
honour Mr. <HI>Justice Willes,</HI> for his clear, free,
yet temperate doctrine, delivered as a judge
not unworthy to have been one at the trial of
the Seven Bishops.—That my principles of
<HI>resistance</HI> may not be misapprehended, any more
than my principles of <HI>submission,</HI> I protest that I
should be the last man in the world to encou∣rage
juries to contradict, rashly, wantonly, or
perversely, the opinion of the judges. On the
contrary, I would have them listen respectfully
to the advice they receive from the Bench, by
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
which they may often be well directed in form∣ing
their own opinion; which, "and not ano∣ther's,"
is the opinion they are to return upon
their oaths. But where, after due attention to
all that the judge has said, they are decidedly
of a different opinion from him, they have not
only a <HI>power</HI> and a <HI>right,</HI> but they are <HI>bound in
conscience,</HI> to bring in a verdict accordingly.
Thus it was in the late case of <HI>Spence,</HI> at Edin∣burgh,
which I have mentioned. The jury,
with every bias for the security of their own
property and peace, with every disposition, as
good citizens, to check a desperate rage of
mobbing, were nevertheless satisfied that that
young soldier, my client, then the prisoner at
the bar, (upon the <HI>general issue,</HI><Q><HI>compounded of
law and of fact,</HI></Q> to use the ever-memorable
words of Baron <HI>Eyre,</HI> in Colonel <HI>Gordon's</HI> trial)
was not guilty of the felonious <HI>fire-raising,</HI> or
<HI>arson,</HI> with which he was charged; and there∣fore
they acquitted him, at which my heart re∣bounded.
It is but justice to add, that we have
at Edinburgh a most respectable gentleman, Sir
<HI>William Forbes</HI> of <HI>Pitsligo,</HI> who, when sitting as
a juryman, and hearing one of the judges mutter
audibly, that <Q>the law must be left to the
court!</Q> rose in his place, and, with a proper
courage, asserted the <HI>full right</HI> of himself and
his bretheren; which had a very good effect.</P>
