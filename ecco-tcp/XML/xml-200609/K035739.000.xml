<L>Sweet <HI>Echo</HI> with their Songs; oft' too they met,</L>

Like <HI>Anio,</HI> tumbling roars; or some bleak Heath,</L>
<L>Where straggling stand the mournful Juniper,</L>
<L>Or Yew-tree scath'd; while in clear Prospect round,</L>
<L>From the Grove's Bosom Spires emerge, and Smoak</L>
<L>In bluish Wreaths ascends, ripe Harvests wave,</L>
<L>Herds low, and Straw-rooft Cotts appear, and Streams</L>
<L>Beneath the Sun-beams twinkle—The shrill Lark,</L>

Whom on the winding <HI>Avon</HI>'s willow'd Banks</L>
<L>Fair Fancy found, and bore the smiling Babe</L>

<L>The sacred Place, whence with religious Awe</L>
<L>They hear, returning from the Field at Eve,</L>
<L>Strange Whisperings of sweet Music thro' the Air)</L>
<L>Here, as with Honey gather'd from the Rock,</L>
<L>She fed the little Prattler, and with Songs</L>
<L>Oft' sooth'd his wondering Ears, with deep Delight</L>
<L>On her soft Lap he sat, and caught the Sounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft' near some crowded City would I walk,</L>
<L>Listening the far-off Noises, rattling Carrs,</L>
<L>Loud Shouts of Joy, sad Shrieks of Sorrow, Knells</L>
<L>Full slowly tolling, Instruments of Trade,</L>
<L>Striking mine Ears with one deep-swelling Hum.</L>
<L>Or wandering near the Sea, attend the Sounds</L>
<L>Of hollow Winds, and ever-beating Waves.</L>
<L>Ev'n when wild Tempests swallow up the Plains,</L>
<L>And <HI>Boreas'</HI> Blasts, big Hail, and Rains combine</L>
<L>To shake the Groves and Mountains, would I sit,</L>
<L>Pensively musing on th' outragious Crimes</L>

That wake Heav'n's Vengeance: at such solemn Hours,</L>
<L>Daemons and Goblins thro' the dark Air shriek,</L>
<L>While <HI>Hecat</HI> with her black-brow'd Sisters nine,</L>
<L>Rides o'er the Earth, and scatters Woes and Deaths.</L>
<L>Then too, they say, in drear <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Wilds</L>
<L>The Lion and the Tiger prowl for Prey</L>
<L>With Roarings loud! the list'ning Traveller</L>
<L>Starts Fear-struck, while the hollow-echoing Vaults</L>

<L>But let me never fail in cloudless Nights,</L>
<L>When silent <HI>Cynthia</HI> in her silver Car</L>
<L>Thro' the blue Concave slides, when shine the Hills,</L>
<L>Twinkle the Streams, and Woods look tipt with Gold,</L>
<L>To seek some level Mead, and there invoke</L>
<L>Old Midnight's Sister Contemplation sage,</L>
<L>(Queen of the rugged Brow, and stern-fixt Eye)</L>
<L>To lift my Soul above this little Earth,</L>
<L>This Folly-fetter'd World; to purge my Ears,</L>
<L>That I may hear the rolling Planets Song,</L>
<L>And tuneful-turning Spheres: If this debarr'd,</L>

Sipping the Night-dew, while they laugh and love,</L>
<L>Shall charm me with aërial Notes.—As thus</L>
<L>I wander musing, lo, what awful Forms</L>
<L>Yonder appear! sharp-ey'd <HI>Philosophy</HI></L>
<L>Clad in dun Robes, an Eagle on his Wrist,</L>
<L>First meets my Eye; next, Virgin <HI>Solitude</HI></L>
<L>Serene, who blushes at each Gazer's Sight;</L>
<L>Then <HI>Wisdom</HI>'s hoary Head, with Crutch in Hand,</L>
<L>Trembling, and bent with Age; last <HI>Virtue</HI>'s self</L>
<L>Smiling, in White array'd, who with her leads</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Innocence,</HI> that prattles by her Side,</L>
<L>A naked Boy!—Harrass'd with Fear I stop,</L>
<L>I gaze, when <HI>Virtue</HI> thus—'Whoe'er thou art,</L>
<L>' Mortal, by whom I deign to be beheld,</L>
<L>' In these my Midnight-Walks; depart, and say</L>
<L>' That henceforth I and my immortal Train</L>
<L>' Forsake <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Isle; who fondly stoops</L>
<L>' To Vice, her favourite Paramour.'—She spoke,</L>
<L>And as she turn'd, her round and rosy Neck,</L>
<L>Her flowing Train, and long, ambrosial Hair,</L>
<L>Breathing rich Odours, I enamour'd view.</L>

<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<L>O who will bear me then to Western Climes,</L>
<L>(Since Virtue leaves our wretched Land) to Shades</L>
<L>Yet unpolluted with <HI>Iberian</HI> Swords;</L>
<L>With simple <HI>Indian</HI> Swains, that I may hunt</L>
<L>The Boar and Tiger thro' <HI>Savannah</HI>'s wild?</L>
<L>There fed on Dates and Herbs, would I despise</L>
<L>The far-fetch'd Cates of Luxury, and Hoards</L>
<L>Of narrow-hearted Avarice; nor heed</L>
<L>The distant Din of the tumultuous World.</L>
<L>So when rude Whirlwinds rouze the roaring Main,</L>
<L>Beneath fair <HI>Thetis</HI> sits, in coral Caves,</L>
<L>Serenely gay, nor sinking Sailors Cries</L>
<L>Disturb her sportive Nymphs, who round her form</L>
<L>The light fantastic Dance, or for her Hair</L>
<L>Weave rosy Crowns, or with according Lutes</L>
<L>Grace the soft Warbles of her honied Voice.</L>
