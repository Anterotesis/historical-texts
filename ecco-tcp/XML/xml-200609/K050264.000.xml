<HEAD>AN
ANSWER
TO A
QUESTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we are to have a Peace, or,
That the Peace is made, What
sort of Peace, or How it has
been brought about; these are
Questions the World begins to have done
with, they have been so much, so often,
and to so little purpose banded about, and
toss'd like a Shuttlecock, from one Party
to another; the Parties themselves begin
to want Breath to rail and throw Scandal.
<HI>Roper</HI> and <HI>Ridpath,</HI> like two <HI>Tom T—men,</HI>
have thrown Night-Dirt at one another
so long, and grop'd into so many Jakes's
up to their Elbows to find it, that they
stink now in the Nostrils of their own
Party. They are become perfectly nau∣seous
to read; the Nation is surfeited
of them, and the People begin to be tired
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
with ill using one another. Would any
tolerable Face appear upon things, we
might expect the People would be inclin∣ed
to be easie; and were the Eyes of some
Great Men open, they may see this was
the Opportunity they never had before, to
make the Nation easie, and themselves
safe. The main thing which agitates the
Minds of Men now, is the Protestant Suc∣cession
and the Pretender. Much Pains
have been taken on both sides to amuse
the World about this remaining Dispute;
one side to make us believe it is safe, and
the other to convince us it is in Danger.
Neither side hath been able to expatiate
upon the Part they affirm. Those who
say, the Protestant Succession is secure,
have not yet shewn us any Step taken
since these New Transactions, for its
particular Security. Those who say it is
in danger, have not so clearly determined
even among themselves, from what par∣ticular
Head of Publick Management that
Danger chiefly proceeds. Both these Un∣certainties
serve to perplex us, and to
leave the thing more undetermined than
consists with the publick Ease of the
Peoples Minds. To contribute something
to that Ease, and bring those whose Place
it is, to consider of Ways to make the
People easie in this Case, this Work is
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
made Publick. Possibly the Question pro∣pounded
may not meet with a Categorical
Answer. But this is certain, it shall shew
you more Directly what is the chief
Question which the substance of Things
before us is like to turn upon; and to
which all our Questions seem to Tend.
Were the great Difficulty of the Successi∣on
brought to a narrow Compass, tho'
we might spend fewer Words about it, we
should sooner come to a direct Answer.
Before I come to the Great and chief
Question upon which this Affair so much
seems to Turn, it seems needful to put the
previous Question upon which so much
Debate has been among us, and let that be
Examined. This previous Question is this:
Is there any real Danger of the Protestant
Succession? Is there any Danger that the
Pretender shall be brought in upon us?
Is there any Danger of Popery, and Ty∣ranny
by Restoring the Son, <HI>as they call
him,</HI> of Abdicated King <HI>James?</HI> This is
the previous Question, as we may now
call it. It is well known that there are
some People among us, who are so far
from allowing that there is any such Dan∣ger,
as the said Question mentions, that
they will have it be a Token of Disaffecti∣on
to the Government to put the Questi∣on;
and are for loading whoever shall
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
offer to Start such a Question, with Cha∣racters,
and Patry-Marks odious to good
Men; such as Incendiary, Promoter of
Discontents, Raiser of Faction, Divider of
the People, and the like: Names which
the Writer of these Sheets, at the same
time, both contemns and abhors. He can∣not
see that he is any Enemy to the
Queen, in Inquiring as diligently as possi∣ble,
whether there are any Attempts to
Depose Her, or dangerous Prospects of
bringing in the hated Rival of Her Glory
and Dominion. It is so far from that, that
it is apparently the Duty of every true
Subject of Her Majesty, to Inquire se∣riously,
whether the publick Peace, the
Queen's Safety, Her Throne, or Her Per∣son
is in any Danger from the wicked De∣sign
of Her, and Her Peoples Enemies.
Wherefore, and for the joint Concern eve∣ry
Protestant <HI>Britain,</HI> has in this thing;
I shall make no Difficulty, plainly and seri∣ously
to State, and to Answer this previous
Question, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Whether there is any
Danger of the Protestant Succession, from
the present Measures, and from the pre∣sent
People concern'd? I am not igno∣rant
of what has been said by some, to
prove that the present Ministry cannot be
suspected of having any View to the Pre∣tender
in any of their Measures. The
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
best Reason which I have seen given upon
that Subject, is, that it is not their Inte∣rest;
and that as we have not found them
Fools that are blind to their own Interest;
that either do not understand, or pursue
it. This we find handled sundry ways,
by sundry Authors, and very much Insi∣sted
upon as a Foundation sor us to build
upon. We shall give our Thoughts upon
it with plainness, and without Fear, or Fa∣vour.
Good Manners requires we should
speak of the Ministry with all due regard
to their Character and Persons. This is a
Tract, design'd to Inquire seriously of a
Weighty and Essential, not a trifling
Thing, which requires but a trifling Ex∣amination;
nor shall it be handled here
with Satyr and Scurrility. We Approve
neither of the Flatteries of one side, or
the Insultings of the other. We shall
readily and most willingly Joyn with those
who are of Opinion, that it is not the In∣terest
of the Ministry to be for the Pre∣tender;
and that the Ministry are not
blind to, or careless of their own Interest;
and Consequently, that the Ministry can∣not
be for the Pretender. This I hope
may be called a direct Answer. When I
say, <HI>Cannot,</HI> I must not, be understood po∣tentially,
that they have no Moral Capacity;
But they cannot without such Incon∣sistencies,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Contradictions and Improbable
things happening in, which render it
highly Irrational, so much us to suppose
it of them. To shut the Door against any
possibility of Cavil, It may be needful al∣so
to take it with us as we go, what we
mean by the Words <HI>be for</HI> the Pretender;
and this can be no otherwise understood,
than to have a Design however remote,
and upon whatever Views to bring him in
to possess the Throne of these Kingdoms.
The matter then being laid down thus, as
sincerely and plainly as possible; we
come to the Question point-blank, and
think it our Duty to say with the greatest
Sincerity, that we do not believe the
Ministry are in any Kind, or with any
Prospect near, or remote, Acting for, or
with a Design or View to bring in the
Pretender. Having granted this, we must
however, to prevent any Breaking in by
way of Cavil on one Hand, or Triumph
on the other; subjoyn immediately, that
we do not in the least Grant by this, that
the Protestant Succession is in no Danger,
even from several of the Measures now
taken in the World. It is far from any
Reflection upon the Ministry, to say, that
however they may Act upon a right
sincere Principle for the Protestant Suc∣cession
in all they do, which, as above
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
we profess to believe. Yet that many of
the Tools they make use of, are of an∣other
Make, and have no Edge to cut
any other way; no Thoughts to move
them towards any other End; no other
Center, which they can have any Tenden∣cy
to; that the Pretender's Interest is the
Magnet, which draws them by its secret
Influence, to point to him as their Pole;
that they have their Aim at his Establish∣ment
here, and own it to be their Aim:
And as they are not Shy to prosess it a∣mong
themselves; so their Conduct in
many things makes it sufficiently publick.
This is not meant as any Reflection upon
the Ministry, for making use of such
Men: The late Ministry did the same, and
every Ministry will, and must Employ Men
sometimes, not as they always Joyn with
them in their politic Principles; but
as either the Men are found useful in
their several Employments, or as the Mi∣nistry
may be under other Circumstances,
which makes it Necessary to them to Em∣ploy
them. Nor, as the <HI>Review</HI> well e∣nough
observ'd, does it follow that <HI>because
the Ministry have Employ'd, or Joyn'd with</HI>
Jacobites <HI>in the publick Affairs, that there∣fore
they must have done it with a</HI> Jacobite
<HI>Principle.</HI> But let the Ministry Employ
these Men by what Necessity, or upon what
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Occasion they will, tho' it may not fol∣low
that the Ministry are therefore for <HI>the
Pretender,</HI> yet it does not also follow that
there is no Danger of the Protestant Suc∣cession
from the Employing those sort of
People: <HI>For what if the Queen should
Die?</HI></P>
<P>The Ministry, it is hoped, are Established
in the Interest of their Queen and Coun∣try;
and therefore it has been Argued, that
supposing the Ministry had the Pretender
in their Eye, yet that it is Irrational to
suggest that they can have any such View
during the Life of Her present Majesty.
Nay, even those profest <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who
we spoke of just now, cannot be so un∣grateful
to think of Deposing the Queen,
who has been so Bountiful, so Kind, so
exceeding Good to them, as in several
Cases to suffer them to be brought into
the Management of Her own Affairs,
when by their Character they might have
been thought Dangerous, even to Her Per∣son▪
thus Winning and Engaging them
by Her Bounty, and the Confidence that
has been plac'd in them, not to Attempt
any thing to Her prejudice, without the
most Monstrous Ingratitude, without fly∣ing
in the Face of all that Sense of Hon∣nor
and Obligation which it is possible
for Men of common Sense to entertain.
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
And it can hradly be thought, that even Pa∣pists
themselves under the highest possessi∣ons
of their Religious Zeal, can Conquer
the Native Aversions they must have to
such abominable Ingratitude, or to think
of bringing in the Pretender upon this
Protestant Nation, even while the Queen
shall be on the Throne. But tho' this
may, <HI>and some doubt that also,</HI> tye up their
Hands during the Queen's Life, yet they
themselves give us but small Reason to
expect any thing from them afterward;
and it will be hard to find any body to
Vouch for them then. These very <HI>Jaco∣bites,
Papists,</HI> and profest Enemies to the
Revolution may be supposed upon these
Pretentions to be Quiet, and offer no
Violence to the present Establishment
while Her Majesty has the Possession, and
while that Life lasts, to which they are so
much Indebted for Her Royal Goodness
and Clemency. <HI>But what would they do, if
the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Come we next to the <HI>French King.</HI> We
are told, that not the <HI>French King</HI> only, but
even the whole <HI>French Nation</HI> are wonder∣fully
forward to acknowledge the Obli∣gation
they are under, to the Justice and
Favour which they have Received from
Her Majesty, in the putting an End to
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
the War; a War which lay Heavy upon
them, and Threaten'd the very Name of
the <HI>French Nation</HI> with Ruin, and much
more Threatn'd the Glory of the <HI>French
Court,</HI> and of their Great Monarch with
an entire Overthrow, a total Eclipse. A
War, which by their own Confession, it was
Impossible for them long to have supported
the Expences of, and which by the great
Superiority of the <HI>Allies,</HI> became Dread∣ful
to them, and that every Campaign
more than other; a War which they were
in such Pain to see the End of, that they
tried all the Powers and Courts in Christen∣dom,
who were the least Neutral, to
Engage a Mediation in order to a Treaty,
and all in vain; and a War, which if Her
Majesty had not Enclin'd to put an End
to, must have Ended perhaps to the
Disadvantage, and Confusion of both
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> if not of all Christen∣dom.
The Obligations the <HI>French</HI> are
under for the bringing this War to so just
and Honourable a Conclusion, are not at
all Concealed. Nay, the <HI>Freuch</HI> them∣selves
have not been backward to make
them publick. The Declarations made by
the <HI>Freuch King</HI> of his Sincerity in the
Overtures made for a General Peace, the
Protestations of his being resolved to Enter
into an entire Confidence, and a League
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Offensive and Defensive with the Queen's
Majesty, for the Preservation of the Peace
of Christendom, his Recognition of Her
Majesty's just Right to the Crown, his
entring into Articles to preserve the U∣nion,
acknowledging the Ninth Electo∣rate
in favour of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI>
and joining in the Great Affair of the
Protestant Succession. As these all con∣vince
the World of the Necessity his
Affairs were reduced to, and the great
Advantages accruing to him by a Peace;
so they seem to be so many Arguments
against our Fears of the <HI>French</HI> entring
into any Engagements against the Crown
of <HI>Britain,</HI> much less any against the
Possession of the Queen during her Life.
Not that the Honour and Sincerity of
the King of <HI>France</HI> is a Foundation fit
for her Majesty or her People to have
any Dependance upon; and the Fraction
of Former Treaties by that Court when
the Glory of that Monarch, or his
particular Views of things has dictated
such Opportunity to him as he thought
fit to close with, are due Cautions to us
all not to have any Dependance of that
kind. But the State of his Affairs, and
the Condition the War has reduced
him to, may give us some Ground to think
our selves safe on that side. He knows
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
what Power he has taken off from his Ene∣mies
in making Peace with Her Majesty;
he knows very well with what loss he sits
down, how his Affairs are weaken'd, and
what need he has to take Breath after so
terrible a War; besides the Flame such an
Action would kindle again in <HI>Europe;</HI>
how it would Animate this whole <HI>British</HI>
Nation against him, in such a manner, and
Endanger bringing in a new War, and per∣haps
a new Confederacy upon him so vio∣lently,
and that before he would be in
a Condition to Match them; that no one
can reasonably suppose the <HI>French</HI> King will
run the hazard of it. And these things may
Tend to make some People easier than or∣dinary
in the Affair of the Succession; be∣lieving
that the <HI>French</HI> King stands in
too much need of the Favour of the Queen
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> whose Power it well be∣hoves
him to keep in Friendship with him,
and whose Nation he will be very Cautious
of provoking a third time, as he has already
done twice to his fatal Experience. All
these things, we say, may seem pretty well
to assure us that nothing is to be feared on
that side so long as Her Majesty lives to sit
upon the <HI>British</HI> Throne. But all leaves
our Grand Question unanswered; and tho'
we may Argue strongly for the <HI>French</HI>
King's Conduct while the present Reign
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
continues, yet few will say, <HI>What he will
do if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, we may even mention the <HI>Preten∣der</HI>
himself, if he has any about him whose
Councils are fit to be Depended upon, and
can Direct him to make a Wise and prudent
Judgment of his own Affairs; if he Acts by
any Scope of Policy, and can take his Mea∣sures
with any foresight; most easie it is
for them to see that it must be in vain for
him to think of making any Attempt in
<HI>Britain,</HI> during the Life of the Queen;
or to expect to Despose Her Majesty, and
set himself up. The <HI>French</HI> Power, upon
which he has already in vain Depended, as
it has not hitherto been able to serve him,
or, his Father; but that their Exile has
continued now above Twenty four Years.
So much less can he be able to Assist him
now while he has been brought as it were
to Kneel to the <HI>British</HI> Court, to put an
End for him to this cruel destructive War;
The Reason is just spoken to, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
this would be to rekindle that Flame, which
he has gotten so lately Quenched, and
which Cost him so much Art, so much
Management, so much Submission to the
<HI>Allies</HI> to Endeavour the Quenching of
before. To Attack the Queen of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> now in behalf of the <HI>Pretender,</HI>
would not only be in the highest Degree
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Ungrateful, Perfidious, and Dishonourable;
but would for ever make the <HI>British</HI> Court
as well as the whole Nation, his Violent
and Implacable Enemies; but would also
Involve him again in a new War with all
<HI>Europe,</HI> who would very gladly Fall in
again with <HI>Britain</HI> to pull down more
Effectually the <HI>French</HI> Power, which has
so long been a Terror to its Neighbours.
So that the <HI>Pretender</HI> can Expect no Help
from the King of <HI>France.</HI> As to what the
<HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and a few petty <HI>Popish</HI>
Powers, who might pretend upon a Re∣ligious
prospect to Assist him, and with
whose Aid, and the Assistance of his Party
here, he may think fit to hazard an At∣tempt
here for the Crown; it is Evident,
and his own Friends will agree in it, that
while the Queen lives, it is Nonscence, and
Ridiculous for them to Attempt it; that it
would immediately Arm the whole Nati∣on
against them, as one Man; and in
Humane probability, it would; like as
his supposed Father was serv'd at the Re∣volution
be the Ruin of his whole Interest,
and blow him at once quite out of the
Nation. I believe that there are
very few who Alarm themselves much
with the Fears of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> from the
Apprehension of his own strength from
Abroad, or from his own Party and Friends
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
at Home here, were they once sure that
he should receive no Assistance from the
King of <HI>France.</HI> If then the King of <HI>France</HI>
cannot be reasonably supposed either to be
Inclin'd, or be in a Conditon to Appear
for him, or Act in his behalf during the
Life of the Queen; neither can the Pre∣tender,
<HI>say some,</HI> unless he is resolved to
Ruin all his Friends, and at last to Ruin
himself, make any Attempt of that Kind
during Her Majesty's Life. <HI>But what if
the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Having then View'd the several Points
of the Nation's Compass, whence our Dan∣ger
of <HI>Jacobite</HI> Plots, and Projects against
the Protestant Succession may be expected
to come; Let us now Enquire a little of
the State of the Nation, that we make a
right Estimate of our Condition, and may
know what to trust to in Cases of Diffi∣culty,
as they lye before us. In doing
this, as well to avoid giving offence to the
People now in Power, as to the Entring
into the Quarrels which Engage the pre∣sent
contending Parties in this Divided
Nation; we shall allow, however some
may think fit to Question it, the main De∣bate;
and Grant this for the present as a
Fundamental, (<HI>viz.) That we are in no
Danger</HI> of the Pretender, <HI>during this Queen's
Reign,</HI> or <HI>during this Ministry's Admini∣stration
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
under Her Majesty;</HI> and avoiding
all Contention of that Kind, shall allow
our Condition to be <HI>SAFE</HI> in every Ar∣ticle
as we go along, <HI>for so long as the Queen
Lives,</HI> referring the Observation of things
in every Head, to those who can Answer
the main Question in our Title, (<HI>viz.) But
what if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>First of all, it may be Noticed, that
the present Safety of this Nation, whe∣ther
we respect Liberty, Religion, Pro∣perty,
or publick Safety and Prosperity,
Depends upon this one Fundamental,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That <HI>alluding reverently to that Text
of Scripture,</HI> we are all built upon the
Foundation of the late Revolution, <HI>Esta∣blisht
Law</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI> being the <HI>chief
Corner-Stone.</HI> By this it is, that Her
Majesty is made our Queen, the Entail of
the Crown being reserv'd in the remain∣der
to Her Majesty in the Act of Settle∣ment
made at the filling up the vacant
Throne, and by all those subsequent Acts,
which Her Majesty's Title was Confirm'd
by, during the Life of the Late King. <HI>This
Revolution,</HI> is that upon which the
Liberties and Religion of this Nation,
were Re-built after the Conflagration
that was made of them in the Calamitous
Times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, and King <HI>James</HI> II.
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
and from hence to the Love of Liberty,
which is found almost to be Naturally
plac'd in the Hearts of true <HI>Britains;</HI> and
upon the View whereof they have acted
all along in the Late War, and in all their
Transactions at Home has obtained the Ti∣tle
of a <HI>REVOLUTION PRINCI∣PLE.</HI>
Noting this then, as above, that
Her Majesty is our Queen by vertue of
the Revolution, and that during Her
Reign, that Establishment alone must be
the Foundation of all Her Administrati∣on;
this must effectually Secure us a∣gainst
any Apprehension that the Persons
acting under Her Majesty, can Act in be∣half
of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> during Her Ma∣jesty's
Life; for that they must immedi∣ately
Overthrow the Throne, Turn the
Queen out of it, and Renounce the Re∣volution,
upon which Her Majesty's Pos∣session
is Established: As the Revolution
therefore is the Base upon which the Throne
of Her Majesty's Possession is Established;
so her Majesty, and all that Act under her,
are obliged to Act upon the Foot of the
said Revolution, even <HI>Will</HI> they, <HI>Nil</HI> they;
or else they sink immediately out of right∣ful
Power to Act at all; Her Majesty's
Title would fall to the Ground, their own
Commissions would from that Hour be
Void; they must Declare their Royal Mi∣stress
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
and Benefactress, a Subject to the
<HI>Pretender,</HI> and all Her Pretences of Right∣ful
Possession, Injurious, and an Usurpati∣on.
These things being so plain, that
he that runs may read them, seem to stop
all our Mouths from so much as any Sug∣gestion,
that any Body can Attempt to
bring in the <HI>Pretender</HI> upon us during the
the Life of Her present Majesty. <HI>But
what if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Subsequent to the Revolution, many
Essential things are form'd by our Parlia∣ments
and Government for the publick
Good, on the Foundation of which much
of the present Peace of the Nation is
Founded; and while the said Revolution
Foundation stands fast, there is good
Ground to believe those Essential Points
shall be preserved. If then we are satis∣fied
that the Revolution Principle shall
subsist as long as the Queen Lives, then
for so long we may have good Ground
to believe we shall Enjoy all those Ad∣vantages
and Benefits which we received
from the said Revolution. But still when
we look back upon those dear Privileges,
the obtaining of which has Cost so much
Money, and the Maintaining of which
has Cost so much Blood, we must with
a deep Sigh reflect upon the precarious
Circumstances of the Nation, whose best
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Privileges hang uncertain upon the Nice
and tender Thread of Royal Mortality,
and say, we are happy while these last, and
these may last while Her Majesty shall
Live. <HI>But what if the Queen should
die?</HI></P>
<P>Let us Descend to some other Parti∣culars
of those Blessings which we do Enjoy
purely as the Effect of the Revolution,
and Examin in what Posture we stand,
with respect to them, and what Assurance
we have of their Continuance: And First,
as to <HI>TOLERATION.</HI> This was the
Greatest and first Blessing the Nation felt
after the immediate Settlement of the
Crown, which was Established by Vertue
of the Revolution Engagement, mentio∣ned
in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Declaration.
The Design of this Law, as it was to
give Liberty for the Worship of God to such
Dissenters as could not Conform to the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to give Ease to
tender Consciences, so as by the Law it
self is expressed; it was to Ease the Minds
of their Majesty's Subjects, and to give
general Quiet to the Nation, whose Peace
had been frequently Disturbed by the vio∣lence
of Persecution. We have seen fre∣quent
Assurances given of the Inviolable
Preservation of this Toleration by Her
Majesty from the Throne in Her Speeches
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
to the Parliament; and during Her Ma∣jesty's
Reign, we have great Reason to
hope the Quiet of the poor People shall
not be broken by either repealing that Law,
or Invading the Intent and Meaning of
it while it remains in Force; and there is a
great many Reasons to hope that the pre∣sent
Ministry are so far Convinc'd of the
Necessity of the said Toleration in order to
preserve the Peace, and the common
Neighbourhood of People, that they can
have no Thought of Breaking in upon it;
or any way making the People, who En∣joy
it, uneasie. Nay, the rather we be∣lieve
this, because the Ferment such a
Breach would put the whole Nation into,
is not the safest Condition the Govern∣ment
can be in upon any Account; And as
the Ministry cannot be supposed to desire
to give Uneasiness and Provocation to the
Commons, but rather to keep them Easi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
and Quiet, and prevent the Enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the present Management from having
any Handle to take hold of to fomen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
Distractions, and Disturbances among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
People; It cannot be thought that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
will push at the Toleration, so as to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦prive
the People of so Considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Death; and when Popish Pretenders, and
<HI>French</HI> Influencies shall prevail, it may
well be expected then, that not Tolera∣tion
of Dissenters only, but even of the
whole Protestant Religion may be in
danger to be Lost; so that however secure
we are of the free Enjoyment of Liberty of
Religion during the Queen's Life, we may
be very well allow'd to ask this Question
with respect to not Toleration only, but
the Church of <HI>England</HI> also, (<HI>viz.</HI>) what
will become of them, <HI>If the Queen should
die?</HI></P>
<P>From Toleration in <HI>England,</HI> come we
to the Constitution of Religious Affairs in
<HI>Scotland;</HI> and here we have different Views
from what the Case in <HI>England</HI> affords us;
the powerful Interest of Jacobitism, if it
may be said to be Formidable any where,
is so there. The Enemies of the Revolu∣tion
are all the Implacable Enemies of the
Church Establishment there: Nay, many
Thousands are the declared Enemies of
the Revolution, and of the Queen's being
upon the Throne, from a meer Implaca∣ble
Aversion to the <HI>Presbyterian Kirk,</HI>
which is Erected, and Established by that
very Revolution which has set the Queen
upon the Throne. The <HI>Union,</HI> which has
yet farther Establish'd that <HI>Prebeterian Kirk,</HI>
is for that Reason the Aversion of the
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
same People, as it is the Aversion of the
<HI>Jacobites,</HI> by being a further Confirmati∣on
of the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succession, and a fur∣ther
Fixing the Queen upon the Throne.
Now as <HI>it is sure,</HI> that <HI>as before,</HI> while the
Queen Lives, and the Revolution Influ∣ence
carries its usual Force in the King∣doms
now United, the <HI>Presbyterian Kirk</HI>
must and will remain, and all the little En∣croachments
which have been made upon
the <HI>Kirk,</HI> as it may be observed, tho' they
have created Uneasiness enough, yet they
still seem to suppose that the Establishment
it self cannot be overthrown. The Uni∣on
and the Revolution Settlement remain
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and must remain, as is said:
While the Queen Lives we can have no Ap∣prehensions
of them; The Reasons are
given above; and as we said before, we are
to take them for granted in this Discourse,
to avoid other Cavils. While then the
Revolution, and the Union are to be the
Foundation of the Administration in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Establisht Church
Government, there must also remain as
the only Legal <HI>Kirk</HI> Constitution, and so
long we can Entertain no Fears of any
thing on that Account. <HI>But what if the
Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
From such Religious Concerns as effect
<HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and other Sectaries, or <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
as we call them; let us take a
look at the remote Danger of the Church
of <HI>England.</HI> We have had a great deal of
Distraction in the time of the late Mini∣stry,
about the Danger of the Church;
and as it appears by the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> published in those
times, and Re-printed since; by the Ser∣mons
of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> and the eminent
Speeches at his Trial, that Danger was
more especially, Suggested to come from
the Encrease of <HI>Dissenters</HI> here, the Mini∣stry
of the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> and the Establishing
<HI>Presbyterianism</HI> in the North of <HI>Britain.</HI>
These things being in a great Measure
now overthrown by the late Change of
the Ministry, and the new Methods taken
in the Management of the publick Affairs;
the People who were then supposed to
Aim at overthrowing the Ministry of
those <HI>Whiggs</HI> are pleased to assure us of
the Safety and flourishing Condition of
the Church, now more than ever; while
the other Party, taking up the like Cry
of the Danger of the Church, tell us, that
now a real visible appearace of Danger to
the Church is before us; and that not on∣ly
to the Church of <HI>England</HI> as such, but
even to the whole Interest, and Safety of
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
the Protestant Religion in <HI>Britain;</HI> that this
Danger is imminent, and unavoidable from
the great Growth and Encrease of <HI>Popery,</HI>
and profest <HI>Jacobitism</HI> in the Nation. This
indeed they give but too great Demon∣strations
of from the spreading of Popish
Agents among us, whose profest Employ∣ment
it is to Amuse, and Impose upon the
poor Country People, as well in Matters
of <HI>Jacobitism,</HI> as of Religion; and the great
Success these Emissaries of Satan have ob∣tain'd
in several Parts of <HI>Britain;</HI> but
especially in the North. Now tho' we
cannot but acknowledge, but that much of
this Alarm is justly Grounded, and that
the Endeavours of <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI>
Agents, and Emissaries in diverse Parts
of <HI>Britian,</HI> are too apparently Successful;
yet as wise Men could never see into the
reality of such Danger, as was by some Peo∣ple
pretended to be Impending over the
Church in the Time of the late Ministry;
So neither can we allow that Popery is so
Evidently at the Door at this Time, as
that we should be Apprehensive of having
the Church of <HI>England</HI> immediately Trans∣vers'd,
and the Protestant Religion in <HI>Bri∣tain:</HI>
And one great Reason for this Opi∣nion
is, that Her Majesty, who is a Zea∣lous
Professor of the Protestant Religion,
and has been Bred up in the Bosom of the
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Church of <HI>England,</HI> is so Rooted in Prin∣ciple,
and had Declared from Her very
Infancy such Horror and Aversion to Po∣pery,
that it cannot Enter into any true
Protestant Thoughts to apprehend any
thing of that Kind, while Her Majesty
lives. <HI>BUT</HI> Lord have Mercy upon
us! <HI>What if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>From Religious Matters, come we next
to consider Civil Interest, Liberties, Privi∣leges,
Properties; the Great Article that
in the late Revolution, went always
Coupled in the Nation's Negative, with
that of Religion, as if they were woven
together; and was always Cry'd upon by
the Mob in one Breath, (<HI>viz.</HI>) No <HI>Popery,</HI>
no <HI>Slavery.</HI> The first of these concerns
our Civil Interest; such as the Publick
Credit, by the Occasions of a long and
Expensive War, and to prevent Levying
severe Taxes for the Carrying on the War,
such as would be Grievous to Trade, Op∣pressive
to the Poor, and Difficult to be
Paid. The Parliament for the Ease of the
Subjects, thought fit, rather to lay Funds
of Interest to raise Money upon, by way
of Loan; Establishing those Interests, pay∣able
as Annuities, and Annual Payments
for the Benefit of those who Advanc'd their
Money for the publick Service. And to
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
make these things Current, that the pub∣lick
Credit might be Sacred, and the
People be made free to Advance their
Money; all possible Assurances of Parlia∣ment
have been given, that the Payments
of Interests, and Annuities shall be kept
punctually, and Exactly according to the
Acts of Parliament, that no Mis-applica∣ons
of the Money shall be made, or Con∣verting
the Money received upon one,
to make good the Deficiency of the other;
and hitherto the Injunctions of that Kind
have been exactly observ'd, and the Pay∣ments
punctually made, which we call
the Credit of the Nation. At the first of
the late Change, when the New Mini∣stry
began to Act, the Fright the People
were put in upon the Suggestion of some,
that all the Parliamentary Funds should be
wiped off with a Spunge, was very Conside∣rable;
and the Credit of those Funds sunk
Exceedingly, with but the bare Appre∣hension
of such a Blow; the Sums being
Infinitely great, and the Number of Indi∣gent
Families being Incredibly many
whose whole Substance lay in those Secu∣rities,
and whose Bread depended upon
those Interests being punctually Paid:
But wiser Men saw quickly there was
no Ground for those Fears; that the New
Ministry stood upon a Foot that could no
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
more be Supported without the publick
Credit, than those that went before them;
that Especially while they were under a
Necessity of Borrowing further Sums, they
behoved to Secure the punctual Paying of
the Old; and by making the People en∣tirely
Easie, not only take from them the
Apprehensions they were under of Losing
what they Lent already; but make them
forward, and willing to Advance more to
this Purpose. They not only Endeavoured
to give the People all possible Satisfacti∣on
that their Money was Safe, and that
the Funds laid by the Parliament in
the former Ministry, should be kept Sa∣cred,
and the Payments punctually made;
but took care to obtain Parliamentary Se∣curities,
by real Funds to be Settled for
the Payment of those Debts contracted by
the former Ministry; and for which no
Provision was made before. This was the
Establishment of a Fund for Payment of
the Interests of the <HI>Navy</HI> Debt, Ordnance,
Victualling, Transport, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Val∣lue
of Seven or Eight Millions; which is
the Substance of what we now call the
South-Sea Stock. By this means the pub∣lick
Credit, which, it was Suggested, would
receive such a Blow at the Change, as that
it should never recover again; and that it
would be Impossible for the New Mini∣stry
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
to Raise any needful Sums of Money
for the Carrying on the War, or for the
publick Occasions, recovered it self so as
that the Government hath ever since found
it Easie to Borrow what ever Sums they
thought fit to Demand in the same man∣ner
as before. Now that these Loans are
Safe, no Man that weighs the Circum∣stances
of the Ministry and Government,
and the Circumstances of the People,
can Doubt; the first being in a constant
Necessity of Supporting the publick Cre∣dit
for the Carrying on publick Affairs,
on any suddain Emergency that may hap∣pen;
and being liable to the Resentment
of Parliament, if any open Infraction
should be made upon the Funds, which
touches so nearly the Honour of the Par∣liaments,
and the Interest of most of the
best Families in the Nation. While this
is the Case, we think it is not Rational to
believe that any Ministry will venture to
attack Parliamentary Credit, in such a
manner; and this will Eminently be the
Case as long as Her Majesty sits on the
Throne. Nor can a thing so bare-fac'dly
Tyrannical and Arbitrary, and above all
Dishonourble and Unjust, be Suggested, as
possible to be Attempted in the Reign of
so Just and Consciencious a Prince; So
that we may be very willing to allow that
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
there is not the least Danger of the publick
Faith being Broken, the publick Credit
lost, the publick Funds stopt, or the Money
being Mis-apply'd. No Cheat, no Spunge
while Her Majesty. <HI>BUT</HI> Alas for us!
<HI>What if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>From this piece of Civil Right, come
we to those Things we call Liberties, and
Privileges. These may indeed be joyned
in some Respects; but as we are Engag'd
in speaking particularly to such Points,
wherein our present Dangers do, or do
not appear; It is proper to mention them
apart. <HI>Privileges</HI> may be distinguished
here from Liberties, as they respect Af∣fairs
of Trade, Corporations, Parliaments,
and Legislature, <HI>&amp;c. Liberty,</HI> as they re∣spect
Laws, Establishments, declared Right,
and such like. As to the first, from the Re∣volution
to this Time they have not
only been Confirm'd, which we had before;
but many Privileges added to the People;
Some of which are Essential to the well-being
of the Kingdom. All the <HI>Quo
Warranto's</HI> against Corporation Privileges,
the High-Commission Court against the
Church's Privileges extending Preroga∣tive
in Detriment of the Subjects natu∣ral
Right; and many such things, which
were Fatal to the Privileges of this Pro∣testant
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Nation, were laid aside, and recei∣ved
their just Condemnation in the Re∣volution;
and not so only, but the Privi∣leges
obtain'd since the Revolation by
Consent of Parliament, are very conside∣rable;
such as the Toleration to this part
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Establishment of the
Church of <HI>Scotland:</HI> For the North part,
in matters of Religion; such as the Tri∣ennial
Election of Parliaments; In Civil
Affairs, such as the several Corporations
Granted upon really useful Foundations
in Trade; as the <HI>Bank Company,</HI> &amp;c and
such like. These and many more, which
may be Named; and which these are
Named only as Heads of, are Secured to
us by Law; and those Laws yet again
made sure to us by the Honour and Ve∣racity
of Her Majesty, and as long as Her
Majesty's Life is spared to these Nations,
we have great Reason to believe we shall
rather Encrease than Lose our Privileges.
<HI>BUT what if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>LIBERTIES,</HI> which come
next in Order may be Summ'd up in what
we call <HI>Legal,</HI> and <HI>Native</HI> Right; or
such as by the natural Consequence of
a Free Nation, and a just Government;
or such as by mutual Assent and Consent
of Soveraign and Subject, are become the
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Legal Right of the latter. These, need∣less
to be Enumerated here, are Summ'd
up into One; or are expresly Enacted by
Statute Law, and thereby become Funda∣mental
to the Constitution. These receive
no Wound, but one of these two ways, ei∣ther
by open Infraction, and Contempt of
Right, or by Dispensing Arbitrary Power;
both of which by the many Assurances
from the Throne, by the constant Jealou∣sies
of Parliaments, and the full Liberty
they have more of late, than ever, taken to
Examin into, and Censure Breaches of the
Laws: We are very well assured shall not
be Attempted in Her Majesty's time: Nay,
on the contrary, the Superiority, and In∣fluence
of Parliaments over and upon the
Management of publick Matters. Nay,
even their Influences upon the Royal Ma∣jesty
of the Soveraign, has been such, and
has in such a manner Insensibly Increased
of Late, that the like has never been
known, or Practised in this Nation for
some Ages before. We see Her Majesty
declines Extending Her Perogative, either
to the Detriment of Her Subjects, in Cases
Civil, or Religious; and wherein it might
be so Extended; nay, when even the
Parliament have desir'd Her to Extend it:
So that we have a great Satisfaction in the
Safety of our Established Liberties, and
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
that no Tyrannical Arbitrary Invasions of
Right shall be made during Her Majesty's
Reign. <HI>BUT what if the Queen should
die?</HI></P>
<P>In like manner for our Properties, our
Estates, Inheritance, Lands, Goods, Lives,
Liberties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These are effectually Se∣cured
by Laws of the Land, and the
Sovereign in this Counrty, having no
Right, but by Law to any part of the Sub∣jects
Estate, Causes that Estate to be called
<HI>PROPERTY.</HI> The Kings and Queens
of <HI>Britain</HI> are Monarchs limited to Act by
the Laws. When they Cease to Rule by
Law, the Constitution is Broken, and
they become Tyrants and Arbitrary, De∣spotick
Invaders of Right. This is De∣clared
by the Revolution, wherein the
Right of the Subject are openly, not set
down only, but Claim'd, Demanded at
what Justice required should be Granted
to them, and as what the Soveraign as
aforesaid has no Right, no Pretence, no
just Authority to take, or detain from
him. This is the Great Capital and
Fundamental Article of <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI> and
the Foundation upon which all the Laws
Subsequent, and Consequential to <HI>Magna-Charta</HI>
have been made [<HI>No freeman shall
be Taken or Imprisoned, or be Disseized of
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
his Freehold, or Liberties, or Free Customs,
or be Out-lawed, or Exiled, or otherwise De∣stroyed;
nor we will not pass upon him, nor
Condemn him, but by Lawful Iudgement of
his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI></HI>
Cap. xxix.] The Words are
Plain and Direct; and as to the Subject, we
are now upon, they require no Comment,
no Explication. Whatever they do, as to
Pleading in Law; the Proof of the Sub∣ject's
Right to the free Possession of his
own Property, is also the less needful to
Enlarge upon here, because it is acknow∣ledged
in full, and express Terms by the
Soveraign, as well in Practise, as in Ex∣pression.
Her Majesty adhering strictly
to this, as a Rule, has from the beginning
of Her Reign, made it Her <HI>Golden Rule,</HI>
to Govern according to Law. Nor while
the Establishment of the Crown it self is
Built upon the Legal Constitution of this
Nation, can it be otherwise here: That
Prince that Governs here and not by Law,
may be said, rather to Oppress, than to
Govern, rather to Over-rule, than to Rule
over his People. <HI>NOW</HI> it cannot with∣out
great and unjustifyable Violence to
Her Majesty's just Government, be Sug∣gested,
that we are in any Danger of Op∣pression
during the Righteous Administra∣tion
of Her Majesty's Reign. The Queen
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
Raises no Money without Act of Parlia∣ment,
keeps up no Standing Army in time
of <HI>Peace,</HI> Dis-seizes no Man of his Property,
or Estate; but every Man Sits in Safety
under his own Vine, and his Fig-tree;
and we doubt not but we shall do as long
as Her Majesty Lives. <HI>BUT what if the
Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>Possibly Cavils may Rise in the Mouths
of those whose Conduct this Nice Questi∣on
may seem to Affect, that this is a Que∣stion
unfit to be asked, and Questionless
such People will have much to say upon
that Subject; as that it is a Factious Que∣stion,
a Question Needless to be Answered,
and Impertinent therefore to be askt; that
it is a Question which respects things re∣mote,
and serves only to fill the Heads
of the People with Fears and Jealousies;
that it is a Question, to which no direct
Answer can be given, and which Suggests
strange Surmises, and amuses People a∣bout
they know not what, and is of no
use, but to make People uneasie without
Cause.</P>
<P>As there is no Objection, which is Ma∣terial
enough to make, but is Material
enough to Answer; so this, altho' there
is nothing of Substance in it, may
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
Introduce something in its Answer of Sub∣stance
enough to consider: It is therefore
most necessary to Convince the consider∣ing
Reader of the Usefulness and Necessity
of putting this Question; and then like∣wise
the Usefulness, and Necessity of
putting this Question <HI>NOW</HI> at this time;
and if it appear to be both a needful Que∣stion
it self, and a seasonable Question,
as to time the rest of the Cavils against, it
will deserve the less regard. That it is a need∣ful
Question, seems justified more abun∣dantly
from a very great Example, to wit,
the Practise of the whole Nation, in Set∣tling
the Succession to the Crown. This
I take to be nothing else, but this: The
Queen having no Issue of Her Body, and
the Pretender to the Crown being Ex∣pelled
by Law, Included in his Father's
Disastrous Flight, and Abdication; when
the Parliament came to Consider of the
State of the Nation, as to Government
as it now stands; that King <HI>William</HI> be∣ing
lately Dead, and Her Majesty with
universal Joy of Her People, being reciev'd
as Queen, the Safety, and the lasting
Happiness of the Nation is so far Secur'd
<HI>BUT what if the Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>The Introduction to all the Acts of Par∣liaments
for Settling the Crown, Implies
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
thus much, and speaks directly this Lan∣guage
(<HI>viz.</HI>) to make the Nation Safe and
Easie, in Case the Queen should die: Nor are
any of those Acts of Parliament Impeach'd
of Faction, or Impertinencies; much less
of Needless blaming the People, and fil∣ling
their Heads with Fears and Jealou∣sies.
If this Example of the Parliament
is not enough, Justifying to this Enquiry
the well known Truth, upon which that
Example of Parliament is Grounded, is
sufficient to justifie it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That we all
known the Queen <HI>MUST die.</HI> None
say, this with more Concern and Regret,
than those who are forwardest to put this
Question, as being of the Opinion above∣said,
that we are effectually Secured a∣gainst
the Pretender, and against all the
terrifying Consequences of the <HI>Frenchi∣fy'd</HI>
Govournours during Her Majesty's
Life. But this is Evident, <HI>the Queen is
Mortal,</HI> tho' crown'd with all that Flattering
Courtiers can bring together, to make
Her appear Great, Glorious, Famous, or
what you please; yet the Queen, yea, the
Queen Her self is. <HI>Mortal,</HI> and <HI>MUST
die.</HI> It is true, Kings and Queens are
called Gods; but this respects their Sacred
Power: nothing supposing and Immortal∣lity
attending their Persons, for they all
<HI>Die</HI> like other Men, and their Dust knows
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
no Distinction in the Grave. Since then it
is most certain that the Queen <HI>MUST
die,</HI> and our Safety, and Happiness in this
Nation depends so much upon the Stabi∣lity
of our Liberties, Religion, and afore∣said
Dependencies after Her Majesty's
Life shall End, it cannot be a Question
Offensive to any who has any Concern
in the Publick good, to enquire into what
shall be the State of our Condition,
or the Posture of our Affairs, when the
Queen shall die; <HI>but this is not all neither.</HI>
As the Queen is Mortal, and we are
assured she must die; so we are none of
us certain, as to be able to know when,
or how soon that Disaster may happen,
at what time, or in what manner. This
then, as it may be remote, and not a long
time; <HI>God of his Infinite Mercy grant it
may be long first, and not before this dif∣ficult
Question we are upon, be Effectually and
Satisfactorily Answered to the Nation:</HI> So
on the other side, it may be <HI>near;</HI> None
of us know how <HI>near</HI> the fatal Blow may
befal us soon, and sooner far than we may
be ready; for to day it may come, while
the cavilling Reader is objecting against
our putting this Question, and calling it
Unreasonable and Needless; while the Word
is in thy very Mouth, mayest thou hear
the fatal Melancholly News, <HI>the Queen's
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
Dead.</HI> News that must one time, or
other be heard; the Word will certainly
come some time, or other, to be spoken in
the present Sense, and to be sure in the
time they are spoken in. How can any
one then say, that it is improper to
ask what shall be our Case, what shall we
do, or what shall be done with us <HI>if the
Queen should die?</HI></P>
<P>But we have an other Melancholy
Incident, which attends the Queen's Mor∣tality,
and which makes this Question
more than ordinarily seasonable to be
ask'd at this time; and that is, that not only
the Queen is Mortal, and she <HI>MUST
die,</HI> and the time uncertain; so that she
<HI>may die,</HI> even to Day before to Morrow,
or in a very little space of time: But Her
Life is under God's Providence, at the
Mercy of <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Jacobites</HI> People;
who the one by their Principles, and the
other by the Circumstances of their Party
are more than ordinarily to be Apprehend∣ed
for their bloody Designs against Her
Majesty, and against the whole Nation.
Nay, there seems more Reason to be Ap∣prehensive
of the dangerous Attempts of
these desperate People, at this time, than
ever, even from the very Reasons which
are given all along in this Work, for our
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
being Safe in our Privileges, our Religi∣ous
and Civil Rights during Her Majesty's
Life; it would be mispending your time
prove to that the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Parties
in this Nation, however they may, as we
have said, be under Tyes and Obliga∣tions
of Honour, Interest, and Gratitude,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not to make attempt upon us during
the Queen's Life; yet that they are more
Encouraged at this time than ever they
were to hope and believe, that when the
Queen shall die, their Turn stands next.
This we say, we believe is lost Labour to
speak of: The said People, the <HI>Popish</HI> and
<HI>Tory</HI> Party will freely own and oppose it.
They all take their Obligations to the
Queen, to End with Her Majesty's Life.
The <HI>French King,</HI> however in Honour, and
Gratitude he may think himself bound to
Encourage the <HI>Pretender</HI> to insult Her
Majesty's Dominions, while the Queen
with whom he Personally is Engaged by
Treaty, shall remain alive, will think him∣self
fully at Liberty from those Obligations
when the Queen shall die. If we are mis∣inform'd
of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs, and of the
Notions, they have in <HI>France</HI> of these things,
they are generally no otherwise understood
then that the King of <HI>France</HI> is Engag'd by
the Peace now in View, not to disturb Her
Majesty's Possession during Her Reign,
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
and Life; but that then the <HI>Pretender's</HI>
Right is to be receiv'd every where. The
<HI>Pretender</HI> himself, howsoever, as abovesaid,
he may despair of his Success in Attempting
to take Possession during the Queen's Life,
will not fail to assume new Hopes at Her
Majesty's Death: So much then of the
hopes of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Power; so
much of the Interest of the <HI>Pretender</HI> de∣pending
upon the single Thread of Life
of a Mortal Person; and we being well
assur'd that they look upon Her Majesty,
only as the Incumbent in a Living, or
Tenant for Life in an Estate, what is more
Natural, than in this Case for us to appre∣hend
Danger to the Life of the Queen;
Especially to such People, who are known
not to make much Consciencies of Murther∣ing
Princes, with whom the King killing
Doctrine is so Universally receiv'd, and
who were so often Detected of villanious
Practices, and Plots against the Life of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Her Majesty's fa∣mous
Predecessor, and that upon the same
Foundation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>
being the <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> to the Crown;
what can we expect from the same Party,
and Men acting from the same Principles;
but the same Practices. It is known that
the Queen by Course of Nature may Live
many Years, and these People have many
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Reasons to be Impatient of so much Delay.
They know that many Accidents may
Intervene to make the Circumstances of
the Nation at the Time of the Queen's
Death, less favourable to their Interests
than they are now; they may have fewer
Friends, as well in Power, as out of Power
by length of time, and the like: These,
and such as these Considerations may ex∣cite
Vilanious and Murtherous Practices
against the precious Life of our Soveraign
(God protect Her Majesty from them)
but while all these Considerations so Na∣turally
offer themselves to us, it seems most
Rational needful, seasonable and just, that
we should be Asking and Answering this
great Question, <HI>What if the Queen should
die?</HI></P>
<P>Thus far we have only asked the Que∣stion
it self, and shewed our Reasons, or
Endeavoured to Justifie the Reasonablness
of the Enquiry. It follows that we make
some brief Essay as an Answer to the Que∣stion.
This may be done many ways; but
the Design of this Tract is rather to put
the Question into your Thought, than to
